## The 						Tokyo String Quartet Unveils Dynamic Performance 
### BECKY JAMES 
A touch of Japan graced the Stanford campus as the
Tokyo String Quartet impressed and enthralled a sell
out crowd in Dinkelspeil Auditorium Wednesday night.
The quartet, an internationally acclaimed ensemble
consisting of four highly accomplished and talented
musicians, has traveled all over the world. They have
performed in both New York City's Lincoln Center and
Carnegie Hall. This season they plan to perform
throughout Europe, Japan and the Far East after visit
ing the Bay Area.
The quartet's members are Peter Oundjian, violin
(the only non-Japanese member and winner of First
Prize in the 1980 International Violin Competition),

The ability of the Tokyo
String Quartret to work to
gether to form impeccable
harmonies with perfect bal
ance between parts was ab
solutely phenomenal.

Kikuei Ikeda, also violin, Kazuhide Isomura, viola, and
Sadao Harada, cello. All four have studied at Julliard
School of Music at some point in their careers, and the
three Japanese members are graduates of the Toho
Academy of Music.
From the opening notes of Mozart's "Quartet No. 19
in C Major," the quartet captured the attention and ad
miration of the audience. Immediately, one was struck
by the beautiful tone achieved by all the members of
the quartet. Several measures into the first move
ment, the most distinctive characteristic of the en
semble presented itself: its balance.
The ability of the Tokyo String Quartet to work to
gether to form impeccable harmonies with perfect bal
ance between parts was absolutely phenomenal. The
quartet's ability to work together was also evidenced
throughout the Mozart composition (and the concert)
by their togetherness through tempo changes and
pauses. Dynamics were excellent as the quartet was

able to play with striking contrasts and contours of
volume both as a group and individually.
The fourth movement of Mozart provided an oppor
tunity to display the flawless technique of the group,
and especially of Oundjian. The end of Mozart's
"Quartet" was met by an extremely enthusiastic reac
tion from the audience.
Alban Berg's "Quartet, Op. 3" received a slightly
less enthusiastic, though not adverse, reaction. This
probably was not due to the performance of the
musicians, however, so much as to the selection of the
piece.
Berg's high level of dissonance and lack of tonality
make his work less accessible to many listeners than
the consonant and classical Mozart. In addition, the
general mood of the Berg piece ranged from disturbing
to frenzied, and this also tended to make it less acces
sible.
The concert closed with Beethoven's "Quartet No.
14." The unity in performing and balance was again
"notable. This composition gave each player a chance to
display his virtuosity through small solos and through
distributing the fast and furious runs among all four
parts. The final chord of the Beethoven and thus the
end of the concert brought a tremendous reaction from
the audience and an encore by the quartet (the finale of
a Haydn quartet).
All performances have weaknesses, and this one
was no exception, but I found that the primary weak
nesses were ones unrelated to the actual musical per
formance of the quartet. The only truly unpleasant
aspect of the concert was the almost intolerable heat in
Dinkelspeil Auditorium throughout the performance,
but of course this problem was beyond the control of
the musicians.
Also, long pauses between movements and the shuf
fling and bustling of the audience during those pauses
caused a certain lack of continuity in the Mozart.
Oundjian touched on one other possible criticism of the
concert when, in announcing the encore, he said that
"perhaps we had had enough dark music this evening."
While I would probably not have characterized the
music as "dark," it is true that a certain liveliness and
letting loose was present in the Haydn piece that had
been absent in the regular program.
By and large, the Tokyo String Quartet's concert
was a brilliant display of technique and general musical
ability. But the concert was not only an exposition by
talented musicians, it was also simply a very enjoyable
evening of music.

display his virtuosity through small solos and through
distributing the fast and furious runs among all four
parts. The final chord of the Beethoven and thus the
end of the concert brought a tremendous reaction from
the audience and an encore by the quartet (the finale of
a Haydn quartet).
All performances have weaknesses, and this one
was no exception, but I found that the primary weak
nesses were ones unrelated to the actual musical per
formance of the quartet. The only truly unpleasant
aspect of the concert was the almost intolerable heat in
Dinkelspeil Auditorium throughout the performance,
but of course this problem was beyond the control of
the musicians.
Also, long pauses between movements and the shuf
fling and bustling of the audience during those pauses
caused a certain lack of continuity in the Mozart.
Oundjian touched on one other possible criticism of the
concert when, in announcing the encore, he said that
"perhaps we had had enough dark music this evening."
While I would probably not have characterized the
music as "dark," it is true that a certain liveliness and
letting loose was present in the Haydn piece that had
been absent in the regular program.
By and large, the Tokyo String Quartet's concert
was a brilliant display of technique and general musical
ability. But the concert was not only an exposition by
talented musicians, it was also simply a very enjoyable
evening of music.


The Tokyo String Quartet, an internationally acclaimed musical ensemble, performed to an en
thusiastic audience Wednesday night in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Starting clockwise from the left,
members include Kazuhide Isomura, Kikuei Ikeda, Sadao Harada and Peter Oundjian.
