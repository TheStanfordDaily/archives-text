# Burglary Rise Points to a Ring
## 
### JOYA WESLEY Senior staff writer 
A significant increase in the
number of burglaries around
campus has the Stanford police
department concerned that a
professional ring may be operat
ing here and that students should
be especially careful.
According to Captain Raoul
Niemeyer of Stanford Police, 36
burglaries have been reported
since Sept. 1. A wide range of
campus residences have been
hit, including Roble, Wilbur,
Branner, Crothers, Governor's
Corner and several co-ops and
fraternity houses.
"Ever since the freshmen
began arriving, we've just been
beset with these burglaries,"
Niemeyer said.
Because of a number of
similarities among the incidents,
the police department believes
these crimes may be the work of
a professional ring. The majority
of the burglaries have taken

place during the lunch and dinner
hours and have usually been the
result of un'"Â»cked doors.
"We've got individuals who are
just roaming the halls and check
ing doors," Niemeyer said.
The robbers have been
removing anything of value from
rooms. Stereos, televisions,
cameras and money have all
been stolen.
In an effort to prevent possi
ble robberies, students have ap
proached suspicious looking indi
viduals in their halls. In most of
these cases, there are stories
made up, "I'm looking for Joe
Blow," according to Niemeyer.
But when checks are made of
student rosters, police find that
no "Joe Blow" exists.
Instead of direct confronta
tion, Niemeyer suggests that
students call the police (at 911)
immediately. The current
response time is three to five
minutes after the call is placed.
So far, there have been no ar
rests in the dormitory bur
glaries.
