## 'A Perfect Peace' is near-perfect piece 
### NANCY HENRY Editorial staff 
There is an imbalance in Yonatan
Lifshitz' life, and he himself has
created an imbalance in the stable,
peaceful and rhythmic life on Kib
butz Granot where he was born and
raised. The forces which Yonatan
must face to achieve harmony
within his family and to satisfy a
restless yearning within himself are
the forces that the Israelis as a
people must confront, and Amos
Oz, in his hauntingly descriptive
and poignant novel, "A Perfect
Peace," has integrated these
themes to emphasize their univer
sality, inevitability and beauty.
Oz is probably Israel's most
popular and most perceptive au
thor, a rare combination.
Repeatedly in works of both fiction
and nonfiction, he has demon
strated a sensitivity to the emo
tional, ethical and political problems
of his country, and has, more effec
tively than anyone else, conveyed
his concerns to the rest of the
world.
In works such as "In the Land of
Israel," "Elsewhere Perhaps," "My
Michael," and now "A Perfect
Peace," he has treated the moral
implications of Jewish presence in
Palestine — describing in detail the
oppressive, ever-present
reminders that the Arabs once lived
here, and that they have not disap
peared.
Oz has examined feelings of guilt
and portrayed blind hatred. He has
translated personal experience into
fiction, touching upon the internal
conflicts that tear at and threaten
the very existence of Israeli soci
ety. His new novel develops all of
these questions within the intensi
fied community of the kibbutz, in a
sense a microcosm of the larger so

ciety; he develops and illuminates,
but never in any sense answers.
History preoccupies the minds of
every character. The small circle of
kibbutzniks is linked one to the
other by his or her own unique
bond, familial or otherwise. From
the opening pages the past and the
need to escape either from or into it
shapes the book and the lives of its
characters. Benya Trotsky is a
shade who haunts the dim past of
the kibbutz, as well as the mind of
Yonatan, possibly Trotsky's illegiti
mate son, and Hava, Yonatan's
mother, who never forgot the love
she lost and is now bitter and hos
tile from so many years of clinging
to a fermenting memory.
Trotsky, a young, half-crazed
poet, blazed through the kibbutz in
1939 (25 years before the present
story takes place), trailing Hava in
his wake, turning violent and then
leaving her behind, doomed to live
with man she doesn't love — or has
convinced herself she doesn't by
comparing him with a romanticized
ideal of the young rebel who made
off to the United States.
Yonatan has never seen Trotsky,
but his presence, like that of past
wars and of the early Israeli
pioneers, lives on in the talk and ac
tions of the older generation,
epitomized by Yonatan's father
Yolek, who still runs the kibbutz.
Yonatan represents the new gen
eration of kibbutzniks. He feels
"hemmed in by a tight little circle of
men and women who had been in
terfering every step of the way."
And so he was; and so he rebelled.
The scenes that build to the
climax of his fleeing the kibbutz, his
retreat into the existential nothing
ness and freedom of the desert are
among the most intense and moving
in the book.
Yonatan is disillusioned with the
socialist ideals of his parents,

though they are so ingrained in him
he could not consider living any
other way. He is frustrated to the
point of despair by a submissive and
vacant wi/e who smiles, fixes his
tea and listens to him, yet who is
never really with him. Even when
they lie in the same bed, she is
rather far off in an escapist world of
her own construction — her an
thropology books and African
music.
Rimona, the wife, is a completely
vacuous human being whose very

existence has to be marveled at.
She, like Yonatan and his parents,
needs the impetus and the contrast
of a completely new face and rela
tionship. When the young idealist
Azariah comes to the kibbutz on a
rainy winter night, the imbalance is
brought to light. The forces of na
ture and those seething within
these ostensibly complacent indi
viduals seek to right the wrong, to
return to the natural cycle that has
been thrown off by Yonatan's
feelings of illegitimacy and discon

tent.
The parallel between Yonatan
and Azariah is immediately evident,
but the relationship which evolves
is complex and bizarre. The cynical
Yonatan wants to leave the kibbutz,
his job, .parents and wife. The
parentless, wifeless and friendless
Azariah wants to join the
cooperative movement he has
heard so much about. -
Spouting Spinozan truisms about
the inevitable fate of mankind,
Azariah slowly, eagerly and naively
infiltrates each and every aspect of
Yonatan's life. He becomes a
protege of sorts to Yolek; he takes
over the mechanic's job Yonatan
never wanted, and he falls in love
with Rimona, whom no one else can
understand or even cares to.
Thus, when Yonatan disappears,
though he desperately searches for
him, Azariah sees it as the natural
and inevitable course of events.
Yonatan never really belonged to
his role, and now he, Azariah, has
arrived to replace him, an arrange
ment agreeable to them both and to
Rimona.
It is not only Benya Trotsky who
represents the past for the
memebers of Kibbutz Granot.
Yolek, secretary of the kibbutz and
minor political figure in the days
before the state, spends much time
musing about the history of Israel.
The Bible and the plight of the Jews
is either at the forefront of each
character's mind; the relative posi
tion this concern holds is a source
of conflict between generations.
As Yolek laments: "My Yoni, in
whom I hoped to see our dreams
come true, the first of a new line of
Jews whose children and children's
children would grow up in this land
and put an end to the malignancy of
Exile. And now the Exile is back
again masquerading as a rich
uncle."

Yet, when Yonatan leaves he
does not seek that rich uncle or his
own fortune in the States as friends
and relatives suspected. Rather, he
goes out to confront a greater his
tory, to quench his thirst for life as
he imagines it, and to right the bal
ance in preparation for his eventual
return.
He heads for Petra, city built out
of rock and left desolate for two mil
lenia — city of the enemy. On the
way he encounters "woman," and
makes passionate love as he never
had before and may never again.
When he returns, his wanderlust
has abated; he can, in a sense,
achieve a perfect peace.
Of course, a perfect peace of any
sort is ironic and deceptive. All the
events in this book take place im
mediately before the War of 1967 in
Israel. This knowledge pervades
every scene and conversation, pro
viding a forboding and ominous tone
throughout.
This is a complex novel. Images
and metaphors abound: the course
of history (especially Jewish his
tory), the recent history of Israel,
the migratory patterns of birds (and
therefore the inevitable cycles of
nature) and the philosophy of
Spinoza are all applied to the lives of
these characters. Perhaps Oz's
multiple and grand themes are a bit
overwhelming — confusing and
convoluted — but he harmonizes
them with masterful skill.
This is an exeptionally sensitive
translation from the Hebrew by Hil
lel Halkin. Although "A Perfect
Peace" is not a book of action,
anyone who appreciates literature
will enjoy it for the repeated beauty
and lyricism of its descriptive
passages and the thought
provoking insights it provides about
the state and culture of modern Is
rael.

This is an exeptionally sensitive
translation from the Hebrew by Hil

There is an imbalance in Yonatan
Lifshitz' life, and he himself has
created an imbalance in the stable,
peaceful and rhythmic life on Kib
butz Granot where he was born and
raised. The forces which Yonatan
must face to achieve harmony
within his family and to satisfy a
restless yearning within himself are
the forces that the Israelis as a
people must confront, and Amos
Oz, in his hauntingly descriptive
and poignant novel, "A Perfect
Peace," has integrated these
themes to emphasize their univer
sality, inevitability and beauty.
Oz is probably Israel's most
popular and most perceptive au
thor, a rare combination.
Repeatedly in works of both fiction
and nonfiction, he has demon
strated a sensitivity to the emo
tional, ethical and political problems
of his country, and has, more effec
tively than anyone else, conveyed
his concerns to the rest of the
world.
In works such as "In the Land of
Israel," "Elsewhere Perhaps," "My
Michael," and now "A Perfect
Peace," he has treated the moral
implications of Jewish presence in
Palestine — describing in detail the
oppressive, ever-present
reminders that the Arabs once lived
here, and that they have not disap
peared.
Oz has examined feelings of guilt
and portrayed blind hatred. He has
translated personal experience into
fiction, touching upon the internal
conflicts that tear at and threaten
the very existence of Israeli soci
ety. His new novel develops all of
these questions within the intensi
fied community of the kibbutz, in a
sense a microcosm of the larger so

ciety; he develops and illuminates,
but never in any sense answers.
History preoccupies the minds of
every character. The small circle of
kibbutzniks is linked one to the
other by his or her own unique
bond, familial or otherwise. From
the opening pages the past and the
need to escape either from or into it
shapes the book and the lives of its
characters. Benya Trotsky is a
shade who haunts the dim past of
the kibbutz, as well as the mind of
Yonatan, possibly Trotsky's illegiti
mate son, and Hava, Yonatan's
mother, who never forgot the love
she lost and is now bitter and hos
tile from so many years of clinging
to a fermenting memory.
Trotsky, a young, half-crazed
poet, blazed through the kibbutz in
1939 (25 years before the present
story takes place), trailing Hava in
his wake, turning violent and then
leaving her behind, doomed to live
with man she doesn't love — or has
convinced herself she doesn't by
comparing him with a romanticized
ideal of the young rebel who made
off to the United States.
Yonatan has never seen Trotsky,
but his presence, like that of past
wars and of the early Israeli
pioneers, lives on in the talk and ac
tions of the older generation,
epitomized by Yonatan's father
Yolek, who still runs the kibbutz.
Yonatan represents the new gen
eration of kibbutzniks. He feels
"hemmed in by a tight little circle of
men and women who had been in
terfering every step of the way."
And so he was; and so he rebelled.
The scenes that build to the
climax of his fleeing the kibbutz, his
retreat into the existential nothing
ness and freedom of the desert are
among the most intense and moving
in the book.
Yonatan is disillusioned with the
socialist ideals of his parents,

though they are so ingrained in him
he could not consider living any
other way. He is frustrated to the
point of despair by a submissive and
vacant wi/e who smiles, fixes his
tea and listens to him, yet who is
never really with him. Even when
they lie in the same bed, she is
rather far off in an escapist world of
her own construction — her an
thropology books and African
music.
Rimona, the wife, is a completely
vacuous human being whose very

existence has to be marveled at.
She, like Yonatan and his parents,
needs the impetus and the contrast
of a completely new face and rela
tionship. When the young idealist
Azariah comes to the kibbutz on a
rainy winter night, the imbalance is
brought to light. The forces of na
ture and those seething within
these ostensibly complacent indi
viduals seek to right the wrong, to
return to the natural cycle that has
been thrown off by Yonatan's
feelings of illegitimacy and discon

tent.
The parallel between Yonatan
and Azariah is immediately evident,
but the relationship which evolves
is complex and bizarre. The cynical
Yonatan wants to leave the kibbutz,
his job, .parents and wife. The
parentless, wifeless and friendless
Azariah wants to join the
cooperative movement he has
heard so much about. -
Spouting Spinozan truisms about
the inevitable fate of mankind,
Azariah slowly, eagerly and naively
infiltrates each and every aspect of
Yonatan's life. He becomes a
protege of sorts to Yolek; he takes
over the mechanic's job Yonatan
never wanted, and he falls in love
with Rimona, whom no one else can
understand or even cares to.
Thus, when Yonatan disappears,
though he desperately searches for
him, Azariah sees it as the natural
and inevitable course of events.
Yonatan never really belonged to
his role, and now he, Azariah, has
arrived to replace him, an arrange
ment agreeable to them both and to
Rimona.
It is not only Benya Trotsky who
represents the past for the
memebers of Kibbutz Granot.
Yolek, secretary of the kibbutz and
minor political figure in the days
before the state, spends much time
musing about the history of Israel.
The Bible and the plight of the Jews
is either at the forefront of each
character's mind; the relative posi
tion this concern holds is a source
of conflict between generations.
As Yolek laments: "My Yoni, in
whom I hoped to see our dreams
come true, the first of a new line of
Jews whose children and children's
children would grow up in this land
and put an end to the malignancy of
Exile. And now the Exile is back
again masquerading as a rich
uncle."

Yet, when Yonatan leaves he
does not seek that rich uncle or his
own fortune in the States as friends
and relatives suspected. Rather, he
goes out to confront a greater his
tory, to quench his thirst for life as
he imagines it, and to right the bal
ance in preparation for his eventual
return.
He heads for Petra, city built out
of rock and left desolate for two mil
lenia — city of the enemy. On the
way he encounters "woman," and
makes passionate love as he never
had before and may never again.
When he returns, his wanderlust
has abated; he can, in a sense,
achieve a perfect peace.
Of course, a perfect peace of any
sort is ironic and deceptive. All the
events in this book take place im
mediately before the War of 1967 in
Israel. This knowledge pervades
every scene and conversation, pro
viding a forboding and ominous tone
throughout.
This is a complex novel. Images
and metaphors abound: the course
of history (especially Jewish his
tory), the recent history of Israel,
the migratory patterns of birds (and
therefore the inevitable cycles of
nature) and the philosophy of
Spinoza are all applied to the lives of
these characters. Perhaps Oz's
multiple and grand themes are a bit
overwhelming — confusing and
convoluted — but he harmonizes
them with masterful skill.

viding a forboding and ominous tone
throughout.
This is a complex novel. Images
and metaphors abound: the course
of history (especially Jewish his
tory), the recent history of Israel,
the migratory patterns of birds (and
therefore the inevitable cycles of
nature) and the philosophy of
Spinoza are all applied to the lives of
these characters. Perhaps Oz's
multiple and grand themes are a bit
overwhelming — confusing and
convoluted — but he harmonizes
them with masterful skill.
This is an exeptionally sensitive
translation from the Hebrew by Hil
lel Halkin. Although "A Perfect
Peace" is not a book of action,
anyone who appreciates literature
will enjoy it for the repeated beauty
and lyricism of its descriptive
passages and the thought
provoking insights it provides about
the state and culture of modern Is
rael.
