## Stanford on Short Side Against UCLA, 34-9 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
The Stanford football team is starting to
resemble a cheap used car — as soon as
one thing is fixed, something else falls
apart.
The defense, a mess for the last three
games, turned in a respectable perfor
mance in Saturday's 34-9 loss to UCLA,
holding the Bruins' offense to just a pair of
field goals until halfway through the third
quarter. The final score looks bad — it is

the largest margin of defeat for Stanford in
four years — but it really doesn't reflect
how well the Cardinal defense played.
It does, however, give an indication ot
how pitiful the Stanford offense looked to
the 63,000 spectators in sunny Stanford
Stadium and the regional audience on CBS
TV. The unit that had averaged 31.2 points
and 491.5 total yards in its previous four
games wobbled to nine points and a measly
202 yards, and quarterback John Paye was
sacked seven times.
Paye connected on 31 of his 45 passes —

including eight straight on the first drive of
the game — but 23 of those completions
went to his running backs, and the overall
average gain was under six yards. The
ground game was nearly nonexistent —
running backs carried the ball only 16 times
for 51 yards. When Paye's sacks are figured
in, Stanford's net rushing yardage was
seven yards.
"We were one-dimensional," Cardinal
coach Jack Elway admitted afterward, "We
had to be. I didn't think we could run the
ball against them with any consistency."

Especially after star fullback Brad Muster
was forced out of the game in the first quar
ter with what is apparently a bruised ster
num. He will be X-rayed today to deter
mine whether there was any fracture of his
ribs, and whether he will be able to play
against USC next week.
The intensity of the Cardinal players — a
question mark since their dispirited loss to
San Diego State the week before — was
improved Saturday, but not enough to beat
a team of UCLA's caliber. Stanford played
the Bruins close for about five-eighths of

the game, and got to within four points in
the third quarter, but didn't have what it
took to win the game. "These kids
w?nted to win, there's no question about
that," Elway said. "We're down now, but
we'll have to go back out there in practice
this week, look it in the eyeball and go at it
again."
On its first drive, the Cardinal looked vir
tually unstoppable. Paye drove Stanford
methodically to the UCLA 13-yard line
before making a bad choice of receivers.

UCLA's first-quarter touchdown off a blocked punt made a 3-0 ble blocking UCLA players — whether would-be punt blockers
Bruin lead a 10-0 bulge.As it turned out, the Cardinal had trou- or pass rushers — all afternoon.
With Muster open in the left flat, Paye tried to force
a throw to Jeff James over the middle, and watched
linebacker Ken Norton Jr. snag the pass and ramble
out to the UCLA 40. "That was just a terrible read on
my part," Paye said.
The Bruins capitalized with a 38-yard field goal from
John Lee, and less than a minute later, they were on
the board again.
Reserve UCLA cornerback Darryl Henley —
younger brother of Stanford tailback Thomas Henley
— sped virtually untouched into the Cardinal backfield
on a Doug Robison punt attempt and blocked the ball
into the end zone, where Josh Shinnick fell on it for a
Bruin touchdown and a 10-0 lead.
After a successful Stanford punt, UCLA marched
right back down the field, and the officials made their
first bad call of the game. On first and 10 from the
Cardinal 14, linebacker Matt Soderlund hit tailback
James Primus, knocking the ball to the ground, where
linebacker Jack Gilmete fell on it. The play was at first
called a fumble — which it was — and then the officials
decided the ball had been dead — which it hadn't.
UCLA's Eric Ball made up for the call on the next
play, however, fumbling the ball away to the Cardinal's
Tom Prukop. After a bad punt gave the Bruins the ball
back at the Stanford 40, UCLA quarterback David

Norrie drove the team into range for a 26-yard Lee
field goal.
Finally, with 59 seconds left in the half, David
Sweeney's 30-yard field goal put Stanford on the
board. The Cardinal went into the locker room only 10
points down, and it had yet to allow the Bruins an of
fensive touchdown.
On its first possession of the second half, Stanford
made it a ballgame. Kevin Scott took the kickoff at the
15-yard line and scooted left around his blockers to the
UCLA 42, where an unsportsmanlike conduct foul
against the Bruins put the ball on the 28.
From there, Paye moved the Cardinal to the five,
where an unusual double personal foul against UCLA
set up a one-yard touchdown run by Brian Morris.
When Sweeney missed the PAT, Stanford trailed 13-9.
And UCLA had new incentive.
"After that touchdown at the start of the half, every
one was saying to himself, They got a cheap one,' "
Bruin defensive tackle Mark Walen said. "We all kind of
rallied around that. It upped the intensity a lot."
On its last six possessions of the game, in fact, Stan
ford recorded only 38 total yards. Robison punted four
times, Paye was sacked and fumbled and reserve quar
terback Fred Buckley was intercepted on the Card
inal's final drive.
UCLA's offense had no such troubles.
The loss goes into the Stanford record book as the
team's worst since its 62-36 defeat at the hands of
Arizona State in 1981.

UCLA's first-quarter touchdown off a blocked punt made a 3-0 ble blocking UCLA players — whether would-be punt blockers
Bruin lead a 10-0 bulge.As it turned out, the Cardinal had trou- or pass rushers — all afternoon.
With Muster open in the left flat, Paye tried to force
a throw to Jeff James over the middle, and watched
linebacker Ken Norton Jr. snag the pass and ramble
out to the UCLA 40. "That was just a terrible read on
my part," Paye said.
The Bruins capitalized with a 38-yard field goal from
John Lee, and less than a minute later, they were on
the board again.
Reserve UCLA cornerback Darryl Henley —
younger brother of Stanford tailback Thomas Henley
— sped virtually untouched into the Cardinal backfield
on a Doug Robison punt attempt and blocked the ball
into the end zone, where Josh Shinnick fell on it for a
Bruin touchdown and a 10-0 lead.
After a successful Stanford punt, UCLA marched
right back down the field, and the officials made their
first bad call of the game. On first and 10 from the
Cardinal 14, linebacker Matt Soderlund hit tailback
James Primus, knocking the ball to the ground, where
linebacker Jack Gilmete fell on it. The play was at first
called a fumble — which it was — and then the officials
decided the ball had been dead — which it hadn't.
UCLA's Eric Ball made up for the call on the next
play, however, fumbling the ball away to the Cardinal's
Tom Prukop. After a bad punt gave the Bruins the ball
back at the Stanford 40, UCLA quarterback David

Norrie drove the team into range for a 26-yard Lee
field goal.
Finally, with 59 seconds left in the half, David
Sweeney's 30-yard field goal put Stanford on the
board. The Cardinal went into the locker room only 10
points down, and it had yet to allow the Bruins an of
fensive touchdown.
On its first possession of the second half, Stanford
made it a ballgame. Kevin Scott took the kickoff at the
15-yard line and scooted left around his blockers to the
UCLA 42, where an unsportsmanlike conduct foul
against the Bruins put the ball on the 28.
From there, Paye moved the Cardinal to the five,
where an unusual double personal foul against UCLA
set up a one-yard touchdown run by Brian Morris.
When Sweeney missed the PAT, Stanford trailed 13-9.
And UCLA had new incentive.
"After that touchdown at the start of the half, every
one was saying to himself, They got a cheap one,' "
Bruin defensive tackle Mark Walen said. "We all kind of
rallied around that. It upped the intensity a lot."
On its last six possessions of the game, in fact, Stan
ford recorded only 38 total yards. Robison punted four
times, Paye was sacked and fumbled and reserve quar
terback Fred Buckley was intercepted on the Card
inal's final drive.
UCLA's offense had no such troubles.
The loss goes into the Stanford record book as the
team's worst since its 62-36 defeat at the hands of
Arizona State in 1981.
The Stanford football team is starting to
resemble a cheap used car — as soon as
one thing is fixed, something else falls
apart.
The defense, a mess for the last three
games, turned in a respectable perfor
mance in Saturday's 34-9 loss to UCLA,
holding the Bruins' offense to just a pair of
field goals until halfway through the third
quarter. The final score looks bad — it is

the largest margin of defeat for Stanford in
four years — but it really doesn't reflect
how well the Cardinal defense played.
It does, however, give an indication ot
how pitiful the Stanford offense looked to
the 63,000 spectators in sunny Stanford
Stadium and the regional audience on CBS
TV. The unit that had averaged 31.2 points
and 491.5 total yards in its previous four
games wobbled to nine points and a measly
202 yards, and quarterback John Paye was
sacked seven times.
Paye connected on 31 of his 45 passes —

including eight straight on the first drive of
the game — but 23 of those completions
went to his running backs, and the overall
average gain was under six yards. The
ground game was nearly nonexistent —
running backs carried the ball only 16 times
for 51 yards. When Paye's sacks are figured
in, Stanford's net rushing yardage was
seven yards.
"We were one-dimensional," Cardinal
coach Jack Elway admitted afterward, "We
had to be. I didn't think we could run the
ball against them with any consistency."

Especially after star fullback Brad Muster
was forced out of the game in the first quar
ter with what is apparently a bruised ster
num. He will be X-rayed today to deter
mine whether there was any fracture of his
ribs, and whether he will be able to play
against USC next week.
The intensity of the Cardinal players — a
question mark since their dispirited loss to
San Diego State the week before — was
improved Saturday, but not enough to beat
a team of UCLA's caliber. Stanford played
the Bruins close for about five-eighths of

the game, and got to within four points in
the third quarter, but didn't have what it
took to win the game. "These kids
w?nted to win, there's no question about
that," Elway said. "We're down now, but
we'll have to go back out there in practice
this week, look it in the eyeball and go at it
again."
On its first drive, the Cardinal looked vir
tually unstoppable. Paye drove Stanford
methodically to the UCLA 13-yard line
before making a bad choice of receivers.
