## Stanford on Short Side Against UCLA, 34-9 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
The Stanford football team is starting to
resemble a cheap used car — as soon as
one thing is fixed, something else falls
apart.
The defense, a mess for the last three
games, turned in a respectable perfor
mance in Saturday's 34-9 loss to UCLA,
holding the Bruins' offense to just a pair of
field goals until halfway through the third
quarter. The final score looks bad — it is

the largest margin of defeat for Stanford in
four years — but it really doesn't reflect
how well the Cardinal defense played.
It does, however, give an indication ot
how pitiful the Stanford offense looked to
the 63,000 spectators in sunny Stanford
Stadium and the regional audience on CBS
TV. The unit that had averaged 31.2 points
and 491.5 total yards in its previous four
games wobbled to nine points and a measly
202 yards, and quarterback John Paye was
sacked seven times.
Paye connected on 31 of his 45 passes —

including eight straight on the first drive of
the game — but 23 of those completions
went to his running backs, and the overall
average gain was under six yards. The
ground game was nearly nonexistent —
running backs carried the ball only 16 times
for 51 yards. When Paye's sacks are figured
in, Stanford's net rushing yardage was
seven yards.
"We were one-dimensional," Cardinal
coach Jack Elway admitted afterward, "We
had to be. I didn't think we could run the
ball against them with any consistency."

Especially after star fullback Brad Muster
was forced out of the game in the first quar
ter with what is apparently a bruised ster
num. He will be X-rayed today to deter
mine whether there was any fracture of his
ribs, and whether he will be able to play
against USC next week.
The intensity of the Cardinal players — a
question mark since their dispirited loss to
San Diego State the week before — was
improved Saturday, but not enough to beat
a team of UCLA's caliber. Stanford played
the Bruins close for about five-eighths of

the game, and got to within four points in
the third quarter, but didn't have what it
took to win the game. "These kids
w?nted to win, there's no question about
that," Elway said. "We're down now, but
we'll have to go back out there in practice
this week, look it in the eyeball and go at it
again."
On its first drive, the Cardinal looked vir
tually unstoppable. Paye drove Stanford
methodically to the UCLA 13-yard line
before making a bad choice of receivers.
