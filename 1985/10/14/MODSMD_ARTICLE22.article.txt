# Men Win on Late Goal
## Dump Dons for first time in a decade 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
SAN FRANCISCO â€” "How
sweet it is."
So yelled Stanford forward Gian
carlo Feruzzi as he shook his fist in
celebration of his Cardinal team's 2-
1 overtime victory over the Univer
sity of San Francisco Dons last
Friday.
It was the first time the Cardinal,
now 7-6-2 overall and 2-1 in the
Pacific Soccer Conference,
defeated USF in over a decade.
Feruzzi and his teammate Angel
Vasquez combined for both of Stan
ford's goals in front of a crowd of
approximately 800 in Steve
Negoesco Stadium on the USF
campus.
Feruzzi began to smell the vic
tory almost as soon as the lights
had gone on in the stadium. With
both teams still getting settled on
the field, he delivered a lightning
bolt just eight minutes into the con
test.
In Stanford's first scoring threat
of the night, Vasquez executed a
quick run to the right side of the
USF net and chipped the ball across
to the streaking Feruzzi.
Feruzzi then snapped the ball off
his head and past goalkeeper Mark
Powell to give Stanford a 1-0 lead.
Efficiency. One shot on goal, one
score for the Cardinal.
The quick strike stunned the
skillful Dons into the realization that
this year they weren't going to be
able to waltz to victory over Stan
ford.
With both teams playing with in
tensity and at the top of their
games, the first 35 minutes of the

game provided exciting soccer for
the large crowd. But it was in the
last 10 minutes of the first half
when the fireworks really began.
With nine minutes remaining,
Stanford midfielder Cassio Con
ceicao went for it all on a direct kick
from 45 yards out. The high pass to
Vasquez beat all the defenders, but
Vasquez mistimed the bouncing
ball and whiffed.
USF counter-attacked quickly,
and seconds later midfielder Theo
Narvestad booted a direct kick into
the Cardinal penalty area. The ball
glanced off forward George Vukic's
head to the feet of midfielder Marco
Lucchetta who pushed the ball by
the surprised Stanford goalie Tom
Austin.
The score was suddenly tied 1-1,
but the fireworks display was just
beginning.
Two minutes later, Cardinal
midfielder Tom Rafalovich
delivered a diving header at the
USF goal and Powell had to make a
diving save.
Finally, with under a minute left
in the half, Vukic, the Dons' leading
scorer, nailed a 25-yard shot that hit
the left post and was cleared by
Cardinal fullback Todd Rafalovich.
Halftime was but a brief respite
in the action, allowing both the fans
and the players catch to their
breaths.
Trends began to emerge in the
hard-fought second half. USF
passed back to goalie Powell, who
set up the Don offense by punting
the ball across midfield.
Stanford, on the other hand,
used the sides of the field to move
the ball. Vasquez, usually a

midfielder, played left wing for the
first time this year, and he turned in
a brilliant performance.
A member of the gold medal win
ning West team at the National
Sports Festival this past summer,
Vasquez repeatedly received
sideline passes from his teammates
and proceeded to make several
dangerous runs at the USF goal.
Thanks to strong defenses on
both sides, however, time ran out
in regulation with the score still tied
at 1-1.
Overtime consisted of two 10-
minute periods. With neither team
showing any signs of fatigue,
Feruzzi and Vasquez teamed up
again for the game-winning goal.
Seven minutes into the first OT,
Feruzzi spun around with the ball
and beat all the defenders. As
Feruzzi charged toward the goal, a
beaten defender dragged Feruzzi
down from behind.
"I was just able to flick the ball
out to my right when he took me
down," Feruzzi said. "The referee
had good vision to see Angel
(Vasquez) coming and not call the
foul."
Vasquez appeared from nowhere
on the right side to get to the ball,
so the referee saw the Stanford ad
vantage and didn't blow the whistle.
Vasquez then drilled the ball into
the far end of the net.
The Cardinal sideline erupted in
celebration, even though there
were still 13 more minutes of soc
cer to play.
USF star Vukic did his best to tie
up the game, but Stanford held on
to secure the victory.
