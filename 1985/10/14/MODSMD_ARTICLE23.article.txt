# Cardiac Card Is Comatose
## 
### 
Many bad things have been said
about Stanford this year — most of
which have centered around the
defense. It seemed like we were
looking at 1982 revisited, a "try-to
outscore-the-other-guys" season
that would make up for in excite
ment what it lacked in victories.
Saturday looked more like 1983's
1-10 season: no offense and no fun.
Can you say "boredom" boys and
girls? The Cardinal finished with
only 202 yards total offense and let
down a defense that was out to
atone for its absence the last three
weeks.

All in all, it was a good excuse to
bag some rays, pound some brews
and maybe bring along some West
ern Culture reading. Exciting foot
ball it was not.
The offense took the afternoon
off. "I think there was a subcon
scious feeling the we can just go out
there and score whenever we
want, roll up the yardage whenever
we want," quarterback John Paye
said.
UCLA proved that won't be the
case. After averaging 31 points and
492 yards in its first four games,
the Cardinal went flatter than bad
beer in a warm glass. When the
defense finally decided to resemble
a Pac-10 unit, the offense rushed
for seven — that's seven — yards.
The first problem obviously was
an injury-riddled offensive line.
Tackle Jeff Marchin and guard Tom
Nye were scratched from the

lineup, and a bunch of other nagging
bumps and bruises kept people out
of practice all week.
Unfortunately, no one's going to
show much mercy in a situation like
that, let alone a UCLA that had
memories of last year's 23-21 upset
in the Rose Bowl. What a young of
fensive line needs most is game ex
perience as a unit, and if it doesn't
get that, the result is Paye spend
ing an afternoon running away from
some rather large individuals intent
on doing him serious physical harm.
"There've been a lot of nagging
injuries, but that's no excuse,"
tackle John Barns said. "We've got
to do what we're doing, but do it
better."
The result: Paye went down
seven times, lost 55 yards and
couldn't take more than a three
step drop.
This led to the dink offense.
Paye's numbers were as impres
sive as usual, 31 completions in 45
attempts. The problem was only
182 yards. That's 5.9 yards per
completion. That's 4 yards per pass
play. That's your IM team on an off
day.
As Bruin coach Terry Donahue
said, "We went in there saying,
'Four-yard passes don't beat you.
Forty-yard bombs do.' "
And the Cardinal had no 40-yard
bombs. The longest play of the day
was a 17-yard pass to tight end
Greg Baty, who caught six balls for
another good day. Paye completed
only two passes to wide receivers
— a three-yarder to Jeff James and
an eight-yarder to Carl Morris, who
now has all of four catches in five
games.
Again this week, the leading


JOHN
LIS
receivers for the Cardinal
were Brian Morris, who had
12 catches in relief of the
injured Brad Muster, who
himself had six before having
to come out with a bruised
sternum and Baty. The loss
of Muster won't help the
Cardinal's game-breaking po
tential.
"We didn't tax them much
in the secondary," Coach Jack
Elway said.
A bright spot: The defense
came to play. Though
mistakes were apparent, they
weren't mistakes in defensive
technique. "The last couple of
weeks it was missed assign
ments," Cook said. "This
week it was more physical
mistakes."
Whether road tripping to
USC this weekend will be
worthwhile depends in large
part on whether the defense
can maintain its level of play.
If Muster and the line can
be healthy, the offense should
come to play. If not, well, a
sunny day in the L.A.
Coliseum beats the basement
of Green.

show much mercy in a situation like
that, let alone a UCLA that had
memories of last year's 23-21 upset
in the Rose Bowl. What a young of
fensive line needs most is game ex
perience as a unit, and if it doesn't
get that, the result is Paye spend
ing an afternoon running away from
some rather large individuals intent
on doing him serious physical harm.
"There've been a lot of nagging
injuries, but that's no excuse,"
tackle John Barns said. "We've got
to do what we're doing, but do it
better."
The result: Paye went down
seven times, lost 55 yards and
couldn't take more than a three
step drop.
This led to the dink offense.
Paye's numbers were as impres
sive as usual, 31 completions in 45
attempts. The problem was only
182 yards. That's 5.9 yards per
completion. That's 4 yards per pass
play. That's your IM team on an off
day.
As Bruin coach Terry Donahue
said, "We went in there saying,
'Four-yard passes don't beat you.
Forty-yard bombs do.' "
And the Cardinal had no 40-yard
bombs. The longest play of the day
was a 17-yard pass to tight end
Greg Baty, who caught six balls for
another good day. Paye completed
only two passes to wide receivers
— a three-yarder to Jeff James and
an eight-yarder to Carl Morris, who
now has all of four catches in five
games.
Again this week, the leading

receivers for the Cardinal
were Brian Morris, who had
12 catches in relief of the
injured Brad Muster, who
himself had six before having
to come out with a bruised
sternum and Baty. The loss
of Muster won't help the
Cardinal's game-breaking po
tential.
"We didn't tax them much
in the secondary," Coach Jack
Elway said.
A bright spot: The defense
came to play. Though
mistakes were apparent, they
weren't mistakes in defensive
technique. "The last couple of
weeks it was missed assign
ments," Cook said. "This
week it was more physical
mistakes."
Whether road tripping to
USC this weekend will be
worthwhile depends in large
part on whether the defense
can maintain its level of play.
If Muster and the line can
be healthy, the offense should
come to play. If not, well, a
sunny day in the L.A.
Coliseum beats the basement
of Green.
