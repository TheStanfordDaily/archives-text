ST. LOUIS (AP) — The St. Louis Cardinals,
shocked by a bizarre runaway tarpaulin accident that
felled Vince Coleman, rebounded with a record
setting 12-2 victory over Los Angeles last night be
hind the pitching of John Tudor. The victory evened
the National League playoffs at two games apiece.
Tito Landrum, Coleman's replacement in left
field, had a record-tying four singles and drove in
three runs in his first start in the playoffs.
Landrum, a playoff hero for Baltimore in 1983,
and Jack Clark set league playoff records with two
hits apiece in the Cardinals' nine-run second inning,
and Terry Pendleton drove in three runs in the in
ning. The Cardinals had eight hits in the inning, all
singles, and sent 14 men to the plate.
The Cardinals wound up with 15 hits that included
the four by Landrum, three more by Clark and two
apiece by Ozzie Smith and Cesar Cedeno. Clark also
scored three times.
Tudor, the loser in Game 1 at Los Angeles,
retired the first 14 Dodgers batters and had a no
hitter going until Steve Sax doubled to lead off the
sixth. Tudor, 21-8 during the season, allowed just
three hits, walked two and struck out five through
seven innings. He lost his shutout when Bill Madlock
led off the seventh with a home run.
The Cardinals, meanwhile, dispensed with
Dodgers starter Jerry Reuss in their big second in
ning, the second straight playoff game the Dodgers
failed to get a starting pitcher past the third inning.
The Cardinals KO'd Bob Welch in the third in
ning Saturday as they beat the Dodgers 4-2 in Game
3.
Coleman, who stole 110 bases during the season
and is a key element in the Cards breakaway of
fense, was injured about two hours before the
game. The accident occured as the grounds crew
prepared to cover the field in a light rain, using an
automatic, retractable system that rolls the tarp
over the infield on a long metal cylinder.
Coleman had trotted in from the outfield on his
way to the dugout, then turned to throw his glove to
a teammate when the mechanism was raised from
below ground level on the first-base side of
homeplate. The metal cylinder apparently rolled up
behind Coleman while he wasn't looking, knocked
him down and ran up his left leg, causing scrapes

and bruises.
Team physicians indicated that X-rays revealed
no broken bones.
KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Danny Jackson,
starting for the first time in 10 days, scattered eight
hits and the Kansas City Royals scrambled to a 2-0
victory over Toronto that trimmed the Blue Jays'
lead in the American League playoffs to 3-2.
The best-of-seven series shifts back to Toronto
for Game 6 tomorrow night, with the Blue Jays still
needing one victory to bring the World Series to
Canada for the first time.
Jackson, who last started on Oct. 3 and mopped
up with one scoreless inning in Game 1, was far
from perfect. But the left-hander, who struck out
six and walked one, was good enough when he had
to be in keeping the explosive Blue Jays off the
scoreboard.
Toronto put runners on second and third with no
outs in the fifth and loaded the bases with two outs
in the sixth. Both times, Jackson was equal to the
challenge.
The Royals, meanwhile, came out attacking
against Jimmy Key, who was hit hard in Game 2 and
wound up with a no-decision in a game Toronto
eventually won in 10 innings.
Kansas City scored once in the first inning on
George Brett' groundout, and got their second run
in the second on a sacrifice fly by Darryl Motley.
Some adventuresome baserunning helped the
Royals score both times.
Jackson had relatively little trouble through the
first three innings. He gave up a two-out double to
George Bell in the first, struck out the side in the
second and yielded a one-out single in the third to
Tony Fernandez.
The middle three innings were a different story
for the 24-year-old Jackson. Bell led off the fourth
with a single and Cliff Johnson followed with a single
to left. Bell tried to take third on the play as left
fielder Lonnie Smith had to wait for a high hop, but
Smith's throw to third got Bell.
The play was a close one, and Toronto Manager
Bobby Cox, who has seen several tough calls go
against his team, argued the decision with umpire
Dale Ford.

The Cardinals, meanwhile, dispensed with
Dodgers starter Jerry Reuss in their big second in
ning, the second straight playoff game the Dodgers
failed to get a starting pitcher past the third inning.
The Cardinals KO'd Bob Welch in the third in
ning Saturday as they beat the Dodgers 4-2 in Game
3.
Coleman, who stole 110 bases during the season
and is a key element in the Cards breakaway of
fense, was injured about two hours before the
game. The accident occured as the grounds crew
prepared to cover the field in a light rain, using an
automatic, retractable system that rolls the tarp
over the infield on a long metal cylinder.
Coleman had trotted in from the outfield on his
way to the dugout, then turned to throw his glove to
a teammate when the mechanism was raised from
below ground level on the first-base side of
homeplate. The metal cylinder apparently rolled up
behind Coleman while he wasn't looking, knocked
him down and ran up his left leg, causing scrapes

and bruises.
Team physicians indicated that X-rays revealed
no broken bones.
KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Danny Jackson,
starting for the first time in 10 days, scattered eight
hits and the Kansas City Royals scrambled to a 2-0
victory over Toronto that trimmed the Blue Jays'
lead in the American League playoffs to 3-2.
The best-of-seven series shifts back to Toronto
for Game 6 tomorrow night, with the Blue Jays still
needing one victory to bring the World Series to
Canada for the first time.
Jackson, who last started on Oct. 3 and mopped
up with one scoreless inning in Game 1, was far
from perfect. But the left-hander, who struck out
six and walked one, was good enough when he had
to be in keeping the explosive Blue Jays off the
scoreboard.
Toronto put runners on second and third with no
outs in the fifth and loaded the bases with two outs
in the sixth. Both times, Jackson was equal to the
challenge.
The Royals, meanwhile, came out attacking
against Jimmy Key, who was hit hard in Game 2 and
wound up with a no-decision in a game Toronto
eventually won in 10 innings.
Kansas City scored once in the first inning on
George Brett' groundout, and got their second run
in the second on a sacrifice fly by Darryl Motley.
Some adventuresome baserunning helped the
Royals score both times.
Jackson had relatively little trouble through the
first three innings. He gave up a two-out double to
George Bell in the first, struck out the side in the
second and yielded a one-out single in the third to
Tony Fernandez.
The middle three innings were a different story
for the 24-year-old Jackson. Bell led off the fourth
with a single and Cliff Johnson followed with a single
to left. Bell tried to take third on the play as left
fielder Lonnie Smith had to wait for a high hop, but
Smith's throw to third got Bell.
The play was a close one, and Toronto Manager
Bobby Cox, who has seen several tough calls go
against his team, argued the decision with umpire
Dale Ford.
