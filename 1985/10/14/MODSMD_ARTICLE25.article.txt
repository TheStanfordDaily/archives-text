# Control Passing KO'd
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
UCLA defensive tackle Mark Walen wasn't exactly
condescending when asked for his opinion of the Stan
ford offense that he had just helped shut down in the
Bruins' 34-9 victory Saturday. But he wasn't very
respectful, either.
"Yeah, on that first drive they looked like they were
world-beaters," said the 6-foot-5, 250-pound Walen,
standing with one foot nonchalantly up on a locker
room bench. "But if they were going to score on us,
they had to go to the 15- and 20-yard routes. And we
weren't going to give them that."
Walen and crew made it look as easy as it sounds.
Paye hit on eight straight passes on the first drive of
the game and wound up with 31 completions, but he
passed for only 182 yards, almost 200 less than his
season average.
"No, I'm not surprised (that Stanford threw short so
often)," Bruin quarterback David Norrie said. "That's
their offensive design. Many times it's successful, but
today they couldn't get things under control."
He stopped for a second. "Our design is to go
downfield," he said, and shrugged his shoulders,
smiling.
So why can UCLA go downfield, and not Stanford?
Why does Stanford have to throw short?
The answer lies where so many others in football do
— along the line of scrimmage. The Bruins were able
to put pressure on Paye with just three linemen and a
linebacker, which meant that they could keep enough

people back to protect against the long and inter
mediate pass routes.
If the Stanford offensive line could have given Paye
more time, he could have found receivers Jeff James
and Carl Morris more often. That would have forced
UCLA either to drop eight men back or send another
blitzer, and Paye would have had an easier time of it.
But the line didn't hold up, and Paye wound up get
ting sacked seven times, four times by Walen. He was
forced to go to a three-step drop early in the game,
which made downfield throws out of the question.
James and Morris finished the game with one reception
apiece, for a total of 11 yards.
"I wouldn't say we had a great day in the offensive
line," Cardinal Coach Jack Elway said. "We've had a se
ries of injuries in the line. They haven't been serious,
but they have had an effect."
They were serious enough that two starters — left
tackle Jeff Marchin (knee) and right guard Tom Nye
(ankle) — were scratched from the lineup and replaced
by Robbie Coffin and Guy Bunyard. Left guard Andy
Sinclair has struggled with an ankle sprain for a while
now, and the team's best offensive lineman, senior
John Barns, hasn't practiced for two weeks because of
turf toe.
Solutions aren't readily available. Against Oregon's
heavy blitz, Elway kept running backs in the backfield
in the second half, and Paye had more time to work
with. But blocking a four-man rush with six or seven
men makes for a lot of double coverage in the second
ary. Stanford's only real option Saturday was to throw
short.
And as UCLA showed, it's not much of an option.

John Paye. Waylen, a senior from Burlingame, notched four sacks while his teammates added
three more.
