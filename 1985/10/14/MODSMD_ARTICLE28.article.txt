# Spikers Sweep
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
In a period of one week the Stan
ford women's volleyball team dis
missed any notions that its No. 1
ranking was undeserved, and sent a
message to its closest contenders
that this year's Cardinal is out to
avenge last year's championship
game defeat.
No. 2 UCLA, No. 3 University of
Pacific and No. 4 San Jose State
each traveled confidently to Stan
ford, only to be buried in Maples
Mania — a combination of Cardinal
firepower on the court and enthusi
asm in the crowd. The latest and
most convincing victory came
Friday night as the Cardinal women
destroyed their Northern California
rivals from San Jose, 15-12, 15-5,
15-7.
The victory lifted Stanford's
record to 14-0 and dropped San
Jose to 13-3.
The key to defeating the Spar
tans was to take them out of their
game — one centered on emotions,
enthusiasm and the burning desire
to beat the Cardinal, whom they
believe receive more than their fare
share of publicity in this area.
"They're the kind of team that is
really up and down emotionally,"
Cardinal Co-Coach Don Shaw said.
After a close first game, though,
the Cardinal women shut the door
on the Spartan women, rarely
giving them cause to celebrate a
point and never allowing them to
capture the momentum.
Instead, the Cardinal women did
most of the celebrating along with a
crowd estimated at 2,400.
Stanford senior Kim Oden em
phasized the tremendous impact
that the crowd support has had on
the team. "It's fantastic," Oden
said. "It really makes us feel like
we're at home."
The first game resembled a
heavyweight boxing match as each
team struck with flurries but neither
was able to apply the quick knock
out punch. The game was tied on
five different occassions before the
Cardinal shrugged off the Spartans.
Theresa Smith converted a spike to
give Stanford a 14-12 lead, and at

game point the Spartans' Lisa Ice
hit an attempted spike wide to give
the Cardinal game one.
Games two and three were
never in doubt as all parts of the
Cardinal's game began to click at
once. "We really settled down in
the second and third games," Shaw
said. "We were ready to play much
more so than UOP."
The Cardinal women rattled off

eight straight points at the end of
the second game and four in a row
at the end of game three to wrap up
the match.
Throughout the match the Card
inal dominated the net play. "We
were able to run the offense," Shaw
said. "Their middle blockers were
following Kim (Oden) and that iso
lated Theresa (Smith)."
"I had the opportunity to use the

offensive threat," setter Wendi
Rush said. "In the past there's been
a block but tonight it was wide
open."
The Cardinal women have now
completed almost half of the 1985
schedule undefeated. But Oden
warns against any premature
celebration. "The season is going to
be very tough," she said. "It
already has been."
