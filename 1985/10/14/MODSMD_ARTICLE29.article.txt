# Card Soccer Routs USF 2-0
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
This one wasn't an upset.
Two teams played and the better
squad won. Last Friday, the
Stanford's women's soccer team
journeyed north and easily
defeated the University of San
Francisco 2-0.
It wasn't the Cardinal's pret
tiest game, but it didn't need to
be. "It was a rather sloppy
game, but we still dominated it,"
sophomore forward Jenny Hill
said.
This is the Dons' first year of
competition at the varsity level
of women's soccer and their in
experience was painfully ob
vious. Lacking the teamwork
and skills to play with the more
seasoned Cardinal, USF chose
to play physically.
Led by Terry Wheeler, their
top player, the Dons tried to
push Stanford all over the field,
but the intimidating tactics were
no substitute for experience and
skill.
The game started briskly with
both teams battling for posses
sion in the middle of the field.
But it didn't remain neutral for
long as the Cardinal gradually
began to show its stuff.
Ten minutes into the game
Stanford struck its first blow.
The Cardinal was awarded a free
kick and defender Carol Ber
ryman was called up to take the
shot.
Berryman wasted no time
sending the ball right past the
USF goalkeeper. The goal was
Berryman's second in as many
games.
The remainder of the first
half, as well as most of the
second half was fairly unevent
ful. Neither team could score as
the ball, for the most part,
remained in the center of the
field.
"Most of the time we were at
midfield pressing forward," Ber
ryman said.
Even though the lead didn't
widen, there was really no doubt

that the Cardinal was in control.
Stanford's always-tough
defense, which so far this season
has been the strength of the
team, had little trouble contain
ing the USF offense.
The Dons "made some little
surges, but Helen (Norton, the
Cardinal goalkeeper) didn't really
have much to do," senior
midfielder Cheryl Gustafson
said.
As the second half wore on,
the Dons' physical style became
more aggressive. "By the end of
the game they were really
frustrated," Berryman said.
That frustration and physical
play only worked to rejuvenate
the Stanford squad, which for
much of the second half had
played less than inspired ball. It
was a classic case of playing
down to the competition.
But halfway through the
second stanza, the Cardinal got a
little fed up with USF's brawling
style of play. Pushing it back into
high gear, Stanford once again
applied the pressure to the Dons
defense. And with about 15
minutes left the Cardinal scored
again.
Gustafson received the ball in
the open field and hammered it
into the USF net.
From Gustafson's goal to the
buzzer, Stanford continued to
dominate. "We didn't stop fight
ing, we were pressing hard to
the end of the game," Berryman
said.
The Cardinal was unable to
score again but the team's
barrage of shots on goal ended
the game in impressive fashion.
A definite confidence builder,
the win came at exactly the right
time for the Stanford squad. The
victory improved the team's
record to 4-5-1, but more impor
tantly it increased Cardinal
morale at one of the season's
pivotal points.
This week should be Stan
ford's toughest stretch of games
this year. The Cardinal will play
highly-rated Chico State on
tomorrow.
