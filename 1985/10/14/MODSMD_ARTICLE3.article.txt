# Prof.'s Creation Wins Nobel Peace Prize

Stanford Prof. Herbert Abrams, one of three
co-founders of International Physicians for the
Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW), saw his
group receive perhaps the highest honor possi
ble when it was awarded the 1985 Nobel Peace
Prize Friday.
The anti-nuclear group, which has a member
ship of more than 145,000 doctors and health
professionals, was honored for "considerable
service to mankind by spreading authoritative in
formation and by creating an awareness of the
catastrophic consequences of atomic warfare,"
the, Norwegian Nobel Committee said in its an
nouncement.
The committee also said the group's cam
paign was especially effective because its
respected scientific work has "contributed to an
increase in the pressure of public opposition to
the proliferation of the atomic weapons" result
ing in "greater attention being paid to health and
other humanitarian issues."
Abrams, who helped found the group in 1980,
is a Stanford Medical School professor and a
member of the University's interdisciplinary
Center for International Security and Arms Con
trol.
Gary Lapid, assistant professor of clinical psy
chiatry who recently accompanied Abrams on a
trip to the Soviet Union, described Abrams as an
"energetic, disciplined and compassionate" man

with a perspective "characterized by the quest
for truth."
The 65-year-old Abrams, who specializes in
cardiac radiology, began teaching at Stanford in
1951, where he was director of diagnostic radiol
ogy from 1960 to 1967 before accepting a posi
tion at Harvard University.

In 1979, Abrams and two colleagues from
Boston, Dr. Bernard Lown and Dr. James Mul
ler, originated the concept of an international
physicians group dedicated to averting nuclear
war.
Abrams told the San Francisco Examiner that
concern about his grandchildren's future
prompted his action. "In 1979, the rhetoric of
nuclear weapons scared the hell out of me,"
Abrams said. "As I began to learn about nuclear

weapons I realized my grandson might not be
able to enjoy the kind of life I do."
The main purpose of IPPNW is to educate
physicians and the public about the conse
quences of a nuclear war, and the awarding of
the Nobel Prize will make the message "that
much more compelling," Abrams said.
"It reflects the conviction that the organization
is bridging a gap between countries," Abrams
said. "Doctors are just doing the job doctors
should do."
A meeting of six Soviet and U.S. physicians in
Geneva formally chartered the organization in
1980, the same year Abrams returned to Stan
ford. At the Geneva meeting, Abrams and his
colleagues attempted to establish a method of
expressing their similar views despite conflicting
political systems.
At the 1980 meeting, the members hammered
out four guidelines for the group. They agreed to
restrict their focus to nuclear war, to work to
prevent such a conflict (in keeping with profes
sional vows to protect life and preserve health),
to circulate the same factual information and to
avoid taking positions on specific policies of any
government.
Esil Aarvik, chairman of the five-person Nobel
Peace Prize selection panel, said "particular im
portance" was placed on the fact the organization
evolved out of a joint initiative of medical profes
sionals in the Soviet Union and United States.
Aarvik, a former president of the Swedish par
liament, said the cooperation shown by medical
