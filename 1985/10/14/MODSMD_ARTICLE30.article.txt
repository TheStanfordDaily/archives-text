# Polo Beats Bruins, Loses to UC-Irvine
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff writer 
After losing three consecutive matches,
there was no place for the Stanford water
polo team to go but up. In Saturday's match
against UCLA, the Cardinal didn't just go up,
it went all the way to the top, upsetting the
No. 2 Bruins 9-5.
The Cardinal's victory not only ended a
three-game losing streak that included
Friday's 4-3 loss to UC-Irvine, but it placed
the Cardinal in a leading position in the Pac-10
Conference.
"We came out smoking against UCLA and
never let up," coach Dante Dettamanti said.
"The fact that UCLA had defeated Cal the
day before 7-5 made the victory all the more
valuable, putting us in the top position in the
league."
UCLA and California each have one league
loss while Stanford is 1-0 and USC has not
yet played a league match. Although it has
not yet been determined, it is highly probable
that the Cardinal will move into the No. 1 or
No, 2 spot in this week's rankings.
The Cardinal, ranked third after its two
losses in the Nor Cal Tournament, was
severely pressed after Friday's loss to Irvine.

"After Friday's loss I will admit we were a
bit concerned, but we certainly were not
about to panic," Dettamanti said. "We
assesed what we were doing wrong, talked
about what we needed to do and set our
sights for UCLA.
"Our major problem was a basic lack of ag
gressiveness. We simply were not coming
out strong from the start or going for the fast
breaks. Also, most of the team was relying
on (David) Imbernino, (Jaime) Velez and
(Craig) Klass to do all the scoring, and they
just weren't."
In Saturday's match, they certainly were.
Imbernino led the Cardinal with four goals,
followed by Velez with three and Klass and
Chris Thompson with one apiece.
"Our leading scorers came out strong, but
if they hadn't been scoring, other players
would have, " Dettamanti said. "The whole
team virtually 'came out' of its slump. When
the entire team is aggresive, it tends to open
up the whole game for our top scorers."
Scoring against UCLA was certainly no
easy task, judging from the action in the
water. Putting it lightly, the overall play was
"quite rough" according to Dettamanti.
"Quite rough" doesn't even start to tell the
story.

"Both teams were playing hard and it is
only natural to have some rough play going
on, but there were so many fouls going on un
der water it was ridiculous," Dettamanti said.
"UCLA has three Brazilian Olympic players
who are used to playing down in South
America and haven't yet learned how to play
North American water polo.
"I thought our players handled the situation
very well. It's pretty tough to keep cool when

people are pulling at your cap and kicking you
every other second."
It is also pretty tough to keep cool when
you're a freshman goalie playing against the
No. 2 team in the nation, but Todd Kemp
didn't have any trouble.
"Todd played his best game this season, by
far," Dettamanti said. "He positioned himself
well for every shot and had at least a dozen
superior saves. "
