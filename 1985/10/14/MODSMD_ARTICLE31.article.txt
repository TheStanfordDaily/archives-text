# OT Goal Lifts Hockey Past Cal
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Saturday afternoon, in their
second home game of the season,
the Stanford field hockey team won
its second straight game, beating
UC-Berkeley 1-0 in double
overtime. The game could have
been over at the end of regulation if
the Cardinal, which controlled the
action, had capitalized on its many
opportunities.
"We definitely dominated the
game," junior midfielder Andi Wol
pert said.
Don't just take her word for it,
look at the statistics. Stanford's

shot total for the game was 35 to
Cal's 12. Bear goalie Kim Haas
made 13 saves; Cardinal
goalkeeper Karen Jones had to
make only four.
Contrary to the opinion of Wol
pert and many of her teammates,
and contrary to the statistics, Cali
fornia Head Coach Donna Fong felt
the game was evenly played. "I
don't think that Stanford necessar
ily outplayed us by any means,"
Fong said.
The game winner was scored by
Maree Chung with 3:07 left in the
second 10-minute overtime. The
sequence which led to the goal was
a perfect example of what the team
had been trying unsuccessfully to

do all game. "It was exactly the play
that if we can convert on we should
be scoring a lot of goals," Assistant
Coach Jen Blakely said.
According to Blakely, the idea is
to get as many shots "on the
goalie's pads" as possible, even if
their chances of actually getting by
the keeper are small. Once the ball
is in the cage area, it is the for
wards' job to beat the defense to
the ball and knock it in.
In the case of Saturday's goal,
the low percentage shot was taken
by Andi Wolpert. It was a powerful
drive from about 35 yards out that
appeared at first to have gotten by
Haas. In fact, many of the Stanford

players and most of the fans started
to celebrate. "We're like jumping up
and down, and then, 'Oh no!'"
senior defenseman Lisa Stewart
said.
One Cardinal who stayed in con
trol was senior Lisa Jacobsen. "The
coaches are always telling us that
the forwards should follow the shot
all the way, so that's what I did,"
Jacobsen said.
Her persistence paid off. Wol
pert's shot came off the inside left
post right to the stick of Jacobsen.
Her flick glanced off Haas' pads into
the crowd which had gathered
waiting for a rebound. Chung won
the battle for the ball and scored.
