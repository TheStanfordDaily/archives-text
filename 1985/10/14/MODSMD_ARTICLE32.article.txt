### 
Though there were some tense
moments, the Stanford sailing team
emerged victorious this weekend at
the Northern California Sloop
Eliminations hosted by the Cardinal
in Monterey.
By placing first in the event, the
Stanford team earned an invitation
to the NCAA finals to be held next
month on UC-Irvine's home "turf,"
Newport Beach. The Cardinal will
surely face some tough competition
there.
But in Monterey, everything
went Stanford's way. In the first of
five races, the Cardinal breezed to
victory. As it turned out, that per
formance was an omen.
There must have been some
doubters, however, after the Cali
fornia Maritime Academy stormed
back to capture the second and
third races and with them the lead.
"But we came back and took con
trol at the end," Coach Joe Petrucci
said. Indeed, the Cardinal took both
th* 1 fourth and fifth races.
