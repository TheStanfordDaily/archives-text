# Men in Southland

The Cardinal men's golf team is in Southern California today to
play in the Southwestern Intercollegiate in Thousand Oaks. The
question is whether or not the squad will round into form, or con
tinue to be plagued by inconsistency.
While Stanford placed a respectable fourth in its last tournament,
the Japan-America Friendship, it was hampered by the inability of in
dividual golfers to put good rounds together.
Phil Rowley, for example, played excellently in the first two
rounds of the tournament, posting a combined score of 150.
However, he fell off that pace in the final round of play.
Conversely, Rich Marik put together back-to-back scores of 72 in
the last two rounds of the Friendship but only after a disappointing
first round of 81. Last year, eight of the nation's top 10 teams
played in this event, and Stanford's fifth-place finish was the best in
school history.
"The tournament coming up is a hazard," Schaaf said. "The com
petition is going to be much tougher than what we've faced before.
"We're getting readier each week," he said. "I think we have the
abilitv to do well."
