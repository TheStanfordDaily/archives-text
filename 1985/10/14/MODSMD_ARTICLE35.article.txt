Bush in China, Stresses Trade
PEKING — Vice President George Bush began a six-day visit to
China yesteray by saying that the United States now considers this
country primarily as an economic partner rather than as a partner in
strategic efforts against the Soviet Union.
In a banquet toast at the Great Hall of the People soon after his ar
rival in Peking, Bush dwelt almost exclusively on the subject of U.S.
trade and investment in China and omitted any reference to the So
viet Union or to Asian security issues.
It was apparently the first time in the series of visits dating back to
1972 that a U.S. president or vice president coming here has avoided
a public effort to enlist China's support against the Soviet Union.
On his last trip here in 1982, Bush told Premier Zhao Ziyang in a
banquet toast that China and the United States share "a common in
terest in the face of hegemonist expansionism" — an obvious refer
ence to the Soviet Union. In his welcoming toast at the banquet
yesterday night, Zhao told Bush that China "unswervingly pursues
an independent foreign policy of peace."
"We do not enter into alliance with any big power or group of
countries," Zhao said. "We stand for pacific settlement of interna
tional disputes through negotiations and consultations."
Bush said that U.S. direct investment in China had reached $700
million, and he said that there was still "clearly great potential for ex
panding our bilateral economic ties."
Many Boycott Polish Vote
WARSAW, Poland — The Polish government yesteray claimed to
have won a broad popular mandate in its first parliamentary elections
in five years, although many people, including the majority of the in
fluential Roman Catholic clergy, apparently refused to vote.
As the polls clbsed at 10 p.m., a government spokesman said the
number of voters would exceed the 75 percent turnout at nationwide
local elections last year.
"This . . . constitutes public approval of our policy, "spokesman
Jerzy Urban said. "It boils down to acceptance by a vast majority of
the society of the stability and the moral and social values of our
socialist system."
In a reference to Solidarity's preelection call for a boycott, Urban
declared, "the boycott has been boycotted."
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa immediately disputed Urban's fig
ures. He said that more than half the electorate in the Baltic city of
Gdansk stayed home, along with many workers elsewhere in the
country. Walesa and the Roman Catholic primate, Cardinal Josef
Glemp, who is on a visit to Rome, were among the most prominent
figures not voting.
Urban acknowledged that a "majority" of the Catholic clergy
boycotted the election. While calling Walesa's figures "totally ficti
cious," Urban confirmed that voter turnout in Gdansk, where the
outlawed Solidarity trade union was born five years ago, was below
the national average.
With polls open until 10 p.m., final results will not be announced
until today.
Opposition Meets With ANC
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — White opposition legislators
and exiled black guerrilla chiefs said yesterday that their meeting had
produced agreement on "the urgent need to dismantle apartheid and
establish a united, non-racial, democratic South Africa." But they
said they disagreed on how to do it.
A joint statement issued by leaders of the opposition Progressive
Federal Party and executives of the outlawed African National
Congress described a "friendly and cordial atmosphere" in nine
hours of talks in Lusaka, Zambia.
The statement reported differences of opinion on the roles of
armed struggle and negotiation in bringing about change.
The ANC has said it plans to step up a campaign of violence to un
dermine white-minority rule. The Progressive Federal Party
opposes the use of force. The PFP is seeking to arrange a national
convention on South Africa's future, but the statement said the ANC
did not see "at the present moment a climate under which the ANC
could consider a negotiated resolution of the crisis."
The meeting was the second attempt in a month by whites outside
the government to directly involve the ANC, which says it has the
support of most of South Africa's blacks, in talks on the country's
prolonged crisis.
The governing National Party government refuses to talk with the
ANC unless it renounces violence, a condition it rejects.
Thfc statement by the legislators and the ANC said both groups
favored the release of political prisoners including former ANC
leader Nelson Mandela, who is serving a life sentence for plotting
sabotage. President P.W. Botha has said he will release the popular
black leader only if he renounces violence, something Mandela
refuses to do.
TASS Rips Reagan Accusation
MOSCOW— The Soviet news agency TASS countercharged Sun
day that President Reagan resorted to deception when he accused
the Kremlin of concealing work on its own version of a space-based
missile defense program.
In an unusually rapid response to the president's Saturday radio
address accusing Moscow of a "dangerous deception" on the issue,
Tass belittled Reagan's words as more "pattling" scare talk.
The president said the Soviet Union had 10,000 scientists and en
gineers working on a project that could put an anti-missile system in
space by the year 2000 but would not admit they had any strategic
defense program at all.
While the TASS report did not specifically deny that the Soviet
Union has been working on a new space weapons system, it said:
"It is well known that the Soviet Union proposed at the initial
stages of the Geneva talks that a moratorium be introduced on the
development, including the research, testing and deployment of
strike space weapons. The United States rejected these proposals."
Belgians Re-Elect Coalition
BRUSSELS, Belgium — Belgium's governing center-right coali
tion parties under Prime Minister Witfried Martens won a comforta
ble election victory yesterday in an unusual national vote for stability
in what is probably the most complex political democracy in Europe.
The election outcome also appears finally to settle the question of
deployment of American cruise missiles in Belgium under the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization agreement of 1979. The Martens gov
ernment brought the first 16 of a planned 48 missiles into the country
last March to an air base in Wallonia. The Flemish Socialists cam
paigned hard against any further missile deployment, but the issue
failed notably to dent the coalition majority.
