# U.S. Assails Italy's Release of Palestinian
## Terrorist in Yugoslavia; Craxi government may fall 
### 
ROME — The United States
yesterday delivered what Italian of
ficials called a "firm and severe"
protest over Italy's refusal to detain
a high Palestine Liberation Organi
zation official sought for extradition
to the United States, adding to the
strains on Italian-American rela
tions in the aftermath of last week's
hijacking of the Achille Lauro.
The dispute between Rome and
Washington over Italy's decision to
allow PLO leader Mohammed Ab
bas to leave the country Saturday
before a U.S. arrest warrant could
be served, appeared to be setting
the stage for a major crisis within
the five-party coalition government
of Prime Minister Bettino Craxi.
In Belgrade, Yugoslav officials
made no official comment about the
status of Abbas, who arrived there
Saturday night after Italian authori
ties spirited him aboard a Yugoslav
airliner at an airport near Rome.
But FBI Director William
Webster said Yugoslavia has
"declined to detain" Abbas, who
was briefly in Italian custody after
he and four accused hijackers were
caught aboard an Egyptian airliner
that was diverted to Sicily by U.S.
Navy jets on Thursday.
U.S. officials, noting Yugoslavia's
close ties with the Palestine Libera
tion Organization, acknowledged
that they have little hope that
Yugoslavia will hold him until the

United States can request his ex
tradition.
Reports from Belgrade quoted a
Yugoslav government spokesman,
who declined to be identified, as
saying, "We have good relations
with the PLO, and we support the
Palestinian cause. You can draw
your own conclusions."
That indicated that the United
States probably will be frustrated in
its efforts to prosecute Abbas,
whom it has called "one of the most
notorious Palestinian terrorists,"
for his alleged role in planning and
controlling the hijacking of the
cruise ship Achille Lauro last Mon
day. An American citizen was shot
to death before the four hijackers
surrendered to Egyptian authori
ties.
The Administration's determined
pursuit of the hijackers has brought
the United States into actual or po
tential conflict with three countries
— Egypt, Italy and Yugoslavia —
since Thursday night when U.S.
Navy fighters intercepted the
Egyptian jetliner and forced it to
land in Sicily. In addition to the four
hijackers, the Egyptian plane was
carrying Abbas and another uniden
tified Palestinian, who the Egyptian
government said had acted as
mediators in arranging the sur
render of the four. The
whereabouts of the unidentified
Palestinian was not known.

U.S. displeasure with Craxi's
handling of its request for Abbas'
arrest pending a request for ex
tradition was expressed yesterday
by U.S. Ambassador Maxwell Rabb
during a two-and-one-half-hour
meeting with Italian Foreign Mini
ster Giulio Andreotti. Italian offi
cials later described the protest as
"firm and severe."
"Foreign Minister Andreotti and I
had a long discussion," Rabb told
newsmen later. "I pointed out that
it is incomprehensible to the gov
ernment of the United States and to
the people of the United States how
Abu Abbas (his PLO code name)
could be permitted to leave Italy."
Abbas, the leader of a faction of a
PLO splinter group called the
Palestine Liberation Front (PLF)

and a member of the PLO's execu
tive committee, was one of two
PLO officials brought to Italy with
the four hijackers of the Italian liner
Achille Lauro after U.S. Navy jets
intercepted a chartered Egyptian
jet carrying them from Egypt to
Tunisia.
The four hijackers were arrested
Friday by Italian authorities after a
showdown between Italian police
and U.S. military officials at the
joint U.S.-Italian NATO naval air
base at Sigonella, Sicily, where the
intercepted Egyptian airliner was
forced to land.
U.S. officials had hoped to trans
fer the suspected hijackers — and
apparently the PLO officials in
whose custody they were — and fly
them to the United States, but the
Italian government insisted that
they should stay in Italy to be tried
because the hijacking and the mur
der of a U.S. passenger had been
carried out on an Italian ship, and
thus on Italian territory.
Italian Foreign Ministry officials
explained yesterday that Abbas had
been allowed to leave Italy because
Italian officials did not find convinc
ing the U.S. evidence of his alleged
complicity in the hijacking.
"The Americans had asked the
Italian government to hold Mr. Ab
bas. We maintain that we made a
complete analysis of the request," a
Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
