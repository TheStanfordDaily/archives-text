# Baker: Defense Cuts May Be Necessary
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Treasury Secretary James
Baker 111 said yesterday an Administration
backed deficit reduction plan now before
Congress could work without tax increases but
may require cutbacks in defense spending plans.
House and Senate negotiators plan to begin
work this week on a Senate-passed plan to
gradually cut deficits to zero by fiscal 1991. It
was approved overwhelmingly in the Senate last
week, and the House endorsed the idea, but
even the plan's supporters questioned whether
the plan can stop the flood of government red
ink.
Baker said he thought it could.
"I think, given the political will to make the
hard choices, you can reach balance without
having to raise taxes," Baker said on NBC-TV's
Meet the Press. "Clearly, there would have to
be reductions in defense.

"One of the first things I think we'd do is to
phase revenue sharing out this year instead of
next," as the Administration proposed, but
Congress rejected. "We would kill Amtrak. We
can't afford to maintain Amtrak," he said.
The Republican-led Senate last week ap
proved setting deficit targets and requiring
spending cuts to be carried out by the president
if Congress and the president failed to meet
those goals. However, Social Security, interest
on the national debt, and prior government con
tracts were exempted from the cuts, so only
about half the federal budget would be touched.
President Reagan has said his "personal ca
veat" was also to exempt defense spending from
the plan. He said Congress had a commitment to
its budget plan for keeping defense increases
current with inflation this fiscal year, and in
creasing it 3 percent above inflation the next two

fiscal years.
That position contrasted with statements by
the deficit plan's sponsors, Sens. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, Warren Rudman, R-N.H., and Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., who said the cuts must be
across-the-board for it to be successful.
"But I think the president must have taken
that into consideration when he embraced the
proposal. Deficit reduction is extremely impor
tant, " Baker said.
The automatic spending cuts in the plan would
take effect only after Congress' normal budget
process has failed to meet the deficit targets. To
reach the goals, spending could be cut or taxes
could be raised, or both.
The House Friday overwhelmingly approved a
resolution supporting the goal of a rigid timetable
for deficit reduction. But even supporters were
skeptical.
