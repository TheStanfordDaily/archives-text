Gun Survey Released
WASHINGTON — Only about one in five
convicted felons surveyed by the government
said they obtained their guns through
legitimate channels such as retail stores, the
Justice Department said yesterday.
A survey of 1,874 imprisoned felons in 11 in
stitutions found that criminals much more fre
quently steal their guns or get them from
relatives or friends, the department's National
Institute of Justice said.
The findings were cited by a spokesman for
the National Rifle Association as further
evidence against the effectiveness of stringent
gun registration and licensing controls.
A spokesman for the National Coalition to
Ban Handguns said he had no quarrel with the
study's conclusion, but that his organization in
sists handguns must be outlawed.
A key conclusion found that among the
sources of guns obtained by criminals, 44 per
cent either were purchased or otherwise ob
tained from relatives and friends, 26 percent
from the "black market," 21 percent from

retail outlets and 9 percent from a variety of il
legitimate means.
Atom Smasher Tested
WASHINGTON — Physicists at the Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago
succeeded yesterday in operating a newly
upgraded $300-million atom smasher that is
the world's most powerful device of its kind.
It is expected to probe deeper into the ul
timate nature of matter than anyone has ever
gone before.
The success, which was met with
champagne-drenched jubilation and a flurry of
telegrams to notify scientific colleagues around
the world, came after seven years of construc
tion and more than a month of round-the-clock
efforts to make the device run properly.
"It finally happened, as usual, at 3 in the
morning. It was very tricky, getting all this
equipment to work just right, but we did it. We
got some very spectacular collisions," said
Leon Lederman, director of the lab, called

Fermilab. "We're looking forward to a period
of fantastic discoveries."
Fermilab's machine, which creates its con
centrated energy by hurling particles of sub
atomic matter at other particles moving in the
opposite direction, is the world's most power
ful particle collider.
School Prayer Poll
NEW YORK — While many Americans have
made it clear they favor a return of prayer to
the classroom, a surprising number — 25 per
cent — say they think the separation of reli
gion and government, a pillar of the Constitu
tion, is a bad idea.
That was one of the findings when 1,412
people were surveyed in a Media General-
Associated Press poll on school prayer.
The poll found that support for silent prayer
in American schools is widespread, with large
majorities supporting it in every age, race,
economic and political group.
