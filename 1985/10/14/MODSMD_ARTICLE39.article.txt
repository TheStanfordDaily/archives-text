Aid Flown to Mexico
LOS ANGELES — A cargo plane loaded
with $500,000 worth of supplies for victims in
earthquake-devastated Mexico left Los An
geles International Airport yesterday, or
ganizers said.
The DC-10 cargo plane was filled with
140,000 pounds of medical and other supplies
intended for the American-British Hospital,
the General Hospital of Mexico City, the Uni
versity of Anahuac and the Mexican Red
Cross, said Richard Walden, spokesman for
Operation California.
The relief group coordinated the airlift of
tents, blankets and surgical goods donated by
hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, camping

and bedding firms and individuals, Walden said.
Federal Express provided the plane and
McDonnell Douglas Corp. paid for the fuel.
Flying Tiger Lines Inc. loaded the supplies.
Walden said 300,000 people were left home
less after two quakes struck Sept. 19 and 20.
The government put the death toll at 4,600, al
though news reports have said as many as
8,000 people may have died.
Eight planeloads of goods have been sent by
the Los Angeles-based group from Texas, he
said.
'Artificial Blood'
SAN FRANCISCO — A new artificial blood
substitute has shown promising results in

animal experiments and may eventually signifi
cantly reduce transmission of human blood
borne diseases such as AIDS, a researcher
says.
The substitute "appears to be the first artifi
cial blood product that successfully imitates
red blood cells in delivering oxygen to tissue,"
research scientist Ljubomir Djordjevich said in
a paper to be presented today to the American
Society of Anesthesiologists.
In addition, he said, the substitute can be
stored up to six months, compared to 21 days
for natural blood, and can be given to people
with different blood types, which could save
time and lives in emergencies.
