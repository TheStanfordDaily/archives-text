# Old Band Members Never Die
## 
### CHRIS MYERS 
They came from as far away as
New York City and from as far back
in time as the Class of '48. They left
medical and law offices and came
bearing musical instruments. They
came back to Stanford, answering
the call of the wild, answering the
call to come join "The World's Larg
.est Rock and Roll Band."
The occasion was the "Old Fart
Reunion," this weekend's gathering
of over 200 former members of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band ("Old farts," as cur
rent Band members call them),
along with some 50 Dollies
representing four decades of foot
ball entertainment history.
The focal point of the weekend
was the alumni Band's appearance
at halftime during the UCLA foot
ball game in a joint show with the
present LSJUMB. But the mere
gathering of this huge group of
former and present "incom
parables" was an event in itself.
The reunion was the brainchild of
Scott Gode, the Band's current

manager. There have been many
Band reunions on varying scales in
past years, but an alumni Band
never performed on the field
before.
Gode recruited junior Phil Cline,
the Band's archivist and historian,
to help with the logistics of the
event.
Cline began his search in the
Registrar's Office, where he found
records of students who were en
rolled in band classes over the past
30 years. He then went to the Of
fice of Development, where Uni
versity staffer Bart Bartosh helped
him track down the current ad
dresses of the Band alumni.
The first mailing went out in the
middle of August, and the response
"exceeded all expectations," ac
cording to Cline. Officially, 210 "old
farts" said they would be coming.
Meanwhile, Didi Justin, a Dollie
during the 1980-81 school year,
began organizing the alumni Dollie
squad. With the help of two other
former Dollies, Melinda Myers and
Elena (Camacho) Beyers, she
started making phone calls.

The Band beat goes on through the years as drummers — pres
ent and past — demonstrated audibly at Saturday s football
game, which featured a reunion of 200 past Band members and
50 former Dollies.
"It just ballooned," she said.
"My phone bill is immense."
Over 50 ex-Dollies and song
leaders (as they were called
before 1964) agreed to return.
One was a song leader in 1948.
Another, Pat (Siler) Lowe was
a song leader in 1954-55, and was
joined on the field Staurday by her
daughter, Stanford junior and
1984-85 Dollie Kathy Lowe.
In all, at least six of the years
were represented by all five of
their respective Dollies, and there
was at least one Dollie from al
most every year since 1964.
The response from both Dollies
and former Band members was so
great that it became "kind of a
nightmare" for Cline, as he tried
to "scramble around" the Palo
Alto area to find enough instru
ments for the alums.
He borrowed from local high
schools and music stores, but still
"couldn't find enough instruments
to make everyone happy."
The musicians and Dollies
began arriving on Friday after
noon, when the first field rehear
sal was held on Angell Field.
Instruments were distributed,
along with custom-designed com
memorative red T-shirts.
The shirts featured a stencil of
Band jacket lapels and clashing tie
on the front and an "Old Fart
Reunion" logo on the back.
That first rehearsal was a time
to get reacquainted with former
Bandmates and to remember old
times.
"We're just all so psyched," said
Melinda Myers, a 1983-83 Dollie.
"A lot of the squads haven't seen
each other in five or 10 years."
"I see a lot of familiar faces, but
the only names (and legs) I re
member are the Dollies'," said

Tom Myers, who played tenor
saxophone and graduated in 1977.
"This is great fun," said Monty
Bossard, Class of '75, a Seattle
lawyer. "The weird thing is, you
see these young kids, then you
find out they're alumni."
Clare Carlson, a Palo Alto
lawyer who graduated from Stan
ford in 1979 and is now one of
several old farts who play regu
larly with the current Band,
struck a different note.
"I'm amazed at how few people
I know here," she said. "It seems
like this event was aimed at

people from the Class of '80 or
earlier, and we ended up with a lot
of people from the Rose Bowl
years (1971 and 1972, when Stan
ford went to consecutive Rose
Bowls) and not too many from my
time."
Indeed, the reunion drew many
Bandsmen (the Band didn't turn
coed until 1973) from those Rose
Bowl Bands of the early 70s. Bos
sard was one of them, and he
remembered the time with fond
ness.
"It was just fun to be in the
Rose Bowl," he said. "The Uni

versity of Michigan band was so
straight. In fact, they had an ex-
Marine as director. During the
Rose Parade, of course, we were
waving and yelling at people."
Bossard also remembered
some Band history in the making.
"I think it was during those Rose
Bowl years that 'All Right Now'
became the theme song," he said.
"And I believe the 1972 Rose
Bowl was when we first did the
jump in 'All Right Now.' "

Fifty former Dollies from as long ago as 1948 proved the saying that "Old Dollies never die,

were familiar with "All Right Now,"
but some of the alums dated not
only that song, but also the Band in
its present incarnation.
Some of the old farts think the
Band has mellowed since the time
they were in it.
Tom Myers called the present
Band "very tame" compared to the
Band of his years. "That's just in
dicative of the change in times," he
said. "It seems like the atmosphere
is more studious. When I was in the
Band, we partied more, cared less
about grades and more about
people and life."
At one point, a group of old farts
directed a yell at this year's Dollies:
"Hey Dollies, where were you
before we got married?" Dollie
Arija Bareikis quickly shot back,
"We weren't born yet."
There was some concern —
wholly justified — about what
would result when 400 past and
present Band members and Dollies,
in varying and dubious degrees of
sobriety, tumbled onto the field to
gether.
With that many people on the
field at once, the "scatters" be
tween formations became collision
fraught traffic jams, and many Band
mambers ran gingerly, with instru
ments clutched protectively to their
chests. No thanks to local Bud
weiser distributors, the rehearsals
and the actual show came off with
out major injury.
For most of these old farts, it
was that chance to "do it all over
again" that brought them back to
Stanford.
Manager Scott Gode had no
doubts about the reunion's future.
"A lot of people derived a tremen
dous amount of happiness from it.
The enthusiasm and just the sound
of the Band were amazing," he
said. "It will happen again."

dous amount of happiness from it.
The enthusiasm and just the sound
of the Band were amazing," he
said. "It will happen again."
They came from as far away as
New York City and from as far back
in time as the Class of '48. They left
medical and law offices and came
bearing musical instruments. They
came back to Stanford, answering
the call of the wild, answering the
call to come join "The World's Larg
.est Rock and Roll Band."
The occasion was the "Old Fart
Reunion," this weekend's gathering
of over 200 former members of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band ("Old farts," as cur
rent Band members call them),
along with some 50 Dollies
representing four decades of foot
ball entertainment history.
The focal point of the weekend
was the alumni Band's appearance
at halftime during the UCLA foot
ball game in a joint show with the
present LSJUMB. But the mere
gathering of this huge group of
former and present "incom
parables" was an event in itself.
The reunion was the brainchild of
Scott Gode, the Band's current

manager. There have been many
Band reunions on varying scales in
past years, but an alumni Band
never performed on the field
before.
Gode recruited junior Phil Cline,
the Band's archivist and historian,
to help with the logistics of the
event.
Cline began his search in the
Registrar's Office, where he found
records of students who were en
rolled in band classes over the past
30 years. He then went to the Of
fice of Development, where Uni
versity staffer Bart Bartosh helped
him track down the current ad
dresses of the Band alumni.
The first mailing went out in the
middle of August, and the response
"exceeded all expectations," ac
cording to Cline. Officially, 210 "old
farts" said they would be coming.
Meanwhile, Didi Justin, a Dollie
during the 1980-81 school year,
began organizing the alumni Dollie
squad. With the help of two other
former Dollies, Melinda Myers and
Elena (Camacho) Beyers, she
started making phone calls.

The Band beat goes on through the years as drummers — pres
ent and past — demonstrated audibly at Saturday s football
game, which featured a reunion of 200 past Band members and
50 former Dollies.
"It just ballooned," she said.
"My phone bill is immense."
Over 50 ex-Dollies and song
leaders (as they were called
before 1964) agreed to return.
One was a song leader in 1948.
Another, Pat (Siler) Lowe was
a song leader in 1954-55, and was
joined on the field Staurday by her
daughter, Stanford junior and
1984-85 Dollie Kathy Lowe.
In all, at least six of the years
were represented by all five of
their respective Dollies, and there
was at least one Dollie from al
most every year since 1964.
The response from both Dollies
and former Band members was so
great that it became "kind of a
nightmare" for Cline, as he tried
to "scramble around" the Palo
Alto area to find enough instru
ments for the alums.
He borrowed from local high
schools and music stores, but still
"couldn't find enough instruments
to make everyone happy."
The musicians and Dollies
began arriving on Friday after
noon, when the first field rehear
sal was held on Angell Field.
Instruments were distributed,
along with custom-designed com
memorative red T-shirts.
The shirts featured a stencil of
Band jacket lapels and clashing tie
on the front and an "Old Fart
Reunion" logo on the back.
That first rehearsal was a time
to get reacquainted with former
Bandmates and to remember old
times.
"We're just all so psyched," said
Melinda Myers, a 1983-83 Dollie.
"A lot of the squads haven't seen
each other in five or 10 years."
"I see a lot of familiar faces, but
the only names (and legs) I re
member are the Dollies'," said

Tom Myers, who played tenor
saxophone and graduated in 1977.
"This is great fun," said Monty
Bossard, Class of '75, a Seattle
lawyer. "The weird thing is, you
see these young kids, then you
find out they're alumni."
Clare Carlson, a Palo Alto
lawyer who graduated from Stan
ford in 1979 and is now one of
several old farts who play regu
larly with the current Band,
struck a different note.
"I'm amazed at how few people
I know here," she said. "It seems
like this event was aimed at

people from the Class of '80 or
earlier, and we ended up with a lot
of people from the Rose Bowl
years (1971 and 1972, when Stan
ford went to consecutive Rose
Bowls) and not too many from my
time."
Indeed, the reunion drew many
Bandsmen (the Band didn't turn
coed until 1973) from those Rose
Bowl Bands of the early 70s. Bos
sard was one of them, and he
remembered the time with fond
ness.
"It was just fun to be in the
Rose Bowl," he said. "The Uni

versity of Michigan band was so
straight. In fact, they had an ex-
Marine as director. During the
Rose Parade, of course, we were
waving and yelling at people."
Bossard also remembered
some Band history in the making.
"I think it was during those Rose
Bowl years that 'All Right Now'
became the theme song," he said.
"And I believe the 1972 Rose
Bowl was when we first did the
jump in 'All Right Now.' "

Some of the old farts think the

Tom Myers called the present

said. "It seems like the atmosphere

At one point, a group of old farts
directed a yell at this year's Dollies:
"Hey Dollies, where were you

Arija Bareikis quickly shot back,

There was some concern —
wholly justified — about what
would result when 400 past and
present Band members and Dollies,
in varying and dubious degrees of
sobriety, tumbled onto the field to
gether.
With that many people on the
field at once, the "scatters" be
tween formations became collision
fraught traffic jams, and many Band
mambers ran gingerly, with instru
ments clutched protectively to their
chests. No thanks to local Bud
weiser distributors, the rehearsals
and the actual show came off with
