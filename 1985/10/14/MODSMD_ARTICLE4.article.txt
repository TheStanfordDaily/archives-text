# Old Band Members Never Die
## 
### CHRIS MYERS 
They came from as far away as
New York City and from as far back
in time as the Class of '48. They left
medical and law offices and came
bearing musical instruments. They
came back to Stanford, answering
the call of the wild, answering the
call to come join "The World's Larg
.est Rock and Roll Band."
The occasion was the "Old Fart
Reunion," this weekend's gathering
of over 200 former members of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band ("Old farts," as cur
rent Band members call them),
along with some 50 Dollies
representing four decades of foot
ball entertainment history.
The focal point of the weekend
was the alumni Band's appearance
at halftime during the UCLA foot
ball game in a joint show with the
present LSJUMB. But the mere
gathering of this huge group of
former and present "incom
parables" was an event in itself.
The reunion was the brainchild of
Scott Gode, the Band's current

manager. There have been many
Band reunions on varying scales in
past years, but an alumni Band
never performed on the field
before.
Gode recruited junior Phil Cline,
the Band's archivist and historian,
to help with the logistics of the
event.
Cline began his search in the
Registrar's Office, where he found
records of students who were en
rolled in band classes over the past
30 years. He then went to the Of
fice of Development, where Uni
versity staffer Bart Bartosh helped
him track down the current ad
dresses of the Band alumni.
The first mailing went out in the
middle of August, and the response
"exceeded all expectations," ac
cording to Cline. Officially, 210 "old
farts" said they would be coming.
Meanwhile, Didi Justin, a Dollie
during the 1980-81 school year,
began organizing the alumni Dollie
squad. With the help of two other
former Dollies, Melinda Myers and
Elena (Camacho) Beyers, she
started making phone calls.

The Band beat goes on through the years as drummers — pres
ent and past — demonstrated audibly at Saturday s football
game, which featured a reunion of 200 past Band members and
50 former Dollies.
