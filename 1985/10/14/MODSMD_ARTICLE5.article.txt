# '60s Activists Differ on Impact
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Five student activists involved in the political upris
ings that rocked the University more than a decade ago
examined the impact of those years on the country and
their own lives during a panel discussion yesterday
sponsored by the Class of 1970 at Terman Auditorium.
"This was supposed to be the most radical, revolu
tionary class ever produced by this University," said
Harvey Hukari, a 1968 graduate and former leader of
the Young Americans for Freedom. "It became the
most conventional."
Hukari, who now serves as a consultant for the na
tional Republican Party, said the events of the period
have had a "fairly negative" impact on the country.
The "moral absolution (of the period) has led to a
much broader decline in civility," he said.
Leo Brazile, a 1971 graduate and former leader of
the Black Student Union who now sits on the Oakland
City Council, disagreed with Hukari, saying that the
movements of the time "were necessary then and they
were necessary today."
"Stanford was a stubborn mule then â€” there wasn't
much (one could do) to get its attention," Brazile said.
"We focused a lot of the attention of the United States
on some crucial issues," including the Vietnam War and
affirmative action.
Brazile said he is optimistic about the future because
"we (the members of this generation) are coming to
power.
"We finally have a chance to pull the levers of

power," he said, adding that people of his generation
no longer have to worry about getting the attention of
the institutions with which they deal.
Walter Lammi, a 1969 graduate who said he left the
University as a Marxist and now works at the Hoover
Institution, echoed Hukari's assessment of the period,
although with somewhat stronger language.
"It is my conviction that my generation has failed,"
Lammi said, stating that there was "a kind of
Utopianism in our thinking."
He said that his generation is largely responsible for
the "bumper-sticker politics" that persist today, in
which people over-simplify beliefs into a catchy
phrases.
Lammi said members of his generation put too much
stake in "the power of raised consciousness" to solve
the country's problems, adding that his generation
doesn't have "the seriousness of mind" to lead the
country.
Joyce Kobayashi, a former member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents who graduated in 1970 and is
now a psychiatrist, said the experience of the late
1960s became "more intensely personal and the politics
(became) more symbolic" after she left Stanford.
"I think it was more than a lifestyle or fad," she said,
stating that an "existential courage" exists in members
of her generation.
The meeting featured an analysis of the panelists'
remarks by Sociology Prof. Sanford Dornbusch.
According to Dornbusch, each panelist tried to
"accomplish something with limited opportunities" and
had their initial high hopes of bringing change to the
country dashed.
