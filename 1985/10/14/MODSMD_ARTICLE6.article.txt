# Martin Analyzes Monetary Policy
## 
### WILLIAM PENNEY Staff writer 
The vice chairman of the
Federal Reserve System out
lined new factors affecting the
federal government's monetary
policy before an audience of
more than 800 Graduate School
of Business alumni and guests
Saturday at Memorial
Auditorium.
"We found in the '70s, in
1982-83 and even in 1985 that
the policy forks in the road must
be approached in a very prag
matic way, since no rigid mold
exists for monetary policy," said
Preston Martin, who was speak
ing as part of alumni activities
over the weekend.
Martin said bankers are now
trying to balance the historical
relationships of a growing money
supply, targeting interest rates
and the danger of reinflation with
the fact that "the most elaborate

econometiric model cannot be
depended upon simply to spew
out the right projections."
Defending the government's
tight-money policies of the past
few years, he said, "There are a
thousand ways to rationalize
easy money, but they all fail a
test with regard to the danger of
bringing inflation back.
"We've reversed the inflation
ary momentum of the '70s, at
considerable cost to sectors of
our economy. I concede that un
employment is too high; it's way
above the natural rate," he said.
Addressing the U.S. trade
deficit, he said, "A major cause
of our trade deficit today, and in
recent years, is that we are a so
ciety of high consumption and
high government spending rela
tive to our pool of private
savings."
Martin described the
"leveraging of America" as living
"beyond our means; we're im
porting to live."
