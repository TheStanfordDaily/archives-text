Four of the nine students arrested
Friday at Old Union after protesting Uni
versity investments in companies that
do business in South Africa plan to file
two law suits against the Stanford and
Palo Alto Police Departments for
brutality, according to David Magnus, a
graduate student who supported the
protest group.
All four — graduate student Kaylen
Worth, senior Robby Perkins, junior
Sophia Raday and sophomore Peter
Heslin — are planning to file suit against
Stanford police for their treatment
during their arrests, and Perkins will
bring an individual case against Palo Alto
Police for his treatment while at the
North County Jail in Palo Alto.
Worth, Perkins, Raday and Heslin
went limp and refused to cooperate with
police, and officers were forced to carry
them to a booking room, hold them up to
take their pictures and carry them out of
Old Union to the police vehicles outside.
During this movement, the four
protesters said that police twisted their
wrists, carried them by their arms, ex
cessively tightened handcuffs and picked
them up by their pants and wrists.
"I was then carried out of the building
in the most painful way possible. It was
completely uncalled for — the same idea
as torture," Heslin said.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington said yesterday,"I don't think
that there was any excessive force on
the part of our officers. . . . It's very dif
ficult to move some of those people, but
we did it with as little force as possible.

A person doesn't have to strike you to
be difficult to handle."
Perkins is considering an individual
suit against the Palo Alto police. He said
he was singled out and beaten by
policemen during a two-hour stay at
North County Jail in Palo Alto on Friday.
Perkins said that he was taken to a
solitary cell by Sgt. Kirts of the Palo Alto
Police Department who then, with the
assistance of other officers, forced him
to strip, kicked and beat him for his

refusal to cooperate.
Heslin said that he overheard an offi
cer threaten to kill Perkins.
After Perkins was released from jail at
4 a.m. on Saturday, he was taken to the
Stanford Medical Center where bruises
on his head, neck and arms were
treated, Perkins said.
Perkins, a black, said that he con
siders his treatment a racist act.
Kirts had no comment when con
tacted Saturday night.
