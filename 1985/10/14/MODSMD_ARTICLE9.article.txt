## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Innovative Taxation 
### 
October has been a month of innovative govern
ment taxation. On Oct. 1, as part of the 1984 Deficit
Reduction Act, federal excise tax on distilled spirits
was increased by 19 percent. Beer and wine were
left untouched. Protests were minimal and most
local newspapers featured humorous articles on last
minute buying sprees. In addition, Congress is
debating whether to make the trial 16 cent per pack
tax on cigarettes permanent. As if that were not
enough, the California lottery opened on Oct. 3 by
selling 10.9 million tickets in a 9 hour period.
While increased taxation is unpopular — by its
very nature — with both sides of the political spec
trum, the government is to be congratulated for
being imaginative, interrelating various social prob
lems and preserving individual freedom of choice in
its methods.
The nation is burdened with an ever increasing
federal deficit. At the same time, alcohol abuse has
cost the nation dollars and lives. The increased tax
on alcohol helps solve these problems without in
fringing on individual liberty. Prohibition was an ear
lier solution to the alcohol problem that met with
disastrous results.
The liquor tax is an effective means of controlling
behavior in a non-oppressive way. The decision to
drink is left to the individual with the only require
ment being a small donation to the federal coffer.
Everybody wins. Presumably many will consider
the price too great and curb consumption. Those
who reject the plea to slow down will pay for it with
their tax dollars. It would be nice if some of the dol
lars went to defray the cost of alcoholic recovery
programs.

The same logic applies to an increased tobacco
tax. Those who insist on fouling the common air
with their cigarette smoke should at least have to
pay for the privilege.
The California lottery, a more subtle form of taxa
tion, has provided a bit of excitement at a minimal
cost. Again the tax is totally voluntary with the ben
eficiary being public education. San Francisco's
school district alone expects to receive $3.6 million
from the lottery. The federal treasury also receives
a share as all winnings are subject to federal income
tax (but are exempt from California income tax).
What better example of the American dream than
the 21 immigrant workers who pooled their money
to win the New York State lottery? The windfall
profit tax seems so boring in comparison. The rules
are clear, the odds are well advertised and organ
ized crime has been effectively excluded.
Opponents claim that the poor are exploited vic
tims. With 7 out of every 10 adults in California ex
pected to play, the game is not confined to the poor.
A lottery ticket only costs a dollar. For the irrespon
sible or compulsive gambler, the Nevada border is
several hours away regardless of whether a lottery
exists.
These forms of innovative taxation should be en
couraged. Freedom of choice and individual liberty
are preserved. The government is able to encour
age a healthy lifestyle in a non-oppressive manner
and increase revenue in the process. If willing to pay
the price, a citizen remains free to drink, smoke or
engage in a minor gamble. Those who abhor such
practices are free not to participate and they receive
social benefits generously provided by the tax dol
lars of the smokers, boozers and gamblers.
