# Police Action Incites Anger
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Outrage, increased protests and potential lawsuits
have been some of the responses to Friday's alleged
police brutality toward students at an anti-apartheid sit
in at Old Union.
The Black Student Union (BSU) yesterday
demanded that all charges against the protesters be
dropped and issued a series of demands on behalf of
Robby Perkins, a Stanford senior who said he was
beaten by police after the Old Union arrest.
Specifically, the BSU has asked that Sgt. Arthur
Kirts and at least one other Santa Clara County
Sheriffs officer be removed from their posts and
charged with assault. Perkins has accused Kirts and
other officers of participating in the incident, which he
said took place during a stay in Palo Alto's North
County Jail that ended early Saturday morning. Kirts
was unavailable for comment last night.
The BSU statement also demands restitution for
medical expenses Perkins incurred while being treated
at Stanford Hospital after the alleged beating.
Three students — Perkins, graduate student Kaylen
Worth and sophomore Peter Heslin — say they are
planning to file suit against police, claiming that after
"going limp" and refusing to cooperate during the ar
rest, they were subjected to excessively painful treat
ment while being carried to police vehicles outside of
Old Union.

Sophomore David Potter is dragged away by two policemen at Old Union. Five
others, including a faculty member, were arrested at the sit-in yesterday.
A Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA) flier circ
ulated yesterday said that Stanford police dragged the
students, "twisting their arms behind their backs. . . .
The students, crying out in pain, asked to be carried in
a more humane way, but the officers continued to
abuse them."
Stanford police have denied any wrongdoing in the
incident.
Perkins, in addition, may file an individual lawsuit
charging police brutality against Santa Clara County
Police.
"My guess is it's racism," Perkins, who is black, said
yesterday.
"We have no more cheeks to turn," BSU Chairman
Steven Phillips said yesterday in regard to Perkins' al

leged mistreatment, adding that a meeting with Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy is planned for to
morrow, following a BSU rally to take place in the
Quad at 2 p.m.
Earlier, Phillips issued a BSU statement on police
brutality that stated that "possessing a Stanford ID
does not change the fact that we are black people at a
university that does not respect black people. Presi
dent Donald Kennedy and the Stanford administration
bear the ultimate responsibility."
Kennedy said yesterday, however, that he did not
know of anyone who had observed the alleged police
brutality.
"That doesn't mean, of course, that there wasn't any
mistreatment," Kennedy said. They re certainly en
titled to file a lawsuit."
In reference to the Perkins case, Kennedy said,
"We'll certainly ask about this. I don't exactly know
how. The first thing is to find out what happened."
