# Police Action Incites Anger
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Outrage, increased protests and potential lawsuits
have been some of the responses to Friday's alleged
police brutality toward students at an anti-apartheid sit
in at Old Union.
The Black Student Union (BSU) yesterday
demanded that all charges against the protesters be
dropped and issued a series of demands on behalf of
Robby Perkins, a Stanford senior who said he was
beaten by police after the Old Union arrest.
Specifically, the BSU has asked that Sgt. Arthur
Kirts and at least one other Santa Clara County
Sheriffs officer be removed from their posts and
charged with assault. Perkins has accused Kirts and
other officers of participating in the incident, which he
said took place during a stay in Palo Alto's North
County Jail that ended early Saturday morning. Kirts
was unavailable for comment last night.
The BSU statement also demands restitution for
medical expenses Perkins incurred while being treated
at Stanford Hospital after the alleged beating.
Three students — Perkins, graduate student Kaylen
Worth and sophomore Peter Heslin — say they are
planning to file suit against police, claiming that after
"going limp" and refusing to cooperate during the ar
rest, they were subjected to excessively painful treat
ment while being carried to police vehicles outside of
Old Union.
