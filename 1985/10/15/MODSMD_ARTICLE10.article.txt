# Owen Given Over to Public Service
## 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
University President Donald Kennedy offi
cially dedicated Owen House yesterday as the
center of public service on campus.
Kennedy told a small crowd of Owen House
supporters that the entire house will be given
over to public service organizations now that the
Financial Aids Office has agreed to relocate its
Pell Grant and work-study office to Old Union.
"The good people at financial aids moved out a
little earlier than they were programmed to in
order to make this possible," Kennedy said. "I

think that's a very generous gesture. This is a
place where scarcity of space is a rule of life."
Owen House, which served as a boarding
house for lower-level faculty and staff in Stan
ford's early years and was the site of Prof.
Robert Sears' psychological experiments on
childhood self-concepts in the '60s, currently
houses several campus organizations dedicated
to public service. Included in these groups are
Stanford-in-Government and the Public Service
Center.
One of the groups that will benefit from the
"new" Owen House will be the Stanford Interna
tional Development Organization, which used to
be housed in the Bechtel International Center.

Nazir Ahmad, a SIDO spokesman, said the
giving over of Owen House to public service
groups will help his group coordinate its move
ments with a greater sense of harmony. "A lot of
good programs, despite a lot of energy, have not
been able to do as much as they needed to be
cause of cramped space," Ahmad said. "Having
this space provides a focal point for people inter
ested in public service to get together."
Ahmad added that the centering of all campus
public service groups in one location reinforces
Stanford's role as a "leader" in public service ef
forts. "Having this building here states that
public service is something that is an integral
part of Stanford," he said.
