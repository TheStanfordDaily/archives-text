In arresting protesters of apartheid in Old Union
Friday, Stanford police premised the nine students
that anyone who went lin'p • a tactic used to sym
bolize non-cooperation wiin the arresting officer —
would get hurt, according to witnesses at the scene.
One officer allegedly threatened a protester: "If you
go limp today, we'll drag you out by your hair, just
like we did in the '605."
Apparently, the police made good on their prom
ise.
Witnesses and protesters reported the use of ex
cessive force while being carried from the scene,
charging that three demonstrators were in tears as
a result.
While the unwarranted brutality used by police to
"subdue" limp protesters came as a surprise, some
thing else was even more disturbing: senior Robby
Perkins, the only black to sit in at Old Union, was
singled out for especially harsh treatment by the
white arresting officers.
This could have been a coincidence rather than
racism, except that Perkins was behaving just like
the other students. He was isolated from the rest of
the group from the very beginning, and when he
said he would not voluntarily leave the police van
and walk into the Palo Alto Police Station, one offi
cer choked him, according to Perkins and another
demonstrator.
Once in the station, Perkins was put in solitary
confinement, stripped and beaten to the point that
he is still covered with purple bruises.
A medical examination after his release early Sat
urday revealed bruises and scrapes over his entire
body, particularly on his back and around his neck.

Perkins is by no means unique as a black victim of
police brutality. The New York Times reports that
between 1970 and 1980, more than 6,000 people —
ranging in age from 10 to 81 — were shot to death
by the police. An independent study claims that be
tween 25 and 50 percent of people killed by police
were unarmed at the time of their deaths, and more
than half were black.
Black Stanford students have reported consider
able and consistent police harassment, especially
following the rape of a woman by a black man last
year. Black students walking on campus at night
have been repeatedly stopped by police officers and
asked to display their student ID cards, while in
many cases white students have passed by unhin
dered.
Because there is compelling reason to believe
Perkins' rough treatment at the hands of police may
have been racially-motivated, Perkins says he plans
to sue the officers involved, both Stanford and Palo
Alto policemen. The community would be well
served to watch the Perkins case closely, and to
press for justice in the months ahead.
In the meantime, the University administration,
which bears ultimate responsibility for the conduct
of its police force, owes us an explanation. At the
very least, University President Donald Kennedy
should take a public stand against the excessive use
of force by police officers and launch a formal inves
tigation into the treatment of Perkins and the other
protesters by Stanford police. To the fullest extent
possible, Kennedy should also pursue the case with
the Palo Alto Police Department.
