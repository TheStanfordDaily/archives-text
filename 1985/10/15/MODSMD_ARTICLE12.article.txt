## Anderson Case Unfair 
### 
As friends of Joseph Anderson,
we believe that it is time to defend a
person who has been the victim of
an unusual amount of negative
publicity at a time when he is over
seas and unable to defend himself.

VIEWPOINT

The Daily editorial of Oct. 10 ack
nowledges the key fact of Ander
son's case: that he was "allegedly
driving under the influence of alco
hol." The public should be made
aware of the fact that Anderson was
found not guilty in civil court of the
drunk driving charge. Unfortun
ately, the Oct. 10 editorial never
mentions this fact, but instead it
places him in the same category as
those who "cause accidents and kill
innocent people" because they are
driving under the influence. This is
clearly wrong, since Anderson is in
nocent.
Even though Anderson was
found innocent in public court, Stan
ford administrators charged him
with violating the Fundamental
Standard. They stated that he
drove "his car in a condition and in a
manner inconsistent with the rights
and welfare of others on this
campus." The fact of the matter is
that in April, Anderson accidentally

backed his car over the rear wheel
of a bicycle which was parked in
front of Florence Moore Hall. (The
Daily editorial states that he "wiped
out a few bicycles.") Not only was
Anderson unaware at the time that
he might have damaged a bicycle,
but the passengers in his car stated
that he neither endangered their
own lives nor those of others. Even
the student witness who placed him
under citizen's arrest testified at
both University and civil proceed-

Anderson's only
crime is that he
damaged another
student's bicycle.

ings that Anderson was driving his
automobile in a competent manner.
It is also interesting to note that the
actual bicycle disappeared after the
incident, and it has never since
been found. What, then, are the
grounds for the University's
charge? Anderson's only crime is
that he accidentally damaged an
other student's bicycle.
Stanford administrators were

stubbornly intent on setting a pre
cedent against drunk driving, and
they were too embarrassed to drop
charges once Anderson was ac
quitted in public court. This is
evidenced by the fact that the Stan
ford Judiciary Council called Ander
son to a hearing even before they
had heard the testimony of the
hearing officer who recorded the
events at the time. Was Anderson's
case pursued so vigorously because
he owns a BMW and because he
parked behind the infamous Delta
Upsilon fraternity? Or was he used
to serve as an example? If either
supposition is correct, then justice
has not been served.
We acknowledge that driving un
der the influence of alcohol is a
serious offense. However, since
Anderson did not drive under the
influence and since those who tes
tified said that he did not drive in an
incompetent manner, it is ludicrous
that the University administration
should press charges against him. If
accused of a violation of the Funda
mental Standard, should a student
now expect that his or her case will
be handled in an unfair manner, as
was Joseph Anderson's?
