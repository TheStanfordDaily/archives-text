# Student Activists Should Unite
## 
### 
A column entitled "Youth Should March on Washing
ton" appeared this summer on the opinions page of The
New York Sunday Times. In a nutshell, it called for a
public outcry and bold action by students across the
country in response to the enormous debt with which
our generation is being burdened because of current
out-of-control federal deficits.
What particularly distinguished this column was the
fact that it was written by a student at Yale, Caroline
Frederickson.
There can be no doubt that students make up a con
stituency with potentially devastating power. At times,

such as during the Vietnam War, students used their
collective strength to bring about significant changes in
national policy. The federal budget deficit is one of
many issues in which students currently have a large
stake and in which their voices should be heard.
Unfortunately, lack of organization and blind ignor
ance on the part of many young people today seem to
have rendered this constituency impotent.
That Ronald Reagan won 65 percent of the vote of
people aged 18-26 in the last election tells a sad story.
When this stone age demagogue we call our president
continually gives a low priority to education, arms
reductions, deficit reductions and other issues which
weigh heavily on the future of our nation and the
younger generation, there is something seriously
wrong. At the same time he gives a high priority to
easing the tax burden of the rich, amplifying Cold War
rhetoric, and returning to pre-Civil War models of
justice.
Where is Stanford in all of this? In forming Stanford
Out of South Africa (SOSA), Stanford students
launched a credible, spirited assault on investments in
companies doing business in South Africa. But in my
opinion, it should not have to take policies so blatantly
outrageous as apartheid, or involvement in the Viet
nam War, to draw an organized response from students

on the scale of SOSA. Other issues seem sufficiently
outrageous to merit their own activist outcries.
We ought to have a permanent organization which
would lobby for mainstream student interests on a na
tional scale, which would coordinate activities and ef
forts with other major college campuses, which would
pour mail into Congress and pour editorial opinions into
major newspapers the way Frederickson did. After all,
Reagan lost to Mondale two-to-one on the Stanford
campus, and only the lunatic fringe and the severely
misguided here would defend Reagan's ridiculous
agenda. This voice needs to speak out.
There is one representative organization currently
in place which commands enough attention to make it
the logical point of departure for such a nationally ac
tive movement. Brace yourself. . . . The ASSU ought
to be this type of organization.
Why not? Certainly, this would be an immense
change from the ASSU's time spent piddling around in
failing business ventures. There is no reason that
SOSA could not have sprung out of the ASSU. There is
no reason why we could not elect ASSU candidates on
meaningful criteria, for a change. In fact, there is no
reason why Stanford could not be the national leader in
student government activism.
There is no need to worry about not being heard.
Congress would hear if it started to receive thousands
of letters from students about the deficit and defense
spending. And I'm sure the newspapers would be more
than willing to print intelligent commentaries by capa
ble students.
It may be hard to imagine the ASSU spearheading a
drive like this. But, in reality, there would not need to
be very many structural changes in the organization to
shape it into the kind of body which could meet its po
tential.
The most critical factor is getting student leaders
behind the idea. The momentum generated by a little
action could carry the movement.
There are too many important issues for students to
continue their silence. Caroline Frederickson set an
excellent example by communicating her distress.
What remains is to have student leaders at Stanford,
Yale and every other major college across the country
pick up the baton and start relaying to the nation the
discontent of the student constituency.
