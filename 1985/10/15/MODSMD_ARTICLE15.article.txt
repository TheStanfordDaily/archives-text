Police Brutality
Is *Sick'
Police violence against peaceful
demonstrators is sick. The Stan
ford and local communities should
demand an end to the callous
mistreatment the Stanford police
have applied to a local journalist
(The Daily, Oct. 2) and to
protesters against Stanford's com
plicity with apartheid. What perver
sion leads the police to single out a
black and a woman in the group for
particularly harsh treatment? Ad
ministration officials had con
veniently left when the police
started their dirty work. Let Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
come and hear his students cry out
in pain as police unnecessarily drag
them by twisted arms and shackle
them so tight it hurts. Would he
then continue to prosecute?
The police played a game to see
whom they would get to brutalize.
Those who would not sign their
citations immediately were ar
rested. Those who did not jump in
front of the camera were wrenched
by the armpits and shoved in front
of the camera. Evidently, Stanford
police aren't capable of focusing on
a sitting subject. Those who went
limp, a natural reaction in the face

of such violence, got the harshest
treatment. Those of us who tried
to watch these proceedings,
through the window of the back
room where the protesters were
taken, were told to back off, or
else, because "the chief is mad."
The police will claim they were
"just doing their job," but there's
no need for violence. There have
certainly been more flagrant
abuses of police power, but that's
why it should be stopped now.
Stanford does not need to man
handle peaceful people. If Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington
cannot control his forces and
claims again that people "didn't
complain of any pain," Stanford
should take disciplinary action.
Administration officials should, in
any case, be present during ar
rests that they have requested, in
order to insure that no injuries
result. Community observers will
certainly continue their vigilance
and complaints.
Why does Stanford do this? The
administration claims to be against
apartheid, too. Surely this calls for
leniency with protesters, even if
the administration disagrees with
their methods. Fortunately, others
are truly sympathetic to our move
ment: Trustees of the Kansas City

Police Department pension funds
have just voted to divest from
companies that do business with
South Africa. Do Stanford and its
police have a similar social con
science or are they really only
barely concealing a cruel-hearted
desire to devour the students,
faculty and employees who stand
against injustice?

Professors Must
Hear Complaints

An Oct. 4 article in The Daily
was interesting. The author men
tioned that students can contact
the Accuracy in Academia organi
zation in Washington, D.C. to
report on statements made by
their professors which seem false.
This possibility concerns many
people who think that approaching
the professor (or chairman) is
enough when a situation arises that
involves what the student believes
to be distortions or half-truths
being promulgated by a professor.
What is a student to do?
A professor may suggest that

students enrolled in a class should
raise objections to the teacher
personally. If this is the student's
only recourse, it could appear as a
matter of the fox guarding the
henhouse. On the other hand, a
student may boast that students
can decide for themselves what's
true and what's false. It is a coura
geous proposal indeed, but can
they, so early in their careers,
claim infallibility and be in the pos
session of such a philosopher's
stone as to see their way through
problems that have eluded far
more experienced thinkers for
hundreds of generations?
Professors who cry out
"McCarthy era" over the possibil
ity of bringing a few legitimate
differences of opinion and fact to
public attention have lost their
sense of humor. Just think how
much more interesting the class
would be to the inquisitive student
who wants to see hard questions
asked and answered. The shakers
and movers of professional educa
tion, who contribute to forming the
opinions of our future politicians,
historians, journalists and
governmental advisers should be
able to handle a little limelight.

should take disciplinary action.
Administration officials should, in
any case, be present during ar
rests that they have requested, in
order to insure that no injuries
result. Community observers will
certainly continue their vigilance
and complaints.
Why does Stanford do this? The
administration claims to be against
apartheid, too. Surely this calls for
leniency with protesters, even if
the administration disagrees with
their methods. Fortunately, others
are truly sympathetic to our move
ment: Trustees of the Kansas City

Police Department pension funds
have just voted to divest from
companies that do business with
South Africa. Do Stanford and its
police have a similar social con
science or are they really only
barely concealing a cruel-hearted
desire to devour the students,
faculty and employees who stand
against injustice?

Professors Must
Hear Complaints

An Oct. 4 article in The Daily
was interesting. The author men
tioned that students can contact
the Accuracy in Academia organi
zation in Washington, D.C. to
report on statements made by
their professors which seem false.
This possibility concerns many
people who think that approaching
the professor (or chairman) is
enough when a situation arises that
involves what the student believes
to be distortions or half-truths
being promulgated by a professor.
What is a student to do?
A professor may suggest that

students enrolled in a class should
raise objections to the teacher
personally. If this is the student's
only recourse, it could appear as a
matter of the fox guarding the
henhouse. On the other hand, a
student may boast that students
can decide for themselves what's
true and what's false. It is a coura
geous proposal indeed, but can
they, so early in their careers,
claim infallibility and be in the pos
session of such a philosopher's
stone as to see their way through
problems that have eluded far
more experienced thinkers for
hundreds of generations?
Professors who cry out
"McCarthy era" over the possibil
ity of bringing a few legitimate
differences of opinion and fact to
public attention have lost their
sense of humor. Just think how
much more interesting the class
would be to the inquisitive student
who wants to see hard questions
asked and answered. The shakers
and movers of professional educa
tion, who contribute to forming the
opinions of our future politicians,
historians, journalists and
governmental advisers should be
able to handle a little limelight.
