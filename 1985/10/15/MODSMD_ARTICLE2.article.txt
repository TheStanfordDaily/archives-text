# Six Arrested in Apartheid Sit-In
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
One professor and five students,
charging that students arrested
during a protest here Friday were
victims of police brutality, were ar
rested yesterday when they
refused to end an anti-apartheid sit
in of their own in Old Union.
The incident marked the second
time in four days that demonstra
tors have been arrested for refus
ing to leave the building when it
closed at 5 p.m. On Friday, nine
students protesting the Univer
sity's holdings in companies that do
business in South Africa were ar
rested.
The six arrested yesterday in
clude: graduate students John Ken
nedy, Bryan Van Norden and Eric
Diesel; sophomores David Potter
and Peter Heslin; and Statistics
Prof. Charles Stein — the first fac
ulty member arrested in apartheid
protests here.
Kennedy and Stein were issued
citations and immediately released.
The others were taken to the Santa
Clara County Jail, where they

remained late last night.
The charges against the six
protesters differed based on their
level of cooperation with the police
and their past records.
Kennedy and Stein were charged
with trespassing, unlawful assem
bly, refusal to disperse from an un
lawful assembly and remaining at
the scene of a riot after a warning to
disperse, according to Stanford
Police Captain Raoul Niemeyer.
Their citations require them to ap
pear in court on Nov. 18.
They were the only two offered
cite release, according to Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington.
Potter and Van Norden were ad
ditionally charged with resisting ar
rest. Potter refused to cooperate
with the police by not standing up
or walking when police told him to
do so, and Van Norden refused to
give his name.
Diesel, one of two protesters
who were arrested both days, was
booked on the basic four counts and
"as a repeat offender," according to
Niemeyer. Additional punishment
for repeat offenders "depends on
the courts," Herrington said.
Heslin, another repeat offender,
refused to cooperate with police by
standing and walking and was
charged with resisting arrest and
possessing a controlled substance.
Stanford Police Captain Marvin
Moore said, "We found some drugs
and he's going to be tested for it."
He declined to speculate on what
the substance might be.
None of the charges call for a
specific penalty and it is likely that
some will be negotiated in court,
according to a deputy at the North
County Jail in Palo Alto.
University President Donald
Kennedy yesterday repeated his
view that civil disobedience will
have no effect in bringing about
Stanford's divestment of its stocks
in companies that do business in
South Africa.
He said that the Stanford police
will continue to make "arrests as
required."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, who was present at the
scene of the arrests, said the Uni
versity is serious about enforcing
the policy on disruptive action that
is part of the University's Fun

dumental Standard, the basic code
of acceptable student behavior. If
the standard is enforced, students
arrested could face suspensions, he
said.
Stein, who is on sabbatical this
quarter, said before he was ar
rested yesterday,"l do believe
(civil disobedience) makes a differ
ence — Columbia University
decided to divest in part because of
student protest. Even the very mild
action by the U.S. government (to
impose sanctions against South
Africa) was influenced ... by the
protest of students."
Stein said that he thinks more
professors are concerned about di
vestment than it may seem. "I think
people are busy and somehow we
haven't gotten involved in the
struggle. I think it's important for
everybody to protest human
struggle."
Stein, who was arrested in 1966
for obstructing the entrance to a
military induction center in Oak
land, said that he does not think the
University will take action against
him for his participation in the
protest.
Heslin said before his arrest yes
terday, "They won't intimidate me.
The situation is just as urgent as it
was the other day. I won't be in
fluenced bv scare tactics.

"For me this is a personal state
ment, and I am not responsible for
where IKennedy's] conscience
takes him," Heslin added, referring
to the University president's insis
tence that civil disobedience will not
bring about divestment.
Heslin is one of three students
arrested Friday who are planning to
file suit against police for what they
consider the use of excessive force.
All of those arrested yesterday
said that, in addition to protesting
apartheid, they were also protest
ing police actions against those ar
rested on Friday, particularly an al
leged beating of senior Robby
Perkins.
Van Norden, who said that he
had never before considered taking
part in a protest and does not
believe that divestment is a good
idea, said before he was arrested,
"I'm not so much protesting for di
vestment. I am protesting against
excessive violence against apart
heid protesters."
David Romo, who was arrested
on Friday and in a similar protest
May 28, said late last night that he
had followed the protesters to San
Jose yesterday. He said it did not
appear the four would be offered
cite release or release on personal
recognizance before today.

closed at 5 p.m. On Friday, nine
students protesting the Univer
sity's holdings in companies that do
business in South Africa were ar
rested.
The six arrested yesterday in
clude: graduate students John Ken
nedy, Bryan Van Norden and Eric
Diesel; sophomores David Potter
and Peter Heslin; and Statistics
Prof. Charles Stein — the first fac
ulty member arrested in apartheid
protests here.
Kennedy and Stein were issued
citations and immediately released.
The others were taken to the Santa
Clara County Jail, where they

remained late last night.
The charges against the six
protesters differed based on their
level of cooperation with the police
and their past records.
Kennedy and Stein were charged
with trespassing, unlawful assem
bly, refusal to disperse from an un
lawful assembly and remaining at
the scene of a riot after a warning to
disperse, according to Stanford
Police Captain Raoul Niemeyer.
Their citations require them to ap
pear in court on Nov. 18.
They were the only two offered
cite release, according to Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington.
Potter and Van Norden were ad
ditionally charged with resisting ar
rest. Potter refused to cooperate
with the police by not standing up
or walking when police told him to
do so, and Van Norden refused to
give his name.
Diesel, one of two protesters
who were arrested both days, was
booked on the basic four counts and
"as a repeat offender," according to
Niemeyer. Additional punishment
for repeat offenders "depends on
the courts," Herrington said.
Heslin, another repeat offender,
refused to cooperate with police by
standing and walking and was
charged with resisting arrest and
possessing a controlled substance.
Stanford Police Captain Marvin
Moore said, "We found some drugs
and he's going to be tested for it."
He declined to speculate on what
the substance might be.
None of the charges call for a
specific penalty and it is likely that
some will be negotiated in court,
according to a deputy at the North
County Jail in Palo Alto.
University President Donald
Kennedy yesterday repeated his
view that civil disobedience will
have no effect in bringing about
Stanford's divestment of its stocks
in companies that do business in
South Africa.
He said that the Stanford police
will continue to make "arrests as
required."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, who was present at the
scene of the arrests, said the Uni
versity is serious about enforcing
the policy on disruptive action that
is part of the University's Fun

dumental Standard, the basic code
of acceptable student behavior. If
the standard is enforced, students
arrested could face suspensions, he
said.
Stein, who is on sabbatical this
quarter, said before he was ar
rested yesterday,"l do believe
(civil disobedience) makes a differ
ence — Columbia University
decided to divest in part because of
student protest. Even the very mild
action by the U.S. government (to
impose sanctions against South
Africa) was influenced ... by the
protest of students."
Stein said that he thinks more
professors are concerned about di
vestment than it may seem. "I think
people are busy and somehow we
haven't gotten involved in the
struggle. I think it's important for
everybody to protest human
struggle."
Stein, who was arrested in 1966
for obstructing the entrance to a
military induction center in Oak
land, said that he does not think the
University will take action against
him for his participation in the
protest.
Heslin said before his arrest yes
terday, "They won't intimidate me.
The situation is just as urgent as it
was the other day. I won't be in
fluenced bv scare tactics.

"For me this is a personal state
ment, and I am not responsible for
where IKennedy's] conscience
takes him," Heslin added, referring
to the University president's insis
tence that civil disobedience will not
bring about divestment.
Heslin is one of three students
arrested Friday who are planning to
file suit against police for what they
consider the use of excessive force.
All of those arrested yesterday
said that, in addition to protesting
apartheid, they were also protest
ing police actions against those ar
rested on Friday, particularly an al
leged beating of senior Robby
Perkins.
Van Norden, who said that he
had never before considered taking
part in a protest and does not
believe that divestment is a good
idea, said before he was arrested,
"I'm not so much protesting for di
vestment. I am protesting against
excessive violence against apart
heid protesters."
David Romo, who was arrested
on Friday and in a similar protest
May 28, said late last night that he
had followed the protesters to San
Jose yesterday. He said it did not
appear the four would be offered
cite release or release on personal
recognizance before today.
One professor and five students,
charging that students arrested
during a protest here Friday were
victims of police brutality, were ar
rested yesterday when they
refused to end an anti-apartheid sit
in of their own in Old Union.
The incident marked the second
time in four days that demonstra
tors have been arrested for refus
ing to leave the building when it
closed at 5 p.m. On Friday, nine
students protesting the Univer
sity's holdings in companies that do
business in South Africa were ar
rested.
