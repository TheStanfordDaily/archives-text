## Pachyderms Show Courage, Mice Back Down 
### ANDREW McCLUNG 
Howdy, campers.
I will forgo my customary saluta
tions, exhortations and prefatory
comments this week and get down
(as in, "We don't wanna sit down,
we wanna get down") to brass
tacks, because there are literally
tens ... no, ones, of questions to
be answered.
So, shall we?
Are elephants really scared of
mice? - Charles DeNault
No.
This according to Brandy Pound,
the education director of the San
Francisco Zoological Society. I also
talked to Tony Bila, the assistant
head zookeeper, and he said the
same thing. So it's probably true
that elephants have no innate fear
of very small rodents.
Considering that almost every
cartoon show on this planet that
deals with elephants invariably
portrays them as being deathly
afraid of mice, one wonders how
this bit of pachyderm lore got
started.
The hypothesis presented to me

was that, since elephants have very
poor eyesight but excellent
hearing, their aural detection of
piercing squeaks coming from some
critter they can't see might cause
some alarm.
If the noise were spatially lo
calized in the elephant's mind as
coming from behind, it is con
ceivable (although not likely) that it
would perceive the disturbance as a
threat and do some jumping around
in an effort to escape.
But when one is as big as most
elephants are, moving around that
much for any as-yet-undefined rea
son is a bad habit to develop. One
uses up a lot of energy for nothing.
So most elephants don't worry
about tiny vermin, the ones that
they can barely see from the great
height at which their eyes are lo
cated. And this is just as well, be
cause it takes a few full-grown lions
to dispatch with even an elderly or
sick elephant.
Elephants know this, and behave
accordingly. They also know that
lions don't sound like mice (even
though, on the Serengeti, the
average elephant might not
encounter too many zoo mice), and

therefore they would probably not
greatly fear an occasional ground
based squeak.
And by the way, while we're on
the subjct of pachyderms, it is
(according to Pound) also

very unlikely that a rhinoceros
would undertake a personal effort
to prevent forest fires, an issue
which was discussed last year un
der this logo.
She insists that rhinos are too
shy of humans to ever get near a
campfire, much less jump on top of

one. This news, despite the
evidence to the contrary presented
in "The Gods Must Be Crazy,"
which after all did not claim to be
perfectly factual.
What is the status of the fading
labels (arrows, words) for bike
paths, such as alongside the Quad
and through White Plaza? Are they
still valid, even if you can hardly see
them? - a long- time staff person
The dynamic and cheerfully help
ful Caryl Lazzaro, member of the
Special Services Unit of the Stan
ford Police Department, cour
teously told me what must surely
amount to almost everything there
is to know about this topic.
It turns out that the status of
those lane markings is sort of ill
defined, for a variety of reasons.
In physical terms, their status is
unquestionably "faded." They were
supposed to be repainted over the
summer, but it was one of those
things that got delayed because of
the enormous amount of facilities
maintenance and improvement that
goes on around here in sum
mertime.
So it was guaranteed that the
lanes would have their status

changed to "not faded anymore, by
golly" as of Oct. 15, which is today.
Really.
Go ahead, look up from this
asinine palaver. Yes, there they are
painting away like banshees, ren
dering a veritable Sistine Chapel of
bike lane demarcations right this
minute.
Legally, however, the bike lanes'
status is more confused. You see,
surveys were taken not long after
the lanes were first put down, and it
was found that people had a very
positive response to the lanes.
Lazzaro's department, which also
orchestrates Earthquake Aware
ness Week and other such ex
travaganzas, is basically in charge
of the lanes, but no formal legisla
tion exists to bring the terrible,
swift sword of justice down on
those who wantonly flout the
mandate of bike lane supporters
everywhere.
That means that most people on
campus appreciate cyclists who
confine themselves to the lares and
that they appreciate even more the
pedestrians who stay out of them,
but that none of this Utopian

scheme can be legally enforced.
The police you see on motor
cycles are there to chase down
people who blaze past bollards on
their mopeds or ride double on
bicycles, not to make you ride in
the bike lanes only.
The big idea, originally, was to
provide a means to segregate
vehicles and their operators from
pedestrians. So, technically, ser
vice vehicles are encouraged to use
the bike lanes rather than compete
for the space alloted to pedestrians.
But, of course, there are what
many consider problems. Had the
money and time been available at
the outset, some sort of traffic en
gineering analysis could have been
undertaken. That might have
resulted in separate lanes for ser
vice vehicles and wider lanes to ac
comodate peak loads of bicycle traf
fic (which do indeed swamp the cur
rent lanes).
Since, however, such funding
was not available, and since there
were no bike lane laws to put in
force, the police have hoped that
the lanes would be used simply as
guidelines for traffic.
