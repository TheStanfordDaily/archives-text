## Leon Golub Exhibits Provocative Graphics 
### LEE CLINE 
Oct. 1 marked the opening of a
show of Leon Golub prints at the
Stanford Art Gallery. The longtime
activist artist focuses on violent,
expressive figures in his prints, on
loan from Printworks, Ltd., of
Chicago. Although many critics
have labeled him a "political" artist,
Golub tries to create a more gen
eral, universal picture of the violent
nature of humanity.
Golub is best known for his paint
ings — a few of which were
recently shown in the San Fran
cisco Museum of Modern Art's
"Figurative Expressionists" ex
hibit, but his prints here are excep
tionally powerful and make for a
strong show.

The artist was born in 1922 in
Chicago, and remained there for
several years. He went to war in
1942, saw the German concentra
tion camps and was deeply affected.
He returned to study studio art at
the Art Institute of Chicago.
Between 1947 and 1951, Golub
went through Freudian analysis, as
was often done at the time. His
works during this period possess an
overall feeling of existentialist self
searching. Faces are recessed into
the background, nearly lost among
the tortured swirls of line and color,

especially evident in "Mother and
Child" and the "Caress" works.
Many prints at this time have a
primitive quality about them; a few
verge on the surreal. "Bonehead"
most notably, is reminiscent of both
Miro and Picasso.
A trip to Italy sparked an interest
in classical forms, particularly the
image of the sphinx. Golub has used
it in works as a symbol of mystery
and a beast of unknown grounding,
relevant to his feelings at this time.
Golub's later prints break out of
the psychological, and are more ex
ternally oriented, often portraying
two people in combat. During the
era of the Vietnam War, the artist
collected numerous newspaper
photographs from which he
worked, drawing upon the expres-

sions and positions of the body.
He has been criticized for his
drawing technique, but Golub con
tends that what is important about
his work is conveying the feelings
of power. Though the figures in
"Combat" I and 11, for example, are
primitively drawn, the sense of
power is unmistakably achieved in
the bold strokes of black and white.
The figurative image is only a part
of the whole, which is partially what
defines figurative expressionism.
An additional note about these
works is that the second image is

washed over with a "Pompeii Red,"
again drawn from the artist's inter
est in the classics.
Golub's print "Merc" is his most
recent in the gallery. The feeling
here is one of direct confrontation,
pulling the observer into the action
of the canvas. This print ap
proaches the sensation of his paint
ings in this respect. Proceeds from
the sale of this lithograph will go to
the Artists Call Against United
States Intervention in Central
America.
Not only do the images relay the
sense of violence and brutality;
Golub literally tortures his canvases
to add to the emotions of his work.
He places his wet canvases face to
face so the colors will run into each
other; he scrapes and reworks his
canvases to make them appear as
tortured as the subjects he
portrays. "Burnt Man" is a prime
example of this.
The figures in his later works are
generally described with minimal
effort, creating maximum anxiety
and pain in displaying gritting teeth,
the strained muscles and awkward
positions. The quality of colors also
lend to the moods; they are Often
blacks, reds and olive greens.
Composition is minimal; there is
little or no background, and the art
ist avoids unnecessary props and
clothing or uniforms to give the
pieces a more trans-historical
quality. In addition, what he
portrays are not men of separate
armies, but two human beings in
combat, throwing light on the ab
surdity of war.
Against one wall of the gallery is
a small group of prints by Goya,
Picasso, Daumier and Callot, col
lected to track historical images of
violence. The choices make an in
teresting juxtaposition between
each artists's handling of violence
and that of Golub. Daumier's
matter-of-factness contrasts with
Golub's more subjective work; but
the almost mystical, ominous
moods of Goya parallel some of
Golub's earlier works. Where the
images of Goya, Daumier and Callot
are relatively calculated, Picasso
seems to match the spontaneity of
Golub. There is also a similarity in
their expressive, primitive style,
the universality of both, and the
pure horror that stems from both
their works, drawn from maniacal
facial expressions and unnatural
body contortions.
Goya took an optimistic attitude
toward his work, believing that it
might inspire change in man's atti
tudes toward violence. Golub,
however, is not optimistic that soci
ety will learn from its experiences
or its art expressing the horrors of
man's wars. As the artist once said,
"Killing alone doesn't satisfy some
guys."
The exhibit will run through Nov.

and pain in displaying gritting teeth,
the strained muscles and awkward
positions. The quality of colors also
lend to the moods; they are Often
blacks, reds and olive greens.
Composition is minimal; there is
little or no background, and the art
ist avoids unnecessary props and
clothing or uniforms to give the
pieces a more trans-historical
quality. In addition, what he
portrays are not men of separate
armies, but two human beings in
combat, throwing light on the ab
surdity of war.
Against one wall of the gallery is
a small group of prints by Goya,
Picasso, Daumier and Callot, col
lected to track historical images of
violence. The choices make an in
teresting juxtaposition between
each artists's handling of violence
and that of Golub. Daumier's
matter-of-factness contrasts with
Golub's more subjective work; but
the almost mystical, ominous
moods of Goya parallel some of
Golub's earlier works. Where the
images of Goya, Daumier and Callot
are relatively calculated, Picasso
seems to match the spontaneity of
Golub. There is also a similarity in
their expressive, primitive style,
the universality of both, and the
pure horror that stems from both
their works, drawn from maniacal
facial expressions and unnatural
body contortions.
Goya took an optimistic attitude
toward his work, believing that it
might inspire change in man's atti
tudes toward violence. Golub,
however, is not optimistic that soci
ety will learn from its experiences
or its art expressing the horrors of
man's wars. As the artist once said,
"Killing alone doesn't satisfy some
guys."
The exhibit will run through Nov.

"Combat I," a silkscreen print by Leon Golub, is one example of
the artist's conception of war and violence.


Kym Boyman/Daily
"Ravages of War," an etching by Fransisco Goya (1746-1828), is among those older pieces that
serve to contrast Golub's modern interpretations of war.


"Wounded Sphinx" is a product of Golub's preoccupation with classical myth. Kym Boyman/Da,| y
Oct. 1 marked the opening of a
show of Leon Golub prints at the
Stanford Art Gallery. The longtime
activist artist focuses on violent,
expressive figures in his prints, on
loan from Printworks, Ltd., of
Chicago. Although many critics
have labeled him a "political" artist,
Golub tries to create a more gen
eral, universal picture of the violent
nature of humanity.
Golub is best known for his paint
ings — a few of which were
recently shown in the San Fran
cisco Museum of Modern Art's
"Figurative Expressionists" ex
hibit, but his prints here are excep
tionally powerful and make for a
strong show.

The artist was born in 1922 in
Chicago, and remained there for
several years. He went to war in
1942, saw the German concentra
tion camps and was deeply affected.
He returned to study studio art at
the Art Institute of Chicago.
Between 1947 and 1951, Golub
went through Freudian analysis, as
was often done at the time. His
works during this period possess an
overall feeling of existentialist self
searching. Faces are recessed into
the background, nearly lost among
the tortured swirls of line and color,

especially evident in "Mother and
Child" and the "Caress" works.
Many prints at this time have a
primitive quality about them; a few
verge on the surreal. "Bonehead"
most notably, is reminiscent of both
Miro and Picasso.
A trip to Italy sparked an interest
in classical forms, particularly the
image of the sphinx. Golub has used
it in works as a symbol of mystery
and a beast of unknown grounding,
relevant to his feelings at this time.
Golub's later prints break out of
the psychological, and are more ex
ternally oriented, often portraying
two people in combat. During the
era of the Vietnam War, the artist
collected numerous newspaper
photographs from which he
worked, drawing upon the expres-

sions and positions of the body.
He has been criticized for his
drawing technique, but Golub con
tends that what is important about
his work is conveying the feelings
of power. Though the figures in
"Combat" I and 11, for example, are
primitively drawn, the sense of
power is unmistakably achieved in
the bold strokes of black and white.
The figurative image is only a part
of the whole, which is partially what
defines figurative expressionism.
An additional note about these
works is that the second image is

washed over with a "Pompeii Red,"
again drawn from the artist's inter
est in the classics.
Golub's print "Merc" is his most
recent in the gallery. The feeling
here is one of direct confrontation,
pulling the observer into the action
of the canvas. This print ap
proaches the sensation of his paint
ings in this respect. Proceeds from
the sale of this lithograph will go to
the Artists Call Against United
States Intervention in Central
America.
Not only do the images relay the
sense of violence and brutality;
Golub literally tortures his canvases
to add to the emotions of his work.
He places his wet canvases face to
face so the colors will run into each
other; he scrapes and reworks his
canvases to make them appear as
tortured as the subjects he
portrays. "Burnt Man" is a prime
example of this.
The figures in his later works are
generally described with minimal
effort, creating maximum anxiety
and pain in displaying gritting teeth,
the strained muscles and awkward
positions. The quality of colors also
lend to the moods; they are Often
blacks, reds and olive greens.
