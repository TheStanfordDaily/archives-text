# 'Turandot' Falls Short
## 
### ALLISON HARTWELL Editorial staff 
Love may conquer all in Giacomo Puccini's
"Turandot," but not even the best of intentions can
conquer the small, yet insistent, weaknesses in the
San Francisco Opera's current production.
The show does not lack talent, however, with Eva
Marton as the wonderfully icy, virginal Princess Turan
dot. Turandot, the ruler of ancient Peking, beheads
her suitors for failing to answer three riddles. Marton's
piercing soprano and occasional yelps create a
loathsome character that audiences love to hate.
The scenery, too, is outstanding, creating a mysteri
ous and misty kingdom. Act I begins with the Peking
peasants eagerly awaiting the execution of Turandot's
latest suitor. Executioners resembling samurai war
riors, complete with pony tails and diapers, criss-cross
the stage. They sharpen their knives on a gigantic
wheel that emits genuine, threatening sparks. The
combined effect of these elements makes a striking and
unnerving first impression.
In the commotion preceding the execution, Liu, a
slave girl, and her master Timur are pushed to the
ground by the peasant mob. Calaf, a stranger to the
community, recognizes the fallen man as his long lost
father.
The real weakness, as evidenced throughout the
production, comes with the first notes uttered by Calaf
(Franco Bonisolli). Bonisolli fails to portray the strong,
powerful, brave, courageous hero that is to eventually
to win over Turandot. His lack of projection, in striking
contrast to Marton's intensity, seriously hinders the
performance.
Turandot's three ministers, Ping, Pang and Pong
(played by David Malis, Frank Kelley and Jonathan
Green), prove to be a most delightful trio. Their an
tics, aimed at discouraging Calaf from pursuing Turan
dot, are equaled only by their singing talent. They urge
Calaf to "go back and break your head against a door,"
and to take 100 wives rather than attempt to take
Turandot: "With 100 wives, you'll have breasts, arms
and legs to spare!"
But Calaf is impervious to the warnings of Ping,
Pang and Pong, and commits himself to Turandot's
questions.
The video age has hit even the classical arts with a new
version of film subtitles — the San Francisco Opera's
"supertitles." An electronic screen high above the
stage flashes key excerpts of the libretto, translated
into more or less idiomatic English. This was annoying
at first, but considering most of the audience probably

did not speak Italian, the supertitles were a real help in
undertaking the intricacies of the plot.
Act II opens at the palace pavilion with Ping, Pang
and Pong lamenting Turandot's bloody reign. Their
minds drift off to their homes, giving each a chance to
demonstrate his solo talent as well as his ability to
blend with the others.
The ensuing scene, in which Turandot asks Calaf the
riddles, is one of the strongest for Marton and
Bonisolli, but does not succeed due to the lack of reac
tion by the surrounding peasants. With the entire
kingdom of Peking at stake, the chorus hardly reacts
when Calaf answers the riddles correctly, even though
the bloodshed of Turandot's reign has now supposedly
ended. The chorus, which is effectively evil and blood
thirsty in the first act, fails to act appropriately jubilant
in this scene. This blandness on the chorus' part tends
to weaken the overall scene despite Marton's and
Bonisolli's efforts. It was as if, perhaps due to a scar
city of preparation time, the chorus was able to work
on body movement for the first scenes and was forced
to stand still in the later scenes.
At this point, Turandot still refuses to surrender
herself to Calaf, so he challenges her to a riddle of his
own: if she can discover his identity by dawn, he will be
put to death; if not, Turandot is his prize.
Suprisingly, Bonisolli shines in the beginning of Act
111. He is in the forest, waiting for dawn to come so
that he may claim Turandot. Bonisolli's solo work,
without the distractions of other characters, is superb.
Adding to the scene were members of the chorus sing
ing softly behind the curtain, creating the illusion of
peasants in the city. These voices are suitably distant
to allow Bonisolli to be heard.
Ping, Pang and Pong enter once again accompanied
by several wormlike, scantily-clad females to tempt
Calaf. These dancers are wonderfully seductive and
add needed motion to the opera.
Turandot threatens to kill all the village peasants if
the identity of Calaf is not revealed. Liu, the slave girl
played by Adriana Anelli, is found and tortured. Anelli
ends up as the most expressive of the cast, insuring
the success of the scene with her strong soprano and
equally strong screams.
Bonisolli really begins to fail with the torturing of
Liu. He remains motionless throughout the torture,
without even a glance to Liu. More than likely, this is a
director's problem rather than Bonisolli's, but regard
less of responsibility, Calaf appears so uncompas
sionate and uncaring that you don't want him to melt
Turandot in the end.
Finally, when the time comes for Calaf to win over

Turandot, Calaf is not victorious. He begins his con
quest well; he seizes Turandot, flings off her layers of
clothing (save one) and in a swift swoop removes her
crown and madly kisses her. But what you know is
supposed to be the climax doesn't feel like one. In the
following duet between Calaf and Turandot, Turandot
remains the commanding figure with Calaf on his
knees. Marton overpowers Bonisolli with sheer power
of voice and stature. Calaf, Peking's conqueror of the
and savior, falls flat with his lack of vocal and theatri

cal assertiveness.
As last Saturday's performance drew to a close, the
curtain calls told the story of the entire performance.
After the major performers had given one bow,
Bonisolli emerged from the curtain once again, urging
the audience to stand for Marton's final entrance. The
audience complied, but somewhat reluctantly: The
production was a fine showing by a fine company, but
this particular performance did not merit more than
one round of curtain calls.

peasants eagerly awaiting the execution of Turandot's
latest suitor. Executioners resembling samurai war
riors, complete with pony tails and diapers, criss-cross
the stage. They sharpen their knives on a gigantic
wheel that emits genuine, threatening sparks. The
combined effect of these elements makes a striking and
unnerving first impression.
In the commotion preceding the execution, Liu, a
slave girl, and her master Timur are pushed to the
ground by the peasant mob. Calaf, a stranger to the
community, recognizes the fallen man as his long lost
father.
The real weakness, as evidenced throughout the
production, comes with the first notes uttered by Calaf
(Franco Bonisolli). Bonisolli fails to portray the strong,
powerful, brave, courageous hero that is to eventually
to win over Turandot. His lack of projection, in striking
contrast to Marton's intensity, seriously hinders the
performance.
Turandot's three ministers, Ping, Pang and Pong
(played by David Malis, Frank Kelley and Jonathan
Green), prove to be a most delightful trio. Their an
tics, aimed at discouraging Calaf from pursuing Turan
dot, are equaled only by their singing talent. They urge
Calaf to "go back and break your head against a door,"
and to take 100 wives rather than attempt to take
Turandot: "With 100 wives, you'll have breasts, arms
and legs to spare!"
But Calaf is impervious to the warnings of Ping,
Pang and Pong, and commits himself to Turandot's
questions.
The video age has hit even the classical arts with a new
version of film subtitles — the San Francisco Opera's
"supertitles." An electronic screen high above the
stage flashes key excerpts of the libretto, translated
into more or less idiomatic English. This was annoying
at first, but considering most of the audience probably

did not speak Italian, the supertitles were a real help in
undertaking the intricacies of the plot.
Act II opens at the palace pavilion with Ping, Pang
and Pong lamenting Turandot's bloody reign. Their
minds drift off to their homes, giving each a chance to
demonstrate his solo talent as well as his ability to
blend with the others.
The ensuing scene, in which Turandot asks Calaf the
riddles, is one of the strongest for Marton and
Bonisolli, but does not succeed due to the lack of reac
tion by the surrounding peasants. With the entire
kingdom of Peking at stake, the chorus hardly reacts
when Calaf answers the riddles correctly, even though
the bloodshed of Turandot's reign has now supposedly
ended. The chorus, which is effectively evil and blood
thirsty in the first act, fails to act appropriately jubilant
in this scene. This blandness on the chorus' part tends
to weaken the overall scene despite Marton's and
Bonisolli's efforts. It was as if, perhaps due to a scar
city of preparation time, the chorus was able to work
on body movement for the first scenes and was forced
to stand still in the later scenes.
At this point, Turandot still refuses to surrender
herself to Calaf, so he challenges her to a riddle of his
own: if she can discover his identity by dawn, he will be
put to death; if not, Turandot is his prize.
Suprisingly, Bonisolli shines in the beginning of Act
111. He is in the forest, waiting for dawn to come so
that he may claim Turandot. Bonisolli's solo work,
without the distractions of other characters, is superb.
Adding to the scene were members of the chorus sing
ing softly behind the curtain, creating the illusion of
peasants in the city. These voices are suitably distant
to allow Bonisolli to be heard.
Ping, Pang and Pong enter once again accompanied
by several wormlike, scantily-clad females to tempt
Calaf. These dancers are wonderfully seductive and
add needed motion to the opera.
Turandot threatens to kill all the village peasants if
the identity of Calaf is not revealed. Liu, the slave girl
played by Adriana Anelli, is found and tortured. Anelli
ends up as the most expressive of the cast, insuring
the success of the scene with her strong soprano and
equally strong screams.
Bonisolli really begins to fail with the torturing of
Liu. He remains motionless throughout the torture,
without even a glance to Liu. More than likely, this is a
director's problem rather than Bonisolli's, but regard
less of responsibility, Calaf appears so uncompas
sionate and uncaring that you don't want him to melt
Turandot in the end.
Finally, when the time comes for Calaf to win over

Turandot, Calaf is not victorious. He begins his con
quest well; he seizes Turandot, flings off her layers of
clothing (save one) and in a swift swoop removes her
crown and madly kisses her. But what you know is
supposed to be the climax doesn't feel like one. In the
following duet between Calaf and Turandot, Turandot
remains the commanding figure with Calaf on his
knees. Marton overpowers Bonisolli with sheer power
of voice and stature. Calaf, Peking's conqueror of the
and savior, falls flat with his lack of vocal and theatri

cal assertiveness.
As last Saturday's performance drew to a close, the
curtain calls told the story of the entire performance.
After the major performers had given one bow,
Bonisolli emerged from the curtain once again, urging
the audience to stand for Marton's final entrance. The
audience complied, but somewhat reluctantly: The
production was a fine showing by a fine company, but
this particular performance did not merit more than
one round of curtain calls.


Eva Marton shines in the title role of the San Francisco Opera's production of "Turandot." The
production runs through Friday at the War Memorial Opera House.
Love may conquer all in Giacomo Puccini's
"Turandot," but not even the best of intentions can
conquer the small, yet insistent, weaknesses in the
San Francisco Opera's current production.
The show does not lack talent, however, with Eva
Marton as the wonderfully icy, virginal Princess Turan
dot. Turandot, the ruler of ancient Peking, beheads
her suitors for failing to answer three riddles. Marton's
piercing soprano and occasional yelps create a
loathsome character that audiences love to hate.
The scenery, too, is outstanding, creating a mysteri
ous and misty kingdom. Act I begins with the Peking
peasants eagerly awaiting the execution of Turandot's
latest suitor. Executioners resembling samurai war
