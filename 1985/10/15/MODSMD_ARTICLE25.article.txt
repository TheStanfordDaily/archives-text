# Ant Concert Disappoints Fans

### LISA MARTINEZ 
From the moment the lights
dimmed at Concord Pavilion, Adam
Ant made his audience aware of his
tremendous sexual energy, if not
his musical talent, at his "Vive le
Rock" concert Saturday night.
As he pranced on stage in his
torn jeans and black leather jacket,
the crowd of teeny-boppers and
punkers roared with excitement.
The new sounds were a far cry
from the music created by the
opening Eric Martin Band. This
group of high school-like enter
tainers began the night with Top 40
pop music that lacked any distinc
tion whatsoever. Although songs
such as "Reputation" and
"Information" had a decent beat,
they struck only boredom into the
waiting audience.
During the tedious lull between
acts, the audience watched the
crew set the stage in an Indiana
Jones motif, complete with ancient
statues and a rope bridge which
hung over the head of drummer
Count Wiclzing. In the darkness,
the band filed onto the stage. As
guitarist Marco Pirroni and bassist
Chris Deniro blasted their intro,

Adam Ant burst through the back
curtain, sending the already roaring
crowd into a frenzy.
Screaming teenage girls wearing
garish makeup and spiked heels
lined the aisles of the less than full
Pavilion, and created an air of an
ticipation which quickly died down
for the older members of the audi
ence.
Those of us who were expecting
his usual brand of hard punk music
were disappointed to hear a con
glomeration of tunes which sounded
basically the same. Although songs
such as "Physical" and "Desperate"
had a fairly good beat, they had
none of the typical Adam Ant
charisma and seemed lackluster. As
the night wore on, some of the
older members of the audience
became bored and conversations
sprouted up over the roar of the
music.
The Pavilion's poor sound sys
tem made what could have been a
decent concert hard to bear. For
such a small amphitheater the
music was incredibly loud. The
majority of the lyrics were unintel
ligible and the rhythms of each song
were the only things which distin
guished one piece from the other.

Admittedly, Adam Ant put on a
good stage performance. He
seemed to have a rapport with his
younger audience that most
performers don't show. Through
out the entire concert, he was in
constant communication with the
crowd. Lulls in the screaming were
rare and few of the younger people
even thought to sit down. Clothes,
flowers and banners regularly flew
onto the stage and several over
zealous girls threw their bras at the
performer, who of course wasn't
phased in the slightest.
After three hours of almost non
stop music, everyone got fairly
tired, including Adam Ant. The art
ist's performance became redun
dant and lost most of its electricity
as he worked his way through one
similar song after another.
The concert ended on a typically
unusual note as Adam dangled from
netting hung above the stage, not
unlike an ant caught in a spider's
web. Overall, it was a disappointing
but fun experience. Most of the au
dience enjoyed his good looks and
great body, if not his music, and not
a word of complaint could be heard
among the satisfied tenny-boppers
who filed out of the amphitheater.


Adam Ant's charisma and body exited teeny-boppers, but those hoping for good music soon
grew tired of his uninspired performance Saturday night.
