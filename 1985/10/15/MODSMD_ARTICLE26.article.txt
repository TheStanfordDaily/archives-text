## On the Road to Success Once unable to make the team, Regina Jacobs is now the Card captain 
### CHRIS MYERS 
As a freshman, Regina Jacobs
couldn't even make the Stanford
women's cross country team. Now
Jacobs, a senior, is the captain of
that team and its number one run
ner.
She has garnered All-America
honors six times — three times
each in cross country and track.
Last year, Jacobs won every race
during the regular meet season,
setting the Stanford course record
along the way, and then finished an
impressive fourth at the NCAA
Cross Country Championships.
But Jacobs still has one big goal
left, and she speaks plainly about it.
"I want an NCAA title, for myself
and for my team," she says. "That
seems to be eluding me."
Indeed, Stanford has been a
bridesmaid during the three years
of Jacobs' career. The team has
finished second in the NCAA Cham
pionships three straight times,
losing out by a mere three points in
1983.
Jacobs, meanwhile, finished in
the top 10 in the individual NCAA
results the past two years and was
18th in 1982, her first year on the
team.
All that after not making the team
her freshman year. Jacobs was
originally recruited by track Coach
Brooks Johnson. There was no
track team at Jacobs' high school in
Los Angeles, Argylle Academy, so
she ran for the Naturite Track
Club, specializing in the 800-meter
dash. She ran well enough to qualify
for the 1980 U.S. Olympic Trials,
and that was where Jacobs first
heard about Brooks Johnson.

Johnson was a pioneer in devel
oping the running tights that are
now widely-used but which in 1980
were a new sensation. A friend
mentioned the tights to Jacobs at
the trials, and in connection men
tioned Johnson and Stanford as
well.
A year after that auspicious intro
duction to the school, Jacobs was
running track on the Farm,
presumably drawn more by
Johnson's coaching renown than by
his newfangled running attire.
Jacobs admits that the chance to
run for Johnson was the primary at
traction of Stanford. But she was
also very impressed by the Univer
sity. As she says, "Stanford was
the only school that combined su
perior athletics with academics."
That first year, Jacobs ran only
track. The next year, she was an
All-American in cross country, and
she has improved steadily each
season since.
Johnson has no trouble explaining
Jacobs' transition from sprint and
middle distance running to cross
country excellence. "Ninety-nine
percent of the credit goes to
Regina," he said. "She just decided
she was going to be a good cross
country runner, and she worked at
it . . . she's very much a self
starter. "
Jacobs cites two reasons for her
success in cross country: "I was
lucky enough to be born not only
with some natural talent, but also
with an interest in the area in which
I have the talent. And I know my
body well. I know to back off when
I'm tired — that's kept me from
being injured."
Jacobs thinks the last fact is par
ticularly important. The freedom

from injuries has allowed her to
build up her conditioning and
strength over a continuous period
of three or four years.
Many of Jacobs' track instincts
seem to carry over to her cross
country running. She is a gutsy,
commanding cross country runner
who likes to run from the front,
using her sprint-honed leg speed to
set the tempo of a race. Or as
Johnson says, "Regina just gets
out, goes to the front and cruises
there."
Jacobs hasn't let success go to
her head. If she is fierce and in
tense in a race, she is anything but
that in person. Gracious and
friendly, she speaks with thought
and candor, never taking herself or
her accomplishments too seriously.
Certainly, there is little danger of
Jacobs becoming complacent in
her last season at Stanford.
"I'm not that confident in my own
ability," she said. "Every time I go
out there to race, I feel like I've got
something to prove."
This is her second year as cap
tain of the cross country team, but
Jacobs characteristically downplays
that role. "I only feel like captain
when I'm ordering food and arrang
ing meals at (training) camp," she
said with a laugh, before adding,
"Everyone on the team is so ma
ture, it's not like they need one
leader. I don't really see myself as
someone to look up to."
While track is her first love,
Jacobs finds the team aspect of
cross country particularly appeal
ing. "It's such a team sport . . .
that relieves a lot of the pressure
you feel when you're running indi
vidually. "

And what does Jacobs think of
the team's chances at the NCAA
Championships this year? "If we go
in relaxed and confident, we're
going to do well," she said. "We
have a relatively injury-free team,
it's a smart team, and Brooks
Qohnson) knows the team well."
Regardless of the outcome of this
season, Jacobs will look back on her
Stanford career with fondness, and
appreciation of both the competition
she has taken part in and the educa
tion she has received. "I've really
enjoyed running for Stanford, for
the school. I think being an athlete
has given me a very special look at
Stanford. I'm getting a great educa
tion here, too, and that's really im
portant. Who knows how long I'll be
able to run? But once I get a degree
from Stanford, nobody can take that
away from me."
That degree will be in English
and communications, and though
Jacobs is unsure about her career
plans, she's certain that she'll at
tend business school.
Before graduate school,
however, she'll take a year off from
studying and begin training with
Johnson for the 1988 Seoul Olym
pics. There, she hopes to compete
in the 1-, 500-meter run.
Looking beyond 1988, Jacobs
thinks running will always be a part
of her life. "I like to win, but I also
reallv enjoy just running and feeling
in shape," she says. A whimsical
smile crosses her face, and she
adds, "I can just see myself racing
with my grandchildren."
And with any luck, Regina Jacobs
will be able to tell those
grandchildren about the NCAA title
she helped win in her last year at
Stanford.

Considered the best woman runner at Stanford, Regina Jacobs
is entering her senior year with her eye on an NCAA champion
ship. In her three previous years here, the women's cross
country team has finished as the runner-up in the NCAAs. "I
want a title for myself and for my team," she said. Jacobs also
has her eye on the 1988 Olympics in Seoul.
