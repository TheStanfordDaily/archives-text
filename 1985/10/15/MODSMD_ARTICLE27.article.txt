ST. LOUIS (AP) â€” Ozzie Smith, the least likely
man in the St. Louis lineup, homered with one out in
the ninth inning to give the Cardinals a 3-2 victory over
Los Angeles in the pivotal fifth game of the National
League playoffs yesterday. With the victory, the Car
dinals swept the three games in their home park and
took a 3-2 lead as the best-of-seven series headed back
to Los Angeles.
The homer came on a 1-2 pitch from Tom Nieden
fuer and was the first that the switch-hitting Smith has
hit batting left-handed in 2,968 career at-bats. He had
only six homers this season.
After an off day, the series resumes tomorrow after
noon at Dodger Stadium. In a rematch of Game 2, won
by the Dodgers 8-2, Los Angeles will start right
hander Orel Hershiser against the Cardinals' Joaquin
Andujar.
Before Smith's dramatic homer yesterday, the two
teams had played a 2-2 tie after Bill Madlock's two-run
home run for the Dodgers in the fourth inning.
In and out of trouble, Dodger left-hander Fernando
Valenzuela finally left after throwing 132 pitches
through eight innings, and Niedenfuer, who saved
Game 1 for Valenzueia, came in to pitch.
He got Willie McGee to foul out to third and ran the
count to a ball and two strikes on Smith before the
slightly built shortstop launched one into the second
deck in right field, bringing his teammates rushing onto
the field and eliciting a huge ovation from the 53,708 at
Busch Stadium.
Tommy Herr gave the Cardinals their only two other
runs in the game with a two-run double in the first in
ning, and Madlock evened it up in the fourth. It was the
most closely contested game of the series. In fact, it
was the only game decided after the sixth inning and
only the second game of the playoffs decided after the
third.
The winning pitcher was Cardinal bullpen ace Jeff
Lahti, the fourth St. Louis pitcher of the day, who
retired the Dodgers in order in the ninth.
Valenzuela pitched eight innings, giving up four hits
and two runs with seven strikeouts and eight walks.
The walks established an NL playoff record, surpass
ing the six allowed in 1974 by Pittsburgh's Bruce Kison
and in Game 3 of this series by the Dodgers' Bob
Welch.
The Cardinals played their second straight game of
the series without left fielder Vince Coleman, whose
left leg was injured Sunday when he was partially
trapped under the machine that rolls the tarp onto the
field.
"I wouldn't wish what happened to me on my worst
enemy," said Coleman, whose only real injuries were
scrapes and bruises. He could play tomorrow in Los
Angeles.
Cardinals right-hander Bob Forsch, a spot starter
this year, lasted only 3 1-3 innings before he was
relieved by left-hander Ken Dayley after giving up the
tying runs in the fourth inning. The 35-year-old Forsch
is the senior member of the Cardinals, having been
with the club since 1974.
Cards Manager Whitey Herzog elected to go with
Forsch yesterday instead of bringing back Andujar on
three day's rest. Andujar was ineffective in losing
Game 2 in Los Angeles, going 4 1-3 innings and giving
up six runs on eight hits.
In Game 1, Valenzuela had to pitch his way out of
minor trouble in the first two innings. This time, he
was only half as lucky. And this time, the trouble was
of his own doing, the result of wildness.

Valenzuela walked Willie McGee on a 3-2 pitch to
start the first inning. McGee checked his swing just in
time to avoid striking out, and the next batter, Smith,
walked on four pitches. Valenzuela then threw a strike
to Herr before the Cards' RBI leader pulled a ground
double down the left-field line.
McGee scored easily and Smith ran through the
"stop" sign of third-base coach Hal Lanier to score as
Pedro Guerrero's throw from left field sailed over the
head of catcher Mike Scioscia. Valenzuela backed up
the play, and Herr held at second. Herr, who homered
in Game 3, wound up at third shortly thereafter,
however, when Valenzuela threw the ball into center
field on an attempted pickoff.
The Cards failed to score Herr as Jack Clark lined
out hard to Bill Madlock at third, Cesar Cedeno struck
out and Tito Landrum, Coleman's replacement in left
field, flied to center.
The double was Herr's fourth of the playoffs, tying a
record set by Pete Rose of Cincinnati and Matty Alou
of Oakland, both in 1972. And the RBI were the fourth
and fifth in the series for Herr, who had 110 during the
season.
The Cardinals again had the first two runners of the
second inning aboard on a double by Terry Pendleton
and a walk to Darrell Porter. Forsch sacrificed the run
ners to second and third, but McGee struck out and
Smith popped deep to shortstop Mariano Duncan to
end the threat.
In the fourth inning, the Dodgers tied the score on

Madlock's second home run in as many days but lost an
opportunity to go ahead when the Cardinals turned a
double play.
Ken Landreaux led off the fourth with a single up the
middle. Guerrero then hit a fly ball to the warning track
in center field for the first out, bringing up Madlock,
who had hit a solo homer off John Tudor in a 12-2 loss
Sunday.
Madlock lined a 2-0 pitch from Forsch into the
second deck in left field to tie the score 2-2 and give
him five RBI for the series. Forsch then walked Mike
Marshall, bringing up Scioscia.
Twice Forsch pitched out while Scioscia was at bat,
apparently hedging against the hit-and-run. The first
time, Porter had Marshall hung up between first and
second, but his throw was wide of first and in the
ground. First-baseman Clark made a nice back-handed
pickup of the one-hopper to keep Marshall at first.
But, on the second pitchout, Porter lunged for the
ball as Scioscia swung, and Scioscia took first when his
bat made contact with the catcher's glove for inter
ference. Forsch threw one pitch to the next batter,
Greg Brock, who lined it foul into the right-field seats.
And that was the end of a day's work for Forsch,
who was 9-6 as a spot starter during the season but
finished 3-1 while occupying a steady spot in the rota
tion in September. Left-hander Ken Dayley was
brought on to face pinch-hitter Enos Cabell, who
grounded into a routine double play started by
Pendleton at third.

The Cardinals' Tommy Herr drove in the first two runs of yesterday's 3-2 win over the Dodgers
with a first inning double. Then he advanced to third on this wild pickoff attempt from Fernando
Valenzuela, while Steve Sax of the Dodgers tried vainly to make the catch.
