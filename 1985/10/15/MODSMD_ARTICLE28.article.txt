# Muster May Play Against Southern Cal
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Stanford football got some good news yesterday
when fullback Brad Muster was found to have suf
fered only a bruised sternum in Saturday's 34-9 loss
to UCLA. It was originally feared that Muster had
sustained a broken rib, but X-rays yesteday proved
negative.
It is uncertain whether Muster will play this week
at USC, but he is expected to miss one game at
most. The coaches will keep him out of contact this
week.
Despite missing much of the last two games with
first a hip pointer, then the bruised sternum, Muster
still leads the nation with nine receptions per game.
He is 12th in all-purpose running with 145 yards per
game and 16th in scoring with 8.8 points per game.
If Muster is unable to play, Brian Morris will get
the start. Morris has 22 receptions in the last two
games in relief of Muster.
This week may also see a return to action for
junior fullback Marshall Dillard, who redshirted last
season with an ankle injury. As a freshman, Dillard
was the Cardinal's third-leading rusher with 155
yards and started the final three games of 1983.
"Marshall's looked good," Coach Jack Elway said.
"He's practiced for two weeks straight, he's catch
ing the ball well, and he could be a factor."
It appears the Cardinal may go to Los Angeles
healthier than expected. Linebacker Matt Soder
lund, safety Brad Humphreys and defensive tackle
Joe Lortie all suffered pinched nerves against
UCLA, b,ut X-rays were negative, and all three are
probable this week. Wide receiver Jeff James, who
sprained his right wrist, is also probable.
Despite the good play of center Kurt Josephson
and tackle John Barns, injuries have been the big
gest problem on the offensive line, where the Card
inal has had "a whole lot of bad luck," according to
Elway. The line is expected to be ready for USC.
Card notes
Saturday's game produced both Pacific 10 Confer
ence Players of the Week. Unfortunately, both
played for UCLA. Tailback James Primus, who
ran for 129 yards and two touchdowns, and defen
sive tackle Mark Walen, who had eight tackles and
three sacks, were honored yesterday.
In two conference games, Stanford has seen its
opponents have three players honored as players of
the week. Oregon tailback Tony Cherry was
named Offensive Player of the Week three weeks
ago.
Freshman strong safety Sam Sutherland will
start again this week, moving Humphreys to free
safety and keeping Mark Hashimoto on the
sideline.
