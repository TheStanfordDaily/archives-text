### PETER HAVEN Editorial staff 
The NCAA announced yester
day that former Stanford tennis
player Linda Gates has received
the 1985 Broderick Award for
tennis, and she is now one of 10
finalists for the Broderick Cup,
which honors the most
"dominating" player in 10
women's varsity sports.
Gates, currently in Japan com
peting in a tournament on the
women's professional tour, was
a senior last year at Stanford and
a four-time All-American here
from 1982-85.
According to women's tennis
Coach Frank Brennan, the
Brodericks are given to the most
"dominating" player in each of 10
women's varsity sports. From
these 10 finalists, the NCAA
chooses the recipient of the
Broderick Cup.
"She has had one of the most
outstanding tennis careers of all
time," Brennan said of Gates. "I
can't think of anyone more
deserving."
Gary Migdol, assistant sports
information director, called
Gates "one of the greatest col

legiate tennis players of all
time."
In addition to being on two un
defeated NCAA championship
teams (1982 and 1984), Gates
won the singles title once (1985)
and the doubles title twice (1985
and 1984). She also won the Ar
thur Ashe Sportsmanship Award
in her junior year.
She was a runner-up in the
1984 singles finals and in the
1983 doubles competition. Last
year, while serving as the Card
inal captain, Gates led the
squad to a No. 5 finish in the
NCAAs.
Gates, 5-foot-9 and 150
pounds, hails from Hillsborough.
She came to Stanford in 1981
and proceeded to earn All-
America recognition in her first
year on the Farm. She is one of
only four Stanford women's ten
nis players to do so. Susie Hagey
(1976-79), Alycia Moulton (1979-
82) and Elise Burgin (1981-84)
are the other three.
An international relations
major, Gates still has six units to
complete before she earns her
Stanford degree, Brennan said.
He added that she plans to
return to Stanford — possibly
next quarter — to complete her
academic work.
