# Chico, Card Seem Like Twins
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff Writer 
If you like close matches and unpredictable
outcomes, then today's 3 p.m. game between Stan
ford's women's soccer team and Chico State could
be exactly what you're looking for.
The squads seem to be as evenly matched as they
come. Both have had inconsistent seasons,
sometimes rising to the occasion against more
skilled squads and other times playing to the level of
weaker teams.
In recent outings, the Wildcats were handily
beaten by Santa Clara, an average squad, and then
turned around and tied undefeated Hayward State.
Stanford is currently riding high on the crest of a
two-game winning streak. The Cardinal offense,
which was missing through the first part of the
season, is beginning to blossom.

Add the Cardinal scoring threat to a defense
which hasn't allowed a goal in the past two games,
and it looks like Stanford may be ready to peak.
Coach Helen Keohane is hoping that her team will
be able to jump on Chico quicldy and force them into
one of their bad games. "If we're real on and up for
the game, we may be able to put it away. Other
wise, it'll be close," she said.
Yet another similarity between the two teams,
one that may cause a spectator to look twice, will be
twin sisters playing against each other. Cardinal
defender Carol Berryman will be lining up against
her twin sister, Barbara.
Barbara Berryman plays midfielder for the
Wildcats, so the confrontation won't be head to
head. But the two should run into each other on the
Cardinal side of the field.
There's still no definite verdict on which Ber
ryman is the better player, but in Koehane's
opinion, "Carol is the better player."
