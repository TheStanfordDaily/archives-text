Mubarak Demands U.S. Apology
CAIRO, Egypt — The diplomatic crisis between Egypt and the
Reagan Administration escalated yesterday when President Hosni
Mubarak demanded a public apology from '*ie United States for or
dering the interception of an Egyptian airliner carrying the hijackers
of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro.
Mubarak, facing a groundswell of popular anger over the incident,
indicated that a private message he received Sunday from President
Reagan was not enough to defuse what has become the most serious
dispute in U.S.-Egyptian relations since the rapproachment that fol
lowed the Arab-Israeli War of 1973.
"Frankly, I have not read this message yet because I am so upset
(with the United States),"Mubarak told reporters when asked about
a letter from Reagan that had been delivered a day earlier by U.S.
Ambassador Nicholas Veliotes.
Although the contents of Reagan's letter have not been disclosed,
a senior U.S. Embassy official told reporters Sunday that in it the
president expressed "considerable understanding" for Egypt's anger
over the airliner incident.
Mubarak dismissed this as insufficient, saying that what was
needed was an "appropriate apology... to all Egyptians," not just a
personal apology to him.
Mubarak's demand for a public apology came as the semi-official
press here began stepping up a vitrolic anti-American editorial cam
paign that appeared to contradict earlier assertions by U.S. officials
that Egypt was seeking to minimize the effects of the airliner incident
and get on with its formerly good relations with the United States.
The pro-government newspaper A 1 Akhbar, denouncing what it
called "cowboy terrorism," said the seizure of the airliner, and the
way the Reagan Administration has been "rejoicing" over an incident
deeply humiliating to Egypt, have pushed Egyptian-U.S. relations to
"a point of deterioration that cannot be cured either in the present or
the future."
Britain Terminates PLO Talks
LONDON — In what British officials described as a significant set
back to the Middle East peace process, the first scheduled talks be
tween members of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the
British government collapsed in disagreement here yesterday just
hours before they were to have begun.
Officials at the British Foreign Office blamed the Palestinians for
the debacle, saying that they refused at the last minute to support a
previously agreed-upon joint statement that included recognition of
Israel's right to exist. But a PLO official in London insisted that the
talks failed to take place because Britain tried to insert such a refer
ence at the last minute.
Whoever was to blame, it was apparent that heightened emotions
resulting from last week's terrorist hijacking of the Italian cruise liner
Achille Lauro had added to the already strong pressures opposing
the talks both in Britain and among hardline Palestinians.
The failure of the planned talks, scheduled between British
Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and a joint Jordanian-Palestinian
delegation with the aim of reviving a stalled, eight-month-old Middle
East peace initiative by Jordan's King Hussein, constitutes a serious
setback for Hussein and an embarrassment for Prime Minister Mar
garet Thatcher.
Reagan Sends Marcos Warning
WASHINGTON — President Reagan has sent his close friend
Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.) to see Philippine President Ferdinand
Marcos, bearing what one Administration official called "an ex
tremely blunt message of warning" that the Marcos regime is in dan
ger of being overthrown.
The official said that assessments by the Central Intelligence
Agency and a special national security planning group point to the po
tential of the Philippines, with two vital U.S. military bases, becom
ing "this Administration's Iran" unless Marcos takes immediate steps
to combat a growing communist insurgency.
One official called the message that Laxalt is carrying "the bluntest
presidential message ever delivered to a friend." He said that
Marcos would be told that he was "screwing up the fight against the
insurgency" and that his government was too preoccupied with finan
cial gain and domestic politics rather than combating the increasingly
powerful New People's Army.
Laxalt is expected to give Reagan a frank assessment on the mood
and capacity of the 68-year-old Marcos, who was elected president in
1965 and has remained in office since, including a 10-year period
during which he ruled by martial law. Administration officials said
that the question of whether the United States should back an altern
ative to Marcos had been "discussed within the government" but not
resolved.
Found Body May Be Klinghoffer
WASHINGTON — Syrian authorities have discovered the body of an
elderly man who washed ashore near the port city of Tartus, and
U.S. officials said yesterday they were seeking to learn if it was that
of Leon Klinghoffer, who was killed during last week's hijacking of
the Achille Lauro.
State Department press officer Dan Lawler said there was no im
mediate confirmation that the body was that of Klinghoffer, a 69-
year-old invalid from New York City who was a passenger aboard the
Italian cruise liner.
The Italian news agency AGI on Monday quoted legal sources in
volved in the interrogation of the four hijackers as saying Klinghof
fer's body "may have been found." The report said magistrates were
notified of the possible discovery during questioning of the four
prisoners.
Lawler said U.S. officials are seeking identification of the body. He
added that Syrian authorities have indicated they are willing to turn
the body over to U.S. custody if it is identified as that of an American
citizen.
Gorbachev Ousts Planning Head
MOSCOW — The man who has run the Soviet planning agency for
the past 20 years was replaced yesterday as Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev continued to assemble a new team in the Kremlin.
Nikolai Baibakov, 74, who had been named to the top economic
post by President Leonid Brezhnev in 1965, was retired on pension.
His successor is Nikolai Talyzin, 56, who has been the Soviet repre
sentative to Comecon, the East European trade organization. Ear
lier, he was minister of communications. The job of running
Gosplan, as the planning agency is known, entails centralized direc
tion of one of the world's largest economies.
Tass, the official news agency, said that Talyzin will become a first
deputy prime minister, indicating that the Gosplan director's job has
been upgraded from deputy prime minister, the rank Baibakov held.
