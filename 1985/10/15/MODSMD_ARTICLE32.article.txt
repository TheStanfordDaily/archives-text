## Abbas leaves Yugoslavia U.S. Vows To Capture Released Terrorist 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Federal officials yesterday
vowed to conduct a worldwide effort to capture
the suspected mastermind of the hijacking of the
Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro, Palestine
Liberation Front leader Mohammed Abbas
Zaida, who was released over the weekend by
Italian authorities despite a U.S. arrest warrant
issued against him.
Attorney General Edwin Meese 111 labeled
Abbas "an international criminal" and said the
United States would do everything possible to
capture him, including use of military force if cir
cumstances are right.
Following his release by Italian authorities
Saturday night, Abbas flew to Belgrade, Yugos
lavia. Reports last night indicated that he had left
Yugoslavia for an unknown destination.
Officials of the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion said that Abbas was no longer in Yugoslavia.
There was no independent confirmation of the
PLO statement, and the officials refused to say
where Abbas had gone or when he had left.
The Yugoslav decision to ignore urgent
demands from Washington to arrest Abbas had
been expected by Western diplomats and politi
cal analysts here.
Belgrade officials privately justified their re
jection of U.S. requests for Abbas' arrest'by
citing Article 202 of the Yugoslav constitution,
which guarantees safe conduct or political
asylum for "peoples fighting for the liberation of
their countries."
In private, officials said that Yugoslavia could
hardly be expected to detain Abbas and hand him

over to the United States when Italy, a U.S. ally
and member of the North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization, failed to act on a similar U.S. re
quest.
The Justice Department, meanwhile, has
charged the four hijackers of the Achille Lauro
with piracy, hostage-taking and conspiracy, even
though federal officials acknowledged yesterday
that it is unlikely that the pirates will be ex
tradited from Italy to stand trial in the United
States.
Abbas was captured Thursday night with the
four hijackers when the Egyptian 737 airliner in
which they were flying was forced to land on
Sicily by U.S. Navy jet fighters.
U.S. District Court Judge Charles Richey
signed arrest warrants late Saturday against Ab
bas and the four Palestinian hijackers in a
meeting with federal prosecutors at his Maryland
home. The warrants were based on an affidavit
outlining the government's evidence, which
remains sealed because it contains sensitive in
telligence information, according to federal
sources.
A source in the intelligence community who
reviewed the sealed allegations against Abbas
said the U.S. government appeared to have
evidence that Abbas participated in the planning
of a half-dozen terrorist attacks against
Americans.
"This was a bad-news guy," the source said.
"He basically was involved in planning
hijackings of Americans (and) we had enough to
arrest him and hold him for a hearing." On Friday

night, Richey initially had approved an arrest
warrant against Abbas in a telephone conversa
tion with Justice officials, who were mounting an
unsuccessful attempt to persuade Italian authori
ties to detain Abbas.
Despite the charges, it is unlikely that the
hijackers will face trial in the United States if the
Italians press ahead with prosecution, Justice of
ficials said. Italy has charged the four Pales
tinians with kidnapping, hijacking and the murder
of ship passenger Leon Klinghoffer, 69, of New
York.
Experts say the U.S.-Italian extradition treaty
bars prosecution in both countries for the same
acts. "If the Italians go ahead and prosecute,
there's no way Italy could extradite to us under
the treaty," said Michael Abbell, former director
of the Justice Department's Office of Interna
tional Affairs.
Federal officials said Italy breached the treaty
by letting Abbas go. They said the treaty re
quires Italy to hold a suspect sought by U.S.
authorities for up to 45 days pending hearings on
the request, but Italian officials unilaterally
decided to release Abbas, on grounds of insuffi
cient evidence. Asked if the United States
would use military tactics to capture Abbas as it
did to seize the four gunmen, Meese did not rule
it out, saying, "It all depends on the circum
stances."
FBI officials said they have dispatched two
teams of agents to Italy to assist in the investiga
tion, and that a forensic team is expected to ex
amine evidence aboard the Achille Lauro.
