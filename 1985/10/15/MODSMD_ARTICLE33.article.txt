# Americans Win Medicine Nobel
## 
### 
Two American scientists won the
1985 Nobel Prize in medicine yes
terday for research that
revolutionized scientific under
standing of the role of cholesterol in
heart disease and pointed the way
toward practical means of preven
tion and treatment.
The $225,000 award will be
shared jointly by molecular
geneticists Michael Brown, 44, and
Joseph Goldstein, 45, who first met
in 1966 during medical training in
Boston and have worked closely to
gether for more than a decade at
the University of Texas Health Sci
ence Center at Dallas.
The Nobel Assembly at Stock
holm's Karolinska Institute said the
Texas team had "revolutionized our

knowledge" about how the body
processes cholesterol, including the
genetic and dietary contributions to
the abnormal buildup of cholesterol
in the blood.
The institute said that the re
searchers' discoveries had "far
reaching implications" for the pre
vention and treatment of coronary
artery disease and heart attacks, "a
major cause of death in most indus
trialized countries."
Most coronary disease is the
result of hardening of the arteries,
or arteriosclerosis, in which ex
cessive fats and cholesterol in the
blood slowly clog the inner walls of
these \iessels. When a blood clot
blocks a narrowed artery, a heart
attack can result. Researchers have

long known that high blood choles
terol is a major risk factor for heart
disease, but the complex pathways
were difficult to unravel.
Cholesterol, which is crucial in
low levels to cell functioning, is
produced in the body,
predominantly in the liver, as well
as consumed in foods. It is carried
in the blood predominantly in parti
cles known as low-density
lipoproteins (LDL).
The Nobel citation noted that a
"milestone" occurred in 1973 when
Brown and Goldstein discovered
special receptors that regulate the
intake of LDL to the body's cells
from the blood. These receptors
operate as a sort of border patrol on
the surface of cells that control the
entrance of the LDL and thus the

amount of cholesterol entering the
cells.
Some individuals are genetically
predisposed toward high blood
cholesterol, an illness known as se
vere hereditary familial hyper
cholesteremia. Brown and
Goldstein found that an underlying
cause for this genetic disease is a
complete, or partial, lack of
working LDL receptors.
Goldstein is a bachelor from
Sumter, South Carolina who got his
medical degree at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical
School in Dallas, part of the health
science center. He met Brown, a
married native of New York, when
they both did internships and
residencies at Massachusetts Gen
eral Hospital in Boston.
