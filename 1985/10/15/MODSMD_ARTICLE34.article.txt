UAW Strike Looms
DETROIT — With little progress reported
in its labor talks with the United Auto
Workers, Chrysler faces a midnight contract
deadline tonight that could put its 70,000 U.S.
and 10,000 Canadian hourly workers out on
picket lines, forcing the No. 3 automaker to
shut down its North American operations just
as it is gearing up for the 1986 model year.
The negotiations were continuing at a slow
pace yesterday despite a weekend warning
from union President Owen Bieber that the
union was prepared to strike unless the com
pany stopped its foot-dragging in the talks,
which began in August. The union wants
Chrysler to pay once again wages and benefits
that are equal to those paid union workers at
General Motors and Ford, but the company's
economic proposals have so far failed to satisfy
the union's demands.
Reforms for Defense
WASHINGTON — The first comprehensive
attempt in more than a quarter century to
reform the way the Defense Department

spends money and prepares for war gets un
der way this week, led by a bipartisan jugger
naut on Capitol Hill.
Propelled by political, economic and
diplomatic pressures, the principal reforms will
be unveiled tomorrow by two traditional Pent
agon allies — Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.),
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Com
mittee, and Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), the com
mittee's senior Democrat. In a report that has
been two years in preparation, the senators
will propose overhauling the way weapons are
bought and streamlining the allegedly cum
bersome military chain of command.
Benefit Cheats Sought
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administra
tion, widening an already controversial dragnet
for welfare cheats and other federal
freeloaders, plans to seek broader authority to
use confidential tax data and other computer
files to double-check the claims of applicants
for five huge federal loan and benefit pro
grams.
The proposal, to be submitted to Congress
late next month, is drawing fire from civil liber

tarians and some legislators who worry that
the computer files could be misused or ex
panded into vast data banks on individual
citizens. But the Office of Management and
Budget dismisses the charge, saying the pro
gram could weed out as much as $300 million a
year in bogus and erroneous claims.
"This isn't an infringement, and we are ask
ing for very little in the way of records," Office
of Management and Budget spokesman Steve
Tupper said yesterday. "We're just asking for
the states to do a little more checking because
we're losing $300 million a year that's going
out to the wrong people."
