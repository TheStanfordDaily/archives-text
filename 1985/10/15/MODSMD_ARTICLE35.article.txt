Lotto Bidding Begins
SACRAMENTO — State lottery commis
sioners triggered a corporate scramble yester
day by calling for bids on an unprecedented
$200 million computer network for lotto-type
games that start in mid-1986.
Ten firms hope to meet the Nov. 8 deadline
on bidding to create the largest system of its
type in the nation, under what officials called
one of the biggest California state government
contracts ever, and the largest that will be
awarded by the lottery.
But two possible problems emerged at the
commission meeting.
Attorneys for one of the companies,
Electro-Sport Inc. of Costa Mesa, threatened

to seek a court injunction delaying the process
in a dispute over the financial disclosures that
the voter-approved lottery initiative requires
of bidders.
Lottery Director Mark Michalko said plans
call for one or two companies to be chosen by
the commission in December to install 5,000
terminals initially throughout the state so
retailers can log players' bets into central com
puters. New Jersey's 3,500-terminal system is
the largest currently.
Michalko said the four-year contract will
total more than $100 million, but then told
reporters after the session that the deal is
potentially worth up to $200 million.
The director said that in the initial California
lotto games, which should start by July 1,

players will select six numbers from a set field
of numbers, 40 for example.
Tanker Train Derails
LIVERMORE — A Union Pacific train car
rying a 12,000-gallon tank of chlorine derailed
yesterday near Livermore, but no injuries
were reported, said a spokesman for the
Alameda County Fire Department.
John Corrigan, the fire department's acting
captain, said six small grass fires were re
ported at about 4 a.m. along Union Pacific
tracks in an unincorporated area between
Livermore and Pleasanton.
