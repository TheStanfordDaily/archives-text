# Law School Revises Policy
## 
### ALLISON HARTWELL Editorial staff 
The faculty of the Stanford Law School voted
yesterday to ban all employers who discriminate
on the basis of sexual orientation from using the
law school facilities to recruit, according to Jack
Friedenthal, associate dean of the school.
The ban "makes no exceptions for federal
government," and would prevent the Central In
telligence Agency and the Army from recruiting
through the law school because they openly dis
criminate against gays and lesbians.
The law school's current policy, which re
quires all employers who discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation to say so in writing,
will be enforced until February. Despite this
grace period, Friedenthal said he suspects dis

criminatory employers will not come to campus
at all.
One of these employers, the Army, is sched
uled to conduct interviews at the law school later
this month. Army officials were unavailable for
comment last night.
Any employer found .guilty of discrimination on
any grounds — race, gender, religion or sexual
orientation — will be "barred from ever using
the facilities again if we catch them," Friedenthal
said.
Jose Gomez, executive director of La Raza
Centro Legal, Inc., a community law center in
San Francisco, had said his firm was planning a
boycott of the law school placement office and
would encourage other public service law firms
to do the same if the law school did not alter its
current policy. Gomez could not be reached for
comment last night.
Friedenthal said that the policy change was "in

response to students, not to an outside lawyer"
and that La Raza Centro was "not what spurred
us on."
But Mark Dupont, co-president of the Gay and
Lesbian Law Students Association, said La Raza
Centro deserves much of the credit toward the
decision and that it was "the t>ne that stimulated
discussion."
Dupont added that the law school faculty, the
University administration and law students
"came together" to reach the policy decision.
"I'm ecstatic," Dupont said, adding that the
law school was making "an absolute statement"
that gay and lesbian students have rights and
that the law school protects those rights. Dupont
said he hoped the decision would encourage the
"CIA, FBI and armed forces" to change their
discriminatory policy against homosexuals.
