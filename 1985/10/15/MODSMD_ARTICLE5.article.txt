# Shultz Urges Strong Action

### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
SAN FRANCISCO — The
United States and its allies must
fight terrorism with action rather
than hesitate for fear of terrorist
retaliation, Secretary of State
George Shultz told delegates at a
NATO conference here yesterday
morning.
"We must have the courage to
act, without violence if possible, but

also recognizing that violence is
sometimes necessary," Shultz said
at the 31st annual session of the
North Atlantic Assembly, the politi
cal arm of NATO represented by
184 legislators from 16 countries.
In the wake of the hijacking of the
Achille Lauro and the alleged killing
of an American during the incident,
Shultz lashed out against terrorists,
calling them "cowardly animals"
who "select the helpless to mur
der" and "lack the guts to do battle,
just as they lack the guts to seek

justice and peace by negotiation."
"When we get our hands on ter
rorists, we have to prosecute
them," Shultz said, drawing wide
applause. "We shouldn't hesitate
about that.
"Terrorists and the regimes that
support them aim to shatter our
ideals and pull down civilization it
self," he said. "If free people do not
move against the terrorists, no one
will stop them. We have to be ready
to act."
Shultz emphasized that the West

ern democracies must not resort to
terrorist acts in their fight against
terrorism. "We have to be willing to
take action in accordance with our
values," he said. "We aren't out to
turn ourselves into terrorists —
that would be a victory for them."
Shultz cited ways the Western
world could improve its ability to
fight terrorism. He said the
democracies "have to develop a
capacity to share intelligence" and
must work to improve security at
airports and to protect members of
the diplomatic community.
Shultz also drew applause during
the main part of his speech, which
focused on arms control, when he
announced that the United States
will limit space weapons defense re
search to comply with a "restrictive
interpretation" of the 1972 Anti-
Ballistic Missile Treaty.
"Our research program is and
will continue to be consistent with
the ABM Treaty," he said, in what
was clearly a response to recent
charges that the Reagan Adminis
tration plans to abrogate the ABM
Treaty with its Strategic Defense
Initiative, or "Star Wars," program.
But he tempered his statement
by noting that the Administration
does not agree with the restrictive
interpretation that it has chosen to
follow.
"The treaty can be variously in
terpreted as to what kinds of devel
opment and testing are permitted,"
he said. "It is our view, based on a
careful analysis of the treaty text
and the negotiating record, that a
broader interpretation of our au
thority is fully justified."
The ABM Treaty allows for re
search into anti-missile defenses
but prohibits testing, development
and deployment of most kinds of
anti-ballistic missile systems, in
cluding the space-based systems
that would be used in the SDI pro
gram.
Shultz reaffirmed the Administra
tion's stance on refraining from
deployment of strategic defense
systems.
"Any SDI deployment would be

the subject of consultations with
our allies, and to discussion and
negotiation, as appropriate, with
the Soviets in accordance with the
terms of the ABM Treaty," Shultz
said.
Shultz reviewed for the NATO
parliamentarians the Administra
tion's approach to arms control and
its view of the Soviet proposal pre
sented formally in the Geneva arms
talks two weeks ago. He stressed
that the Administration is commit
ted to continuing SDI research and
does not view the program as a
"bargaining chip."
He called the Soviet proposal for
a 50 percent cut in strategic nuclear
forces "deeply flawed and self
serving," saying that the Soviets
unfairly exclude their intermediate
range missiles from the list of
weapons systems that can strike
the adversary's territory.
In addition, he assailed a Soviet
call for a ban on new nuclear
delivery systems, saying that Mos
cow has several such systems
ready to deploy,- while the United
States has several that are further
away from deployment.
"Assuming the agreed date
would not be in the past, such a ban
Would preclude our Midgetman
missile, D-5 Trident submarine
missile and Stealth bomber," he
said, and then ad-libbed, "It's a hell
of a deal."
The secretary, citing Soviet stra
tegic defense and anti-satellite pro
grams, dismissed Soviet
propaganda against U.S. programs
as "blatantly one-sided and not to
be taken seriously."
"Their propaganda about the
'militarization of space' rings rather
hollow when one considers that
they have the world's most active
military space program," he said.
