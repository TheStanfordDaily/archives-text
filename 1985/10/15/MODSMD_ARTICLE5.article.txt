### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
SAN FRANCISCO — The
United States and its allies must
fight terrorism with action rather
than hesitate for fear of terrorist
retaliation, Secretary of State
George Shultz told delegates at a
NATO conference here yesterday
morning.
"We must have the courage to
act, without violence if possible, but

also recognizing that violence is
sometimes necessary," Shultz said
at the 31st annual session of the
North Atlantic Assembly, the politi
cal arm of NATO represented by
184 legislators from 16 countries.
In the wake of the hijacking of the
Achille Lauro and the alleged killing
of an American during the incident,
Shultz lashed out against terrorists,
calling them "cowardly animals"
who "select the helpless to mur
der" and "lack the guts to do battle,
just as they lack the guts to seek

justice and peace by negotiation."
"When we get our hands on ter
rorists, we have to prosecute
them," Shultz said, drawing wide
applause. "We shouldn't hesitate
about that.
"Terrorists and the regimes that
support them aim to shatter our
ideals and pull down civilization it
self," he said. "If free people do not
move against the terrorists, no one
will stop them. We have to be ready
to act."
Shultz emphasized that the West

ern democracies must not resort to
terrorist acts in their fight against
terrorism. "We have to be willing to
take action in accordance with our
values," he said. "We aren't out to
turn ourselves into terrorists —
that would be a victory for them."
Shultz cited ways the Western
world could improve its ability to
fight terrorism. He said the
democracies "have to develop a
capacity to share intelligence" and
