# It's Always Been a Matter of Honor

"ln the government of the University, the
largest liberty consistent with good work and
good order will be given to the students. The
University is not a reform school; its bounty is
intended for the earnest and industrious student,
and the indolent or unworthy will not be retained
in the institution."
President David Starr Jordan said this about
the University back in 1891, the same year the
school opened for the first time. It was a per
sonal view, but it was something else, too â€” the
foundation for Stanford's Honor Code, the idea
that responsibility for just and ethical behavior in
the academic life of the campus resides first and
foremost with the student body.
In the early years, however, the active judicial
role was assumed by the president along with
the Academic Council, which represented the
voting body of the faculty. In 1911-12, the Fac
ulty Committee on Student Affairs entered into
an agreement with the existing student organiza
tions by which the responsibility for the govern
ment of students and for upholding University
standards would be delegated to student judicial
councils.
One result of this movement for increasing
student responsibility was the desire in the late
teens to experiment with an honor code. In the
spring of 1921, the students culminated their

seven-year campaign for the establishment of a
campus-wide honor code in the form of individu
ally signed petitions to the faculty. The issue was
raised to the Academic Council on May 23 of that
year. The adopted proposal as recorded in the
minutes of that council meeting included the fol
lowing points:
1. Responsibility for honesty in the conduct of
examinations is assumed by the students of the
University, such responsibility to be known as
the Honor Code.
2. The primary responsibility for the Honor
Code rests upon each individual student who is
pledged not to receive or give aid in examina
tions.
3. Infractions of the Honor Code shall be dealt
with by the student councils in the same manner
as other cases of discipline.
4. The instructor shall provide a room where
the examination may be held. . . . After the
questions have been presented and inquiries an
swered the instructor shall withdraw from the
room.
With the presentation of this proposal at the
council meeting came a certain amount of skep
ticism on the part of the faculty. Such an attitude
cast a shadow of doubt over the ability of the
Honor Code to survive and succeed against
practical experience. The commendable momen
tum of the students' campaign gave the move
ment positive force, however, and lead the fac

ulty to grant a trial period.
Enthusiasm in support of the Honor Code con
tinued relatively unabated until the years during
World War 11. Civilian enrollment decreased sig
nificantly, and the number of uniform-clad stu
dents on campus grew, expanding the diversity
of the student body.
In 1945, under the Wilbur presidency, the Of
fice of the Dean of Students was established, re
ceiving much of the responsibility with respect to
student conduct previously carried by the presi
dent. The Dean of Students acted on recommen
dations from the students through the ASSU
Judicial Council.
H. Donald Winbigler, dean of students during
the '50s, recalled the attitude of the students at
the time was "that the Honor Code required
honesty and openness in responding to questions
from a duly constituted body of one's peers,
even though it might involve self-incrimination.
In fact, students who, in moments of weakness
made mistakes, in the majority of cases, re
garded it as the honorable thing to do to admit
thier errors candidly when confronted with
evidence of them."
According to Winbigler, who offered in sum
mary observations on the Honor Code in 1976,
"The central operational meaning of the Stanford
Honor Code is the delegation to the students of
primary responsiblity for honesty in academic
work."
