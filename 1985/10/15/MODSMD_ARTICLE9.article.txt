# Country may head for 'radical socialism'
## Prof. Warns of Approaching Korean Crisis 
### FELICIA PAIK 
Yang-Pyo Hong, a visiting scholar from
South Korea, said yesterday that his country
could become "radically socialist" if
democracy isn't restored there.
"Korea has developed rapidly intellectually
and economically but is politically backward,"
said Hong in a speech at the Bechtel Interna
tional Center.
Hong, a professor of political science at
Kyung Pook National University, said South
Korea has not had a peaceful transition of
power since 1948. "The constitution is the
core problem in Korean democracy," he said.
Hong stated that after each election since
1948 the South Korean president has
changed the constitution to meet his needs.
"If I was asked, 'Is Korea a democracy?' I
would flatly say no. Democracy is a relative
term," said Hong. "Democracy is govern
ment by the law made in the environment of

freedom, but instead there is an environment
of martial law (in South Korea)."
Currently, several small but influential
dissident student groups are voicing opinions
and demonstrating for "the three people's
struggles, which are democracy, populism
and nationalism." Hong stated the students
"wish to restore the people's right. People
must be inititated and create their own cul
ture. The students are idealized; they are in
favor of socialism, anti-capitalism and the new
left.
"If things go on like this, my country will
easily become radically socialist if we don't
restore democracy," Hong said. "My country
is in a terrible crisis, and it needs attention.
The Korean government is not really govern
ment; it's on temporary duty and needs to
yield to democracy."
Hong concluded, "I am a pacifist. I don't
want anything done through violent means,
but democracy needs to be restored (to
South Korea)."
