most none of whom are ASSU Senators or COP
people — look at the proposals. They see if the
budgets are accurate and realistic. They see
which (and how many) students benefit from
the money. They estimate the cost per student of
the proposal. They make a first decision about
how much money to give each group.
These recommendations are passed on to the
, Appropriations Committee of the ASSU Senate.
This committee looks over each proposal again,
hears any comments anyone may have about
the Board's recommendations, and adds up the
total cost of the proposed funding. This com
mittee also decides how big this total cost should
be.
The whole thing then goes to the ASSU Se
nate, which makes the final decision, including
how much money should go into the Boards in
total. This gets put on the PTR, without petitions
or a vote in the Spring election. Last March, the
Senate did all this, and the result is the $4 Pro
gram Board and $1 Pub Board fee you see on
your PTR.
Many groups have good ideas more often than
annually, and so they need to apply for funding
in the middle of a year. Both the Program and
Pub boards have a discretionary fund for just this
purpose. The entire process is repeated, in mini
ature, twice a quarter.
Of course, everyone wants money, especially
when it's free. And no-one wants to pay more
on their PTR than they have to. This guarantees
that demand for funding will exceed supply, and
