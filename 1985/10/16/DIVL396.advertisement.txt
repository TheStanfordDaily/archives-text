priorities. Also, you decided to approve all of the
Special Fees on your PTR, but you didn't get a
chance to approve the Board recommendations.
So the Boards and the Senate have a number of
things they will not fund.
These priorities and rules have been passed
down orally from Board to Board and from Se
nate to Senate. The Appropriations Committee is
now codifying those standards, as much as we
can without losing flexibility. We face a number
of questions: should we permit your tax money
to be donated to charity? What sort of publicity
is appropriate, and what is extravagant? Should
we fund a telephone for each group, or should
we encourage them to share? When we have to
choose, should we give money to the group that
has the most members or the one that has the
fewer alternatives? And should we concentrate
on funding more or taxing less?
Next week, the Appropriations Committee
will be holding public meetings to decide ques
tions like these. Since it is your money at issue,
we would like you to help us decide. Check Once
Around the Quad for meeting times and places. Or
write to me: Jim DeLaHunt, ASSU Senate, Tre
sidder Union, Stanford. If the editor lets me, I
will publish a summary of the results in a future
issue of [he ASSU News. Until then, enjoy Stan
ford's student organizations â€” and remember
that, through the Program and Pub Boards, as
well as through your Special Fees, you are
helping to finance them.
Jim DeLaHunt
Chair of the Appropriations Committee of the ASSU Senate
