Who knows what goes on behind closed doors?
Writer seeks inside information on animal labora
tory experiments at Stanford. People who know
won't talk. Animal lovers who want to know are
hermetically sealed off. Isn't torture in the name of
science still torture? It's time for animal lovers &
those who have worked on animal experimenta
tion and quit in disgust at the inhumane treatment,
to speak up. Write Box 51932, Pacific Grove, CA
93950. All replies confidential.
