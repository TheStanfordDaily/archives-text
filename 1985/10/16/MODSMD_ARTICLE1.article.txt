# USW Votes to Strike in 9 Days
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Staff writer 
In a 521-130 vote yesterday, United Stan
ford Workers decided to strike if the University
fails to present the union with an acceptable con
tract by Oct. 25.
The union also agreed to an earlier request by
the University for a federal mediator. USW has
argued in the past that it was too early for a
mediator to be of any help, said Mary Ann
Tenuto, chief USW negotiator.
Federal mediation is "long overdue," said
Priscilla Wheeler, chief negotiator and staff coun
sel for the University, in a press release.
The affirmative strike vote was a "rejection of
the University's demands for reduction of job se
curity," said Tenuto.

The University was critical of the union's deci
sion. "We think it's irresponsible of the union to
be talking strike at this point," said Wheeler.
The decision is "discouraging," said Douglas
Dupen, a member of the University's
negotiating team. Dupen warned that the two
sides are too far apart for the union to be making
strike deadlines.
A strike usually is not threatened until the
"feathered end" is reached, he added.
"We think the fact that we're no further along
is [the University's] fault and that's what Ithe
union members] decided to set a time limit to,"
Tenuto countered.
Tenuto would not predict the chances of a
strike, but she did say that if real progress is
made, the bargaining team has the power to con
tinue negotiations.
"We are going to use that authority very

sparingly," Tenuto warned.
If the 950 USW members were to strike, it
would affect all technical, service and mainte
nance areas, including food service, grounds and
housing, but the University would continue to
operate, Wheeler said.
The University would staff strike-affected
areas with supervisors and temporary workers
in order to continue feeding and housing stu
dents, she said.
In the event of a strike, "we will try to see as
little disruption as possible," Wheeler added.
Negotiations, which have been sluggish in the
past, "made very, very little movement" at the
most recent talks, held Saturday, according to
Dupen, who is also director of personnel at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
At Saturday's meeting the union
agreed for the first time to the Uni
versity's request to negotiate a three
year contract, Tenuto said.
USW offered a new wage proposal,
which would mean a 9.4 percent in
crease of the union's $33.6 million
wage base in the first year, to be fol
lowed by 8.2 percent and 7.5 percent
increases.
The total cost would be a 25.1 per
cent increase that is far from the Uni
versity's proposed, three-year 9.5
percent increase.
The union also made a concession
in changing their pension proposal.
Previously, the union had sought to
have pensions calculated using
salaries in 1980. Now, it is seeking to
have them computed using salaries in
1976, Tenuto said.
In other areas of conflict, both
sides have filed charges relating to in
dividual worker protests.
The University charged that USW
encouraged workers "to engage in
unprotected activity, including slow
downs, sickouts and partial or inter
mitent strikes," according to a
University press release.
At the same time, the union has
charged that the University has
"disciplined people indiscriminately,"
according to Tenuto.
The two sides will hold their next
meeting tomorrow.
