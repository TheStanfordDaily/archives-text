# Limited Star Wars Plan Feasible, Says Anderson
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
A limited "Star Wars" defense
system is proven to be technologi
cally attainable and effective when
tied to a bargaining strategy, ac
cording to Martin Anderson, a
Hoover Institution senior fellow and
former chief domestic policy ad
viser to President Reagan.
"What we are talking about is not
a question of what is technologically
feasible, but simply a question of
philosophy, politics and basic cal
culus," Anderson said. "What we
thought was possible in terms of
cost and reliability in defense sys
tems is changing rapidly."
Anderson told an overflow Roble
Hall audience last night that the im
plementation of President Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI)
will protect the United States from
the "increasing" possibility of an ac
cidental Soviet or intentional terror
ist missile attack.
Under existing conditions, a U.S.
president would be faced with
choosing among several difficult
response options, Anderson said.
"You should never have a person
in a position to make (those) kind of
choices," he said.
Anderson supplemented his com
ments with an exclusive videotape
of a successful test of a limited anti
missile system conducted in June
1984.
A complete SDI system is a bet
ter alternative to the existing
"mutual destruction" concept that
now characterizes U.S. and Soviet
planning, Anderson said.
"Philosophically, there's some
thing very unsatisfying about the
idea of defense that says 'if you an
nihilate us, we annihilate you,' "

Anderson said.
The Soviets have been working
"for many years" on a similar sys
tem and already have a limited anti
missile system surrounding Mos
cow, according to Anderson.
"They're pursuing this
[technology] with a great deal of
dedication and skill," he said.
"They're racing ahead."
Although a negotiated mutual re
duction in nuclear weapons would

"sharply reduce the chances" of
conflict, Anderson said the in
creased reliability and mobility of
Soviet missile systems clouds that
assumption.
The final outcome of the tech
nological race will be more
desirable than the current state, he
predicted.
Arms reduction talks would only
be successful when coupled with an
"understanding of what motivates
the Soviets" and the restoration of
a "margin of safety" in U.S. military
capability, Anderson said.
