In at least one department of the University, dis
crimination based on sexual orientation has joined
the list of undesirable employment practices along
with discrimination on the basis of sex, race or reli
gion.
The Law School's decision to ban all employers
who discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation
from using Law School facilities to recruit is the next
logical step from the current policy — enforced until
February — that requires such employers to admit
in writing that they discriminate.
The ban makes no exceptions for the federal gov
ernment, according to Jack Friedenthal, associate
dean of the Law School, and would prevent the
Central Intelligence Agency and the Army from
recruiting through the Law School.
The Law School, as a place that educates those
who form the laws of this nation, is an appropriate
institution to take a strong stand against discrimina
tion. But it should not stand alone.
The business school also has a policy — stated in
their '85-'B6 publication on recruiting practices —

that forbids employers who discriminate on the
basis of "sexual preference" from conducting inter
views at the school.
The Career Planning and Placement Center,
however, simply abides by the federal regulations
on discrimination. Any employer who discriminates
on the basis of sex, race, creed, age, national origin
or handicap is not allowed to recruit through the
CPPC, the main recruiting resource of the Univer
sity, according to the director, Christopher
Shinkman.
Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is
noticeably absent from that list.
Although students are free to seek employment
wherever they wish, the University should not be
an accomplice to discrimination by allowing dis
criminatory employers to use its resources in
recruiting students.
The University should now implement a blanket
policy excluding employers who discriminate on the
basis of sexual preference from recruiting on
campus.
