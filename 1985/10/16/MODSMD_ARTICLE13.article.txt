## Motives for Civil Disobedience Not 'Chic' or Trendy 
### 
Last year, University President Donald
Kennedy told the press, including Time
magazine, that the protesters engaging in
civil disobedience just wanted to get ar
rested to be "chic." A few days after he
made this statement, I was one of the nine
anti-apartheid protesters who was arrested
for civil disobedience and who remained in
jail on a hunger strike. I don't know how
Kennedy defines the term "chic," but fas
ting behind bars for four days is not my idea
of trendiness. Furthermore, we didn't just
want to get arrested.

VIEWPOINT

If we had just wanted to get arrested, it
would have been a lot easier to beat some
body over the head than to sit in an office
for four hours silently in solidarity with all
who have been silenced by apartheid. What
we wanted was for this University to take
on moral leadership and realize that it is in
consistent for a university founded on
humanitarian principles to be funded by a
system of white supremacy and systematic
extermination.
It is a humiliating experience to be ar
rested. Last year we were strip-searched
about three times a day while herded from
jail to jail. Officer Michael Seamons of the
Stanford police found it humorous to in
timidate and humiliate us — especially
those of us of a different race than he. After
asking if I was "Latin," he asked if I had
been in any "street gangs." Then he told
one student that if he didn't sit down, he
would "beat him over the head and
shoulders." This was all in jest, but none of
us found it particularly amusing.
In the main jail at San Jose, we also pro
vided entertainment for the guards. They
relished calling each Stanford student
"idiot" followed by the number they had

marked on his wrist. I was "idiot number
5."
However, this verbal abuse was kid
glove treatment compared to their treat
ment of the other prisoners, especially
minorities. When one intoxicated man
wouldn't open his fist to be fingerprinted,
the guards twisted his arm behind his neck,
grabbed him by the hair and smashed his
head against the counter. When he still
refused to open his fist, they dragged him
into solitary confinement. Over his screams
I could hear the guards yell, "We're going to
break your fucking arm!" After a few
minutes they let him go, and I saw the two
guards come out of the room with huge
grins. At that point, as I looked out through
the bars all I remember feeling was a wave
of numbness, an empty feeling that perhaps
there is no humanity in any of us. Perhaps
we were fighting a losing battle in trying to
make this a more humane society. Perhaps
we weren't making a difference.
Last week I was arrested again. This
time I went into the sit-in with the same
feeling of numbness. I smiled weakly when
the Stanford policeman that was filming us
said that the police were going to "drag" us
"by the hairs" if we went limp because he
didn't want to work overtime. Since I had
already heard these kinds of threats, I paid
no attention to them this time around. The
numb feeling was with me as I looked at the
face of Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer. He read the five misdemeanor
crimes we were supposedly committing and
then proceeded to read the University's
Fundamental Standard. I observed the face
of Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons as
he answered questions about "showing
respect for order, honor and morality both
within and without the University."
The whole absurdity of the situation fi
nally led me to ask "Why don't your rules
apply as much to those who charted them

and enforce them? Shouldn't rules apply as
much to the powerful as to the powerless?
The day the Board of Trustees shows
respect for honor and morality will be the
day you can justifiably threaten us with
suspension for breaking your noble stan
dard." I remembered his quote in The Daily
last year about how he considered it im
proper to drop the charges against us be
cause it would not be right to "give stu
dents preferential treatment." Last year I
dismissed his statement with a quip about
how relieved I was that Stanford was a
democratic institution. This year, I realized
what he meant. He meant that next time
we protested against Stanford's invest
ments in apartheid in a way which dis
obeyed the administration's authority, we
were to be treated as common criminals
and used as examples.
As I waited in an office to be booked, a
black student, Robby Perkins, was dragged
on the floor, his hands pressed behind his
arched back. Oddly enough, his position
suddenly reminded me of an Egyptian
hieroglyphic that I had once seen in a
museum — it portrayed an enslaved pris
oner of war under the feet of his opponent.
Robby let out a sharp scream as two Stan
ford cops twisted his arm to lift him up. I
stood up and shouted, "I know you're all
paid to practice legalized violence, but why
do you have to h irt him?" One cop with a
thick moustache, Sgt. Nick Bruno, ex
plained, "I'm not hurting him, he's hurting
me." Cam Baker, who was sitting next to
me shot back, "Oh yeah, then why don't I
hear you screaming in pain?"
The next student to be brought in was
sobbing uncontrollably while a cop applied
pressure on his wrist. "Just remember that
millions of South Africans have gone
through this," I said to him. "You are doing
it for them." He nodded his head, still
crying.

Marvin Moore, Stanford's only black
police captain, said, "Look, he's refusing to
cooperate. We're only doing our job." My
numb feeling returned as I asked him with a
weak smile, "Isn't that exactly what the
Nazis said? Isn't that what the Jewish
Kapos who collaborated with the Nazis
said? I wonder if the blacks who collaborate
with the white South Africans also say
that." Moore didn't reply. He didn't look me
in the eye.
Meanwhile another cop was telling Peter
Heslin in a very calm, soothing voice,
"Look, if you don't walk on your own we'll
have to carry you. You might fall on your
head. You're only hurting yourself. It's your
choice, either you hurt yourself or you
don't," reasoned the Stanford cop.
Again, I felt numb. I continued to feel this
way until we arrived at the police station.
Cam and I, two of the students who had not
been dragged into the police car, had to
wait inside the car for about 30 minutes. At
that time, I didn't know the reason for this
was because Robby had been dragged out
of the police van by his neck. I also did not
know that he had been taken into solitary
confinement, stripped and beaten in the
face. When we went inside the police sta
tion, all I saw were a few cops with their
sick grins talking about the "stupid Stanford
student that doesn't want to learn."
I began to fight the feeling of absurdity by
laughing. Cam and I began to crack jokes
about our criminality. I also burst out laugh
ing when I remembered that I had listed
Donald Kennedy as a contact person in case
of death or emergency. I wondered if he
would personally come pick us up or if he
would send an underling if the cops decided
one of us hadn't learned our lesson well
enough.
At that point the sergeant shouted at us,
"The game is over clowns! Do you under
stand me?" I remained silent. "Answer me

with a 'yes sir,' clowns. Do you under
stand?" he shouted. I looked at him straight
in the eyes almost as if he didn't exist. He
shouted his command various times, but
when I would not answer him, he came
around the counter and poked his pen in my
chest. He made a signal to the Stanford
sheriff who began squeezing Cam up
against the wall with his body weight. Then
the cop who was going to drive us to the
main San Jose prison came into the room
saying, "Are these the apartheid
protesters? Shit. Fucking smart-ass kids.
Because of you I ain't with my lady tonight.
Assholes!"
After the sergeant grabbed my arm and
shouted his command again, I asked him,
"Why do you feel you have to humiliate us?"
For a moment I had the illusion that he
heard my question. When he shouted his
command once more, I realized that if I
didn't answer 'yes sir,' he would probably
drag me into solitary confinement.
Yet I was not in prison to be a martyr. I
was not there to take punishment for my
cause as Kennedy had so presumptuously
recommended we do last year. Why should
I be treated like a criminal? Only in a white
supremist society are you treated like a
criminal for protesting apartheid. I don't
think we should have been treated like
criminals in Nicaragua for protesting apart
heid. Why should I be punished when it is
those in the power structure that are
guilty? If anyone should take punishment
for their cause it should be the people who
care more about profits than about the
welfare of other human beings.
I decided I could answer "I understand,"
and still retain my integrity. A feeling of
nausea overwhelmed me. I understood only
too well that South Africa was not so far
away.

what he meant. He meant that next time
we protested against Stanford's invest
ments in apartheid in a way which dis
obeyed the administration's authority, we
were to be treated as common criminals
and used as examples.
As I waited in an office to be booked, a
black student, Robby Perkins, was dragged
on the floor, his hands pressed behind his
arched back. Oddly enough, his position
suddenly reminded me of an Egyptian
hieroglyphic that I had once seen in a
museum — it portrayed an enslaved pris
oner of war under the feet of his opponent.
Robby let out a sharp scream as two Stan
ford cops twisted his arm to lift him up. I
stood up and shouted, "I know you're all
paid to practice legalized violence, but why
do you have to h irt him?" One cop with a
thick moustache, Sgt. Nick Bruno, ex
plained, "I'm not hurting him, he's hurting
me." Cam Baker, who was sitting next to
me shot back, "Oh yeah, then why don't I
hear you screaming in pain?"
The next student to be brought in was
sobbing uncontrollably while a cop applied
pressure on his wrist. "Just remember that
millions of South Africans have gone
through this," I said to him. "You are doing
it for them." He nodded his head, still
crying.

Marvin Moore, Stanford's only black
police captain, said, "Look, he's refusing to
cooperate. We're only doing our job." My
numb feeling returned as I asked him with a
weak smile, "Isn't that exactly what the
Nazis said? Isn't that what the Jewish
Kapos who collaborated with the Nazis
said? I wonder if the blacks who collaborate
with the white South Africans also say
that." Moore didn't reply. He didn't look me
in the eye.
Meanwhile another cop was telling Peter
Heslin in a very calm, soothing voice,
"Look, if you don't walk on your own we'll
have to carry you. You might fall on your
head. You're only hurting yourself. It's your
choice, either you hurt yourself or you
don't," reasoned the Stanford cop.
Again, I felt numb. I continued to feel this
way until we arrived at the police station.
Cam and I, two of the students who had not
been dragged into the police car, had to
wait inside the car for about 30 minutes. At
that time, I didn't know the reason for this
was because Robby had been dragged out
of the police van by his neck. I also did not
know that he had been taken into solitary
confinement, stripped and beaten in the
face. When we went inside the police sta
tion, all I saw were a few cops with their
sick grins talking about the "stupid Stanford
student that doesn't want to learn."
I began to fight the feeling of absurdity by
laughing. Cam and I began to crack jokes
about our criminality. I also burst out laugh
ing when I remembered that I had listed
Donald Kennedy as a contact person in case
of death or emergency. I wondered if he
would personally come pick us up or if he
would send an underling if the cops decided
one of us hadn't learned our lesson well
enough.
At that point the sergeant shouted at us,
"The game is over clowns! Do you under
stand me?" I remained silent. "Answer me

with a 'yes sir,' clowns. Do you under
stand?" he shouted. I looked at him straight
in the eyes almost as if he didn't exist. He
shouted his command various times, but
when I would not answer him, he came
around the counter and poked his pen in my
chest. He made a signal to the Stanford
sheriff who began squeezing Cam up
against the wall with his body weight. Then
the cop who was going to drive us to the
main San Jose prison came into the room
saying, "Are these the apartheid
protesters? Shit. Fucking smart-ass kids.
Because of you I ain't with my lady tonight.
Assholes!"
After the sergeant grabbed my arm and
shouted his command again, I asked him,
"Why do you feel you have to humiliate us?"
For a moment I had the illusion that he
heard my question. When he shouted his
command once more, I realized that if I
didn't answer 'yes sir,' he would probably
drag me into solitary confinement.
Yet I was not in prison to be a martyr. I
was not there to take punishment for my
cause as Kennedy had so presumptuously
recommended we do last year. Why should
I be treated like a criminal? Only in a white
supremist society are you treated like a
criminal for protesting apartheid. I don't
think we should have been treated like
criminals in Nicaragua for protesting apart
heid. Why should I be punished when it is
those in the power structure that are
guilty? If anyone should take punishment
for their cause it should be the people who
care more about profits than about the
welfare of other human beings.
I decided I could answer "I understand,"
and still retain my integrity. A feeling of
nausea overwhelmed me. I understood only
too well that South Africa was not so far
away.

Last year, University President Donald
Kennedy told the press, including Time
magazine, that the protesters engaging in
civil disobedience just wanted to get ar
rested to be "chic." A few days after he
made this statement, I was one of the nine
anti-apartheid protesters who was arrested
for civil disobedience and who remained in
jail on a hunger strike. I don't know how
Kennedy defines the term "chic," but fas
ting behind bars for four days is not my idea
of trendiness. Furthermore, we didn't just
want to get arrested.

VIEWPOINT

If we had just wanted to get arrested, it
would have been a lot easier to beat some
body over the head than to sit in an office
for four hours silently in solidarity with all
who have been silenced by apartheid. What
we wanted was for this University to take
on moral leadership and realize that it is in
consistent for a university founded on
humanitarian principles to be funded by a
system of white supremacy and systematic
extermination.
It is a humiliating experience to be ar
rested. Last year we were strip-searched
about three times a day while herded from
jail to jail. Officer Michael Seamons of the
Stanford police found it humorous to in
timidate and humiliate us — especially
those of us of a different race than he. After
asking if I was "Latin," he asked if I had
been in any "street gangs." Then he told
one student that if he didn't sit down, he
would "beat him over the head and
shoulders." This was all in jest, but none of
us found it particularly amusing.
In the main jail at San Jose, we also pro
vided entertainment for the guards. They
relished calling each Stanford student
"idiot" followed by the number they had

marked on his wrist. I was "idiot number
5."
However, this verbal abuse was kid
glove treatment compared to their treat
ment of the other prisoners, especially
minorities. When one intoxicated man
wouldn't open his fist to be fingerprinted,
the guards twisted his arm behind his neck,
grabbed him by the hair and smashed his
head against the counter. When he still
refused to open his fist, they dragged him
into solitary confinement. Over his screams
I could hear the guards yell, "We're going to
break your fucking arm!" After a few
minutes they let him go, and I saw the two
guards come out of the room with huge
grins. At that point, as I looked out through
the bars all I remember feeling was a wave
of numbness, an empty feeling that perhaps
there is no humanity in any of us. Perhaps
we were fighting a losing battle in trying to
make this a more humane society. Perhaps
we weren't making a difference.
Last week I was arrested again. This
time I went into the sit-in with the same
feeling of numbness. I smiled weakly when
the Stanford policeman that was filming us
said that the police were going to "drag" us
"by the hairs" if we went limp because he
didn't want to work overtime. Since I had
already heard these kinds of threats, I paid
no attention to them this time around. The
numb feeling was with me as I looked at the
face of Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer. He read the five misdemeanor
crimes we were supposedly committing and
then proceeded to read the University's
Fundamental Standard. I observed the face
of Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons as
he answered questions about "showing
respect for order, honor and morality both
within and without the University."
The whole absurdity of the situation fi
nally led me to ask "Why don't your rules
apply as much to those who charted them

and enforce them? Shouldn't rules apply as
much to the powerful as to the powerless?
The day the Board of Trustees shows
respect for honor and morality will be the
day you can justifiably threaten us with
suspension for breaking your noble stan
dard." I remembered his quote in The Daily
last year about how he considered it im
proper to drop the charges against us be
cause it would not be right to "give stu
dents preferential treatment." Last year I
dismissed his statement with a quip about
how relieved I was that Stanford was a
democratic institution. This year, I realized
what he meant. He meant that next time
we protested against Stanford's invest
ments in apartheid in a way which dis
obeyed the administration's authority, we

heard my question. When he shouted his
command once more, I realized that if I
didn't answer 'yes sir,' he would probably
drag me into solitary confinement.
Yet I was not in prison to be a martyr. I
was not there to take punishment for my
cause as Kennedy had so presumptuously
recommended we do last year. Why should
I be treated like a criminal? Only in a white
supremist society are you treated like a
criminal for protesting apartheid. I don't
think we should have been treated like
criminals in Nicaragua for protesting apart
heid. Why should I be punished when it is
those in the power structure that are
guilty? If anyone should take punishment
for their cause it should be the people who
care more about profits than about the
welfare of other human beings.
I decided I could answer "I understand,"
and still retain my integrity. A feeling of
nausea overwhelmed me. I understood only
too well that South Africa was not so far
away.

Last year, University President Donald
Kennedy told the press, including Time
magazine, that the protesters engaging in
civil disobedience just wanted to get ar
rested to be "chic." A few days after he
made this statement, I was one of the nine
anti-apartheid protesters who was arrested
for civil disobedience and who remained in
jail on a hunger strike. I don't know how
Kennedy defines the term "chic," but fas
ting behind bars for four days is not my idea
of trendiness. Furthermore, we didn't just
want to get arrested.

VIEWPOINT

If we had just wanted to get arrested, it
would have been a lot easier to beat some
body over the head than to sit in an office
for four hours silently in solidarity with all
who have been silenced by apartheid. What
we wanted was for this University to take
on moral leadership and realize that it is in
consistent for a university founded on
humanitarian principles to be funded by a
system of white supremacy and systematic
extermination.
It is a humiliating experience to be ar
rested. Last year we were strip-searched
about three times a day while herded from
jail to jail. Officer Michael Seamons of the
Stanford police found it humorous to in
timidate and humiliate us — especially
those of us of a different race than he. After
asking if I was "Latin," he asked if I had
been in any "street gangs." Then he told
one student that if he didn't sit down, he
would "beat him over the head and
shoulders." This was all in jest, but none of
us found it particularly amusing.
In the main jail at San Jose, we also pro
vided entertainment for the guards. They
relished calling each Stanford student
"idiot" followed by the number they had

marked on his wrist. I was "idiot number
5."
However, this verbal abuse was kid
glove treatment compared to their treat
ment of the other prisoners, especially
minorities. When one intoxicated man
wouldn't open his fist to be fingerprinted,
the guards twisted his arm behind his neck,
grabbed him by the hair and smashed his
head against the counter. When he still
refused to open his fist, they dragged him
into solitary confinement. Over his screams
I could hear the guards yell, "We're going to
break your fucking arm!" After a few
minutes they let him go, and I saw the two
guards come out of the room with huge
grins. At that point, as I looked out through
the bars all I remember feeling was a wave
of numbness, an empty feeling that perhaps
there is no humanity in any of us. Perhaps
we were fighting a losing battle in trying to
make this a more humane society. Perhaps
we weren't making a difference.
Last week I was arrested again. This
time I went into the sit-in with the same
feeling of numbness. I smiled weakly when
the Stanford policeman that was filming us
said that the police were going to "drag" us
"by the hairs" if we went limp because he
didn't want to work overtime. Since I had
already heard these kinds of threats, I paid
no attention to them this time around. The
numb feeling was with me as I looked at the
face of Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer. He read the five misdemeanor
crimes we were supposedly committing and
then proceeded to read the University's
Fundamental Standard. I observed the face
of Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons as
he answered questions about "showing
respect for order, honor and morality both
within and without the University."
The whole absurdity of the situation fi
nally led me to ask "Why don't your rules
apply as much to those who charted them

and enforce them? Shouldn't rules apply as
much to the powerful as to the powerless?
The day the Board of Trustees shows
respect for honor and morality will be the
day you can justifiably threaten us with
suspension for breaking your noble stan
dard." I remembered his quote in The Daily
last year about how he considered it im
proper to drop the charges against us be
cause it would not be right to "give stu
dents preferential treatment." Last year I
dismissed his statement with a quip about
how relieved I was that Stanford was a
democratic institution. This year, I realized
what he meant. He meant that next time
we protested against Stanford's invest
ments in apartheid in a way which dis
obeyed the administration's authority, we
were to be treated as common criminals
and used as examples.
As I waited in an office to be booked, a
black student, Robby Perkins, was dragged
on the floor, his hands pressed behind his
arched back. Oddly enough, his position
suddenly reminded me of an Egyptian
hieroglyphic that I had once seen in a
museum — it portrayed an enslaved pris
oner of war under the feet of his opponent.
Robby let out a sharp scream as two Stan
ford cops twisted his arm to lift him up. I
stood up and shouted, "I know you're all
paid to practice legalized violence, but why
do you have to h irt him?" One cop with a
thick moustache, Sgt. Nick Bruno, ex
plained, "I'm not hurting him, he's hurting
me." Cam Baker, who was sitting next to
me shot back, "Oh yeah, then why don't I
hear you screaming in pain?"
The next student to be brought in was
sobbing uncontrollably while a cop applied
pressure on his wrist. "Just remember that
millions of South Africans have gone
through this," I said to him. "You are doing
it for them." He nodded his head, still
crying.

Marvin Moore, Stanford's only black
police captain, said, "Look, he's refusing to
cooperate. We're only doing our job." My
numb feeling returned as I asked him with a
weak smile, "Isn't that exactly what the
Nazis said? Isn't that what the Jewish
Kapos who collaborated with the Nazis
said? I wonder if the blacks who collaborate
with the white South Africans also say
that." Moore didn't reply. He didn't look me
in the eye.
Meanwhile another cop was telling Peter
Heslin in a very calm, soothing voice,
"Look, if you don't walk on your own we'll
have to carry you. You might fall on your
head. You're only hurting yourself. It's your
choice, either you hurt yourself or you
don't," reasoned the Stanford cop.
Again, I felt numb. I continued to feel this
way until we arrived at the police station.
Cam and I, two of the students who had not
been dragged into the police car, had to
wait inside the car for about 30 minutes. At
that time, I didn't know the reason for this
was because Robby had been dragged out
of the police van by his neck. I also did not
know that he had been taken into solitary
confinement, stripped and beaten in the
face. When we went inside the police sta
tion, all I saw were a few cops with their
sick grins talking about the "stupid Stanford
student that doesn't want to learn."
I began to fight the feeling of absurdity by
laughing. Cam and I began to crack jokes
about our criminality. I also burst out laugh
ing when I remembered that I had listed
Donald Kennedy as a contact person in case
of death or emergency. I wondered if he
would personally come pick us up or if he
would send an underling if the cops decided
one of us hadn't learned our lesson well
enough.
At that point the sergeant shouted at us,
"The game is over clowns! Do you under
stand me?" I remained silent. "Answer me

with a 'yes sir,' clowns. Do you under
stand?" he shouted. I looked at him straight
in the eyes almost as if he didn't exist. He
shouted his command various times, but
when I would not answer him, he came
around the counter and poked his pen in my
chest. He made a signal to the Stanford
sheriff who began squeezing Cam up
against the wall with his body weight. Then
the cop who was going to drive us to the
main San Jose prison came into the room
saying, "Are these the apartheid
protesters? Shit. Fucking smart-ass kids.
Because of you I ain't with my lady tonight.
Assholes!"
After the sergeant grabbed my arm and
shouted his command again, I asked him,
"Why do you feel you have to humiliate us?"
For a moment I had the illusion that he
heard my question. When he shouted his
command once more, I realized that if I
didn't answer 'yes sir,' he would probably
drag me into solitary confinement.
Yet I was not in prison to be a martyr. I
was not there to take punishment for my
cause as Kennedy had so presumptuously
recommended we do last year. Why should
I be treated like a criminal? Only in a white
supremist society are you treated like a
criminal for protesting apartheid. I don't
think we should have been treated like
criminals in Nicaragua for protesting apart
heid. Why should I be punished when it is
those in the power structure that are
guilty? If anyone should take punishment
for their cause it should be the people who
care more about profits than about the
welfare of other human beings.
I decided I could answer "I understand,"
and still retain my integrity. A feeling of
nausea overwhelmed me. I understood only
too well that South Africa was not so far
away.
