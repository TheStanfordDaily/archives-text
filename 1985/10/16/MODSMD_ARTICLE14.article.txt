# What Good Will Protesting Do?

### 
You wouldn't know it by the weather, but
spring is back, in one way at least: The South
African divestment issue has started up again.
After the busy first days of settling into my new
room and getting my phone hooked up, the
marches and the rallies began again. Dedicated

students emphatically urged me to come to
demonstrations against apartheid. Like a lot of
people, though, I declined to join when the mo
ment of decision came.
How one stands on the apartheid issue is a dif
ficult thing to decide. Virtually everyone is ap
palled by the system of institutionalized racism
in South Africa, but just what can we do about it?
Better yet, is it our responsibility to do anything
about it? Well, the second question is easy. The
United States has a long history of involving it
self in the internal politics of other countries.
With our belief in our cultural superiority, we feel
that it is our duty to guide misguided nations
onto the path of moral virtue. South Africa has
obviously been on the wrong path since the es
tablishment of apartheid, so it's up to us and the
free world to set them straight.
But just what is it about South Africa that
draws so much American public indignation? The
Soviet Union enslaves entire populations

through its totalitarian government and that gov
ernment's proxies. Thousands have died in
Uganda in years of tribal and civil war. Mul
titudes die in Ethiopia each day while the Marxist
government spends nearly half its budget on the
military. In Iran, men and women are sent to the
gallows for even slight violations of the Islamic
laws. Who cries in protest for these people?
For their race, South African blacks have one
of the highest standards of living in Africa. What
is it about their lack of political freedom that at
tracts more attention and engenders more stu
dent rallies than the dying in Uganda or Afghani
stan? In South Africa, the blacks fight for political
equality. In other African nations, people fight
for mere survival. It seems that seeing this
country of blatant racism and political repression
strikes a deep chord in all of us.

For their race, South
African blacks have one of
the highest standards of
living in Africa.

Only 20 years ago, American blacks fought
against racism in our own country. Seeing white
policemen beating black youths in a country
where racism is embedded in the way of life
compels one to action. People die every day in
military regimes or in the starving fields of Ethi
opia, yet we have learned to accept these daily
deaths. We have become desensitized. The prin
ciple of political freedom for the oppressed

blacks of South Africa is another matter. The
issue there is a matter of principle â€” a bat
tleground for idealists the world over.
The link the University has with corporations
that do business in South Africa focuses our
wrath. What can we do to stop the Soviet repres
sion in Poland? or the slaughter in Iran? We can
try to get the Board of Trustees to sell the Uni
versity's stock in companies that work in South
Africa. Allegedly, this will spark international in
dignation against the Botha government, which
will then be forced to institute substantial
reforms of apartheid. Yet there is no way we can
be sure divestment will do anything at all.
We have so much anger and indignation, but so
little real power. Our idealistic minds revel in our
anger and the feeling we get when we think
we've done something that conforms with our
lofty ideals. But who do we really care about
when we protest for divestment? Is it some self
less wish for self-fulfillment through idealistic
protest, or do we really want to get apartheid
eradicated? If the latter is the case, we must ask
ourselves: Why South Africa and why divestment?
Ask yourself about the peoples of Uganda, Af
ghanistan and Iran and about the thousands of
people held in political prisons in other brutal
regimes. Why not protest for them? The reason
is simple. Death we have compassion for, but ra
cial repression sparks outrage. This matter of
principle drives us to action. As a dormmate of
mine told me, "We like to have something we can
fight against."
