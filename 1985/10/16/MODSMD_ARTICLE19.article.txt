## 1-Calorie Bandits Take Your Money 
### RACHEL JOHNSON 
The good old days of only having
to pay 55 cents at the soda machine
are gone.
They weren't even that good.
Remember having to waste the two
quarters that you'd been saving for
the wash? And if that wasn't enough
of an affront to common sense, you
also had to beg, borrow or steal a
stupid nickel from your roommate.
So the first time you prepare to
take out your aggressions by
punching the buttons of the local
soda machine this year, again
lamenting the loss of your quarters,
but excited because you've found a
nickel, don't say we didn't warn
you.
The price of a soda has been
raised to 60 cents.
According to Roy Mann, mainte
nance supervisor for Canteen Cor
poration, the nationwide canned
beverage distributor which pro
vides the soda machines for Stan
ford, the price change was due to
an "increase in wholesale canned
beverage prices."
Canteen's cost for buying the
beverages from Coke and Pepsi
went up during the year, and they
had to compensate for that change.
Each time the wholesale price
goes up by, let's say, two cents,
Canteen must raise its prices by a
nickel, because the soda machine
won't take pennies.
Generally, the corporation tries
to hold off on any price increase un
til the wholesale price is close, or is
expected to come close, to the
price with the added nickel.
Canteen has a contract price
review near the end of each year to

figure the percentage increase they
expect in the wholesale price.
Stanford's contract review is
scheduled for late November. At
that time, Canteen will estimate the
wholesale price increase on the
canned beverages, and they will
also review their own labor costs.
On July 1, Canteen employees
get wage raises, and this must be

figured in during the contract price
review.
Of course, if you still think that
"Coke is it" or that "Pepsi is the
choice of a new generation," you'll
probably keep trudging to the
campus soda machines.
No doubt it will still be annoying
to drop all those useful quarters
down the hatch, but the worst part
will be trying to hunt down two
nickels instead of one.
Just maybe, if you're really lucky,
you'll find a whole dime.
