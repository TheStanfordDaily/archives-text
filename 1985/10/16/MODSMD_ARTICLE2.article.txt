# 1982 Strike Recalled
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
With yesterday's affirmative
strike vote by United Stanford
Workers, a repeat performance
of the 1982 strike seems possi
ble.
More than 300 United Stan
ford Workers marched on the
University President's Office
Friday afternoon, Sept. 10,
1982, after 700 attended a pre

strike meeting.
Shouting "strike, strike,
strike," the workers were met
outside the office by Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington
and other police officials. Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
did not appear. The marchers
then moved nearby to Building
170, chanting "strike, strike,
strike" outside the office of Pris
cilla Wheeler, the University's
chief negotiator.
Such was the course of events that began
the 30-day 1982 USW strike in which about
850 of the University's technical, service
and maintenance employees walked off
their jobs.
USW demanded an increase in wages,
improvements in benefits, an end to non
union temporary laborers and a reduction of
interaction between union and non-union
workers on research activities.
Vandalism, arrests and picket lines
colored the entire strike period, while both
Kennedy and Michael Baratz, then
executive secretary of USW, charged the
other with unfair labor practices.
In the middle was the Stanford student,
trying to ease back into the rigors of aca
demic life or, if he was a member of the
Class of '86, trying to survive in new sur
roundings.
Overall, students voiced differing
opinions on the extent to which the strike
affected them. When students first arrived
on campus they were satisfied with food
service but a little disappointed with the
condition of the rooms.
"Some of the rooms in Stern are really
dirty, dusty and gross," said then-RA
Debbie Pagangis. "We had problems with
broken fixtures and things, and we can't get
anything repaired," she said at the time.
Most of the students did not, at first,
know enough about the issues of the strike
to form any opinion on it, but many were
upset about its timing.
"The thing that makes me mad is that the
union struck just as the freshmen were
about to arrive," said then-freshman Laura
Keller. "We had so much new to deal with,
having this added to it just made everything
that much harder for us," Keller said
recently.
"Maybe I'm wrong, but a 9.5 percent in
crease doesn't sound bad to me," Pagangis

said. "It appears that [the union] is using
the students to put pressure on the Univer
sity, and I don't like that. The students are
the ones who are suffering, and we have
nothing to do with it," she said.
In retrospect, fifth-year senior Kerry
Smith described the strike as "chaotic."
"There were picket lines all over the
place, and we had to ride our bikes through
them," Smith said. The striking workers
"would yell things at you about the Univer
sity."
Alondra RA Mike Hawley, a freshman in
Paloma during the strike, said: "It was a
pain for everyone concerned."
The freshmen apparently were not made
aware of the reasons for the strike. "We
really didn't know the full extent of what
was happening," Hawley said.
Hawley said he did not believe that it
ruined the freshman experience. "In a way,
it might have brought us together a bit
more."
The dorms are educating the freshmen
this year with guest lecturers from both
sides, according to Hawley.
Both Hawley and Smith said that student
sentiment seemed to fall behind the
workers. The administration did not give a
favorable impression to the students, Smith
said.
"Yet, it was hard because it incon
venienced student life," she added.
The strike nearly shut down dormitory
food service, halted construction projects,
slowed deliveries and put Stanford police on
12-hour shifts. As students tried to move
into residences, a skeletal crew at Opera
tions and Maintenance was responding to
emergency repair or health calls only.
However, all 29 independent Row houses
opened on schedule, although a bit dirty.
Providing food for students was probably
the most difficult challenge faced by admi
nistrators. All students who participated in
University Food Service received weekly
cash refunds. Wilbur and Flo Mo operated
four serving lines, run by exempt workers
and student hashers, where students were
able to buy breakfast and lunch.

Such was the course of events that began
the 30-day 1982 USW strike in which about
850 of the University's technical, service
and maintenance employees walked off
their jobs.
USW demanded an increase in wages,
improvements in benefits, an end to non
union temporary laborers and a reduction of
interaction between union and non-union
workers on research activities.
Vandalism, arrests and picket lines
colored the entire strike period, while both
Kennedy and Michael Baratz, then
executive secretary of USW, charged the
other with unfair labor practices.
In the middle was the Stanford student,
trying to ease back into the rigors of aca
demic life or, if he was a member of the
Class of '86, trying to survive in new sur
roundings.
Overall, students voiced differing
opinions on the extent to which the strike
affected them. When students first arrived
on campus they were satisfied with food
service but a little disappointed with the
condition of the rooms.
"Some of the rooms in Stern are really
dirty, dusty and gross," said then-RA
Debbie Pagangis. "We had problems with
broken fixtures and things, and we can't get
anything repaired," she said at the time.
Most of the students did not, at first,
know enough about the issues of the strike
to form any opinion on it, but many were
upset about its timing.
"The thing that makes me mad is that the
union struck just as the freshmen were
about to arrive," said then-freshman Laura
Keller. "We had so much new to deal with,
having this added to it just made everything
that much harder for us," Keller said
recently.
"Maybe I'm wrong, but a 9.5 percent in
crease doesn't sound bad to me," Pagangis

said. "It appears that [the union] is using
the students to put pressure on the Univer
sity, and I don't like that. The students are
the ones who are suffering, and we have
nothing to do with it," she said.
In retrospect, fifth-year senior Kerry
Smith described the strike as "chaotic."
"There were picket lines all over the
place, and we had to ride our bikes through
them," Smith said. The striking workers
"would yell things at you about the Univer
sity."
Alondra RA Mike Hawley, a freshman in
Paloma during the strike, said: "It was a
pain for everyone concerned."
The freshmen apparently were not made
aware of the reasons for the strike. "We
really didn't know the full extent of what
was happening," Hawley said.
Hawley said he did not believe that it
ruined the freshman experience. "In a way,
it might have brought us together a bit
more."
The dorms are educating the freshmen
this year with guest lecturers from both
sides, according to Hawley.
Both Hawley and Smith said that student
sentiment seemed to fall behind the
workers. The administration did not give a
favorable impression to the students, Smith
said.
"Yet, it was hard because it incon
venienced student life," she added.
The strike nearly shut down dormitory
food service, halted construction projects,
slowed deliveries and put Stanford police on
12-hour shifts. As students tried to move
into residences, a skeletal crew at Opera
tions and Maintenance was responding to
emergency repair or health calls only.
However, all 29 independent Row houses
opened on schedule, although a bit dirty.
Providing food for students was probably
the most difficult challenge faced by admi
nistrators. All students who participated in
University Food Service received weekly
cash refunds. Wilbur and Flo Mo operated
four serving lines, run by exempt workers
and student hashers, where students were
able to buy breakfast and lunch.
