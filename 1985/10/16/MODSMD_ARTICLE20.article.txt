## Blume Center Learns From a Quake 
### ANTOINETTE REED 
The Mexico City earthquake
need not be only a grim reminder of
the danger we face in our own
earthquake zone. For Stanford
earthquake researchers, it will be a
valuable learning tool as well.
Almost as soon as the Mexico
City buildings had stopped shaking
on Sept. 19, civil engineering
graduate student Shigeru Suzuki
was on his way there. Three weeks
and 100 pictures later, he has
returned, having compiled an ex
haustive photographic and statisti
cal record of the earthquake and the
havoc it wreaked.
Suzuki's return caused much
excitement among members of the
Civil Engineering Department, who
crowded into Prof. Anne Kiremid
jian's office last Friday to pore over
Suzuki's pictures. "The Mexico
City earthquake," said Helmut
Krawinkler, professor in the de
partment, "is like a great natural
experiment which allows us to see
the effects of this particular
earthquake on many different types
of building."
He noted that the seismographic
records brought back by Suzuki
provide a thorough description of
the earthquake's force and dura
tion, while the pictures document
the direct results of this force.
As an example of what sorts of
things may be learned from the
photographs, Krawinkler pointed
out a series of four identical steel
buildings that Suzuki had focused
on, only one of which collapsed in
the earthquake. "So even if we
can't find the original plans or
designs for these buildings,'" he
said, "we can analyze the structure
of the buildings still standing to bet
ter understand why the one building
fell down.
"With a magnifying glass and an
hour to spend on each picture," said

Krawinkler, "a great deal can be
learned. But even more can be
learned from an on-site inspection."
According to Krawinkler, either he
or Kiremidjian will probably be
traveling down to Mexico City
sometime in the next few weeks.
There is a lot of precedent for
learning from one natural disaster in
the hopes of minimizing the impact
of the next one, Kiremidjian said.
After every major earthquake in
this area, she said, members of the

John Blume Earthquake Research
Institute — a Stanford organization
co-directed by Krawinkler and Civil
Engineering Prof. Haresh Shah —
travel to the site, usually in con
junction with members of the
worldwide Earthquake Engineering
Research Institute.
Ever since the 1971 San Fer
nando earthquake, said Kiremid
jian, members of the Blume In
stitute have conducted many sur
veys of earthquake sites in Califor
nia and in Latin American and have

done post-earthquake seismic haz
ard evaluations in Guatemala,
Nicaragua and Costa Rica.
The on-site examinations can be
an invaluable learning experience
for students as well as staff, accord
ing to Kiremidjian. "After the Mor
gan Hill earthquake last year," she
said, "an entire earthquake engi
neering class visited the site, wrote
a collaborative report and thus
learned a lot about how buildings
behave in an earthquake."
Members of the Blume Institute

do not just sit around waiting for the
next earthquake to happen, ex
plained Krawinkler, but in fact can
use an experimental approach to
study the effects of dynamic forces
on static structures.
"You may well ask how it is pos
sible to experiment," said
Krawinkler. "Obviously, we cannot
destroy whole buildings just to see
how they behave when destroyed.
Instead, we build small versions of
multi-story buildings of concrete,
brick or adobe. Using these

models, we can test their resis
tance to different forces."
In the closest simulation of an ac
tual earthquake, he explained, the
small models are placed on a "shake
table" and subjected to scaled-down,
earthquake-type movements.
Then in separate "quasi-static"
experiments, the total movement is
broken down into its individual com
ponents. These latter experiments,
said Krawinkler, are "less like the
real thing, but are easier to ob
serve."
A final domain of work done in
the Blume Institute includes sur
veys of regional seismic risks.
Krawinkler said that students have
surveyed the buildings in Palo Alto,
for example, and determined the
relative probabilities of their falling
over in an earthquake, based on the
date of their construction and the
materials and designs used to build
them.
Such studies of the Stanford
campus, said Krawinkler, have
shown most of the buildings to be of
only moderate safety. "But Stan
ford has done more than any other
community to make its buildings
safe," he added, noting that every
year money is included in the Uni
versity budget to upgrade campus
buildings.
"It is ironic, though," Krawinkler
said, referring to the group of brick
buildings between the Quad and
Old Union, "that the only really
unsafe buildings left on campus in
clude the one in which the Blume
Institute is housed."
While cautioning that it would
represent a formidable task,
Krawinkler suggested that the
upgrading of buildings should be on
every earthquake-prone city's
agenda. "Although there are many
ways of preparing for an
earthquake," he said, "the only real
way to minimize immediate life loss
from an earthquake is to upgrade
our buildings."


The timing of the Sept. 19 Mexico City earthquake — it struck at
7 a.m. — prevented children and teachers from being trapped in
this razed elementary school. Photographs such as this are

very valuable to scientists at the John Blume Earthquake In
stitute who are studying the ability of certain structures to
withstand temblors.
