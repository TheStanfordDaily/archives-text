# One Medical Student's Shaky Break
## 
### ANTOINETTE REED 
"I only realized that something
had happened when I emerged from
the subway: There were buildings
in ruins, buildings on fire, soldiers,
ambulances and thousands of
people — I thought there'd been a
war!"
Thus, on Sept. 19, second-year
Stanford medical student David
Mills made it all the way from
Cozumel on the Yucatan peninsula
(where he had been on vacation for
two weeks), to the La Alameda
Park subway station in downtown
Mexico City, before he even knew
there had been an earthquake.
"They never told us anything on
the plane," he said, in an interview
at the medical school last week.
"As we were landing," he added,
"the pilot said only 'The weather's
clear, and it's 72 degrees in Mexico
City' — not a word about the
earthquake."
But even once he arrived near La
Alameda — one of the areas hard
est hit by the earthquake that
morning — Mills did not realize at
first what had happened. "I didn't
know enough Spanish to figure it
out right away," he said, "but I
bought a newspaper and managed
to pick out words like 'la temblor,'

and 'mil muertos,' so then I knew
there had been an earthquake."
Mills said he had only planned the
Mexico City stop-over as a
sightseeing bonus on his way back
to California, but even confronted
with the damage and chaos, he
remained there for two days to ob
serve.
One of the things he said he ob
served was that many modern build
ings had collapsed, while many
16th-century constructions
remained unscathed. The hotel in
which he chose to spend the night
was an undamaged building,. "of the
most modern construction I could
find," he said.
The next morning, Mills said he
was amazed to find that, in the mar
ketplace across from his hotel, life
seemed pretty much normal. "It
was like that all over the city," he
added. "There were whole blocks
where life seemed untouched, and
other blocks where all the buildings
had fallen into the street."
By the end of Friday, Mills said
he was exhausted. "All the dust, all
the noise, all the destruction —
after that much sensory overload,
all I could do was go back to my
hotel and sleep."
Luckily for him, he was
awakened again at 7 p.m., when the
aftershock hit (measured later at

7.5 on the Richter Scale, according
to the United States Geological
Survey).
"The bed started to roll," des
cribed Mills, "and I went straight
for the doorway. Over the next
minute-and-a-half, the movement
intensified until I had to hold on to
the doorjamb, just to keep from fall
ing over. The idea crossed my mind
that maybe this was it. .

'The bed started to
roll. . . . The idea
crossed my mind
that maybe this
was .it.'

But once the aftershock had
passed, Mills said he succeeded in
getting out of the hotel and spent
the night in a nearby vacant lot,
with thousands of other people who
had also been forced from their
residences. Among these
thousands, Mills said he met up
with a Mexican family whose
children spoke enough English for
them to be able to communicate
with him. "There wasn't much to do

besides talk," he said, "so we were
pretty good friends by Saturday
morning."
When he finally left Mexico City
on Sunday morning, Mills said he
took with him several names and
addresses of relatives of this family
with whom he spent that long, cold
night on not-so-solid ground. "As
soon as I got back home to San
Diego," he said, "I called up all their
relatives. It was a real joy to give
them the good news, that their fam
ily was OK."
Mills brought back with him at
least one very concrete result of
that experience: a strong motiva
tion to learn Spanish. "I know I felt
most helpless, not as a frustrated
medical student," said Mills, who is
now enrolled in a Spanish class for
medical students, "but because I
couldn't even offer my services, not
knowing enough of the language to
do so."
"All in all," said Mills, "although it
was a painful experience, seeing
the collapsed buildings and knowing
that the people inside couldn't get
out, and seeing the thousands of
homeless people in the street and
knowing that, though I was in the
streets too, I could get on a plane
and be home in 24 hours — still, I'm
glad I was there because it was a
valuable experience."
