### ERIK STEN Staff Writer 
Nothing's more disheartening
than outplaying a team and losing in
the end.
"It's just disappointing,"
women's soccer Coach Helen
Keohane said after watching her
team fall 2-1 to the Chico State
Wildcats yesterday.
It was one of the Stanford
squad's best efforts of the year.
Sadly, it was wasted because goals
are the bottom line in soccer.
"It was probably the best soccer
we've played all year," Keohane
said. "It's very disappointing to play
that well and lose."
As soon as the contest started,
the Cardinal came on strong. The
ball was almost exclusively on
Chico's side of the field.
"People were finding each other.
We were taking shots on goal,
keeping them off balance,"
Keohane said.
By the end of the first half, Stan
ford had tallied 14 shots on goal,
five of them coming from freshman
midfielder Stacey Keare, who
seemed to be all over Chico's side
of the field.
"We dominated. We were taking
it to them," Keohane said.
Twenty-one minutes into the
first half, the Cardinal pressure
earned the team a goal. With the
ball perilously close to the Chico

goal, a Wildcat slipped and commit
ted a foul.
The referee awarded the Card
inal a penalty kick. And senior
defender Carol Berryman was
given the honor. She lined up her
sights and sent a picture-perfect
shot into the upper left hand corner
of the Wildcat net.
Berryman's blast was so well
placed that the Chico goalie didn't
have a chance. The shot brought
resounding cheers from the crowd
and moved the score to 1-0.
But Chico didn't fold. Ten
minutes later the Wildcats moved
the ball to the front of the Stanford
net.
Chico's first close shot on goal
required a referee's decision. A
Wildcat lofted the ball straight at the
Cardinal net. Norton caught it and
knocked it away, but it looked like
she may have been inside of the
goal.
Chico called for a goal, but after a
conference with the linesman, the
referee decided that no goal would
be awarded.
Still, the ball stayed in Cardinal
territory. The Wildcats weren't
done yet.
A minute later, the ball went out
of bounds, and Chico was given a
corner kick. A Wildcat midfielder
sent the ball into a crowd in front of
the goal, and from somewhere in
the pack the ball ricocheted toward
the Cardinal net.
Norton dove and got a piece of

the ball, but only enough to send it
rolling weakly back into the throng.
A score was there for the taking,
and Chico did just that.
With the Stanford defense out of
position, a Wildcat forward had no
problem getting a shot. Norton
never had a chance to recover from
her diving effort, and the game was
all tied up.
The score remained 1-1 until the
intermission.
Throughout the second half, the
Cardinal continued to outplay the
Wildcats, but the difference wasn't
quite so clear.
"It was pretty back and forth,"
Keohane said.
Both teams fought hard, and each
had a number of scoring opportuni
ties. But neither team could cash in
until 25 minutes into the second
half.
A Wildcat midfielder received the
ball in open territory and began a
race down the field. She managed
to slip by her mark and that left just
Berry man and Norton between her
and a possible game-winning goal.
"Carol was forced to commit and
there was no support," Keohane
said. With only one defender be
tween her and the goal, the Wildcat
was able to get off a good shot.
Norton reached out and put a
hand on the ball, but it wasn't
enough. The score moved to 2-1
where it would stay.

Chico's first close shot on goal
required a referee's decision. A
Wildcat lofted the ball straight at the
Cardinal net. Norton caught it and
knocked it away, but it looked like
she may have been inside of the
goal.
Chico called for a goal, but after a
conference with the linesman, the
referee decided that no goal would
be awarded.
Still, the ball stayed in Cardinal
territory. The Wildcats weren't
done yet.
A minute later, the ball went out
of bounds, and Chico was given a
corner kick. A Wildcat midfielder
sent the ball into a crowd in front of
the goal, and from somewhere in
the pack the ball ricocheted toward
the Cardinal net.
Norton dove and got a piece of

the ball, but only enough to send it
rolling weakly back into the throng.
A score was there for the taking,
and Chico did just that.
With the Stanford defense out of
position, a Wildcat forward had no
problem getting a shot. Norton
never had a chance to recover from
her diving effort, and the game was
all tied up.
The score remained 1-1 until the
intermission.
Throughout the second half, the
Cardinal continued to outplay the
Wildcats, but the difference wasn't
quite so clear.
"It was pretty back and forth,"
Keohane said.
Both teams fought hard, and each
had a number of scoring opportuni
ties. But neither team could cash in
until 25 minutes into the second
half.
A Wildcat midfielder received the
ball in open territory and began a
race down the field. She managed
to slip by her mark and that left just
Berry man and Norton between her
and a possible game-winning goal.
"Carol was forced to commit and
there was no support," Keohane
said. With only one defender be
tween her and the goal, the Wildcat
was able to get off a good shot.
Norton reached out and put a
hand on the ball, but it wasn't
enough. The score moved to 2-1
where it would stay.

Even though Cardinal players beat their Wildcat opponents to the ball for much of the afternoon,
Chico State emerged from yesterday's game with a 2-1 triumph.
