# K.C. Sends Series To Seventh Game
## 
### 
TORONTO (AP) — George Brett's record ninth
playoff home run broke a fifth-inning tie last night,
triggering the Kansas City Royals to a 5-3 triumph
over the Toronto Blue Jays and forcing the Ameri
can League playoffs to a decisive seventh game.
The Royals, who trailed the series 3-1 at one
point, will start 20-game winner Bret Saberhagen in
tonight's seventh game. Toronto will answer with
its own ace, right-hander Dave Stieb, who won the
opener.
Brett again gave Kansas City the spark it needed,
and once again his victim was Blue Jays starter
Doyle Alexander. In Game 3, Brett homered twice
and doubled off Alexander during a 4-for-4 night that
enabled the Royals to win their first game of this se
ries and end a 10-game postseason losing streak.
This time, Brett homered far over the right
center field fence with one out in the fifth to break a
2-2 tie. The homer, which moved him past Steve
Garvey for the most home runs in major league
playoff history, came one pitch after he swung and
awkwardly missed a 2-1 delivery from Alexander.

Unlike his one-man performance in Game 3, Brett
had plenty of help from his teammates on the clear,
54-degree night as Kansas City again frustrated
Toronto's attempt to bring Canada its first World
Series.
Dan Quisenberry, who gave up two game
winning hits earlier in the series, came on with two
outs and two on in the ninth. Once again facing the
winning run, Quisenberry struck out Garth lorg to
end the game. lorg threw his bat toward the back
stop in disgust as he walked away from the plate.
Veteran Hal Mcßae, playing in his 44th
postseason game, singled home Kansas City's first
run in the first inning and doubled home the second
run in the third. Mcßae followed Brett's homer with
a single for his third hit of the game, but was left
stranded.
Buddy Biancalana and Lonnie Smith delivered
RBI doubles in the sixth that increased the lead to 5-
2.
Mark Gubicza, forced into a
starting role for the Royals, kept
Kansas City on even terms through
five innings, getting the victory
with help from Bud Black, who
pitched three-and-one-third innings
before giving way to Quisenberry.
Quisenberry got the final out in
all 14 of Gubicza's regular-season
victories, getting saves in 11 of
those games.
Trailing 5-2, the Blue Jays tried
to rally against Gubicza in the sixth.
Lloyd Moseby led off with a single
and Willie Upshaw drew a one-out
walk, which prompted many fans
among the crowd of 37,557 to wave
large Canadian flags.
Howser then brought in Black,
who yielded a run-scoring single to
pinch-hitter Cliff Johnson that made

it 5-3.
In the seventh, Brett made an
error on Jesse Barfield's leadoff
grounder, but Fernandez hit into a
double play. Black then walked
Damaso Garcia and Moseby, but
pinch-hitter lorg hit a hard come
backer to the mound that Black
fielded and threw to first.
This series has been dogged by
controversial calls, and another
arose in the top of the fourth.
This time, a close play at first
which involved an umpire's reversal
irked the Blue Jay dugout.
Toronto Manager Bobby Cox,
whose team has suffered through a
few controversial rulings —
prompting left fielder George Bell to
suggest there was an umpires' con
spiracy against the Canadian team
— sprung from the dugout to argue
the ruling. Replays indicated that
the umpires had made the correct
call.
