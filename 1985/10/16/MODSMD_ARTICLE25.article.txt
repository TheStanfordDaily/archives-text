# Men End 4th in Tourney
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
After playing better than it had all season, the Stan
ford men's golf team finished fourth in a tough 18-team
field in the Southwestern Intercollegiate at North
Ranch Country Club in Thousand Oaks.
Oklahoma State breezed to the team title, posting a
three-day total of 898. Houston, with 910 strokes,
edged USC by two strokes to take second place.
Stanford led the tournament after the first round
with an impressive score of 301 and continued to play
solidly throughout the rest of the tournament. The
squad finished with a total of 918. This consistency was
the difference between the Southwestern and the pre
vious events the team has played in.
"I thought we played steadily the entire tourna
ment," Cardinal Coach Tim Schaaf said. "That was the
key — to be consistent throughout."
Carl Wagner, a senior from Napa, shot a first-round
73, leading the Cardinal's first-round surge to the top of
the team-leader board. The round placed him first
among individual players. Wagner ended up ninth with a
three-day score of 227.
"Wagner had a very fine tournament," Schaaf said.
"Everyone on the team contributed a lot. (Don)
Walsworth, (Rich) Marik and (Phil) Rowley, who shot a
76 today, also did a fine job."

Schaaf also commended the play of Brad Greer, a
freshman playing in his first tournament for Stanford.
Greer posted two rounds of 76 en route to a 240.
Brian Watts of Oklahoma State captured the individ
ual title when he emerged the victor from a three-way,
sudden-death playoff. Watts bested teammate Kevin
Wipple and USC's Sam Randolph in the first extra hole.
Stanford's fourth-place finish was the school's high
est ever in the Southwestern, bettering last year's
fifth-place finish. That team went on to qualify for the
NCAA tournament.
The result is all the more impressive considering the
competition on hand.
"Oklahoma State is currently ranked No. 1 and Hous
ton is the defending NCAA champ," Schaaf said. "The
competition was excellent, needless to say. The main
thing was that we remained steady throughout the
tournament against some of the best teams in the
country. Things are beginning to fall into place.
"I was impressed with the poise of the team," he
said. "No one ever lost it — and there was certainly
occasion to with the bad weather conditions here."
Heavy winds prevailed throughout the event.
"I was very proud of them."
The Stanford women's golf team was on its way to
Tulsa to begin play in the three-day Nancy Lopez Invita
tional. The tournament will be held on the par-71,
6,038-yard course at the Cedar Ridge Country Club.
