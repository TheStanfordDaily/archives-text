# Sutherland Goes Home to USC
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
Stanford freshman defensive
back Sam Sutherland doesn't
hesitate when asked what his goals
are for this season.
"I can't set any personal goals,
really," he says, resting on one
knee next to the practice field, his
white uniform heavily grass
stained. "I just want to win. I come
from a winning school, and this
losing is kind of new to me."
For a while, it didn't seem that
Sutherland would have a chance to
affect the Cardinal won-lost record
this year. But after the defense
gave up an average of more than 41
points in three consecutive losses,
the coaching staff decided to take a
second look at their prize recruit
from Banning High.
And Sutherland made an impres
sion. Enough of an impression for
defensive coordinator Dick Mannini
to start him in place of safety Mark
Hashimoto against UCLA last
week, ending what was slated to be
Sutherland's redshirt freshman
year. Sutherland recorded six
tackles, and he will be in the start
ing lineup again this weekend
against USC.
"I definitely didn't come in think
ing I was going to redshirt," Sut
herland says."And I never gave up
when they weren't playing me. You
never know when someone might
get hurt or something."
At the beginning of fall practices,
it looked like Sutherland was
pegged for the first string. But after
practicing with the starting defen
sive backs for a while, he was
demoted to the scout team, the

squad that the Stanford offense
practices against.
"I don't know what the situation
was," Sutherland says. "They just
didn't call me over there any
more."
But after opening some eyes in
practices, Sutherland was put on
the traveling squad for the San
Diego State game. And after the
defense was mauled in that contest,
Sutherland got the call for UCLA.
Now, he is preparing to play
against the school whose shadow
he grew up in — USC is just 15
minutes away from Sutherland's
home in Carson, and he frequently
went there to work out. The
Trojans recruited Sutherland heav
ily, and "eight or nine" teammates
from Banning High will be suiting up
for USC Saturday.
But that doesn't mean Sutherland
has any mixed emotions about the
game.
"USC is not as tough as it used to
be," Sutherland says. "They're a
one-dlmensional team. We can get
up there and push with them, and
we can beat them.
"They've got athletes, but we've
got athletes too. If we play to the
best of our ability, we could
surprise them."
Card notes
Stanford safety Brad
Humphreys, who left the UCLA
game in the fourth quarter with a
pinched nerve in his neck, watched
yesterday's practice from the
sidelines. He is currently listed as
probable for USC.
The father and uncle of reserve
Cardinal linebacker Barry
McKeever were All-America se
lections for the Trojans in 1959 and
1960. Not surprisingly, Stanford's

McKeever says he "did have some
pressure from my family to go to
USC.
"I remember when I told my
mom that I decided to go to Stan
ford, she leaned over, hit me and

called me a jerk. But she knew it
was best for me. ... It was very
emotional for me to break away
from something that was a part of
my life for so long. You just don't
lose that."
