# Stanford Hoops Opens Practice
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
In parts of the country where
college basketball attendance on
Saturday is exceeded only by
church attendance on Sunday,
Oct. 15 is a revered day. Teams
wait in gyms late on the 14th, lis
ten for the clock tower to ring 12
times and commence prepara
tion for the upcoming season.
Stanford Coach Tom Davis,
taking a more rational approach,
let his players finish their prob
lem sets Monday night. They
showed up at Maples Pavilion
yesterday afternoon to practice
for the first time since a 67-47
loss to Washington last March
left them with an 11-17 record
and all alone in the basement of
the Pacific 10 Conference.
Last year's team was young,
with only senior Kent Seymour
parting after the season. This
year's is also young, with five
freshmen and three sophomores
slated to see varsity action, but
six seniors should provide a
steadying influence that many
hope will help the Cardinal put
last season's 3-15 conference
record behind it.
"They're going to motivate
themselves, they're going to
motivate the freshmen, they'll
maybe even motivate the
coaches," Davis said of a class
that welcomes back guard Steve

Brown, who redshirted last
season with a stress fracture in
his right leg.
Brown averaged 10.9 points in
1983-84 for the Cardinal, trailing
only John Revelli and Keith
Jones, Stanford's all-time leading
scorer.
Returning for their third
seasons in the Stanford starting
lineup are forward Earl Kober
lein, last year's top scorer with a
10.3 ppg scoring average; guard
Keith Ramee, the all-time Stan
ford assist leader with 335; and
forward Andy Fischer, who
walked on his freshman year into
a key role with the Cardinal.
They will have little time to
ease into things once the games
begin. Gone from the non
conference schedule are mis
matches with Missouri-St. Louis
and Bemidji State. In their place
are NCAA Tournament
qualifiers North Carolina,
Nevada-Las Vegas and Maryland
and a paucity of the Division II
and 111 and NAIA schools that
dominated last December's
slate.
"There's no question it's the
toughest schedule we've had,"
Davis said. "It's also an attrac
tive schedule from the players'
standpcint. It's exciting for them
to find out how good they are."
A couple of freshmen look to
have a shot at contributing right
away. Howard Wright, recruited as
a 6-foot-8 power forward, may get
a chance to fill Seymour's spot at
center, where only sophomore Eric
Reveno returns. "I think Howard
Wright has to get a real chance be
cause we need a center," Davis
said.
Guard Todd Lichti spent his sum
mer playing against some profes
sional players in a San Francisco
league, and he competed at the Na
tional Sports Festival in Baton
Rouge, La. Brown's return may
force the 6-4 Lichti to seek time at
small forward, though.
Guard Terry Taylor may get his
chance early on as Ramee's backup.
Junior John Paye, who took over
the point at times last year as well
as starting at off guard, will likely

need some time after football
season ends before returning to ac
tion on the court.
Center Derek Bruton and for
ward Bryan McSweeney may not
be ready to step in right away, but
Davis is not going to redshirt them
yet. "I think we're best off not
thinking about that until the first
week of November," Davis said.
Among the returning lettermen
are guard Novian Whitsitt, power
forward Greg Butler and Reveno,
all of whom started last season.
Guards John "Scooter" Williams and
Scott Meinert and forward Neil Wil
liams also lettered last season.
The Cardinal opens at Maples on
Nov. 8 with an exhibition game
against the Australian National
Team, which defeated a visiting
Pac-10 team this summer and
finished seventh at the 1984 Olym
pics. The regular season begins
Nov. 26 against George Washington.
