Klinghoffer's Body Identified
WASHINGTON — A man's body that washed up on the Syrian
shore was identified today as that of 69-year-old Leon Klinghoffer of
New York, the State Department said.
"We have positive identification," said department spokesman Joe
Reap this morning. He said he was notified by U.S. embassy officials
in Damascus that post-mortem examination had determined that the
body was that of the wheel-chair-bound Klinghoffer, who reportedly
was killed by Palestinian terrorists when he was aboard the hijacked
cruise liner Achille Lauro.
The body was brought to Damascus from the coastal region of
Tartus yesterday and Western diplomatic sources and a physician
said it appeared to have been in the sea for at least a week before
washing ashore Monday.
Reap said the body had "two apparent gunshot wounds" but he
had no further details on the condition of the body or of reports by
CBS news that it had been mutilated.
"An autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of death,"
he said, adding that the body would be returned to the United States,
but he did not know where or when the autopsy would be performed.
MIT Professor Wins Nobel Prize
NEW YORK — Franco Modigliani of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, a Renaissance man of economics whose work has had
broad impact on areas as diverse as corporate finance, the impact of
high federal deficits and patterns of household savings, was named
yesterday as the 1985 Nobel Laureate in economics.
Prominent U.S. economists said Modigliani stands at the intellec
tual forefront of an astonishing range of issues in the field.
"He's extremely versatile," said James Tobin, a Yale economist
and the 1981 Nobel economics laureate. "He's covered almost every
topic."
At a press conference and interviews following yesterday's an
nouncement, Modigliani promptly used his new prominence to
criticize the economic policies of the Reagan Administration.
"I would say the important tiling is to reduce the deficit very
promptly," the 67-year-old MIT professor said in an interview. "I
would personally be ready to reduce defense expenditures."
In its award citation, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences
stressed the importance of Modigliani's pioneering life-cycle hypoth
esis of how people decide whether to spend or save their income.
The theory, since bome out by decades of postwar economic experi
ence, states that people save chiefly to have money for their retire
ment years. That explains why savings rates decline as national pen
sion plans, such as Social Security, improve.
The theory contradicted prewar economics, which was based on
the Great Depression experience.
Modigliani said that he would use his prize money "in accordance
with my own theories of how people behave — namely, distribute it
ovei the rest of my life. I'm not going to go on a binge.,l will use it
gradually. That's what my theory says people do." r
Soviets Reveal Plan for Growth
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev announced yester
day a visionary plan that calls for almost doubling economic output
over the next 15 years on the basis of harder work and greater effi
ciency.
The Kremlin chief outlined broad targets for a speedy pickup in
the sluggish Soviet economy at a plenum of the Communist Party's
Central Committee.
Western analysts said the goals were ambitious but more realistic
than the last, overly optimistic party program promoted by then-
Premier Nikita Khrushchev in 1961. In what now is regarded as a po
litical fantasy, Khrushchev said then that the Soviet Union would out
strip the U.S. economy by 1970 and would be six times as productive
by 1980.
Gorbachev, without referring to his predecessor by name, said
the new program was free of "groundless fantasies," but he envi
sioned a historical breakthrough toward'a higher standard of living.
"We are planning in the next 15 years to create an economic po
tential approximately in equal scale to what had been accumulated
throughout the previous (68) years of Soviet government and to in
crease almost two-fold the national income and industrial output,"
Gorbachev said.
"Labor productivity is to go up 130 percent to 150 percent (by the
end of the century)," Gorbachev told a closed session of the party's
300 or so top leaders.
"We must continue speeding up the rate of our onward movement
while improving discipline and order in everything Gorbachev
insisted.
Apartheid Sanctions Sought
NASSAU, Bahamas — Great Britain came under increasing pres
sure yesterday from many of its former colonies to agree to some
form of joint action to punish South Africa for its policy of apartheid.
The issue of South Africa dominated the private meetings and hall
way conversations as delegates began arriving here for the biennial
meeting of the 49 member Commonwealth Heads of Government,
an association of one-time British colonies and possessions as well as
the mother country itself. Britain's Queen Elizabeth II will open the
meeting today.
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who will arrive just
hours before the meeting officially opens, has refused to take any ac
tion against South Africa beyond expressing repugnance for the sys
tem of racial separation and white superiority.
In particular, Thatcher has rejected mandatory economic sanc
tions, arguing that they do not work.
But nearly all the delegates here agree that some action must be
taken to increase pressure for a change, with many advocating some
form of economic boycott.
Sir Shridath Serendranath, secretary-general of the Common
wealth. told reporters yesterday that while he remains optimistic
about forging an agreement that Great Britain and the others can
support when the conference ends on Oct. 22, he believes that the
Commonwealth will act anyway with or without Thatcher's endorse
ment.
There were several movements under way to find some common
ground.
One possible compromise being discussed by Canada and
Australia would set a schedule of deadlines for reforms and. if those
are not tnet, Commonwealth members would impose corresponding
penalties.
