# Panel Pummels Booklet
## 
### JOHN CALLON 
Citing factual inaccuracies and gross
negligence in formulation, panelists at an
African and Afro-American Studies
sponsored discussion yesterday blasted a
University publication called "Stanford
and South Africa."
The booklet was intended to provide
background on political developments in
South Africa and outline approaches to the
divestment issue.
The 20-page booklet, released by Stan
ford's Office of Public Affairs and dis
tributed to student residences, was char
acterized as a "slap in the face" by several
panelists at the meeting outside the
African and Afro-American Studies Pro
gram offices.
Assoc. History Prof. Kennell Jackson,
director of African and Afro-American
Studies, called the contents of the
pamphlet "highly objectionable" and its
publication a "provocative act," later add

ing that he found it "a kind of propaganda"
and "f^kery."
"There are many questions about the
pamphlet. . . it disappointed me terribly,"
said Jackson, who was one of three pro
fessors on the panel.
Panelists pointed to numerous inac
curacies, errors of omission, exclusion of
expert opinion and biased assumptions as
the primary categories of objection.
Anthropology Prof. James Gibbs, direc
tor of the Stanford/Berkeley Joint Center
on African Studies, decried a "distortion
of facts." He cited the use of outdated ter
minology, such as the names "Hottentot"
and "bushmen," as typical of imprecision
in the report.
Education Prof. Joel Samoff called the
characterization of South Africa as a "big,
empty place" before the 16th and 17th
centuries "all wrong," citing in addition
the representation of a unified Afrikaaner
population as a "convenient view. It's
simply not accurate."
Samoff felt that the historical section

causes the reader to "lose a sense of his
tory. You lose a sense of the (black) South
African's perspective of their world."
Jackson said that President Reagan's
" 'active' constructive engagement" is ac
tually not a policy, as the pamphlet indi
cates.
"It was a statement wrung out of
(Reagan) at a press conference. That's
not a 'policy.' "
Senior Donna Anderson, who found the
"whole attitude of the pamphlet conde
scending," declared that "the things left
out (of the pamphlet) speak louder than
what is in here." Jackson agreed, and was
particularly bothered by the exclusion of
"the element of violence, the magnitude
(of it)," explaining that it distorted the
reader's view of the present political sit
uation.
All of the panelists found fault with the
pamphlet's claims of neutrality. Senior
Steve Phillips, chairman of the Black Stu-


Director of African and Afro-American Studies Kennell
Jackson, senior Steve Phillips, Anthropology James
Gibbs, senior Donna Anderson and Education Prof.

dent Union, said that "the underly
ing premise (of the pamphlet) is
that the South African government
is a legitimate representative insti
tution. . .it is about how to help the
South African government make
reforms, rather than how to help
the struggling people achieve their
liberties."
The booklet "presents only a

positive image of the Pretorian gov
ernment," Anderson said.
Referring to a political option in
the booklet that suggested blacks in
South Africa be given the right to
vote in blocks of 10 percent over a
10-year period, Samoff asked
rhetorically, "From whose perspec
tive is that option written?" He
added that the option disregards
the opinion of the black majority in
South Africa.
The three professors were
annoyed that scholars on African af
fairs were not consulted.

"The oversight of African
scholars is to be taken seriously.
We were overlooked," Gibbs said.
"It was a mistake," Jackson said.
"The ignoring of the community of
Africanists who could have cor
rected some of the errors."
He continued, "(The lack of con
sultation) disappointed me terribly.
In this situation (Kennedy) just said
'I'm going to grab the higher
ground.' After all that talk last Com
mencement, he is acting totally on
his own."

The booklet included an opening
letter from Kennedy that warned
that those "already-committed,"
may find the publication
"unsatisfactorily neutral."
"I have a different view of him
now. Debate? He should be the one
to respect it, because he's uphold
ing it all the time," Jackson said.
Phillips said that the publication
was a "slap in the face" to blacks,
and linked it to the administration's
general posture in dealing with the
apartheid/divestment issue.

"Putting this booklet out was not
an isolated incident. They did not
talk to Africans, they did not talk to
experts." He cited the Bunzel
report on theme houses as a second
example of a lack of consultation.
Samoff expressed regret that
the pamphlet represented a
"missed opportunity." At first he
thought he had missed a unique
chance to help formulate the
pamphlet, he said, but upon reading
the first paragraph realized that "I
had it all backwards. We missed an

extraordinary opportunity to in
clude thousands across campus in a
discussion. . . and put something
really valuable out."
The entire approach of the book
let was faulty, according to Gibbs.
"The strategy was all wrong," he
said. His suggestion was to let each
set of proponents state their own
case. "We can make up our own
minds."
Phillips said that "if we applied
the Sullivan Principles to Stanford,
Stanford would not pass them."

The booklet "presents only a

positive image of the Pretorian gov
ernment," Anderson said.
Referring to a political option in
the booklet that suggested blacks in
South Africa be given the right to
vote in blocks of 10 percent over a
10-year period, Samoff asked
rhetorically, "From whose perspec
tive is that option written?" He
added that the option disregards
the opinion of the black majority in
South Africa.
The three professors were
annoyed that scholars on African af
fairs were not consulted.

"The oversight of African
scholars is to be taken seriously.
We were overlooked," Gibbs said.
"It was a mistake," Jackson said.
"The ignoring of the community of
Africanists who could have cor
rected some of the errors."
He continued, "(The lack of con
sultation) disappointed me terribly.
In this situation (Kennedy) just said
'I'm going to grab the higher
ground.' After all that talk last Com
mencement, he is acting totally on
his own."

The booklet included an opening
letter from Kennedy that warned
that those "already-committed,"
may find the publication
"unsatisfactorily neutral."
"I have a different view of him
now. Debate? He should be the one
to respect it, because he's uphold
ing it all the time," Jackson said.
Phillips said that the publication
was a "slap in the face" to blacks,
and linked it to the administration's
general posture in dealing with the
apartheid/divestment issue.

"Putting this booklet out was not
an isolated incident. They did not
talk to Africans, they did not talk to
experts." He cited the Bunzel
report on theme houses as a second
example of a lack of consultation.
Samoff expressed regret that
the pamphlet represented a
"missed opportunity." At first he
thought he had missed a unique
chance to help formulate the
pamphlet, he said, but upon reading
the first paragraph realized that "I
had it all backwards. We missed an

extraordinary opportunity to in
clude thousands across campus in a
discussion. . . and put something
really valuable out."
The entire approach of the book
let was faulty, according to Gibbs.
"The strategy was all wrong," he
said. His suggestion was to let each
set of proponents state their own
case. "We can make up our own
minds."
Phillips said that "if we applied
the Sullivan Principles to Stanford,
Stanford would not pass them."
Citing factual inaccuracies and gross
negligence in formulation, panelists at an
African and Afro-American Studies
sponsored discussion yesterday blasted a
University publication called "Stanford
and South Africa."
The booklet was intended to provide
background on political developments in
South Africa and outline approaches to the
divestment issue.
The 20-page booklet, released by Stan
ford's Office of Public Affairs and dis
tributed to student residences, was char
acterized as a "slap in the face" by several
panelists at the meeting outside the
African and Afro-American Studies Pro
gram offices.
Assoc. History Prof. Kennell Jackson,
director of African and Afro-American
Studies, called the contents of the
pamphlet "highly objectionable" and its
publication a "provocative act," later add

ing that he found it "a kind of propaganda"
and "f^kery."
"There are many questions about the
pamphlet. . . it disappointed me terribly,"
said Jackson, who was one of three pro
fessors on the panel.
Panelists pointed to numerous inac
curacies, errors of omission, exclusion of
expert opinion and biased assumptions as
the primary categories of objection.
Anthropology Prof. James Gibbs, direc
tor of the Stanford/Berkeley Joint Center
on African Studies, decried a "distortion
of facts." He cited the use of outdated ter
minology, such as the names "Hottentot"
and "bushmen," as typical of imprecision
in the report.
Education Prof. Joel Samoff called the
characterization of South Africa as a "big,
empty place" before the 16th and 17th
centuries "all wrong," citing in addition
the representation of a unified Afrikaaner
population as a "convenient view. It's
simply not accurate."
Samoff felt that the historical section

causes the reader to "lose a sense of his
tory. You lose a sense of the (black) South
African's perspective of their world."
Jackson said that President Reagan's
" 'active' constructive engagement" is ac
tually not a policy, as the pamphlet indi
cates.
"It was a statement wrung out of
(Reagan) at a press conference. That's
not a 'policy.' "
Senior Donna Anderson, who found the
"whole attitude of the pamphlet conde
scending," declared that "the things left
out (of the pamphlet) speak louder than
what is in here." Jackson agreed, and was
particularly bothered by the exclusion of
"the element of violence, the magnitude
(of it)," explaining that it distorted the
reader's view of the present political sit
uation.
All of the panelists found fault with the
pamphlet's claims of neutrality. Senior
