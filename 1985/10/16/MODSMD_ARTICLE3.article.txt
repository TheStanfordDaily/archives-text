# Panel Pummels Booklet

### JOHN CALLON 
Citing factual inaccuracies and gross
negligence in formulation, panelists at an
African and Afro-American Studies
sponsored discussion yesterday blasted a
University publication called "Stanford
and South Africa."
The booklet was intended to provide
background on political developments in
South Africa and outline approaches to the
divestment issue.
The 20-page booklet, released by Stan
ford's Office of Public Affairs and dis
tributed to student residences, was char
acterized as a "slap in the face" by several
panelists at the meeting outside the
African and Afro-American Studies Pro
gram offices.
Assoc. History Prof. Kennell Jackson,
director of African and Afro-American
Studies, called the contents of the
pamphlet "highly objectionable" and its
publication a "provocative act," later add

ing that he found it "a kind of propaganda"
and "f^kery."
"There are many questions about the
pamphlet. . . it disappointed me terribly,"
said Jackson, who was one of three pro
fessors on the panel.
Panelists pointed to numerous inac
curacies, errors of omission, exclusion of
expert opinion and biased assumptions as
the primary categories of objection.
Anthropology Prof. James Gibbs, direc
tor of the Stanford/Berkeley Joint Center
on African Studies, decried a "distortion
of facts." He cited the use of outdated ter
minology, such as the names "Hottentot"
and "bushmen," as typical of imprecision
in the report.
Education Prof. Joel Samoff called the
characterization of South Africa as a "big,
empty place" before the 16th and 17th
centuries "all wrong," citing in addition
the representation of a unified Afrikaaner
population as a "convenient view. It's
simply not accurate."
Samoff felt that the historical section

causes the reader to "lose a sense of his
tory. You lose a sense of the (black) South
African's perspective of their world."
Jackson said that President Reagan's
" 'active' constructive engagement" is ac
tually not a policy, as the pamphlet indi
cates.
"It was a statement wrung out of
(Reagan) at a press conference. That's
not a 'policy.' "
Senior Donna Anderson, who found the
"whole attitude of the pamphlet conde
scending," declared that "the things left
out (of the pamphlet) speak louder than
what is in here." Jackson agreed, and was
particularly bothered by the exclusion of
"the element of violence, the magnitude
(of it)," explaining that it distorted the
reader's view of the present political sit
uation.
All of the panelists found fault with the
pamphlet's claims of neutrality. Senior
Steve Phillips, chairman of the Black Stu-


Director of African and Afro-American Studies Kennell
Jackson, senior Steve Phillips, Anthropology James
Gibbs, senior Donna Anderson and Education Prof.
