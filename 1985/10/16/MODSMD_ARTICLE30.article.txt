## Reagan Refuses To Apologize 
### 
BOISE, Idaho — President Reagan gave a
one-word response yesterday to Egyptian Presi
dent Hosni Mubarak's demand for a U.S. apology
for forcing an Egyptian airliner to land in Italy
with the hijackers of the cruise ship Achille
Lauro: "Never."
The blunt reply, uttered sternly at the Boise
airport where Reagan was cheered for last
week's retaliation against the Palestinian terror
ists, seemed certain to aggravate an already
serious setback in U.S. relations with both
Egypt and Italy.
Although it-had been learned earlier that no
apology would be made for the diversion of the
Egyptian plane, the Administration had carefully
avoided commenting on Mubarak's angry
demand until Reagan was able to make his
response. Mubarak made his demand for an apol
ogy Monday, labeling the action by U.S. Navy
jets "an act of piracy."
However, U.S. officials have declined to
criticize Mubarak personally, even though they
have made it clear that the United States
disagreed with Egypt's decision to grant the ter
rorists safe passage in exchange for their sur
render of the Italian liner and its more than 500

hostages. They also said they believed that the
decision had been made before Egypt knew that
69-year-old American Leon Klinghoffer had been
killed.
In Brussels, Secretary of State George
Shultz, holding a press conference after attend
ing a NATO meeting yesterday, defended the
steps taken by the United States as necessary in
the fight against terrorism. He indignantly
rejected a question suggesting that America had
itself employed a terrorist method when it used
armed aircraft to force down the hijackers' plane.
"It was a perfectly proper act to do, using our
planes to bring hijackers to justice, which is what
has happened," he said. "We've heard lots of
statements of elation at this meeting."
At the same time, U.S. officials vowed to con
tinue its pursuit of Palestine Liberation Front
leader Abul Abbas, who was allowed to leave
Italy for Yugoslavia on Saturday.
Shultz also scolded Italian Foreign Minister
Giulio Andreotti yesterday for his government's
decision to let Abbas leave Italy. The Italian offi
cial responded equally strongly, complaining of
unwarranted American pressure on his govern
ment.

Shultz told Andreotti that he found Italy's ac
tions "incomprehensible" in a brief meeting at
the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization here, U.S. officials said.
But Andreotti, whose coalition government is
in danger of falling because of the furor over the
release of Palestine Liberation Front leader Abul
Abbas, responded that Rome's action had been
legally correct, Italian diplomats said.
Abbas, accused of masterminding the hijack
ing, was aboard the Egyptian plane carrying the
four Palestinians, but the governments of both
Rome and Belgrade refused to detain him for the
United States.
Ironically, as relations with such U.S. friends
as Italy and Egypt have been strained by the
hijacking and its immediate repercussions, the
crisis seems to have contributed to a warming of
the once frozen relations with Syria.
State Department spokesman Charles Red
man praised the Damascus government for its
help in efforts to determine if the body of an el
derly man that has washed ashore on the coast of
Syria was that of Klinghoffer. "We are working
very closely, and it's been a very cooperative re
lationship with the Syrians," Redman said.
