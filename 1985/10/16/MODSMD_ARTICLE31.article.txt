# Brush Fires Rage in S. California
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES — Air tankers
bombed wildfires with chemicals
yesterday as firefighters, aided by a
letup in Santa Ana winds, squared
off against flames that had burned at
least 52,000 acres and 22 homes in
Southern California.
Arson is suspected in three of
the major fires, officials said.
After the hot, dry desert winds
Monday and yesterday lowered
humidity to 9 percent, turning
parched brushland into a
firefighter's nightmare, airplanes
laden with fire-snuffing chemicals
targeted two blazes roaring near
Malibu.

"We had the fire burning right up
to the walls of the (Malibu) sheriff's
office" yesterday morning, said Los
Angeles County sheriffs Sgt.
Ronald Wallach. "It was like being
within 100 yards of a napalm
strike."
But county fire inspector Mike
Pearson said fire crews had an im
portant ally yesterday in the
weather as the Santa Ana condition
eased.
"The wind's dying down a bit,"
he said.
Firefighters gained an upper
hand over the 5,800-acre Decker
Canyon and the 3,300-acre Piuma

Canyon blazes in Malibu yesterday
afternoon, with 50 percent and 30
percent containment, respectively.
But elsewhere the wind letup
didn't help much.
In Ventura County, two fires
combined a few miles north of Santa
Paula and about 50 miles northwest
of Los Angeles, scorching more
than 26,500 acres and consuming
10 homes, two trailers and several
outbuildings and cars, said county
fire spokeswoman Penny Miller.
In Tapo Canyon, near Simi Val
ley, about 35 miles northwest of
Los Angeles, a fire that consumed

10,000 acres prompted 3,500 stu
dents to flee from Moorpark Col
lege when the blaze came within a
few miles of the campus. That fire
was only 10 percent contained yes
terday night, Miller said.
Three other Ventura County
fires estimated at more than 1,000
acres each were reported out of
control yesterday afternoon, said
Hank Weston, spokesman for the
California Department of Forestry.
No structures were lost, but the
Peach Hill fire seven miles north of
Thousand Oaks threatened 200-300
homes and evacuations had been
ordered, he said.
