Helicopter Crashes
JACKSONVILLE, N.C. —A helicopter car
rying 19 Marines plunged into the ocean while
taking off from a ship for maneuvers in pre
dawn darkness yesterday, and officials said 15
Marines were killed and four rescued.
Gunnery Sgt. John Simmons said the twin
rotor CH-46D "Sea Knight" helicopter, flown
by a crew of four, crashed in 50 feet of water
about four miles off shore on takeoff from the
USS Guadalcanal.
One body was recovered shortly after the 6
a.m. accident, and four survivors were plucked
from the water near the carrier-like helicopter
and troop ship, Simmons said.
Navy and Marine divers conducted a search
and rescue operation in Onslow Bay much of
the day for more survivors, but Simmons said
the effort was called off in late afternoon and
hope had been abandoned of finding anyone
else alive.
The cause of the accident was under investi
gation.
Malpractice Ruling
WASHINGTON — Over a lone dissent, the
Supreme Court rejected yesterday a challenge

to a hotly debated California law limiting
damage awards for pain and suffering in medi
cal malpractice cases.
The court's action provided at least a tem
porary green light to states to impose medical
malpractice award limitations. By recent
count, five other states currently place limits
on pain and suffering awards of $200,000 to
$500,000 and three others now limit total
malpractice awards.
More than three dozen states are consider
ing a wide range of medical malpractice bills.
The court dismissed an appeal of a 4-3 ruling
last February by the California Supreme Court
that affirmed a $250,000 maximum award on
so-called non-economic damages as a means of
controlling medical malpractice awards and in
surance costs.
Justice Byron White cast the single vote to
hear the case, saying that the justices should
resolve the constitutional issues surrounding
such limitations before more states enact
similar legislation in the wake of "continued na
tional concern over the malpractice crisis."
Tax Plan Hits Snag
WASHINGTON — The House Ways and
Means Committee's efforts to produce a tax

overhaul plan stumbled into confusion yester
day over the controversial issue of charitable
deductions and the panel suffered a potentially
crippling setback as it put aside its work for at
least a week.
Action ground to a halt because the commit
tee's chairman, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski CD-
Ill.), was preparing to lead a delegation of 48
House members into negotiations with Senate
leaders over a proposal to mandate major
spending cuts to achieve a balanced federal
budget within six years. Included in the
delegation will be 16 members of the Ways and
Means panel.
Both supporters and opponents said they
are not ready to consider President Reagan's
tax revision plan dead for the year but they
suggested that the prospects of approval
before the House adjourns in several weeks
are rapidly declining.
Stocks Close Mixed
NEW YORK — The stock market took a
breather from its recent advance with a mixed
showing in active trading yesterday.
Prices opened higher and it appeared the
market was ready to score its sixth con
secutive gain.
