10 Lottery Finalists
PICO RIVERA — A 71-year-old janitor and
a self-employed truck driver were among 10
lucky lottery players picked yesterday to spin
a roulette wheel for a chance at the state's first
$2 million jackpot.
"It's giving me a headache thinking about
it," said Lillian Barlow, 58, one of the finalists
and a housewife in the Southern California des
ert community of Little Rock.
The 10 were picked in a drawing from
among 6,250 players who had qualified by win
ning $100 prizes in the first scratch-off ticket
game. Each of the finalists will spin a 100-slot
wheel in the first weekly televised drawing
Oct. 28 for prizes of $10,000 to $2 million.
Each finalist will win at least $10,000, since
there are forty $10,000 slots, thirty $50,000
slots, twenty $100,000 slots and ten $2 million
slots.
A crowd of about 100 people in the Pico
Rivera Sports Arena, 10 miles southeast of
downtown Los Angeles, watched as green
capsules containing the 10 numbers were

plucked from a large plastic drum.
Janitor James Fair of Oakland, interviewed
by phone, didn't believe the lottery officials
who called to tell him he was a finalist.
"I thought they had got me mixed up with
someone else. It couldn't be me. It was my
birthday a few days ago. I'm 71 years old. So I
thought they pulled a joke or something like
that," Fair said.
Western Shuttle Port
VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE —
The Air Force declared America's second
spaceport ready yesterday for the first West
Coast launch of a space shuttle next March,
and President Reagan hailed it as "another
giant step."
"We're ready to begin preparations for our
launch early next year," Air Force Capt. Rick
Sanford said of the flight in which the shuttle
Discovery will be the first spacecraft to carry
humans into polar orbit.
Six of seven members of the March 20 crew

appeared at the shuttle maintenance building
after 1,000 workers who built the launch-and
landing complex heard Air Force Under
secretary Edward Aldridge, included in the
crew, read the congratulatory message from
the president.
Reagan's comments echoed those of Neil
Armstrong, who called his 1969 moon walk,
man's first, "one small step for man, a giant
leap for mankind."
"Today the country takes another giant step
in the already very successful space shuttle
program by the completion of the Vandenberg
Space Shuttle Launch and Landing Complex,"
Reagan said. "You have added a significant
new capability that will allow the space shuttle
to fly over any part of the world, a very impor
tant addition to the already impressive list of
unique shuttle attributes."
Sanford said yesterday's private ceremony
marked the end of the five-year construction
period for the new $2.8 billion space shuttle
port at this coastal military base about 150
miles northwest of Los Angeles.
