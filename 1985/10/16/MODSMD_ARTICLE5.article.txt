# Researchers Document Comeback from AIDS

### MICHAEL GOFF Staff writer 
A woman who had been found to be carry
ing the antibody associated with the virus
thought to cause AIDS has apparently
recovered, reported Stanford researchers
along with the Pasteur Institute in Paris in
this month's Annals of Internal Medicine.
The case is significant because "the appar
ent resolution of the virus infection is some
thing that has never been described," accord
ing to William Robinson, Stanford professor of
medicine and an author of the report. He cau
tioned, however, that the woman had neither
the symptoms of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome nor the disease itself. "To describe
it as a recovery from AIDS is a total
mistake."
Other researchers included Harold Berger
and Barbara Weiser who are now at the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, and
Edgar Engleman, director of the Stanford
blood center.
According to tjhe report, the woman's hus
band, a 35-year-old hemophiliac, developed
AIDS from contaminated blood products and
probably infected her through sexual contact.
Doctors at Stanford have declined to identify
the couple.
In January 1984, the woman developed
swollen lymph glands, and her blood was
found to contain antibodies associated with
AIDS. These antibodies are proteins
produced by the body in response to an at
tack by the virus believed to cause AIDS. In
addition, Robinson said the level of the
woman's T-helper cells fell below a normal
range — one of the first abnormalities seen in
AIDS patients.
When notified of the test results, the
woman and her husband started using con
doms during sexual intercourse to prevent
further infection, the report said. Semen and
blood are two of the bodily fluids that are
thought to transmit AIDS.
A month later, the woman's test results
had remained the same. But in April 1984,
tests showed that her "T-cell numbers
returned to normal and the antibodies disap

peared from her blood," Robinson said. In ad
dition, the woman's swollen lymph glands
were normal.
Tests over the next six months found no
trace of the infection, and Robinson said the
couple's two preschool children show no
signs of AIDS. The husband, however, died
of the disease in September 1984.
"This is the first case where somebody has
resolved the infection and where T-cells have
returned to normal. . . . The usual course in
the patients that have been followed is the
persistence of the virus," Robinson said.
Though he cautioned that "to really establish
that this is really a permanent state will take a
follow-up" over the course of a number of
years.
Doctors said the case, while not a recovery
from AIDS, may indicate that a change in
sexual practices can help people infected with
the virus from coming down with the disease
that has already claimed more than 7,000
lives.
"If you alter your lifestyle early enough
. . . maybe you can clear the AIDS virus and
AIDS antibody," said John Conte, chief of
infectious diseases at the University of Cali
fornia at San Francisco.
"I don't think this is a great discovery. To a
virologist it is not surprising that some
patients can control the virus," Robinson
said. The lack of previous cases like this one
may be because few patients who are not
members of high-risk groups have been fol
lowed, according to Robinson. Currently,
large studies of the virus are concentrating on
previously identified high-risk groups.
Robinson said the virus can infect the body
without automatically leading to the disease
itself and that cases like this one might be
more easily found in African populations
where the virus is more widespread, more
evenly distributed between men and women
and where a lower percentage develop the
disease.
The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
estimates that one million or more people
may be infected with the AIDS virus in the
United States, but only a fraction — perhaps
as high as 20 percent — are expected to
eventually come down with the disease.
