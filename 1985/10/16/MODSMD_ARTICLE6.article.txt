# Treating Kids With Hospitality
## 
### SHERNAZ DAVER 
A little boy drags his IV machine into the
playroom; the girl down the hall learns to use her
walking braces; a doctor explains cancer to par
ents. It is a typical morning at the Children's
Hospital at Stanford.
The hospital, which started 60 years ago as a
convalescent home for children, has grown into a
large center for treating chronic and lifelong ill
nesses such as cancer, orthopedic disabilities
and pulmonary problems.
Located at 520 Willow Road, the hospital has
four in-patient wings, three clinic areas for oncol
ogy, cardiology and allergies, and a day center
for chemotherapy and blood transfusions.
Aside from sharing the Stanford Hospital's
facilities and using doctors and interns from the
Medical Center, the hospital is independent of
the University. It is a non-profit organization
which covers most of its $21 million annual ex
penditure through patient charges, medical in
surances and government funding.
Most of the patients, who range from infants
to teenagers, are referred to the hospital
through outside physicians or one of its 12
doctors. Though a large number of them are
from California, several are from other states
and overseas.
Recently, the hospital treated a young boy
from Afghanistan.
Treatment for most of the illnesses the hospi

tal deals with take several years. Patients make
regular visits for therapy, but rarely stay for
more than a week.
Dr. Mike Amylon, pediatrician in the hematol
ogy and oncology department, said the hospital
tries "to keep the patients out of the hospital"
and introduce "them back into things they were
doing before as much and as soon as possible."
Amylon, a 1976 Stanford graduate, said
chronic illnesses are the "worst catastrophic

'It is hard to be doing pain
ful procedures on very
young children because
they are frightened, hurt,
or don't understand.'

event for a family. It disrupts life physically,
emotionally and financially."
Grace Gutierrez, mother of a child with lym
phoblastic leukemia (a disease in which
numerous white blood cells in the lymph glands
are immature and cannot fight infection) remem
bers the moment she found out her son Danny
was ill. "I did not want to talk about it, did not
want to think about it. It was total devastation,"
she said.

The Gutierrez family has changed its life
style to accommodate four-year-old Danny's ill
ness. His parents stay with him during the day
while his uncle and a sitter look after his two
year-old brother.
Parents who cannot commute daily stay in the
Ronald McDonald House on the hospital
grounds. Built in 1978, the house is largely
funded by McDonald's restaurant owners and
operators, allowing families to rent $5-a-day
rooms for a few months.
Most, if not all, parents find it difficult to ac
cept a child's illness.
Rosemary Harris, director of the hospital's
recreation therapy department, said, "Parents
want to do right, kiss their children's 'boo-boos,'
but can't do it with this (chronic illness)."
Patients, too, find it difficult to understand or
accept their illness.
"It is hard to be doing painful procedures on
very young children because they are fright
ened, hurt and don't understand," said Amylon,
who has worked at the hospital for-four years.
He added that teenagers have a feeling of
"omnipotence, thinking 'nothing bad can happen
to me.' " This makes it "difficult for them to ac
cept that something bad has happened to them
which keeps them from peers, school."
The hospital's physicians encourage the par
ents and child to learn about the patient's illness
and treatment.
Amylon said some parents of
ten do not discuss the illness with
their child because they are trying
to protect the child. But he added
that this "usually makes it worse
as the child is more frightened."
However, most parents do dis
cuss the illness and treatment
with their child.
Gutierrez said Danny is young
and does not really understand
leukemia. Danny, whose illness
was diagnosed 21 months ago,
thinks "losing hair is a part of his
growing up and not because of
chemotherapy."
Gutierrez added that when
Danny specifically asks about his
illness "then I will tell him just
about anything he wants to
know."
Parents are actively involved in
every step of their child's treat
ment. Gutierrez said at first it was
hard to understand hospital jar
gon, but now she knows what's
going on.
She and her husband hook up
Danny's IVs, chart his progress
and bring him to the hospital for
therapy.
Parents also take part in their
child's social activities. The
recreation department regularly
plans games, shows, and outdoor
camps. This past summer it put
on a fashion show with Nordstrom
and it will organize a pumpkin car
ving session at the end of the
month.
Harris said most parents think
of the recreation personnel as
"non-threatening people" and
"appreciate time spent with their
kids because we make them
laugh."
The recreation department,
like most of the other depart
ments, largely relies on volun

teers to spend time with the
children.
Charlene Mattos, volunteer co
ordinator, said the approximately
140 volunteers from Stanford and
the community "provide a really
important service." They make up
games with the children, read to
them or help in their therapy.
Two volunteer groups of senior
citizens make monkeys from
Rockford socks for the young
children. Every child gets one on
arriving at the hospital, and it is

theirs to keep.
Carla Ponti, a sophomore who
volunteered last year, said she
feels good being there because
the "kids are so happy and
hyper."
She admits that volunteering is
a big time commitment, at least
four hours a week for six months,
but she loves "to see the children
smile" because she has "done
something good."
While there is no doubt that
hospitals can have a depressing

mood, most people involved with
the Children's Hospital find the
children help them to keep a posi
tive attitude.
Harris loves seeing them laugh;
Ponti feels good being with them;
and Gutierrez carries on because
of her son's smiling face.
"He undergoes spinal taps and
chemotherapy which look painful,
but he stands up and goes," she
said. "Well shoot, if it doesn't
bother him it's not going to bother

me.

A volunteer at the Stanford Children's Hospital spends time with a leukemia patient. Volun
teers like this one put in four hours a week for six months, providing personal attention to
these young patients.
A little boy drags his IV machine into the
playroom; the girl down the hall learns to use her
walking braces; a doctor explains cancer to par
ents. It is a typical morning at the Children's
Hospital at Stanford.
The hospital, which started 60 years ago as a
convalescent home for children, has grown into a
large center for treating chronic and lifelong ill
nesses such as cancer, orthopedic disabilities
and pulmonary problems.
Located at 520 Willow Road, the hospital has
four in-patient wings, three clinic areas for oncol
ogy, cardiology and allergies, and a day center
for chemotherapy and blood transfusions.
Aside from sharing the Stanford Hospital's
facilities and using doctors and interns from the
Medical Center, the hospital is independent of
the University. It is a non-profit organization
which covers most of its $21 million annual ex
penditure through patient charges, medical in
surances and government funding.
Most of the patients, who range from infants
to teenagers, are referred to the hospital
through outside physicians or one of its 12
doctors. Though a large number of them are
from California, several are from other states
and overseas.
Recently, the hospital treated a young boy
from Afghanistan.
Treatment for most of the illnesses the hospi

tal deals with take several years. Patients make
regular visits for therapy, but rarely stay for
more than a week.
Dr. Mike Amylon, pediatrician in the hematol
ogy and oncology department, said the hospital
tries "to keep the patients out of the hospital"
and introduce "them back into things they were
doing before as much and as soon as possible."
Amylon, a 1976 Stanford graduate, said
chronic illnesses are the "worst catastrophic

'It is hard to be doing pain
ful procedures on very
young children because
they are frightened, hurt,
or don't understand.'

event for a family. It disrupts life physically,
emotionally and financially."
Grace Gutierrez, mother of a child with lym
phoblastic leukemia (a disease in which
numerous white blood cells in the lymph glands
are immature and cannot fight infection) remem
bers the moment she found out her son Danny
was ill. "I did not want to talk about it, did not
want to think about it. It was total devastation,"
she said.

The Gutierrez family has changed its life
style to accommodate four-year-old Danny's ill
ness. His parents stay with him during the day
while his uncle and a sitter look after his two
year-old brother.
Parents who cannot commute daily stay in the
Ronald McDonald House on the hospital
grounds. Built in 1978, the house is largely
funded by McDonald's restaurant owners and
operators, allowing families to rent $5-a-day
rooms for a few months.
Most, if not all, parents find it difficult to ac
cept a child's illness.
Rosemary Harris, director of the hospital's
recreation therapy department, said, "Parents
want to do right, kiss their children's 'boo-boos,'
but can't do it with this (chronic illness)."
Patients, too, find it difficult to understand or
accept their illness.
"It is hard to be doing painful procedures on
very young children because they are fright
ened, hurt and don't understand," said Amylon,
who has worked at the hospital for-four years.
He added that teenagers have a feeling of
"omnipotence, thinking 'nothing bad can happen
to me.' " This makes it "difficult for them to ac
cept that something bad has happened to them
which keeps them from peers, school."
The hospital's physicians encourage the par
ents and child to learn about the patient's illness
and treatment.
Amylon said some parents of
ten do not discuss the illness with
their child because they are trying
to protect the child. But he added
that this "usually makes it worse
as the child is more frightened."
However, most parents do dis
cuss the illness and treatment
with their child.
Gutierrez said Danny is young
and does not really understand
leukemia. Danny, whose illness
was diagnosed 21 months ago,
thinks "losing hair is a part of his
growing up and not because of
chemotherapy."
Gutierrez added that when
Danny specifically asks about his
illness "then I will tell him just
about anything he wants to
know."
Parents are actively involved in
every step of their child's treat
ment. Gutierrez said at first it was
hard to understand hospital jar
gon, but now she knows what's
going on.
She and her husband hook up
Danny's IVs, chart his progress
and bring him to the hospital for
therapy.
Parents also take part in their
child's social activities. The
recreation department regularly
plans games, shows, and outdoor
camps. This past summer it put
on a fashion show with Nordstrom
and it will organize a pumpkin car
ving session at the end of the
month.
Harris said most parents think
of the recreation personnel as
"non-threatening people" and
"appreciate time spent with their
kids because we make them
laugh."
The recreation department,
like most of the other depart
ments, largely relies on volun
