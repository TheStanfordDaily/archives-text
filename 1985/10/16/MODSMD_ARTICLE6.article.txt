# Treating Kids With Hospitality

A little boy drags his IV machine into the
playroom; the girl down the hall learns to use her
walking braces; a doctor explains cancer to par
ents. It is a typical morning at the Children's
Hospital at Stanford.
The hospital, which started 60 years ago as a
convalescent home for children, has grown into a
large center for treating chronic and lifelong ill
nesses such as cancer, orthopedic disabilities
and pulmonary problems.
Located at 520 Willow Road, the hospital has
four in-patient wings, three clinic areas for oncol
ogy, cardiology and allergies, and a day center
for chemotherapy and blood transfusions.
Aside from sharing the Stanford Hospital's
facilities and using doctors and interns from the
Medical Center, the hospital is independent of
the University. It is a non-profit organization
which covers most of its $21 million annual ex
penditure through patient charges, medical in
surances and government funding.
Most of the patients, who range from infants
to teenagers, are referred to the hospital
through outside physicians or one of its 12
doctors. Though a large number of them are
from California, several are from other states
and overseas.
Recently, the hospital treated a young boy
from Afghanistan.
Treatment for most of the illnesses the hospi

tal deals with take several years. Patients make
regular visits for therapy, but rarely stay for
more than a week.
Dr. Mike Amylon, pediatrician in the hematol
ogy and oncology department, said the hospital
tries "to keep the patients out of the hospital"
and introduce "them back into things they were
doing before as much and as soon as possible."
Amylon, a 1976 Stanford graduate, said
chronic illnesses are the "worst catastrophic

event for a family. It disrupts life physically,
emotionally and financially."
Grace Gutierrez, mother of a child with lym
phoblastic leukemia (a disease in which
numerous white blood cells in the lymph glands
are immature and cannot fight infection) remem
bers the moment she found out her son Danny
was ill. "I did not want to talk about it, did not
want to think about it. It was total devastation,"
she said.

The Gutierrez family has changed its life
style to accommodate four-year-old Danny's ill
ness. His parents stay with him during the day
while his uncle and a sitter look after his two
year-old brother.
Parents who cannot commute daily stay in the
Ronald McDonald House on the hospital
grounds. Built in 1978, the house is largely
funded by McDonald's restaurant owners and
operators, allowing families to rent $5-a-day
rooms for a few months.
Most, if not all, parents find it difficult to ac
cept a child's illness.
Rosemary Harris, director of the hospital's
recreation therapy department, said, "Parents
want to do right, kiss their children's 'boo-boos,'
but can't do it with this (chronic illness)."
Patients, too, find it difficult to understand or
accept their illness.
"It is hard to be doing painful procedures on
very young children because they are fright
ened, hurt and don't understand," said Amylon,
who has worked at the hospital for-four years.
He added that teenagers have a feeling of
"omnipotence, thinking 'nothing bad can happen
to me.' " This makes it "difficult for them to ac
cept that something bad has happened to them
which keeps them from peers, school."
The hospital's physicians encourage the par
ents and child to learn about the patient's illness
and treatment.
