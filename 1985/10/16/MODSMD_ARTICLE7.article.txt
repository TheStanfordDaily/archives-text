### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
Four students arrested Monday while
protesting apartheid and alleged police
brutality against students arrested
Friday were released from Santa Clara
County Jail early yesterday morning.
Graduate student Bryan Van Norden
said that he, graduate student Eric Die
sel and sophomore David Potter were
issued citations and released between 1
and 2 a.m.
Sophomore Peter Heslin, who had
also been arrested in Friday's protest,
said he was bailed out when members of
a student support group, who later
drove those arrested back to campus,
posted $450 bail at about 2:30 a.m.
The four were among six protesters
arrested Monday for refusing to leave
Old Union when the building closed at 5
p.m. The other two demonstrators,
graduate student John Kennedy and Sta
tistics Prof. Charles Stein (who was the
first professor arrested in the protests
here), were cited and released immedi
ately after being arrested.
The four released yesterday must ap
pear in court on Nov. 18 to face charges
of trespassing, unlawful assembly,
remaining at the scene of an unlawful as
sembly and refusal to disperse from an
unlawful assembly, according to Van
Norden.
Potter, Heslin and Van Norden will
also face the additional charge of resist
ing arrest because they refused to
cooperate with police.
Heslin said that an additional felony
charge made against him when pills were

found in his possession Monday was
dropped when it was determined that
they were Tylenol.
The protesters released yesterday
agreed that they received good treat
ment from the police, unlike the
protesters who complained of police
brutality during and after their arrest
Friday.
Diesel, who stated yesterday that he
is planning to charge the Stanford police
with assault for their actions on Friday,
said, "We were treated pretty well â€”
but none of us was black," referring to
an alleged police beating of Robby
Perkins, one of the protesters arrested
Friday.
Perkins said that he was taken into
isolation, forced to strip and beaten by
policemen during his stay at the North
County Jail in Palo Alto on Friday.
Police were unavailable for comment
last night, but The San Jose Mercury
News reported yesterday that Lt. T.K.
Davis of the Santa Clara County Sheriff s
Department said Perkins had kicked and
screamed at Sgt. Arthur Kirts, the offi
cer Perkins accused of the beating.
According to Davis, Perkins was de
termined by police "to have a high po
tential for violence," and was strip
searched, the newspaper said.
Davis also said that Perkins
repeatedly tried to leave his cell, and
police had to "push him back" each time,
according to the Mercury News.
"When my throat was being throttled I
might have been convulsing in pain and
kicking him in that way. But I wasn't
kicking at an officer," Perkins said in
response to Davis.
