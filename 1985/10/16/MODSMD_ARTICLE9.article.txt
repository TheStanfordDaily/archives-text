# Museum Fills Evening Lulls

The Stanford Museum began an experiment
last night by adding evening hours one night a
week for its fall quarter schedule.
"It's a grand experiment, and we don't know if
it's going to work or not," said Darrell Carey, a
chairperson of the Committee for Art at Stan
ford.
The 5-8 p.m. Tuesday hours, which will be in
effect until Dec. 15, stemmed from requests by
members of local corporations to make the
museum available for local residents and stu
dents who are not able to visit during the day,
according to Ned Mansfield, chairman of a com
mittee on Tuesday night openings.
If enough people come to the evening hours,
the committee, a volunteer support organization
for the museum, will continue the evening
schedule into winter quarter, Carey said.
"The museum and the Committee for Art are
both institutions connected with the University
and the community," said Jeanne Kennedy, wife
of University President Donald Kennedy and a
member of the Committee for Art since 1960.
"We hope that they each take advantage of —
and give to — each other."
About 100,000 people visit the museum each
year, but only a small number are Stanford stu
dents, according to Carol Osborne, associate
director and curator of the museum.
"We have a very active outreach program to
schools. A large number (of visitors) come from
out of the state and out of the country. And lots
of European visitors and museum professionals
make it a point to visit when they are on the
West Coast. . . . But only a small number of
(Stanford) students have seen the museum,"
Osborne said.
"If we see students coming at night, a half
dozen, dozen or two dozen, that's more than are
coming now," said Carey.
"We've thought that students have not taken
advantage of what we have here," said Gerry
Meyer, Committee for Art educational coordina
tor. "We have lots of student classes visiting

from other schools, but Stanford students seem
a little bit busy for us."
A possible reason for the low attendance of
Stanford students is that most seem to know
little about the museum. "I don't know much
about the museum, and you never hear anything
about it," said junior Alan Branson.
To encourage increased student attendance,
the Committee for Art is considering plans to
target specific academic and living groups this
quarter, including "a dorm night, Row houses
night, business school night and Law School
night," according to Mansfield.
"We would like to do anything to get Stanford
students to come," Osborne said.
The museum, erected in 1891 by Jane Stan
ford as a memorial to her son Leland Stanford,
Jr., houses part of the original collection of

Leland Stanford, Jr. and has roughly 30,000 ob
jects, according to Osborne.
"We have the same types of collections as you
see in Boston and New York and Paris, just not
as many objects," Osborne said.
Among the museum's permanent exhibitions
is the Rodin collection that includes "The Gates
of Hell," and a collection of Bolognese paintings
and drawings.
About 80 Dutch and Flemish prints and
drawings, including engravings by Goltzius and
etchings by Rembrandt, and a collection of color
photographs by Lorie Novak, a 1975 Stanford
graduate, are on temporary display until Decem
ber, according to Osborne.
The Stanford Museum is one of the top three
or four university museums in the country, ac
cording to Mansfield.
