## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial Staff 
In the largest incident of civil disobedience
at Stanford since 1977, 31 students, including
three members of the ASSU Council of Presi
dents, and two community members were ar
rested yesterday for refusing to leave Old
Union when the building closed, bringing to
48 the total number of apartheid protesters
arrested there since Friday.
Before being arrested yesterday, the 33
demonstrators agreed to a statement that
said, "We are protesting the police brutality
toward Robby Perkins and the other people
arrested at Stanford recently, which we see
as a representative action of racist violence
throughout America and the world by secur
ity forces.
"In light of this brutality, similar to the vio
lence in South Africa, we call on the Univer
sity to divest from (companies that do busi
ness in) South Africa. We see its investments
there as another sign of its insensitivity and
racism," the statement continued.
Finally, the statement said: "We are [in Old
Union] only to protest — not to do any vio
lence or damage to Stanford."
On May 9, 1977, 294 people were arrested
at Old Union in a similar protest against Stan
ford's investments in companies that do busi
ness in South Africa.
Twenty-one of those arrested yesterday

were issued citations and immediately
released. The other 12 remained in jail
early this morning either because they
refused cite release or because they refused
to cooperate with the police and were not of
fered citations.
Two COP members — Mike Collins and
Tim Quirk — were among those still being
held last night. The third, Andy Frisch, was
cite released immediately after being ar
rested.
The six men being held at the Santa Clara
County Jail in San Jose were identified by
junior Marvin Jackson as being: graduate stu
dent Rick Motamedi; seniors Collins, Richard
Walter, Ron Nassimov and Tony Tran; and
junior Quirk. Jackson identified himself as a
spokesperson for the imprisoned students.
Six women — seniors Mary Poxen, Lisa
Price, Romney Robinson and Lisa Ruben;
sophomore Edith Pepper; and Barbara Hinz,
a German national vacationing at Stanford —
remained at the Elmwood Women's Reten
tion Facility in Milpitas last night, Jackson
said.
He added that the men would probably be
released at about 3 a.m. today, after inter
views for release on personal recognizance.
The six women would probably be released
at about 6 a.m. on their own recognizance,
according to an Elmwood official.
