## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial Staff 
In the largest incident of civil disobedience
at Stanford since 1977, 31 students, including
three members of the ASSU Council of Presi
dents, and two community members were ar
rested yesterday for refusing to leave Old
Union when the building closed, bringing to
48 the total number of apartheid protesters
arrested there since Friday.
Before being arrested yesterday, the 33
demonstrators agreed to a statement that
said, "We are protesting the police brutality
toward Robby Perkins and the other people
arrested at Stanford recently, which we see
as a representative action of racist violence
throughout America and the world by secur
ity forces.
"In light of this brutality, similar to the vio
lence in South Africa, we call on the Univer
sity to divest from (companies that do busi
ness in) South Africa. We see its investments
there as another sign of its insensitivity and
racism," the statement continued.
Finally, the statement said: "We are [in Old
Union] only to protest — not to do any vio
lence or damage to Stanford."
On May 9, 1977, 294 people were arrested
at Old Union in a similar protest against Stan
ford's investments in companies that do busi
ness in South Africa.
Twenty-one of those arrested yesterday

were issued citations and immediately
released. The other 12 remained in jail
early this morning either because they
refused cite release or because they refused
to cooperate with the police and were not of
fered citations.
Two COP members — Mike Collins and
Tim Quirk — were among those still being
held last night. The third, Andy Frisch, was
cite released immediately after being ar
rested.
The six men being held at the Santa Clara
County Jail in San Jose were identified by
junior Marvin Jackson as being: graduate stu
dent Rick Motamedi; seniors Collins, Richard
Walter, Ron Nassimov and Tony Tran; and
junior Quirk. Jackson identified himself as a
spokesperson for the imprisoned students.
Six women — seniors Mary Poxen, Lisa
Price, Romney Robinson and Lisa Ruben;
sophomore Edith Pepper; and Barbara Hinz,
a German national vacationing at Stanford —
remained at the Elmwood Women's Reten
tion Facility in Milpitas last night, Jackson
said.
He added that the men would probably be
released at about 3 a.m. today, after inter
views for release on personal recognizance.
The six women would probably be released
at about 6 a.m. on their own recognizance,
according to an Elmwood official.

Nov. 18, according to Alice Stauf
fer, a spokesperson for the
protesters.
All of those arrested were
charged with trespassing, unlawful
assembly, refusal to disperse from
an unlawful assembly and remaining
at the scene of a riot after refusal to
disperse.
Those who refused to cooperate
with police were also charged with
resisting arrest. They include Col
lins, Pepper, Price, Quirk, Robin
son and Ruben.
University President Donald
Kennedy has repeatedly stated that
civil disobedience will have no ef
fect in bringing about the Univer
sity's divestment of its South
Africa-related stock.
Earlier yesterday, the protesters
had gathered in the Quad and taken

part in a demonstration sponsored
by the Black Student Union (BSU)
against the alleged police beating of
Robby Perkins, a black who was ar
rested Friday at an Old Union sit-in.
Perkins said that he was beaten by
two policemen while in the North
County Jail in Palo Alto Friday
night. Police have denied the ac
cusation.
The protesters arrived at Old

Union at about 4 p.m. after walking
to the building from the Quad.
About 100 then held an hour-long
teach-in to discuss apartheid and
civil disobedience.
At about 5:10 p.m., Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer intro
duced University Registrar Sally
Mahoney who announced that the
building was closed and asked the
remaining 33 protesters to leave.

When none of them moved,
Niemeyer announced that police
would begin making arrests in a few
minutes.
Motamedi, Quirk and Walter,
who refused to cooperate with
police by walking or standing when
asked to do so, were cuffed at the
wrists and ankles, rolled onto a
canvas sling and carried out of Old
Union to a police vehicle.
