## Boycott the Coffee House 
### 
I used to go to the Coffee House.
It was not then an issue whether I
went inside or stayed away. It was
a pleasant place to procrastinate.
On the nights on which problem
sets were unavoidable, I'd bolster
myself with some caffeine, or
maybe a beer.
At the time I didn't realize that I
was a shareholder, as were all stu
dents. I didn't know that the
woodsy interior where I liked to
hang out had been built by students
just for that purpose.

VIEWPOINT

1 probably didn't care then that
the whole operation was run by a
corporation with a student president
and a student chair of the board of
directors, or that the primary con
cern of those people was to keep
the Coffee House a place that
responded to student needs.
Well, six months and one election
later, I find myself the chair of that
student-owned corporation. And
the warm, fuzzy feeling I once had
about the Coffee House has been
replaced by some cold, hard facts.
Now I know Tresidder receives a
percentage of all Coffee House
sales. Sales are different from
profit, and the Coffee House has
made a good profit for its students
over the past three years. It has
also provided Tresidder with more
than $450,000 in revenue during
the course of its operation. But ad
ministrators need continually in
creasing sales to generate revenue
for their balance sheets.
The fact is, "continually increas
ing sales" just don't happen fast
enough when students are running
the place. Students are more con
cerned with providing a place
where people can study and so
cialize than with a high-turnover,
fast-food restaurant.
Also, I know now that Tresidder
isn't a student union. They call it a
"community union." I know be
cause I read it in a pamphlet called
"Questions and Answers Regarding
Tresidder Union," which was
shoved under every door on

campus. It was written by Nanci
Howe, the assistant director in
charge of food services at Tresid
der. It states that Tresidder's mis
sion is to serve faculty and staff
(who are paid to be here) as well as
students (who pay to be here).
I can't help wondering if those
goals are not dissimilar at times.
Tresidder likes to say its motto is
"students serving students." Well, I
think that's great. Students do
make good waiters and busboys.
But what about "students in real
decision-making positions providing
services for students?" I guess
that's just not as catchy.
And even now I am sadly aware
that the greatest adversary to stu
dent enterprise on this campus is
the Student Affairs Office. I'd al
ways naively assumed that those
people would be the advocates for
student concerns. Any problems
the previous Coffee House organi
zation had could have been worked
out with the advice and support of
the staff and the enthusiastic efforts
of the student owners so that a
unique place on campus could be
preserved. I thought helping stu
dents was their job. I guess actions
speak louder than job titles.
Well, now the jobs of a lot of ad
ministrators are a lot easier. They
can deal with grownups who don't
go away each June, and they're
guaranteed the kind of revenues for
which their bosses will give them
big smiles. The Student Affairs Of
fice has let this happen "in the best
interest" of the students for whom
they are charged to provide
services, even though 3,000 of
those students signed a petition
saying they would rather be pro
vided a student-run coffee house.
But there are still some things I
don't understand. There was a
boycott booth that did quite well
selling food, demonstrating that
students would go out of their way
to patronize a student enterprise.
Right now those students are
looking at a couple of promising
places on campus where they could
give the student-run coffee house a
new home. But Tresidder has

blocked their attempts by claiming
"unfair competition." I don't under
stand how you can fear competition
from the group you are charged to
serve.
Another thing that puzzles me is
the Coffee House Task Force on
student involvement proposed by
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons. This is something I lobbied
desperately for this summer,
before the Sept. 1 contract with
Saga Corp. went into effect.
I was told by Lyons that, gosh, it
was just bad timing because the im
portant thing was that Saga got up
and running. Now the administra
tion is primed to bring the task
force into existence.
But as a "sign of good faith," the
very first objective of the task force
is that any solution arrived at for in
volving students in the Saga Coffee
House "recognize that Saga is the
main food contractor at Tresidder
and operate within the boundaries
of the contract . . . that cannot be
altered." To me, this epitomizes
the commitment Tresidder has
shown toward student services.
These are things you should
know that "Questions and Answers
Regarding Tresidder Union"
doesn't talk about.
You should not be surprised
when you find that the atmosphere
of the Coffee House isn't as cozy as
it used to be or that the quality of
the food just isn't the same, be
cause there is no place for students
in the Saga Coffee House. Sure,
Tresidder talks about the great op
portunities for student management
under Saga. That cannot be as ef
fective or responsive as ownership.
And what happens when your
employer has a different idea of
what constitutes quality and service
to you, the student? Don't patron
ize a bad decision when students
are working right now to make
something better. Don't settle for
anything less than a place to call our
own.
