## Police Should Respect Dignity 
### 
On Friday afternoon, I saw
some students being driven away
from Old Union by the police and
was told that they had taken part in
a pro-divestment sit-in. Friday
night and again on Saturday night I
worked on an essay arguing that
civil disobedience is unjustified as a
means of promoting divestment.
Sunday afternoon I was apprised of
all the events involving the
protesters on Oct. 11. And on
Monday afternoon I was arrested
myself for taking part in a sit-in at
Old Union.
Now I would like to explain why
I took part. 1 think a special expla
nation is needed because I was the
onlv one arrested whose protest

was solely against the police vio
lence of Friday.
The injustice I protested was
great. The excessive use of force
by officials of the state is always
unacceptable, but it is particularly
heinous when it is directed against
a form of peaceful, albeit illegal,
political protest, because such
violence creates an atmosphere of
fear that can stifle even conven
tional, legal demonstrations.
The fear that the officers
keeping order at a lawful demon
stration may be among those who
have abused protesters in the past
may deter all but the most coura
geous citizens. Furthermore, such
violence is clearly politically
motivated. After all, a drunk who
stumbled onto University prop
erty, passed out and had to be
carried off would surely not have

been roughed up like the previous
student protesters.
Of course, an injustice does not,
by itself, justify civil disobedience.
Conventional methods must be
exhausted first — if they'll work.
But conventional methods won't
work in this case. The planned
lawsuits may eventually have their
effect, but not for a long time and
perhaps not before the violence
has had its effect — the squelching
of political protest.
All anyone will remember in the
long run is that excessive force
was used and that it was effective.
The state and its officials must be
shown that excessive force en
courages, rather than discourages,
protest. Consequently, I feel that a
minor violation of the social con
tract was justified in order to
protest a major violation of it.

Let me make two last points.
First, I do not have anything
against police in general. They
have a difficult and often thankless
job, and civilization would be
impossible without them. All I ask
is that they perform their job with
professionalism appropriate to the
dignity of their occupation and the
sanctity of the public trust with
which they have been endowed.
Finally, I want to thank the
many people who have given sup
port to my friends and me, espe
cially those who waited and
watched outside Old Union to see
that we were treated properly and
those who went to San Jose and to
provide moral and logistical sup
port. We all appreciate your com
mitment.
