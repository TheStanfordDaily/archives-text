# Students Must Support Union
## 
### 
In the past nine months, this campus has seen stu
dents, faculty and staff do battle with the Stanford ad
ministration on a variety of issues ranging from the
controversy at the Hoover Institution to the call for di
vestment.
Given this upsurge and United Stanford Workers'
current battle for a fair contract, students concerned
with making the administration accountable to the
Stanford community must look at those strategies that
have been successful in increasing campus democracy.
The establishment of a progressive political trend on
this campus is the best way for all sectors of this
campus to be more successful. The joining of students
and labor has been and will be an important force in
building this trend.

The alliance of students and workers has been a
powerful force in progressive battles on campus for
many years. In the early 19705, students and labor
teamed up to shut down a major campus computer cen
ter in protest of its involvement in Vietnam War plan
ning.
USW also displayed its support for a student-run
Coffee House by actually joining students on the picket
line, a tactic that was instrumental in gaining student
control of the restaurant some four years ago. Now the
union is coming out strongly against Saga's contract to
run the Coffee House. The union also voted to support
the Black Student Union's (BSU) call for total divest
ment and has played an active role in the anti-apartheid
movement on campus.
Students and the Stanford community have, in
return, demonstrated their support of USW. Specifi
cally, in the past year, the Stanford community has
shown strong support for USW in its battle with the
University for recognition.
Students, faculty and staff pressured the University
to stop its union-busting tactics and showed the
workers that the community understands the issue.
Most recently, students have shown their support as
the union has struggled to secure a contract that would
preserve its right to represent workers and would stop
the University from contracting out whole sections of
bargaining unit work to outside contractors.
While it is clear that this alliance, which represents a
larger alliance of the whole Stanford community,
makes both sectors of the community more powerful,
there are important political reasons for students to
actively support the union.

Whether it is Stanford Out of South Africa's
demand for total divestment or the BSU and other
minority organizations' demands for more resources
and greater input into the curriculum, it is clear that the
target of pressure, the Stanford administration, is the
same entity that has consistently shown contempt for
workers and their right to union representation.
Just as we must force this university to support
democracy and black majority rule in South Africa, we
must realize that the current union struggle is based on
the same principles. The University must respect and
defend the democratic rights of workers to organize
and represent themselves.
As students, we have the luxury of time to study and
analyze society. We have the responsibility to use this
time to examine conditions in the world, in this society
and on this campus and do something about them. We
must then take the logical step and look at this univer
sity, the most immediate place in which students can
actually "make a difference." We can and must make a
difference for all of the community, and workers are a
part. The workers on this campus are a vital part of
this university. They make it possible for students to
study, professors to teach and for researchers to do
their work.
These are real people whose jobs affect not only
themselves but the lives of their families.
Now is the time to make our concern known. This is
a critical point in the negotiations between the union
and the University administration. The University is
trying to gauge the strength of the workers to see how
much it can force them to take. The strength of the
recent strike vote should send a signal to the adminis
tration that it is in its best interest to negotiate a fair
contract.
Just as the University is measuring the strength of
the bargaining unit, it is also looking to see what the re
action of the community will be to its hard line ap
proach. They are counting on students to look at the
issue and ask, "How will it effect me?" We must show
the administration that students see beyond the possi
ble short-term inconvenience, and that we understand
that, if workers are forced to strike, it will be because
they cannot accept a contract that gives them no job
security.
As students, we must educate ourselves on the
issue, so that those who don't feel they know enough
can take a stand, and those who do can inform others.
We cannot count on an administration that refuses even
to participate in a public forum on the issue. If the
workers are forced out on strike, the University may
very well try to break the union if it feels that it can get
away with it.
The future well-being of a part of our community is
in danger. We must act. We have done it before, and
we must do it again.

study, professors to teach and for researchers to do
their work.
These are real people whose jobs affect not only
themselves but the lives of their families.
Now is the time to make our concern known. This is
a critical point in the negotiations between the union
and the University administration. The University is
trying to gauge the strength of the workers to see how
much it can force them to take. The strength of the
recent strike vote should send a signal to the adminis
tration that it is in its best interest to negotiate a fair
contract.
Just as the University is measuring the strength of
the bargaining unit, it is also looking to see what the re
action of the community will be to its hard line ap
proach. They are counting on students to look at the
issue and ask, "How will it effect me?" We must show
the administration that students see beyond the possi
ble short-term inconvenience, and that we understand
that, if workers are forced to strike, it will be because
they cannot accept a contract that gives them no job
security.
As students, we must educate ourselves on the
issue, so that those who don't feel they know enough
can take a stand, and those who do can inform others.
We cannot count on an administration that refuses even
to participate in a public forum on the issue. If the
workers are forced out on strike, the University may
very well try to break the union if it feels that it can get
away with it.
The future well-being of a part of our community is
in danger. We must act. We have done it before, and
we must do it again.

In the past nine months, this campus has seen stu
dents, faculty and staff do battle with the Stanford ad
ministration on a variety of issues ranging from the
controversy at the Hoover Institution to the call for di
vestment.
Given this upsurge and United Stanford Workers'
current battle for a fair contract, students concerned
with making the administration accountable to the
Stanford community must look at those strategies that
have been successful in increasing campus democracy.
The establishment of a progressive political trend on
this campus is the best way for all sectors of this
campus to be more successful. The joining of students
and labor has been and will be an important force in
building this trend.

The alliance of students and workers has been a
powerful force in progressive battles on campus for
many years. In the early 19705, students and labor
teamed up to shut down a major campus computer cen
ter in protest of its involvement in Vietnam War plan
ning.
USW also displayed its support for a student-run
Coffee House by actually joining students on the picket
line, a tactic that was instrumental in gaining student
control of the restaurant some four years ago. Now the
union is coming out strongly against Saga's contract to
run the Coffee House. The union also voted to support
the Black Student Union's (BSU) call for total divest
ment and has played an active role in the anti-apartheid
movement on campus.
Students and the Stanford community have, in
return, demonstrated their support of USW. Specifi
cally, in the past year, the Stanford community has
shown strong support for USW in its battle with the
University for recognition.
Students, faculty and staff pressured the University
to stop its union-busting tactics and showed the
workers that the community understands the issue.
Most recently, students have shown their support as
the union has struggled to secure a contract that would
preserve its right to represent workers and would stop
the University from contracting out whole sections of
bargaining unit work to outside contractors.
While it is clear that this alliance, which represents a
larger alliance of the whole Stanford community,
makes both sectors of the community more powerful,
there are important political reasons for students to
actively support the union.

Whether it is Stanford Out of South Africa's
demand for total divestment or the BSU and other
minority organizations' demands for more resources
and greater input into the curriculum, it is clear that the
target of pressure, the Stanford administration, is the
same entity that has consistently shown contempt for
workers and their right to union representation.
Just as we must force this university to support
democracy and black majority rule in South Africa, we
must realize that the current union struggle is based on
the same principles. The University must respect and
defend the democratic rights of workers to organize
and represent themselves.
As students, we have the luxury of time to study and
analyze society. We have the responsibility to use this
time to examine conditions in the world, in this society
and on this campus and do something about them. We
must then take the logical step and look at this univer
sity, the most immediate place in which students can
actually "make a difference." We can and must make a
difference for all of the community, and workers are a
part. The workers on this campus are a vital part of
this university. They make it possible for students to
study, professors to teach and for researchers to do
their work.
These are real people whose jobs affect not only
themselves but the lives of their families.
Now is the time to make our concern known. This is
a critical point in the negotiations between the union
