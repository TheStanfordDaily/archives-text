## Stanford Polo Rides High on Living 'Machines' 
### LAIE CAINDEC 
The excitement and thrill of
charging at 30 mph on a living
"machine" made up of no less than
1,500 pounds of muscle, is the
drug.
"Once you're hooked, you can't
stop," is the simple conviction of

Feisal Khan, a junior from Pakistan
and one of 22 Stanford students
who are a part of the Stanford Polo
Club.
Polo, considered to be the
second most dangerous sport in the
country, remains relatively un
known to students here.
Team member Igor Aguirre Ar
riz , a sophomore, said of people

who hear he plays polo, "Half the
time they think I'm crazy, and half
the time they wonder how such a
guy can be in a swimming pool, be
cause they don't realize (horse)
polo exists here."
Although the Stanford team is
still fairly young, it took only three
years for the team, under the su
pervision of Coach Robert Genis
man, to earn the Pacific Coast title.
The team has also been sent to the
NCAA Championships over the
past three years, Genisman said.
The object of the sport, which is
somewhat similar to soccer, is to
hit a ball between two posts. The
difference with soccer is that polo is
much faster and is played with only
four players per team.
Depending upon whether or not
the game is played indoors or out
doors, play periods are divided up
into four, six or eight "chukkers,"
each lasting seven-and-one-half
minutes. The game is played on
fields that measure 200 by 300
yards, and horses run at speeds as
high as 25 to 30 mph, with each
player trying to push his opponent
away from the ball by using great

speed and moving in at sharp
angles.
The sport, however, is not all
fame and glory. It's a lot of hard
work.
Unlike other sports, where the
routine is to practice for three
hours daily, and then compete in
games lasting up to two hours, a
polo game usually lasts only 30
minutes to one hour, and the
amount of time that one puts into
the sport per week can be over
whelming.
Stanford polo players estimate
that for every hour spent on the
field (whether in practice or in com
petition), a player can spend up to
10 hours in making necessary
preparations.
In this sport, one has to account
for the welfare of the horses, who
are athletes, too.
The horses need to be tended in
ways that are easily taken for
granted when one is not exposed to
riding. A great deal of cost and time
is incurred when caring for horses.
"This is undoubtedly the most
expensive sport on campus,"
Genisman said.
"We are not a club that can write

off checks for all the problems we
have," he said.
Fortunately, the Webb Ranch
allows the polo team to practice and
compete on a field large enough to
play games on, and the Piers Ranch
leases its stables for the eight
horses the Stanford Polo Club
owns. Both ranches are located in
Palo Alto.
Even so, the costs of the sport

build up. The horses need to be
fed, exercised and treated if
injured. Above all in polo, the
horses need to be trained to
become professional athletes, the
team said.
It is estimated by some of the
polo players that the level of ability
of the horse determines up to 70
