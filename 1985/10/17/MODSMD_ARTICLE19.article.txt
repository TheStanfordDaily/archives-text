'Fritz the Cat'
We told you a few weeks ago that
the folks at the University of In
diana had banned X-rated movies.
But now there's more.
It seems there's an exception
being made for "Fritz the Cat," the
naughty cartoon classic that
chronicles the sexual exploits of a
certain city cat.
"Anyone who shows a porno
graphic film is risking prosecution,"
the university said.
"The rating system itself doesn't
denote the moral quality of the
film," the "Fritz" sponsors shot
back.
The sponsors of the film, the
directors of the High Tech Film Se
ries, say they don't expect they'll
be prosecuted under Indiana's new,
tough anti-porn laws because they
don't consider "Fritz" to be
obscene.
So there it is.
Smell That Smell
"It's the worst between meals.
It's a bad smell, I can't describe it. I
just eat and leave."
That's the word from a Harvard
junior on the latest major problem

to confront that small eastern col
lege.
It seems that a drain pipe under
the Adams House dining hall broke,
sending forth odors that have
everyone turning a very un-crimson
green.
"This is how dedicated we are,"
said one Adams House cook. "We
work through the hurricane, and we
work through this."
The sewage smell has seeped
through the kitchen and throughout
the house, but maintenance
workers, like a certain former
movie actor, say, "We're doing all
we can."
Out in the Badlands
Picture this. You're all set to live
in a luxurious new campus
residence, and then you arrive at
school, and the place isn't built yet.
What would you do? What would
you do?
For the 74 would-be residents of
Princeton's Edwards Hall, the an
swer isn't so easy.
The university has done its best
to accommodate the students until
their new home can be finished.
But, say some students, the best

isn't good enough.
Some of the students are living in
kitchens of other campus
residences. One hapless woman
has been assigned to live in the
living room of another dorm.
Three more weeks was the last
best guess on when the would-be
Edwardians might be allowed to
move to their new homes.
Until then, they're making do —
but they're not liking it.
"I'll never give the university a
cent because they might build
something with it," grumbled one
"displaced Edwardian."
Couzens Crackdown
A crackdown at the University
of Michigan has quieted the usually
rowdy Couzens Hall, according to
The Michigan Daily.
Couzens residents, infamous for
the Technicolor yawn before the
porcelain god, are cooling their
heels a bit after the university an
nounced bans on keg parties and
the institution of "quiet hours."
Although some students now call
the resident director "the warden
of this prison," most say the place

is quieter — and a little drier —
than ever before.
When You're Undefeated . . .
Would you bet your hometown on
the Cardinal in this weekend's USC
game?
If you answered no, it's probably
just as well that you don't live in
Toledo.
The resolution to a 150-year-old
dispute over who — the city of
Toledo, Ohio, or the state of Michi
gan — owns a small parcel of land
could all ride on the outcome of the
Nov. 23 Michigan-Ohio State game.
Tired of arguing over the land
rights question, which stemmed
from the 1835 Toledo War over
state boundaries, the Toledo City
Council has approved a resolution
that will give the parcel to Michigan
if the Wolverines triumph, and to
Toledo if the Buckeyes win.
Michigan Gov. James Blanchard
— a Michigan State alumnus — has
refused to comment on the deal,
but a source close to the governor
said he "probably wouldn't get
caught up in the rivalry."

When You're Undefeated . . .
Would you bet your hometown on
the Cardinal in this weekend's USC
game?
If you answered no, it's probably
just as well that you don't live in
Toledo.
The resolution to a 150-year-old
dispute over who — the city of
Toledo, Ohio, or the state of Michi
gan — owns a small parcel of land
could all ride on the outcome of the
Nov. 23 Michigan-Ohio State game.
Tired of arguing over the land
rights question, which stemmed
from the 1835 Toledo War over
state boundaries, the Toledo City
Council has approved a resolution
that will give the parcel to Michigan
if the Wolverines triumph, and to
Toledo if the Buckeyes win.
Michigan Gov. James Blanchard
— a Michigan State alumnus — has
refused to comment on the deal,
but a source close to the governor
said he "probably wouldn't get
caught up in the rivalry."
