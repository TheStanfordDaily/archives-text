An anonymous donor has
pledged $500,000 for Stanford's
public service summer fellow
ship program, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy announced
yesterday.
The program, which awards
fellowships of up to $1,200 to
enable students to work on sum
mer internships in public ser
vice, was started two years ago
by Catherine Milton, director of
the University's Public Service
Center.
Kennedy also announced
Stanford's participation in a new
public service project involving
more than 70 colleges across the
country. Kennedy has been
working with the president of
Brown University and others to
set up the new Project for Public
and Community Service (PPCS)
and will serve as co-chair. The
project is being established to
centralize and increase access to
community service information,
heighten awareness of public
service and reduce disincentives
for students to do public service
work.
The program is based in

Rhode Island and administered
by the Education Commission of
the States. Stanford graduate
Melissa Auchard, a member of
last year's ASSU Council of
Presidents, will help head the
project.
National surveys have shown
that the proportion of entering
college freshmen who hope edu
cation will help them become
"very well off financially" has
risen from 40 to 70 percent
during the past 10 years, while
values such as helping others,
promoting interracial under
standing, cleaning up the envi
ronment and participating in
community action programs
have shown the greatest
declines.
Besides working to set up the
PPCS, Kennedy's office has
helped to reorganize the Public
Service Center at Owen House
this year. The building now
houses all public service
oriented student groups, re
search and internship projects
under one roof.
The center offers a volunteer
clearinghouse, an internship pro
gram, summer and postgraduate
fellowships and an annual public
service conference.
