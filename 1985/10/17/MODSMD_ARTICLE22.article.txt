# SF Opera's 'Werther' Weaves Tale of Desire
## 
### NANCY HENRY Editorial staff 
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe summarized the plot of
his romantic novel, "The Sorrows of Young Werther,"
as the story of a young man, "gifted with deep, pure
sentiment and penetrating intelligence, who loses him
self in fantastic dreams and undermines himself with
speculative thought until finally, torn by hopeless pas
sions, especially by infinite love, he shoots himself in
the head."
Such is the stuff of which tragedy is made, and in the
San Francisco Opera's production of Jules Massenet's
"Werther," this elemental and melodramatic romance
is enriched by the simple beauty of the musical score
and several outstanding vocal performances.
The advantage of seeing this classic story, by the
poet who may be Germany's most influential on the
operatic stage, is that one need not have a deep ap
preciation of the romantic style to appreciate the per
formance. Indeed, it may be difficult for the modern au
dience to identify with the emotions of the tormented
Werther, so extreme are the depth of his feelings and
the power of his reactions. But after the obstacle of a
disappointingly slow and unremarkable first act, the
story begins to draw you into an acceptance of plot,
character and style.
With his powerful tenor voice and gestures, Alfredo
KraUs, as a rather old young Werther, creates a char
acter of appropriately exaggerated proportions. His
performance reaches its peak in the second act when,
rejected by Charlotte (the object of all his concentrated
desires), he contemplates suicide with impressive
romantic flare.
.'Charlotte, the young woman torn between obliga
tipns including a promise made to her dying mother and
her engagement to another man, is adeptly played by
renowned Metropolitan Opera star Renata Scotto. Her
clear and smoothly plaintive voice expresses all the
conflict Charlotte feels between pure illogical passion
and the rational, social constructions that suppress that
passion.

Scotto shines when accompanied by Kraus, but in
the final act, when the pistol has been pulled and the
cause for her torment and ecstasy has departed for an
other world, the show is all hers; it is a fine show she
makes of it.
The story really is as simple as Goethe made it
sound, as is the central dichotomy between the forces
of nature and the structures created and applied by
man. An ominously lit and violent sky characterizes
each of the three main set designs, and a snow storm
blows throughout the final death scene. This sky pro
vides an effective backdrop for the declarations and
confessions of the young Werther, who first appears
silhouetted against its fury.
Such structures of human creation are contrasted
with those of nature. Whether it is Charlotte's modest
home or the imposing church of the second scene that
serves as her retreat, nature and civilization are at
odds in all aspects of this work.
It is only with the death, and presumably the defeat,
of Werther (supreme champion of passion), that Char
lotte can release the flood of emotions seething within
her. Relieved of the responsibility of physical adultery,
Scotto, as Charlotte, expresses sorrow, anger,
remorse, but most importantly the spirit of love she
found in Werther.
The story is Goethe's, but that is barely half the
composition of opera. The voice performances seemed
only to build in volume and in energy. At first the the'
performer's words seemed lost in the vastness of the
War Memorial Opera House. By the second act,
however, the stars found their range; this continued
into the third act, and the clarity and volume increased
proportionally with the intensity of the action, thus ac
hieving the operatic ideal of harmony between voice,
music and drama.
This is not a remarkable musical score. In fact, Mas
senet has often been dismissed as a superficial com
poser who cared only for the popular musical trends of
his day. "Werther" is perhaps his most enduring work,
and the San Francisco Opera has made a respectable
attempt to milk the most from an unspectacular opera.


Renata Scotto sparkles as the passionate and tortured Charlotte in San Francisco Opera's pro
duction of "Werther." Performances run through Oct. 25. at War Memorial Opera House.
