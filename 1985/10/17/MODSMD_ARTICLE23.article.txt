shrouds the discovery of a stran

Canada. Who knew of the preg

the . ..
Sister Agnes (played by Meg
Tilly) is the mother of the child, but
claims to remember nothing. The
search for answers results in an in
triguing and potentially provocative
drama about the power of truth.
In response to the sensitivity of
the situation, the court sends Dr.

Livingston Qane Fonda) to the con
vent to evaluate the mental health
of the mother and presumed mur
derer. She is met there by the
devout though not unworldly
Mother Ruth (Anne Bancroft) who,
from the beginning, is cynical and
uncooperative toward Dr.
Livingston and the science she
represents. Dr. Livingston is
equally prejudiced in the confronta
tion, her sister having died of ap
pendicitis in a convent while nuns
willingly kept her from medical at
tention.
The ensuing debate about what
really happened comes to form in
the stark terms of secular vs. religi

ous, science vs. faith. The most
fascinating aspect of this movie is
that the debate revolves not solely
around resolution of the mystery,
but around the character of Agnes
(Meg Tilly), whose fate as the
"touched" young novice depends on
the determination of the"truth" of
the matter, a truth which she
should be able to provide.
With its mechanically sound plot,
"Agnes of God" holds its audience
to the end (and after) in pursuit of
various truths. The success of the
plot is a common attribute of
movies that are play adaptations,
"Agnes of God" being an adaptation
from the Tony Award-winning play
of the same name. Adaptation al
ways involves overcoming poten
tially devastating traps, but usually
ensures narrative flow and
worthwhile drama. "Kiss of the
Spider Woman" is another example
of the advantages of adaptation.
The film's cinematography is also
remarkable. The shots themselves
are somewhat repetitive and often
uninteresting in meaning and com
position, but the renowned Sven
Nykvist, whose work with the
theatrical Ingmar Bergman makes
him the perfect candidate for con
veying the sense of the convent,
works wonders with the earthy
tones of the Canadian countryside
and the convent's harsh interiors.
In all of its technical aspects,
"Agnes of God" is a good, sound
movie — intriguing as well as vis

ually interesting. However, the
movie fails in formulating the ques
tions its producers propose to in
vestigate: those surrounding the
conflict between faith and reason.
Because the producers are not fully
conscious of the level at which the
real battles are being fought,
"Agnes of God" falls short of what it
could be.
For the conflict between faith and
reason is only a specific formulation
of the problem of truth. "Agnes of
God" wonderfully illustrates the
fact that the specific language of a
conflict, here the discourses on sci
ence and religion, is never as im
portant as the battle for the criteria
used in determining the truth.
Indeed, the battle is not being
fought on behalf of truth (as if dis
covering the real truth is the only
goal), but is fought with respect to
the status of truth and the role it
plays in relation to social institu
tions, to others and to oneself.
Although "Agnes of God" is a
rich resource for such a considera
tion, the actual process*of the
movie rather urges the audience to
think: Well, what really did happen?
This is a useless question since
nothing really happens in a movie.
Instead, we should leave the
theater struck by the way dis
courses that lay claim to truth act
themselves out — not in an imagi
nary situation but in real terms. We
can't create truth in the movies, but
we can come close to illustrating its

social functions. Where is Agnes
amid all of this ideological debate?
The future of Agnes is often over
shadowed by the battle for posses
sion of truth.
In the play version, Agnes ends
up absolved of legal guilt and placed
in a mental institution. There, we
learn, she stops her beautiful sing
ing, becomes depressed and even
tually dies. Depression rarely sells
movie tickets, hence on film Agnes
meets a happier fate.
But the play's ending is so much
more appropriate, even necessary.
It illustrates how both faith and rea
son lose: Reason fails to

"rehabilitate" Agnes and God aban
dons her. With such an ending,
"what really happened" becomes an
entirely different question.
Anne Bancroft has said of her
movie: "After seeing 'Agnes of
God' I would like people who
believe in God to think again and
people who don't believe in God to
think again." I would add that "to
think again" should involve more
than a simple re-evaluation of your
position (its truth value), but rather
should produce an awareness of
how "what is true" translates into
the exercise of power at every level
of our activity.
