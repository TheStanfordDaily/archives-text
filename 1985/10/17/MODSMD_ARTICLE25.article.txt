# Stevie Ray Vaughan Fuses Hot Jazz and Smooth Blues
## 
### JAMISON SMELTZ 
The Greek Theater was host to almost two hours of
the most fluid, blues-inspired music this side of the
Mississippi Friday night, with Stevie Ray Vaughan's
magic doing the honors.
Opening the show was Lonnie Mack, a traditional
blues guitarist whose physical appearance and set-up of
guitar, bass, drums and keyboards was too similar to
the main act for comfort. At a distance, you couldn't be
certain of the true identity of the performer — his hat
said Stevie Ray, but his playing said no way.
Mack played a half-hour set of uninspired blues that
left the audience, well, uninspired. His group seemed
like a bar band playing to a concert crowd, which was
disconcerting considering the reputation of the head
liner.
During intermission, Los Lobos' "How Will the Wolf
Survive?" was broadcast from the speakers, an excel
lent choice in any concert setting. Thompson Twins
would probably have been inappropriate for this audi
ence. The atmosphere up on the grass was sexist but
friendly, with large men in cowbay hats making loud
references to attractive women as clouds of the sweet
smell of Northern California drifted skyward. After a
half hour, the house lights dimmed and four southern
dressed gentlemen entered stage right.
Decked out in a sharp gray suit, Stevie Ray Vaughan
took the stage with authority. Backed by his band
Double Trouble, which now includes Reese Wynans on
keyboards in addition to bassist Tommy Shannon and
drummer Chris "Whipper" Layton, Vaughan is on tour
promoting his latest Epic release, "Soul to Soul." The
ensemble from Austin, Texas, is made up of talented
professionals who know when to shine and when to
simmer, letting their front man do the talkin.'
Vaughan's style encompassed a traditional blues
melting pot, with a heavy emphasis on soul and
snitches of jazz, fusion and metal thrown in for spice. A
marked Hendrix influence was obvious in his playing,
from his behind-the-back picking to his sustained war
ping solos that left the audience awestruck. His version
of Hendrix' "Voodoo Chile" would have done Jimi
proud; it seems, indeed, that the legacy has passed on.
A show at the Greek Theater in Berkeley is always
an experience. Not only do you get a memorable even
ing under the stars, but, if you arrive early enough, you
get to sit on some of the most uncomfortable amphi
theater steps within driving distance.
If any doubts were left in anyone's mind about
Vaughan's validity as a guitar force to be reckoned with
in the '80s, an announcement was made prior to the
encore that, for the third year in a row, Vaughan was
voted Guitar Player of the Year by Guitar Player maga
zine.
Returning after this announcement amidst a standing
ovation, Vaughan sat on the lip of the stage and played
solo for a good 10 minutes. - Looking down in disbelief
upon the man with no face (for it was obscured by the

brim of his hat), you couldn't help but smile and shake
your head.
For onstage, beyond the inhumane concrete seats
and the unapproachable reserved section, sat the
musician of the '80s in the guise of a blues guitarist
from Texas — Stevie Ray Vaughan.
