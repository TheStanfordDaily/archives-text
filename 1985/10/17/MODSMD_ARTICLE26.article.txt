Jane Wiedlin — "Jane
Wiedlin"
ifiri
Jane Wiedlin shouldn't write her
own songs. Know why? Yep, it's
because she's not very good at it
yet. In the music world, this phe
nomenon is referred to as the
"premature solo project."
This particular PSP makes the
listener yearn for the Go Go's
days when better songs were
made and played. Wiedlin's
Tinkerbell cheeriness and teddy
bear voice don't jibe with her way
oversimplified, idealistic lyrics.
Songs like "Blue Kiss" are so un
believably contrived-to-be-cute
that it's hard to understand how
they could have been written in
the first place.
The most redeeming songs on
the record are those that Wiedlin
had the least to do with — the
few written by other people are
faster, catchier and consistently
better. Wiedlin's songs have
fewer instruments, less music
and less sophistication by com
parison. There's potential in
them, though — two or three al
bums hence should bring us some
real music.
Stevie Wonder — "In Square
Circle"
★ ★★★
How do two insignificant Stan
ford undergraduates write a
Stevie Wonder review that is any
thing less than worshipful without
feeling blasphemous?
Stevie's gotta be next in line to
inherit the Jack
son/Prince/Springsteen media

blitz this year, and he probably
deserves it more than any of
them. (Except maybe
Springsteen.) After at least seven
critically acclaimed albums in a
row, he has still refused to sell
out. His songs remain excellent,
although diluted by his growing
affinity for a commercial, stan
dardized sound. Melodies and ar
rangements are still ingenious and
frequently can carry an entire
track on their merits alone.
Lyrics are still dedicated to im
portant issues, and "It's Wrong
(Apartheid)" continues Stevie's
activism and concern for human
equality.
However, the best harmonica
in the universe is missing from all
tracks but one, and the predict
able, commercial nature of the
songs is just too limiting for Mr.
Wonder's talents. It's a fine al
bum, mixing talent and technol
ogy as well as anyone can. A
quick listen to classics like "Songs
in the Key of Life" or
"Innervisions" makes it clear that
"In Square Circle" isn't quite a

masterpiece. But why quibble
with greatness anyway?
Midnight Oil — "Red Sails in
the Sunset"
This is the album for those who
worried that Australian music
sounds like Men at Work. "Red
Sails in the Sunset," the newest
album from Midnight Oil, screams
with power, yet is slicker than
their previous albums. All songs
are politically loaded (i.e., read
the lyrics). The Oils — always
known for their strong labor and
anti-nuclear stances — have held
true to their beliefs.
"Harrisburg" talks of the
British nuclear tests in Australia,
and "Who Can Stand in the Way"
is a scorching denunciation of the
dollars-before-people mentality.
Perhaps the most positive track is
"Best of Both Worlds," a song of
what Australia could be.

Work and Greg Joffe
