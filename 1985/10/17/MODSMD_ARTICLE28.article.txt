# Imbo's World
## Card's best is different indeed 
### BRENDAN HEALEY 
David Imbernino is driven by the fires burning within him.
One of these fires has helped make the Stanford junior one of the
top collegiate water polo players in the nation. But Imbernino is also
driven by something more important to him — his religion.
"I am a Christian," Imbernino said. "It's the most important thing
in my life. Glory is brought to Jesus Christ through my water polo.
My main goal is to help others find love in Jesus Christ. That's a lot of
motivation for me in water polo — God."
Imbernino became a Christian during his junior year at Corona Del
Mar High School n Newport Beach.
"My sister is a Christian," Imbernino, a political science major
said. "I saw how God was working in her life. I used to make fun of
her, but I couldn't deny that God was making a difference in her life.
That got me started reading the Bible and seeing what it was all
about."
For Imbernino the task of combining his religious beliefs with the
highly physical sport of water polo is sometimes difficult.
"There are some players in water polo today that go out and try
and give you cheap shots and try and hurt you," Imbernino said. "I
try not to do that, because if I'm playing the sport to go out and try
and hurt people, then I should quit.
"I think the game of water polo can be played aggressively and in
tensively without fighting. There are times when people hit me, and
I try to burn them, beat them on a drive and score on them.
Sometimes I'll get in a fight — I'm human."
Imbernino's play from his starting driver position is characterized
by its intensity.
"He's a Christian guy," water polo Coach Dante Dettamanti said.
"But he doesn't fit the stereotype. He's not afraid to go in there and
mix it up. He's really aggressive on offense. Sometimes I have to tell
him to take it easy.
"The other teams are constantly double-teaming him. A lot of
teams have tried to stop him one-on-one, and they can't do it," Det
tamanti added.
"He's very intense in practice," junior teammate Craig Klass said.
"It shows a lot in the way he plays."
"He's a real intense player," junior teammate Chris Thompson
said. "He has an amazing type of drive. He's real hard to guard. It's
sort of like guarding a bowl of jello. He's real flexible."
Imbernino was not always so hard to defense, as he didn't know
how to swim when he began to play the game as a high school fresh
man.
"I started playing my freshman year in high school, because some
of my friends went out for the team," Imbernino said. "My first two
years I wasn't very successful, because I was learning to swim. My
stroke still suffers today for it."
"He looks like he's kind of crawling over the water," Dettamanti
said of his prize junior. "Yet he guts it out and gets up and down the
pool."
Imbernino began to come into his own during his junior year of
high school, as he broke into the starting lineup. During his senior
season he exploded onto the national scene when he was named the
California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Player of the Year.
"He was one of the top high school players in the United States,"
Dettamanti said. "Being named the CIF Player of the Year is quite an
honor."
What followed was perhaps Det
tamanti's easiest recruiting job
ever, although many thought Im
bernino was headed to UC-Irvine.
"I knew if I got into Stanford I'd
go," Imbernino said. "The summer
before my senior year, I played
with the UCI program. The UCI
Coach [Ed Newlandl expected me
to go to his school, and there's still
a little animosity when we play."
Imbernino was thrown into the
fire as a Stanford freshman. He and
four other freshmen were called on
to start for a team depleted by two
consecutive years of heavy losses
to graduation. The inexperienced
Stanford water polo team struggled
to a 11-13-3 record, only its second
losing season in history, and
missed the NCAA Tournament for
the first time in Dettamanti's
seven-year tenure.
"You could see the talent was
there," Dettamanti said. "It was
really a young team. Imbo immedi
ately became our leader."
"I was pleased that I scored
some goals," Imbernino said of a
freshman year that saw him lead

the team with 40 goals. "But our
team didn't do so well. That kind of
put a damper on the goals. The pur
pose is for the team to win .
"I did realize during my freshman
year that I could play on the col
legiate level. We just needed a little
experience, " he added.
The potential everyone saw in
the Cardinal finally became plainly
visible the next year, as Stanford
racked up 25 wins against only five
losses and finished second in the
country. Imbernino became the
only non-senior named a first-team
All-American and once again led
Stanford in scoring with 63 goals.
"It was great, because we came
back with almost the same squad
and placed second in the country,"
Imbernino said of his sophomore
season. "We started playing to
gether as a team, and we beat
teams that were probably more
talented than us."
Being tabbed for the United
States Senior National team was
another highlight of Imbernino's
sophomore year. He was the only
sophomore and the youngest player
picked for the team, "which serves
as a training squad from which the
U.S. Olympic team is selected.
"Possibly not for the 1988 team,

but for sure for the 1992 team,"
Dettamanti said of Imbernino's
Olympic aspirations. "In 1988 he'll
be 22 or 23 years old. Most guys
don't hit their peaks in international
polo until between 25 and 28 years
old."
Going on tour with the national
team has been the main benefit so
far for Imbernino, who loves to
travel.
"It was a good experience
playing with the best players in the
world," he said. "I think it will help
me a lot for this season."
Does Imbernino feel the Olym
pics are in his future?
"I would like to play in the 1988
Olympics," he said. "In order for
me to make the team, I'll have to
improve tremendously. (But) my
main water polo goal right now is to
win an NCAA Championship."
This year the Cardinal is a
legitimate contender for the na
tional title, but recently has had to
shake off a midseason slump of
three straight losses in one-goal
games before it beat a strong
UCLA team 9-5.
"We had three losses in a row.
. . . What can I say?" Imbernino
asked. "That made us realize that
it's going to be a tough season."

Imbernino, who broke a mild
scoring slump of his own with four
goals against UCLA — to give him
27 for the season, has not been
pleased with his play so far.
"I know that I haven't been going
into each game — especially the
three in a row that we lost — with
that same killer instinct," Imber
nino said.
"He's probably one of our hard
est workers in practice," Detta
manti said. "The thing is, against
opponents that we can beat easily
he doesn't score many goals. He
doesn't pad his scoring against
weaker teams."
Imbernino also helps keep the
team loose out of the pool with his
sense of humor. While down at the
UCI water polo tournament earlier
in the season, he goaded the team
into seeing "Pee Wee's Big Ad
venture, " a movie he has seen four
times.
"He's a really interesting guy,"
Klass said. "He's kind of hard to
describe. We went to that movie on
his recommendation."
"If I had seen that movie with
anyone else," Thompson said, "I
probably would have hated it, but
with him you go along with the
jokes, because he laughs at them."
"He has kind of a weird sense of
humor," Dettamanti said. "He can
take almost anything I say and
make a pun. That's typical of Imbo
to find a movie that adults don't like
and get the whole team to like it.
"He's not your run-of-the-mill
guy. He and all the guys from New
port refuse to get their hair cut
anywhere but in Newport."
Imbernino, however, refuted this
claim.
"I finally found some Northern
California barbers that will give me
a good flattop," he said. "My first
year I would only get it cut at home,
because I didn't trust the barbers
up here."
It is in the pool, though, that Im
bernino's full importance to the
team is realized.
"When it's an important game,"
Dettamanti said, "and the game is
on the line, and we need goals,
Imbo's going to score them for us."
David Imbernino is driven by the fires burning within him.
One of these fires has helped make the Stanford junior one of the

consecutive years of heavy losses
to graduation. The inexperienced
Stanford water polo team struggled
to a 11-13-3 record, only its second
losing season in history, and
missed the NCAA Tournament for
the first time in Dettamanti's
seven-year tenure.
"You could see the talent was
there," Dettamanti said. "It was
really a young team. Imbo immedi
ately became our leader."
"I was pleased that I scored
some goals," Imbernino said of a
freshman year that saw him lead

the team with 40 goals. "But our
team didn't do so well. That kind of
put a damper on the goals. The pur
pose is for the team to win .
"I did realize during my freshman
year that I could play on the col
legiate level. We just needed a little
experience, " he added.
The potential everyone saw in
the Cardinal finally became plainly
visible the next year, as Stanford
racked up 25 wins against only five
losses and finished second in the
country. Imbernino became the
only non-senior named a first-team
All-American and once again led
Stanford in scoring with 63 goals.
"It was great, because we came
back with almost the same squad
and placed second in the country,"
Imbernino said of his sophomore
season. "We started playing to
gether as a team, and we beat
teams that were probably more
talented than us."
Being tabbed for the United
States Senior National team was
another highlight of Imbernino's
sophomore year. He was the only
sophomore and the youngest player
picked for the team, "which serves
as a training squad from which the
U.S. Olympic team is selected.
"Possibly not for the 1988 team,

but for sure for the 1992 team,"
Dettamanti said of Imbernino's
Olympic aspirations. "In 1988 he'll
be 22 or 23 years old. Most guys
don't hit their peaks in international
polo until between 25 and 28 years
old."
Going on tour with the national
team has been the main benefit so
far for Imbernino, who loves to
travel.
"It was a good experience
playing with the best players in the
world," he said. "I think it will help
me a lot for this season."
Does Imbernino feel the Olym
pics are in his future?
"I would like to play in the 1988
Olympics," he said. "In order for
me to make the team, I'll have to
improve tremendously. (But) my
main water polo goal right now is to
win an NCAA Championship."
This year the Cardinal is a
legitimate contender for the na
tional title, but recently has had to
shake off a midseason slump of
three straight losses in one-goal
games before it beat a strong
UCLA team 9-5.
"We had three losses in a row.
. . . What can I say?" Imbernino
asked. "That made us realize that
it's going to be a tough season."

Imbernino, who broke a mild
scoring slump of his own with four
goals against UCLA — to give him
27 for the season, has not been
pleased with his play so far.
"I know that I haven't been going
into each game — especially the
three in a row that we lost — with
that same killer instinct," Imber
nino said.
"He's probably one of our hard
est workers in practice," Detta
manti said. "The thing is, against
opponents that we can beat easily
he doesn't score many goals. He
doesn't pad his scoring against
weaker teams."
Imbernino also helps keep the
team loose out of the pool with his
sense of humor. While down at the
UCI water polo tournament earlier
in the season, he goaded the team
into seeing "Pee Wee's Big Ad
venture, " a movie he has seen four
times.
"He's a really interesting guy,"
Klass said. "He's kind of hard to
describe. We went to that movie on
his recommendation."
"If I had seen that movie with
anyone else," Thompson said, "I
probably would have hated it, but
with him you go along with the
jokes, because he laughs at them."
"He has kind of a weird sense of
humor," Dettamanti said. "He can
take almost anything I say and
make a pun. That's typical of Imbo
to find a movie that adults don't like
and get the whole team to like it.
"He's not your run-of-the-mill
guy. He and all the guys from New
port refuse to get their hair cut
anywhere but in Newport."
Imbernino, however, refuted this
claim.
"I finally found some Northern
California barbers that will give me
a good flattop," he said. "My first
year I would only get it cut at home,
because I didn't trust the barbers
up here."
It is in the pool, though, that Im
bernino's full importance to the
team is realized.
"When it's an important game,"
Dettamanti said, "and the game is
on the line, and we need goals,
Imbo's going to score them for us."
David Imbernino is driven by the fires burning within him.
One of these fires has helped make the Stanford junior one of the
top collegiate water polo players in the nation. But Imbernino is also
driven by something more important to him — his religion.
"I am a Christian," Imbernino said. "It's the most important thing
in my life. Glory is brought to Jesus Christ through my water polo.
My main goal is to help others find love in Jesus Christ. That's a lot of
motivation for me in water polo — God."
Imbernino became a Christian during his junior year at Corona Del
Mar High School n Newport Beach.
"My sister is a Christian," Imbernino, a political science major
said. "I saw how God was working in her life. I used to make fun of
her, but I couldn't deny that God was making a difference in her life.
That got me started reading the Bible and seeing what it was all
about."
For Imbernino the task of combining his religious beliefs with the
highly physical sport of water polo is sometimes difficult.
"There are some players in water polo today that go out and try
and give you cheap shots and try and hurt you," Imbernino said. "I
try not to do that, because if I'm playing the sport to go out and try
and hurt people, then I should quit.
"I think the game of water polo can be played aggressively and in
tensively without fighting. There are times when people hit me, and
I try to burn them, beat them on a drive and score on them.
Sometimes I'll get in a fight — I'm human."
Imbernino's play from his starting driver position is characterized
by its intensity.
"He's a Christian guy," water polo Coach Dante Dettamanti said.
"But he doesn't fit the stereotype. He's not afraid to go in there and
mix it up. He's really aggressive on offense. Sometimes I have to tell
him to take it easy.
"The other teams are constantly double-teaming him. A lot of
teams have tried to stop him one-on-one, and they can't do it," Det
tamanti added.
"He's very intense in practice," junior teammate Craig Klass said.
"It shows a lot in the way he plays."
"He's a real intense player," junior teammate Chris Thompson
said. "He has an amazing type of drive. He's real hard to guard. It's
sort of like guarding a bowl of jello. He's real flexible."
Imbernino was not always so hard to defense, as he didn't know
how to swim when he began to play the game as a high school fresh
man.
"I started playing my freshman year in high school, because some
of my friends went out for the team," Imbernino said. "My first two
years I wasn't very successful, because I was learning to swim. My
stroke still suffers today for it."
"He looks like he's kind of crawling over the water," Dettamanti
said of his prize junior. "Yet he guts it out and gets up and down the
pool."
Imbernino began to come into his own during his junior year of
high school, as he broke into the starting lineup. During his senior
season he exploded onto the national scene when he was named the
California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Player of the Year.
"He was one of the top high school players in the United States,"
Dettamanti said. "Being named the CIF Player of the Year is quite an
honor."
What followed was perhaps Det
tamanti's easiest recruiting job
ever, although many thought Im
bernino was headed to UC-Irvine.
"I knew if I got into Stanford I'd
go," Imbernino said. "The summer
before my senior year, I played
with the UCI program. The UCI
Coach [Ed Newlandl expected me
to go to his school, and there's still
a little animosity when we play."
Imbernino was thrown into the
fire as a Stanford freshman. He and
four other freshmen were called on
to start for a team depleted by two
consecutive years of heavy losses
to graduation. The inexperienced
Stanford water polo team struggled
to a 11-13-3 record, only its second
losing season in history, and

venture, " a movie he has seen four
times.
"He's a really interesting guy,"
Klass said. "He's kind of hard to
describe. We went to that movie on
his recommendation."
"If I had seen that movie with
anyone else," Thompson said, "I
probably would have hated it, but
with him you go along with the
jokes, because he laughs at them."
"He has kind of a weird sense of
humor," Dettamanti said. "He can
take almost anything I say and
make a pun. That's typical of Imbo
to find a movie that adults don't like
and get the whole team to like it.
"He's not your run-of-the-mill
guy. He and all the guys from New
port refuse to get their hair cut
anywhere but in Newport."
Imbernino, however, refuted this
claim.
"I finally found some Northern
California barbers that will give me
a good flattop," he said. "My first
year I would only get it cut at home,
because I didn't trust the barbers
up here."
It is in the pool, though, that Im
bernino's full importance to the
team is realized.
"When it's an important game,"
Dettamanti said, "and the game is
on the line, and we need goals,
Imbo's going to score them for us."
David Imbernino is driven by the fires burning within him.
One of these fires has helped make the Stanford junior one of the
top collegiate water polo players in the nation. But Imbernino is also
driven by something more important to him — his religion.
"I am a Christian," Imbernino said. "It's the most important thing
in my life. Glory is brought to Jesus Christ through my water polo.
My main goal is to help others find love in Jesus Christ. That's a lot of
motivation for me in water polo — God."
Imbernino became a Christian during his junior year at Corona Del
Mar High School n Newport Beach.
"My sister is a Christian," Imbernino, a political science major
said. "I saw how God was working in her life. I used to make fun of
her, but I couldn't deny that God was making a difference in her life.
That got me started reading the Bible and seeing what it was all
about."
For Imbernino the task of combining his religious beliefs with the
highly physical sport of water polo is sometimes difficult.
"There are some players in water polo today that go out and try
and give you cheap shots and try and hurt you," Imbernino said. "I
try not to do that, because if I'm playing the sport to go out and try
and hurt people, then I should quit.
"I think the game of water polo can be played aggressively and in
tensively without fighting. There are times when people hit me, and
I try to burn them, beat them on a drive and score on them.
Sometimes I'll get in a fight — I'm human."
Imbernino's play from his starting driver position is characterized
by its intensity.
"He's a Christian guy," water polo Coach Dante Dettamanti said.
"But he doesn't fit the stereotype. He's not afraid to go in there and
mix it up. He's really aggressive on offense. Sometimes I have to tell
him to take it easy.
"The other teams are constantly double-teaming him. A lot of
teams have tried to stop him one-on-one, and they can't do it," Det
tamanti added.
"He's very intense in practice," junior teammate Craig Klass said.
"It shows a lot in the way he plays."
"He's a real intense player," junior teammate Chris Thompson
said. "He has an amazing type of drive. He's real hard to guard. It's
sort of like guarding a bowl of jello. He's real flexible."
Imbernino was not always so hard to defense, as he didn't know
how to swim when he began to play the game as a high school fresh
man.
"I started playing my freshman year in high school, because some
of my friends went out for the team," Imbernino said. "My first two
years I wasn't very successful, because I was learning to swim. My
stroke still suffers today for it."
"He looks like he's kind of crawling over the water," Dettamanti
said of his prize junior. "Yet he guts it out and gets up and down the
pool."
Imbernino began to come into his own during his junior year of
high school, as he broke into the starting lineup. During his senior
season he exploded onto the national scene when he was named the
California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Player of the Year.
"He was one of the top high school players in the United States,"
Dettamanti said. "Being named the CIF Player of the Year is quite an
honor."
What followed was perhaps Det
tamanti's easiest recruiting job
ever, although many thought Im
bernino was headed to UC-Irvine.
"I knew if I got into Stanford I'd
go," Imbernino said. "The summer
before my senior year, I played
with the UCI program. The UCI
Coach [Ed Newlandl expected me
to go to his school, and there's still
a little animosity when we play."
Imbernino was thrown into the
fire as a Stanford freshman. He and
four other freshmen were called on
to start for a team depleted by two
consecutive years of heavy losses
to graduation. The inexperienced
Stanford water polo team struggled
to a 11-13-3 record, only its second
losing season in history, and
missed the NCAA Tournament for
the first time in Dettamanti's
seven-year tenure.
"You could see the talent was
there," Dettamanti said. "It was
really a young team. Imbo immedi
ately became our leader."
"I was pleased that I scored
some goals," Imbernino said of a
freshman year that saw him lead

the team with 40 goals. "But our
team didn't do so well. That kind of
put a damper on the goals. The pur
pose is for the team to win .
"I did realize during my freshman
year that I could play on the col
legiate level. We just needed a little
experience, " he added.
The potential everyone saw in
the Cardinal finally became plainly
visible the next year, as Stanford
racked up 25 wins against only five
losses and finished second in the
country. Imbernino became the
only non-senior named a first-team
All-American and once again led
Stanford in scoring with 63 goals.
"It was great, because we came
back with almost the same squad
and placed second in the country,"
Imbernino said of his sophomore
season. "We started playing to
gether as a team, and we beat
teams that were probably more
talented than us."
Being tabbed for the United
States Senior National team was
another highlight of Imbernino's
sophomore year. He was the only
sophomore and the youngest player
picked for the team, "which serves
as a training squad from which the
U.S. Olympic team is selected.
"Possibly not for the 1988 team,

but for sure for the 1992 team,"
Dettamanti said of Imbernino's
Olympic aspirations. "In 1988 he'll
be 22 or 23 years old. Most guys
don't hit their peaks in international
polo until between 25 and 28 years
old."
Going on tour with the national
team has been the main benefit so
far for Imbernino, who loves to
travel.
"It was a good experience
playing with the best players in the
world," he said. "I think it will help
me a lot for this season."
Does Imbernino feel the Olym
pics are in his future?
"I would like to play in the 1988
Olympics," he said. "In order for
me to make the team, I'll have to
improve tremendously. (But) my
main water polo goal right now is to
win an NCAA Championship."
This year the Cardinal is a
legitimate contender for the na
tional title, but recently has had to
shake off a midseason slump of
three straight losses in one-goal
games before it beat a strong
UCLA team 9-5.
"We had three losses in a row.
. . . What can I say?" Imbernino
asked. "That made us realize that
it's going to be a tough season."

Imbernino, who broke a mild
scoring slump of his own with four
goals against UCLA — to give him
27 for the season, has not been
pleased with his play so far.
"I know that I haven't been going
into each game — especially the
three in a row that we lost — with
that same killer instinct," Imber
nino said.
"He's probably one of our hard
est workers in practice," Detta
manti said. "The thing is, against
opponents that we can beat easily
he doesn't score many goals. He
doesn't pad his scoring against
weaker teams."
Imbernino also helps keep the
team loose out of the pool with his
sense of humor. While down at the
UCI water polo tournament earlier
in the season, he goaded the team
into seeing "Pee Wee's Big Ad
venture, " a movie he has seen four
times.
"He's a really interesting guy,"
Klass said. "He's kind of hard to
describe. We went to that movie on
his recommendation."
"If I had seen that movie with
anyone else," Thompson said, "I
probably would have hated it, but
with him you go along with the
jokes, because he laughs at them."
"He has kind of a weird sense of
humor," Dettamanti said. "He can
take almost anything I say and
make a pun. That's typical of Imbo
to find a movie that adults don't like
and get the whole team to like it.
"He's not your run-of-the-mill
guy. He and all the guys from New
port refuse to get their hair cut
anywhere but in Newport."
Imbernino, however, refuted this
claim.
"I finally found some Northern
California barbers that will give me
a good flattop," he said. "My first
year I would only get it cut at home,
because I didn't trust the barbers
up here."
It is in the pool, though, that Im
bernino's full importance to the
team is realized.
"When it's an important game,"
Dettamanti said, "and the game is
on the line, and we need goals,
Imbo's going to score them for us."
