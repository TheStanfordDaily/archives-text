David Imbernino is driven by the fires burning within him.
One of these fires has helped make the Stanford junior one of the
top collegiate water polo players in the nation. But Imbernino is also
driven by something more important to him — his religion.
"I am a Christian," Imbernino said. "It's the most important thing
in my life. Glory is brought to Jesus Christ through my water polo.
My main goal is to help others find love in Jesus Christ. That's a lot of
motivation for me in water polo — God."
Imbernino became a Christian during his junior year at Corona Del
Mar High School n Newport Beach.
"My sister is a Christian," Imbernino, a political science major
said. "I saw how God was working in her life. I used to make fun of
her, but I couldn't deny that God was making a difference in her life.
That got me started reading the Bible and seeing what it was all
about."
For Imbernino the task of combining his religious beliefs with the
highly physical sport of water polo is sometimes difficult.
"There are some players in water polo today that go out and try
and give you cheap shots and try and hurt you," Imbernino said. "I
try not to do that, because if I'm playing the sport to go out and try
and hurt people, then I should quit.
"I think the game of water polo can be played aggressively and in
tensively without fighting. There are times when people hit me, and
I try to burn them, beat them on a drive and score on them.
Sometimes I'll get in a fight — I'm human."
Imbernino's play from his starting driver position is characterized
by its intensity.
"He's a Christian guy," water polo Coach Dante Dettamanti said.
"But he doesn't fit the stereotype. He's not afraid to go in there and
mix it up. He's really aggressive on offense. Sometimes I have to tell
him to take it easy.
"The other teams are constantly double-teaming him. A lot of
teams have tried to stop him one-on-one, and they can't do it," Det
tamanti added.
"He's very intense in practice," junior teammate Craig Klass said.
"It shows a lot in the way he plays."
"He's a real intense player," junior teammate Chris Thompson
said. "He has an amazing type of drive. He's real hard to guard. It's
sort of like guarding a bowl of jello. He's real flexible."
Imbernino was not always so hard to defense, as he didn't know
how to swim when he began to play the game as a high school fresh
man.
"I started playing my freshman year in high school, because some
of my friends went out for the team," Imbernino said. "My first two
years I wasn't very successful, because I was learning to swim. My
stroke still suffers today for it."
"He looks like he's kind of crawling over the water," Dettamanti
said of his prize junior. "Yet he guts it out and gets up and down the
pool."
Imbernino began to come into his own during his junior year of
high school, as he broke into the starting lineup. During his senior
season he exploded onto the national scene when he was named the
California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Player of the Year.
"He was one of the top high school players in the United States,"
Dettamanti said. "Being named the CIF Player of the Year is quite an
honor."
