# Missouri Has a Show-Me Showdown
## St. Louis beats the Dodgers On Clark's shot in the ninth 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Jack Clark, acquired in the
off season to put some power in a lineup built on speed,
hit a three-run home run with two out in the ninth in
ning to give the St. Louis Cardinals a 7-5 victory over
Los Angeles yesterday and send the Cardinals into
their 14th World Series.
Twice, the Cardinals fought back from deficits in the
sixth game of the National League playoffs to beat the
Dodgers and earn the right to meet the Kansas City
Royals, the winner of the American League playoff.
The Cardinals thus completed a four-game sweep of
the Dodgers after losing the first two games.
Ozzie Smith, the playoff series' Most Valuable
Player who had won the fifth game with a ninth-inning
homer, capped a three-run seventh with a run-scoring
triple that tied the score 4-4, but the Dodgers regained
the lead on a lead-off homer by Mike Marshall in the
eighth.
Facing the Dodgers' ace reliever, Tom Niedenfuer,
the Cardinals started their winning rally with one out in
the ninth on a single by Willie McGee, who came into
the game with only four hits in 21 playoff at-bats.
McGee stole second and Niedenfuer then walked
Smith, whose ninth-inning homer in Game 5 had beaten
the Dodgers relief pitcher.
A bouncing ball to first by Tommy Herr sent the run
ners to second and third, and Clark, the Cardinals'
cleanup hitter, hit the first pitch deep into the left field
stands as Dodgers out fielder Pedro Guerrero watched
helplessly.
Guerrero threw his mitt to the ground in disgust,
and the Cardinals poured out of their dugout to
welcome Clark, who had only one previous RBI in the
series.
The hit put the Cardinals in only their second World
Series since divisional play was instituted in 1969. The
Cardinals won the 1982 World Series over Milwaukee
in seven games.
The winning pitcher yesterday was rookie right
hander Todd Worrell, who gave up Marshall's eight
inning homer, and left-hander Ken Dayley pitched the
ninth inning to save it for the Cardinals.
This was a contest settled between the bullpens of
the two teams. Dodgers starter Orel Hershiser
worked six-and-one-third innings, and the St. Louis
starter, Joaquin Andujar, went six innings, neither
pitching very effectively.

Hershiser beat Andujar in Game 2 in Los Angeles,
but that was the last game the Dodgers would win in
this series. The Cardinals swept three at home, win
ning 4-2, 12-2 and 3-2 before returning to Los Angeles
for what would be the final game of the playoffs.
Hershiser gave up a run in the third, then was
chased in the seventh after McGee's two-run single.
Andujar gave up runs in the first and second innings,
and Bill Madlock's solo homer, his third of the playoffs,
capped a two-run fifth.
Besides his home run, Madlock also drove in a run
with a single, and Mariano Duncan had three hits, an
RBI and scored twice for the Dodgers.
In the Cardinal seventh, Smith drove in the tying run
in a dramatic rematch against Niedenfuer. Smith had
hit the first left-handed home run of his career to beat
Niedenfuer and the Dodgers in the bottom of the ninth
inning in Game 5.
Darrell Porter and Tito Landrum got the Cardinals'
seventh going with consecutive singles off Hershiser.
A bouncer to first by pinch-hitter Steve Braun ad
vanced the runners, and McGee, who came into the
game with just four hits in 21 playoff at-bats, punched a
two-run single up the middle, chasing Hershiser.
