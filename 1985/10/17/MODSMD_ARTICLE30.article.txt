# Scrappy Royals never say die
## Sundberg Leads Kansas City 
### 
TORONTO (AP) — The Kansas
City Royals, the team that would
not quit, completed a stunning turn
around last night by beating the
Toronto Blue Jays 6-2 behind Jim
Sundberg's four RBI performance
to win the decisive seventh game of
the American League playoffs and
advance to the World Series.
The victory set up an all-
Missouri, Show-Me State Show
down in the World Series. The se
ries, commencing Saturday night in

Kansas City, will feature the Royals
and the St. Louis Cardinals, who
won the National League pennant
earlier yesterday by beating Los
Angeles, 7-5.
The Royals iced their comeback
from a three games-to-one deficit
when Sundberg drove in three runs
with a bases-loaded triple off the
top of the right field wall in the sixth
inning.
Thus ended Canada's hopes for
the first World Series outside the

United States.
In any other year since divisional
playoffs began in 1969, Toronto
would have won, three games to
one. But this year, for the first
time, it was a best-of-seven format,
not best-of-five, and the Royals
took full advantage of the extra two
games.

One of the few bright spots for the Dodgers came in the fifth inning yesterday, when Cardinal
Willie McGee was caught attempting to steal second. Los Angeles shortstop Mariano Duncan ap
plied the tag. St. Louis won 7-5 and took the best-of-seven series in six games.
than teammate George Brett, the
playoff series' Most Valuable
Player, who had eight hits, includ
ing three home runs in 23 at-bats.
Kansas City's victory reversed
AL East dominance in recent
league playoffs. The 1980 Royals
were the last AL West team to win
a playoff and the Oakland teams of
1972-73-74 were the only other
Western representatives to win
since divisional play began.
Only four times in World Series
history have teams rallied from 3-1
deicits. Of the 33 clubs that trailed
by that margin, only Pittsburgh in
1925 and 1979, the New York
Yankees in 1958 and the Detroit
Tigers in 1968 came back to win.
The Royals won the game by rip
ping Dave Stieb, who led the league
in earned run average this season.
Stieb, who won the opener and
pitched powerfully despite getting
no decision in Game 4, left the
game after Sundberg's triple.
Stieb was charged with six
earned runs, his second-highest
total of the season.

Kansas City starter Bret Saber
hagen, winner Charlie Leibrandt
and Dan Quisenberry, who got the
final two outs, gave the Royals the
clutch pitching they needed for the
third straight game.
In the final three games of the se
ries, Toronto stranded 26 runners,
17 in scoring position. The Blue
Jays, who hit just a shade under
.300 with runners in scoring posi
tion during the regular season,
stranded nine runners in their final
game of the year, including six in
scoring position.
Sundberg, just 2-for-20 in the
postseason entering the game, sin
gled home a run in the second in
ning. Pat Sheridan, with only one
hit in 16 playoff at-bats, homered in
the fourth for a 2-0 lead.
The Blue Jays halved the lead in
the fifth on a single by Garcia and a
two-out double by Upshaw, but
Kansas City broke the game open
in the sixth against a struggling
Stieb.
The Royals' big inning silenced
the crowd of 32,084 — more than
10,000 under capacity — who had
watched in 45-degree weather in
hopes that their Blue Jays could
bring home a winner.

In the third inning of yesterday's Royal triumph, Toronto's Willie
Upshaw shows his frustration after grounding out to first and
then never making it out of the box. Dave Phillips is the
homeplate umpire.
