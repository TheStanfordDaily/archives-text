# Scrappy Royals never say die
## Sundberg Leads Kansas City 
### 
TORONTO (AP) â€” The Kansas
City Royals, the team that would
not quit, completed a stunning turn
around last night by beating the
Toronto Blue Jays 6-2 behind Jim
Sundberg's four RBI performance
to win the decisive seventh game of
the American League playoffs and
advance to the World Series.
The victory set up an all-
Missouri, Show-Me State Show
down in the World Series. The se
ries, commencing Saturday night in

Kansas City, will feature the Royals
and the St. Louis Cardinals, who
won the National League pennant
earlier yesterday by beating Los
Angeles, 7-5.
The Royals iced their comeback
from a three games-to-one deficit
when Sundberg drove in three runs
with a bases-loaded triple off the
top of the right field wall in the sixth
inning.
Thus ended Canada's hopes for
the first World Series outside the

United States.
In any other year since divisional
playoffs began in 1969, Toronto
would have won, three games to
one. But this year, for the first
time, it was a best-of-seven format,
not best-of-five, and the Royals
took full advantage of the extra two
games.
Sundberg finished the series with
a team-high six RBIs, one more

One of the few bright spots for the Dodgers came in the fifth inning yesterday, when Cardinal
Willie McGee was caught attempting to steal second. Los Angeles shortstop Mariano Duncan ap
plied the tag. St. Louis won 7-5 and took the best-of-seven series in six games.
