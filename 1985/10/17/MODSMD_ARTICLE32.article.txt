# Football Playoffs: The Time Is Now
## 
### 
Last week the overexpanded
playoffs in professional sports
were discussed here. This week
the subject turns to a college
football playoff.
In college football the problem
is not overexpansion; it's an ab
sence of any playoff system at
all. The national championship is
decided by the Associated Press
poll of sportswriters and the
United Press International
coaches' poll. Often there isn't
agreement between the two
polls, let alone followers of
teams that think they had a shot
at being No. 1.

The main obstacle to a playoff
is the abundance of postseason
bowl games eager to write large
checks to teams verging on
mediocrity and haul in larger
profits for themselves. In recent
years, teams have come out of
bowl games with 6-6 records,
hardly a mark that merits
postseason play.
Since the bowl games cannot
be abolished entirely — in fact
shouldn't be abolished entirely
— a playoff system must be de
signed to work around them.
One way would be to incor
porate the current bowls into a
16-team playoff structure. Use
the same four regions as in bas
ketball and give automatic berths
to the champions of the six major
football conferences: in the West
to the Pac-10; in the Midwest to
the Southwest Conference and
the Big Eight; in the Mideast to
the Big Ten and the Southeast
ern Conference; and in the East
to the Atlantic Coast Confer
ence. Pick the other 10 teams at
large.
Use the Aloha, Holiday, Sun,
Bluebonnet, Independence,
Cherry, Peach and Citrus bowls
for first-round games. Hold the
regional finals at the Fiesta

(West), Cotton (Midwest),
Liberty (Mideast) and Gator
(East) Bowls. Hold the semi
finals in the Orange and Sugar
Bowls, and put the game for the
national championship in the
Rose Bowl on New Year's Day.
Starting the playoffs in the
first week of December would
allow three weeks of playoffs
before the final on Jan. 1, which
should placate those who claim a
playoff would make the season
too long. Only two teams would
be playing after Christmas,
compared to the current 20 or
so.
Talking baseball
Second-guess of the playoffs:
Los Angeles pitching to Jack
Clark with first base open and a
5-4 lead over St. Louis with two
outs in the bottom of the ninth
yesterday. Though intentionally
walking Clark to load the bases
may not have been the way to
go, pitching around him was.
Non-second guess: Toronto
manager Bobby Cox leaving
starter Dave Stieb in with the
bases loaded in the sixth inning
with Kansas City leading 2-1 last
night. Though Stieb surrendered
a three-run triple to Jim
Sundberg that blew the game
open, you can't question Cox's
reasoning: You go with your
best, and Stieb is the Blue Jays'
best.
Class act: George Brett in the
World Series. It's always nice to
see a great player get a shot to
win it all. Also Clark, hitting the
pennant-winning homer and get
ting to play in the Series after all
those years in Candlestick Park.
Lack of class: The fans who
ran out onto the field in Toronto
during the ninth inning last night,
giving fans throughout the
United States and Canada a very
bad impression of one of the
most exciting, safest, friendliest
cities in North America.

No room this week. Send let
ters to The Daily, and we'll run
them next Thursday.
