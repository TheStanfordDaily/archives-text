Mubarak Urged To Break Ties
CAIRO, Egypt — Anti-American demonstrations erupted yester
day here for the second time in four days, and opposition party
leaders met with President Hosni Mubarak to ask that he sever
diplomatic relations with Israel and the United States.
Government sources said that Mubarak rejected the request, and
told the leaders of five small opposition parties that Egypt must
respect its peace treaty with Israel and cannot afford to sever its ties
to the United States.
While the meeting was taking place, more than 1,000 students at
Ein Shams University, the second largest in Cairo, took to the
streets to protest the U.S. capture last Thursday of an Egyptian air
liner carrying the hijackers of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro to
Tunisia. The airliner, denied permission to land in Tunisia, was inter
cepted by U.S. jet fighters and forced to land in Sicily, where the
four hijackers were arrested.
In a smaller but more violent demonstration Saturday at Cairo Uni
versity, some 30 students were injured and about 20 others were ar
rested in clashes with police.
Political analysts said that the demonstrations and opposition
demands for diplomatic action have created a difficult situation for
Mubarak. He is caught between the need to respond to a wave of
anti-American sentiment and his dependence on the United States,
which will Supply Egypt with $2.5 billion in economic and military aid
this year.
The five opposition parties, which range from leftist to conserva
tive fundamentalist, were received by Mubarak for only the second
time in two years to discuss the crisis, which has brought U.S-
Egyptian relations to a 10-year low.
Americans, German Win Nobels
STOCKHOLM, Sweden — Two American researchers will share
the 1985 Nobel Prize in chemistry, and a West German scientist has
won the Nobel Prize in physics, the Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences announced yesterday.
Prof. Herbert Hauptman, 68, of the Medical Foundation of Buffalo,
N.Y., and Jerome Karle, 67, of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory
won the chemistry prize for their efforts to develop direct methods
to determine the structure of crystals.
Prof. Klaus von Klitzing, 42, of West Germany's Max Planck In
stitute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart, was awarded the
physics prize for his discovery of a phenomenon in quantum physics
that can be used to measure electrical resistance.
"It's fantastic; I can't believe it," Klitzing said after learning that he
had won the prize.
The Swedish academy said that the American scientists were
being honored for developing methods that have since become useful
tools in determining the structure of molecules, in inorganic and or
ganic chemistry.
The two will share the 1.8 million kroner prize, worth about
$225,000, which goes with the award.
Nicaragua Relaxes Civil Rights
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — In a move that appeared to be aimed at
the political opposition, and particularly Catholic Church leaders,
Nicaragua's ruling Sandinistas have abruptly reinstated and
broadened widely criticized restrictions on civil liberties in
Nicaragua.
The decision, announced Tuesday night by President Daniel Or
tega, appeared to close a period during which the Nicaraguan gov
ernment sought to parry criticism of its rule by relaxing or
selectively applying strictures of a state of emergency decreed in
March 1982 and renewed every six months as part of the war against
U.S.-sponsored insurgents.
Ortega said U.S. backing for rebels fighting to overthrow the San
dinistas made necessary the new steps, which he described as a
year-long state of emergency now applied to the entire country.
Parts of the previous emergency decree had been suspended except
in war zones since summer 1984, when the country prepared for
presidential elections that in November endorsed Ortega's leader
ship by a comfortable margin.
In Washington, Administration officials harshly criticized the
move, which the State Department described as "a further step
toward imposing a totalitarian regime on the people of Nicaragua."
7 Nations Confer on Education
TOKYO — The United States and six other industrialized
democracies opened an unprecedented international education con
ference here this week to explore common issues and themes in an
education-reform movement that increasingly appears global in its
scope.
In the opening talks, participants — including a seven-member
delegation of top-ranking U.S. officials — sounded strikingly
similar themes on topics such as returning to "basics," expanding
vocational education, surviving budget cuts, combating school vio
lence and student delinquency, upgrading standards of curricula, im
proving the teaching force and deciding how much if at all govern
ment should support private schools.
The setting for this conference is also significant since the United
States, Australia and Western Europe have shown an intense inter
est in Japan's educational system, often regarded as a world model
for its high academic standards and rigid discipline.
But the Westerners here are getting a different perspective on the
Japanese system, which is under attack here at home for being too
rigid, too concerned with examinations at the expense of analytical
thinking and incapable of dealing with children with special needs —
like slow learners and the disabled. The Japanese officials who organ
ized this conference specifically asked the Americans to address
these issues.
Gandhi Death Plot Foiled
LONDON — Police in the city of Leicester yesterday charged
four Asian men with conspiring to assassinate Indian Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi during his two-day official visit here that ended Tues
day.
The police did not identify the men and gave no details of the
charges, which are due to be read during a court arraignment in the
central British city this morning.
The four, who were said to be residents of Leicester, were among
ten people arrested there Friday and held without charge under Brit
ain's Prevention of Terrorism Act. Two other men, identified as
members of the Sikh religion, also were arrested in London that day.
Leicester police would not say whether the four being charged
were Sikhs, and a spokesman said "we are not interested in their re
ligious persuasion."
