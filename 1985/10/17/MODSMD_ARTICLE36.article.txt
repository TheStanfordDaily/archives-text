# Prime minister expected to resign
## Craxi Coalition Faces Collapse 
### 
ROME â€” The government of Prime Minister
Bettino Craxi yesterday faced imminent collapse
after one of the five parties in the coalition
withdrew in protest over the government's
handling of last week's hijack of the cruise liner
Achille Lauro.
The fall of Craxi's 26-month old government,
one of the longest-lived in post-war Italy,
became a virtual certainty yesterday when the
tiny but influential pro-American Republican
party of Defense Minister Giovanni Spadolini an
nounced that it was quitting Craxi's governing
coalition because it had not been adequately
"consulted" in the course of the hijacking crisis
and its aftermath.
Sources close to President Francesco Cossiga
said yesterday night that Craxi was expected to
visit the president this morning and formally
present his resignation, thus avoiding a par
liamentary debate on the Craxi government's
foreign policy that the prime minister had vowed
to hold against the opposition of virtually all the
rest of his coalition partners.

The planned debate had been considered an
explosive political issue that might have greatly
fragmented the general governing consensus
that has prevailed in Italy since Craxi took over
the prime ministership in August 1983 to head
Italy's 44th government since the end of World
War 11.
As the man with the greatest chance to put to
gether another government, Craxi is expected
to be charged by Cossiga with trying to form a
new coalition, most probably with the four
remaining parties that have, with varying
degrees of enthusiasm, supported him during
the hijacking crisis. Aside from the Republicans
and his own Socialist party, Craxi's government
had been supported by the dominant Christian
Democrats, the Liberals and the Social Demo
crats.
The collapse of Craxi's government just one
month short of becoming the longest-serving
government in post-war Italy came after un
precedented U.S. criticism of Craxi's handling of
a Washington request for the extradition of a

senior Palestinian official, Mohammed Abbas.
U.S. authorities accuse Abbas of masterminding
the Achille Lauro hijacking, which resulted in the
death of Leon Klinghoffer, a 69-year-old pas
senger from New York.
Klinghoffer's body, which washed ashore in
Syria Tuesday, was flown here yesterday after
noon from Damascus for an official autopsy to be
performed this morning at Rome's Institute of
Legal Medicine. U.S. officials who identified the
body in Damascus yesterday morning have said
it bore gunshot wounds in the head and back.
Last night, the Achille Lauro steamed back to
its port of departure in Genoa with a handful of
passengers who remained on the ill-fated cruise.
Magistrates from Genoa and Sicily who are
preparing the Italian legal case against the four
hijackers, now jailed in a maximum security
prison in Spoleto, boarded the ship Tuesday
night as it reached the Straits of Messina and ap
parently questioned Capt. Gerardo de Rosa,
crewmen and passengers before the ship
docked.
