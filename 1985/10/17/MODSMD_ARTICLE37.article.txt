# Commonwealth Members Urge Pretoria Sanctions
## 
### 
NASSAU, Bahamas — The
leaders of the Commonwealth na
tions heard strong demands yester
day for mandatory economic sanc
tions against South Africa as the
only realistic way to end that na
tion's policy of apartheid.
Typical of the calls for punishing
the Pretoria regime was the speech
by Indian Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi during the opening session
of the 20th meeting of the Com
monwealth Heads of Government.
Charging that South Africa "is
impervious to reason" and is
waging war against its own people,
the Indian leader said that the Com
monwealth "must demand compre
hensive and mandatory sanctions.
The question cannot be deferred."

Nonetheless, British Prime Mini
ster Margaret Thatcher, the main
opponent of radical measures
against the Pretoria regime, ap
peared unmoved by the pleas for
joint action by the 49-member
group.
Sources in the British delegation
said Thatcher remains a committed
opponent of apartheid, but opposes
mandatory sanctions and boycotts
because she believes they would be
ineffective, would hurt South
Africa's blacks and would
strengthen right-wing elements in
Pretoria.
Instead, they said, she wants to
keep up pressure on South Africa
while encouraging the government

there to extend economic and politi
cal rights to the country's 25 million
blacks.
But the sentiment during the 90-
minute session was clearly running
against Thatcher. Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad
belitted the British arguments.
"If sanctions can help destroy a
despicable policy like apartheid," he
said, "then sanctions must be ap
plied, and they must be applied by
those ... countries with the biggest
economic clout. Failure to do so
would mean hypocrisy on the part
of those countries."
As it became clear that Britain's
position isolated it from the other
Commonwealth nations, several
leaders, including those from

Canada and Australia, pushed their
efforts to find some formula that
would allow the biennial meeting to
end Tuesday with a joint statement,
a goal of all Commonwealth
meetings.
Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney told the delegates, "We
have always worked by consensus,
(and) we must do so now on so im
portant an issue." He suggested a
compromise might be possible if the
Commonwealth nations were to
issue a joint call for "an early transi
tion to equal rights and equal partic
ipation in all aspects of national life
by all South Africans."
South Africa withdrew from the
Commonwealth group 24 years
ago, as it was about to be expelled.
