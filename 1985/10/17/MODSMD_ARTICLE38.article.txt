'Excess' Black Deaths
WASHINGTON — Nearly 60,000 black
Americans die each year because the nation
has failed to push their disease and death rates
down to the same level as those for whites in
six categories — heart disease, homicide, can
cer, low birthweight, cirrhosis and diabetes —
the Department of Health and Human Services
reported yesterday.
The report, based on a year-long study of
minority health problems, calculated that from
1979 to 1981, an annual average of 138,635
blacks below the age of 70 died from all
causes. If black death rates from diseases,
homicides and accidents had been the same as
for whites, the number of black deaths would
have been 79,693 annually — meaning 58,942
"excess" deaths a year due to poorer health
conditions.
The report also found about 2,000 "excess"
deaths annually among American Indians and
other native Americans. Persons of Hispanic
origin also had a higher death rate than that for
whites.
Report Rips Pentagon
WASHINGTON — The Defense Depart
ment's preparations for war and ability to fight
are seriously hampered by interservice
rivalry, poor Pentagon management and con
gressional nitpicking, and needs a major over
haul, according to a Senate report released
yesterday.

The study, billed as the most detailed cri
tique of the Defense Department since it was
established in 1949, urges replacement of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff with a more independent
council of senior military advisers. It also adv
ocates reorganization of the Pentagon and
strengthening of theater commanders sta
tioned abroad.
The 645-page report, citing 34 major flaws
that allegedly compromise military efficiency,
faults the Joint Chiefs for loyalty to individual
services rather than the common good of na
tional defense. The office of the secretary of
defense has historically failed to focus ade
quately on important strategic issues, and
theater commanders overseas lack the author
ity to enforce cooperation between the various
forces within their units, the study adds.
The study suggests that Congress provide
broad guidance for the nation's defense and
restrict itself to close scrutiny of the defense
budget once every two years rather than an
nually.
U.S. Airs Trade Ills
WASHINGTON — Continuing its new "get
tough" trade policy, the Reagan Administra
tion yesterday charged the European Common
Market with subsidizing its grain exports and
South Korea with failing to protect U.S.
patents and copyrights from infringement.
The action against the Common Market,
whose member governments make direct pay
ments to farmers so they can afford to sell

their grain abroad at artificially low prices,
could bring to a head within months a long
building U.S. grievance against European
farmers.
U.S. Special Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter, who will argue the Administration's
case, may request a formal hearing if 30 days
of negotiations with the Common Market yield
no results. After the hearing, he could turn to
a dispute settlement panel, established under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
whose recommendations must be accepted by
all affected countries.
The case against Korea focuses on its failure
to enact copyright laws that would protect
U.S. authors and patent laws that would
prevent the copying of pharmaceuticals,
chemicals and processed foods. Officials were
unable to estimate the cost- of exports lost to
the threat of patent infringement, but the
publishing industry estimates losses of $170
million a year from lost exports to South Korea
and third countries.

market revived its recent rally with a strong
