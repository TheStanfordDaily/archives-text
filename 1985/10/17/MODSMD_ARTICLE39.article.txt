Five Fires Contained
LOS ANGELES — Savage Santa Ana winds
that hurled dozens of wildfires across 80,000
acres of brittle Southern California chaparral
receded yesterday, giving firefighters the up
per hand on all but one major blaze.
Since Monday, the wind-whipped fires have
destroyed 23 homes, injured six firefighters
and closed roads in hardest-hit areas.
Six fires still burned yesterday, but five
were contained or near containment,
firefighters said.
The most stubborn of the fires reported
since Monday, the Ferndale-Wheeler Canyon
fire near Santa Paula, raged out of control in
Ventura County, 60 miles northwest of Los
Angeles, consuming 42,000 acres and spread
ing into the Los Padres National Forest.
"We have no estimate of when it will be con

tained," said U.S. Forest Service spokesman
Carl Summerfield.
Whale Flees Sea
RIO VISTA — Sightseers created rural traf
fic jams yesterday as a confused 45-ton
humpback whale, dubbed "E.T.," continued
its unique, salmon-like freshwater sojourn in
the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.
By late afternoon, the 40-foot-long mammal
that has spent five days in inland California
waters was again traveling north and upstream
away from the sea in Cache Slough. The
waterway is situated near the southern end of
the Sacramento River Deep Water Channel,
about 25 miles south of Sacramento.
The whale apparently wandered into San
Francisco Bay last week during its normal

Alaska-to-Mexico fall migration. Whales are
spotted almost every year in the salt waters of
the Bay. But the California Marine Mammal
Center said it had no previous reports of
whales found in the freshwater rivers of Cali
fornia.
Ng Charged: 9 Killings
SAN ANDREAS — Charles Ng, the former
companion of alleged mass killer Leonard
Lake, was accused yesterday of killing nine
people, including a two-year-old boy, as
prosecutors launched their first steps to ex
tradite Ng from Canada.
Investigators have linked Ng and Lake to
the disappearances of at least 22 people over
two years in a bizarre mass-murder case that
has included video tapes of sexual torture.
