# Rally Challenges Alleged Brutality
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
More than 200 students gathered
in front of University President
Donald Kennedy's office yesterday,
protesting alleged police brutality in
Friday's arrest of Stanford senior
Robby Perkins during a sit-in at Old
Union.
During the rally, leaders of the
Black Student Union (BSU) met
with Kennedy, Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington and Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons.
According to senior Steve Phil
lips, chairman of the BSU, "not a
whole lot happened" during the
meeting, although he said Lyons
told the group that the University
would pay for the medical treat
ment Perkins required after he was
released from jail.
Perkins was treated for bruises
and other injuries he said he suf
fered at the hands of police officers.
Herrington has said his officers did
not use unnecessary force while
making arrests Friday, and a
spokesman for the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Office has said that
Perkins was restrained and strip
searched because he refused to
cooperate with police and kicked
deputies at the North County Jail in
Palo Alto.
According to Phillips, Kennedy
said he needs a complete report
from the police before an examina

tion of the incident can take place.
During the rally, police arrested
Jack Testy for possession of a dan
gerous weapon, according to Stan
ford Police Detective John McMul
len.
McMullen said Testy was taken
to North County Jail in Palo Alto
and booked there.
University spokesman Bob
Beyers said Testy had bullets in a
belt buckle and a knife under his
coat.
Rev. Byron Bland of the United
Campus Christian Ministry said
Testy made racial slurs and pushed
him as Testy moved toward
Perkins as he spoke to the crowd.
Testy's connection to Stanford, if
any, was not known last night.
McMullen said three plainclothes
officers were at the rally and that
police made an audio tape of the
proceedings for their records.
McMullen said the rally "seemed
pretty quiet. There were no prob
lems."
At yesterday's rally, Perkins,
who is black, told the racially mixed
crowd that he is "pursuing this
(brutality) thing all the way to the
courts." Perkins has said that his al
leged mistreatment was motivated
by his race.
"I've got the evidence and think I
can prove it in court,"he said.
Perkins said that he plans to file
charges against police next week,
