# Rally Challenges Alleged Brutality
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
More than 200 students gathered
in front of University President
Donald Kennedy's office yesterday,
protesting alleged police brutality in
Friday's arrest of Stanford senior
Robby Perkins during a sit-in at Old
Union.
During the rally, leaders of the
Black Student Union (BSU) met
with Kennedy, Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington and Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons.
According to senior Steve Phil
lips, chairman of the BSU, "not a
whole lot happened" during the
meeting, although he said Lyons
told the group that the University
would pay for the medical treat
ment Perkins required after he was
released from jail.
Perkins was treated for bruises
and other injuries he said he suf
fered at the hands of police officers.
Herrington has said his officers did
not use unnecessary force while
making arrests Friday, and a
spokesman for the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Office has said that
Perkins was restrained and strip
searched because he refused to
cooperate with police and kicked
deputies at the North County Jail in
Palo Alto.
According to Phillips, Kennedy
said he needs a complete report
from the police before an examina

tion of the incident can take place.
During the rally, police arrested
Jack Testy for possession of a dan
gerous weapon, according to Stan
ford Police Detective John McMul
len.
McMullen said Testy was taken
to North County Jail in Palo Alto
and booked there.
University spokesman Bob
Beyers said Testy had bullets in a
belt buckle and a knife under his
coat.
Rev. Byron Bland of the United
Campus Christian Ministry said
Testy made racial slurs and pushed
him as Testy moved toward
Perkins as he spoke to the crowd.
Testy's connection to Stanford, if
any, was not known last night.
McMullen said three plainclothes
officers were at the rally and that
police made an audio tape of the
proceedings for their records.
McMullen said the rally "seemed
pretty quiet. There were no prob
lems."
At yesterday's rally, Perkins,
who is black, told the racially mixed
crowd that he is "pursuing this
(brutality) thing all the way to the
courts." Perkins has said that his al
leged mistreatment was motivated
by his race.
"I've got the evidence and think I
can prove it in court,"he said.
Perkins said that he plans to file
charges against police next week,

At yesterday's BSU rally in the Quad, Robby Perkins
demonstrates to a crowd of more than 200 students how police
twisted his arm. Perkins charged that he was beaten by police
at North County Jail. Police have denied his accusation
although he could not specify
against which police department.
"I've got to think back to the
names and faces," he said. "They
were all affiliated with Santa Clara
County."
Perkins was charged with
trespassing, unlawful assembly,
refusal to disperse from an unlaw
ful assembly, remaining at the
scene of a riot after a warning to
disperse and resisting arrest during
a protest Friday against University
investments in companies doing
business in South Africa. Eight
other students were also arrested.
"I try to live my life as though I
am always on the witness stand
. . . 1 wish others would do the
same," Perkins said.
"I don't want my money invested
(in South Africa), and that's why I
walked into Old Union Friday," he
said. " I wanted to be arrested, but
not beaten."
Perkins said he "felt like an
animal" after the arrest.
"The Stanford police force is the
armed wing of the Stanford admin
istration," Phillips said. "I was
outraged but not surprised" by the
police actions, he said, claiming that
Stanford police are "notorious for
harrassing black people."
"The Stanford administration
bears ultimate responsibility" for
Friday's events, Phillips said.
"In recent weeks the University

has gone on the offensive" against
blacks, Phillips said. "If they applied
the Sullivan principles to them
selves, they would not pass."
The BSU is demanding that all
charges be dropped against Perkins
and has called for the resignation of
Stanford Police Sgt. Nick Brunot
and Sgt. Arthur Kirts of the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Office.
Senior Marvin Jackson, a mem
ber of both Stanford Out of South
Africa and the BSU, told the crowd
that Perkins was "manhandled by
the police, and we have witnesses
to prove it."
Melanie Wiltz, president of the
black sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha,
said it is "painfully obvious that the
only crime of Robby Perkins was
the crime of being black."
Wiltz urged those at the demon
stration to write Kennedy, asking
the University to drop the charges
against Perkins.
Phillips called yesterday's rally
"one of the greatest demonstra
tions of black unity in the history of
this university," adding that the
black community has "always come
together (at critical times) and
proven we are one big family."
Emeritus Anthropology Prof. St.
Claire Drake, former director of
the African and Afro-American
Studies Program, told the crowd
that "you should present a united
front against police brutality against
students who choose this form of
protest."

During the rally, leaders of the
Black Student Union (BSU) met
with Kennedy, Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington and Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons.
According to senior Steve Phil
lips, chairman of the BSU, "not a
whole lot happened" during the
meeting, although he said Lyons
told the group that the University
would pay for the medical treat
ment Perkins required after he was
released from jail.
Perkins was treated for bruises
and other injuries he said he suf
fered at the hands of police officers.
Herrington has said his officers did
not use unnecessary force while
making arrests Friday, and a
spokesman for the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Office has said that
Perkins was restrained and strip
searched because he refused to
cooperate with police and kicked
deputies at the North County Jail in
Palo Alto.
According to Phillips, Kennedy
said he needs a complete report
from the police before an examina

tion of the incident can take place.
During the rally, police arrested
Jack Testy for possession of a dan
gerous weapon, according to Stan
ford Police Detective John McMul
len.
McMullen said Testy was taken
to North County Jail in Palo Alto
and booked there.
University spokesman Bob
Beyers said Testy had bullets in a
belt buckle and a knife under his
coat.
Rev. Byron Bland of the United
Campus Christian Ministry said
Testy made racial slurs and pushed
him as Testy moved toward
Perkins as he spoke to the crowd.
Testy's connection to Stanford, if
any, was not known last night.
McMullen said three plainclothes
officers were at the rally and that
police made an audio tape of the
proceedings for their records.
McMullen said the rally "seemed
pretty quiet. There were no prob
lems."
At yesterday's rally, Perkins,
who is black, told the racially mixed
crowd that he is "pursuing this
(brutality) thing all the way to the
courts." Perkins has said that his al
leged mistreatment was motivated
by his race.
"I've got the evidence and think I
can prove it in court,"he said.
Perkins said that he plans to file
charges against police next week,

At yesterday's BSU rally in the Quad, Robby Perkins
demonstrates to a crowd of more than 200 students how police
twisted his arm. Perkins charged that he was beaten by police
at North County Jail. Police have denied his accusation
although he could not specify
against which police department.
"I've got to think back to the
names and faces," he said. "They
were all affiliated with Santa Clara
County."
Perkins was charged with
trespassing, unlawful assembly,
refusal to disperse from an unlaw
ful assembly, remaining at the
scene of a riot after a warning to
disperse and resisting arrest during
a protest Friday against University
investments in companies doing
business in South Africa. Eight
other students were also arrested.
"I try to live my life as though I
am always on the witness stand
. . . 1 wish others would do the
same," Perkins said.
"I don't want my money invested
(in South Africa), and that's why I
walked into Old Union Friday," he
said. " I wanted to be arrested, but
not beaten."
Perkins said he "felt like an
animal" after the arrest.
"The Stanford police force is the
armed wing of the Stanford admin
istration," Phillips said. "I was
outraged but not surprised" by the
police actions, he said, claiming that
Stanford police are "notorious for
harrassing black people."
"The Stanford administration
bears ultimate responsibility" for
Friday's events, Phillips said.
"In recent weeks the University

has gone on the offensive" against
blacks, Phillips said. "If they applied
the Sullivan principles to them
selves, they would not pass."
The BSU is demanding that all
charges be dropped against Perkins
and has called for the resignation of
Stanford Police Sgt. Nick Brunot
and Sgt. Arthur Kirts of the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Office.
Senior Marvin Jackson, a mem
ber of both Stanford Out of South
Africa and the BSU, told the crowd
that Perkins was "manhandled by
the police, and we have witnesses
to prove it."
Melanie Wiltz, president of the
black sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha,
said it is "painfully obvious that the
only crime of Robby Perkins was
the crime of being black."
Wiltz urged those at the demon
stration to write Kennedy, asking
the University to drop the charges
against Perkins.
Phillips called yesterday's rally
"one of the greatest demonstra
tions of black unity in the history of
this university," adding that the
black community has "always come
together (at critical times) and
proven we are one big family."
Emeritus Anthropology Prof. St.
Claire Drake, former director of
the African and Afro-American
Studies Program, told the crowd
that "you should present a united
front against police brutality against
students who choose this form of
protest."
More than 200 students gathered
in front of University President
Donald Kennedy's office yesterday,
protesting alleged police brutality in
Friday's arrest of Stanford senior
Robby Perkins during a sit-in at Old
