# Students Asked To Jump on Bandwagon
## 
### CHRIS MYERS 
Perhaps you've always wanted to
travel to exotic places. Like, for ex
ample, the Band Shak.
Perhaps you've always wanted to
meet exotic people. Like, for exam
ple, the Dollies.
Perhaps you've always wondered
what it would be like to be a mem
ber of the Stanford Band for a day.
Don't worry, it's only for a day, not
long enough for them to warp your
moral fiber or anything like that.
This season, the Band, aiming to
attract some fresh blood, has intro
duced two new twists to its activi
ties.
One new program is going by the
name "Ringer of the Week." For
each home football game, a student
who isn't necessarily musical or
connected in any way with the Band
will join the group for a week of
rehearsals and the pregame and
halftime shows at the game. The
only requirements are enthusiasm
and a novel idea for a something re
sembling a musical instrument. You
might, for example, play a beer keg
as a drum.

For the more adventurous, the
position of guest announcer awaits.
One lucky and talented student will
be chosen to replace regular Band
announcer Hal Mickelson and
narrate the Band's shows at the
Oregon State game on Nov. 9.
The rationale behind these new
a f ivities is simple, according to as
sistant Band manager Jeff Stevens.
"We just want to get more stu
dents involved in the Band,"
Stevens explained. "We're a lot of
fun, and a lot of people want to be
part of us. We don't want to dis
criminate against people who can't
play an instrument."
The "Ringer of the Week" is also
a nod to the Band's past. "We want
to bring back a certain element of
the '70s, when there were ringers
galore," said Band manager Scott
Gode.
The number of ringers will be
closely restricted now, though, be
cause those "ringers galore" even
tually became a problem for the
Band in the '70s. "It got to the point
where the crowd was watching the
Band, and the Band members were
watching the ringers," explained
Gode."People forgot to think about

how they were playing." The sys
tem of ringers was curbed and then
eliminated a few years ago.
The first of the new ringers ap
peared in Saturday's game against
UCLA. Sophomores Mark Beyreis
and Bobby Arnsdorf appeared as
tandem ringers, with Beyreis
playing "beer can chimes" that
were swinging from the antlers of a
mounted deer, which was strapped
to Arnsdorf s back.
"It was great fun," said Arnsdorf.
"We usually got one of two com
ments, either 'Nice idea' or 'Stay
clear.' "
"Some of the UCLA fans outside
the stadium just pointed right at us,
really rude, not even bent arm,"
said Beyreis. "But the thing that
was key was the way the Band
reacted to us, the way they ac
cepted us. One time, I hit a can too
hard, and it went flying off the
antlers. I was about to hit it on the
ground when one of the band mem
bers came running over, picked up
the can and bit it."
The two ringers got a special and
unusual taste of life in the Band. As
Beyreis commented, "It struck me
that we were out there, having

never taken a music lesson, playing
beer cans in a major university
band."
Arnsdorf and Beyreis confessec
surprise at the amount of work thai
went into the Band's shows.
"We were amazed at the practice
time," said Arnsdorf. "1 don't think
people realize how much practice
goes into it."
The guest announcer stint prom
ises to be less strenuous. While
there are no specific requirements
for the announcing job, the person
selected "has to be able to write a
certain amount of his or her own
material," according to (iode.
"We'd also like someone wlu
knows the Band, knows its style
and will appeal to both the student
body and the alumni. There's a fine
line there," he said.
There is some thought among
the Band management that this
guest announcership might lead to a
more long-term student position or
perhaps an "apprenticeship." But
Band members say they are in no
hurry to oustMickelson, a Palo Alto
lawyer who has narrated the Band's
programs since he was a Stanford
junior in 1969.

There is some thought among
the Band management that this
guest announcership might lead to a
more long-term student position or
perhaps an "apprenticeship." But
Band members say they are in no
hurry to oustMickelson, a Palo Alto
lawyer who has narrated the Band's
programs since he was a Stanford
junior in 1969.
Perhaps you've always wanted to
travel to exotic places. Like, for ex
ample, the Band Shak.
Perhaps you've always wanted to
meet exotic people. Like, for exam
ple, the Dollies.
Perhaps you've always wondered
what it would be like to be a mem
ber of the Stanford Band for a day.
Don't worry, it's only for a day, not
long enough for them to warp your
moral fiber or anything like that.
This season, the Band, aiming to
attract some fresh blood, has intro
duced two new twists to its activi
ties.
One new program is going by the
name "Ringer of the Week." For
each home football game, a student
who isn't necessarily musical or
connected in any way with the Band
will join the group for a week of
rehearsals and the pregame and
halftime shows at the game. The
only requirements are enthusiasm
and a novel idea for a something re
sembling a musical instrument. You
might, for example, play a beer keg
as a drum.

For the more adventurous, the
position of guest announcer awaits.
One lucky and talented student will
be chosen to replace regular Band
announcer Hal Mickelson and
narrate the Band's shows at the
Oregon State game on Nov. 9.
The rationale behind these new
a f ivities is simple, according to as
sistant Band manager Jeff Stevens.
"We just want to get more stu
dents involved in the Band,"
Stevens explained. "We're a lot of
fun, and a lot of people want to be
part of us. We don't want to dis
criminate against people who can't
play an instrument."
The "Ringer of the Week" is also
a nod to the Band's past. "We want
to bring back a certain element of
the '70s, when there were ringers
galore," said Band manager Scott
Gode.
The number of ringers will be
closely restricted now, though, be
cause those "ringers galore" even
tually became a problem for the
Band in the '70s. "It got to the point
where the crowd was watching the
Band, and the Band members were
watching the ringers," explained
Gode."People forgot to think about

how they were playing." The sys
tem of ringers was curbed and then
eliminated a few years ago.
The first of the new ringers ap
peared in Saturday's game against
UCLA. Sophomores Mark Beyreis
and Bobby Arnsdorf appeared as
tandem ringers, with Beyreis
playing "beer can chimes" that
were swinging from the antlers of a
mounted deer, which was strapped
to Arnsdorf s back.
"It was great fun," said Arnsdorf.
"We usually got one of two com
ments, either 'Nice idea' or 'Stay
clear.' "
"Some of the UCLA fans outside
the stadium just pointed right at us,
really rude, not even bent arm,"
said Beyreis. "But the thing that
was key was the way the Band
reacted to us, the way they ac
cepted us. One time, I hit a can too
hard, and it went flying off the
antlers. I was about to hit it on the
ground when one of the band mem
bers came running over, picked up
the can and bit it."
The two ringers got a special and
unusual taste of life in the Band. As
Beyreis commented, "It struck me
that we were out there, having

never taken a music lesson, playing
beer cans in a major university
band."
Arnsdorf and Beyreis confessec
surprise at the amount of work thai
went into the Band's shows.
"We were amazed at the practice
time," said Arnsdorf. "1 don't think
people realize how much practice
goes into it."
The guest announcer stint prom
ises to be less strenuous. While
there are no specific requirements
for the announcing job, the person
selected "has to be able to write a
certain amount of his or her own
material," according to (iode.
"We'd also like someone wlu
knows the Band, knows its style
and will appeal to both the student
body and the alumni. There's a fine
line there," he said.
