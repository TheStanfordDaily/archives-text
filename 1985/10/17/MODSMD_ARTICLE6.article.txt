# Columbia's decision to divest
## Opinions Differ on Activism Impact 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Despite claims yesterday by Columbia Univer
sity spokespersons that the school's recent
move to divest of its South Africa-related stocks
had nothing to do with the escalation of stu
dent activism on campus, protesters maintain
their efforts had a "great impact" on the deci
sion.
The Columbia board of trustees voted Oct. 7
to divest of stock held in companies doing busi
ness in South Africa. The school, which became
the first Ivy League school to divest, plans to
withdraw its $39 million in South Africa-related
stock over a two-year period.
"We've had a policy of selective divestment
since 1978, long before student activism," said
Columbia spokesperson Ken Branson.
He said that during the height of student anti
apartheid protests at Columbia, which cul

minated in a blockade of Hamilton Hall last
spring, the trustees "had rejected initial
proposals to divest from companies doing busi
ness in South Africa."
Branson said that "the prime motivating fac
tor" behind the decision was recent events in
South Africa.
Public affairs spokesperson Judith Leynse
echoed Branson's remarks yesterday, saying
that the decision of the trustees would have been
identical with or without student protests.
A Columbia University release dated Oct. 7
states that the decision to divest was related to
"recent developments in South Africa. ... We
are expressing our abhorrence of apartheid and
South Africa's obdurate adherence to it."
"The trustees have taken a role in opposing
apartheid independent of student activism,"
Leynse said.
Columbia student David Goldiner, however,
said yesterday that student protests had "a great
impact" on the trustees.

Goldiner, a member of the steering committee
of the Coalition for a Free South Africa, insisted
that "universities are finding it's not worth their
while to fight students."
Goldiner said the administration at Columbia
had "taken enough embarrassment. They said
right until the end of August that it would be
'washing our hands\to get out of South Africa,
and then right before school began again they
changed their minds."
Columbia Sociology Prof. Eric Hirsch, who
joined the university's Faculty Committee
Against Apartheid after the Hamilton Hall inci
dent, said yesterday that he "doesn't believe"
Columbia's stance concerning the efficacy of stu
dent protest.
"Their (the students') actions had tremendous
impact. It's no accident that the trustees made
the decision days before classes began. They
delayed several months to save face," Hirsch
said.
