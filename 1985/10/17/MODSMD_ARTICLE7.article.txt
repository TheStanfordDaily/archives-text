### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
The primary author of "Stanford
and South Africa," the controversial
University booklet that provides
background information on apart
heid and possible responses to it,
denied charges yesterday that the
publication is biased in its portrayal
of South Africa and the divestment
issue.
"The purpose (of the booklet]
was to provide a brief background,"
said Diana Diamond, who is an as

sistant to the University's vice
president for public affairs. "We
tried to be as fair as we could. We
were just trying to get some facts
together."
Panelists at an African and Afro-
American Studies-sponsored dis
cussion Tuesday charged that the
booklet contained factual inac
curacies, errors of omission, exclu
sion of expert opinion and biased
assumptions.
Diamond countered that in
researching the booklet she used
numerous encyclopedias, almanacs
and scholarly publications. "We

tried to verify facts in at least three
primary sources," she said.
Referring to charges that the
University failed to utilize its own
experts on Africa, Diamond said,
"We have no precedent for putting
out a booklet like this. We felt that
for this brief account, it wasn't ne
cessary to consult with faculty. I
was simply asked to write it."
Diamond also cited time con
straints. "We put together the
booklet in a week and a half. We
were trying to get it ready in time
for the registration packet. We
wanted to get it to students as soon

as possible," she said.
"There was a feeling that the en
tering freshmen may not [have
been] familiar with the terms
related to the South Africa issue,
and we felt the booklet would be a
good way to educate them," Dia
mond said. "There is a section on
definitions, for example. We consid
ered the booklet to be an educa
tional tool."
Diamond also said that the Uni
versity did not expect the booklet
to turn into an issue. "I think the
real issue is apartheid and the hor
rible things that happen," she said.
