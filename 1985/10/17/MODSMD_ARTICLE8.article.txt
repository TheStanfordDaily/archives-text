# Law May Increase Organ Donations
## 
### KELLY SUND 
A new state law that will re
quire all hospitals to ask the
families of deceased patients for
organ donations may increase
the number of donated organs at
the Stanford Medical Center, ac
cording to the director of Stan
ford's heart-lung transplant pro
gram.
Under the law, when a patient
dies, the hospital will be required
to inform the family of the pa
tient about the option of donating
organs. Hospital personnel will
be required to ask the family if
the patient wished to be an organ
donor or if the family wishes to
donate the patient's organs.
When organs are donated, hospi
tals then will be required to
cooperate in sending them to a
transplant center.
Stuart Jamieson, the director
of Stanford's heart-lung
transplant program, said he
believes that "ultimately, we will
get many more donors" as a
result of the law.
Approximately 50 .heart
transplants and 10 heart-lung
transplants take place each year
at the Stanford Medical Center,
which runs the world's largest
heart and heart-lung transplant
programs.
At any given time, six to 10
patients in the heart program are
waiting for an organ donation,

and 15 to 20 are waiting for the
combined heart-lung donation. In
the last year, three patients have
died while waiting for a heart
lung transplant.
The shortage of transplant or
gans has limited the number of
people Stanford has accepted as
potential transplant candidates.
"We have a number who die
before they even get out here,"
said Marguerite Brown, the
donor procurement coordinator.
Under the new law, hospitals
will be required to "develop
protocols for identifying potential
organ and tissue donors."
Brown said she believes medi
cal personnel in intensive care
units will work to identify and
screen potential organ donors
from among the patients in their
care.
Jamieson stressed the impor
tance of the new law in educating
the public about the feasibility of
transplants. Although he said he
feels that the "public perception
of transplantation has changed"
to where transplants have
become "almost a way of life,"
he said that few people know
how beneficial transplants really
are.
A Stanford heart transplant
patient, for instance, has a 70
percent chance of being alive and
in good health four years after
the procedure, according to
Jamieson.
