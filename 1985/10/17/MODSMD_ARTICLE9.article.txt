## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper USW Forum Needed 
### 
Strike.
Like it or not, members of United Stanford
Workers voted Tuesday to walk off their jobs Oct.
25 unless the University makes what the union con
siders an acceptable contract offer before then.
Whether a strike can be avoided is still up in the air,
but one thing is certain: The outcome of the current
round of bargaining will have a direct impact on the
Stanford community.
Because students have a right to know what's
going on between the University and USW, several
Stanford students recently circulated an open letter
calling on University President Donald Kennedy to
agree to a public forum in which both sides would
have a chance to outline their positions to the com
munity. Such a forum is more than a good idea —
given the threat of a strike, it is a virtual necessity.
While it is true that both sides have already had
opportunities to present unilaterally what they want
from the negotiations — the University has ad
vertised in The Daily, and USW has circulated its
own publication: "Negotiation Report: Contract
1985" — a forum would give students an opportu

nity to hear both cases side by side and form their
own opinions.
On first glance, a forum may appear to be un
necessary, because students are not involved in the
actual labor negotiations. On the contrary, the
University-USW relationship affects students every
day, most visibly during times of unrest. The Sep
tember 1982 strike was a case in point. Students
returned to find their community paralyzed. Fresh
men were in a particularly tight spot. For more than
a month, University Food Service was unavailable in
most locations. Parcel and delivery services refused
to cross picket lines, and new telephone service had
to be arranged off campus.
With possibilities like this on the horizon, the
community needs to know what's going on and
why. Unilateral statements from the University and
USW may be helpful, but they are still one-sided. A
forum could help give students an understanding of
the past, present and probable future of the
University-USW relationship. Students may not sit
at the bargaining table, but we will all have to live
with the agreements — and disagreements — of the
coming days.
