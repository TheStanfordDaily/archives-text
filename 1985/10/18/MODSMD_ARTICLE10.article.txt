# Zimbabwe Official Criticizes Reporting
## White leader says country is under control with black majority rule 
### JOYA WESLEY Senior staff writer 
Contrary to "negative" news reports,
Zimbabwe is remarkably free of ra
cial unrest, the only white member of
that country's cabinet said here yester
day.
In a meeting with members of the
Stanford African Students Association,
Jonas Christian Anderson. Zimbabwe's
minister of public service, discussed
black majority rule in his country and its
implications for current racial tensions in
South Africa. Anderson is in the United
States as part of a 30-day trip to discuss
Zimbabwe's civil service programs.
Anderson said distorted news report
ing from Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia,
has had a negative influence on predic
tions for the success of majority rule in
South Africa.
"The reporting from foreign countries
tends to be very negative," he said.
"Reporters report the abnormal. The
economy, despite being under stress, is
not operating badly."
Anderson also spoke of foreign in
volvement in the South African eco

nomy.
"I think the policy of 'constructive en
gagement' has failed, and I don't think
there's anyone in the (U.S.) State De
partment who can get up and say it has
succeeded," he said.
A barrister before the fall of
Rhodesian Prime Minister lan Smith in
1980, Anderson described some initial
reactions to black majority rule in the
newly formed Zimbabwe.
Most government officials feared the
more, because they believed it had been
unsuccessful in other African nations, he
said. He added that officials and citizens
alike feared social instability, bloodshed,
mass nationalization and victimization of
private property.
To illustrate the extent of this fear,
Anderson told the story of a farmer who
stole an airplane from the air force so
that he could lead a convoy of whites to
safety after the decisive election.
Few of these fears were realized on a
large scale, except for a relatively brief
period of confusion, he said.
"We survived that period, and we will
continue to survive," Anderson said.
