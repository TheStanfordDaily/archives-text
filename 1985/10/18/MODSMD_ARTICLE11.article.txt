## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper In Response to Terror 
### 
When 400 passengers aboard the Italian cruise
ship Achille Lauro were taken hostage by four gun
men last Monday, the world sat back and expected a
terrorist scenario that has become all too familiar in
recent months. The murder of an elderly American
man aboard the ship was reminiscent of recent un
avenged terrorist murders of Americans in El Sal
vador and Lebanon.
But last Thursday, U.S. Navy fighter planes, act
ing on direct orders from President Reagan,
shocked the world by forcing an Egyptian airliner
carrying the accused terrorists to land at an airbase
in Sicily. In that bold and bloodless move, the United
States finally had what it wanted — a chance to
bring terrorists to justice.
Even in the troubled aftermath of the Achille
Lauro incident — the release of Mohammed Abbas
Zaida, the accused ringleader of the hijacking, and
his subsequent flight from Italy — there was a
feeling of satisfaction. Four accused terrorists still
remained behind bars. Extradition proceedings
could begin.

But even though the U.S. response to the seizure
of the Achille Lauro was an apparent success, it may
be too early to rejoice. The United States has been
repeatedly frustrated in its efforts to deal with ter
rorists, who often surround themselves with inno
cent civilians or simply disappear back into their
war-torn countries when their duties are completed.
If past is prologue, future U.S. frustrations in the
battle against terrorism are probably inevitable.
All too often, the strategy of combating terrorism
by force is an attempt to solve a crucial problem by
ameliorating the symptoms rather than the basic
causes. A more constructive and reliable approach
would be for the government to make a concerted
effort to understand the political motivations of ter
rorists and to try to encourage dialogue between
and among the conflicting parties.
The Achille Lauro incident aside, promises by
U.S. officials to "bring terrorists to justice" have of
ten ended in embarrassment or even tragedy. A
really forceful response to terrorism means more
than military might. You've got to get to root of the
problem.
