## An Invitation to the President 
### 
This letter constitutes an open invitation to Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy to participate in a
public forum.
Several events related to issues which are significant
to many of us in the Stanford community prompt us to
request an opportunity to explore with you, in a public
dialogue, some basic principles of human rights on
which this University professes to operate.
The recently adopted "Human Resource Philosophy of
Stanford University" described in "Task Force
Report on Personnel Policies" states that "because the
people who work here are Stanford's resource, the

VIEWPOINT

University respects each person's worth, dignity,
capacity to contribute, and desire for personal growth
and accomplishment." This statement of philosophy
also alludes to the University's commitment to provide
employees with the opportunity "to develop skills and
grow in their careers"; to be "appreciated and
recognized for their work"; to "receive adequate and
equitable compensation"; to "have access to help in
resolving work related problems"; and to "work in a
community which reflects society's cultural and ethnic
diversity."
We are concerned at what we perceive to be serious
deviations from these University policies in recent ac
tions taken by the administration. These deviations
relate to issues involved with collective bargaining and
other negotiations with Stanford employees affiliated
with United Stanford Workers, and generally, the
means by which the University community participates
in the resolution of significant community problems.
In your recent address to incoming freshmen, you
stated that "the open discussion of a wide range of ideas

about which there are strongly held views is the es
sence of what a university community is about" and
that academic freedom "protects the rights of faculty
and staff members to differ publicly with the Univer
sity's administration on policy matters without fear of
reprisal." As Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
aptly put it,"the public forum, where various sides of
an issue are heard, discussed and often judged, is one
important means of free and open inquiry," and "for
free inquiry to prevail, the University must protect
such debate."
These statements by you and Dean Lyons make us
feel certain that you will welcome this opportunity to
explore these important issues with concerned mem
bers of the community in a public forum. A traditional
format would allow you first to present your views, fol
lowed by representatives from the Stanford commu
nity. Each side would present a rebuttal, followed by
open discussion and questions from the floor.
We realize that specific elements of the USW con
tract cannot be discussed in a public forum, but the
larger issues of human rights and University policies
should be promptly clarified, allowing your position to
be better understood by the University community.
We assume that you will agree on the urgent necessity
of such a forum, and we look forward to setting it up in
the near future so we may resolve these important
matters.
