# Respect Black Concerns
## 
### 
Last Friday, at around 8 p.m., a friend called me and
said that Robby Perkins — one of the nine people ar
rested at Old Union — had been taken to a jail in Palo
Alto and had been beaten up there. Not wanting to
jump to conclusions, I decided to wait until I could get
some confirmation of the facts. At 2 a.m., Robby
had still not been released. I went down to San Jose,
where Robby had been moved to, and met the stu
dents who had been trying to arrange bail. They had
been told it would be three more hours before Robby
was released. Ten minutes later, Robby walked in to
confirm that he had indeed been beaten.
Robby was the only black student arrested last
Friday. He was the only student strip searched, and he
was the only student beaten. The weekend watch com
mander said that Robby was separated because he was
"an obvious agitator." The officer went on to say that
Robby was judged "to have a high potential for vio
lence."

Of the approximately 500 people killed by the police
every year, 50 percent of them are black. Black people
comprise 12 percent of the U.S. population. Police offi
cers investigate their partners for wrongdoing. In
other words, if the police kill someone you know, you
have to get the police to investigate the crime. Less
than 1 percent of police killings are found to be unjusti
fiable.
In February, Patrick Lewis — a 20-year-old black
nian — was forced to lie face down on the pavement by
a San Mateo police officer. The officer straddled Lewis,
and "in the process of reholstering his gun, acciden
tally" shot Lewis in the back of the head. Over the
summer, Melvin Truss was shot five times with a .357
magnum by a San Jose policeman. The first shot blew
Truss' hand off. San Jose is where they held Robby un
til 3 a.m.
On June 13th, I flew from California to New York
City. The next day's headlines read "Harlem honor stu
dent slain." Edmund Perry was working on Wall Street
and had no criminal record. The police say Perry tried
to mug a plainclothes policeman. Perry, who later was
found to have been unarmed, was shot to death during
the struggle. The officer reached the hospital before
Perry. Perry would have been a freshman at Stanford
this year.
Last year I was walking to catch a bus on El Camino
Real at 5 a.m., and a Stanford police officer stopped
his car, got out and demanded that I show him some
identification. He told me someone had just robbed a
house. The suspect was black, in his early 20s, and 5
feet 10 inches tall. I am black, in my early 20s, and 6
feet 4 inches tall.
And yesterday, to top it all off, Victor Hill — a black
member of United Stanford Workers — was unjustly

fired from his job for allegedly cutting his supervisor's
car t;ires. Victor had a witness — a black woman —
who testified that Victor wasn't around at the time of
the crime; they fired the witness, too. And as if that
wasn't enough, they fired a part-time worker who
spent his own lunch hour attending a rally in support of
Victor.
What does each of these events have in common? All
are instances of police harrassment and brutality
against black men in their early 20s. Without question,
police brutality is a major problem in the black commu
nity. Usually the victims are poor. Then nobody really
cares. Occasionally, however, the police prove that
even middle-class, "respectable" blacks are niggers
first, and middle-class second. That's when it becomes
news. That's why the Edmund Perry case was in Time
and Newsweek and Melvin Truss wasn't.
Robby's case is about more than police brutality in
the black community — though that is certainly a lot of
it. Robby's beating reflects the attitude of the Stanford
administration toward black people. The Stanford
Police Department is the armed wing of the Stanford
administration. Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington reports to University President Donald Ken
nedy. The Stanford police are the employees of the
University, and it was those University employees who
treated the arrestees roughly on Friday. Do you think
if Robby's father were a member of the Stanford Board
of 1 rustees or a rich alumnus, Robby would have been
beaten up? But Robby was black, and Robby was
beaten.
I he brutality with which Robby was treated should
produce outrage, but not surprise. The University has
been consistently slapping black people in the face.
Hoover Fellow John Bunzel's report that attacked
theme houses was distributed to all RAs. An article at
tacking affirmative action was distributed to all RAs.
An inaccurate, misleading pamphlet on South Africa
was written — without consulting any black scholars
— and distributed to all undergraduates through the
RAs.
That is what you call Residential Miseducation.
Sad as the above facts are, they reflect the composi
tion and outlook of the administration. There are no
black deans at Stanford, and no high-level black admi
nistrators. All the administration's talk about the Sul
livan Principles is hypocritical. With such a small (non
existant?) percentage of black administrators, Stanford
itself would not pass the Sullivan Principles.
One of the most disturbing aspects of the Robby
Perkins case is the lack of concern for the gravity of
the situation. Kennedy's response that he doesn't
know how he 11 ask about Robby's case is not enough.
What will it take to get the administration to take the
beating of a black person seriously? I was going to say
that I hope it doesn't take a police killing. But that
might not even do it. After all, Kennedy has not said
anything about Edmund Perry's death.
Police brutality is an important issue. So is the ad
ministration's attitude toward black people. Whether
the administration takes these issues seriously or not
is up to them. Regardless of their choice, the issues
will not go away.

nian — was forced to lie face down on the pavement by
a San Mateo police officer. The officer straddled Lewis,
and "in the process of reholstering his gun, acciden
tally" shot Lewis in the back of the head. Over the
summer, Melvin Truss was shot five times with a .357
magnum by a San Jose policeman. The first shot blew
Truss' hand off. San Jose is where they held Robby un
til 3 a.m.
On June 13th, I flew from California to New York
City. The next day's headlines read "Harlem honor stu
dent slain." Edmund Perry was working on Wall Street
and had no criminal record. The police say Perry tried
to mug a plainclothes policeman. Perry, who later was
found to have been unarmed, was shot to death during
the struggle. The officer reached the hospital before
Perry. Perry would have been a freshman at Stanford
this year.
Last year I was walking to catch a bus on El Camino
Real at 5 a.m., and a Stanford police officer stopped
his car, got out and demanded that I show him some
identification. He told me someone had just robbed a
house. The suspect was black, in his early 20s, and 5
feet 10 inches tall. I am black, in my early 20s, and 6
feet 4 inches tall.
And yesterday, to top it all off, Victor Hill — a black
member of United Stanford Workers — was unjustly

fired from his job for allegedly cutting his supervisor's
car t;ires. Victor had a witness — a black woman —
who testified that Victor wasn't around at the time of
the crime; they fired the witness, too. And as if that
wasn't enough, they fired a part-time worker who
spent his own lunch hour attending a rally in support of
Victor.
What does each of these events have in common? All
are instances of police harrassment and brutality
against black men in their early 20s. Without question,
police brutality is a major problem in the black commu
nity. Usually the victims are poor. Then nobody really
cares. Occasionally, however, the police prove that
even middle-class, "respectable" blacks are niggers
first, and middle-class second. That's when it becomes
news. That's why the Edmund Perry case was in Time
and Newsweek and Melvin Truss wasn't.
Robby's case is about more than police brutality in
the black community — though that is certainly a lot of
it. Robby's beating reflects the attitude of the Stanford
administration toward black people. The Stanford
Police Department is the armed wing of the Stanford
administration. Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington reports to University President Donald Ken
nedy. The Stanford police are the employees of the
University, and it was those University employees who
treated the arrestees roughly on Friday. Do you think
if Robby's father were a member of the Stanford Board
of 1 rustees or a rich alumnus, Robby would have been
beaten up? But Robby was black, and Robby was
beaten.
I he brutality with which Robby was treated should
produce outrage, but not surprise. The University has
been consistently slapping black people in the face.
Hoover Fellow John Bunzel's report that attacked
theme houses was distributed to all RAs. An article at
tacking affirmative action was distributed to all RAs.
An inaccurate, misleading pamphlet on South Africa
was written — without consulting any black scholars
— and distributed to all undergraduates through the
RAs.
That is what you call Residential Miseducation.
Sad as the above facts are, they reflect the composi
tion and outlook of the administration. There are no
black deans at Stanford, and no high-level black admi
nistrators. All the administration's talk about the Sul
livan Principles is hypocritical. With such a small (non
existant?) percentage of black administrators, Stanford
itself would not pass the Sullivan Principles.
One of the most disturbing aspects of the Robby
Perkins case is the lack of concern for the gravity of
the situation. Kennedy's response that he doesn't
know how he 11 ask about Robby's case is not enough.
What will it take to get the administration to take the
beating of a black person seriously? I was going to say
that I hope it doesn't take a police killing. But that
might not even do it. After all, Kennedy has not said
anything about Edmund Perry's death.
Police brutality is an important issue. So is the ad
ministration's attitude toward black people. Whether
the administration takes these issues seriously or not
is up to them. Regardless of their choice, the issues
will not go away.

Last Friday, at around 8 p.m., a friend called me and
said that Robby Perkins — one of the nine people ar
rested at Old Union — had been taken to a jail in Palo
Alto and had been beaten up there. Not wanting to
jump to conclusions, I decided to wait until I could get
some confirmation of the facts. At 2 a.m., Robby
had still not been released. I went down to San Jose,
where Robby had been moved to, and met the stu
dents who had been trying to arrange bail. They had
been told it would be three more hours before Robby
was released. Ten minutes later, Robby walked in to
confirm that he had indeed been beaten.
Robby was the only black student arrested last
Friday. He was the only student strip searched, and he
was the only student beaten. The weekend watch com
mander said that Robby was separated because he was
"an obvious agitator." The officer went on to say that
Robby was judged "to have a high potential for vio
lence."

Of the approximately 500 people killed by the police
every year, 50 percent of them are black. Black people
comprise 12 percent of the U.S. population. Police offi
cers investigate their partners for wrongdoing. In
other words, if the police kill someone you know, you
have to get the police to investigate the crime. Less
than 1 percent of police killings are found to be unjusti
fiable.
