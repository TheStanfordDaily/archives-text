Dropping Charges
Cheapens Protest
I have no way of evaluating the
account given by David Romo of
his experiences following his arrest
for sitting in the Bursar's Office at
the Old Union. As is usual in such
situations, there are many conflict
ing accounts of what happened,
and time will be needed to sort
them out. We are determined to
address, seriously and thoroughly,
any charges that police used ex
cessive force.
One assertion made by Romo,
however, is clearly wrong. He
says that I "told the press, includ
ing Time magazine, that the
protesters engaging in civil dis
obedience just wanted to get ar
rested to be 'chic.' "What I said
was quite different. I had been
asked why we had not arrested the
protesters who blocked the mem
bers of the Stanford Board of
Trustees' cars after the board
meeting in May. In replying, I
noted that in a number of jurisdic
tions it had become possible to be
arrested, charged and released
immediately without penalty. Thus
my point was that such arrests
would not be possible here. I
believed then, and I still believe,
that symbolic arrests actually

cheapen the concept of civil dis
obedience. I went on to say that
we would make arrests only for
infractions that we regarded as
serious and that having done so,
we would expect the judicial sys
tem to treat them seriously.
That is still Stanford's policy.

The University
Isn't Bargaining
I am a graduate student at Stan
ford and a member of the United
Stanford Workers negotiation
team. As such, I have had the
opportunity to witness first hand
the current negotiations between
the University and the union. As
the possibility of a strike looms, I
would like to share my impressions
of that troubled process with the
Stanford community.
My presence throughout the
negotiations has convinced me that
the University's representatives
are refusing to bargain with even a
semblance of good faith. In particu
lar, Priscilla Wheeler, the Univer
sity's chief negotiator, has
consistently conveyed an intensely
counterproductive attitude.
One example may prove in-

formative. An initial union proposal
included a clause that would
prohibit non-bargaining unit
workers from performing jobs
normally done by bargaining unit
members. While the intent was to
restrain the University from con
tracting out large sections of bar
gaining unit work, the proposal,
in its original form, theoretically
could have interfered with the
participation of faculty members
and their students in certain
aspects of their own research. In
recognition of this possibility, the
union changed its proposal to ex
clude faculty, research staff and
students.
In the meeting of Thursday,
Sept. 5, Wheeler accused the union
of continuing to attempt to infringe
on academic freedom. When told
that the intent of the proposal was
to assure the freedom of all re
searchers at the University,
Wheeler refused to discuss the
issue any further, stated that the
union was clearly not interested in
seriously changing its position, and
walked out of the meeting as we
tried to explain our intent. As
recently as last week, Wheeler
brought up this very same issue in
a talk to students at one of the
dorms — although she did note
that the union had changed its

proposal.
The point is clear. Throughout
the negotiations, the University
negotiators have consistently
looked for small issues to release
to the press as examples of the
intransigence of the union's posi
tion. At no time have they sat
down and actually tried to work out
a fair and just settlement. I believe
that the Stanford community must
demand such good faith efforts on
the part of the University. If the
administration continues to refuse
to do so and this forces the union
out on strike, we must stand next
to the workers in demanding a fair
and just contract.
