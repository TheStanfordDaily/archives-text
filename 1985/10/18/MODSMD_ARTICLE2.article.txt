# Apartheid Debate Rages

### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
In a debate with a co-founder of
the Black Panther Party last night,
a former South African said his
homeland needs "massive" tech
nological and economic assistance
— and not U.S. divestment — if it
hopes to eliminate the unrest there.
Stuart Pringle, a 13th-generation
South African who now makes his
living producing documentaries in
the United States, said, "We do
need (the West's) help. We don't
need your divestment."
Bobby Seale, a co-founder of the
radical Black Panther Party, blasted
Pringle's assertions about the need
for Western aid in South Africa,
saying that the United States needs
to "keep the economic hammer on

the head of the Botha government"
to force it into granting blacks
concessions and eventually into
enfranchising them. F.W. Botha is
the president of South Africa.
Pringle decried what he termed
the "unspiritual" attitudes of Ameri
can students whose protests
against South Africa's apartheid
system of racial segregation are
setting back a process of gradual
improvement in the nation's condi
tions. "You really don't know what
you're doing," he said.
He went on to express his con
cern about the extent to which
American students have been
"indoctrinated" by the media into
believing that force is the only an
swer that the United States can
give to South African problems.
Pringle said that the emphasis
the United States places on fighting

communism is ironic in the face of
the divestment policy the United
States is now pursuing. He said hal
ting the spread of communism is
impossible without a "massive" ef
fort to put "electric lights on the
dark continent."
Harkening back to his involve
ment in the civil rights movement
during the '60s, Seale said that "we
blew everybody's goddamn mind"
by "defending our democratic right
to organize our people."
"If they're going to brutalize
peaceful demonstrators who were
exercising their First Amendment
rights, all that means is that when
we organize our political con
stituency, you bring your idiot
police and your dogs and everything
else down here. We got some shot
