## Road Trip Tips for Cruising On Exciting 5 
### TIM GRIEVE MARILYN WANN 
If you're planning a road trip to USC this
weekend, you'll probably spend a few hours
on Interstate 5. And if you're on the 5,
there are some aesthetically pleasing, cul
tural points of interest you won't want to
miss.
Yes, really.
This misunderstood strip of asphalt
bisects the most fertile, and also the most
boring soybean fields in the country —
about 200 miles' worth, to be almost exact.
But it doesn't have to put you to sleep.
You'll come to your first potential rest
stop — we'll call them caffeine opportuni
ties — on the 152 crossover from the
familiar 101 to the interminable 5.
This is one of the world's most cur
vaceous roads. They don't ask you to keep
your headlights on for safety, it just makes
it easier to find your car once you have
crashed.
So when you see the Casa de Fruta sign,
you'll probably be ready to take a rest, if
only to give your brakes a break.
No one ever admits to stopping at this
glorified fruit stand, which expanded to in
clude Casa de Coffee, Casa de Gas, Casa
de Burger and by now probably Casa de
Motel. You get the idea why.
Sophomore Mark Mulkerin did concede
that he stopped there once on a record

breaking six-hour jaunt down to L.A., but
only to buy hot peppers to keep himself
awake.
"You're guaranteed not to sleep for at
least half an hour," he said of the mysteri
ous green chiles with a name he couldn't re
member.
But you'd better watch yourself if you're
prone to pepper- or caffeine-induced lead
footedness on the interstate. To cop a
phrase from "Convoy," Smokey's gonna
get you.
Those black-and-white sharks of the su
perslab don't have radar in California.
(The state legislature, after hearing all
those stories about radar guns clocking
trees and family ranch homes at 45 mph,
has decided that the California Highway Pa
trol shouldn't be given that weapon.)
But — back to "Convoy" again — there
is a "bear in the air." That's right.
Smokey's got himself an airplane.
Here's how it works. Bear-in-the-air flys
parallel to the freeway, clocking cars
below. When he sees a few speeders, he
calls down to a few black-and-whites, and
— voila — you're busted.
When you see the CHP cars, you're too
late; the plane already has you. What you've
got to do is watch through your sunroof
(you do have a sunroof, don't you?) and see
Smokey before he sees you.
If you make it that far before you fall into
a bear trap, you owe it to yourself to stop in

Kettleman City. Nobody knows exactly
where it is, but it's on the way, and
everybody stops there.

Two years ago, that everybody included
the Band, and the folks at the landmark
Kettleman City McDonald's are probably
still talking about it.
Driving through the golden arches isn't
the only culinary wonder on the 5 by far.
Back at Panoche Road, which you come
to a little before this historical fast food
landmark, there's a restaurant that looks
like Big Boy's and tastes like homemade
apricot pie.
It's called the Apricot Tree Inn because it
takes advantage of the surrounding crop to
concoct some rest-stop-worthy calorie
classics. However, it's the type of place
your parents would pick for a siesta be
cause they serve "good food" there and
have "such a darling little gift shop."
Depending on whether or not you like
garlic, Gilroy can be scented heaven or
smelly hell.
No matter which opinion you hold dear to
your nose as you roll the windows up or
down, you can always say you've driven
through the nation's garlic capitol.
And whenever you eat good Italian food
in the future, you can just thank the folks in
Gilroy for living in the fumes of the garlic
factories for the sake of your lasagna.
The RV that pulls out of the Delta Kappa
Epsilon (Deke) house today will only make
one stop, according to Mike Gordon, the
trip's planner.
These road trip experts chose a gas sta

tion in Cholame, a little place six miles off
the raceway 5 rut near Paso Robles.
You win a blue Trivial Pursuit wedgie
and a USC bumper sticker if you can guess
why they would deviate to that particular
spot.
Beep. Time's up. James Dean died near
this remote stretch of Highway 46.
This frat plans to spend a minimum of
$700 tripping on the road, what with the
standard spraypainted urban assault vehi
cle, food for the actives and various other
brotherly expenses.
Your average station wagon from Na
tional Car Rental runs $85 for your average
road trip. That's a lot, but now consider
how many close friends you can pack even
more closely together in a whole station
wagon.
Now think of all the acquaintances of ac
quaintances you might know with floor
space in their USC or UCLA dorm rooms.
Unless you're into enology (that's the
study of winemaking to you and me) or you
avidly collect snapshots of blurry roadside,
there's not much left to do during the long
stretch after Kettleman City before you hit
the Grapevine.
By closely tailgating, you'll probably be
able to spy a Stanford sticker in the back
window of the car ahead of you.
They'll probably be able to guide you di
rectly to the 50-yard line, plowing out some
nice seats for you.
