## Scorsese Scores With a Macabre 'After Hours' 
### STEVE WARRICK Staff writer 
Martin Scorsese has said that he wants to get back
to a simpler style of moviemaking, one with shorter
.shooting schedules and tighter budgets. This is his rea
son for agreeing to do an episode of Spielberg's
"Amazing Stories," and for directing "After Hours," a
small-budget comedy that is clearly a step back from
.the overwrought, bloated conceptions of his last few
movies.
Scorsese claims he chose the "After Hours"
screenplay, by film student Joseph Minion, because he
could picture real people speaking Minion's lines. It's a
.relief to see real people in a Scorsese film again; "The
King of Comedy" didn't have a real human being in it.
And it's almost as much of a relief to see Scorsese
grounding his movie effects for the audience. In "After
Hours," Scorsese lets us back into his world of movies,
after shutting us out with a string of alienating
"personal" (in the worst sense) films.
I wish "After Hours" could put Scorsese right back
on top again, back to the pinnacle he reached with
"Mean Streets" and "Taxi Driver." But "After Hours"
is a minor comedy, sharply drawn and with zingy
camera work, but with a limited idea that doesn't quite
stretch out over the full running time.
The movie starts off whizzing and quickly hooks up
Paul (Griffen Dunne) and Marci (Rosanna Arquette)
•through a casual conversation in a New York cafe. He's
a staid office worker; she's a flightly Soho denizen who
.piques his interest with her suggestive kinkiness. He
goes to visit her later that night, and the movie is about
his attempts to get home. The events that keep Paul
trapped in Soho are like a semi-believable, chain
reaction nightmare; Paul gets involved with various
crazies andbecomes enmeshed in their night life. The
movie is a kind of fevered dream, and its conception
has a built-in limitation: as Paul becomes increasingly
single-minded in his attempts to escape, character de
velopment stops, and the movie becomes single
minded in its efforts to keep him on the run. The coin
cidences pile up and strain the bounds of the film's
dream-logic.
Maybe a better actor could have held our interest as
the night wears on, and Paul becomes more dis
oriented and desperate. Griffin Dunne is engaging and
athletic, and he keeps hopping, but nothing is really
revealed about his character in the course of this
movie, and Dunne doesn't suggest much depth. This
may be a fault of the screenplay, but I think Paul's am
biguity is intentional. I suspect Minion intended Paul to

be an everyman; Minion and Scorsese's mistake is in
believing that this limits them to a vaguely undefined
hero, a character that each movie-goer will fill in with
his or her personality. A better actor might give us
more to identify with. Paul needs layers of resourceful
ness and originality, but Dunne gives us the same reac
tions over and over. He is partly to blame for the grind
ing repetitiveness of the last quarter or so of the film.
Sharing the blame are the filmmakers, who are stuck
with the problem of winding up their Kafkaesque
nightmare without destroying the mood they've
created. Not even Kafka could effectively end his
stories; his paranoid fantasies were so completely
realized they were unresolvable (the paranoia had to
continue). It's clear that the filmmakers are aiming for
a modern reworking of Kafka, and they have an in
genious idea: that city life completely changes at night,
and that the "rational" responses and relationships that
work in the daytime may be inadequate in the dealings
of the night. As one character puts it, "Different rules
apply — it's after hours."
The characters in Scorsese's night city are con
nected in tricky ways that seem conspirital and per
verse, but make sense when we realize that the few
people who are around this late might naturally know
each other and probably communicate in weird ways.
It's unlikely that they would be "normal."
Kafka's skill was an ability to make the irrational
seem logical, even inevitable. Scorsese's camera work
might seem gratuitously artsy if this weren't also his
goal. This comedy needs a visual equivalent for the
bizarre details of Kafka's world and finds it in Scor
sese's restlesly tracking camera. Scorsese picks up
and locks in on curious details that don't relate directly
to the plot, but eat away at the corner of our subcon
scious. One woman has shelves of hair spray in her
apartment, another sculpts tortured papier mache
idols. I can't think of another movie where this super
fluous weirdness and Scorsese's "busy" technique
would do anything but call attention to themselves;
they're a jokey attempt to capture Kafka's disorienting
vision on film, and they mostly work. Minion and Scor
sese provide one direct reference to their inspiration.
The doorkeeper of the Club Berlin, an S & M hangout
Paul needs to get into, refuses entry, but takes Paul's
money because "I don't want you to feel that you've
left anything untried." This is an almost direct quote
from Kafka's "The Trial." Paul eventually enters and
almost gets an unwanted mohawk.
The people Paul meets are the types that might have
driven Travis Bickle nuts in "Taxi Driver." They're
mainly female, and they function as modern sexual
equivalents of Kafka's imperious bureaucracies. They

don't spring from Paul's personal sexual hangups; the
filmmakers try to include everyone's sexual hangups.
These characters are aggressive, passive, kinky, neu
rotic, suicidal, and combinations of all. The best of the
actors — notably Linda Fiorentino and Teri Garr
(playing an almost-parody of every role she's ever
done) — manage to be intimidating and accessible at
the same time. They're Paul's only anchors in this
dream world until they turn on him, and start stalking
him. Arquette doesn't quite deliver as the femme fatale
who sucks Paul into the whole mess. She plays her role
a little too distantly; she needs more of a surface nor
malcy that might draw a semi-square like Paul into this
madness. Her character needs a contrast between her
daytime persona and what she becomes at night.
In later scenes the movie becomes more unevenly

effective in balancing its believablity and insanity. A
segment in a bar where the bartender Qohn Heard)
breaks down over his girlfriend's suicide is beautifully
done; a later scene where Paul breaks down to a
woman in the Club Berlin is labored. (This may be a dif
ference between the skill of the actors.) And the
filmmakers wrap up their night on the town with a coin
cidence that almost shatters the mood, which becomes
strained in the last 20 minutes. They need something
that ties the entire craziness up into a unified whole;
something that confirms our worst suspicions about
sexuality and relationships and the maliciousness of
fate. It's a tall order. Kafka never completely came
through on the promise of his worst paranoias.
Likewise, Scorsese and Minion keep our suspicions
about the characters just suspicions.

nected in tricky ways that seem conspirital and per
verse, but make sense when we realize that the few
people who are around this late might naturally know
each other and probably communicate in weird ways.
It's unlikely that they would be "normal."
Kafka's skill was an ability to make the irrational
seem logical, even inevitable. Scorsese's camera work
might seem gratuitously artsy if this weren't also his
goal. This comedy needs a visual equivalent for the
bizarre details of Kafka's world and finds it in Scor
sese's restlesly tracking camera. Scorsese picks up
and locks in on curious details that don't relate directly
to the plot, but eat away at the corner of our subcon
scious. One woman has shelves of hair spray in her
apartment, another sculpts tortured papier mache
idols. I can't think of another movie where this super
fluous weirdness and Scorsese's "busy" technique
would do anything but call attention to themselves;
they're a jokey attempt to capture Kafka's disorienting
vision on film, and they mostly work. Minion and Scor
sese provide one direct reference to their inspiration.
The doorkeeper of the Club Berlin, an S & M hangout
Paul needs to get into, refuses entry, but takes Paul's
money because "I don't want you to feel that you've
left anything untried." This is an almost direct quote
from Kafka's "The Trial." Paul eventually enters and
almost gets an unwanted mohawk.
The people Paul meets are the types that might have
driven Travis Bickle nuts in "Taxi Driver." They're
mainly female, and they function as modern sexual
equivalents of Kafka's imperious bureaucracies. They

don't spring from Paul's personal sexual hangups; the
filmmakers try to include everyone's sexual hangups.
These characters are aggressive, passive, kinky, neu
rotic, suicidal, and combinations of all. The best of the
actors — notably Linda Fiorentino and Teri Garr
(playing an almost-parody of every role she's ever
done) — manage to be intimidating and accessible at
the same time. They're Paul's only anchors in this
dream world until they turn on him, and start stalking
him. Arquette doesn't quite deliver as the femme fatale
who sucks Paul into the whole mess. She plays her role
a little too distantly; she needs more of a surface nor
malcy that might draw a semi-square like Paul into this
madness. Her character needs a contrast between her
daytime persona and what she becomes at night.
In later scenes the movie becomes more unevenly

effective in balancing its believablity and insanity. A
segment in a bar where the bartender Qohn Heard)
breaks down over his girlfriend's suicide is beautifully
done; a later scene where Paul breaks down to a
woman in the Club Berlin is labored. (This may be a dif
ference between the skill of the actors.) And the
filmmakers wrap up their night on the town with a coin
cidence that almost shatters the mood, which becomes
strained in the last 20 minutes. They need something
that ties the entire craziness up into a unified whole;
something that confirms our worst suspicions about
sexuality and relationships and the maliciousness of
fate. It's a tall order. Kafka never completely came
through on the promise of his worst paranoias.
Likewise, Scorsese and Minion keep our suspicions
about the characters just suspicions.


Griffen Dunne as Paul and Rosanna Arquette as Marci, the woman who infatuates him through
out the bizarre and Kafkaesque journey of Martin Scorsese's "After Hours."
Martin Scorsese has said that he wants to get back
to a simpler style of moviemaking, one with shorter
.shooting schedules and tighter budgets. This is his rea
son for agreeing to do an episode of Spielberg's
"Amazing Stories," and for directing "After Hours," a
small-budget comedy that is clearly a step back from
.the overwrought, bloated conceptions of his last few
movies.
Scorsese claims he chose the "After Hours"
screenplay, by film student Joseph Minion, because he
could picture real people speaking Minion's lines. It's a
.relief to see real people in a Scorsese film again; "The
King of Comedy" didn't have a real human being in it.
And it's almost as much of a relief to see Scorsese
grounding his movie effects for the audience. In "After
Hours," Scorsese lets us back into his world of movies,
after shutting us out with a string of alienating
"personal" (in the worst sense) films.
I wish "After Hours" could put Scorsese right back
on top again, back to the pinnacle he reached with
"Mean Streets" and "Taxi Driver." But "After Hours"
is a minor comedy, sharply drawn and with zingy
camera work, but with a limited idea that doesn't quite
stretch out over the full running time.
The movie starts off whizzing and quickly hooks up
Paul (Griffen Dunne) and Marci (Rosanna Arquette)
•through a casual conversation in a New York cafe. He's
a staid office worker; she's a flightly Soho denizen who
.piques his interest with her suggestive kinkiness. He
goes to visit her later that night, and the movie is about
his attempts to get home. The events that keep Paul
trapped in Soho are like a semi-believable, chain
reaction nightmare; Paul gets involved with various
crazies andbecomes enmeshed in their night life. The
movie is a kind of fevered dream, and its conception
has a built-in limitation: as Paul becomes increasingly
single-minded in his attempts to escape, character de
velopment stops, and the movie becomes single
minded in its efforts to keep him on the run. The coin
cidences pile up and strain the bounds of the film's
dream-logic.
Maybe a better actor could have held our interest as
the night wears on, and Paul becomes more dis
oriented and desperate. Griffin Dunne is engaging and
athletic, and he keeps hopping, but nothing is really
revealed about his character in the course of this
movie, and Dunne doesn't suggest much depth. This
may be a fault of the screenplay, but I think Paul's am
biguity is intentional. I suspect Minion intended Paul to

be an everyman; Minion and Scorsese's mistake is in
believing that this limits them to a vaguely undefined
hero, a character that each movie-goer will fill in with
his or her personality. A better actor might give us
more to identify with. Paul needs layers of resourceful
ness and originality, but Dunne gives us the same reac
tions over and over. He is partly to blame for the grind
ing repetitiveness of the last quarter or so of the film.
Sharing the blame are the filmmakers, who are stuck
with the problem of winding up their Kafkaesque
nightmare without destroying the mood they've
created. Not even Kafka could effectively end his
stories; his paranoid fantasies were so completely
realized they were unresolvable (the paranoia had to
continue). It's clear that the filmmakers are aiming for
a modern reworking of Kafka, and they have an in
genious idea: that city life completely changes at night,
and that the "rational" responses and relationships that
work in the daytime may be inadequate in the dealings
of the night. As one character puts it, "Different rules
apply — it's after hours."
