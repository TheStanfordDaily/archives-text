# Dario Fo's New Political Farce Hits U.S.
## 
### PETER MORGAN 
Last Wednesday the Eureka Theatre opened its '85-
'86 season with "About Face," a political farce about
terrorism written by Italy's leading playwright, Dario
Fo.
"About Face" is the newest play from the pen of Fo,
renowned in Europe for leftist farces about modern
Italy. Because of his politics, Fo has been denied
permission to work in America, and his popularity has
suffered accordingly.
The play revolves around the classic comic device of
mistaken identity. Italy's leading millionaire and
staunchest capitalist is given a new face through plastic
surgery after being injured in an unsuccessful kidnap
ping attempt by leftist terrorists. His new face is not
his own, however, but that of one of his factory
workers seen at the scene of the kidnapping and
suspected of being a terrorist. So everyone thinks the
capitalist is one of the terrorists and, with the wrong
face, he has no way of proving who he really is.
This premise and some well-timed plot devices lead
to hilarious comic situations between the factory
worker/tycoon (a double role played by Joe Bellan) and
his confused ex-wife Rosa. The play resolves itself
when the tycoon explains his motives for remaining in
cognito while the worker has been arrested; he has
been manipulating the terrorist scandal through
hostage letters to the police. His reason? He hopes the
terrorist episode will give the government (which he
controls economically) an excuse for a reactionary
backlash against civil liberties and workers' rights.
One should not be deceived, however. The domi
nant tone of all but the last 10 minutes of this play is
wild and farcical. It is very funny, and the Eureka pro
duction pulls off the comedy admirably. The two leads
are outstanding with their relaxed confidence and cocki
ness creating the Italian equivalent of "The
Honeymooners." There are plenty of gags. I particu
larly enjoyed the stagehand running on and off with a
window frame whenever someone needed to look
outside. One-liners also abound: "He was a total shit,
but a good Catholic."
But Fo is asking the audience to do more than laugh,

and this is where things went awry for both the script
and production. It is not that Fo's political statement
isn't relevant or thought-provoking. The idea of "a con

spiracy behind the conspiracy" is a simple but logical
one that appeals to left-wing revolutionaries and plain
old anti-CIA liberals alike .

The problem is one I didn't expect from Fo: shoddy
construction. "About Face" has the necessary ingredi
ents of an effective political farce. But the elements al
ways remain separate; you are either laughing at out
rageous, physical comedy or being lectured about in
sidious, capitalist plots. The ending, for example, is a
quick and lazy tying up of the plot followed by a lengthy
and fanatical speech by the tycoon about power and
economics.
Now don't get me wrong, the comedy is masterfully
written by Fo and hilariously produced by the Eureka
cast. The political statement, however, is heavy
handed in its didacticism and sticks out glaringly be
tween the smooth comic scenes. It may be a valid poli
tical statement, but I felt like it was an arbitrary one
because of its independence from the comedy. Just as
easily, it could have been President Reagan denounc
ing the Soviet "empire of evil." The comedy wouldn't
have been touched in the least, and the effect would
have been the same â€” propaganda promotion.
Dramatically, this is a mistake. Pure propaganda is
too easily dismissed by "unbelievers," and in America
Fo's brand of politics is going to have a lot of skeptics.
So, another strike against Fo making it big in America.
There is a point in his favor though; his brand of
theater, and political theater in general, is sorely lack
ing in the happy and secure United States. If I had not
seen "About Face," I would never have perked up and
read all the articles about the U.S. retaliation on the
hijackers.
Strangely enough, I could only think of the tycoon's
comments about the present-day fear of terrorism:
"You always hear about these international terrorist
organizations and underground conspiracies to over
throw the world. I see Shultz on "Nightline," and he
says it. But do you always notice how they get their
evidence and information about these terrorists from
unidentified intelligence sources? Ever notice how they
can never name any names? Well, guess why?"
"About Face" doesn't really deal with these issues.
It's just a funny play with some propaganda dumped
carelessly into it. But it kept politics in my head and in
the heads of others. I wish this kind of theater wasn't
so rare.


Joe Bellan plays a mobster who undergoes a face-change operation that causes nothing but
trouble in Dario Fo's political farce, "About Face." This newest play by the leftist Italian playwright
will be at the Eureka Theatre through Nov. 17.
