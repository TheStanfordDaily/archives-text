# 'Gypsy': Nothing Bad, But Nothing Special
## 
### GEOFFREY MINTER 
In "Funny Girl," someone tells
title character Fanny Brice,
"Everything you've got's about
right, but the damned thing don't
come out right." The same can be
said for the Palo Alto Players and
their new production of "Gypsy."
The show's good, but it isn't too
terribly exciting.
The energy was so low last
Thursday that one might have gotten
the impression the show was en
tering its second year and not its
second week. The audience
clapped at all the appropriate mo
ments, but never with a lot of en
thusiasm. Like the show it was
watching, the audience just seemed
to be going through the motions.
"Gypsy," which originally opened
about two decades ago, is a
"musical fable" based on the life of
star-stripper Gypsy Rose Lee.
Gypsy, who's known by her real
name, Louise, throughout most of
the show, and her sister, June, go
into show business at an early age,
prodded along by their mother,
Rose. Rose is obsessed with
making her children stars, and
"Gypsy" ultimately boils down to an
examination of Rose's "state moth
ering" and how it adversely affects
the family. To a lesser extent,
"Gypsy" is about Louise's growth
from child to woman.
Arthur Laurents, who wrote the
original book for the show, said in
an interview that he and the other
"Gypsy" creators faced a dilemma:
how to write a show about a strip
per that would appeal to a family au
dience. Their solution was simple:
they would make their musical the
story of the stripper's family and
wouldn't say anything about her
profession until the end. They
would also make sure that Gypsy's
family situation spoke to the prob
lems faced by all families, especially
those not involved with some

aspect of performance.
"Gypsy" is really two shows: one
that deals with the family's rise in
show business and one that deals
with family problems (sibling
rivalry, over-protective mothers,
and so on) that aren't necessarily
involved with show business. The
first show is a pretty splashy one,
with dancing girls and vaudevillians
of all shapes and sizes. The second
show is more human, with people
sitting down and airing (or not
airing) their problems to one an
other.
The Players do a better job with
the first "Gypsy" than with the
second one, which is good. Unfor
tunately, the splashy elements of
the show appear more frequently
than the human ones (you have to
remember the show was originally
written with Ethel Merman in
mind), and since the Players aren't
usually too strong when it comes to
splash, there are a lot of lull periods
in the production.
It's nobody's fault really. Well,
maybe it's the producer's. The
Piayers hold all their productions in
the Palo Alto Community Theatre,
a large enough building that is
cursed with a very bad sound sys
tem. The big numbers didn't
receive tumultous audience reac
tion because hardly anyone could
hear them. The orchestra was per
fect (even though the brass section
got a little wild at times), but too
loud. "Mr. Goldstone," one of the
funniest and most energetic num
bers in the show, is lost. The lyrics
are funny, but you can't hear them.
A new sound system would greatly
enhance enjoyment of this and
future shows at the Community
Theatre.
The sound wasn't that great in
the big production numbers, and
the sight usually wasn't, either.
The sets were simple to the point
of minimalism and were painted
with dark hues you would expect to
see in a production of "Hamlet."

The choreography was for the most
part uninspiring, but the dancers
were in sync, which is all anyone
can really ask. '
The rare exception to the big
production rule was the "You Gotta
Have a Gimmick" number, which
was actually pretty exciting. In it,
three strippers tell Louise how to
make it in the stripper trade while
popping their bellies and crotches
to the music. Kirstin Alleman as
stripper Tessie Tura is a delight.
She demands attention the minute
she walks on stage, and her
brassy/hoarse voice surrounds the
theater whenever she utters a line.
She also dances well with peacock
feathers.
The show really gets good be
tween numbers, however, when
people sit down and talk or sit
down and sing without loud or
chestrations.
As played by Toni Tomei, Rose
is a determined stage mother who
realizes her faults early on, but
can't do anything to change them.
Tomei can be sincere when she
needs to be, but can also bring up
the gusto (unfortunately, in the
songs — "Some People,"
"Everything's Coming Up Roses"
and "Rose's Turn" — Tomei is
overwhelmed by the orchestra, and
the emotional effect of these songs
is severely lessened. Instead of
feeling energized, the audience
claps politely). Her best scenes are
those with William Bell, who plays
Louise and June's agent, Herbie.
The scenes with the songs "Small
World" and "You'll Never Get Away
From Me" are the warmest in the
show; Tomei and Bell have good
romantic chemistry.
Kerry Cauterucci and Zoe
Alexandra, who play Louise and
June, respectively, are the only
serious casting faux pas. June is
supposed to be a very talented per
son, but something is lost in
Alexandra's interpretation of the
role. She has no pizzaz as a per

former. And when Louise makes
her transformation from over
mothered-child to woman, the only
thing that really changes is her
costume and the way she talks. The
transformation is only external; the
woman in the costume is still the
same. This isn't soley Cauterucci's
fault. The transformation sequence

seems somewhat tacked on to the
script, but she could have done
something beyond changing her
voice to get the message across.
She seems repressed and mother
pecked, before becoming a stripper
and after; the script says Louise
changes, but Cauterucci's perfor
mance does nothing to suggest this.

"Gypsy" is a fairly good show
despite its faults, but it's nothing to
get too excited about. The Palo
Alto Players should have better
luck with their next show, Beth
Henley's "Crimes of the Heart," a
play that comes without any big
production numbers to worry
about.
