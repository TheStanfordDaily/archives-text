## Dining at Liaison: Culinary Romance

For two overworked people in bad moods, Liaison provided a delightful
panacea.
Welcomed by the unassuming hostess Josephine, we were shown to our
candlelit corner and left to ease into the elegant and cozy surroundings.
We warmed instantly.
Liaison has little interest in pretence or glamour. Instead, it offers
quality in a solid but graceful way. Indeed, each aspect of the restaurant is
marked by unaffected good taste.
The dining room is framed by two rows of arches, supported by simple,
sturdy wooden pillars. From our white-clothed table, we admired the
details of the restaurant: the greenery suspended unobtrusively from the
arches, the dusky still lifes against the textured white walls, and the heavy
copper pans amid the paintings.
No less appealing was the solid silver cutlery and the wide-bowled wine
glasses. The atmosphere, buzzing with enough people to ensure a festive
mood, was nonetheless calm and comfortable.
Our waiter was professional, confident and discreet. His qualities
seemed shared by the rest of the team of dark-suited men. We were
served briskly, and courses were timed to allow for relaxation but not
tedium.
A pleasing feature of Liaison is the formal, but never fussy, finishing of
the dishes by the waiters in the dining room.
The menu offers a mixture of classic French and Italian dishes. Some
which caught our fancy were linguine con Vongole (pasta with a clam
sauce, $9.50), tournedos madeira ($16.75), poached petrale sole
Veronique ($12.95), and roast saddle of lamb Florentine ($35 for two).
The wine list is stunning. It offers a wide range (140 different wines) of
high quality from France, Italy, Germany and California. Priced between
$8 and $325 a bottle, it includes many fine vintages, potentially satisfying
any whim. The house wine was excellent.
And now, our meal.
To begin, we shared as an appetizer the tortellini Liaison ($7.75). These
little pasta shells, filled with a chicken and veal forcemeat and covered with
a cream, tomato and garlic sauce, were a gentle and rich prelude. They
were finished at the last minute with freshly grated cheese and ground
black pepper.
As an interlude, and included in the price of the entrees, we tried the
cream of watercress soup and the house salad. The soup was smooth and
accurately flavored to enhance the peppery watercress. The salad was
nicely stark, combining romaine and butter lettuce, a single quarter of
tomato and a special olive-oil and egg-white vinaigrette.
Our main courses were veal sweetbreads Liaison ($15.75) and the spe

cial of the night, swordfish with beurre blanc ($l6). The sweetbreads were
coated with batter and then sauteed in oil. They were covered with a
sherry demi-glace and stewed mushrooms. The quick cooking preserved
the delicate texture of the sweetbreads, and their subtle flavor was not
tampered with.
The swordfish was broiled and lightly coated with the Beurre Blanc, a
liaison of white wine, butter and cream, flavored with shallots and capers.
The mildly smoky taste of the fire-cooked fish balanced well with the
slightly sour sauce. Both dishes were accompanied by rice and a selection
of crisp, buttered vegetables.
Dessert was a delight. A fluffy souffle was swiftly displayed to us and
divided, steaming onto our plates. Bathed in a glistening creme brulee
flavored with amaretto, the dish was a sensual feast. The lightness of the
egg white, the richness of cream and the touch of almond created an unfor
gettable combination. This amaretto souffle ($4.50 per person) has to be
ordered for at least two people and in advance, to allow for preparation.
At Liaison one feels accommodated. Enjoyment is the aim: the atmos
phere and service are assuring, the portions are generous, allowing the
guest to decide how much is enough, and the food is uncompromisingly
good.
It's been a long time since we liked a restaurant so much.
More information about Liaison: lunch is served Monday to Friday from
11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., dinner Monday to Saturday 5 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.

son.

quality in a solid but graceful way. Indeed, each aspect of the restaurant is
marked by unaffected good taste.
The dining room is framed by two rows of arches, supported by simple,
sturdy wooden pillars. From our white-clothed table, we admired the
details of the restaurant: the greenery suspended unobtrusively from the
arches, the dusky still lifes against the textured white walls, and the heavy
copper pans amid the paintings.
No less appealing was the solid silver cutlery and the wide-bowled wine
glasses. The atmosphere, buzzing with enough people to ensure a festive
mood, was nonetheless calm and comfortable.
Our waiter was professional, confident and discreet. His qualities
seemed shared by the rest of the team of dark-suited men. We were
served briskly, and courses were timed to allow for relaxation but not
tedium.
A pleasing feature of Liaison is the formal, but never fussy, finishing of
the dishes by the waiters in the dining room.
The menu offers a mixture of classic French and Italian dishes. Some
which caught our fancy were linguine con Vongole (pasta with a clam
sauce, $9.50), tournedos madeira ($16.75), poached petrale sole
Veronique ($12.95), and roast saddle of lamb Florentine ($35 for two).
The wine list is stunning. It offers a wide range (140 different wines) of
high quality from France, Italy, Germany and California. Priced between
$8 and $325 a bottle, it includes many fine vintages, potentially satisfying
any whim. The house wine was excellent.
And now, our meal.
To begin, we shared as an appetizer the tortellini Liaison ($7.75). These
little pasta shells, filled with a chicken and veal forcemeat and covered with
a cream, tomato and garlic sauce, were a gentle and rich prelude. They
were finished at the last minute with freshly grated cheese and ground
black pepper.
As an interlude, and included in the price of the entrees, we tried the
cream of watercress soup and the house salad. The soup was smooth and
accurately flavored to enhance the peppery watercress. The salad was
nicely stark, combining romaine and butter lettuce, a single quarter of
tomato and a special olive-oil and egg-white vinaigrette.
Our main courses were veal sweetbreads Liaison ($15.75) and the spe

cial of the night, swordfish with beurre blanc ($l6). The sweetbreads were
coated with batter and then sauteed in oil. They were covered with a
sherry demi-glace and stewed mushrooms. The quick cooking preserved
the delicate texture of the sweetbreads, and their subtle flavor was not
tampered with.
The swordfish was broiled and lightly coated with the Beurre Blanc, a
liaison of white wine, butter and cream, flavored with shallots and capers.
The mildly smoky taste of the fire-cooked fish balanced well with the
slightly sour sauce. Both dishes were accompanied by rice and a selection
of crisp, buttered vegetables.
Dessert was a delight. A fluffy souffle was swiftly displayed to us and
divided, steaming onto our plates. Bathed in a glistening creme brulee
flavored with amaretto, the dish was a sensual feast. The lightness of the
egg white, the richness of cream and the touch of almond created an unfor
gettable combination. This amaretto souffle ($4.50 per person) has to be
ordered for at least two people and in advance, to allow for preparation.
At Liaison one feels accommodated. Enjoyment is the aim: the atmos
phere and service are assuring, the portions are generous, allowing the
guest to decide how much is enough, and the food is uncompromisingly
good.
It's been a long time since we liked a restaurant so much.
