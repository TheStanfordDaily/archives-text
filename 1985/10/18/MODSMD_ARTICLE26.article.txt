For those in search of a romantic
French restaurant with fine food, a
fun, European ambience, and that
certain "Je ne sais quoi," Le Pot au
Feu may be just the place for you.
Prices at this quaint French res
taurant, located 10 minutes north of
campus on El Camino Real, are not
low, but the dining experience is
well worth the average $25-per
person charge.
The simple but elegant restau
rant has a relaxing atmosphere,
where nothing seems rushed. The
decor and service are unpreten
tious and pleasant. Upon entering,
the customer is transported to a
Paris street-side cafe. Each table is
candle-lit, covered by a checkered,
blue tablecloth, and adorned with a
"Cinzano" umbrella.
The walls at Le Pot au Feu
resemble the exteriors of French
buildings. False windows, replete
with curtains, wooden shutters,
and colorful plastic floral arrange
ments on each sill, contribute to the
European atmosphere. Soft music
adds the necessary romantic touch.
The menu, which changes three
times a week due to the restau
rant's large number of specialties,
is impressive. Hors d'oeuvres of
fered include smoked venison, es
cargots de Bourgogne and mussels.
Entrees — which cost about $13
each and come with soup, fresh
vegetables and garden salad — in
clude sweetbreads, beef Wellington
and milk-fed veal scallopini. The
servings are large; ordering an ap

petizer and entree allows one to
hibernate for three weeks following
the meal.
We started our dinner with a Brie
in puff pastry hors d'oeuvre ($3.50)
that was light, flaky and quite good
and California fried escargots in
ginger sauce ($4.75), which was an
equally tasty dish, thanks to the ac
companying biscuit and zesty
sauce.
The soup du jour — vegetable
soup — was fresh, hot and free, as
soup should be. The garden salad
with a house vinaigrette was also
good, and, taken together with the
soup, ensured that we would be too
full to finish our entrees.
We chose poussin (game hen;
$13.25) roasted with Dijon, and
canard (duck; $13.75) a la Nor
mande for our entrees. The poussin
was pleasantly arranged, prepared
in a nouvelle cuisine fashion with
light sauce and served with rice and
steamed carrots. The canard, duck
ling with apple cider, cream and
apples, was tender if not wonderful
and was also arranged nicely.
The house white wine, a 1984
vintage California chardonnay, was
an excellent complement to our din
ner.
For dessert we chose a rich
chocolate mousse tart from among
a large list that included apple turn
overs with vanilla sauce and choco
late cake with raspberry sauce.
Service at Le Pot au Feu is good.
The waiters and waitresses are
European, and their accents con
tribute to the relaxing French at
mosphere.
The courses are not served too
quickly, and one never gets the im
pression that the waitress is eager
to bring the check, until, of course,
one asks for it.
