Carmel
Population: 4,707
Location: Approx. 100 miles
southeast of Stanford on High
way 1
Area Code: 408
Nestled on the southern side of
the spectacular Monterey Peninsula
lies the charming town of Carmel
by-the-Sea. This unique ocean-side
hamlet is the perfect spot for a
quick getaway from the crowds and
noise of the Bay Area. Located less
than 100 miles south of Stanford
along the scenic Pacific Coast High
way (Highway 1), Carmel is less
than two hours away by car or bus.
This small town of 4,707 resi
dents has enough charm to last
most romantics a lifetime. Quaint
cottage homes, fanciful shops, ex
travagant boutiques and colorful
gardens line every street.
The town was originally pop
ulated by artists and craftsmen
seeking a quiet place to work in har
mony with nature.
Today's residents of this seaside
enclave are determined to maintain
its beauty and charm despite the ar
rival of flocks of tourists from all
around the world. So resolved are
the locals to preserve the small
town atmosphere, that village or
dinances absolutely prohibit traffic
lights, parking meters, neon signs,
billboards and buildings more than
three stories tall. Lest unsightly

mail trucks clutter their streets, the
locals even banned home mail
delivery in favor of assigning a post
office box to each resident. A 1916
law making it a felony to cut down
any tree in the city is still on the
books.
The main drag of Carmel, Ocean
Street, runs between Highway 1
and the town's pristine beach.
Carmel's beach offers powdery
white sand to match that of any
Caribbean beach. However, lest
you be fooled into thinking that this
is a tropical paradise, the surf is
both chilly and treacherous. Heed
the signs warning of strong under
tows.
The beach has a beautiful vista of
the Pebble Beach Pro-Am Golf
Course to the north and the rugged
Big Sur coastline to the south. To
get away from the crowds, walk
down the beach to your left for
about half a mile to River Beach, a
favorite of local surfers.
You can never lack things to do in
Carmel. You can spend hours just
walking through the myriad of
boutiques and shops. Where else
can you find more than 70 galleries
within one square mile? The shops
cater mostly to the numerous
wealthy tourists, and prices range
from moderately high to astronomi
cal. Shop owners are uniformly
friendly and browsers are welcome.
If you want to explore a bit more
of the town than the downtown
area, rent a bicycle. The Valley
Cycle Center (624-5107) as well as
many guest houses and inns rent
bikes. Be sure to explore the fa

mous 17-Mile Drive that runs from
Carmel along the coast to Pebble
Beach. While cars must pay a hefty
toll to tour this private piece of
paradise, bicycles and pedestrians
may enter free.
Two miles northwest of Carmel
on the 17-Mile Drive, you can find
some of the best golf in the world.
The Pebble Beach Golf Links (624-
3811) are the home course to the
Crosby Pro-Am Tournament. It is
open to the public with advance
reservations.
Horseback riding is another
popular activity in Carmel. Scenic
rides along the coast can be ar
ranged through Whiffletree Ranch
in nearby Carmel Valley (624-
4629).
Tours of nearby Mission Carmel
give an excellent glimpse into Cali
fornia's early history.
Although Carmel is an easy day
trip from Stanford, many guests
choose to stay an entire weekend.
The town is packed with small, inti
mate guest houses and inns. As
with everything in Carmel, paradise
doesn't come cheap. Most hotel
prices start at well over $75 per
night for double occupancy.
We stayed at the Carriage House
(625-2585). This elegant, modern
inn offers beautiful rooms filled with
early American finishings,
handmade quilts, fireplaces and
sunken tiled baths. All rooms
feature refrigerators and phones. A
complimentary continental break
fast is brought to your room each

Stanford.
morning along with the morning
paper. Room rates from October
through December range from $75
to $100 per night. Try to stay on
the second story, as the 25-foot
high ceilings are beautiful. Located
one block off Ocean Street on
Junipero, the Carriage House is
within easy walking distance of the
town's center.
Probably the best hotel price in
town is at the Carmel River Inn
(624-1575), located one-and-one
half miles southeast on Highway 1.
Room rates here start at slightly
over $30 for small cottages.
Another budget possibility is the
Carmel Youth Hostel (AYH
affiliated). It is closed much of the
season, so be sure to call the Mon
terey area YMCA for current infor
mation (373-4166).
Camping is prohibited in the town
proper, but is available approxi
mately 20 TO 25 miles south at
several state campgrounds in the
Big Sur area. State campground
reservations can be made in ad
vance through the Tresidder Union
Ticket Office.
There are literally hundreds of
small restaurants and taverns in
Carmel, offering some of Califor
nia's finest cuisine. The local paper,
The Pine Cone, lists them all by
food type and price. If you want a
romantic splurge, try Casanova

Restaurant on Fifth Avenue be
tween San Carlos and Mission
Streets. Reservations are not ac
cepted, and be prepared to wait 20
TO 30 minutes if you come after
6:30 p.m. Casanova specializes in
fresh Italian and French cuisine.
Ask to be seated in the enclosed
outdoor courtyard (heated in win
ter).
For nightlife, try the tiny Hog's
Breath Inn off San Carlos between
Fifth and Sixth Streets. Clint
Eastwood owns this pub/restaurant

and is known to make frequent ap
pearances there.
Another possible evening diver
sion is to visit the hot tubs at Black
thorne Spas (624-3241). The hot
tubs are open every day until mid
night and feature landscaped,
private outdoor tubs with redwood
decks. Tubs are rented on an
hourly basis.

at 372-2791 or the Carmel Cham
ber of Commerce at 649-1770.

There are literally hundreds of
small restaurants and taverns in

Carmel
Population: 4,707
Location: Approx. 100 miles
southeast of Stanford on High
way 1
Area Code: 408
Nestled on the southern side of
the spectacular Monterey Peninsula
lies the charming town of Carmel
by-the-Sea. This unique ocean-side
hamlet is the perfect spot for a
quick getaway from the crowds and
noise of the Bay Area. Located less
than 100 miles south of Stanford
along the scenic Pacific Coast High
way (Highway 1), Carmel is less
than two hours away by car or bus.
This small town of 4,707 resi
dents has enough charm to last
most romantics a lifetime. Quaint
cottage homes, fanciful shops, ex
travagant boutiques and colorful
gardens line every street.
The town was originally pop
ulated by artists and craftsmen
seeking a quiet place to work in har
mony with nature.
Today's residents of this seaside
enclave are determined to maintain
its beauty and charm despite the ar
rival of flocks of tourists from all
around the world. So resolved are
the locals to preserve the small
town atmosphere, that village or
dinances absolutely prohibit traffic
lights, parking meters, neon signs,
billboards and buildings more than
three stories tall. Lest unsightly

mail trucks clutter their streets, the
locals even banned home mail
delivery in favor of assigning a post
office box to each resident. A 1916
law making it a felony to cut down
any tree in the city is still on the
books.
The main drag of Carmel, Ocean
Street, runs between Highway 1
and the town's pristine beach.
Carmel's beach offers powdery
white sand to match that of any
Caribbean beach. However, lest
you be fooled into thinking that this
is a tropical paradise, the surf is
both chilly and treacherous. Heed
the signs warning of strong under
tows.
The beach has a beautiful vista of
the Pebble Beach Pro-Am Golf
Course to the north and the rugged
Big Sur coastline to the south. To
get away from the crowds, walk
down the beach to your left for
about half a mile to River Beach, a
favorite of local surfers.
You can never lack things to do in
Carmel. You can spend hours just
walking through the myriad of
boutiques and shops. Where else
can you find more than 70 galleries
within one square mile? The shops
cater mostly to the numerous
wealthy tourists, and prices range
from moderately high to astronomi
cal. Shop owners are uniformly
friendly and browsers are welcome.
If you want to explore a bit more
of the town than the downtown
area, rent a bicycle. The Valley
Cycle Center (624-5107) as well as
many guest houses and inns rent
bikes. Be sure to explore the fa

mous 17-Mile Drive that runs from
Carmel along the coast to Pebble
Beach. While cars must pay a hefty
toll to tour this private piece of
paradise, bicycles and pedestrians
may enter free.
Two miles northwest of Carmel
on the 17-Mile Drive, you can find
some of the best golf in the world.
The Pebble Beach Golf Links (624-
3811) are the home course to the
Crosby Pro-Am Tournament. It is
open to the public with advance
reservations.
Horseback riding is another
popular activity in Carmel. Scenic
rides along the coast can be ar
ranged through Whiffletree Ranch
in nearby Carmel Valley (624-
4629).
Tours of nearby Mission Carmel
give an excellent glimpse into Cali
fornia's early history.
Although Carmel is an easy day
trip from Stanford, many guests
choose to stay an entire weekend.
The town is packed with small, inti
mate guest houses and inns. As
with everything in Carmel, paradise
doesn't come cheap. Most hotel
prices start at well over $75 per
night for double occupancy.
We stayed at the Carriage House
(625-2585). This elegant, modern
inn offers beautiful rooms filled with
early American finishings,
handmade quilts, fireplaces and
sunken tiled baths. All rooms
feature refrigerators and phones. A
complimentary continental break
fast is brought to your room each


The Lone Cypress Tree is the hallmark of Carmel, a seaside paradise 100 miles southeast of
Stanford.
morning along with the morning
paper. Room rates from October
through December range from $75
to $100 per night. Try to stay on
the second story, as the 25-foot
high ceilings are beautiful. Located
one block off Ocean Street on
Junipero, the Carriage House is
within easy walking distance of the
town's center.
Probably the best hotel price in
town is at the Carmel River Inn
(624-1575), located one-and-one
half miles southeast on Highway 1.
Room rates here start at slightly
over $30 for small cottages.
