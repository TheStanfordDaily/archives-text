Upon walking into Chef Chu's, it was immediately
apparent that this restaurant had been tested by
many restaurant reviewers before us, all of whom
left feeling absolutely delighted.
One whole wall of the foyer is devoted solely to
framed clippings of these rave reviews and to
pictures of various celebrities who have dined at the
restaurant. Beside the cash register near the
entryway, Chef Chu's cookbooks, a recommended
buy for anyone who really wants to cook good
Chinese food, are available. Chef Chu (a.k.a.
Lawrence C.C. Chu) has gone on the Julia Child talk
show circuit many times, demonstrating his cooking
skills and promoting his cookbook on such television
programs as "A.M. San Francisco" and "A.M. Los
Angeles." Many people, and even some critics,
believe Chu is worth his weight in Chinese food.
After reading through Chu's impressive creden
tials, we were determined to be especially critical of
this restaurant. If Chef Chu's did not live up to its
reputation, we were going to expose it. After a brief
wait we were seated in one of two large rooms. Al
though there were many tables and many more
people, spacing was adequate and we did not feel
crowded. The bamboo-colored walls were tastefully
decorated with framed Chinese prints of natural
scenes. Coupled with the lighting, they created a
warm and lazy atmosphere.
The menu provided us by our jovial waiter was
quite extensive, giving us a wide selection of Man

darin Chinese dishes (all the dishes on the menu are
available for takeout). For appetizers, we ordered
fried won ton ($2.40) and egg rolls ($2.40). While
we both agreed that the quantities and prices were
more than reasonable, we differed on what we liked
the most. Despite our differences, every bit of the
vegetable- and pork-stuffed egg rolls, as well as the
very last bite of the crispy won ton pieces, was soon
eaten.
For the main course we ordered almond chicken
($5.95), hot and sour beef ($7.25), dry braised
prawns ($7.50) and steamed rice (55 cents a ser
ving). Soon after we finished off our appetizers, our
waiter brought us three beautifully prepared plates
heaped with chicken, beef and prawns.
The almond chicken, with diced tender chicken,
bamboo shoots, mushrooms and almonds in a deli
cious delicate sauce, had a very subtle flavor that
complemented the crispy freshness of the
vegetables. The beef was Hunan style, sauteed in a
wonderfully spicy chili, ginger and garlic sauce, and
made a lively contrast to the chicken. While the
strips of beef were a bit heavier than the chicken,
they seemed to melt in our mouths. Our final dish,
the prawns (a must for everyone) was especially
delicious.
The meal was concluded with the traditional
American/Chinese fortune cookies. After reading
our fortunes, we sat and considered this formidable
restaurant. We wished we had not seen the reviews
before our meal. It would have been much more fun
to discover a restaurant this good all by ourselves.
The reviews that we read before our meal built up
great expectations. Chef Chu and his staff,
however, met our expectations and then surpassed
them. Chef Chu, another rave review â€” and again
you deserve it.
