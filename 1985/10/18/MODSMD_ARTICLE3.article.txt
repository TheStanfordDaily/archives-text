# Prof, to Review Case
## Kennedy requests brutality investigation 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy has appointed Law Prof.
John Kaplan to investigate allega
tions of police brutality in last
Friday's civil disobedience arrest of
senior Robby Perkins.
In a statement released yester
day, Kennedy asked those with
"relevant information" to take a
written statement, including "a
brief indication of what you saw or
experienced," to Kaplan for consid
eration.
Kennedy said he is "deeply con
cerned" by allegations that police
used excessive force during and
after the arrests of nine students,
including Perkins, at last Friday's

Old Union protest against Univer
sity investments in companies that
do business in South Africa.
"1 have not, however, received
any first-hand account by those who
feel they were subjected to, or wit
nessed, the use of such force," he
said.
Kennedy said that "no effective
action can be taken in the absence
of first-hand reports."
Bob Hamrdla, assistant to the
president, said that to his knowl
edge Kennedy has not considered
any specific actions — including the
dismissal of charges against Perkins
— in the case.
Perkins was charged with
trespassing, unlawful assembly,
refusal to disperse from an unlawful

assembly, remaining at the scene of
a riot after a warning to disperse
and resisting arrest.
Perkins has charged that law en
forcement officers beat and strip
searched him in an effort to make
him feel "like an animal."
In the statement, Kennedy said
he has spoken to Perkins, urging
him to supply a written statement
outlining his charges.
Kennedy said he is "confident
that complaints will be promptly in
vestigated."
"I shall inform the authorities
both of our interest and of our wil
lingness to cooperate in any way we
can," he said.
