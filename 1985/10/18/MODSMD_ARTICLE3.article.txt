# Prof, to Review Case
## Kennedy requests brutality investigation 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy has appointed Law Prof.
John Kaplan to investigate allega
tions of police brutality in last
Friday's civil disobedience arrest of
senior Robby Perkins.
In a statement released yester
day, Kennedy asked those with
"relevant information" to take a
written statement, including "a
brief indication of what you saw or
experienced," to Kaplan for consid
eration.
Kennedy said he is "deeply con
cerned" by allegations that police
used excessive force during and
after the arrests of nine students,
including Perkins, at last Friday's

Old Union protest against Univer
sity investments in companies that
do business in South Africa.
"1 have not, however, received
any first-hand account by those who
feel they were subjected to, or wit
nessed, the use of such force," he
said.
Kennedy said that "no effective
action can be taken in the absence
of first-hand reports."
Bob Hamrdla, assistant to the
president, said that to his knowl
edge Kennedy has not considered
any specific actions — including the
dismissal of charges against Perkins
— in the case.
Perkins was charged with
trespassing, unlawful assembly,
refusal to disperse from an unlawful

assembly, remaining at the scene of
a riot after a warning to disperse
and resisting arrest.
Perkins has charged that law en
forcement officers beat and strip
searched him in an effort to make
him feel "like an animal."
In the statement, Kennedy said
he has spoken to Perkins, urging
him to supply a written statement
outlining his charges.
Kennedy said he is "confident
that complaints will be promptly in
vestigated."
"I shall inform the authorities
both of our interest and of our wil
lingness to cooperate in any way we
can," he said.
Kennedy said complaints against
Stanford police officers and Santa
Clara County sheriff's deputies
should be directed to the Santa
Clara County sheriff or district at
torney. Complaints against Stan
ford officers also may be lodged
with Stanford Police Capt. Marvin

The Office of the Dean of Stu

dent Affairs "will provide help to
students who need assistance in
identifying the proper addressee, or
wish the University to forward the
complaint," Kennedy said.
David Pryor, general representa
tive for the Black Student Union
(BSU), said the group couldn't
make a statement until members of
the organization met to discuss
Kennedy's announcement.
BSU Chairperson Steve Phillips
said last night that while the BSU

remains concerned over Kennedy's
"passive initial response ... it
seems like he is finally responding
to us."
The BSU will continue to ask that
all charges be dropped against
those arrested last Friday, Phillips
said. Kennedy's statement did not
address the BSU's call to drop
charges or its request that Stanford
Police Sgt. Nick Brunot be
removed from the force.
John Schwartz, vice president

and general counsel for the Univer
sity, said that Kaplan was picked for
the investigation because of his
"excellent judgment and experi
ence."
Hamrdla said Kennedy appointed
Kaplan to gather "facts that he
doesn't have time to assemble him
self." Kennedy will leave Stanford
today for a six-day trip to Southern
California.
Kaplan was unavailable for com
ment yesterday.
