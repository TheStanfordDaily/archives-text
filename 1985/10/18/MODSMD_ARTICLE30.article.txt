## Cardinal Bandwagon Goes South for 'SC 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
There's danger in the air today,
as student-stuffed cars and RVs
leave the Stanford campus in search
of victory in L.A., in search of the
first Cardinal football victory at
USC since 1975. There's danger
that the Stanford faithful are going
to drive more than 400 miles to see
a very, very lopsided loss.
All the signs are there. The
Trojans are arguably a better team
than they were last year, when
they went 9-3 and won the Rose
Bowl. They have had two weeks of
rest since walloping Oregon State
63-0 in their last game, and an em
barrassing 24-0 loss to Arizona
State three weeks ago has turned
every one of their Pacific 10 Con
ference matchups into must wins.
They have an offensive line that
is larger than the Los Angeles
Raiders', anchored by 6-foot-8,
285-pound tackle James FitzPatrick
and 6-foot-4, 280-pound guard Jeff
Bregel. They have averaged 55
carries and 201 yards on the ground
per game this year using four differ
ent tailbacks, most notably senior
Fred Crutcher and freshman Aaron
Emmanuel.
Sean Salisbury is back at quarter
back after missing most of last year
with an injury, and though he has
only had to throw the ball 70 times
in four games, he is leading the Pac
-10 in passing efficiency. If he needs
to throw, he has a pair of good
wideouts in Hank Norman and

Randy Tanner
And the offense isn't even the
strength of the team. The speedy
USC defense has allowed only
269.2 yards a game — best in the
conference and No. 10 nationally
— and given up an average of just
13.5 points. Safeties Tim McDonald
and Jerome Tyler have helped the
Trojans hold their opponents to just
179 yards a game through the air,
and nickel back Junior Thurman has
four interceptions.
Match all that against the skid
ding, banged-up, 1-4 Cardinal and
draw your own conclusions.
The Stanford injury list is longer
than it has been all year. The big
gest name on the list is that of full
back Brad Muster, who was having
a Heisman-quality season before
suffering a hip pointer against
Texas and a bruised sternum
against UCLA. He has not
practiced in two weeks, and in all
likelihood he will not even make the
trip to USC.
And the three players who
pinched nerves in their necks
against UCLA — safety Brad
Humphries, defensive tackle Joe
Lortie and linebacker Matt Soder
lund — are not in good shape
either. Humphries and Lortie have
not practiced all week, and Soder
lund did not see action until yester
day.
It's a good bet that either Mark
Hashimoto or Bruce Richardson
will start in place of Humphries, and
that Sean Scheller will replace

Opposing passers have succeeded in hitting on deep patterns against the Cardinal all year.
