# Stanford Runners Race in Madison
## 
### BILL JACKSON 
After spending yesterday on a
plane traveling to Madison,
Wise., the men's and women's
cross country teams hope to do
some flying of a different kind in
tomorrow's Wisconsin/Burger
King Invitational.
The Cardinal, coming off a
highly successful Stanford Invita
tional two weeks ago in which
both squads dominated local and
West Coast schools for convinc
ing victories, will face some of
the best teams in the nation
when the guns fire tomorrow
morning to signal the start of the
action.

"We want to see how the men
stack up against Arizona and
UCLA and see how the women
fare against Wisconsin (the
defending national champion),"
Coach Brooks Johnson said.
"This is essentially a preview of
this year's NCAA championship
meet."
The Stanford men, currently
ranked third in the West, will be
blazing an eight-kilometer course
while the women, ranked third in
the nation, will run over a five
kilometer layout.
Last week, Johnson chose not
to run the A teams in the
Cal/Nike Invitational, deciding
instead to rest them sufficiently for
tomorrow's meet. "We are rested
and healthy," Johnson said.
"However, there has been a virus
going around, so we'll see."
Healthy or not, this meet is "a
biggee," according to senior men's
captain Jeff Atkinson.
This week during practice, mem
bers of the men's and women's
squads talked of the possibility of
encountering an "EXAFS" course
tomorrow. EXAFS is a harrier
acronym standing for "extended
angling and flat suface."
No matter what the course
layout has in store, there should be
exciting team and individual compe
tition.
At the front of the pack should be
Cardinal men Ryan Stoll, Marc
Olesen, Jeff Atkinson, Brian Pettin
gill and James Alborough. Leading
the women should be Stanford run
ners Regina Jacobs, Alison Wiley,
Kathy Smith, Kim Stevens and Mi
chelle Mason.
Both teams will return to campus
tomorrow night.

Walt Harris and the rest of the Stanford defense will likely have to chase more than a few ball
carriers tomorrow. In previous games, Harris and Co. have rarely been able to catch up. The
defense has yielded big plays and bundles of points.
