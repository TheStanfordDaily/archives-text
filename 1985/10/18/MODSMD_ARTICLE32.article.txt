A confident, well-rested Stanford women's
volleyball team battles Arizona State tonight in
Tempe, taking with it the No. 1 national ranking
but leaving behind the more than friendly envi
ronment of Maples Pavilion.
Tomorrow the Cardinal women travel two
hours up the Arizona highways to Tucson for an
afternoon match with the University of Arizona
Wildcats.
Following home-court victories last week over
No. 2 UCLA, No. 3 University of the Pacific and
No. 4 San Jose State, the Cardinal women had a
one week layoff and took full advantage of the
break in the schedule.
"It's been nice to have a full week of practice,"
Stanford Co-coach Don Shaw said. "We've had
time to shore up some things and work on things
that we might see later in the season."
After last Friday's trouncing of San Jose,
though, one has to wonder exactly what in the

Cardinal attack needs to be shored up. The
Cardinal dominated the Spartans at the net,
served well, passed with precision and got a
great match from sophomore setter Wendi Rush.
The result: Stanford by scores of 15-12, 15-5
and 15-7.
"We were real confident and consistent,"
Rush said after the match.
Three-time Ail-American Kim Oden had her
usual outstanding match. The senior from Irvine
led the Cardinal in kills (14), digs (7) and blocks
(4).
And, while the statistics show that her all
around play was impressive, Oden was possibly
most effective when she didn't even touch the
ball. The Cardinal used her reputation as a big
hitter to draw the Spartan block to the middle of
the court, thus opening up the sides of the court
for hitters Brooke Hahner (.412 hitting
percentage) and Theresa Smith (.375).
The Cardinal women take a perfect 14-0
record into tonight's match with ASU. Yet, what
probably would be a Cakewalk for the Cardinal at
Maples — where it is 14-0 over the past two

seasons — may not be quite as easy at Tempe.
It's not that the Cardinal women play poorly
on the road. Indeed, they are 10-0 this season
and were 10-5 last year while playing in foreign
gymnasiums.
But following an emotional and very success
ful home-court series against the nation's top
teams, the Cardinal may find a lack of the crowd
enthusiasm that was such a key to its recent
victories at Maples. It's doubtful that the Card
inal will find many friends in the middle of
Arizona.
And ASU is not exactly a patsy. Though the
Sun Devils are not in the class of UCLA, UOP or
San Jose, they were ranked No. 9 nationally last
week. "They're a good team," Shaw empha
sized. "They have most of their players back
from last year."
Recently, however, the Sun Devils have
struggled. They have lost each of their three
Pac-West conference matches and have dropped
to 14-7 overall.
