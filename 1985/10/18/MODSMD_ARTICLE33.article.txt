# Hockey To Play at Cal Invite
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
The Stanford field hockey team
won two big games last week to es
tablish itself as one of the powers of
the Northern Pacific Conference.
Today the Cardinal is in Berkeley
for the first day of a three-day
tournament which, though it has no
bearing on NorPac rankings, has
great bearing on national rankings.
And in the end, after all, it is the
national rankings that count. Only
the top 12 teams in the nation will
advance to the NCAA playoffs.
The recent victories over San
Jose State and California put the
squad's record at 3-3-1 overall and
2-1-1 in the conference. Stanford is
not currently ranked nationally.
They are No. 2 in the NorPac.
This weekend's eighth annual
Cal Invitational involves seven
teams: Stanford, Chico State, San
Jose State, the University of the
Pacific, California, James Madison
and Simon Fraser. Except for
James Madison, which is traveling
from Virginia, and Simon Fraser,
located in British Columbia, all the
competitors are in the NorPac.
The Cardinal will play Chico
today, San Jose tomorrow and
Simon Fraser on Sunday. The fact
that NorPac rankings will remain
the same regardless of what
transpires means the players can
not put more importance on games
with league rivals at the expense of
others. "I think they're all pretty
important," sophomore Ami Witt
man said.
The players, though, will be es
pecially geared up for this morn

ing's match against the Wildcats.
Two Saturdays ago, Chico beat
Stanford 2-1 in a game controlled by
the Cardinal. "It's important to
bounce back against Chico State,"
said Wittman. The Wildcats are
ranked No. 18 in the nation and No.
1 in the conference.

Two conditions which make this
tournament's matches different
from most are that the team will
have to play a game on three con
secutive days and that they will be
playing on a synthetic surface.
Wittman did not feel that the busy
schedule would be a problem for

the Cardinal. "We're in good
enough shape," she said.
Playing on Astroturf will make
the style of play different. The
games will be faster and will
demand more skill. According to
Wittman, though, no team will be
favored bv the unusual surface.
