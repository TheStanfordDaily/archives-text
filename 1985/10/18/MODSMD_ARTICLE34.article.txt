# Soccer Team At St. Mary's
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
The Stanford men's soccer
team, riding high after its 2-1 up
set victory over the University
of San Francisco last week,
travels to Moraga to face St.
Mary's College tomorrow in a 2
p.m. Pacific Soccer Conference
match-up.
While the Gaels, only 2-9-2
overall and 1-2 in the PSC, won't
offer as much competition as
USF did, the game is still an im
portant one for the Cardinal.
Coach Sam Koch's squad
defeated rivals San Jose State
and USF last week to post its
first winning record of the
season, 7-6-2, and improve the
Cardinal's PSC record to 2-1.
Koch would like to continue to
improve that record and tomor
row's game is a prime opportu
nity to do so. But it is also a
chance for the Cardinal to fall flat
on its face.
Stanford started the season
playing inconsistent soccer
against not-so-formidable compe
tition and posted a paltry 1-3-1
record in its first five games. In
the next 10 games the Cardinal
played more consistently and
went 6-3-1 over that stretch.
So tomorrow's match will be a
big test of the team's mettle.
Stanford can either suffer a let
down after the big USF victory,
or can plug away and show St.

Mary's no mercy.
"They're not a great team,"
Cardinal midfielder Phil Horvath
understated. "But if we don't
play them hard, they can come
up and bite us."
The Gaels will have some ex
tra incentive tomorrow as they'll
be looking for their first-ever vic
tory over Stanford.
The Cardinal offensive stock
has gone way up in the last week
thanks largely to the efforts of
Giancarlo Feruzzi and Angel
Vazquez. The seniors teamed up
for both goals in the USF vic
tory, and will be looking to find
the net often tomorrow.
Vazquez, who was edged out
for PSC Player of the Week
honors by Fresno State's Mark
Masich, now leads Stanford in
scoring with four goals and three
assists. Feruzzi and fellow
senior Rob West are tied for
second with two goals and four
assists apiece.
A couple goals tomorrow
could be sufficient for Cardinal
goaltender Tom Austin, who
continues to lead the PSC with a
.75 goals per game average.
Stanford is now tied for
second place in the PSC with
California. Both teams trail first
place Fresno State by one game.
The Cardinal travels to Santa
Clara Tuesday night for another
PSC game before returning to
Stanford next Saturday to host
Cal State in Sacramento.
