# Soccer Looks To Peak For Colorado Invite
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
The Stanford women's soccer
team travels to Colorado today to
confront what promises to be
its biggest challenge of the
year, the Pike's Peak Women's
Collegiate Soccer Classic.

Conditions will be tough.
Colorado College's field is signifi
cantly bigger than the ones on
which the Cardinal usually plays.
And the thin air of the Rockies
will make breathing difficult.
And just as the playing condi
tions will be demanding, so will
the level of competition Stanford
must face. The team will play

three games in three days, two of
which feature nationally ranked
squads.
Today's game is against ninth
ranked Wisconsin, 12-1 on the
year, followed by tomorrow's
game with eighth-ranked
Colorado College, 6-2.
Obviously, physical condition
ing will play a role in the
outcomes. Even though women's
soccer Coach Helen Keohane said
that she considers her team to be
in "decent physical shape," she
still plans to use some new strate
gies to combat the chest
tightening air.
"We'll substitute more because
of the altitude and try to win more
of the balls at midfield to put more
pressure on them (the other
teams)," Keohane said. "We'll try
to make the ball do a lot of the
running instead of the players."
Coming off a game against
Chico State in which the Cardinal
played some of its best soccer of
the year, this could be the perfect
time for the team to take on a
challenge like the Pike's Peak
tournament.
"I'd like to play similar to the
first half (of the Chico game) and
show that we can play well
against highly ranked teams,"
Keohane said.
She also said that until
recently, West Coast soccer
teams have been underrated by
the soccer powers of the Midwest
and the East. Now that the west
ern teams are beginning to earn
respect, Keohane said "it's our
job to keep that going and earn
respect for Stanford."
