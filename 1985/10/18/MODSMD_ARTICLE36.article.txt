# Card Sets Sail for Irvine
## 
### BRANDI WATSON Staff writer 
The Stanford sailing team travels to UC-Irvine this
weekend for the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Sloop
Championships. And the forecast is for a stiff wind and
equally stiff competition.
The team qualified for the event with a come-from
behind victory last weekend in the Northern California
Sloop Championship. To place well this weekend,
however, the team will have to find consistency and a
higher level of performance.
"We must sail a little better than last weekend,"
Coach Joe Petrucci said.
A field of seven teams — California Maritime
Academy, UC-Berkeley, UC-Irvine, Orange Coast
College, USC, Hawaii and Stanford — will be battling for
the one available berth in the North American Sloop
Championships, to be held in New Orleans in Novem
ber.
Stanford has not qualified for the end-of-the-year
championships in 10 years, but the team has finished
second three times. UC-Irvine, which is the only
school with extensive experience with the type of boat

used in New Orleans, virtually monopolizes th» Sl< ( op
competition.
Stanford is currently ranked seventh i tlu ition
and hopes to dethrone Irvine, ranked t.h. Wo\e
been spending a lot of time in Shields,' I nu ci said.
The Stanford boat will be crewed by freshmen Bill
Shoemaker and Brad Swett and senior Albert Boyce,
the team captain.
The team is hesitant in making any predictions.
"Being a freshman and not having yet competed
against Southern California schools, 1 wouldn t know,
Swett said. "I know there are a lot of good sailors down
there. It's going to be tough."
The round-robin regatta consists of seven races in
seven different boats. Petrucci expects a real dog
fight. "When you put pressure on one team to qualify,
anyone with a shot really gets he said.
"They take chances, do things they wouldn't ordinarily
d°-"
The format puts a premium on a solid start. "Ideally
we'd like to be in the lead and in control," Petrucci
said. "Only one school qualifies, and we hope to be that
single school."
Qualification in the North American Sloop Champion
ships adds points to a year-long total kept to declare a
national sailing champion in the spring.
