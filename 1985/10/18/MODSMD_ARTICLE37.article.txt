# Southern Rivals Await Polo

### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
The second-ranked Stanford
water polo team's hopes of defend
ing their Pacific 10 Conference title
rest largely on this weekend's per
formances in Los Angeles against
league foes UCLA and USC.
The Cardinal meets UCLA this
afternoon, just six days after
defeating the Bruins at DeGuerre
Pool in both teams' conference
opener. Tomorrow morning Stan
ford battles No. 6 USC.
The Cardinal currently stands
atop the Pac-10 standings with a 1-
0 record. UCLA is 1-1, No. 1 Cali
fornia is 0-1 and USC has yet to
play a league game.
With only four teams in the pow

erful Pac-10 Conference, each team
plays only six league games. Thus,
each game takes on tremendous
importance.
"The way to win league is to
avoid any losses," Cardinal Coach
Dante Dettamanti said.
Dettamanti pointed to this
weekend's games as crucial ones.
"This is probably our toughest
week of the year," he said. "We
have to prepare for two teams
(UCLA and USC), and they only
have to prepare for us."
Dettamanti also spoke of the
prestige of defeating UCLA and
USC. "Our goal every year is to
sweep in L.A.," he said.
Dettamanti likes the Cardinal's
chances of repeating as conference
champions should it defeat both
the Bruins and Trojans this

weekend. "If we sweep this
weekend, we're pretty much in
control," he said.
But a sweep of UCLA and USC is
much easier said than done. UCLA
is ranked No. 3 nationally and will
be seeking to avenge last week's 9-
5 loss to the Cardinal.
"We played our best game of the
year (against UCLA)," Dettamanti
said. "We're expecting a tougher
game this time. They'll be up for it.
They have a history of playing well
after a loss."
USC will also be looking to pay
back the Cardinal for an earlier loss.
Stanford defeated the Trojans 11-8
in the semi-finals of the UC-Irvine
Invitational on September 21.
