# More Guest Greek...
## 
### 
New and improved, it's The Daily Greek of the Week, edition No.
2. Improving on last week's aggregate 56-14 mark will be difficult,
but the six Daily staffers and the Guest Greek have given it their
best shot, predicting scores of 10 of the nation's top college football
games.
Stanford Board of Trustees President Warren Christopher was
chosen as this week's Guest Greek. Christopher, an alumnus of the
University of Southern California, was a deputy secretary of state in
the Carter Administration.
When informed of the honor of being selected Guest Greek, Chris
topher had no response. That's because he wasn't home. Instead,
we settled for his daughter, Kristen, which prompted Managing
Editor Cliff Highfill to ask, 'Why?"
Christopher, editor in chief of The Daily in fall 1983, learned of her
selection after telling us that her father wasn't home. "What? I have
to be the Greek?" she said, overwhelmed by the emotion of the mo
ment.
Christopher remains a Stanford fan, but this week she sees USC
dealing the Cardinal a 35-20 defeat. "I hate to be pessimistic, but
looking at the two teams' track record so far, I have to pick 'SC. I bet
Stanford will put on a good show, not a poor one like last week."
Christopher will try to improve on the 7-3 performance of Mark
Zeigler, last week's Guest Greek.
Columnist John Lis leads in the race for the coveted case of Henry
Weinhard's Private Reserve with a perfect 10-0 record. Sports
Editor Pete Haven is a game back at 9-1, while Sports Editor Rob
Graham and Cardinal Today editor Erik Eselius are 8-2.

New and improved, it's The Daily Greek of the Week, edition No.
2. Improving on last week's aggregate 56-14 mark will be difficult,
but the six Daily staffers and the Guest Greek have given it their
best shot, predicting scores of 10 of the nation's top college football
games.
Stanford Board of Trustees President Warren Christopher was
chosen as this week's Guest Greek. Christopher, an alumnus of the
University of Southern California, was a deputy secretary of state in
the Carter Administration.
When informed of the honor of being selected Guest Greek, Chris
topher had no response. That's because he wasn't home. Instead,
we settled for his daughter, Kristen, which prompted Managing
Editor Cliff Highfill to ask, 'Why?"
Christopher, editor in chief of The Daily in fall 1983, learned of her
selection after telling us that her father wasn't home. "What? I have
to be the Greek?" she said, overwhelmed by the emotion of the mo
ment.
Christopher remains a Stanford fan, but this week she sees USC
dealing the Cardinal a 35-20 defeat. "I hate to be pessimistic, but
looking at the two teams' track record so far, I have to pick 'SC. I bet
Stanford will put on a good show, not a poor one like last week."
Christopher will try to improve on the 7-3 performance of Mark
Zeigler, last week's Guest Greek.
Columnist John Lis leads in the race for the coveted case of Henry
Weinhard's Private Reserve with a perfect 10-0 record. Sports
Editor Pete Haven is a game back at 9-1, while Sports Editor Rob
Graham and Cardinal Today editor Erik Eselius are 8-2.
