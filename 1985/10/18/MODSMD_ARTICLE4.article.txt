# USW Reacts to Firing
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
Members of the United Stanford Workers (USW) last
night claimed the University's firing of two workers for
suspected vandalism was meant to intimidate the
union, and a University official responded by saying the
firing was discipline "in good faith."
USW member Victor Hill and Marlena Broussard, a
non-union temporary clerical worker, were fired yes
terday after the University accused them of slashing
the tires on Hill's supervisor's car.
University negotiator Priscilla Wheeler countered
the union's charges, saying, "I don't think imparting
discipline on an employee in good faith constitutes an
act of repression."
Investigatory interviews, conducted by the Univer
sity, "indicated to us that there was good cause to
believe that they (Hill and Broussard) had been in
volved m an act that cannot be excused." said Wheeler,
who is a University staff counsel.
The incident comes a week before the union's strike
deadline and amid stalled contract negotiations be
tween the University and the union.

Neither Hill nor Broussard could be reached for
comment last night, and Hector Allen, the University
employee whose tires were slashed, refused to discuss
the issue.
The union has filed an unfair labor practice charge
with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and a
grievance with the University over the firings, accord
ing to Mary Ann Tenuto, the union's chief negotiator.
USW has now filed three protests with the NLRB
and plans to file eight more, Tenuto said. Earlier this
week, the University protested to the NLRB that the
union was endangering its members by encouraging
work slowdowns and sick-outs.
Yesterday, both sides met for the first time with
Maggie Jacobson, the federal mediator recently as
signed to the case. University and union negotiators
outlined their positions for Jacobson, but neither side
offered new proposals.
"We will make proposals when we can do so
legitimately," Wheeler said.
University and union negotiators disagreed over the
impact yesterday's firings wouJd have on future con
tract talks.

"It places a real road block in set
tling (on a new contract)," Tenuto
said, adding that Hill had become an
issue in the talks.
Wheeler said she did not know if
the incident would hamper progress
at the bargaining table. "As far as
I'm concerned, it's a separate
issue," she said.
"The discharge had to do with
the facts and circumstances of a
particular case. It had nothing to do
with (USW)," she added.
The union maintains that the two
workers terminated yesterdav are

innocent.
"Both are real good people.
There's no way we're going to sit
back and let them be fired without a
protest," Tenuto said.
Employee Relations Manager
Felix Barthelemy, a member of the
panel that interviewed Hill, Brous
sard and Allen, said he made the re
commendation for termination and
thought it was appropriate.
According to Barthelemy, Allen
saw the two stooping near his car.
When he then inspected his car,
two of the tires were flat and a third
was hissing air, he said.
Barthelemy said that there were
conflicting parts to Broussard's and
HiH'c vpr<?inns of the incident, but

that he could not comment on those
conflicting areas because the union
had filed a grievance.
The two sides will try to come to
terms on a new contract again on
Monday, four days before the strike
deadline.
