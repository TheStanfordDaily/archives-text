# USW Reacts to Firing
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
Members of the United Stanford Workers (USW) last
night claimed the University's firing of two workers for
suspected vandalism was meant to intimidate the
union, and a University official responded by saying the
firing was discipline "in good faith."
USW member Victor Hill and Marlena Broussard, a
non-union temporary clerical worker, were fired yes
terday after the University accused them of slashing
the tires on Hill's supervisor's car.
University negotiator Priscilla Wheeler countered
the union's charges, saying, "I don't think imparting
discipline on an employee in good faith constitutes an
act of repression."
Investigatory interviews, conducted by the Univer
sity, "indicated to us that there was good cause to
believe that they (Hill and Broussard) had been in
volved m an act that cannot be excused." said Wheeler,
who is a University staff counsel.
The incident comes a week before the union's strike
deadline and amid stalled contract negotiations be
tween the University and the union.

Neither Hill nor Broussard could be reached for
comment last night, and Hector Allen, the University
employee whose tires were slashed, refused to discuss
the issue.
The union has filed an unfair labor practice charge
with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and a
grievance with the University over the firings, accord
ing to Mary Ann Tenuto, the union's chief negotiator.
USW has now filed three protests with the NLRB
and plans to file eight more, Tenuto said. Earlier this
week, the University protested to the NLRB that the
union was endangering its members by encouraging
work slowdowns and sick-outs.
Yesterday, both sides met for the first time with
Maggie Jacobson, the federal mediator recently as
signed to the case. University and union negotiators
outlined their positions for Jacobson, but neither side
offered new proposals.
"We will make proposals when we can do so
legitimately," Wheeler said.
University and union negotiators disagreed over the
impact yesterday's firings wouJd have on future con
tract talks.
