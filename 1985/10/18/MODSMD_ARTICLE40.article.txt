Yugoslavia Refuses Extradition
WASHINGTON — The government of Yugoslavia yesterday for
mally notified the United States that it would not extradite alleged
hijacking mastermind Abul Abbas, saying he had already left the
country.
The formal refusal of the Belgrade government to detain Abbas
came as no surprise because Yugoslavia has maintained close ties
with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Abbas' group, the
Palestine Liberation Front, is a PLO splinter organization.
The Reagan Administration, nevertheless, expressed sharp disap
pointment that the man it believes was behind the Oct. 7 hijacking of
the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro had apparently slipped beyond
American reach.
White House spokesman Edward Djerejian said the Administration
was "extremely disappointed."
Abbas flew from Rome to Belgrade Saturday, hours after the
United States asked the Italian government to make a provisional ar
rest on the basis of a warrant issued by a federal district judge here.
Yugoslavia's decision to reject the U.S. request to hold Abbas was
relayed to an American Embassy official in Belgrade by an assistant
foreign minister. Belgrade took the position that the U.S. request
was "legally ungrounded," and pointed out that Abbas is a member of
the executive committee of the PLO and that he therefore possesses
diplomatic immunity.
Three Charged in TWA Hijack
WASHINGTON — The Justice Department unsealed arrest war
rants yesterday charging three Lebanese Shiites with the June
hijacking of a TWA airliner in Beirut as the Reagan Administration
posted a $250,000 reward for information that would help convict the
fugitives.
In disclosing the identities of the TWA hijackers for the first time,
the department said it had charged Ali Atwa, Mohammad Hamadei
and Hassan 'Izz-Al-din with air piracy and murder in the 17-day sei
zure of TWA Flight 847 and the shooting death of Navy diver Robert
Dean Stethem of Waldorf, Md.
All three are believed to be in Lebanon.
U.S. officials disclosed earlier this week that they had issued ar
rest warrants for four Palestinian hijackers of the Italian cruise ship
Achille Lauro and Abul Abbas, the Palestine Liberation Front
leader who the Administration says was mastermind of the plot.
The four Palestinian suspects are being prosecuted in Italy and
Abbas' whereabouts are unknown. In the TWA case U.S. officials
have made no request for Lebanon to extradite the Shiite suspects
under a world anti-hijacking agreement.
Attorney General Edwin Meese said yesterday's actions were
part of "a determined, coordinated effort by the United States" to
crack down on terrorism.
Simon Wins Nobel in Literature
The 1985 Nobel Prize in literature was awarded yesterday to
French novelist Claude Simon, a champion of impressionistic, largely
plotless novels who says he writes fiction "the way you paint a
picture."
Simon, an exponent of the nouveau roman or "new novel" move
ment of the late 19505, became the first French author to win the
prize since 1964, when the existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre refused to
accept it, saying the Nobel corrupted its recipients.
Simon said he will go to Stockholm to accept with "satisfaction"
the $225,000 prize Dec. 10.
Published in France by Editions de Minuit and in the United States
by George Braziller, Simon is a writer only somewhat better known
in France than in the United States. Even within the circle of "new
novelists," his name is probably less familiar than that of Nathalie
Sarraute, whose work was celebrated by Sartre, or that of Alain
Robbe-Grillet, who was championed by the late influential French
critic Roland Barthes.
"This is a courageous choice by the Nobel committee," said Roger
Shattuck, a professor of French at the University of Virginia.
"Simon's works are neither popular nor traditional. Simon has earned
a place as a major writer working seriously to extend the relations
between language, vision and the novel form."
Riots Continue in South Africa
ATHLONE. South Africa — Police yesterday clashed for the third
time this week with residents of this mixed-race township who were
angered by authorities' refusal to release the bodies of three youths
killed in disturbances earlier this week.
The Moslem residents were particularly offended because police
had refused to allow the youths' families to pick up their bodies in
time for the swift burial required by their faith.
"Now there is a bond of radicalism in Thornton Road that is not
going to go away," said Baptist minister Graham Cyster, as he
watched a group of residents give vent to their anger by trying to set
fire to a bulldozer they had taken from municipal workers who hap
pened to drive down the street. At least 60 persons were treated for
shotgun wounds and the effects of tear gas by a local doctor yester
day.
Among those wounded in Thornton Road yesterday was a British
reporter, Michael Hornsby of The Times of London, who was hit by
50 shotgun pellets in the back, legs and head as police opened fire on
the crowd. He was treated by a local doctor.
Three people were killed Wednesday night and yesterday in
clashes with the police in other Colored, or mixed-race, townships
outside Cape Town, bringing to seven the number who have died in
these townships since Tuesday.
There were clashes in many of the Colored townships yesterday
with scores of injuries reported.
Six Die in Lebanon Bombing
JERUSALEM — A South Lebanese radio station owned by an
American Christian organization was demolished and six people were
killed early yesterday when a guard surprised four men trying to
blow up the installation, Israeli military and independent sources
said.
All the deaths apparently occurred when explosives carried by the
saboteurs were detonated during a firefight with the guard. The
guard and the would-be bombers were killed, as was a technician
working inside the station, the sources said.
Until the attack yesterday, the station, known as the Voice of
Hope, broadcast from two former French customs buildings located
near the Druse village of Khiam in Israel's self-proclaimed security
zone in Southern Lebanon, about two miles north of the Lebanon-
Israel border.
