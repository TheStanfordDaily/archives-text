# Craxi blames collapse on U.S.
## Italian Prime Minister Resigns 
### 
ROME — One of the most stable Italian gov
ernments since World War II collapsed yesterday
as Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, in a startling
and bitter farewell speech, blamed the United
States for bringing down his government.
Craxi submitted the resignation of his 26-
month-old government — the second most en
during in post-World War II Italian history — to
President Francesco Cossiga after protesting
the actions of the Reagan Administration in the
aftermath of the hijacking of the Italian cruise
liner Achille Lauro.
The Socialist prime minister, who will act as
caretaker until another government is formed,
accused Washington of failing "to recognize all
the Italian government" did to resolve the hijack
ing crisis and taking a "polemical tone" in criticiz
ing Italy for releasing a Palestinian leader
accused by the United States of masterminding
the Achille Lauro operation.
His government's collapse was triggered by
the withdrawal Wednesday of Defense Minister

Giovanni Spadolini and his Republican Party from
the five-party governing coalition. The
Republicans quit over Craxi's failure to consult
all members of the coalition before he released
Abul Abbas, a Palestine Liberation Organization
official who negotiated the hijackers' surrender
and then flew out of Egypt with them on a plane
intercepted by U.S. warplanes.
Craxi noted, in his speech to parliament, that
it was the United States that asked him to call on
Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Libera
tion Organization, for help in ending the hijack
ing, a call that brought on the first heavy
criticism of his government.
He also revealed that U.S. fighter jets violated
Italian airspace during an unapproved chase of an
Egyptian jet carrying PLO official Abul Abbas
from Sicily to Rome last Friday, almost 24 hours
after the hijackers' escape plane was first forced
down by U.S. Navy jets over the Mediterranean
Sea.

Craxi referred to the interception of the
escape plane as "the hijacking of an Egyptian
plane by American aviation."
Craxi said the outraged response of the
Reagan Administration to Abbas' release "could
not but provoke unpleasant surprise and bitter
ness for the ignorance on the part of a friendly
government of everything that the Italian gov
ernment .had done to successfully overcome a
particularly critical and difficult situation."
The beleaguered prime minister was toppled
from power less than a month before he would
have become leader of the longest-lived of the 44
Italian governments since World War 11.
Cossiga accepted the Craxi government's res
ignation and said that he would begin consulting
leaders of Italy's political parties later today in
the first move toward creating a new govern
ment. Political observers in Rome said the most
likely outcome was that Cossiga would ask Craxi
early next week to make an effort to re-establish
a ruling coalition.
