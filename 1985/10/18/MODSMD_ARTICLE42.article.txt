# Economy Grows at 3.3 Percent Rate
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The economy
expanded at a 3.3 percent annual
pace in the third quarter as consu
mers and the federal government,
neither deterred by their record
debt burdens, spent well beyond
expectations, the Department of
Commerce said yesterday.
A buoyant White House said that
the figures suggested that the na
tion was poised for a new burst of
production and economic growth,
and several leading forecasters
agreed. Irwin Kellner, chief econo
mist for Manufacturers Hanover
Trust Co. in New York, said 1986
"is pretty much in the sock, and it
looks like a good year."

But more skeptical experts called
the third-quarter numbers a fluke,
pumped up by the federal govern
ment's end-of-fiscal-year spending
spree and by automakers' end-of
model-year distress sales.
The Department of Commerce's
other announcement yesterday —
that housing starts plunged in Sep
tember to their slowest pace in 11
months — only deepened their pes
simism.
The 3.3 percent expansion in the
gross national product — the total
value of the nation's goods and
services — was revised upward
from a 2.8 percent flash estimate
that the Department of Commerce

had issued last month. Added to the
skimpy 1.1 percent gross national
product growth in the first six
months, the third-quarter figures
raised the 1985 rate to a still
sluggish 1.8 percent.
The White House had predicted a
total 1985 gross national product
growth of 3 percent. Secretary of
Commerce Malcolm Baldridge said
yesterday that reaching that level
would be difficult.
White House spokesman Larry
Speakes said the new gross national
product figure showed the economy
"is clearly performing well. With in
ventories now at a very low level
and consumer demand very strong,

we expect a sharp increase in pro
duction and continued acceleration
of growth in the GNP."
Kellner said the third-quarter
growth stemmed partly from the
seven-month decline in the value of
the dollar, which has spurred fac
tory production by making Ameri
can exports cheaper to buy and
foreign imports more costly for
Americans to purchase. A drop in
inventories — mostly the sell-off of
1985 model cars — also contrib
uted.
But strong spending fueled most
of the expansion: Personal spend
ing rose 4.8 percent, while federal
spending soared 33.4 percent.
