Trade Plan Proposed
WASHINGTON — House Democrats,
claiming a large measure of credit for pushing
President Reagan to attack the large trade def
icit, yesterday proposed the broad outline of
trade legislation that attacks unfair trade
practices and ties a new round of global trade
talks to an international monetary conference.
In an apparent attempt by the Democrats to
avoid being labeled the party of protectionism,
their proposal avoids offering trade relief to
specific industries.
"We are happy as Democrats that we have
made the president stop sitting still and got
him to do something on trade," said Speaker
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill as he unveiled a
"Democratic Program on Trade."
Rep. Don Bonker (D-Wash.) chairman of the
special Democratic trade task force appointed
by O'Neill and House Majority Leader Jim
Wright (D-Texas) called his party's initiative
"far more detailed and comprehensive" than
trade packages put forward by either the White
House or House Republicans.
"We're trying to compose a responsible
course between the 'free trade at any social
cost' policies of Ronald Reagan and protec

tionism," said Rep. Donald Pease (D-Ohio).
Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Calif.) said the pro
posal is certain to win quick approval from the
House Democratic Caucus, which is trying to
develop trade as a political issue for the 1986
congressional elections. Coelho, head of the
House Democratic Campaign Committee, said
O'Neill has put trade legislation on a fast track,
which means an actual bill following the
outlines of the task force's program will be
drawn within weeks. But Bonker said he
doesn't expect any action on the proposals un
til next year.
Jury Convicts Morison
BALTIMORE — A federal court jury here
yesterday found former Navy intelligence
analyst Samuel Loring Morison guilty of
espionage and theft for leaking three spy
satellite photos that were classified secret to a
British magazine.
Morison, the 40-year-old grandson of the
late, famed naval historian Samuel Eliot
Morison, also was convicted on separate
espionage and theft charges for taking portions
of two other Navy documents, both classified

secret, and keeping them in an envelope at his
Crofton, Md., apartment.
It was the first time that anyone has been
convicted under the espionage statute for
leaking to the press documents "relating to the
national defense." Congress enacted the law in
1917.
Morison could be sentenced to up to 10
years in prison and a $10,000 fine on each of
the four counts. U.S. District Judge Joseph
Young said he will pass sentence on Nov. 25
and released Morison on the same $100,000
bond posted for him last year.
Mark Lynch, one of his attorneys and mem
ber of the American Civil Liberties Union, said
the verdict will be appealed. ACLU officials
have contended that a successful prosecution
in the Morison case poses a grave danger to
freedom of the press, at least insofar as
reporting on national security matters is con
cerned.
