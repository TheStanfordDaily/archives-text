Tampering Accusation
SAN DIEGO — The defense lawyer for
convicted Mayor Roger Hedgecock yesterday
filed a motion for a third trial for Hedgecock,
claiming that alleged jury tampering by a court
bailiff tainted the conviction.
Attorney Oscar Goodman also filed motions
to have the district attorney's office removed
from an investigation into the claims by two
jurors that they were pressured into reaching
a verdict.
A spokesman for the district attorney said
the office would stay on the case but said the
California Attorney General's office was called
in to investigate the tampering allegations.
Fire Damages Art
SAN MARINO — Fire climbed through an
elevator shaft yesterday at the Huntington Li
brary Art Gallery and Botanical Gardens,
heavily damaging a 208-year-old painting and
four pieces of antique furniture.
The fire at the Huntington Gallery, one of
two at the library complex, was reported at
12:09 a.m. when flames triggered an alarm,
said police officer Chris Peterson. Firefighters
from three communities doused the fire within

10 minutes.
"Mrs. Lascelles," a portrait painted by Sir
Joshua Reynolds in 1777, was extensively
damaged. It had been hung on a wall near the
elevator, said library spokeswoman Katherine
Wilson.
Wilson said yesterday afternoon that inves
tigators were working to determine the extent
of damages and the cause of the blaze.
The value of the painting was unknown be
cause it was purchased by railroad magnate
Henry Huntington in 1913 and has not been on
the market since.
Five Fires Still Blaze
LOS ANGELES — The loss of a Bentley
and a movie set boosted losses from a pair of
newly contained Malibu fires as firefighters
battled a 42,535-acre blaze yesterday that
threatened a Ventura County wildlife sanctu
ary.
Dozens of blazes swept by Santa Ana winds
have raced across 80,000 acres of dry brush in
Southern California since Monday, burning 23
homes, killing one man and injuring at least six
firefighters.
Five fires continued to burn yesterday, but
only the Ferndale-Wheeler Canyon fire, 60

miles northwest of Los Angeles, eluded efforts
at containment.
Using retardant-dropping aircraft, a dip in
temperatures, a rise in humidity and early
morning fog, firefighters tried to stop the
spread of the blaze as it approached the Sespe
Wildlife Sanctuary in the Los Padres National
Forest, said Ventura County Fire Department
spokeswoman Alison Schemberg.
Playmate Rips Hefner
LOS ANGELES — A former Playboy cen
terfold used a federal pornography hearing
yesterday to accuse Hugh Hefner of encourag
ing drug use and coercing Playmates into kinky
sex. A Hefner spokesman said she was lying in
order to promote an unsold book.
Miki Garcia, Playboy's Miss January 1973,
also alleged that Playmates "were involved in
an international call girl ring which had ties to
the Playboy Mansion."
Miss Garcia spoke on the second day of a
two-day hearing announced in May by U.S. At
torney General Edwin Meese, who instructed
the 11-member pornography commission to
conduct a year-long investigation of the
multibillion-dollar sex industry.
