# They Know It's Made in Japan

When Political Science Prof. Daniel Okimoto
got to the room where he holds his seminar on
Japan's political economy the first time this fall,
he was surprised to find 60 students waiting for
him.
"I was a little puzzled over the sudden surge,"
Okimoto recalled. Last year, the seminar drew
only 14 students.
After some reflection, however, Okimoto con
cluded that the increased interest in his seminar
probably indicated a growing U.S. interest in
Japanese affairs.
"I think that one obvious reason is that Japan
has leaped into the headlines," Okimoto ex
plained. "1 think people want to understand what
makes Japan tick."
Okimoto noted that Japan's increasing eco
nomic power makes it an interesting focus of
study.
"We are in the midst of a very important shift
in the locus of economic power from the Atlan
tic to the Pacific," he said. "Many people are still
unaware of this historic transition.
"There's quite a concern about the ebbing
economic power of our country," Okimoto ob
served. He continued, "The trade deficit that the
United States incurred with Japan was $37 billion
this past year, and this year it's expected to be
$50 billion."
According to Okimoto, Stanford's location

makes Japanese-related study especially appeal
ing.
"We are on the West Coast, and more than half
of U.S. trade with Japan is in California," he ex
plained. "The interdependence of this state and
Japan is greater than that of any other state.
"We really do have a lot at stake in our rela
tionship with Japan, as a country and as a state,"
Okimoto said.
As might be expected. Okimoto's seminar is
not the only Japan-related course to enjoy in
creased popularity. "My other class, Japanese
Foreign Policy, has also grown in enrollment,"
Okimoto said.
Sixty students are enrolled this year, a rise
from the approximately 30 students who studied
the issues of American/Japanese relations last
year.
Additionally, Japanese language classes have
been growing in popularity.
Prof. Himoshi Sakamoto, who has taught at
Stanford since 1967, has 85 students enrolled in
first-year Japanese this fall.
"The first year at Stanford, we had only 15 to
20 students," he recalled.
"Many people have started to study Japanese
for a pragmatic purpose," Sakamoto observed.
"Before, they wanted to study for an academic
purpose."
Senior Joe Henri, a resource development
major, hopes to use the skills he is learning in a
second-year Japanese class to help launch a
career in foreign trade.

"I'm from Alaska, where there's a lot of ex
port to Japan," Henri said.
Henri said he had an opportunity to travel in
Japan last summer, practicing his Japanese and
keeping on the lookout for possible business
developments.
"There are very few people in the United
States who you can just walk up to and talk to in
Japanese," he said.
East Asian studies major Gina Bertolino has
been interested in Japan since she was an ex
change student there for a year during high
school.
"It was just a certain liking for the culture that
just grabbed me," she said.
"There are a lot of people from the graduate
business school taking classes," Bertolino ob
served.
This surge in interest takes time to accommo
date. Okimoto had to turn students away this
year because the seminar is limited to 20 stu
dents.
"I would love to have taken all 60," Okimoto
said. "At some point, I may have to think about a
lecture class, if the level of interest is main
tained or if it grows."
An overseas campus in Japan is also under
consideration. "The campus would serve both
those interested in a social science exposure and
those with a background in engineering,"
Okimoto explained.
"If everything goes well, it may be open as
soon as 1987," he said.
