"Nicaragua today is a country at
war" bombarded by U.S.
"imperialist aggression of the most
massive sort," Political Science
Prof. Richard Fagen told 100
people in a speech at the School of
Education yesterday.
Fagen said there are two real
tragedies in Nicaragua today.
First, the fighting between con
tra rebels and the Sandinista gov

dead and seriously injured, he said.
Second, the war economy the
Sandinistas face has eliminated the
possibility that their "ideal" govern

mixed economy and a non-aligned
foreign policy — will ever come

Nicaragua's economy goes to

"The approximately 15,000 con

been promised over $100 million by
Congress in validated aid and . . .
perhaps double that amount under

the table," Fagen said.
Fagen said he does not foresee
any possibility that the Reagan Ad
ministration will change its policy
toward Nicaragua. "They won't
give this one up . . . socialism is not
legitimate" to the current U.S. gov
ernment, he said.
He added that "Congress is roll
ing over and allowing the Reagan
Administration to do what it
wants."
Education Prof. Martin Carnoy
introduced Fagen, telling the crowd
that Fagen had "played a very im
portant role convincing the Carter
Administration not to intervene in
Nicaragua in 1978-79."
Fagen was in Nicaragua during
four weeks of the revolution and is
currently writing a book about the
revolution.
The U.S. Marines originally
landed in Nicaragua in 1912 and
remained until 1933, when a
peasant uprising led by Agosto San
dino forced them to pull out. The
