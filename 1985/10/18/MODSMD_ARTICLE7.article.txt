# Prof. Fagen Talks About Sandinistas

### KAREN MARANGI 
"Nicaragua today is a country at
war" bombarded by U.S.
"imperialist aggression of the most
massive sort," Political Science
Prof. Richard Fagen told 100
people in a speech at the School of
Education yesterday.
Fagen said there are two real
tragedies in Nicaragua today.
First, the fighting between con
tra rebels and the Sandinista gov
ernment has resulted in 10,000
dead and seriously injured, he said.
Second, the war economy the
Sandinistas face has eliminated the
possibility that their "ideal" govern
ment — with political pluralism, a
mixed economy and a non-aligned
foreign policy — will ever come
about, he said. Forty percent of
Nicaragua's economy goes to
defense, he added.
"The approximately 15,000 con
tras under arms have received or
been promised over $100 million by
Congress in validated aid and . . .
perhaps double that amount under

the table," Fagen said.
Fagen said he does not foresee
any possibility that the Reagan Ad
ministration will change its policy
toward Nicaragua. "They won't
give this one up . . . socialism is not
legitimate" to the current U.S. gov
ernment, he said.
He added that "Congress is roll
ing over and allowing the Reagan
Administration to do what it
wants."
Education Prof. Martin Carnoy
introduced Fagen, telling the crowd
that Fagen had "played a very im
portant role convincing the Carter
Administration not to intervene in
Nicaragua in 1978-79."
Fagen was in Nicaragua during
four weeks of the revolution and is
currently writing a book about the
revolution.
The U.S. Marines originally
landed in Nicaragua in 1912 and
remained until 1933, when a
peasant uprising led by Agosto San
dino forced them to pull out. The
U.S. government helped put Anastazio Somoza Garcia
in power, and his family remained the ruling family until
the revolution in July 1979, when the Somoza dynasty
was overthrown by the Sandinista Front of National
Revolution (FSLN).
The United States always acted favorably toward
Nicaragua as there was "not a stronger anti-communist
bastion in Latin America than Somoza's regime,"
Fagen said.
Fagen said the fight between the FSLN and Somoza's
U.S.-backed National Guard left the country with a
$1.6 billion debt, $5 billion worth of physical damage to
the country and only $3 million in its central bank —
Somoza had stolen the rest before fleeing to Florida.
The new Nicaraguan government had three main
slogans which "were not just words ... but deeply felt
tenets," Fagen said. The first goal was "political
pluralism," as the FSLN intended to provide space in
the government for all groups and classes except those
"publicly associated with Somoza" who were dubbed
"Nicaraguan Nazis."
Another goal was a "mixed economy," achieved
primarily by gaining the land previously owned by the
Somozas. This alone increased the country's produc
tion capacity by 25 percent, according to Fagen.
"The orientation of the regime is frankly socialist,"
Fagen said.
The speech was part of the Central America Crisis
series co-sponsored by the Center for Latin American
Studies and SIDEC, the Student International Devel
opment Education Committee.
