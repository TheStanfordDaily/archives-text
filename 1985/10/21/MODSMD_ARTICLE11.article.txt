## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Book Is Misleading 
### 
The 20-page pamphlet entitled "Stanford and
South Africa," recently distributed to every on
campus resident, has provoked well-founded
criticism throughout the community. The University
has shown disrespect for its professors and scholars
by failing to invest the time and effort needed to
produce a quality product.
The University not only failed to consult ade
quately those who favor divestment, but did not
consult any of the scores of Africanist scholars on
campus, including the African and Afro-American
Studies Program and the Stanford/Berkeley Joint
Center on African Studies.
The result is numerous factual errors and mis
representations of history, such as those that ap
pear in the section, "A Brief History of South Africa
and Apartheid." Characteristic of these errors is the
insulting reference to black South African ethnic
groups by the archaic terms "Hottentot" and
"Bushmen" â€” terms that most current scholarly
texts have replaced with the indigenous Khoikhoi
and San.

While these and other errors are inexcusable,
what is more alarming is the general tone of the
pamphlet and the way in which it was put together.
Through carelessness and lack of consultation,
the writers of the booklet have fallen victim to the
very presentation of history the Pretorian govern
ment uses to justify apartheid. The booklet appears
to have further polarized the issue. This could have
been avoided.
Diana Diamond, assistant to the vice president for
Public Affairs, one of the primary writers of the
pamphlet, cannot be held entirely accountable. She
merely did what she was asked to do: put together
an informational pamphlet on the divestment issue in
a week and a half.
In addition, the assumptions implicit in issuing
such a booklet are alarming. The most dangerous is
that the administration is the only faction with the
right or ability to present all sides of an issue. What
happened to the often-touted need for debate to in
spire informed opinions? Clearly this pamphlet can
not contribute to such a debate.
