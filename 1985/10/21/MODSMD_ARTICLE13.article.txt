# The
						New Ma Bell Tolls for Thee
## 
### 
It all started last week when I tried to call my
mom long distance. You see, I had just gotten
my phone connected the day before. I didn't
know any new long distance procedures — I
didn't even know my new phone number. So I
dialed one, my mom's number, and waited for an
answer.
"HiMa!" I shouted.
"BEEP BOOP BEEP. You need to use a long
distance company code. Please contact the long
distance company of your choice."
"Ma, who's that?"
"Most companies are listed in the yellow
pages under 'telephone communication services'
or 'telephone companies.' " Click.

I couldn't figure out what was going on. I
didn't have a "long distance company code," and
I didn't have the yellow pages either. So I called
the operator and explained the mess I was in. He
told me that my telephone company, AT&T, had
broken up into eight different companies back in
1984. The original company now handled long
distance calling only; the seven smaller corpora
tions were in charge of local communications.
The AT&T people did this because they wanted
to serve their customers in the most efficient
and personal way possible. They also wanted to
expand into the data processing field — a move
the courts would not approve as long as AT&T
remained the largest corporate monopoly in the
world.
"Before our divestiture in 1984," the operator
said proudly, "AT&T controlled enough tele
phone wire to stretch to the sun and back six
times or around the world 46,000 times."
"Fine," I said, "but my mom only lives 700
miles away. Now please put me through."
That annoyed him, I think, and he curtly sug
gested I contact a specific long distance company
like Sprint or MCI because, as of last summer,
the government does not allow AT&T to auto
matically take charge of a one's long distance
calls. Even if I chose to use AT&T, I could not
simply dial "1" — I would have to dial a five-digit
access code. This was really only fair, he said,

since AT&T was being so nice about govern
ment regulation and all.
Soon the idea of several phone companies
competing for my business excited me. Hadn't
AT&T's monopoly been swindling me for 21
years? Would I show them. I started learning all I
could about the newly liberated long distance
telephone services. I clipped articles from The
Daily. I read brochures. I spoke with operators
and on-line computers. I discovered names like
ITT, SBS, MCI, U.S. Telephone, Telesaverand
Pace-Net. I even found a government service
called "Checkbook" which claims it can find you
the cheapest rates around for a $30 fee. And you
know, there really wasn't much difference be
tween any of the companies. All of them claimed
rates 20 to 30 percent lower than AT&T's. And
all of them had names that were either silly or in
comprehensible to the average consumer.
The company I finally picked tapped into my
phone line about 10 days later. They sent me all
kinds of things to make my phone calls more fun.

No amount of careful research, secret codes or special
discounts was going to help me outfox the severed
remains of AT&T.

I got a fancy instruction manual, a book of
colored stickers to remind me of important num
bers and a flimsy paper card with a smudged
number on it. They called that number my
"secret code." But as soon as I tried to call
home, I heard the same "BEEP BOOP
BEEP. ..." This time, I called the service
operator and used my most intimidating tele
phone voice.
"0.K., sir," she said patiently, "Did you type
in your access code?"
"Access code?" I said, "I don't need an access
code. I just need to type 'I.' "
"No, that's the old way. Before you dial your
number, you punch in your four-digit access
code, and then your 10-digit authorization code.
And then..."
"A 10-digit authorization code?" I demanded.
"You could issue three codes to every person in
the world with that many numbers!"
"Well, of course, we do plan to expand our
services to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands

sometime next fall. After all, we have to com
pete. AT&T might be losing money on long dis
tance calls, but their corporate offspring have
been raising local rates by nearly 20 percent."
"I thought AT&T's divestiture took care of all
that," I said. "It's an economic law: Breaking up
a, monopoly results in more competition, and
more competition means lower rates for the con
sumer. Right?"
"Look, honey, when Bell Telephone was one
huge company, they could keep local rates down
and make up the difference by overcharging big
businesses for long distance calls. Now we have
free competition, and big businesses can make
deals with cheaper phone services. Some are
even building their own lines. AT&T can't afford
to subsidize residential callers anymore. That's
why Pacific Bell is raising your rates and your in
stallment costs. Why do you think it costs 20
cents to use a pay phone now?"
"You mean I've got your flashy manual, your
secret card and a 10-digit access code, and the

phone companies are still taking advantage of
me?"
"Oh, you might save a little bit. All things con
sidered, the Consumer Price Index shows your
total costs will decline about 4 percent if you
watch your long distance calls. Eventually, this
new competition will prompt faster growth in
communications technology, too. But the quality
of your long distance service will probably go
down until the new, smaller phone companies
can apply that technology. Now you have a nice
day, sir. My Sanka's getting cold." Click.
As usual, a telephone operator had told me
something that would have been better left un
said. No amount of careful research, secret
codes or special discounts was going to help me
outfox the severed remains of AT&T. "Alas," I
thought, "never send to know for whom Ma Bell
tolls. She tolls for thee."
