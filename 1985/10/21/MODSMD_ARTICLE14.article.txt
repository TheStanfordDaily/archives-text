## Send Views for Updated Divestment Pamphlet 
### 
Shortly after the start of fall quarter, the Of
fice of Public Affairs published a pamphlet,
"Stanford and South Africa." The purpose, as
stated in the booklet, was to provide students
with an admittedly brief background to an issue
receiving attention on campuses nationwide.
In undertaking the pamphlet, we knew ahead
of time that any material included in such a
publication on South Africa would be open to

VIEWPOINT

criticism from both ends of the political spec
trum, for South Africa is the subject of much
debate. Nevertheless, we decided to go ahead
because we thought the booklet could be in
formative to some students, particularly those
new to our campus.
As editor of the publication, I must say I tried
to be as fair as I could. ,
The publication has been criticized by some as
being too pro-divestment, and others have
charged that it is too anti-divestment. Some
have even called it the University's "propaganda
piece for apartheid."
There have been assertions that the publica
tion is replete with errors. Others have said the

errors were only in the section on South Africa's
history. Some have said the "errors" are really
only outdated information.
Our historical sources included two en
cyclopedias, two almanacs and an array of other
publications. In each instance, the identical ma
terial was found in at least two and usually three
of our four primary sources. In the two instances
where we could not verify the same material in
three different places, we cited our sources
(Fortune magazine and the The Wall Street Jour
nal).
We also tried to contact three faculty mem
bers who are experts on South Africa. Two of
them were out of town during the limited period
we had before meeting our printer's deadline,
and the third did not answer several calls.
We sincerely regret any factual errors that
may have occurred. They certainly were not in
tentional.
There also was reference in the pamphlet to
the availability of more detailed materials
compiled by Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons. "South African Divestiture Activities at
Stanford University 1984-1985 — Selected
Background Papers and Documents" contains
copies of many published statements relating to

South Africa issues — including statements from
Stanford Out of South Africa.
We have also heard that our publication is
highly readable and impartial. The pamphlet was
intended only as a primer — not as a lengthy
thesis. It is somewhat disappointing that the
pamphlet itself has become an issue on campus,
rather than the problems in South Africa.
We are encouraged that — as we intended —
the pamphlet has stimulated discussion and even
controversy. We think we ought to help continue
the discussion and response to the South Africa
issue. Accordingly, we propose to publish a sup
plement that will allow the debate to continue.
We encourage students and faculty members to
send views on what is happening in South Africa
and what the University's response should be.
Please send them by Nov. 1 and address them to
South Africa Supplement, News and Publica
tions, Press Courtyard, Stanford. We will have a
special newsprint publication containing a collec
tion of these thoughts, perhaps with an oc
casional editor's note. We ask that each submis
sion be signed and that you limit your statements
to between 750 and 1,000 words.

dent for Public Affairs.)
