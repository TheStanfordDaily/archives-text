Protesters Won't
Face the SJC
I am writing to clarify the matter
of whether students involved in the
Old Union sit-ins of Oct. 11, 14
and 16 will face campus judicial
charges.
They will not be charged.
There is a likelihood, however,
that students who participate in
such events in the future will face
campus judicial charges. Decisions
on whether to charge will be made,
as always, in light of all relevant
circumstances, including considera
tion of the cumulative effect on the
University of a series of disrup
tions. In the event that charges are
brought, participation in prior dis
ruptions, even if not prosecuted by
the University, may be a factor in
determining individual penalties.
If there are any questions about
the relevant policies or procedures
for their enforcement, you may
contact me or Sally Cole, the Uni
versity judicial officer.

In response to the letter "Glass
in Pizza, Saga to Blame" (The
Daily, Oct. 7), we, the Corner
Pocket managers, would like to
inform all concerned individuals of
the methods and measures we
take in preparing our products.
Our pizza is made by hand. The
sauce comes in pre-mixed cans,
and we add spices from covered
containers. Our cheese arrives
enveloped in plastic and boxed.
The packages are opened, emptied

into a plastic bowl and then cov- C'
ered with plastic if the cheese is
not being used. Our meat toppings
are sealed in heavy plastic
packages, and our freshly cut
vegetable toppings are stored in
covered plastic tubs. Both meat ;!
and vegetable toppings are placed J
on shelves in cold-storage
facilities. Our dough is made from>
scratch every several hours. The •
ingredients for the pizza crust are 1
taken from either sealed containers
of food or large, steel-covered ■'
bins. From the formation of the >
crust to the spooning of the sauce/
from the measuring of cheese, to\
the adding of meat and vegetable »!
toppings, the entire process is
completely supervised and done by
hand. [•
All employees are trained to $
take care in ensuring the health %
and safety of the customer. In fact;
the pizza in question was made by
one of the managers. Our
employees, from pizza chef to
yogurt server to cashier, take
special pride in the products we
prepare and serve. And we refuse
to serve our customers any prod
uct we feel to be inferior in quality.
We store our products sealed
and covered when not in use, and
any item received with a broken
seal is returned to the distributor.
We try our best to ensure quality,
satisfaction and safety for our
employees and customers. We
regret that any problem occurred
with our pizza product, and we
invite everyone to come to the
Corner Pocket and try our product
to decide for himself the quality
and care we take with each pizza.
