# Profs. To See USSR TV
## Dorms expected to get reception by early next year 
### ELAINE RIGGS 
Stanford professors will be able
to watch Soviet television coverage
of the U.S.-Soviet summit in No
vember, thanks to a satellite
receiving system developed by
graduate student Stuart Neubarth.
Students may also be able to
watch Soviet TV, although the sys
tem won't be ready for them by No
vember. "By early next year, I ex
pect to have the system on the
campus cable TV network,"
Neubarth said. "The dorms will be
able to watch it."
Neubarth developed the
prototype receiver in the spring of
1983. He is now working under
contract to the University to
develop a larger, advanced system.
The new system "will not be
working before the end of the
year," according to Neubarth, be
cause a site for the necessary 16-
foot radar dish has not been found.
"The problem is to have permission
and satisfy the technical require
ments. . . . It's a bit of a mess," he
said.

Using the old system installed in
1983, professors expect to see a
side of the Soviet Union different
from the one projected by the inter
national media and Soviet news
bureaus for foreign perusal.
"Soviet attitudes are like wine â€”
they don't travel well," said Prof.
Richard Schupbach, chairman of the
Department of Slavic Languages
and Literatures. "It's very difficult
to create a Soviet atmosphere
anywhere except there.
"There is a slangy kind of Rus
sian that's only heard there,"
Schupbach continued. "By listening
to their TV we'll really hear it."
Other professors are interested
in the Soviet entertainment pro
grams. "They had a spy story last
year in which the CIA was 'the bad
guys,' " said Communications Prof.
Henry Breitrose. "There is a ter
rific opportunity to find out what
kinds of people are heroes and vil
lains to the Russians."
Neubarth doesn't believe that
"there will be any legal problems
(related to attaching his system to
campus cable TV) because the Uni

versity is private property," he
said. "But UC-Berkeley is inter
ested in our tapes and selling those
to Berkeley might cause legal prob
lems."
The main question is "whether
the Soviets would be upset,"
Neubarth explained. "They do have
a copyright, ... but they have so
much of our copyrighted material."
Neubarth began work on the
satellite-receiving system when he
was a freshman at Serra in 1978.
He built a receiver to decode Home
Box Office broadcasts for the dorm
TV set.
Pirating Soviet television broad
casts proved to be more of a chal
lenge. U.S. communications
satellites orbit above the equator
and can "see" the entire Northern
Hemisphere, making it possible to
intercept Soviet broadcasts.
Neubarth is now director of com
munications for Serra Systems,
Inc., a company he co-founded that
plans to market technologies
related to the satellite-receiving
system.
