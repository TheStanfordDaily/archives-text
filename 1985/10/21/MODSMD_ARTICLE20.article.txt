## Alcohol and Drugs on the Farm: Students Claim Freedom To Drink 
### CHARLES SEAVEY Staff writer 
Almost every Stanford undergraduate feels
responsible enough to make a personal decision
about alcohol, but the response was varied when
students talked about peer behavior regarding
intoxicating substances in an informal survey
conducted by The Daily.
While some said certain groups behave more
responsibly than others around alcohol, all those
surveyed agree that people over 18 years of age
, at least have the right to drink.
Many students viewed the new rules issued by
the Office of Residential Education as a negative
trend, taking away student freedom of choice.
Several RAs and students felt that the new
rules against drinking games undermined the
student's sense of responsibility for making deci
sions and rendered RAs more inaccessible by
turning them into figures of authority.
Others, however, observed that University
policy is too liberal and vague, especially when
groups such as fraternities are expected to be
responsible not only for their own members, but
for the students who attend their parties as well.
Are Students Responsible?
Freshman Pia Keagy
"Oh yes, the majority are responsible. Most
Stanford students are responsible when they
arrive, and there's not much peer pressure here
to influence them otherwise."
Senior Eugene Harris, president of Kappa Sigma
fraternity
"As a senior, yes (I am responsible); as a
freshman, no. Peer pressure is very dominant
here."
An anonymous senior
"I think that most Stanford students are re
sponsible enough to handle alcohol, with the ex
ception of the guys up in the fraternities who
tend to be pretty immature."
Sophomore Mike O'Dell
"Generally, students are responsible with al
cohol. But then you have examples of frats with
the brothers lying all over the place.
"I think trying to control it isn't the right ap
proach.
"Notre Dame was a campus just like ours — a
drink your age policy. They outlawed drinking,
and there was rioting on campus, but it stuck.
Now, parties still go on, but they're not so huge.
I have a friend who tells me people still get drunk
all the time.
"College life is when you're supposed to learn
that stuff."
An anonymous fraternity member
"I know that at least all the members of this
fraternity are responsible enough. Whether or
not that holds true for the rest of the campus, I
don't know."
Perspectives on the Policy
Students were also asked for their opinions on
the University's drinking policy, whether it is too
liberal or too strict and what changes they would
suggest, if any.
Most responded that the policy is fairly liberal,
and rightly so.
Eugene Harris
"Let's face it. You can drink under age for free
anywhere, and usually without interference from
the University or the police. That's pretty
liberal. And that kind of an atmosphere is appro
priate for a place like Stanford."
Sophomore David Lee
"I don't go to that many parties that have alco
hol. I made a decision not to drink. The equally
attractive, non-alcoholic alternative is a good
policy. If you legalize drinking but also have the
alternative, it takes a little of the pressure off
having to drink.
"It doesn't create a really awkward situation.
You can stand there with a cup in your hand and
still not drink.
"There's much less pressure to drink here
than in other places I've been. Some people are
offended when I tell them I don't drink; they ask
me why not. But most people respect my deci
sion.
"I don't try to tell other people not to drink,
either. That's somebody's personal decision."

Too Strict?
Many students expressed concern, however,
that the drinking policy has become increasingly
conservative over the last few years.
Even students who do not drink agreed that
the increasing number of alcohol-related rules is
a negative trend.
The underlying thought in student response
seemed to be that excess regulation of student
conduct takes away individual responsibilty and
makes student decisions and actions resemble
the simple game of getting away with things
without getting caught.

'If the alcohol policy ap
plied only to people in our
frat, it'd be too restrictive,
but when we as fraterni
ties are responsible for
other people, there must
be more and clearer
rules.'

Beta Theta Pi member and senior
"The only rule (regarding alcohol) there was in
my freshman year was 'no flaming shots.'
"There are definitely more rules now, and it's
bad that the University is making decisions for
the students."
Sophomore Scott Garner
"The original policy said we were responsible
enough to handle drinking. The new one says we
don't have that responsibility. I mean, you can
still go out and get drunk, but they just don't
want you to do it in certain ways, like with drink
ing games. It's kind of hypocritical."
It's Not Fun and Games Any More
Student opinion focused on the "no drinking
games" rule for University residences.
Freshman Bill Harris
"I think drinking games should be allowed.
Drinking games are fun, and they are just that —
games. I can understand how the school would
want them played behind closed doors, but I
can't see outlawing them."
An anonymous sophomore
"That RAs have to break up drinking games is
ridiculous. It just takes away everyone's sense
of self-responsibility."
Freshman Carol Wang
Wang said she thought the alcohol policy in
general is "fair and very clear," but she also des
cribed a "double standard" in the regulation con
cerning drinking games and the way the Univer
sity has urged fraternities to "leave freshmen
alone" during autumn quarter.
"The University tells us, 'make your own
decisions,' and yet they set up these rules and
baby us. And with the drinking-game rule,
they've set up another double standard. The
RAs tell you, We won't be policemen,' and yet
the University is now forcing them to be."
An anonymous RA and senior
"The drinking game rule complicates the RA's
role. It's hard for people to know whether you're
breaking up their drinking game as an RA or as
another student. It puts RAs in an authority posi
tion and makes them seem much less easy to
talk to.
"You see, I really agree with the alcohol
policy; that alcohol shouldn't be the focus of an
event is very positive. I think that the University
feels that this is just a logical extension of that
policy.
"In addition, I think there are some legal con
siderations involved. So I understand the
reasons for the new policy. It's just that in
practice it has made people feel antagonistic
toward Residential Education and sometimes
even toward RAs."
RA Elsie Wang
"I see the good intention on the drinking game
policy. They're not just out to get us.
"Ultimately, we (RAs) can't stop people.
They're consenting adults. We can just ask

them. We can't go in and beat them over the
heads with the policy.
"I think the policy is to make us think about
drinking more responsibly."
Or Maybe Too Liberal?
Some students, however, said they think the
alcohol policy is not strict enough.
Brett Monello, senior, president of Phi Delia
Theta
"If the alcohol policy applied only to people in
our frat, it'd be too restrictive, but when we as
fraternities are responsible for other people,
there must be more and clearer rules."
Monello said he feels strongly that the present
alcohol policy is both "inadequate" and "vague,"
affording a "major double standard" in the way it
is enforced.
"Technically, we've been handled fairly. And
yet last weekend, Serra House had a party called
'Blow Chow.' Now that's certainly an alcohol
focused event.
"Tell me, did they get in trouble? People have
this basic misconception that all fraternity guys
are irresponsible."
Sophomore Louis Vu
"If there's no active enforcement, then
no point in putting up rules. Contrary to what the
University would like to think, for students, par
ties and alcohol are synonymous."
Rick Kelly, a member of Kappa Sigma
"The same sort of things happen at dorm pat;-
ties as happen at fraternity parties, and nothing
is ever said to them. It seems like they keep a
closer watch on frats."
Eugene Harris
"We go along thinking we're doing what we'te
supposed to do, and then all of a sudden, the
University jumps on someone."
The SAE Decision
One action that was criticized by many stu
dents both in and out of the fraternities was ReSr
idential Education's charges against the SAE fra
ternity for its "irresponsibility and lack of
cooperation with police" during a party at the fra;
ternity early this quarter.

'Residential Education cer
♦
tainly does a rotten job of -':
hiding their distaste for
fraternities. It takes a real:
politician like Donald Ken
nedy to hate a group and
act like he likes them.'

An anonymous fraternity member
"The police report misrepresented what was
going on at the party in the first place, and then
(Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs) Norm Robinson
went even farther and exaggerated the report in
his letter. We were put on [probation] before all
of this was investigated, before we were even
talked to — guilty until proven innocent. Norm
Robinson was out of line to sign evidence he
hadn't verified."
An anonymous sophomore
"Residential Education certainly does a rotten
job of hiding their distaste for fraternities. It
takes a real politician like [University President]
Donald Kennedy to hate a group and act like he
likes them. Res Ed has got some work to do."
Observations Without Conclusions
Clearly, the alcohol policy issue involves both
the rules themselves and their enforcement.
One junior observed, "Such rules and such
trends in their enforcement are not formulated in
a vacuum. On the contrary, they are long-term
direct and indirect responses to the attitudes and
actions of the students.
"We need to spend more time asking our
selves why and how we want to use alcohol in
the first place. I may be biased, but I think that if
we all did that more often, the use of alcohol
here at Stanford would fall dramatically."

drink your age policy. They outlawed drinking,
and there was rioting on campus, but it stuck.
Now, parties still go on, but they're not so huge.
I have a friend who tells me people still get drunk
all the time.
"College life is when you're supposed to learn
that stuff."
An anonymous fraternity member
"I know that at least all the members of this
fraternity are responsible enough. Whether or
not that holds true for the rest of the campus, I
don't know."
Perspectives on the Policy
Students were also asked for their opinions on
the University's drinking policy, whether it is too
liberal or too strict and what changes they would
suggest, if any.
Most responded that the policy is fairly liberal,
and rightly so.
Eugene Harris
"Let's face it. You can drink under age for free
anywhere, and usually without interference from
the University or the police. That's pretty
liberal. And that kind of an atmosphere is appro
priate for a place like Stanford."
Sophomore David Lee
"I don't go to that many parties that have alco
hol. I made a decision not to drink. The equally
attractive, non-alcoholic alternative is a good
policy. If you legalize drinking but also have the
alternative, it takes a little of the pressure off
having to drink.
"It doesn't create a really awkward situation.
You can stand there with a cup in your hand and
still not drink.
"There's much less pressure to drink here
than in other places I've been. Some people are
offended when I tell them I don't drink; they ask
me why not. But most people respect my deci
sion.
"I don't try to tell other people not to drink,
either. That's somebody's personal decision."

Too Strict?
Many students expressed concern, however,
that the drinking policy has become increasingly
conservative over the last few years.
Even students who do not drink agreed that
the increasing number of alcohol-related rules is
a negative trend.
The underlying thought in student response
seemed to be that excess regulation of student
conduct takes away individual responsibilty and
makes student decisions and actions resemble
the simple game of getting away with things
without getting caught.

'If the alcohol policy ap
plied only to people in our
frat, it'd be too restrictive,
but when we as fraterni
ties are responsible for
other people, there must
be more and clearer
rules.'

Beta Theta Pi member and senior
"The only rule (regarding alcohol) there was in
my freshman year was 'no flaming shots.'
"There are definitely more rules now, and it's
bad that the University is making decisions for
the students."
Sophomore Scott Garner
"The original policy said we were responsible
enough to handle drinking. The new one says we
don't have that responsibility. I mean, you can
still go out and get drunk, but they just don't
want you to do it in certain ways, like with drink
ing games. It's kind of hypocritical."
It's Not Fun and Games Any More
Student opinion focused on the "no drinking
games" rule for University residences.
Freshman Bill Harris
"I think drinking games should be allowed.
Drinking games are fun, and they are just that —
games. I can understand how the school would
want them played behind closed doors, but I
can't see outlawing them."
An anonymous sophomore
"That RAs have to break up drinking games is
ridiculous. It just takes away everyone's sense
of self-responsibility."
Freshman Carol Wang
Wang said she thought the alcohol policy in
general is "fair and very clear," but she also des
cribed a "double standard" in the regulation con
cerning drinking games and the way the Univer
sity has urged fraternities to "leave freshmen
alone" during autumn quarter.
"The University tells us, 'make your own
decisions,' and yet they set up these rules and
baby us. And with the drinking-game rule,
they've set up another double standard. The
RAs tell you, We won't be policemen,' and yet
the University is now forcing them to be."
An anonymous RA and senior
"The drinking game rule complicates the RA's
role. It's hard for people to know whether you're
breaking up their drinking game as an RA or as
another student. It puts RAs in an authority posi
tion and makes them seem much less easy to
talk to.
"You see, I really agree with the alcohol
policy; that alcohol shouldn't be the focus of an
event is very positive. I think that the University
feels that this is just a logical extension of that
policy.
"In addition, I think there are some legal con
siderations involved. So I understand the
reasons for the new policy. It's just that in
practice it has made people feel antagonistic
toward Residential Education and sometimes
even toward RAs."
RA Elsie Wang
"I see the good intention on the drinking game
policy. They're not just out to get us.
"Ultimately, we (RAs) can't stop people.
They're consenting adults. We can just ask

them. We can't go in and beat them over the
heads with the policy.
"I think the policy is to make us think about
drinking more responsibly."
Or Maybe Too Liberal?
Some students, however, said they think the
alcohol policy is not strict enough.
Brett Monello, senior, president of Phi Delia
Theta
"If the alcohol policy applied only to people in
our frat, it'd be too restrictive, but when we as
fraternities are responsible for other people,
there must be more and clearer rules."
Monello said he feels strongly that the present
alcohol policy is both "inadequate" and "vague,"
affording a "major double standard" in the way it
is enforced.
"Technically, we've been handled fairly. And
yet last weekend, Serra House had a party called
'Blow Chow.' Now that's certainly an alcohol
focused event.
"Tell me, did they get in trouble? People have
this basic misconception that all fraternity guys
are irresponsible."
Sophomore Louis Vu
"If there's no active enforcement, then
no point in putting up rules. Contrary to what the
University would like to think, for students, par
ties and alcohol are synonymous."
Rick Kelly, a member of Kappa Sigma
"The same sort of things happen at dorm pat;-
ties as happen at fraternity parties, and nothing
is ever said to them. It seems like they keep a
closer watch on frats."
Eugene Harris
"We go along thinking we're doing what we'te
supposed to do, and then all of a sudden, the
University jumps on someone."
The SAE Decision
One action that was criticized by many stu
dents both in and out of the fraternities was ReSr
idential Education's charges against the SAE fra
ternity for its "irresponsibility and lack of
cooperation with police" during a party at the fra;
ternity early this quarter.

'Residential Education cer
♦
tainly does a rotten job of -':
hiding their distaste for
fraternities. It takes a real:
politician like Donald Ken
nedy to hate a group and
act like he likes them.'

An anonymous fraternity member
"The police report misrepresented what was
going on at the party in the first place, and then
(Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs) Norm Robinson
went even farther and exaggerated the report in
his letter. We were put on [probation] before all
of this was investigated, before we were even
talked to — guilty until proven innocent. Norm
Robinson was out of line to sign evidence he
hadn't verified."
An anonymous sophomore
"Residential Education certainly does a rotten
job of hiding their distaste for fraternities. It
takes a real politician like [University President]
Donald Kennedy to hate a group and act like he
likes them. Res Ed has got some work to do."
Observations Without Conclusions
Clearly, the alcohol policy issue involves both
the rules themselves and their enforcement.
One junior observed, "Such rules and such
trends in their enforcement are not formulated in
a vacuum. On the contrary, they are long-term
direct and indirect responses to the attitudes and
actions of the students.
"We need to spend more time asking our
selves why and how we want to use alcohol in
the first place. I may be biased, but I think that if
we all did that more often, the use of alcohol
here at Stanford would fall dramatically."
Almost every Stanford undergraduate feels
responsible enough to make a personal decision
about alcohol, but the response was varied when
students talked about peer behavior regarding
intoxicating substances in an informal survey
conducted by The Daily.
While some said certain groups behave more
responsibly than others around alcohol, all those
surveyed agree that people over 18 years of age
, at least have the right to drink.
Many students viewed the new rules issued by
the Office of Residential Education as a negative
trend, taking away student freedom of choice.
Several RAs and students felt that the new
rules against drinking games undermined the
student's sense of responsibility for making deci
sions and rendered RAs more inaccessible by
turning them into figures of authority.
Others, however, observed that University
policy is too liberal and vague, especially when
groups such as fraternities are expected to be
responsible not only for their own members, but
for the students who attend their parties as well.
Are Students Responsible?
Freshman Pia Keagy
"Oh yes, the majority are responsible. Most
Stanford students are responsible when they
arrive, and there's not much peer pressure here
to influence them otherwise."
Senior Eugene Harris, president of Kappa Sigma
fraternity
"As a senior, yes (I am responsible); as a
freshman, no. Peer pressure is very dominant
here."
An anonymous senior
"I think that most Stanford students are re
sponsible enough to handle alcohol, with the ex
ception of the guys up in the fraternities who
tend to be pretty immature."
Sophomore Mike O'Dell
"Generally, students are responsible with al
cohol. But then you have examples of frats with
the brothers lying all over the place.
"I think trying to control it isn't the right ap
proach.

that the drinking policy has become increasingly
conservative over the last few years.
Even students who do not drink agreed that
the increasing number of alcohol-related rules is
a negative trend.
The underlying thought in student response
seemed to be that excess regulation of student
conduct takes away individual responsibilty and
makes student decisions and actions resemble
the simple game of getting away with things
without getting caught.

'If the alcohol policy ap
plied only to people in our
frat, it'd be too restrictive,
but when we as fraterni
ties are responsible for
other people, there must
be more and clearer
rules.'

Beta Theta Pi member and senior
"The only rule (regarding alcohol) there was in
my freshman year was 'no flaming shots.'
"There are definitely more rules now, and it's
bad that the University is making decisions for
the students."
Sophomore Scott Garner
"The original policy said we were responsible
enough to handle drinking. The new one says we
don't have that responsibility. I mean, you can
still go out and get drunk, but they just don't
want you to do it in certain ways, like with drink
ing games. It's kind of hypocritical."
It's Not Fun and Games Any More
Student opinion focused on the "no drinking
games" rule for University residences.
Freshman Bill Harris
"I think drinking games should be allowed.
Drinking games are fun, and they are just that —
games. I can understand how the school would
want them played behind closed doors, but I
can't see outlawing them."
An anonymous sophomore
"That RAs have to break up drinking games is
ridiculous. It just takes away everyone's sense
of self-responsibility."
Freshman Carol Wang
Wang said she thought the alcohol policy in
general is "fair and very clear," but she also des
cribed a "double standard" in the regulation con
cerning drinking games and the way the Univer
sity has urged fraternities to "leave freshmen
alone" during autumn quarter.
"The University tells us, 'make your own
decisions,' and yet they set up these rules and
baby us. And with the drinking-game rule,
they've set up another double standard. The
RAs tell you, We won't be policemen,' and yet
the University is now forcing them to be."
An anonymous RA and senior
"The drinking game rule complicates the RA's
role. It's hard for people to know whether you're
breaking up their drinking game as an RA or as
another student. It puts RAs in an authority posi
tion and makes them seem much less easy to
talk to.
"You see, I really agree with the alcohol
policy; that alcohol shouldn't be the focus of an
event is very positive. I think that the University
feels that this is just a logical extension of that
policy.
"In addition, I think there are some legal con
siderations involved. So I understand the
reasons for the new policy. It's just that in
practice it has made people feel antagonistic
toward Residential Education and sometimes
even toward RAs."
RA Elsie Wang
"I see the good intention on the drinking game
policy. They're not just out to get us.
"Ultimately, we (RAs) can't stop people.
They're consenting adults. We can just ask

them. We can't go in and beat them over the
heads with the policy.
"I think the policy is to make us think about
drinking more responsibly."
Or Maybe Too Liberal?
Some students, however, said they think the
alcohol policy is not strict enough.
Brett Monello, senior, president of Phi Delia
Theta
"If the alcohol policy applied only to people in
our frat, it'd be too restrictive, but when we as
fraternities are responsible for other people,
there must be more and clearer rules."
Monello said he feels strongly that the present
alcohol policy is both "inadequate" and "vague,"
affording a "major double standard" in the way it
is enforced.
"Technically, we've been handled fairly. And
yet last weekend, Serra House had a party called
'Blow Chow.' Now that's certainly an alcohol
focused event.
"Tell me, did they get in trouble? People have
this basic misconception that all fraternity guys
are irresponsible."
Sophomore Louis Vu
"If there's no active enforcement, then
no point in putting up rules. Contrary to what the
University would like to think, for students, par
ties and alcohol are synonymous."
Rick Kelly, a member of Kappa Sigma
"The same sort of things happen at dorm pat;-
ties as happen at fraternity parties, and nothing
is ever said to them. It seems like they keep a
closer watch on frats."
Eugene Harris
"We go along thinking we're doing what we'te
supposed to do, and then all of a sudden, the
University jumps on someone."
The SAE Decision
One action that was criticized by many stu
dents both in and out of the fraternities was ReSr
idential Education's charges against the SAE fra
ternity for its "irresponsibility and lack of
cooperation with police" during a party at the fra;
ternity early this quarter.

'Residential Education cer
♦
tainly does a rotten job of -':
hiding their distaste for
fraternities. It takes a real:
politician like Donald Ken
nedy to hate a group and
act like he likes them.'

An anonymous fraternity member
"The police report misrepresented what was
going on at the party in the first place, and then
(Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs) Norm Robinson
went even farther and exaggerated the report in
his letter. We were put on [probation] before all
of this was investigated, before we were even
talked to — guilty until proven innocent. Norm
Robinson was out of line to sign evidence he
hadn't verified."
An anonymous sophomore
"Residential Education certainly does a rotten
job of hiding their distaste for fraternities. It
takes a real politician like [University President]
Donald Kennedy to hate a group and act like he
likes them. Res Ed has got some work to do."
Observations Without Conclusions
Clearly, the alcohol policy issue involves both
the rules themselves and their enforcement.
One junior observed, "Such rules and such
trends in their enforcement are not formulated in
a vacuum. On the contrary, they are long-term
direct and indirect responses to the attitudes and
actions of the students.
"We need to spend more time asking our
selves why and how we want to use alcohol in
the first place. I may be biased, but I think that if
we all did that more often, the use of alcohol
here at Stanford would fall dramatically."
Almost every Stanford undergraduate feels
responsible enough to make a personal decision
about alcohol, but the response was varied when
students talked about peer behavior regarding
intoxicating substances in an informal survey
conducted by The Daily.
While some said certain groups behave more
responsibly than others around alcohol, all those
surveyed agree that people over 18 years of age
, at least have the right to drink.
Many students viewed the new rules issued by
the Office of Residential Education as a negative
trend, taking away student freedom of choice.
Several RAs and students felt that the new
rules against drinking games undermined the
student's sense of responsibility for making deci
sions and rendered RAs more inaccessible by
turning them into figures of authority.
Others, however, observed that University
policy is too liberal and vague, especially when
groups such as fraternities are expected to be
responsible not only for their own members, but
for the students who attend their parties as well.
Are Students Responsible?
Freshman Pia Keagy
"Oh yes, the majority are responsible. Most
Stanford students are responsible when they
arrive, and there's not much peer pressure here
to influence them otherwise."
Senior Eugene Harris, president of Kappa Sigma
fraternity
"As a senior, yes (I am responsible); as a
freshman, no. Peer pressure is very dominant
here."
An anonymous senior
"I think that most Stanford students are re
sponsible enough to handle alcohol, with the ex
ception of the guys up in the fraternities who
tend to be pretty immature."
Sophomore Mike O'Dell
"Generally, students are responsible with al
cohol. But then you have examples of frats with
the brothers lying all over the place.
"I think trying to control it isn't the right ap
proach.
"Notre Dame was a campus just like ours — a
drink your age policy. They outlawed drinking,
and there was rioting on campus, but it stuck.
Now, parties still go on, but they're not so huge.
I have a friend who tells me people still get drunk
all the time.
"College life is when you're supposed to learn
that stuff."
An anonymous fraternity member
"I know that at least all the members of this
fraternity are responsible enough. Whether or
not that holds true for the rest of the campus, I
don't know."
Perspectives on the Policy
Students were also asked for their opinions on
the University's drinking policy, whether it is too
liberal or too strict and what changes they would
suggest, if any.
Most responded that the policy is fairly liberal,
and rightly so.
Eugene Harris
"Let's face it. You can drink under age for free
anywhere, and usually without interference from
the University or the police. That's pretty
liberal. And that kind of an atmosphere is appro
priate for a place like Stanford."
Sophomore David Lee
"I don't go to that many parties that have alco
hol. I made a decision not to drink. The equally
attractive, non-alcoholic alternative is a good
policy. If you legalize drinking but also have the
alternative, it takes a little of the pressure off
having to drink.
"It doesn't create a really awkward situation.
You can stand there with a cup in your hand and
still not drink.
"There's much less pressure to drink here
than in other places I've been. Some people are
offended when I tell them I don't drink; they ask
me why not. But most people respect my deci
sion.
"I don't try to tell other people not to drink,
either. That's somebody's personal decision."

that the drinking policy has become increasingly
