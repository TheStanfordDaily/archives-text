# It's Fine To Drink at UCLA, but Only With the Door Closed

### FIONA ADAMSON 
What are drinking policies like at other schools? A survey of seven col
lege administrators from universities across the country found alcohol
policies as diverse as the institutions themselves.
Some regional differences can be noted, though. On the East Coast, for
instance, recent changes in the legal drinking age have caused some
schools to suddenly alter their policies. Most universities in western
states, though, have had to deal with a legal drinking age of 21 for a longer
period of time and have been able to develop policies gradually.
Three of the schools surveyed, USC, UCLA and Princeton, specifically
prohibit the manufacture, sale, distribution or use of illicit drugs.
"Drugs are not allowed here in any way, shape or form," said Kim West,
assistant director for student development at USC.
Here, then, is an east to west survey of drinking policies at other institu
tions:
Yale University
According to David Mills, assistant to the dean, Yale is in a unique situa
tion, as the drinking age in Connecticut has fluctuated greatly within the
past few years and only recently settled at 21.

"We as a university are not allowed to serve alcoholic beverages," said
Mills, who explained that the policy of Yale allows groups to provide alcohol
to those students of legal drinking age. These groups, however, "must
hire professional bartenders."
For students under 21, Mills stated that the university "does not police
rooms, but, at the same time, the consumption of alcohol is not
condoned."
Mills added that the current policy on alcohol was "determined in part by
the students" after Yale went from a situation in which it was legal for the
majority of undergraduates to drink to the current law where the legal age
is 21.
Princeton University
The alcohol policy of Princeton, as stated by Jackie Fuschini, secretary
to Dean Kathleen Deignan, provides that "alcoholic beverages will not, in
general, be provided at university-sponsored events at which minors are
present"
Student organizations at Princeton that wish to sponsor events to which
individuals bring their own alcohol may do so, according to Fuschini, as
long as only members of the Princeton community are in attendance and
the amounts brought in are used solely for individual consumption (i.e., no
kegs).

The organizations are also held liable for compliance with all federal,
state and local laws, including the legal drinking age of 21.
Fuschini emphasized that college officials "really watchdog" the policy,
calling organizations or individuals in if they find advertisements for events
in the paper that do not follow Princeton's alcohol code.
Fuschini said that reaction to Princeton's alcohol policy was at first
"complaints and confusion" but that the policy has now "settled in."
Harvard University
Archie Epps, the dean of Student Affairs at Harvard, said, "Due to a
change in the drinking age, the policy of Harvard has not been announced
yet."
University of Notre Dame
Ann Firth, director of residence life at Notre Dame, works to uphold the
university policy of "no public drinking on campus at all, particularly for
those under 21."
She added, however, that "if students in the privacy of their own room
want to drink, that's OK as long as it does not cause a problem for the
public."
