# It's Fine To Drink at UCLA, but Only With the Door Closed
## 
### FIONA ADAMSON 
What are drinking policies like at other schools? A survey of seven col
lege administrators from universities across the country found alcohol
policies as diverse as the institutions themselves.
Some regional differences can be noted, though. On the East Coast, for
instance, recent changes in the legal drinking age have caused some
schools to suddenly alter their policies. Most universities in western
states, though, have had to deal with a legal drinking age of 21 for a longer
period of time and have been able to develop policies gradually.
Three of the schools surveyed, USC, UCLA and Princeton, specifically
prohibit the manufacture, sale, distribution or use of illicit drugs.
"Drugs are not allowed here in any way, shape or form," said Kim West,
assistant director for student development at USC.
Here, then, is an east to west survey of drinking policies at other institu
tions:
Yale University
According to David Mills, assistant to the dean, Yale is in a unique situa
tion, as the drinking age in Connecticut has fluctuated greatly within the
past few years and only recently settled at 21.

"We as a university are not allowed to serve alcoholic beverages," said
Mills, who explained that the policy of Yale allows groups to provide alcohol
to those students of legal drinking age. These groups, however, "must
hire professional bartenders."
For students under 21, Mills stated that the university "does not police
rooms, but, at the same time, the consumption of alcohol is not
condoned."
Mills added that the current policy on alcohol was "determined in part by
the students" after Yale went from a situation in which it was legal for the
majority of undergraduates to drink to the current law where the legal age
is 21.
Princeton University
The alcohol policy of Princeton, as stated by Jackie Fuschini, secretary
to Dean Kathleen Deignan, provides that "alcoholic beverages will not, in
general, be provided at university-sponsored events at which minors are
present"
Student organizations at Princeton that wish to sponsor events to which
individuals bring their own alcohol may do so, according to Fuschini, as
long as only members of the Princeton community are in attendance and
the amounts brought in are used solely for individual consumption (i.e., no
kegs).

The organizations are also held liable for compliance with all federal,
state and local laws, including the legal drinking age of 21.
Fuschini emphasized that college officials "really watchdog" the policy,
calling organizations or individuals in if they find advertisements for events
in the paper that do not follow Princeton's alcohol code.
Fuschini said that reaction to Princeton's alcohol policy was at first
"complaints and confusion" but that the policy has now "settled in."
Harvard University
Archie Epps, the dean of Student Affairs at Harvard, said, "Due to a
change in the drinking age, the policy of Harvard has not been announced
yet."
University of Notre Dame
Ann Firth, director of residence life at Notre Dame, works to uphold the
university policy of "no public drinking on campus at all, particularly for
those under 21."
She added, however, that "if students in the privacy of their own room
want to drink, that's OK as long as it does not cause a problem for the
public."
According to Firth, the alcohol policy of Notre Dame was reissued in
1984 and is now more strictly enforced than before that time.
"On the whole, we're pleased with the results of our policy," stated
Firth. "We like to think that we are promoting a better attitude toward al
cohol and allowing students to have fun without drinking."
use
Closer to home, the University of Southern California, according West,
discourages drinking in public.
"No one can have alcohol in a public area, such as walking through the
hall with a can of beer," she said.
West said that in a "priorly approved situation," alcohol may be served
to those over the age of 21, with IDs required.
"We discourage kegs, although it is not in our official policy," West
added. All events at which alcohol is present must also include food and an
alternative beverage, according to West.
. West stressed that the policy of USC has "evolved over time" and that
"students seem to be relatively comfortable" with the code.
UCLA
Jack Gibbons, associate director of the Office of Residential Life at
UCLA, stated university policy as the following: "Alcohol is prohibited in

public areas of residence halls except areas where the occupants are 21
and over. In those areas the distribution and consumption of alcohol is
monitored."
In areas where minors are present, Gibbons said that "alcohol in bulk
containers is prohibited, and the consumption of alcohol in student living
rooms with the door open is prohibited."
According to Gibbons, the policy of UCLA has been modified on several
occasions. As recently as 10 years ago alcohol was not allowed on campus.
Gibbons explained that in its prior policy, UCLA did not include the sec
tion with respect to bulk containers and open doors. The addition of this
portion has helped to "keep large parties from getting out of hand," Gib
bons said.
UC-Berkeley
Jean Greek, manager of the residential program at Berkeley, explained
that students over the age of 21 may drink in the privacy of their own
room, but not in public areas of the university.
For students under the age of 21, Greek said that, although drinking is
not condoned, "we don't go looking for alcohol.
"We don t really police, we have RAs on duty who take care of behav
ioral problems," she said.
Greek added that the policy of Berkeley is based on the concept of per
sonal freedom, adding that "you get as much freedom as you can take re
sponsibility for, within the guidelines of the university."

that students over the age of 21 may drink in the privacy of their own
room, but not in public areas of the university.
For students under the age of 21, Greek said that, although drinking is
not condoned, "we don't go looking for alcohol.
"We don t really police, we have RAs on duty who take care of behav
ioral problems," she said.
Greek added that the policy of Berkeley is based on the concept of per
sonal freedom, adding that "you get as much freedom as you can take re
sponsibility for, within the guidelines of the university."
What are drinking policies like at other schools? A survey of seven col
lege administrators from universities across the country found alcohol
policies as diverse as the institutions themselves.
Some regional differences can be noted, though. On the East Coast, for
instance, recent changes in the legal drinking age have caused some
schools to suddenly alter their policies. Most universities in western
states, though, have had to deal with a legal drinking age of 21 for a longer
period of time and have been able to develop policies gradually.
Three of the schools surveyed, USC, UCLA and Princeton, specifically
prohibit the manufacture, sale, distribution or use of illicit drugs.
"Drugs are not allowed here in any way, shape or form," said Kim West,
assistant director for student development at USC.
Here, then, is an east to west survey of drinking policies at other institu
tions:
Yale University
According to David Mills, assistant to the dean, Yale is in a unique situa
tion, as the drinking age in Connecticut has fluctuated greatly within the
past few years and only recently settled at 21.

"We as a university are not allowed to serve alcoholic beverages," said
Mills, who explained that the policy of Yale allows groups to provide alcohol
to those students of legal drinking age. These groups, however, "must
hire professional bartenders."
For students under 21, Mills stated that the university "does not police
rooms, but, at the same time, the consumption of alcohol is not
condoned."
Mills added that the current policy on alcohol was "determined in part by
the students" after Yale went from a situation in which it was legal for the
majority of undergraduates to drink to the current law where the legal age
is 21.
Princeton University
The alcohol policy of Princeton, as stated by Jackie Fuschini, secretary
to Dean Kathleen Deignan, provides that "alcoholic beverages will not, in
general, be provided at university-sponsored events at which minors are
present"
Student organizations at Princeton that wish to sponsor events to which
individuals bring their own alcohol may do so, according to Fuschini, as
long as only members of the Princeton community are in attendance and
the amounts brought in are used solely for individual consumption (i.e., no
kegs).

The organizations are also held liable for compliance with all federal,
state and local laws, including the legal drinking age of 21.
Fuschini emphasized that college officials "really watchdog" the policy,
calling organizations or individuals in if they find advertisements for events
in the paper that do not follow Princeton's alcohol code.
Fuschini said that reaction to Princeton's alcohol policy was at first
"complaints and confusion" but that the policy has now "settled in."
Harvard University
Archie Epps, the dean of Student Affairs at Harvard, said, "Due to a
change in the drinking age, the policy of Harvard has not been announced
yet."
University of Notre Dame
Ann Firth, director of residence life at Notre Dame, works to uphold the
university policy of "no public drinking on campus at all, particularly for
those under 21."
She added, however, that "if students in the privacy of their own room
want to drink, that's OK as long as it does not cause a problem for the
public."
According to Firth, the alcohol policy of Notre Dame was reissued in
1984 and is now more strictly enforced than before that time.
"On the whole, we're pleased with the results of our policy," stated
Firth. "We like to think that we are promoting a better attitude toward al
cohol and allowing students to have fun without drinking."
use
Closer to home, the University of Southern California, according West,
discourages drinking in public.
"No one can have alcohol in a public area, such as walking through the
hall with a can of beer," she said.
West said that in a "priorly approved situation," alcohol may be served
to those over the age of 21, with IDs required.
"We discourage kegs, although it is not in our official policy," West
added. All events at which alcohol is present must also include food and an
alternative beverage, according to West.
. West stressed that the policy of USC has "evolved over time" and that
"students seem to be relatively comfortable" with the code.
UCLA
Jack Gibbons, associate director of the Office of Residential Life at
UCLA, stated university policy as the following: "Alcohol is prohibited in

public areas of residence halls except areas where the occupants are 21
and over. In those areas the distribution and consumption of alcohol is
monitored."
In areas where minors are present, Gibbons said that "alcohol in bulk
containers is prohibited, and the consumption of alcohol in student living
rooms with the door open is prohibited."
According to Gibbons, the policy of UCLA has been modified on several
occasions. As recently as 10 years ago alcohol was not allowed on campus.
Gibbons explained that in its prior policy, UCLA did not include the sec
tion with respect to bulk containers and open doors. The addition of this
portion has helped to "keep large parties from getting out of hand," Gib
bons said.
