## 1908 Drinking Law Sparked Insurrection 
### DAN DeLUCE Staff writer 
From the beer busts and keg
parades of the turn of the century,
to the psychedelic drugs of the
'60s, to the cocaine of the present,
alcohol and, more recently, drugs
have always been a part of student
life at Stanford.
The use of intoxicating sub
stances, like most aspects of Stan
ford life, is rich in its history, filled
with lore and perhaps lessons for
the future.
"There has been apparently a
wave of beer drinking within the
last months," said Stanford's first
president, David Starr Jordan, in
1907.
Alcohol flowed freely for the first
17 years on the Farm. But opposi
tion gathered until faculty and admi
nistrators led a campaign to ban liq
uor on campus in 1908.
The Student Affairs Committee
and its chairman, Prof. A. Clark,
ruled that "any student who is
known to have been noticeably un
der the influence of liquor in any
place, or to have participated in a
so-called 'beer bust' or any other
drinking party, shall be considered
a subject for discipline."
The night of the decision a crowd
of more than 300 marched on
Clark's house, but he was not
home. They proceeded to the Inner
Quad, shooting off firearms and
marching to the accompaniment of
music.
Afterwards, 41 students were
expelled and 150 others had units
added to their graduation require
ments.
Jordan called the protest "an or
ganized expression of revolt,
primarily against the (Student Af
fairs) Committee, but actually
against the University itself."
The 1909 Stanford Quad wrote:
"During the last semester Stanford
passed through the greatest crisis
in its history. A breach occurred
between the faculty and student
body which will probably not disap
pear until a new generation enters
Stanford."
The Daily, then officially called
The Daily Palo Alto, said, "The new
spirit (at Stanford) is teaching us to
accept Dr. Jordan's beautiful and
austere ideal â€” the ideal of a uni
versity of clean, temperate men
and spiritually minded women."
Prior to the liquor ban, a state
law prohibited the sale of liquor
within a one-and-one-half-mile
radius around the campus. Restau
rants were exempted.
With the advent of the automo
bile, the ban over the years
decreased in significance. Students
did their drinking off campus.
The first efforts to lift the liquor
ban began in the 19505.
An anonymous group of Stanford
parents, in February 1966, wrote a
letter to other Stanford parents
warning them about the Stanford
View Barbecue in Palo Alto that
served alcohol, "only 120 feet from
student dormitories."
The letter continued, "Yet, while
good citizens slept, the neighboring
city of Palo Alto has become a
fertile ground for the schemes of
unscrupulous liquor promoters."
The anonymous parents wrote
that the restaurant could turn into a
"haven for dope pushers, perverts
and sex peddlers."
Students returning to campus
after off-campus drinking created a
hazard, and the University ap
peared hypocritical in its failure to
enforce its own regulations.
Finally, on April 21, 1966, Presi
dent Wallace Sterling announced
the end of the campus ban on liq
uor.
Drugs entered the scene at Stan
ford, as they did nationally, in the
mid 19605. Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons said he thinks student
drug use has changed since the late
'60s, when "the drug use in that
time was psychoactive drugs, hal
lucinogens."
Students sought personal growth
and insight through psychedelic
drugs like LSD, according to
Lyons.
Lyons claimed students said to
themselves, "I'm going to learn
about myself . . . What might hap

pen in four years will happen in
12 hours."
After the University took a for
mal position disapproving of the
public use of LSD, a symposium
was held in Tresidder Union and
Dr. Timothy Leary was one of the
speakers.
An advocate of LSD for
therapeutic and religious use,
Leary took the crowded audience
on a simulated LSD trip through
history.
Lyons said that as time passed,
"accumulative evidence showed the
harmful effects of psychedelic
drugs."
"Students saw that it
(psychedelic drug use ) was not
risk-free," Lyons said.
The 1971 Stanford Quad pointed
out the visible role of marijuana:
"Certainly, the young people that
come in contact with this univer
sity, whether visitors or sons and
daughters of Stanford people, are
influenced by the prevalence of pot
on this campus."
The Quad continued: "Emerging
to capture the public eye is the
bearded Stanford radical, complete
with the proverbial joint hanging
from the mouth."
Along with the bearded radical,
the presence of marijuana seems to
have declined at Stanford.
Lyons agrees that marijuana use
is down, but adds that cocaine use
is on the increase.
Lyons said the decline in mari
juana use may be linked to the
marked decline in cigarette use

'I've got 20 units of
work per week,
and coke makes
that grind easier to
bear.'

among students. Only 4 percent of
Stanford students smoke tobacco,
according to Lyons.
"What I have seen more recently
is the use of drugs for recreational
uses," Lyons said.
Drugs now are used for recrea
tion or "to enhance performance,
which is very different from the late
'605," Lyons said.
Lyons cited alcohol and cocaine
as the most prevalent recreational
substances.
A national survey conducted by
the National Institute on Drug
Abuse showed marijuana use
among 18 to 25 year olds down
from 68 percent to 64 percent be
tween 1972 and 1982. Hallucinogen
use also dropped four percentage
points, while alcohol use remained
the same and cocaine use in
creased.
An article in Up Front magazine
that appeared in 1982 said cocaine
at Stanford "has become the drug of
choice."
An English student quoted in the
article said, "I've got 20 units of
work per week, and coke makes
that grind easier to bear."
Another student was quoted as
saying, "My grades are better for it
(cocaine)."
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo
has stated that students use
cocaine to relieve depression and
stress inherent in today's college
experience.
"There have been cases," Lyons
said of cocaine, "where students
have organized their lives around
it."
He said cocaine is "deceiving" in
its addictive power.
Lyons said the University is
"concerned about how IdrugsJ
could interfere with the student's
educational process."
The role of the University is not,
he said, to act as a policeman, but
to help people through counseling
and rehabilitation programs.
Dr. William Pollin, director of the
National Institute on Drug Abuse,
said in 1983 that although drug use
(including alcohol) among the na
tion's youth has generally declined,
"we are still the country with a
higher level of drug use among
young people than any other
country in the world."

The classic, iconic symbol for the college party. When Stanford President David Starr Jordan banned alcohol in 1908, a crowd of
students marched into the Quad with firearms to defend this coveted symbol. Ever since the repeal of campus prohibition in 1966
the keg has taken its p!ace at the center of most parties. Now, the keg and all it symbolizes is under question once again. Resi
dential Education is enforcing its policies more strongly than ever that alcohol should not be the focus of an event.
