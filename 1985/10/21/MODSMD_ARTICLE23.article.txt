## Kahn Covers the Bases in 'Good Enough' 
### ED PRICE 
"Good Enough to Dream"
By Roger Kahn
Doubleday, $14.95

The author of "The Boys of Sum
mer" gets another hit with "Good
Enough to Dream," a book that
closely examines the world of the
minor leagues through the up and
down fortunes of the Class A Utica
Blue Sox.
Roger Kahn was president of the
Blue Sox, an independent team in
the New York-Penn League, and
"Good Enough to Dream"
chronicles the story of the team and
its management during the summer
of 1983.
For any sports fan upset with the
major league players for striking
despite the fact that they make an
average of $350,000 a year, "Good
Enough to Dream" may provide in
sight into the experiences of a
baseball player. The vast majority
of major league players made the
trip to the top through the minors,
and not many fans realize what that
life is like. This book shows the dif
ficulty of the long bus rides, the bad
hotels and the struggle to live on
$500 a month. It becomes obvious

that the professional baseball player
must be driven more by a love for
the game than by greed.
The contrast between this book
and"The Boys of Summer" is
noteworthy. In "The Boys of Sum
mer," Kahn revisited, 20 years
later, the Brooklyn Dodgers of the
1950s and presented his interview
with each player in a different chap
ter. The Dodger teams of Jackie
Robinson and Pee Wee Reese were
popular clubs and consistent win
ners. The Blue Sox played in
shabby Murnane Field, no compari
son to Ebbets Field, and the Blue
Sox drew just 42,779 fans for the
entire summer of 1983.
Unfortunately, Kahn begins both
books similarly, with recollections
of baseball in his youth. Kahn em
phasizes his relationship with his
father and the role baseball played
in it. He does make the point that
much of the love for baseball among
men may be because boys learn
baseball from their fathers, and the
game helps to preserve and con
tinue the father-son tie. However,
Kahn overplays this part of "Good
Enough to Dream." To anyone who
has read "The Boys of Summer," it
will seem like a rehashing of the
first third of that book, and the

stories of Roger and Gordon Kahn
get old the second time around.
After conquering the first chap
ter, though, the reader will find that
the pace picks up as Kahn goes
looking for a minor league team to
run. It is in this part of the book that
Kahn compares four of baseball's
most famous owners, Bill Veeck,
Walter O'Malley, Branch Rickey
and George Steinbrenner, making
for a revealing bit of contrast of
methods. It is a quote from
O'Malley about baseball that sets
the theme for the rest of the work:
"It's too much of business to be a
sport and too much of a sport to be
a business."
After two failed attempts in Co
lumbia, S.C., and Cooperstown,
N.Y., Kahn acquires the Blue Sox.
Kahn says of Utica, "This, then, is
a minor league American town, a
Single A town, capable in theory of
supporting a baseball team three
notches below the major leagues."
Utica is a blue-collar city, with eth
nic neighborhoods and double-digit
unemployment. Utica's population
has been in decline since 1948,
coincident with the decline of the
Northeastern mills. (Even the
ridicule of Ken Brett in Lite beer
commercials could not last; he

managed the Blue Sox in 1985.) But
baseball lives on in Utica.
The Blue Sox differ from most
minor league teams in one signifi
cant way. The Utica team is inde
pendent, and the rest of the teams
in the league (and most of those in
baseball) are farm clubs. The farm
clubs are run by the major league
teams, which supply the players,
the managers and much of the fund
ing. The priority on farm clubs is in
struction and improvement rather
than winning. Farm teams are a
means to an end, the big leagues.
In Utica, though, the players are
castoffs â€” either cut from other or
ganizations or overlooked in the
draft. For the Blue Sox, winning
and revenge are as much motiva
tion as promotion. This is reflected
in the personality of Jim Gattis, a
manager in the Leo Durocher-Billy
Martin-Earl Weaver mold, who
demands intensity from his players
above all else.
Once the season starts, the
team, Kahn and the book all get
going. Kahn chronicles the season
from both the point of the view of
the team and its performance and
the business side of the Blue Sox.
Kahn, as chief executive of the
team, must continually compromise

between the needs of the players
and the Sox's financial situation.
The writing works that way too;
Kahn is equally adept at describing
the shoestring catch and the shoe
string budget.
The narrative of the season itself
is interesting when compared to
other accounts of baseball years,
especially those by major league
players. "The Long Season" by Jim
Brosnan, "Ball Four" by Jim Bouton
and"The Bronx Zoo" by Sparky
Lyle are all diaries of seasons
(1959, 1969 and 1978 respectively)
by big league pitchers, and unparal
leled first-hand records of the
game. Kahn, though, writes from
the front office, and, for the first
time, the baseball fan can see the
inside of the business end of the na
tional pastime.
The story of the actual Blue Sox
season, though, is as insightful and
exciting as the baseball diaries, and
even better written. Kahn may not
have the descriptive ability of
Roger Angell or the technical
knowledge of Thomas Boswell, but
he strikes a good balance between
the two. His actual sports writing is
simple and straightforward, but also
excites and captivates the reader.
The New York-Penn League

(where former Stanford stars Jeff
Ballard and Pete Stanicek played
for the Newark Orioles this sum
mer) is a short-season league.'
Teams are x assembled after the
June draft and play until about
Labor Day. There are no off-days
scheduled, though, so the teams fit
in about 75 games. The Blue Sox's
start the season 26-6, and Kahn
shows how everything is wonderful
when the team is winning.
But then the team falters, as no
one can play .800 ball for a whole
season, and the inner tension
grows. The book climaxes with the
pennant race against the Little Falls
Mets. The teams represent the es-.
tablishment against the mavericks
and youth against age, since in
Class A ball, the Blue Sox's 23 year
olds are considered ancient.
Roger Kahn's tale of one minor
league summer is a treat for any
baseball fan. For the first time, a
talented author has chosen to dis
play, in depth, two parts of the
game that too often go unnoticed:
the minors and the front office.
Kahn describes his personal experi
ences and those of his players so
well that by the time the book ends,
the reader becomes a diehard fan of
the Blue Sox.
