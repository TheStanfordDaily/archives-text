## Paye hurt in 30-6 blowout Trojans Trample The Weary Card 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — Same story.
Different stadium, different op
ponent, different score, but the
Stanford football team made all the
same old mistakes in its 30-6 loss to
USC Saturday.
No running game. Terrible pass
blocking. Too many big plays given
up by the defense. Put it all to
gether and you've got a five-game
losing streak and a near-shutout in
the L.A. Coliseum.
"It was frustrating because we
didn't execute like we're capable [of
executing]," Stanford tailback
Thomas Henley said. "We're capa
ble of greater things."
The Cardinal (1-5) had better
start proving that capability, or the
1985 season could wind up being a
repeat of 1983's 1-10 campaign.
California and Oregon State aren't
going to be the pushovers that they
were predicted to be, and Cardinal
upsets of Arizona, Washington and
Arizona State are looking pretty
unlikely now.
Especially if quarterback John
Paye isn't around. Paye was hit on
the top of his right shoulder on the
Cardinal's second possession of the
game, separating the shoulder. He
stayed in the game until the middle
of the fourth quarter, hitting on 21
of his 39 passes, but it is uncertain
whether he will play against Arizona
next week.
"On a grade level of 1 to 3,
(Paye's injury) is a 2," said team
physician Don Bunce after the
game. "He can throw — it's just
very painful.
"He's going to be real painful to
morrow. We'll take another look at
him in practice this week before de
ciding whether he can play next
week."
Paye was more optimistic.
"I'm not hurt for good," he said.
"I just know it hurts right now. I'm
going to be back next week."

If his offensive line is as anemic
as it was Saturday, he won't be
back for long. USC, like UCLA the
week before, put enormous pres
sure on Paye with just four rushers
and wound up sacking him four
times and hitting him hard almost
every time he threw the ball.
"Our offensive line had trouble
with their pass blocking," Cardinal
fullback Brian Morris said. "It's just
a matter of us not being very physi
cal up front. If we can't block four
guys, we're in trouble."
USC nose tackle Tony Colorito
said, "We got our mail in the Stan
ford backfield. (Their offensive line)
was definitely, uh, inexperienced.
I'll use a euphemism."
USC was on the scoreboard
before most of the crowd of 56,837
had settled into their seats. On the
third play of the game, Trojan quar
terback Sean Salisbury rolled right,
saw split end Hank Norman trotting
all by himself behind the Stanford
secondary and lofted a 63-yard pass
that put USC on the Cardinal 14-
yard line. From there, tailback Fred
Crutcher danced around end a few
times and scored on a one-yard run
with just 2:47 gone from the clock.
Then, after Cardinal kicker David
Sweeney pulled a 46-yard field goal
wide left, the Trojans did it again.
Crutcher took a pitchout at his own
25 and handed off to flanker Randy
Tanner, who launched a bomb to
Norman 50 yards downfield.
"In the films, Stanford defensive
backs had a tendency to bite on
play-action motion," Tanner said.
"(Their secondary) is good on the
run, but they're not very good on
the pass."
Crutcher banged it in from the
three, and USC had a 14-0 lead.
The Stanford defense stiffened
after that, holding USC to a pair of
field goals the rest of the half, but it
was already too late. The Cardinal
offense was going nowhere.
Stanford had a shot at scoring


David Kravetz/Daily
Cardinal fullback Brian Morris did his best filling in for the injured USC defensive back Matt Johnson on the Coliseum turf. Morris
Brad Muster, though he more often than not ran into the likes of carried the ball nine times for 49 yards in the 30-6 loss.
