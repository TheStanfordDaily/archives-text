# Polo Enjoys SoCal Trip; USC, UCLA Fall To Card
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
In one of the most bizarre and exciting games in
many years, the Stanford water polo team defeated
UCLA in three overtime periods 11-10 Friday and then
came back to knock off USC Saturday 10-7 to remain
undefeated in Pacific 10 Conference play.
The weekend sweep in Los Angeles represented a
giant step toward the conference championship for the
Cardinal, which now leads the Pac-10 with a 3-0 record
and three games remaining. UCLA is 1-2, while both
USC and California are 0-1.
"These two games were very important," Cardinal
Coach Dante Dettamanti said. "It's the hardest set of
two games we have to play."
The Bruins took a 4-0 lead midway through the
second quarter, forcing Dettamanti to call two
timeouts within a 30-second time span. "I had a feeling
they (UCLA) would come out pretty strong and sure
enough they did," Dettamanti said.
Following the second timeout, David Imbernino
scored for the Cardinal to make the score 4-1. Greg
Ocasek then came off the bench to score two straight
goals and cut the UCLA lead to 4-3.

"That really got us back in the game," Dettamanti
said.
Meanwhile, due to a quirk in the configuration of the
UCLA pool, the referees were standing on the same
side of the pool and, according to Dettamanti, doing a
poor job of watching the far side of the pool.
'With the score 5-3, a UCLA player used a clenched
fist to hit Imbernino, then proceeded to kick him and
hit him again. "Three obvious above-water fouls," Det
tamanti emphasized. "I had to say something to protect
my players."
And say something he did to the tune of being
thrown off the pool deck â€” the equivalent of being
ejected from the game in baseball.
Dettamanti claimed that his ejection paid positive
dividends for the Cardinal. "After I was kicked out, the
players got a little more excited, and I think the refs
called the match more evenly," he said. "I could still
watch the match, and during timeouts I relayed
messages to the team."
The excitement did not end, however, with the
Stanford coach's ejection. With six minutes left in the
third quarter, Craig Klass scored to knot the game at
6-6.

USC on Saturday. Nevertheless, the Cardinal went on to win the contest 10-7, a day after they
topped UCLA 11-10 in triple overtime.
