# Spikers Run Into An ASU Obstacle
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
The No.l-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team learned
the hard way that when you
don't put a team away early in a
match you may pay dearly later.
The Cardinal women — previ
ously undefeated in 14 matches
this season — stumbled Friday
night against a very sharp
Arizona State team, losing in five
games, 15-12, 5-15, 13-15, 15-

11, 16-14. The following after
noon the Cardinal rebounded for
a 15-9, 10-15, 15-5, 13-15, 15-
13 victory over Arizona.
"It was a thriller," Cardinal
Co-coach Don Shaw said of the
ASU match. "Up until now we've
been able to pull them out."
"Arizona State played really
well — out of their minds," Shaw
said. "We weren't quite clicking
on all cylinders."
Yet despite the disparity be
tween the two teams' play, the
match appeared to be all but locked
up by the Cardinal women midway
into the fourth game.
After the Sun Devils won the
first game 15-12, Stanford breezed
through game two, winning by a
score of 15-5 to even the match.
Game three was much closer, but
the Cardinal prevailed 15-13 to take
an upper hand in the match.
The Cardinal women then
jumped to a 11-8 lead in game four
and could smell victory No. 15. But
ASU regained control of the serve,
and Stanford was unable to side
out. The Sun Devils strung to
gether seven consecutive points to
take the game 15-11.

The Cardinal women had another
glimpse at victory, serving just two
points from a win at 13-12 in game
five. But once again the lead slipped
away, and this time the match went
with it as the Sun Devils captured
the game 16-14 and in the process
knocked the Cardinal from the
ranks of the unbeaten.
"We had chances to win the
match," Shaw lamented.
The ultimate difference in the
match may have been the added en
thusiasm that the partisan crowd in
stilled in the ASU women.
Normally the Sun Devils play in a
large arena, but Friday night it was
being used for another event, so
the volleyball match was played in a
much smaller gymnasium. The net
result was a standing-room-only
crowd and noise, more noise and
even more noise.

"They had a packed gym," Shaw
said.
Conversely, the Cardinal women
were anything but enthused.
Having left the Stanford campus
very early Friday morning, they
were forced to play a 6 p.m. match
instead of the usual 7:30 starting
time.
"Everyone was a little spacy,"
Shaw said.
After waking up early Saturday
morning and driving two hours to
Tucson, the Cardinal women
salvaged a split for the weekend by
defeating the Wildcats in another
five-game match.
The Cardinal women now have
10 days off before hosting USC
Nov. 1 in a Pac-West conference
match.
"We need to get back to basics
and take a few days off," Shaw said.
