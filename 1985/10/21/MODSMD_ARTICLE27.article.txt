# Hockey Rolls at Cal

### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
BERKELEY — Right now Stanford field hockey is
hot — very hot.
The squad traveled across the Bay this weekend to
participate in the Bth annual California Invitational, and
it returned to Stanford yesterday as the tournament
champion.
The Cardinal defeated Chico State, San Jose State
and Simon Fraser College to stretch its winning streak
to five games. It is now 6-3-1 overall and 2-1-1 in
Northern Pacific Conference play.
"This is the best we've played in a long time," co
captain Suzanne Doi said.
Stanford controlled play throughout each game. On
Cal's fast synthetic surface, the Cardinal's skilled stick
handling came to the forefront. It seemed at many

times that the squad was running a clinic on smooth
passing plays and how to leave the defense flat-footed.
"We're finally the Stanford team that we should be,"
freshman forward Kathy Thomas said.
The most gratifying of the matches was Friday's 3-1
victory over 18th-ranked Chico State. Chico, No. 1 in
the NorPac, beat the Cardinal 2-1 earlier in the season
in a game the Stanford players felt they should have
won. Stanford turned that earlier disappointment into
determination on Friday, and the Wildcats had no
chance.
The Cardinal goals were scored by freshman Alison
Smith, junior Maree Chung and freshman Dana
Fleming.
It was Fleming's score late in the first half of Satur
day's match against San Jose that gave the team the
cushion it needed to hold on for a 2-1 win.
Stanford got off to a fast start versus the Spartans
when Chung broke free with only
seven minutes gone in the game.
Chung found herself with an uncon
tested opportunity and took advan
tage of it with a strong 10-yard
drive past San Jose goalie Jackie
Mc Garry.

Taking a 2-0 lead into the second
half, Stanford relaxed a little, al
most too much. "We were a little
complacent," Assistant Coach Jen
Blakely said.
When Spartan standout Kim
Green scored on a short corner
with 12 minutes remaining in the
game, the Cardinal realized that
victory was not so close at hand.
Doi said San Jose is always a threat

and called the game Stanford's
toughest of the tournament.
Yesterday's game against Simon
Fraser was the team's worst of the
weekend, according to many Stan
ford team members. Despite out
shooting the Clan 26-9 and despite
the fact that Fraser's keeper Sandy
Roy had to make 16 more saves

than Cardinal keeper Karen Jones,
Stanford won only 1-0.
The Fraser offense did not even
get the ball into the Cardinal half of
the field until eight minutes had
passed since the opening whistle.
As the game progressed, things
evened out a little, but there was
never a doubt as to which was the
superior squad.
The game's only goal came with a
minute remaining in the first half.
The score was the result of a beau
tiful play involving Ami Chitwood,
Chung and Thomas. Chung
received a pass from Chitwood on
the right side of the cage and cen
tered the ball to a wide open
Thomas, who had no trouble flick
ing it by Roy.
