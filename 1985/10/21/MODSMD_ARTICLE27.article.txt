# Hockey Rolls at Cal

BERKELEY — Right now Stanford field hockey is
hot — very hot.
The squad traveled across the Bay this weekend to
participate in the Bth annual California Invitational, and
it returned to Stanford yesterday as the tournament
champion.
The Cardinal defeated Chico State, San Jose State
and Simon Fraser College to stretch its winning streak
to five games. It is now 6-3-1 overall and 2-1-1 in
Northern Pacific Conference play.
"This is the best we've played in a long time," co
captain Suzanne Doi said.
Stanford controlled play throughout each game. On
Cal's fast synthetic surface, the Cardinal's skilled stick
handling came to the forefront. It seemed at many

times that the squad was running a clinic on smooth
passing plays and how to leave the defense flat-footed.
"We're finally the Stanford team that we should be,"
freshman forward Kathy Thomas said.
The most gratifying of the matches was Friday's 3-1
victory over 18th-ranked Chico State. Chico, No. 1 in
the NorPac, beat the Cardinal 2-1 earlier in the season
in a game the Stanford players felt they should have
won. Stanford turned that earlier disappointment into
determination on Friday, and the Wildcats had no
chance.
The Cardinal goals were scored by freshman Alison
Smith, junior Maree Chung and freshman Dana
Fleming.
It was Fleming's score late in the first half of Satur
day's match against San Jose that gave the team the
cushion it needed to hold on for a 2-1 win.
