# K.C. Can't Hold On, Cards Win 4-2
## 
### 
KANSAS CITY (AP) — Terry
Pendleton turned from defensive
hero to offensive hero last night
with a three-run double in the ninth
inning that gave St. Louis a 4-2 vic
tory over the Kansas City Royals
and a 2-0 lead in baseball's 82nd
World Series.
Pendleton's two-out double
capped a four-run inning off Royals'
left-hander Charlie Leibrandt, who
carried a two-hitter into the inning.
It put the Cardinals in a com
manding position to win their
second Series in four years.
Thirty-five times teams have
won the first two games in a Series,
and 27 times they have gone on to
win.
Game 3 will match Cardinals
right-hander Joaquin Andujar, 21-12
during the season, but largely inef
fective the past month, against the
Royals' ace, 21-year-old right
hander Bret Saberhagen, 20-6.
Willie McGee started the rally
with a double down the left field
line, only the third hit off Leibrandt.
But McGee had to wait at second
while Ozzie Smith grounded out and
Tommy Herr flew out to shallow
right.
Jack Clark, whose two-out,
three-run homer in the ninth inning
beat the Los Angeles Dodgers on
Wednesday and gave the Cardinals
the National League pennant, took
three balls before he finally found
one he could hit. He pulled it into
left field between third and
shortstop, driving in McGee with

the first run of the night for St.
Louis.
Tito Landrum followed with a
bloop double just fair down the right
field line, sending Clark to third,
and Ceasar Cedeno was walked in
tentionally. That brought up
Pendleton, who turned a key

double play Saturday night with a
running, back-to-the-plate catch
and throw.
Kansas City Manager Dick How
ser had relief ace Dan Quisenberry
warming in the bullpen, but he
stuck with Leibrandt. It was the
wrong decision.
Pendleton hit a 2-1 pitch into the
left field corner, scoring all three

runners and chasing Leibrandt.
Quisenberry came, walked Dar
rell Porter intentionally and then
got Andy Van Slyke on a popup to
center to end the inning.
But the damage had been done,
and Leibrandt was a ninth-inning
victim for the second time this post
season.
Leibrandt, in almost total control
before the ninth, lost to Toronto
last Saturday in Game 4 after taking
a 1-0 lead into the last inning.
The Royals had staked Leibrandt
to a 2-0 lead in the fourth on a single
by Willie Wilson and consecutive
RBI doubles by George Brett and
Frank White, the Royals' No. 3 and
4 hitters who had been ineffective
offensively in Game 1.
And Leibrandt seemed more
than up to making that stand up.
Going into the ninth, he had
allowed only singles by Pendleton in
the third inning and Landrum in the
fourth, and had let only one other
Cardinal reach base, Clark on a
walk in front of Landrum's hit. He
also had retired 13 straight batters.
But McGee was not to be the
14th, and the Cardinals were not to
be the victims of the first Series
complete-game shutout since 1983.
Instead, they became the first
team to win the first two games on
the road since 1972, when Oakland
did it in Cincinnati and went on to
win the Series in seven.
And they became the first team
since the 1939 New York Yankees
to win after trailing 2-0 in the ninth.
