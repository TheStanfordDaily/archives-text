# Johnson Case Stimulates Scholars

### ERIC HEALY 
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has not
yet announced a decision on a lawsuit that claims
the United States' nuclear launch-on-warning
capacity violates the constitutional right of
Congress to declare war.

Filed in 1984 by Clifford Johnson, a computer
specialist at Information Technology Services,
against Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger, the case has recently received
widespread attention from both the legal com
munity and the media and has been certified with
the IRS as a tax-deductible cause by the Western
States Legal Foundation.
"I'm getting a very good reaction from the le
gal community," said Johnson, who has accepted
a position on a panel in the upcoming Peace-Law

Conference, the largest one of its kind in the
West.
Not only have publications such as In These
Times and the LA Weekly been keeping abreast
of the Johnson vs. Weinberger trial, but noted
figures such as Arthur S. Miller, professor
emeritus of constitutional law at George Wash
ington University, have also taken genuine inter
est in the proceedings.
In an article written for the Miami Herald, Mil
ler summarizes the course of events in the law
suit, focusing on the alleged unconstitutionality
of the launch-on-warning capacity (LOWC) of the
American nuclear defense arsenal. The article is
also expected to run in other newspapers affili
ated with Knight-Ridder Newspapers, an organi
zation containing 28 papers.
LOWC — a weapons system providing for the
automatic launching of nuclear missiles when
electronic sensors indicate that the nation is un
der attack — can lead to computer-declared war,
which not only removes the factor of human

prudence in decision making, but also can be
downright erroneous, according to Johnson.
"The central allegation is that no human(s) can
determine the veracity of a computerized missile
attack warning in the time available, and
therefore the executive power is incompetent to
make a retaliatory decision," Johnson is quoted
as saying in the article.
Although the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in
San Francisco has not made a decision in the
Johnson vs. Weinberger trial, Miller said he
believes that Johnson is likely to lose "simply be
cause judges do not like to get into complex
foreign policy and military matters."
In the event that an unfavorable verdict is
reached, Johnson has two options: a hearing by
the entire 9th Circuit or an appeal to the United
States Supreme Court.
Johnson has said that the former "seems ap
propriate." Miller also recommended that option
as a means for "generating publicity and public
debate" on the trial.
