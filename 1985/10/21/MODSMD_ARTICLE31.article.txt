### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Cardinal strikers Giancarlo Feruzzi and An
gel Vazquez continued their scoring ways Sat
urday afternoon as the Stanford men's soccer
team defeated the St. Mary's Gaels 3-0 in a
Pacific Soccer Conference game.
Vazquez scored for the third game in a row,
while Feruzzi scored in his second consecutive
game. The two seniors helped Stanford raise
its record to 3-1 in the Pacific Soccer Confer
ence and 8-6-2 overall.
Stanford dominated the Gaels — 1-3 in the
conference and 2-10-2 overall — from the
beginning.

And just 14 minutes into the game, Feruzzi,
with a little help from his teammates, gave the
Cardinal squad something to show for its
dominance. Feruzzi's fellow senior, Cassio
Conceicao, had a direct kick from 25 yards and
passed to midfielder Tom Rafalovich on the
right wing.
Rafalovich quickly crossed the ball into the
penalty area where Feruzzi booted it in for his
third goal of the season.
The first half ended exactly as it had begun
— with a Stanford score.
With only a minute remaining in the half,
Rafalovich delivered a lead pass to freshman
Brian Mahaffey. Mahaffey had one man to beat
at the 18-yard marker when he saw Vazquez

coming on his right.
The freshman then touched the ball out to
Vazquez, who drilled it between St.Mary's
goaltender Randall Smith and the near post,
and Stanford led at halftime 2-0.
The Gaels gave up Stanford's final goal on an
unusual play. With 4 minutes left in the game,
Cardinal forward Rob West tried to pass to
Mahaffey in the penalty area. A Gael defender
attempted to clear the ball, but instead he
misplayed it, and the ball ended up in his own
goal.
"That was a team goal — the result of good
team pressure rather than my goal," said
Mahaffey, who was credited with
the score.
