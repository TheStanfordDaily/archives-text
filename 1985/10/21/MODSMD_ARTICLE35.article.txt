Nuclear Trade Threatens Pact
WASHINGTON — China has been discussing or engaging in nu
clear trade with the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime in Iran
and has exported nuclear-related material to several nations
suspected of working to obtain nuclear weapons, including low
enrichment uranium to South Africa, according to Sen. Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.)
As a result, Cranston will call today for Congress to deny approval
of a U.S.-China nuclear cooperation agreement, which was initialed
in April 1984, because he said it lacked adequate assurances that
China would not help other nations to develop nuclear weapons.
The agreement was submitted to Congress in July after a year of
U.S.-Chinese discussions on curbing Chinese nuclear exports to
Pakistan and other nations believed to be seeking the capability to
make bombs.
"Chinese actions suggest that we are dealing with a nation that
decidedly does not share our sense of nonproliferation obligations
which, by U.S. law, we must expect of our nuclear customers,"
Cranston said in a statement made available in advance to the Los
Angeles Times.
Senior U.S. officials, however, said that they have seen nothing in
the past year to suggest that China was not living up to its obligations
in its agreement to safeguard and to refuse to export nuclear materi
als and components useful in making bombs.

N. Ireland Agreement Sought
LONDON — After 11 months of quiet negotiations, the British
and Irish governments are reportedly close to agreement on a for
mula they see as a first step toward ending 16 years of sectarian vio
lence in Northern Ireland.
Few details have been made public, but Britain is believed to have
offered the Irish Republic a formal role in Northern Ireland as part of
a plan aimed at ending the political isolation of the British-ruled prov
ince's minority Catholic community and boosting its confidence in
British government institutions.
"Ending the alienation of the minority is the key," a senior Irish
government official said. 'Without it, there can be no agreement."
A high-ranking British government official said: "It is not the ul
timate solution. What we're talking about is an important beginning."
People familiar with the talks, here and in Dublin, believe that for
mal announcement of an agreement could come early next month.
Officials in both capitals caution, however, that negotiations are not
yet complete.
If the talks succeed, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
and her Irish counterpart, Garret FitzGerald, are expected to meet
to sign the accord.
The Irish Republic's involvement, possibly in the form of having an
Irish government minister take up residence in Belfast, Northern
Ireland's provincial capital, would be consultative only. Britain would
retain sovereignty in the province, where Protestants outnumber
Catholics about two to one.
Soviet Killed, Caller Says
MANAMA, Bahrain — A caller claiming to represent the Islamic
Liberation Front said yesterday that the underground Lebanese
group had executed another Soviet diplomat.
The Voice of Lebanon radio station, monitored here by the
Bahrain-based Gulf News Agency, quoted the caller as saying the
body of the diplomat had been dumped near the sports compound in
southern Beirut.
The front kidnapped four Soviet diplomats last month and subse
quently killed one of them to press demands for an end to Syrian
backed militia attacks against Moslem forces in the northern
Lebanese city of Tripoli.
The caller said the second killing was because the Soviets had
failed to comply with the front's demands for complete evacuation of
the Soviet Embassy in Beirut.
Ortega Defends Restrictions
NEW YORK — Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, defending
last week's imposition of sweeping restrictions on civil rights, said
yesterday they were necessary to prevent "terrorism, sabotage and
assassination attempts" by opponents of the Sandinista government.
Ortega, in New York for the 40th anniversary session of the
United Nations, said the government also had to crack down on the
press and on activism by Roman Catholic priests to prevent
"propaganda" against the draft at a time when many Nicaraguan sol
diers are winding up their two-year hitches and new recruits are pre
paring to enlist.
To repair what he acknowledged was a "public relations" problem
in the wake of the new restrictions on civil liberties, Ortega has
planned meetings with dozens of heads of state and other foreign of
ficials, as well as a television appearance on "The Phil Donahue
Show."
Craxi Accepts Reagan's Letter
ROME — Italy's caretaker Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, whose
government collapsed in the wake of American actions in the Achille
Lauro affair, accepted a "particularly friendly" letter from President
Reagan Saturday and said he will go to New York for this week's
meeting of Western leaders at the United Nations if he is still in of
fice.
Reagan's "Dear Bettino-Sincerely Ron" letter, hand-delivered by
Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead, said the president is
"anxious to see you next week in New York for the session of con
sultations which we will have with our major allies." The letter
added: "I never had any doubt that your government would proceed
rapidly with the prosecution of the hijackers of the Achille Lauro."
The fate of the Socialist prime minister, who was forced to resign
after what most Italian press reports characterized as "arrogant"
American disregard for Italian sovereignty in a series of events after
the ship hijacking, rests on efforts by Italian President Francesco
Cossiga to construct a new governing consensus around the five
party coalition that Craxi led for 26 months.
Whitehead, met for an hour and 45 minutes with Craxi Saturday
morning before flying on to Cairo to attempt a similar reconciliation
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, whose rule also was
weakened by the American interception of the Egypt Air 737 carrying
the accused hijackers of the Achille Lauro and two Palestine Libera
tion Organization officials.
In a quickly penned statement to reporters after meeting with
Craxi, Whitehead said, "We agreed that the events of the past few
weeks indicate the need for better coordination between all nations
in the ongoing fight against terrorism. We also agreed that both of
our countries have an important stake in maintaining and enhancing
the broad and deep relations that we have had in the past."

Lebanese city of Tripoli.
The caller said the second killing was because the Soviets had
failed to comply with the front's demands for complete evacuation of
the Soviet Embassy in Beirut.
Ortega Defends Restrictions
NEW YORK — Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, defending
last week's imposition of sweeping restrictions on civil rights, said
yesterday they were necessary to prevent "terrorism, sabotage and
assassination attempts" by opponents of the Sandinista government.
Ortega, in New York for the 40th anniversary session of the
United Nations, said the government also had to crack down on the
press and on activism by Roman Catholic priests to prevent
"propaganda" against the draft at a time when many Nicaraguan sol
diers are winding up their two-year hitches and new recruits are pre
paring to enlist.
To repair what he acknowledged was a "public relations" problem
in the wake of the new restrictions on civil liberties, Ortega has
planned meetings with dozens of heads of state and other foreign of
ficials, as well as a television appearance on "The Phil Donahue
Show."
Craxi Accepts Reagan's Letter
ROME — Italy's caretaker Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, whose
government collapsed in the wake of American actions in the Achille
Lauro affair, accepted a "particularly friendly" letter from President
Reagan Saturday and said he will go to New York for this week's
meeting of Western leaders at the United Nations if he is still in of
fice.
Reagan's "Dear Bettino-Sincerely Ron" letter, hand-delivered by
Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead, said the president is
"anxious to see you next week in New York for the session of con
sultations which we will have with our major allies." The letter
added: "I never had any doubt that your government would proceed
rapidly with the prosecution of the hijackers of the Achille Lauro."
The fate of the Socialist prime minister, who was forced to resign
after what most Italian press reports characterized as "arrogant"
American disregard for Italian sovereignty in a series of events after
the ship hijacking, rests on efforts by Italian President Francesco
Cossiga to construct a new governing consensus around the five
party coalition that Craxi led for 26 months.
Whitehead, met for an hour and 45 minutes with Craxi Saturday
morning before flying on to Cairo to attempt a similar reconciliation
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, whose rule also was
weakened by the American interception of the Egypt Air 737 carrying
the accused hijackers of the Achille Lauro and two Palestine Libera
tion Organization officials.
In a quickly penned statement to reporters after meeting with
Craxi, Whitehead said, "We agreed that the events of the past few
weeks indicate the need for better coordination between all nations
in the ongoing fight against terrorism. We also agreed that both of
our countries have an important stake in maintaining and enhancing
the broad and deep relations that we have had in the past."
Nuclear Trade Threatens Pact
WASHINGTON — China has been discussing or engaging in nu
clear trade with the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime in Iran
and has exported nuclear-related material to several nations
suspected of working to obtain nuclear weapons, including low
enrichment uranium to South Africa, according to Sen. Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.)
As a result, Cranston will call today for Congress to deny approval
of a U.S.-China nuclear cooperation agreement, which was initialed
in April 1984, because he said it lacked adequate assurances that
China would not help other nations to develop nuclear weapons.
The agreement was submitted to Congress in July after a year of
U.S.-Chinese discussions on curbing Chinese nuclear exports to
Pakistan and other nations believed to be seeking the capability to
make bombs.
"Chinese actions suggest that we are dealing with a nation that
decidedly does not share our sense of nonproliferation obligations
which, by U.S. law, we must expect of our nuclear customers,"
Cranston said in a statement made available in advance to the Los
Angeles Times.
Senior U.S. officials, however, said that they have seen nothing in
the past year to suggest that China was not living up to its obligations
in its agreement to safeguard and to refuse to export nuclear materi
als and components useful in making bombs.

N. Ireland Agreement Sought
LONDON — After 11 months of quiet negotiations, the British
and Irish governments are reportedly close to agreement on a for
mula they see as a first step toward ending 16 years of sectarian vio
lence in Northern Ireland.
Few details have been made public, but Britain is believed to have
offered the Irish Republic a formal role in Northern Ireland as part of
a plan aimed at ending the political isolation of the British-ruled prov
ince's minority Catholic community and boosting its confidence in
British government institutions.
"Ending the alienation of the minority is the key," a senior Irish
government official said. 'Without it, there can be no agreement."
A high-ranking British government official said: "It is not the ul
timate solution. What we're talking about is an important beginning."
People familiar with the talks, here and in Dublin, believe that for
mal announcement of an agreement could come early next month.
Officials in both capitals caution, however, that negotiations are not
yet complete.
If the talks succeed, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
and her Irish counterpart, Garret FitzGerald, are expected to meet
to sign the accord.
The Irish Republic's involvement, possibly in the form of having an
Irish government minister take up residence in Belfast, Northern
Ireland's provincial capital, would be consultative only. Britain would
retain sovereignty in the province, where Protestants outnumber
Catholics about two to one.
Soviet Killed, Caller Says
MANAMA, Bahrain — A caller claiming to represent the Islamic
Liberation Front said yesterday that the underground Lebanese
group had executed another Soviet diplomat.
The Voice of Lebanon radio station, monitored here by the
Bahrain-based Gulf News Agency, quoted the caller as saying the
body of the diplomat had been dumped near the sports compound in
southern Beirut.
The front kidnapped four Soviet diplomats last month and subse
quently killed one of them to press demands for an end to Syrian
backed militia attacks against Moslem forces in the northern
Lebanese city of Tripoli.
The caller said the second killing was because the Soviets had
failed to comply with the front's demands for complete evacuation of
the Soviet Embassy in Beirut.
