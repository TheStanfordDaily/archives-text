## U.S. Envoy Seeks To Calm Egyptian Ire 
### 
CAIRO, Egypt — A special Reagan Adminis
tration envoy met with Egypt's foreign minister
yesterday in an effort to smooth over relations
deeply strained since the interception of an offi
cial Egyptian plane carrying the hijackers of the
cruise ship Achille Lauro.
A U.S. Embassy official described the mood
as "upbeat" at the 75-minute meeting between
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead
and Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-
Meguid, and a subsequent lunch that included
President Hosni Mubarak's top national security
adviser.
Whitehead delivered a message on "recent
developments in the area" to Abdel-Meguid from
Secretary of State George Shultz, Foreign Mini
stry spokesman said.
Whitehead is to meet today with Mubarak,
who charged in a CBS-TV "60 Minutes" inter
view taped here Saturday that Tunisia and the
United States jointly tricked Egypt into sending
the plane carrying the accused Achille Lauro
hijackers to Tunis and then refusing it permis
sion to land so it could be intercepted by U.S.
Navy jets.
Mubarak also told CBS that he had tried to
send the hijackers to another, unnamed country,
but ordered them brought back when he found
that "there was no responsible man of the PLO
to receive them" there.
He called the U.S. interception of the Egyp

tian plane "a stab in the back . . . from a friend,"
but said he understood that "if we were in your
position also, we would not apologize." Mubarak
suggested, however, that "there are several
forms for apology."
Egypt is the second stop on Whitehead's
three-nation fence-mending mission, which
began in Rome Saturday and will continue in
Tunisia, where normally cordial relations with
the United States were undermined by Presi
dent Reagan's initial unconditional backing for Is
rael's raid on the headquarters of the Palestine
Liberation Organization outside Tunis on Oct. 1.
Whitehead's visit here comes as both Cairo
and Washington find themselves hard-pressed to
renew their formerly warm and mutually vital
ties at the same time that they seek to satisfy
the demands of national pride and their domestic
constituencies.
The question of an apology is the essential
stumbling block.
Reagan has refused to apologize because the
United States considered its action necessary to
bring the accused hijackers to justice for the
murder of 69-year-old Leon Klinghoffer.
"What are you asking us to apologize for?" one
U.S. official demanded privately prior to
Whitehead's arrival. But he also suggested a
diplomatic maneuver around the impasse.
If the answer is "for arresting the hijackers,"
the American response will be "Never," this offi

cial said.
"But if you are asking the Americans to say
they understand" the feelings of Mubarak and
the people here, then clearly "we're not happy
that they are feeling so angry and so bruised,"
the official said.
U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Veliotes issued a
public statement last week in an attempt to begin
this process of splitting the differences. One
U.S. official called the Whitehead visit "a gesture
on the public, political, psychological front."
Anti-American sentiment appears to be run
ning higher here than at any time in a decade.
At least two violent demonstrations denounc
ing the United States have rocked Cairo's uni
versity since the plane interception, only to be
broken up by police charges and tear gas. Many
Americans have been warned by their employers
and private schools to be cautious on the streets.
Meanwhile, neither Mubarak nor the semioffi
cial press has accepted key points in the U.S.
case against the Palestinians.
Egypt, when it decided to intervene in the
hijacking of the Italian cruise ship, asked repre
sentatives of the PLO to handle the negotiations.
The man the PLO chose was Mohammed Ab
bas, head of the splinter group Palestine Libera
tion Front, whose men took over the ship after it
left the Egyptian port of Alexandria. The United
States has accused Abbas of conceiving and or
dering the hijacking operation.
