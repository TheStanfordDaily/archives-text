United States, hoped to receive an
answer soon from Hussein, to
whom he had proposed direct,
"high-level talks" either in Amman,
Jerusalem, Washington or Geneva.
In a television interview yester
day in New York, Peres was more

cautious than in the newspaper in
terview, saying he might be willing
to make concessions on the issue of
the West Bank, but would do so
only if Jordan would engage in
serious peace negotiations with Is
rael.
Appearing on ABC's "This Week
With David Brinkley," Peres ruled
out the creation of a separate Pales
tinian state but left open the possi
bility of some form of autonomous
administration for the area.
Chadashot reported that Peres
said he wanted an American dele
gate to be present at any talks be
tween the Israeli and the Jordanian
delegations. He was also interested
in inviting one or several Palestinian
representatives who have "no con
nection with the PLO," according
to the newspaper.

He stressed that he was ready to
meet Hussein "everywhere and at
any time," the newspaper re
ported.
Peres made a significant conces
sion to Hussein on Friday by indica
ting that, under certain conditions,
he would be willing to accept Hus
sein's proposal for an international
conference to discuss the Mideast
situation.
According to recent Israeli press
reports, Peres is said to have met
secretly with Hussein Oct. 4 and on
several other occasions. Shamir,
speaking on Israeli radio Saturday,
refused to confirm or deny these
reports.
The foreign minister said he had
not shared the opinion of his col
leagues in the conservative Likud
block that Peres was negotiating
"too independently" in Washington.
