Canadian UAW Settles
DETROIT — Chrysler and the independent
United Auto Workers of Canada reached a
tentative agreement yesterday to end the five
day-old strike by Chrysler's 10,000 Canadian
workers, increasing pressure on the American
UAW to bring a quick end to its nationwide
walkout against the No. 3 auto maker.
With rank-and-file union members expected
to approve the proposed 23-month contract in
ratification voting today, Chrysler's Canadian
workers could be back on their jobs as early as
this afternoon. The company warned yester
day, however, that they may be laid off again
by the end of the week, due to shortages of
U.S.-built parts, if the American strike isn't re
solved.
The Canadian union, which split from the
American UAW last year and bargained sepa
rately with Chrysler, won its key demand that
Chrysler pay the same wages and benefits
General Motors and Ford pay their Canadian
workers, union and company officials said yes
terday.
In the United States, however, bargaining
efforts to end the strike of 70,000 Chrysler
workers broke off Friday, with little progress
reported. Negotiations were to resume today,
but it appeared yesterday that the settlement
in Canada might add to the mounting pressure

on union leaders to cut the costly strike short
and gain a quick agreement.
Hostage Body Returns
NEW YORK — A military honor guard,
elected officials and relatives of Leon Klinghof
fer, who was slain during the hijacking of the
cruise ship Achille Lauro, gathered at Ken
nedy Airport yesterday as the body of the 69-
year-old New Yorker was returned home.
Klinghoffer's body arrived shortly after 3:30
p.m. on a flight from Rome. His flag-draped
coffin was wheeled onto an airport runway
where a short ceremony took place.
Speakers including U.S. Sens. Daniel
Moynihan (D-N.Y.) and Alfonse D'Amato (R-
N.Y.) extolled Klinghoffer's courage.
D'Amato said he and Rep. Theodore Weiss
(D-N.Y.) who also spoke at the airport cere
mony, would propose today that Klinghoffer
be awarded the congressional Medal of Honor.
Puritan Ruins Found
BOSTON — Archaeologists working near
Bunker Hill said yesterday they have uncov
ered hundreds of artifacts in the 350-year-old
ruins of the first meeting house in the Massa

chusetts Bay Colony, where Gov. John
Winthrop once lived and ruled.
"I think it's one of the most important ar
chaeological finds in the country right now,"
said Mike Roberts, the site's project manager.
"This is the heart of Massachusetts."
The 800-square-foot foundation of "Great
House," built in 1629, was discovered beneath
a small city park in Boston's Charlestown sec
tion.
The town was originally laid out by about
100 Puritans, headed by engineer Thomas
Graves, who were hired by the Massachusetts
Bay Company of England to settle there from
Salem.
Quakes Rattles NYC
NEW YORK — An earthquake, minor by of
ficial standards, but apparently the largest to
center near the New York metropolitan area,
shook skyscrapers and rattled nerves from
Philadelphia to southern Canada at 6:08 Satur
day morning.
It measured 3.8 on the Richter scale, and
was felt most strongly near New Rochelle in
Westchester County, about 20 miles north of
New York City.
No injuries or serious property damage
were reported.
