2nd Reactor Activated
SAN LUIS OBISPO — The Diablo Canyon
nuclear power plant's Unit 2 reactor produced
its first electricity yesterday, a Pacific Gas &
Electric Co. spokesman said.
At 5:57 a.m., the reactor's generators
started delivering 100,000 kilowatts — enough
to meet the electricity needs of about 100,000
people — into the regional power grid,
spokesman Chuck Peterson said.
"That is a milestone," he said.
The reactor was operating at about 15 per
cent of its rated capacity of 1.1 million
kilowatts as part of a test in which output is
being gradually increased, he said. By Decem
ber, Unit 2 is expected to operate at full
capacity.

Unit 1 at the $5.6 billion, twin-reactor plant,
located on the coast, mid-way between Los
Angeles and San Francisco, reached full power
May 6.
The two units together are designed to
produce 2.2 million kilowatts of electricity, or
enough power to meet the needs of about 2
million people, Peterson said.
Last Fire Almost Out
LOS ANGELES — Firefighters drew close
yesterday to declaring victory over the last of
a plague of Southern California brushfires, but
were hampered by rough terrain in the depths
of the Los Padres National Forest.
Crews had cut a line of barren ground

around 95 percent of the fire's active area and
expected to finish the last half-mile of the line
by 6 p.m., said U.S. Forest Service spokes
man Carl Summerfield.
Richmond Drug Drive
RICHMOND — After months of planning, a
strike force of police and sheriffs deputies
begin today a $350,000 drive to clean drug
dealers out of west Contra Costa County.
"We will go anywhere," in the target area,
said Richmond Police Lt. George Ewing, co
ordinator of the project, sparked by citizen
complaints of brazen drug-dealing on the
streets of the city and its unincorporated
northern portions.
