# Frosh Program Savors Hale Bodies

### LAIE CAINDEC 
Freshmen who want to avoid
gaining the dreaded "freshman 10"
can now take advantage of an ex
perimental health program that
could improve their eating and ex
ercising habits.
Students from six all-freshman
dorms can volunteer to participate
in the Health Enhancement Pro
gram, a study conducted by
graduate student Jack Martin for his
doctoral dissertation.
With approval from the Stanford
Human Subjects Committee, Mar
tin can freely investigate whether
or not the health plan, if run as part
of the Stanford academic curricu

lum, would benefit the student.
Martin called his health program
both an opportunity for students to
learn about factors that affect their
health and an easy way to earn up
to three units from the Medical
School this year.
"This program is designed to
help freshmen cope with the exper
ience of being a student at Stan
ford," Martin says in the consent
form that Health Enhancement sub
jects sign before participating.
In a brief outline of the activities
planned for fall quarter, Martin tells
students what to expect from a
weekly seminar titled
"Understanding Your Weight — a
Guide to Weight Management."
"This course will show you how

to avoid the 'Stanford 10' and keep
slim and trim throughout your life,"
Martin says in the outline.
This health information is
available to only four of the six par
ticipating dorms; the other two,
Larkin and Donner, will be part of
the control group that will repre
sent "what happens to a Stanford
freshman when there is no health
program," Martin said.
Freshmen in these two dorms
will contribute data only at the
beginning and end of the year, in
cluding measurements of initial
weight, percentage of body fat and
information on general health atti
tudes. Providing this information
will earn control group freshmen
one academic credit in the spring

quarter of this year.
The second section of Martin's
program, the program group, is
represented by Madera and Otero.
Individuals in these dorms will
receive weekly packets on healthy
living at Stanford and on problems
relating to the Stanford student,
Martin said.
The problems he includes are the
relationships between health and
friends, "dealing with test anxiety"
and "stress management," which
will be covered by health papers
delivered every week to the door of
each student.
A topic Martin considers more
important than some of the others
is that of changing personal behav
ior, which will be discussed by Al
bert Bandura, a professor in the
Department of Psychology.
Martin is testing the likelihood of
students paying more attention to
their health if nutritional information
is readily available. His hypothesis
is: "The more convenient you make
[physical fitness] for people, the
more likely they are to (remain
healthy)."
Adam Shapiro, one of Martin's
teaching assistants, agrees with
Martin's hypothesis. "The main
focus of this program is to bring
things to the students . . . right to
their doorsteps. That's the great
thing about it," said Shapiro.
Students in Trancos and Rin
conada will comprise the group,
which will have the greatest amount
of information made available during
the experiment.
Students in the information and
behavior program group, as Martin
calls them, will receive up to three
credits if they participate in the pro
gram for three quarters.
In addition to receiving the
weekly information packets and

being able to attend the voluntary
lecture series, this group will be
able to participate in various
planned physical activities.
Included in these activities are
aerobic dance classes, an exercise
class for non-exercisers — Martin's
slogan is "no pain, but plenty of
gain" — a "Health Olympics" event
between the two dorms and healthy
eating contests.

'No pain, but plenty
of gain.'
— Jack Martin

Martin and Shapiro both agree
that a lot of planning has gone into
this undertaking and that much
more will be required as the year
progresses. Instead of locking
themselves into a fixed structure
however, they will "go with the
flow," Shapiro said.
"The response has been
amazingly positive. ... In fact,

some of the older students have
wished that the program was
around for them," said Shapiro.
"I'll be able to measure the
change in my own fitness and see
my own improvement . . . that's
just as good as seeing the results,"
Rinconada freshman Phil Klein said.
"I'm surprised it hasn't been done
before."
Another freshman praised the
program because of what he'll learn
from it.
"I find out things like what body
fat is. I never knew that before,"
Trancos freshman Tom Griesser
said. "As long as they don't hook
me up to an electrical outlet," he
said he does not see any danger in
participating in the experiment.
"With such tight schedules, you
don't have time for exercising, so
it's good that it's available," Rin
conada freshman Charlene Brekka
said.
Peter Seymour, a control group
freshman from Larkin, said, "We're
sort of the group that represents
the average freshman. [Martin]
thinks your average freshman's
health is going to decline over the
year because he has no physical ac
tivity and doesn't eat right.
"I think I can get enough exer
cise and eat right by myself,"
Seymour said.
