# Frosh Program Savors Hale Bodies

### LAIE CAINDEC 
Freshmen who want to avoid
gaining the dreaded "freshman 10"
can now take advantage of an ex
perimental health program that
could improve their eating and ex
ercising habits.
Students from six all-freshman
dorms can volunteer to participate
in the Health Enhancement Pro
gram, a study conducted by
graduate student Jack Martin for his
doctoral dissertation.
With approval from the Stanford
Human Subjects Committee, Mar
tin can freely investigate whether
or not the health plan, if run as part
of the Stanford academic curricu

lum, would benefit the student.
Martin called his health program
both an opportunity for students to
learn about factors that affect their
health and an easy way to earn up
to three units from the Medical
School this year.
"This program is designed to
help freshmen cope with the exper
ience of being a student at Stan
ford," Martin says in the consent
form that Health Enhancement sub
jects sign before participating.
In a brief outline of the activities
planned for fall quarter, Martin tells
students what to expect from a
weekly seminar titled
"Understanding Your Weight â€” a
Guide to Weight Management."
"This course will show you how

to avoid the 'Stanford 10' and keep
slim and trim throughout your life,"
Martin says in the outline.
This health information is
available to only four of the six par
ticipating dorms; the other two,
Larkin and Donner, will be part of
the control group that will repre
sent "what happens to a Stanford
freshman when there is no health
program," Martin said.
Freshmen in these two dorms
will contribute data only at the
beginning and end of the year, in
cluding measurements of initial
weight, percentage of body fat and
information on general health atti
tudes. Providing this information
will earn control group freshmen
one academic credit in the spring

quarter of this year.
The second section of Martin's
program, the program group, is
represented by Madera and Otero.
Individuals in these dorms will
receive weekly packets on healthy
living at Stanford and on problems
relating to the Stanford student,
Martin said.
The problems he includes are the
relationships between health and
friends, "dealing with test anxiety"
and "stress management," which
will be covered by health papers
delivered every week to the door of
each student.
A topic Martin considers more
important than some of the others
