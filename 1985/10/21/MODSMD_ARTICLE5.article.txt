# Thousand Anticipated For Parents Weekend
## 
### DAVID SCHWARTZ 
This Friday and Saturday will
mark the return of Stanford Par
ents Weekend after a 15-year ab
sence.
Approximately 1,000 parents
will be treated to a two-day pro
gram that includes tours of the
University, special faculty
lectures, dinner in the dorms, a
speech by University President
Donald Kennedy, a visit to the
new Rodin Sculpture Garden and
Saturday's Stanford-Arizona
football game.
The schedule also provides
parents with the chance to at
tend classes on Friday, listen to
a faculty panel discuss the Uni
versity's policies toward educa
tion and meet with members of
student service offices.
"The response to the event
has been fabulous," said
Deborah Duncan, director of the
Parents Fund in the Office of De
velopment. "We've been getting
responses from all over the
country, even a call from
Africa."
Junior Tanya Novak, who is
assisting Duncan with registra
tion and logistics, added, "I've
been impressed by the number
of parents coming from out-of
state. . . . I've seen registra
tions from Maryland, Florida,

Missouri and a lot of other places
outside California."
The idea for the revival of the
parents' weekend came from a
Parents Fund volunteer last year
whose five children attended
Stanford. Duncan visited other
colleges — including every Ivy
League school — in order to
formulate Stanford's plans.
"I took what I liked best from
each one and incorporated it into
ours," Duncan said. "Some of
the schools had sophomore or
junior class parents' weekends,
but we preferred bringing the
whole thing together."
The greatest logistical prob
lem the event's planners faced
was making the necessary 1,000
dinner reservations for the par
ents through University Food
Service, eating clubs, Row and
independent houses and eating
societies. To help overcome
such obstacles, the organizers
have been getting help from
throughout the University.
"I think many people realize
what a good thing this is for
Stanford and Stanford parents,
and they want to be as helpful as
possible," Duncan explained.
"The main part behind the
weekend," Novak said, "is to
show off all the parts of the
school — from arts to athletics
— and present a little piece of
everything to the parents."
