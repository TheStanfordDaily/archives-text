# University Upholds Same Alcohol Policy

### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
University officials close to the
problem of alcohol abuse on campus
say that recent regulatory crack
downs on drinking games and other
alcohol-related incidents are in
keeping with a substance-abuse
policy the University has had in
place for almost two decades.
"We're a university, not a police

department," said Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons. "We're con
cerned that we maintain an educa
tional community within which stu
dents can function well."
Stanford's drinking policy, which
has been in place since 1966,
entrusts students with the respon
sibility of compliance with state
drinking laws and requires that al
coholic beverages not be the focus
of social events. When alcohol is
served, policy mandates that "food

and equally attractive and abundant
non-alcoholic beverages be pro
vided."
The University's previous policy
forbade "any student, regardless of
age, from possessing or consuming
?!coholic beverages on the
campus."
Residential Education has
recently stepped up its campaign
against alcohol abuse in student
residences. This fall's edition of the
RA handbook on alcohol and drug
abuse asks RAs to explain to stu
dents the dangers of drinking
games, to ask students to stop
drinking games already in progress
and to refrain from playing the
games themselves.
RAs are customarily encouraged
by Res Ed to educate students
about alcohol and substance abuse,
not to police them, according to
Alice Supton, assistant dean of Res
idential Education.
She said even though RAs should
ask people to stop drinking games
or to consider other alternatives,

they are not there to force students
lo win away irom such activities.
"The decision always rests with the
students," she said.
According to Supton, drinking
games have been focused on be
cause they are inherently antitheti
cal to University policy.
"In drinking games," Supton
said, "it is often the case that other
people make the decision for an in
dividual about whether or not that
individual will drink.
"However, the choice about
whether or not to drink alcohol has
to rest with the individual at every
stage of the game."
Supton went on to say that the
nature of drinking games is that
they are "potentially coercive. " She
illustrated this with the example of
the game "Quarters," in which she
said a group of individuals randomly
select a person to be the target of
entreaties to swig down a quantity
of alcohol.
According to Supton, the combi
nation of altered judgment created

by too many beers and the noise
of pounding fists and shouting
voices in a circle around the drinker
will often be more than enough to
get him to consume more alcohol.
Thus, Supton said, the question
of paramount concern to Res Ed is
"what happens to the issue of indi
vidual choice in a dnnking-game sit
uation."
She added, however, that Resi
dential Education does not "expect
RAs to act like the Fun Police in
Mem Strip."
Lyons said the University ap
proaches the issue of drinking from
a "community health" perspective
rather than a legalistic one. "We're
more concerned about the behavior
than we are about the causes of it,
when it comes to alcohol."
"For example," he said, "if
somebody consumes too much
booze and is disruptive in the dorm
and tears up his room or something
like that, I don't think anyone
around here worries whether he's
under or over 18 or 21. What people are going to worry about is,
What the hell's going on that caused this person to tear up their
dorm?' That's what we should be addressing.
"If you approach it as a medical and a behavioral issue, age then
becomes less important," Lyons said.
Lyons added that Stanford, as an educational institution, is more
committed to "putting together an educational program" than to
policing the student body.
"The law says you can't drink if you're under 21," Lyons said.
"Why doesn't the University do something about that?
"There's nothing operating around here to keep the public from
coming in and arresting people for drinking under-age. They just
don't do it,"he said. ,
Lyons emphasized that Stanford's responsibility is to be "lawful as
a corporate citizen," and since it is, it expects its students to adhere
to that same responsibility.
Supton said she hopes the new policy urging RAs to discourage
students from participating in drinking games will encourage a
dialogue about drinking in general and lead students to understand
the logic behind University drinking policies.
"We come from a philosophical position that students are respon
sible adults, capable of making informed decisions," she said, adding
that the intent of focusing on a particular aspect of student life is to
harmonize efforts to "make this a good place to be."
According to Lyons, current concern over the question of alcohol
abuse rose sharply at a series of Sigma Alpha Epsilon parties during
which the police were called in three times to defuse potentially dis
astrous situations.
Lyons said that one drunken SAE member wandered off to an ad
jacent dorm and started tearing things up and banging on doors. In
another instance, a high school student was found face down on the
fraternity house's lawn and had to be rushed to a hospital for treat
ment, Lyons said.
He went on to say that the unenforceability of the drinking age
laws raises the question of whether parties such as the one at SAE
should be allowed at all. Incidents at fraternities are a "new phenom
enon that seems to have gotten out of control," he said.
Lyons said that Stanford's policy on drug and substance abuse is in
the same bundle with its alcohol regulations in that it seeks to edu
cate before it seeks to discipline. The training manual given to RAs
at the beginning of the year recommends that each RA "actively dis
courage the use of drugs as a substitute for problem-solving and to
help residents find alternative and constructive ways to deal with
their problems."
Upon failure of that method, the manual goes on to suggest that
the RA ask the student to seek guidance from friends or from Coun
seling and Psychological Services (CAPS), the psychological arm of
the Cowell Student Health Center.
Should that also fail, the RA is instructed to seek out help for the
student himself, either from a resident fellow or from the dorm's
CAPS liaison. . u,r
Students who deal drugs in residences are dealt with swiftly under
University policy. RAs are told to inform their residential dean about
students they suspect are selling drugs, upon which, according to
the manual, "the residential dean will tell the student to stop selling
or face Fundamental Standard charges and possibly criminal charges
as well."
Lyons emphasized the fact that mental health issues are high on
the agenda of policy makers dealing with alcohol and substance
abuse. Although he questioned the extent to which incoming fresh
men need to be "protected," he said that University policy is in
tended to help freshmen have as unpolluted an experience their first
year as possible.
University policy makers "just don't like big drinking parties"
luring freshmen away from their dorms, Lyons said.
Res Ed sent a letter discussing the freshman issue to fraternities
and other self-ops that often sponsor parties early in the year.
Diana Conklin, assistant dean of Student Affairs, explained the in
tent of this policy in a letter that appeared in The Daily last week,
saying, "Residents were asked to avoid those problems and 'in gen
eral to be nondisruptive of the events and goals of freshman orienta
tion, especially as manifested in the residential experience.' "
"What we mean by this policy is that there should be no organized
efforts, the results of which would work against the residence-based
aspects of the freshman experience. Clearly, individual frosh have
the same rights as any other students to visit anyone they choose,
anywhere on campus."
Another mental health issue that concerns policy makers is the ex
tent to which alcohol as a stress-reducing agent can take away from
students' desire to find healthier, if less easy, methods to handle
their problems, according to Lyons.
"Stanford is a deceptively stressful place," Lyons said. "People
ask, 'How do I learn to balance my life between working my tail off
one minute and the need to center myself, to get some space, to get
some perspective, rest and relaxation the other?' "
Lyons said alcohol is a solution to the dilemma, but when it begins
taking away from other, healthier methods, like "sitting in a chair and
doing nothing," then there is cause for concern.
That concern is what the University is trying to address in its
policy, according to Lyons. He conceded that there are no direct
answers to the question of alcohol abuse on a university campus.
But, he added, "we'd just as soon not put our heads in the sand."

University policy. RAs are told to inform their residential dean about
students they suspect are selling drugs, upon which, according to
the manual, "the residential dean will tell the student to stop selling
or face Fundamental Standard charges and possibly criminal charges
as well."
Lyons emphasized the fact that mental health issues are high on
the agenda of policy makers dealing with alcohol and substance
abuse. Although he questioned the extent to which incoming fresh
men need to be "protected," he said that University policy is in
tended to help freshmen have as unpolluted an experience their first
year as possible.
University policy makers "just don't like big drinking parties"
luring freshmen away from their dorms, Lyons said.
Res Ed sent a letter discussing the freshman issue to fraternities
and other self-ops that often sponsor parties early in the year.
Diana Conklin, assistant dean of Student Affairs, explained the in
tent of this policy in a letter that appeared in The Daily last week,
saying, "Residents were asked to avoid those problems and 'in gen
eral to be nondisruptive of the events and goals of freshman orienta

"What we mean by this policy is that there should be no organized
efforts, the results of which would work against the residence-based
aspects of the freshman experience. Clearly, individual frosh have
the same rights as any other students to visit anyone they choose,
anywhere on campus."
Another mental health issue that concerns policy makers is the ex
tent to which alcohol as a stress-reducing agent can take away from
students' desire to find healthier, if less easy, methods to handle
their problems, according to Lyons.
"Stanford is a deceptively stressful place," Lyons said. "People
ask, 'How do I learn to balance my life between working my tail off
one minute and the need to center myself, to get some space, to get
some perspective, rest and relaxation the other?' "
Lyons said alcohol is a solution to the dilemma, but when it begins
taking away from other, healthier methods, like "sitting in a chair and
doing nothing," then there is cause for concern.
That concern is what the University is trying to address in its
policy, according to Lyons. He conceded that there are no direct
answers to the question of alcohol abuse on a university campus.
But, he added, "we'd just as soon not put our heads in the sand."
University officials close to the
problem of alcohol abuse on campus
say that recent regulatory crack

policy the University has had in

Stanford's drinking policy, which
has been in place since 1966,
entrusts students with the respon

drinking laws and requires that al
coholic beverages not be the focus
of social events. When alcohol is

The University's previous policy
forbade "any student, regardless of

Residential Education has
recently stepped up its campaign
against alcohol abuse in student
residences. This fall's edition of the
RA handbook on alcohol and drug
abuse asks RAs to explain to stu
dents the dangers of drinking
games, to ask students to stop
drinking games already in progress
and to refrain from playing the
games themselves.
RAs are customarily encouraged
by Res Ed to educate students
about alcohol and substance abuse,
not to police them, according to
Alice Supton, assistant dean of Res
idential Education.
She said even though RAs should
ask people to stop drinking games
or to consider other alternatives,

they are not there to force students
lo win away irom such activities.
"The decision always rests with the
students," she said.
According to Supton, drinking
games have been focused on be
cause they are inherently antitheti
cal to University policy.
"In drinking games," Supton
said, "it is often the case that other
people make the decision for an in
dividual about whether or not that
individual will drink.
"However, the choice about
whether or not to drink alcohol has
to rest with the individual at every
stage of the game."
Supton went on to say that the
nature of drinking games is that
they are "potentially coercive. " She
illustrated this with the example of
the game "Quarters," in which she
said a group of individuals randomly
select a person to be the target of
entreaties to swig down a quantity
of alcohol.
According to Supton, the combi
nation of altered judgment created

by too many beers and the noise
of pounding fists and shouting
voices in a circle around the drinker
will often be more than enough to
get him to consume more alcohol.
Thus, Supton said, the question
of paramount concern to Res Ed is
"what happens to the issue of indi
vidual choice in a dnnking-game sit
uation."
She added, however, that Resi
dential Education does not "expect
RAs to act like the Fun Police in
Mem Strip."
Lyons said the University ap
proaches the issue of drinking from
a "community health" perspective
rather than a legalistic one. "We're
more concerned about the behavior
than we are about the causes of it,
when it comes to alcohol."
"For example," he said, "if
somebody consumes too much
booze and is disruptive in the dorm
and tears up his room or something
like that, I don't think anyone
around here worries whether he's
under or over 18 or 21. What people are going to worry about is,
What the hell's going on that caused this person to tear up their
dorm?' That's what we should be addressing.
"If you approach it as a medical and a behavioral issue, age then
becomes less important," Lyons said.
Lyons added that Stanford, as an educational institution, is more
committed to "putting together an educational program" than to
policing the student body.
"The law says you can't drink if you're under 21," Lyons said.
"Why doesn't the University do something about that?
"There's nothing operating around here to keep the public from
coming in and arresting people for drinking under-age. They just
don't do it,"he said. ,
Lyons emphasized that Stanford's responsibility is to be "lawful as
a corporate citizen," and since it is, it expects its students to adhere
to that same responsibility.
Supton said she hopes the new policy urging RAs to discourage
students from participating in drinking games will encourage a
dialogue about drinking in general and lead students to understand
the logic behind University drinking policies.
"We come from a philosophical position that students are respon
sible adults, capable of making informed decisions," she said, adding
that the intent of focusing on a particular aspect of student life is to
harmonize efforts to "make this a good place to be."
According to Lyons, current concern over the question of alcohol
abuse rose sharply at a series of Sigma Alpha Epsilon parties during
which the police were called in three times to defuse potentially dis
astrous situations.
Lyons said that one drunken SAE member wandered off to an ad
jacent dorm and started tearing things up and banging on doors. In
another instance, a high school student was found face down on the
fraternity house's lawn and had to be rushed to a hospital for treat
ment, Lyons said.
He went on to say that the unenforceability of the drinking age
laws raises the question of whether parties such as the one at SAE
should be allowed at all. Incidents at fraternities are a "new phenom
enon that seems to have gotten out of control," he said.
Lyons said that Stanford's policy on drug and substance abuse is in
the same bundle with its alcohol regulations in that it seeks to edu
cate before it seeks to discipline. The training manual given to RAs
at the beginning of the year recommends that each RA "actively dis
courage the use of drugs as a substitute for problem-solving and to
help residents find alternative and constructive ways to deal with
their problems."
Upon failure of that method, the manual goes on to suggest that
the RA ask the student to seek guidance from friends or from Coun
seling and Psychological Services (CAPS), the psychological arm of
the Cowell Student Health Center.
Should that also fail, the RA is instructed to seek out help for the
student himself, either from a resident fellow or from the dorm's
CAPS liaison. . u,r

"There's nothing operating around here to keep the public from
coming in and arresting people for drinking under-age. They just
don't do it,"he said. ,
Lyons emphasized that Stanford's responsibility is to be "lawful as
a corporate citizen," and since it is, it expects its students to adhere
to that same responsibility.
Supton said she hopes the new policy urging RAs to discourage
students from participating in drinking games will encourage a
dialogue about drinking in general and lead students to understand
the logic behind University drinking policies.
"We come from a philosophical position that students are respon
sible adults, capable of making informed decisions," she said, adding
that the intent of focusing on a particular aspect of student life is to
harmonize efforts to "make this a good place to be."
According to Lyons, current concern over the question of alcohol
abuse rose sharply at a series of Sigma Alpha Epsilon parties during
which the police were called in three times to defuse potentially dis
astrous situations.
Lyons said that one drunken SAE member wandered off to an ad
jacent dorm and started tearing things up and banging on doors. In
another instance, a high school student was found face down on the
fraternity house's lawn and had to be rushed to a hospital for treat
ment, Lyons said.
He went on to say that the unenforceability of the drinking age
laws raises the question of whether parties such as the one at SAE
should be allowed at all. Incidents at fraternities are a "new phenom
enon that seems to have gotten out of control," he said.
Lyons said that Stanford's policy on drug and substance abuse is in
the same bundle with its alcohol regulations in that it seeks to edu
cate before it seeks to discipline. The training manual given to RAs
at the beginning of the year recommends that each RA "actively dis
courage the use of drugs as a substitute for problem-solving and to
help residents find alternative and constructive ways to deal with
their problems."
Upon failure of that method, the manual goes on to suggest that
the RA ask the student to seek guidance from friends or from Coun
seling and Psychological Services (CAPS), the psychological arm of
the Cowell Student Health Center.
Should that also fail, the RA is instructed to seek out help for the
student himself, either from a resident fellow or from the dorm's
CAPS liaison. . u,r
Students who deal drugs in residences are dealt with swiftly under
University policy. RAs are told to inform their residential dean about
students they suspect are selling drugs, upon which, according to
the manual, "the residential dean will tell the student to stop selling
or face Fundamental Standard charges and possibly criminal charges
as well."
Lyons emphasized the fact that mental health issues are high on
the agenda of policy makers dealing with alcohol and substance
abuse. Although he questioned the extent to which incoming fresh
men need to be "protected," he said that University policy is in
tended to help freshmen have as unpolluted an experience their first
year as possible.
University policy makers "just don't like big drinking parties"
luring freshmen away from their dorms, Lyons said.
Res Ed sent a letter discussing the freshman issue to fraternities
and other self-ops that often sponsor parties early in the year.
Diana Conklin, assistant dean of Student Affairs, explained the in
tent of this policy in a letter that appeared in The Daily last week,
saying, "Residents were asked to avoid those problems and 'in gen
eral to be nondisruptive of the events and goals of freshman orienta
tion, especially as manifested in the residential experience.' "
"What we mean by this policy is that there should be no organized
efforts, the results of which would work against the residence-based
aspects of the freshman experience. Clearly, individual frosh have
the same rights as any other students to visit anyone they choose,
anywhere on campus."
Another mental health issue that concerns policy makers is the ex
tent to which alcohol as a stress-reducing agent can take away from
students' desire to find healthier, if less easy, methods to handle
their problems, according to Lyons.
"Stanford is a deceptively stressful place," Lyons said. "People
ask, 'How do I learn to balance my life between working my tail off
one minute and the need to center myself, to get some space, to get
some perspective, rest and relaxation the other?' "
Lyons said alcohol is a solution to the dilemma, but when it begins
taking away from other, healthier methods, like "sitting in a chair and
doing nothing," then there is cause for concern.
That concern is what the University is trying to address in its
policy, according to Lyons. He conceded that there are no direct
answers to the question of alcohol abuse on a university campus.
But, he added, "we'd just as soon not put our heads in the sand."
