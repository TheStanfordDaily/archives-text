# University Upholds Same Alcohol Policy

### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
University officials close to the
problem of alcohol abuse on campus
say that recent regulatory crack
downs on drinking games and other
alcohol-related incidents are in
keeping with a substance-abuse
policy the University has had in
place for almost two decades.
"We're a university, not a police

department," said Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons. "We're con
cerned that we maintain an educa
tional community within which stu
dents can function well."
Stanford's drinking policy, which
has been in place since 1966,
entrusts students with the respon
sibility of compliance with state
drinking laws and requires that al
coholic beverages not be the focus
of social events. When alcohol is
served, policy mandates that "food

and equally attractive and abundant
non-alcoholic beverages be pro
vided."
The University's previous policy
forbade "any student, regardless of
age, from possessing or consuming
?!coholic beverages on the
campus."
Residential Education has
recently stepped up its campaign
against alcohol abuse in student
residences. This fall's edition of the
RA handbook on alcohol and drug
abuse asks RAs to explain to stu
dents the dangers of drinking
games, to ask students to stop
drinking games already in progress
and to refrain from playing the
games themselves.
RAs are customarily encouraged
by Res Ed to educate students
about alcohol and substance abuse,
not to police them, according to
Alice Supton, assistant dean of Res
idential Education.
She said even though RAs should
ask people to stop drinking games
or to consider other alternatives,

they are not there to force students
lo win away irom such activities.
"The decision always rests with the
students," she said.
According to Supton, drinking
games have been focused on be
cause they are inherently antitheti
cal to University policy.
"In drinking games," Supton
said, "it is often the case that other
people make the decision for an in
dividual about whether or not that
individual will drink.
"However, the choice about
whether or not to drink alcohol has
to rest with the individual at every
stage of the game."
Supton went on to say that the
nature of drinking games is that
they are "potentially coercive. " She
illustrated this with the example of
the game "Quarters," in which she
said a group of individuals randomly
select a person to be the target of
entreaties to swig down a quantity
of alcohol.
According to Supton, the combi
nation of altered judgment created

by too many beers and the noise
of pounding fists and shouting
voices in a circle around the drinker
will often be more than enough to
get him to consume more alcohol.
Thus, Supton said, the question
of paramount concern to Res Ed is
"what happens to the issue of indi
vidual choice in a dnnking-game sit
uation."
She added, however, that Resi
dential Education does not "expect
RAs to act like the Fun Police in
Mem Strip."
Lyons said the University ap
proaches the issue of drinking from
a "community health" perspective
rather than a legalistic one. "We're
more concerned about the behavior
than we are about the causes of it,
when it comes to alcohol."
"For example," he said, "if
somebody consumes too much
booze and is disruptive in the dorm
and tears up his room or something
like that, I don't think anyone
around here worries whether he's
