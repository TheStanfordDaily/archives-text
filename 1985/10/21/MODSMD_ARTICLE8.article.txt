# Graduate Students Living In Campus Housing Ebb

### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
Identifying a trend can be much easier then justifying
its existence. The Escondido Program Center, for ex
ample, has noticed that fewer families are applying for
graduate housing at Escondido Village, but cannot ex
plain why the past two or three years have brought this
continuing decline.
Any family that wants to live on campus has the op
portunity to do so, according to Patricia Polhemus,
director of the Escondido Program Center. Although
there is no updated information, she said that most stu
dents with families do live on campus.
There are more than 1,700 single and married stu
dents living in Escondido Village this academic year,
according to Judy Eroe, an office assistant at Housing
Management.
Approximately 850 are single students and close to
900 are married, some with families, Eroe said. Data
on the total number of students with families was not
available.
Graduate student housing in Escondido includes a
total of 1,200 apartments that house 3,500 people, ap
proximately 25 percent of them children, Polhemus
said. The three high-rise complexes, McFarland,
Hulme and Blackwelder, house approximately 450
single students, Eroe said.

This means approximately 400 single students are
occupying married-couple high-rise and low-rise family
apartments, Eroe said. These figures, however, are
still estimates.
Speculation about reasons for this decline cover a
series of economic and social possibilities, from the
high cost of living to the high value of the dollar to the
postponement of married and family life in today's soci
ety.
The high cost of living in the Stanford and Palo Alto
area may have driven potential students to universities
with lower living expenses. At Escondido Village, a
two-bedroom unit costs $527 a month, and a three
bedroom unit costs $615 a month. Both include utilities
and maintenance.
But Polhemus said she doesn't think that "people are
moving off campus to save money," adding that rent in
the surrounding area is even more expensive than on
campus housing.
The Graduate Studies and Research Office, also
quite conscious of the high cost of living in this area,
has substantially increased the amount of fellowship,
student assistantship or University job money it offers ,
to graduate students, according to Karlene Dickey, as
sociate dean of graduate studies.
The amount of fellowship money currently given to
each fellowship recipient, regardless of marital status,
is $5,748 a year, Dickey said. This stipend is
in addition to tuition payments.
Two years ago, that amount was $5 000
and last year it was $5,328, she said. Each
year rents in the surrounding area are sur
veyed to help determine the appropriate fig
ure.
Yes, we do look at rents, but [rents and
stipends] don't go hand in hand. . . . They
don't necessarily rise at exactly the same
percent," Dickey said.
Dickey said, however, that "only a small
percent (of students) live off fellowships."
Fellowships apply only to certain depart
ments, usually in the humanities and social
sciences.
Most students, especially in the sciences,
have assistantships that vary in benefits from
$6,108 to $7,329 a year, Dickey said.
The amount of tuition grant available
depends upon the amount of academic time a
student must dedicate toward his appoint
ment, but the maximum tuition grant is for
nine units per quarter and is received only by
assistants who work 50 percent of the time,
according to the Graduate Studies and Re
search Office.
All awards at the graduate level are strictly
merit-based awards and do not consider fin
ancial standing, except at the professional
schools, Dickey said.
Another possible reason for the decrease

in family inhabitants at Escondido Village is
the high price of the dollar compared to
foreign currency. Polhemus estimated that
40 percent of the students residing here are
foreign. According to Dickey, foreign stu
dents are mainly funded by their respective
governments.
Venezuela is an example of a country that
formerly sent many students to Stanford but
no longer has the funds to do so, according to
Dickey.
No figures have been tabulated as to
whether the rise in the dollar has led to a
decline of the percentage of international stu
dents with families attending Stanford.
The type of student living in Escondido Vil
lage has also changed, which may account for
the drop in families, said Olivia Peterson, the
former married family housing assignment
counselor at the Escondido Program Center.
Students are finishing their degrees faster
because they have families. Therefore,
families are moving in and out at a faster rate,
Peterson said.
Students are also waiting longer to be
married and start a family, Polhemus said.
Pohlemus, Peterson and Dickey all
stressed the uniqueness and cohesiveness of
the environment at Escondido Village. It is a
place where people from all nationalities
come together and share similar educational
and family experiences, they said. They said
they hoped that current social and economic
trends would not destroy the atmosphere
that makes Escondido Village such a special
place.

two-bedroom unit costs $527 a month, and a three
bedroom unit costs $615 a month. Both include utilities
and maintenance.
But Polhemus said she doesn't think that "people are
moving off campus to save money," adding that rent in
the surrounding area is even more expensive than on
campus housing.
The Graduate Studies and Research Office, also
quite conscious of the high cost of living in this area,
has substantially increased the amount of fellowship,
student assistantship or University job money it offers ,
to graduate students, according to Karlene Dickey, as
sociate dean of graduate studies.
The amount of fellowship money currently given to
each fellowship recipient, regardless of marital status,
is $5,748 a year, Dickey said. This stipend is
in addition to tuition payments.
Two years ago, that amount was $5 000
and last year it was $5,328, she said. Each
year rents in the surrounding area are sur
veyed to help determine the appropriate fig
ure.
Yes, we do look at rents, but [rents and
stipends] don't go hand in hand. . . . They
don't necessarily rise at exactly the same
percent," Dickey said.
Dickey said, however, that "only a small
percent (of students) live off fellowships."
Fellowships apply only to certain depart
ments, usually in the humanities and social
sciences.
Most students, especially in the sciences,
have assistantships that vary in benefits from
$6,108 to $7,329 a year, Dickey said.
The amount of tuition grant available
depends upon the amount of academic time a
student must dedicate toward his appoint
ment, but the maximum tuition grant is for
nine units per quarter and is received only by
assistants who work 50 percent of the time,
according to the Graduate Studies and Re
search Office.
All awards at the graduate level are strictly
merit-based awards and do not consider fin
ancial standing, except at the professional
schools, Dickey said.
Another possible reason for the decrease

in family inhabitants at Escondido Village is
the high price of the dollar compared to
foreign currency. Polhemus estimated that
40 percent of the students residing here are
foreign. According to Dickey, foreign stu
dents are mainly funded by their respective
governments.
Venezuela is an example of a country that
formerly sent many students to Stanford but
no longer has the funds to do so, according to
Dickey.
No figures have been tabulated as to
whether the rise in the dollar has led to a
decline of the percentage of international stu
dents with families attending Stanford.
The type of student living in Escondido Vil
lage has also changed, which may account for
the drop in families, said Olivia Peterson, the
former married family housing assignment
counselor at the Escondido Program Center.
Students are finishing their degrees faster
because they have families. Therefore,
families are moving in and out at a faster rate,
Peterson said.
Students are also waiting longer to be
married and start a family, Polhemus said.
Pohlemus, Peterson and Dickey all
stressed the uniqueness and cohesiveness of
the environment at Escondido Village. It is a
place where people from all nationalities
come together and share similar educational
and family experiences, they said. They said
they hoped that current social and economic
trends would not destroy the atmosphere
that makes Escondido Village such a special
place.
Identifying a trend can be much easier then justifying
its existence. The Escondido Program Center, for ex
ample, has noticed that fewer families are applying for
graduate housing at Escondido Village, but cannot ex
plain why the past two or three years have brought this
continuing decline.
Any family that wants to live on campus has the op
portunity to do so, according to Patricia Polhemus,
director of the Escondido Program Center. Although
there is no updated information, she said that most stu
dents with families do live on campus.
There are more than 1,700 single and married stu
dents living in Escondido Village this academic year,
according to Judy Eroe, an office assistant at Housing
Management.
Approximately 850 are single students and close to
900 are married, some with families, Eroe said. Data
on the total number of students with families was not
available.
Graduate student housing in Escondido includes a
total of 1,200 apartments that house 3,500 people, ap
proximately 25 percent of them children, Polhemus
said. The three high-rise complexes, McFarland,
Hulme and Blackwelder, house approximately 450
single students, Eroe said.

This means approximately 400 single students are
occupying married-couple high-rise and low-rise family
apartments, Eroe said. These figures, however, are
still estimates.
Speculation about reasons for this decline cover a
series of economic and social possibilities, from the
high cost of living to the high value of the dollar to the
postponement of married and family life in today's soci
ety.
The high cost of living in the Stanford and Palo Alto
area may have driven potential students to universities
with lower living expenses. At Escondido Village, a
two-bedroom unit costs $527 a month, and a three
bedroom unit costs $615 a month. Both include utilities
and maintenance.
