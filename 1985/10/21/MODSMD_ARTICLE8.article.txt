Identifying a trend can be much easier then justifying
its existence. The Escondido Program Center, for ex
ample, has noticed that fewer families are applying for
graduate housing at Escondido Village, but cannot ex
plain why the past two or three years have brought this
continuing decline.
Any family that wants to live on campus has the op
portunity to do so, according to Patricia Polhemus,
director of the Escondido Program Center. Although
there is no updated information, she said that most stu
dents with families do live on campus.
There are more than 1,700 single and married stu
dents living in Escondido Village this academic year,
according to Judy Eroe, an office assistant at Housing
Management.
Approximately 850 are single students and close to
900 are married, some with families, Eroe said. Data
on the total number of students with families was not
available.
Graduate student housing in Escondido includes a
total of 1,200 apartments that house 3,500 people, ap
proximately 25 percent of them children, Polhemus
said. The three high-rise complexes, McFarland,
Hulme and Blackwelder, house approximately 450
single students, Eroe said.

This means approximately 400 single students are
occupying married-couple high-rise and low-rise family
apartments, Eroe said. These figures, however, are
still estimates.
Speculation about reasons for this decline cover a
series of economic and social possibilities, from the
high cost of living to the high value of the dollar to the
postponement of married and family life in today's soci
ety.
The high cost of living in the Stanford and Palo Alto
area may have driven potential students to universities
with lower living expenses. At Escondido Village, a
two-bedroom unit costs $527 a month, and a three
bedroom unit costs $615 a month. Both include utilities
and maintenance.
But Polhemus said she doesn't think that "people are
moving off campus to save money," adding that rent in
the surrounding area is even more expensive than on
campus housing.
The Graduate Studies and Research Office, also
quite conscious of the high cost of living in this area,
has substantially increased the amount of fellowship,
student assistantship or University job money it offers ,
to graduate students, according to Karlene Dickey, as
sociate dean of graduate studies.
The amount of fellowship money currently given to
each fellowship recipient, regardless of marital status,
