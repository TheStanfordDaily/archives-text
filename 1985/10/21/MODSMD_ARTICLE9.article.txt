# Can a Computer Declare War?

### ERIC HEALY 
"You've got this satellite out there in
space, and as soon as it thinks it sees
something, the missiles go off. That's
declaring war," said Clifford Johnson, ex
plaining a potential result of having
peacetime launch-on-warning capabilities
(LOWC) in the United States' nuclear
defense plan.
Johnson, a computer expert at Informa
tion Technology Services, is currently
waiting for a decision on his lawsuit
Qohnson vs. Weinberger) challenging the
constitutionality of peacetime LOWC.
"The essential thing is, 'can a computer
declare war?' " asked Johnson.
The Constitution of the United States
(Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11) stipulates
that "The Congress shall have power . . .
to declare war" and that "The President
shall be Commander in Chief" of the
armed forces (Article 11, Section 8, Clause
11). Johnson believes that peacetime
LOWC violates these constitutional con
straints.
Because the power to launch nuclear
missiles, which is tantamount to a declara
tion of war, is essentially delegated to a
computer-operated detection system in
LOWC, the response time to a nuclear
threat, real or imaginary, is too short to

accommodate any human participation, in
cluding a presidential or congressional
alert, according to Johnson.

In a recent article published in the San
Francisco Barrister Club legal magazine,
Johnson contends that the use of LOWC

"substantially surrenders both the power
of Congress to declare war and the ability
of the president to command the armed
forces, and launch-on-warning capability
is therefore doubly repugnant to the Con
stitution. "
Johnson considers the "greatest dan
ger" of LOWC to be the possibility of an
erroneous detection triggering a nuclear
strike that is not retaliatory. In the Bar
rister article, he cites "Recent False
Alerts from the National Missile Attack
Warning System," written in 1980 by
Sens. Gary Hart and Barry Goldwater:
"In 1979 . . . there were 78 missile dis
play conferences called to evaluate detec
tions that were possibly threatening to the
North American continent."
Johnson also tells of an incident that
occurred in June 1980: "The Presidential
plane was readied, the Pacific Command
Post took off, a hundred nuclear bomber
crews scrambled to start their engines
and nuclear missiles were readied for
launch because a single 46-cent computer
chip occasionally generated the digit '2' in
stead of 'o.' "
"It's not going to save the world in it
self, but I hope it will set a guiding princi
ple," Johnson said, referring to his law
suit. "It is the first screw in the arma
ments game. After this screw is undone,
maybe another can be undone."
