JURISPRUDENCE AND SOCIAL POLICY
A LAW AND SOCIETY PROGRAM AT UC BERKELEY
A multidisciplinary program in Jurisprudence and Social Policy
leading to M.A. and Ph.D. degrees is established in the School of
Law (Boalt Hall), University of California, Berkeley.
The program is designed to encourage the study of law as a social
institution and to meet the needs of (a) students who wish to pursue
graduate studies of law and legal institutions from the standpoint of
one or more disciplines, e.g. history, philosophy, economics,
sociology, political science; (b) students who plan careers in policy
analysis and applied research on law-related issues, e.g. in such
fields as criminal justice, urban planning, and environmental pro
tection; (c) students interested in teaching law as a phase of under
graduate liberal education; and (d) students preparing for law
teaching and other legal careers who feel they will benefit from a
multidisciplinary program. Prior legal training is not a prerequisite
for admission to the program.
The faculty is drawn from a variety of disciplines, including
economics, sociology, philosophy, history, and political science, as
well as law. In this way the knowledge and perspectives of the
humanities and social sciences can be brought to bear on the
teaching, practice, and analysis of law.
A major emphasis of the new program is the integration of broad
intellectual perspectives wih more specific policy studies. Hence
the title "Jurisprudence and Social Policy." Through this graduate
program the School of Law hopes to strengthen its contribution to
the advancement of law-related scholarship and the education of
future leaders of American institutions.
All students must b'e admitted to the Graduate Division of the Uni
versity. Application forms, financial aid information, and a detailed
1 program statement may be obained by writing to: The Graduate
Secretary, Program in Jurisprudence and Social Policy, School of
Law, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.
The deadline for applications for university fellowships is December
15, 1985. The deadline for applications for other forms of financial
assistance and for admission to the program is February 1, 1986.
