# Violence Only Way To Change Apartheid
## 
### JOYA WESLEY Senior staff writer 
Violence is the only way to achieve change in
South Africa, the chaplain of Stanford Medical
School said in a speech here yesterday.
Dr. Ernie Young, who is also associate dean of
Memorial Church, said he reached this conclu
sion only recently, despite the fact that it goes
directly against both his commitment to Christi
anity and his long-term advocacy of non-violent
protest.
Regretfully, I have come to the conclusion
that continued violence alone will bring about
change in South Africa," Young said in an ad
dress at the Bechtel International Center.
He said the inability of nonviolence to
succeed in the past traces to the ruling white
government's consistent suppression of black
leaders committed to nonviolence.
"(The Pretoria government) has effectively
silenced the non-violent voice in South Africa,"
he said.
Young said he left South Africa 12 years ago
when he found he was to be "banned." Banning
is an action that confines a person to a specific
area, prohibits meetings with more than one per

son at a time and prohibits the use of printing
devices. Because these restrictions would have
rendered him useless in the fight against apart
heid, he left the country, he said.
Young said he blames much of the past year's
escalation of violent protest on the government.
"Violence in South Africa is actually a form of
self-defense against the violent nature of the
system," he said.
Young identifies the first act of violence as the
removal of "Coloreds," or people of mixed race,
from the voters' roll. This action came after the
end of World War II in which many people classi
fied as Coloreds by the South African govern
ment had fought on the side of the Allies.
Though unconstitutional, this action was put
into effect despite a Supreme Court denunciation
through the creation of a higher court, the High
Court of Parliament.
"That's violent," Young said, "to strip people
of their voting rights unconstitutionally."
Other acts of violence include the homeland
system, migrant worker laws, influx control laws
and pass laws, he said.
Young also said the nonviolent protest move
ment is hampered by the need for the organiza
tion, discipline and training of its members. The
preparation for such a movement is impossible

because the government prohibits any meeting
except funerals and religious services, he said.
Economic tension within the country will lead
to the earlier demise of apartheid, Young said.
He said he feels nonviolent action in the form of
sanctions and boycotts is effective from the
outside, though it is useless internally.
Young added that he firmly believes in divest
ment and would like to see Stanford divest of its
South Africa-related stock. He said most black
leaders within South Africa favor divestment,
though few say so because it is considered an act
of treason and is punishable by death.
Since he left South Africa for the United
States, Young says he has become much more
optimistic about the destruction of apartheid.
"When I left 12 years ago, I honestly didn't
believe the system would change until the year
2000," he said. Now, he said he believes it will
change within the next two years.
Since violence has been prominent in the
country for the past 40 years, Young says he
feels violence will escalate and continue even
after the white minority government has been
toppled.
"The problem with violence is that it begets
violence," he said. "I foresee decades of vio
lence and counter-violence ahead."

Saying that the government has "effectively silenced the non
violent voice in South Africa," South African-born Dr. Ernie
Young concludes that continued violence is the only way to
change apartheid.
