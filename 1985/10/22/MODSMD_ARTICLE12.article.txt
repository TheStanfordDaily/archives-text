Farber retires
Dr. Paul Jacobs has been named
acting chairman of the School of
Medicine's Department of Derma
tology, succeeding current chair
man Dr. Eugene Farber, who is
retiring after 35 years at the post.
Jacobs, professor of clinical der
matology, has served on the faculty
since 1970 after a number of years
of practice in military medicine and
as a member of the faculty of
Georgetown Medical School. He is
a graduate of the Stritch School of
Medicine and Loyola University in
Chicago.
The appointment was announced
by Medical School Dean David
Korn. Korn stated that he had

granted Farber's request for a sab
batical leave for the remainder of
the school year, with his retirement
to be effective Sept. 1, 1986.
"Dr. Farber has informed me
that the exigencies of his health
necessitate his relinquishing his
University and hospital positions
and duties," said Korn. "We are
grateful for his many contributions
to the University, and wish him well
in his retirement."
Farber recently told the Univer
sity News Service that the need to
retire from his post at Stanford was
also influenced by the time needed
to defend himself against charges
filed in January 1985 by a former
female patient who visited him at
the University's dermatology clinic.

The patient claimed Farber had
sexually harassed her.
Farber pleaded innocent in Palo
Alto Municipal Court in January
1985. No hearings have occurred to
date.
Farber's attorney, Harry
Bremond, said, "We are certain
that he will be vindicated; the
charges are entirely without foun
dation. We believe the University's
internal proceedings would also
have exonerated our client."
A University investigation was
begun in January 1985, but was
delayed for months while first-hand
testimony was not available to the
University. The investigation was
governed by faculty disciplinary

procedures, which require it to
remain confidential.
Korn stated that the proceedings
were not completed and have been
made moot since Farber no longer
has any institutional duties.
Joining the Stanford faculty from
the Mayo Clinic in 1948, Farber was
appointed dermatology chairman in
1959 when the School of Medicine
was moved from San Francisco to
the campus.
Among Farber's contributions
are the training of more than 200
specialists in dermatology, the de
velopment of the nation's first
Psoriasis Day Care Center and re
search to obtain basic knowledge
about the biology of the skin.

An expert in criminal procedure,
she was appointed by former Presi
