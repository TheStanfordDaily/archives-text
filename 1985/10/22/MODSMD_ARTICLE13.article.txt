## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Ladies' Nights Offend 
### 
Last week, the California state Supreme Court
overturned both the trial court and the state Court
of Appeals by banning "ladies' night" discounts and
other gender-based promotions. The decision will
apply to ball parks, movie theatres, roller rinks and
even dry cleaners.
On the surface, one may question the harm of a
"ladies' night." Isn't this discrimination thing going a
bit far? How else are you going to lure the ladies into
a bar if you don't offer them cheap drinks? Everyone
knows girls don't like baseball, so reduced rates of
fer them the opportunity to learn the finer points of
the game. Hey, nobody is hurt. The only goal is in
creased participation and an enlivened social setting.
Nobody is being denied anything so back off, OK.
Unfortunately, there is a great deal wrong with
"ladies' night" promotions. The very name is
demeaning. Both men and women suffer from the
stereotypes encouraged by sex-based preferential
treatment.
Even if "ladies' night" were changed to "women's

night," the stigma remains that women are not
welcome at other times. Perhaps if such sexist pro
motional offers were not available, many women
would feel more comfortable frequenting these es
tablishments.
Discrimination is not simply denying access to a
particular group. It involves granting a privilege or
right to one group and not to others. The opposing
attorneys in this case went so far as to argue that
women need these discounts because they do not
make as much money as men. The solution here is
equal pay â€” not discriminatory promotional dis
counts.
The court avoided extremist positions by ex
empting children and the elderly from this decision
because of real financial need. Any alert merchant
will be able to create suitable promotional offers that
are not based on sex to improve business. The Cali
fornia Supreme Court should be congratulated for
taking a bold step toward ending discrimination and
harmful sexual stereotypes.
