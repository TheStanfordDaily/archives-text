# Protests Treat Symptoms, Not the Disease
## 
### 
At times movements attempting to cure a so
cial illness attack the symptoms of the sickness
rather than the disease itself. In so doing, these
crusades succumb to the disease themselves.
Those pushing for the divestment from corpora
tions doing business in South Africa seek to
remove the lesions of apartheid without con
fronting the deeper, fundamental malaise of in
tolerance. And adamant adherence to opinion
threatens to consume the divestment move
ment.

Intolerance rests on perceived supremacy,
whether it be of morals, race or conviction. All
prejudices emanate from this basic human in
clination. In the case of South Africa, the idea of
black majority rule conflicts with the Afrikaaner
conception of white supremacy. Apartheid could
not exist without bias. Intolerance enforced by
military might holds the black population of South
Africa subservient.
Since last spring, a vocal divestment move
ment has existed on campus. The protesters
equate University investment in South Africa
with student complicity in apartheid. Divest
ment, they contend, will lead to the downfall of
institutionalized segregation and the implemen
tation of democracy and majority rule.
Many Stanford students and faculty, myself in
cluded, do not agree with the supporters of di
vestment. It is not that we condone apartheid,
but that we question the effectiveness and im
pact of divestment. Forceful arguments have
been presented by both sides of the contro
versy. However, the difficult issue remains un
solved.
As man relies on subjective reasoning, he
must never maintain unwavering confidence in
his opinions. Constructive dialogue depends

upon a tolerance for opposing thought and the
acknowledgement of the possible fallacy of one's
own beliefs.
While the true effect of divestment remains
debatable, the protesters ignore the complexity
of opinion and response. Theirs is the only cor
rect course of action. Intolerance of dissent has
come to characterize the movement. The
protesters are convinced of the infallibility of
their beliefs and of the moral superiority of their
stance. Heretics — those who are unsure what
is the best policy to pursue in regard to South
Africa — are branded as morally inferior. As one
demonstrator put it, "For me, this [civil dis
obedience] is a personal statement. I am not re
sponsible for where [University President
Donald Kennedy's] conscience takes him." The
divestment movement is not merely an attempt
to end apartheid, it is also a crusade to purify
spirtually a campus and community.
Belief in the infallibility of viewpoint invariably
leads to hyprocrisy. Many protesters seem blind
to the inconsistencies that gnaw away at their
credibility.
Besides being labeled morally retrograde,
those who don't conform to the ideas and ideals
of the protesters are termed closed-minded (as

was President Kennedy last spring after the
Board of Trustees refused to divest). Yet the
protesters, so quick to call dissenting proposals
and information "lies" and "poison," consider no
ideas but their own. The protesters' claim of
open-mindedness translates to "impartial only if
you agree with us."
The unswerving confidence in position seem
tragically comic at times. Recently, as I stood in
line for lunch, I overheard one supporter of di
vestment say to a friend that he had wanted to

participate in the civil disobediance at Old Union
and be arrested along with the other protesters
but that he "did not get out of chem lab in time."
Is this the type of "dedicated" supporter who
can, with a clear conscience, assume moral su
periority over those who don't favor divestment?
Obviously unquestioning conformists will associ
ate with any movement, regardless of orienta
tion. Yet, such cases highlight the absurdity and
hypocrisy that contrived righteousness
engenders.
Intolerance casts a regretable pall over the di
vestment movement. Perhaps the protesters
are correct in their theories regarding South
Africa and divestment. If they are, then I and
many others will gladly acknowledge their per
serverance and foresight. However, only time
will tell what will happen in South Africa. And, as
the future is hidden from us, we should, whether
we be for or against divestment, retain a linger
ing doubt about the appropriateness of our ac
tions.
With an unbending belief in the superiority of
their viewpoint and their moral integrity, the
protesters run the very serious risk of per
petuating the intolerance upon which systems
such as apartheid are based.

As we confront the problem of apartheid, let
us also attack the causal factor of South African
segregation. The protesters have demonstrated
not that their viewpoint is infallible, but rather
how easily intolerance develops and spreads.
The supporters of divestment, in attacking
apartheid, leave the human inclinations which
lead to the impoverishment of spirit unscathed.

At times movements attempting to cure a so
cial illness attack the symptoms of the sickness
rather than the disease itself. In so doing, these
crusades succumb to the disease themselves.
Those pushing for the divestment from corpora
tions doing business in South Africa seek to
remove the lesions of apartheid without con
fronting the deeper, fundamental malaise of in
tolerance. And adamant adherence to opinion
threatens to consume the divestment move
ment.

Intolerance rests on perceived supremacy,
whether it be of morals, race or conviction. All
prejudices emanate from this basic human in
clination. In the case of South Africa, the idea of
black majority rule conflicts with the Afrikaaner
conception of white supremacy. Apartheid could
not exist without bias. Intolerance enforced by
military might holds the black population of South
Africa subservient.
Since last spring, a vocal divestment move
ment has existed on campus. The protesters
equate University investment in South Africa
with student complicity in apartheid. Divest
ment, they contend, will lead to the downfall of
institutionalized segregation and the implemen
tation of democracy and majority rule.
Many Stanford students and faculty, myself in
cluded, do not agree with the supporters of di
vestment. It is not that we condone apartheid,
but that we question the effectiveness and im
pact of divestment. Forceful arguments have
been presented by both sides of the contro
versy. However, the difficult issue remains un
solved.
As man relies on subjective reasoning, he
must never maintain unwavering confidence in
his opinions. Constructive dialogue depends

upon a tolerance for opposing thought and the
acknowledgement of the possible fallacy of one's
own beliefs.
While the true effect of divestment remains
debatable, the protesters ignore the complexity
of opinion and response. Theirs is the only cor
rect course of action. Intolerance of dissent has
come to characterize the movement. The
protesters are convinced of the infallibility of
their beliefs and of the moral superiority of their
stance. Heretics — those who are unsure what
is the best policy to pursue in regard to South
Africa — are branded as morally inferior. As one
demonstrator put it, "For me, this [civil dis
obedience] is a personal statement. I am not re
sponsible for where [University President
Donald Kennedy's] conscience takes him." The
divestment movement is not merely an attempt
to end apartheid, it is also a crusade to purify
spirtually a campus and community.
Belief in the infallibility of viewpoint invariably
leads to hyprocrisy. Many protesters seem blind
to the inconsistencies that gnaw away at their
credibility.
Besides being labeled morally retrograde,
those who don't conform to the ideas and ideals
of the protesters are termed closed-minded (as

was President Kennedy last spring after the
Board of Trustees refused to divest). Yet the
protesters, so quick to call dissenting proposals
and information "lies" and "poison," consider no
ideas but their own. The protesters' claim of
open-mindedness translates to "impartial only if
you agree with us."
The unswerving confidence in position seem
tragically comic at times. Recently, as I stood in
line for lunch, I overheard one supporter of di
vestment say to a friend that he had wanted to

participate in the civil disobediance at Old Union
and be arrested along with the other protesters
but that he "did not get out of chem lab in time."
