## Union Worker Fired Unjustly 
### 
We feel that your article on the
firing of a United Stanford Workers
union member for allegedly van
dalizing tires was biased and
omitted important facts.
Victor Hill is a shipper-receiver
at Stores on campus who has
worked at the University for nine
years. His manager, Hector Allen,
found his tires flattened and

VIEWPOINT

accused Victor of doing it. The
police came and investigated, and
refused to arrest Victor because
there was no evidence to support
the manager's claim, and because
the only eyewitness, a temporary
clerical employee, said that Victor
did not flatten the tires.
In spite of this, management
fired both Victor and the witness.
Within hours, word of this unjust
firing spread through the union, and
workers and students held a
protest rally. Management then ter
minated another temporary worker
who attended the rally on his own
lunch time.
There are other facts which were
also omitted from the Daily article.
Stores workers are required to
wear steel-safety shoes. Prior to
the tire incident, Victor had a
dispute with his manager over Vic
tor's being required to wear defec
tive safety shoes that hurt his feet
badly, a claim backed up by a note
from his doctor. Hector Allen
refused to provide him with the
proper shoes and suspended him
for refusing to wear the defective

ones. In support of Victor, his co
workers all refused to wear their
required safety shoes, and this act
of solidarity forced management to
back down and provide Victor with
safe and comfortable shoes.
Manager Hector Allen is
notorious among union workers at
Stores because of his unfair treat
ment of workers there. Workers
feel that Victor's dispute with Hec
tor Allen played a role in Allen's ac
cusation. The manager of Em
ployee Relations, Felix Bar
tholemy, who made the actual deci
sion to fire Victor and the witness,
is also notorious among workers

These tactics will
not work.

because of his unjust treatment of
workers — minority workers in
particular.
Finally, it should be clear to all
that the administration is stepping
up its attempt to intimidate union
members. A manager at the Press
recently threatened to discipline a
worker for talking to a union repre
sentative. These and other tactics
are designed to rattle and scare
workers in the final week of
negotiations. These tactics will not
work. They only make us more de
termined to see a just contract.
