# Union Postpones Strike
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
United Stanford Workers union (USW)
yesterday postponed its strike deadline
until Oct 31, after saying last week it
would do so only if real progress were
made toward a new contract.
University and union leaders also
decided to return to the language in the
1979 contract regarding the criteria for
re-hiring laid-off employees.
The 1979 agreement required that laid
off employees show "relatively" equal skill
and ability before being hired for a job
other than the one previously held, said
Mary Ann Tenuto, USW's chief
negotiator.
The lay-off issue "is the first thing of

anv importance that we have been able to
agree upon," said Tenuto, but she warned
that the job security issue is an entirely
different problem and remains un
resolved.
The union decided over the weekend to
delay the deadline "when the federal
mediator (Maggie Jacobson) said the Uni
versity was agreeable to mediation," said
Tenuto.
At the Oct. 15 strike vote, USW mem
bership gave the bargaining team the
power to continue negotiating for five
days after the original strike deadline of
Oct. 25.
"We are going to use that authority
very sparingly," Tenuto said at that time.
The two sides met yesterday with
Jacobson, at which time the University
presented a "very tiny counterproposal,"

including a new wage increase proposal,
Tenuto said.
The new proposal, which is one half of
one percent higher than the previous of
fer, would mean increases of 4 percent in
the first year, 3 percent in the second
year and 3 percent in the final year of the
proposed contract, said Priscilla Wheeler,
chief negotiator and staff counsel for the
University.
There would also be a cost of living ad
justment made in the third year if inflation
rises faster than expected, she added.
Union leaders said they were not im
pressed with the University's latest offer.
"They made very little economic move
ment," said Tenuto.
But the University warned for the
second time in these negotiations
that it was nearing its last wage in
crease proposal.
"We're indeed getting close to
where we think [the final wage pro
posal] should be," Wheeler said.
Away from the bargaining table,
Wheeler criticized the union for
threatening to strike at the Stanford

Hospital on Nov. 2 at 12:01 a.m.
The fact that the union is "using
patients as hostages is troubling,"
Wheeler said. "It's unfortunate that
they would stoop to that sort of
thing."
But Tenuto said the University's
criticism was a "really stupid thing
for them to say." She denied the
University's claim that the union
does not represent anyone at the
hospital.
"As long as our people perform

services in that facility, they have
the right to strike," Tenuto said.
In addition to the job security
problem, both sides remain far
apart on the union's proposed in
creases in pension and medical
benefits.
Wheeler said the union should not
"expect [the University] always to
respond to their demands."
Currently, the University plans
no changes for either the pension or
medical benefits, she said. "An em

ployer has to be responsible" for
the offers it makes, Wheeler added.
Both sides agreed to Jacobson's
suggestion that the two bargaining
teams meet again today.
