Give Meaning to
'Public Service'
We are writing as alumnae to
show our support for the students,
staff and faculty who are fighting so
hard against Stanford's unaccepta
ble investment policy here and
against apartheid in South Africa.
We stand beside you. We also
stand by the demands of students
that the University take fair and
immediate steps to insure that
appropriate action is taken in con
junction with the case of Stanford
senior Robby Perkins. We support
what seems to be the University's
action to seek justice in that case
with the recent appointment of
Law Prof. John Kaplan to investi
gate the matter.
Much has been said at Stanford
about public service. We are com
mitted to working to get more
students involved in public sector
work. We also want to express our
own personal opinion that public
service entails treating both the
symptoms of the problem
(poverty, hunger and homeless
ness, etc.) and the causes of those
problems (racism, sexism and
unjust economic inequality). We
applaud people who work both with
the symptoms and with the causes.
The efforts of the symptom-

oriented public servants would be
ineffectual without the efforts of
the cause-oriented public servants
and vice-versa. We urge all mem
bers of the Stanford community to
fight against social injustice on
whatever level they feel comforta
ble. We should not allow "public
service" to become an empty
phrase.
Finally, we encourage the Uni
versity administration to do the
following:
• Reconsider its policy on invest
ments in South Africa. We urge
total and immediate divestment of
Stanford's investments in compan
ies doing business in South Africa.
• Retract the pamphlet "Stanford
and South Africa," which is histori
cally incorrect and biased in favor
of white minority rule in South
Africa as it makes almost no men
tion of the black liberation move
ment in South Africa. A new
pamphlet should be printed which
is produced in conjunction with
Stanford's ample supply of
specialists in African affairs and
Stanford's black community. The
new pamphlet should be dis
tributed to all students (as was the
current one). The University
should also retract the first
pamphlet as we feel that it is not in
Stanford's best interest to be asso
ciated with a misleading and his-

incorrect document.
• Clarify the University policy on
student protest. Will the Funda
mental Standard be applied stu
dents protesting the issues of
social injustice? Will the University
continue to involve the Santa Clara
County sheriff's office in Stanford
arrests?

How About It,
'Mr. Kennedy?'
Recently, University President -
Donald Kennedy spoke to the
freshman class and told them to
question authority. This is a very
noble thought, Mr. Kennedy. If
you really believe this, I must ask:
• Why do members of the Stanford
community get arrested and physi
cally abused by the police?
• Why are students now threat
ened with campus judicial charges
should they participate in sit-ins in
the future? Past participation may
also be considered in penalties as
well. This comes from your dean
of Student Affairs, James Lyons.
• Why does the University's
negotiating team refuse to discuss
the important issues of the con-

tract with United Stanford
Workers, particularly paragraph
94?
• The Coffee House is very impor
tant to the students of Stanford.
Why was the decision to turn it
over to Saga Corp. made before
the vast majority of students and
faculty were back from summer
break?
• Why did the administration hold
untimely meetings concerning the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Li
brary? Surely you were not afraid
someone may actually have some
legitimate questions that may have
been contrary to administration
opinion.
In light of these actions, your
statements to the freshman class
are nothing but a sham. These
actions show those in charge of
this University to be arrogant and
only concerned with special inter
ests. Stop acting so pious and
almighty Mr. Kennedy, get off
your ivory tower and come see
what the real world is like. I send
this letter in the spirit of the First
Amendment and to the ideal that
Mr. Kennedy holds so dear, ques
tioning authority. I wonder how
effective this is, Mr. Kennedy,
when these questions fall on deaf
ears. How about it, freshman?

problems (racism, sexism and
unjust economic inequality). We
applaud people who work both with
the symptoms and with the causes.
The efforts of the symptom-

oriented public servants would be
ineffectual without the efforts of
the cause-oriented public servants
and vice-versa. We urge all mem
bers of the Stanford community to
fight against social injustice on
whatever level they feel comforta
ble. We should not allow "public
service" to become an empty
phrase.
Finally, we encourage the Uni
versity administration to do the
following:
• Reconsider its policy on invest
ments in South Africa. We urge
total and immediate divestment of
Stanford's investments in compan
ies doing business in South Africa.
• Retract the pamphlet "Stanford
and South Africa," which is histori
cally incorrect and biased in favor
of white minority rule in South
Africa as it makes almost no men
tion of the black liberation move
ment in South Africa. A new
pamphlet should be printed which
is produced in conjunction with
Stanford's ample supply of
specialists in African affairs and
Stanford's black community. The
new pamphlet should be dis
tributed to all students (as was the
current one). The University
should also retract the first
pamphlet as we feel that it is not in
Stanford's best interest to be asso
ciated with a misleading and his-

incorrect document.
• Clarify the University policy on
student protest. Will the Funda
mental Standard be applied stu
dents protesting the issues of
social injustice? Will the University
continue to involve the Santa Clara
County sheriff's office in Stanford
arrests?

How About It,
'Mr. Kennedy?'
Recently, University President -
Donald Kennedy spoke to the
freshman class and told them to
question authority. This is a very
noble thought, Mr. Kennedy. If
you really believe this, I must ask:
• Why do members of the Stanford
community get arrested and physi
cally abused by the police?
• Why are students now threat
ened with campus judicial charges
should they participate in sit-ins in
the future? Past participation may
also be considered in penalties as
well. This comes from your dean
of Student Affairs, James Lyons.
• Why does the University's
negotiating team refuse to discuss
the important issues of the con-

tract with United Stanford
Workers, particularly paragraph
94?
• The Coffee House is very impor
tant to the students of Stanford.
Why was the decision to turn it
over to Saga Corp. made before
the vast majority of students and
faculty were back from summer
break?
• Why did the administration hold
untimely meetings concerning the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Li
brary? Surely you were not afraid
someone may actually have some
legitimate questions that may have
been contrary to administration
opinion.
In light of these actions, your
statements to the freshman class
are nothing but a sham. These
actions show those in charge of
this University to be arrogant and
only concerned with special inter
ests. Stop acting so pious and
almighty Mr. Kennedy, get off
your ivory tower and come see
what the real world is like. I send
this letter in the spirit of the First
Amendment and to the ideal that
Mr. Kennedy holds so dear, ques
tioning authority. I wonder how
effective this is, Mr. Kennedy,
when these questions fall on deaf
ears. How about it, freshman?
