## The 						Danger of Eating Veggies in the Louvre 
### ANDREW McCLUNG 
I did some traveling in Europe last summer, and
spent a day wandering around the Louvre. While
doing so, I noticed that the women depicted in the
paintings were without exception possessed of incredi
bly tiny nipples. Did women typically have smaller
nipples back in the the 17th century? Or did the artists
select only models who were so endowed? Or, more in
sidiously, were tiny nipples simply a contemporary aes
thetic fad that the artists foisted off on the public,
regardless of their models' anatomical characteristics?
- John Mason
Now, John, you must imagine that art professors
the world over would cringe at having their
response to such a question put into print, but I did
find that Prof. Dwight Miller of our very own Art
Department would courageously offer some
guarded speculations.
It is vital that everyone understand that Miller, in
his zeal to relieve our collective curiosity, intends to
offend absolutely no one. In fact, he would go so far
as to utterly refute your opinion that all the women
portrayed in paint had tiny nipples.
He said that he is aware of many paintings in
which the size of the womens' nipples is exagger
ated to an amazing degree.
Michelangelo, in particular, is an artist of some
repute who occasionally painted buxom women as
he saw them, free of any restrictions on their nipple
size.
This may not be true for every artist, however.
Some portrayed aristocratic women in an
"idealized" fashion, with their nipples reduced to
nearly microscopic dimensions, while they depicted
peasant women and nursemaids as having unusually
large nipples.
What is it in asparagus that makes my urine smell
funny? -Food Service victim
As you probably already know, that's methane
thiol.
This news from the desk of Dr. Ted Shortliffe,
who is the most unbelievably selfless and conscien
tious physician/medical researcher of whom one
could conceive.
But with utmost modesty, of course, he attri
butes his success to Chairman of Medicine Dr. Rex
Jamison, who referred him to an article in Nature
magazine.

The article, published in 1956, states that, in a
random sample of 115 persons, 40 percent ex
creted methanethiol after eating asparagus and the
rest did not.
The authors concluded that "the excretor charac
ter is controlled by a single, autosomal, dominant
gene."

According to Shortliffe, this gene has to do
with the production of aspariginase, the enzyme that
controls the metabolism of asparigine.
Asparigine, found naturally in asparagus, may be
converted to methanethiol depending on the manner
in which it is metabolized.
Methanethiol apparently has a high enough vapor
pressure at 37 degrees Celsius to produce the enor
mously aromatic cloud that has alarmed you. But
you needn't be worried, nor should you blame poor
old Food Service, since it's the asparagus that's cul
pable.
Asparagus also contains a diuretic, so it not only
makes your urine smell odd, but it makes you race
to the lavatory sooner than you might have planned.
Whatever you do, don't get despondent (unless
you really love asparagus and really hate that smell),
since 40 percent of all humans are in the same boat,
and many notice the effect after eating only a couple
of stalks of what is certainly every child's favorite
vegetable.
