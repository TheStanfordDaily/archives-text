## MOMIX 
### ALLISON HARTWELL Editorial staff 
It is amazing that five young performers can emit the
energy and intensity of what seems more appropriate
for a thousand, all within a span of a few hours. Except,
of course, if it's Momix.
Momix members Danny Ezralow, Jamey Hampton,
Ashley Roland, Morleigh Steinberg and guest artist
Alan Boeding spend much of their time together, on
and off the stage. According to Ezralow, there is al
ways tension within the group, but that tension is of
tentimes creative. The group always "sticks to
gether, " he added.
This comraderie and cohesiveness was evidenced

throughout their perfor
mance Friday night in a
packed Memorial
Auditorium. This is an abso
lute necessity for a five
member ensemble that per
forms works of balance,
symmetry and synchro
nicity.
Ezralow hedged away
ffdm Categorizing a Momix
performance. "It's not
dance, vocal or visual," he
said. "It is the spectrum of
life."
Both Ezralow and Stein
berg concurred that Momix
is a "collaborative" en
semble, with creativity and
inspiration derived from
members of the group in
stead of an outside director.

Moses Pendleton, founder of
Momix and its predecessor, Pilobolus, is "more like a
father than an artistic director," Steinberg said.
Instead of following rigid choreography, Momix often
relies on "set improvs." Members of the group must be
at a certain place at a certain time, but can get there
any way they choose.
Ezralow described Momix's brand of dance as
"physical impulse." For Momix, non-movement is as
vital as movement. Lying still on the ground is as pow
erful, if not more powerful, than active motion, Ez
ralow said.
The first piece of the evening, "Woomen," exhibited
one of the many elements of Momix's work: the superb

use of shadowry. Ezralow and Hampton, adorned in
white tights and bathing caps to maintain clarity of line,
created shadow figures who beat each other, grabbed
each other and ate each other. The magic of lighting
permitted such effects without Ezralow and Hampton
ever actually touching one another.
The first work featured a concept for which Momix is
well-known: the tossing back and forth of what can only
be described as an invisible ball of energy. The
"energy" ran entirely through one dancer's body,
producing various contortions in him, and was
"passed" to another dancer. This was all done to the
backdrop of gospel music.
In the end segment of "Woomen," Ezralow and
Hampton utilized two sticks in ways only Momix would
think of: as fire starters (with the two mens' toes ser-

ving as the fire), roasting
skewers, TV antennae,
feelers, peashooters,
swords, tennis rackets, golf
clubs, a bow and arrow, a
valve to inflate a human bal
loon, fishing rods and dumb
bells.
Much of their work was
filled with subtle humor that
spread contageously through
the audience. But the humor
was not overt slapstick; it
required members of the au
dience to consider what they
were laughing at.
"Mr. Seawater's Pool"
also relied on shadow. The
group used two screens in
stead of one, forming images
of limbs without bodies,
bodies without limbs, and

bodies with limbs of other
bodies. When asked how the group was able to perfect
shadow images without really seeing what they were
forming, Steinberg remarked that "the video projector
becomes a good friend."
The evening's most lovely piece, "Skiva," was a
striking display of sensuality. Steinberg and Ezralow
first appeared to do the impossible — rock back and
forth in a kneeling position without tipping over. When
the lights were raised, one could see they were on
skis. The pure fluidity of their movements was star
tling — they emitted wave after wave, indeed moving
as if in water, with the motioil running through to their
fingertips.

That both appeared nude from the waist up and wore
black ski pants accentuated the fact that their bases —
their skis and legs — were relatively immobile, in bold
contrast to their emotive upper bodies.
In this work, both Ezralow and Steinberg were at
times almost parallel with their skis, threatening to
topple over while defying gravity.
After the performance, Steinberg said she can't do
the piece every performance because the boots are too
painful. Steinberg, who Friday was presented with a
cake on stage in honor of her 21st birthday, said she
hopes to continue dancing "as long as my body holds
out."

"Fever" opened with what
looked like sine waves of
light moving across the cur
tain, produced by, it was
soon revealed, a long cord of
material being whipped. The
cord was attached to Ash
ley Roland, who was cov
ered by a womb-like "sack"
connected to the "umbilical
cord." The piece was
Roland's alone, and gave her
the opportunity to exhibit
her gymnastic background as
well as her dance ability.
Roland performed as a gifted
athlete and dancer, yet
lacked the communication
with the audience found in
the other members of the
group.
Admittedly, the meaning
of some of Momix's works

was ambiguous. But Ezralow maintains that ambiguity
is a positive thing: "You can think what you think."
This did not, however, preclude the presence of intel
lectuality. Ezralow took the example of "Hoover Hal
lucinations," which opened with Steinberg dressed in
fishnet stockings, smoking a cigarette, and sitting in an
alluring position, her back to the audience. Ezralow en
tered the stage, rolling from a rug, and danced madly
to get Steinberg's attention. His efforts were to know
avail; Steinberg ignored him and Ezralow rolled away,
again in his rug.
To Ezralow, a man dancing wildly for a woman and
getting no results is simple intellectualism, yet it re
quires the audience to follow instincts as to his or her
own interpretation.
Guest artist Alan Boeding was one of the highlights

of the show with his performance of "Circle Walker."
Boeding, who holds a degree in sculpture from the Uni
versity of South Dakota, has created a hollow spherical
sculpture that is his "medium" of dance. The structure
is made of sturdy, three-inch-wide metal that can sup
port his weight in various acrobatic moves.
The structure enables him to seemingly float in the
air, utilizing centrifugal force, climbing in and out of the
metal bands with amazing dexterity. And when the
structure was still, Boeding appeared to symbolize the
man and the world, and the delicate balance between
them. To Boeding, "kinetic sculpture creates kinetic
dance."

| What Boeding lacked in
dance technique was easily
made up in the gravity
defying movements. None
theless, if Boeding would
have extended his entire
body to its limit, com
plementing his acrobatics, a
much more continuous and
fluid effect would have been
attained.
Boeding began taking
dance and choreography
classes at Indiana Univer
sity, where he was working
on his master's degree. He
was performing with the
Windfall Modern Dance Com
pany, and Moses Pendleton
spotted him. Four days
later, Boeding was perform
ing in Berkeley with Momix.
Many times in his piece,

Boeding seemed to approach the edge of the stage, a
little too close for comfort. Although he has never been
injured, Boeding admitted he has come close once. "I
know every inch of the stage (I perform on)," he said.
Of great merit to the ensemble is that its members
accomplish the most unusual and amazing effects with
out the aid of elaborate scenery or costumes, only
lighting and their own bodies. This is thanks to both
Kevin Dreyer, the group's technical director, and to
the group itself, for the utilization of his direction.
Momix chose to end with an encore highlighting what
they do best: improvisation. Each dancer entered the
stage and did his or her "own thing" to a recording of
the Talking Heads' "Burning Down the House." This
was only appropriate. The creativity and enthusiasm of
Momix was enough to bring the house down.
