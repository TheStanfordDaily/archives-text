# 'Anything for a Laugh' Offers Hearty Hilarity
## 
### DAVID OVENS 
Saturday night marked the
world premiere of a fresh, vibrant
musical comedy, "Anything for a
Laugh." A lively adaptation of
Carlo Goldoni's "The Liar," the
play features original composi
tions of ragtime and jazz music
(by Jay Seagrave) and fine acting
by the local ensemble
Theatre Works.
The work is really a play within
a play, performed by a clown
troupe of the 19205. Although it is
not slapstick, it opens with some
typical clown antics; these clowns
are actors who can portray emo
tions in an enjoyable and realistic
way through dialogue and song.
The adaptation by Robert Kel
ley and Steven Young is refresh
ing and quite appropriate to the
commedia dell'arte style, a genre
of comic Italian plays of the 16th
century. "Anything for a Laugh,"
Kelley's third successful adapta
tion of a Goldoni play, places the

performers in a 20th century
equivalent of a commedia troupe
— a group of actor-clowns
touring in 1924. The audience it
self is placed inside the clowns'
tent and becomes a part of the
production — and a part of the
spectacle.
Much of the production staff
has ties to Stanford. Kelley, the
ensemble's director who founded
Theatre Works in 1970, is a Stan
ford graduate. Young holds a doc
torate in English literature from
Stanford and Susan Cashion,
choreographer of the production,
is the coordinator of the Univer
sity's dance division.
The play centers around the
main character, Lelio, performed
by Steve Walton. With his policy
of "anything for a laugh" (anything
to add some spice and romance to
life), Lelio provides the entertain
ment and the conflict of the pro
duction. Women bring out his
most fantastic lies, as demon
strated in his advances to two
sisters, Rosaura and Beatrice.

His "embroidering of the truth"
brings him into conflict with
several characters, including the
sisters, the sisters' father, his
mother and Octavio (an acquaint
ance). His lies are outrageous but
seem spontaneous; their con
tradictions are apparent and the
turmoil caused by them is ex
pected.
The acting in this production,
however, is truthful and accurate.
Deserving special notice is the
performance of Paul Roder as Oc
tavio. He shares some delightful
scenes Lelio, including a hilarious
fight with punch-balloons. The
music is boisterous and appropri
ate of "the 1920s — the band in
costume in an antechamber of the
circus tent.
The humor is in the spirit of the
commedia dell'arte with a modern,
more sophisticated flavor. The
choreography is precise and adds
to the humor. This is a well
produced musical comedy that is
entertaining, lively and good fun.


Bedraggled traveling clowns of the 1920s make up the cast of "Anything for a Laugh," a pro
duction by Theatre Works that runs through Nov. 16.
