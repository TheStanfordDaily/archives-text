# Malmsteen Rocks Bay Area With Heavy-Hitting Guitar
## 
### LIZ GOODMAN Staff writer 
If you asked the average rock fan to name a guitar
virtuoso, the answer would probably be Eddie Van
Halen or Randy Rhoads. In the near future, however, a
new name may be added to this response — Yngwie
(pronounced Ingvay) Malmsteen.
In just a few years, the Swedish-born guitarist has
become internationally known for his explosive leads
and creative approach. He appeared in the Bay Area
Saturday night with the band he created and
dominates, Rising Force, as the opening act for
AC/DC.
At the young age of 22, Malmsteen is undisputably a
rare talent. From the aura of confidence he displayed in
an interview after the set, it is obvious that he is well
aware of his impending superstar status.
Malmsteen first gained attention for his work with
the rock bands Alcatrazz and Steeler. His experience
with those bands taught him "what I didn't want when
forming my own band. You learn by making mistakes
because you learn to avoid them."
The musicians that comprise Rising Force are
keyboardist Jens Johansson, drummer Anders
Johanssori, bassist Marcel Jacob and vocalist Jeff Scott
Soto.
Although the set Saturday was a group effort, the
spotlight mainly rested on Malmsteen as he performed

one scorching guitar solo after another. When asked if
the other members of his band ever feel neglected,
Malmsteen replied, "No, I don't think so."
Part of the quality of his solos can attributed to a
classical influence. "I use Beethoven, Bach, Brahms
and Berlioz — they are my main influence. I don't lis
ten to rock 'n' roll at all."
The live show contained the power and energy ne
cessary for a great show. "We place an emphasis on
the musicianship and the musicians themselves. It's
very intense,"Malmsteen said.
This intensity is also evident on the group's albums.
Their latest release, "Marching Out," is a combination
of power and melody carried out in a minor key. "You
can maybe detect a bit of classical as well as soul influ
ence," Malmsteen said.
"Marching Out" is a move away from the
predominantly instrumental approach that character
ized their previous album. "We have a lot more vocals
on the second album, the first one was mainly in
strumentals because the record company wanted it
that way," he added.
Prominent tracks off the new album include the
hard-hitting "I'll See the Light Tonight" as well as the
rock ballad "Don't Let It End."
Now with an album gaining him a considerable fol
lowing, a video receiving MTV airplay and riding in the
midst of a successful tour, the understandably self
confident guitarist is looking toward other venues to
expose his musical talent. "I thinking about writing a
symphony next," he said.
