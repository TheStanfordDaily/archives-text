# Cinematic Magic Fills Francois Truffaut's Finest Films
## 
### DAVID WILLATS 
Everytime you see a film by
Francois Truffaut, you leave the
theater in a state of delighted un
easiness. You are delighted by the
richness of the characterization, yet
uneasy with the ambiguity of his
films. Two of Truffaut's earliest and
most well-known works will be
shown at the New Varsity today
through Thursday.
"The Four Hundred Blows"
depicts the critical time of adoles
cence in a young man's life, that
period dominated by rebellion and
sexual awakening. The film takes
place in Paris in the mid '50s. An
toine Doinel (played by Jean-Pierre
Leaud) is a neglected 13-year-old
living with his indifferent mother
(Claire Maurier) and his good
natured yet ineffectual stepfather
(Albert Remy). He is doing poorly
in school, and one day he cuts
classes with his friend Rene
(Patrick Auffey). They spend the
day in an amusement center, going
on rides and seeing films. That af
ternoon he sees his mother with an
other man.
The next day, in order to explain
his absence to his teacher (Guy

Decomble), he blurts out that his
mother has died. His lie is uncov
ered, however, when his parents
appear at the school. In order to
avoid punishment he spends the
night away from home, alone in the
streets of Paris. The next day his
mother finds him at school and ef
fects a brief reconciliation, but
when his teacher expels him for
plagiarizing a passage from Balzac
(whom he reveres), his troubles
begin anew. This cycle of misun
derstood intentions and false
rewards continues as the boy is
beaten down by a world that neither
he, nor anyone else for that matter,
really understands.
To fully appreciate "The Four
Hundred Blows" it helps to know
some of the ideas that contributed
to the creation of the movie. Made
in 1959, the film was one of the first
and most influential of the French
"new wave."
During the mid '50s, when Truf
faut was a critic for the French film
journal "Cahiers du Cinema," he
and his peers began harshly attack
ing the established filmmaking tech
nique of the time, one which Truf
faut called "literary" cinema. The
standard practice in French

filmmaking was for a screenwriter
to adapt a well-known literary work
to the screen, which the director
would then "set to pictures." This
sort of filmed theater relied mostly
on the script, and made very little
use of cinematic technique.
Although these films were often
grouped under the heading of
"psychological realism," Truffaut
argued that they presented a
simplistic psychology and a dis
torted reality. He accused the
screenwriters of underestimating
the power of film, and of neglecting
its possibilities as an independent
art form with its own language and
history.

Truffaut invented the "auteur"
theory, which promoted those
directors who infused their own
personal style and cinematic im
agination into their films, bringing
them to life on the screen (he
touted Hitchcock as one such direc
tor). According to Truffaut, the
director is the "author" of the film,
and the film should be an extension
of his own view of reality.
In 1959, Truffaut and his fellow
critics initiated the "new wave"
with 24 "first films" by new French
directors, including Truffaut's "The
Four Hundred Blows," Godard's
"Breathless" and Alain Resnais'
"Hiroshima. Mon Amour." These

movies were characterized by ex
citing and experimental cinematic
techniques combined with more
personal and subjectively realistic
interpretations of reality. They
were filmed on location and with
lesser known actors, all of which
contributed to a realism that the au
dience could recognize and identify
with.
The cinematic style of "The Four
Hundred Blows" is loose and open.
With no rigid plot to structure the
film, Truffaut was able to experi
ment with different types of shots
and shot sequences. HeÂ»described
the process as "instinctive." Much
of the film was improvised, and

even the young Leaud (who is per
fectly cast in the role of Antoine)
was encouraged to respond in his
own words. The result is a film of
natural beauty and rhythm.
"The Four Hundred Blows" is
essentially an autobiographical
work. Most of the film is based on
personal experience: Truffaut him
self was neglected by his parents
(he was raised by his grand
mother), and he had several
scrapes with the law (as does An
toine Doinel).
Although these are themes that
could easily lapse into melodrama,
Truffaut is able to avoid the usual
stereotypical interpretations of An

toine's dilemma. One could easily
define the problem as one of
"corrupt society" vs. "innocent
children," but Truffaut manages to
maintain an objective tone through
extremely rich and complex charac
terizations. The film is earnest in its
concern for the plight of Antoine,
yet it remains unsentimental and
open to interpretation. Indeed, the
experience does not belong to An
toine alone, but to all of us.
In "The Four Hundred Blows"
we see Antoine's budding fascina
tion with women and sexuality (for
example, he sits at his mother's
makeup table and steals a picture of
a movie starlet). This theme is
amplified in Truffaut's third film,
"Jules and Jim," made in 1961.
The story begins in Paris, just
before the World War I. Jules
(Oskar Werner) and Jim (Henri
Serre) are both writers and good
friends who spend much of their
time looking for romance, or more
specifically, the ideal woman. One
day their artist friend Albert (Boris
Bassiak) shows them some slides of
the statues he has been studying.
One carving in particular catches
the attention of the two men: It is
the smiling face of a woman, and
they both agree that it is enchant

ing. They go to see this statue in
person, and soon afterwards Jules
meets and falls in love with the
free-spirited Catherine (Jeanne
Moreau), who, naturally, looks like
the face of the statue. When Jim
sees her, he too falls in love, and
the scene is set for tragic conse
quences.
This is arguably the best of Truf
faut's early films. The characteriza
tion is brilliant, especially in the
character of Catherine. Any film
about the "ideal woman" can easily
become trite and degrading (and we
have had many trashy examples of
this lately, such as "Weird Sci
ence" and"The Woman in Red").
But Catherine is one of the most
complex and deeply developed
characters in modern cinema.
Jules' and Jim's devotion to her is
unbounded, reflecting Truffaut's
own fascination and idolatry of
women.
But Truffaut recognizes the
dangers of worshiping this mythic
image of women. The two men are
doomed by their inability to see
Catherine's human side. Catherine,
for her part, contributes to the
tragedy; her quest for freedom in
love becomes more important than
the men who love her.


In Traffaut's film, "The Four Hundred Blows," Antoine (Jean-
Pierre Leaud) shares his problems concerning his mother, step
father and teacher with his friend, Rene (Patrick Auffay). The
film marked the beginning of the French "new wave" in 1959.


Jean-Pierre Leaud is the troubled adolescent Antoine Doinel in
"The Four Hundred Blows."


The lovely Catherine, played by Jeanne Moreau, is the prover
bial "ideal woman" in Truffaut's "Jules and Jim." She playfully
threatens to jump into the Seine River, unwittingly foreshadow
ing her eventual fate.
