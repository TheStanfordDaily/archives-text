## Stanford's Problems Are Getting Bigger 
### 
Who would've thought the San Francisco 49ers
would be 3-4 this season? Who would've thought the
Detroit Tigers would finish a mile-and-a-half behind
Toronto in the American League East? Who would've
thought the Washington Huskies would lose to Oregon
State in Seattle? And who would've thought the Stan
ford offense would score only six points in a game this
season?
Not many people after the Cardinal's first four
games, least of all this corner. The 500-yard-per-game
offense that seemed poised to outscore anyone has
vanished. In its place: the 193-yard lack of an offense.

Quarterback John Paye looked like the the Pitts
burgh Pirates pitching staff Saturday â€” everytime he
threw, he got hit. Hard. Paye spent more time on his
back than Marilyn Chambers. He didn't have a chance
to finish this game healthy, and that he suffered a
separated shoulder didn't come as much of a surprise.
That he was able to last three-and-a-half quarters after
the injury did.
Someone suggested Coach Jack Elway should have
put in reserve quarterback Fred Buckley right away to
preserve Paye, but Fred's too nice a guy to have that
kind of beating wished upon him.
The offensive line, which has had its own injury
problems, still didn't give Paye any time. And as long
as Paye has no time, the Cardinal will have no offense.
"I think it's obvious that John Paye didn't have a
chance to do much in light of our ability to give him
much protection," Elway said. "It became obvious
early that we were being manhandled up front. It's no
secret we have to improve up front." Obviously.

"We've had injuries, but when it comes Saturday, it's
time to play, and we haven't been doing the job," guard
Andy Sinclair said. No excuses. Despite using two
tight ends to help in the blocking for most of the game,
despite keeping a back in to block on passes, despite
using screens and the shovel pass that is fast becoming
the epitome of the Stanford offense, Paye was sacked
four times and watched passes from the ground a
whole lot more.
Two lines from one writer's game notes: From the
first quarter, "Paye getting killed on every pass."

From the second half, "Hoping Paye doesn't get hurt."
Too late.
The line is young and needs game experience more
than anything, but there isn't much time for that. Stan
ford hosts Arizona this Saturday. The Wildcats are the
only undefeated team in the Pacific 10 Conference, and
Elway said they are "at a peak" and the "odds-on favor
ite to represent the P-.c-lO in the Rose Bowl." And
they have a defense that gives up less than a touch-

Stanford quarterback John Paye was sacked four times by the Trojan defense Saturday and was
battered on numerous other occasions. Coach Jack Elway said yesterday that Paye's partially
separated right shoulder will likely keep him sidelined against Arizona this weekend.
