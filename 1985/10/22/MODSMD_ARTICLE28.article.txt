## Stanford's Problems Are Getting Bigger 
### 
Who would've thought the San Francisco 49ers
would be 3-4 this season? Who would've thought the
Detroit Tigers would finish a mile-and-a-half behind
Toronto in the American League East? Who would've
thought the Washington Huskies would lose to Oregon
State in Seattle? And who would've thought the Stan
ford offense would score only six points in a game this
season?
Not many people after the Cardinal's first four
games, least of all this corner. The 500-yard-per-game
offense that seemed poised to outscore anyone has
vanished. In its place: the 193-yard lack of an offense.

Quarterback John Paye looked like the the Pitts
burgh Pirates pitching staff Saturday — everytime he
threw, he got hit. Hard. Paye spent more time on his
back than Marilyn Chambers. He didn't have a chance
to finish this game healthy, and that he suffered a
separated shoulder didn't come as much of a surprise.
That he was able to last three-and-a-half quarters after
the injury did.
Someone suggested Coach Jack Elway should have
put in reserve quarterback Fred Buckley right away to
preserve Paye, but Fred's too nice a guy to have that
kind of beating wished upon him.
The offensive line, which has had its own injury
problems, still didn't give Paye any time. And as long
as Paye has no time, the Cardinal will have no offense.
"I think it's obvious that John Paye didn't have a
chance to do much in light of our ability to give him
much protection," Elway said. "It became obvious
early that we were being manhandled up front. It's no
secret we have to improve up front." Obviously.

"We've had injuries, but when it comes Saturday, it's
time to play, and we haven't been doing the job," guard
Andy Sinclair said. No excuses. Despite using two
tight ends to help in the blocking for most of the game,
despite keeping a back in to block on passes, despite
using screens and the shovel pass that is fast becoming
the epitome of the Stanford offense, Paye was sacked
four times and watched passes from the ground a
whole lot more.
Two lines from one writer's game notes: From the
first quarter, "Paye getting killed on every pass."

From the second half, "Hoping Paye doesn't get hurt."
Too late.
The line is young and needs game experience more
than anything, but there isn't much time for that. Stan
ford hosts Arizona this Saturday. The Wildcats are the
only undefeated team in the Pacific 10 Conference, and
Elway said they are "at a peak" and the "odds-on favor
ite to represent the P-.c-lO in the Rose Bowl." And
they have a defense that gives up less than a touch-

Stanford quarterback John Paye was sacked four times by the Trojan defense Saturday and was
battered on numerous other occasions. Coach Jack Elway said yesterday that Paye's partially
separated right shoulder will likely keep him sidelined against Arizona this weekend.
down a game.
Then comes Washington, a good team that will be
playing its first game after the shocker in Seattle.
And there is also a game in Tempe against an
Arizona State team that shut out USC.
Then there are the pushovers — Oregon State
and California. Pushovers no more, though, as they
showed Saturday with upset wins over Washington
and Oregon that left the Cardinal alone in the Pac-10
basement.
The comparisons with 1982 that seemed so on
target earlier this season are fading. Fast. A 5-6
record verges on dreaming for this 1-5 team, and
the reincarnation of that high-powered Cardiac
Card, we-can-outscore-anyone offense is looking
like an early-season illusion.
The comparisons with 1983 — that miserable 1-
10 season that ended the Paul Wiggin era — are, sad
to say, coming up more and more. The Cardinal is in
last place in the Pac-10 with only one victory. That
was the year both Oregon State and Cal defeated
Stanford. And it was no fun.
Losing is never fun, but in times it can be excit
ing. Not anymore for Stanford. The only thing less
exciting Saturday was the USC band. The refund
line for season tickets forms to the right.
And the injuries don't make things any better. Of
the six players pictured on "The Right Stuff' poster,
as many as four may not play. It's been that kind of
season. Elway said it's "very doubtful" Paye will
play on Saturday. Paye said after the game that he'd
be ready. Elway, though, spent yesterday's press
conference saying Buckley would start and sopho
more Greg Ennis is ready to step in if necessary —
maybe a decoy, but don't count on it.
Brad Muster may be ready, but his bruised ster
num is a day-to-day kind of injury, and Elway again
wasn't sounding optimistic. As for the other two,
David Wyman is redshirting with a serious knee in

jury, and Joe Cain is somewhere other than Stan
ford. No one seems to know where.
Offensive linemen Jeff Marchin and Tom Nye
should be back this week, but the line still needs
time together to work effectively as a unit. And so
on.

woes in the 30-6 loss to USC Saturday.
Things may not get better soon. The Cards'
next two opponents are Arizona and Wash
ington.
