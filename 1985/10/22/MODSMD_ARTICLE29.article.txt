# Card Soccer Gears Up To Get SCU
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Youth versus experience.
That will be the theme of tonight's 7:30 p.m. men's
soccer match as the University of Santa Clara Bulldogs
host the Stanford Cardinal in Pacific Soccer Conference
play.
The Cardinal has used the experience of nine seniors
to win four out of its last five game, including three
straight conference victories.
On the other side of the field, the Broncos are led by
a trio of talented freshmen who have shown flashes of
brilliance througout the season.
"They're a young team, the kind of team that on any
given day can play way above their heads and beat
anyone," Stanford senior Giancarlo Feruzzi warned.
If, however, Feruzzi and his teammates continue to
play the way they have for the last two weeks, the
Broncos will have to be more than flashy.
The Stanford squad, 3-1 in the PSC and 8-6-2 over
all, has outscored its opponents by a 12-5 margin in the
last five games. Feruzzi has been on fire, tallying 10
points (two for each goal and one for each assist) in his
last seven games after going scoreless in the team's
first nine matches.
Stanford seniors Marshall Monroe, Tom Rafalovich
and Angel Vazquez have also put the ball in opponents'
nets over that stretch. In general, this has been a dif
ferent Stanford team from the beginning of the season.
"We're taking bigger strides now," Feruzzi said.
"Before we were walking with smaller steps."
Regardless, the Broncos will be chasing the Cardinal
with some young horses. Freshman forward Greg
Troupe leads Santa Clara in scoring with four goals and
one assist, while frosh goaltender Todd Neel sports a
1.48 goals against average.
David Viale, the third Bronco wunderkind, rounds
out the attack with three goals and
two assists for eight points. In an
ironic note, Troup and Viale were
both recruited here by Stanford
Coach Sam Koch, but ended up at
tending rival Santa Clara.
The Broncos have had a rough
start to their PSC season. Saturday
night's 4-1 loss to Fresno State
brought Santa Clara's league record
to 0-4 and 5-9-1 overall.
"They are better than that 4-1
score," Koch said. "Plus they want
to play us more than any other team
on their schedule. If you look at
past (Stanford-Santa Clara) scores,
you'll see they always play us
tough."
Last year saw the host Cardinal
edge Santa Clara by a 2-1 score.
