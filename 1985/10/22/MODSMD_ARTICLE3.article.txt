# Kaplan Probes Police Brutality
## 
### LYNN MARCUS Senior staff writer 
A probe into student allegations of
brutality by the Stanford and Santa Clara
County police nearly two weeks ago is
well underway, according to an inves
tigator University President Donald Ken
nedy appointed to look into the case.
Law Prof. John Kaplan, who began the
investigation six days after the Oct. 11 ar
rest of nine anti-apartheid protesters en
gaged in civil disobedience, said in an in
terview yesterday that he has obtained a
report and a videotape of the incident
from the police, shown the tape to wit
nesses and arrestees, interviewed police
officers and obtained statements from ob
servers and eight arrestees.
Kaplan declined to state his opinions on
the incident and said he is proceeding

quickly but has no set deadline for
presenting Kennedy with a written
report.
David Magnus, a graduate student in
philosophy and a Stanford Out of South
Africa-designated observer of the protest,
said Kaplan "seemed upset" by the ac
tions recorded by the police camera but
also seemed determined to judge the inci
dents surrounding the arrest on their legal
merits.
Another videotape, shot from outside
of Old Union by student Glenn Baker for a
communication class, shows the use of a
painful carrying hold on sophomore Peter
Heslin, according to Baker. Baker and
others said that Heslin's wrists were
bound behind his back and he was carried
out upside-down.
The Baker tape has been made
available to Kaplan, who has indicated he
may use it in in the investigation.

The incident that sparked the investiga
tion was the arrest of students engaged in
a sit-in at Old Union Oct. 11. The stu
dents, who were protesting apartheid and
Stanford's investments in companies
doing business in South Africa, refused to
leave the building when asked by Stanford
police and University administrators.
Four of the nine arrested students
resisted arrest by going limp. Officers
carried the four to a booking room, held
them to take their pictures and dragged
them to police vehicles.
Some protesters later complained that
police were unnecessarily brutal when
photographing and carrying those who
refused to cooperate. They said police
twisted arms, over-tightened handcuffs
and lifted students by the front of their
pants while photographing them.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington has denied that ex

cessive force was used. He was un
available for further comment yes
terday. Officials from the Santa
Clara County Sheriffs Office were
also unavailable for comment.
The six arrestees who refused to
be cite released were then taken to
jail, with the five males being taken
to North County Jail in Palo Alto.
Senior Robby Perkins has said that
he was then singled out, stripped
and beaten by Santa Clara County
deputies. Following his release,

Perkins was treated at the Stanford
Medical Center for bruises on his
head, neck and arms.
A spokesman for the Santa Clara
County Sheriff s Office has said that
Perkins was restrained and strip
searched because he refused to
cooperate with police and kicked
deputies at the jail. He denied
charges that Perkins was beaten.
Senior David Romo was the only
arrestee who declined to be inter
viewed by Kaplan.
