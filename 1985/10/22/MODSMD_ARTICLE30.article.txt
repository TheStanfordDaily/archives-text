## Women's soccer loses two in Colorado 
### ERIK STEN Staff Writer 
Sometimes even losing can be a
confidence builder. The women's
soccer team returned from this
weekend's Pike's Peak Women's
Collegiate Soccer Classic in Den
ver, Colorado, with a 1-2 record
and a renewed outlook.
On Friday the Cardinal fell 1-0 to
ninth-ranked Wisconsin. And Satur
day the team lost to eighth-ranked
Colorado College 3-0. After facing
those two national powers, Stan
ford rebounded and beat University
of Denver 1-0.
Going into the tournament, the
Cardinal team was playing as well
as it had all season. The offense
was beginning to score and the
perennially tough defense was sound
as always. Women's soccer coach

Helen Keohane's goal for the tourn
ament was "to play and show well
against some high-ranking teams."
And they did just that. "We
played well both Friday and Satur
day. Actually, we probably played
better in the games we lost than in
the game we won," Keohane said.
In the first half of the Wisconsin
game, the Cardinal quickly showed
that it belonged on the field with a
nationally ranked team. "We kind of
caught them off guard," Keohane
said.
Stanford moved the ball well and
the defense was stingy, but unfor
tunately for the team, the Cardinal
forwards were unable to score
against Wisconsin's strong defense.
For most of the game the Stan
ford defense held firm, giving up
only one goal to a potent Wisconsin

offense. But one goal was all it took
as Wisconsin won 1-0.
The next day the opponent was
Colorado College and the end result
wasn't quite as close. Again, the
Cardinal showed well, but it wasn't
enough against a team as experi
enced as Colorado College. The
final score was 3-0.
On Sunday the level of competi
tion went down a little bit. The
Denver squad was "comparable to a
number of the teams we've played
so far this year," Keohane said.
Playing their third game in three
days in the high altitude of
Colorado, the team was "a little bit
flat. They knew they weren't
playing against as good of a team,"
Keohane said. But she was also
"pleasantly surprised with our
physical condition. The altitude
didn't affect us as much as I thought
it might," she said.
The Stanford team was tired and
Denver played physically, trying to

use a little intimidation. But the tac
tic didn't really work.
Thirty-three minutes into the
game Stanford senior midfielder
Cheryl Gustafson received a pass in
Denver territory. She faked left and
dribbled the ball right, found an
opening and sent the ball by the
Denver goalkeeper.
Gustafson's unassisted shot, the
game's only goal, gave the Cardinal
a victory and sent Stanford home

with more than just a satisfied
feeling from well-played losses.
On the whole the team wa&
pleased with the trip. "We were
able to do some successful thing 6
against some very good teams,"
Keohane said.
To win their next game, Stanford
will have to at least duplicate that
level of play. Next Saturday the
Cardinal faces undefeated Cal-State
Hay ward.
