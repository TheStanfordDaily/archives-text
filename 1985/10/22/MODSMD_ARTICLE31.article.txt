# Early Ending Leaves Women's Golf in 2nd
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff Writer 
With rain curtailing the third
round of play, the Stanford
women's golf team finished in
second place yesterday behind
Tulsa University at the Nancy
Lopez Invitaional, held at the
Cedar Ridge Country Club in
Tulsa, Okla.
Tulsa was impressive from the
start on the par-71, 6,038-yard
course, charging in front with a
stellar team score of 297 on the
first day of play. Stanford was
solidly in second place, nine

strokes behind Tulsa at 306, but
four strokes ahead of Southern
Methodist, Southern California
and U.S. International.
After what turned out to be the
end of play Thursday, Stanford
remained ahead of other major
golf powers SMU, Oklahoma
State, USC and, according to
Coach Tim Baldwin, "our major
competition in the Far West Con
ference, Arizona State."
"It's always tough playing in
Tulsa," Baldwin said. "It's a diffi
cult course. It has a strong field,
and there were the usual rough
weather conditions."
Kathleen McCarthy, arguably

the nation's top player, led the
Card by placing fifth in the Lopez,
a poor finish for her. Kay Cor
nelius finished in eighth place, and
Kathy Kostas was right behind
her in ninth.
"(McCarthy) had a rather rough
tournament. We got very strong
performances from Kay and
Cathy, as well as Julie Carmichael
and freshman Clare Dolan,"
Baldwin said.
The squad's next tournament is
at home, as they host the Stan
ford Women's Intercollegiate on
Nov. 1-3. Baldwin is billing it as
the "number one intercollegiate
of the year."
