# Stanford Crew Rows On

### ROBERT PORTNOY 
The 1985-86 season marks the Stanford crew team's second year
as a varsity-two sport. And as has been his custom, freshman and
novice Coach Jim Farwell began it by spending his time out in front of
Maples Pavilion during registration recruiting potential crewers.
Farwell begins his fourth season here, after coaching crew at
Santa Clara for 10 years. He's always on the lookout for special ath
letes.
"The average size of crew members last season was 6-foot-3 and
185 pounds. Height is a definite advantage," Farwell said. "We're
looking for athletes with competetive experience.
"We want racers, guys who like to go fast. To them, everything's
a competition. Some have racer written all over their faces; with
others we have to pull it out of them," Farwell added.
As a varsity-two sport, the crew team receives some funds from
the Athletic Department, but must do a lot of its own fund raising.
Rookie coach Dave Bunnett will be Farwell's assistant this season.
He graduated from Stanford three years with a degree in human biol
ogy. He rowed on the crew team at Stanford and also rowed for two
national championship teams at Santa Clara.
"The guys seem motivated. They're paying attention, and they're
psyched to work," Bunnett said. "Ninety percent haven't taken a
stroke before, and they have 20 different things to remember. We're
in Roble Pool to give them one-to-one help. The goal is to make the
stroke come natural to them."
Of the original 120 who attended the first meeting, 75 potential
crewers remain. They are fighting for one of the 16 available spots
â€” eight on the freshman team and eight on the novice team open to
all classes.
They get up each day before classes start to get instruction at
Roble, and their workout ends with a run to the Dish and back.
They're also expected to do specific exercises, often pull-ups and
push-ups, on their own and to run the steps of Stanford Stadium.
"The guys have to be willing to work hard, to be unrelenting. We
don't handcuff anybody to the gunnels (the sides of the boat), but
they'll know for sure if they want to be a member of the Stanford
crew team," Farwell said.
David Zovak became interested in crew when he saw a flyer for
the first team meeting.
"I had never done crew before, but with crew I knew I wasn't
starting from behind. They're working us hard, but they're not killing

any way it can. Novice and freshman Coach Jim Farwell thinks
this may be the best year ever for the Cardinal crew team.

Now in its second year as a varsity-two sport, the Stanford
crew team is still getting up early and still looking to improve in
