# Stanford Crew Rows On
## 
### ROBERT PORTNOY 
The 1985-86 season marks the Stanford crew team's second year
as a varsity-two sport. And as has been his custom, freshman and
novice Coach Jim Farwell began it by spending his time out in front of
Maples Pavilion during registration recruiting potential crewers.
Farwell begins his fourth season here, after coaching crew at
Santa Clara for 10 years. He's always on the lookout for special ath
letes.
"The average size of crew members last season was 6-foot-3 and
185 pounds. Height is a definite advantage," Farwell said. "We're
looking for athletes with competetive experience.
"We want racers, guys who like to go fast. To them, everything's
a competition. Some have racer written all over their faces; with
others we have to pull it out of them," Farwell added.
As a varsity-two sport, the crew team receives some funds from
the Athletic Department, but must do a lot of its own fund raising.
Rookie coach Dave Bunnett will be Farwell's assistant this season.
He graduated from Stanford three years with a degree in human biol
ogy. He rowed on the crew team at Stanford and also rowed for two
national championship teams at Santa Clara.
"The guys seem motivated. They're paying attention, and they're
psyched to work," Bunnett said. "Ninety percent haven't taken a
stroke before, and they have 20 different things to remember. We're
in Roble Pool to give them one-to-one help. The goal is to make the
stroke come natural to them."
Of the original 120 who attended the first meeting, 75 potential
crewers remain. They are fighting for one of the 16 available spots
â€” eight on the freshman team and eight on the novice team open to
all classes.
They get up each day before classes start to get instruction at
Roble, and their workout ends with a run to the Dish and back.
They're also expected to do specific exercises, often pull-ups and
push-ups, on their own and to run the steps of Stanford Stadium.
"The guys have to be willing to work hard, to be unrelenting. We
don't handcuff anybody to the gunnels (the sides of the boat), but
they'll know for sure if they want to be a member of the Stanford
crew team," Farwell said.
David Zovak became interested in crew when he saw a flyer for
the first team meeting.
"I had never done crew before, but with crew I knew I wasn't
starting from behind. They're working us hard, but they're not killing

any way it can. Novice and freshman Coach Jim Farwell thinks
this may be the best year ever for the Cardinal crew team.

Now in its second year as a varsity-two sport, the Stanford
crew team is still getting up early and still looking to improve in
us. It's positive training, but it's
rough," Zovak said.
David Curry, on the other hand,
rowed a little for fun back home in
Detroit and found out about the
crew team from someone in his
dorm.
"I thought the workouts would
be impossible, but they're not. The
coaches are really great, and they
know their stuff. They're also put
ting in a lot of time for us. I went

out to Roble at 7:30 one night for
extra instruction," Curry said.
Not all the people on the Stanford
crew scene are new to the sport,
however. Freshman Spencer Kraik
rowed at Riddely College in On
tario, Canada, and Tyler Simonten
is the junior national skulling cham
pion. There are also Chris
Hutchins, who rowed at Phillip's
Academy in Andover, and Dave
Cozangian, who rowed at Belmont
Hills in Boston.
"This is the best group of ath
letes we've ever had. We should be
highly competetive. Our freshman
team has defeated Cal three con

secutive years, and we would like
to again," Farwell said. "We may
surprise some people, like Wash
ington. Our freshman team has
never beaten them."
Farwell and the crew team will
get their first shot at West Coast
powerhouse Washington when they
face them in a dual meet sometime
in April.
Though the season doesn't start
until spring, the final cuts will be
made within the next two to three
weeks.
Hopefully for Stanford, Farwell's
recruiting practices and hard work
will pay dividends for the Cardinal.
