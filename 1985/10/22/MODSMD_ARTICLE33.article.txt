# Card Harriers Return With Mixed Emotions
## 
### BILL JACKSON Staff writer 
This past weekend, the Cardinal
cross country teams claimed mixed
blessings and emotions at the Wis
consin/Burger King Invitational in
Madison, Wisconsin.
After each competed against 11
of the top schools in the nation, the
men found themselves sitting
proudly atop a sixth-place finish.
The women, though favored to
finish in the top two, could manage
only a respectable seventh.
Though the 50-degree tempera
ture and overcast weather would
normally have led to fast times on
the Wisconsin layout, previous rains
had turned the course into a sloppy,
muddy route. Nevertheless, for the
first time in many years, the men
powered their way into the national
spotlight.
The hard running Marc Olesen
led the Cardinal with a fifth place
finish in a time of 24:34.9 over the
eight kilometer (roughly five miles)
course. Olesen was a favorite to
win the race, but with two miles
left, a pack of four runners led by
the eventual winner, Wisconsin's
Tim Hacker, took off.
Not far behind were three Stan
ford harriers running in tandem.
With strong finishes by James Al
borough (23rd, 25:08.6), Jeff Atkin
son (25th, 25:11.0) and Ryan Stoll
(26th, 25:13.1), the Cardinal looked

like it would have a low point total
with a good group finish. However,
an 80 second gap to Stanford's fifth
man prevented a potential third
place finish for the Cardinal squad.
Senior Brian Pettingill finished in
the fifth and final scoring position
for the Cardinal by turning in a
26:34.5 performance for 72nd
place. He was followed by Steve
Schadler (75th, 26:42.5) and Jeff
Kostoff (80th, 26:52.7).
"We should move into the top 15
and maybe the top 10," senior cap
tain Jeff Atkinson commented on
the men's national ranking. "Last
week we were 19th." Arizona,
Arkansas and Wisconsin were 1,2
and 3, respectively, last week.
"I'm very pleased and proud of
our guys," Coach Brooks Johnson
said. "They've come a long way. As
the road for them was tougher,
their accomplishments are a lot
sweeter. I have much pride and ad
miration in them."
The Card women, having a tough
day, were led by blazing senior
Alison Wiley with a ninth place finish
in 17:29.1. She was followed by the
gutsy Regina Jacobs (19th,
17:52.9), Kathy Smith (43rd,
18:25.5), Stacey Zartler (51st,
18:33.8), Michelle Mason (61st,
18:43.2) and Kim Stevens (68th,
19:07.1)
"It was the worst possible day
we could have had," Mason said
thoughtfully. "But, thinking of it
positively, it was good practice for

nationals as a result of the traveling
and then racing in cold weather.
Now when the going gets tough,
we will know how to get tough."
The nationals will be held in chilly
Milwaukee, Wisconsin on Nov. 25.
Coach Johnson seemed to agree.
"We were just due for a bad meet,"
he said. "We've agonized over it
and worked it out. I have every
confidence in the women to get
back in the saddle. In the
meantime, we will back off for a few
days (in training) and wait for the
results of the blood work to come
back."
It seems the women's team has
been training so hard and on so little
food and sleep that Coach Johnson
wants to examine their health via
blood studies. The men are as
«•
healthy as horses, according to
Johnson.
Consequently, when the women
emerge for the Pac-West Confer
ence championships Nov. 2, in Los
Angeles, it will be a good bet they
will be back out for blood. The men
will follow suit as they set their
sights on a Pac-10 championship,
which will be held Nov. 4 on the
Stanford Golf Course.
Summing up the Card's past per
formance and eyeing the Pac lO
meet, captain Atkinson could only
mutter,"Arizona is toast." Mason
added with a growl, "And on that
we'll spread the jelly we turn the
legs of those Pac-West teams to."
