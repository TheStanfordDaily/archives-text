# 325-pound Perry rushes for a TD
## The
						Bears' 'Fridge' Rolls 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) â€” William
"The Refrigerator" Perry, a 325-
pound rookie defensive tackle,
went on the offense Monday night
to lead Walter Payton and the un
defeated Chicago Bears to a 23-7
National Football League victory
over the Green Bay Packers.
Perry, used in short-yardage,
goal-line situations, led the block
ing on Payton scoring runs of two
and one yards and also scored
himself on a one-yard run to the
delight of a Soldier Field crowd of
65,095.
Payton carried 25 times for 112
yards, giving the NFL's all-time

leading rusher his 66th career
100-yard game.
Lynn Dickey got the Packers
on the scoreboard first with a 27-
yard scoring pass to James Lof
ton. But the Bears dominated
thereafter, particularly a defense
that intercepted four passes and
recorded a fourth-quarter safety.
The victory gave the Bears a 7-
0 record, their best start since
1942 when the team won all 11 of
its regular season games. The
Bears also maintained a three
game lead over Detroit and Min
nesota in Central Division of the
National Conference. Green Bay

dropped to 3-4.
After the game, Payton
laughed when asked what it was
like to run behind "The
Refrigerator."
"It's great to hide behind him,"
Payton said. "Nobody can see
you."
"He's so wide that nobody ex
pects him to hit with such speed
and effectiveness," Payton
added.
"I want to help the team any
way I can," said Perry, who
claims he has lost 17 pounds from
his program weight.
