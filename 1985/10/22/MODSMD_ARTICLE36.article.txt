U.S. Seeks To Console Egypt
CAIRO, Egypt — A U.S. envoy met for nearly two hours here
yesterday with President Hosni Mubarak, and said afterward that
they had taken "a good first step" toward restoring normal relations
following the Achille Lauro incident.
The envoy, Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead, said Egypt
and the United States had agreed on the importance of pressing
ahead with the Middle East peace effort, thrown into disarray by
events of the past three weeks.
Whitehead, describing the talks as "thorough and friendly," said he
explained to Mubarak that "recent events were in no way directed
against Egypt or its people, for whom all Americans have the
deepest respect."
"We very much regret," he said, "that developments took the
course that they did. Our only object was to bring to justice criminals
who had hijacked a ship, terrorized its passengers and murdered an
American — a crippled man in a wheelchair."
The incident deeply offended some Egyptians, who felt they were
not being given credit for ending the Achille Lauro hijacking, and per
sonally humiliated Mubarak, who had guaranteed the hijackers safe
passage to Tunisia in return for their surrender and the release un
harmed of more than 500 other hostages.
Craxi Could Create Coalition
ROME — President Francesco Cossiga asked outgoing Prime
Minister Bettino Craxi yesterday to try to form Italy's 45th postwar
government to replace his coalition that collapsed last week in
recriminations over the handling of the hijacking of the Italian cruise
liner Achille Lauro.
Craxi, Italy's first socialist prime minister since the end of World
War 11, had been forced to resign on Thursday after Defense Mini
ster Giovanni Spadolini, a member of the Republican Party, pulled
his faction's three ministers out of Craxi's 26-month old five-party
coalition government.
Yesterday, two days after President Reagan sent an envoy here to
try to patch up relations between Washington and Rome, Cossiga,
following consultations with Italian political leaders, asked Craxi to
try to reconstuct the coalition government that had been one of the
most stable in the country since World War 11.
Craxi immediately scheduled a round of meetings with the leaders
of the country's three most important political parties — the Chris
tian Democrats, the nation's biggest party for the past 40 years; the
Communist Party, the second-largest vote-getter in elections, and
his own Socialist Party. He plans to hold meetings with the leaders of
the other important parties, Spadolini's Republicans, the Liberals
and the Social Democrats, today.
Craxi's success in forming a new government hinges on his ability
to put together a coalition that would command a strong majority of
non-Communist votes in Italy's 630-seat parliament.
Ortega Assails U.S. 'Terrorism'
UNITED NATIONS — President Daniel Ortega yesterday
accused the United States of "state terrorism" but said the
Nicaraguan government is willing to negotiate with Washington once
the United States drops its support of local rebels.
"Nicaragua is no enemy of the United States. There is no reason
for the United States to consider Nicaragua as such," Ortega said.
"Nothing in our revolutionary project is incompatible with normal and
friendly relations with the United States."
Ortega, the first speaker in yesterday's opening session of the
40th anniversary of the General Assembly, said "Nicaragua shall
never kneel before the policy of state terrorism being practiced by
U.S. rulers.
"In the past four years, 11 U.S. military maneuvers have been
carried out, openly threatening Nicaragua's sovereignty, as part of
the military preparations of the U.S. goverment to launch a direct
military invasion against my country," he said.
FMLN Admits Role in Abduction
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — Nearly six weeks after Presi
dent Jose Napoleon Duarte's daughter was abducted, leftist rebels
for the first time yesterday acknowledged responsibility for the kid
napping, saying it was part of their war to bring down the U.S.-
backed government.
In a clandestine radio broadcast, the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, an alliance of five rebel groups, said the kidnapping
and their attack on the army's military training school two weeks ago
had brought on "a crisis" for the government.
Political observers interviewed here agree that the kidnapping has
hurt Duarte politically and put the Christian Democrats on the defen
sive, but they say they do not believe that Duarte's government is
threatened.
The rebels are asking for the release of political prisoners in ex
change for Duarte Duran, and for more prisoners and the evacuation
of their wounded combatants in exchange for 23 mayors whom they
have kidnapped since April.
Church officials said last week that the government and the guer
rillas had agreed to handle the two matters separately and that
Duarte would be released by the weekend.
But the negotiations bogged down, apparently when freedom for
Duarte Duran became linked with the release of the mayors.
Archbishop Arturo Rivera y Damas and other negotiators were in
Panama yesterday continuing their efforts to resolve the case.
Zia Forsees Soviet Difficulties
NEW YORK — Pakistani President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq said
yesterday the Soviet Union and its Afghan ally have suffered 60,000-
70,000 casualties in less than six years of warfare in Afghanistan, and
predicted that Moscow will conclude sooner or later that "there is no
military solution."
Zia spoke in an hour-long interview that also covered his hopes for
improved relations with India's Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, whom
he will meet at the United Nations here tomorrow. He also discussed
the more limited, non-military role he sees for himself in a
postmartial-law Pakistan and prospects for currently banned political
opposition parties when martial law is lifted on or before this year
ends.
The Pakistani leader, who addresses the U.N. General Assembly
tomorrow, also said that Benazir Bhutto, a leading figure of the main
opposition Pakistan Peoples' Party who has been under 90-day
house arrest since late August, "can leave the country anytime" and
is expected to go back to France before Nov. 6. She had returned to
Pakistan from France to attend her brother's funeral.

Nicaraguan government is willing to negotiate with Washington once
the United States drops its support of local rebels.
"Nicaragua is no enemy of the United States. There is no reason
for the United States to consider Nicaragua as such," Ortega said.
"Nothing in our revolutionary project is incompatible with normal and
friendly relations with the United States."
Ortega, the first speaker in yesterday's opening session of the
40th anniversary of the General Assembly, said "Nicaragua shall
never kneel before the policy of state terrorism being practiced by
U.S. rulers.
"In the past four years, 11 U.S. military maneuvers have been
carried out, openly threatening Nicaragua's sovereignty, as part of
the military preparations of the U.S. goverment to launch a direct
military invasion against my country," he said.
FMLN Admits Role in Abduction
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — Nearly six weeks after Presi
dent Jose Napoleon Duarte's daughter was abducted, leftist rebels
for the first time yesterday acknowledged responsibility for the kid
napping, saying it was part of their war to bring down the U.S.-
backed government.
In a clandestine radio broadcast, the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, an alliance of five rebel groups, said the kidnapping
and their attack on the army's military training school two weeks ago
had brought on "a crisis" for the government.
Political observers interviewed here agree that the kidnapping has
hurt Duarte politically and put the Christian Democrats on the defen
sive, but they say they do not believe that Duarte's government is
threatened.
The rebels are asking for the release of political prisoners in ex
change for Duarte Duran, and for more prisoners and the evacuation
of their wounded combatants in exchange for 23 mayors whom they
have kidnapped since April.
Church officials said last week that the government and the guer
rillas had agreed to handle the two matters separately and that
Duarte would be released by the weekend.
But the negotiations bogged down, apparently when freedom for
Duarte Duran became linked with the release of the mayors.
Archbishop Arturo Rivera y Damas and other negotiators were in
Panama yesterday continuing their efforts to resolve the case.
Zia Forsees Soviet Difficulties
NEW YORK — Pakistani President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq said
yesterday the Soviet Union and its Afghan ally have suffered 60,000-
70,000 casualties in less than six years of warfare in Afghanistan, and
predicted that Moscow will conclude sooner or later that "there is no
military solution."
Zia spoke in an hour-long interview that also covered his hopes for
improved relations with India's Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, whom
he will meet at the United Nations here tomorrow. He also discussed
the more limited, non-military role he sees for himself in a
postmartial-law Pakistan and prospects for currently banned political
opposition parties when martial law is lifted on or before this year
ends.
The Pakistani leader, who addresses the U.N. General Assembly
tomorrow, also said that Benazir Bhutto, a leading figure of the main
opposition Pakistan Peoples' Party who has been under 90-day
house arrest since late August, "can leave the country anytime" and
is expected to go back to France before Nov. 6. She had returned to
Pakistan from France to attend her brother's funeral.
U.S. Seeks To Console Egypt
CAIRO, Egypt — A U.S. envoy met for nearly two hours here
yesterday with President Hosni Mubarak, and said afterward that
they had taken "a good first step" toward restoring normal relations
following the Achille Lauro incident.
The envoy, Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead, said Egypt
and the United States had agreed on the importance of pressing
ahead with the Middle East peace effort, thrown into disarray by
events of the past three weeks.
Whitehead, describing the talks as "thorough and friendly," said he
explained to Mubarak that "recent events were in no way directed
against Egypt or its people, for whom all Americans have the
deepest respect."
"We very much regret," he said, "that developments took the
course that they did. Our only object was to bring to justice criminals
who had hijacked a ship, terrorized its passengers and murdered an
American — a crippled man in a wheelchair."
The incident deeply offended some Egyptians, who felt they were
not being given credit for ending the Achille Lauro hijacking, and per
sonally humiliated Mubarak, who had guaranteed the hijackers safe
passage to Tunisia in return for their surrender and the release un
harmed of more than 500 other hostages.
Craxi Could Create Coalition
ROME — President Francesco Cossiga asked outgoing Prime
Minister Bettino Craxi yesterday to try to form Italy's 45th postwar
government to replace his coalition that collapsed last week in
recriminations over the handling of the hijacking of the Italian cruise
liner Achille Lauro.
Craxi, Italy's first socialist prime minister since the end of World
War 11, had been forced to resign on Thursday after Defense Mini
ster Giovanni Spadolini, a member of the Republican Party, pulled
his faction's three ministers out of Craxi's 26-month old five-party
coalition government.
Yesterday, two days after President Reagan sent an envoy here to
try to patch up relations between Washington and Rome, Cossiga,
following consultations with Italian political leaders, asked Craxi to
try to reconstuct the coalition government that had been one of the
most stable in the country since World War 11.
Craxi immediately scheduled a round of meetings with the leaders
of the country's three most important political parties — the Chris
tian Democrats, the nation's biggest party for the past 40 years; the
Communist Party, the second-largest vote-getter in elections, and
his own Socialist Party. He plans to hold meetings with the leaders of
the other important parties, Spadolini's Republicans, the Liberals
and the Social Democrats, today.
Craxi's success in forming a new government hinges on his ability
to put together a coalition that would command a strong majority of
non-Communist votes in Italy's 630-seat parliament.
