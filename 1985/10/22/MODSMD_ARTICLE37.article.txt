# Israeli leader addresses U.N.
## Peres Announces Offer for Mideast Peace 
### 
UNITED NATIONS — Prime Minister
Shimon Peres of Israel appealed to Jordan yes
terday to end their 37-year state of war and en
ter direct peace talks this year, with the United
Nations taking the initiative to bring the two
sides together.
"I invite this organization," said Peres, "to
depart from the tired and timid norm and to fulfill
its destiny ... by ushering the parties to the
conflict into a new diplomatic initiative."
Peres, one of more than 60 kings, presidents
and prime ministers gathering in New York to
celebrate the United Nations' 40th anniversary
on Thursday, departed from recent Israeli policy
by hinting at a U.N. role as an "international
forum" that would help to launch and support the
peace process. This moved Israel closer to Jor
danian King Hussein's demand for an interna
tional conference that would act as an "umbrella"
for negotiations.
Jordanian Ambassador Adullah Salah joined in
the traditional boycott of the Israeli speech by
leaving the assembly chamber along with all
other Arabs, except for the Egyptians. He com
mented afterward, however, that his govern
ment was studying and analyzing Peres' remarks
and giving them "careful consideration."
Nowhere did Peres explicitly rule out partici

pation by the Palestine Liberation Organization.
A PLO role was a condition for talks as set by
Hussein. Peres made only an oblique reference
to "PLO terrorism," focusing on a call for the
Palestinian people to renounce belligerency and
talk peace with Israel.
The negotiations, said Peres, "may be in
itiated with the support of an international forum
as agreed upon by the negotiating states" but
"negotiations between Israel and Jordan are to
be conducted between an Israeli delegation on
one hand and a Jordanian-Palestinian or Jordanian
delegation on the other." The latter, he added,
must "represent peace, not terror."
Peres suggested the talks could be broadened
beyond the base of Security Council Resolutions
242 and 338, which outline a framework for a
Middle East settlement but make no reference to
the Palestinians. They could "deal with the
demarcation of boundaries as well as the resolu
tion of the Palestinian problem," he said.
Peres was similarly conciliatory and imprecise
in his references to the nature of the
"international forum" that could initiate and sup
port the peace process. He said the permanent
members of the Security Council — the United
States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and
China — could be involved but cautioned that Is
rael's position was that those that do not have

diplomatic relations with Israel — Moscow and
Peking — "exclude themselves from such a
role."
Privately, Jordanian officials suggested that
the proposals would depend on the spirit with
which the ideas in the speech are pursued. The
officials conceded that there was a shift in Is
rael's acceptance of an international forum and
its willingness to go beyond the limitations of
Resolution 242. But they cautioned that the offer
to attend an international forum was carefully
qualified by Peres, and there was no clear sign of
Israel's willingness to permit PLO representa
tion in the negotiations — a necessary condition,
as one Jordanian said, "whether we like it or
not."
But PLO representative Zehdi Labib Terzi
dismissed the Israeli suggestion as a speech
"directed at the U.S. audience to tell them Israel
wants peace." He said that Peres should realize
that Hussein cannot move without the PLO.
The U.N. ceremonies continue today and to
morrow, with more than 20 heads of state or
governments scheduled to address the assembly
each day.
The anniversary ceremonies are supposed to
conclude with the adoption by consensus of a
declaration commemorating the principles in the
U.N. Charter.
