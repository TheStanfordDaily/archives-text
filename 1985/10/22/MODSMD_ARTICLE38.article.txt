# Killer Dan White Commits Suicide

### 
SAN FRANCISCO â€” Former
Supervisor Dan White, the assassin
of San Francisco Mayor George
Moscone and Supervisor Harvey
Milk, committed suicide in the ga
rage of his home here yesterday,
just over a month short of the
seventh anniversay of the sensa
tional slayings.
Police said White's body was dis
covered about 2 p.m. by a younger
brother, Tom White.
White, 39, had called his brother,
asking him to come over in the af
ternoon. When Tom White arrived,
he found his brother's body inside a
white Buick sedan in the garage,
with a garden hose running from
the exhaust pipe into a partially
opened window.
Three handwritten notes were
found taped to the car, one to his
brother, another to his mother and
a third to his wife, Mary Ann, 43.
San Francisco Deputy Mayor
Hadley Roff said White's suicide let
ters contained no reference to the

City Hall killings but rather men
tioned arrangements for his funeral
and for his family.
On Nov. 27, 1978, White gunned
down Moscone and Milk, the city's
first homosexual supervisor, in
their City Hall offices. At his mur
der trial, White used a controversial
diminished capacity defense, and
was convicted of manslaughter.
The verdict on the lesser charge
and the light sentence that accom
panied it triggered a night of rioting
in San Francisco.
White spent his five years in
prison quietly, a model prisoner.
His parole to Los Angeles
County in January 1984, touched off
an initial wave of controversy, es
pecially amoung gays, but soon the
name of Dan White disappeared
from the news and he lived out his
one-year parole in seclusion in Los
Angeles' San Fernando Valley.
Since then, White has been living
in the Bay Area with his wife and
three children.

In the years since the killings,
White has expressed no public
remorse.
Roff said White had just returned
from Ireland. While serving his five
year sentence at Soledad State
Prison, White often talked of taking
such a trip.
As the rumors of White's suicide

spread through City Hall yesterday,
most people reacted with shock.
The news interrupted a meeting of
the Board of Supervisors, when
board president John Molinari was
called to confer with police about
the death.
But Supervisor Harry Britt, a
gay who replaced Milk on the
board, said he was not shocked by
White's death.
"It comes as no surprise that Dan
White was a very disturbed man.
The assassinations of Harvey Milk
and George Moscone are proof of
that fact. Dan White is in death as
he was in life."
Mayor Diane Feinstein talked
more sympathetically.
"I am very sorry to hear that Dan
White has taken his life," the mayor
said. "My sympathy goes to his
widow Mary Ann and his children
and his family who have suffered
very much. This latest tragedy
should close a very sad chapter in
this city's history."
