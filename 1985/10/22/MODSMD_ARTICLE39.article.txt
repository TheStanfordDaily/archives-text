NAACP Case Cleared
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court
cleared the way yesterday for the resumption
of the long legal fight over school desegrega
tion in Los Angeles.
In a brief order, the justices let stand a
December ruling by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court
of Appeals in San Francisco permitting the
NAACP to pursue its case in federal court.
In an important test of the reach of federal
anti-discrimination laws, the Supreme Court
also agreed yesterday to decide whether com
mercial airlines must comply with government
regulations protecting the rights of the handi
capped.
Macy's To Be Bought
The top manager of R.H. Macy, the nation's
10th largest retailer, said yesterday that a
move is being made to make the company
private in what would be the largest takeover
of a retailer and among the largest leveraged
buyouts ever.
Edward Finkelstein, Macy's chairman and

chief executive, and Mark Handler, the com
pany's president and chief operating officer,
are leading a group of several dozen senior ex
ecutives in an offer of $3.58 billion in cash, or
$70 a share, for the 51.2 million Macy's shares
outstanding.
Industry analysts, who said Macy's was ripe
for a takeover because a recent earnings drop
caused its stock to be undervalued, called the
$70-a-share offer fair. They said that they ex
pect Macy's board to accept the proposal and
that no competing bids from other investors
will be made.
Laureate Rips Plan
WASHINGTON — A Senate-passed pro
gram designed to force a balanced federal
budget by 1991 is loaded with "mickey
mousing" proposals that will do little to reduce
the budget deficit, this year's winner of the
Nobel Prize in economics told congressmen
yesterday.
Franco Modigliani, an economics professor
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
told a hearing of the Joint Economic Commit

tee that the Republican-sponsored proposal
was an attempt at giving the appearance of fis
cal responsibility while delaying politically
tough budget-cutting until after the 1986 elec
tions.
The Reagan Administration has thrown its
weight behind the Senate plan, authored by
Republican Senators Phil Gramm of Texas and
Warren Rudman of New Hamshire.
The plan details a descending series of an
nual deficit targets over the next five years.
Modigliani said that at least half of the future
budget cutting mechanisms in Gramm-Rudman
were, "to borrow an expression from my
grandson, plain Mickey Mousing."
Quiet Market Drops
NEW YORK — Retailing stocks attracted
some enthusiastic buyers, but the rest of the
market gave ground in a relatively quiet ses
sion on Wall Street yesterday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
28.90 points last week, dropped 4.70 to
1,364.14.
