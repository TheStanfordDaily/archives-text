# Energy Consciousness Raised

### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
In light of the fact that Stanford spends nearly a 10th
of its annual budget paying gas and electric bills, the
University has joined in a national awareness week
aimed at making the community more aware of the en
ergy it burns.
The goal of American Energy Awareness Week is to
increase the likelihood that more people will translate
this awareness into action, according to Phyllis Rob
inson, an office assistant at the Stanford Energy
Resource Management Group.
Robinson said her office is involved chiefly in coordi
nating a program in which representatives from each
University department report rates of energy con
sumption to a building energy manager.
The major consumers of energy on campus are aca
demic buildings with "a lot of computers" that need
electricity to operate during the day and chilled water
to cool off during the night, she said.
Forsythe Hall, the base for Information and Techni
cal Sei vices near Stanford Medical Center, consumes
the most energy of any campus building, burning four
million kilowatt hours per year. Robinson said that
translates to about $400,000 in energy expenses.
The next two major energy consumers are Herrin
Hall, which houses the Biology Department, and the
McCullough Electrical Engineering Building.

Combined, they consume between three and four mil
lion kilowatt hours of energy per year, Robinson said.
According to Robinson, the trend for constructing
buildings with major computer facilities is going to con
tinue, and with them, the energy bill will continue to
escalate. The Energy Resource Management Group
projects that the bill will rise at least 5 percent a year
through 1990.
Stanford's annual bill, which accounts for 8 percent
of its annual operating budget, amounts to $20 million
when the expenses of processing and supplying steam
and chilled water are taken into consideration, Robin
son said.
Robinson said the fact that energy bills take up such
a major part of the University's budgetary allocations
necessarily takes away from hiring new professors and
other programs Stanford might want to implement.
Compared with the energy bills of other universities,
Stanford's bill is "up there with a lot of the major uni
versities," according to Robinson. UC-Berkeley's an
nual bill, for instance, was $15 million last year, she
said. Harvard spent $24 million on energy expenses,
and the University of Michigan shelled out $27 million.
The largest energy demand at campus dormitories,
according to Ken Wilke, an energy engineer at the En
ergy Rersource Management Group, is for steam to
heat rooms. Wilke said that academic buildings use
more energy than dormitories because they have a
great deal of energy-consuming technical equipment
that dorms lack.
