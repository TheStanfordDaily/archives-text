New Wozniak Device
PALO ALTO — Little Tyrone, a remote
control device for home entertainment equip
ment, will be introduced later this month as
me tirst product of the new company formed
by Steven Wozniak.
Wozniak, 35, co-founded Apple Computer
Inc., but left Apple in February to found his
new company, CL9.
Unlike other remote control devices, the
new product does not have to be aimed at an
appliance to make it work, he said in an inter
view published Monday by the Peninsula
Times Tribune.
"People don't know they have that problem,
but it's only $20, and we're not banking the

company on it,"he said. "But it's cute. It's so
neat to find a tiny circuit that does something
useful."
Clubs To Go Coed
SAN FRANCISCO — A Boys' Club that lets
all boys use its gym and swimming pool must
also open its doors to girls, the state Supreme
Court ruled yesterday.
In a 5-2 vote, the court said state civil rights
laws ban sex discrimination in "public accom
modations," and defined that term to include a
club built around recreational facilities that are
available to the public — excluding girls — on a
non-selective basis.

The Santa Cruz Boys' Club is "classically
public in its operation," said the opinion by
Justice Joseph Grodin. "It opens its recrea
tional doors to the entire youthful population of
Santa Cruz, with the sole condition that its
users be male."
It was the first time the court had applied
the civil rights laws, which forbid discrimina
tion by all business establishments, to cover a
nonprofit community-service organization.
The ruling appeared to cover recreation
based activities such as Little League. It does
not apply to private clubs, and the court
expressly reserved judgment on groups like
the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, which may
have a different focus of activities and other
justifications for membership restrictions.
