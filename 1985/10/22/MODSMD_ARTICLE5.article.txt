# Art Museum Missing 18th Century Artifact

### DOUG LEADON 
An 18th century Chinese handscroll, valued at
$750, may have been stolen from the Stanford
Museum of Art, Museum Director and Art Depart
ment Chairman Lorenz Eitner reported Friday.
Museum employees found the scroll missing
when they returned a group of oriental paintings to
storage. The art pieces were photographed earlier
this year at a photo lab on campus during inventory
processing. Staff members at the museum say they
are certain the scroll was among the works returned
from the lab.
The objects had remained locked in the office of a
curator until recently, when all but the missing scroll
were returned to storage.
"It seems a very unlikely theft," said Eitner, who
went on to say the scroll would be very difficult to
sell and was "by no means the most valuable piece"
in the group of objects sent to be photographed. Eit
ner said he doesn't know who would want to take
the scroll, but the museum has been thoroughly

searched and, until the missing object is found, it
will be presumed stolen.
Eitner stressed, however, that the museum has
over 50,000 art pieces in storage and the Chinese
handscroll, which measures six inches high by 25
inches wide when fully unrolled, may still be there.
Prince Yung-Jung, the son of an 18th century
Chinese emperor, depicted a landscape on the scroll
using ink and color. The artwork was a gift to the
museum several years ago but has never been dis
played there.
Museum officials have notified the Stanford police
of the possible theft.
If the handscroll is indeed stolen, it would not be
the first time Stanford Museum pieces have been
stolen.
The most recent theft occured in May when a
small Rodin sculpture valued between $2,500 and
$10,000 was stolen from the museum.
The piece is an 18-inch tall model of the full-size
"Jean de Fiennes" statue in Memorial Court.
In 1975, 40 rare coins with a nominal value of
$28,000 were stolen and then returned a year later.
