The morning sun rises in the sky
above the island paradise of Kona,
Hawaii. Waves of deep, blue water
break gently upon the shore, invit
ing swimmers to jump in for a
refreshing dip.
One morning every October,
over 1,000 athletes heed this call of
the Pacific by competing in the
Ironman Triathlon World Champi
onship.
At 7 a.m., they plunge into the
water for a 2.4-mile swim. Within
two-and-a-half hours, they're dried
off and mounted on their bikes for a
112-mile bike ride over challenging
hills, battling headwinds up to 35
miles per hour and temperatures up
to 100 degrees blazing off the pave
ment. Finally, on wobbly legs, they
round out their day by running a full
26.2-mile marathon.
This Saturday, Stanford graduate
Joanne Ernst and second-year busi
ness school students Dave Benwell
and Dan Wimsatt will be among the
participants in the 1985 Ironman.
