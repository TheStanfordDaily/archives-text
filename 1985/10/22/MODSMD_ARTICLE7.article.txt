The morning sun rises in the sky
above the island paradise of Kona,
Hawaii. Waves of deep, blue water
break gently upon the shore, invit
ing swimmers to jump in for a
refreshing dip.
One morning every October,
over 1,000 athletes heed this call of
the Pacific by competing in the
Ironman Triathlon World Champi
onship.
At 7 a.m., they plunge into the
water for a 2.4-mile swim. Within
two-and-a-half hours, they're dried
off and mounted on their bikes for a
112-mile bike ride over challenging
hills, battling headwinds up to 35
miles per hour and temperatures up
to 100 degrees blazing off the pave
ment. Finally, on wobbly legs, they
round out their day by running a full
26.2-mile marathon.
This Saturday, Stanford graduate
Joanne Ernst and second-year busi
ness school students Dave Benwell
and Dan Wimsatt will be among the
participants in the 1985 Ironman.
Ernst, an economics major who
graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1981,
considers herself a contender
among the women in Saturday's
race.
"Ideally, I'd like to win that
race," she said. "I have an equal
chance of winning that race as a
handful of other women."
Last year, competing in the Iron
man for the first time, Ernst took
fourth place for women with a time
of 10:40.33, capturing first place in
the 25-29 age division.
"I was two minutes behind third,
and I broke the course record from
the year before," she recalled.
Benwell and Wimsatt, on the
other hand, will be competing in
their first Ironman on Saturday.
They have set individual target
times for the race. "It's changed a
little in the last month," Wimsatt
said. "Originally, it was 10:45. Now
it's about 11:15."
Benwell, who is also The Daily's
business manager, guessed that he
could finish in 14 hours.
Competitors are given 17 hours
to complete the Ironman, Last
year's overall winner, Dave Scott,
finished in 8:54.20.
Ernst's status as a full-time tri
athlete allows her to devote more
time to training.
"In the fall of '83, I was going to
go to business school, but I
deferred those plans to become a
triathlete," she said.
"I do all my training alone," Ernst
explained. "I think it makes you
mentally tougher to train alone."
Benwell has also done most of his
training by himself.
"I do most of mine alone. I was
here all summer, and I didn't know
many people arouond," he said.
Wimsatt, however, trained with a
small group over the summer. "I
spent all summer training with
about eight people, early in the
morning and late at night," he said.
Ernst explained, "Of the three
sports, technique is the most im
portant in swimming." She swims
with Los Altos masters; and Wim
satt swam with a masters swim club

in Phoenix over the summer.
Benwell said he has had to con
centrate especially hard on his
swimming, because before he
started doing triathlons a year-and
a-half ago, he didn't swim much at
all. "If I can do it, anyone can do it,"
he said.
Ernst allows herself flexibility in
her training schedule.
"Days are really unstructured,
compared to a normal job," she
said. "I kind of focus on quality, not
quantity."
Benwell and Wimsatt, who are
also involved in the recruiting
season at the business school, have
found it harder to fit training into
their schedules.
"Sleep is the first to go," Benwell
said. He said he has found it a chal
lenge to maintain the peak physical
condition he achieved in summer
training.
Wimsatt's training entails 13,000
yards of swimming, 230 miles of

biking and 45 to 50 miles of running
per week.
Because she is protecting her
amateur status, Ernst doesn't ac
cept the prize money she wins in
races. She relies on sponsorship to
cover her costs. "Nike is my major
sponsor, along with Bud Light,"
she said.
Benwell said that a new bike,
travel costs and cycling clothes
have made the Ironman an expen
sive venture. "I figure, just because
of this race, I've spent $1,500."
Ernst isn't sure whether she'll
compete in another Ironman after
1985.
"I'm not planning things much
longer than a season at a time," she
said. She mentioned that gaining a
spot on the 1988 Olympic biking
team might be a future goal.
Wimsatt plans to recover from
the race on Sunday and fly home on
Monday. "I've got two midterms on
Tuesday," he said."

over 1,000 athletes heed this call of
the Pacific by competing in the
Ironman Triathlon World Champi
onship.
At 7 a.m., they plunge into the
water for a 2.4-mile swim. Within
two-and-a-half hours, they're dried
off and mounted on their bikes for a
112-mile bike ride over challenging
hills, battling headwinds up to 35
miles per hour and temperatures up
to 100 degrees blazing off the pave
ment. Finally, on wobbly legs, they
round out their day by running a full
26.2-mile marathon.
This Saturday, Stanford graduate
Joanne Ernst and second-year busi
ness school students Dave Benwell
and Dan Wimsatt will be among the
participants in the 1985 Ironman.
Ernst, an economics major who
graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1981,
considers herself a contender
among the women in Saturday's
race.
"Ideally, I'd like to win that
race," she said. "I have an equal
chance of winning that race as a
handful of other women."
Last year, competing in the Iron
man for the first time, Ernst took
fourth place for women with a time
of 10:40.33, capturing first place in
the 25-29 age division.
"I was two minutes behind third,
and I broke the course record from
the year before," she recalled.
Benwell and Wimsatt, on the
other hand, will be competing in
their first Ironman on Saturday.
They have set individual target
times for the race. "It's changed a
little in the last month," Wimsatt
said. "Originally, it was 10:45. Now
it's about 11:15."
Benwell, who is also The Daily's
business manager, guessed that he
could finish in 14 hours.
Competitors are given 17 hours
to complete the Ironman, Last
year's overall winner, Dave Scott,
finished in 8:54.20.
Ernst's status as a full-time tri
athlete allows her to devote more
time to training.
"In the fall of '83, I was going to
go to business school, but I
deferred those plans to become a
triathlete," she said.
"I do all my training alone," Ernst
explained. "I think it makes you
mentally tougher to train alone."
Benwell has also done most of his
training by himself.
"I do most of mine alone. I was
here all summer, and I didn't know
many people arouond," he said.
Wimsatt, however, trained with a
small group over the summer. "I
spent all summer training with
about eight people, early in the
morning and late at night," he said.
Ernst explained, "Of the three
sports, technique is the most im
portant in swimming." She swims
with Los Altos masters; and Wim
satt swam with a masters swim club

in Phoenix over the summer.
Benwell said he has had to con
centrate especially hard on his
swimming, because before he
started doing triathlons a year-and
a-half ago, he didn't swim much at
all. "If I can do it, anyone can do it,"
he said.
Ernst allows herself flexibility in
her training schedule.
"Days are really unstructured,
compared to a normal job," she
said. "I kind of focus on quality, not
quantity."
Benwell and Wimsatt, who are
also involved in the recruiting
season at the business school, have
found it harder to fit training into
their schedules.
"Sleep is the first to go," Benwell
said. He said he has found it a chal
lenge to maintain the peak physical
condition he achieved in summer
training.
Wimsatt's training entails 13,000
yards of swimming, 230 miles of

biking and 45 to 50 miles of running
per week.
Because she is protecting her
amateur status, Ernst doesn't ac
cept the prize money she wins in
races. She relies on sponsorship to
cover her costs. "Nike is my major
sponsor, along with Bud Light,"
she said.
Benwell said that a new bike,
travel costs and cycling clothes
have made the Ironman an expen
sive venture. "I figure, just because
of this race, I've spent $1,500."
Ernst isn't sure whether she'll
compete in another Ironman after
1985.
"I'm not planning things much
longer than a season at a time," she
said. She mentioned that gaining a
spot on the 1988 Olympic biking
team might be a future goal.
Wimsatt plans to recover from
the race on Sunday and fly home on
Monday. "I've got two midterms on
Tuesday," he said."
