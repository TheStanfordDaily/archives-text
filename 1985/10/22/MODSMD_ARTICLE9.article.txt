# Prof. Discusses Apartheid History

### JOHN CALLON 
Arguing that current investments in South
Africa are supporting the "persistence of apart
heid,' Education Prof. Joel Samoff gave a brief
history of apartheid and offered his view of the
current political turmoil in South Africa at a dis
cussion in a student residence last night.
Samoff also said he was "fairly depressed"
about the University's booklet entitled "Stanford
and South Africa."
When asked about current efforts by the Of
fice of Public Affairs to solicit essays for release
in a second publication, Samoff said the adminis
tration "has got the process all wrong. This is
something the administration would do on our
behalf. That's as inappropriate in round two as in
round one."
Samoff added: "It will probably be messy.
Let's get people involved. Let's organize the
process to get people talking about South Africa.
It looks like the University will repeat the same

mistake they made in creating the booklet."
The substance of the divestment debate no
longer centers on the issue of "majority rule.
That's going to happen. The issue is how,"
Samoff said.
On the subject of corporate involvement in
South Africa, Samoff told a small group in the
Soto lounge that "ultimately [a corporation] can't
exist in a society (that is) at odds with its funda
mental principles."
Corporate investment is currently "supporting
the persistence of apartheid," he said.
"Businesses have not been corrosive of apart
heid. . . . The more intensive the racial discrimi
nation, the more profitable it has been."
Discussing the prospects for reform, he said
"the moment of peaceful transition is long past."
He added that neither chaos nor slow reform
is "the most likely scenario." Samoff said he
foresees "a continuing but not quite overwhelm
ing struggle over a long period," and conjectured
that change is likely to occur before a "complete
cataclysm" takes place.

On the efficacy of divestment, Samoff said that
"long before withdrawal, effects are felt," refer
ring to a discussion he had with a Ford execu
tive, who told him that pressure from divest
ment groups made it essential for Ford to dem
onstrate progress in South Africa.
Samoff said that the impact of foreign eco
nomic pressure is felt first in white South Africa.
The former director of African studies also
took exception to the University's recent hand
ling of the divestment controversy. The issue of
divestment "is considered a matter of public re
lations by the University. It undermines the
prospect of a consultative process changing the
University position," Samoff said.
He also was critical of the general focus on
"the University as stockholder. We ought to be
focusing on the University as an educational in
stitution."
Citing the most prevalent image associated
with Africa in the minds of Bay Area residents as
Tarzan, he called for the University to "take the
lead in creating some real educational models."
