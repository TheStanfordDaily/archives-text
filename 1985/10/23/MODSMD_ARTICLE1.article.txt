# Hunter S. Thompson Hunts Savage Dream

He wore sunglasses.
He shuffled around the stage.
And he mumbled into the
microphone.
Only Hunter S. Thompson would
light up a joint thrown to him from
his audience.
The crowd flowed out the doors
and onto the stage at Kresge
Auditorium last night as Thompson
walked in a half hour late.
He immediately began searching
for a real glass to hold his requested
Chivas.
"Stanford, the great yuppie
kingdom . . . and we have plastic
cups?" Thompson said.
Asst. Geology Prof. David Larue
introduced Thompson as the first
speaker in the ASSU Speakers
Bureau series on "Politics and the
Media." Thompson, a freelance
writer, is best known for the crea
tion of what he terms "Gonzo" jour
nalism, a stream-of-consciousness
writing style that has earned him a
cult reputation among college stu
dents. His works include "Fear and

Loathing in Las Vegas," "The
Great White Shark Hunt" and, most
recently, "The Curse of Lono."
Thompson spent most of the
time fielding questions from the au
dience. Sometimes he answered
them directly, but most often he
used them as a springboard for
ramblings about his life, his work
and his political views.
The audience gave Thompson an
enthusiastic reception, despite the
wait. One student bounded up on
the stage, flame in hand, ready to
light the author's cigarette, which
was already mounted in a filter.
"This is a thoughtful audience,"
Thompson said.
Perhaps not thoughtful enough,
however. The football Thompson
tossed around when he walked on
stage was stolen at the end of the
night.
Thompson's books are usually
remembered for the first-hand, ex
plicit hallucinogenic encounters.
Many of the questions asked last
night of Thompson concerned these
experiences.

"It was just after Barstow on the edge of the desert when the
drugs began to take hold." So began the book which catapulted
"Gonzo journalism," the brainchild of Hunter S. Thompson, to
national attention. He spoke of this and other arcane subjects to
a packed Kresge Auditorium last night.
