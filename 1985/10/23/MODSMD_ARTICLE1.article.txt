# Hunter S. Thompson Hunts Savage Dream
## 
### LIZ EGAN LISA LYNCH 
He wore sunglasses.
He shuffled around the stage.
And he mumbled into the
microphone.
Only Hunter S. Thompson would
light up a joint thrown to him from
his audience.
The crowd flowed out the doors
and onto the stage at Kresge
Auditorium last night as Thompson
walked in a half hour late.
He immediately began searching
for a real glass to hold his requested
Chivas.
"Stanford, the great yuppie
kingdom . . . and we have plastic
cups?" Thompson said.
Asst. Geology Prof. David Larue
introduced Thompson as the first
speaker in the ASSU Speakers
Bureau series on "Politics and the
Media." Thompson, a freelance
writer, is best known for the crea
tion of what he terms "Gonzo" jour
nalism, a stream-of-consciousness
writing style that has earned him a
cult reputation among college stu
dents. His works include "Fear and

Loathing in Las Vegas," "The
Great White Shark Hunt" and, most
recently, "The Curse of Lono."
Thompson spent most of the
time fielding questions from the au
dience. Sometimes he answered
them directly, but most often he
used them as a springboard for
ramblings about his life, his work
and his political views.
The audience gave Thompson an
enthusiastic reception, despite the
wait. One student bounded up on
the stage, flame in hand, ready to
light the author's cigarette, which
was already mounted in a filter.
"This is a thoughtful audience,"
Thompson said.
Perhaps not thoughtful enough,
however. The football Thompson
tossed around when he walked on
stage was stolen at the end of the
night.
Thompson's books are usually
remembered for the first-hand, ex
plicit hallucinogenic encounters.
Many of the questions asked last
night of Thompson concerned these
experiences.


Lisa Blackaller/Daily
"It was just after Barstow on the edge of the desert when the
drugs began to take hold." So began the book which catapulted
"Gonzo journalism," the brainchild of Hunter S. Thompson, to
national attention. He spoke of this and other arcane subjects to
a packed Kresge Auditorium last night.
"Heroin? It's a bad drug," Thompson
mumbled.
When asked his opinion about first lady
Nancy Reagan's anti-drug campaign,
Thompson called it a lot of propaganda.
"She's a silly little bitch," he said. After a
loud response from the crowd, Thompson
added, "I'm sure if she had the chance, she
would say something worse about me.
"Of course I'm not here to do drugs, un
less someone in the front row has any," he
said.
Thompson spoke first about AIDS, in
response to a suggestion from the audience
that the drinking glass handed up to him
might be contaminated with the disease.
"How is AIDS going to affect your life?" he
asked the audience, and then suggested it
might "eliminate the possibility of having
sex. . . . The whole AIDS thing is just a
scare, a political tool. It's not going to affect
my behavior."
Other Thompson ramblings:
• LSD: "A lot of people say any acid is too
much, but that's not true. How many
people in the audience have used acid?
(About 50 people raised their hands.) How
many people enjoyed it? (Roughly the same
amount raised their hands.) I'm not an
abuser of acid ... but I'm a believer in it.
"Let's dispense with this party dilettante
shit like cocaine. There's no mistake when
you do good acid. ... It makes you . . .
lose control over any events that might
happen to you. You just have to sit back and
deal with things.
"Anything can happen. . . speaking from
experience. If you're going to strangle your
wife when you're on acid, well then, maybe
you're going to strangle your wife. Maybe
you're going to cry all night. ... I like to do
acid about twice a year just to blow the

tubes out, to keep in touch, you know."
• The Grateful Dead: "Great friends of
mine. . . . They're the most human and ba
sically elegant band around. Of course,
they've been around for a long time. ... If
you're going to do something for 20 years,
it'll be better than if you've just done it for
20 days."
• Drinking games: "I'm appalled to come to
Stanford and find that drinking games are so
important. Don't you have anything better
to do? (Author) Ken Kesey came from
here, so you have a somewhat honored
tradition to keep up with. Of course,
there's also the evil Hoover Institution act
ing against you. Are drinking games dan
gerous? Are games dangerous? Maybe
Dungeons and Dragons."
• Carl Lazlo, Oscar, the Buffalo: "The
character in the movie 'American Buffalo,'
that lousy movie that Bill Murray

made. ... I hate it even though I've never
seen it. . . . It was supposed to make me a
lot of money, and it never did. . . . That
character was based on my real-life attor
ney, Oscar. What happened to him? How do
you talk about something like that? He was
killed . . . shot in the stomach. I never
missed anyone so much. It's strange, to
never hear his screech of tires in the morn
ing. ... He was a serious piece of work.
It's hard to find somebody who has the en
ergy Oscar had."
• The re-emergence of former President
Nixon as an arbitrator between baseball
umpires and owners: "Nixon can't drink.
That's his problem. Nixon is really one of
my favorite people . . . it's a pleasure to
see an old twisted friend around. . . . But
imagine — I mean, would anyone in this
room be able to negotiate a settlement be
tween umpires and owners? It takes a mind

wallowing in the alleys of half-ambitious
greed. . . . He's a perfect expression of
our culture."
• Expectations for students today: "Very
little, frankly. This is a generation when all
students seem to seek a job with E.F. Hut
ton. It's a generation of commercially ori
ented swine. Somebody has to say
something."
• The Duke character in "Doonesbury":
"You want to grow up to be a fireman, you
want to grow up to be president, but no one
wants to grow up to be a cartoon character.
The only thing I have to say about
(Doonesbury creator) Garry Trudeau . . .
(is) I feel sorry for his parents. . . . It's a
shame he doesn't do better work."
• Working for the San Francisco Examiner:
"I've made five deadlines so far, that's like
five full moons in a month. This is the first

time I've actually been there to give them
my thing. . . . I'm usually supposed to
phone in my 'media critic' piece. ... I also
just found out it was a called a 'media critic'
piece. Why am I working for them? It's a
complicated story.
"If you look at the picture on top of the
column, you'll see there's something
strange going on in the lower half of the
picture, and a sort of hysterical cast to the
eyes. That picture was taken in the Hall of
Justice in San Francisco where I had my day
in court for a drunk driving charge. . . .
The full picture shows me in flight from
press photographers.
"The Examiner ran a story about it, God
knows why, and they felt so guilty about it
afterwards that I got this job out of pure
journalistic guilt. I made them use that
same picture so they wouldn't forget."
• President Reagan: "I'm embarrassed. He
used to sell G.E. lamps. Then he sold the
Republican Party to the people. The man
has been the Duke. But John Wayne never
got shot in the lungs. John Wayne had can
cer, but he never got shot in the lungs.
Reagan's a nice guy, but I wouldn't want to
see him after 4 p.m. We just don't have the
same schedules. There's a certain weird
ness of being the only 129-year-old presi
dent."
• The 1988 presidential election: "Well, Mr.
Lightbulb won't be around. Pat Robertson.
George Bush. Jack Kemp." (One audience
member shouts, "Hunter S. Thompson for
president.") "Ted Kennedy. Gary Hart."
But from a majority of the voices in the
auditorium, Rambo was the consensus.
"So, Rambo swept at Stanford,"
Thompson mused. "Something for Herb
Caen."
• What the '80s have to offer in terms of
new sensual highs: "Very complex. There
are always new sensual highs. I'm not sure
I should sit up here and give that to you for
free. Flogging." (He lets his cigarette ashes
drop on his shirt.) "So, now we have flog
ging and Rambo."


"Vicious Nazi drunkard appeared 200 feet tall in the night
sky screaming gibberish at the world: 'Woodstock über
alles'" was Thompson's description of Vegas nightlife.

lose control over any events that might
happen to you. You just have to sit back and
deal with things.
"Anything can happen. . . speaking from
experience. If you're going to strangle your
wife when you're on acid, well then, maybe
you're going to strangle your wife. Maybe
you're going to cry all night. ... I like to do
acid about twice a year just to blow the

tubes out, to keep in touch, you know."
• The Grateful Dead: "Great friends of
mine. . . . They're the most human and ba
sically elegant band around. Of course,
they've been around for a long time. ... If
you're going to do something for 20 years,
it'll be better than if you've just done it for
20 days."
• Drinking games: "I'm appalled to come to
Stanford and find that drinking games are so
important. Don't you have anything better
to do? (Author) Ken Kesey came from
here, so you have a somewhat honored
tradition to keep up with. Of course,
there's also the evil Hoover Institution act
ing against you. Are drinking games dan
gerous? Are games dangerous? Maybe
Dungeons and Dragons."
• Carl Lazlo, Oscar, the Buffalo: "The
character in the movie 'American Buffalo,'
that lousy movie that Bill Murray

made. ... I hate it even though I've never
seen it. . . . It was supposed to make me a
lot of money, and it never did. . . . That
character was based on my real-life attor
ney, Oscar. What happened to him? How do
you talk about something like that? He was
killed . . . shot in the stomach. I never
missed anyone so much. It's strange, to
never hear his screech of tires in the morn
ing. ... He was a serious piece of work.
It's hard to find somebody who has the en
ergy Oscar had."
• The re-emergence of former President
Nixon as an arbitrator between baseball
umpires and owners: "Nixon can't drink.
That's his problem. Nixon is really one of
my favorite people . . . it's a pleasure to
see an old twisted friend around. . . . But
imagine — I mean, would anyone in this
room be able to negotiate a settlement be
tween umpires and owners? It takes a mind

wallowing in the alleys of half-ambitious
greed. . . . He's a perfect expression of
our culture."
• Expectations for students today: "Very
little, frankly. This is a generation when all
students seem to seek a job with E.F. Hut
ton. It's a generation of commercially ori
ented swine. Somebody has to say
something."
• The Duke character in "Doonesbury":
"You want to grow up to be a fireman, you
want to grow up to be president, but no one
wants to grow up to be a cartoon character.
The only thing I have to say about
(Doonesbury creator) Garry Trudeau . . .
(is) I feel sorry for his parents. . . . It's a
shame he doesn't do better work."
• Working for the San Francisco Examiner:
"I've made five deadlines so far, that's like
five full moons in a month. This is the first

time I've actually been there to give them
my thing. . . . I'm usually supposed to
phone in my 'media critic' piece. ... I also
just found out it was a called a 'media critic'
piece. Why am I working for them? It's a
complicated story.
"If you look at the picture on top of the
column, you'll see there's something
strange going on in the lower half of the
picture, and a sort of hysterical cast to the
eyes. That picture was taken in the Hall of
Justice in San Francisco where I had my day
in court for a drunk driving charge. . . .
The full picture shows me in flight from
press photographers.
"The Examiner ran a story about it, God
knows why, and they felt so guilty about it
afterwards that I got this job out of pure
journalistic guilt. I made them use that
same picture so they wouldn't forget."
• President Reagan: "I'm embarrassed. He
used to sell G.E. lamps. Then he sold the
Republican Party to the people. The man
has been the Duke. But John Wayne never
got shot in the lungs. John Wayne had can
cer, but he never got shot in the lungs.
Reagan's a nice guy, but I wouldn't want to
see him after 4 p.m. We just don't have the
same schedules. There's a certain weird
ness of being the only 129-year-old presi
dent."
• The 1988 presidential election: "Well, Mr.
Lightbulb won't be around. Pat Robertson.
George Bush. Jack Kemp." (One audience
member shouts, "Hunter S. Thompson for
president.") "Ted Kennedy. Gary Hart."
But from a majority of the voices in the
auditorium, Rambo was the consensus.
"So, Rambo swept at Stanford,"
Thompson mused. "Something for Herb
Caen."
• What the '80s have to offer in terms of
new sensual highs: "Very complex. There
are always new sensual highs. I'm not sure
I should sit up here and give that to you for
free. Flogging." (He lets his cigarette ashes
drop on his shirt.) "So, now we have flog
ging and Rambo."


"Vicious Nazi drunkard appeared 200 feet tall in the night
sky screaming gibberish at the world: 'Woodstock über
alles'" was Thompson's description of Vegas nightlife.

Kym Boyman/Daily
"The great yuppie kingdom" was his comment on Stan
ford. After having his cigarette lit by a member of the au
dience, though, he called them a "thoughtful" crowd.
He wore sunglasses.
He shuffled around the stage.
And he mumbled into the
microphone.
Only Hunter S. Thompson would
light up a joint thrown to him from
his audience.
The crowd flowed out the doors
and onto the stage at Kresge
Auditorium last night as Thompson
walked in a half hour late.
He immediately began searching
for a real glass to hold his requested
Chivas.
"Stanford, the great yuppie
kingdom . . . and we have plastic
cups?" Thompson said.
Asst. Geology Prof. David Larue
introduced Thompson as the first
speaker in the ASSU Speakers
Bureau series on "Politics and the
Media." Thompson, a freelance
writer, is best known for the crea
tion of what he terms "Gonzo" jour
nalism, a stream-of-consciousness
writing style that has earned him a
cult reputation among college stu
dents. His works include "Fear and

Loathing in Las Vegas," "The
Great White Shark Hunt" and, most
recently, "The Curse of Lono."
Thompson spent most of the
time fielding questions from the au
dience. Sometimes he answered
them directly, but most often he
used them as a springboard for
ramblings about his life, his work
and his political views.
The audience gave Thompson an
enthusiastic reception, despite the
wait. One student bounded up on
the stage, flame in hand, ready to
light the author's cigarette, which
was already mounted in a filter.
"This is a thoughtful audience,"
Thompson said.
Perhaps not thoughtful enough,
however. The football Thompson
tossed around when he walked on
stage was stolen at the end of the
night.
Thompson's books are usually
remembered for the first-hand, ex
plicit hallucinogenic encounters.
Many of the questions asked last
night of Thompson concerned these
experiences.


Lisa Blackaller/Daily
"It was just after Barstow on the edge of the desert when the
drugs began to take hold." So began the book which catapulted
"Gonzo journalism," the brainchild of Hunter S. Thompson, to
national attention. He spoke of this and other arcane subjects to
a packed Kresge Auditorium last night.
"Heroin? It's a bad drug," Thompson
mumbled.
When asked his opinion about first lady
Nancy Reagan's anti-drug campaign,
Thompson called it a lot of propaganda.
"She's a silly little bitch," he said. After a
loud response from the crowd, Thompson
added, "I'm sure if she had the chance, she
would say something worse about me.
"Of course I'm not here to do drugs, un
less someone in the front row has any," he
said.
Thompson spoke first about AIDS, in
response to a suggestion from the audience
that the drinking glass handed up to him
might be contaminated with the disease.
"How is AIDS going to affect your life?" he
asked the audience, and then suggested it
might "eliminate the possibility of having
sex. . . . The whole AIDS thing is just a
scare, a political tool. It's not going to affect
my behavior."
Other Thompson ramblings:
• LSD: "A lot of people say any acid is too
much, but that's not true. How many
people in the audience have used acid?
(About 50 people raised their hands.) How
many people enjoyed it? (Roughly the same
amount raised their hands.) I'm not an
abuser of acid ... but I'm a believer in it.
"Let's dispense with this party dilettante
shit like cocaine. There's no mistake when
you do good acid. ... It makes you . . .
lose control over any events that might
happen to you. You just have to sit back and
deal with things.
"Anything can happen. . . speaking from

wife when you're on acid, well then, maybe

"If you look at the picture on top of the
column, you'll see there's something
strange going on in the lower half of the
picture, and a sort of hysterical cast to the
eyes. That picture was taken in the Hall of
Justice in San Francisco where I had my day
in court for a drunk driving charge. . . .
The full picture shows me in flight from
press photographers.
"The Examiner ran a story about it, God
knows why, and they felt so guilty about it
afterwards that I got this job out of pure
journalistic guilt. I made them use that
same picture so they wouldn't forget."
• President Reagan: "I'm embarrassed. He
used to sell G.E. lamps. Then he sold the
Republican Party to the people. The man
has been the Duke. But John Wayne never
got shot in the lungs. John Wayne had can
cer, but he never got shot in the lungs.
Reagan's a nice guy, but I wouldn't want to
see him after 4 p.m. We just don't have the
same schedules. There's a certain weird
ness of being the only 129-year-old presi
dent."
• The 1988 presidential election: "Well, Mr.
Lightbulb won't be around. Pat Robertson.
George Bush. Jack Kemp." (One audience
member shouts, "Hunter S. Thompson for
president.") "Ted Kennedy. Gary Hart."
But from a majority of the voices in the
auditorium, Rambo was the consensus.
"So, Rambo swept at Stanford,"
Thompson mused. "Something for Herb
Caen."
• What the '80s have to offer in terms of
new sensual highs: "Very complex. There
are always new sensual highs. I'm not sure
I should sit up here and give that to you for
free. Flogging." (He lets his cigarette ashes
drop on his shirt.) "So, now we have flog
ging and Rambo."


"Vicious Nazi drunkard appeared 200 feet tall in the night
sky screaming gibberish at the world: 'Woodstock über
alles'" was Thompson's description of Vegas nightlife.

"The great yuppie kingdom" was his comment on Stan
ford. After having his cigarette lit by a member of the au
dience, though, he called them a "thoughtful" crowd.
He wore sunglasses.
He shuffled around the stage.
And he mumbled into the
microphone.
Only Hunter S. Thompson would
light up a joint thrown to him from
his audience.
The crowd flowed out the doors
and onto the stage at Kresge
Auditorium last night as Thompson
walked in a half hour late.
He immediately began searching
for a real glass to hold his requested
Chivas.
"Stanford, the great yuppie
kingdom . . . and we have plastic
cups?" Thompson said.
Asst. Geology Prof. David Larue
introduced Thompson as the first
speaker in the ASSU Speakers
Bureau series on "Politics and the
Media." Thompson, a freelance
writer, is best known for the crea
tion of what he terms "Gonzo" jour
nalism, a stream-of-consciousness
writing style that has earned him a
cult reputation among college stu
dents. His works include "Fear and

Loathing in Las Vegas," "The
Great White Shark Hunt" and, most
recently, "The Curse of Lono."
Thompson spent most of the
time fielding questions from the au
dience. Sometimes he answered
them directly, but most often he
used them as a springboard for
ramblings about his life, his work
and his political views.
The audience gave Thompson an
enthusiastic reception, despite the
wait. One student bounded up on
the stage, flame in hand, ready to
light the author's cigarette, which
was already mounted in a filter.
"This is a thoughtful audience,"
Thompson said.
Perhaps not thoughtful enough,
however. The football Thompson
tossed around when he walked on
stage was stolen at the end of the
night.
Thompson's books are usually
remembered for the first-hand, ex
plicit hallucinogenic encounters.
Many of the questions asked last
night of Thompson concerned these
experiences.

"It was just after Barstow on the edge of the desert when the
drugs began to take hold." So began the book which catapulted
"Gonzo journalism," the brainchild of Hunter S. Thompson, to
national attention. He spoke of this and other arcane subjects to
a packed Kresge Auditorium last night.
"Heroin? It's a bad drug," Thompson
mumbled.
When asked his opinion about first lady
Nancy Reagan's anti-drug campaign,
Thompson called it a lot of propaganda.
"She's a silly little bitch," he said. After a
loud response from the crowd, Thompson
added, "I'm sure if she had the chance, she
would say something worse about me.
"Of course I'm not here to do drugs, un
less someone in the front row has any," he
said.
Thompson spoke first about AIDS, in
response to a suggestion from the audience
that the drinking glass handed up to him
might be contaminated with the disease.
"How is AIDS going to affect your life?" he
asked the audience, and then suggested it
might "eliminate the possibility of having
sex. . . . The whole AIDS thing is just a
scare, a political tool. It's not going to affect
my behavior."
Other Thompson ramblings:
• LSD: "A lot of people say any acid is too
much, but that's not true. How many
people in the audience have used acid?
(About 50 people raised their hands.) How
many people enjoyed it? (Roughly the same
amount raised their hands.) I'm not an
abuser of acid ... but I'm a believer in it.
"Let's dispense with this party dilettante
shit like cocaine. There's no mistake when
you do good acid. ... It makes you . . .
lose control over any events that might
happen to you. You just have to sit back and
deal with things.
"Anything can happen. . . speaking from
experience. If you're going to strangle your
wife when you're on acid, well then, maybe
you're going to strangle your wife. Maybe
you're going to cry all night. ... I like to do
acid about twice a year just to blow the

tubes out, to keep in touch, you know."
• The Grateful Dead: "Great friends of
mine. . . . They're the most human and ba
sically elegant band around. Of course,
they've been around for a long time. ... If
you're going to do something for 20 years,
it'll be better than if you've just done it for
20 days."
• Drinking games: "I'm appalled to come to
Stanford and find that drinking games are so
important. Don't you have anything better
to do? (Author) Ken Kesey came from
here, so you have a somewhat honored
tradition to keep up with. Of course,
there's also the evil Hoover Institution act
ing against you. Are drinking games dan
gerous? Are games dangerous? Maybe
Dungeons and Dragons."
• Carl Lazlo, Oscar, the Buffalo: "The
character in the movie 'American Buffalo,'
that lousy movie that Bill Murray

made. ... I hate it even though I've never
seen it. . . . It was supposed to make me a
lot of money, and it never did. . . . That
character was based on my real-life attor
ney, Oscar. What happened to him? How do
you talk about something like that? He was
killed . . . shot in the stomach. I never
missed anyone so much. It's strange, to
never hear his screech of tires in the morn
ing. ... He was a serious piece of work.
It's hard to find somebody who has the en
ergy Oscar had."
• The re-emergence of former President
Nixon as an arbitrator between baseball
umpires and owners: "Nixon can't drink.
That's his problem. Nixon is really one of
my favorite people . . . it's a pleasure to
see an old twisted friend around. . . . But
imagine — I mean, would anyone in this
room be able to negotiate a settlement be
tween umpires and owners? It takes a mind

wallowing in the alleys of half-ambitious
greed. . . . He's a perfect expression of
our culture."
• Expectations for students today: "Very
little, frankly. This is a generation when all
students seem to seek a job with E.F. Hut
ton. It's a generation of commercially ori
ented swine. Somebody has to say
something."
• The Duke character in "Doonesbury":
"You want to grow up to be a fireman, you
want to grow up to be president, but no one
wants to grow up to be a cartoon character.
The only thing I have to say about
(Doonesbury creator) Garry Trudeau . . .
(is) I feel sorry for his parents. . . . It's a
shame he doesn't do better work."
• Working for the San Francisco Examiner:
"I've made five deadlines so far, that's like
five full moons in a month. This is the first

time I've actually been there to give them
my thing. . . . I'm usually supposed to
phone in my 'media critic' piece. ... I also
just found out it was a called a 'media critic'
piece. Why am I working for them? It's a
complicated story.
"If you look at the picture on top of the
column, you'll see there's something
strange going on in the lower half of the
picture, and a sort of hysterical cast to the
eyes. That picture was taken in the Hall of
Justice in San Francisco where I had my day

has been the Duke. But John Wayne never
got shot in the lungs. John Wayne had can

dent."
