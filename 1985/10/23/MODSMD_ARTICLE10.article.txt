## Divestment Book Inaccurate

As students of Africa, we are
pleased that the University has
sought to provide important back
ground information for campus dis
cussions of South Africa through
the publication of the pamphlet,
"Stanford and South Africa." At the
same time, we are puzzled by the
numerous errors and confusions in
that pamphlet, which we fear will
detour — rather than inform —
debate within our community. We
are also puzzled by the process by
which this pamphlet was drafted.
The editors, as far as we have been
able to determine, did not draw on
the extensive expertise on South
Africa among the Stanford faculty.

VIEWPOINT

We note below several of the im
portant errors and confusions in the
section entitled "A Brief History of
South Africa and Apartheid," in the
hope that the University will
promptly issue a revised version of
this document. For correct infor
mation, we rely upon the corpus of
established scholarship on South
Africa, especially the respected
"Oxford History of South Africa,"
published in the early 70s. We shall
leave it to others to comment on
the other sections of the pamphlet.
The historical overview begins
with references to "Hottentots"
and "Bushmen," terms that careful
scholarship has shown to be mis
leading and offensive in the contem
porary situation. Earlier commenta
tors confused language groups,
physical types and patterns of eco
nomic activity which did not neatly
coincide. The accepted terms for
the ethnic groups are Khoikhoi and
San, though we guess what was in
tended in the book is a reference to
non-Bantu-speaking herders and
hunters.
The pamphlet claims that Bantu
speaking peoples came to southern
Africa during the 16th and 17th cen
turies. However, archaeological,
linguistic and other evidence shows
that the earliest Bantu-speakers
arrived in what is now South Africa
at least 1,000 years earlier than
those dates.
The contemporary importance of
these errors is that they reflect the
official South African view of the
world: an early South Africa
sparsely populated by primitive in
nocents into which arrived, simulta
neously, Bantu-speakers from the
north and European settlers from
the south. This view of history is
simply wrong. It is clear that the
Europeans who arrived in 1652
found a South Africa with a diverse
native population.
A second common misconception
about South Africa that is sugges
ted in the pamphlet concerns the
origins and durability of Afrikaaner
unity. The pamphlet again reflects
South Africa's official view of the
world: a relatively unified white
population — utough with impor
tant tensions between English- and
Afrikaans-speakers — and a very
divided black population. This offi
cial understanding provides the un
derpinning of the plan to partition

South Africa into one state for
whites and 10 or more states for
everyone else.
In fact, however, conflict within
the white population and among
those now called Afrikaaners has
been bitter since the settlers' arri
val. Hence, it is a serious mis
representation to characterize
Afrikaaners as the "descendants of
the original Dutch settlers," as the
book states. The terms "Boer" and
"Afrikaaner" refer to people whose
unity was initially defined more by
opposition to British settlers and
rule than by common descent.
Other immigrant groups have
also become Afrikaaners over the
past 100 years. During their migra
tion northward from the Cape,
Afrikaaners created not the two
republics noted in the pamphlet, but
at least four or five times that many
mini-states. Of those, eight claimed
self-government in 1860. Alliances
among them were difficult to estab
lish and impossible to maintain.
Only when the British imperial
army became the common enemy
could some degree of unity be
forged. Thus, in contemporary
South Africa, "Afrikaaner" is an
identity more rooted in common in
terest and politics than in lineage
and, over the past 250 years,
Afrikaaners have been no more
united than Africans.
Third, it is particularly misleading
to assert that "Asians and coloreds
have gradually been granted limited
participation in South African politi
cal life" in recent years. In fact, the
legal recognition of black political
participation was in some ways
more extensive in the early part of
this century than it is now. For ex
ample, coloreds had voting rights in
the Cape of Good Hope. And after
the black males' voting rights in the
Cape had been removed, the na
tional parliament included white
representatives for the natives.
Both of these privileges were
eliminated in the years following the
National Party electoral victory in
1948.
Fourth, it is misleading to sug
gest that the Transkei — the first
black homeland — "became inde
pendent in 1976." Not only has no
state other than South Africa
recognized the "independence" of
the Transkei, as the pamphlet
notes, but, equally important, the
Transkei has never had autonomy,
self-government or serious political
or economic independence. This
misleading language recurs in the
"Definitions" section of the
pamphlet, where it is reported in
correctly that three, rather than
four, of the homelands have been
assigned this status. The 1959
legislation established eight
homelands, not 10 as the pamphlet
indicates.
All students of South Africa
agree that 1960 was a major turning
point in the form and organization of
black resistance. The killings that
took place at Sharpeville that year
are commemorated annually as a
symbol of the transition from
passive resistance to resistance
that includes armed struggle. Why
was this historically important mo

ment omitted from the list of
"periods of major protest activity"?
There is another very puzzling
omission from the "Brief History":
the impact of mineral exploitation in
the last third of the 19th century.
The commercial exploitation of
diamonds and gold affected every
one in South Africa. Coercive labor
recruitment strategies, including
both importing foreign workers and
restricting the residence and travel
of local workers, were intensified.
Local economies were disrupted.
Having earlier relied primarily on
diplomatic alliances, modest police
forces and control over trade,
transport and communications to
protect their interests, the British
turned to massive military force,
scorched earth and concentration
camps. The foundations for indus
trialization and for nationalized
capitalism were laid. Without atten
tion to what some have called the
"mineral revolution," the policies of
apartheid and the conflicts of con
temporary South Africa make little
sense.
Finally, we are puzzled by this
section's concluding comment that
"since 1981, South Africa has con
ducted military operations in neigh
boring countries." South Africa's
regional military operations are not
new escalations in the '80s, but, in
fact, have a much longer history.
That history extends from the time
of South Africa's direct involvement
in defending the rule of white set
tlers in Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia)
by Portugese troops assigned to
guard the Cabora Bassa dam in
what was then Mozambique.
Equally disturbing is the pamphlet's
assertion that military operations
outside South Africa's borders
were conducted "to combat [anti-
South African guerrilla] groups." In
fact, South Africa's armed interven
tion in neighboring countries
preceded armed opposition to
apartheid. And the efforts of South
Africans to secure political rights in
their own country are hardly "anti-
South African."
As we noted at the outset, we
are writing to correct some of the
errors and confusions in the Uni
versity's pamphlet on South Africa
and to urge that it be promptly
revised. Such a revision might in
clude participation by the Stanford
community. As it stands, the
pamphlet reflects poorly on scholar
ship at Stanford — host of a widely
respected National Resource Cen
ter on Africa. The pamphlet itself is
likely to become the focus of
debate, thus distracting attention
from the important issues that
ought to command our attention.
