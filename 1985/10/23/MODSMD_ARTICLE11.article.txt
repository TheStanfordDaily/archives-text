# Pursue True Freedom

"Freedom."
That's what the people on my hallway yelled back at
me yesterday after I read the newspaper, became
completely frustrated with this world's ways of solving
problems and in a heated moment yelled at the top of
my lungs, "What's so good about America anyway?"
Don't worry, this isn't another political column about
the politically oppressed in remote areas of the world.
You hear enough about that on this page without me
rehashing it. Instead, I would like to discuss freedom in
general, freedom as a concept, freedom as something
America claims to have. I question whether we are
really so free. I question whether we use the idea of
political freedom as something to lean on — as a crutch
that keeps us from pursuing complete freedom.

On a run through the foothills the other day, I asked
my friend for an example of freedom. She said that run
ning through the hills was a freedom and that many
people in other countries would never be allowed to do
it. But many people here don't run through the foot
hills, either. They could if they wanted to, but some
thing keeps them from it. Some idea or belief holds
them back just as well as any fence ever could.
The absence of freedom is slavery. There are many
types of slavery, not just political slavery. People will
often be slaves to ideas or propaganda more willingly
than they will be political slaves. Yet both kinds of
slavery restrict people's behavior, their choices and
their lives.
Below my apartment lives a 250-pound nurse. It
would be great for her to exercise. She is free to run
through the Stanford foothills if she wants, but she may
not be free to want that. It seems that somewhere
along the line a silent slave catcher crept into her head
and kept her from wanting to move her body in that
way.
Political slavery is an overt form of social control.
Psychological slavery is covert social control. Political
freedom opens the door and lets in many influences
which can steal our freedom of thought. These in
fluences exercise social control by eliminating our
desires for what is truly inside us.
While political slavery keeps us from acting, psycho

logical slavery keeps us from wanting to act. For this
reason, it is harder to discover, attack and destroy.
Silent slave catchers are all around us. Our surround
ings, our parents, our friends — all have a huge influ
ence upon the path we choose in life. It is almost
impossible to be completely objective. We may be
politically free, but we must fight for our psychological
freedom, too. The lack of either freedom can severely
limit our choices and subsequent behavior.
I'm reminded of something another friend once
wrote. It was about the time he walked into the batlv
room to urinate. In front of him were several stalls-.
The choice of stalls got him thinking how great it was
to be able to choose at all — how great it was to be
free. But in the midst of pondering these virtues of free
choice he did not choose, and wet his pants.
His point was that freedom is only as good as we
make it. If we claim to have freedom but do not exer
cise it, we might as well not have it at all. Many of us ifl
America cheer the virtues of freedom, yet never truly
make a free choice. The idea of political freedom is
enough to appease us, enough to relax us so we can
sleep and never wake to action.
I am not trying t,p say that political freedom and psy?
chological freedom are the same thing. There is a dif
ference between the Polish boy standing in line for ra
tions and the 250-pound woman downstairs who can't
choose to run. But I am wondering where political
freedom ends and psychological freedom begins;
Aren't we all a little bit brainwashed by our heritage?
No person or institution is completely psychologi
cally free. It happens to the best of us. We often
criticize Stanford for attempting to steal our psycholog
ical freedom. This is a mistaken accusation. Overall,
Stanford encourages us to question and make our own
decisions — from choosing majors to choosing whether
to drink in our dorm rooms. I applaud Stanford for this.
Nor am I criticizing America. Psychological freedom
depends on the individual breaking his own determinis
tic shackles. Everywhere there will be influences that
try to make us listen to them instead of to ourselves.
These influences are strong in America. But it is up to
each person to listen to him or herself. It is not up to
someone else to remove the influences.
Too many of us are slaves to advertisers, politicians,
parents, professors and pocketbooks. We need them
for guidance, but should never let them make a single
decision for us. Too many of us call ourselves free be
cause we live in a country that is politically free. Too
few of us have the courage to question the basic as
sumptions of our lifestyles.
