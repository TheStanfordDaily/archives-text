## 'Stanford' Spicoli Digs Those Mutual Funds 
### KEN SAWYER CHRIS LOUGHRIDGE 
How does Jeff "Stanford" Spicoli
finance his cool Buds and tasty
waves? He puts his money in high
yielding mutual funds. With an initial
investment of anywhere from $1 to
$1,000-(- (it depends on which
mutual fund you choose), you could
earn an annual return of as much as
28.2 percent. "Hey bud, let's
party."
A stock mutual fund is an invest
ment company that buys shares in a
number of companies. It pools the
money of a large number of people,
and basically it gives each person a
little bit of each of the shares it
owns. The people who have given
money to participate in this fund are
not investing in the stock market di
rectly. Instead, they have the
managers of a mutual fund do it for
them.
Almost 4 million people invest
their money this way, and for a
number of good reasons:
1. The "You take care of it" rea
son. Few people, especially college
students, have either the time or
the inclination to learn about
stocks.
2. The "Wow, I own some of all
this stuff' reason. With just a little
bit of money, you can own a lot of

stocks (albeit indirectly). Many
mutual funds own shares in such
big-time companies such as IBM,
Xerox, Exxon and General Motors.
3. The "Hey Bud, let's party"
reason. In Consumer Report's "A
Guide to Mutual Funds," the 10
best-performing funds provided an
annual return of between 20 and 28
percent over the past five years.
Even the average fund (of the 289
rated) returned 9.6 percent per
year.
4. The "Don't got much money"
reason. Many mutual funds require
little or no minimum investment.
5. The "Cheaper when you buy a

keg" reason. If you buy beers by
yourself, you're likely to pay 50
cents each. However, if you buy a
whole keg, you can have a beer for
around 30 cents. The same works
for stocks.
There are four basic types of
mutual funds, all geared for differ
ent types of investors. "Income
funds" invest in a flexible mixture of
bonds and stocks that pay high
dividends. These are probably the
safest type of mutual fund. "Growth
funds" are capital-appreciation
oriented and invest in those com
panies whose stock price is ex
pected to appreciate. "Growth and

income funds" incorporate and bal
ance the goals of the preceding two
funds. "Specialized funds" do just
that â€” they specialize. Their
specializations range from industrial
sectors to regions like the Pacific
Basin to not investing in companies
doing business in South Africa. The
one type of mutual fund to avoid is
the "maximum-capital-gains fund"
which aims for the highest possible
capital gains. Often these funds
make highly speculative invest
ments or borrow money in an at
tempt to magnify investment
results. These funds are consis
tently the poorest performers.

One thing to watch for when
choosing a mutual fund is whether
or not it has a "load." Some funds
charge buyers a sales charge or
load. An 8.5 percent load (the maxi
mum allowable) will make a sizeable
dent on the amount initially in
vested. If you were to invest $100
in a fund with a full load, you would
be earning the return on $91.50.
So if you're interested in mutual
funds and are looking for something
to do with that small stash of cash
under your mattress, there are still
a couple of things to keep in mind.
Mutual funds that have done well
over the past five or 10 years will
undoubtedly do pretty well in the
future. Some funds have done very
well in one particular year but not
so well in the long run. Take the
Hartwell Leverage Fund. It yielded
a 93 percent return in 1980, but its
five-year average (according to
Consumer Reports) was a negative
0.7 percent.
Another important thing to be
aware of is the fund's managers.
While a fund may have done well for
the last five years under one partic
ular manager, if the manager
changes, the fund might not per
form as well. We recommend you
write to any fund you are consider
ing and request a prospectus (it will
contain the names of current and
former managers).
