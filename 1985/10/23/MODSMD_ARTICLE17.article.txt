## Pigs, Dogs, Rabbits Join the Farm 
### TED TASCH 
Animals ranging from ducks to
pigs to dogs moved onto the Farm
July when the Stanford Medical
Center opened its new $11 million
Research Animal Facility (RAF).
"Stanford now has a state-of-the
art laboratory facility we can all be
proud of," said Thomas Hamm,
veterinarian and director of the cen
ter's Division of Animal and Labora
tory Medicine. "The building's

tional areas of the
Medical Center.

features will enable us to achieve
the highest standards of research
more easily, while ensuring that our
animals will receive the best care
attainable from our staff of profes
sionals and technicians."
Hamm and the animals are joined
by a staff of more than 30 people,
including two other veterinarians.
Hamm, 42, came to Stanford
from North Carolina, where he
headed the department of general
biochemical toxicology at the
Chemical Institute of Toxicology in
Research Triangle Park. The
veterinarian also has a Ph.D. in
comparative pathology.
"Fortunately, most of what is
good for research is also good for
the well-being of the animals," said
Hamm. "You can't accomplish care
ful, competent research on highly
stressed animals."
The facility was approved by the
University Board of Trustees
nearly three years ago to augment

the quality of biomedical research
and the care of animals.
Specific features were incor
porated into the 32,000-square-foot
structure to ensure optimal condi
tions for animal care. A filtration
system that changes the air in the
building up to 27 times an hour was
installed. This rate is noteworthy
because it exceeds the 10 to 15
hourly changes recommended by
the National Institutes of Health.
Ventilation shafts extending 40
feet into the air mark the lab site
underneath the parking lot of the
Medical Center. Air temperature
can be precisely controlled room

by-room to ensure that the ther
mometer conforms to an individual
species' needs.
Water is filtered to benefit the
health of the animal and to ensure
that no foreign substance drifts into
the patient's quarters. Sensor
devices link with a central monitor
that issues a warning to personnel
when air quality deviates from the
norm.
Steam cleaning equipment to
sterilize cages and containers used
in animal care is located within the
building.
The underground RAF building is

connected by tunnels to other re
search and instructional areas of the
Medical Center, providing efficient
access for the majority of research
ers.
"The location enhances our abil
ity to control the environment for
such variables as light and tempera
ture, which can have physiological
effects on the animal under investi
gation," said Hamm. Another rea
son for locating the facility under
ground was to preserve parking
space, according to Hamm.
"Some people think that since we
are situated underground, we have

something to hide," said Hamm.
"That's why I am willing to give a
tour to anyone who wants one.
People who don't have the slightest
concept of what we are doing
decide that what we are doing is
wrong. I can't comprehend respon
sible people thinking like that.
"Again, it's a [fact] that an
animal exposed to the proper light
and temperature is going to be
healthier than an animal facing con
ditions which are either too hot or
too cold, too light or too dark."
While most of the actual research
will be conducted in laboratories
outside the building, the new RAF

includes two operating suites and
an intensive care facility rivaling
most human care facilities, accord
ing to Hamm.
The facility has been designed to
house a continuously varied array of
animals. Animals which initially
moved into the facility include about
21 cats, 13 dogs, 18 ducks, 15
geese, 70 guinea pigs and 301 rab
bits, not to mention the rodents.
About 95 percent of the 45,000
animals at Stanford are rodents,
most of which live in the RAF.

. . . the new RAF
includes two oper
ating suites and an
intensive care
facility rivaling
most human care
facilities.

Large rodent colonies, some con
taining 15,000 or more rodents, will
continue to be located in various de
partments until a second research
animal facility is completed in
several years. That project is under
active consideration and would be
built partially in conjuction with the
Center for Molecular and Genetic
Medicine, a basic research en
deavor expected to open its own
building in 1988.
Even though the RAF opened
recently, it has already received na
tional recognition. The National In
stitute of Aging told a Stanford re
search team led by Dr. Gerald
Reaven that it would qualify for
federal funding only if a proposed
rat colony was housed in the new
facility. An unusually clean atmos
phere free of disease was needed
for a study on aging.
The rat study is part of a project

entitled the "Endocrinology of
Aging" which has been funded by
the NIA for the past six years.
In the first six years of the proj
ect, the Stanford team has learned
that such signs of old age as lack of
glucose tolerance are not inevi
table. These symptoms directly
relate to obesity and lack of exer
cise, lifestyle factors which can be
corrected.
Now the team wants to test
other endocrine functions. They
want to learn at what point in the
life cycle corrective intervention is
possible.
Research involving the employ
ment of surgery is greatly
facilitated by the new operating and
intensive care units.
Several larger animals, including
sheep, are being used to develop a
partial artificial heart called a left
ventricular assist device. Primates
and dogs are involved in a variety of
organ transplant projects.
Much of the research remains
non-surgical. Most of the rabbits
and rodents in the facility are used
to produce monoclonal and
polyclonal antibodies for molecular
biological research.
Hamm sees a movement in
future biomedical research to
validate whether the new biochemi
cal procedures developed in the
test tube and in tissue cultures
work in the whole animal.
"We have to evaluate whether in

formation obtained on the molecular
and cellular levels can be applied to
the level of the organism," said
Hamm.
"Animal research done humanely
can be justified," said Hamm. "If we
lost the opportunity to do animal re
search, then the future treatments
for the human and animal popula
tions just wouldn't be there."
All animal research projects are
reviewed by a 10-member panel
that includes Hamm, other scien

tists, community'members and an
outside veterinarian. The panel
meets once a month.
The new animal facility was ap
proved in December 1982, and was
projected to cost between $10 and
$12 million.
S. Corbin Smith, a University
project manager, said the cost
(including design, planning and
financing) was $11 million with ac
tual construction costs of $7.3 mil
lion.

ditions which are either too hot or
too cold, too light or too dark."
While most of the actual research
will be conducted in laboratories
outside the building, the new RAF

includes two operating suites and
an intensive care facility rivaling
most human care facilities, accord
ing to Hamm.
The facility has been designed to
house a continuously varied array of
animals. Animals which initially
moved into the facility include about
21 cats, 13 dogs, 18 ducks, 15
geese, 70 guinea pigs and 301 rab
bits, not to mention the rodents.
About 95 percent of the 45,000
animals at Stanford are rodents,
most of which live in the RAF.

. . . the new RAF
includes two oper
ating suites and an
intensive care
facility rivaling
most human care
facilities.

Large rodent colonies, some con
taining 15,000 or more rodents, will
continue to be located in various de
partments until a second research
animal facility is completed in
several years. That project is under
active consideration and would be
built partially in conjuction with the
Center for Molecular and Genetic
Medicine, a basic research en
deavor expected to open its own
building in 1988.
Even though the RAF opened
recently, it has already received na
tional recognition. The National In
stitute of Aging told a Stanford re
search team led by Dr. Gerald
Reaven that it would qualify for
federal funding only if a proposed
rat colony was housed in the new
facility. An unusually clean atmos
phere free of disease was needed
for a study on aging.
The rat study is part of a project

entitled the "Endocrinology of
Aging" which has been funded by
the NIA for the past six years.
In the first six years of the proj
ect, the Stanford team has learned
that such signs of old age as lack of
glucose tolerance are not inevi
table. These symptoms directly
relate to obesity and lack of exer
cise, lifestyle factors which can be
corrected.
Now the team wants to test
other endocrine functions. They
want to learn at what point in the
life cycle corrective intervention is
possible.
Research involving the employ
ment of surgery is greatly
facilitated by the new operating and
intensive care units.
Several larger animals, including
sheep, are being used to develop a
partial artificial heart called a left
ventricular assist device. Primates
and dogs are involved in a variety of
organ transplant projects.
Much of the research remains
non-surgical. Most of the rabbits
and rodents in the facility are used
to produce monoclonal and
polyclonal antibodies for molecular
biological research.
Hamm sees a movement in
future biomedical research to
validate whether the new biochemi
cal procedures developed in the
test tube and in tissue cultures
work in the whole animal.
"We have to evaluate whether in

formation obtained on the molecular
and cellular levels can be applied to
the level of the organism," said
Hamm.
"Animal research done humanely
can be justified," said Hamm. "If we
lost the opportunity to do animal re
search, then the future treatments
for the human and animal popula
tions just wouldn't be there."
All animal research projects are
reviewed by a 10-member panel
that includes Hamm, other scien

tists, community'members and an
outside veterinarian. The panel
meets once a month.
The new animal facility was ap
proved in December 1982, and was
projected to cost between $10 and
$12 million.
S. Corbin Smith, a University
project manager, said the cost
(including design, planning and
financing) was $11 million with ac
tual construction costs of $7.3 mil
lion.

Animals ranging from ducks to
pigs to dogs moved onto the Farm
July when the Stanford Medical
Center opened its new $11 million
Research Animal Facility (RAF).
"Stanford now has a state-of-the
art laboratory facility we can all be
proud of," said Thomas Hamm,
veterinarian and director of the cen
ter's Division of Animal and Labora
tory Medicine. "The building's

tional areas of the
Medical Center.

features will enable us to achieve
the highest standards of research
more easily, while ensuring that our
animals will receive the best care
attainable from our staff of profes
sionals and technicians."
Hamm and the animals are joined
by a staff of more than 30 people,
including two other veterinarians.
Hamm, 42, came to Stanford
from North Carolina, where he
headed the department of general
biochemical toxicology at the
Chemical Institute of Toxicology in
Research Triangle Park. The
veterinarian also has a Ph.D. in
comparative pathology.
"Fortunately, most of what is
good for research is also good for
the well-being of the animals," said
Hamm. "You can't accomplish care
ful, competent research on highly
stressed animals."
The facility was approved by the
University Board of Trustees
nearly three years ago to augment

the quality of biomedical research
and the care of animals.
Specific features were incor
porated into the 32,000-square-foot
structure to ensure optimal condi
tions for animal care. A filtration
system that changes the air in the
building up to 27 times an hour was
installed. This rate is noteworthy
because it exceeds the 10 to 15
hourly changes recommended by
the National Institutes of Health.
Ventilation shafts extending 40
feet into the air mark the lab site
underneath the parking lot of the
Medical Center. Air temperature
can be precisely controlled room

by-room to ensure that the ther
mometer conforms to an individual
species' needs.
Water is filtered to benefit the
health of the animal and to ensure
that no foreign substance drifts into
the patient's quarters. Sensor
devices link with a central monitor
that issues a warning to personnel
when air quality deviates from the
norm.
Steam cleaning equipment to
sterilize cages and containers used
in animal care is located within the
building.
The underground RAF building is

connected by tunnels to other re
search and instructional areas of the
Medical Center, providing efficient
access for the majority of research
ers.
"The location enhances our abil
ity to control the environment for
such variables as light and tempera
ture, which can have physiological
effects on the animal under investi
gation," said Hamm. Another rea
son for locating the facility under
ground was to preserve parking
space, according to Hamm.
"Some people think that since we
are situated underground, we have

something to hide," said Hamm.
"That's why I am willing to give a
tour to anyone who wants one.
People who don't have the slightest
concept of what we are doing
decide that what we are doing is
wrong. I can't comprehend respon
sible people thinking like that.
"Again, it's a [fact] that an
animal exposed to the proper light
and temperature is going to be
healthier than an animal facing con
ditions which are either too hot or
too cold, too light or too dark."
