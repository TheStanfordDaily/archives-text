# More Coffee House Funding Vetoed
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
During a special closed session, the ASSU
Senate last night approved by unanimous voice
vote a bill directing that "no additional (ASSU)
funds be used to cover the liabilites" of the now
defunct Coffee House, Inc.
In addition, the senate approved the Coffee
House, Inc. Board's plan to repay all Coffee
House back taxes and debts owed to vendors
and employees. '
The ASSU, according to Senate Chair Carey
White, has already agreed to bear $30,000 of the
Coffee House, Inc. debt of approximately
$43,000, a figure incurred largely during the
1982 United Stanford Workers strike. The Cof

fee House, Inc. Board must pay anything over
$30,000.
The meeting was marked by a heated ex
change between White and Eric Diesel, trea
surer of the Stanford Coalition Against Apartheid
(SCAA), after Diesel refused to leave the room
when the senate went into closed session.
Diesel's move was in protest of an earlier sen
ate vote denying SCAA funding beyond the
$1,401 in annual funding it received from the
Program Board last spring.
Diesel requested $5,200 for SCAA during
open forum, stating that the money was needed
to fund "one of the best speakers series in the
history of Stanford."
Diesel told the senate that SCAA needed
$1,960 to host Dennis Brutus, a prominent
South African poet, and Randall Robinson, presi

dent of Trans-Africa, an organization devoted to
African issues.
Brutus will speak this Saturday at Cubberley
Auditorium, Diesel said.
The senate voted twice during the evening to
deny funding to SCAA, once on an amendment
proposed by Senator Joel Bellenson asking for
$2,599 in funding and later on Senator David
Porter's request of $799, a figure recommended
by the Program Board.
The Appropriations Committee recommended
that SCAA receive no additional funds.
Diesel made a last-ditch plea at the end of the
meeting to get funding, stating that he would be
"willing to never apply for ASSU funding again" if
SCAA was given additional funds.
