# New Images for Stanford From NMR

Next week, if your watch stops or your credit card's
magnetic code is scrambled, it may be because you
have visited Stanford's new Magnetic Resonance Sys
tems Research Laboratory. The laboratory is sched
uled to open Monday, according to Albert Macovski,
professor in the Electrical Engineering and Radiology
departments and director of the MRSRL project.
The project, which hopes to develop new techniques
in the use of nuclear magnetic resonance for medical
imaging purposes, was built with a $2.5 million equip
ment grant from General Electric. According to
Macovski, the project will focus on research into the
use of NMR for detecting blood vessel disease, tumors
and some chemical imbalances, such as Alzheimer's
disease.
In medical nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, a
patient is placed in an extremely strong magnetic field,
up to 30,000 times as strong as that of the earth. Un
der the influence of this field, different atomic nuclei in
the patient vibrate, or resonate. This generates
changes in radio energy which can be picked up,
amplified and decoded by an elaborate system of com
puters.
A very important part of the Stanford project is the
use of new computer imaging techniques to create
pictures from raw data. Previous efforts at NMR im
aging were often unsuccessful because the time
needed to produce an image was as much as five
minutes. In rapidly moving parts of the body, such as

the heart and lungs, this meant that images were fuzzy
and inaccurate.
"Right now, people are having to sequence through
dimensions one at a time. With a new time-varying
gradient technique, we will be able to do them all simul
taneously," said Macovski. These new technologies
may allow imaging times as short as five seconds, al
lowing much better resolution of blood vessels and
other areas of interest.
This is important, since, according to Macovski,
"Present systems of imaging blood vessels, looking for
things like arteriosclerosis, are very invasive and very
painful. They are only used when symptoms occur,
rather than being used as preventive medicine if a pa
tient is at high risk."
Since the signals produced by the body in this tech
nique are simply radio waves, NMR radiation is no
more dangerous than what might be produced by a
home stereo. Any potential dangers in the technique lie
primarily with the super-cooled magnet, which
produces an intense field.
The very strong magnetic fields used in the project
may scramble information stored on magnetic credit
card strips, and some watches may stop while in the
field, according to Macovski. Patients cannot have any
steel implants, since torques, rotational forces
generated by the field, could wrench them out of place,
causing injury.
To provide some protection from these effects,
lockers for wallets and watches will be supplied. In ad
dition, the Press Courtyard rooms housing the project
were built primarily of non-ferrous materials.
