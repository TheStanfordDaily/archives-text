## Stanford Soccer Lassoes Santa Clara Broncos 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
SANTA CLARA — Cardinal skill, experience and
composure won out over Bronco youth, hustle and
physical play last night as the Stanford men's soccer
team routed host Santa Clara 4-0.
Stanford ran its Pacific Soccer Conference record to
4-1 by scoring two goals in each half under the lights of
Buck Shaw Stadium.
Cardinal seniors Angel Vazquez, Tom Rafalovich,
Dave Daniels and Rob West knew how to be in the
right place at the right time and frustrated the largely
freshman Santa Clara squad, now 5-10-1 overall and 0-
5 in the PSC, with one goal apiece.
But it took the seniors a while to figure out the hec
tic pace that the Santa Clara team set in the opening
minutes of the game. The Broncos came out of the
gate swarming. The only problem was that they
weren't always going for the ball.
"They weren't trying for the ball — they were trying
to cut us down with rough tackles," Vazquez said.
"They wanted to intimidate us early, but it didn't work."
It sure didn't. The Stanford team kept its cool and
gradually began to fire away at the Santa Clara net.
And 28 minutes into the half, Vazquez struck.
Stanford's leading scorer waded his way through
three defenders and chipped the ball toward the
Bronco goal. Goaltender Todd Neel misjudged it, and
the ball fell in the far corner of the net for the first
Cardinal goal.
"That ball was just a cross that had a strong, weird
spin on it," Vazquez admitted. "Their goalie just
froze."
Nevertheless, Stanford led 1-0 and Vazquez wasn't
done yet. Ten minutes later, he stole the ball in the up
per left corner of the Santa Clara penalty area and
passed to Cardinal midfielder Rafalovich across the
area.

Rafalovich picked the ball right out of the air with his
right foot and shot it to the left of Neel for Stanford's
second score.
The first half ended with the Cardinal leading in all
statistical categories but one: fouls. Stanford out-shot
the Broncos 6-1, and Cardinal goalie Tom Austin did
not have to make a save while Neel made three. Santa
Clara committed 13 fouls to Stanford's eight.
Fouling, however, rarely puts balls in the net; good
passing often does.
Cardinal senior Giancarlo Ferruzzi delivered one of
those good passes 13 minutes into the second half.
Ferruzzi had the ball 40 yards out with plenty of room
in front of him. Then he saw Daniels on his right.
Daniels had even more room to work with, so Fer
ruzzi threaded a pass to him, and Daniels had a
breakaway. The Bronco goaltender came out and
blocked Daniels' first shot, but Daniels calmly drove
the rebound into the net for his second goal of the
season.
Stanford had a comfortable 3-0 lead but just kept
coming. With 24 minutes remaining in the game, Vaz
quez, West and freshman Luke Garrott combined for
yet another goal. . . but it was called back.
On the attack, Vazquez passed to West on the wing.
West crossed the ball to Garrott and in the process fell
down. The Bronco goalie also fell down. And so did a
Santa Clara defender. Garrott barely remained stand
ing and trickled the ball between all the fallen bodies
and into the goal.
"No goal!" the referee yelled. He said that West was
offsides on the play, so the goal didn't count.
But West was not tp be denied last night. Just two
minutes later he anticipated a Bronco pass and inter
cepted it near midfield. Only 45 yards of grass lay be
tween him and the Santa Clara goalie.
The senior from Northridge let Neel charge and then
slipped the ball under him and into the goal.

The Cardinal men's soccer team might be headed for the NCAA playoffs if it can continue its win
ning ways. It has posted four consecutive victories.
While all this scoring was going
on, the Cardinal defense was turn
ing in its now usual stellar perfor
mance. The quietly strong group,
led by goalie Tom Austin, sweeper
back Phil Horvath and fullbacks
Todd Rafalovich and Neal Step
hens, recorded its ninth shutout
of the year.
The team has allowed only 12
goals in 17 games, and has a tight
average of 0.67 goals allowed per
game.
The victory was the fourth in a
row for Stanford. The Cardinal now
has a 9-6-2 record overall, and a 4-1
record in the PSC.
Stanford returns home Saturday
for an 11 a.m. non-conference
game against Cal State
Sacramento.
