# Owners Rethink Drug Policy
## 
### 
ST. LOUIS (AP) — Baseball
club owners voted unanimously
yesterday to end the one-year-old
agreement with the players union
•;over anti-drug enforcement and
testing.
At the same time, the owners,
in a statement issued at the World
Series, said they "reaffirmed
'. their dedication to the elimination
of the drug problem in baseball."
According to the statement,
the decision came after Barry
Rona, chief counsel for the Player
Relations Committee, told the
owners that the PRC had been
"unable to make any substantial
progress in reaching a drug
testing agreement" with the
players union.
Under such conditions, the
owners decided that the current

drug agreement, which does not
include mandatory testing, "could
not work."
"It is extremely unfortunate for
all baseball that we were unable
to reach a testing agreement with
the association," Rona said.
Commissioner Peter Ueber
roth declined to comment on the
action and said he would not dis
cuss the drug issue until after the
World Series.
Baseball's current drug plan
was negotiated by the players
union and PRC Director Lee Mac-
Phail. It provides for counseling,
anti-drug education and under
certain circumstances amnesty
for players who come forward and
acknowledge a drug problem.
But there are also provisions
for penalties against players who

fall outside the guidelines, gener
ally those who are repeat drug of
fenders.
Gene Orza, general counsel for
the major league players organi
zation, had no immediate com
ment last night when informed of
the owners' decision.
Earlier this year, amid increas
ing reports of drug use by ball
players, Ueberroth announced a
mandatory testing plan for every
one in baseball except major
league players.
He said that because the drug
agreement had been negotiated
as part of baseball's basic contract
with major-league players, he
could not order that group to take
tests. But he said then, and has
repeated many times since, that
he hoped the union would agree
to testing.
