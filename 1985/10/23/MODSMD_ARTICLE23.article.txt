# Buckley's Back at QB
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
Yesterday, for the first time all
season, backup quarterback Fred
Buckley was soaked with sweat
after a Stanford football practice.
"It feels great," he said, pushing
his damp black hair off his forehead
and grinning. "I had a lot of fun in
there today. My arm felt good, and
we got the game plan for Arizona
today. ..."
He laughed. "I sound like a little
kid, don't I?"
He sounded like a man whose
sport had just gotten a whole lot
more interesting to him. With start
ing quarterback John Paye ap
parently sidelined with a separated
shoulder (Coach Jack Elway listed
Paye as "very, very doubtful" for
the Arizona game), Buckley is the

scheduled signal-caller for Satur

Wildcats.
Yesterday's practice was his first

ment to find out what I do well or

what. I felt really good about how I
did today."
So unless Paye makes a
miraculous recovery, Buckley is
right back where he was last year at
this time â€” on the hot seat. Last
October, he replaced an injured
Paye in the season's fourth game
and quarterbacked the Cardinal for
all but four quarters of the
remainder of the season.
He met with mixed reviews. In
his first start, he directed Stanford
to its biggest win of the season, a
23-21 upset of defending Rose
Bowl champion UCLA, and he was
15-of-24 in the 28-21 win over
Oregon State.
But he threw 17 interceptions in
just 166 attempts, and his comple
tion percentage was a woeful .488.
