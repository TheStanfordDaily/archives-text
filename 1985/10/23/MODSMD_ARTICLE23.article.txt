# Buckley's Back at QB
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
Yesterday, for the first time all
season, backup quarterback Fred
Buckley was soaked with sweat
after a Stanford football practice.
"It feels great," he said, pushing
his damp black hair off his forehead
and grinning. "I had a lot of fun in
there today. My arm felt good, and
we got the game plan for Arizona
today. ..."
He laughed. "I sound like a little
kid, don't I?"
He sounded like a man whose
sport had just gotten a whole lot
more interesting to him. With start
ing quarterback John Paye ap
parently sidelined with a separated
shoulder (Coach Jack Elway listed
Paye as "very, very doubtful" for
the Arizona game), Buckley is the

scheduled signal-caller for Satur
day's matchup with the 5-1
Wildcats.
Yesterday's practice was his first
of the season with the starting of
fense, and he was tested on the
greater part of Elway's thick

playbook. From all appearances, he
passed.
"We ran a lot more stuff than
usual today," Buckley said. "I don't
know if (Elway's) trying to experi
ment to find out what I do well or

what. I felt really good about how I
did today."
So unless Paye makes a
miraculous recovery, Buckley is
right back where he was last year at
this time â€” on the hot seat. Last
October, he replaced an injured
Paye in the season's fourth game
and quarterbacked the Cardinal for
all but four quarters of the
remainder of the season.
He met with mixed reviews. In
his first start, he directed Stanford
to its biggest win of the season, a
23-21 upset of defending Rose
Bowl champion UCLA, and he was
15-of-24 in the 28-21 win over
Oregon State.
But he threw 17 interceptions in
just 166 attempts, and his comple
tion percentage was a woeful .488.
"Fred has had a tendency to
force the ball," Elway said Monday.
"If it isn't there, he'll go with it in
stead of holding it or throwing it out
of bounds. But lately, he has im
proved in that area."

Buckley agreed. "Last year I
tried to make too much happen," he
said. "I guess that's the stuff you'd
expect from a rookie quarterback. I
said, 'Christ, this is my shot,' and I
tried to make the big play too often.
"I'm much more mature now.
The big difference this year is that
I've been in there before, and I

know what it's like. When I was get
ting in there last year I had literally
played five downs of college football
in my career.
"I'm a year older and wiser. I'll
be comfortable a lot quicker this
year."
His first opponent won't make it
easy to get comfortable. Arizona is
leading the Pacific 10 Conference
race, thanks largely to its young,
quick defense. In six games, the
Wildcats have picked off 15 passes
and allowed an average of nine
points a game.
In last year's game with Arizona,
a 28-14 loss in Tempe, Buckley was
21-of-39 for 200 yards but threw
three interceptions. When asked
what he would be looking for
against the Wildcats this year, he
said, 'Ways to score. We've got to
get the offense rolling."
Then he stopped and shook his
head. "Nine points (per game) and
15 interceptions? That's excep
tional."
But it's Buckley's first start of
the season. If last year is any indi
cation, it's his time to be excep
tional.
Card notes
In Monday's press conference,
Elway said, "Buckley will be the
the lead (for the Arizona game),
with the possibility that we will go
with two quarterbacks."
That second quarterback, third
string redshirt freshman Greg En
nis, did see action with the first
string on Monday. But yesterday,
when specific preparations for the
Wildcats began, it was all Buckley.
One interesting offensive twist
that Elway dusted off yesterday
was a three-back offense, to be
used as another possible way to
give his quarterback more time.
