# Royals Take Game Three of Series, 6-1
## 
### 
ST. LOUIS (AP) — Frank White,
acting like the cleanup hitter he isn't
supposed to be, hit a two-run
homer and doubled in another run
last night as the Kansas City Royals
bounced back from two straight
losses and beat the St. Louis Car
dinals 6-1 in Game 3 of the World
Series.
Bret Saberhagen, the 21-year
old ace of Kansas City's pitching

staff, struck out eight and allowed
only six singles to stop the Car
dinals' juggernaut and prevent the
Royals from falling into a double
jeopardy situation in the best-of
seven Series. It was the first com
plete game of this Series.
George Brett tied a Series
record by reaching base five
straight times in one game, on two
singles and three walks, and Lonnie

Smith had a two-run double as the
Royals ended an offensive drought
that had seen them score just three
runs in the first two games. K.C.
had 11 hits and also benefitted from
eight walks by Cardinal pitchers.
The Royals scored their first two
runs off Cardinals right-hander Joa
quin Andujar in the fourth inning on
Smith's hit. White, the Royals'
second baseman, ended yet an

other futile day's work for Andujar
when he hit the two-run homer in
the fifth. His run-scoring double
came in a two-run seventh.
White's homer was the first of
this World Series. It also was the
first in World Series play for White,
pressed into duty as a cleanup hit
ter after the absence of a desig
nated hitter here had relegated Hal
Mcßae to the bench.
The Royals, who had blown
Game 2 Sunday night after taking a
2-0 lead into the ninth, already had
lost the first two games of the Se
ries at home. It had happened only
nine previous times in the World
Series, and none of those teams
had gone on to win. But the future
would have looked even dimmer
had the Royals fallen to 0-3, a defi
cit from which 16 previous teams
have failed to recover.
Game 4 of the Series sends
Kansas City left-hander Bud Black,
10-15, against the ace of the Car
dinals' staff, left-hander John
Tudor, 21-8 and the winner of
Game 1.
Saberhagen had pitched rather
poorly in two American League
playoff starts, working a total of
only seven-and-one-third innings
with an earned run average of 6.14.
And he hurt his pitching hand in
Game 7 when it was hit by a line
drive. But this masterful youngster
returned to full form against the
Cardinals in his first World Series
start.
Saberhagen retired the last 11
batters after getting 10 in a row
from the second to the fifth.
After struggling a little in the first
two innings, Saberhagen asserted
himself. He didn't allow a run until
the Cardinals put together three
straight singles with one out in the
sixth. Jack Clark drove in the run.
Although he established himself
as the ace of the Kansas City staff

this year, Saberhagen declined to
call himself the hero.
"I think all of our starters feel
that way," he said. "There's no dif
ference in all five of us. That's what
got us here."
In his first major league at-bat,
Saberhagen sliced a pitch from Joa
quin Andujar down the right field
line that was barely foul.
"I haven't hit in three or four
years, so I'm a little apprehensive,"
Saberhagen said.
Center fielder Willie Wilson
chipped in with two hits, as did
Brett, White, left fielder Lonnie

Smith and shortstop Buddy Bian
calana.
"I think it's good that a lot of guys
made a contribution tonight," Wil
son said. "That's the sort of thing
that can get a ballclub moving. It's
not always that way when it's just
one or two people getting it down."
Many Cardinal fans were openly
predicting a four-game sweep after
the first two victories in Kansas
City, but the Royals did not feel
they were in danger of being swept,
Wilson said.

George Brett, who singled twice and walked three times last night, paced an 11 -hit Royal attack
that helped starter Bret Saberhagen defeat St.Louis last night.
