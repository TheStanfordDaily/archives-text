### 
REDWOOD CITY (AP) — Coach Bill Walsh, preoc
cupied with the losing ways of his San Francisco 49ers,
has given barely a thought to the seemingly sluggish
running of the Los Angeles Rams' Eric Dickerson in
recent weeks.
"I don't know the reason," Walsh said yesterday.
"But I do know he's a great back and that he'll be there
Sunday. And he'll consider this his big game, because
we've had pretty good success against him in the
past."
Walsh added, "It is a very important game, and I'm
sure the Rams are eagerly awaiting it."
The Rams are 7-0, one of two unbeaten teams in the
National Football League, going into Sunday's soldout
game at Anaheim Stadium. The 49ers, defending
Super Bowl champions, are 3-4 after losing three of
their last four games.
Walsh described the 49ers as "just mesmerized . . .
searching to find out what has happened to us.
"It's just hard to believe a team which has accom
plished what this team has doesn't have confidence."
Dickerson broke O.J. Simpson's NFL single-season
record by rushing for 2,105 yards last season. But in
two games against the 49ers, he was held to 136 yards
on 39 carries, well under four yards per attempt.
The Rams' star missed all of training camp and the

first two games of this season because of a contract
holdout, then returned to action with a 150-yard rush
ing performance against Seattle the third week of play.
But since then, Dickerson has gained only 224 yards on
83 carries, an average of 2.7 yards an attempt. He
ranks 12th among National Football Conference rush
ers, with 374 yards.
The Los Angeles offense ranks 13th, next to last, in
the NFC in total yardage, but the Rams' defense is No.
2. The 49ers are fourth on offense, fifth defensively.
But takeaways and turnovers, rather than yardage
gained and allowed, are the telling statistics in the NFC
West, according to Walsh. With another victory Sun
day, the Rams would have a five-game lead over the
49ers with eight games left.
"The Rams have taken advantage of every break.
They have a great defensive team and have made a lot
of interceptions, and they haven't made many mistakes
themselves," he said.
Los Angeles has taken the ball from opponents 29
times on interceptions (18) and fumble recoveries (11)
while losing it only 15 times. The 49ers' offense has
committed 16 turnovers, and the defense has just 12
takeaways, seven fumble recoveries and five intercep
tions. The Rams have been penalized 41 times, San
Francisco 57 times.
