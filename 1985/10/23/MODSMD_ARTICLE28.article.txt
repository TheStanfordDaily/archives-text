# Hoops Scrimmage
## 
### 
The fortunes of the Stanford
football team have gone down in
recent weeks â€” all the way
down into the dumps. Not
surprisingly, the spirits of local
sports fans have followed.
Just when those spirits are
bottoming out, however, the
basketball team will try to come
to the rescue.
This Saturday, Tom Davis will
showcase the talents of a squad
that promises to be both exciting
and unpredictable. Stanford will
stage the "Cardinal/White
Scrimmage" in Maples Pavilion
immediately after the football
game. The squad, which is ex
pected to play for 40 minutes,

invites any and all patrons to at
tend free of charge.
Nothing against Brad Muster
et al., but the basketball exhibi
tion just might up-stage Satur
day's action on the gridiron. The
game offers an interesting blend
of experience and youth.
The White team will feature
seniors Kieth Ramee and Andy
Fischer, junior Novian Whitsitt,
sophomore Greg Butler and
freshman Howard Wright. The
Cardinal team counters with
Brown and senior Earl Kober
lein, sophomore Eric Reveno
and freshmen Terry Taylor and
Todd Lichti.
