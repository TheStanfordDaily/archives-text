Chinese Nuclear Trade Probed
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administration has received
reliable intelligence reports that China suggested in June it might
provide Iran with sensitive nuclear technology after Peking signed a
30-year atomic power agreement with the United States, according
to well-placed sources in the U. S. intelligence community.
These reports from Peking were shared in a closed briefing of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier this month at the insis
tence of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) Along with other intelligence
reports about Peking's continuing nuclear exports to Argentina and
South Africa, the disclosure about Iran subsequently triggered an al
legation Monday by Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) that the Reagan
Administration has "systematically withheld, suppressed and cov
ered up information known virtually throughout the executive
branch" about Chinese violations of nonproliferation guarantees.
Cranston's charges that the Chinese shared nuclear technology
with what he termed five "nuclear outlaw" nations — Brazil, Argen
tina, Pakistan, South Africa and Iran — are the latest hitch in the
U.S.-China nuclear agreement signed by President Reagan in April
1984. The pact would allow U. S. nuclear contractors to supply reac
tor components and other technology to Peking.
Because of widespread criticism, however, the agreement was
not submitted to Congress until last July while the Administration
sought additional Chinese nonproliferation assurances. Unless
rejected by Congress, the pact automatically takes effect in January.
The Administration defended the nuclear agreement yesterday as
Vice President Bush, just returned from a six-day trip to China, said,
"We wouldn't enter into any agreement that would cause an increase
in the proliferation of nuclear weapons."
Liberia Election Fraud Possible
MONROVIA, Liberia — Evidence is mounting here that the
Liberian government of Samuel Kanyon Doe is engineering a
massive election fraud in order to remain in power in this West
African nation.
Last Tuesday, approximately one-third of Liberia's 2.1 million
population spent hours standing in the heat of the day to cast their
ballots in what was billed as the first truly free election in Liberia's
138-year history.
Now, over a week later, many Liberians are expressing a mixture
of anger and frustration at continuing charges that Doe's supporters
are involved in skulduggery apparently aimed at extending his rule;
An element of suspense has also entered into the political picture
here — not so much over the official outcome of the election but
over how the Liberian electorate will respond to a result that so
many of them feel has been clumsily and obviously rigged.
There is also a growing feeling of suspense about how the U.S.
government will react when the results are announced. The United
States pressured Doe heavily to hold the election in the first place.
More Die in S. Africa Rioting
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Rioting flared outside major
cities yesterday with up to eight blacks reported killed, and a white
South African minister said he and five other churchmen want to talk
with the African National Congress, the main guerrilla organization
trying to overthrow the government.
President P.W. Botha warned that a meeting would "amount to a
challenge of the state's authority."
Security police reportedly arrested a leader of the United Demo
cratic Front, the main multiracial organization opposed to white
minority rule. Colleagues of Trevor Manuel, a member of the front's
national executive who is of mixed-race ancestry, said he was
detained under a security law that allows police to deny the victim a
trial.
"They just walked straight up to him, handcuffed him and took him
away," said Veronica Simmers, an office worker for the front who
said she saw Manuel being detained in the group's Cape Town
offices.
The Cape Argus newspaper reported 150 arson attacks, many in
volving gasoline bombs, on homes and cars in 24 hours ending yes
terday afternoon.
Reagan To Speak at UN Today
WASHINGTON — President Reagan goes to the United Nations
today to open a campaign designed to win allies for his approach to
the upcoming summit meeting with Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev
in Geneva.
The centerpiece for this initial effort will be the speech Reagan will
deliver to the UN General Assembly tomorrow. "This speech will
mark the beginning of a rather intensive campaign to get our hopes
and views about the Geneva meeting out clearly on the record," said
one White House official. "We want to get our priorities clearly in the
public mind."
Reagan's talk will come a couple of weeks after Gorbachev made
his major bid for hearts and minds, touring Western Europe and
proposing, among other things, that the United States and the Soviet
Union each reduce the number of their nuclear weapons by 50 per
cent.
When asked whether Reagan would counter with an offer of his
own tomorrow, White House officials would not deny it. "You'll have
to wait and see," one of them said.
Israeli Right Reacts to Peres
JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres' proposals
for U.N.-initiated peace talks with Jordan and Palestinian representa
tives by the end of the year triggered sharp reactions by hard-line
members of the Likud faction of his government yesterday, threat
ening a coalition showdown.
The Likud ministers, led by Trade Minister Ariel Sharon and Dep
uty Prime Minister David Levy, charged that in his speech before the
U.N. General Assembly Monday, Peres had deviated from the coali
tion agreement upon which the bipartisan "national unity" govern
ment was formed a year ago.
The agreement bound both partners in the coalition to seek peace
in conformity with the 1979 Camp David accords, outside of an inter
national forum.
Both ministers, along with others in the Likud faction, demanded
that Peres clarify his statements when he returns Saturday night.
The issue is certain to come to a head when the Cabinet meets on
Sunday.
The contention focused mainly on Peres' suggestion that Middle
East peace talks could be initiated with the support of the permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council whose countries have
diplomatic relations with Israel. At present, that would exclude the
Soviet Union and China.
