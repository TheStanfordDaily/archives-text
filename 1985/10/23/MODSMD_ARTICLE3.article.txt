# Police Captain Defends Action

The actions of Stanford police officers
at an Oct. 11 anti-apartheid sit-in were
consistent with "what they are trained to
do" but revealed flaws in the training
methods themselves, Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said yesterday.
"I think we really have to evaluate the
training methods," Niemeyer said. "I
don't think they were very successful or
very effectual."
Niemeyer told a Murray House audi
ence of 25 last night that arresting officers
followed procedures taught at a seminar
last summer detailing methods of remov
ing protesters who resist arrest. The pro
cedures, based on techniques established

by the FBI and the California Highway Pa
trol, include the use of wrist locks and
compliance-pain holds, Niemeyer said.
A compliance-pain hold was used on
senior Robby Perkins, one of nine stu
dents arrested after refusing to leave Old
Union at the 5 p.m. closing time,
Niemeyer said. He explained the hold by
saying, "If you comply, there's no pain."
After his arrest, Perkins ignored
repeated warnings to comply with police
requests and told officers he "would not
use his muscles," Niemeyer said.
Perkins has accused police officers of
using unnecessary force during his arrest.
He has also charged that he was stripped
and beaten during detainment at the
North County Jail by Santa Clara County
sheriff s officers.

Niemeyer said officers knew the tech
niques could be painful and recognized
"winces" of pain on the faces of those who
resisted arrest. "We didn't want to hurt
anybody," Niemeyer said. "We were just
doing a job that had to be done."
According to Niemeyer, officers specif
ically told Perkins that the hold would not
be necessary if he complied.
"When we got to the (arrest center),
we begged him," Niemeyer said. "We
said, 'Sir, please stand up. You're hurting
yourself.' "
Police were also caught off guard by the
actions of the protesters, Niemeyer said.
"We were basically surprised that indi
viduals decided to sit in, " Niemeyer said.

police did what they had to do to get the protesters out, but he conceded that
there may be flaws in the training program.
