# Police Captain Defends Action
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
The actions of Stanford police officers
at an Oct. 11 anti-apartheid sit-in were
consistent with "what they are trained to
do" but revealed flaws in the training
methods themselves, Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said yesterday.
"I think we really have to evaluate the
training methods," Niemeyer said. "I
don't think they were very successful or
very effectual."
Niemeyer told a Murray House audi
ence of 25 last night that arresting officers
followed procedures taught at a seminar
last summer detailing methods of remov
ing protesters who resist arrest. The pro
cedures, based on techniques established

by the FBI and the California Highway Pa
trol, include the use of wrist locks and
compliance-pain holds, Niemeyer said.
A compliance-pain hold was used on
senior Robby Perkins, one of nine stu
dents arrested after refusing to leave Old
Union at the 5 p.m. closing time,
Niemeyer said. He explained the hold by
saying, "If you comply, there's no pain."
After his arrest, Perkins ignored
repeated warnings to comply with police
requests and told officers he "would not
use his muscles," Niemeyer said.
Perkins has accused police officers of
using unnecessary force during his arrest.
He has also charged that he was stripped
and beaten during detainment at the
North County Jail by Santa Clara County
sheriff s officers.

Niemeyer said officers knew the tech
niques could be painful and recognized
"winces" of pain on the faces of those who
resisted arrest. "We didn't want to hurt
anybody," Niemeyer said. "We were just
doing a job that had to be done."
According to Niemeyer, officers specif
ically told Perkins that the hold would not
be necessary if he complied.
"When we got to the (arrest center),
we begged him," Niemeyer said. "We
said, 'Sir, please stand up. You're hurting
yourself.' "
Police were also caught off guard by the
actions of the protesters, Niemeyer said.
"We were basically surprised that indi
viduals decided to sit in, " Niemeyer said.

protesters would be arrested did he
realize a sit-in was imminent,
Niemeyer said.
This unexpected turn was ex
acerbated by a manpower shortage,
Niemeyer said.
According to Niemeyer, addi
tional officers from the Santa Clara
County Sheriffs Office would nor
mally assist Stanford police in the
transport of arrested protesters
and other duties.
"Nevertheless, we decided we
had to go ahead," Niemeyer said.
"We didn't want to have people sit
ting around for hours while we mus
tered up enough forces to carry out
the action in a correct manner."
The arresting officers were also
not briefed before the action,
Niemeyer said. "We didn't brief the
(officers) prior to the arrest simply
because we didn't feel we had the
time to do it," Niemeyer said.
The Oct. 11 incident has
prompted changes in the arrest and
removal methods used by Stanford
police, Niemeyer said. "We learned
from that first incident," Niemeyer

said. Additional officers were called
to make arrests on Oct. 14 and Oct.
16, he said, and on Oct. 16, those
who refused to cooperate were
handcuffed and rolled onto canvas
slings to be carried out.
Niemeyer defended the integrity
of the Stanford officers, who he said
must pass a careful screening
process that identifies those capa
ble of working in an academic envi
ronment in addition to normal law
enforcement duties.
"We're going to try to do the job
as fairly, as objectively and as
professionally as we can,"
Niemeyer said. "I don't think we
have any (officers) who really enjoy
hurting or harassing people. Above
all, we don't like arresting students
and protesters in this sort of situa
tion, because a lot of us have our
own personal feelings about the
issue."
In addition to being arrested for
trespassing, unlawful assembly,
refusal to disperse from an unlawful
assembly and remaining at the
scene of a riot after refusal to dis
perse, those protesters who did not
cooperate with the police were
charged with resisting arrest.

Union at the 5 p.m. closing time,
Niemeyer said. He explained the hold by
saying, "If you comply, there's no pain."
After his arrest, Perkins ignored
repeated warnings to comply with police
requests and told officers he "would not
use his muscles," Niemeyer said.
Perkins has accused police officers of
using unnecessary force during his arrest.
He has also charged that he was stripped
and beaten during detainment at the
North County Jail by Santa Clara County
sheriff s officers.

Niemeyer said officers knew the tech
niques could be painful and recognized
"winces" of pain on the faces of those who
resisted arrest. "We didn't want to hurt
anybody," Niemeyer said. "We were just
doing a job that had to be done."
According to Niemeyer, officers specif
ically told Perkins that the hold would not
be necessary if he complied.
"When we got to the (arrest center),
we begged him," Niemeyer said. "We
said, 'Sir, please stand up. You're hurting
yourself.' "
Police were also caught off guard by the
actions of the protesters, Niemeyer said.
"We were basically surprised that indi
viduals decided to sit in, " Niemeyer said.
Only after a protest organizer asked if

Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer told a Murray House audience that he thought the
police did what they had to do to get the protesters out, but he conceded that
there may be flaws in the training program.
protesters would be arrested did he
realize a sit-in was imminent,
Niemeyer said.
This unexpected turn was ex
acerbated by a manpower shortage,
Niemeyer said.
According to Niemeyer, addi
tional officers from the Santa Clara
County Sheriffs Office would nor
mally assist Stanford police in the
transport of arrested protesters
and other duties.
"Nevertheless, we decided we
had to go ahead," Niemeyer said.
"We didn't want to have people sit
ting around for hours while we mus
tered up enough forces to carry out
the action in a correct manner."
The arresting officers were also
not briefed before the action,
Niemeyer said. "We didn't brief the
(officers) prior to the arrest simply
because we didn't feel we had the
time to do it," Niemeyer said.
The Oct. 11 incident has
prompted changes in the arrest and
removal methods used by Stanford
police, Niemeyer said. "We learned
from that first incident," Niemeyer

said. Additional officers were called
to make arrests on Oct. 14 and Oct.
16, he said, and on Oct. 16, those
who refused to cooperate were
handcuffed and rolled onto canvas
slings to be carried out.
Niemeyer defended the integrity
of the Stanford officers, who he said
must pass a careful screening
process that identifies those capa
ble of working in an academic envi
ronment in addition to normal law
enforcement duties.
"We're going to try to do the job
as fairly, as objectively and as
professionally as we can,"
Niemeyer said. "I don't think we
have any (officers) who really enjoy
hurting or harassing people. Above
all, we don't like arresting students
and protesters in this sort of situa
tion, because a lot of us have our
own personal feelings about the
issue."
In addition to being arrested for
trespassing, unlawful assembly,
refusal to disperse from an unlawful
assembly and remaining at the
scene of a riot after refusal to dis
perse, those protesters who did not
cooperate with the police were
charged with resisting arrest.
