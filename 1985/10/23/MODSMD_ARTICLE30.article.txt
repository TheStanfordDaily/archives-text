# Weinberger Says Soviets Violate SALT II

### 
WASHINGTON â€” Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger charged yesterday the Soviet Union
has begun deploying a new mobile nuclear
missile in violation of the SALT II accord and
said this provided fresh justification for President
Reagan's "Star Wars" program.
Weinberger confirmed the deployment of the
new SS-25 missile in the course of attacking Ad
ministration critics who believe "that arms con
trol is a more ethically justifiable course of action
than attempting to strengthen deterrence
through defensive weapons."
"Recent history shows that arms control has
hardly been a raving success," Weinberger told a
conference sponsored by the Ethics and Public
Policy Center, a conservative Washington think
tank.
"Today, I can officially confirm that one of
their new ICBMs, the mobile SS-25, is now
being deployed and is an unquestionable violation
of Soviet assurances given to us under the SALT
II accord," he continued.
"The SS-25 is road-mobile and can be housed
in launcher garages equipped with sliding roofs.
This makes it an extremely versatile weapon.
The SS-25 violates the SALT II agreement that

permits development of only new types of
ICBMs. Their first new type developed, the SS-
X-24, is now being tested."
Given the failure of previous arms control
agreements to force a reduction in nuclear weap
ons, "It is, I think, difficult to argue that the only
moral course of action open to the United States
is more of the same," Weinberger added.
"There is nothing moral about a situation in
which the strength of the democratic nations is
slowly eroded. Also quite frankly, I am at a loss
to understand why it is moral to allow the
Soviets to develop a defensive shield while we
sit back and do nothing. And why is it immoral to
research the possibility of creating options for a
safer future, which may lessen the risk of war?"
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, more
popularly known as "Star Wars," involves devel
opment of lasers and other high-technology
weapons that could automatically shoot down nu
clear missiles fired at the United States or its
allies. \
While Reagan is committed to achieving "real,
equitable and verifiable arms reductions in
Geneva," Weinberger said such arms control
negotiations do not justify abandonment of SDL

The existence of the SS-25 and SS-24 missile
programs within the Soviet Union has long been
a matter of public record. It was not until yester
day, however, that senior Pentagon leaders
were willing to state categorically that the Rus
sians had actually begun deploying the former.
Weinberger provided no precise information
on the number of SS-25s the Pentagon believes
have been deployed or their location. He also
failed to say whether there is any evidence the
Soviets are retiring older missiles as they begin
deployment.
But he made it clear the Administration has not
changed its view that the SS-25 is a violation of
the SALT II accords under any circumstances.
Under that 1979 agreement, which both sides
have pledged to heed even though it was never
ratified by the U.S. Senate, the United States
and Soviet Union were authorized to develop
one new intercontinental ballistic missile.
The Soviets maintain their development of the
SS-25 is permissible because it is merely a modi
fication of an older missile, the SS-13. The
United States has flatly rejected that contention,
noting differences in size, range and propellant.
