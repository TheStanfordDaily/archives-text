# U.S. May Negotiate Defensive Arms
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The United
States is prepared to give as
surances to the Soviet Union that it
would negotiate with Moscow any
proposed deployment of new defen
sive strategic weapons, and would
give "five to seven years" notice
before deploying such weapons uni
laterally, according to Defense De
partment sources.
These proposals, agreed to
secretly at an Oct. 4 meeting of
senior Administration officials, are
intended as a response to Soviet

demands for concessions on Presi
dent Reagan's Strategic Defense
Initiative (SDI), the sources said.
They would not have any effect on
continuing research and testing of
possible "Star Wars" weapons, but
would delay the deployment of such
weapons, presumably to give the
Soviets a chance to deploy compa
rable systems if the United States
decided to withdraw from the exist
ing Antiballistic Missile (ABM)
Treaty, which outlaws such deploy
ments.

The proposal agreed to Oct. 4 by
the Special Arms Control Policy
Group of top officials responsible
for arms control policy is to offer to
amend the 1972 ABM treaty, which
currently provides that either su
perpower can withdraw from it on
six months notice. That could be
extended to five to seven years un
der this new U.S. idea.
At a hearing before a House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee yes
terday, Paul Nitze, special adviser
to the president and secretary of

state on arms control, said the SDI
"research program is not on the
table. But with respect to other
aspects of the program, of course
(they are) on the table."
The new proposal for trying to
reassure the Soviets was adopted
as part of the Administration's
review of its position on the SDI in
connection with the ongoing
Geneva negotiations and the up
coming summit between Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev.
