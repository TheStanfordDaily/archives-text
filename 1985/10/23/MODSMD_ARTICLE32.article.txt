Asian Quotas Alleged
WESTMINSTER — Despite the educational
achievements of Asian-Americans, some col
leges and universities may have "unofficial
quotas" to limit their admission, Education
Secretary William Bennett said in a speech
prepared for last night.
Noting data cited by Asian student associa
tions at Ivy League universities over several
years, Bennett said the figures show "a
smaller percentage of Asian-American stu
dents than other applicants are being ac
cepted. "
"These figures might indicate that unofficial
quotas are in effect in some universities limit
ing the number of Asian-American students,"
Bennett said. He also called the data "less than
conclusive." His remarks were in a text
prepared for delivery to a Vietnamese group
last night.
"If, however, concrete evidence of quotas
and anti-Asian discrimination does come to
light, we will take appropriate action to rem
edy the situation," Bennett said. He said "the
proportion of Asian-Americans is extraor
dinarily high" at selective universities.
Asian-American students make up 8 percent
of the students at Harvard University and 10
percent of the freshman class, up from 3 per
cent a decade ago, Bennett said.
In California, Asian-Americans are 22 per
cent of the students at the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley and 21 percent at UCLA, he
said. He added that 39 percent of Asian-
American high school graduates qualify for Cal
ifornia's top state universities, versus an
average of 12.5 percent for students of other
races.
Asian-Americans have a higher percentage
of high school and college graduates than the
overall U.S. population, Bennett said. He also

said Vietnamese refugee children score higher
on standardized math tests and have higher
grade point averages than other students.
Bennett cited close Asian family ties and
sacrifices of parents for their children's educa
tion among the reasons for the Asian-
American educational achievement.
Chrysler Strike Ends
HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. — Chrysler
Corp. and United Auto Workers negotiators
agreed early today on a tentative three-year
contract that would return 70,000 striking
workers to the job, the union said.
The agreement, announced at 3:15 a.m. by
UAW President Owen Bieber and Vice Presi
dent Marc Stepp, ended a bargaining session
that began at 9 a.m. Monday and stretched
more than 42 hours.
"We are extremely proud that the deter
mination and solidarity of our members at
Chrysler has resulted in a tentative contract
that achieves every one of our goals," the
union leaders said in a statement.
The United Auto Workers of Canada ratified
a separate contract with Chrysler on Monday,
and its 10,000 members returned to work later
in the day, ending a strike in that country.
Senate for AIDS Funds
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted yes
terday to more than double the spending in the
fight against AIDS as it approved, 83-15, a
$105 billion spending bill that funds major
federal social programs through next Septem
ber.
The measure includes $221 million for re
search and treatment programs related to the

deadly acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
which destroys the body's ability to fight infec
tions and other illnesses. The House voted
Oct. 2 to spend $190 million on AIDS pro
grams.
Both spending plans, which now must be
reconciled in a joint House-Senate conference
committee, would significantly increase AIDS
spending beyond the $100 million in outlays for
fiscal 1985, which ended Sept. 30.
The low-key Senate debate was free of the
sometimes fiery ideological polemics which ac
companied AIDS funding action in the House,
where a small knot of conservatives, led by
Reps. William Dannemeyer and Robert Dor
nan, both Republicans from California's Or
ange County, launched an attack on
homosexual behavior.
Sen. Lowell Weicker (R-Conn.), floor
manager for the overall spending measure,
promised to press lawmakers to approve even
more AIDS money in the coming months if
doctors and scientists determined it was
needed to combat the rapidly spreading
disease.
Daylight Savings OK'd
WASHINGTON — In the name of boosting
business, leisure and Halloween trick-or
treating, the House voted decisively yesterday
to expand daylight-savings time by four weeks
— three in April and one in October-
November.
The compromise bill, approved 240-157,
faces an uphill struggle in the Senate, where
well-positioned opponents maintain that farm
ers and rural schoolbus riders would suffer
from the increased number of dark mornings.
Under daylight-savings, the sun rises an hour
later than in standard time.
