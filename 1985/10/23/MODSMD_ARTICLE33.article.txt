Navy Reviews Policy
SAN DIEGO — The death of a Navy medi
cal corpsman from AIDS may change the
Navy's policy of discharging homosexuals with
the disease because officials are concerned
that sailors will conceal their condition.
The Navy "is addressing this issue, because
they don't want the stigma of someone who
has AIDS being fearful" about telling
physicians that he may have been exposed to
the disease," said Lt. Gene Eliott, public af
.fairs officer for the Naval Medical Command,
Southwest region.
He said the re-evaluation arose from the case
of Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class Brian Kinney,
who died Monday from AIDS.
The 28-year-old Kinney died four days after
the Navy reversed its decision to discharge
him without medical benefits.
Kinney was diagnosed as having AIDS, or

acquired immune deficiency syndrome, last
October while stationed in Okinawa. He was
flown to San Diego for treatment at Balboa
Naval Hospital.
Kinney wanted a medical discharge from the
Navy that would have entitled him to receive
military disability pay or be cared for at a mili
tary hospital.
Publisher Returns
LOS ANGELES — The publisher of a
Chinese-language newspaper returned yester
day from Taiwan following a brief arrest in her
homeland, and denied her publication had il
legally advocated the reunification of the island
nation with mainland China.
"It makes me feel good to breathe the air of
freedom again," said Lee Ya-ping after step
ping off a China Airlines flight at Los Angeles

International Airport.
The publisher of the Monterey Park-based
International Daily News was arrested during
a business trip on Sept. 17 and held for nine
days by agents of the Taiwan Garrison Com
mand.
She was released from custody following
protests from the U.S. State Department,
Rep. Stephen Solarz (D-N.Y.) and the world
news media.
U.S. officials said the arrest was an attempt
to intimidate people for legal activities they
pursue while living in the United States.
"I want to thank the U.S. government for its
strong supportive attitude during the entire
period (of the arrest)," she said yesterday.
A resident alien of the United States, she
was accused of violating Taiwan's anti-sedition
laws because her newspaper ran articles dis
cussing efforts to reunite her homeland with
mainland China.
