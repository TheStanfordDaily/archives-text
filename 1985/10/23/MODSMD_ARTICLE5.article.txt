# Union Proffers Pension Plan
## Wheeler calls proposal 'discouraging'

Pension proposal concessions
made yesterday by United Stanford
Workers (USW) are "very dis
couraging" to efforts to reach a con
tract settlement, the University's
chief negotiator said last night.
USW's chief negotiator, Mary
Ann Tenuto, countered by saying
the latest USW proposal is "giving
(the University) a sign that we
were willing to make substantial
movement if they were."
USW members are scheduled to
strike Oct. 31 if real progress is not
made toward a new contract.
The union had initially asked for a
4 percent cost-of-living adjustment
to the workers' monthly pension
checks. However, USW withdrew
this demand when it realized that
the University was not flexible on
this issue, Tenuto said.
USW also conceded the right to
calculate pensions based on 1974
salaries rather than 1976 salaries.
The union had originally asked that
the pensions be based on 1980
salaries. Again, Tenuto character
ized the move as a "willingness to
compromise."
Wheeler, however, said the
revised USW package does "not
(show) substantive movement."
"It did not strike me as a signifi
cant move," she said, adding that
"overall, (USW) has an unrealistic
package on the table."
Tenuto said the USW will not
budge on issues of "job security and
USW's ability to fairly represent its
workers."
New restrictions proposed by
the University that would prevent a
worker from talking with a field rep
resentative about a job grievance
during working hours would be a
violation of free speech, USW Chief
Steward Linda Crouse said.

Wheeler, however, said USW's
"accusations" regarding the Uni
versity's proposal concerning union
representatives interacting with
workers on the job are unwar
ranted.
They are "completely a fabrica
tion by (USW) Local 680. . . . The
union has completely blown (it) out
of proportion," she said.
According to Wheeler, the Uni
versity has had past problems with
"confrontational behavior" between
managers and USW members.
The University is requesting that
the union not talk to its workers
during hours "to the extent practi
cal," Wheeler said.
If a meeting is to occur, the Uni
versity asks that the manager be in
formed and that the USW field rep
resentative obey safety rules.
The emphasis is toward avoiding
disruption, she said.
Tenuto said negotiations have
run more smoothly since federal
mediator Maggie Jacobson entered
into the negotiations last week.
"She's able to let us meet more
often. . . . That's very good. The
more you meet, the more you nar
row your issues," she added. The
next meeting will be held tomor
row. â€¢
Wheeler agreed the mediator is a
"very helpful sign . . . (and) a posi
tive step."
In an Oct. 15 strike vote, USW
members gave the bargaining team
the power to continue negotiating
for five days after the original strike
deadline of Oct. 25.
The union decided over the
weekend to delay the deadline to
Oct. 31 after "the federal mediator
said the University was agreeable
to mediation," Tenuto said Monday.
