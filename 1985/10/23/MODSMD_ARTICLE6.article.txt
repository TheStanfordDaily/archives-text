# Scavengers Hunt for Urban 'Riches'
## 
### SMITA SINGH 
Who slides surreptitiously into the St. Francis
Hotel only to grab a handful of matchbooks and
then run? Or takes photographs of friends trying
on fur coats at Saks (behind the salesperson's
back, of course)?
Who has been collecting signatures from San
Francisco prostitutes and stealing menus from
the Hard Rock Cafe? Or attempting handstands
on Lombard Street? Come on, who would be
that self-assured and silly at the same time?
Indeed, a new breed of vandals has descended
upon that city of hills in the past month — Stan
ford freshmen.
This fall, several freshman dorms, including
Gavilan, Madera and Alondra, have arranged
"traditional" freshman scavenger hunts for their
residents.
Alondra held the latest of these excursions
Saturday.
Alondra RA Mike Hawley explained the
motive underlying the event."It gave the fresh
men a chance to take the initiative. The RAs
weren't telling them exactly where to go or what
to find. They could be as serious or as lax about
the scavenger hunt part of it as they wanted," he
said.
As for the rules of the game itself, all the par
ticipating freshmen were divided randomly into
groups of five to seven. Each group then

received a map 01 the City and a list of items to
scavenge.
So, lightly armed, the freshmen hit San Fran
cisco in search of everything from a signed pho
tograph of Mayor Dianne Feinstein to a signature
of a prostitute, a picture of people making out at
Coit Tower to something from the Hard Rock
Cafe.
The items ranged from the mundane — a
BART ticket stub — to the exotic (or erotic) —
a Carol Doda napkin. They ranged from the
nebulous — a fish — to the specific —
chopsticks from the Golden Dragon Restaurant.
And nowhere did freshman audacity and inge
nuity seem to show more than in search of these
"holy grails."
Each group brought its own interpretations to
the hunt. Take, for example, a fish: real fish? toy
fish? picture of a fish? dead fish? live fish? Deci
sions such as these were left up to each group to
decide individually. And so each did.
"Our fish? It was real, headless — and gross,"
said Penny Asroff about her group's find.
Another set bought a package of fish-shaped
candies, while a more literary bunch cut the
word "fish" out of a newspaper.
Even the clear-cut items produced interesting
stories. Jeff Robins and Tom Ragatz tried to get
a nun's signature to use as the required pros
titute's autograph, but she wasn't keen on the
idea.
On the other hand, Michelle Effros' group

scored with a "lady of the night," who happily
signed her name to their fish wrapper (you re
member; the headless, gross one) adding "with
compliments to the fish."
Patti Williams and her group decided to go one
step further and get the signature of the man be
hind the scenes.
"We went to the red light district; it was
scary. And we saw this pimp ... he had the big
hat, fur coat, the works. We were going to get
his autograph, so we were sort of following him,
when he turned around and started walking
toward us. Then we decided we didn't really
want the signature that badly," Williams said.
The search for a Carol Doda napkin landed
Emre Onder and Robert Motoshige in quite a sit
uation as well.
"We were in a real hurry, so we were running
toward Carol Doda's when this man standing out
front shouting, 'Come on in, baby!' spotted us.
He got real excited and started taking us in. I
told him that all we wanted was a napkin and he
just replied, 'Sure, we got anything you want,' "
Motoshige said.
Once inside, Motoshige told the proprietor
that he needed only a napkin. Motoshige then ex
plained to the confused man about the scavenger
hunt and the Carol Doda napkin.
Apparently, Carol Doda's infamous reputation
does not rest on napkins, for they were blank.
