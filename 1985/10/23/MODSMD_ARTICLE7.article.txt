# Coalition Creates 'Connections'
## 
### R. TAEZA PIERCE Editorial staff 
To some of the students who picked it up
earlier this month, The Stanford Connections,
a four-page newspaper with a format not unlike
The Daily, may have sparked some initial con
fusion. But to its creators, The Connections is
a thread with which to tie Stanford together.
A pioneering joint publication by campus
progressive groups, The Connections is the
brainchild of Warren Habib, a member of Stan
ford Out of South Africa (SOSA). At a cost of
$800, 10,000 copies were printed and dis
tributed around the University, he said.
Members of the Black Student Union
(BSU), SOSA and United Stanford Workers
(USW) formed an informal "student labor sup
port committee," Habib said. They sought a
more effective means of reaching students
than the usual deluge of fliers that arrives un
solicited in the hands and under the doors of
nearly every on-campus resident, he said.
Comprised of articles by representatives
from USW, SOSA, the BSU, the Student
Union Committee and Stanford Students
Opposed to Pornography, The Connections

also features the work of Political Science
Prof. John Manley.
According to Habib, the idea of a joint
publication came up over the summer as he
and others started looking for ways to reach
students during the first few weeks of autumn
quarter.
Habib said he felt there must be a way to
link the USW's contract fight with the Student
Union Committee's effort to restore student
ownership of the Coffee House, the BSU's
struggle for an alternative to Western Culture
and SOSA's battle for divestment of University
holdings in corporations that do business in
South Africa.
While approaching members of different
groups about the idea for a newspaper, he said,
the answer emerged. "In each of these issues
it looked to us as if the University was not al
lowing the different groups to have enough of a
voice." The focus for the paper developed into
"the issue of community control," he said.
Habib then began contacting members of all
the progressive groups he could track down,
telling them about the project and asking them
to contribute articles, funding and editorial
staff.
Habib said he was happy with the response,

but noted that only the BSU and SOSA con
tributed money to the effort. The USW joined
those groups in helping with the editing of the
paper, which was printed in South San Fran
cisco.
Sophomore Amanda Kemp, secretary of the
BSU, said her group "saw a definite need for
people to start making connections between all
the different struggles that were going on on
campus. . . . The connection is basically that
we're trying to have some means of control
over the events that shape our lives." Kemp
said the six BSU officers decided unanimously
to get involved with The Connections.
"I think the BSU will probably always be an
organization that will be interested in coalitions
among other Third World groups, as well as
with progressive, predominantly white organi
zations that we can unite with on some level.
It's an effort to draw everybody together."
USW President Dennis Blake expressed
similar motives for the union's involvement
with the newspaper. He said one of the main
issues on the union's agenda was what it saw
as "the corporatization" of the University.
Based on the results of "a polling of various
rank-and-file [union] activists and officers,"
Blake said he committed USW to the project.
