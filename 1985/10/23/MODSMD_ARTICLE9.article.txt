## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Nuclear Decisions 
### 
When Clifford Johnson, a computer specialist at
Information Technology Services, filed suit charging
that U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
and the Department of Defense could violate the
Constitution by allowing computers the chance to in
itiate nuclear war, his case did not receive a great
deal of attention. But now, a year later, Johnson vs.
Weinberger appropriately is becoming big news. In
These Times, the LA Weekly and the Miami Herald
have already begun monitoring the progress of the
suit, and 28 publications affiliated with Knight-
Ridder Newspapers may follow suit.
No one is sure if the United States currently pos
sesses or will implement a launch-on-warning sys
tem, but Johnson charges that such a system —
which would enable computers to initiate nuclear
war if they detect incoming missiles — would violate
the Constitution's provision that only Congress has
the right to declare war.
What may once have seemed a silly, symbolic
crusade against nuclear weapons has become a very
legitimate concern for Johnson and the 9th U.S. Cir
cuit Court of Appeals, which is currently considering
the suit. Further adding to the legitimacy of the
cause, the Western States Legal Foundation has
recently certified the Johnson vs. Weinberger as a

tax-deductible cause.
Johnson's case is much more than symbolic. The
issues he is raising and forcing the court to confront
must be considered if the United States is to main
tain a sensible nuclear policy. What Johnson is con
testing, after all, is not military strength but who —
or what — has control over that strength. Even the
most ardent supporters of a powerful nuclear force
cannot argue that human beings should be removed
from the decision-making process when the fate of
our planet is at stake.
Johnson's case is particularly urgent given the
past propensity of computer equipment to detect
non-existent nuclear attacks. In 1979 alone, there
were 78 incidents of computer failure which indi
cated that enemy missiles were possibly on their
way, according to a 1984 report by two U.S.
senators. In June 1980, 100 nuclear bomber crews
scrambled and nuclear missiles were prepared for
launch because of the failure of a 46-cent computer
chip, according to Johnson.
If Johnson loses his current case, he must appeal
at a higher level and keep his heroic effort alive until
something is done to outlaw launch on warning. We
must be aware of the peril of signing our fate over to
failure-prone machines.
