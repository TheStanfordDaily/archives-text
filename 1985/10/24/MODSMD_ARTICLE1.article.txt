# Profs. Criticize Hoover Politics
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Two Stanford professors have challenged University
President Donald Kennedy's denial that the Hoover In
stitution has a "political mission," asserting that a con
tinuation of Hoover's political activities must result in a
breaking of ties between Hoover and Stanford.
In an Oct. 21 letter to members of the Faculty Sen
ate, Political Science Prof. John Manley and English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz claimed that "overwhelming
evidence exists "documenting the political mission
and activities of the Hoover Institution."
Kennedy was out of town and unavailable for com
ment yesterday.
Manley and Rebholz accused the administration of
refusing to discuss the issue "at the expense of the in
tegrity of the University."
At a Sept. 26 meeting of the Faculty Senate, Ken
nedy refuted Rebholz's charge that Hoover is a political
entity and should be divorced from the University,
saying the "evidence" does not exist to make such an
assertion.
Kennedy also cited a report by a committee headed
by Sociology Prof. Sanford Dornbusch. Kennedy said
the committee "thoughtfully considered those charges
and that question (about Hoover's alleged political ac
tivities) and did not make the finding."
Dornbusch was unavailable for comment yesterday.
At the Sept. 26 senate meeting, Dornbusch
reiterated the committee's conviction that its charge
and its short life-span dictated that the committee's
energies be spent on the issue of the governance of
Hoover.
Manley said yesterday, however, that the
Dornbusch committee "didn't ask the crucial ques
tions," but instead addressed Hoover's ideological
commitments.
"I don't care about Hoover's conservative ideology,"
Manley said. "We shouldn't take on liberal political
causes either."
Manley reasserted his charges in the letter to the
faculty, saying that the Dornbusch committee ignored
the Hoover Institution's various political activities, in
cluding services to conservative candidates and at
tempts to influence public opinion.
In their letter, Manley and Rebholz cite a passage
from a June 15, 1984 Wall Street Journal article on
Hoover as evidence for their contention that Hoover is
politically active.
That passage said, "An academic who has spent time
at both Harvard and Hoover says, 'People ask, what's
the difference between Harvard supplying ideas and
people for (former President) John Kennedy and
Hoover supplying them for Reagan?' The answer, he
says, is that 'Harvard has a lot of bright people, many
of whom supply ideas for conservatives, but that is not
Harvard's main business. Hoover is in the business of
supplying ideas for conservatives.' "
Rebholz, who at the Sept. 26 senate meeting quoted
a Dornbusch committee member as saying that the
committee may not have sought out evidence of politi
cal activity, said yesterday that he hoped the letter
would garner enough support to allow "a committee of
outside visitors to examine the relationship between
Hoover and Stanford."
Rebholz added that while it was difficult to estimate
the level of support he and Manley may gain from the
recent letter, "the senate this year seems more sym
pathetic, more questioning."
The Faculty Senate is scheduled to meet today. Al
though Manley and Rebholz's letter is not on the
agenda, Manley said he will bring it up during the ques
tion period of the meeting.
The agenda includes reports from the Steering Com
mitttee, Kennedy, Provost James Rosse and a joint
report from Rosse and Vice President for Develop
ment Henry Riggs on the Centennial Campaign.
