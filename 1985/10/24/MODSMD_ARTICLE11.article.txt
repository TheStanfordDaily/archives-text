## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Explain USW Firings 
### 
Last Thursday, two weeks before the United
Stanford Workers' strike deadline, the University
fired three workers.
First, the University charged Victor Hill, a USW
member, with slashing the tires of his supervisor,
Hector Allen. Marlena Broussard, who said she was
with Hill at the time the incident supposedly oc
curred, was also fired. Finally, a temporary worker
who attended a rally in support of Hill and Broussard
was dismissed from his job immediately upon re
turning to work.
These cases, when viewed in the context of a
possible USW strike, suggest a possible campaign of,
intimidation against USW supporters. The Univer
sity owes us an explanation.
The justification given for the firing of Hill and
Broussard warrants further investigation. The only
evidence that Hill slashed Allen's tires appears to
be Allen's claim that he saw the two near his car at
the time of the incident. Stanford police officers,
who were called to the scene to investigate, said
they found insufficient evidence to make an arrest.
Several workers maintain there was prior reason
for hostility between Hill and Allen. Workers in the
Stores are required to wear safety shoes. Hill

claimed the shoes provided to him were too small
and presented a statement from a doctor in an effort
to get different shoes. According to Hill, Allen
denied the request. USW President Dennis Blake
and witnesses have said that only when several co
workers also refused to wear safety shoes in sup
port of Hill did Allen provide Hill with different foot
wear.
But Hill and Broussard were not the only ones
fired. If it is true, as several workers have charged,
that the University fired a temporary worker be
cause he attended a USW rally in support of Hill,
there are compelling legal questions that demand
answers.
It is also an interesting coincidence that Linda
Crouse, USW's chief steward, who joined other
workers by walking off her job in protest of Hill's
firing, was the only worker officially disciplined by
the University.
The University would be well-served to explain
further the circumstances surrounding these inci
dents. Without this, the University's actions can be
viewed as part of a campaign to provoke the union
and to intimidate union supporters.
