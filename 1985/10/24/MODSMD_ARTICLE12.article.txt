## Racism Still Erodes 'The Farm' 
### 
"I wanted to be arrested, but I
didn't know the pain that it entailed.
I wouldn't plan my own beating. It
was so painful, I can scarcely re
member. I really felt like an animal.
I don't plan to be beaten that way
again."
These are the words of Robby
Perkins, a senior separated from
his fellow protesters by Stanford
police, verbally abused, stripped
naked and beaten in their custody
because he decided to commit non
violent civil disobedience in protest
of Stanford's investment ties to
South Africa — because he wouldn't
cooperate, but mainly because he is
black. He still has trouble describ
ing the experience he wears in red
welts across his back, arms and
legs; they are symbols for words
unspoken.
His experience is a symbol of
apartheid in America, which
manifests itself most crudely in the
form of rampant police brutality.
The institutionalization of racism in
this country — so pervasive and
repugnant — undermines the very
integrity of blackness, from dis-

criminatory public policies to an
educational tradition that ignores
us. But when attitudes converge
with authority behind the trigger of
a gun, as they have in the shooting
of an unarmed Bay Area black
youth recently, we are reminded
that black life in America, as in
South Africa, is cheap.
It is not ironic that Robby was
brutalized while peaceably fighting
apartheid. Many of the young black
targets of police bullets here and in
South Africa have thrown no stones
nor held up stores. In July of 1984,
Johannes Ngalo, a 24-year-old black
man, was arrested in a white area
near Johannesburg for "drunken be
havior." Two days later, his family
learned that he had died in his cell.
In September of 1983, Michael
Stewart, a 24-year-old black man
seen last with a white girlfriend,
was arrested for writing graffiti in a
subway station and beaten into a
coma by 11 New York policemen.
When he died two weeks later, the
coroner, who for no apparent rea
son removed Mr. Stewart's eyes,
confirmed the cause of death hypoth
esized by police: heart failure due
to a "drunken frenzy." The officers,
none of whom were charged with
manslaughter, are currently on
trial.
But the case of Robby Perkins is
different in that he is a Stanford stu
dent, and therefore should fall un
der the jurisdiction of the Univer
sity. After all, it is a small popula
tion within finite borders which has
reasonable knowledge about its in
habitants and can handle disputes
more sensitively. It is "The Farm."
Two factors prevent such an
ideal from existing. For one, the
University administration — which
has a long history of problems be
tween the black community and its
police force — is fed up. It has
taken the offensive regarding apart
heid, first by issuing an ill-written

pamphlet, and second by threat
ening to impose the Fundamental
Standard against protesters. Thus,
the University would tragically ab
solve itself of any responsibility for
campus protest except in penalizing
participants, while arrogantly
denying us the form of protest in
spired by Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr.
But "The Farm" may become
"The Plantation" if the University
allows the second factor in the
problems to enforce its laws: the
almost-all-white Stanford police
force. We are all familiar with the
"CHiPS" cops, gun-toting bush
dwellers hiding out on dirt bikes. It
is not simply an image of the all-too
eager police that alarms us — the
cop duos needed for moped viola
tions, the three patrol cars and a
fire engine required for bike thefts,
the concealed anger of men — al
ways white — with helmets on.
But it is much more. In 1983 the
Black Student Union complained to
University President Donald Ken
nedy about the multiple stops of
black drivers made by verbally
abusive policemen on the evening
of a Martin Luther King reception at
Kresge Auditorium. Several BSU
members were introduced to a
hitherto-unknown mediator in the
proud domain of the Stanford
police: Capt. Marvin Moore, a black
man.
Ultimately, a forum was held in
which black students — mostly
male — were able to confront Capt.
Moore and one of his infamous
employees, Officer David Lee. What
emerged were lengthy reports by
black men of having been ques
tioned repeatedly over unsolved
rapes, night rides on which they
were followed and even overnight
detentions. It was testimony to an
unexpressed hatred.
How does an officer feel? When
asked about an incident in which he
followed a black student into the
Black Community Services Center,
ignored the secretary there and
spoke rudely, Officer Lee explained
he often perceives "hostility"
among blacks, and it makes him feel
the same. This is unfortunate. Offi
cer Lee is armed.
What is "hostility" in the eyes of
an Officer Lee is a perception

whose deepest meaning comes
home to black families at a rate far
beyond that of any other group:
Blacks account for half of the annual
deaths by police. This is a reality
about which little is written, a racist
perception hinted at in those favor
ite police phrases: "an obvious
agitator," "seemingly potentially vi
olent," "drunken frenzies." But in
the black community it is known
through rear-view mirrors,
loudspeakers, isolated rooms and
late-night phone calls. This summer
in court, I saw in the eyes of Mi
chael Stewart's mother the space
where life had departed. Symbols
for words unspoken.
Another element which connects
Stanford police brutality to that
which surrounds us nationally is
that the police here, according to
Capt. Moore, do not in any way
consider themselves a campus
force. The problem on campus
becomes more clear: mispercep
tions among individual officers
collude with misperceived policies.
These are the fault of the adminis
tration. It is rare to find a university
in this country that employs cops
with guns. Most call their police
"security" and the difference —
even at schools near high-crime
areas — is not only semantic.
The level of crime at Stanford
and the conduct of its students
simply do not warrant an armed
police force. Personally, I much
prefer the guys in the little carts,
who are civil yet professional.
As was evidenced by a massive
and even poignant demonstration of
multi-racial solidarity in the Quad
last week, the University's threats
and the use of its overzealous police
force can only embolden student
protest. A tripling of student ar
rests aside, the tripling of the rate
of deaths in South Africa since the
state of emergency was imposed
bears meaning: meeting forceful
sentiment with forceful means does
not a tenable policy make. It has,
for too long now, been a time of
reckoning.
