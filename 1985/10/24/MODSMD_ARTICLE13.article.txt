# Help Unions Persevere
## 
### 
With the possibility of a strike on campus within the
next week, many students are rightfully concerned and
understandably confused.
A strike will be an inconvenience for many students
and, with all the assertions of the University that they
want "happy workers" and that the union proposals are
outrageous, it is difficult to see the truth of the situa
tion. To understand the role of the University in its re
lationship to United Stanford Workers, we must look
beyond the obvious connections of the administration's
attitude toward people who challenge its policies and
direction, and examine the larger context of the move
to the right under President Reagan, and the effect of

this move on unions in par
ticular.
Students, faculty and
workers are asking for more
community control — for
more control over the deci
sions that affect their lives.
The struggle of USW for a
fair contract can be seen in
the context of the struggles

of Afro-American scholars for respect — as they were
not consulted when the University created its infamous
"Stanford and South Africa" booklet. It can be seen in
the context of student activists fighting intimidation —
from the physical threats of police violence to the Uni
versity's threats of expulsion.
The struggle of USW for a fair contract, the basic
rights of job security and union representation is not
unusual. In the last five years, the Reagan Administra
tion has created a climate in which corporations and in
stitutions know they will not be stopped by federal en
forcement from getting away with whatever they can.
This climate encourages union busting and the kind
of contract the University is trying to force USW to ac
cept, which asks the workers to give up rights that
they are entitled to under federal law. This includes the
right of access, which states that union members have
a right to consult with union representatives on the job.
The University's proposal would take away this right
and entitle managers and supervisors to fire anyone
who communicates with a union representative while
at work. Although the University negotiators try to
portray the union as greedy, these basic rights are
what USW seeks to maintain.
A more blatant local example of union busting helps
to illustrate what the Stanford administration is pushing
for, albeit in a slower process of gradual take-aways
and de-unionization. Over the summer, Watsonville
Canning and Richard Shaw, Inc., two large frozen-food
companies in Watsonville, imposed a contract that in

eluded 28 to 45 percent wage cuts, elimination of
seniority rights, reduction of health benefits and over
40 other take-aways.
Over 2,000 workers, most of them Chicano or
Mexicano and more than 80 percent of them women,
have been on strike since Sept. 9. The strikers have
been harassed and arrested by police, and limited by
court injunction to only a small number of picketers at a
time. The strikers are fighting for basic survival: to be
able to support their families and live with some sense
of dignity and in good health.
Third World women, due to racism and sexism,
already have the most difficult bargaining position of all

workers in America. This is
the group companies can pay
the least and the group that
has the fewest connections
to help get favorable media
coverage — or to get any
coverage at all. However,
this is also the sector of the
society that has the least to
lose in fighting to keep their

union and a wage that is above the minimum.
The Watsonville strike shows no signs of abating,
and community support is growing in the form of ma
terial aid and solidarity days like the one this Sunday.
The Watsonville strike is notable not for the arrogance
and hard line taken by the companies, for this is
prevalent in America today, but for the militance and
perseverance of the strikers.
As students at Stanford, it is often difficult for us to
understand labor disputes or even why people fight to
have or maintain a union. The vast amount of experi
ence here comes from the other end of the spectrum,
from parents who are managers or company owners.
Many of us have been brought up with the image of
labor unions as greedy inflation-pushers and are taught
that management knows what is best for the workers.
This is the time for us to take a hard look at those as
sumptions in the face of the cold reality confronting the
workers at Stanford, Watsonville and countless other
workplaces throughout the nation. A strike is not a fun
event; strikes are not called on a whim. A strike is the
only way for workers to show intractable management
their unity, strength and commitment to stick to cer
tain bottom line proposals. The workers need our un
derstanding and our help in urging the bosses to
negotiate a fair contract, in providing money and food
and, if need be, walking the picket lines in solidarity.

With the possibility of a strike on campus within the
next week, many students are rightfully concerned and
understandably confused.
A strike will be an inconvenience for many students
and, with all the assertions of the University that they
want "happy workers" and that the union proposals are
outrageous, it is difficult to see the truth of the situa
tion. To understand the role of the University in its re
lationship to United Stanford Workers, we must look
beyond the obvious connections of the administration's
attitude toward people who challenge its policies and
direction, and examine the larger context of the move
to the right under President Reagan, and the effect of

this move on unions in par
ticular.
Students, faculty and
workers are asking for more
community control — for
more control over the deci
sions that affect their lives.
The struggle of USW for a
fair contract can be seen in
the context of the struggles

of Afro-American scholars for respect — as they were
not consulted when the University created its infamous
"Stanford and South Africa" booklet. It can be seen in
the context of student activists fighting intimidation —
from the physical threats of police violence to the Uni
versity's threats of expulsion.
The struggle of USW for a fair contract, the basic
rights of job security and union representation is not
unusual. In the last five years, the Reagan Administra
tion has created a climate in which corporations and in
stitutions know they will not be stopped by federal en
forcement from getting away with whatever they can.
This climate encourages union busting and the kind
of contract the University is trying to force USW to ac
cept, which asks the workers to give up rights that
they are entitled to under federal law. This includes the
right of access, which states that union members have
a right to consult with union representatives on the job.
The University's proposal would take away this right
and entitle managers and supervisors to fire anyone
who communicates with a union representative while
at work. Although the University negotiators try to
portray the union as greedy, these basic rights are
what USW seeks to maintain.
A more blatant local example of union busting helps
to illustrate what the Stanford administration is pushing
for, albeit in a slower process of gradual take-aways
and de-unionization. Over the summer, Watsonville
Canning and Richard Shaw, Inc., two large frozen-food
companies in Watsonville, imposed a contract that in

eluded 28 to 45 percent wage cuts, elimination of
seniority rights, reduction of health benefits and over
40 other take-aways.
Over 2,000 workers, most of them Chicano or
Mexicano and more than 80 percent of them women,
have been on strike since Sept. 9. The strikers have
been harassed and arrested by police, and limited by
court injunction to only a small number of picketers at a
time. The strikers are fighting for basic survival: to be
able to support their families and live with some sense
of dignity and in good health.
Third World women, due to racism and sexism,
already have the most difficult bargaining position of all

workers in America. This is
the group companies can pay
the least and the group that
has the fewest connections
to help get favorable media
coverage — or to get any
coverage at all. However,
this is also the sector of the
society that has the least to
lose in fighting to keep their

union and a wage that is above the minimum.
The Watsonville strike shows no signs of abating,
and community support is growing in the form of ma
terial aid and solidarity days like the one this Sunday.
The Watsonville strike is notable not for the arrogance
and hard line taken by the companies, for this is
prevalent in America today, but for the militance and
perseverance of the strikers.
As students at Stanford, it is often difficult for us to
understand labor disputes or even why people fight to
have or maintain a union. The vast amount of experi
ence here comes from the other end of the spectrum,
from parents who are managers or company owners.
Many of us have been brought up with the image of
labor unions as greedy inflation-pushers and are taught
that management knows what is best for the workers.
This is the time for us to take a hard look at those as
sumptions in the face of the cold reality confronting the
workers at Stanford, Watsonville and countless other
workplaces throughout the nation. A strike is not a fun
