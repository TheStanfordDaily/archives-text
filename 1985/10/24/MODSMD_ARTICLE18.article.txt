## Do a Major Makeover 
### SCOTT SAN FILIPPO 
When Florence Moore Hall Food Service started a
"make your own breakfast" bar last year for stu
dents who didn't have an appetite for any of the
prepared pancakes, little did it know that it was im
itating another Stanford program — the individually
designed major (IDM).
Students who don't find a department that suits
their academic taste can also cook up their own con
coction of classes and disciplines.
Over 100 students a year visit the Undergraduate
Advising Center with thoughts of putting together
an IDM. Of those students, only about 30 will actu
ally put together a proposal for a unique major.
Kathy Thoelecke, the IDM program coordinator,
says this number thins out because most students
are just unaware of the opportunities and flexibility
available to them within already existing majors.
Those students are made aware of the resources
available and most choose to stay with an existing
major.
"The student who designs a major is a person
with a direct.focus," Thoelecke said. "His goals are
certain and articulated."
The process for submitting an IDM proposal di
rectly calls for the student to plan a full academic
program.
Without an existing department to work in, the
IDM forms a new department in a sense.
The proposal requires an explanation of the goals
of the major, its academic focus and an explanation
of why it cannot be completed within an already es
tablished department.
Students do work with at least two departments.
Most people consult with three faculties. The pro
posal must also include a list of courses which form
the major.
In other words, the student needs to plan out his
full academic program — his "core" courses —
before submitting the proposal.
The program should consist of at least 60 units,
all in courses at or above the 100 level.
Introductory courses, such as the biology core,
do not count toward an IDM. This ensures that stu
dents get academic depth within the program.
While designing the major, students must consult
with at least three faculty members from at least
two departments. These advisers help the student
develop a clear and coherent academic program,

one which will be comparable with other University
programs.
A committee of faculty and students then reviews
the proposal.
Of 34 first proposals submitted last year, only
seven were rejected. Many of these were revised
and resubmitted.
Senior Rob Baylis formed an IDM in
paleoanthropology after taking a course called
Human Origins.
"A concentration or major in only one department
will not allow me time enough for depth in other
areas necessary for a complete understanding of
paleoanthropology," Baylis said in his proposal.
His major involves courses from the Biology, Ge
ology and Anthropology departments. During his
program, he has had to make several revisions.
"Sometimes a class is canceled or there's a time
conflict," said Baylis. "You have to deal with that
when it happens."
Other IDM titles include social theory, petroleum
economics, psychobiology, medieval studies and
neuroscience. Degrees were granted in all of these
areas last year.
Thoelecke thinks highly of those submitting
proposals. "They have taken the initiative to push
beyond what is given to them," she said. "They
show a creativity and confidence about their major."
It's intimidating to put together a proposal — but
those who do, according to Thoelecke, will find it
very rewarding.
