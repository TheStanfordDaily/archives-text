Watchdog (»roup Barks up Marxist Tree
After Business Week magazine reported that more than 10,000 known
Marxists teach on college campuses nationwide, Reed Irvine, chairman of
Accuracy in Media, decided to see what he could do.
Lo and behold, he created Accuracy in Academia, patterned after his
conservative, Washington, D.C.-based organization that publicizes alleged
leftwing slants in media reporting.
And he saw that almost 500 letters and phone calls came in from 110
campuses after a month. And Irvine saw that it was good. And it was good.
I he way the group works is to persuade hundreds of college students to
monitor their liberal professors, reported the Michigan Daily. According to
the story, the project hasn't had much success in Ann Arbor, since both of
ficial student monitors never reported to Irvine.
Irvine said his goal is to make sure that "young minds" aren't molded by
"misinformation."
You don't have to be his official monitor to get action from Accuracy in
Academia, though. Students who think their professors are promoting
their own liberal causes are requested to send AIA a tape recording or
notes from a lecture.
The watchdog group takes over from there by contacting the professor
to check if the allegations are true. If they are, AIA will ask the offending
party to strive for greater balance in classroom presentations or to retract
inaccurate statements.
If the professor is stubborn, AIA will hurl down thunder bolts in its
wrath and will publicize the news of the culprit in its newsletter.
Michael Davidson, vice chairman of College Republicans at University of
Michigan, said he considers the project "almost silly" because "even if you
do put the spotlight on (certain professors), they aren't going to change."
MU Economics Prof. Daniel Fusfeld, who some students claim is a
Marxist, expressed serious concerns with this new movement, however.
His was not a personal worry, but a fear of what might happen to aca
demic freedom, he explained, of course mentioning McCarthyism. Fusfeld
•admitted that during this era he changed his teaching to avoid being labeled
a Marxist.
AIA supporters said that they thought the work would be valuable be
cause it protects students.
"That person who is sitting there is sacrificing his grade for arguing with
the professor and may not have all the facts on the tip of his tongue," said
one MU senior.
Wellesley Women Decry Demeaning Dating
Two enterprising Harvard Business School students aborted their mis
sion of bringing Wellesley dates to Cambridge men after protest at the
women's college blasted all hopes for profits from the matchmaking
venture.
In the latest irate action, the Wellesley student government drafted a
letter denouncing fliers that were posted offering the name and phone
number of a member of the opposite sex to interested parties who sent
$10 to Terry Butler and Steven Laffey.
The ad promised that subscribers could "marry a man who loves you
even if you don't know how to balance your checkbook."
Wellesley representatives sent copies of their letter to administrators at
both schools and asked the entrepreneurs to honor student requests for
refunds.

Blank sheets posted for comments next to the advertisments were cov
ered with responses like "This is demeaning to Wellesley women" and
"Lynch Steven Laffey."
Ginger Howard, president of the Harvard Business School women stu
dents group said they believe the project will die from peer pressure.
Ten Wellesley women did respond to the offer, while only four Business
School men took their peers up on the deal.
Now let's draw a quick supply and demand graph, here.
Wolves in SHEPHERDS Clothing
The Dartmouth Review was pleased to announce the formation of a new
student organization on the New Hampshire campus this month. Accord
ing to its acronym, it is a grouping of Student Heterosexuals Entrusted to
Prevent Homosexual Endangerment of Regular Dartmouth Students —
SHEPHERDS.
The group's president, junior Debbie Stone, hasn't gotten an official OK
from Dartmouth's College Committee on Student Organizations, but she
"emphasized the importance of monitoring homosexual activity at
Dartmouth for health reasons."
"SHEPHERDS is concerned with the various physical diseases and af
flictions that could infect the overwhelming majority of the Dartmouth
campus — who are heterosexual — through contact with homosexuals,"
explained Stone.
She mentioned that one of the group's first topics of concern would be
whether homosexual students should work in the dining halls.
"Students might be getting more in their chocolate chip cookies than
they bargained for," she argued.
SHEPHERDS also intends to distribute research papers and articles on
campus and to do a slide presentation entitled, "Gay Means Happy: Food
For Thought."
Lines Are Nothing To Puck Around With at Rensselaer
If you thought it was a pain to wait in the post office lines to pick up your
care package from home, be glad you're not a hockey fan at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute.
Students loyal to their team, which took last year's national champion
ship, waited in line for tickets for six months.
Really, Maynard? Yeah, good stuff, huh? Would you keep that vigil for
Big Game tickets?
The cold in upstate New York does funny things to people.
Pounding the Pavement for the Pigskin
Who ever said that catharsis and altruism were incompatible?
The rivalry between the University of Texas at Austin and Oklahoma
University is now going to be literally stamped down in concrete thanks to
a unique opportunity accorded the two schools by a Dallas group.
The Friends of Fair Park are looking for a way to improve the state
fairgrounds of that name, and they figure the most innovative way to do it
is to build a brick walkway along one of the avenues adjacent to the
fairgrounds.
The group plans to pave the walkway not with your everyday maroon
bricks, but with bricks that will be sold to individuals and organizations as
donations to the grounds' restoration, according to Scherry Johnson, the

manager of the Texas Promenade Walkway project.
The $37 price of each brick will go toward the completion of the
walkway, with the expected $1 to $2 million in profits slotted toward
renovating the fairgrounds, which are a historic landmark.
The project has set aside a specific section of the walkway for fans of the
Longhorn and Sooner football teams, Johnson said. The fans will be
allowed to buy up as many of the bricks as they want and to inscribe
messages of support into them while they're still wet.
"Aside from being a fun, healthy way to encourage the Texas-OU
rivalry, the schools will designate part of the money raised to scholarship
funds," said project volunteer Susie Greenman.
Johnson said she thought the competition between Texas and OU for
the most brick space will be intense.
Stanford Anti-Porn Lawyer 'Shortsighted'?
Stanford legal scholar Catherine MacKinnon raised some ruckus
recently at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when she spoke to
an audience about anti-pornography legislation.
MacKinnon, the co-author of a piece of legislation that would ban from
Cambridge all material seen as the "graphic, sexually explicit subordination
of women through pictures or words," told the MIT audience that the
question of whether to ban pornography depends on your view of the is
sues involved.
"Pornography in the feminist view is not a question of good or bad, false
or true, edifying or pleasant, but rather of power and powerlessness,"
MacKinnon said. "It's a question of sexual politics."
A female artist in the audience stood up and questioned MacKinnon's
motives in drafting the legislation.
"I have painted a woman from the waist down," she said. "Some men
might look at my picture — which is very beautiful to me — and jack off.
"How," the artist asked, "is your law going to protect me and my
picture?"
MacKinnon answered with a question of her own. "How do you feel
about living in a society where men use your art in the way you des
cribed?"
"I can't put things in people's heads," answered the woman. "I can't tell
them what to feel."
MacKinnon then asked, "What if someone who saw something you
(painted) went and forced a woman to do it?"
The woman replied, "They're sick and I'm not."
"When a pornographer makes something, he doesn't care about other
women either," MacKinnon said, adding that the woman would probably
have to end up giving her artwork over to the censors if the bill becomes
law in Cambridge.
The Harvard Crimson, which sent a reporter over to MIT to cover
MacKinnon's speech, wasn't too thrilled with MacKinnon or her bill.
"MacKinnon is undoubtedly a brilliant orator and a true pioneer in the
women's movement," reporter Thomas Winslow editorialized. "But unfor
tunately, her shortsighted political acumen has divided that movement,
alienated male feminists and failed to address in a practical manner the so
cial problem that is pornography."
