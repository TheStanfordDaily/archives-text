# Rosette Renovation

### 
As part of a class project, students of Mechanical Engineering 101: Visual
Thinking have sought to redesign the focal point of the Quad. Scott Ander
son, Mary Ellen Vetters, Ted Santos, Kevin Owens and Rackel Altman dis
play their contribution to the event yesterday afternoon. About two dozen
groups lugged their functional proposals, some of which opened and shut
like umbrellas, to the Quad.
