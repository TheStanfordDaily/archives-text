# Handel's 'Solomon' Drags and Delights
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
Sunday's San Francisco Symphony performance of George
Frideric Handel's "Solomon" was a show with its ups and downs.
At times the audience for this third and final performance of the
work was delighted by the playful exchange of instrumental and vocal
sections, emotional arias and triumphant choruses. At others, the
repetitious droning of the soloists nearly put the capacity Davies Hall
crowd to sleep.
Fortunately, most of the pitfalls occurred early on. By the time
Act I was over, the audience was primed for the second and third
acts, a fact that would have made Handel himself smile. The audi
ence's patience through the hour-long first act was rewarded with
the appearance of soprano Marvis Martin. She proceeded to thrill the
audience with her emotional portrayal of the Queen of Sheba, a
woman appealing to King Solomon after having her child unjustly
stolen from her.
When Solomon decrees that the baby contested by two women
should be cut in half, Martin, as one of the women, offers to give up
her baby son in order to spare his life. She pleads, "Take him all —
but spare my child," and all but breaks down in tears.
Despite the fact that countertenor Jeffrey Gall, as the wise and
just King Solomon, had a voice totally unbefitting for the part, he and
Martin provided a convincing musical dialogue throughout Acts II and
111 that kept the audience involved and interested in the plot. They
seemed to transcend the stage and assume the garb of a king and
queen in an ancient court.
While some of the problems with the work were the fault of the
performers — notably, a weak performance by bass baritone Daniel
Lichti whose words seemed to have no relationship to the accompa
nying music — others were problems inherent in the work itself.
It seems audiences even in Handel's era thought the work too long
and inconsistent. Handel directed "Solomon" only five times during
his life, three times in 1749 and twice more in 1759, just before his
death. The work does not appear to have been a great success,
despite its similarity to Handel's masterpiece, "Messiah."
The chance that the audience would leave Davies Hall feeling that
the afternoon had been a great success was ruled out when it was an
nounced prior to the concert that Sir Charles Mackerras, the sched
uled conductor, was ill and had returned to his native England. Vance
George, the director of the San Francisco Symphony Chorus, filled
in admirably but — like the performance in general — lacked a sense
oi vigor and originality.
