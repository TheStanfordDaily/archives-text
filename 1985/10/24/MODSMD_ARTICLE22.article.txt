Oingo Boingo —
"Dead Man's Party"
It's been said that when young
Japanese children visit the United
States for the first time, they spot a
McDonald's or a 7-Eleven and say,
"Wow, they have those here too!"
Likewise, famous record reviewers
like us are sure to be asked by Paly
punks if we've heard of "new"
groups like Tears for Fears,
O.M.D. or Oingo Boingo. Well, this
isn't Boingo's first album. It's their
fourth, and since their Los Angeles
breakthrough in 1980, the band has
enjoyed a good-sized, loyal follow
ing, which was somewhat shaken
with the release and (gasp) success
of "Weird Science." They can relax.
Despite the hittish tendencies of
some of the tracks, the music is still
unmistakably Oingo Boingo. It may

chasm pretty well, though hardcore
Oi-folk will still miss yesterday's
clever lyrics and dance-at-all-costs
style. One shouldn't complain,
though. Oingo Boingo can still
prove to its old fans that selling isn't
necessarily selling out.
ÜB4O — "Little Baggariddim"
ÜB4O has a distinctive synthesizer
pop reggae sound that the United
States first heard on their "Labor of
Love" and "Geoffrey Morgan" LPs,
and their new six-song EP seems to
live up to those standards. They
join up with Chrissie Hynde (of The
Pretenders, of course) on a won
derful reggae-ized cover of the
Sonny and Cher 70s lollipop hit, "I
Got You Babe." The vocals are the
hook. ÜB4O lead vocalist Ali
Campbell takes over Sonny's part,
and Chrissie is Cher, sounding as
alluring as ever and even somewhat
sophisticated. "Don't Break My
Heart" has a slow but catchy, more
standard ÜB4O sound, and "Mi
Spliff" is a perky song about the
green weed. "Hip Hop Lyrical
Robot" is a quirky, rap-reggae song
that is unusual for ÜB4O, but it
comes off quite well. From there
though, ÜB4O gets a half-star
demotion for the remaining songs,
which take a lot away from the EP
— a boring dub version of "I Got
You Babe" and a song they released
in England some years ago as a
single, "One in Ten." They really
could have added something new.
The Waterboys —
"This Is The Sea"
This album is the Waterboys' third
attempt at legitimizing themselves

be less hyperactive and danceable,
as per lead singer Danny Elfman's
recent solo album, but nevertheless
it's just as sophisticated, catchy and
instrumentally rich. Between the
band's more polished sound and
Elfman's more professional vocals,
Boingo has steadily become easier
to listen to. This album straddles
the old audience/new audience

The rating scale: one to five stars, with five being the best.
Selected cuts from these albums will be played on KZSU tomorrow at 6 p.m

as a member of the big-guitar-band
genre that includes most
prominently U2, as well as Big
Country and The Alarm. The sound
here is not entirely guitar
dominated but a strong mix of
guitar, piano and one or another
kind of horn. It sounds real good,
but it isn't a clincher. What we've
got is Mike Scott,
writer/vocals/guitar/piano, and he
sounds like he's got a lot to say, and
it's damn serious. Appropriately,
the music takes on the booming,
escalating sound the bands men
tioned above have; it's a rally cry at
times or it's somber at other times.
"Old England" is a convincing la
ment about an England that will not
realize that it is no longer the world
power it used to be. Scott com
plains about those who still "bang
thp drum like it's 1973" in two

songs, and in "Spirit" Scott defers
to God and the spirit within us,
seeing man as tethered by his
world and its values and ignoring
the spiritual which can set him free.
Powerful stuff, but it just isn't con
vincing. Scott's voice doesn't have
it, and that's all there is to it.
It's not that it isn't effective with
the music — it's just that it's always
the same wailing, the-world-is
doomed voice — straining, croak
ing, burning before the fire is set.
That's where The Waterboys fail to
live up to big-guitar-band stand
ards. The album may grow on* you
after several listens, but will it t ever
rank with U2 or Alarm albums?
Nope.

comes off quite well. From there
though, ÜB4O gets a half-star
demotion for the remaining songs,
which take a lot away from the EP
— a boring dub version of "I Got
You Babe" and a song they released
in England some years ago as a
single, "One in Ten." They really
could have added something new.
The Waterboys —
"This Is The Sea"
This album is the Waterboys' third
attempt at legitimizing themselves

be less hyperactive and danceable,
as per lead singer Danny Elfman's
recent solo album, but nevertheless
it's just as sophisticated, catchy and
instrumentally rich. Between the
band's more polished sound and
Elfman's more professional vocals,
Boingo has steadily become easier
to listen to. This album straddles
the old audience/new audience

The rating scale: one to five stars, with five being the best.
Selected cuts from these albums will be played on KZSU tomorrow at 6 p.m

as a member of the big-guitar-band
genre that includes most
prominently U2, as well as Big
Country and The Alarm. The sound
here is not entirely guitar
dominated but a strong mix of
guitar, piano and one or another
kind of horn. It sounds real good,
but it isn't a clincher. What we've
got is Mike Scott,
writer/vocals/guitar/piano, and he
sounds like he's got a lot to say, and
it's damn serious. Appropriately,
the music takes on the booming,
escalating sound the bands men
tioned above have; it's a rally cry at
times or it's somber at other times.
"Old England" is a convincing la
ment about an England that will not
realize that it is no longer the world
power it used to be. Scott com
plains about those who still "bang
thp drum like it's 1973" in two

songs, and in "Spirit" Scott defers
to God and the spirit within us,
seeing man as tethered by his
world and its values and ignoring
the spiritual which can set him free.
Powerful stuff, but it just isn't con
vincing. Scott's voice doesn't have
it, and that's all there is to it.
It's not that it isn't effective with
the music — it's just that it's always
the same wailing, the-world-is
doomed voice — straining, croak
ing, burning before the fire is set.
That's where The Waterboys fail to
live up to big-guitar-band stand
ards. The album may grow on* you
after several listens, but will it t ever
rank with U2 or Alarm albums?
Nope.

Oingo Boingo —
"Dead Man's Party"
It's been said that when young
Japanese children visit the United
States for the first time, they spot a
McDonald's or a 7-Eleven and say,
"Wow, they have those here too!"
Likewise, famous record reviewers
like us are sure to be asked by Paly
punks if we've heard of "new"
groups like Tears for Fears,
O.M.D. or Oingo Boingo. Well, this
isn't Boingo's first album. It's their
fourth, and since their Los Angeles
breakthrough in 1980, the band has
enjoyed a good-sized, loyal follow
ing, which was somewhat shaken
with the release and (gasp) success
of "Weird Science." They can relax.
Despite the hittish tendencies of
some of the tracks, the music is still
unmistakably Oingo Boingo. It may

chasm pretty well, though hardcore
Oi-folk will still miss yesterday's
clever lyrics and dance-at-all-costs
style. One shouldn't complain,
though. Oingo Boingo can still
prove to its old fans that selling isn't
necessarily selling out.
ÜB4O — "Little Baggariddim"
ÜB4O has a distinctive synthesizer
pop reggae sound that the United
States first heard on their "Labor of
Love" and "Geoffrey Morgan" LPs,
and their new six-song EP seems to
live up to those standards. They
join up with Chrissie Hynde (of The
Pretenders, of course) on a won
derful reggae-ized cover of the
Sonny and Cher 70s lollipop hit, "I
Got You Babe." The vocals are the
hook. ÜB4O lead vocalist Ali
Campbell takes over Sonny's part,
and Chrissie is Cher, sounding as
alluring as ever and even somewhat
sophisticated. "Don't Break My
Heart" has a slow but catchy, more
standard ÜB4O sound, and "Mi
Spliff" is a perky song about the
green weed. "Hip Hop Lyrical
Robot" is a quirky, rap-reggae song
that is unusual for ÜB4O, but it
comes off quite well. From there
though, ÜB4O gets a half-star
demotion for the remaining songs,
which take a lot away from the EP
— a boring dub version of "I Got
You Babe" and a song they released
in England some years ago as a
