# Shorter's Sax Performance Comes Up Long in Volume
## 
### CHRIS HAQQ 
Saturday night, the Wayne Shorter Quartet landed
like a 747 jet at the Great American Music Hall. Unfor
tunately, talent was not the driving force, but rather
the decibel level put out by a Yamaha synthesizer and
electric bass.
Every corner table, nook and cranny was filled in the
Hall, but the initially enthusiastic audience was ex
hausted two songs into the set. The quartet opened
with 'Who Goes There" â€” an easy question, the bass
went there. The bassist wore sweats and seemed to
be getting a lot of exercise while emitting 120 decibel
pulses of pure unadulterated earthquake tremors.

Even sitting behind the
speaker array, you couldn't
tell if Shorter's legendary
soprano and tenor saxophone
was really producing sound.

Several unsuspecting patrons not equipped with
earplugs left. Even sitting behind the speaker array,
you couldn't tell if Shorter's legendary soprano and
tenor saxophone was really producing sound. It was
easy to see Shorter's fingers moving, but much of his
work was lost in the electronic barrage.
Compared to Shorter's work of the '70s, there was
an amazing lack of originality in Saturday's show. This
is not to say that there was nothing worth listening to
in the quartet's repertory. The group has a sound close
to the enormously appealing fusion group, Spirogyra.
Like Spirogyra, Shorter and compatriots put out jazz
driven by an exhilarating funk beat. When you can hear
it, Shorter's sax playing lends the group the same mu
sical focus that Spirogyra alto player Jay Beckenstein
has mastered.
Shorter plays an unusual soprano instrument. The

neck is bent at just the right angle to allow the main
body of the horn to slant away from the body, resem
bling a tenor sax. This allows Shorter special ease in
switching back and forth from horn to horn. At least it
lends him a unique posture that makes him seem very
intense and totally involved in his own world.
In a precious few charts, the rhythm section, espe
cially the quartet's keyboard wizard, created well
placed electronic effects that lent an air of mystery and
dreaminess to the music. The group's third song
"Dianna" was especially entrancing. For once, the
keyboards, bass and piano came together to form a
backdrop for Shorter's soprano saxophone.
On the "Dianna" chart, the zephyr-like stream of
notes emanating from Shorter's horn was designed to
create an image of an archetypal perfect woman.
Shorter used several interesting techniques to create
these impressionistic effects. His solo began with a
sharp, staccato volley of pentatonic scale work. Then,
the mystical keyboard and bass background came down
to an entirely bearable volume. Shorter began to play
inside the changes, giving at least a taste of the legen
dary sax playing. Finally, his ultra-high-speed fingering
and low volume gave a fluid stimulus, putting all lis
teners in a trance.
Unfortunately, the audience was not relieved from
mediocre jazz for long. The combo's rhythm section
made the mistake of keeping the same tempo through
out all charts. After you've heard the fourth chart with
the same beat at the same tempo, it's easy to get tired.
It even seemed that Shorter himself was bored with
the gig. Aside from his performance of "Dianna," and
perhaps some portions of a chart called "Three
Marias," Shorter seemed quite unenthusiastic.
On subsequent numbers, the band leader soloed less
and less frequently, playing standard, almost cliched
phrases. When he walked out of his central position to
give the rhythm section a chance to solo, he just
moved to a corner of the stage, appearing oblivious to
the sound created by the band.
When the rhythm section was given its chance in the
spotlight, the drummer crashed each cymbal into a dif
ferent microphone, leaving the keyboard player noth
ing to add to the outcry but a series of electronic noise
effects, such as explosions, tearing paper and other
equally uninteresting effects.
Many bored fans were reduced to outright yawns.
By the time the group got around to playing
"Endangered Species," the aroused listener certainly
fit the category.
