## She's Off to a Good Start Freshman Jenna Johnson is already an Olympic champion Johnson 
### BARRETT HEYWOOD 
Though freshman Jenna Johnson
has lots to brag about — her swim
ming exploits include a gold and a
silver medal in the 1984 Olympics
— she will not talk about her
achievements unless she is
pressed by direct questioning.
"People tend to look at me dif
ferently when they find out about
the Olympics. I want them to think
of me as a person, not just as a

swimmer," Johnson said.
But what a swimmer she is. At
the age of eight, Johnson began to
swim to combat summer boredom.
She was further inspired by her
best friend's trophy case. "I won't
say that was all there was to it, but
trophies were a big part of wanting
to swim," Johnson said.
The first time Johnson even
thought of competing worldwide
was the summer before the 1984
Olympic Games. "We were having
a pancake breakfast around the

pool, and my coach pointed out
that I was like three seconds off
the Olympic cut time. I really
didn't think I could make it, but
through training techniques I
hadn't tried before, like weight lif
ting and running, I shaved the time
off."
After winning the gold in the
400-meter freestyle relay and a sil
ver in the 100-meter butterfly in
Los Angeles, Johnson decided to
continue her swimming career at
Stanford because of the closeness

of her home in Santa Rosa and the
influence of three former
clubmates now on the Stanford
team.
Women's swimming Coach
George Haines expects Johnson to
have an immediate impact for the
Cardinal, especially for the two
medley relay teams. "She turns
both medley relays from a third or
fourth to a possible walk-away at
the NCAA. She will swim in four
relays all together and the 50 and
100 freestyle and the 100 butter

fly, her specialty," Haines said.
"If I had five Jennas to take to
the NCAA, we'd win every year,"
says a confident Haines.
Johnson's main competition in
the 100-meter butterfly will be
gold medalist Mary T. Meagher,
who is a junior at UC-Berkeley.
Although Johnson says her swim
ming goals are just to improve her
times, she admits, "I would really
like to beat Mary T. again." The
last time Johnson beat her was in
the Olympic trials.

Haines said Johnson's workouts
at Stanford will not be like high
school. Right now Haines has
Johnson, like the rest of the squad,
practicing at least once every day,
including the weekend. Two days
a week, the team undergoes two
a-day workouts.
"It's my belief that two shorter
practices are better for a taller
swimmer like Jenna than one long
practice," he said. "She will be

more rested.
Johnson is working toward the
NCAA Championships in April and
the World Games in June which will
be — because of Soviet bloc partici
pation — more competitive than
the '84 Games.
After swimming, Johnson plans
to pursue a career in the field of
communications. "I've had some
speaking engagements, and while
I'm not a great speaker, I do feel I
have some talent in that area,"
Johnson says.
With Jenna Johnson on the team
this year, it could be Stanford's
competition that is left speechless.
