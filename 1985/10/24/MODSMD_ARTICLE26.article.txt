# 3-0 shutout gives St. Louis a 3-1 Series lead
## Cards' Tudor Gives the Royals a Lesson 
### 
ST. LOUIS (AP) —John Tudor pitched a five-hitter
and the St. Louis Cardinals powered their way to a 3-0
victory over the Kansas City Royals last night, moving
within one victory of their second World Series champi
onship in four years.
The Cardinals, with an offense built on speed and
line drives, scored two of their runs on solo homers by
Tito Landrum, the substitute who is hitting .400 for the
Series, and Willie McGee, the National League batting
champion at .353. Their third run was a more typical
St. Louis effort, scoring on a triple by Terry Pendleton
and a full-count suicude squeeze bunt by Tom Nieto.

The victory gave the Cardinals a 3-1 advantage in
the best-of-seven Series and left the Royals'
postseason hopes dangling by a thread. Only five other
teams have ever recovered after trailing 3-1 in the Se
ries, the last being the 1980 Pittsburgh Pirates.
The Cardinals can wrap it up tomorrow night, when
they will send right-hander Bob Forsch, 9-6, a two
time loser in St. Louis' seven-game Series victory over
Milwaukee in 1982, against Royals left-hander Danny
Jackson, 14-12, and the loser of Game 1.
The left-handed Tudor, 21-8 during the season and
3-1 in the postseason, was virtually untouchable in his
best postseason outing of the year. He struck out
eight, walked one and allowed four singles and a
double.
He never really was in trouble until the seventh in
ning when the Royals loaded the bases with two out on
a pair of singles and a walk. But Tudor got out of it
when pinch-hitter Hal Mcßae swung on a pitch low and
away and grounded into a forceout at third. Tudor had
the first World Series shutout since Scott McGregor of
Baltimore beat the Philadelphia Phillies 5-0 in Game 5
of the 1983 classic.
While the Cardinals' offensive effort resembled
something less than all-out warfare, it was a marked
contrast to the first three games, in which they batted
. 198 as a team with little run-scoring efficiency. The
entire Series, in fact, had been marked by a decided
lack of power, with the Royals' Frank White hitting the
first homer in Game 3 Tuesday night.
Landrum, filling in for injured rookie base-stealing

star Vince Coleman, homered off Royals left-hander
Bud Black in the second inning. McGee hit one off
Black in the third, and the surprise squeeze came in
the fifth as the Cardinals made the most of their oppor
tunities.
If the Cardinals should go on to win the Series in five
games, they would be the third consecutive team to do
so. The Orioles won in five over Philadelphia in 1983,
and J)etroit did it to San Diego last year.
For the first time in this Series, the Cardinals broke
on top, on Landrum's one-out homer in the second in
ning. Jack Clark had struck out on a checked swing,
and Black, who allowed 17 homers this year, had the
count full against Landrum before offering the home
run pitch.
Landrum stroked the ball, almost gently it seemed,
but it arced toward the standing-room-only level below
the first deck in right field, fair by about 20 feet and
easily out of the park.

Landrum, who has played the last seven postseason
games in place of the injured Coleman, came out of the
dugout for a curtain call as the 53,634 at Busch
Stadium, most of them dressed in Cardinal red,
erupted in support of a newfound hero. Fireworks lit
up the sky.
The home run, the second of Landrum's postseason
career, was the first off Royals' pitching in 68 innings,
dating back to Game 3 of the American League playoffs
against Toronto. Landrum had four homers in 161 at
bats during the season.
With Baltimore in 1983, Landrum broke up a score
less game with a 10th inning homer to beat the Chicago
White Sox and move the Orioles into the World Series.
The fireworks boomed again with two out in the
third inning, this time for McGee. After takinng a ball
and two strikes, McGee launched a line drive off one of

Things started off well enough for the Royals in the first inning last night. In a rundown between
first and second, the Cards' Ozzie Smith watches Kansas City catcher Jim Sundberg take the
throw from shortstop Buddy Biancalana (rear). Smith was eventually tagged out, but the Cards
won 3-0 behind John Tudor.
