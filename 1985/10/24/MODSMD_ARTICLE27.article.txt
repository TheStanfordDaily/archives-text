# Ice Is Nice: Why Not A Rink Here?
## 
### 
Last weekend in Los Angeles wasn't a total loss
sportswise — although Stanford dropped a 30-6
decision to USC in football Saturday, Sunday proved
to be a chance to see possibly the greatest hockey
player of all time — Wayne Gretzky. Edmonton was
visiting the Forum, and Gretzky didn't disappoint.
The Great One had one goal and two assists in an
8-5 Oiler win. And those three plays made a $5 stu
dent ticket more than worth it. Gretzky's goal was
an unstoppable shot into the top of the net over the
right shoulder of Kings' goalie Bob Janasek.
The first assist was a picture-perfect pass in
front, Gretzky's 700 th career assist — coming in
only his 478 th game. And the second assist came
during a shorthanded situation, as he fed Paul Cof
fey on a textbook two-on-one that brought many of
the L.A. fans to their feet.

Gretzky also kills penalties, forechecks and isn't
too bad on defense either. He has rewritten the
NHL record book in only six years in the league —
twice going over 200 points in a season. He has said
this year he intends to score 100 goals in the 80-
game season. Neither has ever been done before.
And, to top it off, he has yet to reach his 25th
birthday.
It's obvious Los Angeles isn't a. hockey town,
though. Just over 10,000 people made the trip on a
Sunday night to see the best team and best player in
hockey today. In a metropolitan area of more than 9
million people, you'd think there would be more, but
then again kids in Southern California don't grow up
spending their winters skating on frozen ponds.
It's also a shame that the Bay Area can't support a
hockey team. One wonders if this area of 5.5 million
would have taken to the game if it had been provided
something more than the pathetic California Golden
Seals.
You wonder, though, whether Stanford fans
would take to hockey here. There is already a club
team here, but it is forced to play in Belmont and
practice in Cupertino, not a way to get fan support.
Realizing that the majority of students are from the
West Coast, there is still a substantial minority from
the Midwest, East and Canada to provide a base.
At many schools in the Northeast and Upper Mid
west, hockey is the winter sport on campus. Build
ing a rink on campus would open the possibility of

that happening here.
There is obviously a major draw
back — money.
Yet a rink would be a big contri
bution to the campus. First, of
course, it would make things easier
on the hockey team and likely save
it money on rental fees, as well as
help convince potential college
hockey players to come to Stan
ford.
It would also allow the formation
of intramural leagues for those
without the time or talent to play on
a hockey team, as well as IM
leagues for broomball, a sport that
doesn't require skating ability and
has proven to be a popular dorm ac
tivity. And recreational skating
times and physical education
classes in skating could be offered.
Stanford has some of the finest

athletic facilities around. The cost
of an on-campus ice rink is a draw
back, but if the funding could be
found, it would be a very positive
addition to the Stanford community
and those facilities.
The Mailbag
(This letter is written in honor of
Los Angeles Times sports colum
nist Jim Murray. It also is written in
good fun for comic relief, and the
authors hope no one is offended by
it.)
Well, it was the Lions versus the
Christians. The United States
versus Grenada. The earthquake
versus Mexico City.
USC versus Stanford last Satur
day.
It wasn't a game, it was a clinic.
If it was a fight, they would have
stopped it. It wasn't, so they didn't.
The final score was 30-6, but
USC was being nice. It wasn't that
close. It could have been worse. It

should have been worse.
The only thing more boring than
the USC band Saturday was the
Stanford offense.
Stanford's John Paye isn't a quar
terback, he's a strawman. A punch
ing bag. A plaything. A bozo in pads
and a helmet, to be knocked down,
propped up, and knocked down
again.
Stanford doesn't have an offen
sive line, it has a broken dam. The
offensive line is as effective as a
screen door on a submarine. It's
like a 7-Eleven store. Always open.
And you'll love the Stanford
defense, if you like Swiss cheese. It
gives new meaning to the phrase
"big-play defense." The Trojans
completed one pass for 63 yards
and another for 50. Trojan running
backs broke two plays for 19 yards
and another for 30.
