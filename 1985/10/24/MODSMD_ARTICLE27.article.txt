# Ice Is Nice: Why Not A Rink Here?
## 
### 
Last weekend in Los Angeles wasn't a total loss
sportswise — although Stanford dropped a 30-6
decision to USC in football Saturday, Sunday proved
to be a chance to see possibly the greatest hockey
player of all time — Wayne Gretzky. Edmonton was
visiting the Forum, and Gretzky didn't disappoint.
The Great One had one goal and two assists in an
8-5 Oiler win. And those three plays made a $5 stu
dent ticket more than worth it. Gretzky's goal was
an unstoppable shot into the top of the net over the
right shoulder of Kings' goalie Bob Janasek.
The first assist was a picture-perfect pass in
front, Gretzky's 700 th career assist — coming in
only his 478 th game. And the second assist came
during a shorthanded situation, as he fed Paul Cof
fey on a textbook two-on-one that brought many of
the L.A. fans to their feet.

Gretzky also kills penalties, forechecks and isn't
too bad on defense either. He has rewritten the
NHL record book in only six years in the league —
twice going over 200 points in a season. He has said
this year he intends to score 100 goals in the 80-
game season. Neither has ever been done before.
And, to top it off, he has yet to reach his 25th
birthday.
It's obvious Los Angeles isn't a. hockey town,
though. Just over 10,000 people made the trip on a
Sunday night to see the best team and best player in
hockey today. In a metropolitan area of more than 9
million people, you'd think there would be more, but
then again kids in Southern California don't grow up
spending their winters skating on frozen ponds.
It's also a shame that the Bay Area can't support a
hockey team. One wonders if this area of 5.5 million
would have taken to the game if it had been provided
something more than the pathetic California Golden
Seals.
You wonder, though, whether Stanford fans
would take to hockey here. There is already a club
team here, but it is forced to play in Belmont and
practice in Cupertino, not a way to get fan support.
Realizing that the majority of students are from the
West Coast, there is still a substantial minority from
the Midwest, East and Canada to provide a base.
At many schools in the Northeast and Upper Mid
west, hockey is the winter sport on campus. Build
ing a rink on campus would open the possibility of
