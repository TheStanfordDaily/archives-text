# 'Refrigerator' Perry is a Chicago hero
## Green Bay Got Stuffed 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) — Being a
225-pound football player,
George Cumby knows all about
refrigerators. Never before had
he been asked to tackle one.
Cumby, who plays for the
Green Bay Packers, drew that
dubious task Monday night when,
in three goal-line situations, he
faced off with 320-pound William
"The Refrigerator" Perry of the
Chicago Bears.
It was no contest.
Perry, used in short-yardage
situations as a blocking back,
obliterated Cumby twice on
scoring runs by Walter Payton
and ran over Cumby while carry
ing the ball himself for another
score as the unbeaten Bears won
23-7.
"Usually, when two bodies hit,
there's an impact point," Chicago
Coach Mike Ditka said. "But
there wasn't this time. Perry was
like an earth-mover."
"The first time, I figured I'd
take a side," Cumby said. "It
didn't matter which, I guess, be
cause one is as big as another."
Cumby wound up five yards

deep in the end zone.
"The second time, I hit him
flush," Cumby said. "That didn't
work either."
In playing the unwilling patsy to
Perry, Cumby helped create a
folk hero for Chicago fans already
ecstatic over the Bears' 7-0 start.
Consider this: Bear fans actually
cheered when Payton, the NFL's
career rushing leader, was
tackled short of the end zone in
the second period, because it
meant that Perry would enter the
game.
The biggest roar of the night
went up when, instead of block
ing, Perry took a handoff from
quarterback Jim McMahon and
barreled into the end zone.
"I didn't think I dove in. I
thought I was stepping on
people," Perry said.
As a two-way player in high
school at Aiken, S.C., he scored
touchdowns on offense and
defense while playing "a little full
back every now and then." He
hadn't scored again until Monday
night.
Perry, possessor of a 22-inch

neck, 51-inch chest, 46-inch waist
and 34-inch thighs, picked up his
nickname at Clemson, where he
was an Ail-American nose guard.
A teammate hung the tag on him
after watching him turn sideways
in order to get into an elevator.
It was a small elevator, Perry
said.
Ditka earned a reputation as a
devastating blocker in his years
as a tight end for the Bears, and it
didn't take him long to figure
Perry could be one as well.
"We had it in the game plan for
Washington (four weeks earlier),
and I talked about it with my
staff," Ditka said of the goal-line
play. "We figured that 100 years
from now, nobody was going to
care, so why not put it in.
"His movement is excellent,
he's done everything we've asked
of him," Ditka said. "I don't know
that it's a bad idea. There aren't a
lot of 320-pounders who can
move and accelerate, which
William can.
"But, I didn't plan on making
him a national hero."
