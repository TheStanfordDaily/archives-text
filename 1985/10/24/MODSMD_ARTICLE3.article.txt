# Stanford Begins Krakow Program
## 
### DAVID SCHWARTZ Staff writer 
Through a summer program in
Krakow, Poland, coordinated by
the Overseas Studies Office, Stan
ford will be able to offer its students
a chance to peek behind the Iron
Curtain.
Approximately 50 students are
expected to travel to the historic
Polish city next summer and spend
eight weeks taking classes at
Jagelon University, one of the
oldest learning institutions in
Europe. The specific courses and
professors involved in the program
have yet to be determined.
Stanford's first overseas pro
gram in an Eastern Bloc country,
the Krakow program is to differ
from others offered by the Over
seas Office — such as those in Ox
ford and Florence — in that it will
only be considered a test to check
the viability of a more extensive
future program in the city.
"The Krakow program will prob
ably remain a summer program for
now and the foreseeable future,"
explained Political Science Prof. Jan
Triska, one of the organizers of the
program. "In a few years we hope
to have students take courses in
Vienna the spring before they go to
Krakow in preparation for the sum
mer. After that we hope to start a
permanent campus (in the city)."
Despite the linguistic and cultural
differences between the United
States and Poland, requirements to
join the program will be kept to a
minimum.
"Students will not be required to
take Polish before they go, but they

will have to take a class this spring
dealing with the politics, society
and (diplomatic history) of the
country," Triska said.
The program was started after
Triska conducted field trips from
the Berlin and Vienna campuses
two years ago in order to probe the
possibility of a program in Krakow,
according to Triska. The success of
the trip contrasts markedly with
Stanford's attempt to establish a
campus in Prague, Czechoslovakia,
during the early 70s, when the So
viet Union intervened and
prevented any program from
materializing, Triska said.
Krakow is the cultural and his
toric capital of the nation and be
cause it was the only city in Poland
not to be bombed during World War
11, all of its ancient features were
left intact. The city is considered
one of the most interesting in Eas
tern Europe.
Krakow itself, therefore, offers a
good reason for attending the pro
gram, but according to freshman
participant Steven Kay, there are
many other motives.
"I am really excited about going
because I want to have a deeper ap
preciation for the East European
society and culture in general," Kay
said. "Since I'm looking into a
career in international diplomacy or
law, I think the experience of living
in an Eastern Bloc state will be a
practical and invaluable one."
As for the language problems he
might face in the foreign city, Kay
expressed little worry.
"The Poles are required to take
Russian, but, in reality, they put
much more emphasis on learning
English," he said.
