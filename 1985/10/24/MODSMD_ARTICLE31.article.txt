# Washington Gets a Break
## Former Oakland A ordered into drug program 
### 
WALNUT CREEK (AP) â€”
Atlanta Braves right fielder
Claudell Washington was ordered
by a judge to submit to a drug di
version program, rather than go
on trial on charges of marijuana
possession, the Municipal Court's
clerk's office reported yesterday.
The terms of his duty in the
program will be reported later,
said criminal division clerk Susan
Null.
According to the Contra Costa
County District Attorney's Office,
the county probation department
told Municipal Court Judge Joseph
Longacre that Washington, who

has a previous problem with
drugs, was suitable for the pro
gram, which includes classes on
the dangers of drug use.
"He appeared," said Null. "He
was placed on drug diversion, but
we don't know how long. The
terms of the diversion will come
down later."
Washington was arrested Feb.
19 in Walnut Creek, some 30
miles east of San Francisco and a
few miles from his home in
Orinda. He was charged with one
misdemeanor count of marijuana
possession.
If he had been convicted,

Washington faced a maximum
sentence of one year in prison and
a $1,000 fine.
Washington, treated for drug
dependency after the 1983
baseball season, broke into the
major leagues with the Oakland
A's in 1974, and made the Ameri
can League All-Star team two
years later.
He joined the Braves as a free
agent in November 1980 and was
a National League All-Star in
1984. His career also featured
stints with the New York Mets,
Chicago White Sox and Texas
Rangers.
