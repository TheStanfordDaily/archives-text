Reagan Conducts Talks at U.N.
NEW YORK — President Reagan yesterday opened three days of
talks with world leaders, attempting to counter a Soviet propaganda
blitz with a planned initiative aimed at resolving U.S.-Soviet conflicts
in international trouble spots, including Afghanistan and Nicaragua,
Administration sources said.
In an attempt to shift the focus of U.S-Soviet relations away from
arms control, Reagan is expected to call for Soviet disengagement in
these countries when he speaks today to the U.N. General Assem
bly in the midst of ceremonies celebrating the 40th anniversary of
the founding of the United Nations.
His proposal is expected to include a call for superpower involve
ment in resolving these regional conflicts. Last night, at a reception
Reagan hosted for world leaders, the president agreed to meet with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze for a half-hour today
to discuss the U.S. initiative and the forthcoming superpower sum
mit.
Reagan offered a partial preview of today's speech in written
answers to questions posed by The Times of India and made public
yesterday. The speech has been described by White House officials
as the opening volley in the president's effort to recapture the public
relations initiative in the four weeks before his summit meeting with
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev Nov. 19-20.
Reagan's meetings yesterday with India's Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi, Pakistan's President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq and Britain's
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher kicked off three days of consulta
tions with allies, a high point of which will be a "mini-summit" of six
leading industrial democracies today. Administration officials have
described the U.S. effort here as a dress rehearsal for the Geneva
summit.
In his newspaper interview, Reagan said he will ask Gorbachev to
withdraw the more than 100,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan and
restore the country's independence and non-alignment.
Hijacker Names Abbas as Boss
ROME — One of the four hijackers of the cruise liner Achille
Lauro has told investigators that Mohammed Abbas, the leader of
the Palestine Liberation Front, was, as U.S. officials claim, the mas
termind behind the hijacking, according to Italian newspaper reports.
Judicial officials here and in Genoa, where the main investigation
into the piracy is being conducted, refused to confirm or deny the
newspaper reports that one of the young Arab hijackers was
cooperating with investigators.
Judicial authorities here, however, did confirm that one of the four
hijackers had been transferred to a new jail near Genoa from the
maximum security prison at Spoleto. They had been jailed there 10
days ago after being flown from Sicily where the Egyptian airliner
carrying them had landed after being intercepted by U.S. Navy jets.
The Italian newspaper stories, all quoting unidentified unofficial
sources, said that one of the four hijackers had identified Abbas as
the military commander of the hijacking and said that before the four
were turned over to Italian custody, Abbas promised he would see
that they would be freed somehow.
Lange Seeks Nuke Warship Ban
NEW YORK — New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange said
yesterday that he will introduce legislation by early December to for
mally ban U.S. warships carrying nuclear weapons from visiting his
country.
U.S. officials have asserted that such a step will sharpen the chal
lenge that they believe New Zealand's policy of excluding nuclear
weapons from its territory poses for the Reagan Administration in
managing alliances around the world. Enshrining that policy in law
would trigger a further reassessment of military relations between
the two nations, these officials say.
Lange laid repeated and heavy emphasis during an interview on his
desire to continue strong defense ties to the United States.
"Our antinuclear policy is not an anti-American policy," he said. "It
is impossible to be anti-American in New Zealand and be a political
survivor." But he insisted that public sentiment in New Zealand
dictates that these ties have to be on a non-nuclear basis.
Questioned about a second major international dispute in recent
months that has thrust New Zealand onto the front pages, the con
frontation with France over the sinking of the environmental ship
Greenpeace by French secret agents, Lange lamented that the
episode, if anything, seems to have hardened France's insistence on
continued nuclear testing in the Pacific.
The prime minister, who is here to address the U.N. General As
sembly today, noted that he had held the legislation affecting U.S.
warships back for nearly a year in hopes of reaching a compromise
with the United States, but efforts do so had failed.
'Star Wars' Negotiations Denied
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administration denied yesterday
as "utterly without foundation" a report in The Washington Post that
the United States is prepared to negotiate with the Soviet Union any
proposed deployment of new strategic defensive weapons and would
give Moscow five to seven years' notice before unilaterally deploying
them.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said the report in yester
day's Post was "made up out of thin air," and added that there "was
obviously misunderstanding." State Department spokesman Charles
Redman said if the information had been "thoroughly checked, it
would have been shown to be utterly without foundation."
At the Defense Department, a senior official who declined to be
identified called reporters to his office to say that the idea outlined by
The Post "has not been discussed, much less agreed to."
Gandhi, Zia Agree to Hold Talks
NEW YORK — Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Pakistani
President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq are reported to have agreed here
yesterday to begin "technical talks" aimed at averting a nuclear
weapons race in South Asia.
After their morning meeting, the Asian leaders met separately
with President Reagan in his suite in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel,
where Reagan expressed his concern about the prospect of an
"intensifying nuclear competition" between India and Pakistan, ac
cording to a senior Administration official who participated, and who
later briefed reporters.
The U.S. official said that, despite the day's discussions, "it's a
little early to draw conclusions" about the willingness of India and
Pakistan to work together in this field. The official said that meetings
such as the Gandhi-Zia session yesterday were important in dispell
ing mistrust and working toward a more cooperative relationship.

mally ban U.S. warships carrying nuclear weapons from visiting his
country.
U.S. officials have asserted that such a step will sharpen the chal
lenge that they believe New Zealand's policy of excluding nuclear
weapons from its territory poses for the Reagan Administration in
managing alliances around the world. Enshrining that policy in law
would trigger a further reassessment of military relations between
the two nations, these officials say.
Lange laid repeated and heavy emphasis during an interview on his
desire to continue strong defense ties to the United States.
"Our antinuclear policy is not an anti-American policy," he said. "It
is impossible to be anti-American in New Zealand and be a political
survivor." But he insisted that public sentiment in New Zealand
dictates that these ties have to be on a non-nuclear basis.
Questioned about a second major international dispute in recent
months that has thrust New Zealand onto the front pages, the con
frontation with France over the sinking of the environmental ship
Greenpeace by French secret agents, Lange lamented that the
episode, if anything, seems to have hardened France's insistence on
continued nuclear testing in the Pacific.
The prime minister, who is here to address the U.N. General As
sembly today, noted that he had held the legislation affecting U.S.
warships back for nearly a year in hopes of reaching a compromise
with the United States, but efforts do so had failed.
'Star Wars' Negotiations Denied
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administration denied yesterday
as "utterly without foundation" a report in The Washington Post that
the United States is prepared to negotiate with the Soviet Union any
proposed deployment of new strategic defensive weapons and would
give Moscow five to seven years' notice before unilaterally deploying
them.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said the report in yester
day's Post was "made up out of thin air," and added that there "was
obviously misunderstanding." State Department spokesman Charles
Redman said if the information had been "thoroughly checked, it
would have been shown to be utterly without foundation."
At the Defense Department, a senior official who declined to be
identified called reporters to his office to say that the idea outlined by
The Post "has not been discussed, much less agreed to."
Gandhi, Zia Agree to Hold Talks
NEW YORK — Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Pakistani
President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq are reported to have agreed here
yesterday to begin "technical talks" aimed at averting a nuclear
weapons race in South Asia.
After their morning meeting, the Asian leaders met separately
with President Reagan in his suite in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel,
where Reagan expressed his concern about the prospect of an
"intensifying nuclear competition" between India and Pakistan, ac
cording to a senior Administration official who participated, and who
later briefed reporters.
The U.S. official said that, despite the day's discussions, "it's a
little early to draw conclusions" about the willingness of India and
Pakistan to work together in this field. The official said that meetings
such as the Gandhi-Zia session yesterday were important in dispell
ing mistrust and working toward a more cooperative relationship.
Reagan Conducts Talks at U.N.
NEW YORK — President Reagan yesterday opened three days of
talks with world leaders, attempting to counter a Soviet propaganda
blitz with a planned initiative aimed at resolving U.S.-Soviet conflicts
in international trouble spots, including Afghanistan and Nicaragua,
Administration sources said.
In an attempt to shift the focus of U.S-Soviet relations away from
arms control, Reagan is expected to call for Soviet disengagement in
these countries when he speaks today to the U.N. General Assem
bly in the midst of ceremonies celebrating the 40th anniversary of
the founding of the United Nations.
His proposal is expected to include a call for superpower involve
ment in resolving these regional conflicts. Last night, at a reception
Reagan hosted for world leaders, the president agreed to meet with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze for a half-hour today
to discuss the U.S. initiative and the forthcoming superpower sum
mit.
Reagan offered a partial preview of today's speech in written
answers to questions posed by The Times of India and made public
yesterday. The speech has been described by White House officials
as the opening volley in the president's effort to recapture the public
relations initiative in the four weeks before his summit meeting with
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev Nov. 19-20.
Reagan's meetings yesterday with India's Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi, Pakistan's President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq and Britain's
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher kicked off three days of consulta
tions with allies, a high point of which will be a "mini-summit" of six
leading industrial democracies today. Administration officials have
described the U.S. effort here as a dress rehearsal for the Geneva
summit.
In his newspaper interview, Reagan said he will ask Gorbachev to
withdraw the more than 100,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan and
restore the country's independence and non-alignment.
Hijacker Names Abbas as Boss
ROME — One of the four hijackers of the cruise liner Achille
Lauro has told investigators that Mohammed Abbas, the leader of
the Palestine Liberation Front, was, as U.S. officials claim, the mas
termind behind the hijacking, according to Italian newspaper reports.
Judicial officials here and in Genoa, where the main investigation
into the piracy is being conducted, refused to confirm or deny the
newspaper reports that one of the young Arab hijackers was
cooperating with investigators.
Judicial authorities here, however, did confirm that one of the four
hijackers had been transferred to a new jail near Genoa from the
maximum security prison at Spoleto. They had been jailed there 10
days ago after being flown from Sicily where the Egyptian airliner
carrying them had landed after being intercepted by U.S. Navy jets.
The Italian newspaper stories, all quoting unidentified unofficial
sources, said that one of the four hijackers had identified Abbas as
the military commander of the hijacking and said that before the four
were turned over to Italian custody, Abbas promised he would see
that they would be freed somehow.
