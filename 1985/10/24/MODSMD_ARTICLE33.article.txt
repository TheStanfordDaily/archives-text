# Soviets Propose Partial Weapons Freeze
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Soviet Union has pro
posed a temporary freeze on U.S. and Soviet
intermediate-range missiles in an attempt to sep
arate those controversial nuclear weapons from
strategic missile and space talks under way be
tween the superpowers in Geneva, presidential
adviser Paul Nitze disclosed yesterday.
The Soviet proposal was presented last week
to U.S. negotiators in Geneva and has piqued the
interest of U.S. strategists who believe it
"certainly makes it look like (the Soviets) want a
deal," as one arms control official put it.
Nitze said the proposal also would freeze the
number of Soviet SS-20 intermediate-range
missiles deployed in Asia.
That has been a persistent sticking point in
previous negotiations, with the United States ar
guing that without such an agreement Moscow
could simply move its European missiles beyond
the Ural Mountains, and move them back to
threaten Europe during a crisis.
However, Nitze and other U.S. officials cau
tioned that the proposal has major flaws from the
U.S. perspective because it also calls for subse

quent reductions in U.S. intermediate missiles to
allow Moscow compensation for British and
French nuclear forces, a position that has been
unacceptable to the United States.
In a breakfast meeting with reporters, Nitze
described the Soviet offer as "quite a difference
from their initial formula" on intermediate-range
missiles because, unlike previous proposals, it
would allow the United States to keep more than
200 missiles now deployed in Western Europe —
at least for the time being.
By offering to isolate talks on the super
powers' intermediate nuclear forces (INF), the
Soviets appear to be trying to narrow the
Geneva arms discussions to the already complex
issues of longer-range strategic weapons and
space weapons, officials added.
The Soviet offer represents the fourth initia
tive in the past six months by Gorbachev on the
persistent INF problem. These weapons, which
have a shorter range than the ocean-spanning
strategic missiles each superpower has, have
triggered a steady series of diplomatic reverses
for Moscow since 1979, when NATO first

agreed to the deployment of U.S. Pershing 2 and
ground-based cruise missiles in Europe.
Total U.S. and Soviet INF missiles in Europe
may be nearly equal, a parity sought by the
United States as an interim position to its ul
timate goal of eliminating both sides' weapons.
However, the Soviet intermediate-range SS
-20 missile has three warheads while the U.S.
missiles have one each, and Washington has
resisted any freeze based solely on launchers,
according to Administration sources.
In his first major statement after becoming So
viet leader in April, Gorbachev announced a
"unilateral freeze" on further deployments of SS
20s and called on the United States to "display
restraint" in its deployments. He said the freeze
would last until Nov. 1, with continuation depen
dent on whether the United States halted its
deployments. U.S. missiles continued to go into
Europe.
Then, in an Oct. 7 speech to the French parli
ament, Gorbachev scuttled his unilateral freeze
initiative of April and announced that Moscow
would actually reduce the number of its SS-20s.
