# Government to exchange prisoners
## Rebels To Free Duarte's Daughter 
### 
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador
â€” The Salvadoran government
yesterday announced that it has
reached an agreement with leftist
guerrillas for the release of Presi
dent Jose Napoleon Duarte's kid
napped daughter.
Minister of Communications Julio
Rey Prendes told a press confer
ence that the government will free
22 political prisoners and allow 96
wounded guerrillas to leave the
country in exchange for the release
of Ines Guadalupe Duarte Duran;
her companion, Ana Cecilia Villeda;
and 33 mayors and municipal offi
cials who have been kidnapped
since April.
Rey prendes said the agreement

was reached with two representa
tives of the Farabundo Marti Na
tional Liberation Front after three
days of meetings in Panama that
ended Tuesday. He said he and
Abraham Rodriguez, a Christian
Democratic Party leader and the
godfather of Duarte Duran, had
represented Duarte. The accord
was signed by Salvadoran Arch
bishop Arturo Rivera y Damas, who
participated in the talks as an obser
ver.
Rey Prendes declined to say
when the exchanges would take
place, noting that both sides had
agreed that journalists would not be
allowed to watch the releases. But

he invited reporters to come to the
presidential palace early this morn
ing so they could be ferried to an
unknown place to watch the
women's reunion with Duarte and
their families.
Duarte Duran, 35, and Villeda,
23, were abducted Sept. 10 as they
arrived for classes at a private uni
versity in San Salvador. Duarte
Duran's driver was killed in the as
sault, and her bodyguard was
wounded.
Shortly after the kidnapping, the
government announced that the ab
ductors had identified themselves
as the previously unknown Pedro
Pablo Castillo commando of the

Farabundo Marti front. The front
did not acknowledge responsibility
for Duarte Duran's abduction until
this week.
It is believed that members of
the Armed Liberation Forces, one
of the five groups that makes up the
Farabundo Marti alliance, carried
out the kidnapping. "The agree
ment on one side is to exchange
Ines Guadalupe (and Villeda) and 33
members of municipal councils, and
on the other side, our side, to
release 21 political prisoners in jail
to the FMLN. As a humanitarian
act, the government will permit the
crippled people in the mountains to
be evacuated," Rey Prendes said.
