Social Security Hike
WASHINGTON — Social Security
recipients, once accustomed to annual cost-of
living increases of up to 14.3 percent in their
retirement checks, will receive a meager 3.1
percent boost beginning Jan. 1 — the smallest
since the checks were tied to inflation 10 years
ago.
At the same time, workers whose payroll
taxes feed the Social Security trust fund will
find their maximum contribution rising — by
up to $211 a year.
Those increases, and an array of others,
were triggered yesterday when the Labor De
partment reported that consumer prices rose a
bare 0.2 percent during September, rounding
out the 12-month index used to compute
changes in many federal benefit programs.
The September data lowered the official
consumer inflation rate for the last 12 months
to a modest 3.2 percent.
Arms Bill on Ice
WASHINGTON — Senate leaders yester
day agreed on a face-saving plan that would
spare President Reagan an immediate defeat
over a proposed $1.9 billion arms sale to Jor
dan but put it on ice until Jordan and Israel

began peace talks.
The compromise, worked out in daylong
negotiations between Foreign Relations Com
mittee Chairman Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), and
key Democrats, would stall the arms sale until
March 1 unless Reagan certified that Jordan
had entered into "direct and meaningful"
negotiations with Israel.
Lugar said that the plan "preserved the op
tions of the president" during a sensitive per
iod in the Mideast peace process. But Demo
crats said it would effectively doom the sale by
shifting the burden of justification to Reagan
and Jordan while still giving Congress a final
veto.
Before Lugar engineered the compromise,
the Senate had appeared on the verge of
voting to oppose the sale.
UAW May Be Winner
DETROIT — The United Auto Workers ap
pear to have come out the big winner in
reaching a $1 billion settlement yesterday
morning of the union's week-long strike
against Chrysler.
The No. 3 U.S. auto maker seems to have
received little of what it wanted in return for
agreeing to most of the union's key demands,
union and company officials indicated.

When the U.S. settlement was finally an
nounced early yesterday, Chrysler and UAW
leaders agreed that the new three-year con
tract satisfied the union's central demand that
Chrysler workers receive "parity" — wages
and benefits equal to those paid by General
Motors and Ford. Boosts in base wages and
cost-of-living adjustments will immediately
bring wages at Chrysler up to the current GM
average of $13.29 per hour.
Today, local union leaders from Chrysler
plants around the country will meet in Detroit
to vote on the pact and to decide whether to
recommend its ratification by Chrysler
workers this weekend.
