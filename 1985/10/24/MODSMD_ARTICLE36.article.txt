INS Raid Nets Aliens
LOS ANGELES — In a continuing campaign
to pressure racehorse trainers into curbing
their dependence on illegal aliens, the Im
migration and Naturalization Service staged a
pre-dawn raid on Santa Anita race track in ad
jacent Arcadia yesterday, arresting approxi
mately 170 suspected illegal aliens who live
and work at the track.
Since 1982, under its Operations Jobs pro
gram, the INS has been staging well-publicized
raids of factories and other workplaces where
illegal aliens are believed to hold jobs that
might be attractive to Americans.
Western Regional INS commissioner Harold
Ezell said Santa Anita trainers had exhibited
"flagrant disregard" of his agency's demands
for cutbacks on the employment of illegal
aliens.
The raids are, in effect, a propaganda tool
for the INS in its campaign to persuade
Congress to pass a law making it illegal for an

employer to knowingly hire an illegal alien.
Congress has refused to pass such legislation
as part of an immigration-reform measure.
Ex-Mayor Indicted
LOS ANGELES — Valerie Terrigno, who
became the first openly lesbian mayor of a
U.S. city, was indicted by a federal grand jury
yesterday on 14 counts of embezzling money
intended for the poor and homeless.
The charges stemmed from her former job
as executive director of Crossroads Counsel
ing, a federally funded organization in Holly
wood, and involved a total of about $11,000,
prosecutors said.
The indictment alleges that Terrigno, 32,
the first mayor of West Hollywood, knowingly
embezzled thousands of dollars in federal funds
which had come from various federal agencies
in the form of grants.
Terrigno became West Hollywood's mayor

Nov. 29, 1984, a few weeks after local voters
approved a measure to incorporate the area as
Los Angeles County's 84th city, and stepped
down Aug. 85. She remains on the City Coun
cil.
Whale Rescue Plan
RIO VISTA — Federal officials approved a
plan yesterday to drive a humpback whale out
of the Sacramento River delta by herding it
with an underwater barrier and assaulting it
with the noise of clanging pipes.
If these tactics don't work, National Marine
Fisheries Service officials said, they are
prepared to dismantle part of a bridge blocking
the whale's downstream progress or even try
to capture the 40-ton whale and haul it out to
sea in a barge filled with water.
Attempts to herd the 40-foot animal out of
Shag Slough, a shallow dead-end channel in the
delta, could begin as early as today.
