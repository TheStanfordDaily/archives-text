# Suspect Nabbed for Columbae Theft
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Stanford police arrested and booked a
25-year-old man yesterday for a re
ported burglary at Columbae House, and
said he may be responsible for several
other thefts at campus dormitories.
The burglary suspect, John Suppes, is
currently being held at North County Jail
in lieu of $5,500 bail.
Residents of Columbae House phoned
police around 11 a.m. yesterday after
finding Suppes there, according to Stan
ford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Suppes fled, but police found him hiding
on a porch at the corner of Alvarado
Row and Campus Drive.
Stanford police said they searched
Suppes' backpack and found a Walkman
and cassette tape that belonged to a
Columbae resident. Niemeyer said
police determined the Walkman was
stolen by asking Suppes what tape was
in it. Suppes could not identify the tape,
but the Columbae resident who owned
the Walkman identified it correctly.

The suspect was charged with bur
glary, possession of stolen property and
attempting to evade arrest.
Niemeyer, saying that Suppes is a
chief suspect in many recent burglaries,
called the arrest "a good head start" in
the police department's fight to curb
thefts in campus residences.
Police report more than 130 bur
glaries in dormitories and campus
houses since the beginning of the year.
More than 60 of those have occurred
since Sept. 1. In nearly every case, the
burglars have entered through unlocked
doors.
Suppes is not a Stanford student and
is not believed to have any affiliation with
the University. He told officials at North
County Jail that he is a student at Foot
hill College.
Although Suppes lists his address as
678 Mirada, at Stanford, Niemeyer said
he thinks Suppes has been living at a
motel in Los Altos with his wife and a
male friend.
Niemeyer said that Suppes' wife and
male friend are both suspected in the
recent rash of campus burglaries. He

said that Stanford police had tried to ob
tain a search warrant for the Suppes'
motel room but that the North County
District Attorney's Office had denied the
request.
District Attorney Ron Rico, asked
why the warrant had been denied, said
he could not comment until police com
plete the ongoing investigation of
Suppes.
A spokesman at North County Jail said
Suppes will be held until he posts bail,
unless a judge decides to release him on
supervised "own recognizance."
An O.R. release may be requested by
an officer of the court and confirmed or
denied by a judge, if the suspect is de
termined to be "of good character," ac
cording to Sgt. Howard DeSart of North
County Jail. The basic criterion is that
the suspect can be trusted to show up in
court.
DeSart said that an affidavit written by
Stanford police and submitted to North
County Jail does not include Niemeyer's
contention that Suppes may have com
mitted numerous crimes at Stanford.
"There's nothing substantial under his

arrest circumstances," DeSart said.
But he noted that Stanford police
could supplement the affidavit with
"additional charges or additional
suspicion" that might raise Suppes' bail
or prevent an O.R. release.
Niemeyer said students should call
police immediately if they see a
suspicious-looking person in any campus
residence. He offered descriptions of
Suppes and his wife and friend, saying
that anyone who has seen them on
campus should contact Detective Mike
Seamons at 497-9633.
Suppes is a six-foot-tall, thin white
male with brown wavy hair. His wife,
27, is a 5-foot-8, thin white brunette
who has recently dyed her hair red. She
has blue eyes and is listed at 110 lbs.
Suppes' friend is a 6-foot-2, thin
white male who used to have long hair
and a bushy moustache but now is clean
shaven and has short hair.
Niemeyer, asked how Stanford police
could provide such detailed descriptions
of Suppes' wife and friend despite the
fact that neither has been arrested,
replied, "We're cops."

court.
DeSart said that an affidavit written by
Stanford police and submitted to North
County Jail does not include Niemeyer's
contention that Suppes may have com
mitted numerous crimes at Stanford.
"There's nothing substantial under his

arrest circumstances," DeSart said.
But he noted that Stanford police
could supplement the affidavit with
"additional charges or additional
suspicion" that might raise Suppes' bail
or prevent an O.R. release.
Niemeyer said students should call
police immediately if they see a
suspicious-looking person in any campus
residence. He offered descriptions of
Suppes and his wife and friend, saying
that anyone who has seen them on
campus should contact Detective Mike
Seamons at 497-9633.
Suppes is a six-foot-tall, thin white
male with brown wavy hair. His wife,
27, is a 5-foot-8, thin white brunette
who has recently dyed her hair red. She
has blue eyes and is listed at 110 lbs.
Suppes' friend is a 6-foot-2, thin
white male who used to have long hair
and a bushy moustache but now is clean
shaven and has short hair.
Niemeyer, asked how Stanford police
could provide such detailed descriptions
of Suppes' wife and friend despite the
fact that neither has been arrested,
replied, "We're cops."
