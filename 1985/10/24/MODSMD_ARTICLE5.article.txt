# LOTSa Ways To Spend Your Time
## 
### AIMEE BERG 
Where would you choose to be
this Saturday in the wee hours of
the morning?
Picture this: the load is low, the
lights dimmed, and beginning at 2
a.m. you are guaranteed free com
puter time.
If this scene would send you
looping with joy, you belong at
LOTS.
To find your niche in the noctur
nal subculture at CERAS,
headquarters of the Low Overhead
Time Sharing (LOTS) computer
system, you don't even need an ur
gent class assignment.
"There are people who come to
LOTS just to be at LOTS," said a
senior consultant who, like many
who enjoy the anonymity of a com
puter screen, asked not to be
named.
"They feel very familiar with the
place. It's sort of like their home.
They talk across the aisles as if
they were in a dorm," one instruc
tor in the Computer Science De

LOTS groupies like this one occupy a nocturnal niche in the Stanford population because the
computer terminals to which they flock so eagerly are less crowded from very late night to early
morning.
partment said.
Many groupies cited boredom as
their main motivation for hanging
out at LOTS.
"When you have absolutely noth
ing to do, it's easy to play games or
send electronic mail," said senior
Sue Glueck, a summer groupie.
Groupies with open accounts
don't need anything but the com
puter screen to make a fun evening.
"I don't bring anything else be
cause I don't need anything else.
There's no need to put a quarter in
the terminal or anything," an avid
game player explained at 2:30 a.m.
The pizza by his side was clearly
optional.
Free time is mandatory if you
want to be a groupie.
"I knew a guy who sat down (at
the computer) at 2 p.m. one Satur
day and didn't leave until 4 p.m. the
next day,"the game player remem
bered.
Being a groupie at LOTS will re
quire lots of your free time. Free
time, computer time not charged to
one's LOTS account, is available at
CERAS between 2 a.m. and 10
a.m.
"There is a changeover of people
at 2 a.m. People with no allocation
left now come in, and those with
time remaining go to bed," a senior
consultant said.
Want To Play a Game?
Of all the groupies, the game
players are the easiest to identify.
"They seem to be attracted to
low loads. High loads limit their
play. They tend to show up as the
week progresses toward the
weekend," said electrical engineer
ing major Amir Najmi, a LOTS con
sultant.
The graphic displays on the
screen aren't the only giveaway for
game-playing groupies.
"Some of them are pretty regu

lar. You get to recognize their faces
or their screams," Najmi said.
"Adventure games are a great
outlet for problem solving and en
joyment. You can just sit back and
find different ways to die," said
Rick McLeod, a fourth-year
graduate student in aeronautics.
Game groupies have different
playing styles.
"Some attack while others like to
(passively) watch things blow up,"
McLeod added.
"They seem to share some en
thusiasm when a character is hit,"
Najmi said.
"You can also do social things on
the computer, like debate an issue
back and forth. It can get pretty vi
olent," the game player said.
The groupies who spent their
time socializing are less competi
tive.
Neither Rain nor Hail
The first step in forming com
puter friendships is learning the
other groupies by their user names.
All system users can find out who
is logged on via a command called
FINGER.
"You eventually learn to associ
ate who's who," said Tom Steuber,
a faculty liaison at LOTS.
Interesting user names and loca
tions often get responses.
"Sometimes instead of their real
location, people will put in a funny
blurb like Motel 6,' " said Glueck,
who majors in industrial engineer
ing.
Over the summer, Glueck and at
least 15 other groupies would
phone in by modem or go to LOTS
in person during the middle of the
night strictly to send electronic
mail.
"I'd spend time 'chatting' late at
night almost every other night. I
found myself confiding in total
strangers," Glueck said.
"But now I know everyone I
communicated with. We used to get
together for dinner during the
week," she said.

"It's easy to talk to people you
don't know that well when you can't
see them. You also have more time
to think about what you're saying
on the screen. You can edit it, too,"
she added.
Some groupies think this kind of
communication is even more effec
tive than talking in person.
"You can phone somebody, and
they might not be home. You can
visit someone, and they won't be
in. But if you send an electronic let
ter, at least you know it will eventu
ally be read," said junior Jeff
Soesbe, a student consultant who
majors in drama.
"In class you learn about the
MAIL and SEND commands, but
there are handouts available at
CERAS that give you the basics,"
Glueck said.
There's LOTS To Do
LOTS is open for a wider variety
of users than just game players and
people who use LOTS as a mode of
interpersonal communication.
"There are also people who go
there for the sheer enjoyment of
writing programs that are not re
quired," said a computer science in
structor.
"Other people are there to be
around when there are problems.
They just like to help people. They
also let it be known that they like to
be answering questions because
they sit at the consultants' desks
even though they are not (official)
consultants."
"There are various people who
come to LOTS to sleep on the
couches, but police (usually) take
care of that," a senior consultant
said.
In the end, groupies are not gen
erally viewed as bothersome â€”
with the exception of the occasional
screamer.
"If you have to be here at an
insane hour, it's nice to have others
around," Steuber said.
