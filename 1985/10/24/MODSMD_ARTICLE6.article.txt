# Student Named 'Amigo of the Year'
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Staff writer 
Selected from a list of more than 400 volun
teers in six countries, junior Mandy Alvarado has
been named "Amigo of the Year" by Amigos de
las Americas for her work in the Dominican
Republic this summer.
In addition to her work in a latrine-building
project, she "contributed much more to the com
munity, " according to Sue Beekley, the Univer
sity's contact with the Peninsula chapter of
Amigos.
"I was shocked and surprised," Alvarado said
of receiving the award. She went on the
weekend of Oct. 12 to the organization's 20th
anniversary reunion in Houston, where she
received "Words to Love By," a book written by
Nobel Peace Prize winner Mother Teresa.
The latrine program included teaching the
people about sanitation. "We would remind
people to cover the food after preparing it, since
there were no refrigerators, and to wash their
hands throughout the day," Alvarado said.
"People don't understand how important the
information is," she added. "It's amazing how
much that can cut the disease rate. . . . Fifty
percent of Third World mortality is from
parasites caused by bacteria."
Alvarado did most of her extra work during
her first few days in the Dominican Republic
while the volunteers waited for the supplies to

arrive. "I can't look'back and say, 'I had an op
portunity but I just sat there,' " Alvarado said.
Alvarado and the other volunteers first
noticed that her host family had a public garbage
dump in their backyard. It was a sanitation prob
lem because "it wasn't closed off so animals
could get in there . . . including a tarantula," she
said. The volunteers spent three days cleaning it
up.
She also taught a daily English class. "On the
first day over 100 people showed up, ages five to
50. . . . Everyone wanted to learn," Alvarado
said.
Alvarado promoted a four-day reading cam
paign in which she and other volunteers wrote
out invitations to the library, a largely unused
resource in the town. After a child read for an
hour, an Amigo volunteer would ask questions
about the book. Then the child would receive a
sticker, a balloon or perhaps a chocolate chip
cookie that Alvarado managed to make. "I found
all the ingredients: I just chopped up a bar of
chocolate and it worked fine. The kids loved
them," she said.
Alvarado was also impressed by the
Dominicans' culture. "The Dominicans are very
warm people. They want to show foreigners the
beauty of their culture through themselves."
The townspeople offered her many tropical
drinks during her stay as part of their hospitality.
"Some (drinks) were nasty, like vinegar. I felt
like I was drinking Easter Egg coloring solution.

But others were great; sometimes my partners
and I would go from eight to 10 houses, just
having drink after drink," Alvarado said.
"But life there was not all easy by any means,"
she said. "The heat is so bad, you never stop
sweating from the time you get up until the time
you go to bed. And there were mosquitoes
everywhere. The volunteers were covered with
mosquito bites from head to toe. Sometimes the
water could make you sick, too."
Because Alvarado's original host family could
not afford to feed her and her two partners, they
had to move. "It caused a town uprising because
they thought we didn't like them. Our health
promoter started yelling at me in the middle of
the street. I had to refrain from crying, to show
that I was tough. You're given a hell of a lot of re
sponsibility, and you really do mature," Alvarado
said.
"I think that more young adults are looking for
an alternative to the nine-to-five office job. You
can show other cultures that Americans aren't all
the rich kids and cowboys that you see in the
movies," she said.
Alvarado is majoring in Spanish and interna
tional relations with a Third World emphasis. She
is considering joining a Peace Corps program in
literacy in Latin America. "There is at least 37
percent illiteracy in the Dominican Republic, so
that type of program is really needed," she said.
Amigos is planning to form a Stanford chapter
this year, according to Beekley.

percent of Third World mortality is from
parasites caused by bacteria."
Alvarado did most of her extra work during
her first few days in the Dominican Republic
while the volunteers waited for the supplies to

arrive. "I can't look'back and say, 'I had an op
portunity but I just sat there,' " Alvarado said.
Alvarado and the other volunteers first
noticed that her host family had a public garbage
dump in their backyard. It was a sanitation prob
lem because "it wasn't closed off so animals
could get in there . . . including a tarantula," she
said. The volunteers spent three days cleaning it
up.
She also taught a daily English class. "On the
first day over 100 people showed up, ages five to
50. . . . Everyone wanted to learn," Alvarado
said.
Alvarado promoted a four-day reading cam
paign in which she and other volunteers wrote
out invitations to the library, a largely unused
resource in the town. After a child read for an
hour, an Amigo volunteer would ask questions
about the book. Then the child would receive a
sticker, a balloon or perhaps a chocolate chip
cookie that Alvarado managed to make. "I found
all the ingredients: I just chopped up a bar of
chocolate and it worked fine. The kids loved
them," she said.
Alvarado was also impressed by the
Dominicans' culture. "The Dominicans are very
warm people. They want to show foreigners the
beauty of their culture through themselves."
The townspeople offered her many tropical
drinks during her stay as part of their hospitality.
"Some (drinks) were nasty, like vinegar. I felt
like I was drinking Easter Egg coloring solution.

But others were great; sometimes my partners
and I would go from eight to 10 houses, just
having drink after drink," Alvarado said.
"But life there was not all easy by any means,"
she said. "The heat is so bad, you never stop
sweating from the time you get up until the time
you go to bed. And there were mosquitoes
everywhere. The volunteers were covered with
mosquito bites from head to toe. Sometimes the
water could make you sick, too."
Because Alvarado's original host family could
not afford to feed her and her two partners, they
had to move. "It caused a town uprising because
they thought we didn't like them. Our health
promoter started yelling at me in the middle of
the street. I had to refrain from crying, to show
that I was tough. You're given a hell of a lot of re
sponsibility, and you really do mature," Alvarado
said.
"I think that more young adults are looking for
an alternative to the nine-to-five office job. You
can show other cultures that Americans aren't all
the rich kids and cowboys that you see in the
movies," she said.
Alvarado is majoring in Spanish and interna
tional relations with a Third World emphasis. She
is considering joining a Peace Corps program in
literacy in Latin America. "There is at least 37
percent illiteracy in the Dominican Republic, so
that type of program is really needed," she said.
Amigos is planning to form a Stanford chapter
this year, according to Beekley.
