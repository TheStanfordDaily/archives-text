A sit-in yesterday in protest of
University holdings in South
Africa-related stock and the al
leged mistreatment of arrested
students by police Oct. 11 lasted
one-and-a-half hours but resulted in
no arrests.
About 50 demonstrators gath
ered outside of Old Union at 4 p.m.,
and by 5:10, when Registrar Sally
Mahoney asked those sitting in —
20 students and Statistics Prof.
Charles Stein — to exit the build
ing. only graduate student Eric Die

sel opted to remain.
While police waited and a crowd
of more than 50 chanted outside the
locked doors of Old Union, Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons at
tempted to persuade Diesel to
avoid arrest by leaving the building.
Diesel, who has been arrested
twice for apartheid protests, cried
as Lyons spoke to him. Diesel fi
nally agreed to leave the building at
5:30.
Lyons told Diesel that Sgt. Nick
Brunot, a Stanford police officer
whom Diesel and other demonstra
tors said used brutal force to break
up an Oct. 11 sit-in, may be as
signed to desk duty as a result of a

University investigation.
Diesel said later that Lyons' talk
influenced his decision to leave Old
Union.
Diesel said that his previous ar
rests played no part in his decision.
Stanford Out of South Africa
member David Romo explained that
the purpose of the sit-in was "to let
the University know that we're
maintaining vigilance."
Several protesters also signed a
circulated petition that calls for a
Judicial Council investigation of
"James Lyons, Sally Mahoney and
all Stanford administrators involved
with police brutality on October
11."
