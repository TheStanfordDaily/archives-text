It was only appropriate this week that Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons announced that stu
dents arrested in three recent sit-ins at Old Union
would not be subject to campus judicial charges.
While legal action is and must be the University's
prerogative, the right of students to participate in
non-violent protest — even if it means breaking the
law — is a personal choice worthy of protection.
It is in this context that Lyon's other announce
ment — that the University's Fundamental Standard
may be applied to future civil disobedience protests
— is cause for concern. Because the Fundamental
Standard's "Policy on Campus Disruption" gives
Lyons the right to make that statement, the Funda
mental Standard itself needs to be revised.
Established in 1906, the Fundamental Standard
has been applied to a variety of situations, including
incidents of theft, vandalism and drunk driving. The
disruption policy was added in 1967 and includes at
least one passage directly applicable to civil dis
obedience protests: "Members of the faculty, staff

and student body have an obligation to leave a Uni
versity building or facility" when asked to do so "by
a member of the University community acting in an
official role." Violations may be grounds for expul
sion.
It is undoubtedly hypocritical for a University
whose president urges students to "question au
thority" to deny students the right to protest in a
non-violent manner those policies they deem unjust,
regardless of whether they are legally at fault. Aca
demic penalty and legal penalty are not the same.
Sometimes the most effective way to challenge an
unjust law is often to break that law, as Henry David
Thoreau, Martin Luther King, Jr. and others have
shown. Some Stanford students and faculty mem
bers, including those who participated in the sit-ins
at Old Union, feel the best way to make the Univer
sity re-examine its investment policy is to break the
law. For them to be restricted to University sugges
ted and authorized protests would defeat the pur
pose, which is to provoke a response from the Uni
versity itself.
