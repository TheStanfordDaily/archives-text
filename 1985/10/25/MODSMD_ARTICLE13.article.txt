# Cuba Could Be a Friend If Only We'd Let It
## 
### 
This is the 23rd anniversary of the Cuban Missile
Crisis, a fitting time to examine the history of our rela
tionship with the island nation that brought us to the
very edge of Armageddon.
The relevant recent history of Cuba begins in 1952
when Gen. Fulgencio Batista engineered a bloodless
coup and became dictator of Cuba. In 1956, Fidel
Castro, starting with a motley crew of 82 guerrillas,
began a movement that by 1959 had ousted Batista and
"liberated" the island. After the revolution, Castro
wanted good relations with the United States and in-

sisted that he was not a communist. With increasing
hostility from the United States however, he found
himself leaning more and more to the left and depend
ing more and more heavily on the Soviet Union for eco
nomic and defensive support.
In April 1961 the CIA launched its infamous "Bay of
Pigs" invasion. The CIA trained 1,500 Cuban exiles in
Florida and Guatemala and launched them in an inva
sion of Cuba, hoping to topple Castro in the same easy
way that they had toppled a Guatemalan regime in
1954. The CIA badly misjudged the popularity of the
new regime, however. Instead of rising in support
of the invaders, the Cuban populace helped rout the in
vading exiles. Within 72 hours, the entire invading
force was captured. The invasion was an operation so

thoughtiessly planned and executed that President
Kennedy found it impossible to explain, asking later:
"How could I have been so stupid to let them go
ahead?"
It was only after this debacle that Castro declared: "I
am a Marxist-Leninist and I will remain one until the
end of my life." In order to ensure against the over
throw of the revolutionary government, Cubans gladly
welcomed the installation of Soviet intercontinental bal
listic missiles, hoping to secure themselves under the
nuclear umbrella of the Soviet Union.
After the Soviet missiles arrived in Cuba and many
threats were exchanged between the two super
powers, the world was on the brink of a nuclear
holocaust.
Finally, the Soviets agreed to halt the shipment of
nuclear weapons to Cuba and to dismantle and remove
those missiles already deployed. In exhange, a U.S.
naval blockade of the island was withdrawn, and the
United States pledged not to invade Cuba. The world
had been brought to the edge of self-destruction. And
the Cuban revolution had been saved.
Marxism is a failure. This is clear when one looks at
the countries that have now practiced the theory for
many years. Compare the economies of North and
South Korea, or Taiwan and China. Karl Marx has been
put the test and has fallen short. Marxism leads to
some early gains at first by distributing resources more
equitably. But that is where the benefits end and the
troubles begin. People work for their own good. That
is a fact of life. Removing the possibility of improving
one's own economic situation by working harder
removes one's incentive to produce and results in a
stunted economy.
A free enterprise economy is perhaps the closest
thing to a true democracy. People affect the economy
through the vote of their dollar — ventures that people
spend money on succeed, and those without financial

backing fail. Although there may be a poor distribution
of wealth, the free enterprise system results in the
fastest economic growth. People have a strong in
centive to be productive, resulting in increased produc
tivity for the society overall. Paradoxically, when the
overall standard of living reaches a certain level, the
natural tendency for free societies is to become more
socialist, helping those in the country who are less for
tunate through social security, welfare and health pro
grams. This has been the case in Sweden, Switzerland,
Germany, France, England, Austrailia, Canada and
many of our allies in the Western world.
The Chinese have learned their lesson, and with the
lessening of tensions between them and the West,
have been able to implement some aspects of a free en
terprise system with a resulting meteoric rise in the
standard of living. Private Chinese companies are
beginning to sell shares, and millionaires are reappear
ing on the scene. People are encouraged to make
money and urged not to save, but spend. "It does not
matter what color the cat is, as long as it catches
mice," says Deng Xiaoping, emphasizing pragmatism
over Marxist ideology. Even in the Soviet Union, Com
munist Party General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev is
leaning toward a more decentralized economy. In
Cuba, workers are now allowed to own their own
homes. Productive workers are rewarded with higher
pay, and the less productive threatened with dismissal.
The important factor the United States should con
sider when establishing foreign policy is not whether a
country is Marxist or democratic, but whether the
leaders are nationalists who put the needs of their
country and their people first. They may be Marxist in
orientation at first but will change as they realize the
failings of the Marxist system — if we allow them to.
Even though we disagree with other countries on
forms of government, we need not be adversarial in
our relationship. If our form of government is the bet

ter one, it will eventually prevail and need not be
propped up by force of arms. We need a leader who will
rise above politics, not a reactionary cowboy who
shoots from the hip, flouts international law, ignores
the World Court and stoops to savergery and lawless
terrorism. Marxism and capitalism can and should be
allowed to coexist. And, God willing, our form of gov
ernment will prevail if we are right. We should not let
differences in government divide us. We should work
for the common good of man.
As we bridged the Cold War with China, so too
should we bridge the differences that separate us from
Cuba, a country only 90 miles from our shores. We
should look past the label of Marxism and try to under
stand the concerns and nationalist desires of nations
and their people. We should begin by securing this
hemisphere by creating a brotherhood of nations that
tolerates diversity. Both Cuba and Nicaragua are tied
to the United States historically, geographically and
emotionally. If we can give them our support and
friendship, it will give them the freedom to align them
selves closer to us. It has worked in China, and it can
work here also — if we let it.
There is an old Chinese saying: "A journey of a
thousand miles begins with a single step." Let us take
that first step by ending our hostility toward Cuba. Let
us begin by ending our trade embargo and lifting travel
restrictions to Cuba. Let us attempt to make this hemi
sphere and the world a safer place, not through force of
arms, but through friendship, cooperation and leader
ship. Castro is extending his hand toward the United
States, hoping to improve relations between our two
countries. Let us not lose this opportunity to grasp it in
friendship — and bring Cuba back into the American
fold. After all, what do we have to lose?

shoots from the hip, flouts international law, ignores
the World Court and stoops to savergery and lawless
terrorism. Marxism and capitalism can and should be
allowed to coexist. And, God willing, our form of gov
ernment will prevail if we are right. We should not let
differences in government divide us. We should work
for the common good of man.
As we bridged the Cold War with China, so too
should we bridge the differences that separate us from
Cuba, a country only 90 miles from our shores. We
should look past the label of Marxism and try to under
stand the concerns and nationalist desires of nations
and their people. We should begin by securing this
hemisphere by creating a brotherhood of nations that
tolerates diversity. Both Cuba and Nicaragua are tied
to the United States historically, geographically and
emotionally. If we can give them our support and
friendship, it will give them the freedom to align them
selves closer to us. It has worked in China, and it can
work here also — if we let it.
There is an old Chinese saying: "A journey of a
thousand miles begins with a single step." Let us take
that first step by ending our hostility toward Cuba. Let
us begin by ending our trade embargo and lifting travel
restrictions to Cuba. Let us attempt to make this hemi
sphere and the world a safer place, not through force of
arms, but through friendship, cooperation and leader
ship. Castro is extending his hand toward the United
States, hoping to improve relations between our two
countries. Let us not lose this opportunity to grasp it in
friendship — and bring Cuba back into the American
fold. After all, what do we have to lose?

This is the 23rd anniversary of the Cuban Missile
Crisis, a fitting time to examine the history of our rela
tionship with the island nation that brought us to the
very edge of Armageddon.
The relevant recent history of Cuba begins in 1952
when Gen. Fulgencio Batista engineered a bloodless
coup and became dictator of Cuba. In 1956, Fidel
Castro, starting with a motley crew of 82 guerrillas,
began a movement that by 1959 had ousted Batista and
"liberated" the island. After the revolution, Castro
wanted good relations with the United States and in-

sisted that he was not a communist. With increasing
hostility from the United States however, he found
himself leaning more and more to the left and depend
ing more and more heavily on the Soviet Union for eco
nomic and defensive support.
In April 1961 the CIA launched its infamous "Bay of
Pigs" invasion. The CIA trained 1,500 Cuban exiles in
Florida and Guatemala and launched them in an inva
sion of Cuba, hoping to topple Castro in the same easy
way that they had toppled a Guatemalan regime in
1954. The CIA badly misjudged the popularity of the
new regime, however. Instead of rising in support
of the invaders, the Cuban populace helped rout the in
vading exiles. Within 72 hours, the entire invading
force was captured. The invasion was an operation so

thoughtiessly planned and executed that President
Kennedy found it impossible to explain, asking later:
"How could I have been so stupid to let them go
ahead?"
It was only after this debacle that Castro declared: "I
am a Marxist-Leninist and I will remain one until the
end of my life." In order to ensure against the over
throw of the revolutionary government, Cubans gladly
welcomed the installation of Soviet intercontinental bal
listic missiles, hoping to secure themselves under the
nuclear umbrella of the Soviet Union.
After the Soviet missiles arrived in Cuba and many
threats were exchanged between the two super
powers, the world was on the brink of a nuclear
holocaust.
Finally, the Soviets agreed to halt the shipment of
nuclear weapons to Cuba and to dismantle and remove
those missiles already deployed. In exhange, a U.S.
naval blockade of the island was withdrawn, and the
United States pledged not to invade Cuba. The world
had been brought to the edge of self-destruction. And
the Cuban revolution had been saved.
Marxism is a failure. This is clear when one looks at
the countries that have now practiced the theory for
many years. Compare the economies of North and
South Korea, or Taiwan and China. Karl Marx has been
put the test and has fallen short. Marxism leads to
some early gains at first by distributing resources more
equitably. But that is where the benefits end and the
troubles begin. People work for their own good. That
is a fact of life. Removing the possibility of improving
one's own economic situation by working harder
removes one's incentive to produce and results in a
stunted economy.
A free enterprise economy is perhaps the closest
thing to a true democracy. People affect the economy
through the vote of their dollar — ventures that people
spend money on succeed, and those without financial

backing fail. Although there may be a poor distribution
of wealth, the free enterprise system results in the
fastest economic growth. People have a strong in
centive to be productive, resulting in increased produc
tivity for the society overall. Paradoxically, when the
overall standard of living reaches a certain level, the
natural tendency for free societies is to become more
socialist, helping those in the country who are less for
tunate through social security, welfare and health pro
grams. This has been the case in Sweden, Switzerland,
Germany, France, England, Austrailia, Canada and
many of our allies in the Western world.
The Chinese have learned their lesson, and with the
lessening of tensions between them and the West,
have been able to implement some aspects of a free en
terprise system with a resulting meteoric rise in the
standard of living. Private Chinese companies are
beginning to sell shares, and millionaires are reappear
ing on the scene. People are encouraged to make
money and urged not to save, but spend. "It does not
matter what color the cat is, as long as it catches
mice," says Deng Xiaoping, emphasizing pragmatism
over Marxist ideology. Even in the Soviet Union, Com
munist Party General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev is
leaning toward a more decentralized economy. In
Cuba, workers are now allowed to own their own
homes. Productive workers are rewarded with higher
pay, and the less productive threatened with dismissal.
The important factor the United States should con
sider when establishing foreign policy is not whether a
country is Marxist or democratic, but whether the
leaders are nationalists who put the needs of their
country and their people first. They may be Marxist in
orientation at first but will change as they realize the
failings of the Marxist system — if we allow them to.
Even though we disagree with other countries on
forms of government, we need not be adversarial in
our relationship. If our form of government is the bet

ter one, it will eventually prevail and need not be
propped up by force of arms. We need a leader who will
rise above politics, not a reactionary cowboy who
shoots from the hip, flouts international law, ignores
the World Court and stoops to savergery and lawless
terrorism. Marxism and capitalism can and should be
allowed to coexist. And, God willing, our form of gov
ernment will prevail if we are right. We should not let
differences in government divide us. We should work
