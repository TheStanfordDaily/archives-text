# AUSTIN, HOWE
## Tresidder Responds to Student Concerns 
### 
Much has been written about
Tresidder Union's food services in
the last few weeks. The purpose of
this letter is to help provide some
basic information about the food
services. We hope it will help mem
bers of the Stanford community un
derstand our goals and our plans for
changes in the food services coming
later this year.

VIEWPOINT

What are our prime goals for
Tresidder's food services? At the
top of the list is our desire to pro
vide a gathering place for students,
faculty and staff while supplying
food at reasonable prices with
pleasant, knowledgeable and effi
cient staff. Also important, we want
to provide a variety of services and
menu items, convenient hours,
quick service, responsiveness to
customers and the opportunity for
significant student involvement.
Student involvement is central to
the operation of the food services
and critical to their success. As an
educational institution, we are com
mitted to providing learning and
employment opportunities for stu
dents. We do this by providing jobs,
management opportunities and
volunteer positions. The involve
ment of students in our operations
ensures that our services are
responsive to the needs of those
who use our services.
Tresidder's food services reflect
the student environment in a num
ber of ways. Well over half of

Tresidder food service customers
are students. Eighty-nine percent
of the student body has eaten at the
Coffee House and 80 percent at the
Corner Pocket. Tresidder food
services employ approximately 200
students, including about 15 stu
dent managers who have significant
operational responsibility. The stu
dent managers hire and train staff,
develop new products, implement
marketing strategies, manage in
ventories and supervise production
and service areas. In the Corner
Pocket and Patio Grill, all
employees are students. In the
Coffee House, about 85 percent of
the employees are students.
The present level of student in
volvement in the food services is
unprecedented. No other educa
tional institution has been found to
have as many students involved in
significant management and deci
sion making opportunities. In par
ticular, the high level of student in
volvement at the Coffee House and
the entrepreneurial organization of
the Corner Pocket are unique to
Stanford.
Policy issues are also overseen
by students. The Tresidder Union
Board deliberates policy and long
range planning issues for the union.
It is the only University committee
chaired by a student and composed
of a student majority. Likewise, the
board's sub-committee, the Food
Committee, has a student chairman
and a student majority. In recent
years, the Food Committee has had
a major impact on the food

services. It oversaw a major
renovation in Union Crossroads, in
stituted the Corner Pocket,
developed Baker Street and over
saw the entire food bid process.
These activities were directed by
students and created additional op
portunities for student use and em
ployment and management oppor
tunities.
The change in the contractor for
Tresidder's food services has
raised concerns about food quality,
selection and prices. With a change
in operators, we expect to see im
provement. At the Coffee House,
sandwich and salad portions have
been increased while prices that
have been in effect for a year have
been maintained. Cheese, fruit
boards and a greater selection of
beers have been added to the
menu. Additional menu items are in
the planning stage.
Prices are always an important
factor. They are closely monitored
by the University. Prices in the
Coffee House, Baker Street and
the Corner Pocket are the same as
last year. True, some prices have
increased in the Grand Market
place, but we think a comparison
with comparable establishments
speaks for itself.
It's important to remember that
the food services in Tresidder
Union are provided and overseen
by the University. They are
operated by a contractor as a ser
vice to the Stanford community
and, as such, are expected to meet
the goals and expectations estab

lished by the University. The Uni
versity approves hours, prices,
menu and service changes, always
keeping in mind the needs of the
campus community. Suggestion
boxes are available in all the food
services, and replies are regularly
written and posted. The Food
Committee regularly monitors the
Coffee House, and a food tasting
group regularly rates the quality of
the food and the service. We care
about the quality of the service pro
vided at Stanford and continually
strive to provide our customers
with the best possible service.
We think the food services are
already providing a quality service
to the community, but we continu
ally strive to be responsive to the
campus community by changing the
services as needs change. To this
end, we think you'll be pleased
about pending changes. Remodel
ing in the Grand Marketplace, for
example, will continue with the
relocation of the beverage area, ex
pansion of the salad bar, addition of
more high quality take-out items
and improvement of the deli bar.
In the final analysis, it's results
that count. High food quality, a
friendly and helpful staff and
reasonable prices are of the
greatest importance. These factors
will determine the ultimate success
of Tresidder Union's food services.

Much has been written about
Tresidder Union's food services in
the last few weeks. The purpose of
this letter is to help provide some
basic information about the food
services. We hope it will help mem
bers of the Stanford community un
derstand our goals and our plans for
changes in the food services coming
later this year.

VIEWPOINT

What are our prime goals for
Tresidder's food services? At the
top of the list is our desire to pro
vide a gathering place for students,
faculty and staff while supplying
food at reasonable prices with
pleasant, knowledgeable and effi
cient staff. Also important, we want
to provide a variety of services and
menu items, convenient hours,
quick service, responsiveness to
customers and the opportunity for
significant student involvement.
Student involvement is central to
the operation of the food services
and critical to their success. As an
educational institution, we are com
mitted to providing learning and
employment opportunities for stu
dents. We do this by providing jobs,
management opportunities and
volunteer positions. The involve
ment of students in our operations
ensures that our services are
responsive to the needs of those
who use our services.
Tresidder's food services reflect
the student environment in a num
ber of ways. Well over half of

Tresidder food service customers
are students. Eighty-nine percent
of the student body has eaten at the
Coffee House and 80 percent at the
Corner Pocket. Tresidder food
services employ approximately 200
students, including about 15 stu
dent managers who have significant
operational responsibility. The stu
dent managers hire and train staff,
develop new products, implement
marketing strategies, manage in
ventories and supervise production
and service areas. In the Corner
Pocket and Patio Grill, all
employees are students. In the
Coffee House, about 85 percent of
the employees are students.
The present level of student in
volvement in the food services is
unprecedented. No other educa
tional institution has been found to
have as many students involved in
significant management and deci
sion making opportunities. In par
ticular, the high level of student in
volvement at the Coffee House and
the entrepreneurial organization of
the Corner Pocket are unique to
Stanford.
Policy issues are also overseen
by students. The Tresidder Union
Board deliberates policy and long
range planning issues for the union.
It is the only University committee
chaired by a student and composed
of a student majority. Likewise, the
board's sub-committee, the Food
Committee, has a student chairman
and a student majority. In recent
years, the Food Committee has had
a major impact on the food

services. It oversaw a major
renovation in Union Crossroads, in
stituted the Corner Pocket,
developed Baker Street and over
saw the entire food bid process.
These activities were directed by
students and created additional op
portunities for student use and em
ployment and management oppor
tunities.
The change in the contractor for
Tresidder's food services has
raised concerns about food quality,
selection and prices. With a change
in operators, we expect to see im
provement. At the Coffee House,
sandwich and salad portions have
been increased while prices that
have been in effect for a year have
been maintained. Cheese, fruit
boards and a greater selection of
beers have been added to the
menu. Additional menu items are in
the planning stage.
Prices are always an important
factor. They are closely monitored
by the University. Prices in the
Coffee House, Baker Street and
the Corner Pocket are the same as
last year. True, some prices have
increased in the Grand Market
place, but we think a comparison
with comparable establishments
speaks for itself.
It's important to remember that
the food services in Tresidder
Union are provided and overseen
by the University. They are
operated by a contractor as a ser
vice to the Stanford community
and, as such, are expected to meet
the goals and expectations estab

lished by the University. The Uni
versity approves hours, prices,
menu and service changes, always
keeping in mind the needs of the
campus community. Suggestion
boxes are available in all the food
services, and replies are regularly
written and posted. The Food
Committee regularly monitors the
Coffee House, and a food tasting
group regularly rates the quality of
the food and the service. We care
about the quality of the service pro
vided at Stanford and continually
strive to provide our customers
with the best possible service.
We think the food services are
already providing a quality service
to the community, but we continu
ally strive to be responsive to the
campus community by changing the
services as needs change. To this
end, we think you'll be pleased
about pending changes. Remodel
ing in the Grand Marketplace, for
example, will continue with the
relocation of the beverage area, ex
pansion of the salad bar, addition of
more high quality take-out items
and improvement of the deli bar.
In the final analysis, it's results
that count. High food quality, a
friendly and helpful staff and
reasonable prices are of the
greatest importance. These factors
will determine the ultimate success
of Tresidder Union's food services.
