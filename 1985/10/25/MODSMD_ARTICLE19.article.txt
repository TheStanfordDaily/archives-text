## Stanford Did More Than Horse Around 
### SCOTT ROTH Staff writer 
The Stanford Barn lies in a rather
obscure location behind Governor's Cor
ner, but occupies a prominent space in
history as the birthplace of the motion
picture.
The Stanford Barn, a red Victorian
style building, was declared a California
Historical Landmark in 1983.
From 1878 to 1879, Gov. Leland Stan
ford conducted an experiment to settle a
bet with a friend. Stanford contended
that, at some point, all four legs of a horse
were off the ground. To prove his point,
Stanford commissioned Eadweard
Muybridge to construct a series of
cameras, each with a trip wire trigger. As
the horse trotted past, his feet set of the
cameras and a series of short interval
pictures were taken.
The pictures proved Stanford right, and
now, by Stanford's indirect help, there's
something to do in Memorial Auditorium
on Sunday nights besides throwing paper
airplanes.
The invention of the motion picture is
just one chapter in the colorful history of
the present-day Stanford Equestrian Cen
ter. In 1876, Gov. Stanford purchased
8,800 acres to be used as a stock and
breeding farm. Later, of course, it
became the University.
The original purchases were made up of
two properties, the Gordon property and
the Hoag ranch. These parcels en

compassed an area of land that stretched
from what is now Junipero Serra
Boulevard to El Camino Real, and from
San Francisquito Creek to near Galvez
Street.
The farm, known as the Palo Alto Stock
Farm, operated from 1876 to 1903, and
was at its peak between 1880 and 1891.
Once the Stanfords took over their new

property, they enlarged the house on the
Gordon's property, which was located
near the current Children's Hospital.
Gov. Stanford bought the property so
he could breed and train his trotting
horses. Stanford thought a more produc
tive horse would boost the U.S. economy.
He built his stock farm into one of the
country's largest and most productive by

employing his huge financial resources
and his innovative "Palo Alto System,"
which employed selective breeding and
training.
This system included keeping accurate
breeding records and training the animals
at full speed for short distances, rather
that at half-speed for long distances.
During the farm's height, many record
holding horses were produced. Among
them was Electioneer, whose image is
captured in a statue outside the stables.
Charles Marvin, then-superintendent of
the stables, called Electioneer "the
greatest of all trotting sires." Electioneer
was also the mainstay of the breeding pro
gram. He fathered nine of the 13 world
record champions bred at Stanford.
As the farm grew, so did its needs. In
or around 1878, a 115-million gallon reser
voir was dug to supply water to Stanford's
crops, vineyards and orchards. This res
ervoir was known as Lagunita.
Today, as it was then, Lake Lagunita is
supplied by a series of flumes, or small
channels with a flow controlled by gates,
which divert water from the San Fran
cisquito Creek.
In 1893 Gov. Stanford died, and with
him went the driving force behind the
farm. In order to raise money for the
financially strapped University, many stal
lions were sold at very low prices. A
horse named Advertiser, for which Stan
ford was once offered $150,000, was sold
for $2,800. And, with the departure of
Advertiser and the other horses, went the
glory of the Palo Alto farm.

This famous shot — one frame in the first motion picture sequence ever
produced — proved Gov. Leland Stanford correct in his belief that a run
ning horse had at one time all four feet off the ground.
