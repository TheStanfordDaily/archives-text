# Kaplan Loses Newsweek Suit
## 
### JULIE RYAN 
P. federal appeals court ruled yesterday that a
Newsweek article calling Law School Prof. John
Kaplan's criminal law class a "mick" was not
libelous, saying the article expressed opinions
that are not actionable as libel.
Kaplan originally filed a $1 million defamation
suit after an article in the October 1983
Newsweek on Campus listed his class among 11
"gut courses" at colleges around the country.
U.S. District Judge Robert Aguilar dismissed the
suit in August 1984, and yesterday's decision by
a three-member panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit

Court of Appeals in San Francisco upheld his
ruling.
"You win a few and you lose a few," Kaplan
said last night in reference to the decision. He
declined further comment.
Kaplan can now try to appeal to the Supreme
Court of the United States or ask for a rehear
ing, according to Assoc. Law School Dean Jack
Friedenthal. "It's up to John," he said.
The Newsweek article said Kaplan's course
was "recognized as the easiest five credits" at
Stanford. Though the article said Kaplan's
grading policy followed Stanford norms, it said of
the 11 courses in general that a student could
"study for about an hour and get a 98."

The decision by judges J. Blaine Anderson,
Dorthy Nelson and Chief Judge James Browning
said, "Criticism of the substance of a professor's
course should not be interpreted as defamatory
of the (professor) personally." They said assess
ments of the courses as "Mickey Mouse" and
similar language were expressiops of opinion,
which cannot be libelous.
The statement that a student could study for
an hour and get a 98 was "an obvious hyberbole
and a figurative description of an easy course,
not fairly readable as a literal statement of fact,"
the court said.
Friedenthal, who said he argued
the case before the court of appeals
"as a labor of love for a friend and
colleague," expressed disappoint
ment with the decision.
"I thought his case ought to go to
trial," Friedenthal said. "I suppose
anything you say is an opinion.
That's one easy way around any
claim of libel or defamation. In a
sense you can say anything you
want about anybody and if some
body calls it an opinion it's not
libel."
Friedenthal said he was not
surprised by the decision of the
court."I know a little bit about the
attitude of the 9th Circuit and of
courts in general on these matters,
and I really don't think they took
this case seriously," he said.
"John is flamboyant and dramatic
and people know him, so the ten
dency is to not take it as seriously,"
Friedenthal said. "It doesn't matter
that the guy may be really hurt. I
think that's unfair."
Communication Prof. Jeremy
Cohen, who teaches a course in
media law, said the case will not go
down as a major precedent. "It
could not be said to have estab
lished new boundaries of law."
