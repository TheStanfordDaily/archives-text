# Kaplan Loses Newsweek Suit
## 
### JULIE RYAN 
P. federal appeals court ruled yesterday that a
Newsweek article calling Law School Prof. John
Kaplan's criminal law class a "mick" was not
libelous, saying the article expressed opinions
that are not actionable as libel.
Kaplan originally filed a $1 million defamation
suit after an article in the October 1983
Newsweek on Campus listed his class among 11
"gut courses" at colleges around the country.
U.S. District Judge Robert Aguilar dismissed the
suit in August 1984, and yesterday's decision by
a three-member panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit

Court of Appeals in San Francisco upheld his
ruling.
"You win a few and you lose a few," Kaplan
said last night in reference to the decision. He
declined further comment.
Kaplan can now try to appeal to the Supreme
Court of the United States or ask for a rehear
ing, according to Assoc. Law School Dean Jack
Friedenthal. "It's up to John," he said.
The Newsweek article said Kaplan's course
was "recognized as the easiest five credits" at
Stanford. Though the article said Kaplan's
grading policy followed Stanford norms, it said of
the 11 courses in general that a student could
"study for about an hour and get a 98."

The decision by judges J. Blaine Anderson,
Dorthy Nelson and Chief Judge James Browning
said, "Criticism of the substance of a professor's
course should not be interpreted as defamatory
of the (professor) personally." They said assess
ments of the courses as "Mickey Mouse" and
similar language were expressiops of opinion,
which cannot be libelous.
The statement that a student could study for
an hour and get a 98 was "an obvious hyberbole
and a figurative description of an easy course,
not fairly readable as a literal statement of fact,"
the court said.
