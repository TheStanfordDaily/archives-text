## Magic Makes Best of Shepard's 'Buried Child' 
### NANCY HENRY Editorial staff 
Sam Shepard is a playwright whose plays reflect a
preoccupation with numerous profound, universal and
mythological themes. His plays also demonstrate a fine
technical skill and a particularly keen sense of lan
guage. The problem, in a play as thematically ambitious
as the Pulitzer Prize-winning "Buried Child," is that
the latter has not caught up with the former, and the
result is a piece so heavily laden with symbolism and so
rich in unconnected meanings that the purpose is lost.
This is the flaw inherent in the script; the Magic
Theatre, however, in its revival of "Buried Child,"
transcends many of the difficulties, offering a
sensitively directed and at times superbly acted pro
duction.
"Buried Child" is by no means a play without
structure or unity. It tackles the most popular and tired
theme of the 20th century American stage — the
demise of the American family — yet it does so in an
innovative and captivating way. The characters are
stereotypes; but beyond that they are reductions of
human types to their most basic, their most mythic ele
ments.
The character Dodge is an embodiment of the dying
patriarch myth. Lying on the couch of his hard-earned
American home, staring vacantly at the eternal glow of
the television — hacking, choking, smoking and drink
ing, he engages in senseless conversation with his wife
solely out of boredom. His wife Halie is a fading
beauty, feeding on romanticized memories of the past,

ignoring the reality of who and what surrounds her; she
is Blanche Dußois, or any other of the myriad of
matriarchs created by Tennessee Williams and William
Faulkner — women who color American literature,
epitomizing the decay of the family stucture and the in
ability of one generation to adapt to the next. Halie is
obsessed with the thought of her three sons, especially
Ansel, whose death she laments and memory she
idealizes. In a confessional, Freudian tirade, she
reveals her feelings for Ansel, foreshadowing mys
teries to follow.
Carol Shoup-Sanders plays Halie with the hint of in
sanity that makes her character and relationship to her
sons interesting. She is, however, far outshone, as is
everyone on stage, by the performance of Bruce
Mackey as Dodge. Sick and dependent yet fiesty and
stubborn, Dodge will not willingly or peacefully pass on
his role as head of the family to his sons. A ruthless act
of survival on Dodge's part devastated his oldest son
Tilden. His other son Bradley is malicious and avari
cious, but has only one leg and relies on psychological
intimidation to make his mark in the family. Dodge is
most afraid of him; their relationship represents the
mythical struggle for power between father and son. In
a less-than-subtle but interesting device, Shepard
portrays Bradley as intent on cutting Dodge's hair, a
stripping of male strength that leaves Dodge increas
ingly weak. Henry Steele is good as the desperate,
crippled Bradley. With a gleam in his eye reminiscent of
a crazed Jack Nicholson, Steele terrorizes the other
family members until he is robbed of his advantage by


Henry Steele as the malicious Bradley "violates" Shelly (Lisa Ramirez), an innocent victim of his
bizarre family, in Sam Shepard's "Buried Child," at the Magic Theatre through Nov. 24.
