## Magic Makes Best of Shepard's 'Buried Child' 
### NANCY HENRY Editorial staff 
Sam Shepard is a playwright whose plays reflect a
preoccupation with numerous profound, universal and
mythological themes. His plays also demonstrate a fine
technical skill and a particularly keen sense of lan
guage. The problem, in a play as thematically ambitious
as the Pulitzer Prize-winning "Buried Child," is that
the latter has not caught up with the former, and the
result is a piece so heavily laden with symbolism and so
rich in unconnected meanings that the purpose is lost.
This is the flaw inherent in the script; the Magic
Theatre, however, in its revival of "Buried Child,"
transcends many of the difficulties, offering a
sensitively directed and at times superbly acted pro
duction.
"Buried Child" is by no means a play without
structure or unity. It tackles the most popular and tired
theme of the 20th century American stage — the
demise of the American family — yet it does so in an
innovative and captivating way. The characters are
stereotypes; but beyond that they are reductions of
human types to their most basic, their most mythic ele
ments.
The character Dodge is an embodiment of the dying
patriarch myth. Lying on the couch of his hard-earned
American home, staring vacantly at the eternal glow of
the television — hacking, choking, smoking and drink
ing, he engages in senseless conversation with his wife
solely out of boredom. His wife Halie is a fading
beauty, feeding on romanticized memories of the past,

ignoring the reality of who and what surrounds her; she
is Blanche Dußois, or any other of the myriad of
matriarchs created by Tennessee Williams and William
Faulkner — women who color American literature,
epitomizing the decay of the family stucture and the in
ability of one generation to adapt to the next. Halie is
obsessed with the thought of her three sons, especially
Ansel, whose death she laments and memory she
idealizes. In a confessional, Freudian tirade, she
reveals her feelings for Ansel, foreshadowing mys
teries to follow.
Carol Shoup-Sanders plays Halie with the hint of in
sanity that makes her character and relationship to her
sons interesting. She is, however, far outshone, as is
everyone on stage, by the performance of Bruce
Mackey as Dodge. Sick and dependent yet fiesty and
stubborn, Dodge will not willingly or peacefully pass on
his role as head of the family to his sons. A ruthless act
of survival on Dodge's part devastated his oldest son
Tilden. His other son Bradley is malicious and avari
cious, but has only one leg and relies on psychological
intimidation to make his mark in the family. Dodge is
most afraid of him; their relationship represents the
mythical struggle for power between father and son. In
a less-than-subtle but interesting device, Shepard
portrays Bradley as intent on cutting Dodge's hair, a
stripping of male strength that leaves Dodge increas
ingly weak. Henry Steele is good as the desperate,
crippled Bradley. With a gleam in his eye reminiscent of
a crazed Jack Nicholson, Steele terrorizes the other
family members until he is robbed of his advantage by

the third son, finally destined to
assume the role as head of this
wretched family.
This third and last son is Vince,
actually Tilden's son, who, when he
arrives on the farmhouse doorstep
with his girlfriend Shelly, has not
been seen in six years. The comic
element of "Buried Child" is highly
emphasized in this production, and
the scenes of confrontation be
tween Vince, Shelly and the rest of
the family are some of the play's
funniest. Completely taken aback
by this house full of lunatics who
claim not to recognize Vince, Lisa
Ramirez as Shelly reacts with
credible histeria, finally resigning
herself to cutting carrots which the
gentle Tilden brought from the gar
den.
Shelly serves as the objective
party who prods the secret out of
this tormented family, opening
doors closed for years and prepar
ing the way for Vince to succeed
Dodge. The scenes which unfold
the "story," first as told by Tilden,
then by Dodge, are by far the most
dramatically effective; they rouse a
genuine feeling of surprise and

curiosity with their suggestiveness.
Unfortunately, neither Ramirez nor
Chiron Alston as Vince are quite up
to the acting standard set by
Mackey and Kent Minault as Tilden.
Perhaps their characters are just
not as rich or as colorful.
Andrew Doe's sensitive direction
is not surprising. The Magic is no
stranger to Shepard and his work.
In fact, Shepard was playwright-in
residence at the Magic for a number
of years and debuted some of his
best work there, including, "Buried
Child," "True West" and "Fool for
Love." This familiarity with
Shepard's dramatic techniques en
hances the potential for subtelty.
Gestures such as the symbolic
covering of Dodge, first by Tilden,
then by Bradley, then finally and
permanently by Vince are given
appropriate import. The mysteri
ous "rape" of Shelly by Bradley,
which takes the form of his forcing
five fingers carefully but forcefully
into her open mouth, is a powerful if
bizarre moment. But nothing is as
moving and effective as the confes
sion scene, in many ways the
climax of the play. Minault as Til
den, tenderly and lovingly caressing
Shelly's rabbit coat, tells the fam
ily's horrible secret with such sin
cerity and intensity as to convince

the audience that the coat is a child,
or at least that he believes it is.
The ultimate problem is that the
play relies too much on vague
suggestiveness to really directly
touch the audience. The mythic
themes are here in modern form.
Brother struggles with brother,
father with son; the women are less
mythical than stereotypical. The
themes of familial succession,
buried truth, of illusion and reality
and of incest are skillfully intro
duced with imaginative symbolic
technique. But Shepard seems to
have introduced so many themes,
he doesn't know where to go with
them. It would take a much longer
work to fully develop the ideas and
characters he creates. Undoubtedly
Shepard settles for effect in the
final scene; there was nothing else
he could do, and quite simply, he
loses the potential for profound and
unified meaning in the whole of the
explosive and disjointed last act.
"Buried Child" itself did win the
Pulitzer Prize, despite its
shortcomings — one indication of
the standard against which Shepard
must be judged. Hopefully he has
not reached his pinnacle as a
playwright, but will, harnessing and
forming the great themes he treats
into great works of art.
