# State Without Grace' Portrays Filipinos in U.S.

### FELICIA WONG 
"The problem of being an Asian playwright
in a city like New York, for example, is that
one will always be faced with the assumption
that only Asians will identify with the work
and only Asians will go see it. 1 think this is
the reason why I'm not happy about being
called an Asian' playwright. I work with a
double-edged insistence: on one hand, in or
der to write honestly about Asians and
Asian-Americans, I need to write about the
'ethnic,' the particular and unique qualities
that contribute to who we are. On the other
hand, I aim for those qualities to be perceived
as part and parcel of the American main
stream experience. " - Linda Faigao
Linda Faigo's ability to combine the eth
nic with the universal American experience

is precisely what makes her play, "State
Without Grace," intriguing. The theme,
homecoming and generational strife, is
familiar; the setting in the Catholic, matriar
chal, guilt-ridden Phillipines is not. Al
though this Asian American Theater Com
pany production is at times heavy-handed in
its treatment of an already serious subject,
Faigao's characterizations of Lola, the
grandmother, and Celia, the family black
sheep, are finely wrought. The perfor
mances of Emilya Cachapero as Celia and
Sharon Iwai as Lola are moving, and it is
these performances from which "State
Without Grace" draws its strength.
It is the story of conflict between three
Filipino women. Laura (Patty Cachapero),
the youngest, is searching for the freedom
which she believes her cousin Celia (Emilya
Cachapero) has found during her 10 years

of life in the United States. Both are
dominated by Lola (the Filipino word for
"grandmother").
Lola is more than the family matriarch;
she is the family idol. She is so powerful
that she rules the Catholicism of a strictly
Catholic family, dictating how and when
daily communal prayers should be recited.
In the play's strongest scene, Celia begs,
"Forgive me, Lola, forgive me." Lola does,
becoming mother confessor and securing
her domination of the family.
Lola can be cruel as well. When Laura
wants to marry a member of a primitive
tribe, a "pagan" in Catholic eyes, Lola
threatens to disown the entire family. Her
incredible manipulation of Laura is a classic
example of Asian guilt, Catholic guilt and
familial guilt combined, but Lola is not en
tirely a monster. If she were, the play

would fall to pieces. Instead, her cruelty
stems from her love and concern for her
granddaughter. This paradox makes Lola
an intriguing character the audience can
condemn yet understand.
Faigao is particularly strong in develop
ing the relationships between the three
women, revealing thread after thread of the
tapestry until she has created, by the play's
end, a colorful and complex work which
has, at times, real dramatic power. Certain
individual lines, however, seem to have
been written with the ear of a poet, not
with the ear of a dramatist. When Laura
says, "When I take flight, I will dance
forever," the audience almost winces.
Lines like this are not for the stage, where
they sound stilted and forced.
While the set design is clever in its
utilization of a rather small amount of space.

unfortunately the blocking of the show does
not make good use of the multi-level stage.
The play 4s about movement of characters;
it spans continents, yet the actors often
seem static. The scenes are often acted in
one part of the set only; more physical
movement would emphasize the often fran
tic energy of the characters.
Some of the supporting performances,
too, seem either superfluous or
melodramatic. The middle generation, for
example, lack the roundness of character
that makes Lola, Celia and Laura strong.
They are simply props off which the other,
stronger characters rebound. Their hys
teric reactions to the family crisis move the
play away from compelling drama and push
it toward soap opera.
On the whole, though, Faigao
keeps the play from falling into a
melodramatic pitfall. The depth of
character of both Celia and Lola
make "State Without Grace" more
than a typical family drama; its set
ting in the Philippines makes it, at
times, unusually beautiful. Even
though Asian-American drama is
gaining strength, it is rare to see a
play about Filipinos. Their unique

background, which is a combination
of Asian and Spanish mixed with a
large dose of Catholic fervor,
makes them a people who deserve
to be treated in their own right ar
tistically. Faigo and the company of
"State Without Grace" keep the au
dience aware of the play's Filipino
roots by making Filipino folklore
and music an integral part of the
production.
But "State Without Grace" is
more than a just a Filipino play.
Linda Faigao achieves her goal of
writing about the ethnic in particu
lar and allowing them to be

recognized as part of the whole
American experience. The plot is at
once Filipino and universal â€” it is
about the struggle to breathe while
being smothered, a theme which
transcends the particulars of set
ting.
"State Without Grace" is directed
by AATC Artistic Director Dom
Magwili. The play will run Thursday
through Nov. 24 at the People's
Theater Coalition, Building B, Fort
Mason Center (Marina and Laguna),
San Francisco. For tickets,
reservations and directions to the
theater call 776-8999.

"The problem of being an Asian playwright
in a city like New York, for example, is that
one will always be faced with the assumption
that only Asians will identify with the work
and only Asians will go see it. 1 think this is
the reason why I'm not happy about being
called an Asian' playwright. I work with a
double-edged insistence: on one hand, in or
der to write honestly about Asians and
Asian-Americans, I need to write about the
'ethnic,' the particular and unique qualities
that contribute to who we are. On the other
hand, I aim for those qualities to be perceived
as part and parcel of the American main
stream experience. " - Linda Faigao
Linda Faigo's ability to combine the eth
nic with the universal American experience

is precisely what makes her play, "State
Without Grace," intriguing. The theme,
homecoming and generational strife, is
familiar; the setting in the Catholic, matriar
chal, guilt-ridden Phillipines is not. Al
though this Asian American Theater Com
pany production is at times heavy-handed in
its treatment of an already serious subject,
Faigao's characterizations of Lola, the
grandmother, and Celia, the family black
sheep, are finely wrought. The perfor
mances of Emilya Cachapero as Celia and
Sharon Iwai as Lola are moving, and it is
these performances from which "State
Without Grace" draws its strength.
It is the story of conflict between three
Filipino women. Laura (Patty Cachapero),
the youngest, is searching for the freedom
which she believes her cousin Celia (Emilya
Cachapero) has found during her 10 years

of life in the United States. Both are
dominated by Lola (the Filipino word for
"grandmother").
Lola is more than the family matriarch;
she is the family idol. She is so powerful
that she rules the Catholicism of a strictly
Catholic family, dictating how and when
daily communal prayers should be recited.
In the play's strongest scene, Celia begs,
"Forgive me, Lola, forgive me." Lola does,
becoming mother confessor and securing
her domination of the family.
Lola can be cruel as well. When Laura
wants to marry a member of a primitive
tribe, a "pagan" in Catholic eyes, Lola
threatens to disown the entire family. Her
incredible manipulation of Laura is a classic
example of Asian guilt, Catholic guilt and
familial guilt combined, but Lola is not en
tirely a monster. If she were, the play

would fall to pieces. Instead, her cruelty
stems from her love and concern for her
granddaughter. This paradox makes Lola
an intriguing character the audience can
condemn yet understand.
Faigao is particularly strong in develop
ing the relationships between the three
women, revealing thread after thread of the
tapestry until she has created, by the play's
end, a colorful and complex work which
has, at times, real dramatic power. Certain
individual lines, however, seem to have
been written with the ear of a poet, not
with the ear of a dramatist. When Laura
says, "When I take flight, I will dance
forever," the audience almost winces.
Lines like this are not for the stage, where
they sound stilted and forced.
While the set design is clever in its
utilization of a rather small amount of space.

unfortunately the blocking of the show does
not make good use of the multi-level stage.
The play 4s about movement of characters;
it spans continents, yet the actors often
seem static. The scenes are often acted in
one part of the set only; more physical
movement would emphasize the often fran
tic energy of the characters.
Some of the supporting performances,
too, seem either superfluous or
melodramatic. The middle generation, for
example, lack the roundness of character
that makes Lola, Celia and Laura strong.
They are simply props off which the other,
stronger characters rebound. Their hys
teric reactions to the family crisis move the
play away from compelling drama and push
it toward soap opera.
On the whole, though, Faigao
keeps the play from falling into a
melodramatic pitfall. The depth of
character of both Celia and Lola
make "State Without Grace" more
than a typical family drama; its set
ting in the Philippines makes it, at
times, unusually beautiful. Even
though Asian-American drama is
gaining strength, it is rare to see a
play about Filipinos. Their unique

background, which is a combination
of Asian and Spanish mixed with a
large dose of Catholic fervor,
makes them a people who deserve
to be treated in their own right ar
tistically. Faigo and the company of
"State Without Grace" keep the au
dience aware of the play's Filipino
roots by making Filipino folklore
and music an integral part of the
production.
But "State Without Grace" is
more than a just a Filipino play.

writing about the ethnic in particu

recognized as part of the whole
