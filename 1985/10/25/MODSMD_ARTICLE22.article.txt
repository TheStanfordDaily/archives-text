# ACT Play Examines Myths of Wild West
## 
### ELAINE WANG 
The American Conservatory Theatre (ACT)
opens its 20th season with Mark Medoff's "The
Majestic Kid," and it's a lively show. You get a nos
talgic feeling just walking into the theater, where old
silent Westerns are showing on the screen that
serves as a backdrop throughout the performance.
A neon "Rialto" sign in the corner and a walker sel
ling matinee snacks (M&Ms, Junior Mints, etc.)
complete the personable atmosphere.
The play is set in New Mexico, where lawyers
Aaron Weiss (Scot Bishop) and A.J. Pollard (Nike
Doukas) clash with the giant landowner, Judge
William S. Hart Finlay (Lawrence Hecht), in an at
tempt to help the Indians reclaim land lost to set
tlers.
Aaron and A.J. are childhood friends and frequent
lovers, but he falls for Lisa Belmondo (Michelle
Casey), who owns a ranch and loves the land, and
who also happens to be the judge's girl. The situa
tion is obvious, but it isn't the key element in the
play.
Medoffs concerns are more philosophical, and he
plays with the notions we have about the Wild West,
the need for those myths and also the distortion
they create. Aaron's mythic hero is the Laredo Kid
(MarkMurphey), who appears and dishes out advice
and "wisdom" to the Majestic Kid (a.k.a. Aaron).
Murphey is boisterous and endearing as the
Laredo Kid; he swaggers in and out of scenes with
the best lines and the smoothest moves. When at a
loss for a ready wild-west quip, he reaches for his
guitar, flashes an apologetic smile, and suggests,
"How 'bout a song?" He is the most likeable part of
the show.
Much of the action centers around the women and

Aaron's relationships with them. A.J. is his abrasive
and practical counterpart; she's always bailed him
out, and it is to her that he runs for rescue after
having accidentally shot and wounded Lisa. Doukas
is appropriately sharp and driven in this role — the
modern professional through and through.
Lisa, however, is a less fathomable character;
she's tough, but soft and vibrant with Aaron, to the
point where he becomes angry that she wants to
please him. She, too, keeps rescuing him from the
judge — and as the Laredo Kid keeps reminding
him, it's the guy that does the rescuin'. Casey is
strong in this role, and she lends it as much charm
as Murphey gives to his portrayal of the Laredo Kid.
Hecht's Judge Finlay is only occasionally frighten
ing; he tends to come off as being a fish rather than
threatening. But his long strings of swearing are su
preme.
Bishop delivers the blandest performance, not
necessarily attributable to the lines he has or to the
fact that Aaron Weiss isn't exactly the most dynamic
guy in the world. Aaron's part goes through a transi
tion where he realizes that being the Kid misin
terprets the world and heroism — that the heroes of
the wild west had no responsibilities and above all,
never knew women except as "gals." Bishop
doesn't quite achieve this resolution, and we're not
sure he's strong enough at the end.
There is, however, every reason to see the
show. The underlying concerns can get muddled
and the resolution vague, but the play is remarkably
funny, and crossovers between myth and present
reality are often pointed and startling.
Mark Medoff won the Tony Award for his
"Children of a Lesser God." He is a Stanford
graduate and is now artistic director of the American
Southwest Theatre Company. His newest play is
worth seeing and runs at ACT through Nov. 9.
