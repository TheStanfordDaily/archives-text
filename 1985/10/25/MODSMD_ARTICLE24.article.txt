# Students Make Wrong Choice In Edward Albee's 'Zoo Story'
## 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
Imagine yourself a student director trying to think
of a play to put on. If you are the kind of person who
would opt for showcasing a crowd-pleaser that
wouldn't cost too much to produce, you'd probably
end up.giving your audience Edward Albee's "The
Zoo Story."
This 1958 drama is decidedly thrilling in a tawdry,
manipulative sort of way. The story of two strang
ers meeting in New York's Central Park on a Sun
day afternoon proffers plenty of rhinestones about
the alienation of American society in the '50s.
The production, starring Martin Bedoian as a
pseudo-intellectual drifter and Peter Morgan as the
complacently innocent publishing house employee
he bumps into, raises as many questions as it dis
penses thrills.
Bedoian and Morgan struggle valiantly to absorb
themselves in the roles they've been given, but they
never completely succeed in surmounting the prob
lem of staying in character.
Most of the play hinges on the performance of
Bedoian, who is given the burden of sustaining a
wearying monologue about his travails in life. For

tunately, Bedoian doesn't miss a beat. But the value
we get out of listening to 15 minutes of babbling
about how the drifter can't love anybody but a dog is
questionable.
The faults of the play aside, Bedoian doesn't put
across a consistent performance. His voice os
cillates between a strident shriek and a detached
murmur, and he never really sheds the taint of
treating his role as something like an intellectual ex
ercise. He emotes capably, but he mouths his lines
with a bemused detachment that takes away from
the persona he's attempting to bring to life. Bedoian
is not a drifter, he's a student pretending he's a
drifter. He doesn't make us feel he's ever slept with
a prostitute in his whole life. He apparently has a lot
of fun trying, though.
Morgan's character has little to say in the face of
the transient's bombast, which leaves his perfor
mance hinging on the expressions he is able to wring
from his face. Morgan can't seem to decide whether
to gaze at Bedoian like he is Buddha or Satan in
carnate, and that adds to the confusion. We never
get any true sense of what the publishing house em
ployee thinks of this drifter who's invaded his space,
beyond a few timid yelps of consternation upon
being thrown halfway across the Nitery stage by
Bedoian.
