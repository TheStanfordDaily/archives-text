Nestled in the wooded hills over
looking the charming town of Men
docino lies a wonderfully romantic
inn worthy of being classified as a
destination in and of itself.
Upon first spotting Blackberry
Inn (937-5281) visitors are more
likely to think they have stumbled
upon a Hollywood set for a Wild
West film than a quaint, elegant
hotel.
Bob and Gerta Parmenter,
creators of The Blackberry Inn,
have built a hotel that truly captures
the romance and adventure of the
Wild West. There are no numbered
rooms or cottages here. Instead,
guests at Blackberry stay in the
Saloon, Sheriffs Office or even
Livery Stable. The outside of each
cottage accurately depicts the
facade of a building in a small west
ern frontier town.
According to Bob Parmenter, the
goal in creating the inn was not to
build an accurate replica of the
West, but rather to capture the
romance and intrigue that the
modern era has placed on that per
iod of history.
"Blackberry is the story of the
black hats against the white hats;
the good guys win, the cowboy
marries the pretty young school
teacher, and everyone lives happily
ever after," he said.
Blackberry's "town" is created
with 13 unique, attached cottages.
Each room represents a well
known establishment from a fron
tier village. By being faithful to
myth rather than reality, the ac
commodations border on the deca
dent.
An architect and an interior
designer, Bob Parmenter and his
wife have carried the bewitching
charm of the western facades into
the sinfully luxurious interiors of

the rooms. While each room is fur
nished differently, all have quality
antique style furniture to match the
western theme.
Ten of the rooms have fireplaces
or wood-burning stoves. Upon
checking in, guests find wood
neatly arranged in the fireplace just
waiting for the simple strike of a
match. While all the rooms have
private bath/showers, Blackberry's
Bank, Sheriff's Office, Millinary and
town fancy house (Belle's Place) all
have sunken Roman bathtubs. An
ample supply of bubble bath is pro
vided.
All of the units have spectacular
ocean views. From Blackberry's
hilltop vista, all rooms overlook the
town of Mendocino and the nearby
headlands coastal preserve. All
rooms have color cable TVs taste
fully hidden away in antique closets.
The inn's small size allows the
Parmenters to cater to their guests'
every need. Bob and Gerta are al
ways available to help guests make
dinner reservations or plan a day of
exploring.
Room rates at the inn are
surprisingly inexpensive. Probably
the best buy is the Boarding House
at $60 per night. This room
features a wood-burning stove,
tub/shower combination and a king
sized bed. Also available for $60 a
night is the slightly larger Saloon,
complete with swinging doors,
king-sized bed, but no fireplace.
For those preferring two double
beds, the Barber Shop and the
Land Office are both $60 per night,
double occupancy.
For $65 per night, guests can
choose between the Physicians' Of
fice and the Livery Stable. Both
rooms have wood-burning stoves,
tub/shower combinations and king
sized beds.
Both the General Store and the
Assayer's Office rent for $70.
These rooms have fireplaces, king
size beds, and tub/shower combina
tions. Blackberry's Bank goes for
$75 per night and is equipped for
the handicapped. It features a
fireplace, king size bed, Roman tub
and separate shower.
For those seeking sinful
decadence, both the Millinary and

the Sheriff's Office include
fireplaces, Roman tubs, king-sized
beds and separate showers for $80
a night.
If you desire a kitchenette,
Belle's Place is ideal. This may well
be the most romantic room on the
Mendocino coast. Its plush interior
features a four-poster queen size
bed with painting of frolicking an
gels over the headboard, a
fireplace, sunken Roman tub with
solid brass fixtures, separate
shower and dressing area,
kitchenette and dining area. It rents

for $110 a night.
The last room, the Blackberry
Gazette, is almost identical to
Belle's Place, except it has two
double beds and a wood-burning
stove. It also rents out at $110 a
night. Extra guests are $5 each,
and a roll-away bed is another $5.
All rooms come with a basket of
fresh fruit, homemade fruit-nut
bread and a coffee maker for a do
it-yourself breakfast in bed.

Although it would be easy never
to leave your room at Blackberry,
Mendocino in the off-season has
much to offer. This rugged area of
the north coast is covered with
breathtaking vistas, secluded
coves, isolated trails and abundant
wildlife.
The town, which is an easy 10-
minute walk from the inn, was
originally settled in 1852 by lumber
jacks from New England. They felt

that the proximity to a large inland
river and the protected deep water
harbor would make an ideal milling
site. Little is left of the mill outside
of small bits and pieces in the town
museum, but the Mendocino's New
England charm is still present.
Today Mendocino's main indus
try is tourism. Much like Carmel,
the town is populated by artists and
craftsmen. Many of the town's
original buildings have been con
verted to galleries and cafes. Side


In keeping with the Blackberry Inn's frontier-town theme, the
"General Store" overlooks Blackberry's dusty "main street."
