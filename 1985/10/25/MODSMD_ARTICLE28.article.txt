Fresco resembles nothing quite
as much as it does the departure
lounge of a bustling international
airport. On a Saturday night, this
restaurant is noisy and full; it's a
collage of movement and voices,
slick young professionals and
sociable foreigners.
The restaurant is comprised of
two separate dining areas: one in
formal and one more dressy area,
linked by an entrance hall. The dif
ference between these two rooms
lies in the atmosphere, not in the
cuisine. The cafe-style section is
casual, simple and exposed to El
Camino by its big windows. The so
phisticated room is more enclosed
and certainly more classy.
We chose the latter.
A well-equipped bar nestles the
entrance to this dining area. The
rest of the room is distinctive for its
modern, uncluttered decor. Spot
lights on ceiling tracks softly high
light each table, and mirrors cut the
predominantly pink and beige sur
roundings. A few large plants
punctuate the central space, as

does the sizeable brass parrot
poised deliberatly above a creeper.
The menu offers two types of
food, and there is a long list of daily
specials. A selection of informal
foods is available for those inter
ested in a quick bite: a variety of
sandwiches ($5.50 to $6.25),
burgers ($3.95 to $4.75), calzone
($5.75 to $6.75) and also Bud's Ice
Cream.
The more ceremonial dishes are
found mostly on the special's sheet,
and include several pasta items
($5.25 to $7.50), Louisiana crab
and scallop cakes ($8.95), veal por
terhouse ($9.50) and Pacific snap
per ($5.95) served with a mustard
sauce.
The wine list offers California
wines of average to high quality,
mostly priced quite high. An attrac
tive feature is that many wines are
available by the glass. The house
white wine (Raymond Vintage
Select '83 at $7.25) was dry and
pleasant.
For starters, we selected new
potato skins ($3.50) and zucchini
and rosemary soup ($1.25 a cup).
The potato skins were filled with a
bacon and cheese mixture, and
served with sour cream. The
heavy-handed treatment (the top
ping was too strong) made this dish
unsuitable as an appetizer.

The soup was different. A
creamed and buttered puree of zuc
chini, onion, potato and rosemary,

it was rich and complex, with a lin
gering flavor. Vegetarians should
note that this soup is prepared with

chicken stock (that feature is not
mentioned on the menu).
As entrees we chose Southern
Californian swordfish ($8.95) and
stuffed pork roast with plums
($8.50). The swordfish was broiled
and served with a ginger-flavored
cream sauce, potatoes cooked in
their skins and mixed vegetables.
Cooked to perfection, the thick cut
of fish was succulent and soft. The
sauce was a new taste for us, and
we thoroughly enjoyed the sensa
tion.
The pork consisted of three
slices cut from a roasted loin stuffed
with plums. This was accompanied
by apple sauce, sweet potato and
carrot pancakes and mixed
vegetables. The presentation was
very attractive but we felt that the
combination was too dry to be en
tirely successful.
Our dessert choices, apple pie
($1.75) and Amaretto chocolate
cheesecake ($2.95) were pleasing
and disappointing, respectively.
The apple pie was tasty and satisfy
ing, but the cheesecake was too
dense and dominated by the
Amaretto.
We might have better concluded
our meal on a lighter, more subtle
note. But we did enjoy the freshly
ground Columbia coffee.

The service at Fresco was
flawed. Although our waiter was
friendly and confident, he was
somewhat careless. He forgot to
bring our bread and he bungled our
appetizer order.
Our biggest gripe was that when
we asked to see the dessert menu
he preferred to recite the options.
We realized too late that he had
omitted many which we might have
liked. Hopefully our misfortune
reflects an exception to a better
rule.
Fresco left us slightly puzzled.
The cooking is innovative, the
produce of highest quality and the
presentation of the dishes is attrac
tive.
At the same time we felt that the
restaurant dabbles with too many
styles at once.
But if you feel like a buoyant
night out, it's a fun place to try. The
prices are manageable enough to
permit an experiment, and the pace
and atmosphere can be energizing.
Its eclecticism may indeed lend to
Fresco the note of freshness that it
claims.
Fresco is open daily at 6 a.m. for
breakfast, ilunch and dinner (7 a.m.
on Saturdays and Sundays). Having
a reservation simply means that
one gets priority in the line on arri
val.
