### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
The findings of an investigation of
alleged brutality by Stanford police
and Santa Clara County sheriff's of
ficers in the Oct. 11 arrest of nine
anti-apartheid protesters will be
turned over to University President
Donald Kennedy today.
Law Prof. John Kaplan, who was
appointed by Kennedy to investi
gate the incident last week, said he
has received "lots" of information
since Monday, when he told The
Daily that he had obtained a report

and videotape of the incident from
police, shown the tape to witnesses
and arrestees, interviewed police
officers and obtained statements
from observers and eight arres
tees.
The case in question involves the
arrest of students during a sit-in
held at Old Union to protest Uni
versity investments in companies
doing business in South Africa. The
students were arrested after they
refused to leave the building at the
requests of Stanford police and Uni
versity administrators.
Stanford senior Robby Perkins
claimed he was stripped and beaten

by Santa Clara County deputies at
North County Jail in Palo Alto fol
lowing the arrest. He was later
treated for bruises to his head,
neck and arms at Stanford Medical
Center.
Perkins has said he plans to sue
the Santa Clara County police and
has been consulting with various
lawyers. Perkins and other arres
tees also said they plan to sue the
Stanford police in connection with
the incident. The law allows them
100 days from the incident in which
to declare their intent to sue.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington said he has no plans to

assign Sgt. Nick Brunot, accused
by demonstrators of brutality
during the Oct. 11 arrest, to desk
duty.
"There's been no charge leveled
at him and there's been no miscon
duct on his part as far as I'm con
cerned," Herrington said. The
police chief was responding to a
remark made Wednesday by Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons that
Brunot may be assigned desk duty
as a result of Kaplan's investigation.
Herrington said "there's no truth
at all" to the remark.
Lyons made the comment to
graduate student Eric Diesel, who
had remained in Old Union at the
end of a sit-in Wednesday.
Diesel, who has been arrested
twice in the protests, left the build
ing after Lyons persuaded him to do
so.
He said he has been looking into
the possibility of filing charges
against Brunot for assault and
against Herrington for abetting as
sault.
