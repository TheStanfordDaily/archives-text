## Reeling Card Hopes 'Cats Don't Claw 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
The stars are out at Stanford,
and it's not a good sign.
The two shining lights of the
1985 Cardinal football team —
quarterback John Paye and fullback
Brad Muster — are not scheduled
to start tomorrow's game with
Pacific 10 Conference-leading
Arizona. And so what might have
been a ballgame is now looking like
a repeat of Stanford's 34-9 and 30-6
losses to UCLA and USC. Only
worse.
The Wildcats are the best team
that no one knows about, because
of a two-year probation that will
keep them off TV until the end of
this year. The preseason sages
picked them to finish fifth or sixth in
the Pac-10 this year. The sages
were wrong.
Arizona overcame its graduation
losses by bringing in a slew of junior

college transfers, and its young
players have come along rapidly.
The Wildcats are now 5-1 (2-0 in
conference), and without Washing
ton or USC on the schedule this
year, they are the odds-on favorite
to go to the Rose Bowl.
The biggest reason is their
defense. Arizona has allowed only
nine points per game — best in the
Pac-10 — and only USC has
allowed fewer yards per game than
Arizona's 282.7.
That's not the scariest part of it
for Stanford fans. The quick, ag
gressive Wildcat defense has inter
cepted 15 passes already this year
and recorded 25 sacks. With slow,
pickoff-prone Fred Buckley at the
helm for the Cardinal, look for
Arizona to blitz often and effec
tively.
"Defensively, their secondary is
outstanding and the statistics prove
it," Stanford Coach Jack Elway


The Stanford offense has been conspicuously short on the long
pass in recent weeks. Fred Buckley will try his hand at the of-
