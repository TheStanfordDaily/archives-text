# Men's Soccer Looks To Swat the Hornets
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Those looking for some high
scoring athletic action this weekend
need not go to Stanford Stadium.
Beyond all the tailgaters, the Stan
ford men's soccer team will host
the Cal State Sacramento Hornets
on Harry Maloney field at 11 a.m. in
a non-conference match-up.
During a four-game winning
streak, the Cardinal offense has ex
ploded for 11 goals, raising Stan
ford's record to 4-1 in the Pacific
Soccer Conference and 9-6-2 over
all. In the previous 13 games, the
squad could only produce a total of
13 goals.
The scoring binge may continue
because, unlike previous years, all
members of the team have avoided
serious injury. For the past two
seasons, Rob West and Angel Vaz
quez, both threats to score, have
been slowed by injuries. This year
both are in good shape.
In Tuesday night's 4-0 Cardinal
victory over Santa Clara, West re
corded his third goal of the year,
and Vazquez tallied his sixth. Vaz

quez also notched his fourth assist
of the season.
Along with seniors Tom
Rafalovich (four goals, two assists)
and Giancarlo Ferruzzi (three
goals, four assists), West and Vaz
quez will be looking to add to their
scoring totals against Division II
Sacramento.
The Hornets, 6-6-4 on the
season, are in a transition year.
The soccer program was elevated
to varsity status only last year.
That means this is Sacramento's
first year to give out scholarships.
It is also the first season for Head
Coach Dean Wurzberger.
Early indications suggest he has
turned the program around.
Last year Sacramento finished
with a 2-14 record, but thanks to
senior George Champayne, who
leads the team with seven goals and
five assists, the Hornets have
tripled last year's winning output
already.
"We have quite a few good soc
cer players in the Sacramento
area," Wurzberger said. "If we can
get them to go to school here, then

played just for kicks.
we could be a competitive Division I
squad in the future."
In the more near future, the Hor
nets will have to compete with a
Stanford team which is in second
place in one of the toughest soccer
conferences in the nation.
"Obviously well be underdogs,
but we've surprised a few teams
this year," Wurzberger said. "We
have to go into the game with a
'nothing to lose' attitude."
If records against common oppo
nents mean anything, then the
Sacramento team will have to play
its best game of the year to beat
Stanford. The Cardinal trounced
Santa Clara 4-0 this season, while
Sacramento lost to Santa Clara 3-0.
