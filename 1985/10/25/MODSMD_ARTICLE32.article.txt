ST. LOUIS (AP) — The Kansas
City speed connection of Lonnie
Smith and Willie Wilson came alive
last night, leading the Royals to a 6-
1 victory over St. Louis in Game 5
of the World Series and signaling
that time had not yet run out for the
American League champions.
Their backs had been to the wall
for so long they had written graffiti
on it, Hal Mcßae had said. On this
night, the graffiti read: "Not just
yet."
The victory cut the Cardinals' ad
vantage in the best-of-seven Series
to three games-to-two heading
back to Kansas City for Game 6 to
morrow night.
The Royals will send left-hander
Charlie Leibrandt, the hard-luck
loser of Game 2, against Cardinals
right-hander Danny Cox, who won
Game 2 with the aid of four ninth
inning runs.
With Danny Jackson pitching in
and out of trouble despite allowing
only five hits and striking out five,
the Nos. 1 and 2 hitters for the
Royals suddenly sparked a dormant
Kansas City offense. Smith had two
hits and scored a pair of runs, and

Wilson had two hits, including a
triple, and a pair of RBI.
The Royals scored once in the
first inning against Bob Forsch and
added three more in the second.
Jackson, who worked seven ef
fective innings in Game 2 before he
left for a pinch hitter, was a little
less effective in Game 5, but he was
good enough. He gave up a first
inning run on Jack Clark's double
and pitched out of a bases-loaded
jam in the third, but he retired 11
batters in a row before Landrum
reached on an infield single leading
off the bottom of the ninth.
In fact, after Forsch's exit in the
second inning, St. Louis actually
had the better of the pitching as
relievers Rickey Horton, Bill
"Soup" Campbell, Todd Worrell and
Jeff Lahti combined to hold the
Royals to one unearned run the rest
of the way. Worrell worked two in
nings, tying a World Series record
by striking out all six batters he
faced and helping Cardinals pitchers
fan 15 Royals, two shy of the
single-game Series record set by
St. Louis' Bob Gibson against
Detroit in 1968.
