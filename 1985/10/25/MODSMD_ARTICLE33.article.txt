## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff writer 
When you don't know very much about the other
team, there isn't much you can do but worry. When the
No. 2 Cardinal water polo team starts against No. 6
Long Beach State this afternoon at 3 p.m. at DeGuerre
Pool, there will certainly be just a little worrying going
on, at least on the Stanford side.
"We haven't had a chance to really see Long Beach
play this year, so it is difficult to know what to expect,"
Coach Dante Dettamanti said. "I don't really know
much about their team, except that they are very
good, and I am certainly a little worried about that."

Today's Game
Long Beach State at Stanford
DeGuerre Pool, 3 p.m.

Long Beach, ranked behind Santa Barbara (No. 5),
UCLA (No. 4), UC-Irvine (No. 3), Stanford and Cal
(No. 1), has had several big victories this season over
teams like USC, Pepperdine and UOP, despite close
losses to UCLA, Berkeley and Santa Barbara.
According to Dettamanti, Long Beach has no real
"forte," but rather relies on an overall team effort to
lead the team. Coached by Assistant Olympic Coach
Ken Lindgren, the 49er players are known to posses
a lot of talent.

"Lindgren is a very talented coach and his talent
shows in his team," Dettamanti said. "The team is
known to do a lot of extra training and consequently the
players are in excellent shape."
The conditioning of the 49ers can have a large affect
on the match's outcome in terms of Long Beach's abil
ity to continue playing strong throughout the match.
"As usual, we will come out strong, with alot of in
tensity, and attempt to open up a strong lead," Detta
manti said. "Against a formidable team like Long Beach
that isn't always easy, but if we execute our plays, we
can do it."
According to Dettamanti, the Cardinal will not follow
any specific game plan, but rather will emphasize ex
ecution and intensity, especially on fast breaks and in
front-court play.
"When you play a team that you really don't know
much about, all you can really do is keep playing your
own game and .adjust your defense to counteract their
offense," Dettamanti said. "Our defense has been
playing very consistently, and if they keep it up we
shouldn't have too much trouble keeping their scoring
down."
Most likely, Long Beach will be unable to focus its
defensive efforts on one player, for the Cardinal has
been led by very even scoring so far this season.
Paced by juniors Craig Klass (33 goals) and Imbernino
(31), Stanford has also received strong scoring support
from Jaimie Velez (27), Matt Tingler (14), Marvin
Mouchawar (12), Erich Fisher (11) and Greg Gamble
(10).
According to Dante, this balanced team scoring is in
dicative of the Cardinal's play as a whole.
"We have really been coming together as a team
during the past few weeks," Dettamanti said.
"Everyone is coming through and pulling their share,
taking up the slack when it's needed."
