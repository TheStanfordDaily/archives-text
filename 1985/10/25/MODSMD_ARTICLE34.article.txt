### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Six pre-season Top 20 men's golf teams
are down on the Farm for the 54-hole Stan
ford Fall Intercollegiate Invitational today and
tomorrow at the Stanford Golf Course.
Among the 18-team field are pre-season
picks No. 4 Louisiana State, No. 8 Southern
California, No. 11 Arizona State, No. 13 Brig
ham Young, No. 17 Texas-El Paso, and No.
19 Fresno State. Other Top 20 contenders
teeing off today are San Jose State and
defending tournament champion Stanford.
Cardinal Coach Tim Schaaf indicated the
road to victory will be rugged.
"The top competition kind of follows (the
rankings)," Schaaf said. "But LSU has never
played here before, and this is not an easy
place to play for the first time. Eight of the
other 17 have, though.
"We beat every one of the teams except
USC last week that's here," he said, refer
ring to the Cardinal's fourth-place finish in the
Southwestern Intercollegiate in Thousand
Oaks. "We played consistently, very strong
mentally at the Southwestern.
"There are 12 teams that could win this.
Anyone would be stupid to predict they would
win."
The starting six players for Stanford today
are Don Walsworth, Carl Wagner, Brad Geer,
Phil Rowley, John Dickey and Rich Marik.

The five best scores out of those six p' !yers
each round will count toward the tr n .-core
on the par-71 course.
Marik, Walsworth and Warner finished
second, third and fourth, respectively, in the
individual side of the competition in the Stan
ford Spring Invitational less than a year ago.
In addition, as is often the privilege of a
host team, Stanford will be sporting a second
team of Roger Miraglia, Casey Pittock, Jeff
Gilbert and Mike Pope.
A couple of the Cardinal golfers com
mented on the team's chances.
"It's a great field," Rowley said. "But all of
us are confident that if we play up to our
levels we'll do well."
"We've always played really well here,"
Walsworth said. "I'm really confident. . . .
We have to play exceptionally well to win
here.
"This seems to be my week," Walsworth
added. "I'm from Missouri — how can we
lose?"
Schaaf noted the importance of ending the
fall season on a high note.
"We've got the whole winter to focus
toward the spring, and playing well here
could put us in a strong psychological posi
tion," he said. "It makes everything we do in
the winter seem more meaningful.
"You sort of get a pecking order estab
lished (during the fall)," he said. "We can put
ourselves where people are catching us. The
people we have to beat are here."
