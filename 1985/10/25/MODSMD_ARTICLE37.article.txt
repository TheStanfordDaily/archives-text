It's not going to get any easier for the women's soc
cer team.
Last weekend Stanford traveled to Denver, where
the team faced Colorado College, the country's No. 8
team, and Wisconsin, the country's No. 9 team. This
Saturday at noon the Cardinal will once again travel to
take on a nationally ranked squad, this time Cal State
Hayward.
The Pioneers, ranked No. 5 nationally, boast a per
fect 13-0 mark and, as Stanford women's soccer Coach
Helen Keohane said, "They're deserving of the record.
They're a balanced team with strong players in every
position.
One of those strong players is freshman midfielder
Denise Regis, who jumped directly from high school to
play for the West's team in the National Sports Fes
tival.
Other Pioneers to watch are forwards Kim Johnson

and Lisa Delarosa, both of whom have "the ability to
score," Keohane said. Johnson has already tallied 12
goals and six assists this season.
On the Cardinal side of the field, Stanford may be
forced to play without sophomore forward Jen Hill. She
suffered a sprained knee in Denver. As of yesterday,
Keohane expected her to see at least limited action, if
the team trainers consent.
In the last few games, Hill's fiery spirit has been cru
cial in helping to revive a Cardinal offense that had been
dormant at the start of the season. Hill has scored only
one goal, but her competitive attitude has been con
tagious.
The rest of the Stanford squad realizes that "we'll
have to play very well to win, but there's definitely that
chance," Keohane said. "It's always hard to come back
and play after a trip, but by Saturday we'll be
prepared."
The key to the Cardinal hopes will be the strong play
of its defense and its ability to quickly establish an of
fensive threat. The team failed to do that in the Wis
consin game.
