Allies Support Reagan on Talks
NEW YORK — President Reagan and the leaders of five other
democracies meet here yesterday for a mini-summit in preparation
for next month's summit in Geneva with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev.
"They expressed full support for President Reagan in his talks in
Geneva," Secretary of State George Shultz declared after the five
nation meeting. "What they supported was the notion that all the dif
ferent issues being discussed are important."
The meeting, which took place at the United Nations, came
shortly after Reagan delivered a speech to the U.N. General Assem
bly stressing that regional differences with the Soviet Union deserve
equal time when he meets with Gorbachev on Nov. 19-20.
The Allied leaders, in an apparent effort not to undercut Reagan
on the eve of the summit — his first with a Soviet head of state since
taking office — were careful to emphasize their overall endorsement
of the U. S. approach.
Bettino Craxi, the Italian prime minister whose government fell
last seek as a result of his role in the release of Abul Abbas, the al
leged mastermind of the Achille Lauro hijacking, stressed his sup
port of the U.S. position in the upcoming talks. Craxi was in New
York as Italy's acting prime minister and is expected to be asked to
assume the leadership of a new coalition government.
Swap Frees Duarte's Daughter
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — President Jose Napoleon
Duarte and his eldest daughter were reunited in a tropical downpour
yesterday, 44 days after Ines Guadalupe Duarte Duran was kid
napped from a private university in the capital.
The emotional reunion on the soccer field of the Capt. Gerardo
Barrios Military School was part of the largest' exchange of political
prisoners and wounded in the history of this country's six-year civil
war.
Under the agreement reached Tuesday with the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, an alliance of five rebel armies fighting the
U.S.-backed Duarte government, the rebels were to release Duarte
Duran, a friend kidnapped with her and 33 mayors and municipal offi
cials captured since April. The government, in turn, pledged to free
22 political prisoners and to allow 96 wounded guerrillas safe passage
out of the country.
Rey Prendes said that of the 22 political prisoners released, only
four would leave the country and the other 18 were expected to
return to the mountains to resume their battle against the govern
ment.
Violence Erupts in Cape Town
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Racial violence erupted in the
center of a major South African city for the second time in a week
when police clashed with demonstrators in Cape Town yesterday.
The violence in central Cape Town followed rioting in downtown
Johannesburg last Friday, when blacks rampaged through six city
blocks clashing with whites and smashing shop windows after a
memorial service for a supporter of the black underground who was
hanged for killing a policeman.
The violence in and around Cape Town, where black activists yes
terday threw two hand grenades and fired two shots at security force
vehicles, and unrest in other parts of the country that included the
death of a black youth in the eastern Cape Province town of Cradock
yesterday did not seem to bear out Botha's claim that the emergency
was proving effective in "ensuring a return to stability."
Two blacks were killed in clashes with police in the Crossroads
squatter camp outside Cape Town yesterday, bringing the death toll
in that region during the past two months to 63 and the total killed in
South Africa since racial violence began in September last year to
nearly 800.
U.S. May Meet With Nicaragua
WASHINGTON — The State Department said yesterday that it is
attempting to arrange a high-level meeting with Nicaragua's Marxist
regime, a shift from the Reagan Administration's previous refusal to
enter into talks with the Sandinistas.
Department spokesman Joseph Reap said that U.S. officials ap
proached the Nicaraguans several weeks ago to try to arrange a
meeting with Foreign Minister Miguel d'Escoto at the United Nations
but that the two sides could not agree on details.
If a meeting is arranged, it would be the first such high-level con
tact since the Reagan Administration broke off formal peace talks in
January. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega tried to arrange a
meeting with President Reagan at the United Nations this week but
was refused an appointment by the White House. He did, however,
greet the president in a reception line Wednesday night.
"Our policy hasn't changed," Reap said. "The Sandinistas aren't
going to hear anything different from what they've heard before. But
other countries wanted us to meet with them. And it seemed to be
about time to let them know from the horse's mouth that we want
them to start a dialogue with the (Nicaraguan) opposition."
U.S. Rejects U.N. Agreement
NEW YORK — The celebration of the United Nations' 40th
birthday was marred yesterday when its 159 members were unable
to reach agreement on what was to have been the day's centerpiece
— a declaration listing U.N. accomplishments and objectives.
The sticking point, U.S. officials said, was an Arab demand that
the declaration contain a call for "the right of self-determination of
the Palestinian people," and a phrase implying the objective of having
Israel withdraw from all occupied territories.
/ The United States refused to accept the Arab paragraph, and this
prevented the unanimous consent necessary for the adoption of the
full text by the General Assembly.
A West European diplomat called the dispute an "unfortunate sym
bol" of the futility the organization has long experienced. "After the
rhetoric of the past week," she said, "here we are, back to the
realities, to the real United Nations."
The deadlock solidified at the last minute as the assembly hall was
packed with dignitaries, including Vice President Bush, attending the
climactic ceremony of the United Nations' week-long celebration.
They heard speeches by Assembly President Jaime de Pinies of
Spain and Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who said:
"The observance of this anniversary has meaning not so much as a
symbol but as an opportunity. The occasion has set the stage to
make a fresh beginning and try to overcome current stalemates on
major issues."
As he spoke, however, the committee that had spent a year draft
ing the declaration to be adopted as the assembly's final ceremonial
act was in a basement conference room in the throes of the impasse.

Rey Prendes said that of the 22 political prisoners released, only

Violence Erupts in Cape Town
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Racial violence erupted in the
center of a major South African city for the second time in a week
when police clashed with demonstrators in Cape Town yesterday.
The violence in central Cape Town followed rioting in downtown
Johannesburg last Friday, when blacks rampaged through six city
blocks clashing with whites and smashing shop windows after a
memorial service for a supporter of the black underground who was
hanged for killing a policeman.
The violence in and around Cape Town, where black activists yes
terday threw two hand grenades and fired two shots at security force
vehicles, and unrest in other parts of the country that included the
death of a black youth in the eastern Cape Province town of Cradock
yesterday did not seem to bear out Botha's claim that the emergency
was proving effective in "ensuring a return to stability."
Two blacks were killed in clashes with police in the Crossroads
squatter camp outside Cape Town yesterday, bringing the death toll
in that region during the past two months to 63 and the total killed in
South Africa since racial violence began in September last year to
nearly 800.
U.S. May Meet With Nicaragua
WASHINGTON — The State Department said yesterday that it is
attempting to arrange a high-level meeting with Nicaragua's Marxist
regime, a shift from the Reagan Administration's previous refusal to
enter into talks with the Sandinistas.
Department spokesman Joseph Reap said that U.S. officials ap
proached the Nicaraguans several weeks ago to try to arrange a
meeting with Foreign Minister Miguel d'Escoto at the United Nations
but that the two sides could not agree on details.
If a meeting is arranged, it would be the first such high-level con
tact since the Reagan Administration broke off formal peace talks in
January. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega tried to arrange a
meeting with President Reagan at the United Nations this week but
was refused an appointment by the White House. He did, however,
greet the president in a reception line Wednesday night.
"Our policy hasn't changed," Reap said. "The Sandinistas aren't
going to hear anything different from what they've heard before. But
other countries wanted us to meet with them. And it seemed to be
about time to let them know from the horse's mouth that we want
them to start a dialogue with the (Nicaraguan) opposition."
U.S. Rejects U.N. Agreement
NEW YORK — The celebration of the United Nations' 40th
birthday was marred yesterday when its 159 members were unable
to reach agreement on what was to have been the day's centerpiece
— a declaration listing U.N. accomplishments and objectives.
The sticking point, U.S. officials said, was an Arab demand that
the declaration contain a call for "the right of self-determination of
the Palestinian people," and a phrase implying the objective of having
Israel withdraw from all occupied territories.
/ The United States refused to accept the Arab paragraph, and this
prevented the unanimous consent necessary for the adoption of the
full text by the General Assembly.
A West European diplomat called the dispute an "unfortunate sym
bol" of the futility the organization has long experienced. "After the
rhetoric of the past week," she said, "here we are, back to the
realities, to the real United Nations."
The deadlock solidified at the last minute as the assembly hall was
packed with dignitaries, including Vice President Bush, attending the
climactic ceremony of the United Nations' week-long celebration.
They heard speeches by Assembly President Jaime de Pinies of
Spain and Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who said:
"The observance of this anniversary has meaning not so much as a
symbol but as an opportunity. The occasion has set the stage to
make a fresh beginning and try to overcome current stalemates on
major issues."
As he spoke, however, the committee that had spent a year draft
ing the declaration to be adopted as the assembly's final ceremonial
act was in a basement conference room in the throes of the impasse.
Allies Support Reagan on Talks
NEW YORK — President Reagan and the leaders of five other
democracies meet here yesterday for a mini-summit in preparation
for next month's summit in Geneva with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev.
"They expressed full support for President Reagan in his talks in
Geneva," Secretary of State George Shultz declared after the five
nation meeting. "What they supported was the notion that all the dif
ferent issues being discussed are important."
The meeting, which took place at the United Nations, came
shortly after Reagan delivered a speech to the U.N. General Assem
bly stressing that regional differences with the Soviet Union deserve
equal time when he meets with Gorbachev on Nov. 19-20.
The Allied leaders, in an apparent effort not to undercut Reagan
on the eve of the summit — his first with a Soviet head of state since
taking office — were careful to emphasize their overall endorsement
of the U. S. approach.
Bettino Craxi, the Italian prime minister whose government fell
last seek as a result of his role in the release of Abul Abbas, the al
leged mastermind of the Achille Lauro hijacking, stressed his sup
port of the U.S. position in the upcoming talks. Craxi was in New
York as Italy's acting prime minister and is expected to be asked to
assume the leadership of a new coalition government.
Swap Frees Duarte's Daughter
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — President Jose Napoleon
Duarte and his eldest daughter were reunited in a tropical downpour
yesterday, 44 days after Ines Guadalupe Duarte Duran was kid
napped from a private university in the capital.
The emotional reunion on the soccer field of the Capt. Gerardo
Barrios Military School was part of the largest' exchange of political
prisoners and wounded in the history of this country's six-year civil
war.
Under the agreement reached Tuesday with the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, an alliance of five rebel armies fighting the
U.S.-backed Duarte government, the rebels were to release Duarte
Duran, a friend kidnapped with her and 33 mayors and municipal offi
cials captured since April. The government, in turn, pledged to free
