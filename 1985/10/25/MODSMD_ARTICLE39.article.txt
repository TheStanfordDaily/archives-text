# Reagan Calls for Fresh Start With Soviets
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS â€” President Reagan
yesterday denounced Soviet expansionism in
Asia, Africa and Central America but called for a
"fresh start" in U.S.-Soviet relations through a
three-step initiative designed to resolve conflicts
in Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, Ethiopia and
Nicaragua.
The new proposal was the centerpiece of
Reagan's speech to the U.N. General Assembly
on a busy day of diplomacy. The president also
held a mini-summit with leaders of five industria
lized democracies and met for 30 minutes with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
In his 30-minute address on the 40th anniver
sary of the founding of the United Nations, the
president said that "true peace" and progress at
next month's Geneva summit with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev was possible only through
candid discussion of U.S.-Soviet differences and
a "realistic view of the world."
This view, as expressed by Reagan, holds the
Soviets responsible for continuing conflicts in
Third World trouble spots, which the president
said "are the consequence of an ideology
imposed from without, dividing nations and
creating regimes that are ... at war with their
own people."
"And in each case," the president added,
"Marxism-Leninism's war with the people
becomes war with their neighbors."
In a speech his advisers said was designed to
recapture the public relations initiative for the
United States and emphasize Soviet vul
nerability, the president stressed regional con
flicts and subordinated discussion of arms control
except for promoting his Strategic Defense Ini

tiative (SDI), the so-called "Star Wars" plan.
The president proposed "a regional peace
process" in which combatants in the five speci
fied countries would begin direct negotiations
with a view to "achieving an end to violence, the
withdrawal of foreign troops and national recon
ciliation."
Once these negotiations were under way, the
United States and the Soviet Union would hold
separate discussions to encourage the bargaining
of the warring parties, he said.
If these first two steps proved successful,
Reagan said, "the United States would respond
generously" by "welcoming each country back
into the world economy so its citizens can share
in the dynamic growth that other developing
countries . . . enjoy."
Reagan did not specify what this "welcoming"
would mean, but a senior Administration official
said it would include U.S. economic aid to the
five nations once the disputes were resolved and
all foreign troops withdrawn.
Except for some perfunctory clapping by So
viet Ambassador Anatoli Dobrynin, the Soviet
delegation headed by Shevardnadze sat silently
through Reagan's speech and did not applaud
when he had finished.
Shevardnadze, speaking to the General As
sembly two hours after Reagan's address,
agreed with the need to end "small wars" but
blamed the United States for many of the world's
regional problems.
Specifically, he referred to Vietnam, "where
neither people nor the environment have been
able even now to recover from the conse
quences of the barbarous aggression which has

maimed the entire country with napalm and
chemical agents."
Shevardnadze also said that in Afghanistan and
Nicaragua "the bullets of hired assassins ... are
killing thousands of people."
Western leaders, including West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Israeli Prime Mini
ster Shimon Peres, expressed cautious approval
of Reagan's speech. Privately, some western
and Third World diplomats said they were
surprised at the president's harsh tone toward
Moscow, in view of the conciliatory tone he took
on regional issues in a U.N. speech last year.
In his address, Reagan staunchly defended his
proposal for a space-based strategic missile
defense system. He cited former Soviet premier
Alexei Kosygin's advocacy of a missile defense
system in 1967, when the proposal was opposed
by the Johnson administration.
Officials said that Reagan's speech yesterday,
intended to be substantive in purpose but un
provocative in tone, reflected the reality of the
forthcoming summit in which the United States
and the Soviets are competing for world public
opinion.
"When Mr. Gorbachev and I meet in Geneva
next month, I look to a fresh start in the relation
ship of our two nations," Reagan said. "We can
and should meet in the spirit that we can deal
with our differences peacefully. That is what we
expect."
Shevardnadze's half hour meeting with
Reagan late yesterday was described by Shultz
as "essentially base-touching" in advance of the
Reagan-Gorbachev summit.
