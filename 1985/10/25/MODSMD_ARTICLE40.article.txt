## Senate Blocks Arms Sale to Jordan 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Senate,
handing President Reagan a foreign
policy defeat, blocked an Adminis
tration proposal yesterday to sell
arms to Jordan. Such a sale has now
been halted by Congress three
times in the last three years.
The 97-1 vote ruled out a pro
posed sale of fighter planes and
anti-aircraft missiles unless Jordan's
King Hussein actually enters direct
peace talks with Israel. The Admin
istration had hoped to avoid the
peace talks condition because it ap
peared coercive.
• Secretary of State George Shultz

had lobbied for the sale, saying that
Hussein deserved it as a sign of
U.S. support for his regime as he
moved cautiously toward peace
talks.
But Israel and its supporters
campaigned earlier and harder
against the sale, and the proposal
never got off the ground.
The Senate bill, which the House
was expected to endorse,
postponed the $1.9 billion deal until
March 1, or until Jordan and Israel
open meaningful peace talks, at
which time Congress can vote on

the proposal again.
Senators and State Department
officials said one reason for the
lopsided outcome was that Reagan
and Shultz, preoccupied by the
coming U.S.-Soviet summit, never
gave the issue their full attention
and never brought their full influ
ence to bear-.
Meanwhile, King Hussein of Jor
dan warned the Reagan Administra
tion yesterday that relations be
tween Amman and Washington will
suffer because of the delay in ap
proving the arms sale.

Hussein said that postponing the
sale would constitute "reneging" on
Jordan's agreement with Washing
ton and that it would be the last
time the Jordanians attempt to se
cure the weapons package of jet
fighters and surface-to-air missiles
from the United States.
The 49-year-old monarch said
that the United States, by adopting
such a position, "will have damaged
its own credibility in terms of the
role it could play for its own inter
ests and for the interests of all in
the area."
