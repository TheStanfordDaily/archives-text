Senate Endorses Cuts
' WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday
flexed its muscles on trade, voting in favor of a
bill to curtail sharply imports of textiles and
shoes. The bill faces an almost certain veto by
President Reagan.
Caught in a procedural muddle that the lead
ership said threatened congressional efforts to
reduce the budget deficit, the Senate stopped
short of final passage of the bill.
Nonetheless, the 54-to-42 vote for the
textile and shoe measure showed that con
gressional demands for action on record trade
deficits remains strong. The textile and shoe
measure got one more vote yesterday than it
did in an earlier test vote three weeks ago.
The House earlier approved a bill calling for
sharper cuts in imports of textiles, but omit
ting protection for the American shoe indus
try. The House vote was 262-159.
Both yesterday's Senate vote and the Oct.
10 House vote, however, fell short of the two
thirds majority needed to override a veto.
Deficit Package Stalls
WASHINGTON — A three-year package of
deficit reductions was approved yesterday by
the House but stalled in the Senate in a dispute

over trade controls and other issues.
The so-called budget "reconciliation" bills
are down payments on $276 billion in three
year deficit reductions that Congress pledged
in the budget it adopted last summer for the
current fiscal year.
Together with two companion measures,
the House bill, approved by a largely party-line
vote of 228 to 199, would cut domestic pro
grams by $78 billion through fiscal 1988.
The Senate measure, which was shelved
temporarily last night in order to resolve the
trade dispute, would cut the programs by $85
billion over the same period.
While both House and Senate versions meet
targets set in the congressional budget, veto
threats have been heard from the White
House.
Administration officials accuse both houses
of larding the measures with excessive spend
ing, and they object to revenue-generating
provisions, including continuation of the 16-
cent-a-pack tax on cigarettes.
SDI Cuts Refused
WASHINGTON — The House Appropria
tions Committee, heeding arguments that
President Reagan will need a strong hand at
next month's U.S.-Soviet summit, refused

yesterday to slash $400 million from proposed
funding for the Administration's Strategic
Defense Initiative, the so-called "Star Wars"
plan.
At the same time, the committee, reviving
the heated congressional battle over nerve gas
production, voted narrowly to delete all funds
for chemical weapons from the fiscal 1986 mili
tary spending bill.
Both actions were taken shortly before the
committee approved the $276.5 billion defense
appropriations bill on a voice vote. The bill pro
vides $27.5 billion less than Reagan originally
requested and $1.3 billion less than last year's
funding level, but committee members
asserted that major weapons programs and the
armed forces' readiness capability would not
be diminished.
On the Star Wars issue, the committee
voted 31-23 to reject an amendment that
would have reduced funds for Star Wars re
search to $2.1 billion —a 50 percent increase
over last year's funding level — instead of the
$2.5 billion listed in the legislation.
