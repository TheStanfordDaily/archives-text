Killer Pleads Innocent
LOS ANGELES — After brandishing a pen
tagram on the palm of his hand, "Night
Stalker" defendant Richard Ramirez pleaded
innocent yesterday to 14 murders and 54 other
felonies, then left court shouting "Hail, Satan."
As he entered court, manacled and in leg
irons yesterday, Ramirez had held up his left
palm twice, revealing a scrawled pentagram
that had the numerals "666" below. The pen
tagram is often used as a symbol of Satan, and
"666" is referred to in the Bible's Revelation
as the mark of the Antichrist.
While authorities reject Satanism as a
motive for the "Night Stalker" killings, they
have said pentagrams were found at some of

the murder scenes.
Ramirez yelled "Hail, Satan," as he was led
from court after entering his pleas. The quote
was confirmed by the court stenographer and
reporters' tape recordings, but Ramirez' attor
neys denied hearing it.
Whale Coax Attempt
RIO VISTA — Federal marine biologists,
using the submerged sounds of clanging pipes,
began an unusual effort yesterday to persuade
an errant, 45-ton humpback whale to leave the
fresh-water Sacramento River and reach the
salty safety of the Pacific Ocean.
Officials halted the operation after two

hours, fearing the confused mammal would
become "over stressed," said Bev Passerello,
of the state Office of Emergency Services.
They planned to resume action by the
middle of today.
Boats, approaching near the whale, formed
a slow-moving semicircle, coercing the mam
mal to move southward toward the Pacific
Ocean. By 2:30 p.m., the animal was hesitat
ing at a small wooden bridge midway along
Shag Slough, some 70 miles northeast of San
Francisco Bay.
But a short while later, the whale still balked
at passing the bridge, and experts scrubbed
the operation for the day. Passerello said offi
cials would remove pilings from the small
bridge to encourage the animal to continue.
