# Senate Encounters Rebholz Views and Centennial Funding
## Prof, criticizes Hoover ties 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
Allegations of political partisan
ship in the Hoover Institution and a
preliminary report on the funding
priorities of the University's $483
million Centennial Campaign high
lighted yesterday's meeting of the
Faculty Senate.
In remarks to the senate, English
Prof. Ron Rebholz challenged the
role of the Hoover Institution on
campus, saying that while the
senate has no authority to regulate
Hoover, the institution's policies di
rectly impact the University.
"I realize (the senate has) no
power in any official way to change
the relationship or get rid of
Hoover, but I think we could (have
some impact) if we set our minds to
it," Rebholz said.
In an an Oct. 21 letter to the sen
ate, Rebholz claimed that
"overwhelming evidence" exists
"documenting the political mission
and activities of the Hoover Institu
tion." That letter was co-authored
with Political Science Prof. John
Manley.
In their letter, Manley and Reb
holz charged that a recent senate
report on Hoover-University rela
tions ignores the institution's politi
cal activities, which they said in
clude services to conservative can
didates and attempts to influence
public opinion.
The recommendations of the
report, headed by Sociology Prof.
Sanford Dornbusch, were approved
by the senate without consideration
of the methods of analysis, Rebholz
said.
Rebholz asked the Senate Steering
Committee to schedule formal
debate on the subject. Communica
tion Prof. Elie Abel, chairman of the
senate, said the request would be
considered.
In other business, Provost James
Rosse and Vice President for De
velopment Henry Riggs presented
a joint report on the status of the
University's Centennial Campaign,
a major fund-raising drive sched
uled to net the University $483 mil
lion in academic and physical im
provements over the next 10
years.
In addition to supplementing
major construction prqjects, money
raised through the Centennial Cam
paign will enable Stanford to in
crease funding for a variety of aca
demic disciplines, especially in the
arts and humanities, where "we
think a new initiative needs to take
place," Rosse said.
Included in the $483 million are
$150 million for the Campus Near
West construction and renovation

project, $150 million for 100
endowed professorships, $22 mil
lion for new student residences and
residential education and $25 mil
lion each for undergraduate scholar
ships and new academic programs.
The report resulted from careful
review of University needs and
dealt with the necessity of balancing
academic priorities with fund
raising capabilities, Rosse said.
"It's pointless to propose a pro
gram of development in a particular
field unless we really have the
means to carry it out," Rosse said.
"Academic priorities cannot be
translated one for one with fund
raising priorities, and they have not
been here," Riggs said.
External "market testing" of the
preliminary report among principal
donors and chief fund-raisers has
yielded encouraging results, Riggs
said.
Despite these positive results,
Riggs said University administra
tors and fund raisers must present

the University in a "unique light" if
their efforts are to be successful in
the competition for funds.
According to Rosse, the Univer
sity will have to find "other" means
of funding "worthy" projects
bypassed by the Centennial Cam
paign.
Before the Centennial report,
Rosse updated the senate on the
status of University negotiations
with the United Stanford Workers.
The union has voted to strike Oct.
31 if no agreement has been
reached.
"The University's negotiating
team and the union's negotiating
team are deeply involved in very
hard bargaining," Rosse said.
"Time is getting shorter, (but) ap
parently not all of the final offers are
on the table yet."
