# Equestrian Center Expands at a Gallop
## 
### SCOTT ROTH Staff writer 
Stanford, known to many as the Farm, has not
forgotten its equine roots. The stock farm where
horses were bred and trained closed in 1903, but
the area once occupied by such legendary horses
as Electioneer and Advertiser is now the home
to the Stanford Equestrian Center.
Like the old breeding farm, the hub of activity
at the Equestrian Center is the old red barn.
Though a little tattered, the barn still remains
much the same as it did when Gov. Leland Stan
ford and Edweard Muybridge conducted their
experiments that led to the first motion pictures.
The center, which sits on more than 60 acres,
is surrounded by the golf course, the driving
range and Junipero Serra Boulevard. Its facilities
include stables, numerous rings for teaching and
riding and open space for trail riding.
The center also provides students with a
chance to learn, improve or master their riding
skills. It offers classes for everyone from first
time riders to show jumpers. All classes are
listed in the course catalog.
The stable currently has about 16 horses for
people to use, and is in the process of building an
equestrian team, according to center officials.
