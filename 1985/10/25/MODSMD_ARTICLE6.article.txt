# Equestrian Center Expands at a Gallop
## 
### SCOTT ROTH Staff writer 
Stanford, known to many as the Farm, has not
forgotten its equine roots. The stock farm where
horses were bred and trained closed in 1903, but
the area once occupied by such legendary horses
as Electioneer and Advertiser is now the home
to the Stanford Equestrian Center.
Like the old breeding farm, the hub of activity
at the Equestrian Center is the old red barn.
Though a little tattered, the barn still remains
much the same as it did when Gov. Leland Stan
ford and Edweard Muybridge conducted their
experiments that led to the first motion pictures.
The center, which sits on more than 60 acres,
is surrounded by the golf course, the driving
range and Junipero Serra Boulevard. Its facilities
include stables, numerous rings for teaching and
riding and open space for trail riding.
The center also provides students with a
chance to learn, improve or master their riding
skills. It offers classes for everyone from first
time riders to show jumpers. All classes are
listed in the course catalog.
The stable currently has about 16 horses for
people to use, and is in the process of building an
equestrian team, according to center officials.

a little more competitive, Stanford also has
a polo team, which is based at Webb Ranch
in Portola Valley.
The center also sponsors internships for
students to teach and work at the stables.
More information on the internships can be
obtained from the stable office. In addition,
courses in the care and feeding of horses
are available.
Unfortunately, if students wish to ride off
into the sunset, they must enroll in a class,
as the center does not rent horses.
Laurie Wilmore, a freshman who makes
use of the center's facilities, said she thinks
highly them.
"I think that everyone there is really
friendly," she said. "The horses, for school
(teaching) horses, are very nice and well
mannered. It's also a good place to meet
people."
Sue Trott, also a freshman, is a member
of the fledgling equestrian team.
"I think the center has a lot of good
rings," she said. "It should be a good place
to have practice."
Trott stressed that the equestrian team
needs money and its own horses "It's hard
to practice on horses that have been used
all day by beginning riders," she said.
Before running out to enroll in a class,
students should be aware that the center
charges a $200 per quarter fee for the use
of the horses and instruction. This fee is
used to cover the costs involved in caring
for and feeding the animals.
"The fee is necessary, but it's too bad,"
Wilmore said. "It makes it hard for a lot of
people who want to ride but can't afford it."
