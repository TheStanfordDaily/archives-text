# Study of Schools Receives Grant

A new technique for evaluating secondary
education through collaboration with teachers
and administrators has proved so successful
that the three-year program between Stan
ford and 13 Bay Area high schools has been
extended to the end of 1985 through a foun
dation grant of $150,000, according to offi
cials involved with the program.
In the program, the Study of Stanford and
the Schools (SSATS), Stanford researchers
worked closely and intensely with high school
educators instead of the usual brief visits and
surveys. Teams of Stanford faculty members
evaluated schools through personal observa
tion and group questioning of high school
educators.
University President Donald Kennedy and
J. Myron Atkin, dean of the School of Educa
tion, initiated the program in 1982 to compile
a profile of Bay Area secondary schools.
Education Prof. Eliot Eisner, who was in
charge of the panel on curriculum, said the
researchers spent 1,600 hours in four high
schools "shadowing" teachers and students
to "try to understand something about the
culture of the high school."
Formulation of data and conclusions was

"highly collaborative with people in nearby
school districts," which was useful in
"defining lines of action and interpreting"
problem situations, Atkin said.
The research was restricted to a local area
because of the extensive feedback and col
laboration with the subjects. Atkins said,
however, that researchers and institutions

'People who are responsible for carrying out the
changes should have a major role in formulating
them.'

outside the Bay Area are interested in the
study. "Others are interested in the col
laboration, but I would have to suspend
judgment" as to whether the local findings
are nationally applicable, he said. "With
respect to the findings themselves, I think
we'll have to wait and see" how broadly they
can be applied.
According to Atkin, the important aspect of
the SSATS is that it "highlights the impor
tance of people in schools for people doing re
search (on schools). . . People who are re

sponsible for carrying out the changes should
have a major roll in formulating them." The
University researchers are "very good at data
collection but aren't as good at figuring lines
of action," Atkin said.
Eisner said researchers found that
"teachers are relatively isolated from their
colleagues because of the large amount of

teaching time required. The high school
teacher "does more teaching in one month
than a Stanford professor does in three
months," Eisner said.
"There are some people who are doing
remarkably good teaching at the high school
level," though they have, "very little time
during the day to reflect" and analyze what
they are doing, Eisner said. "Teachers need
to be less isolated and have more access to
helpful but critical feedback on their own
work."

In addition to the isolation of teachers, the
research teams identified a general
"structured fragmentation" as the major
problem facing the secondary schools, Eisner
said. "Subjects are isolated from each other
and there is a lot of fragmentation in the
school day. . . . Reward systems tend to em
phasize extrinsic rewards for students —
particularly high achieving students" who
concentrate on test scores and grades in
stead of the intrinsic rewards of the learning
process.
Because of this "structured fragmentation"
and"the frenetic character of the secondary
education, teachers and students learn how
to react without getting too involved in their
respective work," Eisner said.
According to Atkin, this study is unlike
others because it "tends to give a bottom-up
view." The study concentrates on the
"perspective of student on up . . . rather
than on society as a whole," he said.
The success of the methods used in the
SSATS has sparked interest in the further ap
plication of these research techniques in the
field of education. Atkin said the School of
Education is currently discussing how it will
continue the work and perhaps apply it to
other areas and projects.
