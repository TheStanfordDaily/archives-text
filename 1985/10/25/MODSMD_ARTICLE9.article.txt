# Defector Describes the Soviet Situation

### ELAINE RIGGS Staff writer 
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev cannot bring about
reform in the Soviet Union, a former member of the
Soviet Academy of Sciences who defected from that
country told a Branner Hall audience last night.
Mikhail Voslensky, who left the Soviet Union in
1977, called hopes for economic reform "wishful think
ing" because Gorbachev "can only do what the party
apparatus wants . . . and (party leaders) have no inter
est whatsoever in any reforms. Everything belongs to
them."
Voslensky defined the party apparatus as the
nomenclatura to which he said he belonged before
defecting. "As a member of the nomenclatura, you
could live your whole life and almost never meet the
population ... yet they pretend to be representatives
of the people," he said.
"The average citizen knows no details about the
nomenclaturahe said. "It's all top secret."
Voslensky was a member of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences and an executive in the Soviet Disarmament
Commission. A former Soviet professor, he is the au
thor of the best-selling book, "Nomenclatura: The So
viet Ruling Class."
"The Soviet Union has an extreme(ly) conservative
and reactionary political structure having nothing to do
with the Marxist idea," Voslensky said. "They have
strong police, a huge army and their state machine is
much stronger and more omnipresent than those of
capitalist) countries."

He assessed the effects of the 1917 Bolshevik Revo
lution, noting that the pre-revolutionary "aristocracy"
made up 1.4 percent of the population, and that the
current figure is 1.1 percent. "The nomenclatura is the
new aristocracy of the Soviet Union," he said.
"The nomenclatura sees the West as efficient, a suc
cess economically," Voslensky said. "But they con
sider democracy a stupid, weak system. . . . They are
ineffective economically but much stronger politically.
They can compare themselves with us and be the vic
tor politically.
"They are prepared to use local wars in the Third
World, as in Afghanistan. But they are not prepared to
accept a big war, because against all their potential
enemies they would be defeated," he said.
In Europe, the Soviet nomenclatura uses
"intimidation by Soviet military force," he said. "They
provoke such hysterical reactions. They are rather
successful," he continued.
But rather than try to intimidate the United States,
the Soviets "try psychological pressure," he said.
"(The Soviets) don't expect the U.S. to accept their
latest proposal (on reducing nuclear arms). They ex
pect you to pressure the government to make some
concessions and start talks.
"Gorbachev is a man to whom many hopes are
linked," Voslensky said. "Some people think that he
could change relations between the East and West. But
he cannot. Stalin could, Krushchev maybe, but after
him, no one.
"(Gorbachev) can only do what the nomenclatura
wants," he said.
