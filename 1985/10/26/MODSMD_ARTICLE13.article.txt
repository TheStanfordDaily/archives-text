### TOM SENF Editorial Staff 
Stanford's dreams of a winning season in Coach Jack
Elway's first year at the helm were ended on this fall
night in Tucson. With the help of the Cardinal special
teams, the Wildcats jumped to a 21-0 halftime lead and
cruised to a 28-14 victory.
It was a terrible night for Stanford punter Doug
Robison, who failed to get the ball away on each of his
first three punt attempts. Once he was tackled trying
to avoid the Arizona rush, and twice he was buried
after mishandling the center snap.
Most of the pressure came from All-Pacific 10
Conference safety Allan Durden. Durden came at
Robison untouched on each of the first two punt at
tempts, resulting in a 10-0 Arizona lead.
"After the first one, he (Robison) was terrified," said
Durden, who also had an interception. "I got in clean
again."

Trailing by 21 points, it didn't seem as if things could
get any worse for the Cardinal in the second half. They
could, and they did.
Late in the third quarter, Stanford's 1984 Most
Valuable Player, linebacker David Wyman, went down
with a severe injury. On a low but legal block from
Vance Johnson, Wyman suffered a dislocated right
knee, damaging several ligaments.
Team physician Don Bunce described the extent of
the injury. "This is an unusual football injury," he said.
"This normally happens more often in car or motor
cycle accidents."
There were, however, a couple of bright spots for
the Cardinal on this otherwise dark evening. In the
third quarter, linebacker Tom Briehl intercepted an
Alfred Jenkins pass and returned it 53 yards for a
touchdown.
After Fred Buckley's fourth-quarter touchdown run
made the score 28-13, Mark Harmon booted the extra
point to become Stanford's all-time leading scorer,
surpassing Darrin Nelson.
