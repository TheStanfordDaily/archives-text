# Band Sends Letter
## 
### 
Ha, ha, ha, ha. We are back,
despite the fact that we were
thoroughly frisked by several
dozen policemen at USC (We're
really tired of them). So, the
pre-game show is an interesting
one, full of interesting facts
about the University.
A freshman letter home:
"Dear mom and dad, school is
really an interesting experience.
Oh, guess what ... I have a
roommate who is gross and dis
gusting. He listens to Pat Boone
albums. ... I hate him. I've
adopted a theme song: Things
Can Only Get Better.' Oh well.
There's this class, you see
Intro to William Shakespeare. I
keep falling asleep. I can't
believe how boring the class is.
zzzzz.
When I was a pro-fro, I had a
wild time, so I figured that I
could have a wild time on the
weekend. I looked forward to
'One More Saturday Night.'

But, despite the fact that I pay
through the nose to go to school
here, Residential Education
stole our beer keg and left us a
baby bottle.
Luckily, I found a really
wholesome American Band
called the LSJUMB. . . . Now I
am happy.
Love, EdM. Beaux"
Then comes halftime.
OOOOOOH!!!
Games are important. . . let's
trace their evolution!
There is "Musical Chairs"
during our youth. Is this
"Sesame Street"?
There is "Spin the Bottle"
during our puberty. What fun,
fun, fun.
There is "Quarters"-in college
(If it is okay with Residential
Education. We use soda pop!
Honest.)
And finally . . . the game of
the aged and wise . . . the "Old
Folks Boogie."
