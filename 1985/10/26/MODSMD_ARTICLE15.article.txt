# JC Transfers Make Immediate Impact
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff Writer 
As college football gets more and more
competitive each year, so do the annual
recruiting wars. Each school looks to sign the
top players coming out of the high school
ranks to national letters of intent.
But while the recruiting of high school
phenoms grabs a lot of media attention, the
nation's top junior college players rarely
garner much publicity. *
Many four-year colleges are now looking to
the junior college ranks to solidify their
rosters. Stanford Recruiting Coordinator
Dick James explained that the experience
players obtain during two seasons at junior
colleges can put them a step ahead of incom
ing freshmen.
While coaches often try to ease freshmen
into the starting lineup, James indicated that a
player coming from a junior college must, in
general, be able to help the team quickly,
since he only has two years of college
eligibility remaining.
'We look for someone who can make an
immediate impact, who can challenge for a
starting spot," James said.
Through Paul Wiggin's four-year coaching
reign (1980-83), the Cardinal rarely recruited
outside of high schools. 'We didn't have suc
cess with admissions," James said.
Jack Elway, however, in his first recruiting
opportunity as the Cardinal head coach,
looked seriously at junior college players last
year and was able to bring four to Stanford.
'We really made a concerted effort last year,"
James said. "And we were successful. They
(the transfers) have all improved the team."

Two of the transfers offensive guard
Guy Bunyard and wide receiver Rod Shull
came from within the state of California while
the other two defensive tackle Tony
Leiker and defensive back Chris Young
are from Kansas and Texas, respectively.
Of the four, Bunyard, Leiker and Young
have all started at some point this season,
while an injury suffered during the spring has
set Shull back in his attempt to step into a
starting receiver role.
Young a Grid Wire Honorable Mention
All-America while at Wharton County Junior
College was recruited in the hope that he
could help improve a much-maligned Cardinal
secondary.
While he has been in and out of the starting
lineup, Young's spirits are still high. "I'm get
ting better every day," he said. "I'm really
excited."
"This week I'll be playing in nickel situa
tions (five defensive backs) and on special
teams."
Young indicated that his decision to attend
a junior college out of high school was an easy
one. "I was only offered scholarships by small
four-year schools," he explained. "I figured if
I did well (at a junior college) I could get a
scholarship to a big school."
And that he did. Young was recruited by
many schools during his sophomore season at
Wharton County, and he ultimately decided
on Stanford. "I wanted to see another part of
the country," he said. "And, of course, the
academics at Stanford are great."
Leiker, a defensive end and defensive
tackle at Coffeyville Junior College in Kansas,
has started at defensive tackle for the Card
inal this season. "He has been a fixture on the
defense," James said.

Bunyard and Shull have not seen consider
able action this season, though Bunyard did
start last week at USC in place of the injured
Tom Nye.
The Arizona Wildcats today's opponent
are currently atop the Pac-10 standings
and part of their success can be attributed to
the play of junior college transfers Dan Lock
ett and Ruben Rodriguez, both from the Col
lege of the Sequoias in Visalia.

Lockett, an outside linebacker, leads the
Pac-10 with eight quarterback sacks this
season and has recorded 55 tackles (29 unas
sisted).
Rodriguez was third among Pac-10 punters
with a 41.8 yard average prior to last week's
action. His longest punt of the season was 59
yards, and he has not had a punt blocked this
season.

action. His longest punt of the season was 59
yards, and he has not had a punt blocked this
season.
