# Sutherland Makes Big Hit In Stanford's Secondary
## 
### TOM GILLESPIE Staff writer 
There were few highlights in last
Saturday's 30-6 thrashing at the
hands of USC in Los Angeles. One
bright spot, however, was the ex
cellent performance turned in by
freshman strong safety Sam Suth
erland.
In only the second start of his
collegiate career, Sutherland led
the team with 16 tackles, seven of
them unassisted. He was
everywhere on the field, displaying
the promise that led the Stanford
coaching staff to remove him from
the redshirt list just two weeks ago.
Sutherland arrived on campus
following an outstanding high school
career in which he earned First-
Team All-Pacific League and All-
City honors in Los Angeles. He
turned down scholarship offers
from a host of schools, including
Oklahoma, USC, California and
Rice, in order to attend Stanford.
But once at Stanford, he found
that he was going to Lave to work

hard and prove himself if he ex
pected to play this year. Defensive
Coordinator and Secondary Coach
Dick Mannini explains. "Our initial
plan for Sam was to try and
preserve a year of eligibility by red
shirting him, unless he proved that
he could have an immediate impact
on the defense." At the conclusion
of preseason practice, he was
indeed redshirted.
A few weeks into the season,
however, it was apparent that a
shake-up was needed in a defense
that had been somewhat charitable.
Talk of activating Sutherland arose,
and he traveled with the varsity to
San Diego State three weeks ago to
witness another poor defensive
showing.
Following that game, the coach
ing staff felt that it was time to in
ject a little future potential into the
present. Sutherland was activated
prior to the UCLA game two weeks
ago, a move that was greeted en
thusiastically by the freshman.
"When I was being recruited,
they said I had a chance to play this

year. I was hoping very much to
play. I think it's a copout for a fresh
man to come in and want to red
shirt," Sutherland said.
"It was apparent that the skills he
was exhibiting in practice and the
progress he was making as a foot
ball player placed him in a position
to compete for a starting spot,"
Mannini said.
Though it was a move the Card
inal coaches were reluctant to
make, they can't complain about the
play of their rookie safety. He has,
without a doubt, lived up to his bil
ling as a very hard hitter in the sec
ondary.
"Sam is a very physical kid, no
question about it. He plays at one
speed all the time, and that's full,"
Mannini said.
"That's the way I've always
played football. I don't like the
'nice-guy' attitude. Making a big hit
can get an entire team pumped up,"
Sutherland said.
Blessed with good strength and
4.43 speed in the 40, Sutherland

has the tools to be an outstanding
defensive back, but he still needs to
improve on some aspects of his
game.
"He has great intuition and ball
awareness, and he supports the run
very well," Mannini said.
"However, he has a tendency to
over-relax in between plays. There
are times when he doesn't appear
completely prepared on the snap of
the ball. It's something that he has
to work on, but it will disappear the

more experience he gets."
If Sutherland continues to blos
som, he will play a large part in
Stanford's defense this year and
may well help the team to some up
set wins. As for the future, Mannini
said, "He's simply going to get
stronger and faster every year.
With experience, the freshman
mistakes will disappear, and his ag
gressive play and hard-hitting style
are going to be a tremendous bene
fit to this defense."

"The guys in college are a lot bigger and a lot faster than in high
school," Stanford strong safety Sam Sutherland said. Here, he
finds out how much faster. Sutherland, nonetheless, is averaging
11 tackles a game in his two starts this season.

defensive back, but he still needs to
improve on some aspects of his
game.
"He has great intuition and ball
awareness, and he supports the run
very well," Mannini said.
"However, he has a tendency to
over-relax in between plays. There
are times when he doesn't appear
completely prepared on the snap of
the ball. It's something that he has
to work on, but it will disappear the

more experience he gets."
If Sutherland continues to blos
som, he will play a large part in
Stanford's defense this year and
may well help the team to some up
set wins. As for the future, Mannini
said, "He's simply going to get
stronger and faster every year.
With experience, the freshman
mistakes will disappear, and his ag
gressive play and hard-hitting style
are going to be a tremendous bene
fit to this defense."

"The guys in college are a lot bigger and a lot faster than in high
school," Stanford strong safety Sam Sutherland said. Here, he
finds out how much faster. Sutherland, nonetheless, is averaging
11 tackles a game in his two starts this season.
