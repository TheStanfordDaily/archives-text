# Classroom Honors for Soderlund and Scott
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
At least by one measure, Stan
ford football is getting better each
year.
Four players from the 1984
squad were named second-team
Academic Ail-Americans the
most in the team's history. Two of
those players, linebacker Matt
Soderlund and tailback Kevin Scott,
are back this year, playing well as
always, and taking 16 units each in
their free time.
But despite their hectic fall
schedules, they seem perfectly
relaxed as they walk off the practice
field in the middle of the week.
Both smile and joke as they field
questions, and a coach passing by
warns the reporter interviewing
them that he is talking to "a couple
of questionable guys."
Soderlund, a co-terminal student
in human biology and food research,
laughs when told that The Daily
wants to do a story on the academic
awards that he and Scott have
received. "Kevin Scott's my
spokesman," he replies. "He'll an
swer all your questions."
Scott, an electrical engineering
major in his fourth year at Stanford,

notes with a straight face that
Soderlund has taught him every
thing he knows.
Then they begin discussing
academics.
"I get by during the season and
then make a big push at the end of
the quarter, after Thanksgiving,"
Soderlund says.
"If you budget your time, you can
do it," Scott says of his academic
achievement.
Both players, along with last
year's senior guard Scott Carpenter
and senior wide receiver Emile
Harry, received Pacific 10 Confer
ence All-Academic Team honors as
well as Academic All-America
status. The distinctions are
reserved for athletes who have per
formed exceptionally well both on
the field and in the classroom.
"Hard work pays off," says
Soderlund of the honors. "It's nice
to get a little recognition... a little
cake."
Soderlund discusses the difficulty
of getting work done during the
football season. He estimates that
practices and game time amount to
about 30 hours per week during the
season, but adds, "It's not really
the hours you put in, it's the en
ergy."

That is not to say the hours don't
make a dent in Soderlund's
schedule.
Players show up at 1 p.m. for
practice Monday through Thursday,
work out from about 2 to 5 p.m.,
and leave the training table at 7
p.m., tired and sore.
On Friday, the team travels
(when Stanford is playing away),
and Saturday game day is not
traditionally a big study day for the
squad.
That leaves one day of rest for
the players, but Scott mentions that
the obligatory Sunday night team
meeting not only keeps them away
from their books, but ensures that
they miss every ASSU Sunday
Flick.
Soderlund notes, though, that he
does just as well in school, or bet
ter, fall quarter as he does winter
and spring. Scott agrees.
They discuss the discipline they
have learned from sports, saying
that it transfers into their study
habits.
And they talk about the things
they have to give up to play football
and take a full course load.
"Seeing some of your friends just
doesn't happen," he says. "I'll say
'Hi' to them maybe twice the whole
season."
Scott mentions a guitar gathering

dust in his room. He'd love to have
the time to play it, but that will wait
until the season ends.
Soderlund, asked whether he
made a mistake in coming to a
school that emphasizes academics
over intercollegiate sports, turns
the question around.
"There's no less emphasis on
athletics here than anywhere else,"
he says. "The time commitment is
the same here as everywhere."

Scott says Stanford gives the in
dividual "more opportunity to do
what he wants, to forgo winter con
ditioning if he wants to study."
It would seem that the more in
dividualized approach to training
could pose a problem for an athlete
who is not particularly self
motivated. But somehow that
doesn't seem to be a worry for
Scott and Soderlund.

warns the reporter interviewing
them that he is talking to "a couple
of questionable guys."
Soderlund, a co-terminal student
in human biology and food research,
laughs when told that The Daily
wants to do a story on the academic
awards that he and Scott have
received. "Kevin Scott's my
spokesman," he replies. "He'll an
swer all your questions."
Scott, an electrical engineering
major in his fourth year at Stanford,

notes with a straight face that
Soderlund has taught him every
thing he knows.
Then they begin discussing
academics.
"I get by during the season and
then make a big push at the end of
the quarter, after Thanksgiving,"
Soderlund says.
"If you budget your time, you can
do it," Scott says of his academic
achievement.
Both players, along with last
year's senior guard Scott Carpenter
and senior wide receiver Emile
Harry, received Pacific 10 Confer
ence All-Academic Team honors as
well as Academic All-America
status. The distinctions are
reserved for athletes who have per
formed exceptionally well both on
the field and in the classroom.
"Hard work pays off," says
Soderlund of the honors. "It's nice
to get a little recognition... a little
cake."
Soderlund discusses the difficulty
of getting work done during the
football season. He estimates that
practices and game time amount to
about 30 hours per week during the
season, but adds, "It's not really
the hours you put in, it's the en
ergy."

That is not to say the hours don't
make a dent in Soderlund's
schedule.
Players show up at 1 p.m. for
practice Monday through Thursday,
work out from about 2 to 5 p.m.,
and leave the training table at 7
p.m., tired and sore.
On Friday, the team travels
(when Stanford is playing away),
and Saturday game day is not
traditionally a big study day for the
squad.
That leaves one day of rest for
the players, but Scott mentions that
the obligatory Sunday night team
meeting not only keeps them away
from their books, but ensures that
they miss every ASSU Sunday
Flick.
Soderlund notes, though, that he
does just as well in school, or bet
ter, fall quarter as he does winter
and spring. Scott agrees.
They discuss the discipline they
have learned from sports, saying
that it transfers into their study
habits.
And they talk about the things
they have to give up to play football
and take a full course load.
"Seeing some of your friends just
doesn't happen," he says. "I'll say
'Hi' to them maybe twice the whole
season."
Scott mentions a guitar gathering

dust in his room. He'd love to have
the time to play it, but that will wait
until the season ends.
Soderlund, asked whether he
made a mistake in coming to a
school that emphasizes academics
over intercollegiate sports, turns
the question around.
"There's no less emphasis on
athletics here than anywhere else,"
he says. "The time commitment is
the same here as everywhere."

Scott says Stanford gives the in
dividual "more opportunity to do
what he wants, to forgo winter con
ditioning if he wants to study."
It would seem that the more in
dividualized approach to training
could pose a problem for an athlete
who is not particularly self
motivated. But somehow that
doesn't seem to be a worry for
Scott and Soderlund.

Cardinal halfback and engineering major Kevin Scott has no
doubt figured out the proper vectors to elude this would-be tackier.
Scott and linebacker Matt Soderlund were both selected as
second-team Academic All-Americans last year.
