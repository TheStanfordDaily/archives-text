# Banged-Up Card Takes on 5-1 Wildcats
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Editorial staff 
At the beginning of the season,
the Stanford Cardinal believed it
had the makings of "The Right
Stuff." In fact, a poster attempted
to show it. Six players standing tall,
resolute and mean.
Six games later though, only two
are left standing, with a third barely
in the picture, slightly round
shouldered. The once-proud
proclamation has been relegated to
something to the likes of "correct
change needed."
In short, injuries have plagued
the Cardinal all year, and today's
game is no exception. The most
notable absentee is quarterback
John Paye, who separated his
shoulder last week against USC.
His absence, however, does not
change Arizona's pre-game defen
sive strategies. "I don't think it
makes a whole lot of difference,"
said Wildcat Coach Larry Smith.
"They have a base running attack
and a base passing attack that we'll
have to prepare for."
Of late, though, the more apt
word for the Cardinal offense is
basic basically bad. The problems
stem from the offensive line play.
Quarterback sacks, once an
anomaly, have become routine for
opposing defensive units.
"Because of injuries, we haven't
had the same group of five all
season," said offensive guard Tom
Nye, who will start in today's game
after missing the last four games
due to an injury.
'We've had breakdowns both
mentally and physically," continued
Nye. 'We have to be more aggres
sive. You can say it's inexperience,
but this is the sixth week. ..."
In today's game, the offensive
line will have a new signal-caller to
block for fifth-year senior Fred
Buckley, who puts the problems in
the trenches into light perspective.
"Everyone's saying that they're
young some sort of sieve. I feel
comfortable back there. I'd rather
have them in front of me than me in
front of them," Buckley said.
Most compassionate and sane
human beings would agree, espe
cially considering the tenacity of the
Wildcat defense.
In the six games thus far,
Arizona has given up a total of four
teen points in the second and third
quarters combined. When they are
lax, which statistically has been in
the first quarter, they've given up a
grand total of twenty-six points.
All told, the Wildcat defense has
allowed a total of 54 points for an
average of nine per game, good
enough for third in the nation.
"They are the best team
defensively that we've faced," Nye

said. "They don't rely on any indi
viduals. For us to be successful, I
think it's important that we knock
â€¢ the shit out of some people on the
first series."
Wildcat linebacker Byron Evans
probably won't be in that group.
Smith has compared him with
former Arizona AU-Pac-10 lineback
ers Rickey and Lamonte Hunley.
Thus far, Evans has accounted for
66 solo tackles and has recorded
three interceptions.
Fortunately, Evans won't be on
the field all the time. Arizona has a
offense as well, and a good one at
that.
With quarterback Alfred Jenkins
at the helm, the Cardinal defense
will have to be aware of his all
around athletic ability
"Alfred Jenkins is the type of
player who can run as well as pass,"
Stanford Coach Jack Elway said. "It
will be up to us to contain him from
getting free. We must be able to
rush him consistently."
Freshman noseguard Ray Hucke
stein offered similar sentiments,
'We definitely have to have a pass
rush to control him Qenkins). We
also have to look out for that little
guy. What's his name?"
Huckestein is referring to Wildcat
halfback David Adams, who like
Oregon's Tony Cherry, possesses
great quickness. Adams leads the
team in rushing with 456 yards.
If Jenkins doesn't run or hand off
to Adams, look for him to throw to
wideout Jon Horton, a 4.37
speedster in the 40-yard dash. Hor
ton has been on the receiving end
31 times this season, and when he
catches it, he may never stop. His
average of 16.3 yards per catch
leads the team.
"They have a lot of team speed,"
Huckestein said. "But we're improv
ing. We're wrapping and gang tack
ling a lot better. We're tired of
losing games with everyone
blaming the defensive side."
'We have given up a lot of big
plays, but that's football," said
strong safety Sam Sutherland. We've
been trying to make the big play
ourselves the interception or the
tackle for a loss."
"I'd like to take Arizona out of
the Rose Bowl race and put some
one else in," he added.
Should the contest come down to
the kicking game, Arizona, with
Max Zendejas, will stand many feet
tall.
Following in the hallowed
footsteps of his older brother Luis,
who played for Arizona State, the
younger Zendejas stands to break
his brother's all-time NCAA scoring
record.
This season Zendejas has con
verted on all 14 extra point at
tempts and has successfully booted
14 out of 19 field goals.

Instead of holding their helmets in the quintessential picture pose, most of these players in Stanford's
promotional poster should have opted for icepacks. In today's game, only Toi Cook (44)
and Matt Soderlund (47) are sure starters. Brad Muster (25) may see limited action.
