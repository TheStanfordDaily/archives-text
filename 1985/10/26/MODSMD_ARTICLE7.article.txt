Jon Horton

Arizona Special Teams

Evans had 11 tackles last week
against San Jose State, a poor game
for him. For the season, he is
averaging 16 tackles per game,
second in the Pac-10. His 66 solo
stops lead the conference. The
Arizona coaches put him in the
same class as former Wildcat stars
Ricky and Lamonte Hunley. Morris
has filled in admirably for Brad
Muster, catching 27 passes and
rushing for 91 yards.

Buckley threw 17 interceptions
in 166 pass attempts last season,
and Durden led the Pac-10 with six
thefts, including one from Buckley.
Durden runs a 4.5-second 40-yard
dash and, though he weighs only
171 pounds, can bench press 295
pounds. This combination of speed
and strength won him All Pac-10
honors in 1984.

Horton is matched against the
entire Cardinal secondary because
it will take a group effort to contain
him. Horton is a burner (4.37 in the
40), and no one man is going to
cover him. In 1984, Horton
averaged 19.6 yards on 45 catches
and scored six touchdowns. This
season, he has 31 receptions and
three touchdowns. In short, this is
a tough one for Stanford.

Last year against Arizona,
Robison was tackled three times
before he could get the ball away.
The Wildcats obviously remember
that and will be coming after him
today, especially because UCLA
blocked a Stanford punt two weeks
ago. Robison has been having a
quietly solid season, averaging 43
yards per kick. Keeping things
quiet today will be a key for Stan
ford.
