# UA's Adams: Small Body, Big Results
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff sportswriter 
At one time or another, we've all spotted a
squirrel or two frolicking around the trees
and shrubbery of the Farm. You know, those
cute little campus critters who gather nuts
without a worry in the world.
Ever try catching one? Try it one day.
Aside from looking downright foolish, you'll
fail miserably. The swift rodent will scamper
in and around bushes and end up in a tree
before you'll have time to budge.
When Dave Adams, junior tailback from the
University of Arizona, runs in and around op
posing defenses, this image of mature adults
plodding after fleet squirrels immediately
comes to mind. Not that he's a squirrel, but
he is 5-6. In fact, standing next to defensive
linemen, the man is tiny. But he's squirrel
quick, so he often makes those linemen who
try to catch him look foolish.
"It was like he was running around us,"
Southern Methodist noseguard Jerry Ball told
Sports Illustrated after Adams scampered in
and around the Mustangs' defense for 136
yards in the Wildcats' 28-6 surprise win two
weeks ago. "He would hit up and cut way
back. Most of the time he was running as if he
was in reverse."
In relative obscurity during his first two
seasons due to injuries, Adams has emerged
as the Wildcats' leading rusher. Last year he
led the Wildcats in rushing, amassing 750
yards on 188 carries. After six games this
season, he again leads Arizona rushers with
438 yards at a clip of 4.2 yards a carry.
The novelty of his size hasn't escaped the
notice of fans or the media, but Adams

believes that this new-found attention hasn't
changed his mental approach toward his
sport.
"That kind of attention doesn't affect me,"
he said. "I'm out there to do a job to the best
of my ability. They (the media) like to dwell
on my size because it's unusual."
It is unusual, because not many his size
have been able to excel at this level of compe
tition, but Adams feels it doesn't have to be
that way. All it takes is the proper outlook.
"Sure, I could give in to society's expecta
tions and become a garbage collector or
something, but I won't. You've got to believe
you can do it and work hard to make sure you
do. It's an attitude."
Granted, the right mental attitude is the
main prerequisite for success, but even
Adams admits that this physical incongruity
carries advantages as well as disadvantages.
"Sometimes when I don't have good posi
tion on a block, I'll get pushed back into the
runner," Adams said. "But when it comes to
blocking, it's usually the lowest person who
wins the battles." He confidently added, "I
can get lower than most people."
He means huge linemen who are usually a
foot and 100-odd pounds his superior, and
who really don't see him as just another cute
squirrel. Not only are they out to make a
tackle, many are out to prove a point.
"Some are out there to prove that I can't
play, so I have to be that much more aggres
sive to prove I do belong out there. I have to
do whatever it takes to gain yardage; that's
the way the game should be played. I'm not in
there to hook-slide or run out of bounds."
Opposing defenses wish he would.
Stanford linebacker Matt Soderlund, 6 foot,

3 inches tall, explained why Adams troubles
defenses.
"He's incredibly quick. He's a scrittery
back who's tough to hold onto. On the films
we've seen of him, he appears very durable."
His durability extends beyond his running
chores; he's Arizona's fourth leading pass

catcher, and he also works on the special
teams unit as the main punt returner.
A recent injury to the big toe on his right
foot may slow him down today, but don't
count on it. Dave Adams may be small in stat
ure, but his character is as big as a giant. And
that's what matters most.

Pint-sized Wildcat halfback David Adams finds a small gap in the interior line. At
5-6, 160 lbs, Adams doesn't need much to send him scampering downfield. His
456 yards rushing leads the team.
