# COP Proposal Could Disband Student Senate
## 
### KELLY SUND Staff writer 
Elected last spring with a campaign promise to dis
band the ASSU Senate, the Council of Presidents ap
peared to have dropped the idea. However, COP
members Andy Frisch, Tim Quirk and Mike Collins
revealed recently that the COP is currently drafting a
new constitution that does eliminate the senate.
The student government proposed by the constitu
tion would replace the senate with a smaller group
possessing "distinct responsibilities," according to Col
lins, who stated that the current senate has "too many
pfeople, too little representation," as well as a
"diaphanous sense of what it should be doing."
When the COP took office, explained Quirk, it
found that a number of bills to reform the senate had
been proposed. As a result, the COP chose to wait and
see if the reforms would work. When no progress
seemed evident, Quirk, Frisch and Collins decided to
create a new constitution. The fourth COP member,
Leslie Leland, prefers to take no part in constitution
writing, according to Collins.
The other three COP members first attempted to
revise the current constitution, said Quirk, adding that
the result was "a really strange amalgam of stuff."
Collins, who titled himself the coordinator of the
constitution-writing effort, said that another constitu
tion has been constructed since then, but that this ver
sion was also too long and "did not effect enough radi
cal change."
Collins said that sometime this week, the three
would get together and begin to write a constitution
limited to five pages in length.
Since the final version of the new constitution has
not yet been written, neither Collins, Frisch nor Quirk
could give specific details as to what it will contain. All
three seemed to agree that the duties prescribed to
the legislative body must be more specific and detailed
than is the case now. Frisch, particularly, called for
"more directed, limited power."
Frisch and Quirk stressed one goal of the new con
stitution: making the ASSU and its resources more
available to students.
"Senators now see themselves as protectors of re
sources. Students coming to them have to prove their
worth," said Quirk, adding that the situation should be
turned around to where the ASSU would be the
"humble servant of the students."
Quirk and Collins both mentioned that the current
form of the senate, despite its large size, provides little
representation for the students. Quirk attributed this
to the current voting method in which students vote for
10 senatorial candidates. Quirk said he believes few
people actually know 10 candidates, so the result is a
vote for 10 people selected at random.
For this reason, Quirk said he would like to curtail to
one or two the number of representatives for which an
individual could vote. Both Quirk and Collins said they
would also like to decrease the size of the legislative
body, so that each member would have more accoun
tability for his actions.
The new constitution might be finished by the end of
this quarter, according to Collins. Two possible ways
would then exist for it to be brought to a vote by the
students.
The first is to have it introduced by the senate. Col
lins said he doubts that the senate would bring up a
measure calculated to ensure its destruction. The al
ternative is to circulate the constitution to the stu
dents, along with petitions requesting that it be placed
on a ballot. If enough signatures appear on the peti
tions, a referendum ballot would be put out for the stu
dents to vote on the new constitution.
Collins said he believes that the latter is the course
that will eventually be taken and that the ballot may ap
pear winter quarter.
