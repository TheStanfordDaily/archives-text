### LAIE CAINDEC 
In an effort to ensure that posted
advertisements will no longer clut
ter the University, Student Organi
zation Services (SOS) has drafted a
stricter policy regarding the place
ment of fliers around campus.
In the new policy, Facilities and
Services will remove all outdated
fliers, in addition to fliers posted on
unauthorized surfaces such as
buildings, trees, windows, doors
and trash cans, according to Mi
chael Ramsey-Perez, the coordina
tor of SOS. Organizations will be
billed for the removal of their fliers
and posters, he said.
Areas designated for posting
fliers that advertise campus activi- x
ties will be more stringently reg
ulated under the revised publicity

guidelines, according to Ramsey-
Perez.
"What we're really trying to do is
change bad habits," he said, "If it
doesn't work now, we will persist."
According to Ramsey-Perez,
"White Plaza is our free speech area
for the University. Because it is at
the center of the University, it is
also a place where we want student
organizations to advertise their up
coming activities."
Ramsey-Perez said that he sees
the revised policy as a "step toward
civility."
"We (SOS) are simply trying to
protect our physical environment
so that it more accurately reflects
the respect of our community," he
said.
Copies of the guidelines are to be
distributed early this week,
Ramsey-Perez said.
