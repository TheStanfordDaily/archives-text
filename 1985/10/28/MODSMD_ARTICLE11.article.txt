## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Save Daylight Hours 
### 
Daylight Savings Time has become an American
institution— a way of life. An extra hour of daylight
is preserved during the summer months which con
serves energy, makes rush-hour traffic safer and
provides greater leisure opportunity during the
waking hours.
To reduce confusion, the one-hour adjustment is
made at 2 a.m. on a Sunday morning as most people
sleep through it. The procedure is jterrific in the fall
when the clock is turned back and the entire nation
gets an extra hour of sleep. Arriving an hour early is
the only penalty for not remembering.
But what about the spring? Most people consider
it consistent and efficient to repeat the entire
process in reverse. Is this really the best method?
Must 200 million people be denied an hour of sleep
for the system to work? If we are going to disrupt
lives, must we also cause honest citizens to miss
church, forfeit baseball games and show up late for
brunch?
The Daily feels we can do better. When moving
the clock ahead one hour in the spring, Congress
should choose an appropriate Friday afternoon in

April. It could be designated "Fun Friday." At 3
p.m. on "Fun Friday," all clocks would be turned
forward to 4 p.m. and everyone would go home an
hour early. The government would be compensating
rather than punishing citizens for the disruption and
inconvenience it imposes. It would add variety to an
otherwise dull month.
Advertising the event would be easy as mer
chants seize the chance to promote "Fun Friday"
happy hour specials. They could replace the Ladies'
Nights that the Daily agreed to ban last week.
Stores would offer "Fun Friday" sales. They could
stay open an hour later because people would not
get tired until an hour later.
People would no longer have to remember
"spring ahead and fall behind." "Fun Friday" would
occur only once a year. As life in America intensifies
and we continually approach our existence with in
creased seriousness and efficiency, isn't a "Fun
Friday" what we really need? As the idea spreads
and politicians add this common sense proposal to
their platforms, kindly remember: The Daily
thought of it first.
