## On the Roots and Causes of Cheating at Stanford 
### 
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo's long
essay in The Daily (Oct. 2) is an eloquent yet
unsatisfactory attempt to put the recent inci
dent of cheating in his class in perspective.
As in many ostensible efforts at self-criticism
and confession, what he fails to say is more
important than what he does say.
First, let me give him some credit where
credit is due. The cheating in his class was
indeed inexcusable. It was morally wrong, as
he recognizes — of course — and deserves
to be properly punished.

VIEWPOINT

Cheating on this scale is rather unusual, as
he also recognizes; but in the last decade I
have been aware of cheating in rather small
classes such as Freshman English, computer
science classes and even in my own course,
Structured Liberal Education (SLE). Teach
ers who think they are immune to cheating on
principle or because their classes are so
meaningful, or so wonderfully designed, are
naive.
Zimbardo suggests two factors in his par
ticular case that he believes "increased the
probability" of cheating: the size of his class
and the testing-grading system he used.
Twice he admits that his class was too large
and promises to change that along with the
testing procedure. But when he says, "my
class was much too big" and "my class was
one of Stanford's largest," he is so oblique
that the reader is left wondering just how his
class got that large in the first place.
Was he all that surprised at the size of the
class? Isn't Psychology 1 offered each quar
ter, every year, unlike some of the other
large lecture classes like Political Science 35,
Human Sexuality or Criminal Law, which are
only offered once a year? Why was he so
deluged? Was this the first time this has hap
pened? In fact, didn't he choose to let his
class become so large, and isn't he respon
sible for the consequences of this choice?

Why did he think 744 students needed to take
his course?
He does use the language of moral choice
once: "I chose to teach it in Kresge. ..."
But in this statement, he is trying to absolve
himself of the charge of encouraging
anonymity and impersonality. He says that he
wanted to make the class more personal and
intimate and not teach in a large "arena,"
presumably Dinkelspiel. Can he be serious?
Is it intimate and personal to suggest to the
students who want to take the course pass/no
credit that they do not even have to attend
class because their entire exam will be based
on his textbook? Does this encourage
"honorable academic work" as the Honor
Code demands?
At a university of Stanford's stature, what
is the justification for using multiple-choice
tests? Here too, to be fair, he has acknowl
edged a problem, and he promises reform in
the future. But I ask: What choices did he
make, what values did he have about educa
tion and the improvement of the student's
mind that prompted him to design such a sys
tem in the first place? Frankly, I would be
ashamed to use a multiple-choice test at all in
a class of mine, and I am embarrassed to be
associated with a university, not only where
cheating occurs, but where the use of such
tests has been condoned for so long. How can
these tests conceivably be justified at this
level of education?
One could say of Zimbardo what was said
of the French aristocrats who survived the
French Revolution and attempted to restore
the ancien regime to its erstwhile glory. Like
them, he seems "to have forgotten nothing
and learned nothing." In this case, the exam
ple is his "infamous" (his own word) prison
experiment of 1971. The most he can say is
that it is "ironic" that this cheating scandal
should have happened to him when he is such
an authority on "de-individuation and its anti
social consequences."
He fails to see that both his experiment and

his course are products of the same assump
tions, namely that it is justifiable to manipu
late others on behalf of a worthy end. He fails
to understand that a course is not a perfor
mance or an experiment in social manipula
tion, that a classroom is not an arena and that
a professor is not an actor or a gladiator.
What ultimately determines the likelihood
of cheating in a class is not the size alone, or
the size plus the testing mechanism. Behind
these factors lies the less easily quantified
issue of the intellectual legitimacy of the
course and whether the students think they
are being intellectually challenged or simply
entertained.

One could say of Zim
bardo what was said of
the French aristocrats
who survived the French
Revolution and at
tempted to restore the
ancien regime to its
erstwhile glory.

I have spoken with many students who
enjoyed the class immensely. They thought
the mass hypnosis demonstration was partic
ularly neat. They would argue that you had to
know the textbook very well in order to do
well on the tests. In this sense, the class was
no longer an easy one, as its reputation prior
to this year would have it. These students
would never dream of cheating, but who
among them would consider Zimbardo's

course demanding intellectually?
Zimbardo raises the rosy romantic idea of a
community of scholars where students study
simply for the sake of learning. I happen to
admire this ideal, and I believe it is one
toward which we ought to strive in our teach
ing — knowing that we will always fall short.
He is justifiably angry at what happened in his
class, but he reacts like a disenchanted
Utopian who has lost his faith in human nature
when the world inevitably disappoints him.
He blames the cheating in his class on "the in
sidious pressures upon students due to the
undue emphasis put upon course grades . . .
and our unrelenting quarter system . . . and
the perception of survival-at-all-costs-at-
Stanford."
This sounds like some undergraduate
tirade out of the '60s. Where has Zimbardo
been? Until this past year, his own class was
a classic case of just the opposite, because it
was a guaranteed "A" if you were willing to
retake the tests enough times. There are, to
be sure, isolated pockets of extreme grade
consciousness in parts of the undergraduate
curriculum, but if one hears any criticism of
the grading system from students and faculty
alike, it is that grading is too easy here, that
you don't have to work that hard to get good
grades, and not that Stanford is a neo-
Darwinian jungle.
Finally, I agree with Zimbardo that we
should all do what we can as members of the
community to restore the dignity of the
Honor Code and to deter violations of it. I
would suggest that in reforming his course to
this end that he address not only the superfi
cial causes (such as class size and testing pro
cedures), but also re-evaluate his basic as
sumptions about why he has been teaching
this way and what the moral effects of his
teaching are on students.

ple is his "infamous" (his own word) prison
experiment of 1971. The most he can say is
that it is "ironic" that this cheating scandal
should have happened to him when he is such
an authority on "de-individuation and its anti
social consequences."
He fails to see that both his experiment and

his course are products of the same assump
tions, namely that it is justifiable to manipu
late others on behalf of a worthy end. He fails
to understand that a course is not a perfor
mance or an experiment in social manipula
tion, that a classroom is not an arena and that
a professor is not an actor or a gladiator.
What ultimately determines the likelihood
of cheating in a class is not the size alone, or
the size plus the testing mechanism. Behind
these factors lies the less easily quantified
issue of the intellectual legitimacy of the
course and whether the students think they
are being intellectually challenged or simply
entertained.

One could say of Zim
bardo what was said of
the French aristocrats
who survived the French
Revolution and at
tempted to restore the
ancien regime to its
erstwhile glory.

I have spoken with many students who
enjoyed the class immensely. They thought
the mass hypnosis demonstration was partic
ularly neat. They would argue that you had to
know the textbook very well in order to do
well on the tests. In this sense, the class was
no longer an easy one, as its reputation prior
to this year would have it. These students
would never dream of cheating, but who
among them would consider Zimbardo's

course demanding intellectually?
Zimbardo raises the rosy romantic idea of a
community of scholars where students study
simply for the sake of learning. I happen to
admire this ideal, and I believe it is one
toward which we ought to strive in our teach
ing — knowing that we will always fall short.
He is justifiably angry at what happened in his
class, but he reacts like a disenchanted
Utopian who has lost his faith in human nature
when the world inevitably disappoints him.
He blames the cheating in his class on "the in
sidious pressures upon students due to the
undue emphasis put upon course grades . . .
and our unrelenting quarter system . . . and
the perception of survival-at-all-costs-at-
Stanford."
This sounds like some undergraduate
tirade out of the '60s. Where has Zimbardo
been? Until this past year, his own class was
a classic case of just the opposite, because it
was a guaranteed "A" if you were willing to
retake the tests enough times. There are, to
be sure, isolated pockets of extreme grade
consciousness in parts of the undergraduate
curriculum, but if one hears any criticism of
the grading system from students and faculty
alike, it is that grading is too easy here, that
you don't have to work that hard to get good
grades, and not that Stanford is a neo-
Darwinian jungle.
Finally, I agree with Zimbardo that we
should all do what we can as members of the
community to restore the dignity of the
Honor Code and to deter violations of it. I
would suggest that in reforming his course to
this end that he address not only the superfi
cial causes (such as class size and testing pro
cedures), but also re-evaluate his basic as
sumptions about why he has been teaching
this way and what the moral effects of his
teaching are on students.

Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo's long
essay in The Daily (Oct. 2) is an eloquent yet
unsatisfactory attempt to put the recent inci
dent of cheating in his class in perspective.
As in many ostensible efforts at self-criticism
and confession, what he fails to say is more
important than what he does say.
First, let me give him some credit where
credit is due. The cheating in his class was
indeed inexcusable. It was morally wrong, as
he recognizes — of course — and deserves
to be properly punished.

VIEWPOINT

Cheating on this scale is rather unusual, as
he also recognizes; but in the last decade I
have been aware of cheating in rather small
classes such as Freshman English, computer
science classes and even in my own course,
Structured Liberal Education (SLE). Teach
ers who think they are immune to cheating on
principle or because their classes are so
meaningful, or so wonderfully designed, are
naive.
Zimbardo suggests two factors in his par
ticular case that he believes "increased the
probability" of cheating: the size of his class
and the testing-grading system he used.
Twice he admits that his class was too large
and promises to change that along with the
testing procedure. But when he says, "my
class was much too big" and "my class was
one of Stanford's largest," he is so oblique
that the reader is left wondering just how his
class got that large in the first place.
Was he all that surprised at the size of the
class? Isn't Psychology 1 offered each quar
ter, every year, unlike some of the other
large lecture classes like Political Science 35,
Human Sexuality or Criminal Law, which are
only offered once a year? Why was he so
deluged? Was this the first time this has hap
pened? In fact, didn't he choose to let his
class become so large, and isn't he respon
sible for the consequences of this choice?

Why did he think 744 students needed to take
his course?
He does use the language of moral choice
once: "I chose to teach it in Kresge. ..."
But in this statement, he is trying to absolve
himself of the charge of encouraging
anonymity and impersonality. He says that he
wanted to make the class more personal and
intimate and not teach in a large "arena,"
presumably Dinkelspiel. Can he be serious?
Is it intimate and personal to suggest to the
students who want to take the course pass/no
credit that they do not even have to attend
class because their entire exam will be based
on his textbook? Does this encourage
"honorable academic work" as the Honor
Code demands?
At a university of Stanford's stature, what
is the justification for using multiple-choice
tests? Here too, to be fair, he has acknowl
edged a problem, and he promises reform in
the future. But I ask: What choices did he
make, what values did he have about educa
tion and the improvement of the student's
mind that prompted him to design such a sys
tem in the first place? Frankly, I would be
ashamed to use a multiple-choice test at all in
a class of mine, and I am embarrassed to be
associated with a university, not only where
cheating occurs, but where the use of such
tests has been condoned for so long. How can
these tests conceivably be justified at this
level of education?
