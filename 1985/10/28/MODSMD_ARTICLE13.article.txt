# Protest in Support of the Union
## 
### 
Where are the protests by Stanford students
on behalf of the United Stanford Workers? We
should be protesting the administration's hard
line negotiating policy. We should be showing
support for University workers, who are trying
to hold on to their basic rights as laborers. But
the students on this "issue conscious" campus
don't seem to be saying much about the dispute
between the University and the USW, other than
that they hope a strike doesn't happen — for it
would be a real hassle not to have food service in
the dorms.
We have apartheid protests, forums and rallies
continually on campus. But student actions for
the USW are hardly visible. Both issues involve
the securing and/or holding of basic rights; and
both issues involve the same stance of the Uni
versity — maximizing of profits at all costs, in
cluding total disregard for basic human rights.
For example, the University wants the right
to lay off USW laborers and replace them with
non-union employees, which would eliminate job
security. The administration also wants to
prohibit union representatives from discussing
problems with employees during work time. If
the USW were to consent to this demand, it
would eliminate union representation from the
workplace, a right granted under federal law;
Thus I state that the University has no regard
for worker rights, which are basic human rights.
If anything, protests for the USW should be as
large or larger than apartheid protests. South
Africa is half a world away, and even if Stanford
did divest it would have limited effect on the
problem. But in the USW-University dispute, we
could make a substantial difference in combating

an attitude held by the administration which we
feel is wrong. Some students say that they are
against apartheid but the problem has to be
solved in South Africa and not here. And so they
do not protest. But the USW issue is happening
right here. That argument for not protesting
does not work now. So why isn't this campus in
outrage over the administration's hardline
negotiating policy which in no way could be
viewed as "bargaining in good faith?"

The only thing that I can say for the adminis
tration is that, regardless of right or wrong, its
policies are consistent. The institution of Stan
ford is the pinnacle of capitalistic philosophy, a
paragon of the bourgeois class; and its policies
and actions follow through on this fact. From
charging $10,000 for tuition, to investing in
South African corporations, to trying to pay labor
less than its worth (pre-union wage for Stanford
workers kept many below the poverty level), to
charging students $25 if they left their beds in
bunk form at the end of the year — Stanford Uni

versity doesn't miss a trick. If Karl Marx were
alive today his example of a perfectly exploitive
ruling class insititution would be Stanford.
We students are here at Stanford to learn, and
judging by the lack of concern for human rights
by vast numbers of students, most of us are
"learning" well. True, students do protest apart
heid. But I can't help but feel that the protests
are organized by a small minority of mostly black
students, concerned because racism has directly
affected them.
It's a sad thought, but I feel that if it were put
to a vote whether there should be campus-wide
apartheid protesting, Stanford students would
vote overwhelmingly not to bother. And in the
case of the USW-administration issue, we don't
bother. And since we don't bother, does that
mean we think it's fine to exploit labor for our
own profit? Have many of our parents played the
roles that University President Donald Kennedy
and chief negotiator Priscilla Wheeler play in
this dispute, and did they follow the same basic
policy? I must say that I do not know exact sta
tistics on Stanford parents, but I am positive that
a large percentage of them work in management.
Are we then, by virtue of our home life and the
college we attend, mostly greedy capitalists who
care nothing for human rights? We should prove
to ourselves and the United Stanford Workers
that we aren't.
To do and say nothing is to give the adminis
tration our own tacit approval of its policies.
So let's voice our support for the USW and help
achieve a fair and just settlement.

paragon of the bourgeois class; and its policies
and actions follow through on this fact. From
charging $10,000 for tuition, to investing in
South African corporations, to trying to pay labor
less than its worth (pre-union wage for Stanford
workers kept many below the poverty level), to
charging students $25 if they left their beds in
bunk form at the end of the year — Stanford Uni

versity doesn't miss a trick. If Karl Marx were
alive today his example of a perfectly exploitive
ruling class insititution would be Stanford.
We students are here at Stanford to learn, and
judging by the lack of concern for human rights
by vast numbers of students, most of us are
"learning" well. True, students do protest apart
heid. But I can't help but feel that the protests
are organized by a small minority of mostly black
students, concerned because racism has directly
affected them.
It's a sad thought, but I feel that if it were put
to a vote whether there should be campus-wide
apartheid protesting, Stanford students would
vote overwhelmingly not to bother. And in the
case of the USW-administration issue, we don't
bother. And since we don't bother, does that
mean we think it's fine to exploit labor for our
own profit? Have many of our parents played the
roles that University President Donald Kennedy
and chief negotiator Priscilla Wheeler play in
this dispute, and did they follow the same basic
policy? I must say that I do not know exact sta
tistics on Stanford parents, but I am positive that
a large percentage of them work in management.
Are we then, by virtue of our home life and the
college we attend, mostly greedy capitalists who
care nothing for human rights? We should prove
to ourselves and the United Stanford Workers
that we aren't.
To do and say nothing is to give the adminis
tration our own tacit approval of its policies.
So let's voice our support for the USW and help
achieve a fair and just settlement.
