Perkins et al. Lie
To Get Sympathy
I would be very surprised if it
were shown that campus police
used excessive force in making
sit-in arrests. These are profes
sionals, trained to suffer discom
fort and risk injury rather than
permit the appearance of brutality
on their part. The experience of
some of these people goes back to
the riots of 15 years ago.
Perkins et al. set out to create
publicity. Their goal is to be seen
as victims and to raise the sympa
thy due to martyrs. This might be
accomplished only by mis
representing the actions of others.
It might be appropriate for the
Student Judicial Affairs Committee
to inquire into the culpability of
those who lie with intent to harm
other members of the University
community.

Reward Offered
For Ball's Return
As the moderator at Tuesday
night's lecture by Hunter S.
Thompson, I feel personally re
sponsible for the loss of his foot
ball, and would like to offer a $50
reward, no questions asked, for
information leading to the return of
the ball. Hunter is a sports fanatic.
That ball meant a lot to him and,
again, I think we owe it to him
after his excellent performance.
