## The 						Scoop on Schools' Future Issues 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
These are turbulent times for higher edu
cation in the United States.
Universities are under assault from all
sides: from students, who are protesting for
more socially responsible investment
policies; from professors, who are demand
ing higher salaries; from legislators, who
are debating deep cuts in education spend
ing; from the secretary of education, who is

Education Watch

going public with complaints that higher
education isn't what it could be.
The list goes on and on.
But in our constant focus on student life

at Stanford, we often miss this bigger
picture; we seldom see the forces that will
have a huge impact on higher learning in the
next few years.
Beginning today in The Daily, Education
Watch is an effort to do something about all
that.
In each article, we'll look at some of the
forces that are shaping higher education in
this country. And we'll look at the ways in
which colleges and universities are respond
ing to the changes those forces are causing.
Here are a few of the issues we'll look at
• Budget Cuts: In the intensified effort to
cut the federal budget deficit, Congress is
considering serious cuts in education fund
ing. If the most severe of the deficit
trimming plans is passed, experts say entire
educational programs could be eliminated,
research aid could be cut to the bone, and

banks could stop granting student loans out
of fear that the government will not guaran
tee them.
• Defense Research: According to Sci
ence magazine, the Soviet Union has tar
geted 60 U.S. college campuses at which it
could gain valuable defense-research infor
mation through the use of spies. The
revelation comes at a time when university
administrators are protesting proposed
Reagan Administration restrictions on
releasing research information, and re
searchers at some Midwestern schools have
signed petitions stating they will not con
duct "Star Wars" weapons research.
• Athletics: In the midst of accusations that
several colleges and universities are either
paying athletes or letting them slide through
classes, Northeastern University is taking
what many call a positive step. The school

has instituted a program in which pro ath
letes may return to the classroom to get the
educations they may have missed while in
college.
• South Africa: University administra
tors, wary of total U.S. divestment as a so
lution for South Africa's troubles, are
looking at other ways to improve the plight
of blacks there. The president of Tufts Uni
versity has suggested that U.S. universities
offer scholarships to South African blacks in
order to ensure that they receive superior
educations that would enable them to work
for reform in their troubled nation.
