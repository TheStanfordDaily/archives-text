## Love and Haight, or Hashbury Rehashed 
### LISA LYNCH Editorial staff 
"The Haight-Ashbury"
By Charles Perry
Vintage, 306 pp., $4.95
If you thought that perhaps the
'60s boom had gone bear market,
never fear. The past isn't going to
go anywhere. Charles Perry's "The
Haight-Ashbury: A History."
proves that out of a finite series of
events an infinite number of
"contemporary histories" can be
written. Unfortunately, the book is
also an example of the problems in
herent in writing a contemporary
history.
What is "contemporary history?"
I'd call it anything that documents
something that people kind of re
member, or think they do, and are
eager to find out more about. "The
Haight-Ashbury" will in fact tell the
uninformed a lot about what hap
pened in San Francisco in 1966 and
1977, and has pleasant surprises for
both the jaded and the '60s throw
back. But sometimes Perry's infor
mation gets bogged down by his

writing style.
Admittedly, this type of book
isn't very easy to write. Accounts
of events that have just happened
always seem a little sensationalis
tic, a little exploitative — unless the
writer overcompensates by making
the work dry and "factual." There's
also a problem of perspective;
when writing about events that hap
pened 200 years ago, one has 200
years of scholarship with which to
agree or disagree. The contempo
rary historian has only a handful of
just-written essays and his own
debatable opinions.
Because he has only shaky
footing to stand on, Perry's per
spective is unclear. I can't tell
whether he's attempting to chain
himself to a pillar of absolute impar
tiality, whether he is writing from
the viewpoint of someone who ac
tually experienced the "Summer of
Love" and is looking back a bit cyni
cally, or whether he's trying to get
the reader to experience the events
as they happened, without drawing
any conclusion until the end.
Perry's "history" is part episodic
chronology, part interpretive es
say. There are times when the

events of the Summer of Love beg
interpretation, and times when
Perry is able to support interesting
ideas with new information. But the
text, in which dated "entries" are
cross-cut haphazardly with ex
plicative passages, has a strange
texture. The dates before journal
entries give the events an air of
melodrama that doesn't match
Perry's matter-of-fact prose.
The text is drawn from an ad
mirably wide variety of sources,
and paints a good general picture of
what went on in the Haight. Before
describing the actual neighbor
hood, Perry sums up social, politi
cal and cultural events just before
1966, concentrating on the music
scene and the development of the
fledgling hippie ethic. He then goes
on to document the Haight's trans
formation from a relatively sane
student neighborhood whose resi
dents wore Edwardian clothes to
match the Victorian house they
lived in, to the home of be-ins, Dig
ger feeds and tie-dye rainbows in
the park.
Perry pays a great deal of atten
tion to the music scene in the
Haight — I gathered that he felt

that the rock scene (and country
western scene) was the cement
that held the Haight together, and
was at least as important as drug
culture.
One of the things that differenti
ates this history of the Haight from
others that I've read is Perry's hos
tility toward LSD. It's hard for him
to remain impartial toward the
Haight's residents and ringleaders
when he suggests that LSD was
tried by people who were "crazy
enough to take it." Actually, most
of the things I've read about the
Haight and the hippie ethic have
overglorified acid culture, so
Perry's familiar-but-disapproving
approach was refreshing.
Other things new to me: Perry
gives a good background on the
reciprocal relationship between the
Hell's Angels and the Haight
hippies. According to Cole, the An
gels were turned on to LSD by Ken
Kesey, and they were favorably im
pressed by both the drug and the
man. They became involved with
the "acid tests" as a very useful
contingent of bodyguards, and

gradually began to hang out in the
Haight area. Mild mannered, karmic
hippies were in turn impressed that
these legendary "bad guys" would
spend time with them, and they ap
proved of the Angels as yet another
group of outsiders.
Perry has also gathered a good
deal of information about the Dig
gers, a group of
philanthropists/misanthropists who
ran a free store (free because it's
yours) and served daily free
lunches that they had begged,
borrowed or stolen from suppliers.
The Diggers, led by Emmet
Grogan, were figure heads in the
Haight community; their actions
were the most consistent
manifestation of hippie ethics. They
were both surrealists (in order to
get your free lunch, you had to pass
through a six-foot tall, yellow
painted "frame of reference") and

social activists, attempting to feed
and clothe the increasing numbers
who flocked to the Haight to be
free.
The "history" part of the book
ends with the Death of Hippie cere
mony performed in the Haight in
late 1967, and then Perry tries to
tie everything together with an
epilogue. The last sections of the
"history" are choppy and
melodramatic — by listing random
events that may or may not have
ominous overtones, Perry seems
to want us to piece together some
"obvious" conclusion about the
Haight's demise. Maybe I was
trying to read too much into the
text, but entries such as "Linda
Byrd Johnson annouced her en
gagement. The Hearst newspapers
ran banner headlines for a story by
columnist Bob Considine, 'We're
clobbering them in Vietnam. Chet
Helm's house on Wilmont Street
near old Pine Street neighborhood
burned down' " left me feeling like

I'd call it anything that documents
something that people kind of re
member, or think they do, and are
eager to find out more about. "The
Haight-Ashbury" will in fact tell the
uninformed a lot about what hap
pened in San Francisco in 1966 and
1977, and has pleasant surprises for
both the jaded and the '60s throw
back. But sometimes Perry's infor
mation gets bogged down by his

writing style.
Admittedly, this type of book
isn't very easy to write. Accounts
of events that have just happened
always seem a little sensationalis
tic, a little exploitative — unless the
writer overcompensates by making
the work dry and "factual." There's
also a problem of perspective;
when writing about events that hap
pened 200 years ago, one has 200
years of scholarship with which to
agree or disagree. The contempo
rary historian has only a handful of
just-written essays and his own
debatable opinions.
Because he has only shaky
footing to stand on, Perry's per
spective is unclear. I can't tell
whether he's attempting to chain
himself to a pillar of absolute impar
tiality, whether he is writing from
the viewpoint of someone who ac
tually experienced the "Summer of
Love" and is looking back a bit cyni
cally, or whether he's trying to get
the reader to experience the events
as they happened, without drawing
any conclusion until the end.
Perry's "history" is part episodic
chronology, part interpretive es
say. There are times when the

events of the Summer of Love beg
interpretation, and times when
Perry is able to support interesting
ideas with new information. But the
text, in which dated "entries" are
cross-cut haphazardly with ex
plicative passages, has a strange
texture. The dates before journal
entries give the events an air of
melodrama that doesn't match
Perry's matter-of-fact prose.
The text is drawn from an ad
mirably wide variety of sources,
and paints a good general picture of
what went on in the Haight. Before
describing the actual neighbor
hood, Perry sums up social, politi
cal and cultural events just before
1966, concentrating on the music
scene and the development of the
fledgling hippie ethic. He then goes
on to document the Haight's trans
formation from a relatively sane
student neighborhood whose resi
dents wore Edwardian clothes to
match the Victorian house they
lived in, to the home of be-ins, Dig
ger feeds and tie-dye rainbows in
the park.
Perry pays a great deal of atten
tion to the music scene in the
Haight — I gathered that he felt

that the rock scene (and country
western scene) was the cement
that held the Haight together, and
was at least as important as drug
culture.
One of the things that differenti
ates this history of the Haight from
others that I've read is Perry's hos
tility toward LSD. It's hard for him
to remain impartial toward the
Haight's residents and ringleaders
when he suggests that LSD was
tried by people who were "crazy
enough to take it." Actually, most
of the things I've read about the
Haight and the hippie ethic have
overglorified acid culture, so
Perry's familiar-but-disapproving
approach was refreshing.
Other things new to me: Perry
gives a good background on the
reciprocal relationship between the
Hell's Angels and the Haight
hippies. According to Cole, the An
gels were turned on to LSD by Ken
Kesey, and they were favorably im
pressed by both the drug and the
man. They became involved with
the "acid tests" as a very useful
contingent of bodyguards, and

gradually began to hang out in the
Haight area. Mild mannered, karmic
hippies were in turn impressed that
these legendary "bad guys" would
spend time with them, and they ap
proved of the Angels as yet another
group of outsiders.
Perry has also gathered a good
deal of information about the Dig
gers, a group of
philanthropists/misanthropists who
ran a free store (free because it's
yours) and served daily free
lunches that they had begged,
borrowed or stolen from suppliers.
The Diggers, led by Emmet
Grogan, were figure heads in the
Haight community; their actions
were the most consistent
manifestation of hippie ethics. They
were both surrealists (in order to
get your free lunch, you had to pass
through a six-foot tall, yellow
painted "frame of reference") and

social activists, attempting to feed
and clothe the increasing numbers
who flocked to the Haight to be
free.
The "history" part of the book
ends with the Death of Hippie cere
mony performed in the Haight in
late 1967, and then Perry tries to
tie everything together with an
epilogue. The last sections of the
"history" are choppy and
melodramatic — by listing random
events that may or may not have
ominous overtones, Perry seems
to want us to piece together some
"obvious" conclusion about the
Haight's demise. Maybe I was
trying to read too much into the
text, but entries such as "Linda
Byrd Johnson annouced her en
gagement. The Hearst newspapers
ran banner headlines for a story by
columnist Bob Considine, 'We're
clobbering them in Vietnam. Chet
Helm's house on Wilmont Street
near old Pine Street neighborhood
burned down' " left me feeling like
maybe I was missing something.
