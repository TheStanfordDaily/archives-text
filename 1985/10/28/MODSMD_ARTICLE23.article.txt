novel released at the beginning of this year, is
a return to contemporary material.
Oates is one of the most prolific writers of
her generation. She has been writing at a
frenetic pace since high school, and it is
rumored that while at Syracuse University she
"would write a novel on a ream of paper, flip
the paper over and begin writing on the other
side."
A member of the American Academy and In
situte of Arts and Letters, Oates lives in
Princeton, N.J., where she is on the faculty of
Princeton University.
