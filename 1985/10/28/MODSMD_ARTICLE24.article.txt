## Cardinal Hits 'Cats Where it Hurts 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
On a warm October afternoon,
the Stanford football team put a
season of frustration behind itself
by registering a 28-17 upset victory
over an Arizona team with the Rose
Bowl in its sights.
The Cardinal had come into Stan
ford Stadium on Saturday with a 1-5
record and was winless in its first
three games in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. Arizona was 5-1 and unde
feated in Pac-10 play. But the Card
inal threw those numbers out the
window and went out to play the
complete football game that had
eluded it for five long weeks.

The Cardinal dispelled the
rumors that it was a bad football
team, that it had given up on the
season, that next year was the only
thing to look toward, that watching
Stanford football should be low on a
list of things to do on Saturday.
Only 40,000 were on hand to wit
ness the coming-out party, but
word of this game should travel.
Afterward, the Cardinal basked
in the moment of its biggest upset
at home since a 34-15 win over Illi
nois last September, shouting,
cheering and even doing a Stanford
spell-out. When the locker room
was opened, the subdued murmur
that had prevailed for weeks gave
way to joy that had been all too ab
sent for all too long.
The Stanford defense allowed
only two touchdowns. The running
game accounted for 94 yards ex
cluding sacks. The line gave the
quarterbacks time and allowed only
one sack. And the Cardinal came up
with four big turnovers.
"We'll just keep coming at you,
and when we get the chance we'll
grab it," Stanford Coach Jack Elway
said. "I'm damn happy for them."
Arizona Coach Larry Smith said,
"Our defense was on the field
too long, and the Stanford offense
really started to execute. It was a
day of breaks that went against us.
But you've got to make your own
breaks, too. We just weren't oppor
tunistic."
But the Cardinal was. "We
showed today that we can play,"
cornerback Toi Cook said. "We
showed consistency and didn't give
up the big play. We came up with
the big play today."
Meanwhile, the offensive line,
which had been called
"inexperienced" at best and "bad"
at worst, atoned for a string of poor
performances. "We had our backs
against the wall. The offensive line
hadn't done the job. Today, we just
said, 'God, we've got to do it,' "
guard Tom Nye said.
"We came out in the third quar
ter, and their defense was talking
shit. That fired us all up. For the
rest of the game, we gave them all
we had."

The Stanford defense turned in one of its finest performances
Saturday, limiting Arizona to 18 first downs, 295 yards total of
fense and two touchdowns.
