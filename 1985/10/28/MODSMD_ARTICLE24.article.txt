## Cardinal Hits 'Cats Where it Hurts 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
On a warm October afternoon,
the Stanford football team put a
season of frustration behind itself
by registering a 28-17 upset victory
over an Arizona team with the Rose
Bowl in its sights.
The Cardinal had come into Stan
ford Stadium on Saturday with a 1-5
record and was winless in its first
three games in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. Arizona was 5-1 and unde
feated in Pac-10 play. But the Card
inal threw those numbers out the
window and went out to play the
complete football game that had
eluded it for five long weeks.

The Cardinal dispelled the
rumors that it was a bad football
team, that it had given up on the
season, that next year was the only
thing to look toward, that watching
Stanford football should be low on a
list of things to do on Saturday.
Only 40,000 were on hand to wit
ness the coming-out party, but
word of this game should travel.
Afterward, the Cardinal basked
in the moment of its biggest upset
at home since a 34-15 win over Illi
nois last September, shouting,
cheering and even doing a Stanford
spell-out. When the locker room
was opened, the subdued murmur
that had prevailed for weeks gave
way to joy that had been all too ab
sent for all too long.
The Stanford defense allowed
only two touchdowns. The running
game accounted for 94 yards ex
cluding sacks. The line gave the
quarterbacks time and allowed only
one sack. And the Cardinal came up
with four big turnovers.
"We'll just keep coming at you,
and when we get the chance we'll
grab it," Stanford Coach Jack Elway
said. "I'm damn happy for them."
Arizona Coach Larry Smith said,
"Our defense was on the field
too long, and the Stanford offense
really started to execute. It was a
day of breaks that went against us.
But you've got to make your own
breaks, too. We just weren't oppor
tunistic."
But the Cardinal was. "We
showed today that we can play,"
cornerback Toi Cook said. "We
showed consistency and didn't give
up the big play. We came up with
the big play today."
Meanwhile, the offensive line,
which had been called
"inexperienced" at best and "bad"
at worst, atoned for a string of poor
performances. "We had our backs
against the wall. The offensive line
hadn't done the job. Today, we just
said, 'God, we've got to do it,' "
guard Tom Nye said.
"We came out in the third quar
ter, and their defense was talking
shit. That fired us all up. For the
rest of the game, we gave them all
we had."
The rushing game was still miss
ing fullback Brad Muster, who

Saturday, limiting Arizona to 18 first downs, 295 yards total of

remained sidelined with a bruised
sternum. While not a dominant
force, the ground attack served to
keep the Wildcats off-balance just
enough. Brian Morris had 26 yards
in relief of Muster, and tailbacks
Kevin Scott and Thomas Henley
had 31 and 26, respectively.
"We're not going to have a one
dimensional offense," Morris said.
"We ran just enough to keep them
inside. We forced the linebackers to
step inside, and the linemen
couldn't pin their ears back and
rush."
Morris himself was lucky to play,
suffering from digestive problems.
"I had a disagreement with break
fast," he said.
Stanford held Arizona to 295
yards, while itself gaining 338
yards, 270 of that in the air. Stan
ford was penalized only four times
all game. It recovered five of its six
fumbles. And the Cardinal held the
ball for 36 minutes, to 24 for
Arizona.

Morris' five-yard run on a sweep
with exactly 10 minutes left in the
game put the Cardinal ahead to stay
at 21-17, but it was a decision made
at halftime that helped turn a 17-7
Wildcat lead at the intermission into
Stanford's first victory since a 41-7
thrashing of San Jose State in the
opener six weeks earlier.
When the Cardinal got the ball for
the first time in the third quarter,
quarterback John Paye, who was
scratched from the starting lineup
with a separated shoulder, joined
his teammates in the huddle. Paye
proceeded to lead Stanford to three
second-half touchdowns and the
victory.
Despite the partial separation in
his throwing arm, Paye completed
12 of 14 passes for 116 yards and a
touchdown.
"When I got into the game, the
adreneline started pumping. I didn't
feel it," Paye said.
Elway said that the decision to
play Paye "went right up until game
day. We went out for pregame to
see what kind of velocity he had,
and he looked pretty good. He
wanted to play."

And play he did. After an inter
ception by Arizona safety Chuck
Cecil ended his opening drive, Cook
came back with an interception of a
Jenkins pass to give the Cardinal
the ball on the Arizona 25.
After a loss to the 31, Paye found
Baty open at the 16. Three plays
later, he dropped back and had a
safety blitzing in his face. Henley
was where the safety would have
been. Paye threw. Henley caught.
17-14 Arizona.
Paye then took Stanford 74 yards
on 11 plays to take the lead. Baty
caught four passes on that drive, in
cluding a 20-yarder on a third-and
four to keep it alive.
Baty finished with nine catches
for 131 yards, which gave him the
Stanford single-season record for
receptions by a tight end. And
that's after only seven games.
Baty, with 46 receptions, eclipsed
Chris Burford's record of 45 set in
1958.
When Morris went that five yards
behind the blocks of Kevin Scott
and Tom Nye to give Stanford the
21-17 lead, things were far from
safe. They became a little more so
on the ensuing kickoff. After a
roughing penalty on David
Sweeney's conversion allowed
Sweeney to kickoff from the
Arizona 45, reserve linebacker
Kevin Richardson recovered a
fumble by tailback David Eldridge
on the Wildcat 19.
Five plays later, Paye snuck in
from a few inches out to complete
the scoring with 7:39 to play.
Arizona wasn't done, though.
The Wildcats took the kickoff and
marched to the Stanford two with
just over five minutes left. On a
first-and-goal, Eldridge appeared
set to take it in, but linebacker Jack
Gilmete jarred the ball loose. It
rolled out of the end zone, and with
it may have rolled Arizona's
reservations in Pasadena on New
Year's Day.
Stanford then ran out the clock

with 13 plays, including a 31-yard
gain on a fake-punt pass from Doug
Robison to Craig Landis with 37
seconds remaining. Robison had
reason to relish the final nail in the
Wilcat coffin â€” one year ago he had
had three punts blocked to set up
Arizona touchdowns in the 28-14
Cardinal loss.
Paye's performance over
shadowed that of Fred Buckley,
who pointed out that he was 1-0 as
a starter.
Explaining why he started Buck
ley, Elway said, "Because Fred
worked all week in practice, it was
only right that he should start. He
didn't play too badly."
Buckley went 12-of-14 for 123
yards in the first half and keyed the
Cardinal's first touchdown drive
with a pair of completions to Baty,
covering 27 and 23 yards.
That drive culminated in a three
yard scoring burst by Morris which
gave Stanford a 7-0 lead with 6:27
left in the first quarter.
Eldridge sprinted around the left
side to tie the game at 7-7 less than

a minute into the second period,
capping a 65-yard drive.
Later in the game, Max Zendejas
drilled a 35-yard field goal to put the
Wildcats ahead.
Arizona also put together a 58-
yard drive, highlighted by a 20-yard
dash by fullback Charles Webb and a
22-yard pass from Alfred Jenkins to
Jeff Fairholm, the longest plays of
the day for the Wildcat offense.
Jenkins scored on a one-yard
keeper to make it 17-7 with two
minutes left in the half.
Arizona seemed poised to blow
things open when cornerback Gor
don Bunch intercepted a Buckley
pass at his own 45. The Wildcats
drove to the Stanford 31, but Fred
Stahl recovered a Jenkins fumble
for the Cardinal to end the threat.
And then Paye came in after
halftime. And it was good. And the
Cardinal didn't give up. And the
season that was looking very bleak
just three hours before looked just
a little brighter.
"It's like a black cloud dissolv
ing, " Elway said.
