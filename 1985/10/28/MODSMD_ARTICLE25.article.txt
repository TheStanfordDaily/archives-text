Stanford quarterback Fred Buckley was warming up
on the sidelines, getting ready to go in for the second
half of his team's 17-7 game with Arizona, when he got
the word.
"I was in the middle of throwing a pass, and an assis
tant coach came over and said they were going with
Johnny (Paye)," Buckley said. "It really caught me off
guard. Nobody had said anything about it to me. I
thought I had a good first half."
Buckley had what was probably the best half of his
college career, actually â€” 10-of-12 for 123 yards and
only one interception. But for Coach Jack Elway, it
wasn't good enough. Elway decided to put his money

on first-string quarterback John Paye, separated
shoulder and all.
"I'm out to win," Elway said. "We're going to do
everything we can and use our best weapons."
The move worked. Paye led the Cardinal to three
second-half touchdowns and a 28-17 upset of the 19th
ranked Wildcats, hitting on 12 of his 14 passes for 116
yards and a touchdown. Now Paye is headed for
deification, and Elway looks like a genius.
And Buckley is left wondering what he has to do to
stay in the game.
"Hey, I'm 1-0 as a starter, right?" he said, smiling.
"The big thing is that I wanted to win. I'm a team
player." He paused. "I thought I was playing pretty
well, though."
