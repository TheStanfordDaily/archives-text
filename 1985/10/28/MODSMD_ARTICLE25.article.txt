# Surprise Switch the Spark

### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
Stanford quarterback Fred Buckley was warming up
on the sidelines, getting ready to go in for the second
half of his team's 17-7 game with Arizona, when he got
the word.
"I was in the middle of throwing a pass, and an assis
tant coach came over and said they were going with
Johnny (Paye)," Buckley said. "It really caught me off
guard. Nobody had said anything about it to me. I
thought I had a good first half."
Buckley had what was probably the best half of his
college career, actually â€” 10-of-12 for 123 yards and
only one interception. But for Coach Jack Elway, it
wasn't good enough. Elway decided to put his money

on first-string quarterback John Paye, separated
shoulder and all.
"I'm out to win," Elway said. "We're going to do
everything we can and use our best weapons."
The move worked. Paye led the Cardinal to three
second-half touchdowns and a 28-17 upset of the 19th
ranked Wildcats, hitting on 12 of his 14 passes for 116
yards and a touchdown. Now Paye is headed for
deification, and Elway looks like a genius.
And Buckley is left wondering what he has to do to
stay in the game.
"Hey, I'm 1-0 as a starter, right?" he said, smiling.
"The big thing is that I wanted to win. I'm a team
player." He paused. "I thought I was playing pretty
well, though."
Paye praised Buckley's play as
well.
"He made some nice throws,"
Paye said. "I learned a lot by
watching him last year, and I did
the same today. I saw what was
working for him and what wasn't
working for him."

There was disagreement
among the Stanford and Arizona
players on the effect that Paye's
entrance had on the game.
"It was a great feeling to have
your No. 1 quarterback come in,"
Cardinal tight end Greg Baty said.
"A lot of the things he does aren't
throwing the ball. You really rally
around a guy like that."
Stanford guard Tom Nye didn't
feel the same way. "I was a little

surprised (when Paye came in),"
he said. "But I didn't really notice
a difference with him in there. I'm
going to fight my ass off for either
one."
"(Paye) just executed the same
things that Buckley did," said
Wildcat safety Allan Durden.
"Paye's a better quarterback,
you've got to give him that,
but. ..." He shrugged.
As late as Wednesday night,
Paye's chances of playing were
very, very slim. His shoulder was
in a sling all day Sunday, he didn't
practice on Monday or Wednes
day and he had a bad practice on
Tuesday.
"I tried to throw on Tuesday,
and I couldn't," Paye said. "I was
kind of depressed. But when I
woke up on Thursday, my arm
felt 100 percent better. It was a
miraculous recovery.
"I took Friday off, and Coach
Elway told me to tell him how I
felt after the pregame. I warmed
up, and told him I was all right, I
could play."
Because it worked, it can be
called a gutsy move, a brilliantly
timed personnel change. But if it
hadn't, if Paye had reinjured his
shoulder in a game that obviously
meant nothing as far as the Card
inal's postseason chances are
concerned, fans would be
screaming for Elway's head.
"(My shoulder) feels pretty
sore now," Paye said after the
game. "It was hurting me every
time I followed through."
"Quarterbacks have the
reputation as not being tough
guys," Nye said. "But Paye's dif
ferent. One hit, and that could be
it."
It's a scary thought.

"Quarterbacks have the reputation as not being tough guys,"
Stanford guard Tom Nye said. John Paye proved on Satur
day that reputations don't always fit the bill.
