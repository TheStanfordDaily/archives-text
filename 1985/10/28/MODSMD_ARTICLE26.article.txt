# Soccer Squashes Hornets

### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
As the old saying goes, it may
not be pretty, but it's still a victory.
Those must have been the
thoughts of the Stanford men's soc
cer team after it trudged its way to
a 2-1 victory over visiting
Sacramento State Saturday morn
ing.
Freshman Luke Garrott scored
early for the Cardinal, and senior
Angel Vazquez added Stanford's
second goal midway through the
second half. Sacramento, now 6-7-2
on the season, then rallied to score
with only minute left.
The victory was the fifth straight
for Stanford and improved the

team's season mark to 10-6-2 over
all. But the team did not play as well
as it had in its past four victories.
"We just weren't mentally ready
to play the game," Stanford Asst.
Coach Hunter Stern said.
After flying through four con
secutive victories in the tough
Pacific Soccer Conference, Stan
ford may have taken this game
against the Division II Hornets too
lightly.
In the first 10 minutes Saturday,
however, the Cardinal appeared to
be heading for a runaway victory.
Just four minutes into the contest,
Garrott put Stanford ahead 1-0.
"(Giancarlo) Ferruzzi and I ran a
give and go," Garrott said. "Then I
squared the ball to Marshall
(Monroe). He gave me a beautiful

return pass and I put it in the left
corner of the goal."
The Cardinal continued to put on
pressure for the next five minutes,
but then the quality of the team's
play began to slowly decline. Stan
ford still controlled the game, but
the sharp play and good chemistry
disappeared.
The score stayed at 1-0 well into
the second half. By then,
Sacramento had found a groove and
had elevated the level of its play. In
fact, about 20 minutes into the half,
Hornet forward George Artenstein
almost evened the score.
Artenstein booted a shot that got
by Stanford goaltender Tom Aus
tin, but Cardinal fullback Todd
Rafalovich made a foot save just in
front of the goal line.

Stanford responded to the Hor
net's attack immediately. Cardinal
seniors Vazquez and Dave Daniels
led a counter-attack down the right
side of the field. Daniels fought his
way into shooting range and
delivered a hard shot on goal.
The ball rebounded off a
defender, and Vazquez boomed it
into the top of the goal to give Stan
ford a 2-0 lead.
For its part, Sacramento kept
plugging away, and with one minute
left in the game the Hornets broke
Stanford's string of 334 minutes
without allowing a goal.
Hornet midfielder Jose Aguire
pushed a low ball across the goal
mouth where Artenstein slipped it
by the diving Austin for the score.
