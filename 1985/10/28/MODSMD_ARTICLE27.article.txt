# Long Beach Short Against Stanford
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff writer 
If the Long Beach State water polo team
learned anything during its match against Stan
ford Friday, it was that pacing is extremely im
portant. As the Cardinal's 8-6 victory proved,
the team that comes out the fastest at the start
does not always finish on top.
Long Beach, No. 6 entering the match, came
out very strong in the first quarter in an effort to
virtually put the Cardinal out of the game. While
that strategy worked for one quarter, the
remaining three quarters of the match came back
to haunt the 49ers.
"Long Beach was so psyched to beat us that
they virtually blasted out at the first whistle,
Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti said. "They
sprinted all-out after every ball and went for
every fast break at full speed. While it would be
nice to play like that all the time, it is physically
impossible."
Long Beach's initial vigor allowed it to jump
out to a 4-1 lead after the first quarter, but in the
second quarter a gradual turn-around took place
as the Cardinal began dominating the play. In the
second half, during which Stanford scored six of
its eight goals, a definite Cardinal edge was ap
parent.
"In the first quarter we didn't help each other

out on the fast breaks and we made a few er
rors," Dettamanti said. "Despite that, we were
never really worried. I knew we were the better
team and that there was no way Long Beach
could keep up the intense effort they started out
with. We didn't panic, we just paced ourselves
and played our own game.'
After the first quarter, Stanford came back
from its three-goal deficit to score the next five
goals, giving the Cardinal a 6-4 lead. Stanford
maintained a three-goal lead for most of the final
quarter.

Stanford's three-quarter scoring attack was a
total team effort, with six players scoring.
Juniors Chris Thompson and Craig Klass had two
goals apiece while Greg Gamble, David Imber
nino, Jaime Velez and Matt Tingler added one
each.
Tingler's goal, Stanford's first of the game,
was crucial for the team because it put the Card

inal onto the scoreboard and into the game. With
a 6-5 "man-up" advantage, Stanford called a
time-out and set up a play. Dettamanti told the
team that the 49er goalie reacted strongly to the
fake and Tingler used that information for all it
was worth. Tingler faked, the goalie went for the
fake, and Tingler scored on a direct shot.
"Matt played really well for us and came
through with our first goal when we really
needed it," Dettamanti said. "Matt is our '6-5
specialist,' and even though he hasn't really been
scoring all that much, he has really been key in
assists, passing to the open man."
It was Tingler who assisted Klass in his
second quarter goal, starting off the Cardinal's
string of five consecutive goals.
Except for a few breakdowns in the first quar
ter, the Cardinal defense held back the 49ers.
Before the match, the defense planned to focus
much of its efforts on stopping Long Beach's Phil
Castillo. Due to double coverage and strong
zone defense, Castillo's scoring attack was com
pletely shut down.

will more than likely move into the No. 1 spot in
the rankings. UC-Berkeley, currenty atop the
NCAA poll, lost two games this weekend in

With only three conference matches remain
ing, the Cardinal is really "in the driver's seat,"
according to Dettamanti.
