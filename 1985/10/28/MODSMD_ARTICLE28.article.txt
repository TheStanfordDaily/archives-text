# Royals Complete Comeback, 11-0

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) —
The Kansas City Royals, rallying
behind the five-hit pitching of
Bret Saberhagen, completed one
of baseball's most shocking come
back last night and won their
first World Series championship,
defeating the St. Louis Cardinals
11-0 in the decisive seventh
game.
The Cardinals, who had seen
their 3-1 lead in games vanish
along with their hitting, simply
collapsed in the final game.
What had been billed as the
greatest seventh-game pitching
matchup in more than two
decades went up in smoke
created by the Royals' bats. The
Cardinals' ace, 21-game winner
John Tudor, couldn't even make
it through the third inning and
wound up in a Kansas City hospi
tal for stitches after cutting his
index finger on an electric fan in
the clubhouse.
The destruction occurred at
the hands of platoon outfielder
Darryl Motley, who hit a two-run
homer and drove in three runs;
Steve Balboni, who drove in two
of Kansas City's three runs in
the third inning; and the sud
denly rejuvenated George Brett,
who had four hits.
The Royals put the game
away with six runs in the fifth in
ning, during which both pitcher
Joaquin Andujar and Manager
Whitey Herzog were ejected by
home plate umpire Don
Denkinger. Herzog had argued a
critical Denkinger call at first
base that fueled the Royals' win
ning, ninth-inning rally in Game
6, and consecutive ball calls on
inside pitches to Royals catcher
Jim Sundberg brought all the
frustration erupted to the
surface.
While the Royals completed a

comeback unprecedented in the
game — recovering not only
from a 1-3 deficit in the Ameri
can League playoffs but from 0-2
and 1-3 disadvantages in the Se
ries — the Cardinals faded into
offensive oblivion.
Saberhagen, selected series
Most Valuable Player, allowed a
second-inning single to Jack
Clark, then retired 11 in a row
before giving up another single
to Tito Landrum with two out in
the fifth inning. He also allowed
singles to Ozzie Smith, Andy
Van Slyke and Terry Pendleton.

Darryl Motley's two-run
home run and the five-hit
pitching of Bret Saber
hagen combined to power
the Royals to a seventh
game victory that brought
the World Series title to
Kansas City.

The Kansas City right-hander
pitched the Royals' first victory
of this Series, a six-hitter in
Game 3.
The Royals' hitters, mean
while, asked for no quarter, and
gave none. After dispensing with
Tudor, they slugged their way
through another six St. Louis
pitchers, winding up with 14 hits
and the greatest margin of vic
tory ever in the seventh game of
a World Series. The Cardinals
used five pitchers in the fifth in
ning, tying a World Series record
set by Baltimore in 1979.
