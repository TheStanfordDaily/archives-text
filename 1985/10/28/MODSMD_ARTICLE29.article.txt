# Golfers Take Invite

### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Darkness fell on the end of the
Stanford Fall Intercollegiate Tourn
ament Saturday, but that didn't dim
the spirits of the Stanford men's
golf team. The Cardinal golfers shot
par (355) as a team in the final
round of play this weekend to
capture their own event for the
second straight year.
The University of Southern Cali
fornia wound up as the tourna
ment's runner-up, just 10 strokes
behind Stanford, 1089 to 1099.
Louisiana State took third place at
1105.
"LSU is ranked fourth — they
showed it in this tournament,"
Cardinal Coach Tim Schaaf said.
"It's very tough to play here for the
first time. USC always plays pretty
tough here."
Carl Wagner shot a 66 in the final
round to lead the Cardinal back
from a three-stroke deficit after 36
holes. Wagner's play catapulted him
up to a third-place tie with USC's
heralded Sam Randolph in the indiv
dual standings at 214.
Northwestern's Jim Benepe led
from wire to wire, winning the indi
vidual crown with a score of 211.
LSU's Bob Friend was second with
a 213.
All those connected with Stan
ford viewed the victory as a sort of
vindication. Many in the sport did
not expect the Cardinal to be a fac
tor in men's golf this year.
"I think it's a lot better team than
it's been given credit for being,"
Schaaf said. "You don't have to
worry about them. They don't
make mental mistakes and they're
well-prepared. That's not all that
obvious."
Stanford went a long way toward
securing the title at the start of Sat
urday's third round. The team
raced out of the starting gate to be
seven-under-par after seven holes
as a team, while USC began slug
gishly.
"I was a little surprised USC got
off to such a bad start," Schaaf said.
"They really put themselves into a
hole. Randolph was four over par

after four holes — that kind of took
him out.
"The round under these condi
tions (fog and darkness) was excel
lent," he said. "We had a tremen
dous amount of momentum, and
Carl kept getting further and fur
ther under par."
Don Walsworth, who tied for
second on the team with a 218,
downplayed his own play in the
wake of Stanford's victory.
"I was not very pleased with the
way I started or finished (the tourn

ament)," he said, "though on the
whole I played well. I can't tell you
how excited I am for the team. This
put an answer to a lot of people's
doubts. We can play with
everybody.
"I thought Carl Wagner was a god
today," Walsworth said. "His round
was fantastic. I'm really glad for
him."
"I started putting well," Wagner
said, "Because of that, I started hit-
