# Contract Talks Still at Impasse
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
Despite a United Stanford
Workers (USW) strike deadline set
for Thursday, contract negotiations
between University and union offi
cials produced no positive results
over the weekend, according to
USW chief negotiator Mary Ann
Tenuto.
Both sides expressed concern
for the lagging negotiations.
"We're spending all of our time
looking for an avenue to avert what
seems to be a crisis," said Priscilla
Wheeler, chief negotiator and staff
counsel for the University.
Union officials would not spec
ulate on the chances of a strike.
"I think that depends on what
happens in the next three days,"
Tenuto said.
In order to avoid a strike, the two
negotiating teams must settle on a
contract by Wednesday. Union
members will then vote on
Thursday whether to accept the
new contract or to reject it and go
out on strike, according to Tenuto.
The two sides met separately
with federal mediator Maggie Jacob
son on Thursday, Friday and Satur
day, at which time the University
made proposals in non-economic
areas, Wheeler said.
It was "very discouraging" for
the union to refuse to offer coun
terproposals, WTieeler said after the
meetings.
"It rather looks like members of
the union team want to strike," she
said.
But Tenuto said the union has
made movement in the negotia
tions. "If we wanted to strike, why
would we be working for two

months without a contract," she
said.
"We've given them several eco
nomic counterproposals," she
added.
Tenuto then cited USW's scaling
down of its pension plan as an ex
ample of movement on its part.
Currently, the union is seeking to
have pension payments adjusted to
1974 wages during the second year
of the proposed three-year contract
and then re-adjusted to 1976 wages
during the third year.

Under the old contract, pension
payments are calculated according
to 1971 wages.
At the time USW made the offer,
Wheeler said the pension proposal
did not represent "substantive
movement."
University and union officials also
disagree on the Universiy's most
recent proposal regarding affirma
tive action committees that investi
gate ways to train workers for
more skilled positions.
USW leaders say the new pro
posal, which calls for the elimination
of the Committee on Union and
University Concerns, would leave
the workers without any affirmative
action committee.
But Wheeler said the Univer
sity's proposal has allowed for local
committees on affirmative action
and safety. In addition, either side
would be able to call for a meeting
to be held within 30 days.
Tenuto could not explain the dis
crepancy in the interpretation of the
University's proposal.. "I don't
know what she's talking about," she
said.
