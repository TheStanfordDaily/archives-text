# Card Routed
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
The pieces have been there,
but the women's soccer team
has consistently been unable to
put them in place. So far this
season, the offense and defense
never seem to really click on the
same day for the Card women.
Saturday, neither facet of the
Cardinal game was working. As
a result, Hayward State had no
problems defeating the Cardinal
by a score of 4-0.
Coming into the match, the
Pioneers were undefeated and
ranked fifth in the country. Stan
ford found out why.
Hayward dominated the first
half. The Pioneer defense was
strong and it was "hard to get a
lot of offense going," women's

soccer Coach Helen Keohane
said.
And to make matters worse,
the Cardinal defense was having
a hard time staying with
Hayward's fast forwards.
Defense has been the Cardinal's
trademark this season, but the
Pioneer's combination of team
work and talent proved to be too
much.
"They played well with each
other and they had a lot of skill
and a fair amount of size. People
(Stanford's front-line defenders)
were losing their marks,"
Keohane said.
By the end of the first half, the
Pioneers had tallied three goals
and for the most part had put the
game away.
A slower second stanza
produced one more Hayward
goal and a final score of 4-0.
