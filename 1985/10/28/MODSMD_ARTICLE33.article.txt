Israel Raids Palestinian Bases
TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli warplanes attacked two Palestinian
bases near the town of Bar-Elias in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley yester
day afternoon, an Israeli military spokesman said.
All aircraft returned safely from the Syrian-occupied area to their
Israeli bases, the spokesman said. The pilots reported scoring many
"good hits," according to the spokesman, who said tanks and am- 1
munition depots bases were the main targets. There was no mention
of casualties.
The targets were said to be under the control of the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine under Ahmed Jibril.
It was the third Israeli air raid against Palestinian installations
since Sept. 26, when bases in eastern Lebanon were attacked. On
Oct. 1, Israeli jets devastated the PLO headquarters outside Tunis,
the Tunisian capital.
Those raids were carried out in retaliation for the murder of three
Israelis on board a yacht in Cyprus Sept. 25.
At least four Israeli planes were involved in the raids, Lebanese
radio reports said.
Two fighters provided air cover while two others dived on their
targets, a police spokesman in Beirut said.
Palestinian guerrillas and Syrian troops later cordoned off the bases.
Thieves Steal Priceless Art
PARIS — In a daring half-hour raid, a gang of professional art
thieves held about 50 visitors and guards at gunpoint yesterday
morning at Paris' Marmottan Museum and got away with nine Im
pressionist paintings of almost incalculable value.
Josette Tavera, curator of the museum, said the most valuable
painting taken was "Sunrise, an Impression," painted by Claude
Monet in 1872 and donated to the museum in 1950. It is the painting
that gave the turn-of-the-century Impressionist school its name and
is considered to be worth at least $3 million.
Fifteen minutes after the museum's normal 10 a.m. Sunday
opening, the gunmen — numbering three or four, according to
various accounts — drove up and double-parked their car in front,
leaving the car trunk open. They entered the museum, which was
once a private townhouse near the Bois de Boulogne, and apparently
were joined by several accomplices who had arrived with the first
Sunday morning visitors.
Brandishing pistols, several of the gang quickly herded the
museum visitors and eight guards into one room while others swiftly
lifted from the walls five paintings by Monet, two by Pierre-Auguste
Renoir, among them "Portrait of Monet," and others by Berthe
Morisot. Within minutes, the paintings had been loaded into the trunk
of the waiting car, and the gang sped off.
A burglar alarm that was set to go off at the nearest police station
if any of the museum canvases was disturbed had been turned off
when the museum opened. According to museum officials, the oper
ation bore the mark of professionals who knew exactly what they
wanted and had planned and timed their raid with precision.
Alfonsin Declares State of Siege
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — President Raul Alfonsin Friday
declared a state of siege in Argentina for a period of 60 days to com
bat a wave of bomb attacks just nine days before congressional elec
tions are scheduled.
The action, which is sure to provoke controversy here, marked
the first time a state of emergency had been declared in Argentina
since democracy returned in 1983. Alfonsin's election followed seven
years of rule by military juntas.
Officials said the action, which legally authorizes a suspension of
civil liberties, including a ban on gatherings of more than three
people, would not be enforced against election rallies.
Interior Minister Antonio Troccoli told reporters that the elec
tions, scheduled for Nov. 3, would go ahead as planned. But he
defended the sudden clampdown as necessary to curb a recent esca
lation of violence and to keep in detention without trial those
suspected of being responsible for a series of anonymous bombings
and telephone threats widely seen as politically motivated.
Troccoli said that Friday's surprise announcement meant that the
arrests of 12 suspected conspirators could be renewed, and the gov
ernment issued a separate decree doing so.
Government officials suspect the assaults are the work of right
wing extremists, upset with Alfonsin's decision to place former mili
tary junta leaders on trial for human-rights offenses and with govern
ment attempts to curb the influence of the armed forces. These
rightist groups are thought to be trying to make Alfonsin's civilian ad
ministration appear weak and to provoke a reassertion of power by
the military.
Delegation Works on Statement
WASHINGTON — An "important focus" of a U.S. delegation's
visit to Moscow this week will be an effort to craft an arms control
statement that could be issued by President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev during the Geneva summit next month,
Reagan's national security adviser said yesterday.
But Robert McFarlane, who will leave Saturday for Moscow with
Secretary of State George Shultz for the crucial pre-summit
meetings Nov. 4 and 5, also warned the Soviet Union that no new
U.S.-Soviet arms agreement would be acceptable to Congress or the
American people without some broader change in Soviet behavior.
The Reagan Administration has been working toward a
"declaration at Geneva" that would provide U.S. and Soviet
negotiators at the current arms control talks with new instructions
that would step up the pace toward agreement.
Leftists March Near Palace
MANILA, Philippines — About 5,000 leftist demonstrators
marched in a funeral procession yesterday to an intersection near
President Ferdinand Marcos's Malacanang Palace, where they
vowed to avenge two slain students and burned effigies of Marcos
and Uncle Sam.
The march from a Manila church to a double row of barbed-wire
barricades across Mendiola Bridge, about 400 yards from the palace
gates, defied a new law on public demonstrations and Marcos's an
nouncement last week of a "more aggressive and tougher" policy
against unruly street protests.
But security forces stayed out of sight even as the protesters
burned the effigies atop the barricades, and there were no violent
incidents. <
Organized by a coalition that even Marcos's opponents concede is
essentially a Communist front, the demonstrators came equipped to
battle police, who last Monday fatally shot the two teen-aged mar
chers mourned yesterday.
