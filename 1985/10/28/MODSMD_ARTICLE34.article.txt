## Peres Claims Talks Without PLO Possible

JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres, defending his proposals for
U.N.-initiated peace talks at a stormy Cabinet
meeting, said yesterday that recent events have
brought about a "dramatic change" that could
lead to direct Israeli-Jordanian peace talks with
out the Palestine Liberation Organization.
At the same time, Peres seemed to retreat
slightly from the speech he delivered at the
United Nations last week in which he called upon
the U.N. Security Council to initiate and support
direct negotiations between Israel and a
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.
According to government sources, this aspect
of Peres' speech came in for harsh criticism at an
unusually long six-hour Cabinet meeting con
vened hours after his return from France, where
he stopped off for talks en route home from the
United States.
Led by Trade Minister Ariel Sharon, hard-line
members of the government's Likud faction
charged that Peres' proposals violated the
agreement on which the 14-month-old "national
unity" coalition was based. That agreement

pledges both Peres' own Labor Alignment and
the rival Likud Bloc to keep Israel's peace efforts
within the guidelines of the 1979 Camp David ac
cords and to shun an international peace confer
ence as sought by Jordan, Egypt and the PLO.
Meeting Saturday night, Likud members
within the Cabinet adopted what they called the
"four no's," rejecting negotiations with the PLO,
an interim agreement with Jordan, territorial
compromise and — most important, they
stressed — the convening of peace talks under
international auspices.
Analysts had predicted that the Labor-Likud
differences would result in a coalition showdown,
but a government source said after the Cabinet
meeting that Peres told the Likud ministers that
his idea would limit the Security Council role to a
statement calling on Israel and Jordan to begin
direct negotiations. Once the Security Council
had given its blessing to the talks, it would bow
out of the negotiations, the source quoted Peres
as saying.
Urging the Cabinet to support his initiative,
Peres said he perceived "a dramatic change in

Israel's situation at this time, a chance for the re
jection of the PLO and for peace negotiations be
tween Israel and a Jordanian-Palestinian delega
tion."
He was referring to the tensions that have
become apparent between Jordan and the PLO
following the hijacking of the Italian cruise ship
Achille Lauro by Palestinian terrorists and the
collapse of a proposed meeting in London be
tween British Foreign Ministry officials and
senior PLO representatives.
However, Peres' appraisal of "a dramatic
change" was contradicted yesterday by Jordan's
Information Minister Mohammed Khatib, who af
firmed the Jordanian position that talks with Is
rael should take place in an international forum
and only with the participation of the PLO.
"Jordan reaffirms its categorical refusal to hold
direct negotiations or to make partial or bilateral
agreements with Israel," Khatib said in a state
ment released in Amman.
Khatib added that he was making the state
ment to counter reports in the United States and
Israel that "Jordan's position might be changing."
