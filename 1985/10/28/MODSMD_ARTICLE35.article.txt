# Violence Escalates in South Africa

### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
â€” Black rioters opened fire on
police for the first time outside the
Cape Town area, wounding two of
ficers Saturday night, in an incident
marking a distinct escalation in the
pattern of South Africa's political
strife.
Fresh violence was reported
yesterday amid signs that South
African authorities were preparing
for a crackdown on reporters as
part of its increasingly harsh reac
tion to 14 months of turmoil.
The police were wounded in the
country town of Beaufort West, in
central Cape Province, after a day
of clashes in which a mixed-race
man was killed and 10 blacks, in
cluding one woman, were wounded
by police gunfire.

A warning yesterday in the mass
circulation Afrikaans-language
newspaper Rapport that "strong ac
tion" would be taken against the
press soon was followed by the first
arrest of a Cape Town reporter un
der emergency regulations that
were extended into the area Satur
day. The reporter was held for six
hours after entering a mixed-race
township to report on a meeting
planned by a group of activists.
Four foreign journalists were
detained by authorities in Cape
Town Friday for more than three
hours before they were released
without charges.
There has been a buildup of
criticism of the role of the press in
recent weeks, and the foreign
press has been blamed for present

ing a distorted image of unrest in
South Africa and thereby contribu
ting to the country's financial crisis.
Last night authorities announced
sweeping new regulations banning
all meetings by 102 anti-apartheid
organizations in the area, where
two months of violence have
resulted in about 70 deaths.
Four more blacks were shot dead
by the police in townships of Cape
Province, and there were reports
of clashes from at least a dozen
other centers Saturday night and
yesterday.
The trouble in Beaufort West
began Friday after an inquest ver
dict by a local magistrate, who
found that the police had acted in
self-defense when they shot a local
black political leader, Mandlenkosi

Kratshi, last January.
Police fired tear gas at a crowd
that demonstrated angrily against
the verdict. There were further
clashes Saturday when troops and
police surrounded Beaufort West's
black townships, where about
6,000 people live, and began house
to-house searches.
Some blacks contend that they
were hit with horsewhips during
the searches.
A reporter who visited the area
said rioting broke out in the
township streets, and angry youths
set up at least 20 burning bar
ricades. The clashes reached a
climax Saturday night, when a
crowd of mixed-race and black
people confronted the police on a
soccer field.
