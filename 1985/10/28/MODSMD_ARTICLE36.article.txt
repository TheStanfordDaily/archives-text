Contract Accepted
DETROIT — Rank-and-file union workers
at Chrysler Corp. voted overwhelmingly to ac
cept a new three-year contract, ending their
costly 12-day nationwide strike, the United
Auto Workers announced late yesterday.
Marc Stepp, a UAW vice president and
leader of the union's Chrysler department,
said unionized production and maintenance
workers ratified the new contract by 87 per
cent to 13 percent. Skilled trades workers,
unionized engineering, office and clerical
employees, and workers at company parts
depots also ratified the contract by similar
margins.
As a result, some of Chrysler's U.S.
workers began returning to work on the mid
night shift yesterday for the first time since
Oct. 15. All of Chrysler's 70,000 union
workers are due to report to work today, a
company spokeswoman said.
The overwhelming vote in favor of the new
U.S. contract had been widely expected,
mainly because the agreement satisfies vir
tually all of the union's major wage and non
wage demands. The company received little in
return, except an end to the walkout, which
had been costing the auto maker about $17
million a day in lost profits.
Chrysler officials say the contract will in
crease the company's labor costs by more than
$1 billion over the next three years. It will
eliminate the labor cost advantage over Gen

eral Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. that
Chrysler has enjoyed since its workers
granted it wage concessions between 1979 and
1981 to keep the company afloat.
Defection Attempt
WASHINGTON — Administration officials
pressed yesterday for access to the seaman
who apparently tried to defect from a Soviet
ship on the Mississippi River near New Or
leans, but they minimized speculation that the
affair will escalate as President Reagan
prepares for a summit meeting with Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
Robert McFarlane, the national security ad
viser to President Reagan, declined during an
interview on the CBS broadcast "Face the Na
tion" to endorse a reporter's suggestion that
the incident could grow into "a major East-
West issue."
"I wouldn't predict that,"McFarlane said. "I
think we have a responsibility to assure that
the wishes of the individual are understood,
and it is within our legal authority to establish
that. Then I would expect the Soviet Union to
understand that it is our authority and our in
terest; then I expect it can be resolved."
At the State Department, meanwhile,
spokesman Pete Martinez said the department
was seeking to interview the still-unidentified
seaman "in a neutral environment" to deter
mine if he wants to return to the Soviet Union.
In two separate attempts, the crewman

jumped overboard and swam ashore Thursday
and Friday from the Soviet freighter Marshal
Konyev as it was moored off New Orleans.
Each time he was returned to the vessel by
U.S. immigration officers who were unable to
understand him.
Satellite May Be OK
EL SEGUNDO — Two record-making at
tempts by two space shuttle crews to rescue a
balky Hughes Communications Co. satellite
earlier this year appeared to have paid off yes
terday when Hughes successfully fired the
main rocket motor aboard the satellite and it
did not explode.
The satellite, known both as Leasat 3 and
Syncom 3, has been drifting around the Earth
since it was released from the space shuttle
last April and failed to start itself up. During
that six-month odyssey, the satellite was
exposed to extremely cold temperatures as it
drifted through the Earth's shadow, and some
Hughes engineers feared that the fuel system
aboard the satellite had been so severely
damaged from the freeze that the rocket would
explode upon ignition.
But in one of the few bits of good news
Hughes has had in recent months, the rocket
appeared to have functioned normally yester
day, sending the satellite on the first leg of a
trip to its permanent position 22,300 miles
above the Earth.
