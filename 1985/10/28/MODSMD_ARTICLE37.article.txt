Lottery Fraud Foiled
SACRAMENTO — Authorities yesterday
arrested two night watchmen who allegedly
stole state lottery computer programs, but of
ficials said that the first $400 million scratch-off
game remained secure.
Lottery Security Chief Lew Ritter said that
Oh Kwon, 23, and Ki Young Sung, 24, both of
Sacramento, were arrested on charges of
stealing a copyrighted word-processing pro
gram used for manuals and operational docu
ments by the lottery and its ticket supplier,
Scientific Games Inc.
Officials said the stolen software program
could have been copied onto other disks and
sold to personal computer owners for $800 to
$1,000 each.
"There is no evidence to conclude that the
integrity of the lottery instant game was com
promised in any way by the theft of these ma

terials," Ritter said at a hastily called press
conference.
Monroe Death Probed
LOS ANGELES — The foreman of the Los
Angeles County grand jury says he will ask for
a special investigator to reopen an inquiry into
the death of actress Marilyn Monroe.
"There is enough evidence to substantiate a
special prosecutor to work with the grand jury
on an investigation," foreman Sam Cordova
said Saturday.
"A full investigation has never been done by
the grand jury," he said. "People have not tes
tified under oath. This should have been done
a long time ago. It should have been done in
1982."
That year, then-District Attorney John Van
de Kamp conducted a probe and concurred

with a police report that Monroe died in
her Brentwood home of a self-inflicted
overdose of barbiturates on Aug. 5, 1962.
Whale Heads Home
PITTSBURG — Gliding slowly past
cornfields and giant oil refineries, an errant
humpback whale swam 12 miles down the
Sacramento River yesterday, driven by a fleet
of about 25 vessels.
For the first time in two weeks, the 40-ton
whale reached water that is about one-sixth
saline — encouraging its rescuers who had
feared it would perish if it remained in fresh
water for too long.
Thousands of people lined the banks of the
river to watch as the whale, increasingly
known as Humphrey, swam past this industrial
city toward San Francisco Bay.
