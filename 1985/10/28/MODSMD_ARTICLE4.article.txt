# Speaker Praises 'Magnificent' Activism
## 
### MARY McDEVITT Staff writer 
Praising and encouraging student activisim, South
African poet and anti-apartheid activist Dennis Brutus
spoke about his prison experience in South Africa and
read some of his work Saturday night in Kresge
Auditorium, receiving a standing ovation from the audi
ence of approximately 260.
'What has happened at Stanford in the recent past is
magnificent. I am delighted to hear of the . . . vigorous
protest at Stanford and I hope to see a great deal
more," Brutus said. "It is only when the students make
it clear that they are serious . . . (that) Stanford (will)
totally divest from South Africa."
Brutus, who led efforts to ban South African athletes
from the Olympic Games and other international sports
events, was shot, banned and imprisoned for political
activities in South Africa in the '60s before seeking
asylum in the United States in 1970.
Many of the ruling whites in South Africa "believe
their system will be held in place because the United
States will hold it in place. ... We have to send them a
different message," he said.

"We have to say that the day for United States'
(support of) apartheid repression is over because the
people of the United States say it is time to stop. That
is a message that must go out from Stanford and from
the United States," he said, receiving loud applause.
In South Africa, "student activists and professors
. . . are being jailed with charges of high treason in an
effort to decapitate the (resistance) movement. But no
less important is the protest that has been sweeping
the United States. And no less important are those sin
gular victories we have achieved," he said.
The declared state of emergency in South Africa is
evidence of the regime's increasing struggle to
survive, Brutus said.
"It seems to me in South Africa today that the pres
sures that are developing there are unparalleled in the
history of the system," he said.
"The pressures now being exerted are so powerful
that if we can sustain (them) we can push that system
to the edge of destruction. I'm not saying we will
destroy it. I'm saying the possibility exists because of
the pressures — internal and external," Brutus said.
Brutus cited the recent decision of Columbia Univer
sity to divest as an important step in "pushing aside all

that masquerade of the Sullivan principles and Uncle
Tomism."
Divestment from U.S. corporations in South Africa
is effective not only in pressuring the regime but also in
encouraging resisters to continue in their struggle,
Brutus said.
"Something which is not fully understood in the
United States and which needs to be better understood
is what gives people the courage to go on in the the
ghettos . . . and in the prisons. It is the belief that
outside there are those who are doing something to as
sist them in their struggle for freedom," Brutus said.
'What gives people that moral strength ... is those
anonymous thousands, whether demonstrating in
Washington or on a campus at Stanford."
In spite of "Reagan's meaningless pressures on
apartheid which he knew would not work," the resis
tance movement is working effectively, according to
Brutus. "We know we will win — we are winning. . . .
The United States has made a significant contribution."
Brutus, winner of the Freedom Writer's Award and
the Kenneth David Kaunda Award of Humanism, holds
a chair in English literature at Swarthmore College. His
publications include "Letters to Martha" and "Stubborn
Hope."
