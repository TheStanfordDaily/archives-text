# Nutrition Makes Food for Thought
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
Eating habits at Stanford are as
individual as the students them
selves.
Meals are a fabulous way to study
the average student performing one
of the most essential processes of
survival.
There are those eaters who
meticulously choose a representa
tive from each food group, carefully
place a predetermined amount of
food on their plates, avoid the
desserts completely and then sit
down to eat their compilations at a
slow, methodical pace.
Then there are those who pile
heap after heap of anything and
everything that will fit precariously
on their plates, oblivious to caloric
intake, nutritional value and the
possible reactions from their taste
buds and stomachs to the food
they are about to consume in a mat
ter of seconds.
Some eat only bread, only des
sert or only salad. Others never eat
red meat or brussel sprouts. The
list goes on. . . .

What Do Students Eat?
"Hamburgers and pizza, even
when we make it," said Lois Ohms,
assistant manager/dietician at Uni
versity Food Service.
Ohms said that 60 percent of the
students eat breakfast on a regular
basis. Popular breakfast munchies
include bagels and cream cheese,
omelettes, pancakes, French toast
and those notorious sugared
cereals. (Where is the "Cap'n,"
anyway?)
What Do Students Despise?
Casserole dishes. Ohms said
food service received so many com
plaints last year about both the egg
plant and egg-and-chili casseroles
that she took them off the menu.
Are You Really What You Eat?
If the answer is yes, University
Food Service and other cooks
throughout campus have a tremen
dous responsibility to ensure that
the student's path to excellence is
in no way inhibited by bad nutrition.
If a student is going to eat poorly,

it will be a personal choice, Ohms
said.
Every food manager is a trained
dietician at University Food Ser
vice, said Kay Gaskin, an adminis
trative assistant for the University.
These managers make sure that
all meals meet the recommended
governmental standards of nutri
tion.
Here's a sample dinner menu: a
red and a white meat are both
available; for example, roast beef
and chicken or country fried steak
and fish is another popular combina
tion, Ohms said.
She added that there are always
a couple of vegetables, whole grain
breads, fruit, lowfat and regular
milk available.
Ohms said University Food Ser
vice analyzes what it prepares for
the student by composing a sample
menu for an average student.
However, it is "up to the students
to make the choices."
"Our responsibility is to offer a
variety of diets," she said. "We
can't offer just the nutritious
foods."
Food service planners also try to
serve what the student wants to

eat, which is not necessarily what is
best for the student to eat, she
said. "They have to learn to eat a
good diet."
What About Snacks?
Food service does not gear its
menu around what students eat
outside of the dining hall, she said.
In other words, "we don't change
or cut out (certain foods) because
75 percent of the students are
eating ice cream ."
Ohms believes, however, that
there is room in a student's diet for
snacking so long as snacks are cho
sen wisely.
She suggested fruit, lowfat milk,
plain popcorn and unsalted peanuts,
but discouraged chips and dough
nuts.
Students don't necessarily heed
this advice. What do they prefer to
snack on?
"Pop Tarts, a lot of sugar, a lot of
Cup o' Noodles," said Mike Banks,
a supervisor at The Store. Chips,
peanuts and candy bars are also
popular items, according to Banks.
"Pizza," Ohms answered bluntly.
Health food items that are
popular include natural cookies and
granola squares, Banks said. The
Corner Pocket always has long
lines for frozen yogurt as well.
Ohms gave a final word of warn
ing to those freshwomen terrified of
gaining the infamous "freshman
10."
Food is much more accessible at
mealtime and during social func
tions than at home. It is also easier
to eat more while cutting down
levels of activity, she concluded.
Regardless of food service's at
tempts to provide a good nutritional
example, there is a dichotomy be
tween what students should eat and
what they do eat.

intake, nutritional value and the
possible reactions from their taste
buds and stomachs to the food
they are about to consume in a mat
ter of seconds.
Some eat only bread, only des
sert or only salad. Others never eat
red meat or brussel sprouts. The
list goes on. . . .

What Do Students Eat?
"Hamburgers and pizza, even
when we make it," said Lois Ohms,
assistant manager/dietician at Uni
versity Food Service.
Ohms said that 60 percent of the
students eat breakfast on a regular
basis. Popular breakfast munchies
include bagels and cream cheese,
omelettes, pancakes, French toast
and those notorious sugared
cereals. (Where is the "Cap'n,"
anyway?)
What Do Students Despise?
Casserole dishes. Ohms said
food service received so many com
plaints last year about both the egg
plant and egg-and-chili casseroles
that she took them off the menu.
Are You Really What You Eat?
If the answer is yes, University
Food Service and other cooks
throughout campus have a tremen
dous responsibility to ensure that
the student's path to excellence is
in no way inhibited by bad nutrition.
If a student is going to eat poorly,

it will be a personal choice, Ohms
said.
Every food manager is a trained
dietician at University Food Ser
vice, said Kay Gaskin, an adminis
trative assistant for the University.
These managers make sure that
all meals meet the recommended
governmental standards of nutri
tion.
Here's a sample dinner menu: a
red and a white meat are both
available; for example, roast beef
and chicken or country fried steak
and fish is another popular combina
tion, Ohms said.
She added that there are always
a couple of vegetables, whole grain
breads, fruit, lowfat and regular
milk available.
Ohms said University Food Ser
vice analyzes what it prepares for
the student by composing a sample
menu for an average student.
However, it is "up to the students
to make the choices."
"Our responsibility is to offer a
variety of diets," she said. "We
can't offer just the nutritious
foods."
Food service planners also try to
serve what the student wants to

eat, which is not necessarily what is
best for the student to eat, she
said. "They have to learn to eat a
good diet."
What About Snacks?
Food service does not gear its
menu around what students eat
outside of the dining hall, she said.
In other words, "we don't change
or cut out (certain foods) because
75 percent of the students are
eating ice cream ."
Ohms believes, however, that
there is room in a student's diet for
snacking so long as snacks are cho
sen wisely.
She suggested fruit, lowfat milk,
plain popcorn and unsalted peanuts,
but discouraged chips and dough
nuts.
Students don't necessarily heed
this advice. What do they prefer to
snack on?
"Pop Tarts, a lot of sugar, a lot of
Cup o' Noodles," said Mike Banks,
a supervisor at The Store. Chips,
peanuts and candy bars are also
popular items, according to Banks.
"Pizza," Ohms answered bluntly.
Health food items that are
popular include natural cookies and
granola squares, Banks said. The
Corner Pocket always has long
lines for frozen yogurt as well.
Ohms gave a final word of warn
ing to those freshwomen terrified of
gaining the infamous "freshman
10."
Food is much more accessible at
mealtime and during social func
tions than at home. It is also easier
to eat more while cutting down
levels of activity, she concluded.
Regardless of food service's at
tempts to provide a good nutritional
example, there is a dichotomy be
tween what students should eat and
what they do eat.
Domino's anyone?
