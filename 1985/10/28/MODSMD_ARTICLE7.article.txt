# Workers Weigh Strike Consequences
## 
### CHARLES SEAVEY Staff writer 
Behind the complex issues in the current negotia
tions between the United Stanford Workers union
(USW) and the University for a new contract are the
union members themselves.
With the slow progress of negotiations and the
Thursday strike deadline, many are considering how
their situations will change in the event of a strike.
Despite the prospect of suffering, most seem willing to
strike for what they consider to be their rights as
workers.
Saul Cardenas, head cook at Wilbur Hall, said
he would be "up the creek" if a strike were to last as
long as a month, as it did in 1982, the last time USW
went on strike.
"I just couldn't take it. I've got a lot of bills that I've
got to pay," Cardenas said. "I've got kids going to
school, 16 and 12 (years old). . . . Last time we went
on strike, my wife was working. They closed down the
plant where she worked for 20 years and so now I will
have nothing to fall back on," Cardenas said.
The cook is not overly concerned about being able to
feed his family in the event of a strike. "Food won't be
a problem, because sometimes you have to tighten
your belt and get away with little. We can go on refried
beans and rice. But with the bills that have to be paid,
I'll get really behind," he said.

For Jesus Maldonado, a co-worker of Cardenas, a
strike would cut off the monthly financial support he
sends to his parents and 10 brothers in Mexico.
"I'm pretty lucky because I've saved a couple
hundred dollars in the bank. Many workers haven't
been able to save; they live day to day. But if we
strike, all my savings will be gone. It's hard, man. It's
very difficult. And it's going to be hard for my family in
Mexico too," Maldonado said.
Lab assistant Anthony Bryant said he could "fall back
on friends and relatives." Bryant, unlike many, has no
dependents. "My situation won't be nearly as bad as
some people," he said, "but it will still be hard. Any
time you lose your salary when you have bills to take
care of and things to do, it's hard. Also, when you're
striking, you're not eligible for medical care, unemploy
ment and other benefits."
Most workers expressed hopes that a strike would
be averted. Nevertheless, they seemed willing to
endure the consequences of a strike.
Bryant offered many reasons to justify a strike: Uni
versity contract proposals are "definitely takeaway
proposals. We're not talking about pay here, but about
whether we'll be represented at all. . . . We're talking
about a very large corporate-type entity that wants to
squeeze every last drop of work out of its workers."
Other workers, although not strongly supportive of
a strike, said they were willing to strike out of respect
for their co-workers.
As one maintenance worker said, "I'm a Christian. I

don't agree with the idea of striking. But I also refuse
to cross a picket line."
Union member Fred Maria said he agreed with the
majority of the causes for which the workers would
strike but added, "It's too late in the year to strike."
Maria said, however, that he refuses to cross picket
lines "no matter who's striking."
Cardenas and Maldonado noted that a Spanish
speaking union representative had talked to them and
informed them of the negotiations and the potential
strike. They said, as did most union members con
tacted by The Daily, that the main issue was job secur
ity and that it is a great injustice for the University to
attempt to take away a long-standing clause, paragraph
94, in the union contract.
"We weren't expecting a big raise or anything like
that," Cardenas said. "With the way things are going
around the country, we aren't fighting for a big raise.
We want to defend a thing (job security) that's ours
already. To take it away, I think it's unfair."
The University has said that it needs the flexibility of
hiring temporary workers in order to accommodate work
load during periods of heavy activity. Therefore, the
purpose of the proposed change in the clause is not to
take away job security. Priscilla Wheeler, chief
negotiator and staff counsel for the University, has also
said that union members would not be replaced with
non-Stanford employees.
Some workers said they felt a sense of duty to their
union predecessors to carry on a strike if necessary.

They said that they want to avoid a new contract that
many union members claim will eventually lead to the
undermining of the union.
As Verbera said, "I have been working here for 27
years. I was one of the persons originally interested in
organizing a union here in the late '60s. They (contract
negotiators) have issues on the table that would erode
our representation and that would weaken our survival
as workers for Stanford.
"The issue, is basically the guarantee of free and
proper representation for workers here on working
conditions, workers rights and civil rights as well.
These are the same reasons why I, in the late '60s,
was very much interested in organizing a union
here. ..."
"Every time we have struck, the workers have been
forced to lay down their economic life and their family's
lifestyle in order to be able to survive Stanford, not
only with a job, but with dignity as well," Verbera said.
Bryant was perhaps most clear in expressing the
feelings of union members. "There are certain things
that are worth fighting for and suffering for," he said.
"If you were to realize that the benefits you have now
are due to the suffering of other people, wouldn't you
be willing to suffer yourself?"
