# How Strike Might Affect Students
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
Should the United Stanford Workers union
(USW) and the University not agree on a con
tract Thursday, students may experience the
impact of a strike, as they did during a month
long USW strike in 1982.
The greatest effect on students would prob
ably be in the area of food service.
In the event of a strike, Wilbur Hall and
Florence Moore will be open for breakfast and
lunch the following Monday, according to Dan
Keaton, manager of University Food Service.
Additional units and places designated for din
ner will be opened as soon as possible, he said.
Additional operations depend both on stu
dent employment and how much food service >
can be scheduled. Keaton said that he will
"consolidate forces" among the various stu
dent hashers throughout campus, adding that
they mentioned a desire not to lose hours.
Meal cards will not be honored during a
strike. Instead, students will receive weekly

cash refunds, the amount of which is deter
mined by the meal plan, according to Kay Gas
kin, administrative assistant for University
Food Service. Students will pay cash for meals
in dorms.
Once a strike ends, meal cards will be
honored at the first following meal scheduled.
If a strike ends in the middle of the week anA
student has already received his refund for
that week, he will be billed for the meals
during the remainder of the week.
If USW does strike on Friday, weekly
refunds will not begin until the following Mon
day. However, students will be reimbursed for
meals missed on Friday and over the
weekend, Gaskin said.
Students who wish to avoid food service
during a strike but don't want to leave campus
s will find Tresidder ready to bear the extra
load. Tresidder will be open from 7 a.m. to
midnight, extending dinner hours until 8 p.m.,
and Encina Station will also remain open for
dinner, according to Nanci Howe, assistant
director of Tresidder.
During lunchtime, there will be a "beefed-up

outside food stand in White Plaza," that will of
fer quick items to go. Extra cashiers and addi
tional staff will also be available to speed up the
predicted long lines, Howe said.
Tresidder will also be "happy to provide
group food in bulk" to those dorms that want
to make a simple dinner, she said. For exam
ple, items such as hamburger meat and rolls
can be easily supplied if a dorm wants to have a
barbeque.
The Coffee House is also preparing for the
additional load by arranging for additional
seating with Tresidder and adding student per
sonnel, according to Sue Tatum, director of
Tresidder Union Food Service.
Domino's Pizza is also gearing up for a pos
sible strike. In 1982 the overload at the Palo
Alto branch was so great that their service fell
under par, according to Randy Wolfe, a
Domino's supervisor.
The Palo Alto Domino's will receive assis
tance from three or four other local branches.
It will bring in trainees from other locations
who will pull double shifts, Wolfe said.
