Sharing. It's a concept that parents teach their
children at an early age.
The concept of sharing was put into use this
weekend during the revival of Parents Weekend on
the Farm after a 15-year absence. Parents
Weekend gave thousands of parents the chance to
share in a slice of their children's lives. It gave them
the opporunity to experience the world of Stanford
first-hand.
For many parents, the weekend made their
children's college world real. The names of
roommates, friends, crushes, professors and RAs
that they had heard about on the phone were given
faces. Places like Mem Chu, Hoo Tow, Mem Aud
were no longer strange code-words, they became
true images. Accounts of the Band, the new inner
Quad, and the Rodin Sculpture Garden were given
validity. And the song "All Right Now" was given
resonance.
But sharing is a two-way thing. Parents were not
the only ones to benefit from the occasion. Cer
tainly, they learned about the environment in which
their children function as college students, the place

to which many of them pay hefty bills. However, the
people they visited, the people that used to be their
children, "but are now your young men and
women," as Prof. Jim Gibbons told them at the
Forum on Stanford, learned equally valuable les
sons.
Sometimes living on the Stanford campus can feel
like living in a "vacuum" — it is rare to see people
who don't belong in the setting. Especially parents.
It is easy to forget about parents on a daily basis.
The parents were a welcome aadidon to the atmos
phere. It was really nice to see them around. It was
nice to introduce them to your friends, to meet your
friend's parents and to have your parents meet
other parents. Parents Weekend made parents real
again, it brought them back into the picture. It pro
vided the impetus for parents and their college
children to relate to each other on new ground.
In all, the weekend was a success. The Daily was
happy to see a well-organized weekend in which
parents en masse were on the Farm, and hopes to
see it continue — especially if parents bring luck to
the football team.
