Workers Aren't
The Only Victims
Administration attorney Priscilla
Wheeler's bargaining tactics can
best be described as coercive. She
demands that the United Stanford
Workers (USW) give up workers'
job security in return for a con
tract. Stanford's employees are put
in the position of either agreeing to
massive takeaways or having to go
on strike to protect our jobs.
There are, however, unintended
victims of Wheeler's tactics. One
victim will be physicist Burton
Richter's dream of re-establishing
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) as the world leader
in high-energy physics research
through the construction of the
Stanford Linear Collider (SLC). A
European accelerator's rise to
prominence over SLAC several
years ago and the recent success
of Chicago's Fermilab make it
imperative that the SLC be com-

pleted on time if Stanford is ever
to regain the lead. If Wheeler
forces the workers to strike to
protect their jobs, construction of
the SLC will grind to a halt.
Ironically, another victim will be
Wheeler's boss — University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy. Kennedy
has aspirations for the Democratic
Senate nomination. His tacit ap
proval of Wheeler's efforts to break
the union last year and again in
1985 will preclude that nomination.
Union-busting is taboo in the Dem
ocratic Party. There is no way the
party will risk alienating California's
two million unionized voters by
nominating a known union-buster.
U,SW and the workers have no
wish to harm Stanford University.
On the contrary, we are proud of
Stanford's greatness and our con
tribution in making it one of the top
institutions in the country. We
want to share in the rewards
generated by Stanford's rise and
not be treated as second-class
citizens.

Thus, Wheeler's hard-line tactics
victimize not only the workers, but
the institution itself. Everyone
loses. And Wheeler herself? What
does she care? She's quitting her
job and departing Stanford soon,
leaving behind a divided community
and a legacy of bitterness.

Violence Not
Always Racist
Prejudice undoubtedly motivates
some actions toward blacks. But it
is not acceptable to claim, as Steve
Phillips did in his column (The
Daily, Oct. 18), that all actions
toward blacks are motivated by
racial intolerance.
The incident involving Edmund
Perry — a Harlem student shot by
police last summer just before
beginning his freshman year at

Stanford — offers a case in point.
It is obvious that Phillips left New
York a little early this past sum
mer. If he had stayed longer, he
would have learned that Perry's
own brother admitted that he and
the "honor student with no criminal
record" did indeed attack the
police officer without provocation.
They mugged a man whom they
thought was a defenseless target
just for kicks. And Perry paid the
price. Was it bias that caused the
police officer, in order to save his
life, to shoot Perry? Perhaps the
officer should have allowed himself
to be beaten to death rather than
be thought of as prejudiced?
Prejudice is indeed a very
serious problem. We must fight it
no matter what form it assumes.
While it is biased to hold blacks
responsible for all of the ills Phillips
speaks of, it is also prejudiced to
assume that, just because some
thing is done to a black, it must be
racially motivated. Phillips must
realize this if he truly hopes to aid

in the fight for a society free from
bias.

Stanford Scholars
We members of the Stanford
faculty would like to register our
disappointment with the distribu
tion of "Stanford and South Africa"
to the Stanford community. Many
people will have read the letter
(The Daily, Oct. 23) signed by a
number of Africanists pointing out
the numerous serious factual er
rors in that document. It is addi
tionally most distressing that this
pool of expertise was not consulted
in its preparation. In his letter
introducing the document, Univer
sity President Kenndy says that
"Stanford's responsibility as an
educational institution is to pro
vide, as best it can, the means for

people to become more
knowledgeable" (our italics). The
sources that Stanford's Office of
Public Affairs has used to meet this
responsibility are "encyclopedias,
almanacs, Stanford historical
records, newspaper stories, maga
zine articles, etc." Occasional
reference to sources, such as
Business Week and Fortune, bear
out this description. No reference
is made to scholarly work or to the
authority of experts on Africa
readily available at Stanford.
If the administration is serious
about informing students on South
African issues, it should hold a
public forum including our own
Africanist and Afro-Americanist
resources at the University. Tlie
funding and publicity for such a
forum should additionally be han
dled through these resource
centers. In educational matters like
these, not employing the re
sources of the faculty can only
discredit the University.
