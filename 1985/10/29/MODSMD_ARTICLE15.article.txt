# Res Ed Isn't Worth a Quarter
## 
### 
The Daily certainly gave Residential Educa
tion the powder puff treatment when it covered
the University's alcohol policy last week (Oct.
21). There is an entirely different perspective on
the matter which was completely lost in the arti
cle.
If Norm "Short Year, Long Year" Robinson,
associate dean of Student Affairs, wants to give
his own kids a hard time, that's all right by me.
But 1 don't like it when he seems bent on giving
fraternities a hard time. If Alice "The Decision
Always Rests With Students" Supton, assistant
dean of Student Affairs, is to be taken seriously,
then Res Ed needs to lay to rest some of its
recent decisions.

Stanford students do not need surrogate par
ents in Old Union. In fact, if there is one common
weakness in Stanford students that stands out
more than any other, it is probably that they
have been too heavily parented.
The issue here is much bigger than parties. It
comes down to the question of whether this is
Stanford University for students or Stanford
University for administrators.
Our society invests in individuals the
prerogative to take risks and, in authority, the
responsibility to protect individuals from one an
other. Res Ed seems to like this protective role,
for it has assumed a good deal of authority when
it comes to policing the social behavior of stu
dents.
Well, I personally am not in favor of investing
too much authority in Res Ed, and I have a
feeling that a large proportion of Stanford stu
dents — who, as investors in this institution
have some rights that demand the respect of the
administration they so munificently support —
don't want Res Ed's shadowy fingers hovering
over them when they go out at night.
Let's take a look at a few examples:
• Res Ed's anti-fraternity posture. A year and a
half ago, the Task Force on Fraternities threat
ened the very existence of these organizations
on campus. Lately, in telling the Interfraternity
Council (IFC), "You police fraternities or else

we'll do it ourselves," Res Ed's guilty-until
proven-innocent doctrine prevails. Res Ed's
overall strategy seems to be one of intimidation.
So what we see now is the weak-spirited IFC,
afraid to stand up to Res Ed, giving out a quota of
probations to assure their "credibility." What is
constructive about these probations? Anything?
Fraternity members view probations as ac
ceptable because they have been rammed down
our throats, not because there is any logic to
them. It is a bad system, and it reflects badly on
both Res Ed and the IFC.
I have one more comment with regard to
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons' statement
that University policy makers "just don't like big
drinking parties." Just stay home.
• The coddling of freshmen. This is a four-class
university, not a three-class university. There is

As far as I'm concerned, a protest is in order. I'm not
just talking about a sit-in. We should form a new
group, People Against Residential Tyranny (PARTY),
to rally against Res Ed's unreasonable positions on
drinking.

no reason to barricade freshman dorms from the
rest of the Stanford community. Are students
being allowed to make the decisions in this case?
• Fliers. The point is not, as Diana "We Have No
Flier Policy" Conklin, assistant dean of Student
Affairs, contends, whether the flier policy
belongs to Res Ed or to its Vichy governing arm,
the IFC. The real issue is that having any such
flier policy is ridiculous. Regulating the advertis
ing of parties in this way is about as clever as
mowing the lawn with a razor blade. I think they
were playing quarters at Res Ed when they
came up with this one.
• Drinking games. This policy is worth substan
tially less than "quarters," and I think that even
"pennies" overstates its value. By the same
reasoning, we could have residential assistants
tuck students into bed at 11 p.m. to make sure
they get enough sleep. Tired students, like

drunk students, are not good at making deci
sions.
What is wrong with alcohol anyway? Obvi
ously, people enjoy drinking. People have been
drinking around the world throughout the ages.
Prohibition has failed both throughout the
country and at Stanford. I think the jury is in —
there is nothing evil about drinking to have a
good time.
I like Res Ed's emphasis on learning in the
dorms and houses. I like it when Res Ed spon
sors programs like the film presentation "The
Times of Harvey Milk" or an appearance of a
professional Mark Twain imitator, both of which
I saw last year and which were excellent. Resi
dential education is a great focus at Stanford, but
in my vision of residential education there is not
room for the sort of petty regulations we've

been seeing from Old Union.
The whole purpose of Res Ed is to serve stu
dents. There are large groups of students on this
campus who are entitled to a little more respect
than they are receiving from the administration.
If Res Ed is indeed going to serve all students, it
needs to embrace some broader values.
As far as I'm concerned, a protest is in order.
I'm not just talking about a sit-in. We should form
a new group, People Against Residential
Tyranny (PARTY), to rally against Res Ed's un
reasonable positions on drinking.
I propose something on the order of streaming
into Old Union and playing quarters at their of
fice. We need to let Res Ed know who's boss.

drinking around the world throughout the ages.
Prohibition has failed both throughout the
country and at Stanford. I think the jury is in —
there is nothing evil about drinking to have a
good time.
I like Res Ed's emphasis on learning in the
dorms and houses. I like it when Res Ed spon
sors programs like the film presentation "The
Times of Harvey Milk" or an appearance of a
professional Mark Twain imitator, both of which
I saw last year and which were excellent. Resi
dential education is a great focus at Stanford, but
in my vision of residential education there is not
room for the sort of petty regulations we've

been seeing from Old Union.
The whole purpose of Res Ed is to serve stu
dents. There are large groups of students on this
campus who are entitled to a little more respect
than they are receiving from the administration.
If Res Ed is indeed going to serve all students, it
needs to embrace some broader values.
As far as I'm concerned, a protest is in order.
I'm not just talking about a sit-in. We should form
a new group, People Against Residential
Tyranny (PARTY), to rally against Res Ed's un
reasonable positions on drinking.
I propose something on the order of streaming
into Old Union and playing quarters at their of
fice. We need to let Res Ed know who's boss.

The Daily certainly gave Residential Educa
tion the powder puff treatment when it covered
the University's alcohol policy last week (Oct.
21). There is an entirely different perspective on
the matter which was completely lost in the arti
cle.
If Norm "Short Year, Long Year" Robinson,
associate dean of Student Affairs, wants to give
his own kids a hard time, that's all right by me.
But 1 don't like it when he seems bent on giving
fraternities a hard time. If Alice "The Decision
Always Rests With Students" Supton, assistant
dean of Student Affairs, is to be taken seriously,
then Res Ed needs to lay to rest some of its
recent decisions.

Stanford students do not need surrogate par
ents in Old Union. In fact, if there is one common
weakness in Stanford students that stands out
more than any other, it is probably that they
have been too heavily parented.
The issue here is much bigger than parties. It
comes down to the question of whether this is
Stanford University for students or Stanford
University for administrators.
Our society invests in individuals the
prerogative to take risks and, in authority, the
responsibility to protect individuals from one an
other. Res Ed seems to like this protective role,
for it has assumed a good deal of authority when
it comes to policing the social behavior of stu
dents.
Well, I personally am not in favor of investing
too much authority in Res Ed, and I have a
feeling that a large proportion of Stanford stu
dents — who, as investors in this institution
have some rights that demand the respect of the
administration they so munificently support —
don't want Res Ed's shadowy fingers hovering
over them when they go out at night.
Let's take a look at a few examples:
• Res Ed's anti-fraternity posture. A year and a
half ago, the Task Force on Fraternities threat
ened the very existence of these organizations
on campus. Lately, in telling the Interfraternity
Council (IFC), "You police fraternities or else

we'll do it ourselves," Res Ed's guilty-until
proven-innocent doctrine prevails. Res Ed's
overall strategy seems to be one of intimidation.
So what we see now is the weak-spirited IFC,
afraid to stand up to Res Ed, giving out a quota of
probations to assure their "credibility." What is
constructive about these probations? Anything?
Fraternity members view probations as ac
ceptable because they have been rammed down
our throats, not because there is any logic to
them. It is a bad system, and it reflects badly on
both Res Ed and the IFC.
I have one more comment with regard to
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons' statement
that University policy makers "just don't like big
drinking parties." Just stay home.
• The coddling of freshmen. This is a four-class
university, not a three-class university. There is

just talking about a sit-in. We should form a new
group, People Against Residential Tyranny (PARTY),

drinking.

no reason to barricade freshman dorms from the
rest of the Stanford community. Are students
being allowed to make the decisions in this case?
• Fliers. The point is not, as Diana "We Have No
Flier Policy" Conklin, assistant dean of Student
Affairs, contends, whether the flier policy
belongs to Res Ed or to its Vichy governing arm,
the IFC. The real issue is that having any such
flier policy is ridiculous. Regulating the advertis
ing of parties in this way is about as clever as
mowing the lawn with a razor blade. I think they
were playing quarters at Res Ed when they
came up with this one.
• Drinking games. This policy is worth substan
tially less than "quarters," and I think that even
"pennies" overstates its value. By the same
reasoning, we could have residential assistants
tuck students into bed at 11 p.m. to make sure
they get enough sleep. Tired students, like

drunk students, are not good at making deci
sions.
