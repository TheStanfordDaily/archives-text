# Final Proposals Offered
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
With the United Stanford Workers
(USW) strike deadline only three days
away, union and University negotiators
yesterday laid their final contract
proposals on the bargaining table.
The University proposal "is a very good
offer," said Priscilla Wheeler, chief
negotiator and staff counsel for the Uni
versity.
The USW bargaining team was less en
thusiastic, predicting that union members
would reject the contract and go on strike
Thursday afternoon.
"I would expect, based on (the Univer
sity's) past position, the membership to
reject that offer," said union chief
negotiator Mary Ann Tenuto.
While the union says the two sides are
very close on economic issues, USW offi

cials take exception to the University's
non-economic proposals, Tenuto said.
"There is no way they can make a good
offer which reduces our job security and
ability to represent our workers," she
said.
Tenuto said that at yesterday's meeting
the union, through federal mediator
Maggie Jacobson, offered to accept the
University's economic proposals if the
University would agree to its proposed
changes in non-economic areas. The Uni
versity refused, Tenuto said.
Wheeler said Jacobson confirmed that
the University had received the union's
final written proposal. That proposal did
not contain Tenuto's offer, Wheeler said.
Meanwhile, University President
Donald Kennedy, speaking yesterday at
Wilbur Hall, commented on the contract
negotiations.
"We are really more anxious to reach a
contract settlement than the USW is,"

Kennedy said.
In regard to the University's final con
tract offer, Kennedy also called it a "good
offer."
When informed of Kennedy's remarks,
Tenuto countered, "I don't think any offer
which replaces union workers with non
union workers is a good offer."
The University's new economic pro
posal, retroactive to Sept. 1, calls for
wage increases of 5 percent in the first
year, 4 percent in the second year and 4.5
percent in the third year of the three-year
contract.
In addition there would be a cost-of
living adjustment in the third year of up to
25 cents per hour if inflation rises faster
than the wage increases. Also, those
workers at the top of their wage leve.
would receive an additional 2.5 percent
wage increase, Wheeler said.
