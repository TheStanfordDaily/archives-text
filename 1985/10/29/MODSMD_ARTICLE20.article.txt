## Reversed Values and the Right To Carpool Prenatally 
### ANDREW McCLUNG Staff writer 
Dear readers, I bid you once again a fond and cheery good morning. The
reason I keep doing this is that, as you may have noticed, my column is
shrinking each week at an alarming rate, and soon I may not be around to
wish you good morning at all. Such shrinkage is of course not my idea at
all, but my editors seem to have developed a chainsaw fetish that they in
sist upon exercising on my florid prose.
And so much for that. On to questions.
Why are the standard maps of the campus counter-oriented, with the north
at the bottom? Turning from an ordinary street map to the campus map or vice
versa, one must figuratively stand on one's head. It seems gratuitously con
fusing. Is there a subtle purpose behind it, to reorient students to reversed
values of the University, or to make leftists into rightists? - Robert Wesson,
senior research fellow, Hoover Institution.
This question, written on very impressive-looking stationary bearing
the motto, "To promote peace," was addressed to the editor of The Daily.
I, the staff flunky, called Bob McCann at University News and Publica
tions. McCann is the guy who sedulously prepares the maps of campus that
show, among other things, all the rare and tremendously expensive places
to park on campus.
McCann, a wonderfully affable fellow, said that the inverted map tradi
tion was just that, a tradition, antiquated and possibly even atavistic. Bob
said he inherited this tradition unwillingly, and has been given neither the
time nor the authority to amend it.
Not that irate persons with minimal ability to perform mental rotations of
abstractions such as maps have refrained from giving him a vociferous
piece of their limited minds. But please understand, McCann himself fails to

prefer the map as it is, yet he doesn't have time to change it and nobody
seems to be able to hire anyone who does.
McCann opines that the original reason for the orientation of the map
was that almost everybody who approached Stanford did so from the Palo
Alto train station, back in the days before either Interstate 280 or San
Francisco International Airport were built. If one is arriving on campus
from Palo Alto, the present configuration of the map is convenient for get
ting oneself oriented.

Nonetheless, times have changed and people now travel around the Bay
Area at a fast enough pace enough to make them want a map oriented
properly relative to the four points of the compass and the United States as
a whole.
My wife is presently with child, and I was wondering, can the three of us
use the carpool lane on 101? What if we are stopped? - Larry Studebaker,
curious graduate student in materials science and engineering.
Larry, given your surname, I'm thrilled to the gills that you asked an
automobile-related question.
Your proposal seems to me fair enough. Unfortunately, those who
responsibly enforce local legal codes do not strictly agree with you. They
want you and your wife to avoid life in the carpool lane (when otherwise
unaccompanied) at least until your baby takes its first noisy breath.
More specifically, the folks in charge of traffic citations for Santa Clara
County are of the opinion that car pooling privileges should be reserved for
those who will go their separate ways once they reach their destination.
Your child currently does not meet this criterion, despite its freedom
from malicious intent.
It is probably safe to assume, however, that when young Studebaker
makes that fateful decision to abandon his loving mother and stride (well,
maybe not stride) boldly into this vale of tears, the law enforcement agents
who would otherwise give chase to your underpopulated auto might lighten
up and escort you to the hospital.
Just like they do on TV.
On the other hand, they might arrest you, not only for violating carpool
lane regulations, but also for speeding, which you might well be doing at
that time.
In such an event, I would advise you to contact Melvin Belli and urge him
to defend flamboyantly your child's right to carpool prenatally.
