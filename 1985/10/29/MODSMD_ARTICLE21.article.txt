# Students With a Broker Do More Than Break Even
## 
### CHRIS LOUGHRIDGE KEN SAWYER Staff writers 
A broker? Come on.
I'm an English major and have
problems balancing my checking ac
count. If you say "stock" to me I
think of cows and pigs. If you ask
me what "bonds" are I'll think you
are a sexual pervert.
No offense, but this financial stuff
is just too yuppyish for me.
Admittedly, all this stock broker
stuff does smack of yuppiedom. A
large number of Stanford students,
however, do have a stock broker
already, and a larger number still

will have one within a year of
graduation.
In fact, it may make a lot of sense
to get one now, while you are still in
school. If you develop a good rela
tionship with a broker now, not only
can he help you manage the small
amount of money you have at this
time, but your broker will be able to
get you started off on the right in
vestment foot once you leave Stan
ford.
In choosing a broker, you should
be aware of a number of things.
Brokers do not all provide the same
services, they do not all charge the
same rates for the same services,
and they are not all equally capable
and efficient in performing those

services.
With over 5,000 stock brokerage
firms registed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, you
have the opportunity to shop
around before opening an account.
While many Stanford students
have seen Merrill Lynch standing "a
breed apart" and not a few have put
down their studies to hear E.F.
Hutton soliloquize, there are many
smaller firms available that offer
most of the same services. There
are also brokers who specialize in
certain products, such as tax shel
ters, government issues and mutual
funds, and some who offer limited
services, such as "discount
brokers" who just execute your buy

and sell orders for stock without
making recommendations as to
which securities you should pur
chase.
"Full-service" brokers will make
recommendations to you based on
your financial situation and financial
goals. If you are interested in
buying stocks, they will make
recommendations based on their
securities research and analysis.
One service that differs widely
among brokers and brokerage
houses is the periodic statement of
account. Many statements provide
only sketchy and confusing informa
tion, while other brokers provide
concise, readable and informative
statements of account. If you are

considering a broker, make sure
you ask to see a typical statement
of account, and judge for yourself
whether it is complete and under
standable.
It is important to remember that
charges for services are by no
means fixed. Each broker provides
certain services free of charge,
others at a fixed or variable price.
Once you have chosen a broker,
you will need to open an accout with
him. Much like opening a bank ac
count, you will be required to es
tablish certain credit assurances in
terms of your ability to pay for any
securities ordered.
You then need to decide what
kind of account you want to open —

a cash, margin or discretionary ac
count. Most brokerages require
students to open cash accounts.
With such an account, you must pay
for all securities purchased at the
time you purchase them.
With a margin account you may
purchase securities on credit or
execute some more complex in
vestment maneuvers.
The third type of account, a
discretionary account, is in most
ways like a cash account but differs
in that it gives the power of attor
ney to a broker to buy and sell se
curities for a customer without re
ceiving the specific approval of the
customer for each transaction.
