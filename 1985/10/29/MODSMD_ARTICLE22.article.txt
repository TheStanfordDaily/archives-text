## Meryl Streep up to Standards in 4 'Plenty' 
### MARK THOMPKINS 
Meryl Streep is widely acknowl
edged as the foremost film actress
of her generation because of her
ability to play complex, multi
faceted characters. Her career thus
far is a record of dynamic, challeng
ing roles, such as "The French
Lieutenant's Woman" and Sophie in
"Sophie's Choice." One of the
reasons why last year's forgettable
"Falling In Love" was so disap
pointing was that Streep played a
mundane role. Not that she didn't
try to make something out of it; she
and her co-star, Robert DeNiro,
gave their best efforts, but even
they couldn't salvage the film's
hopelessly limp script.
Fortunately, Streep's latest film,
"Plenty," gives her a role fully
worthy of her talent. Even better,
the cast of "Plenty" is an unusually
strong one — this is no empty star
vehicle concocted solely for
Streep's benefit. In the film, di
rected by Fred Schepisi and written
by British playwright David Hare
(based on his own acclaimed play),
Streep plays Susan Traherne, an
idealistic Englishwoman who works
in the French Resistance during
World War 11. Susan is exhilirated
by her role in the Resistance, and
once the Nazis are defeated she is
equally exultant at the prospect of a
newer and better post-war world.
But the post-war world fails to
live up to her expectations. It never
even comes close. In the growing
materialism of Britain in the late
'40s, Susan finds herself sur
rounded by fools, hypocrites and
worst of all, pragmatists. Her only
friend is the bohemian girl Alice
Park (Tracey Ullman), who refuses
to bow down to any social conven
tions. Susan has disastrous
relationships with two men: she
first encounters the strait-laced
diplomat Raymond Brock (Charles
Dance), and then becomes involved
with a lower-class worker named

Mick (Sting). As her life falls apart
in the '50s, Susan becomes
obsessed with memories of her life
in the Resistance, particularly with
the memory of the brief time she
spent with another agent (Sam
Neill).
"Plenty" was originaLy a stage
play, but its translation into film is
an extremely graceful one. There
are a few passages of overly
theatrical dialogue, but otherwise
everything is strikingly cinematic.
Director Schepisi makes excellent
use of locations throughout; he has
the eye of a visual stylist.
But Schepisi avoids getting too
fussy with his visuals; to have done
so would have meant overlooking
his true strong point, namely the
group of actors assembled here.
Simply put, there is not a weak bit
of casting in the entire film. Sting
shrugs off his recent debacle in
"The Bride" with his touching
portrayal of Mick, a man completely
bewitched and bewildered by
Susan. It's a fairly small part, but
Sting makes it a memorable one.
Also excellent in small roles are Sir
John Gielgud and lan McKellen.
Gielgud is an old world diplomat
who proves to be much less
laughable th'an Susan originally
guesses. Considered to be Eng
land's finest stage actor with the
exception of Laurence Olivier,
McKellen has a cameo role as an
icily polished member of the
Foreign Office, the only man in the
film capable of stopping Susan dead
in her tracks.
The major players are no less ac
complished. As the Bohemian girl
Alice, Ullman displays a consider
able range. Her character's flam
boyant entrance sparks our interest
in her immediately, and she sus
tains this interest throughout the
film, even as her character
becomes subdued with maturity.
And then there is Dance as
Brock, Susan's eventual husband, a
role which might have been one
dimensional in the hands of a lesser

actor. Brock is in fact the most in
teresting character in the movie.
Writer Hare says of Brock that,
"He is absorbed into society and by
being absorbed, he loses all the
vitality which he has as a young
man." Dance makes this absorption
fascinating: we see Brock go from a
good-humored and open-minded
young man to a bitter older man
who sacrifices his ideals in order to
keep afloat his Foreign Service
career. Thanks to Dance, we sym
pathize with Brock throughout, no
matter how intolerably stuffy the
character becomes; his final out
burst in particular is quite effective.

Susan finds
herself surrounded
by fools, hypocrites
and worst of all,
pragmatists.

It's fortunate that "Plenty" has
such an outstanding cast, for the ac
tors almost make it easy to over
look the problems in the script. The
character of Susan is the most for
midable obstacle. Hare is to be
commended for creating an un
usually complex heroine, but too of
ten Susan seems like a simple
whiner rather than the proud
idealist we're meant to see her as.
Why does a woman with enough
courage to join the Resistance find
nothing altruistic to do after the
war? Susan says she "wants to
change things but doesn't know
how," but the impression we get is
that she never even tries. Instead,
she goes from one ridiculous job to
another, at one point even helping
to film dog food commercials for an
ad agency.
Furthermore, we never learn
anything about Susan's origins, al

though she seems to be upper class.
Ultimately, we do feel for Susan
and admire her vaguely tragic stat
ure, thanks to the eloquence Streep
gives her. But these nagging ques
tions about Susan's character stick
in one's mind long after the movie is
over.
Fortunately, if "Plenty" does not
work perfectly as the study of one
woman's disintegration in a ruthless
and materialistic society, it can be
enjoyed as a comedy of manners.
Hare obviously knows the
decorum of English society inside
and out; here he tears apart the dic
tum of "manners over morals."
Hare is never more biting than in
one dinner party scene, where
Susan tries to upset as many social
rules as possible. The other dinner
guests struggle to keep a stiff upper
lip, but she won't let them. It's
easily the film's best moment.
One other scene, the last one,
deserves special mention. After
depicting Susan's decline and fall in
the late '50s, the film suddenly cuts
back to France in the '40s. The war
has just ended; Susan stands on top
of a hill, in brilliant sunlight, talking
to a farmer. In ecstatic tones, she
tells him that she climbed the hill
"to get a better view." At first the
scene seems heavy-handed. The
music is dreadfully overdone,
Susan's position on the hill seems
too symbolic of her position over
the rest of humanity. But suddenly
the soundtrack dies down, and a
look of uncertainty comes over
Susan's face. This adds an interest
ing note of ambiguity to the entire
film, suggesting that Susan knows
she is doomed from the start.
"Plenty" is a fine film overall,
despite its apparent inconsistencies
and contradictions. Credit is due, of
course, to Streep for her
challenging portrayal of Susan. It is
now a cliche to call Streep brilliant,
gifted and so on; perhaps it will
suffice to say that here she gives a
performance worthy of, well, Meryl
Streep.


In "Plenty," Meryl Streep looks for excitement to rival that which
she found in the French Resistance Movement during World
War 11.

tions. Susan has disastrous
relationships with two men: she
first encounters the strait-laced
diplomat Raymond Brock (Charles
Dance), and then becomes involved
with a lower-class worker named

Mick (Sting). As her life falls apart
in the '50s, Susan becomes
obsessed with memories of her life
in the Resistance, particularly with
the memory of the brief time she
spent with another agent (Sam
Neill).
"Plenty" was originaLy a stage
play, but its translation into film is
an extremely graceful one. There
are a few passages of overly
theatrical dialogue, but otherwise
everything is strikingly cinematic.
Director Schepisi makes excellent
use of locations throughout; he has
the eye of a visual stylist.
But Schepisi avoids getting too
fussy with his visuals; to have done
so would have meant overlooking
his true strong point, namely the
group of actors assembled here.
Simply put, there is not a weak bit
of casting in the entire film. Sting
shrugs off his recent debacle in
"The Bride" with his touching
portrayal of Mick, a man completely
bewitched and bewildered by
Susan. It's a fairly small part, but
Sting makes it a memorable one.
Also excellent in small roles are Sir
John Gielgud and lan McKellen.
Gielgud is an old world diplomat
who proves to be much less
laughable th'an Susan originally
guesses. Considered to be Eng
land's finest stage actor with the
exception of Laurence Olivier,
McKellen has a cameo role as an
icily polished member of the
Foreign Office, the only man in the
film capable of stopping Susan dead
in her tracks.
The major players are no less ac
complished. As the Bohemian girl
Alice, Ullman displays a consider
able range. Her character's flam
boyant entrance sparks our interest
in her immediately, and she sus
tains this interest throughout the
film, even as her character
becomes subdued with maturity.
And then there is Dance as
Brock, Susan's eventual husband, a
role which might have been one
dimensional in the hands of a lesser

actor. Brock is in fact the most in
teresting character in the movie.
Writer Hare says of Brock that,
"He is absorbed into society and by
being absorbed, he loses all the
vitality which he has as a young
man." Dance makes this absorption
fascinating: we see Brock go from a
good-humored and open-minded
young man to a bitter older man
who sacrifices his ideals in order to
keep afloat his Foreign Service
career. Thanks to Dance, we sym
pathize with Brock throughout, no
matter how intolerably stuffy the
character becomes; his final out
burst in particular is quite effective.

Susan finds
herself surrounded
by fools, hypocrites
and worst of all,
pragmatists.

It's fortunate that "Plenty" has
such an outstanding cast, for the ac
tors almost make it easy to over
look the problems in the script. The
character of Susan is the most for
midable obstacle. Hare is to be
commended for creating an un
usually complex heroine, but too of
ten Susan seems like a simple
whiner rather than the proud
idealist we're meant to see her as.
Why does a woman with enough
courage to join the Resistance find
nothing altruistic to do after the
war? Susan says she "wants to
change things but doesn't know
how," but the impression we get is
that she never even tries. Instead,
she goes from one ridiculous job to
another, at one point even helping
to film dog food commercials for an
ad agency.
Furthermore, we never learn
anything about Susan's origins, al

though she seems to be upper class.
Ultimately, we do feel for Susan
and admire her vaguely tragic stat
ure, thanks to the eloquence Streep
gives her. But these nagging ques
tions about Susan's character stick
in one's mind long after the movie is
over.
Fortunately, if "Plenty" does not
work perfectly as the study of one
woman's disintegration in a ruthless
and materialistic society, it can be
enjoyed as a comedy of manners.
Hare obviously knows the
decorum of English society inside
and out; here he tears apart the dic
tum of "manners over morals."
Hare is never more biting than in
one dinner party scene, where
Susan tries to upset as many social
rules as possible. The other dinner
guests struggle to keep a stiff upper
lip, but she won't let them. It's
easily the film's best moment.
One other scene, the last one,
deserves special mention. After
depicting Susan's decline and fall in
the late '50s, the film suddenly cuts
back to France in the '40s. The war
has just ended; Susan stands on top
of a hill, in brilliant sunlight, talking
to a farmer. In ecstatic tones, she
tells him that she climbed the hill
"to get a better view." At first the
scene seems heavy-handed. The
music is dreadfully overdone,
Susan's position on the hill seems
too symbolic of her position over
the rest of humanity. But suddenly
the soundtrack dies down, and a
look of uncertainty comes over
Susan's face. This adds an interest
ing note of ambiguity to the entire
film, suggesting that Susan knows
she is doomed from the start.
"Plenty" is a fine film overall,
despite its apparent inconsistencies
and contradictions. Credit is due, of
course, to Streep for her
challenging portrayal of Susan. It is
now a cliche to call Streep brilliant,
gifted and so on; perhaps it will
suffice to say that here she gives a
performance worthy of, well, Meryl
Streep.


In "Plenty," Meryl Streep looks for excitement to rival that which
she found in the French Resistance Movement during World
War 11.
Meryl Streep is widely acknowl
edged as the foremost film actress
of her generation because of her
ability to play complex, multi
faceted characters. Her career thus
far is a record of dynamic, challeng
ing roles, such as "The French
Lieutenant's Woman" and Sophie in
"Sophie's Choice." One of the
reasons why last year's forgettable
"Falling In Love" was so disap
pointing was that Streep played a
mundane role. Not that she didn't
try to make something out of it; she
and her co-star, Robert DeNiro,
gave their best efforts, but even
they couldn't salvage the film's
hopelessly limp script.
Fortunately, Streep's latest film,
"Plenty," gives her a role fully
worthy of her talent. Even better,
the cast of "Plenty" is an unusually
strong one — this is no empty star
vehicle concocted solely for
Streep's benefit. In the film, di
rected by Fred Schepisi and written
by British playwright David Hare
(based on his own acclaimed play),
Streep plays Susan Traherne, an
idealistic Englishwoman who works
in the French Resistance during
World War 11. Susan is exhilirated
by her role in the Resistance, and
once the Nazis are defeated she is
equally exultant at the prospect of a
newer and better post-war world.
But the post-war world fails to
live up to her expectations. It never
even comes close. In the growing
materialism of Britain in the late
'40s, Susan finds herself sur
rounded by fools, hypocrites and
worst of all, pragmatists. Her only
friend is the bohemian girl Alice
Park (Tracey Ullman), who refuses
to bow down to any social conven
tions. Susan has disastrous
relationships with two men: she
first encounters the strait-laced
diplomat Raymond Brock (Charles
Dance), and then becomes involved
