# Mitchell-Ruff Duo Makes The Perfect Jazz Combo
## 
### GREG CAMENZIND 
"The Dinkelspiel Stomp, Blues
Break, Get Down and Get Out!"
was the opening tune performed
by the Mitchell-Ruff Duo in Dink
elspiel Auditorium Wednesday
Night, and it certainly "stomped,"
"broke" and "got" this dynamic
duo rolling into an evening of
diverse and cultured jazz.
The duo played very tightly,
yet did not hinder each other's in
dividual instincts for expression,
an indication of a unique partner
ship especially afforded to what
was billed to be the oldest contin
uous group in jazz (without per
sonnel changes since 1955). The
rare combination of jazz piano,
bass and French horn provided a
very special interpretation of
some beautiful jazz and blues clas
sics.
"The Dinkespiel" was a very
tasteful blues shuffle arranged by
Dwike Mitchell that consisted of
intermittent hard and soft piano
strolls from Mitchell, supple
mented by Willie Ruffs bass and
French horn.
Characteristic of the duo's pro
gram was the second number,
"Everything Happens to Me,"
composed by Mitchell. It blended
quick runs and dexterous falls
with slow rises and languorous
rolls. Part way through his
partner's tumbling piano solo,
Ruff came in with a soft and
steady build on bass, faithfully in
terjecting and accentuating
Mitchell's play. This piece set the
tone for the rest of the program
— a kind of "study in contrasts"
in which Mitchell's piano would
pitch, jump and jive anxiously to a
peak, only to settle, calmly and
elegantly, into an equally pleasing
rhythm and key maintained in the
slow purposefulness of Ruff's
bass.
The duo played a very balanced
and diverse set throughout the
rest of the performance, with
Ruff switching occasionally be

tween bass and French horn, and
Mitchell constantly dabbling in and
out.
While Mitchell's method and
range of improvisational abilities
were both interesting and mas
terful, Ruff's bass playing was no
mere accompaniment. Ruff was
smooth, he seemed to under
stand the subtleties of the bass,
its role in accentuation and an
ticipation as well as in creating its
own separateness. Ruff really
shined on the numbers when he
played the French horn. In
George Gershwin's "Porgy and
Bess" Pastiche, Ruff began with
an extraordinary solo in which he
sounded the horn off of the piano
strings to create a distant har
monic echo effect, much in the

Gershwin blues tradition and just
right for a lead-in to "Autumn
Leaves."
In "Autumn Leaves," Mitchell
and Ruff demonstrated their ap
preciation of Gershwin's music in
an unusual tempo with Ruffs horn
furnishing a cool soft sensitivity to
contrast the playful swirls of the
piano. The duo then entered into
a "hard-drivin', laid-back swing"
rendition of "Summertime" with
Ruff back on bass. Once again,
the two played with the rhythms
to create a kind of hesitant
boogie. The concert was largely
an exhibition of the beautiful
feelings for music which can be
heard in a 30-year collaboration
between two men who are both
friends and brilliant musicians.
