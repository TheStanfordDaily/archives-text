# Neglected 'Songwriter' Deserves Recognition
## 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
What goes on in the tiny minds of movie marketing
executives? The people at Tri-Star (who brought you
"Rambo") released "Songwriter" on video cassette in
the spring and screened it in the Deep South, but only
now is it getting (very) limited exposure in the major
markets. It has been playing only at the Gateway in
San Francisco, and its rotten distribution pattern may
mean it won't even get to the New Varsity and other
revival theaters. But don't let its bastard status with
Tri-Star put you off. "Songwriter" is a gem of a movie,
smart and cynical, with sly performances from Willie
Nelson, Kris Kristofferson and Rip Torn, and one fire
breathing performance from Lesley Ann Warren.
The story centers around country and western
songwriters and stars, but don't let even that put you
off. C & W music can be simplistic to a fault, but the
lyrics often have a potency that the personal lives of
the stars bring them. There's a reason why some of
our best actresses (Sissy Spacek, Jessica Lange) are
willing to play famous Nashville women; the movies
present these singers' lives (rightly or not) as up-front
and heart-felt, exposed in their best songs. Robert
Altman used this idea with the Ronee Blakely character
in "Nashville," and this is also the premise of
"Songwriter." The central characters in this film are
outlaws in word and deed, and the lyrics of their songs
express their disgust with the multi-million dollar
record industry they're a part of.
Willie Nelson is Doc Jenkins, a popular singer and
songwriter who has entered into a bad contract with
music mogul Rodeo Rocky (Richard Sarafian) and
wants out. Doc is lousy at handling his money and the
women he cares for, but he has all the integrity that
Willie Nelson can give him, which is considerable. Doc
manages his former singing partner and friend, Blackie
Buck, played by Kris Kristofferson in a Burt Reynolds
good oP boy style without the tiredness of Reynolds'
recent performances. These two make a perfect laid
back pair, and they talk amazingly like they sing. In
fact, everyone in this movie talks in the easy cadences
and tricky rhythms of their singer personalities; it's one
of the sublime jokes -of this movie. And director Alan
Rudolph and screenwriter Bud Shrake show us the in
genuity whereby the heroes lead their lives. These
characters form crafty partnerships, and are in tune
with one another's ideas.
Willie Nelson is completely in tune with himself, and
he knows just how much mileage he can get out of his
unaffected naturalness. Here he seems to invent a new
kind of cool before our eyes, an alert cool that's fast
and playful and manipulative all at once. Nelson's given
an ideal character; Doc Jenkins is warm and friendly,
but not too sympathetic. He has a streak of roguish dis
honesty that's almost a reflex, and the filmmakers sug
gest that's what it takes to function as an artist within
the entertainment industry. Nelson looks like he's al
ways known this, and so does Kristofferson. But
Blackie is more content to use his singer idol status to

have fun. He beds his female groupies, and doesn't
mind being cheated because then he can play outlaw
with his merry band of musicians. Doc takes being
swindled much more seriously, because Rocky is steal
ing his songs, his essence.
Nelson and Kristofferson are the most confident
movie team we've had in a long time. They know they
have an audience for their easy camaraderie, and Alan
Rudolph lets them glide through their scenes on the
strength of their own personalities. Rudolph keeps the
proceedings relaxed even as he keeps the pace of the
movie hopping along with fast editing.
As the sleazy promoter Dino, Rip Torn oozes insin
cerity; as it turns out, he's just what Doc and Blackie
need in their dealings with Rocky, and Dino falls in with
these outlaws easily. Richard Sarafian, playing Rocky,
suggests the instinctive villianry of the swindlers in
"Used Cars," and he's never happier than when he's
screwing someone over.
Lesley Ann Warren's more flamboyant role might
stick out if she were any less of an actress, but her
booze-sotten, neurotic Gilda is a comic marvel. Warren
looks like an emotionally wobbly Susan Sarandon, and
she provides a nifty counterpoint to Nelson and Kris
tofferson's smooth assurance. Yet she resists the
temptation to act all over the screen; most of the time
Gilda seems bottled up, pickled in her own hootch.
Only in her concert scenes does she unleash, because
it's clear that the shallow lyrics have true meaning for
Gilda. They fire her up or get her sobbing. We first see
her doing a steamy version of "Great Balls of Fire,"
and later she does the Ramada Inn circuit and drowns
in the misery of every song, her emotions amplified
into the seedy little restaurant/lounges.
Warrens' performance isn't a parody, exactly. It's
more the comic quintessence of the C & W stars other
women play. Gilda's life is totally reflected in her
songs, so it makes perfect sense when she throws her
self at Doc. She feels he's "created" her because he's
ghost-written all the hit songs she sings. And as she
paws him, Nelson manages to be emotionally
manipulative yet likeable at the same time. The actors
make this a great scene.
Rudolph and Shrake show a real appreciation for
their characters, and have an ear for their free-flowing
music and dialogue. When Doc visits his estranged fam
ily his conversation with his wife, Honey (charmingly
played by Milinda Dillon) has the snappy wit of verbal
haiku; you can see why these two got together. And in
Blackie's touring bus, the cross cutting dialogue (which
suggests Altman again) has the ring of authenticity.
These characters should get along, for they belong to
the same world, and they're all outlaws. This film is an
outlaw itself.
"Songwriter" has gotten support from the critics
who've seen it, but it's facing its own Rodeo Rocky in
the form of Tri-Star, and it's getting squashed.
Rudolph had a cult hit with last year's "Choose Me,"
and he deserves one with this movie. But the Rodeo
Rockies of the real entertainment world hold a lot of
power over little films like this, and they're the final ar
biters of taste in this great land.

Tri-Star put you off. "Songwriter" is a gem of a movie,
smart and cynical, with sly performances from Willie
Nelson, Kris Kristofferson and Rip Torn, and one fire
breathing performance from Lesley Ann Warren.
The story centers around country and western
songwriters and stars, but don't let even that put you
off. C & W music can be simplistic to a fault, but the
lyrics often have a potency that the personal lives of
the stars bring them. There's a reason why some of
our best actresses (Sissy Spacek, Jessica Lange) are
willing to play famous Nashville women; the movies
present these singers' lives (rightly or not) as up-front
and heart-felt, exposed in their best songs. Robert
Altman used this idea with the Ronee Blakely character
in "Nashville," and this is also the premise of
"Songwriter." The central characters in this film are
outlaws in word and deed, and the lyrics of their songs
express their disgust with the multi-million dollar
record industry they're a part of.
Willie Nelson is Doc Jenkins, a popular singer and
songwriter who has entered into a bad contract with
music mogul Rodeo Rocky (Richard Sarafian) and
wants out. Doc is lousy at handling his money and the
women he cares for, but he has all the integrity that
Willie Nelson can give him, which is considerable. Doc
manages his former singing partner and friend, Blackie
Buck, played by Kris Kristofferson in a Burt Reynolds
good oP boy style without the tiredness of Reynolds'
recent performances. These two make a perfect laid
back pair, and they talk amazingly like they sing. In
fact, everyone in this movie talks in the easy cadences
and tricky rhythms of their singer personalities; it's one
of the sublime jokes -of this movie. And director Alan
Rudolph and screenwriter Bud Shrake show us the in
genuity whereby the heroes lead their lives. These
characters form crafty partnerships, and are in tune
with one another's ideas.
Willie Nelson is completely in tune with himself, and
he knows just how much mileage he can get out of his
unaffected naturalness. Here he seems to invent a new
kind of cool before our eyes, an alert cool that's fast
and playful and manipulative all at once. Nelson's given
an ideal character; Doc Jenkins is warm and friendly,
but not too sympathetic. He has a streak of roguish dis
honesty that's almost a reflex, and the filmmakers sug
gest that's what it takes to function as an artist within
the entertainment industry. Nelson looks like he's al
ways known this, and so does Kristofferson. But
Blackie is more content to use his singer idol status to

have fun. He beds his female groupies, and doesn't
mind being cheated because then he can play outlaw
with his merry band of musicians. Doc takes being
swindled much more seriously, because Rocky is steal
ing his songs, his essence.
Nelson and Kristofferson are the most confident
movie team we've had in a long time. They know they
have an audience for their easy camaraderie, and Alan
Rudolph lets them glide through their scenes on the
strength of their own personalities. Rudolph keeps the
proceedings relaxed even as he keeps the pace of the
movie hopping along with fast editing.
As the sleazy promoter Dino, Rip Torn oozes insin
cerity; as it turns out, he's just what Doc and Blackie
need in their dealings with Rocky, and Dino falls in with
these outlaws easily. Richard Sarafian, playing Rocky,
suggests the instinctive villianry of the swindlers in
"Used Cars," and he's never happier than when he's
screwing someone over.
Lesley Ann Warren's more flamboyant role might
stick out if she were any less of an actress, but her
booze-sotten, neurotic Gilda is a comic marvel. Warren
looks like an emotionally wobbly Susan Sarandon, and
she provides a nifty counterpoint to Nelson and Kris
tofferson's smooth assurance. Yet she resists the
temptation to act all over the screen; most of the time
Gilda seems bottled up, pickled in her own hootch.
Only in her concert scenes does she unleash, because
it's clear that the shallow lyrics have true meaning for
Gilda. They fire her up or get her sobbing. We first see
her doing a steamy version of "Great Balls of Fire,"
and later she does the Ramada Inn circuit and drowns
in the misery of every song, her emotions amplified
into the seedy little restaurant/lounges.
Warrens' performance isn't a parody, exactly. It's
more the comic quintessence of the C & W stars other
women play. Gilda's life is totally reflected in her
songs, so it makes perfect sense when she throws her
self at Doc. She feels he's "created" her because he's
ghost-written all the hit songs she sings. And as she
paws him, Nelson manages to be emotionally
manipulative yet likeable at the same time. The actors
make this a great scene.
Rudolph and Shrake show a real appreciation for
their characters, and have an ear for their free-flowing
music and dialogue. When Doc visits his estranged fam
ily his conversation with his wife, Honey (charmingly
played by Milinda Dillon) has the snappy wit of verbal
haiku; you can see why these two got together. And in
Blackie's touring bus, the cross cutting dialogue (which
suggests Altman again) has the ring of authenticity.
These characters should get along, for they belong to
the same world, and they're all outlaws. This film is an
outlaw itself.
"Songwriter" has gotten support from the critics
who've seen it, but it's facing its own Rodeo Rocky in
the form of Tri-Star, and it's getting squashed.
Rudolph had a cult hit with last year's "Choose Me,"
and he deserves one with this movie. But the Rodeo
Rockies of the real entertainment world hold a lot of
power over little films like this, and they're the final ar
biters of taste in this great land.
What goes on in the tiny minds of movie marketing
executives? The people at Tri-Star (who brought you
"Rambo") released "Songwriter" on video cassette in
the spring and screened it in the Deep South, but only
now is it getting (very) limited exposure in the major
markets. It has been playing only at the Gateway in
San Francisco, and its rotten distribution pattern may
mean it won't even get to the New Varsity and other
revival theaters. But don't let its bastard status with
Tri-Star put you off. "Songwriter" is a gem of a movie,
smart and cynical, with sly performances from Willie
