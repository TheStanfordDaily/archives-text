## Dominguez wins 2-1 The 						Second Half Is a Letdown for Stanford 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
It takes two halves to win a soc
cer game. This year, the women's
soccer team has been finding that
out the hard way.
After playing an excellent first
half and earning a 1-0 lead, the
Cardinal lost its poise in the second
stanza and fell 2-1 to Cal State-
Dominguez Hills.
The Stanford squad has had a
problem with maintaining its inten
sity in the second half lately. And
yesterday's contest was no excep
tion.
"I don't know where to pinpoint
it. We just let down a little bit,"
senior Stanford defender Carol
Berryman said.
As soon as the opening whistle
blew, the Cardinal came out fight
ing. Spearheaded by juinor Stacey
Keare, Stanford's front line and
midfield were constantly putting
pressure on the Dominguez Hills'
defense.
But it wasn't one-sided. Domin
guez Hills countered with a danger
ous combination of fast forwards
and physical defenders. As the
game wore on, the play became
rougher and rougher.
"We're a fairly physical team
when we have to be, and today we
had to be," Dominguez coach
Marine Cano said.
The teams traded blows through
out the first half. One would attack,
then the other. The Cardinal
seemed to be outplaying Domin
guez, but it didn't show up on the

scoreboard until the game's 33rd
minute.
Stanford forced the ball into the
Dominguez Hills' penalty box,
where a Dominguez defender
touched the ball with her hand. The
Cardinal was awarded a penalty
kick and Berryman was summoned
from her defensive position to take
the shot.
She looked to the left and tapped
the ball right. It slid past Domin
guez goalkeeper Sandra Powers
and squeezed into the right hand
corner of the goal.
Berryman's goal, her fourth of
the season, set the score at 1-0,
where it stayed until intermission.
After the break, it was a different
ballgame entirely. The Cardinal was
playing defense and Dominguez
Hills was trying to score. Domin
guez was hustling all over the field.
Stanford wasn't.
"They didn't always have con
trol, but they were always there,"
Berryman said.
Cano essentially agreed."We
won this one on heart more than
skill," he said.
The Cardinal defense played with
heart as well, but Dominguez was
getting too many chances. In the
first 20 minutes of the second half,
Stanford goalkeeper Helen Norton
registered five superlative saves,
but Dominguez Hills just kept com
ing.
Twenty-one minutes into the
half, the inevitable happened.
Dominguez scored. Dominguez for
ward Michele Salas came flying
toward the Stanford goal. Norton
blocked her way and went straight
for the ball. She managed to get the

ball, but the referee decided that
she also got too much of Salas and
gave Dominguez a penalty kick.
"I wasn't trying to pull her down.
I went for the ball. If there were
more people around, he probably
wouldn't have called it, but it was a
reasonable call," Norton said.
Salas took the shot and her
revenge on Norton by rocketing the
ball into the corner of the Cardinal
net. The score was now 1-1 and the
tide seemed to be turning toward
Dominguez Hills.
And turn it did. Stanford was still
unable to come up with any offense
and Dominguez was brimming with
confidence.
Eleven minutes later Salas broke
away down the right-hand side of
the field. As she passed the Domin
guez bench, her teammates, sens
ing the victory, began to cheer.
Salas whipped back her leg and
sent a high-arching shot toward the
mouth of the Cardinal goal. The
shot was perfectly placed. It flew
by Norton and landed in the corner
of the net.
Stanford revived a little bit and
tried in vain to score. When the final
buzzer sounded, the count
remained 2-1 in favor of Domin
guez.
The loss was the latest in a string
of disapointing setbacks for Stan
ford and it left the team and
women's soccer Coach Helen
Keohane wondering what they will
have to do to change their fortunes.
They'll only have a day to solve that
dilemma as Stanford will face
Sonoma State tomorrow at 3 p.m.
on Maloney Field.
