# Golf Is Rough After Day 1
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Both the Stanford men's and
women's golf teams got off to
rough starts in the first round of
their respective tournaments
yesterday. The men's team,
playing in the 54-hole Robertson
Homes Intercollegiate in Stock
ton, was in ninth place after 36
holes, while the women found
themselves in eighth place at the
54-hole Western Intercollegiate
in Rancho Murieta.
The men, who Saturday won
the Stanford Fall Intercollegiate,
shot 590 on the par-71 course at
the Stockton Country Club to
trail the first place team, Arizona
State by 24 strokes with one
round left to play. Golf Coach
Tim Schaaf tried to find some
consolation in their performance.
"They played pretty ragged
today," Schaaf said. "They
played horrendous in the morn
ing but came back to play pretty
well in the afternoon."
"We are only eight shots out of

third place," he said. "If we play
well tomorrow we can challenge
for third."
Carl Wagner, who neared the
Stanford course record with a 66
Saturday, led the Cardinal with a
two-round total of 143. Don Wal
worth shot 146, and freshman
Brad Geer shot 148.
Rich Bietz led Arizona State's
surge to the top with a four
under-par 138. Paul Moller of
second-place Weber State was
second at 139, and Missouri's
Brad Dixon was third at 141.
San Jose State's women shot
303 for the first round on the
par-72, 6,100-yard Rancho
Murieta Golf Course to lead
Duke by five strokes and Texas
A&M and Hawaii by six.
SJSU's Lisa Ipkendanz and
Duke's Jean Bartholemew were
tied for the individual lead at 74.
Stanford's top golfer was Clare
Dolan with a 77, which placed
her in a tie for 10th.
The women play through to
morrow, while the men conclude
their tournament with 18 holes
today.
