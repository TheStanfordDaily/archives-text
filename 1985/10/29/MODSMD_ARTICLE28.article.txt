# Arizona Game Just in Time For Stanford
## 
### 
The victory may have been two days earlier, but Stanford football Coach
Jack Elway was still smiling as he spoke at his weekly press conference
yesterday.
"I think it was a matchup of how well our offense could do against an out
standing defense and how long our defense could go without giving up the
big play. Defensively, that didn't happen," he said of Saturday's 28-17 win
over the University of Arizona Wildcats that broke a five-game losing
streak.
Elway has a theory on football games that says there are three parts to
every game — the offense, the defense and the special teams. If you win
two of those, you win the game.
Saturday, Stanford won all three. And, sure enough, that outcome was
reflected on the scoreboard.
The offense had been missing two ingredients the past few games — a
line and a running game. Somewhat important areas, one might argue. Sat
urday, the line put a solid game behind it, and the Cardinal ran the ball 46
times for 116 yards. Not a record-breaking yardage total, but the mere act
of running that often took much pressure off the line.

Pass protection had been non-existent the week before at USC, and
quarterback John Paye paid for that with a separated shoulder. Against
Arizona, starter Fred Buckley was sacked once. Paye wasn't at all.
With the added time, the two combined to go 22-of-26 for 239 yards, an
average of almost 11 yards per completion. Two weeks ago, that figure
was less than six yards.
"Offensive line-wise, we were more aggressive," Elway said. "We also
had a unit together for a week," he added, referring to the return of Tom
Nye and Jeff Marchin to the lineup after missing a couple games with injur
ies.
As any back will tell you, the line also determines the success of the
rushing game. Ohio State's Keith Byars could rush for 116 yards in the
first half, and Stanford's 2.5-yard average per rush isn't something that is
played up in the press releases, but that wasn't the important thing.
The Cardinal took the old maxim that you use the run to set up the pass
and provided a textbook example. "We were determined that we would
have a two-dimensional situation with the run and the pass," Elway said.
"We stayed with two backs and kept banging away with the running game."
The other consideration is that fullback Brad Muster didn't play a down
Saturday. Still sidelined with a bruised sternum, Muster was expected to
carry the load in the Stanford ground game. Kevin Scott, Thomas Henley
and, especially, Brian Morris picked up the slack, but Muster's return can
only improve things.
An interesting sidelight: Last year, Morris was in the starting fullback
job when the season opened, and Muster was barely on the depth chart.
Muster finally got his chance after Morris was injured. Now, Morris is get
ting his chance because of an injury to Muster.
And the defense didn't give up the big play. Even when it had played
well, the defense was still giving up two or three long touchdowns, and
that made winning impossible. A few changes were made — tackle Tony
Leiker and safety Sam Sutherland moved into starting roles — and corner
back Walt Harris returned from a dislocated elbow.
