# Research Monies Increase

The amount of money awarded to Stan
ford for scientific research has increased
$20 million this year, a trend University
officials say traces directly to the reputa
tion and caliber of the faculty here.
With the exception of Stanford Medical
School, the latest figures show a 20 per
cent leap over fiscal year 1984 in research
awards to the University. The award rate
last month alone was "fabulous, with big
gains for everyone," according to Fred
Bentley, associate director of sponsored
projects.
Rick Biedenweg, assistant provost in
the Office of Management and Budget,
cautioned against exaggerating the impor
tance of the leap in awards, saying it is ne

cessary to distinguish whether the awards
are single- or multiple-year.
He said the predominance of the former
in 1984 partly accounts for the rise in total
federal awards from $171 million to
$186.1 million in fiscal 1985, a rate of in
crease held down by an 8 percent drop in
the medical school awards. Excluding the
medical school, awards rose from $105
million to $125.7 million.
Medical school awards rebounded in
September, when a conflict between the
Reagan Administration and Congress over
the size of the budget for the National In
stitutes of Health (NIH) was resolved.
"Finally, Congress won out, so the NIH
had a large budget and there was a rush
for them to dole it all out," Bentley said.
With $10.5 million in federal funding, the
medical school accounted for more than
half of the federal awards in September.
The September figures were skewed

because it was the last month of the gov
ernment's fiscal year, according to
Bentley. "I can't imagine this rate will be
sustained," he said.
The rate of growth for the University's
awards and expenditures has been faster
than that of inflation in sponsored re
search. Federal funding has now reached
"the same relative level" it had before
Stanford banned classified research on
campus in 1969, Biedenweg said.
Since the mid-19705, Stanford has con
sistently increased expenditures for
federally sponsored research at a rate of 1
to 3 percent above inflation, according to
Biedenweg.
A plateau in federal sponsorship
reached in the early '80s resulted from
government belt-tightening efforts, but
"1984 looked good, 1985 looks better"
