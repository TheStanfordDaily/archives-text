# Research Monies Increase
## 
### LYNN MARCUS Senior staff writer 
The amount of money awarded to Stan
ford for scientific research has increased
$20 million this year, a trend University
officials say traces directly to the reputa
tion and caliber of the faculty here.
With the exception of Stanford Medical
School, the latest figures show a 20 per
cent leap over fiscal year 1984 in research
awards to the University. The award rate
last month alone was "fabulous, with big
gains for everyone," according to Fred
Bentley, associate director of sponsored
projects.
Rick Biedenweg, assistant provost in
the Office of Management and Budget,
cautioned against exaggerating the impor
tance of the leap in awards, saying it is ne

cessary to distinguish whether the awards
are single- or multiple-year.
He said the predominance of the former
in 1984 partly accounts for the rise in total
federal awards from $171 million to
$186.1 million in fiscal 1985, a rate of in
crease held down by an 8 percent drop in
the medical school awards. Excluding the
medical school, awards rose from $105
million to $125.7 million.
Medical school awards rebounded in
September, when a conflict between the
Reagan Administration and Congress over
the size of the budget for the National In
stitutes of Health (NIH) was resolved.
"Finally, Congress won out, so the NIH
had a large budget and there was a rush
for them to dole it all out," Bentley said.
With $10.5 million in federal funding, the
medical school accounted for more than
half of the federal awards in September.
The September figures were skewed

because it was the last month of the gov
ernment's fiscal year, according to
Bentley. "I can't imagine this rate will be
sustained," he said.
The rate of growth for the University's
awards and expenditures has been faster
than that of inflation in sponsored re
search. Federal funding has now reached
"the same relative level" it had before
Stanford banned classified research on
campus in 1969, Biedenweg said.
Since the mid-19705, Stanford has con
sistently increased expenditures for
federally sponsored research at a rate of 1
to 3 percent above inflation, according to
Biedenweg.
A plateau in federal sponsorship
reached in the early '80s resulted from
government belt-tightening efforts, but
"1984 looked good, 1985 looks better"
and "we're looking for real growth
in the near future," said Frank
Riddle, associate controller.
Figures for expenditures for
sponsored research have not yet
been tabulated, "but I know they're
up about 12 percent," over figures
for fiscal 1984, Riddle said.
Compared with an approximately
7.5 percent forecasted inflation rate
based on growth rates of faculty
salaries, material and energy costs
and other research com
ponents, real growth will equal
about 4.5 percent for the current
fiscal year, he said.
The federal sector pays for ap
proximately 85 percent of the Uni
versity's research, according to
Bentley.
Bentley, Biedenweg and Riddle
attributed the current and expected
future growth to several factors:
• The strong reputation and quality
of the Stanford faculty and the re
search proposals they submit.
Stanford's "proposals tend to be
ranked higher than others" through
a system of peer review in the
federal establishment, Biedenweg
said. "This tends to make us
immune to budget cuts," he said.
Many other institutions "are seeing
a flattening in the level of research
funding," Riddle said.
• Several very large awards and
other large outstanding proposals.
One of the largest is a project
connected with the Stanford
Synchotron Radiation Laboratory
(SSRL), located at the site of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter. SSRL uses X-rays to find the

basic molecular structures of ma
terials. Currently in its second
year, the multi-year project covers
facility improvements and research
expenses. First funded by the Na
tional Science Foundation, the $30
million project is now sponsored by
the Department of Energy.
Another large project is the
"Gyroscope project," proposed by
Francis Everitt, research professor
at Hansen Laboratory, and funded
by the National Aeronatics and
Space Administration (NASA).
Everitt plans to send an apparatus
with a NASA space shuttle in late
1989 to test Einstein's theory of
relativity. Stanford researchers will
receive between $60 and $70 mil
lion for the five-year project, and
much of the work is to be sub
contracted to Lockheed Missiles
and Space Company, according to
Riddle.
Proposals submitted in fiscal
1985 rose by more than $40 million
over the previous year, an increase
of 14 percent. Proposals for the Na
tional Science Foundation (NSF)
are up 68 percent, largely because
of four large proposals totaling $80
million for engineering research
centers, according to Biedenweg.
The NSF plans to fund approxi
mately 10 centers around the
country at $20 million each over a
five-year period to research topics
such as robotics and artificial intelli
gence.
Bentley said he expects to see
the effects of several large out
standing proposals for research on
the Reagan Administration's Strate
gic Defense Initiative in the near
future.
A part of the University's Cen
tennial Campaign, a $483 million

fund-raising project for academic
and physical improvements over
the next 10 years will allow Stan
ford to accommodate additional in
creases in research activity. The
$150 million Near West Campus
project, which involves both the
renovation of old buildings and the
construction of new buildings, will
double the amount of space cur
rently available there for research
to 800,000 square feet, according
to Biedenweg.
"In the long run, we're looking
for a 1 percent real growth of the
research budget," Riddle said.
"We're always attempting to get
a larger share of the pie," said
Bentley, adding that the size of the
pie is growing as well.
• Increase in government sponsor
ship of research in recent years.
"Ronald Reagan has been very
friendly to sponsored research,"
Biedenweg said.
The Administration did lower
funding from the NIH through an
Office of Management and Budget
directive issued in December 1984.
The directive set a limit of 5,000
grants for fiscal 1985 and left con
gressionally approved funding for a
remaining 1,500 grants to be dis
tributed over the next few years.
But David Mendelow, associate
dean of the medical school, said that
although some of the effects of the
cuts may remain to be seen, "I can't
say that we've been significantly af
fected by the decrease in NIH fund
ing on an aggregate level." He
added that some individual projects
probably were affected.
Mendelow attributed the lack of
impact to the medical school's
"large group of stars (who) com
pete exceptionally well."

Stanford's "proposals tend to be
ranked higher than others" through
a system of peer review in the
federal establishment, Biedenweg
said. "This tends to make us
immune to budget cuts," he said.
Many other institutions "are seeing
a flattening in the level of research
funding," Riddle said.
• Several very large awards and
other large outstanding proposals.
One of the largest is a project
connected with the Stanford
Synchotron Radiation Laboratory
(SSRL), located at the site of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter. SSRL uses X-rays to find the

basic molecular structures of ma
terials. Currently in its second
year, the multi-year project covers
facility improvements and research
expenses. First funded by the Na
tional Science Foundation, the $30
million project is now sponsored by
the Department of Energy.
Another large project is the
"Gyroscope project," proposed by
Francis Everitt, research professor
at Hansen Laboratory, and funded
by the National Aeronatics and
Space Administration (NASA).
Everitt plans to send an apparatus
with a NASA space shuttle in late
1989 to test Einstein's theory of
relativity. Stanford researchers will
receive between $60 and $70 mil
lion for the five-year project, and
much of the work is to be sub
contracted to Lockheed Missiles
and Space Company, according to
Riddle.
Proposals submitted in fiscal
1985 rose by more than $40 million
over the previous year, an increase
of 14 percent. Proposals for the Na
tional Science Foundation (NSF)
are up 68 percent, largely because
of four large proposals totaling $80
million for engineering research
centers, according to Biedenweg.
The NSF plans to fund approxi
mately 10 centers around the
country at $20 million each over a
five-year period to research topics
such as robotics and artificial intelli
gence.
Bentley said he expects to see
the effects of several large out
standing proposals for research on
the Reagan Administration's Strate
gic Defense Initiative in the near
future.
A part of the University's Cen
tennial Campaign, a $483 million

fund-raising project for academic
and physical improvements over
the next 10 years will allow Stan
ford to accommodate additional in
creases in research activity. The
$150 million Near West Campus
project, which involves both the
renovation of old buildings and the
construction of new buildings, will
double the amount of space cur
rently available there for research
to 800,000 square feet, according
to Biedenweg.
"In the long run, we're looking
for a 1 percent real growth of the
research budget," Riddle said.
"We're always attempting to get
a larger share of the pie," said
Bentley, adding that the size of the
pie is growing as well.
• Increase in government sponsor
ship of research in recent years.
"Ronald Reagan has been very
friendly to sponsored research,"
Biedenweg said.
The Administration did lower
funding from the NIH through an
Office of Management and Budget
directive issued in December 1984.
The directive set a limit of 5,000
grants for fiscal 1985 and left con
gressionally approved funding for a
remaining 1,500 grants to be dis
tributed over the next few years.
But David Mendelow, associate
dean of the medical school, said that
although some of the effects of the
cuts may remain to be seen, "I can't
say that we've been significantly af
fected by the decrease in NIH fund
ing on an aggregate level." He
added that some individual projects
probably were affected.
Mendelow attributed the lack of
impact to the medical school's
"large group of stars (who) com
pete exceptionally well."
The amount of money awarded to Stan
ford for scientific research has increased
$20 million this year, a trend University
officials say traces directly to the reputa
tion and caliber of the faculty here.
With the exception of Stanford Medical
School, the latest figures show a 20 per
cent leap over fiscal year 1984 in research
awards to the University. The award rate
last month alone was "fabulous, with big
gains for everyone," according to Fred
Bentley, associate director of sponsored
projects.
Rick Biedenweg, assistant provost in
the Office of Management and Budget,
cautioned against exaggerating the impor
tance of the leap in awards, saying it is ne

cessary to distinguish whether the awards
are single- or multiple-year.
He said the predominance of the former
in 1984 partly accounts for the rise in total
federal awards from $171 million to
$186.1 million in fiscal 1985, a rate of in
crease held down by an 8 percent drop in
the medical school awards. Excluding the
medical school, awards rose from $105
million to $125.7 million.
Medical school awards rebounded in
September, when a conflict between the
Reagan Administration and Congress over
the size of the budget for the National In
stitutes of Health (NIH) was resolved.
"Finally, Congress won out, so the NIH
had a large budget and there was a rush
for them to dole it all out," Bentley said.
With $10.5 million in federal funding, the
medical school accounted for more than
half of the federal awards in September.
The September figures were skewed

because it was the last month of the gov
ernment's fiscal year, according to
Bentley. "I can't imagine this rate will be
sustained," he said.
The rate of growth for the University's
awards and expenditures has been faster
than that of inflation in sponsored re
search. Federal funding has now reached
"the same relative level" it had before
Stanford banned classified research on
campus in 1969, Biedenweg said.
Since the mid-19705, Stanford has con
sistently increased expenditures for
federally sponsored research at a rate of 1
to 3 percent above inflation, according to
Biedenweg.
A plateau in federal sponsorship
reached in the early '80s resulted from
government belt-tightening efforts, but
"1984 looked good, 1985 looks better"
and "we're looking for real growth
in the near future," said Frank
Riddle, associate controller.
Figures for expenditures for
sponsored research have not yet
been tabulated, "but I know they're
up about 12 percent," over figures
for fiscal 1984, Riddle said.
Compared with an approximately
7.5 percent forecasted inflation rate
based on growth rates of faculty
salaries, material and energy costs
and other research com
ponents, real growth will equal
about 4.5 percent for the current
fiscal year, he said.
The federal sector pays for ap
proximately 85 percent of the Uni
versity's research, according to
Bentley.
Bentley, Biedenweg and Riddle
attributed the current and expected
future growth to several factors:
• The strong reputation and quality
of the Stanford faculty and the re
search proposals they submit.
Stanford's "proposals tend to be
ranked higher than others" through
a system of peer review in the
federal establishment, Biedenweg
said. "This tends to make us
