# K.C. Has a Royal Party
## 
### 
KANSAS CITY (AP) — About 300,000
baseball fans lined downtown streets, hung out
of windows or perched in treetops to greet the
world champion Kansas City Royals yesterday
as the city threw a two-hour ticker tape parade
that littered the town with a snowstorm of con
fetti.
The downtown area remained jammed with
traffic following the parade and accompanying
rally as a steady procession of cars decorated
with streamers, balloons and bows sounded their
horns in celebration of the city's first World Se
ries victory ever.
Players, team officials and others rode the
two-mile route along Grand Avenue to Liberty
Memorial, beaming and waving as 40,000 pounds
of shredded paper drifted from downtown office
buildings.
Fans along the route, still celebrating Sun
day's 11-0 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals in
Game 7, skipped school or were given an ex
tended lunch hour to take part in the hoopla.
They hoisted themselves on bus stop shelters,
bill boards, light poles and others' shoulders to
catch a glimpse of the new champs.
'Who wants to work when you can be here?"
said Duff James, a Kansas City native. "This is
the greatest day in history for Kansas City. I
own my own business, so I can do whatever I
want. And today, I want to be a little boy."
Nearly every fan wore blue, and some

sprayed their hair or painted their faces the royal
color. Many fans tied blue ribbons in their hair.
Fifteen arches of blue and white helium-filled
balloons were draped across the parade route,
while blue and white crepe paper streamers flut
tered from storefront windows, building orna
ments, fire hydrants and even fans who had
turned them into armbands or headbands.
The mood was different in St. Louis, where
the Cardinals returned home unceremoniously
as airport festivities and a ticker tape parade
were called off. A few die-hard fans who showed
up at the airport anyway found a stand set up on
a designated parking lot vacant and the gate
locked.
The seventh game of the 1985 World Series
was a bizarre ending to a baseball tournament
that may well have left unanswered most of the
questions it posed.
How, for example, could the Royals, with a
team ERA of 3.49 during the season, hold the
Cardinals to 1.86 runs per game after they had
averaged 4.61?
How did the Royals, a team that had acknowl
edged its own problem scoring, wind up with 28
runs while getting only one RBI from their No. 3
hitter, George Brett, and playing without desig
nated hitter Hal Mcßae?
What happened to the bats of the Cardinals,
who hit a National League-leading .264 during
the season, but set a record for seven games by

batting only . 185 in the World Series?
Even without Vince Coleman, where was all
the rest of that St. Louis speed? How could a
team that stole 314 bases in 162 games of the
season suddenly manage only two stolen bases
in the World Series?
And, finally, are the Royals, who staged
baseball's most stunning postseason comeback*
really the best team in baseball?
Despite rallying from 0-2 and 1-3 deficits in
both the American League playoffs and the
World Series, the record of the Royals would
suggest they were not baseball's best team.
They finished the season with a one-game ad
vantage over the California Angels in the Ameri
can League West. But their record of 91-71 was
only the sixth best in baseball behind the Cards
(101-61), Toronto Blue Jays (99-62), New York
Mets (98-64), New York Yankees (97-64) and
Los Angeles Dodgers (95-67).
"I'm not convinced they were a better team,"
Cardinals pitcher John Tudor said. "For this
seven games they were. They played better and
they deserved it."
That the Royals deserved to win the World
Series is the only unquestionable thing to arise
from the best-of-seven series. They outplayed
St. Louis in every aspect of the game. The final
11-0 blowout Sunday night represented, in one
game, everything the Royals did right in the Se
ries, and everything the Cardinals did wrong.

How, for example, could the Royals, with a
team ERA of 3.49 during the season, hold the
Cardinals to 1.86 runs per game after they had
averaged 4.61?
How did the Royals, a team that had acknowl
edged its own problem scoring, wind up with 28
runs while getting only one RBI from their No. 3
hitter, George Brett, and playing without desig
nated hitter Hal Mcßae?
What happened to the bats of the Cardinals,
who hit a National League-leading .264 during
the season, but set a record for seven games by

batting only . 185 in the World Series?
Even without Vince Coleman, where was all
the rest of that St. Louis speed? How could a
team that stole 314 bases in 162 games of the
season suddenly manage only two stolen bases
in the World Series?
And, finally, are the Royals, who staged
baseball's most stunning postseason comeback*
really the best team in baseball?
Despite rallying from 0-2 and 1-3 deficits in
both the American League playoffs and the
World Series, the record of the Royals would
suggest they were not baseball's best team.
They finished the season with a one-game ad
vantage over the California Angels in the Ameri
can League West. But their record of 91-71 was
only the sixth best in baseball behind the Cards
(101-61), Toronto Blue Jays (99-62), New York
Mets (98-64), New York Yankees (97-64) and
Los Angeles Dodgers (95-67).
"I'm not convinced they were a better team,"
Cardinals pitcher John Tudor said. "For this
seven games they were. They played better and
they deserved it."
That the Royals deserved to win the World
Series is the only unquestionable thing to arise
from the best-of-seven series. They outplayed
St. Louis in every aspect of the game. The final
11-0 blowout Sunday night represented, in one
game, everything the Royals did right in the Se
ries, and everything the Cardinals did wrong.
