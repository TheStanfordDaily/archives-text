Sakharov's Wife May Be Freed
MOSCOW — A Soviet journalist said today reports that the wife of
dissident physicist Andrei Sakharov will be allowed to go to the West
for medical care are true, and that the United States is a probable
destination.
The West German newspaper Bild, quoting reliable sources in
Moscow, reported yesterday that Yelena Bonner had been told by
Soviet authorities she could "fly immediately to wherever she
wants."
Victor Louis, a Soviet journalist who in the past has provided infor
mation to Western journalists that has proved accurate, said of the
Bild report:
"That is what I understand. As far as I am concerned it is authen
tic, that she will be allowed to go, that it will not be a one-way ticket,
that it is up to her when and where."
Bonner reportedly suffers from a serious eye ailment, and has
sought the right to receive treatment in the West.
Asked if he knew what her destination might be, Louis said, "she
has been in Italy before, and now she has relatives in the States, so it
is up to her. Maybe she will want medical care in the United States."
He said he was sure Bonner's daughter, Tatiana Yankelevich, who
now lives in Newton, Mass., would most likely receive information
about Bonner any day.
"I think it will then be common knowledge," Louis said.
Marcos To Implement Reforms
MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos has agreed
to implement at least four reforms demanded by the United States,
including permission for modernization of U.S. military facilities in
the Philippines, it was reported yesterday.
Quoting unnamed government sources, the economic daily Busi
ness Day said that Marcos made four "commitments" to stabilize the
country's political and economic climate following the recent visit of
Sen. Paul Laxalt (R.-Nev.)
The "commitments" included allowing U.S. observers to monitor
local polls and presidential elections in 1987, introducing reforms in
the military, allowing the United States to modernize Clark Air Base
and the Subic Bay Naval Base and allowing more Americans and
other foreign news agencies to observe and report on the
Philippines.
Business Day said that Marcos and Laxalt had expressed opposing
views with regard to Gen. Fabian Ver, the armed forces chief who is
on leave and is one of the 26 accused in the assassination of opposi
tion leader Benigno Aquino.
The newspaper said that Marcos strongly favored a reinstatement
of Ver but that Laxalt threatened a cut of U.S. aid to the Philippines if
that happened.
Reagan To Respond to Proposal
WASHINGTON — President Reagan will make a "detailed and
substantive" response to the Soviet proposal for a 50 percent reduc
tion in strategic nuclear weapons, probably in advance of his summit
meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Administration
sources said yesterday.
These sources said the timing and substance of the U.S. response
depended on presidential decisions that will be made during the next
two weeks. The Soviet proposal has been fully analyzed but differ
ences on the reply remain between the State and Defense depart
ments, the sources said.
Administration officials said there is no "artificial deadline" for a
decision, but said Reagan is likely to discuss the major features of the
U.S. response in a nationally televised speech tentatively scheduled
the week before the Nov. 19-20 summit in Geneva.
Reagan is scheduled to meet today with his national security ad
visers and preside at a National Security Council meeting on Friday.
The president also will confer with Secretary of State George Shultz
before he departs Saturday for Moscow, where he will discuss the
summit with Gorbachev.
Hussein Confers With Arafat
AMMAN, Jordan — King Hussein of Jordan met yesterday with
leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and there were
signs that they had failed to resolve their policy differences over ter
rorism or to agree on a joint approach to negotiations with Israel.
Hussein spent two-and-a-half hours with PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat and seven of Arafat's senior aides and advisers at his Nedwa
palace.
Hussein has told interviewers that a series of recent develop
ments, including the hijacking of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro
and the cancellation of talks between a Jordanian-PLO delegation and
British officials, had left him "very unhappy" with the PLO and
forced him to reassess his relations with the organization.
Although it seemed evident that Hussein had privately criticized
the PLO's actions in terms far stronger than those used in the com
munique, it was also clear that he and Arafat had not decided to aban
don their efforts to arrange a negotiated settlement.
Nerve Gas Stockpiling Alleged
WASHINGTON — The Defense Department, trying to bolster its
case in Congress for a new generation of chemical weapons, issued a
new intelligence report yesterday asserting that the Soviet Union
has stocked nerve gas at 32 Eastern European sites.
The report by the Defense Intelligence Agency cited a 26 percent
increase in Soviet nerve gas depots since 1980 and warned that Mos
cow is researching new chemical agents capable of penetrating pro
tective gear issued to U.S. troops.
Although the Reagan Administration had persuaded Congress ear
lier this year to counter the Soviet threat with the first U.S. produc
tion of chemical weapons in 16 years, the House Appropriations
Committee last week voted down a $164 million request to
modernize the aging, obsolete U.S. stockpile.
A major battle on the controversial issue is expected when the ap
propriations bill comes up for consideration in the full House, pos
sibly this week.
The Administration argues that an obsolete and dangerous U.S.
chemical arsenal leaves North Atlantic Treaty Organization troops in
Europe unable to deter an attack by a Soviet inventory estimated to
be 10 times larger. The average age of the U.S. munitions is 26
years, and Pentagon authorities say only 10 percent of the chemical
arsenal is militarily usable.

case in Congress for a new generation of chemical weapons, issued a
new intelligence report yesterday asserting that the Soviet Union
has stocked nerve gas at 32 Eastern European sites.
The report by the Defense Intelligence Agency cited a 26 percent
increase in Soviet nerve gas depots since 1980 and warned that Mos
cow is researching new chemical agents capable of penetrating pro
tective gear issued to U.S. troops.
Although the Reagan Administration had persuaded Congress ear
lier this year to counter the Soviet threat with the first U.S. produc
tion of chemical weapons in 16 years, the House Appropriations
Committee last week voted down a $164 million request to
modernize the aging, obsolete U.S. stockpile.
A major battle on the controversial issue is expected when the ap
propriations bill comes up for consideration in the full House, pos
sibly this week.
The Administration argues that an obsolete and dangerous U.S.
chemical arsenal leaves North Atlantic Treaty Organization troops in
Europe unable to deter an attack by a Soviet inventory estimated to
be 10 times larger. The average age of the U.S. munitions is 26
years, and Pentagon authorities say only 10 percent of the chemical
arsenal is militarily usable.
Sakharov's Wife May Be Freed
MOSCOW — A Soviet journalist said today reports that the wife of
dissident physicist Andrei Sakharov will be allowed to go to the West
for medical care are true, and that the United States is a probable
destination.
The West German newspaper Bild, quoting reliable sources in
Moscow, reported yesterday that Yelena Bonner had been told by
Soviet authorities she could "fly immediately to wherever she
wants."
Victor Louis, a Soviet journalist who in the past has provided infor
mation to Western journalists that has proved accurate, said of the
Bild report:
"That is what I understand. As far as I am concerned it is authen
tic, that she will be allowed to go, that it will not be a one-way ticket,
that it is up to her when and where."
Bonner reportedly suffers from a serious eye ailment, and has
sought the right to receive treatment in the West.
Asked if he knew what her destination might be, Louis said, "she
has been in Italy before, and now she has relatives in the States, so it
is up to her. Maybe she will want medical care in the United States."
He said he was sure Bonner's daughter, Tatiana Yankelevich, who
now lives in Newton, Mass., would most likely receive information
about Bonner any day.
"I think it will then be common knowledge," Louis said.
Marcos To Implement Reforms
MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos has agreed
to implement at least four reforms demanded by the United States,
including permission for modernization of U.S. military facilities in
the Philippines, it was reported yesterday.
Quoting unnamed government sources, the economic daily Busi
ness Day said that Marcos made four "commitments" to stabilize the
country's political and economic climate following the recent visit of
Sen. Paul Laxalt (R.-Nev.)
The "commitments" included allowing U.S. observers to monitor
local polls and presidential elections in 1987, introducing reforms in
the military, allowing the United States to modernize Clark Air Base
and the Subic Bay Naval Base and allowing more Americans and
other foreign news agencies to observe and report on the
Philippines.
Business Day said that Marcos and Laxalt had expressed opposing
views with regard to Gen. Fabian Ver, the armed forces chief who is
on leave and is one of the 26 accused in the assassination of opposi
tion leader Benigno Aquino.
The newspaper said that Marcos strongly favored a reinstatement
of Ver but that Laxalt threatened a cut of U.S. aid to the Philippines if
that happened.
Reagan To Respond to Proposal
WASHINGTON — President Reagan will make a "detailed and
substantive" response to the Soviet proposal for a 50 percent reduc
tion in strategic nuclear weapons, probably in advance of his summit
meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Administration
sources said yesterday.
These sources said the timing and substance of the U.S. response
depended on presidential decisions that will be made during the next
two weeks. The Soviet proposal has been fully analyzed but differ
ences on the reply remain between the State and Defense depart
ments, the sources said.
Administration officials said there is no "artificial deadline" for a
decision, but said Reagan is likely to discuss the major features of the
U.S. response in a nationally televised speech tentatively scheduled
the week before the Nov. 19-20 summit in Geneva.
Reagan is scheduled to meet today with his national security ad
visers and preside at a National Security Council meeting on Friday.
The president also will confer with Secretary of State George Shultz
before he departs Saturday for Moscow, where he will discuss the
summit with Gorbachev.
Hussein Confers With Arafat
AMMAN, Jordan — King Hussein of Jordan met yesterday with
leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and there were
signs that they had failed to resolve their policy differences over ter
rorism or to agree on a joint approach to negotiations with Israel.
Hussein spent two-and-a-half hours with PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat and seven of Arafat's senior aides and advisers at his Nedwa
palace.
Hussein has told interviewers that a series of recent develop
ments, including the hijacking of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro
and the cancellation of talks between a Jordanian-PLO delegation and
British officials, had left him "very unhappy" with the PLO and
forced him to reassess his relations with the organization.
Although it seemed evident that Hussein had privately criticized
the PLO's actions in terms far stronger than those used in the com
munique, it was also clear that he and Arafat had not decided to aban
don their efforts to arrange a negotiated settlement.
