# Father and son receive sentences
## Walkers Plead Guilty in Espionage Trial 
### 
BALTIMORE â€” John Anthony Walker Jr. and
the sailor son he recruited into spying for the So
viet Union pleaded guilty to espionage charges
yesterday in an arrangement that will mean the
father must serve at least 10 years of a life
prison sentence and his son more than eight
years.
For the deal to stand, John Walker must
cooperate fully with the government in future
proceedings, including the espionage trial of his
Navy buddy, Jerry Whitworth. That trial is
scheduled for Jan. 13 in San Francisco.
"The reason we entered into this agreement
is because John Walker has something of vital in
terest to this country," said Assistant U.S. At
torney Michael Schatzow. "We need to know
what has been broken and what needs to be
fixed."
The principal beneficiary of the arrangement is
the 22-year-old Michael, who was subject to two
life terms plus 30 years if he had been convicted
in a later trial.

"The only thing we had to offer Mr. Walker
would be some concession for his son," Schat
zow said.
The trial of the older Walker had been sched
uled for yesterday, but the plea session was held
instead.
The agreement specified that the sentences,
to be imposed later by U.S. District Judge Alex
ander Harvey 11, will be two life terms plus 10
years for John Walker and two 25-year terms
plus three 10-year terms for Michael.
The sentences will be served concurrently,
making John Walker eligible for parole in 10 years
and his son after eight years and four months.
Harvey said he does not usually allow
prosecutors and the defense to work out sen
tences, but that there are exceptional circum
stances in the Walker cases.
"The most significant aspect is the full and
frank consideration John Walker has agreed to
give the government. The information he has
furnished should be of great, incalculable value to

the government. If he doesn't fulfill his commit
ments, the agreements can be stricken," Harvey
said.
Neither Walker nor his son spoke at the three
hour session except to answer the judge's ques
tions on whether they understood their pleas and
the sentences that would be imposed.
Fred Warren Bennett, the public defender ap
pearing for John Walker, said the government's
case was "exceptionally strong, if not over
whelming," and his client might have gotten a
much longer sentence had he gone to trial.
Bennett said the sentence means Michael will
serve no longer than 16 years eight months, with
good behavior, meaning that he will be out of jail
before his 40th birthday.
Walker, 48, pleaded guilty to three counts, in
cluding a new charge of conspiracy that extends
his espionage activities over an 17-year period
beginning in 1968 until his arrest in May. The ini
tial indictment covered only a two-year period
beginning in 1983.
