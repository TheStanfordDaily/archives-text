CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Federal

Eight followers of the 53-year
old Rajneesh, whose Oregon

U.S. Marshal Ray Abrams.
The guru and his followers were
taken into custody after they landed

two Lear jets that had flown from
the Rajneeshpuram, Ore.,
commune to Charlotte.
"They were going to change
planes and charter another two
planes to fly to Bermuda tonight,"
Abrams said.
Four pilots also taken into cus
tody from the jets were released.
The pilots had filed a flight plan for
Charlotte and had been tracked
across the country by federal
agents.
Frank Herrin, criminal inves

six women and three men, including
Rajneesh, were being held and that
one of the men was Rajneesh's per
sonal physician.
A pistol was recovered from the
runway near a plane, and Herrin
said it came from one of Rajneesh's
aircraft.
In Portland, Carl Houseman,
regional director of the U.S. Im
migration and Naturalization Ser

charging him with conspiracy to
make false statements to immigra

aliens illegally in the United States.
Rajneesh is the spiritual leader of
a sect that claims up to 500,000 ad
herents, mainly in the United
States, Western Europe and
Australia.
Ed Brigham, assistant agent in
charge of the INS in Charlotte, said
the arrest was requested by the
U.S. attorney of Oregon involving
"an investigation concerning Bhag
wan Shree Rajneesh and various
other people relating to the viola
tion of immigration laws."
