Storm Hits Louisiana
NEW IBERIA, La. — Hurricane Juan, a sur
prising late-season storm, thrashed off-shore
oil rigs with 85 mph wind and waves up to 20
feet yesterday on the Gulf of Mexico, swamp
ing boats and forcing 80 oil workers over
board, and high water stranded hundreds of
people on land.
At least three people were killed, and the
Coast Guard was searching for three people
missing on the Gulf, spokesman Keith
Spangler said. In addition, one man was re
ported missing on Lake Ponchartrain.
Because the storm came so late in the
season, many people paid little attention to
warnings until Juan reached hurricane strength
Sunday afternoon, and by then three days of
rain and high tides had already flooded some
homes and roads. Many offshore oil workers
also were caught unprepared.
Tides were reported up to seven feet above
normal along the coast.
Tornadoes that spun off the hurricane's out
lying storms struck Florida's Panhandle, and
heavy rain prompted flash flood watches in
parts of Texas and Mississippi.
The Coast Guard reported yesterday that it
and other agencies had rescued 141 people
since Sunday afternoon.
They included 79 of the 80 workers who
were forced to go overboard in "unsinkable"
escape capsules, special 30-foot lifeboats,
when one oil rig lost its moorings and smashed
into another 35 miles south of Leeville,
Spangler said.

Animal Controls OK'd
WASHINGTON — Amid increasingly
militant protests by animal welfare groups, the
Senate approved legislation yesterday that
would significantly boost safeguards for the
100 million animals used in scientific research
each year.
The legislation, tacked onto a massive farm
aid bill by voice vote, would increase the num
ber of laboratory inspections, provide stricter
penalties for violations and require painkillers
or euthanasia for animals suffering in experi
ments.
The measure also would require scientists
to have prior training in animal care, set up a
computerized information service to avoid
duplication of experiments and require ade
quate exercise for caged dogs and primates.
The Senate action came in the midst of an
increasingly well-organized, well-publicized
campaign by animal welfare groups to call at
tention to research practices.
Penn Heart Replaced
HERSHEY, Pa. — Doctors late yesterday
began transplanting a human heart in a 44-
year-old man who lived 11 days as the first
recipient of the artificial Penn State heart.
Anthony Mandia went into surgery hours
after doctors rejected using another donor
heart for him. That heart, considered too big
for Mandia, instead went earlier yesterday to a
47-year-old factory worker who was kept alive

four days with a Jarvik-7 artrfical heart in Pitts
burgh.
Thomas Gaidosh, of Sutersville, was in criti
cal condition after the 3 hour procedure, which
surgeons described as "routine," said Tom
Chakurda, spokesman for Presbyterian-
University Hospital of Pittsburgh.
Reagan Blasts Delay
WASHINGTON — President Reagan yes
terday accused Congress of "inexcusable dit
hering and delay" on legislation to raise the
debt ceiling and require a balanced budget, and
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.)
called for action by Friday.
Adding to the pressure on Congress to
move this week on the Gramm-Rudman pro
posal are a threat by the Treasury Department
to dip into the Social Security trust fund on
Friday to meet expenses and a threat by the
Republican-controlled Senate to toss the
whole problem into the lap of the Democratic
run House by mid-week.
Market Closes Mixed
NEW YORK — The stock market bounced
back from a round of morning selling to finish
mixed yesterday, thanks to some buying of
blue-chip issues near the close.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
down about 5 points in the early going, finished
with a 3.47 gain at 1,359.99.
