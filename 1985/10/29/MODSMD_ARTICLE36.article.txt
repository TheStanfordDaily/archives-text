Lotto Winners Picked
LOS ANGELES — A Northern California
telephone company maintenance adminstrator
became the first winner of the state lottery's
$2 million jackpot yesterday, while three
others won prizes of $100,000 each, lottery of
ficials said.
Linda Scott, 38, of Jackson, a community
east of Sacramento, won the $2 million spin of
the wheel, a jackpot that eluded the other 19
spinners of the wheel.
A flushed Scott jumped up and down and
hugged all those around her before lottery
commission Chairman Howard Varner gave
her a check for $80,000. Another 19 checks
will follow during the next 20 years. The
$100,000 annual payments have $20,000 wit
held for taxes.
Other than buying a Mercedes Benz sports
car, she said she had made no specific plans for
spending the money.
The three $100,000 winners were Glenda
Sue Glass, 37, an industrial assembler from
San Jose; William Barlow Jr., 29, a store

manager in Huntington Beach, and Lillian Bar
low, 58, a housewife from Littlerock. The two
Barlows are not related.
Jurors Deny Claims
SAN DIEGO — Ten jurors deny allegations
by two other jurors that a court bailiff inter
fered with the deliberations leading to Mayor
Roger Hedgecock's felony conviction, a dis
trict attorney's spokesman said yesterday.
In sworn declarations obtained by the dis
trict attorney's office, the 10 jurors said they
were not pressured into reaching a verdict
against Hedgecock, who was convicted Oct. 9
of 13 perjury and conspiracy charges.
The declarations were filed in Superior
Court yesterday as part of District Attorney
Ed Miller's response to a defense motion for a
new trial. The motion is based on sworn state
ments from jurors Stanley Bohensky and
Kathy Saxton-Calderwood, who allege bailiff
A 1 Burroughs Jr. improperly offered jurors his
definition of "reasonable doubt" and prodded

jurors to reach a unanimous verdict.
A hearing on the motion is set for Nov. 4,
two days before Hedgecock's scheduled sen
tencing. Hedgecock, whose conviction
stemmed from an alleged plot to illegally
finance his 1983 mayoral campaign, faces a
maximum eight-year prison term, a fine and
automatic ouster from office upon sentencing.
Whale Moves Inland
PITTSBURG — Marine biologists,
frustrated that Humphrey the humpback whale
retreated upstream the 14 miles he had gained
the day before, decided yesterday to let the
lost, 45-ton humpback whale swim where he
wants in the Sacramento River for a while.
Stone said rescue workers will not attempt
to prevent the whale from going upstream
back under the bridge. The span is one of two
bridges that confronted the whale as it was
herded with great difficulty by pipe-clanging
boats toward the ocean.
