An attorney for retiring Dermatology Prof. Eugene
Farber said yesterday he anticipates charges of sexual
battery leveled against the professor by a former pa
tient in January will be dismissed when the case is
heard early next year.
The attorney, Tom Nolan, declined further com
ment, but Harry Bremond, another of Farber's attor
neys, recently told the University News Service, "The
charges are entirely without foundation." The case is
to be heard Jan. 6.
Farber, chairman of the Dermatology Department at
Stanford Medical School for the last 35 years, has been
unavailable for comment, but said in a prepared state
ment: "Tom Nolan, my attorney, has asked me not to
comment on the impending charges. Mr. Nolan re
emphasized that the charges are totally unfounded and
he expects the matter to be dismissed."
Neither Farber nor his attorneys would elaborate on
the quality of the evidence or what action they might
take if the case were not dismissed.
An incomplete University investigation of the inci
dent was made moot recently when Farber announced
his plan to retire in August. He is currently on sabbati

cal for the remainder of the academic year.
It was unnecessary for Stanford to complete its in
vestigation since Farber no longer has University re
sponsibilities, according to Medical School Dean David
Korn.
The University launched its investigation in January,
but was delayed for several months because first-hand
testimony was not available. The inquest was carried
out according to faculty disciplinary procedures
stipulating that the process remain confidential.
Farber has said his decision to retire was influenced
both by "health considerations" and the need for extra
time to defend against the charges.
Farber was arrested Jan. 3 after a female patient
charged he had carried out an unnecessary pelvic ex
amination and later tried to "grab her and kiss her"
during an appointment, Lynne Johnson, coordinator of
the Palo Alto Police Department's Investigative
Services Division, told The Daily shortly after the inci
dent.
The patient was seeing Farber for treatment of a
skin condition, psoriasis, on her feet.
Johnson said at the time, "Based on our information,
[a pelvic examination] is not a normal exam performed
for psoriasis of the feet."
Farber's attorneys contended
that another doctor — third-year
dermatology resident Richard
Noodleman — was also present in
the examination room. Farber
pleaded not guilty to the charge of
sexual battery at his arraignment
Jan. 18.

In addition to his work at Stan
ford, Farber has also served for the
past eight years as president of the
Psoriasis Research Institute in Palo
Alto, where he has said he plans to
continue work following retire
ment.
Farber notes in his statement
that he also plans to complete a
textbook on psoriasis, finish a proj
ect on psoriasis arthritis and do
other research at the institute.
