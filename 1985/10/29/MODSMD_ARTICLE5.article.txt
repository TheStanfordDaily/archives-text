# Kennedy To Release Findings
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy announced yesterday
that he will release the findings of
a University investigation of al
leged incidents of police brutality
in the Oct. 11 arrest of nine anti
apartheid protesters no later than
Friday.
Speaking to approximately 40
people at Soto, Kennedy said he
read the findings of Law Prof.
John Kaplan's investigation Sun
day, but needs time to discuss the
report with other officials, includ
ing John Schwartz, University
vice president and general coun
sel, and James Lyons, dean of
Student Aifairs.
Kaplan's report "will do a good
deal to clarify" the events sur
rounding the arrest of students
during a sit-in at Old Union to

protest University investments in
companies doing business in
South Africa, Kennedy said.
The students were arrested
when they refused to leave the
building at the request of police
and University officials.
Calling Kaplan's investigation
"a thorough examination," Ken
nedy said the report sheds "quite
a lot of clarity" on the treatment
of the arrestees by Stanford
police officers.
Kennedy said "the evidence is
less clear" about what happened
to the students after they were
turned over to Santa Clara
County sheriff's officers and
taken to North County Jail in Palo
Alto.
Kennedy said, however, that
there are "some unresolvable dif
ferences between the statements
of the people who were" at the
jail.
Stanford senior Robby Perkins

has said he was stripped and
beaten by deputies at the jail.
Police officals have denied his
charges.
Responding to a question about
criticism of the University-


Donald Kennedy
University President
produced "Stanford and South
Africa" pamphlet, Kennedy said the
publication tried to present "a back
ground of generally agreed to and
ascertained facts."
Kennedy said it was "not surpris
ing" that the pamphlet drew
criticism.
