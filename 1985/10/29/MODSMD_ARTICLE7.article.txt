# UC Advertises Tougher Admissions
## Media blitz tells high school students of new options 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
The University of California has mounted a
major advertising campaign to alert prospective
students to a new admissions policy and stiffer
entrance requirements.
Seventeen major California newspapers
carried full-page UC advertisements Sunday,

Education Watch

and nine Hispanic and black papers will carry the
ads tomorrow. In addition, public service com
mercials have been sent to radio and television
stations.
The campaign began as an attempt to publicize
the university's new application system, which
for the first time will allow students to apply to as
many UC campuses as they wish.
"But it kind of grew into encompassing as well
the changes in the admissions requirements,"
according to UC spokesman Mike Lassiter. "The
president of the university (David Gardner) felt
it was a good time to bring it together in one fell
swoop."
That one fell swoop will cost the university
$89,000, Lassiter said, but the money will come
from donations by "alumni and friends," and not

from state funds. The campaign is the largest of
its kind in UC history.
Headlined "High School Students . . . UC
wants you to know,"the advertisements in Sun
day papers describe the new UC application sys
tem and admissions requirements.
Previously, California high school students
were allowed to apply to just one UC campus and
list another UC campus as a second choice. If a
student was rejected by his first-choice school,
he often had to wait as much as two months

before hearing from his second-choice school,
Lassiter said.
But under the new system, students will be
able to apply to as many of the eight undergradu
ate UC campuses as they wish: Berkeley, Davis,
Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego,
Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz. Applicants then
will hear from all of the campuses to which they
applied at about the same time, Lassiter said.
The basic application fee is the same — $35
for applying to a first- and second-choice school.
Students will be charged $20 more for each addi
tional campus to which they wish to apply.
The advertisements also outline tougher ad
missions standards adopted by the UC Board of
Regents in 1982. The new high school require
ments include one year of U.S. his
tory/government, four years of English, three
years of mathematics, one year of laboratory sci
ence, two years of foreign language and four
years of college preparatory electives like En
glish, advanced math, fine arts, foreign lan
guages and history.
The ads also include a toll-free number — 1-
800-UC-ADMIT — that students may call for
more information. Lassiter said the number has
been "mobbed with phone calls" since the ads
appeared Sunday morning.
