# Poll Shows Blacks Want Divestment
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Seventy-five percent of urban
blacks in South Africa advocate
some form of divestment, accord
ing to Mark Orkin, director of the*
Community Agency for Social En
quiry (CASE) in Johannesburg,
South Africa.
Lecturing yesterday in the
CERAS building, Orkin told a
noontime audience of 50 that a pre
vious U.S. poll had erroneously in
dicated that a majority of urban
blacks actually favored continued
foreign investment in South Africa.
"The poll asked, 'Do you want
total divestment or not?' " Orkin
said, explaining that the question
was misleading because it failed to
account for more moderate options.
He cited a CASE poll that found
that while 26 percent of urban
blacks questioned recommended
total foreign divestment as a means
of ending apartheid, 49 percent
favored conditional divestment.
"This intuitively corresponds
with what black men and women in

the street would think," Orkin said.
"They want an end to apartheid,
but they have half a dozen depen
dents and . . . (tenuous) jobs. They
feel that conditional divestment
may have less impact on their per
sonal lives."

Orkin, who is white, added that
"if total divestment happened to
morrow," the white population of
South Africa would suffer a 60 per

cent increase in unemployment,
while blacks would experience a 4
or 5 percent increase.
Orkin cited statistics that reveal
a desire by blacks to gain "a trans.-
fer of power in the workplace,"
saying that conditional divestment
could bring about such a transfer.
He warned that "blacks are
prepared to fight if they continue to
be denied," quoting South African
Bishop Desmond Tutu's statement
that South Africa is approaching a
civil war.
"Ninety percent of black South
Africans would prefer genuine
negotiations (to violent opposi
tion)," Orkin said. "They still have
the patience to hold out the palm of
peace."
Orkin said that CASE statistics
reveal a dramatic increase in the
percentage of urban blacks favoring
conditional divestment since last
year.
"There's been a shift to a more
radical position," Orkin said, noting
that while only 10 to 15 percent of
the black work force is in trade un
ions, the figure 10 years ago was 1
percent.
