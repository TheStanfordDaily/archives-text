# U.N. Fellow Assails Policy

### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
An "unprecented escalation" of the
arms race is inevitable unless the United
States agrees to negotiate its Strategic
Defense Initiative and offers proposals
that are in the interest of both super
powers, according to a 1983 Stanford
graduate who recently returned from a
United Nations disarmament fellowship in
Geneva.
The Reagan Administration must radi
cally revamp its "laissez faire" approach to
arms control, Kathleen Maloney told a
Fairchild Auditorium audience last night.
If the Administration does not change its
tack, the stalemate in the bilateral Geneva
arms talks will continue, and the result
will be disastrous.
"If you don't watch out, you're going to
end up in the direction you're headed,"
said Maloney, quoting what she said was a
Chinese proverb.

"We have a war-fighting strategy," said
Maloney, asserting that the Reagan Ad
ministration's nuclear doctrine, which
seeks to ensure that the United States
can prevail in a nuclear war, has been ex
panded to cover military superiority in
space.
Maloney called for prevention of the
militarization of space, saying the Strate
gic Defense Initiative, popularly known as
"Star Wars," and the U.S. anti-satellite
program are highly destabilizing.
She said the Reagan Administration has
attempted to "spoil the atmosphere
before the (November) summit" with anti-
Soviet propaganda that demonstrates
Reagan's "lack of commitment to fair
talks."
She cited as an example the U.S. accu
sations that the Soviet Union has violated
several arms control treaties. Rather than
assert that the Soviets have cheated, the
United States should act in a "businesslike
manner" by taking its case against the
Soviets to the Standing Consultative

Commission in Geneva, Maloney said.
Saying that "we fear most what we
know least," Maloney called for a better
understanding of Soviet policies and aims.
The United States should stress the
positive aspects of U.S.-Soviet relations
— joint space ventures and scientific,
educational and cultural exchanges —
rather than poisoning the well. "We should
break down the myth that the Soviets
don't comply with treaties/' she said.
Maloney denounced the Unites States'
negative response to the Soviet call for a
temporary moratorium on all nuclear test
ing, saying the Soviet proposals are sin
cere efforts to improve U.S.-Soviet rela
tions and to create an atmosphere in
which the superpowers may negotiate an
arms control treaty.
Her critique of the Reagan Administra
tion's arms control policies and anti-Soviet
propaganda was received warmly by the
audience, largely members of the Mid-
Peninsula chapter of the Physicians for
Social Responsibility.
