You get up at the crack of dawn and get an early start. Before you
head for the office or that first class, you realize you've got just a few
extra minutes to satisfy that early morning hunger. Almost instinctively
you head for The Store at Tresidder Union because you know they'll
have just what you need to get the day off on the right foot.
We don't have worms, but we do have everything that an early bird may
need:
