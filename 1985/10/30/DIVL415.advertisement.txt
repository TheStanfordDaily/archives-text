CORRECTIONS
In the last issue of the ASSU NEWS we incorrectly reported that
there was a meaning and purpose to going through the pointless,
boring motions we call life. There isn't. The NEWS regrets the
error.
A photograph of a ham and cheese sandwich printed in last
week's ASSU NEWS was mistakenly identified as Winston Chur
chill. The NEWS regrets the error.
Two weeks ago the NEWS printed the word "penis." Apparently
someone was offended that we printed the word "penis." The
NEWS is sorry. We will never print "penis" again.
An article in last week's NEWS misquoted a graduate senator as
saying: "I'm just a power-happy, self-aggrandizing son of scum."
No one would ever say such a thing. Not out loud, at least. The
NEWS regrets the error.
