# Co-ops Join To Prepare Strike Plan
## 
### LIZ EGAN Staff writer 
Representatives from co-op
houses met last night at Columbae
to explore ways in which they can
provide meals for students who will
be affected if the United Stanford
Workers go on strike tomorrow.
The group decided on an
"outreach effort" as an alternative
to meals provided by the University
in the event of a strike.
In addition to serving food to stu
dents, the co-op representatives
expressed interest in educating
people about a possible strike. "At
least if we don't take sides, we can
provide a service to the students,"
said Ph.D. candidate Lee Alten
berg, a member of the Co-op Coun
cil.
The University has said it would
hire non-union workers to work in
the Wilbur dining hall, but that the
quantity of food offered would not
meet the demands of all the stu
dents affected by the strike. Most
would have to go elsewhere to buy
their meals.
At the meeting, the co-op repre
sentatives tentatively decided to
serve meals to students on a first
come basis. Discussed in the
meeting was the price of these din
ners, which the representatives
said will probably be about $2.
If a strike occurs, students who
eat University Food Service meals
will be given a weekly allowance to
buy their food. The amount of the
allowance will depend upon the
meal plan for which the student has
paid.
At the meeting it was decided
that each house would increase its
number of servings at dinner to ac
commodate a specific number of
students who do not live in the co
op, if there is a strike.
One concern raised at the
meeting was that this offer would
only tend to worsen the situation
because of the limited amount of
spaces. Nancy Shayer from Terra
House proposed that in order to
"conserve resources," the co-ops
pick two or three specific houses in
which to collectively serve dinners
on a large-scale basis.
Her proposal was tentatively ac
cepted by the co-op representa
tives. If the strike takes place to
morrow, there will be a large din
ner offered that evening at one of
the houses, Altenberg said.
In the event of a strike, each co
op will decide whether it can logisti
cally perform a major eating opera
tion or simply offer reservations to
a small number of students.
The co-op representatives said
that even though many of these
houses lack the necessary kitchen
facilities to serve a large number of
people, they intend to do every
thing possible to alleviate the incon
venience.
"I'm just distressed because I
want to do more," said Lisa Ruben,
a senior living in Synergy.
A flier will be distributed tomor
row informing the campus of the
different eating options and listing
the phone numbers to reserve
places, according to Altenberg.
Three USW members attending
the meeting offered their full sup
port of the co-op effort. Not only
will various USW members help
cook if there are large-scale din
ners, but they will use their own
vans and trucks to help deliver food
to the houses in order to keep

delivery trucks from crossing
picket lines, they said.
"Once we're in action and every
one puts in his or her experience,
no doubt well put out food for 100
to 150 people," said USW member
Rafael Verbera.
"The symbolic value [of the co
op effort] far outweighs the actual
number of students that can be
fed," Stephens said.
The USW negotiating team has
said it expects to recommend to
morrow that USW members vote
against the offer given by the Uni
versity. The offer provides a 16
percent wage increase spread over
the next three years, which the
USW team has accepted. However,
the union says that the University's
provisions in the areas of job secur
ity and union representation are not
satisfactory.
