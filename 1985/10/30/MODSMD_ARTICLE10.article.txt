# Stanford Prime Contender For Global Affairs Project
## 
### JOYA WESLEY Senior staff writer 
Stanford is a "prime contender" in the
bid for a state contract to manage a
recently approved international studies
project that was modeled after a Univer
sity program.
The authorizing bill, an attempt to
reduce a perceived ignorance of global af
fairs among California elementary and
secondary school children, was signed by
Gov. George Deukmejian last month.
The governor authorized the creation
of the California International Studies
Project, a three-year plan to establish 18
international studies teacher training
centers at public and private colleges and
universities throughout the state.
The project, initially intended to begin
during the 1985-86 fiscal year, was
delayed due to funding problems. Deuk
mejian used his line-item veto power to
reduce the bill's appropriation from the
$500,000 initially requested to $25,000,

which will be used to organize the admin
istrative machinery and to choose a col
lege or university to administer it.
According to Josh Newman, assistant
to the bill's author, Assemblyman Sam
Farr (D-Monterey), Stanford is "definitely
a prime contender." Other private and
public universities in California are ex
pected to compete, but Stanford may
have an edge, Newman said.
The University's Bay Area Global Edu
cation Project (BAGEP), a division of the
Center for Research in International
Studies (CRIS), is the model for the state
project.
Obtaining funding for the 1986-87 fiscal
year is the next hurdle for the project, ac
cording to Ron Herring, associate director
of CRIS and a prominent supporter of the
project.
State Department of Finance budget
analyst Diane Cummins said she could not
predict whether the project will be
financed because the state Department of
Education has not yet submitted a formal
request. However, she said the project

may continue even if funding is not alloca
ted.
"There are similar projects currently in
existence that are being financed by
private funds," she said.
BAGEP is currently being privately
funded. A contract award would increase
its scope and entitle the project to state
monies.
"The bill will provide a vehicle for the
state to expand this model program to
serve other areas of the state," said New
man.
If the contract is awarded to another
school, that school will formulate its own
model.
The project is intended to establish six
resource centers with $500,000 in the
first year, 12 centers with $900,000 the
second year and 18 centers with $1.5 mil
lion in the third year.
It was conceived in "recognition of the
appalling state of the international skills
and knowledge" of California's high school
graduates, Herring told University News
Service.
