## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Reagan Clouds Issue 
### 
President Reagan last week chose the occasion of
the 40th anniversary of the United Nations to
deliver a speech condemning worldwide aggression
by the Soviet Union.
The harsh tone of the speech, with a pretense of
presenting a peace proposal, demonstrated a
Reagan attitude that threatens to endanger next
month's U.S.-Soviet summit meeting in Geneva.
The overriding concern today should be the
negotiation of an arms control treaty. Reagan's
legitimate concern about peace in various hotspots
was obscured by a propaganda ploy — and arms
control and a broader peace suffered.
The representatives of scores of nations that
heard Reagan's speech deserved better. A vague
speech lambasting Soviet aggression and defending
U.S. freedom fighting brings us no closer to stop
ping the arms race.
Reagan's idea is essentially good; there is a need
to negotiate peace in trouble spots around the
world. But his accusatory tone and the boundaries
of his "fresh start" peace initiative make it unhelpful
and even counter-productive.
Reagan limited the proposal to Nicaragua, An

gola, Ethiopia, Cambodia and Afghanistan, countries
in which he believes the Soviets have improperly
flexed their Communist military muscles.
American military support in regional disputes
"must not and shall not cease," however, because
the United States supports sides seeking
democracy, the president argued.
Regardless of Soviet outrages, this is not effec
tive diplomacy.
While we do not expect the president to tell the
United Nations that the United States' military ac
tivity in some countries is wrong, he should recog
nize that the Soviets take exception to our policies
in some countries and should be willing to talk to
them about it.
In the propaganda war leading to the summit we
have seen some ridiculous proposals from the
Soviets — arms reductions in areas in which the
U.S. now has a huge advantage. But at least the
Soviets are confining their ideas to the major issue.
If Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev will bargain in
good faith, we demand that Reagan uphold the
desire of the American people and other countries
for an arms control agreement.
