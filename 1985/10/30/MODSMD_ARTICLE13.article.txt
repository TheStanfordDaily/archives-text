## Debates Shouldn't Hinge on Abuse 
### 
Academia has immense achieve
ments to its credit. But our aca
demic world is subject also to many
disabilities. All too many scholars,
and all too many students, act as if
they were members of a secular
church. They act as saints called

VIEWPOINT

upon to call on the sinners for
repentance. All too many students
and professors act as if there were
two separate spheres of disagree
ment. In the first of these, ob
jective arguments prevail and dis
agreements are held to be
legitimate. In the second — bearing
on all matters of sp-called contem
porary sensitivities and compas
sionate concern — a different stan
dard prevails. When disputants deal
with highly emotional subjects,
such as the real or alleged griev
ances of women and minorities,
or issues affecting the Third
World (such as U.S. policy toward
Nicaragua or disinvestment from
South Africa), ad personam argu

ments almost inevitably besmirch a
debate. Disputes all too often are
settled — not by considering the in
trinsic value of the opposing argu
ments — but by evaluating the
supposed personal worth of the dis
putants.
How is this personsal worth mea
sured? There are two complemen
tary criteria — both clerical in inspi
ration. The first of these might be
called the "get-thee-hence, Satan"
injunction. A debater's argument is

held to be worthless by showing
that he or she is a racist, a Fascist,
a sexist, ethnocentric, judgmental,
devoid of awareness and compas
sion, filled with corporate greed,
imbued with cultural arrogance,
weighed down by homophobia or
bigotry, or subject to hysteria,
paranoia and other disabilities
drawn from the psychiatrist's vo
cabulary.
The second argument involves
the "I-have-drunk-from-the

waters-of-affliction" plaint. The
debate draws attention to real or al
leged sufferings derived from the
disputant's gender, ethnic deriva
tion, religious affiliation, sexual ori
entation and so on. Implicitly or ex
plicitly, these sufferings are im
agined to have produced a personal
catharsis — a special insight —
that supposedly renders the dis
putant's argument superior to those
of his or her opponent.
Both assumptions are without
value, for the validity of any particu
lar argument does not hinge on its
proponent's personal worth. Harsh
as it may sound, good men and
women may sometimes be wrong.
Bad men and women may
sometimes be right. It would be
pleasant to imagine that public
debates at Stanford might in the
future be carried on without resort
to personal abuse. But given the
presently reigning assumptions, the
prospect is unlikely.
