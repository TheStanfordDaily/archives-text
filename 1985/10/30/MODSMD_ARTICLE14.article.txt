# A 						Response to the United States' Decline
## 
### 
The United States is in decline.
Just look at the world situation. Economically,
the situation is pretty clear. Despite our in
credible wealth, our situation has lately been
overshadowed by many developments. For the
first time in our history we have become a deb
tor nation. Our GNP growth crawls at a snail's
pace compared to other countries like Japan. Our
productivity refuses to increase at the same rate
as other industrialized countries. Our per-capita
income is steadily decreasing in relation to other
nations. Our former economic mainstays, the
"smokestack" industries, are slowly dying.

In this century, we have begun to import a
great deal of our energy and many strategic
minerals. The vast frontiers and their natural
riches that allowed our population growth to be
accommodated are now gone. Our share of
world output has fallen from 50 percent of the
world total to about 30 percent today. Most im
portant of all, we now possess a chronic national
debt with which we have mortgaged away our
future prosperity. In short — we have become
an industrial nation in decline.
In the international arena we seem to get less
respect every year. Our nuclear monopoly has
long since eroded, and Third World countries will
undoubtedly soon join the nuclear club. Despite
huge military expenditures, our security seems
to deteriorate every year. Terrorism against our
citizens continues unabated, with little we can do
to stop it. For the first time in our history, a
Third World country forced us to renounce the
jurisdiction of the world court.
Our European allies are no longer American
surrogates. They are instead bent on achieving
political separation from the United States.
Despite our massive foreign aid to other
countries (like Egypt), nations no longer do our
bidding. The United States has evidently lost a
lot of power in the international system we used
to dominate.

After World War 11, the United States was
overlord of the world. Our GNP was five times
the size of our closest competitor, the Soviet
Union. We were the sole possessor of the atomic
bomb. American industrial might was a controll
ing influence throughout the world. With the es
tablishment of the United Nations, we assumed
the position of the great policeman of the world.
From our liberal political tradition, we placed a
burden upon ourselves to protect the world from
communism and make it safe for democracy and
capitalism. We assumed our values were the
most fair and our government the most just sys
tem most fitting to humankind.
Today, the situation is totally different from
the world supremacy we possessed after World
War 11. From that incredible pre-eminence the
United States has had no place to go but down.
It's interesting to note that the American leaders
and people themselves seem oblivious to our
decline. It seems the Reagan Administration
with its resurgent nationalism is making one last
ditch attempt to regain our world dominance.
We have tried for the last 40 years to be the
military power in the world. The result has been
incredible expenditures on the American military
machine to defend other nations' interests. The
real American diplomatic tragedy has been our
perceived notion that nearly every interest of
our allies is by extension a vital interest to Amer
ican national security. We see threats to our se
curity everywhere and try to exercise our influ
ence accordingly. We have become international
meddlers who are often unwanted, unneeded
and, with increasing frequency, unheeded.
Throughout the Cold War, and under the cur
rent Administration, there has been a resur
gence of the belief in monolithic communists
threatening the free world — and naturally we
must rise to the occasion and defend the world.
What is the result of our high military expendi
tures and high domestic consumption? Our eco
nomy is staggering and may soon face serious
difficulties. One must hope that the United
States will not have to wait until economic col
lapse occurs to abandon expensive policies.
This situation is not a wholly negative one,
however. In this changing world role we can
develop new, more fruitful foreign policies and
attempt to deal with more pressing domestic
problems. Most of the people that read this
column will be the people that will have to deal
with the United States' decline. We, the for

mutators of tomorrow's foreign policy, must ac
cept our new position as a simple step in the
evolution of our state.
As a declining world power, it will be neces
sary to increase the international role played by
many other emerging nations. Our allies must
begin to take responsibility for areas we can no
longer afford to protect, and believe in the com
mitment to maintaining their freedom. Our na
tion should allow them to look to their own se
curity, instead of us making sure of it.
A less powerful United States devoid of con
frontationalist policies may alleviate tension in
the world and decrease the likelihood of war.
Furthermore, the increased tendency of the
United States and other nations to become
deeply involved in a world economy may also
reduce tensions. If the world economy becomes
more and more intertwined, war will have higher
and higher costs. Hopefully the cost of war will
become economically prohibitive.
It seems that the United States' consistent
policy of intervening virtually everywhere has
only antagonized other countries. Our
(hopefully) graceful decline should be marked
with increased cooperation with other countries
and less bellicose threats. Instead of viewing
revolution as a consistent threat to our security,
we should be more sympathetic to revolutionar
ies' goals and not push them into the ideological
orbits of the superpowers.
Without our truly massive overseas commit
ments, the United States government might be
able to control the budget with more ease. Our
decline brings us the opportunity to get rid of
those aspects of our foreign policy that have cost
us so much and brought us so little. We have the
opportunity to quell our irrepressible American
egos and admit we are just one of a community of
powerful nations. With foresight and rational
decisions, we can avoid the kind of lofty commit
ments we once believed we could keep.
The current times have shown we are not
what we were 40 years ago and the world is a
very different place. It's up to all of us to ac
knowledge our new world position and settle into
a new and more mature stage of our nation's life
cycle. Hopefully, both our people and the world
in general will benefit.
