On Conceptions
Of 'Feminism'

I just spent a good part of tliis
weekend attending the sympo
sium, "Margins and Mainstreams:
Feminist Scholarship, Method and
Practice." It was very interesting
for me and I'd like to thank the
Graduate Women's Network for
making it possible. The whole idea
behind it and "feminism,"
however, brings up some problems
that have been an issue for me for
a long time.
For one thing, "feminism" is a
hazy concept. Sure, in the warm,
supportive environment of feminist
scholars or women's groups it is
easy to say, "Yes, I'd like to work
in a feminist tradition or perspec
tive." But what do those words
mean, really? I can't escape the
fact that for the majority of our
society, the concept of feminism is
overwhelmingly negative. There
are "good" things and "bad" things
being done and said in the name of
feminism. From my perspective,
the bad is mostly motivated by
anger — which is understandable
but not socially constructive. Many
more good things can and should
be done without the defensiveness
and hostility that the word
feminism invokes. I am talking
about human progress and a better
life and interaction for everyone —
across race, class, gender, sexual
orientation, nationality and
whatever.
It is unfortunate that this has to
be surrounded in negative atti
tudes. So many people are too
afraid of being associated with this
"feminist movement" that they
don't consider looking into it, or
supporting what they believe is

good in it. Changing the label won't
help, but changing people's con
ceptions of it might. I think ulti
mately most of us have the same
goals, and if we would stop quib
bling and being defensive, we
might actually make some progress
toward those goals.

Indian as Mascot
A Sign of Respect

While attending the Illinois-
Wisconsin football game this
weekend, I heard a serious and
concerned Illinois alumnus remark:
"Why did Stanford so arrogantly
abandon its traditional symbol —
the American Indian? We are ex
tremely proud of this country's
native American heritage and
honor the Illini tribe as our athletic
symbol. The city of Cleveland so
honors the native American with
its baseball team, as does our
nation's capital with the Washing
ton Redskins. Does Stanford know
something about the native Ameri
can that the rest of the country
doesn't? If not, why has Stanford
destroyed its cultural image by
disgracing the noblest of
Americans and, without explana
tion, terminating a once rich and
proud identification?" As I can find
no legitimate answer to this con
stantly asked — and embarrassing
— question, please clarify, once
and for all, the University's official
position, and kindly explain why
Stanford is now symbolized by
nothing at all.
