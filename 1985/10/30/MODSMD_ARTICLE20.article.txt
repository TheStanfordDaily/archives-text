## Federal Mediator Wants Small Role 
### MICHAEL NEWMAN 
As federal mediator Maggie
Jacobsen sees it, "My job in life is to
be non-existent."
Jacobsen, who took on the
Stanford-USW case this weekend,
said she feels that if she becomes
too well-known, she will not be able
to do her job well. "When I become
an identity that is known, I lose my
effectiveness," she said. "All
mediator does is provide a forum. "
A UCLA graduate, Jacobsen has
been in the industrial relations
arena, as she called it, for almost 20
years. Since March of 1976 she has
been a federal mediator with the
San Francisco branch of the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Board
(FMCB).
"One of my main purposes is to
try to give (the two sides in a labor
dispute) a sense of perspective,"
Jacobsen said. "Of course, the prin
cipal speakers each know what
they're talking about, but
sometimes I'll have an idea on
something that they hadn't thought
of."
The Stanford-USW entanglement
is not the first university-related
case in which Jacobsen has inter
vened. She previously handled a

dispute between the University of
San Francisco and its faculty.
"It's certainly a different environ
ment, " Jacobsen said. "At a univer
sity, especially one like Stanford,
there are so many other people
who are not at the bargaining table
but have an impact on the negotia
tions — professors, the board of
trustees and alumni."
The San Francisco branch of the
FMCB handled 260 disagreements
last year, and Jacobsen was in
volved in more than 60 of them.
According to Jacobsen, her job is
interesting, but she needs to use all
of her "best traits" to be effective.
"I have to be patient, intuitive,
diplomatic and a good com
municator. Even the tone of my
voice has to be just right," she said.
Priscilla Wheeler, chief
negotiator and staff counsel for the
University, said that Jacobsen "is a
real professional (but) she doesn't
have the power to make either side
agree to anything."
Mary Ann Tenuto, chief
negotiator for USW, agreed.
"Maggie was helpful, and we were
certainly glad to have her here,"
she said. "But whether the end
result will be different (because of
Jacobsen's mediation) is hard to
say."
