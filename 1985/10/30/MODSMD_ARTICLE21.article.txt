## Stanford Profs. Wade Into Fresher Water 
### BRIAN TSANG 
Contaminated underground
water supplies may be cleaned up
soon as a result of collaboration be
tween Stanford's Environmental
Engineering and Science Program
and the Environmental Protection
Agency's Kerr Laboratory in Okla
homa.
The first major field investigation
into an alternative method for
cleaning up the contaminated un
derground water supplies is well
underway. The project is under the
direction of Prof. Paul Roberts and
four other members of Stanford's
Department of Civil Engineering.
Work has been in progress on the
project site at Moffett Naval Air
Station since early summer. The
Kerr Laboratory is funding the proj
ect.
The method to be tested is the
use of certain naturally occurring
soil bacteria to convert pollutants

released by industry into, the
groundwater into harmless com
pounds.
"This is the first examination of
this approach under natural condi
tions," said Roberts, "but faculty
and students here have been doing
research on a laboratory scale for
several years, investigating the fun
damentals of the method."
These previous experiments,
both at Stanford and at the Kerr
Laboratory, have established an un
derstanding of the principles of the
natural process of bacterial
biodegradation of groundwater con
taminants.
The bacteria of interest are es
sentially harmless, one-celled
microorganisms called methylo
trophs because they live primarily
by digesting methane, a one-carbon
compound which is a major compo
nent of natural gas.
This class of bacteria often also
"digests" other carbon compounds
as a side-process of their metabolic

processes. Among these other
compounds are some of the most
common industrially produced
groundwater pollutants.
Injecting methane into a polluted
reservoir as food for the bacteria
has proven effective in the labora
tory. The bacteria will then multiply
on the increased food supply, con
suming methane, but also, inciden
tally, the polluting chemicals in the
water. <
The greatly increased numbers
of bacteria will be capable of
degrading most or all of the offend
ing pollutant, while the naturally oc
curring numbers are incapable of
making a difference. When the
degradation is accomplished, the
methane food supply will be cut off,
causing the bacteria population to
drop back to normal levels.
The design for the Moffet project
is fairly simple in concept. An "X"
pattern of wells has been drilled
into an uncontaminated under
ground reservoir. Water is pumped

out of the center well, creating a
flow from the periphery toward the
center.
Next, methane, oxygen and
other nutrients (nitrogen, phos
phorus, etc.) dissolved in water will
be pumped into the wells at the four
corners of the "X." Samples of
water will be drawn from wells
along the arms of the "X" to moni
tor the growth of the bacteria popu
lation.
When the population grows to the
desired level, a pollutant will be
pumped in at the corner wells.
Water from the sampling wells will
be tested to determine whether the
pollutant is degraded through con
tact with the bacteria.
So far, the site has been
developed and the wells drilled.
Civil Engineering Prof. Dunja
Grbic-Galic, an environmental
microbiology specialist, is conduct
ing laboratory tests on water from
the site to determine whether the
desired organisms are present.

Other members of the project
team, all members of the Civil Engi
neering Department, are Prof.
Perry McCarty, Prof. Martin Rein
hard and research associate Dr.
Douglas MacKay.
MacKay, the project manager, is
pleased with progress thus far. "We
haven't encountered any obstacles
that we hadn't expected. It's always
a very difficult proposition to take
on field work, and the project
design is literally evolving as we go
along," he said. "We were very
lucky to find a site so well suited to
the requirements of the investiga
tion."
Both Roberts and MacKay
praised the support of both the
Kerr Laboratory and the Navy, at
tributing a large part of the smooth
progress in this stage of work to
their cooperation. The Navy,
besides providing a site for the
study, has been aiding the re
searchers with essential logistic
support.

The present study is somewhat
of a natural culmination of the last
several years' work for Roberts
who, with McCarty and others, has
been examining the nature of the
underground environment since
1976.
In the studies on this subject,
there has been a consistent empha
sis and several dozen publications
on the transport and degradation of
groundwater contamination. "In the
beginning we were more interested
in the phenomena themselves,"
Roberts said. "Only recently has it
become realistic to consider work
which actually intends to foster the
process (of biological degradation)
in the field."
Ground water contamination it
self is nothing new, however. It is
an extensive problem nationwide,
and especially here in the Santa
Clara Valley, where 50 to 60 per
cent of water comes from under
