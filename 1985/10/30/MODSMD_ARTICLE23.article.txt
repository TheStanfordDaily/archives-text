## Soccer Seeks To Sack Sonoma 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
| After a pair of disappointing
fosses, the women's soccer team is
looking at today's 3 p.m. game at
Sonoma State as a chance to
jregroup and gain some confidence.
So far it's been an up and down
Jseason for the Cardinal. At times
the team has performed up to the
level of the nationally ranked
powers. At other times, it has fallen
jto the level of basement dwellers.
Consistency has been a problem.
In the team's last outing against
jCal-State Dominquez Hills, Stan
ford played well in the first half, and
then lost it in the second.
I "We're struggling," women's
Soccer Coach Helen Keohane said.
{'Hopefully we can solve it (our
problem with inconsistency) before
this season's over and start out
fresh next year. We'll keep trying."
The Cardinal has only two games
left, today's away game and Satur
day's 1 p.m. game here against St.
Mary's. Today's contest with
Sonoma State promises to be a
tough one.
i The Sonoma Cossacks were
Highly touted entering the season,
but have had a hard time living up to
expectations. "They started out
well, but have slipped recently,"
Keohane said.
! Sonoma's strengths are a quick
offense led by forward Cindy
Romero and a physical defense
anchored by goalkeeper Kelly Rob
inson.
Keohane doesn't plan to change
the Cardinal's strategy on account
of the Cossacks' physical style, but
she does want her players "to be
aware of it," she said. Other than
that, "we'll just try and play the ball
quicker and not keep it at our feet."
