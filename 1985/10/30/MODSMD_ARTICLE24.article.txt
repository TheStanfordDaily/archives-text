# Men Golfers End Eighth
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Showing the after-effects of
playing six rounds of golf in five
days, the Stanford men's golf
team staggered into an eighth
place tie yesterday in the 54-hole
Robertson Holmes Intercol
legiate, a tournament hosted by
the University of Pacific at the
Stockton Country Club.
Arizona State, which Saturday
finished fourth in the Stanford Fall
Intercollegiate, captured the
team title with a three-round total
of 856 on the par-71 course,
beating Weber State by four
strokes. Missouri was far behind
in third at 871.
Stanford, a winner on its home
course last weekend, started off
slowly and continued that way.
The Cardinal ended in a tie with
UOP at 887.
Golf Coach Tim Schaaf did not
want to alibi for the team's disap
pointing play.
"We just didn't have much left,"
Schaaf said, "though that's no
excuse. The win here (at Stan
ford) took a lot out of us emotion
ally. I don't think it was a letdown
of interest, we were just dead â€”
over-golfed."
Carl Wagner was in contention
for the individual title after a 69 in
the third round Monday, but fell
back into an llth-place tie at 219
after shooting 75 yesterday.
Don Wals worth was more con
sistent, but still played a bit below

The men's golf team was fatigued by six rounds of golf in five
days, and it showed. The Card finished in an eighth-place tie
yesterday in Stockton.
