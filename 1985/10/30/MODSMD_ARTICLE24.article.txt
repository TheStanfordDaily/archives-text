# Men Golfers End Eighth
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Showing the after-effects of
playing six rounds of golf in five
days, the Stanford men's golf
team staggered into an eighth
place tie yesterday in the 54-hole
Robertson Holmes Intercol
legiate, a tournament hosted by
the University of Pacific at the
Stockton Country Club.
Arizona State, which Saturday
finished fourth in the Stanford Fall
Intercollegiate, captured the
team title with a three-round total
of 856 on the par-71 course,
beating Weber State by four
strokes. Missouri was far behind
in third at 871.
Stanford, a winner on its home
course last weekend, started off
slowly and continued that way.
The Cardinal ended in a tie with
UOP at 887.
Golf Coach Tim Schaaf did not
want to alibi for the team's disap
pointing play.
"We just didn't have much left,"
Schaaf said, "though that's no
excuse. The win here (at Stan
ford) took a lot out of us emotion
ally. I don't think it was a letdown
of interest, we were just dead —
over-golfed."
Carl Wagner was in contention
for the individual title after a 69 in
the third round Monday, but fell
back into an llth-place tie at 219
after shooting 75 yesterday.
Don Wals worth was more con
sistent, but still played a bit below

his standards in finishing at 221.
Brad Geer was third on the team at
229.
"We had one player play really
poorly in each round," Schaaf said.
"Carl Wagner played pretty well
... he didn't get a whole lot going
today. He probably had to work
harder for this than at Stanford.
"Don Walsworth played fairly
well, but not as well as he usually
does. Brad Geer had a good tourna
ment for a freshman."
John Dickey and Rich Marik
struggled throughout the tourna
ment, but Schaaf said that wasn't
typical of their usual play.
''The effort certainly was there
(from John and Rick)," Schaaf said.
"You have it more some days than
others.
"If we had played good the first
round we could have sustained it,"
he added, "but we played average
the whole time."
If Stanford had to do well in one
tournament and average in another,
however, they picked the right
ones. The competition at Stockton
was not quite as tough as at Stan
ford. That is not to say Schaaf
wouldn't have liked to have swept

both events.
"I'm not all that concerned," he
said. "We took some losses to some
teams that will ultimately be consid
ered for NCAA berths in the
spring. But we've achieved a couple
of goals — to establish ourselves as
a top team and to establish a way
of becoming a top team, a whole
framework for it.
"We had an opportunity to take a
dominant position on the West
Coast," he said, "but we didn't have
much left. That would have put us
way ahead of everyone's schedule.
We'll have that opportunity again in
the spring."
The Robertson marks the end of
the fall season for the Cardinal.
However, the players will remain
busy until play resumes in January.
"We have all kinds of off-season
training," Schaaf said. "We don't
stop playing. It's the only time
players can make major adjust
ments if necessary. The first six
weeks are so busy — you're basi
cally playing with what you've got.
That's why it's so satisfying to play
as well as we did."
"The other thing we do," Schaaf
said, "is play basketball. For a golf
team we have a pretty good basket
ball team. Don Walsworth was All-
State in basketball in Missouri. We

have a hotly contested game with
Cal that's already become a tradi
tion. "
Meanwhile, the Stanford
women's golf team jumped from
eighth to third place after two
rounds of the 54-hole Western In
tercollegiate in Rancho Murieta
with a round of 298. They still trail
leader San Jose State by 18 strokes
and second-place Duke by nine.

SJSU's Lisa Ipkendanz and Julie
Ralls, and Duke's Jean Bar
tholemew were tied for the individ
ual lead at 148. Stanford's Clare
Dolan was right behind them in
fourth place at 150 with a round of
74 yesterday.
Kathy Kostas' 157, Julie Carmic
hael's 160 and Trish McGonigle's
165 round out the rest of Stanford's
scoring.

Brad Geer was third on the team at
229.
"We had one player play really
poorly in each round," Schaaf said.
"Carl Wagner played pretty well
... he didn't get a whole lot going
today. He probably had to work
harder for this than at Stanford.
"Don Walsworth played fairly
well, but not as well as he usually
does. Brad Geer had a good tourna
ment for a freshman."
John Dickey and Rich Marik
struggled throughout the tourna

typical of their usual play.
''The effort certainly was there

others.
"If we had played good the first
round we could have sustained it,"
he added, "but we played average
the whole time."
If Stanford had to do well in one
tournament and average in another,
however, they picked the right
ones. The competition at Stockton
was not quite as tough as at Stan
ford. That is not to say Schaaf
wouldn't have liked to have swept

both events.
"I'm not all that concerned," he
said. "We took some losses to some
teams that will ultimately be consid
ered for NCAA berths in the
spring. But we've achieved a couple
of goals — to establish ourselves as
a top team and to establish a way
of becoming a top team, a whole
framework for it.
"We had an opportunity to take a
dominant position on the West
Coast," he said, "but we didn't have
much left. That would have put us
way ahead of everyone's schedule.
We'll have that opportunity again in
the spring."

the fall season for the Cardinal.
However, the players will remain
busy until play resumes in January.
"We have all kinds of off-season
training," Schaaf said. "We don't
stop playing. It's the only time
players can make major adjust
ments if necessary. The first six
weeks are so busy — you're basi
cally playing with what you've got.
That's why it's so satisfying to play
as well as we did."
"The other thing we do," Schaaf
said, "is play basketball. For a golf
team we have a pretty good basket
ball team. Don Walsworth was All-
State in basketball in Missouri. We

have a hotly contested game with
Cal that's already become a tradi
tion. "

women's golf team jumped from

Cardinal women's golfers like Kathy Kostas have read their
putts well enough this week to put them in third place at Rancho
Murietta.
Showing the after-effects of
playing six rounds of golf in five
days, the Stanford men's golf
team staggered into an eighth
place tie yesterday in the 54-hole
Robertson Holmes Intercol
legiate, a tournament hosted by
the University of Pacific at the
Stockton Country Club.
Arizona State, which Saturday
finished fourth in the Stanford Fall
Intercollegiate, captured the
team title with a three-round total
of 856 on the par-71 course,
beating Weber State by four
strokes. Missouri was far behind
in third at 871.
Stanford, a winner on its home
course last weekend, started off
slowly and continued that way.
The Cardinal ended in a tie with
UOP at 887.
Golf Coach Tim Schaaf did not
want to alibi for the team's disap
pointing play.
"We just didn't have much left,"
Schaaf said, "though that's no
excuse. The win here (at Stan
ford) took a lot out of us emotion
ally. I don't think it was a letdown
of interest, we were just dead —
