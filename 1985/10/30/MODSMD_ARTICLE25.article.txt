NEW YORK (AP) â€” New
York Yankees first baseman Don
Mattingly and right-hander
Dwight Gooden of the the New
York Mets, sure to be key char
acters in any future Subway Se
ries scenario, head The Associ
ated Press' major league All-Star
team.
Gooden, 24-4, was the leading
vote-getter with 114 of a possi
ble 117 votes cast by a
nationwide panel of sports writ
ers and broadcasters. Mattingly
was next with 107 votes in
results announced yesterday.
Mattingly's nearest rival at first
base, Baltimore's Eddie Murray,
had seven votes.
Mattingly, 24, led the Ameri
can League with 145 runs batted
in and hit 35 homers while bat
ting .324. His 48 doubles were
the most by a Yankee since Lou
Gehrig hit 52 in 1927, and Mat
tingly is the first American
League player to lead the majors
in doubles in consecutive years
since Tris Speaker completed a
four-year run in 1923.
"He's one of the best players
I've ever seen," new Yankee
Manager Lou Piniella said of Mat
tingly. "Take everything into
consideration (and) he's the best
player in the league right now."
The voters left little doubt
about who they considered the
best pitcher: Dr. K.
Gooden, 20 years old, led the
National League in victories;
earned run average, 1.53; com
plete games, 16; innings pitched,
276 and two-thirds; and

strikeouts, 268. He also reached
double figures in whiffs 11 times,
running his career total to 26.
"Even when he's not getting
double figures, he's amazing,"
the Mets' Gary Carter said of
Gooden. "When he gets into
trouble, how can you not be
excited by what he can do to bail
himself out?"
When those rare situations oc
curred that Gooden was in a jam
he used the strikeout pitch to
escape.

John Tudor of the St. Louis
Cardinals, who rebounded from
a 1-7 start and went on to win 20
of 21 decisions, beat out the
Yankees' Ron Guidry 80-26 as
the top left-handed pitcher.
Tudor recorded 10 shutouts,
one short of Sandy Koufax's
single-season record for a left
hander set in 1963.
Carter led the catchers with
75 votes, followed by the White
Sox's Carlton Fisk, with 40.
Carter paced the Mets with 32
homers and 100 RBI while playing
on an injured knee most of the
season.
Tommy Herr of St. Louis beat
last year's top vote-getter, Ryne
Sandberg of the Chicago Cubs, 84-
30 at second base and the voters
opted for offense over defense at
shortstop by selecting Baltimore's
Cal Ripken over St. Louis' Ozzie
Smith 67-48.
Boston's Wade Boggs' .368
average and 240 hits weren't good
enough, as Kansas City's George
Brett won selection at third base by
an 11-vote margin, 63-52.
Brett hit .335 and belted a
career-high 30 homers while
driving in 112 runs. He led the AL
with a .585 slugging percentage
while leading the Royals to a World

Series title with his characteristic
ally spectacular postseason play.
The three outfield positions went
to the Cardinals' Willie McGee, with
86 votes; Rickey Henderson of the
Yankees, 79 votes; and the Los An
geles Dodgers' Pedro Guerrero, 64
votes.
McGee topped the highest previ
ous average for a NL switch-hitter
with a .353 mark to lead the league.
The former record by a switch
hitter in the NL was .348 by Rose
in 1969 and Frankie Frisch in 1923.
The relief pitcher spot went, in a
tie at 39 votes each, to Montreal's
Jeff Reardon and Kansas City's Dan
Quisenberry.
Detroit's Darrell Evans was
voted top designated hitter, edging
Oakland's Dave Kingman, 21-17.
Evans led the AL with 40 homers,
and at the age of 38 became the
oldest player to lead the league. He

was also the first major-leaguer to
hit 40 homers in both leagues.
Manager of the Year
Whitey Herzog, who skippered
the St. Louis Cardinals to within
one game of a World Series title,
edged Cincinnati's Pete Rose by
two votes in the AP Manager-of
the-Year balloting.
Herzog received 44 of a possible
117 votes. Third in the balloting
was Bobby Cox, who resigned as
manager of the Toronto Blue Jays.
Few gave the Cardinals much of
a chance to win the National
League's East Division title after
ace reliever Bruce Sutter took his
45 saves and signed as a free agent
with Atlanta on Dec. 7, 1984.
But the ever-versatile Herzog
convened a "bullpen by committee"
and a stepped-up offense to
produce 101 victories and the NL
crown.
