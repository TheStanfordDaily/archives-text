NEW YORK (AP) â€” New
York Yankees first baseman Don
Mattingly and right-hander
Dwight Gooden of the the New
York Mets, sure to be key char
acters in any future Subway Se
ries scenario, head The Associ
ated Press' major league All-Star
team.
Gooden, 24-4, was the leading
vote-getter with 114 of a possi
ble 117 votes cast by a
nationwide panel of sports writ
ers and broadcasters. Mattingly
was next with 107 votes in
results announced yesterday.
Mattingly's nearest rival at first
base, Baltimore's Eddie Murray,
had seven votes.
Mattingly, 24, led the Ameri
can League with 145 runs batted
in and hit 35 homers while bat
ting .324. His 48 doubles were
the most by a Yankee since Lou
Gehrig hit 52 in 1927, and Mat
tingly is the first American
League player to lead the majors
in doubles in consecutive years
since Tris Speaker completed a
four-year run in 1923.
"He's one of the best players
I've ever seen," new Yankee
Manager Lou Piniella said of Mat
tingly. "Take everything into
consideration (and) he's the best
player in the league right now."
The voters left little doubt
about who they considered the
best pitcher: Dr. K.
Gooden, 20 years old, led the
National League in victories;
earned run average, 1.53; com
plete games, 16; innings pitched,
276 and two-thirds; and

strikeouts, 268. He also reached
double figures in whiffs 11 times,
running his career total to 26.
"Even when he's not getting
double figures, he's amazing,"
the Mets' Gary Carter said of
Gooden. "When he gets into
trouble, how can you not be
excited by what he can do to bail
himself out?"
When those rare situations oc
curred that Gooden was in a jam
he used the strikeout pitch to
escape.
