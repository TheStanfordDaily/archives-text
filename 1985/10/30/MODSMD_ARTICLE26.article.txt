# Bulldogs Visit Farm Hoping To Bite Card
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
The Stanford men's soccer team
begins the homestretch of its
season today when the Cardinal
hosts UC-Davis in a non
conference contest at 2:30 p.m. on
Harry Maloney Field.
Stanford will be looking to extend
its five-game winning streak. The
team has won six of its last seven
games, raising its record to 10-6-2
overall and 4-1 in the Pacific Soccer
Conference (PSC).
Second-year Coach Sam Koch's
squad is coming off victories last
week over Sacramento State and
PSC rival Santa Clara. But the most
important development for the
team last week occurred Sunday
night while the Cardinal players
were probably studying for mid
terms.
In a crucial PSC game Sunday in
Fresno, the Fresno State Bulldogs
defeated the University of San
Francisco 1-0, and dealt a crippling
blow to Stanford's chances of win
ning the PSC championship.
The victory was the Bulldogs'
record to 6-0 in the PSC, with only
one game left to play in the confer
ence (against San Jose State Satur
day). As a result, Stanford can now
only tie Fresno for first place. The
Cardinal must defeat both California
and the University of the Pacific
next week, while Fresno State
must lose to San Jose State.

Today's non-conference match with visiting UC-Davis will be
crucial to Stanford's hopes of earning an at-large bid to the
post-season NCAA tournament.
Second place in the PSC may be
good enough for an NCAA post
season bid, but Stanford cannot af
ford to look past UC-Davis.
Mustang Coach Will Lotter has
guided his team to a 10-4-2 overall
record and a 6-2 mark in the North
ern California Athletic Conference.
Lotter's squad features a solid
scoring attack led by Jesus Rico's
10 goals. Olaf Elze and Dan Gilbert
have chipped in with five and four
goals, respectively.
The Cardinal will counter with an

offense which has been consistently
productive lately. Senior Angel
Vazquez leads the team in scoring
with seven goals and four assists.
Stanford midfielder Tom Rafalovich
has four goals while forwards Gian
carlo Ferruzzi and Rob West have
three goals apiece.
Even though today's match is not
a conference contest, it could be a
key to Stanford's post-season
hopes. If the Cardinal team can win
its last three games, it will have
ended the season with an eight
game winning streak. Such a strong
finish should look impressive to the
NCAA committee which hands out
tournament bids.
