# Bulldogs Visit Farm Hoping To Bite Card
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
The Stanford men's soccer team
begins the homestretch of its
season today when the Cardinal
hosts UC-Davis in a non
conference contest at 2:30 p.m. on
Harry Maloney Field.
Stanford will be looking to extend
its five-game winning streak. The
team has won six of its last seven
games, raising its record to 10-6-2
overall and 4-1 in the Pacific Soccer
Conference (PSC).
Second-year Coach Sam Koch's
squad is coming off victories last
week over Sacramento State and
PSC rival Santa Clara. But the most
important development for the
team last week occurred Sunday
night while the Cardinal players
were probably studying for mid
terms.
In a crucial PSC game Sunday in
Fresno, the Fresno State Bulldogs
defeated the University of San
Francisco 1-0, and dealt a crippling
blow to Stanford's chances of win
ning the PSC championship.
The victory was the Bulldogs'
record to 6-0 in the PSC, with only
one game left to play in the confer
ence (against San Jose State Satur
day). As a result, Stanford can now
only tie Fresno for first place. The
Cardinal must defeat both California
and the University of the Pacific
next week, while Fresno State
must lose to San Jose State.
