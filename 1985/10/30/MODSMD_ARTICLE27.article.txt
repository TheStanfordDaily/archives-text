# Polls Pick Stanford Spikers No. 1
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volleyball team,
inactive since its last match on Oct. 19,
regained the No. 1 spot in this week's Tac
hikara Poll yesterday and retained the top
ranking in the NCAA Poll.
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo — which hacl
taken the No. 1 ranking away from the
Cardinal in the Tachikara Poll last week —
dropped two matches during the past
week, prompting the committee to choose
Stanford once again as the top team in the
nation.
The Cardinal women — 15-1 on the

season — received 30 of the 46 first-place
votes in the Tachikara Poll. The Cardinal
was followed in the poll by UCLA and
University of the Pacific with San Luis
Obispo falling to the fourth spot.
In the NCAA Poll, Stanford notched 158
points, just five ahead of second-ranked
UOP. UCLA and San Luis Obispo followed,
with San Jose State ranked fifth.
USC — the Cardinal's opponent this
Friday night at Maples Pavilion — is ranked
seventh in the Tachikara Poll and eighth in
the NCAA Poll. Last week the Trojans up
set the San Luis Obispo women, knocking
them out of Tachikara's No. 1 spot.
On Sept. 28, the Cardinal women swept

USC in Los Angeles, 15-4, 15-8, 15-7.
However, the Trojan women were playing
without their two top setters that day, and
they figure to be much better Friday.
USC senior Tracy Clark leads the nation
in kills, averaging 5.5 per game. She also
averages 3.4 digs per game, tops on the
Trojan team.
Sophomore Yvonne Lewis and senior
Leslie Devereaux have had impressive hit
ting years thus far for the Trojans. Lewis
has a .542 hitting percentage this season
and Devereaux is hitting at a .454 clip.
Friday's match will be an important Pac-
West confrontation. Stanford is currently
atop the league standings at 3-1 with USC
just one game back at 2-2.

Saturday night the Cardinal will have an
opportunity to avenge its only loss of the
season as No. 10 Arizona State travels to
the Farm.
The Sun Devils stunned an undefeated
Stanford on Oct. 18 in Tempe. The Card
inal had several chances to win that match,
but ASU rallied to win by scores of 15-13,
5-15, 13-15, 15-11 and 16-14 before a
standing room only crowd.
Sun Devil Tammy Webb excelled in the
upset, recording 28 kills, 20 digs, seven
block solos and three service aces. She was
honored as the Pac-West Athlete of the
Week following the match.
Surprisingly, the victory over Stanford
remains as ASU's lone conference victory.
