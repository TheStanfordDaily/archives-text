Carey White says: "We
have to hassle the shit out of
you anyway, so why not get
some of it over with now?"
Now there's an idea! If
your group is planning on
getting major funding for
next year, why not come in
and see what questions
people have about your
programming? It's a good
chance for you to find out
what our quibbles are,
it's good grilling practice for
us.
It might help down the
road to find out now what
you'll be up against (big, evil
Appropriations Committee
people like Sally Terry),
especially if you're planning ?
on doing something that
we've never funded before
(the Senate hates it when
there pren't any precedents)
or if you've never applied
for annual funding or a
special fee yourself.
Call up Eugene Chen,
Program Board director, at
329-8460 if you have
questions about annual
funding. For special fees,
talk to Jim DeLaHunt,
Appropriations Chair. His
phone number is 853-1661.
We'll be sending out
letters and publicizing the
application deadline (which
is January 24, 1986) in a
few weeks. But if you have
any questions or doubts in
your minds, it can't hurt to
get a head start now. Come
in and talk to us as soon as
you like. We don't bite.
Very hard.
