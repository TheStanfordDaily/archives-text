# RETURN OF THE SECOND COMING OF THE SON OF GRADUATE ELECTIONS-PART THREE
## 
### 
Ow, my brain hurts. I'm
having deja-vu and amnesia
at the same time. I'm stealing
other people's jokes.
Why? Becuase graduate
elections aren't funny. But
they should be. Reme-mber
how we told you there was
gonna be a graduate election
on October 29 and 30? You
probably didn't notice, but we
didn't have one.
Oh, stop blubbering. We
wouldn't let you down. Not
us. Not the ASSU. We've re
scheduled the graduate elec
tion. It just sorta seemed like
the thing to do. The new elec
tion will be held next Tuesday
and Wednesday, November 5
and 6. Bet you can't wait. I
know I can't.
Here's where and when you
can vote:
