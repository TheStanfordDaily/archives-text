# TV Time Change

It was announced earlier this week that Stanford's home game against 112
Oregon State on Nov. 9 will be televised by cable station WTBS, the •
Turner Network.
The kickoff time for the Cardinal-Beaver matchup has been moved from
1:30 p.m. to 5:15. That means that artificial lights, like those used during
last year's game with USC, will be brought in.
Stanford Athletic Director Andy Geiger said the lighting would not be
nearly as elaborate as it was for the Super Bowl, but costs were not made •
available. He said that WTBS paid $400,000 for the rights to the broadcast,
of which Stanford would receive about $120,000.
Geiger did not expect that the switch would produce outrage among in
convenienced ticket holders. "I'm sure there'll be some six-hour tailgate
parties," he said.
