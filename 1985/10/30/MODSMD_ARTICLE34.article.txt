Weinberger Accuses Soviets
BRUSSELS, Belguim — U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger yesterday accused the Soviet Union of clear violations of
Soviet-American arms control agreements.
Weinberger backed up his accusations, made at a North Atlantic
Treaty Organization nuclear planning group meeting with top-secret
satellite photographs.
The material purported to show that the Soviet Union recently
began deploying new SS-25 missiles in at least three sites, in viola
tion of the 1979 SALT-11.
Manfred Woerner of West Germany described the accusations as
"convincing." But neither he nor any of the other 13 ministers said
that Soviet violations entitled the United States to ignore the terms
of the treaties or to interpret them more widely than before, confer
ence sources said.
Weinberger said that contrary to Soviet claims the SS-25s were
not modernized versions of the SS-13 and were therefore not per
mitted under SALT 11.
The new missile's range of around 6,200 miles was well over 5
percent greater than that of the SS-13, the length was 10 percent
greater, diameter, 11 percent more and carrying load, 92 percent
higher.
Craxi Revives Coalition in Italy
ROME — Prime Minister-designate Bettino Craxi appeared yes
terday to have succeeded in resurrecting the five-party government
that collapsed two weeks ago in the wake of the Achille Lauro affair.
Craxi was reported to have won the agreement of all five parties
to employ an unprecedented constitutional shortcut that would
reinstate his old government, in effect, as if it had not fallen.
Under pressure from President Francesco Cossiga to hasten a
resolution of the government crisis in order to get to work on press
ing economic legislation, Craxi and the party leaders devised a
scheme that will bypass the time-consuming formality of interparty
negotiations normally needed to form a new government.
Instead, Craxi will simply retract the resignation he submitted to
Cossiga Oct. 17 and ask Parliament for a vote of confidence to sus
tain his old coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Republicans,
Social Democrats and Liberals.
Constitutional experts said that although the shortcut has not been
attempted before, it was permissible because Cossiga accepted the
Craxi government's resignation with "reserve," a constitutional
hedge meaning it was not considered final until a new government
was formed. Thus, withdrawal of the resignation and a vote of confi
dence would have the technical effect of restoring the old govern
ment to life.
Sandinista Emergency Assailed
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Six Nicaraguan political parties, includ
ing the Communists and Socialists, demanded yesterday that the
leftist Sandinista government lift an official state of emergency.
The demand, set out in a joint statement, was an unusual show of
unity against government policy by parties that have generally
backed the Sandinista revolution as well as others that have opposed
it.
The Communists and Socialists, both small parties, continue to
support the Sandinista revolution but in recent months have become
increasingly critical of the Sandinista leadership.
On Oct. 15, the government issued a decree that broadened the
three-year-old state of emergency, suspending guarantees of civil
liberties such as freedom of expression, freedom to travel in the
country and the right to assemble peacefully.
The Communists, Socialists and four other parties said in their
statement that the state of emergency "denies and obstructs" politi
cal pluralism in Nicaragua. They said it does not promote peace be
tween the Sandinistas and U.S.-backed rebels because it closes
avenues of peaceful opposition.
Arafat Demands Role for PLO
AMMAN, Jordan — Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said yester
day there would be no peace in the Middle East without the participa
tion of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Arafat appeared at a crowded news conference a day after holding
lengthy talks with Jordan's King Hussein, amid continuing specula
tion that the Jordanian monarch may be pressuring the PLO to make
concessions to get peace talks with Israel rolling before the end of
the year.
But Arafat appeared surprisingly defiant and said that he was not
prepared to accept American conditions in order to join the peace
process. "I'm not begging for qualifications from anybody," he said.
The United States has insisted that it will not talk directly with the
PLO until the organization explicitly accepts Israel's right to exist
and accepts two key U.N. Security Council resolutions — 242 and
338 — which guarantee the security of all states in the region.
Zulu Leader Killed in S. Africa *
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — A prominent Zulu politician
was assassinated outside his home near Durban early yesterday in
the continuing feuding among South Africa's black groups for leader
ship of the anti-apartheid struggle.
Francis Dlamini, a member of the central committee of the
predominantly Zulu political movement Inkatha, led by Chief Man
gosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, was killed by by multiple shotgun blasts
when he fled his home after it had been set on fire.
Four other persons, three blacks and a mixed-race Colored, died
in other violence, according to police, as security forces sought to
quell the continuing unrest around Cape Town and in eastern Cape
province.
Dlamini's assassination, the latest in a series of politically inspired
murders and assaults around Durban, raised fears of renewed large
scale clashes there between Inkatha members and supporters of the
rival United Democratic Front and the outlawed African National
Congress.
Liberian Leader Claims Victory
MONROVIA, Liberia — Samuel Doe, the former army sergeant
who five years ago shot his way out of obscurity to become Africa's
youngest head of state, was named the winner yesterday in an elec
tion that he hopes will legitimize his rule.
The announcement of Doe's victory was not unexpected, but it is
unlikely to win him the international credibility he sought.
In the eyes of many resident diplomats, most of his opponents and
what appears to be a broad spectrum of the Liberian public, his elec
tion to a six-year term as president was the result of one of the most
blatant vote frauds in recent African history.

avenues of peaceful opposition.
Arafat Demands Role for PLO
AMMAN, Jordan — Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said yester
day there would be no peace in the Middle East without the participa
tion of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Arafat appeared at a crowded news conference a day after holding
lengthy talks with Jordan's King Hussein, amid continuing specula
tion that the Jordanian monarch may be pressuring the PLO to make
concessions to get peace talks with Israel rolling before the end of
the year.
But Arafat appeared surprisingly defiant and said that he was not
prepared to accept American conditions in order to join the peace
process. "I'm not begging for qualifications from anybody," he said.
The United States has insisted that it will not talk directly with the
PLO until the organization explicitly accepts Israel's right to exist
and accepts two key U.N. Security Council resolutions — 242 and
338 — which guarantee the security of all states in the region.
Zulu Leader Killed in S. Africa *
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — A prominent Zulu politician
was assassinated outside his home near Durban early yesterday in
the continuing feuding among South Africa's black groups for leader
ship of the anti-apartheid struggle.
Francis Dlamini, a member of the central committee of the
predominantly Zulu political movement Inkatha, led by Chief Man
gosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, was killed by by multiple shotgun blasts
when he fled his home after it had been set on fire.
Four other persons, three blacks and a mixed-race Colored, died
in other violence, according to police, as security forces sought to
quell the continuing unrest around Cape Town and in eastern Cape
province.
Dlamini's assassination, the latest in a series of politically inspired
murders and assaults around Durban, raised fears of renewed large
scale clashes there between Inkatha members and supporters of the
rival United Democratic Front and the outlawed African National
Congress.
Liberian Leader Claims Victory
MONROVIA, Liberia — Samuel Doe, the former army sergeant
who five years ago shot his way out of obscurity to become Africa's
youngest head of state, was named the winner yesterday in an elec
tion that he hopes will legitimize his rule.
The announcement of Doe's victory was not unexpected, but it is
unlikely to win him the international credibility he sought.
In the eyes of many resident diplomats, most of his opponents and
what appears to be a broad spectrum of the Liberian public, his elec
tion to a six-year term as president was the result of one of the most
blatant vote frauds in recent African history.
Weinberger Accuses Soviets
BRUSSELS, Belguim — U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger yesterday accused the Soviet Union of clear violations of
Soviet-American arms control agreements.
Weinberger backed up his accusations, made at a North Atlantic
Treaty Organization nuclear planning group meeting with top-secret
satellite photographs.
The material purported to show that the Soviet Union recently
began deploying new SS-25 missiles in at least three sites, in viola
tion of the 1979 SALT-11.
Manfred Woerner of West Germany described the accusations as
"convincing." But neither he nor any of the other 13 ministers said
that Soviet violations entitled the United States to ignore the terms
of the treaties or to interpret them more widely than before, confer
ence sources said.
Weinberger said that contrary to Soviet claims the SS-25s were
not modernized versions of the SS-13 and were therefore not per
mitted under SALT 11.
The new missile's range of around 6,200 miles was well over 5
percent greater than that of the SS-13, the length was 10 percent
greater, diameter, 11 percent more and carrying load, 92 percent
higher.
Craxi Revives Coalition in Italy
ROME — Prime Minister-designate Bettino Craxi appeared yes
terday to have succeeded in resurrecting the five-party government
that collapsed two weeks ago in the wake of the Achille Lauro affair.
Craxi was reported to have won the agreement of all five parties
to employ an unprecedented constitutional shortcut that would
reinstate his old government, in effect, as if it had not fallen.
Under pressure from President Francesco Cossiga to hasten a
resolution of the government crisis in order to get to work on press
ing economic legislation, Craxi and the party leaders devised a
scheme that will bypass the time-consuming formality of interparty
negotiations normally needed to form a new government.
Instead, Craxi will simply retract the resignation he submitted to
Cossiga Oct. 17 and ask Parliament for a vote of confidence to sus
tain his old coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Republicans,
Social Democrats and Liberals.
Constitutional experts said that although the shortcut has not been
attempted before, it was permissible because Cossiga accepted the
Craxi government's resignation with "reserve," a constitutional
hedge meaning it was not considered final until a new government
was formed. Thus, withdrawal of the resignation and a vote of confi
dence would have the technical effect of restoring the old govern
ment to life.
Sandinista Emergency Assailed
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Six Nicaraguan political parties, includ
ing the Communists and Socialists, demanded yesterday that the
leftist Sandinista government lift an official state of emergency.
The demand, set out in a joint statement, was an unusual show of
unity against government policy by parties that have generally
backed the Sandinista revolution as well as others that have opposed
it.
The Communists and Socialists, both small parties, continue to
support the Sandinista revolution but in recent months have become
increasingly critical of the Sandinista leadership.
On Oct. 15, the government issued a decree that broadened the
three-year-old state of emergency, suspending guarantees of civil
liberties such as freedom of expression, freedom to travel in the
country and the right to assemble peacefully.
The Communists, Socialists and four other parties said in their
statement that the state of emergency "denies and obstructs" politi
cal pluralism in Nicaragua. They said it does not promote peace be
tween the Sandinistas and U.S.-backed rebels because it closes
avenues of peaceful opposition.
