# U.S. Assails Soviet Radar Proposal
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administra
tion yesterday dismissed as "inequitable and un
acceptable" a Soviet proposal to stop construc
tion on a radar site in Central Siberia if the U.S.
would stop modernizing radar devices in Britain
and Greenland.
The Soviet offer was the latest in a series of
informal probes to test Washington's willingness
to compromise before the Nov. 19-20 summit
between President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev.
An Administration official referred to it as
"talk on the margins" that is conveyed through
channels outside the formal arms negotiations in
Geneva. Before the Soviet proposal was made
public yesterday, U.S. negotiators there had
already rejected it.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes, in
explaining the rejection, said upgrading of the
U.S. installations in Britain and Greenland is le

gal because the radars were in place before the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty was signed in 1972.
"It was grandfathered by the treaty," said an of
ficial. "The Soviets have never taken issue with
it."
But Washington long has considered the So
viet site at Krasnoyarsk, deep in Siberia, to be a
violation of the ABM treaty because it is so far
inland and occupies 2,480 miles of Soviet terri
tory. The treaty allows such large radar equip
ment only on the periphery of a country but for
bids it inland where it is more likely to be used
for military purposes.
The Soviets claim their Krasnoyarsk radar
tracks space satellites. But because it is pointed
northeastward, one U.S. official said, it can
"see" only a fraction, perhaps 15 per cent, of So
viet satellites in orbit.
The official insisted that the Soviets, merely

by putting forward the proposal, "recognize in
principle the illegitimacy of that radar."
Although the Reagan Administration clearly
considered the proposal a lopsided trade, there
nevertheless is widespread concern within the
Administration that the Soviets may have scored
propaganda points by appearing willing to com
promise as the Reagan-Gorbachev summit ap
proaches. A top White House official pointed out
that most people are not familiar enough with the
terms of the ABM treaty to judge the unfairness
of the offer.
U.S. officials are irked by the recent Soviet
tendency to publicize every chess move rather
than to bring ideas quietly to Geneva, where
arms negotiations have been under way since
early this year. "Our real response should be in
Geneva. That's the appropriate negotiating
venue," one official said with annoyance.
