# Soviets To Release Sakharov's Wife
## 
### 
MOSCOW — The Kremlin's re
ported decision to allow the wife of
exiled physicist Andrei Sakharov to
go abroad for medical treatment
was interpreted here yesterday as
a gesture intended to put the Soviet
Union in a favorable light before
next month's summit meeting.
Confirmation that Yelena Bon
ner, Sakharov's wife, will be
allowed to leave the country for
three months came a day after an
other Soviet human rights activist
once imprisoned for investigating
Soviet abuses of psychiatry was
permitted to emigrate to the Neth
erlands.
Further moves to polish Mos
cow's human rights record are an
ticipated in the three weeks before

Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
meets President Reagan in
Geneva.
Reagan already has served notice
that he will raise questions about
the Sakharovs' internal exile to the
city of Gorky, 250 miles from Mos
cow, and other human rights issues
at the summit conference Nov. 19-
20. Gorbachev was forced to field
questions from French officials and
from newsmen about Sakharov and
other human rights matters during
a visit to France early this month.
While he has been combative on
the subject in recent interviews,
Gorbachev was expected to relent
slightly as the meeting with Reagan
approaches.
One Western diplomat said a So

viet citizen with close ties to high
government officials told him
recently: "You can expect a lot of
people to go (out of the Soviet
Union) before Geneva."
Other Western analysts were
more skeptical about any major
shift in the Soviet policy that has
blocked emigration for critics of the
regime and Jews who want to move
to Israel.
The granting of a visa to Bonner
so she can undergo eye surgery
abroad was confirmed yesterday by
Victor Louis, a journalist who has
been a source of official information
on the Sakharovs in the past.
"It's not a one-way ticket —
she's going and she's expected to

be back," Louis told a reporter.
There were reports from
Vienna, however, that Bonner
would not be permitted to return to
the Soviet Union. The Austria
Press Agency, quoting Soviet
emigres and sources in Amnesty
International, said Bonner was re
quired to leave the Soviet Union
within two days and could not
return to her husband.
Bonner, 62, is serving a term of
five years' internal exile in Gorky,
the same city where Sakharov was
banished in 1980 because of his out
spoken human rights stance and his
opposition to the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan. Sakharov won the
1975 Nobel Peace Prize because of
his human rights campaign.
