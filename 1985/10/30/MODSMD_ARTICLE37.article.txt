Defense Funding OK'd
WASHINGTON — The House approved
and sent to President Reagan yesterday a
House-Senate compromise that authorized
defense spending to grow with inflation this
year to $302.6 bllion but with a provision that
House Democrats hoped would keep spending
$10 billion lower.
Although many House Democrats were cri
tical of the increase, they supported the au
thorization bill — which had been agreed to by
conferees of both houses last July — because
the House adopted a rule that would allow a
single congressman to block any appropria
tions bill that would boost military spending
this year above last year's level of $292.6 bil
lion.
Authorization bills merely provide ceilings
for spending; actual budget levels are then set
by appropriations bills, and the House will take
up the defense appropriations bill today. It will
raise a separate set of controversial issues of
defense spending priorities.
Juan Jolts Louisiana
NEW ORLEANS — Remnants of Hurricane
Juan continued yesterday evening to batter
storm-weary Louisiana residents, who have
been hit with a record three hurricanes so far
this year.
Torrential rains and high tides from the
storm covered much of the southern part of
the state.

At least three persons died in Hurricane
Juan and four were reported missing. Three
workers were trapped in a drilling rig that
capsized early yesterday six miles offshore
from Hopedale, a fishing community near the
tip of the St. Bernard Parish peninsula. The
fourth missing person, a wind surfer, was last
seen on Lake Pontchartrain, the Coast Guard
said.
Juan came ashore early yesterday with
heavy rain and 85 mph winds whipping off
shore waves 20 feet high and driving tides up
to 10 feet above normal against inland levees.
Widespread flooding was reported through
out the low-lying coastal areas, including por
tions of metropolitan New Orleans, as a result
of Juan's rains. One of the hardest hit areas
was Terrebonne Parish, located southwest of
New Orleans.
The National Weather Service said the
storm system was moving slowly to the west
and was expected to head north sometime
today.
Banks Support Plan
WASHINGTON — A group of 58 major
commercial banks from around the world gave
general support yesterday to a Reagan Admin
istration proposal that they hope will help ease
the international debt crisis by increasing loans
to Third World debtors.
But the banks stopped short of committing
themselves to coming up with a further $29 bil
lion in the next three years, as called for in the

proposal advanced Oct. 8 by Secretary of the
Treasury James Baker.
In a statement issued through the Institute
of International Finance, a Washington-based
organization set up by the banks to monitor the
international debt situation, the member banks
called for further study of Baker's proposal and
for extended consultations with their own gov
ernments and the debtor governments.
The banks stressed that their "general sup
port" for Baker's plan depends on a coor
dinated effort that would give an expanded role
to the World Bank and other international de
velopment banks, to the debtor nations them
selves and to the governments of the industri
alized countries in which the banks are based.
Soviet Not To Defect
WASHINGTON — A Soviet seaman who
twice jumped from his ship into the Mississippi
River near New Orleans in an apparent at
tempt to defect assured U.S. officials yester
day that he wanted to go home, and after sign
ing a statement to that effect, returned to the
vessel.
"The United States government considers
this matter closed," the State Department said
yesterday night at the conclusion of a lengthy
statement recounting its efforts since Friday
to ensure that the sailor, Miroslav Medvid, had
been given every opportunity to gain asylum.
The length and minute details of the state
ment underscored Administration awareness
of the case's potential sensitivity.
