Bird Defends Court
SAN FRANCISCO — Chief Justice Rose
Bird says the campaign to defeat her next year
is an attempt to impose a right-wing "litmus
test" on the state Supreme Court.
In an interview published yesterday in a
copyright story by the Times Tribune in Palo
Alto, Bird spoke out publicly for the first time
about the campaign to deny her a new 12-year
term, and also about the death penalty, a focal
point of her opponents' criticism.
The chief justice, who got a record-low 51.7
percent of the vote in winning her first reten
tion election in 1978, is one of six Supreme
Court justices scheduled to be on the ballot for
yes-or-no votes in November 1986. A
conservative-led opposition campaign is tar
geting Bird and Justices Cruz Reynoso and
Joseph Grodin, all appointed by former Gov.
Jerry Brown.
Also on the ballot will be Justice Malcolm
Lucas, Gov. George Deukmejian's only cur
rent appointee, along with the successor

Deukmejian picks for recently retired Justice
Otto Kaus. Justice Stanley Mosk, appointed by
former Gov. Pat Brown, is scheduled to be on
the ballot but says he may retire.
"For eight years the right wing has been at
tacking me and consistently so, and I under
stand why," Bird, who was appointed in
February 1977, told the Times Tribune.
"They would like a chief justice who shares
their views, who would pass all their litmus
tests, and they would like a majority of the
court sitting here to be mirror images of them
selves."
Second Blow to Mayor
SAN DIEGO — Much of the evidence
detailing jury tampering allegations in Mayor
Roger Hedgecock's bid for a new trial has been
rejected as inadmissible hearsay by the trial
judge.
In a series of blows to Hedgecock's hopes of
having his felony conviction thrown out, Su
perior Court Judge William Todd ruled he can

not be called as a witness to testify at Mon
day's motion hearing for a new trial and
quashed the subpoena issued to him by
defense attorney Oscar Goodman.
Todd, who presided over both of
Hedgecock's trials, also turned down a
defense request that he remove himself from
presiding over the hearing Monday.
Goodman had asked for a new trial based on
sworn statements from juror Kathy Saxton-
Calderwood and an attorney for juror Stanley
Bohensky, alleging a court bailiff interfered
with the deliberations leading to Hedgecock's
Oct. 9 conviction.
An appeal to Todd's ruling was being
prepared yesterday, said attorney Michael
Pancer, who represents Hedgecock. He
said the appeal would be filed with the 4th Dis
trict Court of Appeals.
Hedgecock, 39, was found guilty of one con
spiracy count and 12 perjury counts in a
campaign-finance case. He faces an automatic
oust from office, a fine and a maximum eight
year prison term upon sentencing, set for
Nov. 6.
