# Thefts Plague Campus Dorms

Three thefts at Roble Hall and
one at Madera House occurred on
Monday, adding to the recent rash
of burglaries from campus
residences, according to Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
The stolen articles, ranging from
petty cash to a video cassette
recorder, add to the estimated
$56,546 in goods stolen on campus
since Jan. 1. Stanford police
reached that figure using the vic
tims' estimates, according to
Niemeyer.
The police have not identified any
suspects in the recent burglaries,
Niemeyer said. John Suppes, ar
rested last week for a burglary in
Columbae House, remains in the
Santa Clara County Jail.
Suppes is the son of Stanford
Philosophy Prof. Patrick Suppes,

who had no comment yesterday.
Suppes was arraigned in the Palo
Alto Municipal Court yesterday for
burglary and resisting arrest, ac
cording to a county jail booking
clerk, who asked not to be identi
fied.
"We've put together a few more
cases against [Suppes]," said
Niemeyer. "There are two con
firmed identifications, so there are
two additional counts.
"Then there are two more highly
probable [identifications]. . . . That
(whether to prosecute Suppes for
those two crimes) is up to the dis
trict attorney," Niemeyer said.
"There is also another possibility
[because of an incident in which]
. . . campus police picked him up
and he had an Olympus camera in
his possession," Niemeyer said.
"Two people are missing an
Olympus camera; we're still trying
to identify it."
Most of the burglaries have been
made easier because of unlocked
doors, according to Niemeyer.
Suppes now has two Superior
Court cases pending. The next
court date is Nov. 12, according to
the clerk.
The bail for those two cases
amounts to $12,500. A sum of
$7,500 was set for bail in a case of
petty theft. The remaining $5,000 is
for bail in a case involving "petty
theft and possession of stolen prop
erty and being under the influence
of a controlled substance," the
clerk said.
"It's hard to say how long he'll be
in [jail]," the clerk added.
Stanford police tried to obtain a
search warrant for the motel room
that Suppes lived in before the ar
rest, but were unsuccessful. "We
do not have enough evidence at this
point," Niemeyer said.
Suppes was reportedly living at
the motel with his wife and a male
friend, whom the police have
treated as potential suspects in the
rash of burglaries.
"I figure that Suppes is respon
sible for the wallets and small

items. He used a backpack,"
Niemeyer said.
Stanford police allegedly found a
stolen Walkman cassette player and
one tape in Suppes' backpack when
they searched it Oct. 23 in connec
tion with the Columbae burglary.
"The other [burglars] are just
carrying stuff off," Niemeyer said.
Sophomore Chris Fialko's stereo
was stolen from his room in Roble
Hall on Monday. "I left my room at
12:05 p.m. A construction worker
. . . saw a guy leave with a stereo
around 12:10. It was probably
mine," Fialko said.
