# Study Shows Self-Administered Painkillers Viable
## 
### LYNN MARCUS Senior staff writer 
Self-administration of painkillers by cancer
victims and surgical patients will become
"commonplace" in hospitals within the next
five years, according to a Stanford anes
thesiologist.
Dr. Paul White, assistant professor of
anesthesia, said that three years of clinical
trials with about 250 post-surgical patients
have proven the effectiveness of patient
controlled analgesia devices.
The devices, which have only become
commercially available within the last few
years, have proven effective in reducing pa

tient anxiety and increasing the efficiency of
post-operative therapy, White said.
Patients can use the machines to release
small doses of painkiller into intravenous
tubing as needed. A patient presses a button
at the end of a cord attached to the machine
to activate it.
To ensure that patients do not overmed
icate themselves, a timer built into the
computer-programmed machine deactivates
the device for a period of between five and 15
minutes after the pain medication is adminis
tered .
With nurse-administered drugs, the time
from the patient's request for painkiller to the
time it takes effect is "routinely an hour and
can be as long as two," White said.

He explained that usually, a patient must
request a painkiller and then wait while a
nurse judges the amount of medicine needed,
goes to a locked cabinet, draws out the drug,
signs for it and returns to administer the
drug. During nursing shift changes, nurses
are busy making reports and are less accessi
ble, he added.
Once administered, painkillers require be
tween 15 and 60 minutes to take effect, White
said.
Patient-controlled analgesia not only allows
for more immediate pain relief but also
prevents the development of a "positive feed
back situation" in which pain leads to anxiety
which actually increases the pain, he said.

"More anxious patients have more pain and
higher requirements for post-operative anal
gesia."
Anxiety is also reduced because a patient
doesn't have to anticipate painkiller needs in
preparation for nurse shift changes or for
times when he or she may need to get up.
White said that sometimes a patient without
the device must ask himself, 4 "Do I ask for a
shot when I don't need it or do I gut it out and
wait?' "
He said the amount of painkiller used by
patients in the trials was "probably somewhat
less" than that used by most patients.
In addition, the machines save
time for nurses and therapists be
cause when patients administer
their own painkillers, therapists do
not have to administer painkillers
and then return in an hour to start
physical therapy, White said.
According to White, the devices
have been used for therapy in Eng
land and Canada for five or six years
but are only now becoming com
mercially available in the United
States. Each unit costs between
$1,500 and $3,000, but White said
some community hospitals are
leasing them for about $80 a month.
Stanford has between 10 and 15
of the machines in use now and will
be acquiring more soon.
White added that early versions
of the devices had been developed
at Stanford for use in research
studies on accessing pain medica
tion 15 years ago, but were not
considered safe enough to replace
nurse administration of analgesia.
The demonstrated safety and
success of the modern machines
combined with their newly
"affordable price" will soon result in
much more widespread use, White
predicted.
