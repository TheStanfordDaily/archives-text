### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
Divestment protests at U.S. universities and
withdrawals by foreign investors are having a des
tabilizing effect in South Africa that is "essential" to
bringing about change in that country's racist apartheid
system, according to a white member of the outlawed
African National Congress (ANC).
"The divestment issue is extraordinarily important
because the situation in the country is getting increas
ingly critical, and any pressure from outside is seen (by
South Africans) as pressure ... to eradicate apart
heid," Ben Turok, a native South African, said in an in
terview following a noontime presentation before about
50 at the Bechtel International Center.
Turok, now a senior lecturer at the Free University
in the United Kingdom, said, "No matter what kind of
protests people undertake, they should not underes
timate the effect of their protests" on the situation in
South Africa.
"There is a lot of evidence that external pressure
(on the South African government) has had an ef
fect. . . . The international protest is creating a sense

that apartheid cannot continue in its present form," he
added.
Turok, who is in the middle of a two-week lecture
tour of seven U.S. universities, said that he is
"astounded to see the scale of interest in South Africa
(on U.S. campuses). There's an amazing heightening
of awareness on this issue. It's a movement that does
great credit to the American public."
Turok said that the threat of divestment by univer
sities and corporations is "deepening the pressure
from outside" and creating a sense of isolation in white
South Africa.
University anti-apartheid demonstrations such as
the recent incidents of civil disobedience at Stanford
are reported prominently in the South African press,
according to Turok. "Even small protests here are
given front page treatment," he said.
He added that "the sensitivity (of the press) reflects
a real concern" over foreign pressure.
Turok said the argument that investments in South
Africa might be used as leverage to force the South
African government to reform — one of the arguments
against total divestment repeatedly made by Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy — is a "pipe dream"

Ben Turok, a native South African and member of the outlawed
African National Congress, praised U.S. divestment efforts in a
speech at Bechtel International Center yesterday.
and "very hard to substantiate."
"Foreign capital has been in
South Africa since the word 'go.'
The evidence is that foreign invest
ment has been part and parcel of
creating a cheap labor system. . . .
To argue that these days happen to
be different has yet to be demon
strated," Turok said.
He added that recent divestment
by Columbia University and
withdrawal from South Africa by
Motorola Corp. and the Chase Man
hattan Bank have led to "great anx

iety" on the part of the white popu
lation there.
Because of those actions, whites
received a message that "their
friends are deserting them," while
blacks "read it in the reverse way,"
according to Turok.
He also countered the argument
that South African blacks will be
hurt by unemployment if U.S. com
panies withdraw their interests,
saying, "We know that [withdrawal]
will have a far greater effect on
white jobs than black jobs."
Turok added that foreigners "not
only have the right but have the
moral duty" to interfere in South
Africa to help bring about change.
A native of Johannesburg, Turok
was a member of the South African
Congress of Democrats, the white
equivalent to the ANC, for five
years until the organization was
banned in 1962. He then became a
member of the secretariat of the
Congress Aliance, another radical
organization committed to bringing
an end to racism in South Africa, he
said.
Turok is now a member of the
ANC despite the fact that he has
not been to his native land for 19
years.
In 1966, he fled to England after
being placed under house arrest for
political activity.
