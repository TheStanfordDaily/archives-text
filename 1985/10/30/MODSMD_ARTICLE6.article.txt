Divestment protests at U.S. universities and
withdrawals by foreign investors are having a des
tabilizing effect in South Africa that is "essential" to
bringing about change in that country's racist apartheid
system, according to a white member of the outlawed
African National Congress (ANC).
"The divestment issue is extraordinarily important
because the situation in the country is getting increas
ingly critical, and any pressure from outside is seen (by
South Africans) as pressure ... to eradicate apart
heid," Ben Turok, a native South African, said in an in
terview following a noontime presentation before about
50 at the Bechtel International Center.
Turok, now a senior lecturer at the Free University
in the United Kingdom, said, "No matter what kind of
protests people undertake, they should not underes
timate the effect of their protests" on the situation in
South Africa.
"There is a lot of evidence that external pressure
(on the South African government) has had an ef
fect. . . . The international protest is creating a sense

that apartheid cannot continue in its present form," he
added.
Turok, who is in the middle of a two-week lecture
tour of seven U.S. universities, said that he is
"astounded to see the scale of interest in South Africa
(on U.S. campuses). There's an amazing heightening
of awareness on this issue. It's a movement that does
great credit to the American public."
Turok said that the threat of divestment by univer
sities and corporations is "deepening the pressure
from outside" and creating a sense of isolation in white
South Africa.
University anti-apartheid demonstrations such as
the recent incidents of civil disobedience at Stanford
are reported prominently in the South African press,
according to Turok. "Even small protests here are
given front page treatment," he said.
He added that "the sensitivity (of the press) reflects
a real concern" over foreign pressure.
Turok said the argument that investments in South
Africa might be used as leverage to force the South
African government to reform — one of the arguments
against total divestment repeatedly made by Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy — is a "pipe dream"
