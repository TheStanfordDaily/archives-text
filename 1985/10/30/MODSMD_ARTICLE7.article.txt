# Students Dig Up Museum Displays
## 
### MICHAEL NEWMAN 
Most of you probably think that the only
museum on campus is the one down by the Oval,
the one with all the Rodin sculptures in it.
Well, look at your map again. Squint a little.
Maybe you can't see it. It's kind of small, and not
a whole lot of people know about it.
Instead of paintings and Stanford family arti
facts, this museum has exhibits on metallurgy
and glassmaking. And there's only one gallery to
hike through.
Tucked away in the corner of Bldg. 110 in the
Quad, Stanford's Anthropology Museum differs
from that other museum on campus in a lot more
ways than just size and popularity.
Though it is smaller and less well-known than
the Stanford Museum of Art, the Anthropology
Museum is a student museum: The exhibits in it
are conceived, designed and constructed by stu
dents.
"It's really a good situation," said Priscilla
Murray, the director of the museum and co
instructor with Prof. Emeritus Bert Gerow of a
class in museum methods (Anthropology 195).
"Depending on the interest of the student, we
can offer much food for thought," she said.
And those interests vary. One exhibit cur
rently on display in the museum contains ancient

pottery from Japan and Peru. Another project
displays models of canoes used in Micronesia.
Yet another installation chronicles the evolution
of modern man with skulls found in Africa.
Chris Martin, a sophomore anthropology
major and one of two students working on an ex
hibit this quarter, is very pleased with Anthro
pology 195.
While his project on the featherworking of the
Caraja Indians of Brazil is still "on the drawing
board," he said of the course, "It's very interest
ing, kind of like cultural arts and crafts."
Martin plans to finish his exhibit by the end of
the quarter.
Murray is also enthusiastic. "We have all sorts
of neat stuff," she said. "Only a fraction of our
collection is actually on display. Much, much
more is stored in the basement of the Stanford
Museum (of Art)."
That's understandable — there's hardly room
in the small museum for the 10,000 or so arti
facts in Stanford's collection.
While Murray assists students with their proj
ects and oversees the day-to-day operations of
the museum — it also hosts a Friday film series
and numerous discussion sections — Gerow
works mostly in the basement of the Stanford
Museum of Art, cataloguing the sizeable collec
tion and dating artifacts.
Gerow, who has been at Stanford for almost

40 years, can remember when the Anthropology
Museum used to be part of the main museum.
"Now we're sort of like tenants," he said.
The Stanford Museum was closed during
World War 11. At the end of the war, Gerow and
two other professors — one from the Classics
Department and one from the Art Department—
began to plan its re-opening. Each of the three
departments was to have its own area of the
museum.
As Gerow recalls the story, the museum was
chronically short of funds, and sometimes this
forced them to sell some of the collection.
"A lot of the paintings down at Rickey's
(Hyatt, on El Camino) are from the Stanford
Museum," Gerow said. "We sold them to them in
the early '505."
Gerow also remembers selling about 30 or so
clay bowls to Rickey's, which eventually put
them to use lining its driveway.
Not until 1955, when the museum re-opened,
did the Classics, Art and Anthropology Depart
ments finally plan their exhibits.
With the arrival of a new director in 1964,
however, the Stanford Museum became the
Stanford Art Museum, and the anthropology dis
plays were temporarily without a home. Soon af-
terward the Anthropology
Museum in the Quad was estab
lished.
Among the museum's more
notable holdings are its collection
of African musical instruments, its
Southwestern native American
pottery and some Eskimo kayaks.
The museum's extensive col
lection of Egyptian art, once the
largest of its kind west of the Mis
sissippi, was destroyed in the
1906 earthquake.
That Egyptian art collection,
and many of the museum's other
artifacts, were obtained by Jane
Lathrop Stanford, who was the
administrator of the $30 million
estate that funded the University
in its formative stages.
"Most of the major donations to
the museum were made years
ago," explained Murray. Today
the museum mainly relies on
donations from generous alumni
to maintain its collection. It does,
however, actively collect casts of
fossils for Anthropology 006,
Human Origins.
"In that class, human fossil
casts are a necessity," said Mur
ray. "They create more of an im
pression. Students can poke into
every crevice and look at every
tooth. It's a more direct contact

with culture."
Providing such "visual aids," as
Murray calls them, is one of the
primary purposes of the museum.
There are almost a dozen ex
hibits in the museum now, and
with Martin and another student,

sophomore Lexie Bisbee, en
rolled in Anthropology 195, two
new exhibits will be installed by
the end of the quarter.
The Anthropology Museum is
open Monday through Friday from
9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and students are

"always welcome," according to
Murray.
"The museum really has a lot to
offer," she said.
As Martin put it bluntly, "No
one really knows about it, but it's
an interesting place."

them to use lining its driveway.
Not until 1955, when the museum re-opened,
did the Classics, Art and Anthropology Depart
ments finally plan their exhibits.
With the arrival of a new director in 1964,
however, the Stanford Museum became the
Stanford Art Museum, and the anthropology dis
plays were temporarily without a home. Soon af-
terward the Anthropology
Museum in the Quad was estab
lished.
Among the museum's more
notable holdings are its collection
of African musical instruments, its
Southwestern native American
pottery and some Eskimo kayaks.
The museum's extensive col
lection of Egyptian art, once the
largest of its kind west of the Mis
sissippi, was destroyed in the
1906 earthquake.
That Egyptian art collection,
and many of the museum's other
artifacts, were obtained by Jane
Lathrop Stanford, who was the
administrator of the $30 million
estate that funded the University
in its formative stages.
"Most of the major donations to
the museum were made years
ago," explained Murray. Today
the museum mainly relies on
donations from generous alumni
to maintain its collection. It does,
however, actively collect casts of
fossils for Anthropology 006,
Human Origins.
"In that class, human fossil
casts are a necessity," said Mur
ray. "They create more of an im
pression. Students can poke into
every crevice and look at every
tooth. It's a more direct contact

with culture."
Providing such "visual aids," as
Murray calls them, is one of the
primary purposes of the museum.
There are almost a dozen ex
hibits in the museum now, and
with Martin and another student,

sophomore Lexie Bisbee, en
rolled in Anthropology 195, two
new exhibits will be installed by
the end of the quarter.
The Anthropology Museum is
open Monday through Friday from
9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and students are

"always welcome," according to
Murray.
"The museum really has a lot to
offer," she said.
As Martin put it bluntly, "No
one really knows about it, but it's
an interesting place."

The little-known Anthropology Museum gives showcase space in its small gallery to student
projects from the Anthropology Department's class on museum methods.
Most of you probably think that the only
museum on campus is the one down by the Oval,
the one with all the Rodin sculptures in it.
Well, look at your map again. Squint a little.
Maybe you can't see it. It's kind of small, and not
a whole lot of people know about it.
Instead of paintings and Stanford family arti
facts, this museum has exhibits on metallurgy
and glassmaking. And there's only one gallery to
hike through.
Tucked away in the corner of Bldg. 110 in the
Quad, Stanford's Anthropology Museum differs
from that other museum on campus in a lot more
ways than just size and popularity.
Though it is smaller and less well-known than
the Stanford Museum of Art, the Anthropology
Museum is a student museum: The exhibits in it
are conceived, designed and constructed by stu
dents.
"It's really a good situation," said Priscilla
Murray, the director of the museum and co
instructor with Prof. Emeritus Bert Gerow of a
class in museum methods (Anthropology 195).
"Depending on the interest of the student, we
can offer much food for thought," she said.
And those interests vary. One exhibit cur
rently on display in the museum contains ancient

pottery from Japan and Peru. Another project
displays models of canoes used in Micronesia.
Yet another installation chronicles the evolution
of modern man with skulls found in Africa.
Chris Martin, a sophomore anthropology
major and one of two students working on an ex
hibit this quarter, is very pleased with Anthro
pology 195.
While his project on the featherworking of the
Caraja Indians of Brazil is still "on the drawing
board," he said of the course, "It's very interest
ing, kind of like cultural arts and crafts."
Martin plans to finish his exhibit by the end of
the quarter.
Murray is also enthusiastic. "We have all sorts
of neat stuff," she said. "Only a fraction of our
collection is actually on display. Much, much
more is stored in the basement of the Stanford
Museum (of Art)."
That's understandable — there's hardly room
in the small museum for the 10,000 or so arti
facts in Stanford's collection.
While Murray assists students with their proj
ects and oversees the day-to-day operations of
the museum — it also hosts a Friday film series
and numerous discussion sections — Gerow
works mostly in the basement of the Stanford
Museum of Art, cataloguing the sizeable collec
tion and dating artifacts.
Gerow, who has been at Stanford for almost

40 years, can remember when the Anthropology
Museum used to be part of the main museum.
"Now we're sort of like tenants," he said.
The Stanford Museum was closed during
World War 11. At the end of the war, Gerow and
two other professors — one from the Classics
Department and one from the Art Department—
began to plan its re-opening. Each of the three
departments was to have its own area of the
museum.
As Gerow recalls the story, the museum was
chronically short of funds, and sometimes this
forced them to sell some of the collection.
"A lot of the paintings down at Rickey's
(Hyatt, on El Camino) are from the Stanford
Museum," Gerow said. "We sold them to them in
the early '505."
Gerow also remembers selling about 30 or so
clay bowls to Rickey's, which eventually put
them to use lining its driveway.

ments finally plan their exhibits.
