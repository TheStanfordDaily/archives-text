Charlie, Paige. Paige, Charlie.
Get well, Kaz.
Eggbert is Sheila Kelly. Clint is
the Walrus.
Squirrel knocks out town's
electricity.
So we bea* on, boats against the

current, borne back ceaselessly
into the past.
All I wanted was a Pepsi, and she
wouldn't give it to me.
Angelheaded hipsters burning for
the ancient heavenly connection to
the starry dynamo in the machinery
of night.
Man, if you gotta ask you'll never
know.
