October 29, 1985
Dear Member of the Stanford Community:
On Monday, Oct. 28, after more than 14 weeks of negotiations with USW, Local 680, the Stanford
negotiating team has put the University's final offer on the bargaining table. Negotiations have dragged
on and come to a virtual standstill. The union has announced a strike deadline of Oct. 31.
A strike at Stanford would be extremely unfortunate. In an attempt to avert this disheartening possibility,
the University has presented this last offer.
It is my belief — and this belief is shared by all of the University's senior officers — that this offer, which
includes retroactive wage adjustments, provides an excellent foundation for a new agreement. The
Stanford team has asked the union leaders to present the offer to the workers represented in the USW
bargaining unit for a vote.
During the course of these negotiations there has been much controversy about the substance of the
University's proposals in four major areas: wages, benefits, "access," and "job security." This letter is
to clarify any confusion on these issues and to describe them as the University has proposed them.
i
WAGES
Year One
In the first year of the contract, the University has proposed that all workers now at the highest pay steps
(Step 5) receive an immediate pay increase of 7 1 / 2 percent retroactive to September 1,1985. This 7 y /z
percent raise is composed of two parts — 5 percent across-the-board and an additional 2Vz percent to
the Step 5 pay level.
For workers who are now on Steps 1 through 4, the University has proposed a pay increase which will
result in wage increases of 10 percent during the first year. This 10 percent is also in two parts — a 5
percent immediate raise retroactive to September 1,1985 plus an additional five percent normal step
increase to occur on each worker's annual review date.
These increases in the first year of the contract compare with an inflation rate of 3.2 percent for the last
year, as measured by the consumer price index.
The increases are consistent with those already given to all other University employees this year. They
are also consistent with the increases contained in recent union contracts elsewhere in the Bay Area, and
exceed the national average of settlements for 1985.
Year Two
In the second year of the contract, the University has proposed a pay increase of 4 percent
across-the-board for all workers. (Workers below the top step will receive an additional 5 percent normal
step increase on their annual review dates).
Year Three
In the third year of the contract, the University has proposed a pay increase of 4V 2 percent
across-the-board for all workers. (Workers below the top step will receive an additional 5 percent normal ;'
step increase on their annual review dates.) • ;
In year three, the University has also proposed that, if inflation increases faster than these wages, each
worker be given in addition a cost-of-living wage adjustment up to $43 per month (25 cents per hour).
•
This all means that the University has proposed wage increases for workers in the bargaining unit of at
least 16 percent over the three years. If inflation triggers the cost-of-living clause, the amount will be even
greater.
BENEFITS
Stanford has not made any proposals to change or reduce any benefits now provided for workers as
participants in University-wide benefit plans. Stanford continues to promise that any improvements made - t
in these benefit plans will be offered to bargaining unit workers.
' **
. --... "ACCESS"
»#> — USW, Local 680, has claimed that the University wants through its proposals to deny workers the right to
union representation. This is simply not true. The University readily agreed to continue to provide a
generous amount of paid time off from work for workers and their stewards (39 stewards with up to 120
hours per year of paid time each) in every step of the grievance procedure.
Our new proposal is that union representatives, unless acting as a representative in the grievance
procedure, limit their visits to work areas whenever practicable to times when work is not going on, e.g.,
breaks, lunch time, before and after work. The University has proposed that when union representatives
are in the work place that they observe both safety and department work rules. We have agreed to
arrange access on work time, when that is the only practicable alternative.
"JOB SECURITY"
Local 680 has accused the University of plotting to lay off union workers and replace them with temporary
employees, with employees of contractors or subcontractors, or with other University non-union
employees including students and faculty. Again this is not the case.
The University has not proposed changes in the contract language (paragraph 2) which since 1973 has
limited the University's use of temporary employees, including students, to less than half time or no longer
than four months on the job. v
The University has not proposed changes in the language (paragraphs 91-93) which has always
governed contracting and subcontracting of services, and which requires contractors to offer available
jobs to laid-off Stanford employees.
The University has not proposed changes in the language (paragraph 324) which has always limited lay
offs to only those situations which are required by "budgetary or operational considerations."
The contract was never intended to limit supervisors, principal investigators, researchers, students, and
other University employees from doing some work which is the same as the work performed by
bargaining unit workers.
Unfortunately, however, the 680 leadership has explicitly stated that their interpretation of the contract
(paragraph 94) prohibits these University employees from ever doing any such work if it should also
happen that operational or budgetary reasons call for the layoff of a bargaining unit worker capable of
doing that work anywhere in the University.
Because of this problem, the University has proposed to modify the contract language (paragraph 94)
only so that it is clear that our academic and research programs can continue to operate just as they
always have, i.e., supervisors, researchers, and students continuing doing some bargaining unit work.
The contract (paragraph 94) will still forbid the use of non-University employees (such as job shoppers)
from directly resulting in the lay-off of a worker.
It is important to point out that all such University actions are subject to the union grievance procedure
which includes binding arbitration before a professional labor arbitrator. This gives the union the right to
challenge University actions whenever it believes the University is in the wrong.
•
We believe strongly that the University's final offer is a fair one for all concerned. The wage proposal
reflects the realities of the labor market and provides wage increases for bargaining unit workers
equivalent to increases given to all other University employees. And as I have described, the University
has not made any proposals that will reduce job security at Stanford.
We hope that the University offer will result in settlement so that this matter can be resolved without
conflict. We hope it will be considered carefully by the union leaders and the workers they represent.
