# Union To Take Strike Vote Today
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writers 
More than 1,300 University employees will go
on strike this afternoon if the United Stanford
Workers union votes down the University's final
contract offer.
Although yesterday neither union nor Univer
sity spokesmen would predict the outcome of
today's vote, union leaders said they were not
satisfied with the University's final offer, and
both sides braced for a strike.
Union members will vote on the University's
final contract offer in a closed meeting beginning
at noon in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Results are
expected by 3 p.m., and a strike will begin im
mediately if the contract offer is rejected.

A union strike at Stanford would affect Univer
sity Food Service, garbage collection, mainte
nance and deliveries and could stall campus con
struction projects.
Both the University and the union have begun
strike preparations.
The union has established a strike center, set
aside funds, obtained strike sanctions from both
the Santa Clara County and San Mateo County
Central Labor Councils and is expected to win
the support of the Teamsters Joint Council
today.
The University has readied contingency plans
for food service and maintenance operations and
is prepared to "remain open and continue to
operate," according to University spokesmen.
USW President Dennis Blake said that union
members do not want to strike, but that the Uni
versity may have given workers no option but to
make a "last-ditch effort to defend our rights."
"Of course we don't want to strike," Blake
said. "Nobody ever wants to strike. The only

strike-happy person is a psychopath."
However, University chief negotiator Priscilla
Wheeler said that the final contract offer the Uni
versity made Monday "ought to produce a settle
ment," but that misrepresentation of the facts
dnd anti-University rhetoric from union leader
ship could unfairly influence members' votes.
"I think if they were given the proposal with
out the rhetoric, we would have a really good
chance of having it ratified, because it's a real
good offer," Wheeler said.
The University's final offer provides for raises
of about 16 percent over the next three years,
while the union's final position requested in
creases of about 21 percent.
Union and University negotiators also remain
deadlocked on issues of job security and union
access to employees during working hours.
Blake said the union wants to prevent the Uni
versity from laying off union workers and replac
ing them with "people who will be paid less to do
the same job and who don't have union protec
tion and benefits."
Wheeler said, however, that the University
has proposed no contract changes that would af
fect job security.
She also said that there is little room for
movement in the University's final contract of
fer.
"We had to think long and hard about the final
offer, because that means what it says," Wheeler
said. "It means that we have put on the table our
last and best offer. If the union rejects what
we've put on the table, then we're deadlocked."
Blake charged that University administrators
"don't know what bargaining means."
"Bargaining is a give-and-take process," he
said. "Their definition is, The union gives and
we take.' "
The 1,300 technical, maintenance and service
employees have been working without a contract
since Aug. 31. On Oct. 15, USW members voted
521-130 to authorize a strike if the University did
not offer an acceptable proposal.
Wheeler said yesterday that she feared union
leadership would prohibit employees who pay
union dues but are not union members from
voting today in order to ensure that the Univer
sity's contract offer is defeated.

But Blake said it is "established union policy
that only members are allowed to vote.
"It's nothing new," he said. "If you're a mem
ber, you vote. If you're not, you don't. It's not
like we put roadblocks in."
USW chief negotiator Mary Ann Tenuto said
she believes union members will base their vote
today on the merits of the University's proposal
and not on emotion.
"No worker makes the decision to go on strike
lightly," she said. "It's a heavy decision to
make."
Questions remained yesterday about the spe
cific disruptions a strike would cause. John
Albrecht, associate director of Facilities and
Services, would say only that the University
"will remain open and continue to operate."
Wheeler said the University will use super
visors, non-striking union members and non
union employees to keep basic services operat
ing as smoothly as possible.
"Strikes are the unions' best weapons, and
they can range from being quite disruptive to
being inconvenient," Wheeler said. "We have to
feed lab animals at the medical center, feed stu
dents and keep the operations going. We intend
to keep operating."
•As the strike vote neared yesterday, both
union and University negotiators escalated their
rhetoric campaigns against one another.
Blake charged that the University seeks to
employ "slave labor," called the the administra
tion's labor policies "an attack on our basic stan
dard of living," and said administrators want a
strike "to finish the job they started last year —
to break the union."
Tenuto assailed the University administration
in general and Wheeler in particular, calling the
University's "propaganda" counterproductive.
"If they ever want a good relationship with the
union," she said, "they need to stop."
Wheeler countered that "rhetoric . . . seems
to be the style with this (union leadership)
group."
"They seem to have tried to use the 'job se
curity' issue to unify their work force to say 'you
have to strike because Stanford wants to take
away your job,' " Wheeler said. "It's difficult to
try to-counter that sort of misrepresentation."

not offer an acceptable proposal.
Wheeler said yesterday that she feared union
leadership would prohibit employees who pay
union dues but are not union members from
voting today in order to ensure that the Univer
sity's contract offer is defeated.

But Blake said it is "established union policy
that only members are allowed to vote.
"It's nothing new," he said. "If you're a mem
ber, you vote. If you're not, you don't. It's not
like we put roadblocks in."
USW chief negotiator Mary Ann Tenuto said
she believes union members will base their vote
today on the merits of the University's proposal
and not on emotion.
"No worker makes the decision to go on strike
lightly," she said. "It's a heavy decision to
make."
Questions remained yesterday about the spe
cific disruptions a strike would cause. John
Albrecht, associate director of Facilities and
Services, would say only that the University
"will remain open and continue to operate."
Wheeler said the University will use super
visors, non-striking union members and non
union employees to keep basic services operat
ing as smoothly as possible.
"Strikes are the unions' best weapons, and
they can range from being quite disruptive to
being inconvenient," Wheeler said. "We have to
feed lab animals at the medical center, feed stu
dents and keep the operations going. We intend
to keep operating."
•As the strike vote neared yesterday, both
union and University negotiators escalated their
rhetoric campaigns against one another.
Blake charged that the University seeks to
employ "slave labor," called the the administra
tion's labor policies "an attack on our basic stan
dard of living," and said administrators want a
strike "to finish the job they started last year —
to break the union."
Tenuto assailed the University administration
in general and Wheeler in particular, calling the
University's "propaganda" counterproductive.
"If they ever want a good relationship with the
union," she said, "they need to stop."
Wheeler countered that "rhetoric . . . seems
to be the style with this (union leadership)
group."
"They seem to have tried to use the 'job se
curity' issue to unify their work force to say 'you
have to strike because Stanford wants to take
away your job,' " Wheeler said. "It's difficult to
try to-counter that sort of misrepresentation."

More than 1,300 University employees will go
on strike this afternoon if the United Stanford
Workers union votes down the University's final
contract offer.
Although yesterday neither union nor Univer
sity spokesmen would predict the outcome of
today's vote, union leaders said they were not
satisfied with the University's final offer, and
both sides braced for a strike.
Union members will vote on the University's
final contract offer in a closed meeting beginning
at noon in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Results are
expected by 3 p.m., and a strike will begin im
mediately if the contract offer is rejected.

A union strike at Stanford would affect Univer
sity Food Service, garbage collection, mainte
nance and deliveries and could stall campus con
struction projects.
Both the University and the union have begun
strike preparations.
The union has established a strike center, set
aside funds, obtained strike sanctions from both
the Santa Clara County and San Mateo County
Central Labor Councils and is expected to win
the support of the Teamsters Joint Council
today.
The University has readied contingency plans
for food service and maintenance operations and
is prepared to "remain open and continue to
operate," according to University spokesmen.
USW President Dennis Blake said that union
members do not want to strike, but that the Uni
versity may have given workers no option but to
make a "last-ditch effort to defend our rights."
"Of course we don't want to strike," Blake
said. "Nobody ever wants to strike. The only

strike-happy person is a psychopath."
However, University chief negotiator Priscilla
Wheeler said that the final contract offer the Uni
versity made Monday "ought to produce a settle
ment," but that misrepresentation of the facts
dnd anti-University rhetoric from union leader
ship could unfairly influence members' votes.
"I think if they were given the proposal with
out the rhetoric, we would have a really good
chance of having it ratified, because it's a real
good offer," Wheeler said.
The University's final offer provides for raises
of about 16 percent over the next three years,
while the union's final position requested in
creases of about 21 percent.
Union and University negotiators also remain
deadlocked on issues of job security and union
access to employees during working hours.
Blake said the union wants to prevent the Uni
versity from laying off union workers and replac
ing them with "people who will be paid less to do
the same job and who don't have union protec
tion and benefits."
Wheeler said, however, that the University
has proposed no contract changes that would af
fect job security.
She also said that there is little room for
movement in the University's final contract of
fer.
"We had to think long and hard about the final
offer, because that means what it says," Wheeler
said. "It means that we have put on the table our
last and best offer. If the union rejects what
we've put on the table, then we're deadlocked."
Blake charged that University administrators
"don't know what bargaining means."
"Bargaining is a give-and-take process," he
said. "Their definition is, The union gives and
we take.' "
The 1,300 technical, maintenance and service
employees have been working without a contract
since Aug. 31. On Oct. 15, USW members voted
521-130 to authorize a strike if the University did
not offer an acceptable proposal.
