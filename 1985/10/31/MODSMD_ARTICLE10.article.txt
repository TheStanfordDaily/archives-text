A possible union strike here
will not have an adverse effect on
Stanford Hospital, according to
Spyros Andreopoulos, director of
communications at the Stanford
Medical Center.
No hospital employees are
members of the United Stanford
Workers, and the 199 union
workers in the Stanford Medical
School are all temporarily expen
dable or replaceable, Andre
opoulos said.
The medical center workers
who belong to the union — includ

iner technicians, glass washers
and assistants in animal care,
autopsy services and on the
loading dock — are legally not
allowed to strike before Saturday,
due to a federal law requiring a
10-day advance notice of intention
to strike.
The medical center workers in
the union will join a United Stan
ford Workers strike — if there is
a strike — but not until Saturday,
according to Mary Ann Tenuto,
chief negotiator for USW.
Andreopoulos said a strike
would disrupt the delivery of
supplies to the hospital but that
the hospital has sufficient contin
gency supplies to operate nor
mally. "Any hospital has to be

prepared for emergencies," he
said.
He also said that the chairman
of the Pathology Department,
Klaus Bensch, told him the
autopsy service would not be dis
rupted by a strike.
Tenuto said the union workers
at the medical center have as
much right as any other workers
to strike, regardless of whether
their absence would hurt the
hospital. But she noted that USW
is not trying to create a distur
bance at the hospital.
"The point is not to hurt the
hospital, although that's the im
pression the University tries to
give with its propaganda," Tenuto
said.
