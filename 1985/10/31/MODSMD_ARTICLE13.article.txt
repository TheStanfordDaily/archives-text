## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Protect Union Access 
### 
The University's proposal to place restrictions on
the time and conditions in which United Stanford
Workers (USW) representatives may visit work
areas threatens an essential element of the current
University-USW contract: the right of workers to
petition freely against what they feel to be injus
tices.
The section of the contract in question, paragraph
71, was written in 1973 and states that union repre
sentatives "shall be permitted access without prior
approval by the University management to any work
area generally open to the public." A reasonable in
terpretation of this clause provides the University
with productive labor while allowing workers to set
tle their grievances.
In contrast, the University's proposed revision of
paragraph 71 says the union "shall first notify the
manager of employee relations. The manager of em
ployee relations shall then advise the union of any
appropriate time for such access. In no event, if
such access is granted, shall the total time allowed
exceed 10 minutes."

But the University should not have the power to
determine when and if union members can discuss
work-related problems on the job.
As an example, consider a worker who files a
complaint against his supervisor. While the worker
waits for the University to authorize a meeting be
tween himself and the union, the manager of em
ployee relations could alert the supervisor and ar
range to have the worker reprimanded or fired.
University chief negotiator Priscilla Wheeler has
said "disruptive visits" to the workplace by union
representatives have influenced the University's
proposal. It is in the University's interest to expect
efficiency from its employees, but not all union visits
are disruptive, and not all problems can be resolved
in 10 minutes.
Wheeler has called the current paragraph 71
"archaic and kind of naive." But if 1973 is archaic,
why did the University pick 1985 to revive old
fashioned paternalism? Paragraph 71 is good as is,
and if it isn't broke, don't fix it.
