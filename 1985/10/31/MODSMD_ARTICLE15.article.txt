Picket Lines
We, the Tresidder maintenance
crew, along with other members of
United Stanford Workers (USW),
may be forced to go on strike be
cause the University administration
wants to take away our job secur
ity and representation rights. Al
though University President
Donald Kennedy and his chief
negotiator, Priscilla Wheeler, play
down the seriousness of their
proposal, we know too well how
serious those take-aways would be
for us.
We eight members of the crew
maintain and clean most of Tresid
der and set up the meeting rooms.
Although we like our work, Tresid
der management is known for its
Daily, this same manage
ment said it would set up extra
food service if there is a strike. We
urge people not to use it. If we are
forced on strike, we urge students
and staff to respect our picket lines
and not to use the Coffee House or
the cafeteria, eat any Tresidder
prepared food or use the meeting
rooms upstairs. We will distribute a
list of alternative eating places on
and off campus and will do every

thing possible to help provide food
that doesn't undermine USW
workers.
We want to thank students and
staff for their support, especially
for the many letters in The Daily.
After spending a day first battling
Tresidder management in an effort
to keep our pride and dignity as
workers and then battling the ad
ministration in an effort to keep
our contract rights, we can't tell
you how nice it is to sit down,
open The Daily and see those
supportive letters.

Perkins Wanted
Peaceful Protest
As students living with Robby
Perkins this year, we feel it neces
sary to refute the accusations
made by Raymond White in his
letter (The Daily, Oct. 28). White
would have us believe that Robby
misrepresented the truth in order
to further his political cause by
claiming that he was beaten by
police. White's accusation is un
founded and unjust.
First, White, having never met
Robby, has absolutely no basis on
which to judge his motivations.

White's judgement seems to be
based on an unquestioning trust of
the police force, rather than a
knowledge of the events as they
occurred. Perhaps if White had
seen, as we did, the bruises on
Robby's back, he would not have
been so rash in discrediting
Robby's story.
Second, by stating that Robby
and others arrested while protest
ing for divestment lied "to be seen
as victims and to raise the sympa
thy due to martyrs," White shows
a misunderstanding of the issues at
hand. Although Robby was pro
testing apartheid at the time of his
arrest, the issue now is police
brutality. Because many seem to
have lost sight of this difference,
they have misrepresented the
subject of dispute. The problem is
that a person was beaten by the
police.
It is important to remember that
Robby is not the embodiment of a
political cause. He is a person and
should be treated as such, not as a
martyr or as a figurehead of a
subversive group. Robby wished
to express his views peacefully.
He certainly did not intend to be
beaten.
We hope that White and others
in the future will more carefully
investigate this issue before com

ing to conclusions about those
involved. By attempting to alter
public opinion using preconceived
views based on little factual
evidence, White is acting more
than irresponsibly. He is danger
ously distorting the truth.

David Stephens, the chairperson
of the United Stanford Workers'
negotiating team, has added an
interesting bit of mythology to the
current contract negotiations. He
says, in part, "Kennedy has aspira
tions for the Democratic Senate
nomination." He appears to believe
that, as a consequence of Stan
ford's differences with the union,
my political aspirations will be
ruined.
Stephens thus gives me a
welcome opportunity to reiterate
what I have said before on a num
ber of occasions: I have no interest
— none whatever — in running for
political office. Thus the outcome
he predicts, however unlikely,
would not be unwelcome!

Perkins this year, we feel it neces
sary to refute the accusations
made by Raymond White in his
letter (The Daily, Oct. 28). White
would have us believe that Robby
misrepresented the truth in order
to further his political cause by
claiming that he was beaten by
police. White's accusation is un
founded and unjust.
First, White, having never met
Robby, has absolutely no basis on
which to judge his motivations.

White's judgement seems to be
based on an unquestioning trust of
the police force, rather than a
knowledge of the events as they
occurred. Perhaps if White had
seen, as we did, the bruises on
Robby's back, he would not have
been so rash in discrediting
Robby's story.
Second, by stating that Robby
and others arrested while protest
ing for divestment lied "to be seen
as victims and to raise the sympa
thy due to martyrs," White shows
a misunderstanding of the issues at
hand. Although Robby was pro
testing apartheid at the time of his
arrest, the issue now is police
brutality. Because many seem to
have lost sight of this difference,
they have misrepresented the
subject of dispute. The problem is
that a person was beaten by the
police.
It is important to remember that
Robby is not the embodiment of a
political cause. He is a person and
should be treated as such, not as a
martyr or as a figurehead of a
subversive group. Robby wished
to express his views peacefully.
He certainly did not intend to be
beaten.
We hope that White and others
in the future will more carefully
investigate this issue before com

ing to conclusions about those
involved. By attempting to alter
public opinion using preconceived
views based on little factual
evidence, White is acting more
than irresponsibly. He is danger
ously distorting the truth.

Kennedy's Plans
David Stephens, the chairperson
of the United Stanford Workers'
negotiating team, has added an
interesting bit of mythology to the
current contract negotiations. He
says, in part, "Kennedy has aspira
tions for the Democratic Senate
nomination." He appears to believe
that, as a consequence of Stan
ford's differences with the union,
my political aspirations will be
ruined.
Stephens thus gives me a
welcome opportunity to reiterate
what I have said before on a num
ber of occasions: I have no interest
— none whatever — in running for
political office. Thus the outcome
he predicts, however unlikely,
would not be unwelcome!
