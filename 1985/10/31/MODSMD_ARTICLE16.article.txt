# Divestment Push Must Continue
## 
### 
Since the beginning of this quarter, Stanford's
relationship to South Africa and the question of
divestment have been issues of concern and
debate. Apartheid is something that most stu
dents are strongly against, but there is a great
deal of confusion surrounding some basic ques
tions. What is the nature of the U.S. corporate
relationship to the apartheid regime, and how
will divestment help end apartheid?

Foreign investment is critical to the continued
survival of apartheid rule. Foreign interests con
trol about 40 percent of South African manufac
turing and 80 percent of its industrial production.
Great Britain and the United States have the
greatest investments in South Africa and, not
coincidentally, are the strongest allies of the
South African government. Their investments
support apartheid directly through sales to the
military and police and generally through main
taining the South African economy. Such multi
national corporations as Caltex, Mobil, Exxon
and IBM control huge portions of the South
African market.
Why are U.S. corporations so interested in
doing business in this racist country? The rea
son, simply stated, is profits. Inhumanly low
wages for the black workers (on average, one
fifth the wage paid a white worker) enable busi
nesses in South Africa to maintain an extremely
high profit rate. South African industry reports
18.6 percent profit rates while the average rate
worldwide is only 11 percent.
Almost 50 percent of Stanford University's in
vestments, amounting to some $215 million, are
in corporations doing business with South Africa.
This substantial investment and Stanford's direct
support for apartheid have never been seriously
questioned by the University Board of Trustees.
While officially maintaining a policy of selective
divestment, the board has never voted to divest
from a single company doing business in South
Africa. The trustees include major stockholders

in various apartheid-related corporations. These
businessmen include David Packard, chairman of
Hewlett-Packard corporation, and William Tim
ken, the head of Timken Corporation, one of the
foremost violators of codes of business ethics in
South Africa. The presence of such men on the
board brings into question the objectivity of the
board's decisions on this issue.
The really major question remains: Why is di
vestment an aid to ending apartheid? Divest
ment from corporations doing business with
South Africa is a means of pressuring those cor
porations to pull out of South Africa, including
the removal of subsidiaries and further transac
tions with the racist regime. The threat of
withdrawal of foreign investment
(disinvestment) sends a sharp message to the
Pretoria regime that its present policies will no
longer be tolerated. Divestment and disinvest
ment have had concrete and powerful effects on
the South African economy. In the past two
months, divestment, accompanied by govern
ment sanctions, has contributed to numerous fin-

ancial crises in South Africa, including the shut
down of the South African stock market for nearly
a week and a drop in the value of the South
African rand to an all-time low. As a direct result
of such external economic pressures, a delega
tion of major South African businessmen met
with the exiled leadership of the African National
Congress (ANC) in an effort to bring about sig
nificant change.
But the pressure must be maintained. The
government of South Africa has consistently
resisted change as a reaction to external sugges
tions like those offered by President Reagan in

his constructive engagement policy. Even those
relatively insignificant reforms that have been in
itiated by the South African government have
come about as a result of international pressure.
Only direct economic pressure has had any ef
fect on the South African regime, and this pres
sure is critical to aiding the struggle of black
South Africans to attain justice and equal repre
sentation.
Proponents of divestment are numerous.
Most important are the black South African
people and their leaders who are continuing the
battle for democracy and black majority rule.
The fact that the most respected black leaders,
Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu and Alan
Boesak, have made calls for total divestment
at great personal risk speaks loudly about black
opinion. A 1985 study by Mark Orkin of the
Community Agency For Scoial Enquiry revealed
that an astounding 73 percent of those black
South Africans polled called for divestment.
Other proponents of divestment include the
United Nations, the Organization for African
Unity, the Pan-African Congress and leaders of
the ANC.
Another argument often advanced by oppo
nents to total divestment — most prominently,
University President Donald Kennedy, Vice
President for Business and Finance William Mas
sey, the Board of Trustees and the College
Republicans — is that divestment is a one-shot
deal. They worry that once foreign investment is
removed from South Africa, we could no longer
help the situation. Divestment usually takes a
moderate period of time to bring about, and, in
recent months, many corporations have been
responding. We have already seen divestment by
cities, universities and unions across the
country.
But the main point is that continuing to hold in
vestments in South Africa is now helping the
apartheid regime maintain power. Continued in
vestment is not a passive act, but a political and
moral decision. On the South African issue
today, there are two distinct sides: those who
are fighting for liberation and equality and those
who are opposed to it. Divestment is only the
first step toward withdrawing foreign support for
the racist system and aiding the black self
determination struggle in South Africa.

University President Donald Kennedy, Vice
President for Business and Finance William Mas
sey, the Board of Trustees and the College
Republicans — is that divestment is a one-shot
deal. They worry that once foreign investment is
removed from South Africa, we could no longer
help the situation. Divestment usually takes a
moderate period of time to bring about, and, in
recent months, many corporations have been
responding. We have already seen divestment by
cities, universities and unions across the
country.
But the main point is that continuing to hold in
vestments in South Africa is now helping the
apartheid regime maintain power. Continued in
vestment is not a passive act, but a political and
moral decision. On the South African issue
today, there are two distinct sides: those who
are fighting for liberation and equality and those
who are opposed to it. Divestment is only the
first step toward withdrawing foreign support for
the racist system and aiding the black self
determination struggle in South Africa.

Since the beginning of this quarter, Stanford's
relationship to South Africa and the question of
divestment have been issues of concern and
debate. Apartheid is something that most stu
dents are strongly against, but there is a great
deal of confusion surrounding some basic ques
tions. What is the nature of the U.S. corporate
relationship to the apartheid regime, and how
will divestment help end apartheid?

Foreign investment is critical to the continued
survival of apartheid rule. Foreign interests con
trol about 40 percent of South African manufac
turing and 80 percent of its industrial production.
Great Britain and the United States have the
greatest investments in South Africa and, not
coincidentally, are the strongest allies of the
South African government. Their investments
support apartheid directly through sales to the
military and police and generally through main
taining the South African economy. Such multi
national corporations as Caltex, Mobil, Exxon
and IBM control huge portions of the South
African market.
Why are U.S. corporations so interested in
doing business in this racist country? The rea
son, simply stated, is profits. Inhumanly low
wages for the black workers (on average, one
fifth the wage paid a white worker) enable busi
nesses in South Africa to maintain an extremely
high profit rate. South African industry reports
18.6 percent profit rates while the average rate
worldwide is only 11 percent.
Almost 50 percent of Stanford University's in
vestments, amounting to some $215 million, are
in corporations doing business with South Africa.
This substantial investment and Stanford's direct
support for apartheid have never been seriously
questioned by the University Board of Trustees.
While officially maintaining a policy of selective
divestment, the board has never voted to divest
from a single company doing business in South
Africa. The trustees include major stockholders

in various apartheid-related corporations. These
businessmen include David Packard, chairman of
Hewlett-Packard corporation, and William Tim
ken, the head of Timken Corporation, one of the
foremost violators of codes of business ethics in
South Africa. The presence of such men on the
board brings into question the objectivity of the
board's decisions on this issue.
The really major question remains: Why is di
vestment an aid to ending apartheid? Divest
ment from corporations doing business with
South Africa is a means of pressuring those cor
porations to pull out of South Africa, including
the removal of subsidiaries and further transac
tions with the racist regime. The threat of
withdrawal of foreign investment
(disinvestment) sends a sharp message to the
Pretoria regime that its present policies will no
longer be tolerated. Divestment and disinvest
ment have had concrete and powerful effects on
the South African economy. In the past two
months, divestment, accompanied by govern
ment sanctions, has contributed to numerous fin-

ancial crises in South Africa, including the shut
down of the South African stock market for nearly
a week and a drop in the value of the South
African rand to an all-time low. As a direct result
of such external economic pressures, a delega
tion of major South African businessmen met
with the exiled leadership of the African National
Congress (ANC) in an effort to bring about sig
nificant change.
But the pressure must be maintained. The
government of South Africa has consistently
resisted change as a reaction to external sugges
tions like those offered by President Reagan in

his constructive engagement policy. Even those
relatively insignificant reforms that have been in
itiated by the South African government have
come about as a result of international pressure.
Only direct economic pressure has had any ef
fect on the South African regime, and this pres
sure is critical to aiding the struggle of black
South Africans to attain justice and equal repre
sentation.
Proponents of divestment are numerous.
Most important are the black South African
people and their leaders who are continuing the
battle for democracy and black majority rule.
The fact that the most respected black leaders,
Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu and Alan
Boesak, have made calls for total divestment
at great personal risk speaks loudly about black
opinion. A 1985 study by Mark Orkin of the
Community Agency For Scoial Enquiry revealed
that an astounding 73 percent of those black
South Africans polled called for divestment.
Other proponents of divestment include the
United Nations, the Organization for African
Unity, the Pan-African Congress and leaders of
the ANC.
Another argument often advanced by oppo
nents to total divestment — most prominently,
