## Do Something For South Africa 
### 
I've been mulling over Kenneth
Fenyo's column (The Daily, Oct.
22) on the intolerance of the South
African protesters at Stanford and
have sadly decided there is some
thing true in his charge. I've discov
ered how inept I am myself at
avoiding irking my friends when dis
cussing the anti-apartheid move
ment.

VIEWPOINT

The reason my dander is raised
so easily, I guess, is this: Everyone
has some qualms about the ad
visability, of illegal divestment sit
ins, and people might well decide
not to take part. The problem is
that, for many, this becomes, in ef
fect, a decision to do nothing. This
is hard for me to understand.
People are dying in South Africa.
Others are in prison. A government
for which few of us have a kind
word is muddling through with daily
incidents of violence and racism.
Is it too terrible an exaggeration
to say that South Africa is our Nazi
Germany? Perhaps it's only one
tenth as serious? Why have the les
sons we learned there about "do
nothing-ism" been so quickly atten
uated? It's frustrating when my
friends view the South African
question in terms of, "Should we
divest or not?" instead of, "If we
don't divest, is there something
else we can do?" It's hard to hear
criticism from those who, by
default, seem to propose we do
nothing.
I'm awfully bothered by South
Africa and the suspicion that our
government and corporations could

be doing more to encourage peace
there. I have decided the least I can
do is demonstrate for divestment.
We know protest works. Since the
Boston Tea Party, protest, along
with voting and letters to the
editor, has been one way
Americans have sent their message
to their government.
One of the factors keeping "our
boys" out of Nicaragua is Secretary
of Defense Caspar Weinberger's
keen awareness that unpopular
wars will bring the protesters back
to Washington. I was proud there
were so many minority members
among the police who
at Old Union. They have their jobs,
in part, because other protesters
went to jail to draw attention to civil
rights abuses. The only reason
President Reagan is moving toward
sanctions against South Africa is the
nationwide groundswell of protest
among students, some Christian ot
ganizations and other concerned
citizens.
At Stanford, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy knows that if
50 students are willing to go to jail,
500 are angry and 5,000 are sympa
thetic. That's how politics works in
America.
Intolerance isn't nearly as irritat
ing if you're satisfied with what
you're doing about apartheid. I'd
like to invite everyone in the Stan
ford community to express some
how his concerns about South
Africa and to think about the best
way to nudge South Africa toward
peace. I beg you to do something.
