The Yale Precision Marching
Band (YPMB) has turned the other
cheek to complaints that band
members dropped their trousers in
front of Holy Cross fans at a recent
football game.
Although The New Haven Regis
ter reported that band members ac
tually "mooned" the crowd, Band
Director Thomas Duffy told the
Yale Daily News that band mem
bers were wearing shorts under
their trousers that "left about a foot
of flesh between their knees and
ankles."
Duffy said the local press' deci
sion to call the incident "mooning"
was "a media fabrication based on a
blatant lie, if you take my definition
of mooning. Mooning means bare
buttocks."
Duffy said the trouser-dropping
was "not that big of a deal," but that
the timing of the event was "very

poor," because the band had been
banned from performing at West
Point. Army officials refused to let
the band perform its halftime show
after learning that the band planned
to joke about communist infiltration
and use the word "red" in various
puns.
Band officials have suspended
some of the revealing band mem
bers from performing at the next
three games, although some alumni
and band members called for har
sher actions.
Meter Merriment
The people of Princeton Borough
are throwing a party for that hungry
mechanical device that awaits the
unrelenting driver who has
searched the city twice over for a
place to rest his weary auto.
On Nov. 2, birthday hats will
adorn the borough's 1,100 parking
meters as the city celebrates the

anniversary of the device's inven
tion by Carlton Magee.
Parking that day will be free, re
ported The Daily Princetonian.
Motivated by the spirit of good
cheer and merriment that cus
tomarily accompanies such a gala
event, Princeton Borough Mayor

Barbara Sigmund granted tempo
rary amnesty to offenders who
have left their parking tickets un
paid. Borough officials will forgive
$5 late fees on all parking tickets
that are paid during the month of
October.
Also, a drawing is scheduled to

be held during the party in which a
former parking fugitive who has
paid his bill during October will
receive one day of free parking at
the meter of his choice.
An announcement of the celebra
tion invited innocent and guilty alike
to compete in finding answers to
some of life's most important topics
— such as the most heart-rending
excuse for illegal parking, the best
way to beat the system, the most
implausible excuse and the best
theory on how the meter maid
"always knows when you're one
minute overtime."
Berkeley Goes Hollywood
"At noon on Friday, a police car
sped down Bancroft Way with its
siren blaring. Standing in front of
Cafe Roma was a man in a Hawaiian
shirt carrying a clipboard in his hand
and with a walkie-talkie strapped to
his shorts.

" 'He can't do that!' the man
screamed, glaring at the police car
as it vanished down the avenue.
'Will somebody please tell him he
can't do that?' "
Such words comprise the lead
paragraphs of a recent article that
appeared in The Daily Californian,
and the offended man was a mem
ber of the crew filming "The Men's
Club," a movie adaptation of a novel
by UC-Berkeley English Prof.
Leonard Michaels.
Michaels' novel — his first to
date and one which has sold over
100,000 copies and been translated
into 12 languages — is "a kind of
feminist novel. . . . It's about the
way men really are," Michaels said.
The film, set in Berkeley and San
Francisco, is scheduled to be
released some time next year.
