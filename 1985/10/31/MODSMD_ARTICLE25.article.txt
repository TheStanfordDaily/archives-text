# Duck's Breath Not Bad
## 
### MARTIN ORTEGA 
It isn't mystery theater, it isn't
an improvisational group, and it
isn't a stand-up comedy act. So just
what is Duck's Breath Mystery
Theater, anyway?
"Smells like minnows and garlic,"
claims Duck Bill Allard.
In an evening of comedy befitting
such an unusual name, the Duck's
Breath Mystery Theater arrived in
full force Friday night at Palo Alto's
New Varsity Theatre.
Audience members (mostly 30-
ish, yet refreshingly non-yuppie)
didn't seem to mind that the show
started more than 20 minutes late;
they probably knew they would be
treated to what many fans hail as
the "future" of comedy.
The official program explains that
the group was "founded in a cloud
of dim purpose and vague desire in
lowa City in 1975." In fact, the five
men who comprise Duck's Breath
(Bill Allard, Dan Coffey, Merle Kes
sler, Leon Martell and Jim Turner)
met as graduate students at the
University of lowa more than 10
years ago. After a year of perform

ing in local clubs, they headed west
for San Francisco, seeking star
dom.
It's been 10 years, and although
they haven't yet achieved the star
dom they dreamed of, they have
built up a loyal cult following in the
Bay Area and in lowa. And within
the past couple of years, Duck's
Breath has been reaching a growing
national audience due to its regular
appearances on National Public
Radio.
The group's brand of humor is a
combination of slapstick, funny
voices and social criticism. The
members' attire is comic in itself;
they are outfitted in the most out
rageous polyester double-knits
they could find at the local Good
will.
Kessler draws parallels between
their their haphazard style of com
edy and "a dog and cat fighting in a
trash bag. You can't see them, but
you know something's going on in
the bag."
Friday night, that "bag" con
tained some of the weirdest and
funniest skits you will see
anywhere. Mr. Nifty (Allard), a
bizarre cross between Don Cor

leone and Monty Hall, was the host
for the first half of the show.
Mr. Nifty's Vaudeville Cavalcade
featured some new "acts" in addi
tion to such Duck's Breath favorites
as "Ask Dr. Science" and social
commentator lan Shoales.
One of the best of the new acts
was the "Transvestite Farmers As
sociation," a group Mr. Nifty dis
covered playing the county fair cir
cuit in lowa. Leon Martell and
Mf -le Kessler played the beer
drinking, purse-toting "good ol'
boys" who travel the country in
their Winnebago paying homage to
the beloved founder of the "Drag
Aggie" movement, the immortal
Roy A -;üb.
Leon Martell was also "Congo
Bob," a veteran of several African
revolutions seeking to convert the
entire state of Texas into "Old
Africa USA" — an amusement park
where Americans could discover
the adventure and excitement of old
Africa. Customers would be given
automatic weapons ("home of the
bottomless clip") to shoot live game
("the stray dogs and cats of
America").
The highlights of the show were

Duck's Breath's best known char
acters, Dr. Science and lan
Shoales. As they do every morning
on more than 130 public radio sta
tions nationwide, Coffey (as Dr.
Science) and Kessler (as Rodney,
his trusty assistant) answered
questions from curious listeners in
this hilarious parody of the old tele
vision show "Ask Mr. Wizard." The
success of "Dr. Science" is due to
Coffey's voice. As Coffey puts it,
"The most endearing quality of my
voice is its total insincerity."
Some typical Dr. Science ques
tions and answers are:
• What are pigeons? "The offspring

of escaped canaries who mate with
rats out of fear and loneliness I
suppose, like most intimate con
tact."
• Will science soon develop a
picture telephone so callers can see
"like if a woman was in the bathtub
bare naked?" "Your curiosity shows
you have the makings of a future
scientist — welcome aboard!"
Perhaps Duck's Breath's most
famous character is Kessler's sar
donic social critic, lan Shoales.
Shoales has appeared periodically
on ABC's "Nightline" with Ted
Koppel and regularly on National
Public Radio's "All Things Consid

ered." Shoales will rail on anything
that "arouses the ire of the new
curmudgeon of the '80s," and
Friday night's show featured the
lambasting of such fads of the '80s
as T-shirts and bumper stickers.
The future of Duck's Breath
looks good: its appearances on Na
tional Public Radio are becoming a
national hit, and lan Shoales will un
doubtedly appear more frequently
on "Nightline." Also, the group is
awaiting the production of its
screenplay, "Zarda: Cow From
Hell," which should legitimize
Duck's Breath as the five funniest
men ever to come from lowa.

started more than 20 minutes late;
they probably knew they would be
treated to what many fans hail as
the "future" of comedy.
The official program explains that
the group was "founded in a cloud
of dim purpose and vague desire in
lowa City in 1975." In fact, the five
men who comprise Duck's Breath
(Bill Allard, Dan Coffey, Merle Kes
sler, Leon Martell and Jim Turner)
met as graduate students at the
University of lowa more than 10
years ago. After a year of perform

ing in local clubs, they headed west
for San Francisco, seeking star
dom.
It's been 10 years, and although
they haven't yet achieved the star
dom they dreamed of, they have
built up a loyal cult following in the
Bay Area and in lowa. And within
the past couple of years, Duck's
Breath has been reaching a growing
national audience due to its regular
appearances on National Public
Radio.
The group's brand of humor is a
combination of slapstick, funny
voices and social criticism. The
members' attire is comic in itself;
they are outfitted in the most out
rageous polyester double-knits
they could find at the local Good
will.
Kessler draws parallels between
their their haphazard style of com
edy and "a dog and cat fighting in a
trash bag. You can't see them, but
you know something's going on in
the bag."
Friday night, that "bag" con
tained some of the weirdest and
funniest skits you will see
anywhere. Mr. Nifty (Allard), a
bizarre cross between Don Cor

leone and Monty Hall, was the host
for the first half of the show.
Mr. Nifty's Vaudeville Cavalcade
featured some new "acts" in addi
tion to such Duck's Breath favorites
as "Ask Dr. Science" and social
commentator lan Shoales.
One of the best of the new acts
was the "Transvestite Farmers As
sociation," a group Mr. Nifty dis
covered playing the county fair cir
cuit in lowa. Leon Martell and
Mf -le Kessler played the beer
drinking, purse-toting "good ol'
boys" who travel the country in
their Winnebago paying homage to
the beloved founder of the "Drag
Aggie" movement, the immortal
Roy A -;üb.
Leon Martell was also "Congo
Bob," a veteran of several African
revolutions seeking to convert the
entire state of Texas into "Old
Africa USA" — an amusement park
where Americans could discover
the adventure and excitement of old
Africa. Customers would be given
automatic weapons ("home of the
bottomless clip") to shoot live game
("the stray dogs and cats of
America").
The highlights of the show were

Duck's Breath's best known char
acters, Dr. Science and lan
Shoales. As they do every morning
on more than 130 public radio sta
tions nationwide, Coffey (as Dr.
Science) and Kessler (as Rodney,
his trusty assistant) answered
questions from curious listeners in
this hilarious parody of the old tele
vision show "Ask Mr. Wizard." The
success of "Dr. Science" is due to
Coffey's voice. As Coffey puts it,
"The most endearing quality of my
voice is its total insincerity."
Some typical Dr. Science ques
tions and answers are:
• What are pigeons? "The offspring

of escaped canaries who mate with
rats out of fear and loneliness I
suppose, like most intimate con
tact."
• Will science soon develop a
picture telephone so callers can see
"like if a woman was in the bathtub
bare naked?" "Your curiosity shows
you have the makings of a future
scientist — welcome aboard!"
Perhaps Duck's Breath's most
famous character is Kessler's sar
donic social critic, lan Shoales.
Shoales has appeared periodically
on ABC's "Nightline" with Ted
Koppel and regularly on National
Public Radio's "All Things Consid

ered." Shoales will rail on anything
that "arouses the ire of the new
curmudgeon of the '80s," and
Friday night's show featured the
lambasting of such fads of the '80s
as T-shirts and bumper stickers.
The future of Duck's Breath
looks good: its appearances on Na
tional Public Radio are becoming a
national hit, and lan Shoales will un
doubtedly appear more frequently
on "Nightline." Also, the group is
awaiting the production of its
screenplay, "Zarda: Cow From
Hell," which should legitimize
Duck's Breath as the five funniest
men ever to come from lowa.

It isn't mystery theater, it isn't
an improvisational group, and it
isn't a stand-up comedy act. So just
what is Duck's Breath Mystery
Theater, anyway?
"Smells like minnows and garlic,"
claims Duck Bill Allard.
In an evening of comedy befitting
such an unusual name, the Duck's
Breath Mystery Theater arrived in
full force Friday night at Palo Alto's
New Varsity Theatre.
