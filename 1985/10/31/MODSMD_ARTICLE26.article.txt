# 'Le Chevre' Delivers French Farce
## 
### DAVID WILLATS Staff writer 
"La Chevre" ("The Goat") is yet
another film in a line of absurd
French comedies that includes "La
Cage aux Folles" and"The Tall
Blond Man with One Black Shoe."
From a cinematic standpoint, these
movies are definitely not testa
ments to the art of filmmaking, but
on a personal level they are charm
ing and deserve recognition as both
hilarious and humane tilms.
"La Chevre" opens in Puerto
Vallarta with the young Marie Bens
(played by Corynne Charbit) arriv
ing at a large tourist hotel. In her
suite she immediately phones her
father (Michel Robin), the president
of a Paris company, to assure him
that nothing will happen to her
during her vacation. As she speaks,
however, she leans back too far on
the railing of her balcony, loses her
balance and falls several stories into
the awning over the hotel entrance.
Marie, whose whole life seems
governed by Murphy's law, has in
credibly bad luck. One is not
surprised when she is knocked un
conscious during the theft of her

purse ahd then kidnapped by the
man who stops to help her.
Her distraught father hires a
detective Campana (Gerard Depar
dieu) to find her, but, after several
weeks of searching, he returns
empty-handed. In a last-ditch effort
to save Marie, the company psy
chologist suggests a desperate
plan.
Since Marie has such terrible
luck, he reasons, why not get
someone with equally bad luck to
guide detective Campana in the
search? Presumably, the same inci
dents will happen to the unlucky
''guinea pig" as happened to Marie:
he would slip on the same banana
peels, run into the same glass doors
and so on. Thus enters Francois
Perrin (Pierre Richard), a Bens
company accountant whose bad
luck started when he was a
premature infant and his incubator
broke down. Campana and Perrin
set off on this wild goose chase with
predictably hilarious consequences.
In recent years the French have
created their own style of film com
edy. Their films have been charac
terized by ridiculous plots, a halting
and arhythmic time flow usually as
sociated with comic books and in

fectiously funny caricatures of real
life social types.
The director and principal actors
of "La Chevre" are responsible for
the success of many of these films.
Francis Veber, who wrote and di
rected "La Chevre," also wrote the
screenplays for "The Tall Blond
Man with One Black Shoe" and "La
Cage aux Folles," both having a
near cult status with American
audiences. Pierre Richard is best

portrayals.

known as the beleaguered violinist
in "The Tall Blond Man" series, and
Garard Depardieu, the current
French heart throb, has had a dis
tinguished career working under
directors like Truffaut and Resnais.
In 1983 the three collaborated to
make the popular "Les Comperes."
To the American viewer, these
films may seem a bit odd at first.
The pacing and structure is totally

different from that found in most
comedies made in the United
States. A good Hollywood comedy
is a stylistically tight piece of work.
Even in such absurdly silly films as
"Pee Wee's Big Adventure," there
is a constant sense of movement
and priority; the filmmakers leave
nothing to chance.
This is not the case in "La
Chevre." The film has little
thematic consistency, changing in
tone unpredictably from slapstick to
thriller. The script is very loose and
often does not follow any sensible
line of reasoning, even on a farcical
level. Nevertheless, it is an engag
ing and entertaining film. Its
strength lies in the humanization of
its characters. It is as if the director
gave the actors free rein in their
portrayals. The interactions of the
main characters (Richard and
Depardieu) are very real and very
personal, and together they create
several genuinely hilarious mo
ments.
"La Chevre" is not a great film (it
can't compete with the likes of "La
Cage aux Folles"), but it is worth
the ticket price and would make for
a fun, light-hearted break from the
drudgery of studying.


Pierre Richard and Gerard Depardieu are a bumbling twosome
in search of a kidnapped woman in the French comedy "Le
Chevre."
