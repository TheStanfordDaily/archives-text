# Viennese Musicians Forget Expression

### BECKY JAMES 
What a lovely fruit salad, but there are no grapes.
What grapes are to a fruit salad, emotion and expression are to a
performance, and while the Vienna Chamber Ensemble produced a
technically superb performance Sunday night in Memorial
Auditorium, the element of personal involvement and emotion was
conspicuously absent.
The Vienna Chamber Ensemble is a group of nine musicians (only
eight of which were present at this concert). All are members of the
Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. Joining the ensemble for the Sunday
afternoon concert was pianist David Gross, a physician and former
faculty member of the Stanford Medical School. Gross is currently in
private practice in San Jose.
It would be difficult to criticize the technical ability of the en
semble. All members performed with a rarely equaled level of preci
sion. First violin Gerhart Hetzel in particular dazzled the audience
with his facility. The articulation was also notable, as demonstrated
by the members' ability to play rapid staccato with impeccable preci
sion.
But technical ability does not not create an exciting concert, as the
ensemble proved.
It was amazing how the ensemble members maintained the same
facial expression throughout the entire performance. Although the
music would change tempo from slow to fast, from pensive to explo
sive, the attitude of the musicians stayed exactly the same. They
gave the impression that they were not really involved in their
music; performing seemed like a mechanical exercise for them.
One notable exception was Gross. His. performance stood out —
he was the only player who seemed to be actually experiencing the
music he was playing.
Piece selection also contributed to the blandness of the perfor
mance. The concert consisted entirely of works by Franz Schubert
— "Quintet in A" and "Octet in F." Two hours of one composer can
lead to a definite sense of monotony.
Overall, the concert lacked that certain spark that would have
been necessary for a truly great performance. The concert was
clearly missing something, though it is hard to say whether the
performers were not involved in the music or whether their involve
ment was just not coming across to the audience.
