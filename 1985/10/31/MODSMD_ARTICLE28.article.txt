The rating scale: one to five stars, with five being the best
Selected cuts from these albums will be played on KZSU tomorrow at 6p.m.

Simple Minds — "Once Upon
a Time"
Things To Do While Playing This
Album:
• Look through your other records
for secret messages etched into the
inner groove.
• Listen to KZSU.
• Listen to other records, tapes or
radio stations.
• Go visit some friends.
• Look through your old Simple
Minds albums nostalgically.
• Go see "The Breakfast Club"
again. Snap your fingers during the
opening theme.
• Appreciate a couple songs, in
cluding the new single, "Alive and
Kicking."
• Observe that the reason the
above songs sound good is that
they sound like older, better hits.
• Read through the lyrics, noticing
their unusual blandness.
• Figure that the slight Bono-ness
in Jim Kerr's vocals and the more
mystical Christian emphasis is due

to U2 influences.
• Notice that the instrumentation,
for some reason, parrots that from
"Don't You (Forget About Me)" and
"Sparkle in the Rain" yet misses
the best qualities of both.
• Remember to lock your door on
the way out.
The Alarm — "Strength Four"
• ★★★
With "Strength" under its belt,
The Alarm can now call itself a rock
'n' roll band. Their last and first al
bum, "Declaration," was a success
ful effort that put The Alarm in the
company and shadow of U2 and Big
Country, but their big-guitar sound
was still rough and unpolished, and
singer Mike Peters' gruff voice
didn't seem capable of maintaining a
tune for a whole song. "Strength"
takes The Alarm a level higher.
Peters improves his voice con
siderably without losing its charac
teristic rough edge. What's more,
guitarist David Sharp has gotten
better, no doubt the highlight of
their sound on this album. They
take risks, stepping in new direc
tions on several songs, and it works
remarkably well. On "Deeside," a
song about the devastating effects
of a factory closing, and on "Spirit
of 76," guitarist Sharp ventures in
a roots rock 'n' roll direction with
great results. The Alarm uses
keyboards very effectively in creat
ing atmosphere in "Only the
Thunder" and on "Knife-Edge."
"Father to Son," about a boy who
wants to avoid "(dying) in a dead

end job" has a lighter, almost pop
feel. "Absolute Reality" is destined
to receive some airplay. There isn't
a weak song on the disc, and it

never sounds the same. The album
proves that The Alarm has
Strength, indeed.

INXS — "Listen Like Thieves"
irifi
"Listen Like Thieves" is INXS'
third domestic album and their first
with a lyric sheet, helping to dispel
any notions that they ever had
something to say. This Australian
band has been remarkably good at
producing innovative, danceable
pop with a very strong beat. This
album is a little different from the
past two synthesizer/percussion
dominated albums in that it moves
the guitar up front. Previously, the
guitar was only a part of the backing
rhythm, making "lead guitar" some
thing of a misnomer for the band.
Here Timmy Farriss does in fact
take the lead with a less-than

favorable result. The strength of
INXS is in its melodic synthesizer
leads and the well-placed backing
harmonies complementing lead
singer Michael Hutchence, and
these strengths do appear in the cut
"This Time." But the rest of the al
bum mixes back that INXS
backbone, if it appears at all, and
consequently loses its pop hook
while maintaining the danceable
beat. Timmy just isn't a good
enough or creative enough guitar
player to capture the listener's in
terest. The songs blend together
and lose the energy of past INXS
hits like "The One Thing" and
"Original Sin." "This Time" is
bound to receive some airplay, but
not much else is likely to
materialize from this. Maybe next
time, guys.

a roots rock 'n' roll direction with
great results. The Alarm uses
keyboards very effectively in creat
ing atmosphere in "Only the
Thunder" and on "Knife-Edge."
"Father to Son," about a boy who
wants to avoid "(dying) in a dead

end job" has a lighter, almost pop
feel. "Absolute Reality" is destined
to receive some airplay. There isn't
a weak song on the disc, and it

never sounds the same. The album
proves that The Alarm has
Strength, indeed.

INXS — "Listen Like Thieves"
irifi
"Listen Like Thieves" is INXS'
third domestic album and their first
with a lyric sheet, helping to dispel
any notions that they ever had
something to say. This Australian
band has been remarkably good at
producing innovative, danceable
pop with a very strong beat. This
album is a little different from the
past two synthesizer/percussion
dominated albums in that it moves
the guitar up front. Previously, the
guitar was only a part of the backing
rhythm, making "lead guitar" some
thing of a misnomer for the band.
Here Timmy Farriss does in fact
take the lead with a less-than

favorable result. The strength of
INXS is in its melodic synthesizer
leads and the well-placed backing
harmonies complementing lead
singer Michael Hutchence, and
these strengths do appear in the cut
"This Time." But the rest of the al
bum mixes back that INXS
backbone, if it appears at all, and
consequently loses its pop hook
while maintaining the danceable
beat. Timmy just isn't a good
enough or creative enough guitar
player to capture the listener's in
terest. The songs blend together
and lose the energy of past INXS
hits like "The One Thing" and
"Original Sin." "This Time" is
bound to receive some airplay, but
not much else is likely to
materialize from this. Maybe next
time, guys.
