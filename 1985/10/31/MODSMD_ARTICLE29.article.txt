## Senior Baty Has Saved His Best for Last 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
Stanford tight end Greg Baty has
saved his best for last.
After catching a total of 24
passes in his first three seasons on
the Farm, Baty came out for his
senior year determined to produce
the numbers he knew he was capa
ble of.
"Before the season, I sat down
with the coaches, and we set some
personal goals for me," Baty said.
"They wanted me to be more in
volved in the offense, and we
decided that 44 catches — four a
game — would be a good year."
It's time to reset those goals.
After just seven games, the 6-foot
6, 240-pound Baty has pulled down
46 passes. That's the second-best
total in the Pac-10 Conference, the
fifth-best in the nation and the best
ever by a Stanford tight end.
How did it happen? What made
the difference between a 20-catch
receiver in 1984 and a candidate for
the 1985 All-Conference team?
"Two things," Baty said. "First,
I'm not rotating plays in anymore.
Second, it's just a matter of
(quarterback) John Paye having
more confidence in me. When
something works, you keep going
back to it."
; Baty works. He blocks well on
the line, and when he catches the
ball it's usually in the middle of the
field, where he has to take — and
give — some pretty hard hits.
; "I like catching balls over the
middle," Baty admitted. "The job of
the tight end is to catch the ball and
hm somebody over. Coach Oimmy)
Walsh has really drilled that into my
head. It pumps up the team, and it
intimidates the defense."


"The job of the tight end is to catch the ball and run over somebody," Cardinal
senior Greg Baty said. Baty, a big target at 6-foot-6 and 240 pounds, has had 46

chances already this year to lay a lick on unsuspecting defenders. Those 46
catches have eclipsed the old single-season record for a Stanford tight end.
Last season, Baty was having
trouble intimidating people, in part
because he was overly concerned
about his playing time. He, Eric
Snelson and Alan Summers shuttled
the plays in from the sideline, and
Snelson wound up starting two
games.
"What I've learned this year is
that I have no control over what
happens outside of me," Baty said.
"All I have control over is me.
Everything else will take care of it
self.
"Last year, coaches would send
someone in for me and I'd go, 'Oh
no.' I would worry about things so
much that I wouldn't play as well.
But I don't take everything per
sonally now, and I think it's
helped."
Stanford Coach Jack Elway has
been very impressed with Baty's
play in 1985. "Greg is having a tre
mendous year," he said. "He is run
ning his routes with conviction, and
he's catching the ball in traffic."
This season has been so good
that Baty, a human biology major,
has begun to think very seriously
about professional football.
"The pros are definitely some

thing I want to do," Baty said. "I
really want to play. (Cornerback)
Toi Cook always comes up to me
and asks, 'Are you going to go for
the pros?' and I say 'Yes.' He says
he loves to hear that because so
many guys go, 'Ah, I don't know,
maybe.' "
Baty, a native of Sparta, N.J., is
one of the few seniors on the team
with a shot at being drafted next
year. In fact, he's one of the few
seniors period — as far as he
knows, he's the only member of his
freshman recruiting class who is not
coming back for a fifth season.
"I almost feel like I should be
coming back," Baty said. "All these
guys have another year, and I'm
gone. It's a weird feeling. I'm kind
of in between groups."
Which is the way tight ends
usually feel — in between groups.
"We're kind of oddballs," Baty
said. "We're not really receivers,
and we're not really offensive
linemen. I like it that way."
