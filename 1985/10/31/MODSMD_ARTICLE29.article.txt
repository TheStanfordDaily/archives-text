## Senior Baty Has Saved His Best for Last 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
Stanford tight end Greg Baty has
saved his best for last.
After catching a total of 24
passes in his first three seasons on
the Farm, Baty came out for his
senior year determined to produce
the numbers he knew he was capa
ble of.
"Before the season, I sat down
with the coaches, and we set some
personal goals for me," Baty said.
"They wanted me to be more in
volved in the offense, and we
decided that 44 catches — four a
game — would be a good year."
It's time to reset those goals.
After just seven games, the 6-foot
6, 240-pound Baty has pulled down
46 passes. That's the second-best
total in the Pac-10 Conference, the
fifth-best in the nation and the best
ever by a Stanford tight end.
How did it happen? What made
the difference between a 20-catch
receiver in 1984 and a candidate for
the 1985 All-Conference team?
"Two things," Baty said. "First,
I'm not rotating plays in anymore.
Second, it's just a matter of
(quarterback) John Paye having
more confidence in me. When
something works, you keep going
back to it."
; Baty works. He blocks well on
the line, and when he catches the
ball it's usually in the middle of the
field, where he has to take — and
give — some pretty hard hits.
; "I like catching balls over the
middle," Baty admitted. "The job of
the tight end is to catch the ball and
hm somebody over. Coach Oimmy)
Walsh has really drilled that into my
head. It pumps up the team, and it
intimidates the defense."


"The job of the tight end is to catch the ball and run over somebody," Cardinal
senior Greg Baty said. Baty, a big target at 6-foot-6 and 240 pounds, has had 46

chances already this year to lay a lick on unsuspecting defenders. Those 46
catches have eclipsed the old single-season record for a Stanford tight end.
