# Strike Would Limit Services
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writers 
If members of United Stanford
Workers vote to strike today, Uni
versity Food Service operations
will be limited severely beginning
tomorrow.
Most University Food Service
cafeterias will close after dinner
tonight if the union goes on strike,
according to University Food Ser
vice Director Jim Keeton.
Keeton said students will be
given refunds beginning tomorrow
with which they may purchase
meals from Saga operations at
Tresidder Union, off-campus res
taurants or the two food service
cafeterias that will remain open.
Breakfasts and lunches will be
available at Wilbur and Florence
Moore Halls on weekdays beginning
tomorrow. Breakfast will be served

from 7-10:30 a.m. for $1.75, and
lunch will be offered from 10:30
a.m.-2 p.m. for $3.50. Dinners will
not be offered.
"The philosophy of being open
for breakfast and lunch was that
those were the times when people
have academic commitments,"
Keeton said.
The two facilities will be staffed
by students, food service adminis
trators and non-striking employees,
Keeton said.
Fraternity, co-op and self-op
houses are expected to remain
open during a possible strike be
cause they do not employ union
workers.
Several Stanford co-ops will join
forces to offer extended food ser
vice to students, according to Lee
Altenberg, a member of the Co-op
Council.
Altenberg said a sign-up sheet
will be posted in front of Columbae House
this afternoon for students interested in
eating — and perhaps preparing food — in
co : ops during a strike. Although plans are
still tentative, Altenberg said more than
100 students could be fed each night if co
ops extend their services.
Co-op house managers will meet with
USW members to organize delivery of food

and supplies to co-ops, according to Alten
berg. USW members have offered to help
co-ops feed extra students by cooking and
delivering food to the co-ops.
A memo outlining food service strike
procedures will be distributed to all campus
residents this morning, but yesterday
Keeton described parts of the food service
response to possible strike conditions.
Students will be given weekly refunds for
meals they do not receive. The amount of
the food service refunds will vary according
to the meal plan students have purchased.
Students with a 19-meal plan will receive

s 72 per week, while students with a five
meal plan will receive $36 per week. The
first refunds will cover the period from to
morrow until Sunday, Nov. 10.
Keeton said food service officials still are
deciding what to do if a strike ends in mid
week. Options include continuing the pay
per-meal plan until the end of the
already-refunded week, or returning to the
regular card-run system immediately and
billing students for surplus refunds.
Meanwhile, administrators at Tresidder
Union braced themselves for the onslaught
of students that may throng the facility for

food if a strike closes food service.
Paul Szczesiul, assistant director of
Tresidder Union, said food service opera
tions there will extend hours and provide
additional service at lunchtime. He said
Tresidder may open a "satellite" food oper
ation on the Tresidder patio to accommo
date overflow crowds, and management
may shift extra personnel to food service
operations.
Only the 11 maintenance workers at
Tresidder are USW members, Szczesiul
said, adding that administrators are "ready
to roll up their sleeves and help" with main

tenance if necessary.
He said he anticipated some problems in
getting deliveries through picket lines, but
added that Tresidder has assurances from
its suppliers that "products will get in."
Sue Tatum, who manages Saga food ser
vice operations on campus, said her goal is
to "accommodate as many people as we
possibly can."
Saga's main cafeteria in Tresidder will
remain open for dinner until 8 p.m. every
night, and Encina Station, a cafeteria behind
Encina Hall, will stay open until 7 p.m.
