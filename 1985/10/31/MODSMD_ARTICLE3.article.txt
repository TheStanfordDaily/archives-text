### CHARLIE GOFEN TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writers 
If members of United Stanford
Workers vote to strike today, Uni
versity Food Service operations
will be limited severely beginning
tomorrow.
Most University Food Service
cafeterias will close after dinner
tonight if the union goes on strike,
according to University Food Ser
vice Director Jim Keeton.
Keeton said students will be
given refunds beginning tomorrow
with which they may purchase
meals from Saga operations at
Tresidder Union, off-campus res
taurants or the two food service
cafeterias that will remain open.
Breakfasts and lunches will be
available at Wilbur and Florence
Moore Halls on weekdays beginning
tomorrow. Breakfast will be served

from 7-10:30 a.m. for $1.75, and
lunch will be offered from 10:30
a.m.-2 p.m. for $3.50. Dinners will
not be offered.
"The philosophy of being open
for breakfast and lunch was that
those were the times when people
have academic commitments,"
Keeton said.
The two facilities will be staffed
by students, food service adminis
trators and non-striking employees,
Keeton said.
Fraternity, co-op and self-op
houses are expected to remain
open during a possible strike be
cause they do not employ union
workers.
Several Stanford co-ops will join
forces to offer extended food ser
vice to students, according to Lee
Altenberg, a member of the Co-op
Council.
