# IM Football Fun for All
## 
### 
• While 40,000 people showed up to watch the Stan
ford varsity football team Saturday in its 28-17 victory
dver have watched Stanford
football games in which over 1,000 students and staff
participate.
. The intramural football season ends Sunday for 136
teams in the A, B, C, co-ed and women classifications,
yet their seasons have gone overlooked by most of the

campus. No stories in The Daily and no Cardinal Today
at the games. No play-by-play on KZSU. No campus
wide concern over shoulders and sternums.
Yet these teams come out every week and go at it
for whatever reasons — fame and glory not being
among them.
"This is more competition than a Chem 31 midterm
with all those pre-meds," junior Rob Pietras said. "It's
a kickass way to get away from it all."
"It's cool because even guys who were all-state in
high school can't make the varsity teams here," junior
Dan Curran said. "It's the only place you get to play."
"And it's cool to beat the hell out of frat dudes,"
junior Jeff Keller said.
Whatever the reasons, 23 six-team leagues have
been going strong all quarter. "Excluding the forfeits,

it's gone fairly well," said Rocky Becker of the Intra
mural Office. "People are getting to play, and that's
wljaJSßHfkes everoneJteppy."
The all-University B league is the most popular, with
72 teams in 12 leagues. Becker said that Kappa Sigma,
the Third-Year Law School and Murray in Exile seem to
be the top contenders for the University championship.
Others that will give them a run should be Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, the Stingers, Toyon, the Gomads, Grove and
the Tempus.
"It is difficult for dorm teams to win," Becker said.
"Teams that win are those that stay together for a
couple of years." He said that the graduate schools, es
pecially the third-year law and second-year business
schools and fraternities are the most likely to keep a
team together for more than one year.
This is apparent in the one A league, where Biz 2
and Theta Delta Chi are the teams to beat, though
Roble has been surprising.
Kappa Sigma and Murray in Exile have appeared as
the cream of the co-ed leagues, but Loro, the Cheap
Shots, Orgy 79 and Whitman will challenge.
A major problem with football this season has been
officiating. The IM office would like to assign two offi
cials to each game, but has been shorthanded. "We've
really had a problem with referees," Becker said. "It's
a problem for individual referees who have to work
alone and for the teams if there aren't two refs."
The IM office pays regular officials $5.15 each game,
but has been forced to rely on obligation officials —

referees provided by each
team in the leagues — to pick
up the slack. They haven't,
though. "Obligation refs have
been a problem," Becker
said. "Only about 40 percent
of the teams have provided
them."
The only other difficulty
this quarter has been "a f> >v
isolated incidents of people
fighting," Becker said.
For 28 B teams, the
playoffs will begin Wednesday
and run on Fridays, Sundays
and Wednesday for the follow
ing two weeks, with the final
scheduled for Nov. 17.
So, if you have the time be
tween midterms and have a
friend playing, drift down to
the EVI fields and watch for an
hour.
