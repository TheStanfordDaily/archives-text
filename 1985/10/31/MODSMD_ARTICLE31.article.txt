# Hockey Takes Tigers 2-1
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
The crowd at yesterday's field
hockey game was small, but very
vocal.
And they had a lot to be vocal
about as the Cardinal defeated the
University of the Pacific 2-1 in a
game which included everything
from a controversial, disallowed
goal to a winning shot that the
losing goalie did not even try to
save.
The win is Stanford's sixth in a
row and puts it at the top of the
Northern Pacific Conference. Its
record now stands at 7-3-1 overall
and 3-1-1 in NorPac play. With the
loss, UOP's record dropped to 2-7-
1, 2-2-1 in the conference.
Host Stanford played almost
flawlessly in the first half, yet was
able to score only once. The goal
came with 23:11 gone when Co
captain Karen Chamberlain, who
beat defenders throughout the
game, recovered a defensive clear
just outside the penalty circle and
began to operate. She faked and
feinted past four Tigers and drew
two more out of their defensive
positions.

Chamberlain's maneuvers left
junior forward Maree Chung wide
open in front of the goal. She
received Chamberlain's perfect
pass and flicked it by UOP keeper
Shari Megginson.
The second half saw a com
placent Cardinal squad almost give
away a sure win. Senior Lisa
Stewart said, "We definitely out
played them in the first half. We
played well, we played our
game. . . . The second half? I don't
know what happened."
Cardinal Coach Sheryl Johnson
was pretty sure what happened. "It
could only be mental, because the
first half was great," she said.
Neither team had an edge in the
second stanza until, with about
eight minutes elapsed, the Tigers
scored. A Stanford mistake led to a
free hit for UOP from about 20
yards out. The ball ricocheted off a
couple sticks into the Cardinal
penalty circle where an open Tiger
reached the ball first and put it by
keeper Karen Jones at close range.
The Cardinal failed to bounce
back, and, for awhile, it looked as if
yesterday's game would be a repeat
of the two teams' early-season 1-1
tie. "Their goal was unexpected,
and we didn't come back from it,"

Chamberlain said.
Then, with only five minutes
remaining in regulation, Stanford
returned to form, and it seemed in
evitable that they would score.
They didn't waste much time as, at
31:28, Chamberlain scored with
some major help from UOP goalie
Megginson.
Chamberlain received the ball
from freshman Alison Smith off a
free hit. From 30 yards out she
drove the ball down the center of
the field, expecting a cutting
teammate to pick up her pass.
Nobody touched Chamberlain's
feed, though, and it rolled right at
Megginson. The freshman goalie,
who was in position to make a
routine stop, inexplicably stepped
aside and watched the ball bounce
into the cage.
For a moment there was com
plete silence; even the referee was
unsure what had happened. Still
somewhat confused, but sure the
goal had been a fair one, she blew
her whistle and signalled that Stan
ford had scored. Megginson
realized her error and turned her
back to the field kicking the ground
in disgust.
Cardinal players attributed her
error to a lapse in concentration.
