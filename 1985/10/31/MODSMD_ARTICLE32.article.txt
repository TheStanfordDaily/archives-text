# Card's Scoreless Tie Dims Playoff Chances
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
The Stanford men's soccer
team's hopes for an NCAA tourn
ament bid dimmed as the sun set
on a 0-0 overtime tie with UC-
Davis late yesterday afternoon.
Both teams had multiple
scoring opportunities over the
110 minutes of play, but the ball
just didn't want to go in the net.
The tie put Stanford's record at
10-6-3 on the season, while the
Mustangs are now 10-4-3. The
decision ended the Cardinal win
ning streak at 5 games and hurt
prospects for post-season play.
"What happened today kind of
destroyed the season," Stanford
midfielder Tim Westergren said.
"We didn't capitalize on our
chances, and it dealt a severe

blow to our chances for an NCAA
bid."
Scoreless ties are not always
boring. In fact, yesterday's game
was fast paced and had frequent
flurries of offensive activity.
Davis controlled the ball in the
first five minutes, and from there
play moved up and down the field
all afternoon.
Stanford usually likes to set up
its attack from the backfield, but
yesterday the team was not able
to do that. The Cardinal still
created some good scoring
threats, but the players were al
ways a little out of control.
On the other side, the Mus
tangs thrived on the anarchy that
ruled most of the game. Davis'
leading scorers, freshman Jesus
Rico, junior Olaf Elze and senior
Pete Arellanes worked well to

gether to pressure the Stanford
goal.
Both teams had four shots on
goal in the first half.
Each time, however, Cardinal
players were either a moment too
late to punch the passes into the
goal or kicked waywardly.
Opinions differed on which
team got the better of the play
yesterday.
"In the second half, I think we
played our game better," the
Mustangs' Rico said.
"We controlled the ball pretty
much most of the game," Stan
ford's Westergren said.
"We tied ourselves," Cardinal
sweeperback Phil Horvath said.
"Our attitude wasn't good for this
game."
