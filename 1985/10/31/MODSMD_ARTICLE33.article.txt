It's hard to play soccer when
you're worried about getting hurt.
Yesterday the women's soccer
team lost to Sonoma State by a
score of 2-0 in what turned out to
be the Cardinal's most physically
taxing game of the year. The loss
dropped Stanford's overall record
to 5-11-1.
In other parts of the world, soc
cer is called football, and it seemed
like the Cossacks had mixed up the
two. Intimidation was Sonoma's
only game plan.
"They had no skill. They pretty
much won on physical intimidation,"
Stanford goalkeeper Helen Norton
said. "Every time you got the ball
you had a fraction of a second
before you got your ankles
hacked."
As soon as the game began,
Sonoma wasted no time in showing
how they planned to play. Within
five minutes, three Cardinals had to
be removed from the game with in
juries.
And to make matters worse, the
referee seemed to have no inten

tion of hampering the Cossack's il
legal play. "I don't think the referee
handled it well. He called a few
fouls, but not near enough,"
Coach Helen Keohane said.
The tempo of the game was set.
Stanford had no choice but to
search for a way to neutralize the
Cossack's brawling style of play.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, it
was already too late.
The Cardinal forwards were
watching for incoming Sonoma
defenders and as a result were
unable to pass well and play to
gether. Stanford prefers a finesse
game, which became an impos
sibility as soon as the Cossacks
turned the Cardinal's thoughts from
scoring goals to avoiding collisions.
With 10 minutes left in the first
half, Sonoma sweeper Judy Von-
Heider broke away down the field
and sent an unassisted shot at the
Cardinal net.
For the rest of the first half and
into the second, Sonoma continued
to wear down the Cardinal squad,
but the Stanford defense refused to
break. By the end of the game, the
Cossacks had 25 shots on goal.
Norton was credited with nine
saves.
