# Linksters Finish Third
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
One could say that the Stanford women's golf team
spun its wheels yesterday.
The squad finished the day just where it began, in
third place, at the 54-hole Western Intercollegiate in
Rancho Murietta.
The Cardinal team shot a 303 yesterday to end with
a 920 for the tournament. The effort was good enough
to edge Indiana, which eventually finished in fourth
place, by two strokes.
San Jose State dominated the event from start to
finish, winning by a whopping 22 strokes over Duke.
The Spartans took 895 shots to complete the 54 holes.
Texas A&M rounded out the top five at 940.
Scores really started to climb after that. Only three
more teams managed to stay under 100 over par, and
three others (Washington State, Sacramento State,
and Oregon State) topped the 1,000-stroke mark.
Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin was quite pleased with
the Cardinal's play this week and this year.
"I felt that we had a solid performance throughout
the tournament," Baldwin said. "I'm very satisfied with
our performance thus far this season."

The Cardinal, in eighth place after the first round at
the par-72, 6,100-yard Rancho Murieta Golf Course,
was spurred to its comeback by the play of Clare Dolan
and Kay Cornelius.
Dolan played consistently throughout the tourna
ment, finishing in a tie with SJSU's Libby Wilson for
fourth place individually at 225. Cornelius shot a
second-round 69 on her way to a total of 227, which
tied her for sixth place with Duke's Jodi Logan.
Cornelius' 69 on Tuesday broke the previous tourna
ment record on the course by four strokes.
SJSU's Julie Ralls beat out teammate Lisa Ipkendanz
and Indiana's Michele Redman for the individual cham
pionship by three strokes, 221 to 224.
"Clare Dolan had an exceptional tournament,"
Baldwin said. "1 can't say enough about her. She will be
in the thick of things from now on."
"Kay Cornelius also had excellent second and third
rounds," he added. "She was a bit rough on opening
day, but she came back to finish up well."
Other Stanford scores were Kathy Costas at 232,
Julie Carmichael at 241 and Trish McGonigle at 243.
Baldwin also acknowleged the importance of their con
tributions.
"I think that we're finally settling into a starting
five," he said.
