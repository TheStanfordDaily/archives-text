Reagan To Face Soviet Press
WASHINGTON — In what the White House termed "a unique and
historic opportunity," President Reagan will be questioned by four
Soviet journalists in the Oval Office today, the first such presidential
interview since John Kennedy sat down with an Izvestia editor in
1961.
The move is yet another signal that Reagan hopes to blunt the fa
vorable impression Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has made upon
world opinion in advance of their summit meeting next month in
Geneva.
"We hope it is a sign of a new and more open information policy on
the part of the Soviet Union," White House spokesman Larry
Speakes said.
White House spokesman Edward Djerejian first approached the
Soviets with a letter Sept. 27 requesting an interview "in the interest
of increased mutual understanding."
After almost a month of delicate maneuvering with Washington
representatives of the official Soviet news agency, TASS, the inter
view was agreed to Oct. 16.
Botha's Party Suffers Setback
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — President P.W. Botha
ruling National Party, facing a strong white voter backlash after a
year of civil unrest, retained three of the parliamentary seats at
stake in crucial by-elections here yesterday, but lost one to an ex
treme right-wing party.
The Herstigte Nasionale Party, campaigning against racial integra
tion and appealing to white fears of black domination, won its first
parliamentary seat since its formation in 1969 in Sasolburg, an indus
trial town 45 miles south of Johannesburg, in what appeared to be a
widespread loss of support for the government's policies of gradual
reform.
In two of the seats they retained, the Nationalists faced strong
right-wing challenges from the Conservative Party, which cut deeply
into the support they have long had among Dutch-descended
Afrikaaners. Four rival candidates split the opposition vote in the
other constituency, giving the Nationalists their only easy victory.
The loss of one or two seats would not affect the National Party's
control of the white House of Assembly in the country's tricameral
Parliament. However, the clear shift away from the Nationalists ap
peared to represent a rejection by many voters, though not a
majority, of Botha's step-by-step reforms, the main issue of the elec
tion.
All five seats at stake had long been held by the Nationalists, who
have been in power since 1948, and the strength of their popular
support is now in question. Much will depend on how Botha and his
party interpret the election results as a signal to slow the political,
economic and social changes they have been gradually introducing
and to reduce their scope, or as a mandate, however narrow, to con
tinue the step-by-step reform of apartheid, South Africa's system of
racial separation and minority white rule.
IMF Withholds Philippine Loan
WASHINGTON — The International Monetary Fund, with full
backing from the Reagan Administration, has withheld a $453 million
loan to the Philippines because President Ferdinand Marcos has
refused to carry out promised economic reforms threatening the in
terests of his close associates.
Disclosure of the new financial pressure on the Marcos regime
came to light yesterday in a Senate hearing in which the Administra
tion's top Asian experts predicted "civil war on a massive scale" in
the Philippines without "a comprehensive counterinsurgency plan"
against the communist rebels.
Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Armitage told the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee that such a plan must combine politi
cal, economic and social reforms with a "new vigorous leadership" in
a Philippine military purge of "overstaying generals."
Despite "some apparent progress" toward military reform and the
government's ability to cope with the communist New People's
Army insurgency, Armitage estimated that fighting within three to
five years would reach "a strategic stalemate." That was defined by
Assistant Secretary of State Paul Wolfowitz as "civil war on a
massive scale."
Craxi Cements Rebuilt Coalition
ROME — Prime Minister-designate Bettino Craxi yesterday
succeeded in reconstituting the same five-party coalition govern
ment that collapsed two weeks ago in the wake of the Achille Lauro
affair.
After meeting for three hours yesterday morning with leaders of
the five parties that had formed his government, Craxi announced to
journalists, "The crisis has been overcome."
Craxi confirmed that the agreement entailed using a rare constitu
tional formula under which, in effect, he would withdraw his resigna
tion of Oct. 17 and submit his original government to a parliamentary
vote of confidence next week. A positive result of the vote already
has been assured in the negotiations with party leaders.
The resolution of the crisis, brought about by disagreements
within the coalition over the government's handling of the hijacking of
the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro and its aftermath, came as Italy's
Court of Cassation ruled that the investigation into the hijacking and
the prosecution of the ship's four hijackers would be handled by
prosecutors in Genoa, the ship's port of departure.
Britain To Join SDI Program
BRUSSELS, Belgium — Britain and the United States agreed
yesterday on a framework accord setting forth the terms for partici
pation by British companies in the Reagan Administration's Strategic
Defense Initiative.
If approved by leaders of both countries, the 20-page document
will become the first government pact linking the United States with
one of its allies in the planned $26 billion research program for a
space-based missile defense system.
The draft agreement is expected to serve as a precedent for other
allies, particularly West Germany and Italy, who have awaited the
outcome of the British-American negotiations before seeking to con
clude their own deals with the United States in order to ensure a
satisfactory distribution of new technologies and research contracts.
The details of the accord were sealed at a meeting here yesterday
of Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and British Defense
Minister Michael Heseltine, following a nuclear planning session of
North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense ministers.
The Reagan Administration believes such government accords
could solidify the backing of allies for the controversial SDI program,
which the Soviet Union contends is the chief obstacle to future arms
control treaties.

Foreign Relations Committee that such a plan must combine politi
cal, economic and social reforms with a "new vigorous leadership" in
a Philippine military purge of "overstaying generals."
Despite "some apparent progress" toward military reform and the
government's ability to cope with the communist New People's
Army insurgency, Armitage estimated that fighting within three to
five years would reach "a strategic stalemate." That was defined by
Assistant Secretary of State Paul Wolfowitz as "civil war on a
massive scale."
Craxi Cements Rebuilt Coalition
ROME — Prime Minister-designate Bettino Craxi yesterday
succeeded in reconstituting the same five-party coalition govern
ment that collapsed two weeks ago in the wake of the Achille Lauro
affair.
After meeting for three hours yesterday morning with leaders of
the five parties that had formed his government, Craxi announced to
journalists, "The crisis has been overcome."
Craxi confirmed that the agreement entailed using a rare constitu
tional formula under which, in effect, he would withdraw his resigna
tion of Oct. 17 and submit his original government to a parliamentary
vote of confidence next week. A positive result of the vote already
has been assured in the negotiations with party leaders.
The resolution of the crisis, brought about by disagreements
within the coalition over the government's handling of the hijacking of
the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro and its aftermath, came as Italy's
Court of Cassation ruled that the investigation into the hijacking and
the prosecution of the ship's four hijackers would be handled by
prosecutors in Genoa, the ship's port of departure.
Britain To Join SDI Program
BRUSSELS, Belgium — Britain and the United States agreed
yesterday on a framework accord setting forth the terms for partici
pation by British companies in the Reagan Administration's Strategic
Defense Initiative.
If approved by leaders of both countries, the 20-page document
will become the first government pact linking the United States with
one of its allies in the planned $26 billion research program for a
space-based missile defense system.
The draft agreement is expected to serve as a precedent for other
allies, particularly West Germany and Italy, who have awaited the
outcome of the British-American negotiations before seeking to con
clude their own deals with the United States in order to ensure a
satisfactory distribution of new technologies and research contracts.
The details of the accord were sealed at a meeting here yesterday
of Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and British Defense
Minister Michael Heseltine, following a nuclear planning session of
North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense ministers.
The Reagan Administration believes such government accords
could solidify the backing of allies for the controversial SDI program,
which the Soviet Union contends is the chief obstacle to future arms
control treaties.
Reagan To Face Soviet Press
WASHINGTON — In what the White House termed "a unique and
historic opportunity," President Reagan will be questioned by four
Soviet journalists in the Oval Office today, the first such presidential
interview since John Kennedy sat down with an Izvestia editor in
1961.
The move is yet another signal that Reagan hopes to blunt the fa
vorable impression Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has made upon
world opinion in advance of their summit meeting next month in
Geneva.
"We hope it is a sign of a new and more open information policy on
the part of the Soviet Union," White House spokesman Larry
Speakes said.
White House spokesman Edward Djerejian first approached the
Soviets with a letter Sept. 27 requesting an interview "in the interest
of increased mutual understanding."
After almost a month of delicate maneuvering with Washington
representatives of the official Soviet news agency, TASS, the inter
view was agreed to Oct. 16.
Botha's Party Suffers Setback
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — President P.W. Botha
ruling National Party, facing a strong white voter backlash after a
year of civil unrest, retained three of the parliamentary seats at
stake in crucial by-elections here yesterday, but lost one to an ex
treme right-wing party.
The Herstigte Nasionale Party, campaigning against racial integra
tion and appealing to white fears of black domination, won its first
parliamentary seat since its formation in 1969 in Sasolburg, an indus
trial town 45 miles south of Johannesburg, in what appeared to be a
widespread loss of support for the government's policies of gradual
reform.
In two of the seats they retained, the Nationalists faced strong
right-wing challenges from the Conservative Party, which cut deeply
into the support they have long had among Dutch-descended
Afrikaaners. Four rival candidates split the opposition vote in the
other constituency, giving the Nationalists their only easy victory.
The loss of one or two seats would not affect the National Party's
control of the white House of Assembly in the country's tricameral
Parliament. However, the clear shift away from the Nationalists ap
peared to represent a rejection by many voters, though not a
majority, of Botha's step-by-step reforms, the main issue of the elec
tion.
All five seats at stake had long been held by the Nationalists, who
have been in power since 1948, and the strength of their popular
support is now in question. Much will depend on how Botha and his
party interpret the election results as a signal to slow the political,
economic and social changes they have been gradually introducing
and to reduce their scope, or as a mandate, however narrow, to con
tinue the step-by-step reform of apartheid, South Africa's system of
racial separation and minority white rule.
IMF Withholds Philippine Loan
WASHINGTON — The International Monetary Fund, with full
backing from the Reagan Administration, has withheld a $453 million
loan to the Philippines because President Ferdinand Marcos has
refused to carry out promised economic reforms threatening the in
terests of his close associates.
Disclosure of the new financial pressure on the Marcos regime
came to light yesterday in a Senate hearing in which the Administra
tion's top Asian experts predicted "civil war on a massive scale" in
the Philippines without "a comprehensive counterinsurgency plan"
against the communist rebels.
Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Armitage told the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee that such a plan must combine politi
cal, economic and social reforms with a "new vigorous leadership" in
a Philippine military purge of "overstaying generals."
Despite "some apparent progress" toward military reform and the
