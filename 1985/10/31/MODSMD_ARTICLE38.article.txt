# U.S. May Present Arms Counterproposal
## Soviets deliver draft statement 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administra
tion is expected to ask the Soviet Union to ex
tend the current round of arms control talks in
Geneva beyond this week so the United States
can present a new proposal that would call for
deep cuts in the number of warheads on Soviet
land-based intercontinental missiles, Administra
tion sources said yesterday.
Meanwhile, diplomatic sources in Moscow
report that the Soviet Union has submitted a
draft agreement on arms control issues for U.S.
endorsement during the November summit
meeting in Geneva.
The draft outlines the "agreement in princi
ple" on space and nuclear arms issues that the
Kremlin says it is seeking at the summit, the
sources said. It is seen as part of Moscow's in
tensified bid to reach an accord with Washington
at the current Geneva arms talks.
Soviet spokesmen and U.S. Embassy person
nel in Moscow have declined to comment on the
text. But Western analysts familiar with the
rough outline of the proposal said it probably
would include the 50 percent cut in nuclear
weapons arsenals that Soviet negotiators in

Geneva already have proposed as a trade-off for
U. S. cancellation of the Strategic Defense Initia
tive. The draft is also thought to propose a sys
tem of verification for the ban on nuclear testing
that the Soviets previously have proposed.
Extension of current talks in Geneva would al
low U.S. officials to present to the Soviets what
sources described as a "comprehensive"
response to the last Soviet proposal of a 50 per
cent cut in nuclear weapons. Officials said the
extension of the current round of talks, which
are scheduled to end tomorrow, is one of several
ways being considered to answer the Soviets at
the bargaining table and in the forum of world
opinion.
The outlines of the U.S. proposal may be
carried by Secretary of State George Shultz on
his trip to Moscow early next week, and be des
cribed in President Reagan's scheduled address
to the nation before he leaves for the summit
with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the
sources said.
Administration officials said that the Soviets,
in a recent informal discussion at Geneva, sug
gested an agreement on intermediate-range nu

clear missiles that included as a first step a
freeze, beginning Dec. 1, on U.S. and Soviet
forces now in the field.
The next stage of the Soviet plan, covering a
period of 18 months, would involve a reduction in
the number of U.S. single-warhead cruise
missiles deployed in Western Europe. The
Soviets would then reduce their triple-warhead
SS-20 medium-range missile force in Europe so
that they had the same number of warheads on
their SS-20s as did the remaining U.S. cruise
missiles plus British and French missile forces.
The Soviet suggestions are under discussion
in the Administration, but there is no indication
that the United States would agree to dismantle
its Pershing 2 intermediate-range missiles.
Officials said yesterday that there is "very
little disagreement" on the substance of the U.S.
response to the Soviet proposal for a 50 percent
cut in nuclear weapons. The timing and format
for making the U.S. response was still being
debated early yesterday.
The U.S. response, in its drafted form, would
call for each side to cut the combined total of
warheads by half.
