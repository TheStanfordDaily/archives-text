# Gunmen Release Soviet Hostages

### 
BEIRUT — Three Soviet Em
bassy officials kidnapped by gun
men a month ago were freed un
harmed yesterday, two days after
Syrian officials met with Lebanese
Moslems and leftists to press for
their release.
Jubilant Soviet diplomats publicly
credited "the help of all our friends"
in the region, including Syria, for
the resolution of the crisis, but they
gave no details of how it was
achieved.
The official Syrian Arab News
Agency said last night that "special
security agencies" had "secured
the release of the three Soviets"
but it did not elaborate.
A statement telephoned to news

agencies in the name of the Islamic
Liberation Organization, which had
claimed responsibility for the kid
napping, said the Soviet "spies" had
been released as a gesture of "good
will" and as a reminder of the cap
tors' original demand for an end to
attacks on Islamic fundamentalist
forces in Tripoli, in northern
Lebanon. The attacking forces are
backed by Syria, the chief Soviet
ally in the region.
The message made no mention
of the slaying of a fourth kidnapped
Soviet, Arkady Katkov, whose
bullet-riddled body was found in a
desolate area of Beirut on Oct. 2,
two days after the four were seized
while driving near the Soviet Em

bassy in Moslem West Beirut.
There also was no indication of
any progress toward the release of
six Americans who have been held
captive here for periods ranging up
to 19 months.
The three Soviets — attache
Oleg Spirine, commercial represen
tative Valery Mirikov and embassy
physician Nikolai Svirsky —
reportedly walked to their embassy
early yesterday night after being let
out of a car by their captors a few
blocks away.
Lebanese leftist sources said the
Soviets, although healthy, were
tired and looked haggard after their
ordeal and were examined by doc
tors at the embassy.

West Beirut resounded with a
deafening din that frightened many
residents as Moslem and leftist
militiamen fired rockets, rifles and
anti-aircraft guns to mark the
release — a traditional method of
celebration here. Soviet Embassy
personnel, upon hearing of the
freeing of their comrades, rushed
to a store and bought whiskey and
vodka to celebrate, shopworkers
said.
There were widespread reports
and evidence that the Soviet Union
and Syria, which has several
thousand troops in Lebanon and
was highly embarrassed by the kid
napping, had begun an all-out effort
to gain the captives' release.
