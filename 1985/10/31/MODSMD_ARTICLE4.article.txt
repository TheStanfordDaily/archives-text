# Petition Pans SDI
## 
### ERIC HEALY 
A petition calling for professors as
"working scientists" to vow that they "will
not apply for or accept support from the
Strategic Defense Institute, which funds
'Star Wars' research" is circulating around
Stanford and other American universities
that receive research funds from SDI.
Although the petition was originated by
physicists at Cornell University, the ver
sion of the petition that is presently
making its way among relevant Stanford
faculty members was authored at the Uni
versity of Illinois by physicist John Cogut,
Michael Weissman and Larry Smarr,
known for work with black holes.
In the petition, the authors base their
aversion to SDI on their professional sci
entific beliefs "that the 'Star Wars' Pro
gram is technically dubious and politically
unwise. Anti-ballistic missile defense of
sufficient reliability to defend the popula
tion of the United States against a Soviet
first strike is not technically feasible in the
foreseeable future."
Some departments at Stanford receive

more than 50 percent of their funding
from the Department of Defense, accord
ing to the program "Express," aired last
night on channel 9. The Department of
Computer Science heads the list with 75
percent of its research funds coming from
the Defense Department, according to the
program, which dealt with Star Wars re
search on university campuses.
The petition has received mixed reac
tion at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC), where 27 of 50 senior
staff or faculty members have signed it.
Eight members of the Department of
Physics have also signed the petition.
According to Michael Peskin, an associ
ate professor of theoretical physics at
SLAC, Star Wars research expendi
tures amount to nothing more than money
spent in vain.
Peskin contends that out of the 10,000
nuclear warheads that the Soviets pos
sess, only 50 would have to strike their
targets to cripple the United States. He
said the "basic problem" of the Star
Wars proposal is that it disregards the
"inevitability" that at least 50 missiles
would penetrate U.S. defenses.
