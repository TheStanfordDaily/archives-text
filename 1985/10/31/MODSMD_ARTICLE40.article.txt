House Waffles on MX
WASHINGTON — In a signal that defense
may face painful cuts under a pending
balanced-budget plan, the House voted yester
day to kill $1.7 billion for the MX, then turned
and reversed itself only after stunned White
House officials warned that the action would
damage President Reagan in his summit with
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
The MX votes occurred as the Democrat
controlled House easily passed a defense
spending bill that contained one major setback
the Administration was unable to overcome, a
refusal to fund renewed production of chemical
weapons.
Lawmakers said yesterday that the initial
vote to eliminate all MX missile funds from the
fiscal 1986 defense-spending bill was the first
indication of the tough new scrutiny Congress
will beginning applying to all programs, even
those most favored by the president, if it
adopts a plan to force a balanced federal
budget by 1991.
The MX vote was fhe only major source of
controversy in the defense bill yesterday, after
the White House abandoned an effort to
restore $164 million cut by the House Appro
priations Committee for renewed production
of chemical weapons. Nerve-gas supporters
said they did not have the votes to win.
Challenger Takes Off
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — The space
shuttle Challenger departed yesterday on a
scientific mission chartered entirely by the
West German space agency, ferrying eight

people and a room-sized research laboratory
into a circular orbit 201 miles above Earth.
Aboard Challenger, in addition to five Amer
ican astronauts, are two from West Germany
and one from the Netherlands. The Europeans
are scientists who will conduct a planned 76
experiments in the Spacelab module, an 18-
foot-long capsule mounted in the shuttle's
cargo bay.
The laboratory was designed, built and
checked out in Europe before being flown to
Florida and installed in the shuttle.
Mission control for all the scientific opera
tions during the planned seven-day flight will
be at the German space agency's center in
Oberpfaffenhofen, near Munich. Ground con
trol for flying the shuttle will be in Houston, as
usual.
Only two problems, both said to be minor so
far, have emerged. A temperature-control
valve on one of the spacecraft's three
electricity-supplying fuel cells was mal
functioning, causing its temperature to fluc
tuate too much. Still, flight controllers said,
the fuel cell was delivering its full output of
electricity. If the problem becomes worse, it
could force a cutback in the experiments to be
done.
A second problem involved another valve,
one that keeps fuel flowing to attitude-control
thrusters on the shuttle's right side. A backup
valve, however, had taken over the function
and was working properly.
German space oficials say Spacelab is a
major step toward what they hope will be a
larger laboratory module attached to a per
manent American space station that NASA
envisions for the 19905.

Storm Strikes Again
NEW ORLEANS — Tropical Storm Juan
looped for the third time over Louisiana yes
terday, pounding the coast with rain and tides
that caused some of the worst flooding in a
century and leaving at least seven people dead.
Officials searched for eight people who
remained missing in the Gulf of Mexico and
preliminary damage estimates were placed at
$1 billion.
Thousands were forced from their homes
yesterday southwest and north of New Or
leans while 50,000 residences were damaged
by flooding.
"We have damage estimate crews out right
now, but there are many areas where the
water is so high they simply cannot get to
them," said Janet Merritt, director of disaster
operations for Louisiana Office of Emergency
Preparedness.
Louisiana state officials said at least 50,000
residences have been damaged. A civil
defense official in Terrebonne Parish said
about 80 percent of the homes in low-lying
areas have water in them and about 30,000
people have been evacuated.
Stocks Garner Gains
NEW YORK — The stock market rolled up
another gain yesterday, carrying the Dow
Jones industrial average to a record closing
high as interest rates dropped.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
climbed 6.84 to 1,375.57, surpassing the pre
vious closing peak of 1,369.29 it reached on
Oct. 17. The average rose 8.74 on Tuesday.

checked out in Europe before being flown to
Florida and installed in the shuttle.
Mission control for all the scientific opera
tions during the planned seven-day flight will
be at the German space agency's center in
Oberpfaffenhofen, near Munich. Ground con
trol for flying the shuttle will be in Houston, as
usual.
Only two problems, both said to be minor so
far, have emerged. A temperature-control
valve on one of the spacecraft's three
electricity-supplying fuel cells was mal
functioning, causing its temperature to fluc
tuate too much. Still, flight controllers said,
the fuel cell was delivering its full output of
electricity. If the problem becomes worse, it
could force a cutback in the experiments to be
done.
A second problem involved another valve,
one that keeps fuel flowing to attitude-control
thrusters on the shuttle's right side. A backup
valve, however, had taken over the function
and was working properly.
German space oficials say Spacelab is a
major step toward what they hope will be a
larger laboratory module attached to a per
manent American space station that NASA
envisions for the 19905.

Storm Strikes Again
NEW ORLEANS — Tropical Storm Juan
looped for the third time over Louisiana yes
terday, pounding the coast with rain and tides
that caused some of the worst flooding in a
century and leaving at least seven people dead.
Officials searched for eight people who
remained missing in the Gulf of Mexico and
preliminary damage estimates were placed at
$1 billion.
Thousands were forced from their homes
yesterday southwest and north of New Or
leans while 50,000 residences were damaged
by flooding.
"We have damage estimate crews out right
now, but there are many areas where the
water is so high they simply cannot get to
them," said Janet Merritt, director of disaster
operations for Louisiana Office of Emergency
Preparedness.
Louisiana state officials said at least 50,000
residences have been damaged. A civil
defense official in Terrebonne Parish said
about 80 percent of the homes in low-lying
areas have water in them and about 30,000
people have been evacuated.
Stocks Garner Gains
