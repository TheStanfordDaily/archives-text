Whale Pregnant?
RIO VISTA — A 45-ton humpback whale
who prefers warm inland waters over the cool
Pacific Ocean may be pregnant, officials said
yesterday.
The theory surfaced as experts regrouped
to find an effective way to coax the whale out
of the Sacramento River and back to sea.
"Based on the behavior pattern, it's a strong
possibility (that the whale is pregnant)," said
Bev Passerello, spokeswoman for the state
Office of Emergency Services.
It would help explain the 40-foot whale's
rugged, maybe maternal, resistance to leave
the warm waters where it wandered Oct. 11,
she said.

Humphrey, as the whale was nicknamed
before the latest theory surfaced, may be
looking for comfortable water to give birth in,
much like female whales' migration to the
coastal waters off Baja California and the
Hawaiian islands, she added.
Lottery Sales Soar
SACRAMENTO — Lottery commissioners
happily wrestling with woes created by
runaway ticket sales pondered ways yesterday
to churn out jackpot winners more swiftly and
adopted higher prizes for game two, which
they said may begin within two weeks.
"Success causes a lot of problems," said

chairman Howard Varner as commissioners
were told that staff has been rushed into start
ing distribution today of 300 million tickets
for game two, which commissioners formally
decided would offer "instant" prizes of up to
$10,000 and grand prize jackpots of up to $3
million.
With virtually all of the 400 million game-one
tickets sold or in the hands of retailers at the
four-week mark, the lottery next week is ex
pected to announce a subsequent starting date
of the next scratch-off ticket game, "Sky's The
Limit."
We may be talking about a game totally out
of tickets in a couple weeks," commissioner
John Price said of the current "California Jack
pot." Added Varner: "Or possibly sooner."
