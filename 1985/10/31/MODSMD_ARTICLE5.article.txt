# Senate Should Become Smaller Say Senators
## 
### MARY McDEVITT Staff writer 
Several ASSU senators agreed that the
senate needs to be reconstructed and made
smaller during a meeting between the Council
of Presidents (COP) and students at Branner
Lounge last night.
A Council of Presidents proposal for
reconstruction of the senate, which COP
members Andy Frisch, Tim Quirk and Mike
Collins are drafting, would cut the number of
senators in half and would call for job-specific
elections in which each voter would select
one candidate instead of 10, they said.
The proposal, which should be completed
by the end of next week, will include the dis
banding of the current senate, although a new
student legislative body will be constructed,
Quirk and Collins said. The new structure
would include the Program Board and the
Nominations Commission, but "little else"
from the current structure, Collins said.

The COP has abandoned old proposals for
reconstruction because the system needs to
be "started again from the ground up," Quirk
said.
"It's almost a zero-sum game," said Col
lins. "It's difficult to get things much worse.
We don't have all the answers; that's why
(the proposal) is not done yet. But I think that
a small body with specified jobs will get things
done."
The senate spends a lot of time "rewriting
bylaws that don't affect anyone else," Quirk
said.
Many senators agreed that the senate is
too large and filled with ineffective bureau
cratic complexities.
"Last week we voted on whether people
should get two minutes or three minutes to
speak (at meetings)," said Zenon Kuc, a
graduate senator from engineering. "It's just
ridiculous. A smaller group would be more in
formal and things would get done quicker."
Senators' roles are nebulous and their
senses of accountability are mini
mal, some senators said. "Now
there are few pressures to do any
thing because there are 39 other
people," Kuc said. "With a smaller
senate, everybody would have

more of a say."
By having specified jobs,
senators would be held more ac
countable, but the creativity pool
could be weakened, said under
graduate Senator Ed Renwick.
"One problem is that initiating proj
ects would be an individual thing. I
would hate to see a student govern
ment devoid of creativity . . . but I

am not against the idea of disband
ing the senate."
Senate Chair Carey White agreed
that the senate might be improved
by reconstruction, "depending on
the way (the COP members) do it,"
but he said that there are two sides
to the proposed changes. "Fewer
people theoretically would mean
more accountability," he said. "But

fewer people would also mean
fewer good people."
White said he thinks "job
specificity is a good idea. And it
doesn't have to be just on the sen
ate side . . . the COP could run as a
slate or separately. This system
seems to work well (in other stu
dent governments) because each
(representative) is accountable."
