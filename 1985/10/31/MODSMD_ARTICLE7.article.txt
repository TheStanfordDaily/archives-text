# Trekking Reps Add Personal Touch
## Visiting high schools, though, doesn't draw more applicants 
### DAN DeLUCE Staff writer 
Stanford admissions officers are visiting high
schools not to increase the number of applicants,
but rather to "personalize" the admissions
process, according to John Bunnell, associate
dean and director of freshman admissi >ns.
Admissions representatives visit approxi
mately 600 of the nation's 26,000 high schools.
Stanford is currently one of the most difficult uni
versities to which to gain admission, with 17,500
applications for only 2,400 undergraduate spaces
last year.
In hopes of testing the effect of sending
campus representatives to high schools, the ad
missions office recenth "decided not to visit
areas we would generally visit," Bunnell said.
Results showed that there was no direct cor
relation between high school visits and applica
tions received.
In fact, Bunnell said, "In some cases the num
ber of applicants (from high schools which were
selected to be excluded from visits in the test)
increased."
Bunnell said Stanford's presence remains im
portant, however, despite such results.
"We are there to learn from them, to see stu
dents firsthand," he said.
"I think it's valuable to sit down to talk to a

counselor or a student on his home turf. . . .
People will ask questions on their home ground
they won't ask when visiting," Bunnell said.
Also, by visiting a secondary school, according
to Bunnell, admissions staff are able to absorb
helpful background information about a school's
curriculum and student body.
"It's valuable for the staff to see all the differ
ences between various (secondary) schools,"
Bunnell said.
Aiding the Admissions Office's efforts to reach
prospective applicants is a new film produced by
Page Konrad for her master's project in the
Communication Department.
She and fellow communication graduate stu
dents spent almost a year on the 13-minute film,
entitled "Stanford Today."
Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter said the film
gives "an idea of the Stanford atmosphere. It
can't be conveyed totally by literature or even by
a visit."
"I wanted to make people think, to give them
some concept of what is possible at Stanford,"
said Konrad.
"Page Konrad did a great job given the time
crunch and financial constaints," Bunnell added.
When presented along with a recent graduate
and an admissions representative, the film pro

vides "a good balance to the evening," Bunnell
said.
The Alumni Association, Office of Develop
ment and Department of Athletics will also be
using the film.
Bunnell said high school visits serve a purpose
"if you think of it as part of a larger effort" con
ducted by the Admissions Office.
There are "a number of ways to decide" which
schools the Admissions Office visits, he said.
Leading factors are logistics and economics.
"We try to get a feel for where applicants are
coming from,"he said.
"Economics is a factor; we don't have money
to burn," Bunnell said.
"We're not going to go into an area where we
haven't had any interest before.
"We hope to get the qualified student to ac
cept, to enroll if he's accepted," Bunnell said.
"At one time, maybe we wanted to get the
numbers (of applicants) up," Bunnell added.
Bunnell said admissions staff visiting second
ary schools serve to make the application
process more personal, sometimes to the point
that "you are Stanford" to people across the na
tion.
This power "is kind of scary and humbling,"
Bunnell said.
