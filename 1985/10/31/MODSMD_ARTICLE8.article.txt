# Hormone Tested at Med Center OK'd
## 
### MATTHEW REEVES 
A new synthetic growth hormone, Protropin,
manufactured by Genentech Inc. and tested at
the Stanford Medical Center, was approved for
use 10 days ago by the Food and Drug Adminis
tration, allowing physicians to resume treatment
of growth hormone deficiency in children.
Before Protropin, the deficiency \vas treated
with doses of the natural growth hormone ex
tracted from the pituitary glands of human
cadavers. This treatment was stopped approxi
mately six months ago when evidence indicated a
possible link between the treatment and a rare
and fatal infection called Creutzfeld-Jakob
disease, according to Raymond Hintz, professor
of pediatrics at the medical school.
Protropin, chemically identical to the natural
hormone with the addition of an amino acid, can
not be contaminated with the virus responsible
for the disease, according to Hintz.

Hintz said he feels the new synthetic hormone
is completely safe, but added, "There is always
the chance that harmful side effects (from
Protropin) may show up later."
Children who suffer from growth hormone
deficiency and do not receive treatment may
grow to no more than half the average size for an
adult. Treatment with Protropin will "help
people who would be ostracized from our society
and treated as children all their lives get to nor
mal height," Hintz said.
Because treatment with the synthetic growth
hormone must begin before a child reaches pu
berty in order to be effective, use of the
hormone to achieve extra height in people with
out any growth hormone deficiency is not a
viable possibility. "We are not concerned with
performing 'cosmetic work.' We are treating
people who need the hormone to lead normal
lives," Hintz said.
Treatment with Protropin for one year cur-

rently will cost approximately $10,000 for the
average case, a price lower than that for the nat
ural hormone. "Although the price now is high,
as the market develops and competition in
creases, the price for the synthetic hormone is
almost certain to drop significantly," Hintz said.
Both the State of California and Genentech
Inc. have indicated a willingness to subsidize the
cost of treatment in cases involving under
privileged patients, according to Hintz.
With the use of Protropin rather than the natu
ral hormone, "there exists the potential for
having enough supply to treat everyone in
need," Hintz said.
Approximately 15 children are receiving
Protropin treatment at the medical center, ac
cording to Hintz. The medical center is also in
the process of adding to the treatment program
another 50 children who, after use of the natural
hormone was discontinued, have not been able
to receive treatment for the last six months.
