Violence and vandalism could become unfortunate
side effects of a United Stanford Workers strike, Uni
versity officials said yesterday.

During the first week of the 1982 Stanford service
employees strike, 37 tires were slashed at Bonair
Siding, toilets were plugged in the Press Building, a
stink bomb was dropped in the lobby of Encina Hall, a
bomb threat occurred at Stanford Medical School and
spikes were thrown under cars at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center. Six pickets were arrested and

charged with vandalism.
"We saw a higher level of suspicious kinds of activi
ties around here than we normally did, and I would im
agine that there would be more of that (if union
employees go on strike)," said Paul Szczesiul, assis
tant director of Tresidder Union.
But USW President Dennis Blake said discussion of
violence and vandalism is a ploy often used in
management-union conflicts to discredit the union.
"That's always something that's a worry," Blake
said. "Any employer tries to play it up. Employers are
known to engage people in vandalism to make unions
look bad, to hire agents provacateurs."
University chief negotiator Priscilla Wheeler said
Stanford will use all legal methods available to ensure
that there is no strike-related violence or vandalism.
Several scuffles between pickets and non-union
employees also broke out during the 1982 strike. Blake
said yesterday that union employees "will defend
themselves if attacked on the picket line. That's not
vandalism."
Wheeler said the University may set up "reserve
gates" through which non-Stanford employees may
pass, without crossing picket lines, to do work on
campus, thus avoiding conflicts between pickets and
other workers.
