# Workers Vote To Reject Strike Call
## USW accepts University's final offer 
### MARK BEYREIS MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writers 
A United Stanford Workers strike was averted yes
terday when union members voted 457-185 to accept
the University's final contract offer.
But in a meeting held immediately after the vote, the
union members approved a statement indicating that
they accepted the contract under protest.
Union leaders said USW would sign the contract but
would protest implementation of the more controver
sial clauses, including those restricting job security and
union access to USW members during working hours.
"Anytime they try to implement any of that we're
going to fight. We're going to use any kind of pressure
we can to stop [the University] from treating anyone
unjustly," said USW chief negotiator Mary Ann Tenuto.
Tenuto said USW would protest by seeking commu
nity support and by continuing to meet with union
members during working hours, despite restrictions in
the new contract. "We're just going to do it anyway,"
she said.
"The first time they deny access they're going to
find not only workers, but the community there protest
ing. What (University President) Donald Kennedy is
going to be faced with are hundreds of angry workers,"
Tenuto added.
Kennedy was out of town and could not be reached
for commment.
University officials were pleased with the results of
yesterday's vote.
"We're delighted that the membership has ratified
the University's offer," said John Schwartz, vice presi
dent and peneral counsel for the University.

Schwartz, acting as spokesman for the administra
tion, also said he had not heard of the union's plans for
protest, but any disagreements that might arise would
be handled through the grievance and arbitration pro
cedure.
"If there are disputes, that's what you have griev
ance and arbitration for," said Priscilla Wheeler, chief
negotiator and staff counsel for the University.
Wheeler said she was satisfied with the outcome of
the vote. "I'm very pleased we have a settlement with
out a strike. We hope to sign a contract as soon as pos
sible," she said.
Tenuto, who said that "we've known all along that
the union would not vote to strike," estimated it would
take several weeks to sign the contract. The union
decision, however, is final, she said.
Although USW President Dennis Blake said before
the vote that a strike was a "last-ditch effort to defend
[the union's] rights," both he and Tenuto said the deci
sion to accept the contract was not a defeat for the
union.
"Even those who voted to reject the contract are
happy. We can continue to collect our paychecks while
we protest against any of the implementations on
representaton and loss of job security," Tenuto said.
Blake said he did not think the University's final offer
was an acceptable proposal, adding, "this is a situation
where workers are unhappy, but (they) weighed all the
factors and made a reasonable decision."
"The bargaining unit reacted in an intelligent manner
rather than emotionally," he said.

Unused picket signs pile up outside of Dinkelspiel Auditorium yesterday afternoon after United
Stanford Workers members voted not to strike.
The negotiating team, represent
ing 1,300 technical, service and
maintenance workers, recom
mended against accepting the Uni
versity's final offer but advised
union members to reject it only if
they were prepared to "stay out for
a long time," Tenuto said.
"What people had to do was look
deep down inside and see if they
were prepared for a protracted
strike," she said.
Schwartz and Wheeler agreed
that the union did not lose in the
contract negotiations. "The col
lective bargaining process requires
compromise on both sides. I don't
think you have losers or winners,"
Schwartz said.
"I don't think of collective bar
gaining as win-loss. This is a win for
everybody," Wheeler said.
The vote was taken at a noon
union meeting in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium and the result was an
nounced at 3 p.m. According to
Tenuto, the ballot asked voters,
"Shall the union accept the Univer
sity's final offer?"
After the announcement, 30
union members marched to the Of

fice of the President and presented
their message of acceptance and
protest to Marlene Wine, special as
sistant to the president.
"Donald Kennedy, we accepted
the contract, but under protest,"
the union's message said.
Included in the accepted proposal
is a wage increase of about 16 per
cent over the three-year contract.
The increase is retroactive to Sept.
1, when employees began working
without a contract.
The union lost its bid to keep the
contract language the same on the
issue of job security. The Univer
sity will have the right to lay-off a
union worker for "budgetary and
operational considerations" and
replace him with a non-union Uni
versity employee.
The University has said that this
section is a clarification of its rights
guaranteed in the old contract.
The union will "hold Donald Ken
nedy and Bill Massy (vice presi
dent for Business and Finance) to
what they've said it means,"
Tenuto said.
The University's final offer also
contains a stipulation that union
representatives, except when
handling grievances, limit visits to
work areas to non-working hours
"whenever practicable."

"Anytime they try to implement any of that we're
going to fight. We're going to use any kind of pressure
we can to stop [the University] from treating anyone
unjustly," said USW chief negotiator Mary Ann Tenuto.
Tenuto said USW would protest by seeking commu
nity support and by continuing to meet with union
members during working hours, despite restrictions in
the new contract. "We're just going to do it anyway,"
she said.
"The first time they deny access they're going to
find not only workers, but the community there protest
ing. What (University President) Donald Kennedy is
going to be faced with are hundreds of angry workers,"
Tenuto added.
Kennedy was out of town and could not be reached
for commment.
University officials were pleased with the results of
yesterday's vote.
"We're delighted that the membership has ratified
the University's offer," said John Schwartz, vice presi
dent and peneral counsel for the University.

Schwartz, acting as spokesman for the administra
tion, also said he had not heard of the union's plans for
protest, but any disagreements that might arise would
be handled through the grievance and arbitration pro
cedure.
"If there are disputes, that's what you have griev
ance and arbitration for," said Priscilla Wheeler, chief
negotiator and staff counsel for the University.
Wheeler said she was satisfied with the outcome of
the vote. "I'm very pleased we have a settlement with
out a strike. We hope to sign a contract as soon as pos
sible," she said.
Tenuto, who said that "we've known all along that
the union would not vote to strike," estimated it would
take several weeks to sign the contract. The union
decision, however, is final, she said.
Although USW President Dennis Blake said before
the vote that a strike was a "last-ditch effort to defend
[the union's] rights," both he and Tenuto said the deci
sion to accept the contract was not a defeat for the
union.
"Even those who voted to reject the contract are
happy. We can continue to collect our paychecks while
we protest against any of the implementations on
representaton and loss of job security," Tenuto said.
Blake said he did not think the University's final offer
was an acceptable proposal, adding, "this is a situation
where workers are unhappy, but (they) weighed all the
factors and made a reasonable decision."
"The bargaining unit reacted in an intelligent manner
rather than emotionally," he said.

Unused picket signs pile up outside of Dinkelspiel Auditorium yesterday afternoon after United
Stanford Workers members voted not to strike.
The negotiating team, represent
ing 1,300 technical, service and
maintenance workers, recom
mended against accepting the Uni
versity's final offer but advised
union members to reject it only if
they were prepared to "stay out for
a long time," Tenuto said.
"What people had to do was look
deep down inside and see if they
were prepared for a protracted
strike," she said.
Schwartz and Wheeler agreed
that the union did not lose in the
contract negotiations. "The col
lective bargaining process requires
compromise on both sides. I don't
think you have losers or winners,"
Schwartz said.
"I don't think of collective bar
gaining as win-loss. This is a win for
everybody," Wheeler said.
The vote was taken at a noon
union meeting in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium and the result was an
nounced at 3 p.m. According to
Tenuto, the ballot asked voters,
"Shall the union accept the Univer
sity's final offer?"
After the announcement, 30
union members marched to the Of

fice of the President and presented
their message of acceptance and
protest to Marlene Wine, special as
sistant to the president.
"Donald Kennedy, we accepted
the contract, but under protest,"
the union's message said.
Included in the accepted proposal
is a wage increase of about 16 per
cent over the three-year contract.
The increase is retroactive to Sept.
1, when employees began working
without a contract.
The union lost its bid to keep the
contract language the same on the
issue of job security. The Univer
sity will have the right to lay-off a
union worker for "budgetary and
operational considerations" and
replace him with a non-union Uni
versity employee.
The University has said that this
section is a clarification of its rights
guaranteed in the old contract.
The union will "hold Donald Ken
nedy and Bill Massy (vice presi
dent for Business and Finance) to
what they've said it means,"
Tenuto said.
The University's final offer also
contains a stipulation that union
representatives, except when
handling grievances, limit visits to
work areas to non-working hours
"whenever practicable."
A United Stanford Workers strike was averted yes
terday when union members voted 457-185 to accept
the University's final contract offer.
But in a meeting held immediately after the vote, the
union members approved a statement indicating that
they accepted the contract under protest.
Union leaders said USW would sign the contract but
would protest implementation of the more controver
sial clauses, including those restricting job security and
union access to USW members during working hours.
"Anytime they try to implement any of that we're
going to fight. We're going to use any kind of pressure
we can to stop [the University] from treating anyone
