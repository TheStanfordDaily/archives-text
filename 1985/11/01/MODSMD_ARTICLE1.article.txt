## USW accepts University's final offer 
### MARK BEYREIS MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writers 
A United Stanford Workers strike was averted yes
terday when union members voted 457-185 to accept
the University's final contract offer.
But in a meeting held immediately after the vote, the
union members approved a statement indicating that
they accepted the contract under protest.
Union leaders said USW would sign the contract but
would protest implementation of the more controver
sial clauses, including those restricting job security and
union access to USW members during working hours.
"Anytime they try to implement any of that we're
going to fight. We're going to use any kind of pressure
we can to stop [the University] from treating anyone
unjustly," said USW chief negotiator Mary Ann Tenuto.
Tenuto said USW would protest by seeking commu
nity support and by continuing to meet with union
members during working hours, despite restrictions in
the new contract. "We're just going to do it anyway,"
she said.
"The first time they deny access they're going to
find not only workers, but the community there protest
ing. What (University President) Donald Kennedy is
going to be faced with are hundreds of angry workers,"
Tenuto added.
Kennedy was out of town and could not be reached
for commment.
University officials were pleased with the results of
yesterday's vote.
"We're delighted that the membership has ratified
the University's offer," said John Schwartz, vice presi
dent and peneral counsel for the University.

Schwartz, acting as spokesman for the administra
tion, also said he had not heard of the union's plans for
protest, but any disagreements that might arise would
be handled through the grievance and arbitration pro
cedure.
"If there are disputes, that's what you have griev
ance and arbitration for," said Priscilla Wheeler, chief
negotiator and staff counsel for the University.
Wheeler said she was satisfied with the outcome of
the vote. "I'm very pleased we have a settlement with
out a strike. We hope to sign a contract as soon as pos
sible," she said.
Tenuto, who said that "we've known all along that
the union would not vote to strike," estimated it would
take several weeks to sign the contract. The union
decision, however, is final, she said.
Although USW President Dennis Blake said before
the vote that a strike was a "last-ditch effort to defend
[the union's] rights," both he and Tenuto said the deci
sion to accept the contract was not a defeat for the
union.
"Even those who voted to reject the contract are
happy. We can continue to collect our paychecks while
we protest against any of the implementations on
representaton and loss of job security," Tenuto said.
Blake said he did not think the University's final offer
was an acceptable proposal, adding, "this is a situation
where workers are unhappy, but (they) weighed all the
factors and made a reasonable decision."
"The bargaining unit reacted in an intelligent manner
rather than emotionally," he said.
