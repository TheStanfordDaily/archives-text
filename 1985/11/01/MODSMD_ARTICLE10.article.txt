## Expert Urges Smoking Laws 
### ELAINE RIGGS Staff writer 
A Stanford expert in disease pre
vention has called for tougher legis
lation to deter smoking.
"There is no way cigarette
smoking could ever have been
legalized knowing what we know
now," Dr. C. Barr Taylor, the
director of behavioral science for
the Stanford Center for Research in
Disease Prevention, said in an in
terview yesterday.
Taylor, also associate professor
of psychiatry at Stanford, discussed
the preliminary results of Stanford's
Five Cities study, calling it"the
most elaborate smoking sensation
prevention program in America."
The subjects were given health
information on nutrition, exercise
and smoking prevention. Smoking
was reduced by 30 percent in the
test cities, according to Taylor.

"But we still have a long way to
go," he added.
Taylor said that new legislation
and "more intensive and in
dividualized approaches" are
needed to make the decline in
smoking nationwide.
The necessary legislative
changes include a ban on the
promotion of cigarette smoking,
higher excise taxes on cigarettes
and an end to subsidies for tobacco
growers, according to Taylor.
Taylor recommended that the
excise tax be doubled from 16 cents
per pack to 32 cents. The raise
would have a "major effect" on
deterring smokers, he said, adding
that the extra money should be
used to pay for health education.
Taylor predicted that the end to
subsidies for tobacco growers
would result in unemployment for
some workers in that industry and
recommended legislation to create
jobs for those affected.

Local policy could also deter
smoking, according to Taylor.
Community policies dealing with
smoking in offices and restaurants
would be effective, he said.
"We'll have to phase in legislation
over the next 15 years," Taylor
said.
"1 could conceive of a time whert
(we will) begin looking at outlawing
cigarette smoking altogether . . .
perhaps by the year 2001," he said.
"But we have to not discriminate
against people who smoke. It's a
highly addicting habit."
The Five Cities study, headed by
Dr. John Farquhar of Stanford, is in
its sixth and last year. The test sub
jects in the study smoke less than
before, have lower blood pressures
and gained less weight with age, ac
cording to Taylor. Statistics prove
lifestyle has a major impact on heart
disease, he said.
The project's final results will not
be available until next summer.
