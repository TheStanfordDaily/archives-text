## Kennedy To Release Kaplan Report Monday 
### DAVID RISSER Editorial staff 
University President Donald Kennedy announced
yesterday that he will release on Monday the report by
Stanford Law School Prof. John Kaplan concerning al
leged police brutality at an Old Union sit-in last month.
Kennedy, who said earlier this week that the report
would be out by today, said he will release it after
meeting with the nine student arrestees on Monday.
The students, who were arrested during an Oct. 11
protest of University investments in South African
related companies, have said they were subjected to

unnecessary force by Stanford police and Santa Clara
County sheriff's officers.
In addition, senior Robby Perkins said he was
stripped and beaten by deputies at the North County
Jail in Palo Alto.
Police have denied these charges.
In his investigation, Kaplan has interviewed police,
observers and those arrested. He has also reviewed a
police report and a videotape of the arrests.
Kennedy, who was out of town and unavailable for
comment yesterday, said Monday that the Kaplan
report "will do a good deal to clarify" the actions of
Stanford police officers but that "the evidence is less
clear" regarding the events at the jail.
