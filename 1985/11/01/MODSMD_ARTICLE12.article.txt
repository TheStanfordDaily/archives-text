						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Marcos Must Reform 
### 
When President Reagan dispatched a personal en
voy to Manila two weeks ago, one of the more
vexing problems in contemporary U.S. foreign
policy came to the fore: what to do with President
Ferdinand Marcos, whose hold over the strife-torn
Philippines appears to be slipping.
The U.S. envoy, Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.),
pressed Marcos to make major political, economic
and military reforms. The Philippine leader replied
that, "Oh, well, everything is great," according to an
Administration official who visited with Laxalt when
he returned to Washington Oct. 18.
But the events of this week tell a different story.
When 5,000 leftist demonstrators burned effigies of
Marcos and Uncle Sam near the president's palace
on Sunday, even Marcos' own security forces
stayed out of sight.
It will take more than words to quell U.S. concern
over the continuing viability of the Marcos govern

ment. To a great extent, the trouble traces to
Marcos himself. There is his encouragement of a
corrupt and heavy-handed military establishment,
typified by his recent efforts to reinstate Gen.
Fabian Ver, a suspected conspirator in the murder
of opposition leader Benigno Aquino. There is the
growing power of the New People's Army, a com
munist, anti-American insurgency that has already
laid claim to much of the countryside beyond Manila.
Against this backdrop, it is only appropriate that
the Reagan Administration on Wednesday backed an
International Monetary Fund decision to withhold a
$453 million loan to the Marcos government. For his
own part, Marcos has agreed to at least some of the
reforms Laxalt presented during his mission.
There are times when actions speak louder than
words. Telling Marcos to reform is not enough. If
Marcos does not take real steps toward democracy,
the United States should find someone who will.
