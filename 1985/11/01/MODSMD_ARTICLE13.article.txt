# Progressive People, Unite Now

"If we strike, all my savings will be gone. It's
hard, man. It's very difficult. And it's going to be
very hard on my family in Mexico, too."
"We're talking about a very large corporate
type entity that wants to squeeze every last drop
out of its workers."
Those two comments by members of the
United Stanford Workers (USW) describe the es
sence of the conflict between the University and
the union, a conflict that will continue despite the
decision not to strike. What is at stake is nothing
less than the ability to feed one's family. The
workers are struggling for the right to job secur
ity and the right to be represented by a strong
union. They realize that is a long-term struggle.
The University wants to break the union.

To understand why the union chose not to
strike, we must look at what is happening
nationwide. Ever since 1980, with the advent of
President Reagan and his conservative agenda,
the progressive gains made in the 1960s and
1970s have come under attack. Starting with the
air traffic controllers in 1981 and continuing to
the Watsonville Cannery workers today, unions
have been under attack from corporate America,
Not only has labor had to bear the brunt of
Reaganism â€” Third World people and other pro
gressive forces have been attacked as well. At
tempts to roll back the clock on affirmative ac
tion, bilingualism, immigration and students'
rights prove that progressive advances have run
into the forces of reaction.
Stanford has followed the country in the move
to the right. Make no mistake about it, Stanford
is a corporation. If you find that hard to believe,
just look at the position of the Board of Trus
tees, which has a majority of corporate execu
tives as its membership. Last year, Trustee
James Gaither said the board's primary responsi

bility is to seek the greatest'return possible on
the assets of the University. As Economics 001
teaches, the best way to maximize profits is to
minimize costs. Labor is the cost the University
wants to minimize.
Just as Continental Airlines and other corpo
rations have tried to break their unions, Stanford
engaged in unfair labor practices last year by
refusing to recognize USW as the official bargain
ing unit of the workers and trying to break the
union.
Other sectors of the community that helped
move this university in the direction of equality
and social concern are also under attack from the
administration and Board of Trustees. The im
position of the Western Culture program, the an
tagonistic attitude toward theme houses, and the
increased investment in corporations supporting
South Africa are evidence that Stanford is anti
progress.
The struggles of Third World, progressive and
working people at Stanford are the same. Basi
cally, we are all fighting for democracy and self
determination.
Like any corporation, Stanford is not a demo
cratic institution. Thirty-two unrepresentative
people make policy decisions for 15,000 stu
dents, faculty, staff and workers. Most people
haven't even seen two or three trustees, let
alone know who all 32 are. Yet these are the
people who decide to raise our tuition at a rate
that exceeds the rate of inflation.

Self-determination is the ability to control
one's own destiny and have a say in the institu
tions that influence our lives. We do not have
that say with the board. It has no student mem
bers, meets behind closed doors, and is not ac
countable to the wishes of the community.
Achieving self-determination is not an easy
thing. The struggle has been going on for a long
time. It took 80 years before Stanford admitted
more than a handful of black and other Third
World students (we're two handfuls now). Since
our admission in 1968, we black students have
been fighting to have our needs and concerns
met by the University. The Stanford community
has advocated divestment since the early 1970s
and still hasn't reached this goal. And the
workers unionized in the early 1970s and are still
struggling to survive.
USW has correctly assessed that now is not
the time to take on the University with a strike.
The fight for recognition last year depleted the
union's funds, and the University has formidable
resources in the form of a police force, media
and money. The thing to do now is regroup and
build up the ranks for the long-term struggle.
All the progressive forces on campus must
realize that we have to work together to make
this university a more democratic and just place.
It is neither an easy nor a short struggle. But it is
a struggle that will be won.
