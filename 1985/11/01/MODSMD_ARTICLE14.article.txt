## 'Indian' Mascot Belittled Native Americans 
### 
In response to Dan McGanney's
letter regarding the Indian mascot,
"Does Stanford know something
about the native American that the
rest of the country doesn't" (The
Daily, Oct. 29), the answer is yes.
Stanford has a small, but united
native American community that
voiced its objection to the Indian
mascot in 1972. The reasons for
this, that hold true today, are as fol
lows:
• The Indian mascot presented a
stereotypical, Hollywood, warlike
Indian image of a man dressed in

buckskin and feathers dancing
around and waving a hatchet. This
image was created by European in
vaders to justify their acts of
genocide and manifest destiny. The
native Americans, prior to the arri
val of the Europeans and others,
were a peaceful, cultured and religi
ous people. True, there were wars,
but in these wars one tribe was not
totally annihilated.
• Native Americans are not one
homogenous people. Native Ameri
can tribes are as different from one
another as the English, French and
Italian people are, with vastly dif

ferent languages, customs, songs,
dances, dress, food, etc. Lumping
all the tribes together and
representing them by the Plains In
dian image would be like represent
ing all Europeans by the smooth
talking French.
• Native Americans are people and
not mascots. If the Indian is accep-

table as a mascot, then why not the
black, Chicano or Iranian, for that
matter?
• It is argued that to have the In
dian mascot at the prestigious Stan
ford University would "help" the
native Americans. Despite being
the "Stanford Indians" for many

years, the University failed to have
a native American studies program
(that exists at UC-Berkeley, UCLA
and Dartmouth). The native Ameri
can student population has
remained small, while the other
ethnic-minority populations have
soared, comparatively speaking. As
for the argument that other teams

have Indian mascots, they simply
have not seen the light. How has
Washington honored the Indian? It
has honored the Indian by reducing
vital social-service funding and by
breaking every treaty it ever made
with the Indians.
• If Stanford was the Indians, the

media would have a field day with
the nickname. For example,
"Indians Scalp Trojans." This would
hardly honor the Indian. I don't
think a water polo player would
want to hatchet anyone.
The Indian mascot was abolished
because the University, under
President Richard Lyman, did not
want to continue to perpetuate the
stereotyping and misrepresentation
of the "noble red man" or "vicious
savage" myth that was created
when Europeans set foot on
this continent. Stanford should be
commended for this wise decision
and remain a leader instead of a
blind follower.
