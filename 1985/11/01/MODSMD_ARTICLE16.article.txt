Where Was the
Daily Puzzle?
For the second day in a row, I
was dismayed yesterday to find
that The Daily had omitted the
crossword puzzle. Of course, I
realize The Daily is filled with vital,
newsworthy events and there is
hot always room for the puzzle.
For example, there was that titil
lating article on water — some
thing we'd all like to know more
about. And of course, we all
enjoyed that exciting picture of
geese on page 3.
The crossword puzzle is an
essential part of The Daily. A Daily
without a puzzle is like an Obser
ver without old news. Further
more, we who are cult followers of
Eugene have never en
dorsed nonviolent means, and we
won't stand idly by now.

The article in yesterday's Daily
on the anti-Strategic Defense Ini
tiative (SDI) petition being circ
ulated on many campuses ne
glected to mention that there is a
Stanford student organization
actively working on it: Stanford
Action for Nuclear Disarmament
(STAND). We encourage people to
make a difference and help us in
this effort.
Our position is that a "Star
Wars" system would undermine
deterrence. No one seriously sug
gests that SDI will be able to
defend populations — it will be
only a partial shield, even if all the
incredible technical difficulties
involved are resolved. Given the
choice between launching a first
strike that can penetrate the shield

and a retaliatory strike that can't,
the Soviets, in a crisis, will be
tempted to strike first. Con
versely, the United States will be
tempted to strike first to prevent
them. Thus, the situation is desta
bilized by SDI deployment.
We urge faculty and graduate
students not to accept SDI funds.
Acceptance of funds legitimizes the
expansion of this dangerous pro
gram to Congress and the public.
Rejection is a statement of social
responsibility.

I have held a staff position at
Stanford for the past 22 years, was
in University President Donald
Tresidder's office briefly some
years before that, and have three
sons who graduated from Stanford
— so it has always been a special
place to me.
But the character of the Univer
sity seems to have changed over
those years, as all of us who have
been here agree. It has become
big business. It no longer
represents the idealistic, free
thinking academic institution it
should be. And while no employer
welcomes unionization of its
employees, both students and staff
have shown that the "paternal"
approach is not welcomed by
them.
We staff members have all
enjoyed the benefits from the hard
won union contracts. We feel, too,
that the stature of the University is
diminished by its hardline approach
and what appears to be dishonesty
in some of its claims.
