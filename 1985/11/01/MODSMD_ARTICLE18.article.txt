Question Writer's
Personal Bias
I wish to respond to a recent
editorial in The Daily entitled
"Racism and Brutality" (Oct. 15).
Although I support the fight for
freedom in South Africa and find
acts of racism and/or brutality
inexcusable, we must guard
against being sucked into fighting
for a cause on the basis of one
sided or skewed information.
The author of the editorial spoke
of Perkins (the black Stanford
student arrested on Oct. 11) and
his claim of being brutalized by
local police for racial reasons. The
author indicated that such treat
ment was not unique to Perkins,
but was common among blacks.
This statement was followed by a
list of statistics stating the number
of persons killed by police between
1970 and 1980, and the percentage
of those who were black.
This presentation indicates that
such data are statistical evidence of
widespread, racist police brutality.
Such presentation takes the data
out of its original context and omits
certain relevant facts that may
bring the reader to a different
conclusion if considered.
For instance, a question that
would be raised by a critical reader
might be, "Does the high
percentage of blacks shot by police
indicate racist policies employed by
police, or is there some other
reason for the high proportion?"
The research of sociologists has
long shown that the majority of
offenders in our country who are
arrested and convicted of crimes
are black males. In light of this
fact, it would seem rather predict
able that many pursued and shot at
the scene of crimes would be
black. Why this is true is a topic of
much research, but it doesn't nec
essarily indicate racist practices of
our police force. For this reason, I
feel it is wise for all persons to try
and refrain from forming an opinion
without trying to objectively exam
ine such information.
I don't mean to suggest that
critical examination of a situation or
data should be used as a means for
rationalizing inaction. However, I
do suggest that as we gather j
"facts" about such emotionally
charged issues, care must be taken
to consider both sides of the story.

Always question an author's
perspective on events. What stake
or interest does he/she have in the
issue? Are there any events that
could explain actions that aren't
immediately apparent? I often find
it helpful to ask, "Could I have
done better in the situation with
the same circumstances and back
ground?" This type of thought
process really requires some effort
but ideally will result in more effec
tive action and the formation of
coalitions based on real commit
ment to the cause.
In conclusion, I suggest that we
question all actions (not just those
of the "establishment"), try to
view any incident from the per
spective of both parties involved
and come to an informed conclu
sion on the basis of objective ex
amination. The present cleavage
between the students and the
administration needs to be
narrowed before we can hope for
the actions of both, working
jointly, to make an impact on the
South African situation. As I see it,
this can best be done by consider
ing "their" perspective and at
tempting to devise cooperative,
yet workable solutions to the pres
ent dilemma that will meet the
needs of the University and
Stanford students. The stands and
actions we take based on this type
of examination are more likely to
produce results that will change
the atrocious situation in South
Africa.

Speech to Frosh
Now Hypocritical
I feel compelled to write regard
ing University President Donald
Kennedy's comments to the fresh
man class and the actions of his
administration which show the
hypocrisy of his statements.
Recently, Mr. Kennedy spoke to
the freshman class. He told them
to question authority. This is a
very noble thought, Mr. Kennedy.
If you really believe this, I must
ask:
• Why do members of the Stanford
community get arrested and physi
cally abused by the police?
• Why are students now threat
ened with campus judicial charges

should they participate in sit-ins in
the future? Past participation may
also be considered in penalties.
This comes from James Lyons,
your dean of Student Affairs.
• Why does the University's
negotiating team refuse to discuss
the important issues of the con
tract with USW, particularly para
graph 94?
• The Coffee House is very impor
tant to the students of Stanford.
Why was the decision to turn it
over to Saga made before the vast
majority of students and faculty
were back from summer break?
• Why did the administration hold
untimely meetings concerning the
Reagan Library? Surely Mr. Ken
nedy, you were not afraid someone
may actually have some legitimate
questions that may have been
contrary to administration opinion.
In light of these actions, your
statements to the freshman class
are nothing but a sham. These
actions show that those in charge
of this university are arrogant and
only concerned with special inter
ests. Stop acting so pious and
almighty, Mr. Kennedy. Get off
your ivory tower and come see
what the real world is like. I send
this letter in the spirit of the First
Amendment, and in that of the
ideal which Mr. Kennedy holds so
dear, questioning authority. I
wonder how effective this is when
these questions fall on deaf ears,
Mr. Kennedy. How about it fresh
men?

Kennedy Callous
Toward Workers
I have worked here at Stanford
for eight years. In many ways, I
have found it a good place to be
employed. However, since the
advent of the Kennedy administra
tion, I have become increasingly
disturbed by what some are calling
the "corporatization" of the Uni
versity. I would like to discuss the
effects this has upon me as an
employee.
In what I want to perceive as
University President Donald Ken
nedy's desire to create a good
educational and research institu
tion, he has lost sight of the
humanity of those who work for
him. Instead of people, he seems

to see numbers: wages, benefits
and cost projections. And, as num
bers, we become easy to manipu
late.
He can cut his costs by offering
low wages, incomplete benefits
and inadequate pensions. He can
avoid seeing the human results,
such as those people who have to
pay a very substantial percentage
of their incomes to provide medical
benefits for their children, or Clyde
Cookson who, after working here
for 23 years, is retiring on a pen
sion of less than $225 a month, or
the "temporary" workers who are
employed here for months and
years for substandard wages and
no benefits.
In many ways, we are a David to
Kennedy's Goliath. We certainly
don't have the many millions of
dollars that are at his disposal. In
fact, by his clever stratagem of
delaying until the contract expired,
he has been able to stop deducting
union dues from our paychecks,
making it a very time-consuming
chore to maintain any operating
capital at all.
Sitting across the bargaining
table from Kennedy's highly paid,
high-powered legal representatives
are a deliverer, a plumber, a food
service worker, a laborer, a SLAC
technician and a bookbinder.
Kennedy's goal is clearly the
destruction of our union, thereby
denying us any power to determine
how we are treated here. He
wants to take away our legal right
to meet with union representatives
in the work place. He wants to be
able to lay-off union workers and
replace them with non-union
people to whom the University will
not have to give the pay, rights or
benefits specified in the contract.
He wants to get away with paying
union members a smaller
percentage wage increase than
other workers here.
I have always felt that it is im
portant to do my job as well as I
possibly can. But I also believe
that this devotion should be
matched by a concern on the part of
my employer about my welfare as
a human being. Instead, all I see is
Kennedy's devotion to the dollar
and cents "bottom line." Stanford
may be winning the numbers bat
tle, but what is happening to its
humanity?
