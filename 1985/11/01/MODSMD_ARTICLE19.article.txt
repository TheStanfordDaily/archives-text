## On the Format of the New S. Africa Pamphlet: 
### 
This week, the administration
announced its plans to publish a
second booklet on South Africa. We
members of Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA) can only greet this
announcement with skepticism and
a few weary yawns.
It is amazing that the University
still defends its first booklet,
"Stanford and South Africa," even
while announcing its intention to
publish a supplementary booklet.
Let no one be fooled: The only rea
son Stanford is releasing a second
pamphlet on the South Africa issue
is that its first effort was such a
mistake.

VIEWPOINT

The many inaccuracies, distor
tions and omissions in the first
booklet have been widely criticized.
There is no need to dwell on them
here. It is worthy to note,
however, that in her Oct. 21 letter
to The Daily, Diana Diamond, au
thor of much of "Stanford and South
Africa," attempts to explain why so
many errors crept into the booklet.
Basically, writes Diamond, she
and her staff were given an almost
impossible task, as they had only 10
days to assemble the booklet. No
one can fault Diamond here; she
was given an almost impossible
task. And yet, how revealing it is
that the administration demanded
that the booklet be put together in
such a ludicrously short period of
time. If there had been any depth to
its supposed commitment to ex
ploring the South Africa issue, the
administration would have given
more time to produce a better
researched, more credible publica
tion.
And now comes the news of an
other booklet, a sequel to "Stanford
and South Africa." This new
pamphlet promises to be unusual in
its format, to say the least. Dia
mond is asking for individuals to
submit short essays on the South
Africa issue, and presumably these
essays will appear just as their
respective authors intended.
But Diamond said that some con
tributions will be followed by
editor's notes. What form these
notes will take is not clear. Dia

mond is rather vague in her letter. !
Wiil these notes simply point out .
any factual errors that appear in in- ;
dividual essays or will they com- ;
ment directly on the views set forth
in the essays? This brings up the •
central problem with the new book- I
let: It will still be published by the '
administration. Through "editor's
notes," the University will still have •
the final say. Unlike a real debate, I
only one side will be allowed time '
for a rebuttal.
SOSA does plan to make a contri- •
bution to this booklet, but it wants •
students to realize that it will not
represent all SOSA has to say about !

whether its statement will be ac- k
cepted at all or whether it will be ►
printed in its entirety. SOSA plans «

Kennedy is fond of saying that he

feels the same way. It is SOSA's
belief that students can make intelli
gent decisions for themselves, and \
that they should be allowed to hear -
both sides of the issue. While »•
