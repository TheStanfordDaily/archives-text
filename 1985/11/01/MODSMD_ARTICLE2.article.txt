# Mail Registration To Begin Next Quarter
## 
### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
A new register-by-mail procedure, called a
"dramatic change" by University Bursar Jon
Erickson, will begin with winter quarter registra
tion, PTRs and the traditional crush
at Maples Pavilion.
Early next week, students will be mailed a
registration commitment, the new official
registration document, which must be completed
and returned to the registrar on or before Nov.
22, according to Asst. Registrar Robert
Thompson. Students can register for winter
quarter, spring quarter or both with this one
document.
All students who register after the Nov. 22

deadline but before Jan. 3 must pay a late fee of
$30; after Jan. 3, that fee is $40; and after Jan. 7,
$50. Students cannot register after Jan. 27.
After a student's registration has been pro
cessed, the Office of the Registrar will mail the
student a study list and an ID card. Undeclared
undergraduates will receive only the ID card and
must pick up study lists from their advisers.
The University will not process a registration
commitment for a student with a hold on
registration until the student takes the neces
sary steps to remove that hold.
The new procedure also separates registra
tion and payment of tuition and fees into two dis
tinct steps. <
A student who registers for winter quarter
will be mailed a University bill in late November,
according to Erickson. Students who register for

spring quarter will receive their bills in March.
The bill will include tuition, applicable room
and board charges and the ASSU fee assessment.
University grants, outside scholarships and
other forms of financial aid will automatically be
credited to the bill, Erickson said. Loans,
however, will not be credited.
The University bill for winter quarter must be
paid in full On or before Jan. 6, Erickson said,
adding that students who are unable to do so
may take out a deferment loan. The loan, includ
ing interest and a $20 fee, must be repaid by
Feb. 20.
There will be no registration day on Jan. 6,
but the second floor Oak Lounge in Tresidder
Union will be set up as a cashier facility that day
so that students may pay their bills,
according to Erickson.
The only major procedure associ
ated with registration that has not
been changed for winter quarter is
course reservation, according to
Cecilia Corey, registration and in
formation officer.
Students registered for winter
quarter may sign class lists in Old
Union from Nov. 26 to Dec. 5.
"My personal goal is to use the
computerized course reservation
system beginning next autumn at
the latest," Corey said.
The elimination of a registration
day means the elimination of
Maples as a gathering place for stu
dents since student groups will no
longer be able to advertise their ac
tivities in front of the pavilion.
