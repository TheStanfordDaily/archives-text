## A 						MemChip off the Old Block

When the late night munchies
hit, there's a cheaper alternative
to the traditional pizza or ice
cream order.
Senior J. P. Sabarots, co-owner
of the student-run company called
Mem Chips explained, "Our inten
tion is to provide an alternative for
the students. We like to satisfy
their munchies for cheap."
Senior Kira Hellinghausen
echoed her partner's sentiments.
"We're cheaper than any cookie
store that doesn't deliver, and we
use the best ingredients," said the
industrial engineering major.
Mem Chips' most popular cookie
is the classic chocolate chip. It
also bakes oatmeal raisin and but
terscotch chip.
Currently, the owners are also
considering some additional
flavors. "We're thinking of a white
chocolate cookie or maybe an all
chocolate cookie," Sabarots said.
"Someone mentioned M&M's
to me," Hellinghausen said.
Mem Chips was founded in the
fall of 1983 by Sharon Graves and
Cathy Romero.
Sabarots, an economics major,
started delivering for Mem Chips
last year. "Sharon was in my
dorm, and she was looking for
help in her business," he said of
his first contact with the cookie
endeavor.
When Hellinghausen found out
that Graves and Romero wouldn't
operate Mem Chips this fall, she
asked Sabarots if he'd like to team
up. "The two of us just got to
gether and decided to do it," she
said.
Last year, most of Mem Chips'
sales were in Wilbur Hall, but
Hellinghausen and Sabarots have

concentrated on expanding their
market.
"We deliver all over campus,
from Mirrielees to Governor's
Corner, mostly on bikes," said
Sabarots. "We used to have a
moped, but it got stolen."
Providing Mem Chips to the
whole campus has been a learning
experience. "We've learned the
value of advertising," Sabarots
said. "We've learned to allot out

time. Organization is the key, or
we'd be a big mess."
Baking headquarters are at the
Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity
house.
"We have about 15 deliverers,"
Sabarots said. "Then we have
three additional managers who
bake cookies." Deliverers eafn $4
an hour, and managers earn
$4.25.
Hellinghausen estimated that

Mem Chips sells 300 cookies on a
typical night. "Sundays are the
busiest," she said.
"On Sundays, we usually catch
people before the Flicks, or when
they come back from the Flicks,"
Sabarots added.
Mem Chips often supplies study
breaks, held on Wednesday nights
by most houses. A typical study

break order is $20 for 5 dozen
cookies.
Mem Chips' customers may
notice that the cookies have a dis
tinctive flavor. "There is a secret
ingredient," Hellinghausen said.
The cookie recipes are a little bit
different this year. "We've changed
them," she added.
Hellinghausen and Sabarots both
hope to put their Mem Chips experi
ence to use some day in owning
their own business. "Maybe some
time in the future," said Helling
hausen.
If there is a drawback to working
for Mem Chips, it might be the risk
of losing a liking for cookies'. "I hate
them," Hellinghausen laughed.
"I don't like them too much
either," Sabarots said. "I've tasted
a lot of batter and a lot of cookies.
But I like our cookies, if I have to
eat cookies."
The minimum Mem Chips order is
$1.25 for three cookies. Its hours
are 8:30 p.m. to 11 p.m., Sunday
through Thursday, and you can call
321-5665 to place your order.
