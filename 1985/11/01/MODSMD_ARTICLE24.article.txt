# Take a Gander
## Governor's Corner is fowl ground 
### SCOTT ROTH Staff writer 
Two fowl creatures moved into
Governor's Corner this spring.
They took up residence there and
have not left. They are neither ob
noxious freshmen nor pressurized
pre-meds.
They are geese.
The large brown birds came to
roost on the lawn outside Ster
ling Quad during spring quarter.
They stayed there all summer.
The geese seem to have decided
not to migrate south for the winter,
favoring the comfortable environs
of the University.
For something as irregular at
Stanford as geese, they seem to
draw little attention. They still lack
names, and no one admits to
feeding the birds.
"Judging from the size of them,
I'd say that they're doing just fine
on their own. They probably eat
whatever geese eat, but I've seen
the cooks in the eating clubs and at
Sterling Quad dining room throwing
a few scraps to them," said Tom
Lazaroff, a former resident assis
tant at Governor's Corner who
greeted the birds when they
arrived.
Most residents admitted they like
the birds, saying the feathered
presence adds to the park-like at
mosphere at the dorm.
But the fowl are sometimes true
to their names.
"Sometimes, late at night, they'll
start squawking and honking really
loudly," Lazaroff said. "It doesn't
wake you up, but it's annoying."
The geese also disrupt sporting
events in and around Governor's
Corner. Many people complained
about the birds' habit of relieving
themselves on the lawn and basket
ball courts.
"That bird shit is really a hazard

when you're playing touch football.
Sometimes you have to adjust your
patterns," a winded wide receiver
shouted.
The geese declined to comment
when asked whether these rude,
athletic comings and goings dis
rupt their strolling pleasure. A
highly political response, consider
ing how similar a goose is to a
pigskin.

Besides goosing the occasional,
passing pass-receiver, the
feathered friends of Campus West
seemed to have rather empty
agendas.
They tend to dismiss most resi
dents from their limited intellectual
horizons after a casual peck at the
shin.
They'd better keep a close watch
over their wings, though. The
Great Pumpkin isn't the only large
creature running lose out there. ?
"I say kill them," growled one
resident predatorily. "I'm tired of
them."
