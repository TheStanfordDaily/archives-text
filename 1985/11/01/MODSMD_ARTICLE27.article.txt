## Arnie Shows His Muscles In Ludicrous 'Commando' 
### PETER HAVEN Editorial staff 
Somehow, someway, some
body's going to pay. That's what
the advertisements for
"Commando," Arnold Schwar
zenegger's new film fiasco, say.
Anyone who sees this movie will
pay, and pay dearly.
"Commando" raises bloodshed
and carnage to a new and
ridiculous level. Mr. Beefcakes,
who is quickly establishing him
self as one of the greatest charac
ter actors of all time, is once again
imposing and impressive in this
film.
Arnie has given us a whole ar
ray of cinema masterpieces. His
first film, "Hercules Goes
Bananas" (no kidding), later
renamed "Hercules Goes to New
York," launched him on a stellar
career that seems destined to,
ugh, succeed. You remember him
in "Conan" I and 11, right? He
played a great big buffoon
dressed up in buffalo hide. And
"Terminator?" This was a very
impressive movie due, in no small
part, to the'fact that Arnie seldom
spoke.
Well forget him in all those
roles, because in "Commando,"
Arnie really outdoes himself.
After seeing him portray John
Matrix (stupid name) in
"Commando," you get a feeling
for why Arnie is known as Mr.
Universe. Anyone who can smell
his enemies upwind like a blood
hound, cut down a whole army
with more ease than a grain har
vestor, and leap from airplanes at
several hundred miles per hour
— all while retaining the appari

tion of a loving-daddy, Ward
Cleaver type — has got to be
more than mortal.
Arnie does his best imitation of
a La Machine in "Commando." He
dices, slices, chops, purees, li
quifies and kneads more villains
than anything Osterizer could
possibly invent. After this film, he
is easily ready to double as the

posterboy for the food processor
industry. He's that good.
Before we get carried away,
let's take care of the plot of this
masterpiece. It won't take long to
summarize, because it obviously
didn't take long for scriptwriter
Steven de Souza to write. Arnie


In "Commando," Arnold Schwarzenegger reinforces his vi
olent, macho image, this time as Col. John Matrix.
