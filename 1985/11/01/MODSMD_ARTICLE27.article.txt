## Arnie Shows His Muscles In Ludicrous 'Commando' 
### PETER HAVEN Editorial staff 
Somehow, someway, some
body's going to pay. That's what
the advertisements for
"Commando," Arnold Schwar
zenegger's new film fiasco, say.
Anyone who sees this movie will
pay, and pay dearly.
"Commando" raises bloodshed
and carnage to a new and
ridiculous level. Mr. Beefcakes,
who is quickly establishing him
self as one of the greatest charac
ter actors of all time, is once again
imposing and impressive in this
film.
Arnie has given us a whole ar
ray of cinema masterpieces. His
first film, "Hercules Goes
Bananas" (no kidding), later
renamed "Hercules Goes to New
York," launched him on a stellar
career that seems destined to,
ugh, succeed. You remember him
in "Conan" I and 11, right? He
played a great big buffoon
dressed up in buffalo hide. And
"Terminator?" This was a very
impressive movie due, in no small
part, to the'fact that Arnie seldom
spoke.
Well forget him in all those
roles, because in "Commando,"
Arnie really outdoes himself.
After seeing him portray John
Matrix (stupid name) in
"Commando," you get a feeling
for why Arnie is known as Mr.
Universe. Anyone who can smell
his enemies upwind like a blood
hound, cut down a whole army
with more ease than a grain har
vestor, and leap from airplanes at
several hundred miles per hour
— all while retaining the appari

tion of a loving-daddy, Ward
Cleaver type — has got to be
more than mortal.
Arnie does his best imitation of
a La Machine in "Commando." He
dices, slices, chops, purees, li
quifies and kneads more villains
than anything Osterizer could
possibly invent. After this film, he
is easily ready to double as the

posterboy for the food processor
industry. He's that good.
Before we get carried away,
let's take care of the plot of this
masterpiece. It won't take long to
summarize, because it obviously
didn't take long for scriptwriter
Steven de Souza to write. Arnie


In "Commando," Arnold Schwarzenegger reinforces his vi
olent, macho image, this time as Col. John Matrix.
plays — you guessed it — an ex
commando. Back in the good old
days, Arnie and his merry horde
traipsed around the globe
butchering, dethroning and
destroying anything they could
get their hands on.
But now, after creating
enemies around the world, Arnie
wants to enjoy life in the wilder
ness with his cutesy-pie 11-year
old daughter (Alyssa Milano).
The scenes of Matrix lounging
around feeding baby deer are a
real riot. The rest of the movie is
just as funny, though it's not al
ways trying to be. Some South
American scuzzballs — led by a
power-hungry dictator (Dan
Hedaya), whose government was
rather unceremoniously over
thrown by Arnie and his boys,
come along and spoil all the fun.
They kidnap the kid and tell Arnie
to kill the president he put in
power back in the banana republic
country of Val Verde (what a
name). Arnie and the
scriptwriters will have nothing to
do with that, thank you. And the
rest of the movie is spent
showing how tough our hero
guerilla is as he whacks his way
through a sea of villains to get
back to his precious offspring.
"Commando" wastes no time in
satisfying the public's apparently
unquenchable desire for misery
and maimed bodies. At my
showing, legions of Arnie fans
cheered wildly with every
graphic, slow-motion death dis
play.
The opening scene depicts a
couple of thugs (masquerading as
garbage men) who come to help
out their suburban client. With a
blaze of machine guns, they install
a ventilation system in the poor
guy's chest — just as he is run

ning down his driveway with Glad
bags in hand. The whole scene
resembles something like a bad
take in one of Tom Bosley's trash
bag commercials. Nevertheless,
the point is made.
Hollywood has introduced a
new statistic of late — body
count. The "Conan" films num
bered a paltry 50 or so casualties.
"Rambo" could only up them
slightly, hitting the 70 plateau.
But "Commando" — now there's
a movie. More than a 100 people
perish on the screen.
The dialogue is even more
cliche-riddled than the script. In
one scene, Arnie does battle with
a gruesome ex-military toughy
like himself. Like a couple of
gamecocks squaring off, they
each try to scare each other with
their plumage.
"Are you scared motherf ,
cause this big green beret is
gonna kick your a--," our villain
proclaims boldly. This is some
what silly considering Arnie ap
pears to have 30 pounds on the
guy and is still hot under the collar
from knocking off the entire
LAPD.
"I eeet grreeeen berazze fur
brekfeeest," Arnie calmly replies
in his best Austrian he-man ac
cent. He then impales the poor
thug on the leg of an upside down
coffee table.
Rae Dawn Chong, who plays
Arnie's reluctant sidekick, Cindy,
is one of the bright spots in this
movie. Chong, the daughter of
Tommy Chong (as in Cheech and
Chong) lends her exotic good
looks and spicy humor to the film.
In the above scene, director Mark
Lester and producer Joel Silver
deftly use her to laugh at the film.
In a scene riddled with silly
dialogue, Arnie dangles the devil
ish Sully — played superbly by

David Patrick Kelly of "48 Hours"
and "Dreamscape" fame — over
the edge of a cliff, upside down
and by one ankle. After dealing
with Sully appropriately, Arnie
returns to Cindy. She naturally
asks what he did with Sully.
"I let heeeeem go," Arnie
replies.
The makers of "Commando"
seem proud of their efforts, to
achieve realism in the film. The
list of props features a Valmet
full-auto Battle Rifle, a selective
fire Uzi (Arnie likes Uzis; he used
one in "Terminator," too), a Des
ert Eagle .357 Magnum auto, a
12-gauge Remington H7O Laser
shotgun, two 60-pound M-60 light
machine guns, and a Colt M-16,
among others.
Enough is enough. I like a good
adventure film as much as
anyone, and I don't think every
film should carry the intellectual
weight of an "Amadeus" before it
can be called good. "Terminator"
was an exciting film. The
"Raiders" movies should be
preserved forever as action
adventure masterpieces. All had
more than their share of violence.
But there is something wrong,
even a bit disturbing, in seeing
violence for sheer violence's
sake. In a sentence, that's how
one could describe "Commando."
The movie tries to be light
hearted, but there is nothing
amusing in watching Arnie gaff
some villain like a fish while his
daughter smiles approvingly.
The audience really got a kick
out of it, however, and the film is
doing well at the box office. After
my showing, someone exclaimed,
"I feel great. Now I need to go
out and kill someone."
Somehow, somewhere, some
one is going to pay — dearly —
for this film.
