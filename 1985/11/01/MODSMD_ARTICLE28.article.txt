# Wood's 'Remo' Thriller: Nasty, Brutish and Bad
## 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
"Remo: The Adventure Begins" starts out with
Remo (played by Fred Ward) in his original identity as a
New York City cop, beating up heavies and getting
dumped into the East River in his car. He's rescued by
spies from a secret governmental agency called
CURE, given a new identity, and turned into a super
man by an ancient Korean martial arts master named
Chuin. That's what we get for character development;
we're never told why CURE would want this particular
crude, brash, not-too-bright street cop to turn into a
living weapon. But plot doesn't figure too largely in this
adventure thriller, which would be totally undistin
guished if it didn't have Fred Ward and Joel Grey and
their characters' unusual relationship.
Director Guy Hamilton and screenwriter Christop
her Wood are both James Bond alumni, but they've left
any storytelling skills they might have with that se
ries. "Remo" plugs along, finding silly excuses to put
Remo on the Statue of Liberty and the Coney Island
Wonder Wheel and creating a real bummer of a bad
guy in an unscrupulous munitions magnate (Charles
Cioffi). The movie has no dramatic focus in its title
character; he's a crumbum cop who thinks with his
fists and, after he develops his skills, the first thing he
uses them for is to assault a man on the street who of
fends him. The attempt to "humanize" Remo (if that's
what it is) misfired for me. I kept thinking that, like
Rambo, this guy should be locked up.
Hamilton and Wood are apparently trying for a char
acter somewhere between James Bond and Dirty
Harry, and that's probably what's meant by the ad line
"A Hero for the '80s." But Remo doesn't have the
style of Bond, and the movie isn't hyperbolic enough to
grab us; it doesn't have the cartoon pulpishness of the
books. And unlike Clint Eastwood's cops, Remo isn't
self-righteous about his work, or even dedicated to it,
so we don't know why he risks his neck. The cartoon
heroes that work have a simple driving force that
propels us along with them; Remo looks like he'd
rather be at home watching football than out saving the
world. Yet this still might work if the menace he faced
were larger-than-life —a palpable threat. But an evil
munitions dealer bilking the government makes a
pretty seedy villain and isn't much of a target for an all
action superhero.

What works better in this movie is the pupil/mentor
relationship Remo has with Chuin, played by Joel Grey.
When they first meet, Remo tries to kill him, but
Chuin, bobbing and weaving, dodges his bullets. Chuin
seems to have hinges all over his body that work
lightning fast and always leave his head slightly askew,
as if it were slower than the rest of him. Joel Grey
gives a very athletic performance; only his face
remains inexpressive. (Possibly he couldn't move it un
der his layers of makeup.) And Wood gives him all the
best lines, which primarily consist of insults directed at
Remo's stupidity and Western decadence.
Chuin is conceived as a human Yoda, but in this
comic book atmosphere it's not particularly demeaning
or racist because he is the most human thing on the
screen. The success is due mostly to Grey, who gives
Chuin an abrasive personality that keeps the character
from becoming too wise and paternal. It's clear that
Hamilton and Wood relish the little spins they put on
Chuin's character, like having him enjoy soap operas,
but his domestic squabbles with Remo (they live to
gether as they train) are pretty limp, TV-sitcom af
fairs. The actors deserve something better.
Ward has less to work with. Remo is not much more
than a big, burly lug, and Ward tries to make him more
likeable than the screenplay really allows. His Remo is
a perfect example of what would happen if Rambo or
Dirty Harry were conceived in terms of real human
beings; they would become slightly retarded macho
clowns. He starts out a dirty street fighter, and as he
learns new powers from Chuin, he becomes more laid
back, but not noticeably wiser or more reasonable; the
spiritual aspects of the martial arts bounce right off of
this guy. Ward showed he can act in "The Right Stuff,"
and here he seems to be groping for something in
Remo he can latch onto or bring to life. But the story
throws him into one action sequence after another,
each more poorly staged that the last, so we don't even
see much development in Remo's physical skill.
"Remo" is a pretty inept piece of work. Except for a
couple of nasty, thumping fist-fights, the film is staged
like a TV-movie, and from the open-ended title, it's
clear the moviemakers' eyes are set on the sequel
market. If the filmmakers hadn't been so conscious of
this, might they have gone further with the
Remo/Chuin relationship and done more with Remo's
character in this movie? The situation has possibilities,
but they aren't worth waiting 10 years and five more
"Remos" for.

heroes that work have a simple driving force that
propels us along with them; Remo looks like he'd
rather be at home watching football than out saving the
world. Yet this still might work if the menace he faced
were larger-than-life —a palpable threat. But an evil
munitions dealer bilking the government makes a
pretty seedy villain and isn't much of a target for an all
action superhero.

What works better in this movie is the pupil/mentor
relationship Remo has with Chuin, played by Joel Grey.
When they first meet, Remo tries to kill him, but
Chuin, bobbing and weaving, dodges his bullets. Chuin
seems to have hinges all over his body that work
lightning fast and always leave his head slightly askew,
as if it were slower than the rest of him. Joel Grey
gives a very athletic performance; only his face
remains inexpressive. (Possibly he couldn't move it un
der his layers of makeup.) And Wood gives him all the
best lines, which primarily consist of insults directed at
Remo's stupidity and Western decadence.
Chuin is conceived as a human Yoda, but in this
comic book atmosphere it's not particularly demeaning
or racist because he is the most human thing on the
screen. The success is due mostly to Grey, who gives
Chuin an abrasive personality that keeps the character
from becoming too wise and paternal. It's clear that
Hamilton and Wood relish the little spins they put on
Chuin's character, like having him enjoy soap operas,
but his domestic squabbles with Remo (they live to
gether as they train) are pretty limp, TV-sitcom af
fairs. The actors deserve something better.
Ward has less to work with. Remo is not much more
than a big, burly lug, and Ward tries to make him more
likeable than the screenplay really allows. His Remo is
a perfect example of what would happen if Rambo or
Dirty Harry were conceived in terms of real human
beings; they would become slightly retarded macho
clowns. He starts out a dirty street fighter, and as he
learns new powers from Chuin, he becomes more laid
back, but not noticeably wiser or more reasonable; the
spiritual aspects of the martial arts bounce right off of
this guy. Ward showed he can act in "The Right Stuff,"
and here he seems to be groping for something in
Remo he can latch onto or bring to life. But the story
throws him into one action sequence after another,
each more poorly staged that the last, so we don't even
see much development in Remo's physical skill.
"Remo" is a pretty inept piece of work. Except for a
couple of nasty, thumping fist-fights, the film is staged
like a TV-movie, and from the open-ended title, it's
clear the moviemakers' eyes are set on the sequel
market. If the filmmakers hadn't been so conscious of
this, might they have gone further with the
Remo/Chuin relationship and done more with Remo's
character in this movie? The situation has possibilities,
but they aren't worth waiting 10 years and five more
"Remos" for.
"Remo: The Adventure Begins" starts out with
Remo (played by Fred Ward) in his original identity as a
New York City cop, beating up heavies and getting
dumped into the East River in his car. He's rescued by
spies from a secret governmental agency called
CURE, given a new identity, and turned into a super
man by an ancient Korean martial arts master named
Chuin. That's what we get for character development;
we're never told why CURE would want this particular
crude, brash, not-too-bright street cop to turn into a
living weapon. But plot doesn't figure too largely in this
adventure thriller, which would be totally undistin
guished if it didn't have Fred Ward and Joel Grey and
their characters' unusual relationship.
Director Guy Hamilton and screenwriter Christop
her Wood are both James Bond alumni, but they've left
any storytelling skills they might have with that se
ries. "Remo" plugs along, finding silly excuses to put
Remo on the Statue of Liberty and the Coney Island
Wonder Wheel and creating a real bummer of a bad
guy in an unscrupulous munitions magnate (Charles
Cioffi). The movie has no dramatic focus in its title
character; he's a crumbum cop who thinks with his
fists and, after he develops his skills, the first thing he
uses them for is to assault a man on the street who of
fends him. The attempt to "humanize" Remo (if that's
what it is) misfired for me. I kept thinking that, like
Rambo, this guy should be locked up.
Hamilton and Wood are apparently trying for a char
acter somewhere between James Bond and Dirty
Harry, and that's probably what's meant by the ad line
"A Hero for the '80s." But Remo doesn't have the
style of Bond, and the movie isn't hyperbolic enough to
grab us; it doesn't have the cartoon pulpishness of the
books. And unlike Clint Eastwood's cops, Remo isn't
self-righteous about his work, or even dedicated to it,
so we don't know why he risks his neck. The cartoon
heroes that work have a simple driving force that
propels us along with them; Remo looks like he'd
