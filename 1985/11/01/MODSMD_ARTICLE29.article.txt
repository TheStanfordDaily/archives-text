# 'Silver Bullet' is Second-Rate Horror
## 
### GREG WATKINS Staff writer 
At least "Silver Bullet" gives you
fair warning: It reveals its essence
within the first five minutes. To
begin we witness a graphic depic
tion of a gruesome decapitation; a
head flies across the screen in slow
motion. The camera comes to rest
on the severed head and body.
Then the equally sickening voice
over: a woman telling us about her
childhood in the humble town, the
hamlet of Tarker's Mills, and about
her younger brother, Marty, who,
though lovable, has become a bur
den for her because he is a cripple.
But this is not the lead-in for the
likes of Sweet Baby Jane â€” it is
more like something from an "After
School Special." And so there you
have it, the height of modern horror
film technique combined with
senseless, puerile drama.
The selling plot of "Silver Bullet"
is simple enough. It is a werewolf
movie. A small town in the Midwest
is terrorized by what everyone
believes to be a psychotic killer.
But one young boy has determined
that the culprit is really a werewolf.

As the town rises in arms, dis
gruntled with the inadequacy of its
sheriff and his deputy, the boy
pursues his own plan of attack. Fair
enough, even horror films need
dramatic context.
But for some unknown reason,

And so you have it. The height of
modern horror technique combined with
senseless, puerile drama.

Stephen King, who wrote both
novel and screenplay, chooses to
contextualize the monstrous events
within a family drama that is silly at
best. Jane is tired of her younger
brother Marty who, as a cripple, is
apparently favored by their par
ents. Marty wants his sister to like
him and does everything he can to
make amends. Finally, as if that
weren't enough to strike fear in the
hearts of serious movie-goers, we
meet Marty's uncle and favorite rel
ative whom everyone else con
siders a drunk and a failure.

The three brought
by Marty's belief in the monster.
After the final ordeal Marty can fi
nally tell his sister that he loves
her. This sugary subplot is truly the
most terrorizing aspect of the
movie.

If you are a horror movie con
noisseur, you will quickly deduce
that "Silver Bullet" is the most
recent of horror films, not because
it offers anything particularly new
or inventive, but because it incor
porates every available technique
from the successes of the recent
horror craze: from the stalking
camera (complete with heavy
breathing) of a "Friday the 13th" to
the striking, sophisticated
metamorphoses found in "An
American Werewolf in London."
However, the addition of all

these techniques yields nothing
more than that: the repetition of ef
fects that at one time thrilled
audiences. In itself that may not be
so bad. It may be just what you are
looking for. But "Silver Bullet" tries
to redeem itself with the sappy sub
plot. The result is a cross between
"Halloween" and"The Brady
Bunch."
One could spend time condemn
ing the project of horror films in
their entirety for many different
reasons, and such a task certainly
deserves some thought. Neverthe
less, within the genre one can
readily talk about better and worse,
and "Silver Bullet" is worse. It of
fers none of the quality of "An
American Werewolf in London,"
none of the fear or macabre ele
ments of King's own "The Shining,"
and none of the sense of evil found
in "The Exorcist."
The truly good horror film
focuses not so much on the act of
terror as on the mystery of the
monstrous and the response to it,
both individual and communal.
"Silver Bullet" explores nothing of
the kind and chooses instead to
compile pure cinematic effect with
worthless drama.
