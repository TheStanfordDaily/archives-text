# Franklin Appeals to State Court
## 
### DAVID EMERSON Staff writer 
H. Bruce Franklin, a former associate profes
sor of English here who was terminated by the
University for his role in a 1971 anti-war protest,
yesterday appealed his dismissal to the California
Supreme Court.
The University's dismissal of Franklin was up
held last month by the Sixth District Court of Ap
peals.
American Civil Liberties Union lawyers
representing Franklin told the Times Tribune
that by upholding Franklin's firing, the appellate
court in effect "denies California teachers rights
of political advocacy and action they would nor

mally enjoy as citizens."
The appeal asks the California Supreme Court
to grant a hearing and reverse the lower court's
ruling on the grounds that the First Amendment
protects the advocacy of civil disobedience.
On Feb. 10, 1971, Franklin made a speech in
White Plaza urging students to occupy and "shut
down" a University computer center because a
program simulating an amphibious invasion of In
dochina was being tested there.
Following his speech, over 100 students
forced their way into the building, causing ap
proximately $800 damage. The protesters left
when police arrived.
Franklin himself did not enter the center, but
he urged the demonstrators to ignore police
demands to leave the area.

After the incident, then-University President
Richard Lyman filed charges against Franklin
with the Faculty Advisory Board. After 33 days
of hearings, the committee voted 5-2 to recom
mend dismissal. Franklin was fired Aug. 31,
1972.
Franklin then filed suit against Stanford asking
for back pay, damages and reinstatement. In Jan
uary 1978, a trial court upheld two of three Uni
versity charges against him and denied his suit.
In 1980, the Board of Trustees reaffirmed his
firing. Franklin then filed suit with the Court of
Appeals.
In a Sept. 20, 1985 ruling by the appellate
court. Franklin's dismissal was upheld once
again.
