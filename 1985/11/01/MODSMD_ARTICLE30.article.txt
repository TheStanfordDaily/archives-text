# Jazz Gala Benefits All

### LISA MARTINEZ 
The sounds were sweet Sunday
night at the Oakland Convention
Center as three of the biggest
names in jazz bebopped for an
enthralled audience.
A benefit for the East Oakland
Youth Development Center, the
concert featured Dizzy Gillespie,
Max Roach and Nancy Wilson. It
was sponsored by KJAZ and Shar
lene Hirsch Enterprises.
The concert kicked off with a
bang as Gillespie strutted onstage,
horn in hand, and began to play with
a pick-me-up beat. The mellow
t(>nes of his unusual trumpet
farmed the air with delightful jazz
melodies.
With perfect control over every
note, he set the mood of each num
ber with astounding accuracy. Gil
lespie's musical range was vast as

he went from deep rich tones to
high octaves, making his trumpet
sound other-worldly.
The audience especially enjoyed
the electricity between Gillespie
and his baritone sax player, Sayyd
Abdul Al-Khabyyr, as they shared
the stage. The two playful per
sonalities teased each other con
stantly, with music as well as
words.
Breaking into "Bolero" during
Gillespie's final song, "Night in
Tunisia," Sayyd was jokingly
reprimanded by Gillespie. He
picked up Gillespie's tune, and the
throaty baritone sax submerged the
convention center in its richly
textured tones. After a cake had
been brought out to celebrate Gil
lespie's 68th birthday and the cur
tain closed, the "Beethoven of
Bebop" ended on a humorous note
by showing the crowd his
trademark cheeks.

Max Roach Quartet took the stage
to begin the second set of the eve
ning. As the jazz percussionist
stroked his drums, he set the
crowd on fire with his astounding
rhythms. The highlight of their set
came during the cymbal solo played
by Roach.
The audience was curious when
the percussionist came onstage and
sat down behind a single high hat
cymbal. Roach started in with skill
as he tapped the cymbal tunefully.
He teased the audience with offbeat
rhythms by playing not only the
high hat, but also the stand, his
drumsticks and even the floor.
Wilson topped off the concert
with a sexy vocal solo, showing off
her tremendous range
The soothing sounds of tradi
tional jazz as well as the rhythmic
beat of scat jazz brought the mar
velous evening to an end with
finesse.


Trumpeter-flugelhornist Dizzy Gillespie was among those who gave a benefit performance at the
East Oakland Youth Development Center Jazz Gala Sunday.
