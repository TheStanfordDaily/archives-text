## Yosemite Park Offers Civilized Wilderness

Yosemite National Park
Location: Approximately 220
miles west of Stanford
Area Code: 209
Just 220 miles from the Farm lies
magnificent Yosemite National
Park. While the park as a whole
covers over 1,200 square miles, to
most visitors Yosemite National
Park is synonymous with Yosemite
Valley.
Many people consider this strik
ing valley the single most beautiful
spot on earth. While only seven miles
long and barely a mile wide, the val
ley is surrounded by imposing
3,000-foot high walls of solid
granite. The granite walls form the

backdrop of numerous thundering
waterfalls.
With beauty and majesty that al
most defies description, it is no
wonder that people of fame and
fortune have, been lured here for
over a century. John Muir, founder
of the modern conservation move
ment, arrived here in 1868 and
founded the Sierra Club to help
preserve the park. Both P.T. Bar
num and Ralph Waldo Emerson
survived treks via horse and mule
to vist the park in the 1870s. More
recent notable visitors have in
cluded presidents Roosevelt, Taft,
Kennedy, Grant, Hayes, Hoover
and Reagan, as well as nobility from
England, Italy, Sweden, Belgium
and Nepal.
Yosemite offers something for
everyone. While the valley is well
developed, the high country above

the valley remains relatively des
olate and unspoiled. Mountain
purists find the juxtaposition of
civilization and wilderness in the
valley a desecration of the natural
order. Indeed, the valley caters to
the throngs of tourists who descend
upon it each year with a plethora of
grocery stores, tent cities, snack
shops and souvenir stands.
However, these amenities make
Yosemite an easy place to visit for
those who lack wilderness ex
pertise. Furthermore, under a new
general management plan, things
are improving. The intrusion of
civilization into this natural wonder
land is becoming easier to ignore.
Traffic has been greatly reduced
thanks to an efficient and free
shuttle system. Large areas of the
park are being returned to their
pristine state.
There are numerous choices of
lodging in Yosemite and during the
fall and winter months, reserva
tions are much easier to come by.
For the hardy, there is camping in
the National Park Service's organ
ized campgrounds. The Upper and
Lower Pines and Upper and Lower
River campsites are the most
popular and can be reserved in ad
vance through Ticketron outlets.
Campsite fees vary but are gener
ally $7 per site per night. However,
during the winter months rangers
rarely bother to collect fees from
the few brave campers. Camping
outside of official campgrounds will
get you a stiff fine and a hearing
before the park's federal magistrate
court. The long arm of the law ex
tends well into the Sierra Nevada at
Yosemite.
The Yosemite Park and Curry
Company offer a variety of accom
modations within the park.' The
least expensive choice is the canvas
tent cabins at Curry Village that
rent for $19 per night, double oc
cupancy. These have electric

lights, but no heating or bathrooms.
While high on the economy scale,
these tent cabins rate a D- on
cupid's romance scale (evaluation of
the romantic potential). Cupid
never did like army surplus metal
cots in subfreezing weather. Both
Curry Village and Yosemite Lodge
offer cabins without baths for $41
per night ($30.50 midweek). Cabins
with private baths cost $57 per
night ($38.50 midweek). The
cabins score a weak C- on cupid's
romance scale.
Yosemite Lodge also offers
motel-style rooms for $62.50 per
night double occupancy (SSB mid
week). Cupid scored these rooms

in the B range. An endlessly run
ning toilet made whispering sweet
nothings a bit tough. Good beds,
but thin walls and towels bring the
ratings down. For those seeking
plush luxury there is The Ahwah
nee Hotel with rooms starting at
$134 per night. While not exactly an
economic bargain, cupid's scale
gives The Ahwahnee a solid A-.
The separate Ahwahnee cottages
nestled in the woods garner an easy
A.
The Ahwahnee's interior was im
mortalized in the film "The
Shining," starring Jack Nicholson.
For those who don't stay at the Ah
wahnee but still want to take in

some of its splendor, its huge dining
room ranks among the finest in Cal
ifornia. Jackets are required for din
ner, but breakfast and lunch are
casual. Sunday brunch is excep
tional and fairly inexpensive.
Outside the valley, the Curry
Company maintains facilities at
Tuolumne Meadows and at
Wawona, home of the famous giant
trees. This year, the Wawona Hotel
will remain open on weekends
through Thanksgiving.
The Curry Company sponsors
several special events in the park
during the winter months. The
