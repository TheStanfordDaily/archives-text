# DIVERSIONS
## Yosemite Park Offers Civilized Wilderness 
### JEFFREY MALTZMAN Staff writer 
Yosemite National Park
Location: Approximately 220
miles west of Stanford
Area Code: 209
Just 220 miles from the Farm lies
magnificent Yosemite National
Park. While the park as a whole
covers over 1,200 square miles, to
most visitors Yosemite National
Park is synonymous with Yosemite
Valley.
Many people consider this strik
ing valley the single most beautiful
spot on earth. While only seven miles
long and barely a mile wide, the val
ley is surrounded by imposing
3,000-foot high walls of solid
granite. The granite walls form the

backdrop of numerous thundering
waterfalls.
With beauty and majesty that al
most defies description, it is no
wonder that people of fame and
fortune have, been lured here for
over a century. John Muir, founder
of the modern conservation move
ment, arrived here in 1868 and
founded the Sierra Club to help
preserve the park. Both P.T. Bar
num and Ralph Waldo Emerson
survived treks via horse and mule
to vist the park in the 1870s. More
recent notable visitors have in
cluded presidents Roosevelt, Taft,
Kennedy, Grant, Hayes, Hoover
and Reagan, as well as nobility from
England, Italy, Sweden, Belgium
and Nepal.
Yosemite offers something for
everyone. While the valley is well
developed, the high country above

the valley remains relatively des
olate and unspoiled. Mountain
purists find the juxtaposition of
civilization and wilderness in the
valley a desecration of the natural
order. Indeed, the valley caters to
the throngs of tourists who descend
upon it each year with a plethora of
grocery stores, tent cities, snack
shops and souvenir stands.
However, these amenities make
Yosemite an easy place to visit for
those who lack wilderness ex
pertise. Furthermore, under a new
general management plan, things
are improving. The intrusion of
civilization into this natural wonder
land is becoming easier to ignore.
Traffic has been greatly reduced
thanks to an efficient and free
shuttle system. Large areas of the
park are being returned to their
pristine state.
There are numerous choices of
lodging in Yosemite and during the
fall and winter months, reserva
tions are much easier to come by.
For the hardy, there is camping in
the National Park Service's organ
ized campgrounds. The Upper and
Lower Pines and Upper and Lower
River campsites are the most
popular and can be reserved in ad
vance through Ticketron outlets.
Campsite fees vary but are gener
ally $7 per site per night. However,
during the winter months rangers
rarely bother to collect fees from
the few brave campers. Camping
outside of official campgrounds will
get you a stiff fine and a hearing
before the park's federal magistrate
court. The long arm of the law ex
tends well into the Sierra Nevada at
Yosemite.
The Yosemite Park and Curry
Company offer a variety of accom
modations within the park.' The
least expensive choice is the canvas
tent cabins at Curry Village that
rent for $19 per night, double oc
cupancy. These have electric

lights, but no heating or bathrooms.
While high on the economy scale,
these tent cabins rate a D- on
cupid's romance scale (evaluation of
the romantic potential). Cupid
never did like army surplus metal
cots in subfreezing weather. Both
Curry Village and Yosemite Lodge
offer cabins without baths for $41
per night ($30.50 midweek). Cabins
with private baths cost $57 per
night ($38.50 midweek). The
cabins score a weak C- on cupid's
romance scale.
Yosemite Lodge also offers
motel-style rooms for $62.50 per
night double occupancy (SSB mid
week). Cupid scored these rooms

in the B range. An endlessly run
ning toilet made whispering sweet
nothings a bit tough. Good beds,
but thin walls and towels bring the
ratings down. For those seeking
plush luxury there is The Ahwah
nee Hotel with rooms starting at
$134 per night. While not exactly an
economic bargain, cupid's scale
gives The Ahwahnee a solid A-.
The separate Ahwahnee cottages
nestled in the woods garner an easy
A.
The Ahwahnee's interior was im
mortalized in the film "The
Shining," starring Jack Nicholson.
For those who don't stay at the Ah
wahnee but still want to take in

some of its splendor, its huge dining
room ranks among the finest in Cal
ifornia. Jackets are required for din
ner, but breakfast and lunch are
casual. Sunday brunch is excep
tional and fairly inexpensive.
Outside the valley, the Curry
Company maintains facilities at
Tuolumne Meadows and at
Wawona, home of the famous giant
trees. This year, the Wawona Hotel
will remain open on weekends
through Thanksgiving.
The Curry Company sponsors
several special events in the park
during the winter months. The

Park.

most noted of these are the
Vintners' Holidays, which include
tastings and seminars with some of
the most prestigious vintners in
California. Eight sessions of
Vintners' Holidays are scheduled
Nov. 13 through Dec. 17.
Two other special events in the
park are the Chefs' Holidays and
the Musicians' Holidays. These are
scheduled for Jan. 5-23 and Jan. 26-
Feb. 6, respectively.
Reservations for all the above
facilities and events can be made by
calling 209-252-4848 or by writing:
Yosemite Park and Curry Company
Reservations, 5410 E. Home,
Fresno, CA 93727.
The first and foremost attrac
tion for visitors in the valley is the
valley itself. Yosemite Falls, Bridal
Veil Falls and Mirror Lake are all
within a 10-minute hike of shuttle
stops. For those with a bit more en
ergy, day hikes above the valley
will take you to such majestic places
as the top of Upper Yosemite Falls,
Glacier Point or the top of Half
Dome.
As winter quickly approaches,
some trails may be closed due to ice

and snow. Make sure to check with
the park service before setting off.
Trail and weather information is
provided free at the Visitor's Cen
ter in the Yosemite Village Shop
ping Mall. As the valley is at a
relatively low elevation, most trails
do not close until well into winter
and a few are open all year.
A definite must for a daytime
hike is the trek up the Mist Trail to
Vernal and Nevada Falls from the
Happy Isles Shuttle Stop. Beware,
while this trip looks easy on the trail
map, the hike up is grueling. Much
of the path is so steep that steps
have been carved directly out of the
granite walls to scale the cliffs.
During our most recent visit this
trail was already marked closed for
winter, but nobody seemed to pay
any heed to the sign as the trail was
busy as ever.
For those seeking to explore the
valley and surrounding rim in a
more organized fashion, the Curry
Company runs bus tours several
times daily departing from both the
lodge and Camp Curry. Weather
permitting, bikes are available for
rent at the lodge for self-guided
tours.
If you have a car, a drive along
the Tioga Road (Trans-Sierra High
way 120) is spectacular. The Tioga
Road remains open until the first
major snowstorm of the season.

Closure depends upon weather, but
it usually occurs between early No
vember and late December.
For ski buffs, Yosemite is home
to Badger Pass Ski Area with both
Alpine and Nordic runs. The down
hill area is geared toward beginning
and intermediate skiers. Lift tickets
are $16 per person (sls midweek)
for adults and $8 for children. Les
sons and rental equipment are
available. Badger Pass is celebrat
ing its 50th anniversary this year.
Free bus service to and from
Badger Pass is provided from
Yosemite Lodge. For Nordic
skiing, Badger Pass offers over 32
kilometers of groomed track skiing
and more than 90 miles of well
marked trails with outstanding
views of the high Sierras.
If you are driving to Yosemite, be
sure to carry chains during the win
ter months. While chains are rarely
required on valley floor roads or on
Highway 140, they are often
needed up to Badger Pass and on
the Tioga Trans-Sierra Highway.
For current information on road and
weather conditions call the National
Park Service recording at 209-372-
4605. For information on downhill
ski conditions, recommended
cross-country ski waxes, and a lis
ting of other park activities, call the
Badger Pass snow phone at 209-

The first and foremost attrac
tion for visitors in the valley is the
valley itself. Yosemite Falls, Bridal
Veil Falls and Mirror Lake are all
within a 10-minute hike of shuttle
stops. For those with a bit more en
ergy, day hikes above the valley
will take you to such majestic places
as the top of Upper Yosemite Falls,
Glacier Point or the top of Half
Dome.
As winter quickly approaches,
some trails may be closed due to ice

and snow. Make sure to check with
the park service before setting off.
Trail and weather information is
provided free at the Visitor's Cen
ter in the Yosemite Village Shop
ping Mall. As the valley is at a
relatively low elevation, most trails
do not close until well into winter
and a few are open all year.
A definite must for a daytime
hike is the trek up the Mist Trail to
Vernal and Nevada Falls from the
Happy Isles Shuttle Stop. Beware,
while this trip looks easy on the trail
map, the hike up is grueling. Much
of the path is so steep that steps
have been carved directly out of the
granite walls to scale the cliffs.
During our most recent visit this
trail was already marked closed for
winter, but nobody seemed to pay
any heed to the sign as the trail was
busy as ever.
For those seeking to explore the
valley and surrounding rim in a
more organized fashion, the Curry
Company runs bus tours several
times daily departing from both the
lodge and Camp Curry. Weather
permitting, bikes are available for
rent at the lodge for self-guided
tours.
If you have a car, a drive along
the Tioga Road (Trans-Sierra High
way 120) is spectacular. The Tioga
Road remains open until the first
major snowstorm of the season.

Closure depends upon weather, but
it usually occurs between early No
vember and late December.
For ski buffs, Yosemite is home
to Badger Pass Ski Area with both
Alpine and Nordic runs. The down
hill area is geared toward beginning
and intermediate skiers. Lift tickets
are $16 per person (sls midweek)
for adults and $8 for children. Les
sons and rental equipment are
available. Badger Pass is celebrat
ing its 50th anniversary this year.
Free bus service to and from
Badger Pass is provided from
Yosemite Lodge. For Nordic
skiing, Badger Pass offers over 32
kilometers of groomed track skiing
and more than 90 miles of well
marked trails with outstanding
views of the high Sierras.
If you are driving to Yosemite, be
sure to carry chains during the win
ter months. While chains are rarely
required on valley floor roads or on
Highway 140, they are often
needed up to Badger Pass and on
the Tioga Trans-Sierra Highway.

Yosemite National Park
Location: Approximately 220
miles west of Stanford
Area Code: 209
Just 220 miles from the Farm lies
magnificent Yosemite National
Park. While the park as a whole
covers over 1,200 square miles, to
most visitors Yosemite National
Park is synonymous with Yosemite
Valley.
Many people consider this strik
ing valley the single most beautiful
spot on earth. While only seven miles
long and barely a mile wide, the val
ley is surrounded by imposing
3,000-foot high walls of solid
granite. The granite walls form the

backdrop of numerous thundering
waterfalls.
With beauty and majesty that al
most defies description, it is no
wonder that people of fame and
fortune have, been lured here for
over a century. John Muir, founder
of the modern conservation move
ment, arrived here in 1868 and
founded the Sierra Club to help
preserve the park. Both P.T. Bar
num and Ralph Waldo Emerson
survived treks via horse and mule
to vist the park in the 1870s. More
recent notable visitors have in
cluded presidents Roosevelt, Taft,
Kennedy, Grant, Hayes, Hoover
and Reagan, as well as nobility from
England, Italy, Sweden, Belgium
and Nepal.
Yosemite offers something for
everyone. While the valley is well
developed, the high country above

the valley remains relatively des
olate and unspoiled. Mountain
purists find the juxtaposition of
civilization and wilderness in the
valley a desecration of the natural
order. Indeed, the valley caters to
the throngs of tourists who descend
upon it each year with a plethora of
grocery stores, tent cities, snack
shops and souvenir stands.
However, these amenities make
Yosemite an easy place to visit for
those who lack wilderness ex
pertise. Furthermore, under a new
general management plan, things
are improving. The intrusion of
civilization into this natural wonder
land is becoming easier to ignore.
Traffic has been greatly reduced
thanks to an efficient and free
shuttle system. Large areas of the
park are being returned to their
pristine state.
There are numerous choices of
lodging in Yosemite and during the
fall and winter months, reserva
tions are much easier to come by.
For the hardy, there is camping in
the National Park Service's organ
ized campgrounds. The Upper and
Lower Pines and Upper and Lower
River campsites are the most
popular and can be reserved in ad
vance through Ticketron outlets.
Campsite fees vary but are gener
ally $7 per site per night. However,
during the winter months rangers
rarely bother to collect fees from
the few brave campers. Camping
outside of official campgrounds will
get you a stiff fine and a hearing
before the park's federal magistrate
court. The long arm of the law ex
tends well into the Sierra Nevada at
Yosemite.
The Yosemite Park and Curry
Company offer a variety of accom
modations within the park.' The
least expensive choice is the canvas
tent cabins at Curry Village that
rent for $19 per night, double oc
cupancy. These have electric

lights, but no heating or bathrooms.
While high on the economy scale,
these tent cabins rate a D- on
cupid's romance scale (evaluation of
the romantic potential). Cupid
never did like army surplus metal
cots in subfreezing weather. Both
Curry Village and Yosemite Lodge
offer cabins without baths for $41
per night ($30.50 midweek). Cabins
with private baths cost $57 per
night ($38.50 midweek). The
cabins score a weak C- on cupid's
romance scale.
Yosemite Lodge also offers
motel-style rooms for $62.50 per
night double occupancy (SSB mid
week). Cupid scored these rooms

in the B range. An endlessly run
ning toilet made whispering sweet
nothings a bit tough. Good beds,
but thin walls and towels bring the
ratings down. For those seeking
plush luxury there is The Ahwah
nee Hotel with rooms starting at
$134 per night. While not exactly an
economic bargain, cupid's scale
gives The Ahwahnee a solid A-.
The separate Ahwahnee cottages
nestled in the woods garner an easy
A.
The Ahwahnee's interior was im
mortalized in the film "The
Shining," starring Jack Nicholson.
For those who don't stay at the Ah
wahnee but still want to take in

some of its splendor, its huge dining
room ranks among the finest in Cal
ifornia. Jackets are required for din
ner, but breakfast and lunch are
casual. Sunday brunch is excep
tional and fairly inexpensive.
Outside the valley, the Curry
Company maintains facilities at
Tuolumne Meadows and at
Wawona, home of the famous giant
trees. This year, the Wawona Hotel
will remain open on weekends
through Thanksgiving.
The Curry Company sponsors
several special events in the park

preserve the park. Both P.T. Bar
num and Ralph Waldo Emerson
survived treks via horse and mule
to vist the park in the 1870s. More
recent notable visitors have in
cluded presidents Roosevelt, Taft,
Kennedy, Grant, Hayes, Hoover
and Reagan, as well as nobility from
England, Italy, Sweden, Belgium
and Nepal.
Yosemite offers something for
everyone. While the valley is well
developed, the high country above

the valley remains relatively des
olate and unspoiled. Mountain
purists find the juxtaposition of
civilization and wilderness in the
valley a desecration of the natural
order. Indeed, the valley caters to
the throngs of tourists who descend
upon it each year with a plethora of
grocery stores, tent cities, snack
shops and souvenir stands.
However, these amenities make
Yosemite an easy place to visit for
those who lack wilderness ex
pertise. Furthermore, under a new
general management plan, things
are improving. The intrusion of
civilization into this natural wonder
land is becoming easier to ignore.
Traffic has been greatly reduced
thanks to an efficient and free
shuttle system. Large areas of the
park are being returned to their
pristine state.
There are numerous choices of
lodging in Yosemite and during the
fall and winter months, reserva
tions are much easier to come by.
For the hardy, there is camping in
the National Park Service's organ
ized campgrounds. The Upper and
Lower Pines and Upper and Lower
River campsites are the most
popular and can be reserved in ad
vance through Ticketron outlets.
Campsite fees vary but are gener
ally $7 per site per night. However,
during the winter months rangers
rarely bother to collect fees from
the few brave campers. Camping
outside of official campgrounds will
get you a stiff fine and a hearing
before the park's federal magistrate
court. The long arm of the law ex
tends well into the Sierra Nevada at
Yosemite.
The Yosemite Park and Curry
Company offer a variety of accom
modations within the park.' The
least expensive choice is the canvas
tent cabins at Curry Village that
rent for $19 per night, double oc
cupancy. These have electric

lights, but no heating or bathrooms.
While high on the economy scale,
these tent cabins rate a D- on
cupid's romance scale (evaluation of
the romantic potential). Cupid
never did like army surplus metal
cots in subfreezing weather. Both
Curry Village and Yosemite Lodge
offer cabins without baths for $41
per night ($30.50 midweek). Cabins
with private baths cost $57 per
night ($38.50 midweek). The
cabins score a weak C- on cupid's
romance scale.
Yosemite Lodge also offers
motel-style rooms for $62.50 per
night double occupancy (SSB mid
week). Cupid scored these rooms

in the B range. An endlessly run
ning toilet made whispering sweet
nothings a bit tough. Good beds,
but thin walls and towels bring the
ratings down. For those seeking
plush luxury there is The Ahwah
nee Hotel with rooms starting at
$134 per night. While not exactly an
economic bargain, cupid's scale
gives The Ahwahnee a solid A-.
The separate Ahwahnee cottages
nestled in the woods garner an easy
A.
The Ahwahnee's interior was im
mortalized in the film "The
Shining," starring Jack Nicholson.
For those who don't stay at the Ah
wahnee but still want to take in

some of its splendor, its huge dining
room ranks among the finest in Cal
ifornia. Jackets are required for din
ner, but breakfast and lunch are
casual. Sunday brunch is excep
tional and fairly inexpensive.
Outside the valley, the Curry
Company maintains facilities at
Tuolumne Meadows and at
Wawona, home of the famous giant
trees. This year, the Wawona Hotel
will remain open on weekends
through Thanksgiving.
The Curry Company sponsors
several special events in the park
during the winter months. The

most noted of these are the
Vintners' Holidays, which include
tastings and seminars with some of
the most prestigious vintners in
California. Eight sessions of
Vintners' Holidays are scheduled
Nov. 13 through Dec. 17.
Two other special events in the
park are the Chefs' Holidays and
the Musicians' Holidays. These are
scheduled for Jan. 5-23 and Jan. 26-
Feb. 6, respectively.
Reservations for all the above
facilities and events can be made by

The first and foremost attrac
tion for visitors in the valley is the
valley itself. Yosemite Falls, Bridal
Veil Falls and Mirror Lake are all
within a 10-minute hike of shuttle
stops. For those with a bit more en
ergy, day hikes above the valley
will take you to such majestic places
as the top of Upper Yosemite Falls,
Glacier Point or the top of Half
Dome.
As winter quickly approaches,
some trails may be closed due to ice

and snow. Make sure to check with
the park service before setting off.
Trail and weather information is
provided free at the Visitor's Cen
ter in the Yosemite Village Shop
ping Mall. As the valley is at a
relatively low elevation, most trails
do not close until well into winter
and a few are open all year.
A definite must for a daytime
hike is the trek up the Mist Trail to
Vernal and Nevada Falls from the
Happy Isles Shuttle Stop. Beware,
while this trip looks easy on the trail
map, the hike up is grueling. Much
of the path is so steep that steps
have been carved directly out of the
granite walls to scale the cliffs.
During our most recent visit this
trail was already marked closed for
winter, but nobody seemed to pay
any heed to the sign as the trail was
busy as ever.
For those seeking to explore the
valley and surrounding rim in a
more organized fashion, the Curry
Company runs bus tours several
times daily departing from both the
lodge and Camp Curry. Weather
permitting, bikes are available for
rent at the lodge for self-guided
tours.
If you have a car, a drive along
the Tioga Road (Trans-Sierra High
way 120) is spectacular. The Tioga
Road remains open until the first
major snowstorm of the season.

Closure depends upon weather, but
it usually occurs between early No
vember and late December.
For ski buffs, Yosemite is home
to Badger Pass Ski Area with both
Alpine and Nordic runs. The down
hill area is geared toward beginning
and intermediate skiers. Lift tickets
are $16 per person (sls midweek)
for adults and $8 for children. Les
sons and rental equipment are
available. Badger Pass is celebrat
ing its 50th anniversary this year.
Free bus service to and from
Badger Pass is provided from
Yosemite Lodge. For Nordic
skiing, Badger Pass offers over 32
kilometers of groomed track skiing
and more than 90 miles of well
marked trails with outstanding
views of the high Sierras.
If you are driving to Yosemite, be
sure to carry chains during the win
ter months. While chains are rarely
required on valley floor roads or on
Highway 140, they are often
needed up to Badger Pass and on
the Tioga Trans-Sierra Highway.
