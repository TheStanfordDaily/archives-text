## It's Time for the Rolex Tourney Women's tennis tournament draws a large field 
### BRENDAN HEALEY 
The Stanford women's tennis team will host
the Rolex Northern California Collegiate Tennis
Championships this weekend for the third
straight year, and Cardinal netters are favored to
win both the doubles and singles titles for the
third consecutive time.
At this Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Associ
ation event, 10 Cardinal singles players and five
Cardinal doubles teams will attempt to qualify for
the National Indoor Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships, to be held in Houston in
February.
Thirty-two other singles players and 17 other
doubles teams — the largest field ever — will
also be vying for that honor, but the Cardinal
dominates the seeds, with three of the top four

doubles teams and five singles players among
the top eight.
Only the singles champion, the singles runner
up and the doubles champions will qualify from
this tournament. Other competitors may qualify
as wild cards by virtue of their season records.
Stanford freshman Eleni Rossides is seeded
No. 1 in the tournament and is followed by junior
teammate Leigh Anne Eldredge. Cal Ail-
American Heather Ettus will attempt to break
the Cardinal monopoly from her' third-seeded
spot in the draw, and Stanford junior Stephanie
Savides rounds out the top four.
Playing with graduated senior Linda Gates,
Eldredge won the national ITCA doubles title in
Houston last year.
"1 really enjoyed it," Eldredge said of the na
tional tournament. "I'd love to go back. It was
really a strong tournament."

Eldredge holds down the top doubles seed
with junior Patty Fendick, while Savides and
sophomore Cari Hagey look to challenge after
being tabbed second.
For women's tennis Coach Frank Brennan,
the tournament will be an opportunity to evalu
ate his team and those of his opponents in the
Cardinal's only real fall competition.
"We can get all the benefits of a dual match and
not have to put it on the line so to speak," Bren
nan said. "It's just a real nice way to get some
competition. It gives us something to point for in
the fall. It's kind of a benchmark. It's also an op
portunity for me to look at some other teams."
Action kicks off at 10:30 this morning at the
tennis complex and will resume at 9 a.m. tomor
row and Sunday. The singles and doubles finals
are expected to take place at 1 and 2:30
respectively Sunday afternoon.
