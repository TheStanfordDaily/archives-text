# Polo faces five teams in three days
## A
						Big Road Trip South 
### INGRID SEYER Staff writer 
The Stanford water polo team has regained
its No. 1 national ranking, is top-ranked in the
Pacific 10 Conference and is entering this
weekend's 49er Invitational Tournament with
four consecutive victories backing it up. The
horizon could hardly be brighter.
Well, except for the fact that the Cardinal
will be facing five teams in three days this
weekend, and four of those teams are in the
Top 10. Other than that, the horizon couldn't
be brighter.
The Cardinal (15-3) will travel south to play
UC-San Diego today at 3 p.m. Then the squad
will go to Long Beach to participate in the two
day 49er Invitational at Belmont Pool Plaza.
Competing in Long Beach, in addition to
Stanford, will be Berkeley, UCLA, (JSC, UC-
Irvine, Long Beach State, Pepperdine, Fresno
State, UC-Santa Barbara and UC-San Diego.
The Cardinal will play Long Beach (11 a.m.)
and Pepperdine (5:50) tomorrow. Games
against Irvine (11 a.m.) and Santa Barbara
(4:40) will be played on Sunday.
San Diego, ranked 15th in the nation, has
the potential to present a problem for the
Cardinal today â€” if it can come out strong.
"We don't know that much about San Diego
this year, but they have given us trouble at
their pool in the past, and they stiU have that

potential," water polo Coach Dante Detta
manti said. "While we won't be taking them
lightly, we will be using the game as a warm-up
for the tournament. Hopefully the match will
give us a chance to let our second-string put in
some playing time."
The playing time for the second-string is of
high priority to the Stanford team. "In tourna
ments like the one coming up, where you have
to play four tough teams in two days, the team
with the best bench is the team that wins,"
Dettamanti said.
Stanford will certainly need a strong bench if
it hopes to come home this weekend with five
victories.
"The 49er Invitational is by far the toughest
tournament of the year, far more difficult than
the NCAA Championship Tournament. At the
NCAAs you only have to play three games, but
at this tournament you have to play four," Det
tamanti said. "This weekend will really give us
a chance to get in a lot of valuable playing time
against the nation's top teams."
According to Dettamanti, there is really no
way in a tournament such as this one to try and
pace a team in preparation for upcoming
games. Instead, "You have to go all-out in
every game."
Because "going all-out" requires a lot of en
ergy, the entire Cardinal lineup will be playing
in the tournament this weekend, allowing all of
the players to take turns resting.
"Everyone will be involved this weekend,

and everyone will have to contribute," Detta
manti said. "Consistency will be very impor
tant this weekend. In four games, there are a
lot of chances to make mistakes or fall into a
rut. The tournament is a series of emotional
peaks and valleys for all the teams and where
those peaks and valleys meet will determine
who the winners are."
While all of the teams Stanford will be
playing are fairly equal in talent, each team has
its own areas of expertise. Irvine (14-5),
ranked No. 2, should be led by U.S. National
Team member Jeff Campbell, while Santa Bar
bara (16-4) has a well-balanced scoring attack,
sparked by a contingent of Canadian and
Mexican Olympians.
With the nation's top teams pretty much
evenly matched at this point in the season, it is
difficult to say which team will be winning the
most matches this weekend, but Dettamanti
certainly hopes it will be Stanford.
"We really want to come home this weekend
with five victories and a lot of experience be
hind us," Dettamanti said. "We will be playing
in the pool that the NCAAs will be played in,
and this tournament will give (us) a great
chance to get used to the indoor conditions."
As it looks now, the Cardinal could be enter
ing the NCAAs with the No. 1 seed. That is
precisely Stanford's goal. The team entering
the NCAAs with the top seed is guaranteed a
berth against the bottom seed in the first
round of play, allowing the team to rest up for
the remaining two matches.


Platooning will be a key for the Stanford water polo team this
weekend as it faces five teams, four of which are in the na-
