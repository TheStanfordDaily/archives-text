# Huskies have gone to the dogs
## Washington Football Has Fallen of Late 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
Two months after Sports Il
lustrated picked them as the No. 1
team in college football, the Wash
ington Huskies are deep in the poll
sters' doghouse.
Washington, which will host Stan
ford tomorrow at 12:30 p.m., isn't
ranked by anyone now and probably
won't be for the rest of the year.
The Huskies opened the season
with big losses to Oklahoma State
and Brigham Young. After winning
their next four games, they
dropped an inexplicable 21-20 deci
sion to Oregon State, a 37-point un
derdog.
Thanks to their win over UCLA,
a Rose Bowl berth is still a possibil
ity for the Huskies — but only if
they win their last four games and
Arizona loses once more.
And the way they've been
playing, that's not very likely.
"We've deteriorated," Washing
ton Coach Don James said. "I don't
know if it's coaching, injuries or the
teams we've played. In our last
three games, we haven't been ef
fective on offense, defense or spe
cial teams.
"I don't think there's a player or
coach on our team who thought that
(No. 1 ranking) was realistic," he
continued. "That was just respect
for our program in the past."
There's not much left over from
the team that beat Oklahoma in the
Orange Bowl last year and finished
No. 2 in the AP and UPI polls. Four
offensive starters and five defen
sive starters returned for this
season, and a rash of injuries has

reduced those numbers even more. I
The hardest hit area has been the
offensive backfield, where seven of
the eight available backs were out
of commission at the beginning of
last week's practices. Star fullback
Rick Fenney didn't practice last
week, but after Washington's open
date last Saturday, he could be
healthy enough to play against Stan
ford tomorrow.
Defensive linemen Steve Alvord
and Andy Fuimaono, wide receiver
Mo Hill, and linebacker Joe Kelly —
to name just a few — have all been
hurting, too. It remains to be seen
if a two-week rest and the motiva
tion of the loss to the Beavers can
offset the Huskies' health prob
lems.
The keys for Washington tomor
row will be getting more balance on
offense and making big plays on
defense.
Because of the backfield injuries,
the Huskies have not been able to
set up the run lately, and quarter
back Hugh Millen has been doing a
lot of throwing. Millen has hit on
128 of his 214 passes to date for a
respectable .598 completion
percentage, but has been inter
cepted a not-so-respectable nine
times.
And the defense, last year's
strength, has not compensated for
the offensive turnovers — only 10
interceptions in seven games,
compared to 28 in 11 games in 1984.
"Last year our defense was get
ting a lot of turnovers," James said.
"When you get them back, it
doesn't hurt so much. This year,
we're not getting so many on

Stanford Coach Jack Elway gives
the 1985 Huskies a mixed rating.
"They've done well, and then on
other occasions they haven't," he
said. "They lost a lot of outstanding
football players from [1984's] tepm."
You could, of course, say the
same about the Cardinal. Elway's
squad played extremely well in Sat
urday's 28-17 upset of Arizona, but
not so well in the five losses that
preceded that game. Whether or
not Stanford will surprise the odds
makers, who rated it a 14.5-
point underdog in Seattle, will
depend on which of those two Card
inal teams shows up tomorrow. For
that matter, it will depend on which
Huskie team makes an appearance
as well.

and Andy Fuimaono, wide receiver
Mo Hill, and linebacker Joe Kelly —
to name just a few — have all been
hurting, too. It remains to be seen
if a two-week rest and the motiva
tion of the loss to the Beavers can
offset the Huskies' health prob
lems.
The keys for Washington tomor
row will be getting more balance on
offense and making big plays on
defense.
Because of the backfield injuries,
the Huskies have not been able to
set up the run lately, and quarter
back Hugh Millen has been doing a
lot of throwing. Millen has hit on
128 of his 214 passes to date for a
respectable .598 completion
percentage, but has been inter
cepted a not-so-respectable nine
times.
And the defense, last year's
strength, has not compensated for
the offensive turnovers — only 10
interceptions in seven games,
compared to 28 in 11 games in 1984.

Stanford Coach Jack Elway gives
the 1985 Huskies a mixed rating.
"They've done well, and then on
other occasions they haven't," he
said. "They lost a lot of outstanding
football players from [1984's] tepm."
You could, of course, say the
same about the Cardinal. Elway's
squad played extremely well in Sat

not so well in the five losses that
preceded that game. Whether or
not Stanford will surprise the odds
