# Booters Ready For Big Game
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
This year, Stanford's big soccer
game against the UC-Berkeley
Golden Bears may be more impor
tant than the other Big Game.
The 18th-ranked Bears bring
their potent offensive attack to
Stanford Sunday for an important
Pacific Soccer Conference contest
at 2 p.m. on Harry Maloney Field.
With identical 4-1 records, both
teams will be battling for sole
possession of second place in the
conference. Stanford is 10-6-3
overall; Cal is 14-3-1.
The Bears are coming off a 6-0
trouncing of San Jose State Wed
nesday. Cal's All-America candi
date, Mike Deleray, tallied two
goals to raise his scoring total to a
PSC-leading 19 goals on the season.
Deleray, a junior from Pleasan
ton, will be a big concern for Stan
ford soccer Coach Sam Koch.
"He's tall and quick and very
good on air balls," Koch said. "We
have to make sure we beat him to
the ball and don't give him any
room."
Koch said he is going to try to
take Deleray out of the picture by
marking him with Cardinal fullbacks
Marshall Monroe and Todd
Rafalovich.

"Marshall has the height to guard
him," Koch said. "We'll probably al
ternate Todd and Marshall to keep
someone fresh on him all the time.
Deleray and his teammates will
run up against a Cardinal defense
that has been strong all season.
Junior goaltender Tom Austin has
allowed only 13 goals in 19 games
for a conference-leading .65 goals :
per-game average.
Stanford's offense suffered some
injuries in a hard-fought 0-0 tie with
UC-Davis Wednesday afternoon.
Senior Giancarlo Ferruzzi, the
Cardinal's second leading scorer,
may be out for the rest of the
season with a broken cheekbone.
Sophomore Kevin Woodhouse suf
fered a mild concussion.
If Stanford can run Deleray out of
the Cal offense, Sunday's game
could be a low-scoring one.
The outcome of the game could
determine whether Stanford gets a
bid for the NCAA playoffs. If the
Cardinal defeats Cal, a nationally
ranked team, and also wins its last
game against University of the
Pacific on Wednesday, then the
prospect for post season play will
be good.
"Right now, any tournament play
talk is just a distraction," Koch said.
"A win over Berkeley is what we
have to worrv about."
