# Card Hosts 'Cats In Rubber Game
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
In its most important match
this year, the Stanford field hockey
team will be looking to extend its
six-game winning streak against
Chico State this afternoon at 2:30
on the Stanford hockey field.
Before the Cardinal beat Chico at
the Cal Invitational two weeks ago,
the Wildcats were ranked 18th
in the nation and were in first place
in the Northern Pacific Conference.
But with Stanford's win over Uni
versity of the Pacific on Wednes
day, and with its recent success at
Berkeley, the Cardinal has taken
over the top spot in the NorPac.
Stanford is now ranked No. 19 in
the country. The team is 7-3-1
overall and 3-1-1 in the conference.
Today's competition will be the
rubber game for the two teams.
Earlier this fall, Chico defeated the
Cardinal 2-1 on the Wildcats' home
field. It is also a must-win situation
for Stanford if the team wants to
make the cutoff for the NCAA
playoffs. Only the top 12 teams in
the nation will advance.

"We have to win, it's the only
way we can do it," senior defen
seman Lisa Stewart said.
In both their previous matches
against Chico, the Stanford players
felt they outplayed the Wildcats.
But lately, the Cardinal team has
been scoring more often than it
did earlier in the season.
According to Coach Sheryl
Johnson, the team is still not where
it would like to be in terms of finish
ing offensive plays. But the Card
inal is getting closer.
Can Stanford win its three
remaining games, something it
must do to make post-season
play? "Yes, definitely. We're on a
roll," Johnson said.
Going into this afternoon's con
frontation, the Cardinal will be
looking to do again what it did
during the two teams' last meeting
at Cal. The Cardinal women will be
looking to combat the Wildcats'
rough power game with a smooth
passing game.
Falling into the opposing squad's
style of play is exactly what Stan
ford doesn't want to do. According
to co-captain Karen Chamberlain,
that is exactly what hurt the Card
inal in Wednesday's nail-biter.

Though Fred Buckley played well for the Cardinal last week against Arizona, he was replaced in
the second half by John Paye, who, sore shoulder and all, will start tomorrow's game in Seattle
against the slumping Washington Huskies.
