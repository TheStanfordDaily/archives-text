# Women Hope for a Happy End
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
It's always nice to end on a good note.
That's what the women's soccer team will be
trying to do tomorrow when it closes out its
season with a 1 p.m. home game against a St.
Mary's team that as of last week sported a 5-5-3
record.
So far it's been a trying year for Stanford. The
Cardinal went into every game believing it had a
chance to win, but nevertheless, it is taking a
disappointing 5-11-1 record into today's game.
With that fact in mind, women's soccer Coach
Helen Keohane said she would just like to "start
building for next year with a win this year."
Whether Stanford will be able to do that is
anybody's call. St. Mary's and the Cardinal seem to
be quite evenly matched.
"(The Gaels) are having a year kind of like us.

They've been both up and down," Keohane said. "It
should be pretty even. We (Keohane and St. Mary's
Coach Randy Farris) have similar coaching
philosophies."
Luckily for the Cardinal, Farris' philosophies have
produced a St. Mary's team that plays with finesse
instead of physical intimidation and contact. All
season long Stanford has had problems combating
highly physical teams.
In Wednesday's game against a Sonoma State
team that played like "they were hacking, not kick
ing" in the words of one Stanford player, three
members of the Cardinal squad were forced to leave
the game during the first five minutes.
The Gaels' hopes for victory will depend largely on
the play of three of their top players, forwards
Stephanie Meda and Kathy Jones and sweeper Sue
Caporicci.
The Gaels' offense is led by leading scorer Meda
and her teammate Jones. Their defensive play often
depends on the performance of Caporicci.
