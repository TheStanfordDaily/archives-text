# Dean Jean Admitted as a Guest Greek
## Pigskin prognosticator Fetter picks Stanford and hurricane Juan 
### 
Coming off a mediocre 38-32 per
formance in last week's games, the
seven Daily Greeks continue, un
daunted, to bring you predictions in
10 of the top collegiate football
games across the nation.
This week's Guest" Greek is
Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter.
"I'm not the right person for this,"
Fetter said upon being notified of
the honor.
She held out until The Daily con
sented to allow her to confer with
the entire Admissions Department.
"Let me consult with my seers,"
she said. Since many of the Greeks
have younger siblings who will be
applying to Stanford in the near
future, her request was honored.
Nonetheless, Fetter is being held
responsible for these picks. She
saw Stanford shutting out Washing

ton "because we have faith. Mo
mentum is on their side."
She saw neither team winning
the Florida-Auburn game, but did
predict "hurricane Juan in a
blowout." In her other choice selec
tion, it will be "Colgate brushing
Columbia clean."
"Halloween Dean Jean and her
Band of Goblins" are trying to im
prove on the 4-6 record of last
week's Guest Greek, USW Presi
dent Dennis Blake. Overall, the
Guest Greeks are 18-12 (.667),
while The Daily's Greeks are 124-
76 (.620).
Columnist John Lis (24-6) ex
tended his lead in the race for the
case of Henry Weinhard's Private
Reserve to five games with a 7-3
week. Sports Editor Pete Haven is
second at 19-11.
