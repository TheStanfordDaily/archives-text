Spy Swap May Include Sakharov
BONN, West Germany — The United States, the Soviet Union
and East and West Germany may be planning a major East-West spy
swap in conjunction with the Geneva, Switzerland, summit meeting,
a West German newspaper reported last night.
The swap also would include the release by the Soviets of dissi
dents Andrei Sakharov and Anatoly Shcharansky, according to the
Bild, a Hamburg newspaper. Bild attributed its information to
diplomatic sources in Washington and Bonn, who were quoted as
sayjng that the possible swap would take place after President
Reagan meets with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev Nov. 19-20.
"The success of the operation will only be ensured if the summit
meeting goes well," the newspaper said. "Gorbachev then wants to
send a signal."
Bild said that, under the proposed arrangement, the United States
and West Germany would free several jailed Soviet and East German
spies in exchange for about the same number of Western agents who
have been imprisoned in the Soviet Union and East Germany.
Hussein Warns PLO on Terror
AMMAN, Jordan — While Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization agreed during talks earlier this week to push ahead with
their joint Mideast peace initiative, King Hussein warned PLO Chair
man Yasser Arafat that their relations would end if there was another
terrorist incident such as the hijacking of the Italian cruise liner Ac
hille Lauro, Jordanian officials said yesterday.
"They didn't sign anything, but it is clear that the PLO is operating
under new ground rules" from the Jordanians, one diplomat said.
In addition to the Achille Lauro affair, King Hussein, who met
Arafat Monday night, was upset with the PLO over the murder of
three Israelis in Larnaca, Cyprus, in late September and the collapse
two weeks ago of a planned meeting in London between British offi
cials and two senior PLO aides.
While Arafat was not asked to make any written promises, one
Jordanian official said that "it was implicit that the PLO would stop all
violence outside the occupied territories." The PLO maintains that
violence in Israeli-occupied lands is justifiable resistance against il
legal oppression.
CIA Presses for Aid to UNITA
WASHINGTON — The Defense Department and Central Intelli
gence Agency are urging the White House to approve — before the
U.S.-Soviet summit — a large covert military operation to aid rebels
fighting the Marxist Angolan government, congressional and intelli
gence sources said yesterday.
One source said the money proposed is in the range of "two to
three hundred million dollars," a figure eight to 10 times higher than
any proposed aid packages for Angolan rebels being considered by
Congress.
Meanwhile, the Administration was reported yesterday to have
given "private assurances" to House Rules Committee Chairman
Claude Pepper (D-Fla.) that it will back the bill he is co-sponsoring
with Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N. Y.) to provide $27 million in non-lethal aid
to UNITA, led by Jonas Savimbi.
Subcommittee Chairman Howard Wolpe (D-Mich.) said he
strongly opposes U.S. intervention of any kind, saying, "There is
probably no better way to play into the hands of the Soviets and
Cubans."
Wolpe predicted that U.S. aid to UNITA would increase Angolan
government dependence on Cuba and the Soviet Union, allow the
Soviets to discredit the United States in black Africa as an ally of
white-ruled South Africa, and lead to U.S. aid to Savimbi, whom he
described as an "avowed Marxist" and a "Maoist."
Bridge May Link U.K. to France
LONDON —After 183 years and numerous false starts, the idea
of constructing a fixed link across the English Channel between Brit
ain and France moved a step toward reality yesterday as seven or
ganizations submitted formal proposals on the project.
The British and French governments have said they would study
the proposals for three months before reaching a decision on how to
proceed.
The proposals include a variety of combinations of highway, rail
way, tunnel and bridge to span the channel from a point near Dover
on the British side to a point near the French port of Calais, a dis
tance of 22 miles. Cost projections range from $3 billion to $8 billion.
If a go-ahead is given, the so called "chunnel" project could be
by the early 19905, according to timetables submitted
with the bids.
Aquino May Lead Filipino Party
MANILA, Philippines — With preparations now under way for a
scheduled May 1987 presidential election in the Philippines, a move
ment appears to be gathering steam to draft the widow of assas
sinated opposition leader Benigno Aquino to head a united opposition
ticket against President Ferdinand Marcos.
According to Philippine opposition figures, Corazon Aquino, 52, is
emerging as the most likely prospect for unifying the deeply divided
foes of Marcos, 68, who has ruled the country for 20 years.
The search for a single challenger to Marcos comes at one of the
most turbulent periods in the history of the former U.S. colony.
Mired in its worst economic crisis since World War 11, the country
faces a growing Communist insurgency in the provinces and rising
leftist agitation in the cities. Home to the two largest U.S. military
bases abroad, the situation also has stirred deep concern in the
Reagan Administration.
Secret West Bank Deal Alleged
JERUSALEM — Leaders of a right-wing Israeli political party
charged yesterday that Prime Minister Shimon Peres has offered
Jordan's King Hussein a secret agreement under which the two na
tions would share power on the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Peres dismissed the charge as "nonsense based on pure inven
tion." Nonetheless, there were signs that Israel and Jordan, whether
by secret agreement or otherwise, were taking halting steps toward
greater cooperation on the West Bank.
Energy Minister Moshe Shahal confirmed that the government is
weighing the political and economic ramifications of a proposal under
which Jordan would supply electricity to the West Bank.
In another development, informed Palestinian sources said that
Jordan has approved the appointment of a prominent Palestinian
businessman to replace an Israeli military officer as mayor of Nablus,
the West Bank's largest city.

Wolpe predicted that U.S. aid to UNITA would increase Angolan
government dependence on Cuba and the Soviet Union, allow the
Soviets to discredit the United States in black Africa as an ally of
white-ruled South Africa, and lead to U.S. aid to Savimbi, whom he
described as an "avowed Marxist" and a "Maoist."
Bridge May Link U.K. to France
LONDON —After 183 years and numerous false starts, the idea
of constructing a fixed link across the English Channel between Brit
ain and France moved a step toward reality yesterday as seven or
ganizations submitted formal proposals on the project.
The British and French governments have said they would study
the proposals for three months before reaching a decision on how to
proceed.
The proposals include a variety of combinations of highway, rail
way, tunnel and bridge to span the channel from a point near Dover
on the British side to a point near the French port of Calais, a dis
tance of 22 miles. Cost projections range from $3 billion to $8 billion.
If a go-ahead is given, the so called "chunnel" project could be
by the early 19905, according to timetables submitted
with the bids.
Aquino May Lead Filipino Party
MANILA, Philippines — With preparations now under way for a
scheduled May 1987 presidential election in the Philippines, a move
ment appears to be gathering steam to draft the widow of assas
sinated opposition leader Benigno Aquino to head a united opposition
ticket against President Ferdinand Marcos.
According to Philippine opposition figures, Corazon Aquino, 52, is
emerging as the most likely prospect for unifying the deeply divided
foes of Marcos, 68, who has ruled the country for 20 years.
The search for a single challenger to Marcos comes at one of the
most turbulent periods in the history of the former U.S. colony.
Mired in its worst economic crisis since World War 11, the country
faces a growing Communist insurgency in the provinces and rising
leftist agitation in the cities. Home to the two largest U.S. military
bases abroad, the situation also has stirred deep concern in the
Reagan Administration.
Secret West Bank Deal Alleged
JERUSALEM — Leaders of a right-wing Israeli political party
charged yesterday that Prime Minister Shimon Peres has offered
Jordan's King Hussein a secret agreement under which the two na
tions would share power on the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Peres dismissed the charge as "nonsense based on pure inven
tion." Nonetheless, there were signs that Israel and Jordan, whether
by secret agreement or otherwise, were taking halting steps toward
greater cooperation on the West Bank.
Energy Minister Moshe Shahal confirmed that the government is
weighing the political and economic ramifications of a proposal under
which Jordan would supply electricity to the West Bank.
In another development, informed Palestinian sources said that
Jordan has approved the appointment of a prominent Palestinian
businessman to replace an Israeli military officer as mayor of Nablus,
the West Bank's largest city.
Spy Swap May Include Sakharov
BONN, West Germany — The United States, the Soviet Union
and East and West Germany may be planning a major East-West spy
swap in conjunction with the Geneva, Switzerland, summit meeting,
a West German newspaper reported last night.
The swap also would include the release by the Soviets of dissi
dents Andrei Sakharov and Anatoly Shcharansky, according to the
Bild, a Hamburg newspaper. Bild attributed its information to
diplomatic sources in Washington and Bonn, who were quoted as
sayjng that the possible swap would take place after President
Reagan meets with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev Nov. 19-20.
"The success of the operation will only be ensured if the summit
meeting goes well," the newspaper said. "Gorbachev then wants to
send a signal."
Bild said that, under the proposed arrangement, the United States
and West Germany would free several jailed Soviet and East German
spies in exchange for about the same number of Western agents who
have been imprisoned in the Soviet Union and East Germany.
Hussein Warns PLO on Terror
AMMAN, Jordan — While Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization agreed during talks earlier this week to push ahead with
their joint Mideast peace initiative, King Hussein warned PLO Chair
man Yasser Arafat that their relations would end if there was another
terrorist incident such as the hijacking of the Italian cruise liner Ac
hille Lauro, Jordanian officials said yesterday.
"They didn't sign anything, but it is clear that the PLO is operating
under new ground rules" from the Jordanians, one diplomat said.
In addition to the Achille Lauro affair, King Hussein, who met
Arafat Monday night, was upset with the PLO over the murder of
three Israelis in Larnaca, Cyprus, in late September and the collapse
two weeks ago of a planned meeting in London between British offi
cials and two senior PLO aides.
While Arafat was not asked to make any written promises, one
Jordanian official said that "it was implicit that the PLO would stop all
violence outside the occupied territories." The PLO maintains that
violence in Israeli-occupied lands is justifiable resistance against il
legal oppression.
CIA Presses for Aid to UNITA
WASHINGTON — The Defense Department and Central Intelli
gence Agency are urging the White House to approve — before the
U.S.-Soviet summit — a large covert military operation to aid rebels
fighting the Marxist Angolan government, congressional and intelli
gence sources said yesterday.
One source said the money proposed is in the range of "two to
three hundred million dollars," a figure eight to 10 times higher than
any proposed aid packages for Angolan rebels being considered by
Congress.
Meanwhile, the Administration was reported yesterday to have
given "private assurances" to House Rules Committee Chairman
Claude Pepper (D-Fla.) that it will back the bill he is co-sponsoring
with Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N. Y.) to provide $27 million in non-lethal aid
to UNITA, led by Jonas Savimbi.
Subcommittee Chairman Howard Wolpe (D-Mich.) said he
strongly opposes U.S. intervention of any kind, saying, "There is
probably no better way to play into the hands of the Soviets and
Cubans."
Wolpe predicted that U.S. aid to UNITA would increase Angolan
government dependence on Cuba and the Soviet Union, allow the
Soviets to discredit the United States in black Africa as an ally of
white-ruled South Africa, and lead to U.S. aid to Savimbi, whom he
