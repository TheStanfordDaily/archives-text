# U.S. To Offer Arms Reductions
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” President Reagan an
nounced yesterday that U.S. negotiators in
Geneva, building on "positive elements" in a
recent Soviet proposal, would unveil a compre
hensive new counterproposal today that would
accept the principle of deep cuts in nuclear weap
ons while reducing the first-strike threat posed
by huge land-based missiles.
But the Administration's new plan would also
permit research to go forward on "Star Wars,"
the space-based anti-missile system that Mos
cow has portrayed as the greatest stumbling
block to a new arms control agreement.
In a letter transmitted to Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, Reagan asked that the current round
of arms control talks in Geneva, scheduled to
end today, be extended for a week to allow "a
real give and take" on his proposal. He called the

latest U.S. offer, together with the Soviet plan,
"important milestones" in the arduous arms
control process.
The Soviet plan, presented last month by
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, asked
for a 50 percent across-the-board reduction in
strategic arms. The U.S. plan, while incorporat
ing the overall 50 percent cut, would reportedly
set separate varying limits on different
categories of weapons systems to curtail the
Soviets' vast fleet of land-based intercontinental
ballistic missiles.
These highly accurate missiles, whose high
speed permits only a brief warning time after
they are launched, are considered by U.S. ex
perts to pose a greater first-strike threat than
air-launched and submarine-launched missiles,
which are slower and less accurate.
A Pentagon official said the new American

proposal "takes the 50 percent concept" ad
vanced by the Soviets "and translates it into
something more equitable."
Reagan, as his Nov. 19-20 summit meeting
with Gorbachev in Geneva draws closer, has
been under mounting pressure from the allies to
counter the Soviet proposal and prevent Gorba
chev from stealing the arms control spotlight.
In an interview with Soviet journalists yester
day, Reagan expressed hope that there would be
"concrete achievements at Geneva."
Secretary of State George Shultz leaves to
morrow for two days of talks with Gorbachev and
Shevardnadze in Moscow Nov. 4-5. In a news
conference, he said his trip was "part of a con
tinuing and intensive process to prepare the
way" for the summit. Shultz described the new
American proposal as far-reaching and said it
sought drastic cuts in nuclear weapons.
