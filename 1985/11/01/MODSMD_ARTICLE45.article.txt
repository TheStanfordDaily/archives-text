### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
— President Pieter Botha pledged
yesterday to pursue his course of
gradual reform of apartheid despite
election setbacks for his National
Party this week that indicated many
whites feared that he was moving
too fast.
Botha said he would have to
"take cognizance" of the substantial
swing to the right that was evident
in the five parliamentary by
elections Wednesday, but would try
to persuade his critics to follow "the
road of realism and level
headedness" as he continued the
step-by-step reform of South
Africa's apartheid system of racial
separation.
His party lost a seat in the Or

ange Free State for the first time in
more than 30 years and saw its pre
vious victory margins reduced by
half or two-thirds in other con
stituencies.
"Considering the difficult eco
nomic consequences of the reces
sion, the drought conditions ... as
well as the present unrest ... the
government can express its satis
faction with the result," Botha said.
Political commentators, including
National Party supporters, argued
strongly that the lesson of the elec
tions, in which Nationalist candi
dates won four seats but lost one,
was that Botha should not only
proceed with his reform program
but broaden it to win the firm back
ing of other moderates and even

liberals looking for a political home.
The National Party, in their
view, must transform itself, even
more than it has, into the party of
the center, the party of pragmatism
and reform. The National Party
should do this because it has little
hope of recapturing the lost votes
of the far right — and should not
weaken itself by chasing them.
The Johannesburg Afrikaans
language newspaper Die Vaderland
(The Fatherland) commented, for
example, that despite the economic
situation and the unrest, "the
voters have again chosen it (the
Nationalist Party) as the only party
they trust to govern." This, the
newspaper said, was a mandate to
continue on its present reform

course, not to pull back or shift di
rection.
The leaders of the two white
supremacist parties that won un
precedented support in the by
elections declared that the results
would force Botha to slow, if not
abandon entirely, his reform plans,
particularly those for limited power
sharing with the country's black
majority.
Botha, speaking later to foreign
correspondents, reaffirmed his per
sonal and political commitment to
reform. "Let me state very clearly:
There is no one in this country, or
anywhere else, who appreciates
the urgency for reform better than
the members of this government of
South Africa," he declared.
