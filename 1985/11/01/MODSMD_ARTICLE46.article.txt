Trade Deficit Record
WASHINGTON — With imports pouring
into the United States, the trade deficit
reached a record $15.6 billion in September,
the government announced yesterday, as offi
cials worked to avert a trade war with the
European Community.
The United States is threatening to curtail
imports of steel and to impose hefty increases
on the tariff on imported pasta unless new
trade agreements are reached with the
European Community. There is special ur
gency in reaching a compromise because of
fears that the Europeans might strike back by
restricting the entry of Artierrcan
manufactured goods and agricultural products.
The Reagan Administration is engaged in a
two-front campaign, trying to defeat protec
tionist legislation in Congress, while persuad
ing America's trading partners to stimulate
their own economies in an effort to absorb
some of the imports now flowing into the
United States.
The substantial volume of imports is creat
ing hard times for American manufacturing
companies, thereby slowing the growth of the
U.S. economy. The government's gauge of
future economic performance rose a modest
0.1 percent during September, the Depart
ment of Commerce reported. Business will
keep expanding, but at a restrained pace, ex
perts believe.

Budget Change Urged
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State
George Shultz and Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger urged President Reagan
yesterday to seek changes in a controversial
Republican budget-cutting plan pending in
Congress that might force spending cuts in
most government programs, including defense
and foreign aid, according to an Administration
source.
In a memo to Reagan, the two Cabinet offi
cers warned that the budget-cutting proposal
"would force damaging reductions in defense,
foreign assistance and counterterrorism" ac
tivities, the source said. •
The plan is tied to a measure that would give
the cash-strapped government new borrowing
power. But, as the source acknowledged, the
legislation may be too close to passage for
Reagan to press for significant revisions.
Final action on the so-called Gramm-
Rudman bill could come as soon as today.
Delta Crash Studied
IRVING, Texas — The atmosphere in the
hearing room where federal investigators are
examining possible causes of the Delta Flight
191 crash resembled that of a court room yes
terday, as witnesses discussed possible pilot

error in the moments before the crash.
Much of the testimony centered on nuances
of interpretation of technical data from the digi
tal voice recorder — the so-called black box —
on the L-1011 Tristar jet, which crashed at
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport Aug.
2, claiming 137 lives.
Richard Bray, an aerospace engineer with
the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration, said his preliminary analysis of the data
showed only one clear attempt to pull the nose
up and fly out of the rapid descent.
His testimony was hotly disputed by Delta
officials, who maintained that the data exhib
ited three clear attempts to pull out of the des
cent.
Yesterday's testimony before the National
Transportation Safety Board was the first to
touch on the highly sensitive issue of whether
the pilots correctly responded to the weather
conditions once they had encountered a violent
wind shear on their final approach to the run
way.
Market Ends Mixed
NEW YORK — The stock market settled
for a mixed showing yesterday as the rally of
the past several sessions bogged down.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which closed Wednesday at a new high, slipped
back 1.26 to 1,374.31.
