Jury Convicts Hooker
REDWOOD CITY — Cameron Hooker,
who admitted kidnapping a young hitchhiker,
was convicted yesterday of abducting his vic
tim and holding her in bondage for seven years
as a sex slave.
Hooker, clad in a gray tweed coat, appeared
stoic as his fate was announced. Judge
Clarence Knight set bail at $5 million and sen
tencing for Nov. 22.
The former mill worker faces up to 75 years
in prison.
Knight told the panel he agreed with the
verdict, then raked key defense witness
Donald Lunde, a Stanford psychiatry professor
who testified the only credible reason the
woman did not leave Hooker was because "she
fell in love with the fellow."
"I want to commend you for rejecting the
testimony of (Lunde)," Knight said. "Witnesses
like that are a real menace to the criminal
justice system."
Alien Rights Upheld
SACRAMENTO — In a far-reaching deci
sion, the state farm labor board said yesterday
that a 1984 U.S. Supreme Court ruling does
not limit the panel's authority to force growers

to rehire and give back pay to illegal aliens.
The Agricultural Labor Relations Board, in a
3-2 decision, ruled that its "remedial order of
reinstatement and back pay poses no actual
conflict with an Immigration and Naturalization
Act law or regulation."
One board member, noting the high number
of illegals who reportedly work on California
farms, said prior to the decision that a ruling
applying the high court's conclusions would
have a "chilling effect on farm workers' abili
ties to exercise their rights."
A grower's attorney predicted earlier that
the ALRB's ruling would be appealed to the
Supreme Court, no matter which way the
ruling went.
The ALRB case involved the firing of three
farm workers by a Napa grape grower, Rigi
Agricultural Services Inc., supposedly because
the workers were illegal aliens.
S. Clara Quarantined
SAN JOSE — State officials approved a 64-
square-mile quarantine yesterday to assist
Santa Clara County agriculturalists fighting the
Oriental fruit fly in the "biggest bug battle
since the Medfly."
The fast-breeding fly, which can destroy
more than 300 varieties of fruit, was first dis-

covered three weeks ago in east Sunnyvale,
seven miles from Palo Alto. Since then, 30
flies have been found in cardboard traps set by
state and county agriculture officials.
"This is probably the biggest insect battle
we've had since the Medfly," said Greg Van
Wassenhove, the county's agriculture commis
sioner, recalling the two-year $96 million at
tack in much of the state on the voracious
Mediterranean fruit fly that concluded in July,
1982.
The quarantine by the state Office of Admin
istrative Law in Sacramento prohibits resi
dents from taking backyard fruit outside of
boundaries that include most of Sunnyvale,
Cupertino and San Jose, and parts of Santa
Clara, Mountain View and Campbell.
Monroe Death Probe
LOS ANGELES — Former Coroner Dr.
Thomas Noguchi, who performed the autopsy
on Marilyn Monroe said yesterday he feels a
new investigation into the actress' 1962 death
should be conducted to study fresh evidence.
"Additional information has been presented.
The picture of the puzzle is now more com
plete," Noguchi said.
Current District Attorney Ira Reiner has
said he will not reopen the case.
