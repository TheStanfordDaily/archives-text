# Making a List, Checking It Twice
## Congress wants the IRS to audit financial aid claims 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
In an effort to crack down on students who fal
sify family income data to gain federal student
loans, the White House is expected to propose
legislation soon that would allow federal agencies
to verify income statements with the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS).

Education Watch

According to Office of Management and
Budget spokesman Steve Tupper, the govern
ment could save "hundreds of millions of dollars"
by keeping ineligible people from receiving stu
dent loans and other forms of federal aid.
Tupper called the legislation a "logical exten
sion" of the 1984 Deficit Reduction Act, which
authorized government agencies to use IRS data
to verify applications for four state-administered,
federally funded programs: food stamps, un
employment insurance, Aid to Families with De
pendent Children and Medicaid.
The legislation, which may go to Congress as
early as next month, would extend that authori
zation to 12 other programs, including Pell
Grants, Guaranteed Student Loans, Veterans
Administration pensions and Housing and Urban

Development loans.
The legislation would allow federal agencies to
verify income statements against IRS, state un
employment, Social Security Administration,
federal wage and pension, veterans' pension
and railroad retirement fund files. Files would
also be checked to ensure that aid recipients are
not illegal aliens.
Tupper said the legislation is aimed at people
who knowingly falsify data, and at those who do
so unintentionally.
"The welfare population is a very dynamic
population. Their situation is not static," he said.
"People on welfare get divorces, they get a little
money in gifts, they are in and out of employ
ment. It's very easy to overlook (sources of
income)." -•
The proposed legislation has come under fire
from some who say it would violate the privacy
of federal aid applicants, and others who say it
would encourage dishonest applicants to stop
filing income tax forms to avoid discovery.
Tupper said, "A lot of strange things happen
out there, and to predict what somebody will do
is pretty difficult."
But he said he doubts the legislation would
cause the problems its opponents charge it
would.

"I find it hard to believe that a family who
wants Johnny to get a loan to go to college won't
file an income tax (form)," Tupper said.
These threats are not new in the field of col
lege financing.
Education Secretary William Bennett said this
summer that his department is asking the IRS to
withhold tax refunds for 1 million defaulters on
federal student loans unless they start paying
their debts.
Another 1 million borrowers will get notices
from state agencies warning that they will be
denied federal tax refunds next year unless they
make good on their debts. The states are acting
on loans made by state agencies and insured by
the federal government
Stanford loaned students $7.5 million under
the Federal Guaranteed Student Loan and $3.6
million under the National Direct Student Loan
programs during the 1984-85 school year, ac
cording to Roberta Johnson, associate director of
financial aid at Stanford.
The University has only about a 3 percent
default rate on the NDSL program, "one of the
smallest in the nation," Johnson said. And, in the
GSL program, which state officials help monitor,
Johnson said she had been told that Stanford had
"one of the lowest default rates in the state."
