# Change Possible for New Varsity
## 
### WILLIAM PENNEY Staff writer 
The recent sale of the building occupied by the
New Varsity Theatre could bring a change in the en
tertainment offered there, but not until the theater's
lease expires in 1989.
With a restaurant and bar frequented by Stanford
students, the New Varsity shows first-run and clas
sic movies. "They do fun things, off-beat, city-like
things," said Glen Lagerstrom, an Adams House
resident assistant.
The new owners, Charles Keenan and Mark
Gates of Palo Alto Theatre Corp., bought the build
ings currently occupied by the New Varsity,
Aquarius and Bijou theatres from Howard Naify and
Edgar Sutro Oct. 11.
Keenan said he has no definite plans for the New
Varsity building when the current lease expires. "I
can't think that far ahead; that's four years from
now, " he said.
Asked to speculate on the future of the building as
a theater, Keenan said, "If there's a movie industry
at that time, maybe we'll have something." Noting
that a 12-screen movie complex will open later this
month at the old Moffett Field drive-in site, Keenan
said, "There's a great deal of efficiency in a 12-plex
(theater) that these old single-screen places just
don't have."

Jude Lutge, who has owned the New Varsity for
the past 11 years, told the Palo Alto Weekly that she
attempted to buy the building from Sutro.
"I wanted to buy it because it's my life," she said.
"1 begged him to let me buy just the New Varsity,
and he agreed.
"I raised the money in four days, and when I got
back to Sutro he said, 'You took too long,' that he
would be selling to Keenan," Lutge said.
Neither Sutro nor Naify could be reached for
comment.
Lutge, who was also unavailable for comment,
told the Weekly that she "can't put any money" into
the New Varsity.
"What I have to do is live out my four years, and
that's the end of the Varsity, at least as we know it,"
Lutge said. "I can't see myself organizing a 'save the
Varsity' campaign now, but maybe when I'm less
tired, I'll get right back out there."
Stanford students who have been to the New
Varsity seem to like it in its present form.
"The New Varsity is essential to the well-being of
Palo Alto," said sophomore Ashley Knief.
Junior Carmen Richardson agreed, saying, "They
show good, classic movies at cheap prices."
"Punks, I like punks, they're cool," said sopho
more Brian Wilson, referring to the punk rockers
who often frequent the theatre and nearby
sidewalks.
