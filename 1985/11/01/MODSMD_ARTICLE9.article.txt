Israel must share control of its territory with
Palestinians if it is to avoid becoming a "minor South
Africa, Israeli national Meir Merhav said yesterday
during a speech at the Bechtel International Center.
Calling his recommendation a "simple proposi
tion, "Meir said Israel must negotiate with the PLO
if it wants to establish peace.
Merhav, an outspoken advocate of negotiations
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organi
zation (PLO), is currently the economic editor of
The Jerusalem Post.
Although he has been accused of taking sides with
terrorists, Merhav said he feels he is acting in the in
terest of his country.
I believe that I'm taking this position from a
strictly Israeli point of view," he said. His proposi
tion is the most practical solution to a problem he
feels has wide-ranging impUcations, he said.
The Middle East has amassed the largest arsenal
of arms in the world, according to Merhav. In addi
tion to the abundance of conventional weapons, the
capability to produce nuclear weapons in the Middle
East could drag the two superpowers into a global
war, he said.
"Here is where I am beginning to shiver not only
as an Israeli, but I am beginning to shiver as a citizen
of the world," he said.
On a smaller scale, the conflict has specific impli
cations for the Middle East, according to Merhav.
"The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is at the core of
the overall Israeli-Arab conflict," he said. Without
settling this, there is no way to avoid future conflict,
he said.
At the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is
the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank.
Merhav said that Israel originally entered Gaza and
the West Bank to use them as bargaining chips, but
that now the Israeli government is less willing to
give up the areas because peace has become more
remote.
Merhav also said a rise in a "messianic" view that

"took the Bible as the title deed to Gaza and the
West Bank" has created a powerful tide of public
opinion that is an obstacle to peace.
Israel is "blind and indifferent" to the Palestinian
refugees living in these areas, said Merhav.
Israel will cease to be a democratic state if it con
tinues to subjugate Palestinians and deny them poli
tical rights, Merhav said.
"No state can deny rights to 40 percent of its pop
ulation and remain democratic," he said.
Merhav said that because it would be impractical
to offer Palestinians Israeli citizenship, and the PLO
would not accept it anyway, there is only one
remaining solution.
"If there are two nations laying claim to one
(nation) in the same land, then the only solution is to
share the territory," he said.
Merhav ended with an expression of his belief in
Israel's basic sense of humanity, which he claims the
state's current policies contradict.
"I don't think that we are built to play the role of
oppressor," he said.
