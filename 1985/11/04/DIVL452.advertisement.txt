GRADUATE OPPORTUNITIES
The National Consortium for Graduate Degrees for
Minorities in Engineering, Inc. (the GEM Program) is
now in its tenth year of operation. Once again, GEM is
seeking qualified minority students to enter the program.
Designed for members of American ethnic groups that
are under-represented in engineering, the program's goal
is to increase the pool of Black-American, American-
Indian, Mexican-American, and Puerto Rican students
who receive engineering master's degrees.
This past spring, GEM selected 130 new fellowship
recipients for support in graduate studies in engineering
and for summer employment with one of GEM's 54
member employers around the country. Currently, some
240 GEM fellows are in master's programs at one of
GEM's 48 member universities. Several GEM graduates
have continued on for the PhD with support from one of
these schools. Over 326 minority graduate students have
received their master's degrees in engineering since
GEM's founding in 1976.
In 1985 ninety-eight GEM fellows graduated with
over one hundred expected to graduate in 1986.
Stanford University School of Engineering has
graduated forty-one GEM fellows and currently has
eighteen minority graduate students participating in the
program.
GEM fellowships provide tuition, a $5,000 annual
stipend, and salary from a summer internship. Applica
tions must be received by December 1, 1985. For infor
mation and application forms, write to:
