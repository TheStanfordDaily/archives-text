# Test-tube Baby Pilot Program Conceived Here
## 
### ALLISON HARTWELL Editorial staff 
A new in-vitro fertilization program at a Stanford
University clinic may produce its first test-tube baby
within the next 10 months, according to the director of
the program.
The clinic will begin admitting patients to the pro
gram this month and will start treatment on Dec. 1 ac
cording to Dr. Emmet Lamb, director of the
reproductive endocrinology and infertility service of
Stanford's Dept. of Gynecology and Obstetrics.
The clinic's in-vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure will
be the first of its kind in the United States to use only
local anesthesia. The operation used to extract the
eggs from the ovaries, called a laparoscopy, involves
inserting a needle through the belly button and is
usually performed under general anesthesia, Lamb
said.
The use of local anesthesia is "much safer," and al
though a laparoscopy is rarely fatal, the risks are "not
negligible," Lamb said.
Lamb said he expects to have 10-15 patients in the
first group to participate in the program.
Dr. Frank Polanksy, a specialist in endocrinology
and infertility and a member of the clinic's IVF team,
said 100 patients may undergo treatment within the
next year. The clinic needs to perform more than 60
treatments to make the program cost effective, he
added.
Infants conceived through in-vitro fertilization (IVF)
are often referred to as test-tube babies because the
procedure involves removing eggs from the ovaries,
fertilizing them with sperm in a plastic dish and implant
ing them into the womb. IVF is necessary for women
who are unable to conceive due to problems including
fallopian tube damage and endometriosis â€” abnormal
uterine growths.
The clinic's approach "emphasizes the safety factor"
and will soon become "widely applicable," Lamb said.
The clinic holds several discussion sessions to inform
patients of the risks and possible benefits.
Although only 10 percent of the patients undergoing
IVF can expect to have a child, that figure represents a
significant improvement over the two percent chance
the average infertile woman has of becoming pregnant.
The percentage of successful pregnancies by the
IVF procedure has been exaggerated by the media, ac
cording to Polansky.
"The 10 percent is a very firm number in predicting
the chance of taking a baby home," Polansky added.
The birth of the world's first test-tube baby in Eng
land in 1978 prompted the clinic's physicians to start an
IVF program, but they decided to delay the program
because they lacked adequate staff, Lamb said.
"We decided to let the pioneering (work) be done by
well-staffed places," Lamb said.
The clinic now has a team working in the IVF pro
gram, including Lamb; Polansky; Dr. Amin Milki, a
reproductive endrocrinology and infertility specialist;
Dr. Tsai-feng Wu, laboratory manager; Eve Shen,
gamete biologist; Kathy Turner, nurse coordinator;
and Jill Held, a social worker in Palo Alto.
The procedure costs $5,000 per attempted preg
nancy, although the cost is partially refundable if no
eggs are harvested or if the eggs are not fertilized,
Polansky said.
After the fertilized egg is re-implanted into the
uterus, "there is really not much to be done but wait,"
he added.
Although the new IVF treatment will potentially help
many patients to conceive, Lamb stressed that the
clinic is "an infertility clinic." "The IVF treatment is
just one of the options" open to infertile women, he
said.
