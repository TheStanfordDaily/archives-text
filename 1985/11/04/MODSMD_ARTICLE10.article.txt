# AT&T Grants Support Science

Four Stanford students are among 26 doctoral candi
dates in science and engineering who recently received
full four-year scholarships and stipends from the
AT&T Foundation.
The scholarships are an effort by the foundation to
maintain strong science and engineering programs at
our universities," Ronald Levy, president of AT&T
Foundation, told University News Service. The foun
dation is the main philanthropic agency of AT&T and
its subsidiaries.
Only through a cooperative effort between
academia and industry can we ensure that bright young
minds have an opportunity to explore scientific fron
tiers and thereby secure the nation's technological
leadership," Levy said.
One Stanford winner, Frandics Chan, majored in
electrical engineering at UC-Berkeley, compiling a 4.0
grade point average. While at Berkeley, he completed
one year of research into the fabrication process of
silicon chips and spent one year designing hardware for
a radar exploration group concerned with the radar
mapping of planets.
Chan also won the Electrical Engineering Depart
ment's citation at Berkeley and was named a university
medalist.
Chan said he was happy to win the AT&T-Bell Labo
ratories scholarship because it meant that he could af
ford to attend Stanford. Chan plans to go into
bioelectronics. Without the scholarship, Chan would

have continued at Berkeley and gone into another field,
he said.
Andrew Golding, in the Computer Science Depart
ment, is another recipient. Golding did his undergradu
ate work at Princeton and went to Edinburgh, Scot
land, on a Marshall Scholarship, where he completed a
master of philosophy degree.
Golding's current project deals with learning by anal
ogy: solving problems by relating them to other, previ
ously solved problems. In the future, Golding plans to
do "research in industry or academia," he said.
Golding said he feels "really happy about (the schol
arship). It's nice because it gives me a source of fund
ing."
A third recipient, Harold Kenner, is in the Depart
ment of Materials Science.
"I didn't expect to win it," Kenner said, adding that it
was a "very nice surprise."
Kenner is currently working with semi-conductor
processing related to the SUPREM computer pro
gram. He said he plans to do research and develop
ment in an industrial setting and before going into
teaching.
The fourth Stanford recipient of the doctoral scholar
ship is Rex Wright from the Department of Applied
Physics. Wright is working on an acoustics microscope,
a scaled-down version of the sonar technique scientists
can use to scan the ocean floor. With the microscope,
scientists can focus on things as small as bacteria, he
said.
Wright said the scholarship "was nice, it was
money." He "went out and bought a windsurfer" with
the stipend, he said.
