# Students Reach Out to Community
## 
### MARY McDEVITT Staff writer 
On a clear and sunny Saturday
blessed with some of the best
beach weather in November his
tory, more than 370 students
stayed clear of the sand and in
stead donated their time to fight
boredom, loneliness and hunger.
As part of the third "Reach Out
Today" program, student volun
teers safeguarded childrens'
playgrounds and entertained the
elderly with Halloween costumes
and talent shows in 25 separate
community service projects.
"We're trying to expose as
many students as possible to
community service organizations
in a way that is fun for them, but
that will also offer them a sense of
the needs of the surrounding
community," said Rhonda Trot
ter, coordinator of the Stanford
Volunteer Network, which organ
ized the event.
Community service represen
tatives, one for each dormitory,
linked the network with student
groups and enlisted student par

ticipation.
"We hope that people will go
back and establish some sort of
ongoing activities with the organi
zations," said Project Director
Nina Teicholz.
Trotter and Teicholz hope that
"Reach Out Today" will encour
age each dormitory to "adopt an
agency" and continue regular in
teraction between dormitory resi
dents and a community agency.
At the Community Association
for the Retarded (CAR) in Palo
Alto, students sanded, wood
sealed and secured safety bolts
on a therapeutic playground
which "the children could have
been injured on," according to
CAR worker Margaret Hauck.
CAR employs a small number
of people for maintenance, and
clean-up work would not have
been done without the students'
help, Hauck said.
"Believe me, I don't know what
we did before the 'Reach Out'
days. They're always winterizing
us or getting us ready for
spring. . . . It's fabulous."
In East Palo Alto, students or
ganized field games and cooked

hot dogs for more than 100 local
children in conjunction with the
Ecumenical Hunger Program.
Senior Deep Singh worked
with EHP this summer and knows
many of the children in the area.
"Kids are very bored, and they
don't get out much," he said. "I
think it is really good for them to
get out, even if it's just to the
park."
East Palo Alto resident Andrea
Villalobos said that the park picnic
was a "special" outing for her two
children. On a typical afternoon
"they would probably be sitting at
home locked up or maybe just
with the parents or family mem
bers. This is a treat for them,"
she said.
Other students cleaned appli
ances at an apartment complex in
East Palo Alto. When the stu
dents began scrubbing the ovens
"which haven't been cleaned in 10
years," according to EHP direc
tor Nevida Butler, "the (resident)
kids wanted to start helping."
While residents and members
of the EHP appreciated the stu
dents' efforts, the students also
enjoyed the project.
