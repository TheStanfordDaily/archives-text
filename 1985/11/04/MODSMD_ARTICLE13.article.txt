## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper USW's Mixed Results 
### 
The decision by the United Stanford Workers
(USW) to accept the University's final contract un
der protest may be a mixed blessing — while it is
obvious that workers gained immediate benefits,
the long-term effect of the new contract on Local
680 remains a mystery.
In monetary terms, the contract package includes
wage hikes for bargaining unit members of at least
16 percent over a three-year period.
But more dollars aside, many of the union's
demands were not answered. During the contract
bargaining, USW increased its membership by about
200. How many bargaining unit members USW will
have three years from now is open to debate, but
will depend on how the University chooses to inter
pret the conditions to which both parties, however
reluctantly, have agreed.
USW officials have already said the union will
deliberately violate the provisions on the
access of union representatives to the workplace.
Under one provision of the access clause, on-the-job
meetings between workers and union stewards
must he limited to 10 minutes. Before the Strike

vote, University chief negotiator Priscilla Wheeler
said the 10-minute limit was "flexible" and subject to
"mutual agreement." But how flexible is "flexible?"
Then there is paragraph 94, the so-called "job se
curity" clause. In an open letter on Tuesday, William
Massy, vice president for Business and Finance,
said Stanford is not "plotting to lay off union workers
and replace them with temporary employees." But
what constitutes a "plot?"
Statements by Wheeler, Massy and other Univer
sity officials are important, but they are
interpretations that, unlike the contract, may change
over the next few years.
Reducing job security and restricting union repre
sentatives from the workplace may not be overrid
ing concerns right now, but neither do they bode
well for USW's future. To accept a contract "under
protest," union members had better keep doing just
that — protesting what they believe to be unjust. If
they let up — or if the community stops watching
and listening — the interpretations may suddenly
become very different indeed.
