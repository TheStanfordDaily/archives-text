# Sex and the Modern Astronaut
## 
### 
The news came from researchers at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) just a
few months ago. Test pilots chuckled to themselves,
Carl Sagan, no doubt, loosened the collar of his
turtleneck sweater, and Dr. Ruth smiled with devilish
anticipation. Yes, it was definite: NASA had decided
that, within the next 10 years, sexual relations in outer
space would be "inevitable," and its research team has
embarked on plans to accommodate those relationships
in future spacecraft.

• If you- think "about it, it really was just a matter of
time'befdrfe 'NASA began promoting the idea of sexual
intimacy in space. Way back in 1975, the Apollo/Soyuz
mission set the stage for the first extra-terrestrial cul
tural exchange. Since then, NASA has spawned all
sorts of unions in space — many of which would never
have occurred down here on earth. Now they're going
back to basics.
According to NASA officials, the talk of "intimate be
havior" in space began this year when NASA and the
Ames Research Center in California commenced plans
to construct a manned space station sometime in the
early 19905. Currently their designs depict a T-shaped
metal frame topped with solar panels and budding with
40-foot cylindrical modules intended as "temporary
housing."
NASA's goal is to create a site for healthy, produc
tive space exploration where six to eight specialists can
work together in space for three-month shifts. In an ef
fort to create a livable work environment, NASA en
gineers have been studying wall colors, music systems
and exotic cuisines. Yet some experts predict that,
after three months, our skilled adventurers will be
craving more than Tang and Pillsbury Foodsticks.
As Yvonne Clearwater, leader of NASA's
Habitability Research Group, points out, "It seems ob
vious . . . that a group of normal, healthy professionals
will probably possess normal, healthy sexual appetites.

In space, regardless of crew gender composition, if we
lock people up for 90-day periods, we must plan for the
possibility of intimate behavior."
To determine the feasibility of sex in space, we do
well to consult the experts firsthand. According to
Stewert Barnes, a professor of physics, the first great
physical challenge to future space enthusiasts will be
Newton's Law: For every action, there is an equal and
opposite reaction. "In space," explains Barnes, "with
no weight and little or no friction, obviously, the prob
lem would be with two people pushing against each
other and moving apart. I'd recommend some kind of
restraint. But I'm sure human ingenuity would figure it
out."
While recognizing the "fun" that unearthly acts of
procreation can offer, many members of the non
scientific community might prefer to focus attention on
the moral dilemma such intimate activity produces.
Two months ago, NASA officials hinted at constructing
special quarters for "a significantly related couple."
Already some religious leaders are voicing concern.
Stephen Sapp, assistant professor of religion at the the
University of Miami, puts it this way: "We're looking at
a situation where basically the government is going to
be sanctioning a certain type of behavior that tradition
ally has been immoral. ... If moral principles are valid
on earth, I don't see why they should be any different
in space." Professor Sapp, however, is not naive.
"Obviously," he adds, "these [astronauts] would have
relationships. It wouldn't be as bad as a one night
stand. Then again, what is a one night stand if you're
going around the earth every two hours?"
To me it seems that we spend so much time prepar
ing outer space for war that we might as well put a little
love up there, too. Of course, I can't guarantee NASA
will get it right on the first try. "Oh, geez," said Keith
Nenson, an Arizona engineer who helped found the L 5
Society to promote the colonization of space, "If NASA
gets in charge of sex, everyone will give it up."
With the construction of the space station almost
seven years away, Henson's charge may be a bit
premature, nonetheless hopes (and fears) of sex in
space are now swirling about the minds of future space
pioneers. What will America's future among the stars
be like? Well, I don't think we're just looking at "2001:
A Chaste Odyssey." Then again, it's not exactly "Lust
in Space" either.

Ames Research Center in California commenced plans
to construct a manned space station sometime in the
early 19905. Currently their designs depict a T-shaped
metal frame topped with solar panels and budding with
40-foot cylindrical modules intended as "temporary
housing."
NASA's goal is to create a site for healthy, produc
tive space exploration where six to eight specialists can
work together in space for three-month shifts. In an ef
fort to create a livable work environment, NASA en
gineers have been studying wall colors, music systems
and exotic cuisines. Yet some experts predict that,
after three months, our skilled adventurers will be
craving more than Tang and Pillsbury Foodsticks.
As Yvonne Clearwater, leader of NASA's
Habitability Research Group, points out, "It seems ob
vious . . . that a group of normal, healthy professionals
will probably possess normal, healthy sexual appetites.

In space, regardless of crew gender composition, if we
lock people up for 90-day periods, we must plan for the
possibility of intimate behavior."
To determine the feasibility of sex in space, we do
well to consult the experts firsthand. According to
Stewert Barnes, a professor of physics, the first great
physical challenge to future space enthusiasts will be
Newton's Law: For every action, there is an equal and
opposite reaction. "In space," explains Barnes, "with
no weight and little or no friction, obviously, the prob
lem would be with two people pushing against each
other and moving apart. I'd recommend some kind of
restraint. But I'm sure human ingenuity would figure it
out."
While recognizing the "fun" that unearthly acts of
procreation can offer, many members of the non
scientific community might prefer to focus attention on
the moral dilemma such intimate activity produces.
Two months ago, NASA officials hinted at constructing
special quarters for "a significantly related couple."
Already some religious leaders are voicing concern.
Stephen Sapp, assistant professor of religion at the the
University of Miami, puts it this way: "We're looking at
a situation where basically the government is going to
be sanctioning a certain type of behavior that tradition
ally has been immoral. ... If moral principles are valid
on earth, I don't see why they should be any different
in space." Professor Sapp, however, is not naive.
"Obviously," he adds, "these [astronauts] would have
relationships. It wouldn't be as bad as a one night
stand. Then again, what is a one night stand if you're
going around the earth every two hours?"
To me it seems that we spend so much time prepar
ing outer space for war that we might as well put a little
love up there, too. Of course, I can't guarantee NASA
will get it right on the first try. "Oh, geez," said Keith
Nenson, an Arizona engineer who helped found the L 5
Society to promote the colonization of space, "If NASA
gets in charge of sex, everyone will give it up."
With the construction of the space station almost
seven years away, Henson's charge may be a bit
premature, nonetheless hopes (and fears) of sex in
space are now swirling about the minds of future space
pioneers. What will America's future among the stars
be like? Well, I don't think we're just looking at "2001:
A Chaste Odyssey." Then again, it's not exactly "Lust
in Space" either.
