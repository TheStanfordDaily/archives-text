Indian Mascot
Degrading
Each year as Big Game comes
up, so does the issue of the former
mascot, the "Indian." As far as we
see it, this issue is closed and
should remain so.
Although the Indian mascot was
removed in 1972, the student
population at Stanford officially
voted for its removal as the ath
letic mascot in 1975 and voted
favorably for the "Robber Barons"
as a replacement. The mascot was
changed, not to "Robber Barons"
but to the "Cardinal," which has
been the mascot ever since.
We don't understand the reason
ing of those who persist in trying
to bring back the "Indian." Com
paring professional athletic teams
to the situation at Stanford is not
logical. There is a big difference
between Stanford and privately
owned commercial athletic teams.
Stanford is an academic institution
and has an obligation to its stu
dents and society as a whole to
uphold the concept of "education,"
not small-mindedness. We don't
believe that society has the same
expectations of professional sports
teams. They are simply in the
entertainment business.
As a prestigious institution for
higher learning priding itself on its
liberalism, Stanford should not
perpetuate a stereotype of any
ethnic group that does not wish to
be stereotyped. The intent of
stereotyping any group, good or
bad, is not important because the
effects are essentially all negative.
Historically, the treatment of
native Americans in this country
has included degradation, exploita
tion and the virtual annihilation of
our people and our culture. Don't
romanticize that fact. As native

Americans, we will never forget
that history. It is a part of us.
The Indian as a mascot furthers
the oppression of native
Americans. Once again, it asks us
to surrender our dignity and pride
for the sake of absolving a col
lective guilt that Americans soon
have to recognize.
We suggest that Dan McGanney,
the author of a letter (The Daily,
Oct. 30) lamenting the fact that
Stanford abandoned the Indian
mascot, and his so-called "serious
and concerned" Illinois alumnus,
rather than concerning themselves
with perpetuating a stereotype of
native Americans, direct their
concerns toward more positive and
productive efforts.
Have respect for our dignity. We
are not, nor shall we ever be, your
mascot.

Many Questions
For Kennedy
For the past two or three
months, the United Stanford
Workers (USW) and Stanford Uni
versity were engaged in contract
talks. Letters to this paper were
written by USW workers asking for
University President Donald Ken
nedy to intervene in the negotiat
ing process. Letters from the
faculty were published backing the
union and questioning Kennedy
about the contract talks. Students
observing the negotiation process
decried the administration's posi
tion and asked Kennedy to partici-

pate. Students had letters pub
lished backing the union and,
quoting President Kennedy's own
words, questioning the administra
tion's position. The student gov
ernment issued a joint appeal with
other students and faculty asking
for a public question-and-answer
session so that both sides could
explain their positions to all con
cerned. The editorial board of The
Daily expressed concern over the
progress of the talks and, again
quoting Kennedy, asked for
clarification from the administra
tion. It also requested an open
question-and-answer session so
the students of this university
could understand the points of
contention. One USW member on
the negotiating team even
predicted that the union problem
could cost Kennedy his alleged bid /
for the U. S. Senate.
Finally, on Thursday, the day of
the final strike authorization vote,
the administration and Kennedy
broke their long silence and
responded to the many pleas for
clarification and understanding;
Kennedy denied that he ever in
tended to run for the Senate.
Well, that certainly cleared up
any questions I may have had.
Anybody else out there still
needing more information?

been the mascot ever since.
We don't understand the reason
ing of those who persist in trying
to bring back the "Indian." Com
paring professional athletic teams
to the situation at Stanford is not
logical. There is a big difference
between Stanford and privately
owned commercial athletic teams.
Stanford is an academic institution
and has an obligation to its stu
dents and society as a whole to
uphold the concept of "education,"
not small-mindedness. We don't
believe that society has the same
expectations of professional sports
teams. They are simply in the
entertainment business.
As a prestigious institution for
higher learning priding itself on its
liberalism, Stanford should not
perpetuate a stereotype of any
ethnic group that does not wish to
be stereotyped. The intent of
stereotyping any group, good or
bad, is not important because the
effects are essentially all negative.
Historically, the treatment of
native Americans in this country
has included degradation, exploita
tion and the virtual annihilation of
our people and our culture. Don't
romanticize that fact. As native

Americans, we will never forget
that history. It is a part of us.
The Indian as a mascot furthers
the oppression of native
Americans. Once again, it asks us
to surrender our dignity and pride
for the sake of absolving a col
lective guilt that Americans soon
have to recognize.
We suggest that Dan McGanney,
the author of a letter (The Daily,
Oct. 30) lamenting the fact that
Stanford abandoned the Indian
mascot, and his so-called "serious
and concerned" Illinois alumnus,
rather than concerning themselves
with perpetuating a stereotype of
native Americans, direct their
concerns toward more positive and
productive efforts.
Have respect for our dignity. We
are not, nor shall we ever be, your
mascot.

Many Questions
For Kennedy
For the past two or three
months, the United Stanford
Workers (USW) and Stanford Uni
versity were engaged in contract
talks. Letters to this paper were
written by USW workers asking for
University President Donald Ken
nedy to intervene in the negotiat
ing process. Letters from the
faculty were published backing the
union and questioning Kennedy
about the contract talks. Students
observing the negotiation process
decried the administration's posi
tion and asked Kennedy to partici-

pate. Students had letters pub
lished backing the union and,
quoting President Kennedy's own
words, questioning the administra
tion's position. The student gov
ernment issued a joint appeal with
other students and faculty asking
for a public question-and-answer
session so that both sides could
explain their positions to all con
cerned. The editorial board of The
Daily expressed concern over the
progress of the talks and, again
quoting Kennedy, asked for
clarification from the administra
tion. It also requested an open
question-and-answer session so
the students of this university
could understand the points of
contention. One USW member on
the negotiating team even
predicted that the union problem
could cost Kennedy his alleged bid /
for the U. S. Senate.
Finally, on Thursday, the day of
the final strike authorization vote,
the administration and Kennedy
broke their long silence and
responded to the many pleas for
clarification and understanding;
Kennedy denied that he ever in
tended to run for the Senate.
Well, that certainly cleared up
any questions I may have had.
Anybody else out there still
needing more information?

Kennedy Is a
True Politician
In response to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's letter of
Oct. 31, in which he denies any '
aspirations for higher office, I say:
spoken like a true politician.
