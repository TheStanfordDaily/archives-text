## Compassion Informs Opinion 
### 
This letter is in response to the Viewpoint
(The Daily, Oct. 30) by L. H. Gann, senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution. I would like to thank
Mr. Gann for his insights. I agree that "the per
sonal worth of the disputants" is of little impor
tance in public debate, and I most certainly agree

VIEWPOINT

that personal abuse has no place in the rational
exchange of ideas and the clarification of how and
why people disagree. We should all try much
harder to limit ourselves to the issues at hand
when engaging in public debate.
However, I found one aspect of Mr. Gann's
Viewpoint rather disturbing.
Mr. Gann states that he sees two criteria for
judging personal worth for those who are wont
to do so in public debate. The first he calls the
" 'get-thee-hence, Satan' injunction" where "a
debater's argument is shown to be worthless by
showing that he or she is a racist, a facist, a
sexist. . . The second criteria Mr. Gann calls
"the 'I-have-drunk-from-the-waters-of-affliction'
plaint." Here, a debater considers his argument
superior because his sufferings have produced in
him "a personal catharsis — a special insight."
It worries me that Mr. Gann is so unsympa
thetic to those who "consider themselves super
ior," according to this second criterion. Unfor
tunately, the fact is that most people find it very
difficult to have a developed sense of compassion
without having experienced or witnessed suffer
ing first-hand (or at least having deeply read

about it). In this sense, to have "drunk from the
waters of affliction" could be considered a prere
quisite to analyzing or formulating good, human
foreign or public policy.
What I am talking about is the realization that
suffering — incredible suffering — is going on in
this world right now, as you read this. At this
moment, people are starving needlessly, dying
in meaningless wars and being brutally tortured.
It is this dimension of awareness that those who
invoke Gann's second criterion claim to have.
And I assert that while such an awareness is
definitely only a starting point for developing an

difficult to have a developed sense of compassion with
out having experienced or witnessed suffering first
hand.

informed opinion, it is a necessity if one wishes
to have a viewpoint which includes a concern for
other human beings.
Along with such an awareness of suffering,
comes a sense of urgency, a burning desire to
put an end to the suffering and injustice one sees
in the world. In this light, I would ask Mr. Gann
to take with a grain of salt the impassioned ac
tions, statements and even insults of those who
feel such urgency. The sensitivity of those
highly concerned with human suffering inevitably

causes them to become impatient, even
frustrated, with those who do not seem similarly
inclined.
Such a sense of urgency might also encourage
one to act or to speak before one has really taken
the time to examine all aspects of an issue and
think things through thoroughly. Luckily,
those who have not developed their compas
sion to such a degree are immune to such
temptations to be irrational. On the contrary,
they pride themselves on their objectivity, their
pragmatism, their ability for passionless abstract
thought.

Lastly, it is very easy to identify and discount
uninformed statements or actions of an over
zealous "fighter for peace and humankind." It is
far less easy to cut through the rhetoric and ap
parent logic of a compassionless, though highly
informed, "researcher" or "expert." In light of
this fact, I find the implications of Mr. Gann's
Viewpoint more disturbing than a thousand let
ters of passionate and uninformed "personal
abuse."
