## Cowell Responds to Special Needs of Women Chief physician of the program first thought the idea to be unfairly discriminatory. 
### STACY SIMON 
Since September 1984, Cowell
Student Health Center has been
paying more attention to women.
But the idea for the Women's
Health Care Center didn't appeal to
Dr. Irene Cannon â€” not at first.
"Men need special care, too,"
she said. "They are struggling with
changing roles of women, but if
they appear sensitive, they're
branded as wimps or weak or gay."
Cannon thought a health clinic for
women would discriminate against
men.
But she changed her mind.
After talking to Stanford women,
Cannon realized that "women didn't
feel that they got the care they
wanted."
Although she insisted that "our
male physicians are sensitive,"
Cannon said many women weren't
comfortable with a male doctor, es
pecially when their problems were
gynecological.
"Some women feel more com
fortable with women," Cannon said.
Eight women and one man work
with the Women's Health Care Cen
ter. They specialize in nutrition,
weight management, eating disor
ders, abuse, gynecology, women's
sports medicine, child care, family

planning and health education. Each
week, the physicians and practition
ers meet to discuss patients who
need multi-disciplinary help.
Cannon is the clinic's medical
doctor. One afternoon of her week
at Cowell is reserved for the
Women's Health Care Center.
"I feel I am the same person
giving the same care whether the
patient comes on Monday through
the clinic or on any other day of the

week," Cannon said.
The difference is that Cannon's
patients on Monday afternoon are
given 30-minute appointments in
stead of the usual 20.
The extra time is a "luxury"
made possible by extra funding for
the clinic, said Cannon. Women are
more satisfied with the care they
receive when they have additional
time to discuss their problems.
"In my eyes it has more to do

with the perception in the Stanford
community that we are attuned to
women's needs," she said.
But not every health problem is
appropriate for the clinic. If a
woman has a cold or needs a
routine gynecological examination,
she will see a regular Cowell doc
tor.
"We do not want to have the
world think that our only concerns
are gynecological," said Cannon.

The clinic is for patients who need
to consult with more than one type
of doctor.
This policy includes women who
need pregnancy counseling, who
have stopped getting their periods
or who are anorexic.
The clinic is working on a com
puterized weight-loss program and
a plan to provide birth control pills
wholesale.
Cannon hopes more women will

use the clinic. She said that
graduate women are especially anx
ious about their health, and it inter
feres with their work.
"A lot has to do with not knowing
enough. If they (students) came
earlier, we could educate them
before they became graduates."
Women should take advantage of
the clinic, said Cannon, "because
we're free and because we're
good."
