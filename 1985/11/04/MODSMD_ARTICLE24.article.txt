## Shoales Has a Last Quack as Critic 
### LISA LYNCH Editorial staff 
Over the past few years, followers of National Public Radio's "All Things
Considered" and ABC News' "Nightline" have seen the emergence of a
rather twisted takeoff on the Andy Rooneyesque "Social Critic." His name
is lan Shoales, a dyspeptic, rapid-fire commentator who lists his occupa
tion as "Acerbic Social Critic".
Shoales is the creation of Merle Kessler and his comedy troupe Duck's
Breath Mystery Theatre, five comedians who have been called "America's
answer to Mony Python." The comedians — Kessler, Dan Coffey, Bill Al
lard, Jon Turner and LeonMartell — are also the creators of the infamous
Dr. Science, a parody of a 1950s "ask the expert" radio program, who
answers "science questions" every morning on 130 radio stations
nationwide. They have been together since 1975, when they met as
graduate students in theater at lowa State University.
The social critic got his break on "Nightline" when Ted Koppel, one of
the show's hosts, heard one of Shoales' "essays" on National Public Radio
Since then, Shoales has been a regular guest.
Now Kessler — as Shoales — has assembled a collection of his radio
pieces; the book, entitled "I Gotta Go," is due to be released this month.
The book is a compendium of obnoxious, occasionally hilarious commen
taries on politics, baseball, cocaine, yuppies, fast food and anything else
that could be included in a "Guide To Popular Culture." In a pre
performance interview at the New Varsity Theatre, Kessler talked about
his new book, his old character and his work with Duck's Breath.
Q: How long has the character of lan Shoales been in existence?
A: For four years. I originally wanted to a radio takeoff on a rock critic;
you know, a version of one of those Rolling Stone guys. ... I think
they're funny because they take themselves so seriously. The character
developed from that; I did a few rock critic spots, but there's only so much
you can say.
Q: What gave you the idea to make a collection of the Shoales' pieces?
A: I've always wanted to do a book; I used to write a lot fiction and
thought I'd write a novel, but this is as close to a novel as I can come at this
point in my career.
Q: How much of what Shoales says is what you actually believe?

A: A lot of it is a parody of my own opinions, (and) some of the stuff is
opinions I don't have at all. He's sort of a fantasy self — everytime I think
to my myself, gee, I wish I had the nerve to say something like that, I
realize, wait, I have a character that can say that.
Q: How much do people identify you with lan Shoales? Does anyone
ever attack you for somethng that he's said?
A: People pretty much seem to get the joke. ... I don't get much
negative mail, though I do get weird mail. The most hate mail I got was
when I did a piece on modern art.
Q: Modern art. . .?
A: Y'know, art is dead and all of that.
Q: Is that something you really believe?
A: Well if you consider the literary arts . . . literature is pretty much
dead. Look at the stuff that's being published these days . . . Shirley
MacLaine books, diet books. The audience for writers has really dwindled.
In part, I think it's the fault of writers. Writing has evolved into a real aca
demic thing; there's a lot of cronyism. You meet someone with an accep
table New Yorker style of writing, and you write the way they want you to
write. I think what happens is that writers eventually wind up sharing
themes . . . sharing themes that might not necessarily have to do with
anything.
The state of theater is even worse. At least if you're writing and you've
got something to say, you can print it up yourself, but there's so much in
volved in putting on a play. The stuff that winds up getting produced is just
so predictable. Look at the play "Amadeus" by Peter Schaeffer. God, you
know this play isn't about anything, just look at the poster and you know
what happens. Mediocre people are assholes too . . . and there're a lot of
costumes and music.
Q: You're involved in theater, and you have a master of fine arts (MFA)
in creative writing . . .
A: I went to the lowa Writer's Workshops, and I got an MFA in fiction
writing and an MFA in playwriting. I'm cynical about writing programs in
general, though; lowa seemed to be to be more of a place where you went
to meet agents than to do serious work.
Q: So after you got two writing degrees, you ended up in Duck's
Breath?
A: After I'd just graduated from school, I was working as a bartender,
because I didn't want to teach or do any of the things that you're

"supposed" to do after school. I met up with these guys — they were
pretty much in the same boat as I was — and we decided to do Duck's
Breath for a while. That was 10 years ago.
Q: How much longer do you think you'll go on?
A: God knows. . . . We're starting to change our act now, because we
really had to change. . . . You really can't support yourself just by touring,
