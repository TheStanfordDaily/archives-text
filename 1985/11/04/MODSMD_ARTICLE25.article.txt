# Heaney, Kavanagh and the Joys of Penitence

### JOHNATHAN TREITEL Seamus Heaney 
"Station Island"

Faber and Faber, 1984

Once upon a time, St. Patrick was conduct
ing a ceremony to convert one of the kings of
Ireland and his subjects. Accidentally, the
saint put the sharp tip of his crook through
the king's foot. The king assumed this torture
was somehow part of the process of Chris
tianization and said nothing.
Ever since then, penitential Christianity
and the idea that suffering is good for you has
been deeply rooted in the Irish psyche.
There is an island called St Patrick's Pur
gatory in Lough Derg on the west of Ireland,
where pilgrims gather to undergo a peniten
tial vigil for the benefit of their souls. They
carry out a series of activities in "stations" —
praying, fasting and staying awake — and so
the island is also known as Station Island.
It is not surprising that Station Island itself,
the concrete symbol of the penitential tradi
tion, should have become a subject for
poetry. Indeed, two of the greatest 20th cen
tury Irish poets, Patrick Kavanagh in his 1942
poem "Lough Derg," and Seamus Heaney in

his recent "Station Island," have both written
an account of a pilgrimage there.
Neither of the two men was a genuine
pilgrim. Kavanagh was a Christian, but not of
a penitential tendency. He went as an obser
ver, to try and understand the attractions of
penance. His poem is a fictional narrative
mainly in the third person: a tale of God's in
tervention in the lives of three pilgrims.
Kavanagh took with him a bagful of sand
wiches and a noggin of whiskey — no fasting
for him.
Heaney is not a Christian at all, though he
comes from a Catholic background. He uses
the pilgrimage and the penance as a metaphor
for his own "pilgrimage" to seek out, in a
Dante-esque manner, figures from the past
to guide him and his own "penitential" self
criticism as a poet. The poem is mainly in the
first person; Heaney progresses through the
stations and at each age encounters some
tableau of memory. For instance, Kavanagh
himself appears to Heaney and remarks
rather cynically, "Sure I might have
known/once I had made the pad, you'd be
after me/sooner or later."
Kavanagh defines penance as "God's
delight in disillusionment." Disillusionment is
meant literally: It is removing illusions and so
becoming more clear-sighted. His fictional

characters each arrive on the island with
worldy ambitions and self-importance, but
God strips these away and they leave
purified.
Heaney too, is trying to break through his
own willful detachment. "I repent/The un
weaned life that kept me competent/To
sleepwalk with connivance and mistrust."
Indeed, the main subject of Heaney's poetry

Kavanagh defines pen
ance as 'God's delight in
disillusionment.'

has always been his own poetic vocation. The
crux of Heaney's technique is to write about a
concrete object while at the same time refer
ring to some grand abstraction.
This is the function of the place Station Is
land in the book "Station Island." This is also
his technique in each section of the poem: He
begins with a description of some activity on
the island, which becomes a metaphor, and
then fades into concreteness again at the end

of the poem. For example: "I parked on a
high road listening/To peewits and wind
blowing round the car/when something came
to life in the driving mirror . A charac
ter appears, the ghost of a former pilgrim,
who advises Heaney to "Remember every
thing and keep your head." And finally the
ghost disappears: "He turned his heel while
he was saying this/And headed up the road at
the same hard pace."
This technique is sometimes used too
glibly; for instance, Heaney recalls dipping a
kaleidoscope into a bucket, which causes him
'to re-envisage/The zenith and glimpsed
jewels of any gift/mistakenly abused."
Both Heaney's and Kavanagh's poems are
technically very interesting in the use of nar
rative structure. The story lines are pre
novelistic, almost medieval. Characters ap
pear not as subjective individuals but as rep
resentatives of virtue and vice, warning signs
and emblems. In Heaney's earlier poems, his
characters were permitted personalities that
impassioned them, rather in the style of the
autobiographical poems of Robert Lowell; but
now the characters exist only as guides for
Heaney hmself. By contrast, Kavanagh's
characters exist not in relation to the poet but
to God; so the story illustrates the fate of all
humanity under the sun.

"Station Island"

Faber and Faber, 1984

Once upon a time, St. Patrick was conduct
ing a ceremony to convert one of the kings of
Ireland and his subjects. Accidentally, the
saint put the sharp tip of his crook through
the king's foot. The king assumed this torture
was somehow part of the process of Chris
tianization and said nothing.
Ever since then, penitential Christianity
and the idea that suffering is good for you has
been deeply rooted in the Irish psyche.
There is an island called St Patrick's Pur
gatory in Lough Derg on the west of Ireland,
where pilgrims gather to undergo a peniten
tial vigil for the benefit of their souls. They
carry out a series of activities in "stations" —
praying, fasting and staying awake — and so
the island is also known as Station Island.
It is not surprising that Station Island itself,
the concrete symbol of the penitential tradi
tion, should have become a subject for
poetry. Indeed, two of the greatest 20th cen
tury Irish poets, Patrick Kavanagh in his 1942
poem "Lough Derg," and Seamus Heaney in

his recent "Station Island," have both written
an account of a pilgrimage there.
Neither of the two men was a genuine
pilgrim. Kavanagh was a Christian, but not of
a penitential tendency. He went as an obser
ver, to try and understand the attractions of
penance. His poem is a fictional narrative
mainly in the third person: a tale of God's in
tervention in the lives of three pilgrims.
Kavanagh took with him a bagful of sand
wiches and a noggin of whiskey — no fasting
for him.
Heaney is not a Christian at all, though he
comes from a Catholic background. He uses
the pilgrimage and the penance as a metaphor
for his own "pilgrimage" to seek out, in a
Dante-esque manner, figures from the past
to guide him and his own "penitential" self
criticism as a poet. The poem is mainly in the
first person; Heaney progresses through the
stations and at each age encounters some
tableau of memory. For instance, Kavanagh
himself appears to Heaney and remarks
rather cynically, "Sure I might have
known/once I had made the pad, you'd be
after me/sooner or later."
Kavanagh defines penance as "God's
delight in disillusionment." Disillusionment is
meant literally: It is removing illusions and so
becoming more clear-sighted. His fictional

characters each arrive on the island with
worldy ambitions and self-importance, but
God strips these away and they leave
purified.
Heaney too, is trying to break through his
own willful detachment. "I repent/The un
weaned life that kept me competent/To
sleepwalk with connivance and mistrust."
Indeed, the main subject of Heaney's poetry

Kavanagh defines pen
ance as 'God's delight in
disillusionment.'

has always been his own poetic vocation. The
crux of Heaney's technique is to write about a
concrete object while at the same time refer
ring to some grand abstraction.
This is the function of the place Station Is
land in the book "Station Island." This is also
his technique in each section of the poem: He
begins with a description of some activity on
the island, which becomes a metaphor, and
then fades into concreteness again at the end

of the poem. For example: "I parked on a
high road listening/To peewits and wind
blowing round the car/when something came
to life in the driving mirror . A charac
ter appears, the ghost of a former pilgrim,
who advises Heaney to "Remember every
thing and keep your head." And finally the
ghost disappears: "He turned his heel while
he was saying this/And headed up the road at
the same hard pace."
This technique is sometimes used too
glibly; for instance, Heaney recalls dipping a
kaleidoscope into a bucket, which causes him
'to re-envisage/The zenith and glimpsed
jewels of any gift/mistakenly abused."
Both Heaney's and Kavanagh's poems are
technically very interesting in the use of nar
rative structure. The story lines are pre
novelistic, almost medieval. Characters ap
pear not as subjective individuals but as rep
resentatives of virtue and vice, warning signs
and emblems. In Heaney's earlier poems, his
characters were permitted personalities that
impassioned them, rather in the style of the
autobiographical poems of Robert Lowell; but
now the characters exist only as guides for
Heaney hmself. By contrast, Kavanagh's
characters exist not in relation to the poet but
to God; so the story illustrates the fate of all
humanity under the sun.
