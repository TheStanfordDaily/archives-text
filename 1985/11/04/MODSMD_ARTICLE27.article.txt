SEATTLE, Wash. — The Stanford football team's
34-0 loss to Washington Saturday wasn't fun for
anybody but Husky fans and statistic historians.
It's obvious why the Washington rooters dug it. The
statistic historians' reasons were a little more obscure.
For one thing, they chortled after the game, the
trampling assured Stanford of its fifth-straight losing
season. That has never, ever, happened in the history
of Stanford football.
For another, it was the first time the Cardinal has
been shut out in 89 games, since a 49-0 blanking at the
hands of USC in 1977. That's the kind of stuff that
keeps the statistic historians grinning for quite a few
hours — until William Perry catches his first touch
down pass or something.
"Okay, but why did it happen?" says Joe Fan. What
did the Huskies do to shut down Air Paye, the 24-
point, 385-yards-per-game Stanford offense?
They shut down tight end Greg Baty. Baty, the
Cardinal's leading receiver, is the one man whom quar
terback John Paye has been able to find for consistent
gains over the middle when everyone else is covered.
On Saturday, Baty caught one pass for three yards.
Washington played a man-on-man pass defense until
the middle of the third quarter, and the man respon
sible for Baty was senior inside linebacker Joe Kelly.
! "Kelly went wherever I went," Baty said. "We have
routes that we use when they play man (to man
defense), but there was no time to set those up. We
had to go with shorter passes.
"He (Kelly) came up to me after the game," Baty
continued. "After beating on each other all day, we had
kind of a mutual respect for each other. He told me that
cpming into the game he was told the key was to stop
me. That was their game plan, I guess."
With Baty effectively removed from the offense and
the sideline patterns well covered, Paye had to go to
short screens to fullbacks Brad Muster and Brian Mor
ris. Those seven dumps that were complete — Paye
misfired on a few others — produced only 31 yards.
The downfield patterns were even more worthless.
With the four-man Washington rush applying steady
pressure, Paye went deep only twice. Once, he was in
tercepted; once, the ball ticked off Henry Green's out
stretched hand.
r : Late in the game, Washington fell back into a zone,
and Baty was open a number of times, most notably on
a Muster-bound pass that was intercepted by Allen
James. But, Baty said, "Paye either couldn't see me or
he didn't have enough time."
After the game, a Seattle reporter wandered into
the crowd around Baty and asked if he thought Paye's
delivery had been off.
"I couldn't tell you," Baty said, and laughed.
Somewhere, Joe Kelly is laughing too.
