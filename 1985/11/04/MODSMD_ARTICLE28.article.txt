# Big Weekend Wasn't a Bust For Polo Team
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff writer 
The Stanford water polo team
came out of this weekend's hec
tic schedule virtually unscathed,
dropping only one match out of
five to boost its record to 19-4.
The Cardinal defeated San
Diego State 12-6 on Friday and
went on to play all weekend in
the 49ers Invitational Tourna
ment, emerging with a 3-1
record. Stanford lost its first
match of the tournament on Sat
urday in a 6-5 overtime loss to
Long Beach State.
Stanford went on to claim
three consecutive victories over
Pepperdine (15-9), UC-Irvine
(10-5) and UC-Santa Barbara (8-
6).
"In this type of tournament,
where you have nine of the na
tion's top 10 teams competing
you're bound to have a letdown,"
Stanford Coach Dante Detta
manti said. "The Long Beach
game was our let down.
Although the loss to No. 6
Long Beach was quite a disap
pointment for the No. 1 Card
inal, the team was able to bounce
back into top form for the
remainder of the tournament.
"I was really pleased with how
well the team came back after
the Long Beach loss," Detta
manti said. "Everyone on the
team was contributing, and in
each game, a different player
carried the load for us."
Because junior David Imber

nino, Stanford's top scorer last
season, is known to be one of
the Cardinal's stronger players,
opponents tend to focus their
defenses on him.
"Since every team has been
keying on Imbernino, he's been
having a tough time getting his
shots off," Dettamanti said. "It's
been beautiful the way the rest
of the team is picking up the
slack."
Scoring for the Cardinal were
Jaime Velez (10 goals), Craig
Klass (8), Erich Fisher (8), Matt
Tingler (6), Marvin Mouchawar
(4), Imbernino (3), Andrew Law
son (3), Chris Thompson (3),
Greg Gamble (2) and Chris
Woolfolk (1).
Defensively, Dettamanti had
reason to be pleased with his
squad this weekend. The Card
inal held its opponents to 32
goals in five games. In compari
son, Stanford scored 50 goals
"Our defense is just pla^.«i S
great," Dettamanti said.
"(Freshman) Todd Kemp had
some fabulous saves and played
solidly in the goal. He has really
been sparking the team, and you
can see that the other players
have a lot of confidence in him."
Looking back at the weekend
overall, Dettamanti was very
happy with Stanford's perfor
mance. With a 19-4 record, a 3-0
conference record and only
three more matches to play
before the NCAA Champion
ships, the Cardinal is "sitting in
the driver's seat," he said.
