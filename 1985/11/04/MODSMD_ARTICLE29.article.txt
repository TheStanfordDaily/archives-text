# It's the Dog Days for Stanford
## Huskies blank the Cardinal offense, cruise to 34-0 blowout 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
SEATTLE, Wash. — The Stanford football team
picked the wrong weekend to visit Husky Stadium.
Two Saturdays ago would have been perfect.
That's when almost any team could have taken ad
vantage of listless Washington. That's when even a
37-point underdog like Oregon State could sneak
into Seattle and pull off a 21-20 upset over the team
that Sports Illustrated chose as its preseason No. 1.

For the sake of the Pacific 10 Conference, the
Beavers should have let the sleeping Dawgs lie. The
Washington players spent the next two weeks
chewing over that embarrassing defeat, reading
about it in the papers, hearing about it on campus
and getting very, very primed for their next op
ponent, whoever it happened to be.
It happened to be Stanford. And on Saturday, un
der a steady drizzle, the Huskies unloaded a
fortnight of pent-up aggression on the innocent

Cardinal, rolling to a 34-0 victory.
Washington's uncommon motivation was the key
to the slaughter.
"Usually, when we come back to the locker room
after warmups, everyone's just silent, thinking
about their own job," Husky quarterback HughMil
len said. "But today, for the first time in my three
years here, guys were banging on lockers, scream
ing, doing chants. It was real intense."
The intensity showed on the field. Washington
players celebrated virtually every hard hit and first
down with high fives all around, which meant that
their palms must have been stinging by game's end.
The Huskies didn't beat the Cardinal with a couple
of big plays; they dragged their guests around the
stadium for three long hours.
The main dragger was 242-pound fullback Rick
Fenney, who, before leaving the game in the third
quarter with a pulled hamstring, thundered for 114
yards on 23 carries and scored three touchdowns.
Fenney, who has struggled with injuries all year,
has been the Huskies' franchise player — with him,
they are 5-0, without him, they are 0-3
"I gave him one hit that I'd say was good enough
to bring down most of the guys I've faced," said
Cardinal linebacker Jack Gilmete, who led the team
with 16 tackles. "And he kept going."
The Stanford defense played a decent game, ex
cept for missing an unusual number of tackles on
Fenney and company. But they were kept on the
soggy Astroturf field for a long time, and too many
Washington drives — four of them — started in
Cardinal territory.
On offense, the Cardinal was stifled by a very
well-prepared pack of Huskies. Washington played a
tough man-on-man pass defense for most of the first
three quarters and harried quarterback John Paye
into the worst day of his collegiate career. Paye
completed 18 of 30 passes for only 96 yards and
threw four interceptions.
Paye said his arm was in better shape than it had
been against Arizona, but it still affected his play. "I
really didn't have much of an idea what the ball was
going to do when I threw it,"he said.
The running game was no better — Stanford
backs produced only 66 yards on 22 carries. Full
back Brad Muster, who had been out for three
weeks with a bruised sternum, entered the game in
the second quarter, but could manage only 30 pain
ful rushing yards and four catches for 16 yards.
It was obvious to everyone in the stadium that
Muster was still hurting. He got up slowly after
every play and sat motionless on the bench in be
tween series.
"I asked him on numerous occasions if he was all
right," Cardinal tight end Greg Baty said. "He's a
competitor, and he's not going to go out when he
gets hurt. I was a little worried."

Paye into the worst day of his collegiate career.
