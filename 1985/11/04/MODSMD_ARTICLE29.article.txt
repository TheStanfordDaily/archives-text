# It's the Dog Days for Stanford
## Huskies blank the Cardinal offense, cruise to 34-0 blowout 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
SEATTLE, Wash. — The Stanford football team
picked the wrong weekend to visit Husky Stadium.
Two Saturdays ago would have been perfect.
That's when almost any team could have taken ad
vantage of listless Washington. That's when even a
37-point underdog like Oregon State could sneak
into Seattle and pull off a 21-20 upset over the team
that Sports Illustrated chose as its preseason No. 1.

For the sake of the Pacific 10 Conference, the
Beavers should have let the sleeping Dawgs lie. The
Washington players spent the next two weeks
chewing over that embarrassing defeat, reading
about it in the papers, hearing about it on campus
and getting very, very primed for their next op
ponent, whoever it happened to be.
It happened to be Stanford. And on Saturday, un
der a steady drizzle, the Huskies unloaded a
fortnight of pent-up aggression on the innocent

Cardinal, rolling to a 34-0 victory.
Washington's uncommon motivation was the key
to the slaughter.
"Usually, when we come back to the locker room
after warmups, everyone's just silent, thinking
about their own job," Husky quarterback HughMil
len said. "But today, for the first time in my three
years here, guys were banging on lockers, scream
ing, doing chants. It was real intense."
The intensity showed on the field. Washington
players celebrated virtually every hard hit and first
down with high fives all around, which meant that
their palms must have been stinging by game's end.
The Huskies didn't beat the Cardinal with a couple
of big plays; they dragged their guests around the
stadium for three long hours.
The main dragger was 242-pound fullback Rick
Fenney, who, before leaving the game in the third
quarter with a pulled hamstring, thundered for 114
yards on 23 carries and scored three touchdowns.
Fenney, who has struggled with injuries all year,
has been the Huskies' franchise player — with him,
they are 5-0, without him, they are 0-3
"I gave him one hit that I'd say was good enough
to bring down most of the guys I've faced," said
Cardinal linebacker Jack Gilmete, who led the team
with 16 tackles. "And he kept going."
The Stanford defense played a decent game, ex
cept for missing an unusual number of tackles on
Fenney and company. But they were kept on the
soggy Astroturf field for a long time, and too many
Washington drives — four of them — started in
Cardinal territory.
On offense, the Cardinal was stifled by a very
well-prepared pack of Huskies. Washington played a
tough man-on-man pass defense for most of the first
three quarters and harried quarterback John Paye
into the worst day of his collegiate career. Paye
completed 18 of 30 passes for only 96 yards and
threw four interceptions.
Paye said his arm was in better shape than it had
been against Arizona, but it still affected his play. "I
really didn't have much of an idea what the ball was
going to do when I threw it,"he said.
The running game was no better — Stanford
backs produced only 66 yards on 22 carries. Full
back Brad Muster, who had been out for three
weeks with a bruised sternum, entered the game in
the second quarter, but could manage only 30 pain
ful rushing yards and four catches for 16 yards.
It was obvious to everyone in the stadium that
Muster was still hurting. He got up slowly after
every play and sat motionless on the bench in be
tween series.
"I asked him on numerous occasions if he was all
right," Cardinal tight end Greg Baty said. "He's a
competitor, and he's not going to go out when he
gets hurt. I was a little worried."
Stanford Coach Jack Elway praised the Washing

ton defense, but admitted that he was to blame for a lot
of the offense's problems.
"They did a hell of a job on defense," he said. "They
played man (on man) and played it well. We couldn't get
anything established. We had a couple of opportunities,
but we didn't cash in on them.
"I take full responsibility for what happened. I really
feel inept. Obviously, that's the honest answer. I don't
feel I did a very good job of attacking the man (on man
defense)."
Washington scored on its first two possessions of the
game. Less than five minutes into the contest, Fenney
pinballed off Cardinal tacklers on a eight-yard run up
the middle to give the Huskies a 7-0 lead.
The Huskies nearly added another touchdown on
their next jaunt down the field, but the Stanford
defense stiffened on first and goal from the eight, and
Jeff Jaeger came on to boot a 24-yard field goal.
9<-anfr»r<i had an excellent chance to score in the

second quarter, when it faced a second and six from
the Husky 15. But a sack of Paye, a holding penalty and
a short pass later, it was fourth and 22 from the 31, and
David Sweeney hooked a 48-yard field goal to the left.
On the Cardinal's next possession, Husky corner
back Ron Milus grabbed a tipped Paye pass and
returned it to the Stanford 20. Millen handed off to
Fenney three times, and Washington had a 17-0
halftime lead.
It only got worse. In the second half, Stanford
punted four times, Paye was intercepted twice, and
third-string quarterback Greg Ennis lost the ball once
on downs and once when time ran out on the Husky 4
yard line.
Meanwhile, Washington simply extrapolated the
halftime score. Fenney scored on an eight-yard run
around end in the third and left the game immediately
with a hamstring pull.
The Huskies took advantage of good field position
twice in the fourth quarter, scoring a touchdown after
recovering a fumbled punt on the Stanford 31 and add
ing a field goal after Allen James' interception gave
them the ball on the Cardinal 22.
