# Sun Devils Got Cooked in Maples

### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
So convincing was the Stanford women's vol
leyball team's victory over Arizona State Satur
day night that only one question remained after
the match: How in the world did ASU defeat the
Cardinal two weeks ago in Tempe?
Top-ranked Stanford simply smashed No. 10
ASU by scores of 15-4, 15-12 and 15-7 before a

small but enthusiastic Maples Pavilion crowd.
The Cardinal raised its overall record to 17-1 and
remained in first place in the Pac-West at 5-1.
The Sun Devils dropped to 17-10 overall and 1-5
in the Pac-West.
Friday night the Cardinal women survived an
early scare to defeat USC, 7-15, 15-12, 15-8,
15-8.
When ASU handed Stanford its only loss on
Oct. 18, the Cardinal women had nothing that

resembled a standout performance.
Saturday night, however, the Cardinal women
received excellent matches across the board.
Senior Kim Oden slammed 18 kills for a .529
percentage. More impressively, she did not have
one hitting error.
But Oden's success was not the only story of
the night. Her supporting cast was very deserv
ing of accolades.

helped pace a Cardinal attack that burned ASU 15-4, 15-12,15-
