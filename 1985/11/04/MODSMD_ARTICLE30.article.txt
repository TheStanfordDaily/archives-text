# Sun Devils Got Cooked in Maples
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
So convincing was the Stanford women's vol
leyball team's victory over Arizona State Satur
day night that only one question remained after
the match: How in the world did ASU defeat the
Cardinal two weeks ago in Tempe?
Top-ranked Stanford simply smashed No. 10
ASU by scores of 15-4, 15-12 and 15-7 before a

small but enthusiastic Maples Pavilion crowd.
The Cardinal raised its overall record to 17-1 and
remained in first place in the Pac-West at 5-1.
The Sun Devils dropped to 17-10 overall and 1-5
in the Pac-West.
Friday night the Cardinal women survived an
early scare to defeat USC, 7-15, 15-12, 15-8,
15-8.
When ASU handed Stanford its only loss on
Oct. 18, the Cardinal women had nothing that

resembled a standout performance.
Saturday night, however, the Cardinal women
received excellent matches across the board.
Senior Kim Oden slammed 18 kills for a .529
percentage. More impressively, she did not have
one hitting error.
But Oden's success was not the only story of
the night. Her supporting cast was very deserv
ing of accolades.

Tempe earlier this season.
Barbra Fontana — who had been
held in check by USC Friday — was
an offensive and defensive force
against the Sun Devils, hitting for a
.381 percentage and leading the
team with 21 digs.
Shaw also praised the play of

Nancy Reno and reserve Terry
Bryson. "Terry really helped spark
us," he said.
The Cardinal women came close
to burying ASU in the first game
Saturday night, jumping out to a 12-
1 advantage and winning by a score
of 15-4.
The Sun Devils rallied in game
two, however, to take an 8-2 lead,

and the Cardinal women looked
flustered. "They (ASU) really came
back," Shaw said. "We kind of un
raveled, which disappointed me."
With ASU up 12-6, Bryson —
one of only two seniors on the team
— substituted in for Reno and
seemed to pick up the team. The
Cardinal won nine consecutive
points to capture the game 15-12.
