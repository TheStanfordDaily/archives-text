# Hockey Closes in on NCAAs
## Stanford needs to win the last two this week 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
In field hockey, a slight strategic
change can make all the difference
in the world.
This was proven Friday after
noon on the Stanford hockey field
when the Cardinal defeated Chico
State 2-0. The win, Stanford's
seventh in a row, lifted the squad to
8-3-1 overall and 4-1-1 in the
Northern Pacific Conference. And
it left the team with a chance to
make the NCAA playoffs if it can
win its next two games.
The Cardinal's slight strategic
change came because of a home
field disadvantage. The uneven
surface of Stanford's grass field,
made bumpy by excessive play,
made it impossible for the Cardinal
to set the ball correctly. The team
did not get one good short corner
shot off during the entire first half.
"The field was just too rough, we
had to make a change," Stanford
Assistant Coach Noelle Mitchell
said.
According to Mitchell, the team
was aware that this change might
be necessary. In the second half,
the team switched from having
Suzanne Doi set the ball for Andi
Wolpert to having Karen Chamber
lain trap and shoot or pass the ball
herself. The strategy payed off.
Twelve minutes into the second
half, Stanford scored. Forty
seconds later, they scored again.
Friday was Stanford's last home
game of the season. The Cardinal

will close out the regular season
with two more games this week,
both on the road. On Wednesday,
they travel to San Jose State, and
the team will close out the week in
Berkeley on Friday. If Stanford can
win both games, it will automati

cally win the NorPac and gain a
berth in the NCAA playoffs.
Meanwhile Chico, which a week
ago was No. 1 in the NorPac,
dropped their second straight game
and fell to 4-5 overall and 3-4 in con
ference play.

The excellence of Stanford's
short corner execution in the
second half was an indication of the
team's all-around good play in that
stanza, according to Doi. "That was

earn an NCAA playoff berth.
