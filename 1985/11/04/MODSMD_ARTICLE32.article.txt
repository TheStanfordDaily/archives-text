# Women End Year On a Sour Note
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
When it rains, it pours.
It was a season of disappoint
ment for the women's soccer
team. And its last game of the
year was no exception.
After playing their hearts out
for 90 minutes, the Stanford
players watched victory slip
away from them once again,
losing 3-1 in overtime to St.
Mary's. The loss dropped the
team's season record to 5-12-1.
"I thought we were going to
win, but then there were two high
balls in the sun, and we lose. It's
very frustrating," said women's
soccer Coach Helen Keohane.
At the start, both squads
came out playing their best.
Throughout the first half, en
thusiasm abounded on both
teams, but neither was able to
gain an advantage. The half
ended in a 0-0 deadlock.
At the start of the second
stanza, the Gaels came out
quickly, immediately firing a
couple of shots on goal. But
Cardinal goalkeeper Helen Nor
ton was there, and St. Mary's
still couldn't score.
Finally, just seven minutes
into the second half, Stanford
struck. Cardinal forward Jen Hill
took the ball down the left side of
the field. She looked around and

found an open Carolyn Denney.
Denney, a freshman forward,
quickly took the pass from Hill
and drove the ball at Gael
goalkeeper Beth Litell.
The ball brushed off Litell's
hand, jumped into the back of the
net, and put Stanford ahead 1-0.
It looked like Stanford had a
chance to hold on to the lead and
pull out a win, but it didn't work
out that way for the weary Card
inal.
Ten minutes later, the Gaels
were awarded a penalty kick in
Cardinal territory. A St. Mary's
midfielder took the shot and sent
the ball into a crowd in front of
Stanford's goal.
Norton was able to knock it
out, but not far enough. Gael
midfielder Georgeann Wharton
beat the Stanford defense to the
ball and easily sent it into the
net. The count remained at 1-1
until the end of regulation play.
Barely two minutes into the
overtime, St. Mary's was given
an indirect penalty kick. Stanford
set up a wall to block the kick,
but Gael forward Sue Caporicci
lofted the ball over the wall and
over Norton's head.
From then on, the overtimes
was as good as over. Caporicci
put the frosting on the cake with
another overtime goal that gave
St. Mary's its final tally on the
day and a 3-0 win.
