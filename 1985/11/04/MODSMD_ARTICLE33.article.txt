# Bears Bow Out 1-0
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
It was more than a Big Game for
the Stanford men's soccer team
yesterday. It was a Big Victory
over UC-Berkeley.
"Shutting out Cal makes the
season all worthwhile," Cardinal
fullback Marshall Monroe said as he
celebrated on the sidelines yester
day.
In front of a crowd of more than
400 people at Harry Maloney Field,
the Stanford men's soccer team
thoroughly outplayed the Golden
Bears to post a 2-0 shutout.
The victory gave Stanford, 11-6-
3 overall and 5-1 in the Pacific Soc
cer Conference, sole possession of
second place in the PSC. Cal's
record dropped to 14-4-1 overall
and 4-2 in the conference.
The win also improved Stanford's
chances for an at-large bid in the
NCAA tournament.
Cardinal senior Rob West and
freshman Brian Mahaffey scored
first half goals as Stanford blitzed
the Bears right from the first
whistle.
"We gave a constant, intense ef
fort from the beginning," Stanford
Asst. Coach Hunter Stern said.
"The intensity did it — I don't think
they were expecting it, and they
never really sat up and recovered."
West burned several Cal
defenders early with tricky passes
and deft head fakes. Stanford's
second leading scorer got off two
hard shots on goal in the first 15
minutes of the game and hounded
the Bears' back line all afternoon.
The Cardinal pressure finally paid
off 29 minutes into the contest.
Midfielder Cassio Conceicao mis-hit
a shot toward the goal. The ball
bounded into the penalty area,
where a flying West punched it to
the right of Cal goalie Todd Harmon
and into the net.

The Stanford players piled on
West in celebration, and the team
had a well-deserved 1-0 lead.
The score jarred 18th-ranked
Cal, and the Bears responded with
their only real offensive pressure of
the first half. But the Stanford
defense handled two Cal free kicks
and two corner kicks easily.
The Cardinal then went right
back on the offensive, and a team
effort resulted in a gem of a goal.
Senior Angel Vazquez began the
play with a run into the penalty
area. Vazquez back-passed to
Cardinal sophomore Tim Wes
tergren, who slipped the ball to
Mahaffey on his right.
Before anyone could react,
Mahaffey rocketed the ball with his
left foot into the Bears' net. All that
happened in a matter of seconds —
the Bears didn't even have time to
blink.
The first half ended with Stanford
leading 2-0 and with a few hundred
smiling fans in the stands. The
Cardinal out-shot Cal 6-2 and
stunned the usually high scoring
Bears with an aggressive defense.
Monroe and fellow senior Todd
Rafalovich took Cal's leading
scorers, Mike Deleray and Todd
Brockman, completely out of the
Bears' offense. Deleray had scored
19 goals in 18 games this season,
but Monroe blanketed him all day
and made the 6-foot-2 junior all but
invisible.
Stanford continued to control the
game for most of the second half.
As the game wore on, play became
more physical. Cal had 19 fouls, and
Stanford had 13.
Cal waged a desperate assault in
the last 10 minutes of the game, but
the Stanford defense stood tall and
recorded shutout number 10 for the
year.
The Cardinal has one game left in
the regular season — University of
the Pacific visits the Farm Wednes
day afternoon.
