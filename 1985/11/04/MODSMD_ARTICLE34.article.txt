# Sailing Cops Regatta Trophy
## 
### BRANDI WATSON 
It was a triumphant Stanford sailing team that
returned home with the winner's trophy this weekend
from the fifth annual Stanford Invitational held in Red
wood City. The Cardinal was victorious at last in over
coming the mistakes and bad luck that have been plagu
ing the team in recent regattas.
Consistency and thoughtful sailing paid off for Stan
ford in a regatta marred by light winds that limited the
number of races sailed.
Stanford easily captured first overall in the combined
"A" and "B" division with the "A" team of Drew Gash
ler and Kristin Boyles and the "B" team of Dan Buck

staff and Rona Sisson.
In a fight for second and third, UC-Irvine narrowly
edged the Cardinal "A" team of Tom Kuhnle and Lori
Dobeus and "B" team of Rich Bergsend and Marika
Fussganger.
In division results, Kuhnle and Dobeus took the "A"
division while Buckstaff and Sisson won the "B" divi
sion. Other Stanford boats also did well. Of eight Card
inal boats entered, all finished in the top 15.
Due to some last-minute cancellations and other
schools entering only their freshman boats, the compe
tition wasn't as stiff as expected, but Stanford turned in
an outstanding performance nonetheless. The regatta
ran smoothly with 11 races run on Saturday and five
yesterday.
