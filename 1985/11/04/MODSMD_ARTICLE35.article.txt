### BILL JACKSON Staff writer 
This morning the Stanford men's
cross country team will host the
Pacific 10 Conference Champion
ships on the Stanford Golf Course.
The race will begin at 11 a.m. on
the course's second tee (on the
other side of Campus Drive near
the suites at Governor's Corner).
The Stanford men have never

won a Pac-10 Championship.
However, for the first time in Pac
-10 cross country history, the Card
inal has a good shot at victory.
"School support could be our
winning factor," cross country
Coach Brooks Johnson said.
As powerhouse teams like
Arizona (the defending champion),
UCLA, Oregon and Washington
State romp over the 10-kilometer
course, the Stanford squad is confi

dent they will be at the front of the
pack. According to Johnson, the
races should be close enough that
fan support will be crucial.
"The men are all healthy and
ready to go. They have confidence
and enthusiasm, but they will have
to run well," said Johnson. In par
ticular, Johnson said he expects
strong performances from harriers
Marc Olesen, Jeff Atkinson, Ryan
Stoll, James Alborough and Brian
Pettingill.
