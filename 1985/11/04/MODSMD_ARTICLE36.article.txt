# Eldredge Rolls in Rolex
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
There's no place like home, es
pecially if you were a member of
the women's tennis team this
weekend.
From Friday afternoon to last
night, Stanford was the host of the
1985 Rolex Regional Intercollegiate
Tennis Championships, which is a
qualifying meet for Rolex's National
Indoor Championships next
February in Houston.
The tournament is divided into
singles and doubles categories.
Both the champion of the singles
bracket and the winning team from
the doubles bracket qualify for the
national championships.
It's also the first meet of the
season for the eight Northern Cali
fornia teams involved and is, as
women's tennis Coach Frank Bren
nan said, "a nice benchmark for the

fall season, a sort of a midterm."
If it was a midterm, the Cardinal
came home with an "A." Three of
the four singles semi-finalists were
from Stanford and so were three of
the top four doubles teams.
In singles play, Stanford junior
Leigh Ann Eldredge beat top
seeded Cardinal freshman Eleni
Rossides 6-4, 6-3 to claim the indi
vidual championship. It was the first
tournament meeting of the two
teammates in what could turn out to
be a long series of championship
matches.
"It was a really tough match. We
were both a little tight. We probably
both made a few more errors than
we wanted to," Eldredge said.
After her victory in the singles
tournament, Eldredge teamed up
with junior Patty Fendick and
walked away with the doubles title
as well.
On the whole, Brennan said he
was pleased with the tournament.
