Buoyed by a 288 in the final round, the Stanford women's golf
team set a new tournament record and pulled away to win the
Stanford-Burger King Women's Intercollegiate at the Stanford Golf
Course yesterday.
Individual champion Julie Carmichael shot a 69 in the final round to
help the Cardinal defeat second-place San Jose State by eight
strokes, 889 to 897. Tulsa took third place with a total of 904.
"We got some just outstanding play from Julie Carmichael," golf
Coach Tim Baldwin said. "She shot six under par on a course that is
one of the most difficult in the country."
However, Stanford needed more than Carmichael to win, because
SJSU's Dana Lofland and Tulsa's Diane Dickman were tied for
second behind Carmichael at 218.
"San Jose State, Tulsa and Indiana played good enough to usually
win a tournament," Baldwin said. "The field was the strongest of any
intercollegiate of the year."
"We had some outstanding play from Clare Dolan," he said. "We
had a very fine tournament, especially today."
Dolan shot a 224 for the tournament to take sixth place individu
ally, and Kay Cornelius chipped in with a 226 to finish in ninth.
