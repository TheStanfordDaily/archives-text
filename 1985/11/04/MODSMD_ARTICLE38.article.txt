U.S. Specifies Arms Limits
HELSINKI, Finland — The latest U.S. arms offer to the Soviet
Union includes a ceiling of 350 heavy bombers and 1,500 cruise
missiles that the bombers can carry, a senior Administration official
said yesterday.
The official, traveling with Secretary of State George Shultz, out
lined further details of the recent U. S. offer at a stopover here on the
eve of Shultz's visit to Moscow.
It will be the first visit by an American secretary of state to Mos
cow for substantive discussions since 1978. U.S.-Soviet relations
foundered the following year when, despite the signing of the second
strategic arms agreement, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, which
ended the detente period of the 19705.
The U.S.-Soviet talks in Moscow today and tomorrow will focus
on issues on which the two sides may draw closer together and
which could lead to some new understanding at the Nov. 19-20 sum
mit between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
In the new arms proposal, the United States also called for a 50
percent cut in long-range strategic warheads, down to 6,000 on each
side, with a maximum of 3,000 warheads on land-based intercon
tinental missiles.
Another 1,500 warheads would be on submarine-based ballistic
missiles and the rest on bomber-carried cruise missiles.
The senior U.S. official traveling with Shultz also confirmed that
the new U.S. plan promises that the Administration's Strategic
Defense Initiative for space defense, which is also known as "Star
Wars," will be conducted "in full conformance" with the Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty.
Argentine Vote Backs Alfonsin
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — Argentine President Raul Alfon
sin, an avuncular and determined democrat who decreed slash-and
burn assaults on runaway inflation and right-wing extremism, won a
national vote of confidence here yesterday in midterm congressional
elections.
Projections by Argentine news media and political parties late yes
terday made Alfonsin's center-left Radical Civic Union party the
comfortable winner in the elections.
The projections gave his party 47 percent of the vote nationwide,
easily outdistancing its nearest rivals of right and left in multi-party
races. The Radicals ran well in metropolitan Buenos Aires, but their
vote was particularly impressive in interior provinces, which have
been traditional bastions of opposition parties.
With about half of nationwide returns officially counted early today,
the Radicals had 45 percent. Peronist moderates ran second with 16
percent, and right-wing Peronists were third with about 11 percent.
As tooting caravans celebrated the Radical victory through down
town streets early today, the Argentine media projected that Alfon
sin would marginally improve his two-vote, pre-electoral majority in
the lower house of Congress. The government's television station
projected a Radical party gain of two seats.
Defection May Harm Summit
HELSINKI, Finland — A continuing standoff yesterday between
the United States and the Soviet Union over a Soviet soldier who has
taken refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan complicated final
preparations here for talks today in Moscow to lay the groundwork
for the U.S.-Soviet summit meeting Nov. 19-20.
Secretary of State George Shultz, White House national security
adviser Robert McFarlane and their delegation met for more than
three hours at the U.S. Embassy here to plan strategy for the
meetings today with Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and to
morrow with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
State Department spokesman Bernard Kalb said the focus of at
tention in the U.S. delegation was on the Moscow trip, despite con
cern over the situation at the embassy in Kabul, which has been sur
rounded by Afghan and Soviet troops since a 19-year-old Soviet
private took refuge there Thursday.
Shultz's party reported that the Soviet soldier met the Soviet am
bassador and the U.S. acting ambassador, Edward Hurwitz, for 75
minutes at the U.S. Embassy yesterday afternoon.
"The upshot of the meeting was that the Soviet soldier has asked
for more time to think over any decision he may make," a spokesman
said. Another meeting is set for today.
Reagan Orders Probe on Leak
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, described as "very con
cerned" over a published report that he had authorized a CIA covert
operation to undermine the Libyan government, ordered an investi
gation to find the person responsible for the disclosure "and to take
appropriate action," a White Housed spokesman said yesterday.
Neither the Department of Justice nor the FBI would confirm that
they have received the order directing them to investigate.
The Washington Post reported yesterday that the plan involved
CIA assistance to another country, or countries, in North Africa and
the Middle East opposing the Libyan regime headed by Col. Moam
mar Khadafy. It said the proposal ran into some initial resistance
among members of the House and Senate Select Committees on In
telligence.
The Post's report — part of which was published in the the Los
Angeles Times — said that the operation was designed to disrupt,
pre-empt and frustrate Khadafy's subversive and terrorist plans and
that it might draw him into an exploit that would give opponents in
the Libyan military an opportunity to seize power.
S. Africa Restricts Coverage
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Severe controls were
imposed Saturday by the South African government on news
coverage of the country's continuing unrest, provoking widespread
criticism about the further reduction of press freedom and the
public's access to news here.
Louis le Grange, the minister of law and order, issued a decree
prohibiting television and photographic news coverage of all anti
apartheid riots and protests in the areas of the country that are now
under a state of emergency, giving the police virtual martial-law
powers. Calling the presence of South African and foreign journalists
"a catalyst to further violence," Le Grange also said newspaper
reporters, if permitted to cover unrest, must have police escorts and
follow police instructions.
"While the government has no intention of curtailing the right of
the public to be informed of current events," Le Grange said in
Pretoria, "it has decided to curb the presence of television and other
audio-visual equipment during unrest situations in emergency
areas."

easily outdistancing its nearest rivals of right and left in multi-party
races. The Radicals ran well in metropolitan Buenos Aires, but their
vote was particularly impressive in interior provinces, which have
been traditional bastions of opposition parties.
With about half of nationwide returns officially counted early today,
the Radicals had 45 percent. Peronist moderates ran second with 16
percent, and right-wing Peronists were third with about 11 percent.
As tooting caravans celebrated the Radical victory through down
town streets early today, the Argentine media projected that Alfon
sin would marginally improve his two-vote, pre-electoral majority in
the lower house of Congress. The government's television station
projected a Radical party gain of two seats.
Defection May Harm Summit
HELSINKI, Finland — A continuing standoff yesterday between
the United States and the Soviet Union over a Soviet soldier who has
taken refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan complicated final
preparations here for talks today in Moscow to lay the groundwork
for the U.S.-Soviet summit meeting Nov. 19-20.
Secretary of State George Shultz, White House national security
adviser Robert McFarlane and their delegation met for more than
three hours at the U.S. Embassy here to plan strategy for the
meetings today with Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and to
morrow with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
State Department spokesman Bernard Kalb said the focus of at
tention in the U.S. delegation was on the Moscow trip, despite con
cern over the situation at the embassy in Kabul, which has been sur
rounded by Afghan and Soviet troops since a 19-year-old Soviet
private took refuge there Thursday.
Shultz's party reported that the Soviet soldier met the Soviet am
bassador and the U.S. acting ambassador, Edward Hurwitz, for 75
minutes at the U.S. Embassy yesterday afternoon.
"The upshot of the meeting was that the Soviet soldier has asked
for more time to think over any decision he may make," a spokesman
said. Another meeting is set for today.
Reagan Orders Probe on Leak
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, described as "very con
cerned" over a published report that he had authorized a CIA covert
operation to undermine the Libyan government, ordered an investi
gation to find the person responsible for the disclosure "and to take
appropriate action," a White Housed spokesman said yesterday.
Neither the Department of Justice nor the FBI would confirm that
they have received the order directing them to investigate.
The Washington Post reported yesterday that the plan involved
CIA assistance to another country, or countries, in North Africa and
the Middle East opposing the Libyan regime headed by Col. Moam
mar Khadafy. It said the proposal ran into some initial resistance
among members of the House and Senate Select Committees on In
telligence.
The Post's report — part of which was published in the the Los
Angeles Times — said that the operation was designed to disrupt,
pre-empt and frustrate Khadafy's subversive and terrorist plans and
that it might draw him into an exploit that would give opponents in
the Libyan military an opportunity to seize power.
S. Africa Restricts Coverage
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Severe controls were
imposed Saturday by the South African government on news
coverage of the country's continuing unrest, provoking widespread
criticism about the further reduction of press freedom and the
public's access to news here.
Louis le Grange, the minister of law and order, issued a decree
prohibiting television and photographic news coverage of all anti
apartheid riots and protests in the areas of the country that are now
under a state of emergency, giving the police virtual martial-law
powers. Calling the presence of South African and foreign journalists
"a catalyst to further violence," Le Grange also said newspaper
reporters, if permitted to cover unrest, must have police escorts and
follow police instructions.
"While the government has no intention of curtailing the right of
the public to be informed of current events," Le Grange said in
Pretoria, "it has decided to curb the presence of television and other
audio-visual equipment during unrest situations in emergency
areas."
U.S. Specifies Arms Limits
HELSINKI, Finland — The latest U.S. arms offer to the Soviet
Union includes a ceiling of 350 heavy bombers and 1,500 cruise
missiles that the bombers can carry, a senior Administration official
said yesterday.
The official, traveling with Secretary of State George Shultz, out
lined further details of the recent U. S. offer at a stopover here on the
eve of Shultz's visit to Moscow.
It will be the first visit by an American secretary of state to Mos
cow for substantive discussions since 1978. U.S.-Soviet relations
foundered the following year when, despite the signing of the second
strategic arms agreement, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, which
ended the detente period of the 19705.
The U.S.-Soviet talks in Moscow today and tomorrow will focus
on issues on which the two sides may draw closer together and
which could lead to some new understanding at the Nov. 19-20 sum
mit between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
In the new arms proposal, the United States also called for a 50
percent cut in long-range strategic warheads, down to 6,000 on each
side, with a maximum of 3,000 warheads on land-based intercon
tinental missiles.
Another 1,500 warheads would be on submarine-based ballistic
missiles and the rest on bomber-carried cruise missiles.
The senior U.S. official traveling with Shultz also confirmed that
the new U.S. plan promises that the Administration's Strategic
Defense Initiative for space defense, which is also known as "Star
Wars," will be conducted "in full conformance" with the Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty.
Argentine Vote Backs Alfonsin
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — Argentine President Raul Alfon
sin, an avuncular and determined democrat who decreed slash-and
burn assaults on runaway inflation and right-wing extremism, won a
national vote of confidence here yesterday in midterm congressional
elections.
Projections by Argentine news media and political parties late yes
terday made Alfonsin's center-left Radical Civic Union party the
comfortable winner in the elections.
The projections gave his party 47 percent of the vote nationwide,
easily outdistancing its nearest rivals of right and left in multi-party
races. The Radicals ran well in metropolitan Buenos Aires, but their
vote was particularly impressive in interior provinces, which have
been traditional bastions of opposition parties.
