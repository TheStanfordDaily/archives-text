# UPDATE
## Marcos Agrees To Hold Elections 
### 
WASHINGTON — Philippine
President Ferdinand Marcos, beset
by criticism at home and abroad,
said yesterday he is "ready to call a
snap election" in "perhaps three
months or less" to let the Philippine
people pass on his "alleged inept
ness."
Marcos, however, did not flatly
predict an early election. He
pointed out that a change in his
country's election schedule will re
quire that the Philippine legislature
amend a legal provision under
which the president's current
seven-year term will expire in
1987.
Asked if, on the basis of his com
ments, Americans could expect bal
loting in January or February,
Marcos replied, "Yes, if I can con
vince the Batasang (National As
sembly), and I think I can; we con
trol two-thirds of the membership."
Marcos, who has spent 20 of his
68 years as his country's president,
made it clear during an interview on
the ABC-TV interview program
"This Week With David Brinkley"
that he is sensitive to demands for
reforms emanating not only from
his own people but also from Wash
ington.
Those demands were discussed
on the same program yesterday by
Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.). Two
weeks ago, Laxalt delivered to

Marcos a handwritten note from
President Reagan expressing con
cern over the Philippine govern
ment's failure to deal with problems
that afflict the country's economy,
its armed services and its internal
security. Laxalt is one of Reagan's
closest friends.
Marcos' surprise announcement
drew a qualified endorsement from
one of his leading congressional
critics, Rep. Stephen Solarz (D-
N.Y), chairman of the House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee on
Asia. Solarz said in a statement that
the election's ultimate significance
"depends on whether it would be
genuinely free and fair."
"The restoration of democracy is
essential if the communist challenge
is to be turned back," Solarz said.
"A genuinely free and fair election
would be essential, but a fraudulent
election would be worse than none
at all."
During yesterday's interview, in
which Marcos talked via satellite
from Manila with reporters sta
tioned in Washington, the Philippine
president belittled charges of fraud
in past elections and indicated that
he would permit outside observers
to view the balloting.
"You are all invited to come, and
we will invite members of the
American Congress to please come
and see what is happening here,"

he said. "All this talk about fraud —
it's sour grapes, poor losers ... a
publicity stunt."
Marcos conceded that his
country faces serious problems. He
said his administration is trying to
work out a recovery program to
deal with an "economic crisis" that
he said is "umbilically linked" with
the nation's "insurgency problem."
The "snap election" concept
surfaced when a questioner sugges
ted that Marcos' difficulties stem
from erosion of his electoral
mandate and asked if he might call
an election ahead of schedule.
Without further prompting,

Marcos said that his Philippine op
position has been asking for an elec
tion and that he is ready to call for
one in three months or less "if all
these childish claims to popularity
on both sides have to be settled."
"I think we better settle it by
calling an election right now, or,
say, give everybody 60 days to
campaign and to bring the issues to
the people,"Marcos said.
Pressed for details on how to
bring the election about, Marcos in
dicated that he intends to propose a
kind of national vote of confidence
in his long-lived administration.
There was no immediate
response today from the two oppo
sition leaders considered his most
likely opponents: former Sen. Sal
vador Laurel and Corazon Aquino,
the wife of former Sen. Benigno
Aquino Jr., whose assassination at
Manila airport in August 1983, set
off a wave of political protest here.
There was also no official an
nouncement from Malacanang
Palace, but this morning's Manila
newspapers reported the presi
dent's statement under banner
headlines.
Several participants suggested
that American pressure, including
Laxalt's recent visit, had forced
Marcos to make the decision.

ment's failure to deal with problems
that afflict the country's economy,
its armed services and its internal
security. Laxalt is one of Reagan's
closest friends.
Marcos' surprise announcement
drew a qualified endorsement from
one of his leading congressional
critics, Rep. Stephen Solarz (D-
N.Y), chairman of the House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee on
Asia. Solarz said in a statement that
the election's ultimate significance
"depends on whether it would be
genuinely free and fair."
"The restoration of democracy is
essential if the communist challenge
is to be turned back," Solarz said.
"A genuinely free and fair election
would be essential, but a fraudulent
election would be worse than none
at all."
During yesterday's interview, in
which Marcos talked via satellite
from Manila with reporters sta
tioned in Washington, the Philippine
president belittled charges of fraud
in past elections and indicated that
he would permit outside observers
to view the balloting.
"You are all invited to come, and
we will invite members of the
American Congress to please come
and see what is happening here,"

he said. "All this talk about fraud —
it's sour grapes, poor losers ... a
publicity stunt."
Marcos conceded that his
country faces serious problems. He
said his administration is trying to
work out a recovery program to
deal with an "economic crisis" that
he said is "umbilically linked" with
the nation's "insurgency problem."
The "snap election" concept
surfaced when a questioner sugges
ted that Marcos' difficulties stem
from erosion of his electoral
mandate and asked if he might call
an election ahead of schedule.
Without further prompting,

Marcos said that his Philippine op
position has been asking for an elec
tion and that he is ready to call for
one in three months or less "if all
these childish claims to popularity
on both sides have to be settled."
"I think we better settle it by
calling an election right now, or,
say, give everybody 60 days to
campaign and to bring the issues to
the people,"Marcos said.
Pressed for details on how to
bring the election about, Marcos in
dicated that he intends to propose a
kind of national vote of confidence
in his long-lived administration.
There was no immediate
response today from the two oppo
sition leaders considered his most
likely opponents: former Sen. Sal
vador Laurel and Corazon Aquino,
the wife of former Sen. Benigno
Aquino Jr., whose assassination at
Manila airport in August 1983, set
off a wave of political protest here.
There was also no official an
nouncement from Malacanang
Palace, but this morning's Manila
newspapers reported the presi
dent's statement under banner
headlines.
Several participants suggested
that American pressure, including
Laxalt's recent visit, had forced
Marcos to make the decision.
There was no immediate comment
from the U.S. Embassy here.
