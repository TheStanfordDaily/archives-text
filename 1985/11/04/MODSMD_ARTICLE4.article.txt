# Kennedy Speaks On Police Action
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
The upcoming release of a report
on police actions during an Old
Union sit-in and the propriety of ad
mitting a white South African stu
dent on an athletic scholarship were
addressed by University President
Donald Kennedy at a Black Student
Union (BSU) meeting in Ujamaa
House last night.
The report of Law Prof. John
Kaplan on allegations of police
brutality during the Oct. 11 arrests
of anti-apartheid demonstrators is
expected to be released today, fol
lowing a Kennedy meeting with the
nine students arrested and Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington.
The need for a complete investi
gation and administration responsi
bilities to students, police and the
community delayed the release of
the report, Kennedy said.
"The report, I think, sheds some
significant light on the question of
what happened in and around Old
Union," Kennedy said.

"It's hard for me to say much un
til I have the facts, so I have to be a
little patient and bureaucratic even
when my instinct is in the other di
rection," he said.
"I think it's fair to say that we will
be suggesting some modifications in
police procedure."
The use of compliance-pain
holds, the subject of complaints by
the protesters, is discussed in the
report, Kennedy said.
The report will be "less clear" in
conclusions relating to allegations
by Robby Perkins, one of the nine
arrested, that he was subject to ra
cially motivated police brutality at
the North County Jail in Palo Alto.
The University will "transmit"
some concerns to the Santa Clara
County Sheriff, Kennedy said.
"My impression of the report is
that those charges primarily involve
the singling out (of officers) at the
jail," Kennedy said.
Perkins questioned Kennedy on
the frequency of racially motivated
incidents involving Stanford police
such as harassing or accosting black
students on campus.
"My impression is that the fre
quency of incidents of that has gone
down," Kennedy said.
"I know that I was discriminated
against there in Old Union," said
Perkins, the only black arrested
that day."I challenge you to prove
that it isn't racism."
The admission of a white South
African athlete to the University
was questioned by BSU member
David Troutt.
According to Troutt, the admis
sion of freshman James AJborough
on a full track scholarship has a
"hidden effect" in undermining any
University policy toward South
Africa. It violates, in principal, an
international agreement barring
South African teams and athletes
from participating in sanctioned ath
letic events.
"The question dissolves into,
should we, in our admissions pro
gram, make young people respon
sible for the society in which they
are raised?" Kennedy said. "I think
the answer is that we should not,
regardless of how strong our
feelings may be about the society."
