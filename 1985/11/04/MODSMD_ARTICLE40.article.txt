## French Agents Admit to Manslaughter 
### 
AUCKLAND, New Zealand â€” Two French
secret agents today pleaded guilty to
manslaughter in the July 10 sinking of the Green
peace flagship Rainbow Warrior.
The change in the charge from murder to the
lesser charge of manslaughter came as a
surprise to spectators in the crowded court
room.
Maj. Alain Mafart and Capt. Dominque Prieur
pleaded guilty to the charges of manslaughter
and willfull damage in the sinking of the ship in
which a Greenpeace photographer, Fernando
Pereira, was killed.
There is no set penalty for manslaughter, and
the two agents will be ordered before the High

Court for sentencing.
Some legal observers said the government's
decision to accept the pleas to the lesser charges
indicated it might deport the couple.
They had been charged with murder, arson
and conspiracy.
Prime Minister David Lange had said yester
day that the agents probably had no physical con
nection with blowing up the Rainbow Warrior
that was blasted by two mines while docked in
Auckland harbor.
"I would be almost certain that those two
never had anything physically to do on the night
of July 10 which caused that ship to sink and that
man to die," Lange said. The agents were ar

rested in New Zealand on July 12.
The Rainbow Warrior was to have led a flotilla
to protest French nuclear tests at Mururoa atoll
in the South Pacific.
Lange, a former criminal lawyer, said he had
no knowledge of the details of the prosecution's
case against the pair.
A French investigation disclosed in August
that Mafart, 34, and Prieur, 36, were among
six French agents who were monitoring activi
ties of the Rainbow Warrior. It did not say
France sank the environmental organization's
ship or indicate who directed the surveillance op
eration.
