Record Warnings Set
WASHINGTON — Twenty-two music
recording companies — who produce 80 per
cent of the nation's music — agreed Friday to
print warning labels or song lyrics on record al
bums so parents can identify music that
glorifies sex, violence and drugs.
Stanley Gortikov, head of the Recording In
dustry Association of America, said the
"mutually acceptable" agreement will take ef
fect in 60 to 90 days.
"This is a victory for everyone," said Pam
Howar, president of the Parents' Music
Resource Center, which has pressed the $4
billion-a-year recording industry to deal with
what the group regards as objectionable lyrics.
The voluntary plan "will go a long way to
helping parents identify unsuitable lyrics for
children," Howar told a joint news conference
held by her group, the National Parent
Teacher Association and the recording associ
ation.
"This constructive policy is intended to
respond sensitively to the concerns of parents
of younger children and to achieve a fair bal
ance with the essential rights and freedoms of
creators, performers, and adult purchasers of
recorded music," a RIAA policy statement
said.
Gortikov said the agreement would affect

only "a minute number of lyrics," and might
not apply to contracts that give musicians total
creativity over their product, including album
covers.
The agreement provides recording compan
ies with two options: They can print the
phrase "Explicit Lyrics — Parental Advisory"
on the lower quarter of the back corner of an
album, or they can print the actual lyrics to the
songs on the back cover.
Because of limited space on tape cassette
containers, companies opting to offer lyrics
can simply print "See LP for Lyrics." Tape
cassettes account for 60 percent of all music
recordings.
According to the agreement, the definition
of "explicit" will be left to the record compan
ies.
Dumps May Close
WASHINGTON — One-third of the nation's
toxic-waste disposal sites may be forced to
close this week because they cannot meet
four-year-old federal environmental regula
tions. Dozens of others are racing furiously to
comply with the deadline this Friday.
"It's frantic out there," said Gene Lucero,
the Environmental Protection Agency's chief
toxic waste enforcer.

Most of the dumps forced to close, Lucero
said, will be small landfills or toxic ponds on
factory grounds. Chemical plants and other
factories that generate substantial quantities of
deadly wastes are expected to store them
above ground temporarily and eventually to
ship them to commercial landfills.
Controllers Testify
DALLAS — The three air traffic controllers
who guided a Delta Air Lines jetliner into
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport when
it crashed in August said Friday they had no in
formation there was a thunderstorm in the air
liner's approach path.
Gene Skipworth, the controller guiding
Delta Flight 191 on its final approach, said he
saw lightning and "a wall of rain" before the
crash, but did not pass on the information to in
coming pilots.
Six air traffic controllers on duty Aug. 2 tes
tified Friday before the National Transporta
tion Safety Board, ending four days of hearings
on the cause of the crash, which claimed 137
lives.
Skipworth admitted that Delta was less than
three miles behind a Learjet during the final
approach, a violation of federal regulations that
require at least three miles between planes.
