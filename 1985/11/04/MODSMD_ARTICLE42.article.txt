Whale Reaches Bay
SAN FRANCISCO — Humphrey the whale,
lured by a device emitting underwater
humpbacked whale sounds, glided into salt
water for the first time in more than three
weeks yesterday, but refused to leave San
Francisco Bay for the Pacific Ocean.
The 45-ton whale, a member of an endan
gered species, followed a boat emitting the
tape-recorded sounds of whales feeding for
about 50 miles yesterday, traveling through
the Sacramento River delta back into the salt
water of San Pablo Bay, then San Francisco
Bay.
But the whale gave his would-be rescuers
the slip in a strait near Sausalito, less than four

miles from the Golden Gate about 8 p.m. yes
terday, said Hal Alabaster of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The
whale turned up about 30 minutes later back
toward the middle of San Francisco Bay.
Jay Ziegler, another spokesman for the res
cue effort, said the scientists running the
search called off the tracking for the night
about 9:15 p.m. He said 10 Navy vessels
would remain in the Point Richmond area
about two miles northeast of the strait to make
periodic observations of Humphrey.
Dentists' AIDS Steps
SAN FRANCISCO — Fear of AIDS sent
hundreds of dentists trooping into weekend

lectures on infection control, where they were
urged to stop discriminating against AIDS
patients and pay more attention to office
hygiene.
"There is a lot of hysteria. I'm trying to tell
dentists there is no reason for concern," said
Dr. Mario Andriolo, a New York dentist who
lectured on treatment of AIDS patients during
the American Dental Association's annual
meeting.
During lectures and workshops held Satur
day and yesterday at the dental association
meeting, dentists fearful of AIDS were told to
wear masks, gloves and eye protection when
treating any patient, dispose waste in double
plastic bags and do a better job sterilizing den
tal tools.
