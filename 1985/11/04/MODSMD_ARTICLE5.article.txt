# Juniors Help Nab Bike Theft Suspects
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Campus police, responding to phone
calls by several Stanford students, ar
rested two suspected bike thieves
outside of Stern Hall's Burbank dor
mitory yesterday at 4 p. m..
According to witnesses, the two men
severed a bicycle lock with bolt cutters
and drove away in a black Ford Thunder
bird after being spotted by students.
The suspects were apprehended at
Serra Street and El Camino Real by

Stanford Police Officer Tony Navarra,
fellow officers and members of the Palo
Alto Police Department.
Both suspects were charged with at
tempted theft and resisting arrest,
though the second charge was later
dropped.
"About a million people" witnessed
the attempted theft, according to Stan
ford Police Sgt. Del Bandy.
Two of those witnesses, juniors John
Lis and John Chuharski, accompanied
police to the Stanford police station,
where they filed a citizen's arrest. *

"I saw two guys leaning against the
bike rack (outside of Burbank),"
Chuharski said last night. "When I
looked again, one of them was cutting
through a lock with bolt cutters."
Chuharski said he pursued the pair un
til a squad car appeared outside of Stern
Hall. Both students identified the
suspects after the arrest and later filed
statements.
Since a theft of property under $400 is
a misdemeanor, the suspects would
probably not be detained but instead
given a citation to appear in court, Bandy

said.
Bandy would not describe the
suspects in detail but said they were not
Stanford students.
"With all the rampant thefts on
campus, it's good we were able to help
out," Chuharski said. "Students need to
be aware."
Bandy acknowledged an increase in
residential thefts on camptis, but" said
the numbers of bike thefts were "about
normal" (two thefts a day) and that the
incident was being treated as an isolated
event.
