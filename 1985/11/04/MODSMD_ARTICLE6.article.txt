# USW Expresses Concern Over Contract Interpretation
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
Members of the United Stanford
Workers union, which voted overwhelm
ingly Thursday to accept the Univer
sity's final contract proposal, are never
theless "suspicious of the intent" of
some of the language in the new contract
and will protest whenever they feel the
University is infringing on their rights,
according to USW President Dennis
Blake.
USW leaders voiced particular con
cern over the possibility of different
union and University interpretations in
the contract's sections regarding job se
curity and union access to USW workers
during working hours.
Blake and USW chief negotiator Mary
Ann Tenuto said the union will hold the
University to statements made recently

by both University chief negotiator
Priscilla Wheeler and by Vice President
for Business and Finance William Massy.
Wheeler, in a KZSU interview
Thursday night, and Massy, in an Oct.
30 letter to Campus Report, de
emphasized the significance of the con
tract changes regarding the two contro
versial sections of the contract, accord
ing to Tenuto. If, she added, the Univer
sity's interpretation of the contract's lan
guage now differs from the implied inter
pretations of Massy and Wheeler, the
union will protest.
Thursday afternoon, the union voted
457-185 to accept the contract but also
approved a message to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy saying that the ac
ceptance was "under protest."
"If (University officials) try to apply
language different than they've said in
their public statements, we'll protest
. . . in whatever way seems appropri

ate. ... If they try to extend (the lan
guage of the contract) beyond what they
meant, then they're going to get it,"
Tenuto said yesterday.
"We'll definitely urge people to be
have the way they're supposed to. We
have to do what the contract requires,
but we'll expose any hypocrisy," she
added.
"It's an issue of interpretation. We ob
ject to the language, but the University
claims to have no evil intent," Blake
said.
"If the University lives up to its state
ments of intent, there will be no
protest," he said.
USW Chief Steward Linda Crouse said
the union will now "move the battle
inside. We intend to watch the Univer
sity very carefully and to hold it to the
terms very strictly."
But Wheeler said, "I think the lan
guage is clear. If [the union members]

believe the contract language is not
being followed, there is a grievance pro
cedure.
"But I don't think we're going to have
any difficulty with that. We will be doing
business the way we've been doing it all
along," Wheeler said.
According to Massy's letter in
Campus Report, the USW claimed that
the University wanted "to deny workers
the right to union representation.
"This is simply not true," Massy said
in the letter. He went on to say that the
new contract limits union representa
tives' "visits to work areas whenever
practicable to times when work is not
going on, e.g., breaks, lunch time,
before and after work.
"The University has proposed that
when union representatives are in the
work place, that they observe both
safety and department work rules,"
Massy said.
Massy also countered USW's
charge that the University was
"plotting to lay off union workers
and replace them with [non-union
members]."
According to the letter, the por
tions of the new contract dealing
with this issue do not include lan
guage different from that in the
former contract.
Should the union find cause to
protest the University's implemen
tation of these portions of the con
tract, it could protest by filing
grievances, distributing leaflets,
holding rallies and beginning a
publicity campaign in the commu
nity, Tenuto said. She noted that
rank and file members of the union
may have differing opinions on the
steps that USW should take.
