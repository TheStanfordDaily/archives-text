# New Tax May Aid Medical Students
## Levy on hospital admissions could offset residency costs 
### MARILYN WANN Editorial staff 
Society benefits from the training of
physicians; therefore, graduate-level medical
education should be subsidized by a new tax on
hospital admissions, concluded a 17-member
panel of medical experts examining the problems
in teaching hospitals and their academic support
systems.

Education Watch

The panel was established in 1983 by the
Commonwealth Fund to suggest policies that
would alleviate the triple uurden that teaching
hospitals bear of training doctors, developing
new treatment methods and caring for the poor.
"In short order many academic health centers
will have to choose among support for the poor,
graduate medical education and their regional
roles in providing specialized service such as
trauma centers and burn units," said Dr. Robert
Heyssel, chairman of the Task Force on Aca
demic Health Centers and president of the Johns
Hopkins Hospitals.
Giving Until It Hurts
The group estimates that 11 percent of the

total volume of patient care is provided by these
facilities, as well as 31 percent of the charity
care. This is a drain on any hospital budget, es
pecially that of inner-city hospitals, which handle
an even greater share of uninsured patients.
The new tax would provide some relief by
covering the expenses involved in training doc
tors, and the panel also recommended that policy
makers consider expanding Medicaid or creating
pools of funds that would be collected from a tax
on health-insurance premiums or hospital admis
sions.

Most of the burden of the tax should fall to in
surance companies, according to the panel's
recommendations.
New Competition, New Game
The cost of providing a variety of services has
recently become a burden to the teaching
facilities because of new competition in health
care prices.
The market for hospital care is shrinking be
cause alternative care centers have responded
to the demand for inexpensive care. As a result,
hospitals that don't have the extra cost of
residency training can undercut the prices at aca
demic hospitals.
"We've had a very comfortable system for the
last 10 to 20 years," Heyssel said. "Academic
health centers cross-subsidized all their func
tions through patient care rates. But now health
care is driven by price competition, and that's a
new game."
A Burden Not Shared
The direct cost of training the 75,000 doctors
in residency programs in 1984 was an estimated

$3 billion, the panel said.
Although 1,500 of the 7,000
hospitals in the United States do
provide such training opportunities,
almost half of the prospective doc
tors are concentrated in only 100
hospitals.

Poor Planning, Bad Acting
The group criticized leaders of
medical training facilities for not fore
seeing the economic trends, and for
not planning their programs based
on the projected numbers and types
of doctors that will be needed in the
future.
The panel observed that these
leaders prefer to produce
specialists with eight years of train-

ing rather than generalists with only
three years of what is always an ex
pensive education.
It further proposed that the funds
from the new tax be applied only to
the costs of three-year programs
and that foreign students not be eli
gible.
Money in Students' Hands
The tax program would work
through a system of vouchers given

directly to students to finance their
residencies.
"We want to divorce the funding
from the teaching hospitals and put
the money in the hands of the
young people who want the train
ing," Heyssel said.
He explained that this would en
courage the development of altern
ative sites for residency training
such as health-maintenance organi
zations.
