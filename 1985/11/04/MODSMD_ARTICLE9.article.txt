# Program Sponsors Summer Service
## Aided by a $500,000 donation

Aided recently by an anonymous donation of
$500,000, the Public Service Fellowship Pro
gram will expand and allow more students to
spend their summers serving others.
Catherine Milton, director of the Public Ser
vice Center, calls it "one of the most inspiring
projects that we have at Stanford." Under the
auspices of the program, selected Stanford stu
dents are involved in various innovative ap
proaches to helping people.
Last year 18 students received fellowships of
up to $1,100. The undergraduate and graduate
students worked in areas as near as East Palo
Alto and as far away as Santiago, Chile.
Junior Jennifer Tucker spent the summer at
home in Tustin, Calif., designing a series of
workshops to "help people be more comfortable
with people with disabilities."
Too often a person's "response is to avoid a
(disabled) person rather than taking risks," she
said. To encourage others to take these risks,
she organized different programs for audiences
from preschool age up. She is now making ar
rangements to present these workshops in
Northern California.
Other participants are finding their summer
projects carrying over to their time at Stanford

and beyond. Stacey Marina, a senior, said that
her project helped her "figure out the direction
for her career." '
Marina worked in the Free Clinic of Greater
Cleveland as a woman's counselor. She worked
with women who were coming in for pregnancy
tests or birth control information or who had
come into contact with sexually transmitted
diseases.
Marina said it "kind of upset me" how many
teenagers were "really clueless" about birth con
trol. But it was "a positive step (for them) to
come in and get information." She was also
surprised by "the number of programs offered
for minorities and the financially disadvantaged.
There were a lot more resources out there than
I realized."
Felipe Jaramillo found conditions in Santiago
"much worse than I expected. Tea and bread
diets were common, especially when the male in
the family was unemployed."
Jaramillo, a graduate student at the Food Re
search Institute, spent the summmer in Chile
providing "nutritional education for the mal
nourished." He designed a pamphlet and held
workshops to teach mothers how to provide the
best nutrition with what little money they had.
Maria Alaniz-Bernal worked with "a commit

tee of Hispanic professionals" to organize this
year's Chicano Youth Leadership Conference.
The annual conference began four years ago in
response to "the very low percentage of
Hispanics in Boys State and Girls State," she
said.
The students meet with Chicano legislators
during the conference. This is designed to
"make them feel more efficacious in the political
system."
Alaniz-Bernal, who is a graduate student in
education, is now doing a study of the 120 con
ference participants. She designed a survey to
find out "what factors positively affected them.
These students are having success in high school
while, in some parts of Los Angeles, the
Hispanic drop-out rate is 75 percent."
Though they spent their summers serving
others, the public service fellows agreed that the
experience was a privilege.
Marina said working with her clients at the
clinic "really made me feel good." Jaramillo was
glad for the "chance to do this kind of work. I
hope that other people take advantage of these
fellowships in the future."
Applications for the program will be available
winter quarter at the Public Service Center.
