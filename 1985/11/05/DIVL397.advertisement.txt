To whom it may concern,
We, the brothers of the Sigma Chi
Fraternity at UCLA would like to extend our
sincerely apology toward the Stanford Greek
system, student body, alumni, and
administration for the events that took place
during the UCLA-Stanford football game
weekend.
We understand that a college football game
should be enjoyable for all involved and
recognize that we overstepped the boundaries of
good, clean, fun.
We believe we have learned from the
situation and our enthusiasm for both UCLA
and our fraternity will be directed in a more
positive manner.
Sincerely,
The Brothers of Sigma Chi (UCLA)
