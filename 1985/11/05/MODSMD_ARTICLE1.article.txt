### JOYA WESLEY Senior staff writer 
The University intends to stand
firm in its position against total di
vestment, William Massy, vice
president of Business and Finance,
said last night.
The presentation, held in Cub
berley Auditorium and styled in the
format of a lecture, outlined
reasons for divestment, alternative
approaches to divestment and fin
ancial consequences of divestment
for an institution such as Stanford.
Massy listed divestment
proponents' arguments — the
belief that U.S. corporations con
tribute to social injury simply by
being in South Africa, and the

desire for action toward the issue of
the abuse of blacks — and then of
fered arguments to justify divest
ment.
These ranged from the disas
sociation with the corporations to
the attempt to punish them.
Massy's next step was to define
the various alternative approaches
to divestment. These include total
divestment, case-by-case divest
ment and divestment by "class" of
corporation based upon a predeter
mined formula.
The University's current stated
policy is case-by-case examination

Should an institution divest to
tally from all companies doing busi
ness in South Africa, it faces two
sets of consequences — invest
ment consequences and non
investment consequences — Massy

said.
In the category of investment
consequences, he listed transaction
costs, liquidity costs and costs
resultant from a decrease in diver
sification.
Transaction costs are the costs
involved with transferring securi
ties worth between $225 million
and $250 million. These include
brokerage costs, settlement costs
and the price drops associated with

"dumping a large number of securi
ties on the market all at once."
Liquidity costs involve the huge
effect an endowment as large as
Stanford's can have on the stock
market.
Finally, the diversification argu
ment rests on the assumption that
securities withdrawn from South
Africa must be placed in less stable,
smaller corporations with a greater
degree of risk, Massy said.
