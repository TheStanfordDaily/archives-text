### ERIC HEALY 
While University officials con
sider opening an overseas pro
gram in Japan, several faculty
members and students with an in
terest in overseas studies are
looking not to the future but to
the past.
This year is the 25th anniver
sary of Stanford's overseas pro
grams in Florence and Tours, and
faculty and students who have at
tended the two overseas
campuses have offered much
praise for the programs, most
notably in reunions held last
month.
"All in all, it's been a very suc
cessful 25 years for both pro
grams," said Nancy Padgett, dep
uty director of the Overseas
Studies Program.
The programs at Florence and
Tours "promote a very warm
family atmosphere" and are

"aimed at providing general
studies courses so students can
fulfill distribution requirements
. . . while being introduced to
European culture," Padgett said.
The Florence program is
simply "the most successful over
seas campus," according to
Wayne Vucinich, an emeritus his
tory professor who was one of
the first Stanford faculty mem
bers to teach at the Florence
campus.
Describing the "beautiful
ceremonies filled with medieval
tradition" that marked the dedica
tion of the Florence campus in
September 1960, Vucinich said
the program is "all for the good of
the students in that it broadens
their horizons and cultural
perspectives in addition to
democratizing and humanizing
their outlooks on world prob
lems."
Some 4,700 students have at
tended the Florence center since

1960. Slightly fewer have atten
ded Tours. Nearly 200 members
of Stanford's faculty have taught
at the two centers.
There have been some prelimi
nary discussions regarding a pro
gram in Japan, according to Law
Prof. Thomas Heller, director of
the Overseas Studies Program.
He emphasized, however, that
there has been "nothing formal
proposed, nor is there any fund
ing."
"I would like to see (an over
seas program] which operates
with some close reference to
Eastern Europe and East-West
relations in general," Heller said.
The idea of establishing Stan
ford centers in other areas of the
world was first put forward in
1957 by Prof. Robert Walker,
then-director of general studies,
and in 1958, by Prof. Frederick
Strothman, then-chairman of the
Modern Languages Department.
