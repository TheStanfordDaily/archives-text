## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Report Is Inadequate 
### 
The long-awaited Kaplan report on allegations of
police brutality, reluctantly released yesterday, is
filled with comments as inappropriate as the police
actions it describes.
To put it simply, the report, prepared by Law
Prof. John Kaplan to find out what happened during
the arrest of nine students at an anti-apartheid sit-in
Oct. 11, is inadequate. The University must con
tinue to investigate the incident and punish those at
fault.
While the report acknowledges that "compliance
pain holds" used by the Stanford police to encourage
limp protesters to cooperate during the arrests
were unjustified — despite their legality — it
implies the existence of a double standard for
punishment of wrong-doers at Stanford.
In the arrest report, Kaplan states that the police
were guilty of "wrong and unjustifiable conduct,"
but goes on to suggest that their misconduct was
offset by the fact that, one week later, police used a
specially-made sling to carry away three non
cooperative protesters in a similar anti-apartheid
demonstration. Twenty-three students caught
cheating in last spring's introductory psychology
class were not as lucky: They now face punishment
without being offered a second chance.
Both students and University officials should be
punishable for their actions. The public has a right to
expect that the police — professionals who deal

with law and safety — will get it right the first time.
Kaplan states that he has the "highest regard" for
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington. He says of
Herrington: "Like all human beings, he makes
mistakes — and, in my view, this was one." There
is no doubt that Herrington made a mistake in auth
orizing the use of compliance holds by his officers.
He has been police chief here for well over a decade
— years in which he has dealt with many similar
protests — and knows the pain that the compliance
hold causes.
It is now up to Kennedy to reprimand and recom
mend diciplinary action for Herrington and other of
ficers involved in the arrests. When dealing with the
safety of its students, the University cannot accept
such "mistakes" from its policemen.
Kaplan is also unjustified in his superficial treat
ment of the alleged beating of senior Robby Perkins
at the North County Jail in Palo Alto. Despite his
acknowledgement that Perkins received bruises in
jail that are "consistent with his having received an
unlawful beating," Kaplan implies that if Perkins was
beaten, he helped bring it on himself.
Given the gravity of any charge of police brutality,
the Kaplan report contains too many deficiencies to
be considered the final word on the subject. Stan
ford police officers have yet to be disciplined, and
the events at North County Jail remain a mystery.
