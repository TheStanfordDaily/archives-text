# We Must Act in the Philippines
## 
### 
The United States, with interests throughout
the world, faces the constant risk of being
dragged into regional hostilities. Perhaps the
most critical situation exists in the Philippines.
Consider this scenario:
Ferdinand Marcos, the Philippine president
who is reportedly ailing from kidney disease,
suddenly dies. The military seizes control of the
government and installs a general or other
Marcos political ally as ruler of the country. The
population, long suppressed by the heavy
handed Marcos dictatorship, revolts. Many flock

to the Maoist New People's Army. Anarchy
develops amid rioting and military stalemate.
Fearing for the security of the Subic Bay Naval
Station and the Clark Air Base, the United
States intervenes to bolster the sagging
Philippines government and army. Very quickly,
America finds herself supporting an unpopular
ruling elite against a hostile populace.
While this scenario may be far-fetched, it is
not impossible. At the moment, the insurgent
movement poses no threat to Marcos. But the
NPA, which numbers 15,000 men, is growing by
20 percent a year.
And the United States might very well fight to
keep the strategically located bases, especially
the one at Subic Bay. Besides being the main
supply center for the Seventh Fleet, Subic Bay
— staffed by highly skilled Filipino workers —
has the ability to repair any ship in the Navy. To
gether, the bases are in an ideal position to proj
ect American power into the Far East. Other
possible locations for the military complexes are
poor alternatives. The loss of the bases would
be, in the words of Rear Adm. Lewis Chatham,
equivalent to "abdicating the South China Sea to
the Soviets."

Under Marcos, the country has moved from
model democracy to dictatorship. Marcos has
ruled the Philippines for almost 20 years. Four
teen of those years have come since Marcos,
barred from running again for president,
declared martial law in 1973 and effectively over
threw the American-inspired democracy.
In contrast to U.S. relations with other
countries, the United States retains a good deal
of influence in the Philippines. Washington must
wield this power to restore both the stability and
democracy that has decayed under the Marcos
regime.
Several options remain open. As it is trying to
do now, the United States could persuade
Marcos to reform the government himself.
American officials have been pushing Marcos to
allow fair elections of municipal and provincial of
ficials scheduled for next spring.
Circumventing Marcos entirely is another pos
sibility. The United States could agree to sup
port the overthrow of Marcos by reformist army
officers, perhaps led by Acting Chief of Staff Lt.
General Fidel Ramos. But an American-backed
coup will not ensure the return of democratic
rule. There exists no guarantee that the military,
once in control, would relinquish power to a civil
ian president.

The United States retains
a good deal of influence in
the Philippines.

Finally, the United States could just decide to
stop supporting Marcos and allow events to fol
low their own course. Such a policy contains
many risks, however. The case of Nicaragua of
fers but one example. There the United States
pulled the rug out from under dictator Anastasio
Samoza, only to see the country conquered by
the Marxist Sandinistas. The same thing could
happen in the Philippines. And it is highly
unlikely that a communist government will sup
port either democratic elections or the presence
of the American military bases.
It is folly to believe that Marcos, with or with
out U.S. persuasion, will seek true reform. And

yet, sponsoring a coup or leaving Marcos to suf
fer from his own fate are hardly enticing options.
The United States must intervene directly in
the Philippines. First, President Reagan should
privately insist that Marcos relinquish power. If
private intimidation does not move the Filipino
dictator, then Reagan should publicly demand
Marcos' resignation. And, since the ascension to
the presidency by one of Marcos' inner circle
would probably ignite the smoldering political sit
uation, Washington must also ensure that neither
Marcos' wife, Imelda, nor any of his other
cronies succeeds him.
Marcos may very well reject the United
States' gambit and maintain his stranglehold on
power. If this happens, the United States should
organize a military coup of its own designs, con
ducted by American forces. A specially trained
unit could move in and topple the Marcos
regime. A coup conducted in such a fashion
ensures American control of events and
prevents a military dictatorship from replacing
Marcos.
Such a course of action is not excessive. The
United States must shoulder some of the blame
for the Marcos dictatorship. While in an ideal po
sition to block Marcos' usurpation of power,
Washington has done nothing. In a sense, direct
intervention ends the decay of Philippine life that
America should have prevented.
In any event, once Marcos is removed, an in
terim government under a reformist leader, per
haps Gen. Ramos, should be installed. This gov
ernment must be sanctioned and overseen by
the United States, and should be charged with
resurrecting the consitution discarded by Marcos
in 1973. General elections, monitored by the
United Nations, should be conducted within a
year.
Time is running out. Indeed, the situation may
be deteriorating even faster than Marcos' health.
Undoubtedly, there will be deep criticisms of any
American intervention, especially military. Such
attacks should be ignored. If the United States
wishes to promote both American and Filipino in
terests, we must take matters into our own
hands and intervene to restore both the stability
and the democracy that American passivity
allowed to crumble.
