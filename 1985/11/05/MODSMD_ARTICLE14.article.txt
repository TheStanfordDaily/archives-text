Roth Not a Stage
For Frat Stunts

At midnight on Oct. 23, Sigma
Chi pledges arrived and stripped
on the Roth House front lawn. The
pledges managed to perform jump
ing jacks, push-ups and cartwheels
— in the nude — while Roth resi
dents threw water balloons and
members of other frats jeered.
The incident lasted less than 20
minutes. But for two of us, the
episode had left a sour aftertaste.
Roth is a University residence
that happens to house only
women; it is not a part of the
Greek system. Almost all of us live
here because we were un
guaranteed and preferred Roth to
living off-campus. There is no
stereotypical Roth House resident:
we are not all sorority sisters, nor
are we all bulimia victims, nuns,
lesbians or radical feminists. Like
any other campus residence, Roth
shelters a group of dynamic,
diverse and impressive people.

This letter is the product of that
diversity. Many Roth residents
strongly oppose writing this letter.
That's fine — we never intended
the letter to express more than
our personal feelings. Our primary
goal, when we first decided to
write this letter, was to tell the
Sigma Chis (and the other frats
who were at Roth Oct. 23) that
we were irritated. We were
annoyed that a bunch of men were
doing stupid things in front of our
home while we were trying to
study. The frats, we thought,
were treating Roth as a stage, and
as a battleground for inter
fraternity rivalries.
The letter has acquired a signifi
cance and a momentum we never
expected. After Roth House resi
dents discussed the issue at din
ner, we realized we couldn't just
write a personal complaint. The
mere intention of writing this letter
was partly responsible for the
Sigma Chi's current probation;
tension resulting from this proba

tion has strained relationships
between some Roth residents and
their friends in Sigma Chi. To
justify the turmoil we have partially
caused, we had to address larger
issues.
Roth was consciously singled out
for the Sigma Chi's "attention"
because it is an all-female house.
The nudity was intended to shock
Roth residents. If this were not
the case, why did the Sigma Chi
pledges strip on our front lawn, but
not on the lawn of any other
campus residence? Why don't they
do their nude calisthenics on the
Delta Upsilon or the Beta Theta Pi
lawn?
The two of us cannot dismiss
the nude exercises as a harmless
college antic: we — in college —
are what we will be out there in
the "real world." Our current be
haviors and attitudes are indicative
of our future behaviors and atti
tudes. We could pass off the lawn
incident because it was "just a
bunch of frat boys" having fun.

What if six drunken, male construc
tion workers had sauntered up the
hill to Roth, stripped and done
jumping jacks in the nude? Would
we have let it go, calling it a harm
less joke, saying men will be men?
No. Someone would have called
the police.
Where do you draw the line
between what's silly and harmless
and what is institutionalized
sexism?
We drew the line at the Sigma
Chi incident. There is a saying,
"By letting it go, you're letting it
go on," which is appropriate here.
We both saw the nude exercises as
sexist and felt responsible to dis
cuss it and to discourage its repeti
tion. The hoopla and tension
generated by this letter is
worthwhile only because it prods
people to consider the significance
of a seemingly innocuous stunt.
