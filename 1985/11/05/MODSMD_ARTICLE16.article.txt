The sacred provides the deepest
meaning of life, as source and goal,
and through the intermittent colora
tion of existence with beauty,
profound personality, peace and
quiet communion. . . . Yes, but we
live our lives also as mere exis
tence, implying incompletion, prac
ticality, struggle and conflict....

VIEWPOINT

A nuclear freeze ignores these
unlovely human realities. Fate
paired us off in rivalry with the So
viet Union, and whether it is driven
by communism or nationalism mat
ters less than that existential fact
(combined with its brutality and
ruthlessness). The competition, as
between two lively individual per
sonalities, is across the board: in
culture and education, trade,
sports, industrial production, will
power and brute strength.
The notion that we can do away
with that big half of reality — exis
tential rivalry — is Utopian illusion.
We can live with such competition
indefinitely, especially since the in
crease of might makes war ever
more unpalatable to both sides.
Within this perspective, negotia
tions and reductions are possible.
What we cannot well live with is the
prospect of losing our edge and
eventually our freedom, the
meaning of our lives.
The argument that we already
have enough to blow each other to
eternity many times over is utterly
beside the point of actual ongoing
existence, which is relative
strength. Nature is nothing if not
profligate in these agonies, and we
are still a part of her. And since a
freeze would leave us with enor
mously destructive weaponry
anyway, adding more will not
change much in that regard. Hor
rifying as all this can be, it is the

only way to remain consistent with
reality. We can still go on living this
way.
There is consolation and some
hope in this: we can beat Russia in
this competition if we will to. Out
producing her militarily will cost us
half of the percentage of gross na
tional product she has to expend. In
time the people there ought to see
this as a losing proposition. . . .
Meaningful negotiation could follow.
The earth has always been vul
nerable to a cosmic disaster, as we
have learned from Velikovsky and
others, and at times we have had
very close shaves. Again and again,
James Joyce and Thornton Wilder

What we cannot
well live with is the
prospect of losing
our edge and even
tually our freedom,
the meaning of our
lives.

reminded us we survived by the
skin of our teeth. Have you seen
the Swedish documentary on
"Nova," showing the conception
and birth of a baby? How that one
little pin-point — our father — got
through a bath of murderous acid
and made it through a thousand pit
falls and past a hundred million
rivals to its goal — us — is both
humbling and reassuring. In any
case it is the truth. "We are all
