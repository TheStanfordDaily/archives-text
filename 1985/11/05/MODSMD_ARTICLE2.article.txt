# Farm Concerts Face Problems
## 
### LIZ EGAN Staff writer 
There has never been a lack of obstacles in
the concert-scheduling industry.
Scheduling at Stanford, Concert Network
members will testify, is no exception to this rule.
"We're caught in this Catch-22 situation," said
Tim Self, staff supervisor for the Concert Net
work. "Our biggest obstacle is getting enough
venues and dates.
"There is an enormous amount of red tape to
go through in booking things, and then things fall
through," Self said, noting that one performance
date this quarter had to be canceled because of
this "red tape."
During the summer, production manager John

Hamilton tried to negotiate a fall schedule with
University Events and Services. Only one date
was open for the network, and that was during
Thanksgiving break.
When the network found out that the technical
staff at Memorial Auditorium wouldn't be
working at this time, it had to give up the date.
The example highlights a chief concern:
Gaining access to facilities on campus is a prob
lem for many student groups. The problem is es
pecially difficult to overcome for a business
dealing with performers, according to Pat
O'Hara, Concert Network director. Sometimes,
groups give only short notice before touring the
area, he said.
Calling the situation "frustrating," O'Hara des
cribed the access problem as twofold. The Uni
versity rules lack the flexibility needed to obtain

big-name groups, and the network still lacks the
credibility needed to work around these rules.
Because the network is still an infant organiza
tion, the University has made some concessions
regarding performance dates, according to Lois
Wagner, director of Events and Services.
"They have to try to make it work within the
system we have, but we're very supportive of
the Concert Network," Wagner said.
There is a long process involved in facility
access. By the month of May, all the "academic
space is filled in" on the calendar of the following
year, Wagner said, explaining that the academic
departments are able to plan far in advance.
Other organizations on campus then set their
dates — also far in advance. These groups in-
elude Ram's Head, Savoyards, Sunday Flicks and the
Discovery Film Series. The remaining calendar space
for Memorial and Dinkelspiel Auditoriums goes to
"whoever can confirm what they're doing," Wagner
said.
As long as they have a contract, they can confirm
space, but the space cannot be put on hold," she said.
However, the University last year allowed the Con
cert Network to "hold" eight dates during spring quar
ter for the use of Frost Amphitheatre. The Committee
on Public Events is extending this trial policy change
another year because the network "did not have a good
representational first year of what can be done," Wag
ner said.
One of the reasons the network thinks it lacks
credibility is that there has been "a rocky history" of
concerts at Stanford, said Suzanne Becker, program
coordinator at Tresidder and adviser to the network.
A few years ago, before the Concert Network was
established, a similar organization produced a concert
and dealt with a very large deficit, and a moratorium
was put on them not to do any more shows," Wagner
said.
Since then, the group has been revamped and has
been approved by the University.
The biggest concert production competitor in the
Bay Area is Bill Graham Presents, a professional
powerhouse in the field.
Last spring, the Concert Network teamed up with
Bill Graham Presents to co-produce two Grateful Dead
concerts. Because of the success, two more concerts
were scheduled for the summer, but they were can

celed due to a misunderstanding between Bill Graham
and former Concert Network director Patrick
McCrystle.
After the incident, Bill Graham promoter Bob Bar
sotti was quoted as saying, "I couldn't imagine working
with the Concert Network right now."
Barsotti has changed his tack since then, however.
He said recently that Graham is working with the
Concert Network and "hopefully will do some more
shows together, including the Grateful Dead and
others."
Barsotti also said that Graham is planning to
build a major performance facility in Mountain View,
"hopefully next year."
According to Concert Network adviser Becker, the
network will not try to compete by attracting the most
popular groups, but instead will host more festivals —
jazz, bluegrass, new wave and women's music.
A jazz festival is already on this year's drawing
board, she said.
The Concert Network was able to get about $36,000
in fee assessments last year, said Duncan Weaver,
ASSU financial manager. "ASSU invested in the Con
cert Network to help start it up and provide a cushion,"
he said.
Becker said the cushion was not as fluffy as she
would like.
"That helps us take some risks and allows us to do
some shows on our own ... but it's not a great deal of
money when you're talking about the concert indus
try, " she said.
The network has succeeded in putting together a
solid organization, Becker said. "The University has
begun to feel comfortable with our judgment and our
expertise."
