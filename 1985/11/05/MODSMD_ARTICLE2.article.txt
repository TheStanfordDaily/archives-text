# Farm Concerts Face Problems

There has never been a lack of obstacles in
the concert-scheduling industry.
Scheduling at Stanford, Concert Network

There is a long process involved in facility

space is filled in" on the calendar of the following

departments are able to plan far in advance.
Other organizations on campus then set their
