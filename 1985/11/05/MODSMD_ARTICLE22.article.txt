## It May Not Look Great But it Won't Explode 
### ANDREW McCLUNG 
Greetings!
This week saw a great influx of ques
tions, for which all of you readers deserve
the warmest thanks. So, thank you.
How come Stanford doesn't put more ef
fort/funds into preserving the old houses on
campus instead of constantly repaint
ing/repairing the sterile ski lodges, e.g. the
Italian House and 558 Mayfield? - Adriana
Estrada, arbiter of New Wave tastes
Keith Archuleta, assistant director of the
Row, says that the Row and Cluster
Facilities Office has no policy that requires
them to refurbish only the residences that
need it least. What they do have is a round
robin schedule of repairs that is designed to
keep all 38 row houses in fighting trim.
Since only a few houses can be revamped
each year (because most of the repairs are
taken care of during the summer), it may
seem that certain houses are neglected,
even doomed to dilapidation, but in fact
they are just being dealt with fairly slowly.
This apparent sluggishness is ex
acerbated by the fact that most of us only
witness repairs around here for a few
years.
Feedback from residents is crucial to
getting renovation done promptly, so if you
live in a self-op (and even if you don't), then
you might consider it your responsibility
and even your privilege to let the facilities

folks know about the condition of the
house.
Such action helps them prioritize their
monetary and human resources so as to ef
fect repairs where they are most needed.
A friend of mine (I'll call him Dave) and I
got into an argument last week while watch
ing "The A-Team." Dave claims that
automobiles do not explode when they are
rolled over; I aver that the show is true to life
and that of course autos explode when rolled.
Can you settle this for us? Also, I hit Dave
on the back of the neck as he left the room,
but he did not faint like they so often do in
many TV shows. Why not? What is going on
here? - an operations research grad student
You, along with countless others, are
deceived by the miracle of television.
A chat with the convivial Rick Donofrio of
Cavallino Rampante, Ltd., revealed that
even in head-on collisions — those in which
electrical shorts are most likely juxtaposed
with ruptured fuel lines near the engine
block — fires in general, and explosions in
particular, are quite rare.
Since Rick is a specialist in major body
repairs of small imports and exotic foreign
cars (which are typically driven too fast and
with some recklessness), he knows about
these things, and says that in the six years
he's been at Cavallino, he has seen perhaps
three cars that could be said to have ex
ploded. About 500 or so cars go through
the shop each year.
Apart from front-end collisions, there is
only an extremely minor chance of a car ex

ploding just because it rolls. This conclusion
is confirmed by an unidentified claims offi
cer at All-State Insurance in San Francisco,
who estimates that he sees at most one ex
ploded car claim per year.
Now, about the karate chopping. Dr.
Stephen Peroutka, assistant professor of
neurology, claims that quick chops to the
back of the neck can knock people sense
less "only on 'Star Trek,' cowboy shows

and detective shows."
Sure, you might be able to do it, but first
you would have to be enormously strong;
second, the victim would have to be unpre
pared for the blow; and third, you would
probably break his neck if the blow were
forceful enough to knock him out, and sepa
rating vertebrae is not as easy as it might
seem.
Even for Steve McGarrett.
As for the "Vulcan death grip," by the
way, you could render someone uncon
scious by pressing hard enough on the
carotid artery to cut off circulation to the
brain, but make sure you know where their
carotid artery is before you try this stunt at
home, folks.
Otherwise, a person with a very bruised
neck will get very mad at you.
Now we have two Tresidder questions,
only one of which is bathroom-related.
Who designed the small trash receptacles
in Tresidder cafe? Some Stanford engineer?
You can't deposit anything in one without
using your hand to open it, but they are in
variably covered with burrito residual. -
anonymous
After conversing briefly with Nanci
Howe, the assistant director of Tresidder
Union, I can say that those receptacles
were engineered by a local restaurant
design firm four years ago.
They have since been recognized as less
than ideal in form, even by those who com
missioned them.
In response to the problems people

encounter in desperately battling those
small and tightly sprung lids, a whopping
four (count them, four) of those bins have
been lovingly renovated at (in all serious
ness) a very great expense.
These four are presumably the ones
most used, and now one can actually get
plates into them without having to appeal
for assistance or at least a hosing down af
terward.
Tresidder officials would love to fix the
remaining receptacles, but the fact that
they were specially designed to blend har
moniously with the decor means that any
repairs or modifications are quite costly.
Help! One of the cold water faucets in the
men's restroom at Tresidder has been broken
for more than a year. Is this a problem you
can solve?— someone who washes his
hands
No, it is not. That is because it has
already been solved.
I wasted no time in executing my duties
as ace troubleshooter and called Gordon
Baker, who is the building operations
manager for Tresidder. He raced from the
phone to reconnoiter the men's room faucet
status.
Not just any men's room, mind you, but
the Tresidder downstairs men's room, next
to Stanford Hairs tyling. It turned out that
the faucet had been repaired about a week
ago, and so I assume that your life has
taken a major upswing since then.
Now you can once again live a life free
from fear of infection.

here? - an operations research grad student
You, along with countless others, are
deceived by the miracle of television.
A chat with the convivial Rick Donofrio of
Cavallino Rampante, Ltd., revealed that
even in head-on collisions — those in which
electrical shorts are most likely juxtaposed
with ruptured fuel lines near the engine
block — fires in general, and explosions in
particular, are quite rare.
Since Rick is a specialist in major body
repairs of small imports and exotic foreign
cars (which are typically driven too fast and
with some recklessness), he knows about
these things, and says that in the six years
he's been at Cavallino, he has seen perhaps
three cars that could be said to have ex
ploded. About 500 or so cars go through
the shop each year.
Apart from front-end collisions, there is
only an extremely minor chance of a car ex

ploding just because it rolls. This conclusion
is confirmed by an unidentified claims offi
cer at All-State Insurance in San Francisco,
who estimates that he sees at most one ex
ploded car claim per year.
Now, about the karate chopping. Dr.
Stephen Peroutka, assistant professor of
neurology, claims that quick chops to the
back of the neck can knock people sense
less "only on 'Star Trek,' cowboy shows

and detective shows."
Sure, you might be able to do it, but first
you would have to be enormously strong;
second, the victim would have to be unpre
pared for the blow; and third, you would
probably break his neck if the blow were
forceful enough to knock him out, and sepa
rating vertebrae is not as easy as it might
seem.
Even for Steve McGarrett.
As for the "Vulcan death grip," by the
way, you could render someone uncon
scious by pressing hard enough on the
carotid artery to cut off circulation to the
brain, but make sure you know where their
carotid artery is before you try this stunt at
home, folks.
Otherwise, a person with a very bruised
neck will get very mad at you.
Now we have two Tresidder questions,
only one of which is bathroom-related.
Who designed the small trash receptacles
in Tresidder cafe? Some Stanford engineer?
You can't deposit anything in one without
using your hand to open it, but they are in
variably covered with burrito residual. -

After conversing briefly with Nanci
Howe, the assistant director of Tresidder
Union, I can say that those receptacles
were engineered by a local restaurant
design firm four years ago.
They have since been recognized as less
than ideal in form, even by those who com
missioned them.
In response to the problems people

encounter in desperately battling those
small and tightly sprung lids, a whopping
four (count them, four) of those bins have
been lovingly renovated at (in all serious
ness) a very great expense.
These four are presumably the ones
most used, and now one can actually get
plates into them without having to appeal
for assistance or at least a hosing down af
terward.
Tresidder officials would love to fix the
remaining receptacles, but the fact that
they were specially designed to blend har
moniously with the decor means that any
repairs or modifications are quite costly.
Help! One of the cold water faucets in the
men's restroom at Tresidder has been broken
for more than a year. Is this a problem you
can solve?— someone who washes his
hands
No, it is not. That is because it has
already been solved.
I wasted no time in executing my duties
as ace troubleshooter and called Gordon
Baker, who is the building operations
manager for Tresidder. He raced from the
phone to reconnoiter the men's room faucet
status.
Not just any men's room, mind you, but
the Tresidder downstairs men's room, next
to Stanford Hairs tyling. It turned out that
the faucet had been repaired about a week
ago, and so I assume that your life has
taken a major upswing since then.
Now you can once again live a life free
from fear of infection.

Greetings!
This week saw a great influx of ques
tions, for which all of you readers deserve
the warmest thanks. So, thank you.
How come Stanford doesn't put more ef
fort/funds into preserving the old houses on
campus instead of constantly repaint
ing/repairing the sterile ski lodges, e.g. the
Italian House and 558 Mayfield? - Adriana
Estrada, arbiter of New Wave tastes
Keith Archuleta, assistant director of the
Row, says that the Row and Cluster
Facilities Office has no policy that requires
them to refurbish only the residences that
need it least. What they do have is a round
robin schedule of repairs that is designed to
keep all 38 row houses in fighting trim.
Since only a few houses can be revamped
each year (because most of the repairs are
taken care of during the summer), it may
seem that certain houses are neglected,
even doomed to dilapidation, but in fact
they are just being dealt with fairly slowly.
This apparent sluggishness is ex
acerbated by the fact that most of us only
witness repairs around here for a few
years.
Feedback from residents is crucial to
getting renovation done promptly, so if you
live in a self-op (and even if you don't), then
you might consider it your responsibility
and even your privilege to let the facilities

folks know about the condition of the
house.
Such action helps them prioritize their
monetary and human resources so as to ef
fect repairs where they are most needed.
A friend of mine (I'll call him Dave) and I
got into an argument last week while watch
ing "The A-Team." Dave claims that
automobiles do not explode when they are
rolled over; I aver that the show is true to life
and that of course autos explode when rolled.
Can you settle this for us? Also, I hit Dave
on the back of the neck as he left the room,
