## Drama Department Will Stage 'Top Girls' by Caryl Churchill 
### MARK TOMPKINS 
"I expect it will be rather well-attended," says direc
tor Joylynn Wing of her upcoming production of "Top
Girls." Her confidence is understandable: Caryl Chur
chill's "Top Girls" is a highly original and provocative
drama, and under Wing's direction looks set to be a
clear success for the Stanford Drama Department.
A third-year doctoral candidate in the department,
Wing has been active in feminist programs in the past.
This explains her decision to stage "Top Girls," for the
play examines modern women in an unusual manner.
On the strength of this work and some of her earlier
dramas, Caryl Churchill is currently considered to be
Britain's leading woman playwright. Her career as a
dramatist began in the early '60s, when she wrote for
BBC Radio along with other budding young hopefuls
such as Tom Stoppard. Since then Churchill has writ
ten over 35 plays, although she only achieved interna
tional prominence several years ago, when "Cloud
Nine" became a tremendous hit in both London and
New York.
While much of Churchill's work deals with how
narrowly-defined gender roles can damage society, it
would be a mistake to say that her feminist politics are
the only point of interest in her plays. Certainly Joylynn
Wing feels differently. "Theater is meant to be overly
theatrical and fantastic," she says, and "Top Girls"
gives her the chance to indulge in the unreal like few
other dramas.
The play opens with a dinner party which, though
ostensibly set in a chic Manhattan restaurant, actually
occurs outside any "real" time or place. The all-female
gathering is hosted by Marlene, the play's heroine,
who is celebrating her promotion to the top of a pres
tigious employment agency. Her guests include a
female pope from the Middle Ages, a 19th-century ex
plorer, a woman from a Brueghel painting, a character
out of Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales," and a courtesan
from 13th-century Japan.

From this surreal opening the play moves into less
fanciful territory, namely the employment office where
Marlene works. Churchill portrays the office as the ul
timate '80s environment, an arena of intense competi
tion where ethics are readily abandoned in the struggle
to "get ahead." The women who work there, Marlene
included, must either sacrifice their femiiiinity or ex
ploit it, if they are to succeed in the fast-paced business
world. In easy contrast to this cut-throat atmosphere is
the dingy home of Marlene's sister, Joyce. Here there
is none of the heady glamour of Madison Avenue, only
drabness. Some of the play's most interesting mo
ments come when Marlene finds herself in Joyce's
house. Eventually we learn that Marlene grew up here,
but escaped to the city as soon as possible.
There are other revelations as well, but Wing would
prefer that people come and see for themselves.
"Women may be able to identify with Marlene; there's a
lot of interest in her situation," she says. Wing has put
a great deal of work into "Top Girls;" it is her thesis
production for the Drama Department. Her past
directing credits include Tom Stoppard's "Dogg's
Hamlet," Dario Fo's "Orgasmo Adulto Escapes From
The Zoo" and "Pierre Pathelin," an anonymous farce
from 1450.
"Top Girls" provides Wing with a challenge she
hasn't faced in her past experience — dealing with the
scale of Stanford's Little Theater. Second-year doc
toral candidates mount their productions in The Nitery,
but third-year students are required to work in the
somewhat larger Little Theater. Wing is in no way
daunted, however. "I like the intimacy of Little
Theater," she says.
The size of a is just one aspect of staging a play that
a director must deal with. There are also set, lighting
and costume designs that need to be planned out, all
before the play is even cast. Wing spent the entire
summer researching "Top Girls," but this is not an
undue amount of time; directors on Broadway often
spend a year researching their plays. Wing used this
time to decide what themes and emotional points she

wanted to emphasize in Churchill's material. She then
met with her various designers; together they decided
how to best interpret the play.
The sets were one area which gave Wing and her
designers the chance to be especially creative. "I
wanted a diametrically opposed difference between the
worlds of Marlene and Joyce," explains the director,
and this is what the audience will see. Marlene's office
will be a sleek and angular space, so impersonal as to
resemble the setting of some glittery commercial. But
Joyce's house will be exactly the opposite, a virtual
hovel painted in dull, earthy tones. The advantage of
these stylized sets is that they reflect the characters
who inhabit them; for Wing this stylization is what sets
theater apart from other media. "Theater will never
compete with TV or movies for realism," she says," so

why be realistic?"
Finally, of course, a director must take great care in
the casting of a play. "Top Girls" is unusual in that its
16 roles are played by only seven actresses. Over a
four-day period of auditions, 60 different actresses
tried out for the seven openings. Wing did not watch
the tryouts by herself; the Drama Department has a
new policy in which the directors of all upcoming plays
watch the auditions for every play, not just their own.
This policy is beneficial to everyone involved, for it
enables directors to draw from a wider pool of talent,
while actors who try out for one role unsuccessfully
may find themselves cast in another play.
Once Wing had her cast, she and the actors had to

work out the play's many over
lapping speeches. "Those speeches
have to be worked out
meticulously, since the audience
has to know what both characters
are saying," she says. Wing is not at
all dictatorial in her methods, and

likes to do a lot of improvisation in
order to loosen everyone up.
"For me the ideal is to get the ac
tors' creative juices flowing, and
then I shape their ideas. I like to
develop a rapport with them — it's
a real collaborative effort. I hate the
idea of the star system." For this
reason Churchill's play is an excel
lent choice for Wing to direct, since
each actress plays several roles.

This prevents any one actress from
overpowering the others.
"Top Girls" seems to have
everything going for it: there are
imaginative sets, some striking
costumes designed by Prof. William
Eddelman and an enthusiastic crew,
led of course by Wing and her stage
managers Lonnie Barton and Allen
Blue. Will it be a success? Only
opening night will tell.

work out the play's many over
lapping speeches. "Those speeches
have to be worked out
meticulously, since the audience
has to know what both characters
are saying," she says. Wing is not at
all dictatorial in her methods, and

likes to do a lot of improvisation in
order to loosen everyone up.
"For me the ideal is to get the ac
tors' creative juices flowing, and

reason Churchill's play is an excel
lent choice for Wing to direct, since
each actress plays several roles.

This prevents any one actress from
overpowering the others.
"Top Girls" seems to have
everything going for it: there are
imaginative sets, some striking
costumes designed by Prof. William
Eddelman and an enthusiastic crew,
led of course by Wing and her stage
managers Lonnie Barton and Allen
Blue. Will it be a success? Only
opening night will tell.
"I expect it will be rather well-attended," says direc
tor Joylynn Wing of her upcoming production of "Top
Girls." Her confidence is understandable: Caryl Chur
chill's "Top Girls" is a highly original and provocative
drama, and under Wing's direction looks set to be a
clear success for the Stanford Drama Department.
A third-year doctoral candidate in the department,
Wing has been active in feminist programs in the past.
This explains her decision to stage "Top Girls," for the
play examines modern women in an unusual manner.
On the strength of this work and some of her earlier
dramas, Caryl Churchill is currently considered to be
Britain's leading woman playwright. Her career as a
dramatist began in the early '60s, when she wrote for
BBC Radio along with other budding young hopefuls
such as Tom Stoppard. Since then Churchill has writ
ten over 35 plays, although she only achieved interna
tional prominence several years ago, when "Cloud
Nine" became a tremendous hit in both London and
New York.
While much of Churchill's work deals with how
narrowly-defined gender roles can damage society, it
would be a mistake to say that her feminist politics are
the only point of interest in her plays. Certainly Joylynn
Wing feels differently. "Theater is meant to be overly
theatrical and fantastic," she says, and "Top Girls"
gives her the chance to indulge in the unreal like few
other dramas.
The play opens with a dinner party which, though
ostensibly set in a chic Manhattan restaurant, actually
occurs outside any "real" time or place. The all-female
gathering is hosted by Marlene, the play's heroine,
who is celebrating her promotion to the top of a pres
tigious employment agency. Her guests include a
female pope from the Middle Ages, a 19th-century ex
plorer, a woman from a Brueghel painting, a character
out of Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales," and a courtesan
from 13th-century Japan.

From this surreal opening the play moves into less
fanciful territory, namely the employment office where
Marlene works. Churchill portrays the office as the ul
timate '80s environment, an arena of intense competi
tion where ethics are readily abandoned in the struggle
to "get ahead." The women who work there, Marlene
included, must either sacrifice their femiiiinity or ex
ploit it, if they are to succeed in the fast-paced business
world. In easy contrast to this cut-throat atmosphere is
the dingy home of Marlene's sister, Joyce. Here there
is none of the heady glamour of Madison Avenue, only
drabness. Some of the play's most interesting mo
ments come when Marlene finds herself in Joyce's
house. Eventually we learn that Marlene grew up here,
but escaped to the city as soon as possible.
There are other revelations as well, but Wing would
prefer that people come and see for themselves.
"Women may be able to identify with Marlene; there's a
lot of interest in her situation," she says. Wing has put
a great deal of work into "Top Girls;" it is her thesis
production for the Drama Department. Her past
directing credits include Tom Stoppard's "Dogg's
Hamlet," Dario Fo's "Orgasmo Adulto Escapes From
The Zoo" and "Pierre Pathelin," an anonymous farce
from 1450.
"Top Girls" provides Wing with a challenge she
hasn't faced in her past experience — dealing with the
scale of Stanford's Little Theater. Second-year doc
toral candidates mount their productions in The Nitery,
but third-year students are required to work in the
somewhat larger Little Theater. Wing is in no way
daunted, however. "I like the intimacy of Little
Theater," she says.
The size of a is just one aspect of staging a play that
a director must deal with. There are also set, lighting
and costume designs that need to be planned out, all
before the play is even cast. Wing spent the entire
summer researching "Top Girls," but this is not an
undue amount of time; directors on Broadway often
spend a year researching their plays. Wing used this
time to decide what themes and emotional points she

wanted to emphasize in Churchill's material. She then
met with her various designers; together they decided
how to best interpret the play.
The sets were one area which gave Wing and her
designers the chance to be especially creative. "I
wanted a diametrically opposed difference between the
worlds of Marlene and Joyce," explains the director,
and this is what the audience will see. Marlene's office
will be a sleek and angular space, so impersonal as to
resemble the setting of some glittery commercial. But
Joyce's house will be exactly the opposite, a virtual
hovel painted in dull, earthy tones. The advantage of
these stylized sets is that they reflect the characters
who inhabit them; for Wing this stylization is what sets
theater apart from other media. "Theater will never
compete with TV or movies for realism," she says," so

why be realistic?"
Finally, of course, a director must take great care in
the casting of a play. "Top Girls" is unusual in that its
16 roles are played by only seven actresses. Over a
four-day period of auditions, 60 different actresses
tried out for the seven openings. Wing did not watch
the tryouts by herself; the Drama Department has a
new policy in which the directors of all upcoming plays
watch the auditions for every play, not just their own.
This policy is beneficial to everyone involved, for it
enables directors to draw from a wider pool of talent,
while actors who try out for one role unsuccessfully
may find themselves cast in another play.
