# Professional Ballet as Close as San Mateo

### BECKY JAMES 
"Professional ballet in San
Mateo?"
J The brochure for the Peninsula
Ballet Theatre asks this question,
and its performance of "Coppelia"
last weekend answered it: there is
indeed professional ballet in San
Mateo.
Performing at the San Mateo
Performing Arts Center, the Penin
sula Ballet Theatre presented a
brilliant performance of this 19th
century ballet by Delibes.
"Coppelia," based on a story by
E.T.A. Hoffman, is set in a village
in Central Europe and is the story
of two young lovers, Swanilda and
Franz, and a lifelike doll, Coppelia.
For most of the story, neither
Swanilda nor Franz realizes that
Coppelia is a doll and their relation
ship is threatened when Swanilda
finds Franz attempting to woo Cop
pelia. Through a bizarre turn of
events, Swanilda discovers that

Coppelia is only a doll and eventu
ally is able to communicate this
knowledge to Franz. At this point,
Franz realizes that Swanilda is the
woman he truly loves. They are
married and everyone lives happily
ever after.
What the story may lack in
literary value, this performance
made up for in artistry. The
choreography, dancing and music
all contributed to making the Penin
sula Ballet Theatre's production of
"Coppelia" exceptional.
All of the dancers performed
beautifully, but particularly notable
were the performances of Swanilda
and Franz, played by Rosine Bena
and Sam Weber.
Bena's dancing throughout the
show was spectacular. She pos
sessed just the right balance of
strength and flexibility to deliver a
superb performance. In addition,
her dramatic ability was often what
kept the show going. Her comic
expressions and miming not only
helped make the plot clear, but they

were entertaining as well.
Weber also produced a dazzling
performance. His solos in the third
(and final) act were met with reac
tions of awe and wonder. He exhib
ited amazing strength and ability in
his sequences of jumps and turns. It
was unfortunate that he did not get
more of a chance to demonstrate
his ability. As it was, he didn't really
dance until the third act and even
then his solos were brief. Weber
and Bena also worked well to
gether. Their coupling in the first
and third acts was impressive not
only for each individual's levels of
dancing, but also for their ability to
work together.
The corps de ballet should not go
without mention. Its work, espe
cially in the first act, was well ex
ecuted, and it also demonstrated its
ability to work together. The danc
ing done by the "Village Dancers"
during the first act was particularly
precise and exciting.
Also worthy of note were the
performances of the "dolls." Here

acting ability counted more than
dancing, and the acting of the dolls
was often incredible. Their me
chanical actions and frozen expres
sions were fascinating and amusing
to watch.
Some very well done choreog
raphy also contributed to the suc
cess of the performance. The
choreographer, Igor Youskevitch,
was quite sensitive to the music;
the steps fit almost perfectly to the
rhythms in the music. The work
done by the corps de ballet was es
pecially well choreographed, com
bining both precision and elegance.
Futhermore, the Peninsula Ballet
Theatre was fortunate to have a
symphony orchestra providing the
music for the ballet, and the quality
of the orchestra was definitely im
pressive.
All in all, "Coppelia" was well
done and very entertaining. If this
performance was any indication,
the Peninsula Ballet Theatre is off
to a great season of professional
ballet in San Mateo.
