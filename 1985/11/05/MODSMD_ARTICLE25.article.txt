# The 						Tragedy of Anne Boleyn: Fails on Mountain View Stage
## 
### DAVID OVENS 
"Anne of the Thousand Days,"
currently being performed by the
Mountain View Cabaret Commu
nity Theater, is a noble effort for
a community theater, but not
noble enough.
The play is a three-hour long
historical drama about the lives of
Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. It
has a fairly interesting plot that
centers around the king's obses
sion with getting a male heir to his
throne. Unfortunately, "Anne of a
Thousand Days" begins rather

slowly, and by the time the pace
picks up, the audience has already
begun to think about going home.
Henry Oohn Rechtfertig) does
a fine job of delivering his lines.
The one drawback for him (and
for most of the characters) is that
he doesn't seem to listen very ex
pressively. At the point when
Anne finally admits that she loves
him, he doesn't show the ex
pected joy. He has been waiting
for years to obtain her love, and
when she finally concedes, he
acts as though nothing has really
happened. During Anne's trial,
Henry is listening to her pour out

her heart and, although he is af
fected in the end, he stands there
listening like a statue.
Anne (Sandy Efseaff Benster)
does a remarkable job with her
lines, but falls into the same trap
as the king. At her trial, where
her accused lover is lying about
her faithfulness, she and the
judge appear to take his tes
timony in the same way. Anne
has to plead with the man to tell
the truth so that he may go to his
grave with a clear conscience, the
judge doesn't. The prelude to this
plea is not seen on her face. When
Anne hears Henry pour out his
heart after her coronation and
later at the trial, she is building up
a passion inside, but it is less than
evident externally.
The other characters (Cardinal
Wolsey, Thomas Cromwell, Sir
Thomas More, the Boleyn family
and the various atttendants of
court) give rather acceptable per
formances. The play itself re
quires a great deal of effort for ac
tors, considering that the people
of this era were so different from
us, and these actors have visibly
spent a great deal of time trying
to identify with their characters.
The company is to be appreci
ated for what it is â€” a small com
munity group performing a diffi
cult historical play, There are
many well-delivered monologues;
unfortunately, the audience prob
ably listens more attentively than
the actors on stage. See "Anne of
the Thousand Days" only if it is a
favorite of yours, or if relations
between kings and women inter
est you. Otherwise, stay on
campus.


John Rechtfertig stars as Henry VIII in "Anne of the
