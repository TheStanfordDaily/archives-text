# Dynamic Warren Zevon Performs Old and New
## 
### TRACY FURUTANI 
The Keystone Palo Alto was jammed Fridy night, at
testing to the tremendous, cult-like popularity of
songwriter and performer Warren Zevon seven years
after the release of his most famous album, "Excitable
Bay."
At the time of its release, "Excitable Boy" attracted
the attention of Time magazine, which said Zevon had
taken to "brandishing (a .44 magnum) as he ran around
his house wearing a duck mask."
Friday, Zevon appeared clean-shaven. He waved
heartily to the crowd, then gave a ferocious — if
sparse — performance. When he introduced the song
"Jeannie Needs A Shooter" (which he co-wrote with
Bruce Springsteen), he added, apologetically, "Hey,
I'm not (Springsteen guitarist) Nils Lofgren, so give
me a break, huh?"
If Zevon isn't the most acclaimed instrumentalist, he
certainly is one of the most intense — attacking piano,
electric piano and 12-string guitar with equally violent
skill.
Some members of the audience grumbled that this
show was not like Zevon's live album, "Stand in the
Fire." This is true; he performs much better alone than
with a backing band. Alone, Zevon is not limited to
foot-stompers and can pace the show with some of his
slower ballads. Overall, this provided a fine-grade per
formance with plenty of gems.
"Frank and Jesse James," the first song off of the
"Warren Zevon" album, is becoming his standard
opening number. A beautiful piano piece, the lyrics
paint the two title outlaws as sympathetic
"misunderstood" characters, championing the "poor

Missouri farmer." How he plays this song reveals what
mood he will be in for the rest of the show, and Friday
night he played it with particular vehemence.
"Start Me Up" and "Poor Poor Pitiful Me" opened
the guitar portion of Zevon's show with a rousing cover
of the old Rolling Stones rocker, whose final line
("Enough to make a grown man cry") led perfectly
into the opening words of the second song ("So I lay
my head on the railroad tracks"). "Desperadoes Under
the Eaves" and "Accidentally Like a Martyr," the two
most thoughtful of his songs, provided insight to the
"Excitable Boy" madness.
"Desperadoes" was a particular treat, seldom heard
live: "Don't the sun look angry through the
trees?/Don't the trees look like crucified thieves?" —
the imagery is gorgeous.
"On Broadway" found new life as the instrumental
bridge of Zevon's greatest hit, "Werewolves of Lon
don." Even at 38, Zevon can still howl with the best of
them. Though he has not released an album for three
years, he has not stopped writing. Of his new material,
"Trouble Waiting to Happen" is his best, coming
closest to his Time profile: "I read about things I'm
supposed to have done/It sounded like a lot of fun/I
guess I must have been bad or something/Trouble
waiting to happen."
For the encore, Zevon presented an interesting jux
taposition: "Jungle Work" and "Not Fade Away." The
first depicts the life of a soldier-of-fortune ("Strength
and muscle and jungle work") fading into the second, a
Buddy Holly classic ("I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna
be/You're gonna give your love to me"). This quirki
ness is a hallmark of all of his concerts. However, he
did reaffirm our faith in him; he is one of the most enig
matic and brilliant solo performers anywhere.
