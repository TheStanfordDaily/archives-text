## Host Card Captures Cross Country Title 
### BILL JACKSON Staff writer 
Yesterday, for the first time since Stan
ford joined the Pacific 10 Conference for
cross country, the Cardinal men captured
the team title at the annual Pac-10 Cham
pionships.
Best of all, the men succeeded before a
home town crowd — the meet was run on
the Stanford Golf Course.
With the addition of the Cardinal women's
convincing victory and individual women's
champion last Saturday at the Pacific West
Championships in Los Angles, this week
should go down as one of the Stanford har
riers' greatest.
The men's squad, which edged out a vic
tory in the 10-team meet, was paced by
workhorse Marc Olesen, who dominated
the competition to earn individual laurels.
Olesen broke from the pack at about the
four-mile mark. By the five-mile mark his
lead had increased to 50 yards. From then
on, he was untouchable.
Following Olesen was Peter Koech of
Washington State University and Mark
McMonigal of Oregon in second and third,
respectively. Olesen's winning time of
30:33.2 over the 10-kilometer course was
nearly 20 seconds ahead of that of Koech.
Stanford's second finisher, Ryan Stoll,
finished fourth overall in a time of 30:57.8.
The Cardinal's third spot was filled by fifth
year senior and co-captain Jeff Atkinson.
He placed seventh overall in 31:06.0.
Though the first three Stanford runners
placed at the top of the field, the outcome
remained doubtful until the end. With run
ners from Oregon and UCLA barreling
across the line, the crowd gazed down the
course looking for Stanford's fourth and
fifth men. Quickly freshman James Al
borough came into sight and sped past the
line in 31:33.9, good enough for 17th place.
Still, the competition for team crowns was
up for grabs.
To spark Stanford's last man on the
course, sophomore Steve Schadler, fans
began chanting "Shags! Shags!" Shortly
thereafter, Schadler came into view.
Straining every muscle, Schadler put his
head down and crossed the line in 31st
place with a time of 32:17.0.
When it was over, Stanford team had
earned its first Pac-10 Cross Country
Championship victory. The squad ended
with 60 points. Rounding out the top five
teams were Oregon (75 points), UCLA
(102), Arizona (116) and Washington State
(128).
"We did what we had to do," Atkinson
said, amidst complete jubilation at the finish
line. Even as the trophy was presented to
the Stanford squad, cross country Coach
Brooks Johnson could only marvel at the ac
complishments of his team this season. In
fact, despite an obvious victory, Johnson
couldn't quite grasp that his team had
captured the Pac-10 Championship until the

official results came out some 20 minutes
later.
Senior Ryan Stoll could have spoken for
the entire team when he breathed simply, "I
ran hard," as he was swamped by his
teammates and well-wishers at the finish. It
was Stoll who seemed to bounce back the
most after his mediocre performance at the
Wisconsin/Burger King Invitational last
month.
However, when all was said and done, it
was junior Marc Olesen who was basking in
the limelight. His superb performance was
typical of his races this season. With the
NCAA Championships looming on the
horizon (Nov. 25), he appears to be a for
midable threat to take individual honors.
The team, as a whole would also appear to
be rounding into form.
The only obstacle is the District-8 Cham
pionships to be held in Seattle, Washington,
on Nov. 16. To qualify for the NCAAs,

Stanford must place among the first three
teams or place individuals among the top
three spots.
In women's action, the Cardinal romped
Saturday through its league competition in
Los Angeles at the Pac-West Conference
Championships. The field included league
rivals like UCLA, Arizona, USC and
Arizona State. Stanford's point total of 31
bested runner-up UCLA's 42.
That result suggests that the women
have regrouped after last month's poor
showing in Wisconsin, and have gone a long
way toward reestablishing Stanford's cross
country superiority in the west.
Leading the way for the Cardinal runners
was senior and All-America Regina Jacobs.
Her time of 16:45 was good enough to
capture the individual title, too.
Running third for the Cardinal and fifth
overall was Stacey Zartler (17:41).

(128).
"We did what we had to do," Atkinson
said, amidst complete jubilation at the finish
line. Even as the trophy was presented to
the Stanford squad, cross country Coach
Brooks Johnson could only marvel at the ac
complishments of his team this season. In
fact, despite an obvious victory, Johnson
couldn't quite grasp that his team had
captured the Pac-10 Championship until the

official results came out some 20 minutes
later.
Senior Ryan Stoll could have spoken for
the entire team when he breathed simply, "I
ran hard," as he was swamped by his
teammates and well-wishers at the finish. It
was Stoll who seemed to bounce back the
most after his mediocre performance at the
Wisconsin/Burger King Invitational last
month.
However, when all was said and done, it
was junior Marc Olesen who was basking in
the limelight. His superb performance was
typical of his races this season. With the
NCAA Championships looming on the
horizon (Nov. 25), he appears to be a for
midable threat to take individual honors.
The team, as a whole would also appear to
be rounding into form.
The only obstacle is the District-8 Cham
pionships to be held in Seattle, Washington,
on Nov. 16. To qualify for the NCAAs,

Stanford must place among the first three
teams or place individuals among the top
three spots.
In women's action, the Cardinal romped
Saturday through its league competition in
Los Angeles at the Pac-West Conference
Championships. The field included league
rivals like UCLA, Arizona, USC and
Arizona State. Stanford's point total of 31
bested runner-up UCLA's 42.
That result suggests that the women
have regrouped after last month's poor
showing in Wisconsin, and have gone a long
way toward reestablishing Stanford's cross
country superiority in the west.
Leading the way for the Cardinal runners
was senior and All-America Regina Jacobs.
Her time of 16:45 was good enough to
capture the individual title, too.
Running third for the Cardinal and fifth
overall was Stacey Zartler (17:41).

Senior Jeff Atkinson, a co-captain, completed yesterday's 10-kilometer, Pac
10 Cross Country Championship on the Stanford Golf Course in 31:06.0 to
place seventh among the 67 entrants.
Yesterday, for the first time since Stan
ford joined the Pacific 10 Conference for
cross country, the Cardinal men captured
the team title at the annual Pac-10 Cham
pionships.
Best of all, the men succeeded before a
home town crowd — the meet was run on
the Stanford Golf Course.
With the addition of the Cardinal women's
convincing victory and individual women's
champion last Saturday at the Pacific West
Championships in Los Angles, this week
should go down as one of the Stanford har
riers' greatest.
The men's squad, which edged out a vic
tory in the 10-team meet, was paced by
workhorse Marc Olesen, who dominated
the competition to earn individual laurels.
Olesen broke from the pack at about the
four-mile mark. By the five-mile mark his
lead had increased to 50 yards. From then
on, he was untouchable.
Following Olesen was Peter Koech of
Washington State University and Mark
McMonigal of Oregon in second and third,
respectively. Olesen's winning time of
30:33.2 over the 10-kilometer course was
nearly 20 seconds ahead of that of Koech.
Stanford's second finisher, Ryan Stoll,
finished fourth overall in a time of 30:57.8.
The Cardinal's third spot was filled by fifth
year senior and co-captain Jeff Atkinson.
He placed seventh overall in 31:06.0.
Though the first three Stanford runners
placed at the top of the field, the outcome
remained doubtful until the end. With run
ners from Oregon and UCLA barreling
across the line, the crowd gazed down the
course looking for Stanford's fourth and
fifth men. Quickly freshman James Al
borough came into sight and sped past the
line in 31:33.9, good enough for 17th place.
Still, the competition for team crowns was
up for grabs.
To spark Stanford's last man on the
course, sophomore Steve Schadler, fans
began chanting "Shags! Shags!" Shortly
thereafter, Schadler came into view.
Straining every muscle, Schadler put his
head down and crossed the line in 31st
place with a time of 32:17.0.
When it was over, Stanford team had
earned its first Pac-10 Cross Country
Championship victory. The squad ended
with 60 points. Rounding out the top five
teams were Oregon (75 points), UCLA
(102), Arizona (116) and Washington State
(128).
"We did what we had to do," Atkinson
said, amidst complete jubilation at the finish
line. Even as the trophy was presented to
