# Stanford Imports Canada's Olesen

Marc Olesen may not be the best
Canadian export to hit the Stanford
campus since Molson's Golden, but he's
pretty close.
At least that's probably what his
teammates on the men's cross country
team think after the junior from Con
federation High School in Nepean, On
tario led them to Stanford's first-ever
Pac-10 championship with a first-place
individual finish.
Indeed, Canada's loss has been Stan

ford's gain. But America's northern
neighbor didn't give up its running
phenom without a fight.
"In Canada there's a lot of pressure on
their athletes to stay in Canada," Olesen
said. "Most people in Canada were
saying I should stay. There's a big myth
up there about top athletes coming down
to the States and getting burned out."
Olesen, however, decided to leave his
home country, where he had starred in
junior international competitions, and do
his collegiate running in sunny California.
