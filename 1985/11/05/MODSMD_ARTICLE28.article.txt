# Stanford Imports Canada's Olesen
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Staff writer 
Marc Olesen may not be the best
Canadian export to hit the Stanford
campus since Molson's Golden, but he's
pretty close.
At least that's probably what his
teammates on the men's cross country
team think after the junior from Con
federation High School in Nepean, On
tario led them to Stanford's first-ever
Pac-10 championship with a first-place
individual finish.
Indeed, Canada's loss has been Stan

ford's gain. But America's northern
neighbor didn't give up its running
phenom without a fight.
"In Canada there's a lot of pressure on
their athletes to stay in Canada," Olesen
said. "Most people in Canada were
saying I should stay. There's a big myth
up there about top athletes coming down
to the States and getting burned out."
Olesen, however, decided to leave his
home country, where he had starred in
junior international competitions, and do
his collegiate running in sunny California.

Marc Olesen's intense training program is, according to teammates, a
key to his success.
"It was mainly a running deci
sion," Olesen said. "The weather
was a big factor. My parents and
the people who were close to me
were going to support me wher
ever I'd go. I also didn't believe any
of the burnout thing,"
Some people in the Canadian
track world still question Olesen's
choice, though.
"I missed the Olympic team by
less than a second (in the 1,500
meters)," Olesen said. "I guess
some people could have thought be
cause I came down here I didn't
make the (Canadian) team, but that
has no relevance whatsoever."
A torn foot muscle suffered
before last year's Pac-10 Outdoor
Track Championships effectively
ended Olesen's summer track
season â€” and kept him from com
peting internationally for his native
country.
However, Olesen did tote the
Canadian maple leaf in the Senior
World Cross Country Champion
ships. He also copped 39th, 19th
and eighth-place finishes in three
years of competition at the Junior
Worlds.
Coming off his top 10 finish in the
world championships, Olesen expe
rienced mixed results as a Stanford
freshman.
"Freshman year was different,
very different," Olesen said. "I was
happy with it, and I was unhappy
with it. In cross country, I ran well.
(But) I missed NC(AA)s by one
place and that was disappointing."
Outdoor track was a similar
mixture of success and disappoint
ment for Olesen. His school record
performance in the 1,500 meters
(3:41.7) was closely followed by a
bout with bronchitis.
Olesen bloomed last year in
cross country as he topped off a
season in which he placed first
among Stanford runners in every
meet. He also finished 31st at the
NCAAs.
"Sophomore year was better,"
Olesen said. "Cross country went
pretty well for me. The only prob
lem with cross country was that
NCs were anticlimactic. I put too
much emphasis on getting there

(and) not on running there."
Olesen's foot injury this spring
knocked him out of a Pac-10 5,000-
meter race he was favored to win,
and kept him from training until Au
gust.
"I wasn't very fit at the beginning
of the season because of the in
jury," Olesen said.
He has, nevertheless, rounded
into shape quickly as was seen by a
fifth-place finish at the prestigious
Wisconsin/Burger King Invitational
in Madison, Wise., on Oct. 12,
and yesterday's Pac-10 individual
championship.
"Wisconsin was a good race for
me," he said. "I think I could have
placed a little higher if I was more
race tough. I feel really ready for
the upcoming big three races
(yesterday's Pac-10, the District-8
on Nov. 16 and the NCAAs on Nov.
25). I'd like to finish in the top five
(at the NCAA's). I think it's within
my capabilities."
Cross country Coach Brooks
Johnson is confident of his stan
dout's potential.

"He has a fantastic ability to get
himself ready for the big races,"
Johnson said. "Almost anybody has
potential, because nobody explores
their limits to the maximum. He's
one of the ones most likely to reach
his potential."
Olesen's success can be attrib
uted to a grueling training regimen
that has him to run over 70 miles a
week.
"It's easy to back out," Olesen
said of his workouts. "It's easy to
slow down, but for me when I'm
training, I think about my racing. I
don't want to get beat."
Senior teammate and cross
country captain Jeff Atkinson called
Olesen "the hardest worker I've
ever seen in my life."
"He just basically trains harder
than everyone else," Atkinson
added. "He trains hard six days a
week. Most people can only do
three or two. He has the constitu
tion to just go out and hammer
every day."
Olesen, a wiry 5-foot-10, 140
pounder, also possesses the potent
combination of a middle-distance

runner's speed and the strength
and stamina of a distance man.
"My biggest strongpoint is that I
have a combination of both," he
said.
"He's a power runner," Atkinson
said. "He's like a freight train. He
lags off the leaders and then just
hammers from about two miles
out."
Olesen, an economics major, has
Olympic aspirations and hopes to
continue running after his Stanford
career ends.
"To me, my running is the most
important thing in my life," he said.
"After school, that's going to have
number one priority. My goals are
definitely the major championship
meets."
"I think he's probably the Bruce
Springsteen of cross country run
ning," Johnson said of Olesen. "I
think Bruce is the Boss. There's no
frills. What you see is what you
get."
Olesen may be the Boss when it
comes to running, but he wasn't
"Born in the USA."
