# Maples Mismatch With Santa Clara
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
Somebody trying to sell
tonight's women's volleyball
match between Stanford and
Santa Clara at Maples Pavilion
would be in for a very difficult
task. It would be comparable to
attempting to generate interest in
a basketball game between the
Los Angeles Lakers and the In
diana Pacers.
Stanford is, by consensus, the
No. 1 team in the nation — 17-1
overall — and coming off of strong
showings against USC and
Arizona State over the weekend.
Santa Clara, on the other hand, is
suffering through a dismal season.
Psychologically, the Broncos
are at a disadvantage. They were
humiliated by the Cardinal on
Oct. 10 by scores of 15-1, 15-7
and 15-4. And that match was on
Santa Clara's homecourt.
Tonight they are up against the
proverbial home-court advantage
in its most frightening form. They
must play in Maples, where the
Cardinal women have not lost a
match in two years. Opponents
enter with hopes of knocking off
the nation's top team and, shortly
thereafter, are sent home in disar
ray.
By now, it should be apparent
that Santa Clara is in over its head
tonight. But wait. That's not all.
Stacy MacDonough and Siobhan
Saunders — the Broncos top two
hitters — have hitting percent

ages of only .260 and .243,
respectively. Cardinal ace Kim
Oden is hitting at a .342 clip.
Then again, comparing Oden
with MacDonough and Saunders is
like comparing apples and
oranges. There is no comparison.
Oden, a three-time All-America,
was Volleyball Monthly's Player of
the Year for 1984.
In short, tonight's match should
be more of a mismatch.
Interested spectators should
not fret, however. At least one
person — Cardinal Co-coach Don
Shaw — is not willing to chalk up a
victory just yet.
"They (Santa Clara) have got
some wins against some pretty
good teams," Shaw said in the
typically cautious manner of a
coach of a heavily-favored team.
Shaw admitted that Santa Clara
is not in the class of the Pac-West
teams that Stanford normally
plays. Nevertheless, he expects
the Cardinal women to be
motivated tonight when they take
to the floor.
"We have a standard that we al
ways want to play to," Shaw ex
plained.
Tonight's match is the Card
inal's last before traveling to
UCLA Friday for what may be
their most important match of the
season. For that reason, Shaw
would like to see a strong perfor
mance tonight as a tune-up for the
match with the Bruins.
Most importantly, though, since
the Pac-West is not considered to
be a legitimate conference by the

NCAA, non-conference matches
assume the importance of confer
ence matches. The Cardinal's
placement in the playoffs will be
determined by their overall
ranking, and not solely by their
conference ranking.
If the Cardinal women can stay
among the nation's top four teams
by the end of the season, they will

probably receive a tirst-round bye
in the playoffs and will, in Shaw's
words, "have a good shot" at
hosting the regionals.
Thus, each match is important.
And, needless to say, a loss to
Santa Clara would immediately
drop the Cardinal out of the No. 1
spot and could be devastating to
their national ranking.
