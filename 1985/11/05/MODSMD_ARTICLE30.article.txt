ST. LOUIS (AP) — Neil Lomax
brought St. Louis to life with a 46-
yard touchdown pass to Pat Tilley

clinching toss to J.T. Smith with
four minutes to play as the Car

streak by beating the Dallas Cow
boys 21-10 in a National Football
League game last night.
The St. Louis comeback from a
10-0 halftime deficit dropped Dal
las, now 6-3, into a first-place tie

While St. Louis staggered against
the Cowboy defense, Dallas built a
10-0 halftime advantage on Danny
White's eight-yard pass to Drew
Hill and a 19-yard field goal by
Rafael Septien.
St. Louis caught fire on its first
possession after halftime, with
Lomax's 10-yard pass to Doug
Marsh lighting the fuse on an 81-
yard drive. Lomax followed with a
13-yarder to Tilley, and the Cards
picked up an additional 15 yards on
a roughing penalty. Lomax then
connected with Tilley on the long
touchdown play to cut the Dallas
advantage to 10-7 with 12:05 left in
the period.
Television replays of the play ap
peared to show that Tilley spiked
the ball before reaching the end
zone, but the play was ruled a
touchdown.
The Cardinals moved 65 yards on

their next possession for the go
ahead touchdown. Lomax com
pleted passes of 11 yards to Smith
and 15 and lz yards to Tilley to set
the stage for Earl Ferrell's eight
yard touchdown run with 4:07 left

While the Cardinal offense rolled,
the Dallas offense was continually
frustrated throughout the second
half by an aroused St. Louis
defense that forced two turnovers.
St. Louis moved 80 yards in 10
plays for the clinching score. Stump
Mitchell ran 21 yards and then took
a Lomax pass for 25 to put the Car
dinals on the Dallas 42. Lomax hit
Smith for gains of 10 and 19 yards
before connecting with Smith on a
nine-yard scoring play with 4:13 left
in the game.
It was the Cards' third straight
Monday-night victory over Dallas,
which had won 11 of the previous
13 games between the teams, in
cluding the last three at Busch
Stadium.
Lomax completed 17 of 32
passes for 260 yards while White
made good on 21 of 36 for 203
yards with one interception. The
win moved St. Louis out of the cel
lar in the NFC Eastern division.
The Cards stand two games back of
division leaders Dallas and the New
York Giants, both 6-3. Resurgent
Washington is a game out of the top
spot at 5-4. Philadelphia languishes
at the bottom of the heap with a 4-5
mark.
