# Perry Eats up Fat Ad Offers

### 
CHICAGO (AP) — William "The
Refrigerator" Perry, who is paid to
push his massive self away from the
dining table, may soon be pushing
hamburgers, french fries and other
fast-food temptations, as well as
real refrigerators.
The Chicago Bears' 308-pound
rookie defensive tackle, whose
girth makes him worth plenty to ad
vertisers, stands to profit more
from his endorsements this season
than from his four-year, $1.35 mil
lion contract with the National
Football League club.
"I don't know of a hotter prop
erty in the country right now," his
agent, Jim Steiner of St. Louis
based Bry & Associates, said yes
terday.
McDonald's, Coca Cola, and, of
course, refrigerator-makers Gen
eral Electric and Whirlpool are
hungry for endorsements from the
22-year-old Perry, who says a deci

sion is expected in about two
weeks.
"They (offers) are coming in at
the rate of 15 an hour," said
Steiner, whose firm represents
more than 100 athletes, including
the New York Mets' Darryl Straw
berry, Kellen Winslow of the San
Diego Chargers and the St. Louis
Cardinals' Vince Coleman.
Offers were coming in even
before Perry became an important
factor on offense, scoring a touch
down and clearing the way for two
TDs by Walter Payton against
Green Bay two weeks ago. He vic
timized the Packers again Sunday,
catching the first touchdown pass of
his career as the Bears defeated
Green Bay 16-10, raising their
record to 9-0.
That earned him yesterday's ap
pearance on the CBS Morning
News, plus a front-page story in
USA Today.
Among the companies lining up
to sign Perry are a toy maker which
wants to market a William Perry
robot, a manufacturer of hospital
scrub suits and a thermal under
wear company, Steiner said.
His 120-pound wife, Sherry, is
keeping him on a lean diet of baked
chicken, vegetables and fruit. Perry
said he didn't know if a slimmer
profile would cost him fans, but
added, "I'm sure trying to get un
der 300 pounds."
The massive new Bear has taken
Chicago by storm.
And the robust rookie is to ap
pear Nov. 11 on The David Letter
man Show.
