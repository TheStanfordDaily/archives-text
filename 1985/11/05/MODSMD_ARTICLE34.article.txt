Sakharov OK, Talks to Family
WASHINGTON — Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, speaking for
the first time in six years with family members in the United States,
said yesterday he had ended a previously unreported hunger strike
in a Gorky hospital.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner undertook the 44-day fast, the
most recent of several he has staged to protest actions by the Soviet
government, in an apparently successful attempt to force Moscow to
allow his wife, Yelena Bonner, to travel to the West for medical
treatment.
"He now weighs 72 kilos (158 pounds)," Bonner told her daughter
and son-in-law during the call, which was made from a post office in
Gorky, 250 miles from Moscow, where the couple is in internal exile.
"His normal weight is 30 kilos (176 pounds). He's gaining one kilo
each day."
Bonner said her husband, 64, weighed only about 130 pounds
when she was told late last month she could leave Russia for three
months for medical care.
"He appeared to be very excited," said Tatyana Yankelevich, Bon
ner's daughter, who lives in Newton, Mass. "They (Russian officials)
want us to know he is alive."
Both Yankelevich and her husband, Efrem, said they believed that
the Nov. 19-20 summit between President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev played a role in the Soviets' decision to let Bonner
travel.
"It was very clear from what (Bonner) said that the Soviets only
allowed her to go because of the summit," Yankelevich said. "It's
very clear that they did not want Sakharov on a hunger strike during
the summit."
Soldier To Return to U.S.S.R.
WASHINGTON — The five-day standoff over a young Soviet sol
dier who took refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan,
ended yesterday after the Soviet ambassador promised that he
would not be punished and the soldier left voluntarily, the State De
partment announced.
Department spokesman Charles Redman released a detailed ac
count that said the soldier, identified as Alexander Sukhanov, 19, a
private, signed a statement in Russian declaring that he had made his
decision "of his own free will and wants to go home."
The account provided a day-by-day description of the steps taken
by U.S. personnel since Thursday, when Sukhanov, a guard at Radio
Afghanistan next to the embassy, entered the U.S. compound and
declared that he "was unhappy with a soldier's life in Afghanistan."
According to the account, acting U.S. Ambassador Edward Hur
witz directed that Sukhanov be told "that he would not, under any
circumstances, be forcibly expelled from the embassy grounds or
returned to Soviet custody against his will."
Sukhanov initially was unwilling to accede to requests from Soviet
Ambassador Fikryat Tabeyev for a meeting. However, on Sunday
the soldier reconsidered, and the meeting took place that afternoon.
Tabeyev expressed hope that Sukhanov would return to Soviet
custody, but the soldier asked for more time to think. A second
meeting occurred yesterday.
At that meeting, the account continued, Sukhanov said he wanted
to return to the Soviet Union. Hurwitz assured him that the United
States would continue to provide refuge, and, if he wished, "we
would make every effort to get him into the United States in asylum
status," according to the department.
After Sukhanov reiterated his decision to return, Hurwitz
reviewed Soviet assurances that the soldier had committed no
crime, would not be prosecuted or subjected to punishment and
would be returned to the Soviet Union. Tabeyev "stated that these
were indeed his assurances," but the ambassador added that he
could not rule out the possibility that Sukhanov might be
reprimanded by the communist youth organization, Komsomol.
The soldier then signed the statement declaring that he was
leaving "freely, without restraint."
ANC Speaks, Press Law Defied
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — In an interview published
here yesterday that both defied South Africa's strict press laws and
marked the first full statement by the underground African National
Congress to appear here in nearly a quarter of a century, congress
leader Oliver Tambo urged Pretoria to create a climate in which talks
about the country's future could begin.
Insisting that the congress was neither anti-white nor communist
led, Tambo said he was ready to declare a truce in its guerrilla
struggle against the apartheid system if Pretoria would release the
organization's jailed president, Nelson Mandela, and other political
prisoners as an indication that it was serious about negotiations.
His statement appeared in a lengthy interview, conducted in Lon
don, with the editor of South Africa's leading liberal newspaper, The
Cape Times of Cape Town, which defied stringent security laws
prohibiting the publication of statements by certain individuals and
organizations.
Heard quoted Tambo as denying that the organization was anti
white.
"The ANC, all of us in the ANC, have always accepted that the
whites, like ourselves, belong to our country. They are compatriots,
fellow citizens," Tambo said.
Asked what reassurances an ANC-led government would offer the
whites, T ambo replied: "What we would hope our white compatriots
will learn to understand is that we don't really see them as whites in
the first instance. We see them as fellow South Africans. We see
them as Africans. We were all born there in that country ... so let's
move away from these distinctions of whites and nonwhites."
Marcos Begins Campaigning
MANILA. Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos plunged into
campaigning yesterday, hours after his surprise call for a presidential
election, and told voters in typhoon-devasted central Luzon that he
wanted to put to rest opposition clamor for a snap vote.
Government television, reporting the president's barnstorming
activities, said the voting would take place Jan. 17.
Arevalo Wins in Guatemala
GUATEMALA CITY — Christian Democrat Vinicio Arevalo won
the first round of Guatemala's presidential election with a surprising
margin of nearly 2-1 over the runner-up, officials announced yester
day.
Cerezo promptly urged his top opponent to drop out of the runoff,
which he called "a formality." But second-place finisher Jorge Nicolle
of the National Union of the Center said he will stay in the race to
become the country's first civilian president in 16 years.
