# Reagan Says SDI Deployment Depends on Ban
## Izvestia publishes its version of Reagan interview 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan said in
an interview with Soviet journalists published
yesterday that the deployment of his proposed
space-based missile defense system would come
only after an agreement to eliminate offensive
nuclear missiles.
However, many controversial passages of the
interview were deleted for the version that was
printed in the Soviet newspaper Izvestia.
The president appeared to be adding a major
new element to the U.S. plan for his Strategic
Defense Initiative, the "Star Wars" plan, which is
now in the research phase. Previously, Reagan
has said he hoped to make nuclear weapons ob
solete with the missile defense. In his new
remarks, Reagan suggested that he is making
elimination of the weapons a condition for
deployment of defensive weapons.
Moreover, Reagan expanded on his earlier
pledge to share the technology with the Soviets
by saying "the terms for getting it" would be
"the elimination of the offensive weapons."
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said
yesterday Reagan was describing publically an
idea he had mentioned privately to aides in
recent weeks. In the past, attempting to
describe his vision of strategic defense, Reagan

has often extended his rhetoric beyond the
policies of his Administration and the reality of its
research program. One official said Reagan's
latest comments were simply "the most
pristine" version of his hope for a world without
nuclear weapons.
Reagan's remarks came in a 42-minute ses
sion with four Soviet journalists in the Oval Of
fice Thursday. Parts of the interview were pub
lished yesterday in the Soviet government news
paper Izvestia, the first Soviet interview of an
American president in 24 years.
The White House had sought the interview to
put Reagan's views before the Soviet people
before the summit. Requests for a pre-summit
appearance by Reagan on Soviet television were
ignored, U.S. officials said.
In the interview, President Reagan president
bluntly recounted the 1979 Soviet-backed coup
in Afghanistan, batted back a question on U.S.
military operations abroad with an answer about
Soviet-occupied Warsaw Pact countries, and
complained about the tight-lipped Kremlin ap
proach to its own Star Wars-style space-based
missile defense program.
But when the interview appeared yesterday in
Moscow, such controversial responses were
deleted, along with other passages where the

Reagan refuted official Soviet policy explana
tions. Reagan's offer to share Star Wars re
search was deleted also, in keeping with official
depiction of his stance on the issue as hard-line
and intractable.
Declaring that Moscow has "taken over the
initiative in the political psychological prepara
tions" for the coming summit between Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, an exten
sive critique in Izvestia rebutted Reagan's
defense of U.S. arms control policy point by
point, and dismissed the interview as "nothing
new," "propaganda" and a distortion of facts.
Despite cautious official treatment of the in
terview, marked by editing, heavy criticism, and
low-keyed coverage, Muscovites have displayed
interest in this rare direct exposure to a U.S.
president's views.
Meanwhile, in Moscow, Secretary of State
George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze met for almost eight hours
yesterday to pave the way for the U.S.-Soviet
summit meeting just two weeks away.
The Soviet government press agency TASS
said that the two men and their aides discussed
security issues, "above all" nuclear and space
arms issues, in sessions that began just after
noon and continued until 7:50 p.m.
