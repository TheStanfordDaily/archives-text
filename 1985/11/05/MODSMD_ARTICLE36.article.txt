# Ex-Defector Accuses CIA of Kidnapping
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Vitaly Yur
chenko, a senior official of the So
viet KGB hailed as the most impor
tant defector to the West in years,
appeared at the Soviet residential
compound in Washington last night
to declare that he had not defected,
but rather was kidnapped three
months ago in Rome, drugged and
held in forced isolation by the
Central Intelligence Agency on an
estate near Fredericksburg, Va.
Reagan Administration officials
immediately disputed Yurchenko's
account, saying he came to the
United States voluntarily and, after

providing important information on
KGB operations to his CIA
debriefers, apparently developed
second thoughts, walked out of his
safe-house quarters and found his
way to the Soviet Embassy Satur
day night.
Sen. David Durenberger (R-
Minn.), chairman of the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence,
told reporters that Yurchenko was
scheduled to come to dinner at the
CIA Saturday night, but "never
showed up."
A senior intelligence official said
last night of Yurchenko's claim that

he was kidnapped, "It's all a
lie. . . . He defected and grew un
happy or it was a setup all along,
but at this point we doubt it."
A senior intelligence source said
last night that Yurchenko had
passed a series of lie detector tests
to establish his credibility as a
defector.
State Department spokesman
Charles Redman said last night, "At
no time was Mr. Yurchenko held or
coerced by improper, illegal or un
ethical means. It is Mr. Yur
chenko's right to return to the So
viet Union once the United States

government is, in fact, assured that
this action is genuinely of his own
choosing."
Yurchenko, 49, said last night
that he still has the Soviet
diplomatic passport he was carrying
when he traveled to Rome in July,
and hopes to return as soon as pos
sible to the Soviet Union to see his
wife and son, 16.
An intelligence source said last
night that Yurchenko had several
personal reasons that might have
led him to reconsider his defection,
including a "girlfriend" in the Soviet
Union.
