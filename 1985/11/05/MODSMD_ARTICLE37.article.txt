Gay Issues Reviewed
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court,
clearing the way for its first major gay rights
ruling in two decades, agreed yesterday to
decide whether the Constitution permits pro
secution of adult homosexuals for private con
sensual sex acts.
The court, in a brief order, said that it would
review the legality of a little-enforced Georgia
sodomy law that was found to violate the right
to privacy by a federal appellate panel in At
lanta last May. Homosexuals were entitled to
privacy protections just as married couples,
the panel concluded.
The new case before the court (Bowers vs.
Hardwick) began in 1982 when Atlanta police
arrested 28-year-old Michael Hardwick for
committing sodomy with another male in his
residence. Police had come to the home to
serve a summons to Hardwick on another
charge and were allowed to enter by a third
person.
Hardwick was never prosecuted, but he and
a married couple both filed suit challenging the
law, saying it violated their right to privacy. A
federal district court ruled the couple lacked
standing to sue because there was no evidence
the law would ever be enforced against them;
the court also dismissed Hardwick's action,
citing the Supreme Court's 1976 summary af

firmance of the Virginia sodomy law.
The appellate court, however, said that the
issue was not resolved by the 1976 action and
that Hardwick could pursue his suit. It said
that to win, Georgia authorities must meet the
very difficult legal burden of showing there
was a "compelling interest" in such a law.
Georgia Attorney General Michael Bowers
appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court,
saying that homosexual activity was entitled to
no such constitutional protection and that if up
held the decision could cast doubt on a wide ar
ray of statutes that restrict private conduct,
such as laws against suicide, prostitution,
polygamy and the personal possession and use
of marijuana.
Appeal To Block Ship
WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court
here was asked yesterday to block temporarily
the departure of a Soviet freighter on the Mis
sissippi River until U.S. officials can re
interview a Ukranian sailor to see if he wants
asylum.
Andrew Fylpovych of the Ukrainian-
American Bar Association argued that the gov
ernment had failed to follow federal immigra
tion law in its handling of the situation, which
has been going on since Oct. 24, when Miros
lav Medvid jumped into the river near New Or

leans. Fylpovych also said that the ship should
be detained until the law is properly carried
out.
Fylopovych told a three-judge panel of the
U.S. Court of Appeals that Border Patrol
agents who interviewed the sailor had not pro- *
vided Medvid with the forms required in
asylum situations and had failed to notify the
State Department immediately. Both proce
dures are required by immigration law, he
said.
In addition, said Fylpovych, four days after
patrol agents returned Medvid to the Soviet
ship, U.S. government officials again failed to
follow regulations because they re-interviewed
Medvid in the presence of Soviet authorities.
During that interview Medvid said he wanted
to return to the Soviet Union.
Market Trading Slows
NEW YORK — The stock market made
little headway in slackened trading yesterday,
pausing after last week's strong rally.
As the advance bogged down, attention
shifted again on Wall Street to stocks involved
in takeover news and rumors.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
33.73 points last week, dipped .57 to
1,389.68.
