Whale Reaches Ocean
SAN FRANCISCO — Humphrey the
wayward whale, lured by the recorded sounds
of feeding humpbacks, reached the freedom of
the Pacific Ocean yesterday after a three
week fresh-water cruise that made him a na
tional celebrity.
Racing at three knots against a rising tide,
the 40-foot, 45-ton behemoth cleared the fog
shrouded Golden Gate Bridge at 4:36 p.m.
PST as crewmen aboard a flotilla of military
and civilian boats cheered and waved goodbye.
Humphrey, who shook off two transmitters
shot into his skin with a crossbow as he neared
the end of a journey that took him 70 miles in
land, swam almost nine miles yesterday before
reaching the sea.
After leaping spectacularly, almost verti
cally, early in the day and swimming playfully
in circles, the rare and endangered humpback
sped two miles, then paused several hours to

frolic beneath the San Rafael-Richmond
Bridge, six miles from the Golden Gate.
He started moving again with the flood tide
in mid-afternoon, nosing in and out of San
Francisco Bay and spouting water as 10 Navy
boats chased him and clanged pipes to keep
him going.
Embarcadero May Go
SAN FRANCISCO — City supervisors pon
dered a plan yesterday to tear down the pri
mary downtown freeway and replace it with a
tree-lined boulevard.
While this city has traffic problems like most
others, officials argued that the aesthetic
benefits of getting rid of the roadway many
consider an eyesore outweigh a slight increase
in travel time for downtown workers.
The plan has the support of the mayor,
several supervisors and the city's planning de

partment, but has run into opposition from
some who claim there's really no good reason
to raze the roadway and make life harder for
commuters.
At issue is the Embarcadero Freeway, a
mile-long, double-deck concrete hulk that
separates the city's downtown section from
the San Francisco Bay.
If supervisors approve plans to raze the
elevated roadway, the proposal still faces a
possible veto by the regional Metropolitan
Transportation Commission or the governor.
Tearing down the Embarcadero Freeway
will cost about $10 million, according to city
estimate, but the whole project envisioned for
the waterfront will come to about $171 million,
so the federal cash is crucial, officials say.
Both San Mateo County to the south and
Alameda County to the east have also gone on
record as opposing the plan, claiming it will
make life a lot harder for their residents who
commute to the city.
