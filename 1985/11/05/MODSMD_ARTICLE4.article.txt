# Kaplan Report Criticizes Police
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
A University investigation of al
leged police brutality at an Oct. 11
sit-in found police actions "wrong
and unjustifiable" but called for no
specific disciplinary action against
Stanford officers.
Nine students were arrested in
the Old Union sit-in, which was
staged to protest University invest
ments in companies doing business
in South Africa. The University in
vestigation, commissioned by Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
and conducted by Law Prof. John
Kaplan, centered on possible
brutality during the removal of four
of the arrestees.
Kaplan's report was released
yesterday after a 45-minute closed
meeting with Kennedy, the stu
dents arrested at the sit-in, Stan
ford Police Chief Marvin Herrington
and Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons.
In the report, Kaplan calls the
events that took place at North
County Jail in Palo Alto, where
some of the students were taken
after their arrest, "far murkier"
than the events at Old Union. Stan
ford senior Robby Perkins said he
was beaten at the jail during a strip
search.
The report states that Perkins
"emerged with a considerable num
ber of such (bruises) . . . certainly
consistent with his having received
an unlawful beating."
Perkins met with his lawyer last
night to discuss filing charges

against the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's office.
The report states that Kaplan
was "unable to find precisely what
happened in the jail. The differing
accounts, particularly as to what
went on in the strip search room,
are sufficiently different in their
most important points, while at the
same time being so superficially
similar that it would take cross ex
amination of both sides to come to
judgment on the facts."
Kennedy, according to a report
from University News Service, ac
cepted responsibility for
"inappropriate techniques" used by
police during the arrests. Ken
nedy's comments came during a
closed meeting with Bob Beyers,
director of the University News
Service.
"Both I Kaplan] and I concede in
appropriate techniques were used
and I take responsibility for that,"
Kennedy said.
"Chief Herrington also agreed
that we will encourage use of name
tags" for police officers, a recom
mendation made by Kaplan, Ken
nedy said.
"We will continue to encourage
officers to provide their names,
when asked, in situations where
that's possible," he said.
Kennedy agreed with Kaplan's
recommendation that no action be
taken against police officers, stating
that "accordingly I do not see a
need for it."
Kennedy did, however, acknowl
edge that students present at the
