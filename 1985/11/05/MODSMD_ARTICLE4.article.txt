# Kaplan Report Criticizes Police
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
A University investigation of al
leged police brutality at an Oct. 11
sit-in found police actions "wrong
and unjustifiable" but called for no
specific disciplinary action against
Stanford officers.
Nine students were arrested in
the Old Union sit-in, which was
staged to protest University invest
ments in companies doing business
in South Africa. The University in
vestigation, commissioned by Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
and conducted by Law Prof. John
Kaplan, centered on possible
brutality during the removal of four
of the arrestees.
Kaplan's report was released
yesterday after a 45-minute closed
meeting with Kennedy, the stu
dents arrested at the sit-in, Stan
ford Police Chief Marvin Herrington
and Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons.
In the report, Kaplan calls the
events that took place at North
County Jail in Palo Alto, where
some of the students were taken
after their arrest, "far murkier"
than the events at Old Union. Stan
ford senior Robby Perkins said he
was beaten at the jail during a strip
search.
The report states that Perkins
"emerged with a considerable num
ber of such (bruises) . . . certainly
consistent with his having received
an unlawful beating."
Perkins met with his lawyer last
night to discuss filing charges

against the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's office.
The report states that Kaplan
was "unable to find precisely what
happened in the jail. The differing
accounts, particularly as to what
went on in the strip search room,
are sufficiently different in their
most important points, while at the
same time being so superficially
similar that it would take cross ex
amination of both sides to come to
judgment on the facts."
Kennedy, according to a report
from University News Service, ac
cepted responsibility for
"inappropriate techniques" used by
police during the arrests. Ken
nedy's comments came during a
closed meeting with Bob Beyers,
director of the University News
Service.
"Both I Kaplan] and I concede in
appropriate techniques were used
and I take responsibility for that,"
Kennedy said.
"Chief Herrington also agreed
that we will encourage use of name
tags" for police officers, a recom
mendation made by Kaplan, Ken
nedy said.
"We will continue to encourage
officers to provide their names,
when asked, in situations where
that's possible," he said.
Kennedy agreed with Kaplan's
recommendation that no action be
taken against police officers, stating
that "accordingly I do not see a
need for it."
Kennedy did, however, acknowl
edge that students present at the
meeting "obviously were not
satisfied" at Kaplan's failure to rec
ommend such action.
Several students arrested at the
sit-in offered sharp criticism of
Kennedy's response to the Kaplan
report.
Cam Baker, one of the nine ar
restees, said that Kennedy
"refused to see any one person as
responsible" for the alleged in
stances of police brutality and called
the report "a bogus thing."
Peter Heslin, another arrestee at
the meeting, said that Kennedy
"said that he was responsible to
many constituencies within the
Stanford community. However, his
analysis of what happened gave no
importance whatsoever to the pain
incurred by the protesters. Clearly
one of the constituencies he's not
responsible to is the health and
safety of Stanford students."
Eric Diesel, also arrested on
Oct. 11, complained that the stu
dents "weren't given the op
porunity to ask questions and read
[the report] before" the meeting.
He called the meeting a "public re
lations" event.
Perkins, however, did not com
ment on the report, stating that he

had not thoroughly read the docu
ment. "It's just too early to judge,"
he said.
Kaplan's report is based largely
upon accounts of the day submitted
by eight of the arrestees, inter
views with members of the Stan
ford Police Department and two
video tapes shot at Old Union, one
by police and one by Glen Baker, a
student.
"In short, it seems to me that the
use of the control hold as a means
of carrying the four students who
went limp was, under the condi
tions at Old Union, inappropriate
and was not what the community
has a right to expect of the Stanford
Police Department and, indeed,
what it has come to expect of that
department," Kaplan states in the
report.
Kaplan's investigation states that
Stanford officers exerted "their
force on the students' wrists . . .
not only twisting the wrists but also
pressing upward upon the shoulder
muscles.
"This means of carrying some
one, first of all, is extremely painful
because of the pressure exerted on
the soft tissue in the shoulder area.
Moreover, in the opinion of a medi
cal school professor I consulted on
this issue, such a procedure threat
ens the likelihood of dislocation of
the shoulder."

The report, however, states that
the procedures used during the ar
rest are "the generally accepted
means of handling protesters who
go limp" and that part of the prob
lem was "simply a shortage of man
power," noting that 12 officers
were available to handle the sit-in
and cover the rest of the campus.
The report also commends the
Stanford police for changing the
methods for handling limp
protesters, noting that at a sit-in
five days later the police had
"procured slings which permitted
the safe and painless carriage of ar
restees by four officers."
Kaplan was commissioned by
Kennedy to investigate the arrests
on Oct. 16, five days after the inci
dent occurred. His full report will
be printed tomorrow in Campus
Report.
