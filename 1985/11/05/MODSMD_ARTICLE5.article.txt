# Jews Face Immigration Block

"The situation today is
profoundly depressing in terms of
the possibility of any serious exo
dus of Soviet Jews," an author and
historian told an audience of more
than 50 at Cubberley Auditorium
last night.
Martin Gilbert described the
"deteriorating situation" for the So
viet Union's two million Jews,
pointing to 12,000 to 15,000
"refusniks" who have been refused
exit visas.
Gilbert, who authored "The Jews
of Hope: The Plight of Soviet Jews
Today" after meeting with many
refusniks in 1983, said that a visit to
the Soviet Union seven weeks ago
as a guest of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences left him feeling that there
is an increasing demoralization
among the "ever smaller circle" of
the 2,000 to 3,000 activists who, by
"trying to carry out some form of

open Jewishness in their lives,"
have made themselves the targets
of increasing denunciation by the
press, as well as threats and
repression by the government.
"What struck me most on my
return was the continuing
deteriorization of the situation,"
Gilbert said.
He said that at the time of his
first visit, "the gates of emigration
had been effectively closed for
three years" after a period during
which thousands of Soviet Jews had
been allowed to leave the Soviet
Union. At that time, refusniks were
"warned that the gates wouldn't
easily re-open and the pressures
against them would increase," he
said, noting that the government
has kept those threats.
The number of Jews sentenced
to several years of hard labor for
teaching Hebrew, writing to Israeli
officials or engaging in other religi
ous activities that the Soviets con
sider disloyal to the state is on the
rise, he said.

Castigation of Jews in the schools
is also severe, Gilbert said.
"Teachers use the schoolboy as an
example of what anti-Soviet think
ing and activity could lead to," he
said.
In the press, Jewish activists are
"increasingly denounced ... by
name and with their photographs"
and Judaism is attacked in
newspapers and on television "as a
religion that encourages deceit" and
takes orders from "an anti-Soviet"
world Jewish movement, according
to Gilbert.
Several recent events indicate
the extreme unlikelihood of both a
change in Soviet policy toward the
Jews, and a serious push for such a
change by the American govern
ment, he said.
The American response to a
"comprehensive exit-visa agree
ment, phased so as not to open the
floodgates" of emigration, was also
discouraging, said Gilbert. Made by
