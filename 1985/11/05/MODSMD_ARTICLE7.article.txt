Two middle-aged women walk up

"Go ahead, ask him," says one
woman.
"This wasn't my idea," says the
other. Both giggle.
"All right, all right," says the first
woman, turning to face the man be

want to know how tall Paul New
man is."
The man doesn't even blink. "Go
down the aisle and to the left,
across from the psychological

biographies. Look under Newman."
Two minutes earlier, the man be

trreeri Library reference desk gets more than
35,000 inquiries a year, according to a 1984 study done
for University libraries. Although their job is to refer
truth-seekers to appropriate sources, reference
librarians often answer questions directly.
With a staff of 11 full-time and 16 part-time
employees, the general reference department uses
nearly 40,000 volumes to field questions of every vari
ety.
Some questions are simple: "What's the capital of
Idaho?"
Some are complex: "Where can I find an article I
read two years ago in a psychology journal dealing with
the use of metaphors in psychological research, specifi
cally with neuro-psychology and brain exploration?"

Some are fun: "How can I find the origin of the mar
tini?"
Some are hopelessly vague: "What is the
relationship between time and Danville, Ala.?"
Are reference librarians ever exasperated?
"All the time," says Steve Macleod, social science
bibliographer at Green Library and a veteran at the ref
erence desk. "Some people use this place as a source
to find answers to every question, which is fine if
they're reference questions. People should take advan
tage of this service. But a lot of times a person —
usually an undergraduate lost in a concept or some
thing — will come right in and ask a really large ques
tion we can't possibly answer without some lengthy
research."
Karen Carr, a doctoral student in religious studies
and part-time employee at the reference desk, says,
"Of course I get exasperated. It always seems you get
a whole flurry of questions at once. You've got one per
son on the phone wanting the latitude and longitude of
the Galapagos Islands, two students wanting the gross
national product of Botswana and one student just
wants to know where the bathroom is."
Carr estimates that 50 percent of the inquiries they
get at the desk are "routine." Many of them are just
directional. The librarians respond automatically.
"Where can I find a bathroom?"
"Any floor except this one, make two right turns as
you get off the stairs," she'll say with a quick gesture.
"Where is the nearest copy machine?"
"Around the corner and to the left, behind the fire
extinguisher," comes the formulaic answer.

"Where would I find the Encyclopaedia Britannica?"
"Down the aisle, to the right, on the top end
shelves," the seeker of knowledge is told.
Macleod says he is lucky if he gets one "meaty ques
tion" in an hour.
"Where would I find the latest information on early
toy preferences of four-year-old female readers and
non-readers?"
Fastest Answer West of the Mississippi
People call from all over the nation to stump the ref
erence librarian.
s "At least once a month, a newspaper or wire service
from back East requests information for an article
they're writing on deadline," says Macleod. Why call
Stanford? "Because we're still open at night when all
the libraries back East are closed."
Another reason perhaps might be because the Stan
ford research library is one of the best in the nation.
According -to the Association of Research Libraries
Statistics, the Stanford research library ranks fifth out
of 117 schools in the country, in terms of number of
volumes, number of professional staff and current
serials received. Only Harvard, Berkeley, UCLA and
Yale rank higher.
"People call us from all over the nation even when
it's not necessary," Macleod says. "Some kid from eas
tern Oregon called to ask a very routine question that
his local public library could have answered. He called
the Library of Congress first and when they wouldn't
help him, he called us."
A freshman from Yale once sent a long list of ques
tions and asked that the answers be sent promptly

since his term paper was due in two weeks. He was
referred to the Yale University libraries.
Macleod and most of the full-time librarians on staff
have master's degrees in library science. Many have
second degrees that enable them to specialize in cer
tain areas. Macleod, for example, specializes in psy
chology, sociology, anthropology and
machine-readable data files.
Between routine questions, the librarians also
manange to provide specialized references, research
assistance, bibliographic help and computer searches i(i
the humanities and social sciences.
Do reference librarians like their job?
"I love my work for obvious reasons," Macleod says,
laughing. "A lot of people who end up in libraries have a
variety of interests and like to do research."
Carr says she enjoys her work also, but she recalls a
livelier time.
"The first night I worked here, there was a
streaker," Carr says. "It's been downhill from there."
Here's How to Play the Game
Early one morning two weeks ago, a fresh-faced
young graduate student strutted into the library, confi
dent he finally had the question to win the game.
He approached nonchalantly, eyeing the unwitting li
brarian behind the desk. And then he pounced.
"Where can I find the formula — the exact formula —
for lipstick? Heh-heh."
"Behind the wall, in the first aisle, on the shelves
next to the window, you'll find the chemical formulary
volumes. Look under lipstick."
Score that day, reference librarian - 1, world - 0.

Carr estimates that 50 percent of the inquiries they

directional. The librarians respond automatically.

"Any floor except this one, make two right turns as

People call from all over the nation to stump the ref

s "At least once a month, a newspaper or wire service
from back East requests information for an article
they're writing on deadline," says Macleod. Why call
Stanford? "Because we're still open at night when all
the libraries back East are closed."
Another reason perhaps might be because the Stan
ford research library is one of the best in the nation.
According -to the Association of Research Libraries
Statistics, the Stanford research library ranks fifth out
of 117 schools in the country, in terms of number of
volumes, number of professional staff and current
serials received. Only Harvard, Berkeley, UCLA and
Yale rank higher.
"People call us from all over the nation even when
it's not necessary," Macleod says. "Some kid from eas
tern Oregon called to ask a very routine question that
his local public library could have answered. He called
the Library of Congress first and when they wouldn't
help him, he called us."
A freshman from Yale once sent a long list of ques
tions and asked that the answers be sent promptly

since his term paper was due in two weeks. He was
referred to the Yale University libraries.
Macleod and most of the full-time librarians on staff
have master's degrees in library science. Many have
second degrees that enable them to specialize in cer
tain areas. Macleod, for example, specializes in psy
chology, sociology, anthropology and
machine-readable data files.
Between routine questions, the librarians also
manange to provide specialized references, research
assistance, bibliographic help and computer searches i(i
the humanities and social sciences.
Do reference librarians like their job?
"I love my work for obvious reasons," Macleod says,
laughing. "A lot of people who end up in libraries have a
variety of interests and like to do research."
Carr says she enjoys her work also, but she recalls a
livelier time.
"The first night I worked here, there was a
streaker," Carr says. "It's been downhill from there."
Here's How to Play the Game
Early one morning two weeks ago, a fresh-faced
young graduate student strutted into the library, confi
dent he finally had the question to win the game.
He approached nonchalantly, eyeing the unwitting li
brarian behind the desk. And then he pounced.
"Where can I find the formula — the exact formula —
for lipstick? Heh-heh."
"Behind the wall, in the first aisle, on the shelves
next to the window, you'll find the chemical formulary
volumes. Look under lipstick."
Score that day, reference librarian - 1, world - 0.
Two middle-aged women walk up
to the desk.
"Go ahead, ask him," says one
woman.
"This wasn't my idea," says the
other. Both giggle.
"All right, all right," says the first
woman, turning to face the man be
hind the desk. "My friend and I
want to know how tall Paul New
man is."
The man doesn't even blink. "Go
down the aisle and to the left,
across from the psychological
abstracts; you'll find current
biographies. Look under Newman."
Two minutes earlier, the man be
hind the desk was helping a student
find information on the Hungarian
revolution of 1919. Before that, an
other student wanted to know how
she could prove that the earth
emitted heat.

trreeri Library reference desk gets more than
35,000 inquiries a year, according to a 1984 study done
for University libraries. Although their job is to refer
truth-seekers to appropriate sources, reference
librarians often answer questions directly.
With a staff of 11 full-time and 16 part-time
employees, the general reference department uses
nearly 40,000 volumes to field questions of every vari
ety.
Some questions are simple: "What's the capital of
Idaho?"
Some are complex: "Where can I find an article I
read two years ago in a psychology journal dealing with
the use of metaphors in psychological research, specifi
cally with neuro-psychology and brain exploration?"

Some are fun: "How can I find the origin of the mar
tini?"
Some are hopelessly vague: "What is the
relationship between time and Danville, Ala.?"
Are reference librarians ever exasperated?
"All the time," says Steve Macleod, social science
bibliographer at Green Library and a veteran at the ref
erence desk. "Some people use this place as a source
to find answers to every question, which is fine if
they're reference questions. People should take advan
tage of this service. But a lot of times a person —
usually an undergraduate lost in a concept or some
thing — will come right in and ask a really large ques
tion we can't possibly answer without some lengthy
research."
Karen Carr, a doctoral student in religious studies
and part-time employee at the reference desk, says,
"Of course I get exasperated. It always seems you get
a whole flurry of questions at once. You've got one per
