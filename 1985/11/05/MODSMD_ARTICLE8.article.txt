# Arrestees Protest Report
## 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
A group of four student protesters refused to
leave University President Donald Kennedy's office
for almost two hours last night following a meeting
they and five other students had with Kennedy. The
meeting was convened to discuss the final police
brutality report of Law School Prof. John Kaplan.
Seniors David Romo, Warren Habib and Joel Bel
lenson and sophomore Peter Heslin began their
sit-in immediately after the meeting, which ended
about 6 p.m., and failed to leave until Stanford police
officers had cordoned off the area around the office
and stepped inside the office to ask them to leave.
The protesters emerged from the office at about
7:50 p.m.
The four protesters said they each had different

rationales for the sit-in, but Romo said that their
main concern as a group was to voice anger over
what he called the University's "complicity with the
institutional brutality of the apartheid regime" in
South Africa.
Bellenson added that the protest was a direct
response to, among other things, Kennedy's alleged
refusal to answer questions about the Kaplan
report. He said that the students who were arrested
in the Oct. 11 protest were not given access to
Kaplan's recommendations prior to yesterday's
meeting, but that Kennedy used the fact that they
hadn't read the report to deflect any questions they
might have had.
Heslin said that Kennedy told the students at the
meeting that he was responsible to a wide range of
constituencies within the University. "His response
indicates that the welfare of students is not part of
that responsibility," Heslin said.
