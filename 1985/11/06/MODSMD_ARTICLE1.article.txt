Recent suspensions of civil liberties, escalating
police violence and unwarranted arrests and detentions
in South Africa will have no effect on Stanford's current
divestment policies, University President Donald Ken
nedy said yesterday in a written statement to the com
munity.
"In my view, the state of emergency and the human
rights violations this summer in South Africa have not
changed the basic arguments for and against divest
ment," Kennedy said.
"Indeed, these events display such an appalling dis
regard for human rights, and hold such potential for
disaster, that I believe the role for corporations and for
other interested and well-intentioned outsiders may be
greater than it was before."
Kennedy, saying recent events in South Africa
"leave one with an increasing sense of moral outrage
and frustration," listed several goals that the Univer
sity, in concert with foundations and other universities,
can work toward this year. Those goals include:
• "providing neutral settings for leaders, including
those from South Africa, to discuss and develop new
approaches to ending the abuses of apartheid;
• "gathering support for guarantees of fundamental
human rights;
• "involving companies that do business in South
Africa in constructive ways of developing more pres
sure for change;
