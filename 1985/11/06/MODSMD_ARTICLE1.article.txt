# Kennedy Raps Divestiture Call
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Recent suspensions of civil liberties, escalating
police violence and unwarranted arrests and detentions
in South Africa will have no effect on Stanford's current
divestment policies, University President Donald Ken
nedy said yesterday in a written statement to the com
munity.
"In my view, the state of emergency and the human
rights violations this summer in South Africa have not
changed the basic arguments for and against divest
ment," Kennedy said.
"Indeed, these events display such an appalling dis
regard for human rights, and hold such potential for
disaster, that I believe the role for corporations and for
other interested and well-intentioned outsiders may be
greater than it was before."
Kennedy, saying recent events in South Africa
"leave one with an increasing sense of moral outrage
and frustration," listed several goals that the Univer
sity, in concert with foundations and other universities,
can work toward this year. Those goals include:
• "providing neutral settings for leaders, including
those from South Africa, to discuss and develop new
approaches to ending the abuses of apartheid;
• "gathering support for guarantees of fundamental
human rights;
• "involving companies that do business in South
Africa in constructive ways of developing more pres
sure for change;
• "supporting various educational initiatives for black
South Africans, both in their own country and here in
the United States; and
• "gathering the human and financial resources neces
sary to carry out these objectives."
Kennedy listed several ways in which Stanford has
sought to curb apartheid in South Africa.
The University, maintaining its current stated policy
of selective divestment, has launched an investigation
of more than 85 corporations in which Stanford holds
stock.
In addition, Kennedy and Warren Christopher, presi
dent of the Stanford Board of Trustees, have sent let
ters to about 85 companies in the University's

portfolio, urging them to "help bring about an end to
the widespread denial of basic human rights" in South
Africa.
Kennedy said that "in a situation already marked by
violence and having the prospect for much more, fore
stalling further assaults on human rights becomes a
precondition for constructive change.
"That will continue to be my personal objective."
In mid-October, Kennedy and 17 other university
presidents and foundation executives publicly agreed
with leaders of the University of Cape Town and the
University of the Western Cape to discuss long-term
partnerships with South African universities and organ
izations dedicated to a non-racist, democratic society.
Also, University administrators and faculty mem
bers have attended meetings of the Wesleyan Consor
tium, a group of colleges organized specifically to meet
on the subject of South African investment.
