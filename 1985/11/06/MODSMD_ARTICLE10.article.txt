# Sigma Chis Apologize for Motorhome
## 
### BRYAN WALSER 
The UCLA chapter of the Sigma
Chi fraternity was placed on proba
tion Monday as a result of public
outcry over slogans painted on a
motorhome bound for the Oct. 12
Stanford-UCLA football game.
Spurred by complaints from stu
dents and the UCLA administra
tion, the UCLA Interfraternity
Council suspended all Sigma Chi so
cial activities for the remainder of
the quarter and ordered chapter
members to perform 250 hours of
communitv service.
The motorhome was decorated

with depictions of female sexual or
gans and slogans such as "Abortion-
Yes" and "Don't Laugh, Your
Daughter May Be Inside." The
"urban assault vehicle" was parked
outside Stanford Stadium during the
game.
The UCLA Sigma Chis published
a full-page apology for their action
in the Oct. 30 Daily Bruin, the
school newspaper, and a smaller
edition of the ad ran in yesterday's
Stanford Daily. UCLA Sigma Chi
members had overstepped the
boundaries of "good clean fun," the
advertisement said.
The two ads were not terms of
the probation, said UCLA Sigma

Chi tribune Paul Reilly.
According to Joshua Woodard,
chapter president of the UCLA
Sigma Chi house, "This ad was an
action we took to let the people at
Stanford who we may possibly have
offended know that we have
learned from our mistake, and that
things will be better. We did step
out of bounds."
During their trip north, members
of the UCLA chapter visited the
Stanford Sigma Chis — to the
distress of house members.
"They were very obnoxious," ac
cording to Mike Llerandi, a member
of the Stanford Sigma Chis.
