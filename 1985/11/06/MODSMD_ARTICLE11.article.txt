# Putative Stanford Center In Washington Discussed
## 
### LARRY WEBER 
After a two-and-a-half-year ef
fort to explore what the Univer
sity "might do to increase the
number of students interested in
public service careers," a Stan
ford academic program in the na
tion's capital is an idea "whose
time may have come," according
to Public Service Center Director
Catherine Milton.
A University committee, or
ganized by Provost James Rosse,
met for the first time Monday to
discuss the possibility of a learn
ing center in Washington, D.C.
The center would focus on pro
viding students with public ser
vice internship opportunities.
Rosse expressed his hopes for
the committee, saying, "This is a
different kind of program than we
have done in the past, so we must
hold open the possibility that it
(the committee) may not set
Stanford standards. Having said

that, there is a high probability it
will."
Milton said the concept of a
Stanford center in Washington,
D.C. has received positive feed
back from faculty members and
University President Donald
Kennedy.
One of these faculty members
is the committee's chairman, Lin
coln Moses "There are many
reasons a Stanford student could
benefit from an education in
Washington," Moses, who is as
sociate dean of Humanities and
Sciences, said in a memorandum
released by the committee.
As committee member and
Economics Prof. John Shoven
pointed out, the federal govern
ment is one of many elements
comprising the nation's capital.
"There are government organi
zations, and there are a lot of non
profit organizations, like
(consumer activist) Ralph Nader's
group, that have their national

headquarters in Washington."
The consequent goal of the
committee is to determine the
best way to develop an educa
tional internship program that is
"not solely public policy" ori
ented, Moses said in the memo.
Issues inherent in the chal
lenge, as Moses' memo ex
presses, include what type of aca
demic program to implement and
how to incorporate internship ex
perience and how to weight credit
tor internships.
The memo also outlines logisti
cal considerations, such as how to
judge and select students and
how to staff the program.
"We have an opportunity to
overcome one of Stanford's West
Coast handicaps by getting stu
dents involved with first-hand ex
perience in governmental and
non-governmental agencies," said
Shoven.
"The key to the success of this
is in identifying meaningful intern
ships," he. said.
