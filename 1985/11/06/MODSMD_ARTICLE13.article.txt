## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Reach Out to Others 
### 
Can students make a difference in the lives of
others? Just ask the 370 students who participated
in the third "Reach Out Today," a full day of volun
teer service opportunities sponsored by the Stan
ford Volunteer Network.
The Community Association for the Retarded,
the Ecumenical Hunger Program and numerous
East Palo Alto residents benefited from the
generosity of Stanford students. The success of
Saturday's program was written on the faces of the
children who were treated to Halloween shows and
saw their playgrounds being repaired.
The need is real, the results are tangible and the
appreciation is genuine. Money can be important,
but the gift of time is the ultimate expression of con
cern â€” especially on a resplendent autumn

weekend.
"Reach Out Today" establishes a flow of commu
nication that might otherwise not exist. Despite
their relative proximity, Stanford students and East
Palo Alto residents often have little contact with
each other's problems and concerns. Such programs
promote greater understanding and empathy.
Everyone benefits.
We hope the trend will continue. Each dormitory
is being asked to sponsor a public service agency
and build on last weekend's success. This is a
unique chance to help the less fortunate and see the
results firsthand. But most important, continued
community involvement represents an opportunity
to foster mutual understanding and develop lasting
friendships.
