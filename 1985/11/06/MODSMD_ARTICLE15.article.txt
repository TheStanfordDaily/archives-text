## Intellectualize South Africa Debate 
### 
The activism shown by the Stanford commu
nity toward the horrors in South Africa is won
derful testimony to the fact that we do not live in
the alleged "Me Generation." The activism
shows that there are many concerned individuals
who are willing to devote time, love and effort to
causes that do not have direct impact on their
own lives.
However, we must not let the emotional
aspects of the brutality in South Africa cloud our
thought processes to the point where it harms
the cause we hope to advance.
Emotional techniques like sit-ins, marches and
rallies are excellent ways to attract attention to
important issues and force the parties involved
to attend to the specific problem. But that's all
they do. From that point on, the advancement of
the cause depends on the soundness of the

abhorrent. The issue concerns the appropriate
response the University should take in light of
these atrocities. We — including the trustees of
Stanford — all agree that the activity in South
Africa is reproachable. But the issue of divest
ment is a highly complex one that involves intri
cate political, economic and social issues. There
exist very cogent arguments claiming divest
ment of some U.S. companies operating in South
Africa could lead to a frustration of the current
problem. Specifically, these companies provide
some of the only equitable work environments in
the country and set a positive example for the

VIEWPOINT

reasoning that underpins it. I believe that the
opinions of the advocates for Stanford's divest
ment from South Africa are well thought out.
Unfortunately, those thoughts have become
buried underneath the less substantive aspects
of the debate.
The problem is that without reasoning to back
up activism, the probability of galvanizing opinion
and promoting change are slight. The Stanford
Board of Trustees does not make decisions to
divest millions of dollars because people are sit
ting in at Old Union. They make decisions based
on the intellectual merit of the cause being advo
cated. The job of the advocate rests in providing
the decision makers with a firm, logical argument
of which the validity stands up against question
ing.
Perhaps a few examples will highlight what I
mean. The first example concerns properly iden
tifying the issue and giving respect to its com
plexity. The argument frequently advanced by
supporters of divestment goes like this:
Atrocities are occurring in South Africa.
Therefore, Stanford should divest. If Stanford
doesn't divest, that must mean the trustees and
University President Donald Kennedy don't care
about those atrocities.
Clearly this argument is not true. The issue at
hand is not whether atrocities in South Africa are

government. Other anti-divestment arguments
stress the idea that divestment could force the
South African government to become less
sensitive to human rights.
I'm not suggesting divestment is a poor idea.
I'm merely highlighting that the issue is not as
simple as it may appear. The University's policy
may very well be based on thoughtful analysis
and concern for the situation, as opposed to
"Kennedy's insensitivity to the apartheid
practices and the mistreatment of blacks around
the world." Regardless of whether we agree
with the University, we need to respect the
merits of the opposing arguments. One of the
best ways to persuade individuals is to let them
know you understand and respect their view
points while, at the same time, pointing out flaws
in their logic or suggesting points that they may
not have previously considered. The current
level of mud-slinging has little to do with the
issue at hand, is insulting and has no hope of
leading to any resolution. If you want to appeal to
someone's judgment, you don't begin by spitting

in his face.
Another example of what I am referring to
regards the alleged brutality of the Stanford
police. The reasoning of the protesters after
the arrest of Perkins went like this: "We are pro
testing the police brutality toward Robby
Perkins and other people arrested at Stanford
recently. ... In light of this brutality, similar to
the violence in South Africa, we call on the Uni
versity to divest. ..." (The Daily, Oct. 17).
A police beating of a student is a terrible thing,
but it is not a reason to divest from South Africa.
The two have nothing to do with each other.

The Stanford Board of Trustees does not make
decisions to divest millions of dollars because people
are sitting in at Old Union. They make decisions based
on the merit of the cause being advocated.

Divesting from South Africa won't stop police
from beating youths in Palo Alto. Again, we see
a situation where the rhetoric works well for
mass appeal, but has little impact on policy —
the ultimate goal.
I'm not arguing for or against divestment.
What I am arguing for is an elevation of the sub
stance of the debate. While I applaud the good in
tent and concern that motivates the advocates of
divestment, I suggest a change in strategy is ne
cessary. Let's quit calling the University names
and begin discussing the issue with the intellec
tual horsepower of which the Stanford commu
nity is capable. For the advocates of divestment,
this will solidify their support, since the people
marching with them will truly understand what
they are marching for. Furthermore, if the pro
divestment logic is sound and considers all the is
sues, the chances of reaching the hearts and
minds of the University should be greatly en
hanced.

Emotional techniques like sit-ins, marches and
rallies are excellent ways to attract attention to
important issues and force the parties involved
to attend to the specific problem. But that's all
they do. From that point on, the advancement of
the cause depends on the soundness of the

abhorrent. The issue concerns the appropriate
response the University should take in light of
these atrocities. We — including the trustees of
Stanford — all agree that the activity in South
Africa is reproachable. But the issue of divest
ment is a highly complex one that involves intri
cate political, economic and social issues. There
exist very cogent arguments claiming divest
ment of some U.S. companies operating in South
Africa could lead to a frustration of the current
problem. Specifically, these companies provide
some of the only equitable work environments in
the country and set a positive example for the

VIEWPOINT

reasoning that underpins it. I believe that the
opinions of the advocates for Stanford's divest
ment from South Africa are well thought out.
Unfortunately, those thoughts have become
buried underneath the less substantive aspects
of the debate.
The problem is that without reasoning to back
up activism, the probability of galvanizing opinion
and promoting change are slight. The Stanford
Board of Trustees does not make decisions to
divest millions of dollars because people are sit
ting in at Old Union. They make decisions based
on the intellectual merit of the cause being advo
cated. The job of the advocate rests in providing
the decision makers with a firm, logical argument
of which the validity stands up against question
ing.
Perhaps a few examples will highlight what I
mean. The first example concerns properly iden
tifying the issue and giving respect to its com
plexity. The argument frequently advanced by
supporters of divestment goes like this:
Atrocities are occurring in South Africa.
Therefore, Stanford should divest. If Stanford
doesn't divest, that must mean the trustees and
University President Donald Kennedy don't care
about those atrocities.
Clearly this argument is not true. The issue at
hand is not whether atrocities in South Africa are

government. Other anti-divestment arguments
stress the idea that divestment could force the
South African government to become less
sensitive to human rights.
I'm not suggesting divestment is a poor idea.
I'm merely highlighting that the issue is not as
simple as it may appear. The University's policy
may very well be based on thoughtful analysis
and concern for the situation, as opposed to
"Kennedy's insensitivity to the apartheid
practices and the mistreatment of blacks around
the world." Regardless of whether we agree
with the University, we need to respect the
merits of the opposing arguments. One of the
best ways to persuade individuals is to let them
know you understand and respect their view
points while, at the same time, pointing out flaws
in their logic or suggesting points that they may
not have previously considered. The current
level of mud-slinging has little to do with the
issue at hand, is insulting and has no hope of
leading to any resolution. If you want to appeal to
someone's judgment, you don't begin by spitting

in his face.
Another example of what I am referring to
regards the alleged brutality of the Stanford
police. The reasoning of the protesters after
the arrest of Perkins went like this: "We are pro
testing the police brutality toward Robby
Perkins and other people arrested at Stanford
recently. ... In light of this brutality, similar to
the violence in South Africa, we call on the Uni
versity to divest. ..." (The Daily, Oct. 17).
A police beating of a student is a terrible thing,
but it is not a reason to divest from South Africa.
The two have nothing to do with each other.

The Stanford Board of Trustees does not make
decisions to divest millions of dollars because people
are sitting in at Old Union. They make decisions based
on the merit of the cause being advocated.

Divesting from South Africa won't stop police
from beating youths in Palo Alto. Again, we see
a situation where the rhetoric works well for
mass appeal, but has little impact on policy —
the ultimate goal.
I'm not arguing for or against divestment.
What I am arguing for is an elevation of the sub
stance of the debate. While I applaud the good in
tent and concern that motivates the advocates of
divestment, I suggest a change in strategy is ne
cessary. Let's quit calling the University names
and begin discussing the issue with the intellec
tual horsepower of which the Stanford commu
nity is capable. For the advocates of divestment,
this will solidify their support, since the people
marching with them will truly understand what
they are marching for. Furthermore, if the pro
divestment logic is sound and considers all the is
sues, the chances of reaching the hearts and
minds of the University should be greatly en
hanced.

The activism shown by the Stanford commu
nity toward the horrors in South Africa is won
derful testimony to the fact that we do not live in
the alleged "Me Generation." The activism
shows that there are many concerned individuals
who are willing to devote time, love and effort to
causes that do not have direct impact on their
own lives.
However, we must not let the emotional
aspects of the brutality in South Africa cloud our
thought processes to the point where it harms
the cause we hope to advance.
