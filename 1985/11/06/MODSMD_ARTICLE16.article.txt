# Push Buttons and Modern Man
## 
### 
"Let me use your microwave, please!" my
neighbor cried to me on my front steps this
morning. Looking like he'd been through a car
wash, unshaven, and shaking nervously, he
pleaded with me to let him into my house.
"My microwave? \Vhat do you want with my
microwave? You look terrible. Get yourself to
gether."
"OK, not the microwave. How about your
word processor, your calculator, your alarm
clock, your telephone! Please, anything with
push buttons!"

His plea struck a chord in my mind. I remem
bered he had been going to Technology
Anonymous (TA) sessions lately. He was obvi
ously on my doorstep looking for a technological
fix.
"Hey, I'm not about to let you use my technol
ogy. It's against your rules. You're supposed to
quit cold turkey," I declared.
"Please, be a friend. They've removed it all
from my house: My VCR is gone, my Walkman,
my talking car, my collection of digital watches,
my radar antenna, my cable reception and even
my calculator. All I've got left is electricity.
Please, I can't take it much longer. They're
trying to make me read books, think about
things, talk to my wife and kids. It's horrible!"
They sure had made him go cold turkey. He

had become addicted to technology, substituting
it for any human factor. He had even forgotten
how to read an old-fashioned clock with Mickey
Mouse hands. He had taken technology all too
far. It had become more than fun; he depended
on it. He depended on it for happiness. Technol
ogy became more than a labor-saving device and
a means to an end; it had become an end in itself.
He had gone over the limit, needing more and
more technology to keep away the jitters. Yet he
had taken the big step by admitting he was ad
dicted and going to his TA class.
He was searching my lawn for an automated
sprinkler head. Then he collapsed on the grass,
whimpering. They had tried to teach him that
technology was a short answer to happiness. His
wife had warned him that, if he kept it up, sooner
or later the technology could not support him
anymore, and his Star Wars world would come
crashing to the ground.
He was suffering the usual symptoms of
withdrawal: nervousness, depression and the
unbearable pain of facing up to the reality of his
electronic toys. TA was his only hope, but they
had not had much success with their members.
The belief that technology would cure the world
and fix the world's problems was too deeply im
bedded in the victims' lives.
Soon he would lose it completely and enter
into his own dream world. He would sit in front
of an imaginary television with reception from
around the world and live his entire day there.
No need to live life when you could watch it with
out risk. Whenever the show would get too real
istic or too thoughtful, and would try to bring
back the risk of reality, he would be able just to
turn the channel.
He was whimpering at my feet now, clawing at
my pants and shoes. "Is this synthetic leather?"
he asked hopefully. What was I to do in this situa

tion? Give him the quick fix he was looking for
and thereby support his myth? Deny his myth
and watch him suffer longer? I wanted to talk to
him, to help him understand.
"Please, look at yourself," I said. "Face your
problem. The technology won't help. It's
dehumanizing you. The beauty of life is in
people, not machines! Technology was supposed
to free us to let us be together more. Now
you're valuing it for itself, pretending it is good
by itself. You've removed from your life all that
is worthwhile."
"I know, I know. How do you do it? How do
you practice moderation? When is it time to stop
letting it take over all I do? What keeps you from
being obsessed too?"
"Because I have a poor soul like you to teach
me the lesson." He was shaking more than ever
now. He looked on the brink of collapse.
"Don't blame me! Please, I'm the product of a
technologically obsessed society. So I listened to
the advertisers. So I listened to my peers when
they told me I should be an engineer. Did I do
anything wrong in listening?"
He was right. He was only one in many. He
was only taking to the extreme what we all do. I
couldn't blame him. I couldn't watch him suffer. I
had to help.
Quickly, I ran upstairs for my electric razor.
I dug it up out of the bottom of the drawer,
hoping the batteries still worked. I hurried back
downstairs to give him his fix.
But it was too late. He was sitting in the
middle of the lawn, staring off into space, point
ing his finger and clicking the channel of his im
aginary world. Technology had stolen all the life
out of him.
