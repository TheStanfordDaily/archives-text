Daily Unfair
To Greek System
The Greek system at Stanford
has been considerably criticized
during the last two years rot only
by the University, but also by The
Daily. At least the University's
position has time and again been
made clear to us: The Greek sys
tem as it currently exists, the
University says, is in need of
change. We do not know,
however, what The Daily's posi
tion is on this issue because its
editorial staff has never had quite
enough nerve to come out and say
it.
The Daily's persistent efforts to
magnify some of the more
"newsworthy" events — the prob
lems — point to the fact that the
newspaper has, in fact, taken some
sort of dubious position on the
Greek system. There is other
evidence to support this.
During a recent four-day period,
from Oct. 24-27, three Greek
organizations, the Delta Gamma
and Kappa Alpha Theta sororities
and the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity,
sponsored charity fund raisers and
raised a gross amount in excess of
$4,000. Did The Daily go so far as
to print a short article — or even a
picture — for any of these three
completely separate events? No.
This is not the first time The Daily
has snubbed charity events con
ducted by members of the Greek
system in favor of "juicy" stories
about which group is going to be
on probation next.
Given The Daily's purported
desire to be an unbiased and
serious newspaper, we find it diffi
cult to understand why the paper's
editors find it necessary to impose
their personal viewpoints not only
on the editorial page but also on
the rest of the paper by printing
only those select few events that
portray Greek system members in
a negative manner.
Fraternities and sororities at

Stanford are going to continue to
provide services to the community
whether The Daily chooses to
inform its readers or not, but it
would be a welcome change if it
would provide news of those
events as well as the news which it
has been accustomed to providing
in the past.

Access Limited
Only at Work
The editorial "Protest Union
Access" (The Daily, Oct. 31) fails
to include one critical fact and
gives the reader the erroneous
impression that the University has
sought to limit all union access to
workers. The University's pro
posal on access seeks to deal only
with union requests for access
during work time. The union has
unlimited access to workers during
non-working time. In addition, the
University provides paid time in
which problems can be solved in
the grievance procedure. Workers
and their stewards (who are also
University employees) are allowed
paid time off from work to deal
with problems. There are 39
United Stanford Workers stewards
and the University provides each
with up to 120 hours of work time
to represent other employees.
