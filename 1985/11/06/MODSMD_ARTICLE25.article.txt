## 'Animal House' Yields to Progress 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
The cries of "Toga! Toga!" are just imaginary
echoes. The men of Delta Tau Chi are nowhere
to be found. And the sing-along version of
"Shout!" has blasted out of the basement for the
last time.
The big white house that was home to the
rowdy Delta Tau Chi fraternity in the movie
"Animal House" is headed for destruction — and
not at the hands of a bunch of beer-bombed fra
ternity brothers.
Rather, the 75-year-old house located near
the University of Oregon in Eugene will fall vic
tim to progress — and the wrecking ball — very
soon.
National Lampoon's "Animal House," which
catapulted the food-fighting John Belushi to
movie fame, was allegedly set at Dartmouth Col
lege, but it was filmed, in large part, on 11th
Street in Eugene, at the old A.W. Patterson
House.
The house was built and owned by one of
Oregon's first families — the Pattersons — in
the early 20th century. Since then, it's been a
state correctional facility, a cheap boarding
house and, yes, a University of Oregon frater
nity house.
At the moment, the house is shared by
several University of Oregon students who sub
let it from Gordon Erickson, the house's current
owner.
But Erickson said the house has become too
dilapidated to use, and it sits on valuable land on

which a local hospital wants to build a clinic.
Erickson said yesterday that he is on the verge
of signing papers that will finalize the sale of the
house to two local developers, who will tear it
down to make way for the new clinic.
None of this pleases an unlikely team of house
supporters — a group of "Animal House" fans
and the director of the county museum.
Carole Daly, the director of the Lane County
museum and the head of Eugene's historic
review board, said she fought the decision to
tear down the old house for two reasons.
First, she said the house is historically signifi
cant because it belonged to some of Oregon's
first settlers. Second, she said it is culturally sig
nificant because of its title role in "Animal
House."

"There is some of that," she said. "I guess
from a pure historical viewpoint, no, that it was
in the movie isn't significant. But the fact that
'Animal House' was made there does add cultural
value, and that's one of the things that we look
at."
Daly said the historic review board tried to en
courage Erickson to renovate the house by of
fering him tax incentives, but he wasn't inter
ested.
Fans of the movie also are trying to stall the
house's violent end. They've circulated petitions
and held protests, but Daly said there's no
longer any reason to hope that the house will
survive.
"I'm not really optimistic," she said. "I'm one
of these people who always hopes up to the last
minute, but I haven't heard anything about the
owner changing his mind."
And indeed the owner said yesterday he has
no intention of changing his decision. Rather, he
said he'll be happy to see the ramshackle house
go — he didn't like the movie, and he doesn't
much care for the house.
"I'm glad to get rid of it,"he said yesterday.
"Some people are upset, but I don't know, it just
depends on what the person's opinion is."
In the end, Daly said, "Animal House" fans
can only mourn the passing of the house that
sheltered the antics of Bluto, D-Day, Stork, Ot
ter and their Delta Tau Chi brothers.
"My 14-year-old son, who couldn't give a whit
about anything historic, said, 'Oh my God, the
'Animal House' is gonna be destroyed,' " she
said.
