## Rats Help Study of Kidney Functions 
### ANTOINETTE REED 
A rat kidney, a light microscope, a television
camera, a VCR, and a computer: in Rex Jamison and
Channing Robertson's laboratory, these are the tools
for responding to a scientific challenge.
"The function of the kidney is one that just does not
lend itself to a cellular or subcellular level of investiga
tion, " said Jamison, who is acting chairman of the De
partment of Medicine here. During a recent interview
at Stanford Hospital, he explained that "you can't take
the kidney parts out of their constantly changing milieu
and still learn about their function."
It is precisely this dilemma that Jamison and
Robertson, a professor of chemical engineering, set
out to solve when they began collaborating in 1980.
Their target: the innermost part of the mammalian kid
ney, called the renal medulla. As Jamison explained,
the medulla is both the most inaccessible and the least
understood part of the kidney. And yet, he added
the function of the medulla is critical to the production
of urine.
Jamison explained that the capillaries in the kidney
play not only the traditional roles of bringing nutrients
to cells and carrying away cellular waste products, but
also are responsible for "trapping" a high concentration
of solutes like urea in the renal medulla.
Meanwhile, in the outer levels of the kidney — called
the renal cortex — the systemic blood is filtered,
preparatory to the formation of urine. But if all that is
filtered in the cortex were ultimately excreted, the
animal would be dehydrated within a short time.
This is where the regional high solute concentration
of the medulla comes into play, said Jamison. As the
original blood filtrate passes through the medulla, he
explained, water diffuses out of what will be the urine,
in order to dilute the medulla. As quickly as the blood

leaves the filtering tubules, however, it is carried away
by the medullary capillaries, or "vasa recta." Thus the
medullary's rich solute concentration is maintained,
and a large part of the water originally filtered is reab
sorbed, preventing dehydration.
The whole set of functions performed by the vasa
recta is known as "countercurrent exchange," said
Jamison. He added that the system is highly sensitive
to changes in body fluid concentrations, so that more
or less water can be reabsorbed, depending on the
body's needs.
The primary innovation of Jamison and Robertson's
work is seeing countercurrent exchange in action. By
dissecting away the ureter from one of an anesthetized
rat's two kidneys, the very innermost part of the
medulla — called the papilla — can be exposed. Then
the rat is placed on a microscope stage; after injecting a
fluorescent dye into the kidney, the experimenters can

actually observe the circulation of plasma and red blood
cells through the papillary vasa recta.
Although "countercurrent exchange is a sight every
civilized person should see," observation alone is not
their only goal, Jamison said. By lining up little
"windows" on the television screen, Jamison and
Robertson can make the computer "see" the dark red
blood cells moving through the capillaries. The com
puter can then calculate capillary blood flow and
diameters and, from these values, can calculate total
blood flow in the papilla.
Then, by recording their observations on the VCR,
Jamison explained that they can compare the events in
different capillaries in the same "real time." In addition,
urine flow from the exposed kidney can be recorded
thanks to a special glass pipette designed by graduate
fellow Timothy Larson to replace the removed ureter.
Graduate fellows Bryce Kiberd and Masaaki Miyamoto,
and graduate student Elizabeth McNeeley are also

working on the project, said Jamison.
According to Jamison, all of these calculations are
very important in understanding the mechanisms of
normal medullary function and the effects of certain
drugs and hormones on this function.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are
one type of drug currently under investigation, ex
plained Jamison. "These are becoming increasingly
popular," he said, "and even include one — Avril —
which no longer requires a prescription." After inject
ing a rat with indomethacin, another NSAID, Jamison
and Robertson have observed a slowing of medullary
blood flow and a reduction in capillary diameter.
"These changes may explain the uncomfortable num
ber of renal complications observed during administra
tion of NSAIDs," said Jamison.
"The kidney is like a little prostaglandin factory," he
added. "Normally, these prostaglandins act to keep the
kidney's capillaries dilated, even when the rest of the
body's blood vessels are contracted, in response to low
blood pressure, for example." Prostaglandins are
small, biochemically active molecules in the human
bloodstream. In accordance with the belief that
NSAIDs counteract the effect of prostaglandins,
Jamison said that he and Robertson have observed
slowing of medullary circulation with NSAIDs, to such
a degree that papillary necrosis has even occurred.
Jamison noted that there is so little currently known
about the medulla that much information may be gained
from this new approach to the study of kidney function.
Among other uses of the technique, he said that films
of countercurrent exchange may be used to teach
medical students about renal physiology.
Jamison said that ultimately, lesions similar to those
that may cause acute renal failure in humans may be
induced in the rat medulla. The effectiveness of hypot
hetical cures for such lesions may then be tested di
rectly.
