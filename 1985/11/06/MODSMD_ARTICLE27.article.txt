# Stanford Scientists Discover Moon in Saturn's Rings
## 
### 
Stanford scientists have discovered a small, ap
parently dark moonlet sweeping through one of the
gaps in Saturn's rings.
In a paper delivered Thursday in Baltimore, Essam
Marouf said the moonlet was discovered in the Cassini
division, between the two main rings, A and B.
iMarouf, senior engineering research associate at
Stanford's Center for Radar Astronomy, told the Divi
sion of Planetary Science of the American Astronomi
cal Association that the moonlet was found in data from
the Voyager spacecraft because it left a wake as it
swept around the planet.
The moonlet may be partially responsible for the
structure of the gap.
The moonlet is the second to have been discovered
in the Saturnian ring system. The first was found
several years ago in the Encke gap, near the outer
edge of ring A, the ring most distant from the planet,
by Jeff Cuzzy and Mike Showalter of NASA's Ames Re
search Center in Sunnyvale.
The two Voyager spacecraft flew by Saturn in mis
sions eight months apart in 1980-81.
The Cassini division, which appears from the Earth
as a dark area between rings A and B, is not a complete
gap in the ice and stones that make up the ring, accord
ing to G. Leonard Tyler, Maroul's associate, but con
tains lanes of ring material.
The moonlet was found in one of those lanes.
Neither the Encke gap moonlet nor the newly
discovered moonlet in the Cassini division ring have
been actually seen, Tyler says, probably because they

are made of dark material that does not reflect sun
light.
Both objects are probably smaller than about 10
kilometers (about six miles) in diameter.
"It could be made of ice; more likely it is ice mixed
with some carbon," Tyler said. "It is certainly dark."
Tyler suggested the two moonlets may not be made
of the same material as the particles in the surrounding
areas of the rings.
Tyler said that evidence for both moonlets was in
the Voyager radar data being studied at Stanford but
was not immediately recognized. Ames researchers,
using their own data, discovered the Cassini moonlet.
The Stanford scientists went through their data and
confirmed the Ames finding. Then, using the same
technique, Marouf found the Cassini moonlet.
What Marouf noted was not the moonlet itself, but
the wake as the moonlet slid through the material in
one of Encke's lanes.
"The moonlets leave wakes in the ring particles
which are very similar in their patterns to wakes boats
leave in the water," Tyler said.
Just astern of a moving boat is a flat area. Then
waves build up, starting with short wave lengths, and
gradually get longer until finally they disappear.
The moonlet wake found by Marouf in Encke had
those similarities, Tyler said.
(Because the moonlet was orbiting around the
planet, the wake on the far side of the moonlet would
be behind it. But the wake on the planet side would be
in front of the object because the moonlet would be

traveling more slowly than the particles. Marouf only
found the near side wake.)
Meanwhile, two Stanford graduate students also
delivered papers at the meeting, both on waves found
in the Saturnian rings.
Paul Rosen of Swarthmore, Pa., measured the den
. sity waves in the rings. These waves, like acoustic or
compression waves, are caused by the large moons

beyond the rings and give scientists numbers to explain
the dynamics of the ring system.
Donna Gresh of Oakton, Va., reported on bending
waves in the rings, apparently caused by the moon
Mimas. These waves move ring particles above and
below the plane of the rings by as much as 800 meters
(about a half mile), but were more typically 200 meters
(about the length of two football fields) in height.
