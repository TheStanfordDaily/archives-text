## Broncos Get Busted In Easy Card Win Spikers sweep it 15-4, 15-3, 15-10 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
Shortly after the Stanford
women's volleyball team's victory
over Santa Clara University last
night, a woman approached Card
inal Co-coach Don Shaw in a back
room at Maples Pavilion and said,
"I'm from Kalamazoo."
Now most people would have
given this remark little attention,
but Shaw showed an immediate in
terest. And understandably so.
Kalamazoo happens to be the Mi
chigan city where this year's NCAA
women's volleyball Final Four is
being held.
"I hope we get a good following

there," Shaw said to the woman.
And then as if the preceding state
ment had been a slip of the tongue,
he added, "But I just hope we get
there."
After last night's three-game
sweep of Santa Clara, it would be
difficult to blame Shaw if he started
to round up Cardinal support in the
western Michigan area.
Not that Santa Clara is a volley
ball powerhouse by any means.
Top-ranked Stanford's 15-4, 15-3,
15-10 victory was anything but sur
prising.
What was gratifying to Shaw,
though, was the concentration that
the team showed throughout the

match. "These are real hard games
to play, especially considering the
fact that we had already beaten
them on their court," Shaw ex
plained.
Yet the Cardinal women did not
appear to suffer a letdown. "We
knew that we had to concentrate,"
sophomore Theresa Smith said.
"We wanted to make it like a
practice for UCLA."
"This team is a little different
than teams in the past," Shaw said.
"They have a lot of pride. They're
going for the championship."
Still, last night's victory — which
brought the Cardinal's overall
record to 18-1 — was somewhat of
a breather for a Stanford team that
loads its schedule with Top 10
teams. The team seemed to enjoy
the match throughout, showing a
type of playful attitude that
reflected the ease of the victory
and the fact that almost every
player was able to play in the
match.
And they had good reason to feel
giddy.
Behind the powerful hitting of
senior Kim Oden, the Cardinal
women ran off the first four points
of the match before yielding a point
to the Broncos. At 4-1, the Cardinal
took advantage of a perplexed
Santa Clara defense to win nine
consecutive points.
The Broncos rallied to win three
of the next four points, but at 14-4,
Oden slammed another spike by the
overwhelmed Santa Clara blockers

It was a spunky Cardinal squad last night. Clockwise from the

Senior Kim Oden awaits the set of freshman Brook Binley in the second game of the Cardinal's
15-4, 15-3, 15-10 sweep of Santa Clara. Oden pounded away at the defenseless Santa Clara
blockers before sitting out the third game. Nearly every Stanford player got in some action
against the unlucky Broncos.
Pacific can upset San Jose in the
Spartans' final game of the season.
If San Jose and Stanford tie for
first, Stanford will get the bid by
virtue of having beaten the Spar
tans twice already this year.
Both teams are up for today's
game, Chamberlain said.
"(Stanford's players) are playing
really excited .... They're
looking forward to the game."
The Spartans were Stanford's
first conference victim this season.
On Oct. 9, the Cardinal won 3-2 in
overtime to start its current seven
game winning streak. One week
later, in the California Invitational,
Stanford beat the Spartans 2-1.
The first victory over San Jose,
the Cardinal's sixth game of the
season, was an especially big one
hf»raiise it was the first one in which
the Cardinal scored more than two
goals. Since that time, the team has
become more of an offensive
threat. Though the number of shots
Stanford is taking per game remains
about the same, these shots are re
sulting in more Stanford goals.
This does not mean that Stanford
can relax, though. "We have im
proved in that area (scoring), but
we could improve more," Cham
berlain said. In preparation for
today's game, Chamberlain said the"
squad has been "running more
shooting drills."

to finish the game, 15-4.
Throughout the match, Santa
Clara switched back and forth be
tween two defensive strategies. At
times they attempted to pack the
middle in hopes of taking Oden out
of the game, and in other situations
they guarded against the outside
hitting power of Smith and junior
Barbra Fontana.
But Cardinal setter Wendi Rush
foiled the strategy, feeding Oden
for uncontested spikes when the
middle was left open and setting to
the sides when Oden was covered.

The second game was a virtual
repeat of the first, despite the fact
that Shaw and Co-coach Fred
Sturm had substituted senior Terry
Bryson and freshmen Brook Binley
and Cristy Moiso for starters Fon
tana, Rush and Nancy Reno.
Santa Clara celebrated a 3-2 lead
when freshman Rosalynn Hortsch
blocked a Cardinal spike. But that
celebration was very temporary.
After freshman Amy Hayes'
spike gave the Cardinal a side out,
Hayes combined with junior Brooke
Hahner on a block to even the score
at 3-3. Two Bronco errors made
the score 5-3 and gave Stanford an
advantage that would only get
larger.
Oden continued to patrol the net,

streak. Senior Angel Vazquez has
seven goals and five assists to lead
the team in scoring. Cardinal for
ward Rob West is second with four
goals and five assists.

swatting any balls that would pass
by her way as if they were un
wanted pests.
The Broncos mishandled two
serves, hit two balls wide and were
called for two net violations, making
the Cardinal's job that much easier.
Santa Clara was unable to score
again, and the Cardinal women
captured game two, 15-3.
The third game saw Stanford
empty its bench as Shaw and Sturm
substituted players every few
points. The net result was the
same, however. Tied at four, the
Cardinal won seven of the next
eight points to take a 11-5 lead. And
after a brief Bronco surge, Reno
and Fontana combined on a block to
close out the game at 15-10.

Junior forward Maree Chung is Stanford's most potent offensive
force. She has tallied four goals and four assists to lead the
team with 12 scoring points.
