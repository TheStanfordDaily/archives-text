## Broncos Get Busted In Easy Card Win Spikers sweep it 15-4, 15-3, 15-10 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
Shortly after the Stanford
women's volleyball team's victory
over Santa Clara University last
night, a woman approached Card
inal Co-coach Don Shaw in a back
room at Maples Pavilion and said,
"I'm from Kalamazoo."
Now most people would have
given this remark little attention,
but Shaw showed an immediate in
terest. And understandably so.
Kalamazoo happens to be the Mi
chigan city where this year's NCAA
women's volleyball Final Four is
being held.
"I hope we get a good following

there," Shaw said to the woman.
And then as if the preceding state
ment had been a slip of the tongue,
he added, "But I just hope we get
there."
After last night's three-game
sweep of Santa Clara, it would be
difficult to blame Shaw if he started
to round up Cardinal support in the
western Michigan area.
Not that Santa Clara is a volley
ball powerhouse by any means.
Top-ranked Stanford's 15-4, 15-3,
15-10 victory was anything but sur
prising.
What was gratifying to Shaw,
though, was the concentration that
the team showed throughout the

match. "These are real hard games
to play, especially considering the
fact that we had already beaten
them on their court," Shaw ex
plained.
Yet the Cardinal women did not
appear to suffer a letdown. "We
knew that we had to concentrate,"
sophomore Theresa Smith said.
"We wanted to make it like a
practice for UCLA."
"This team is a little different
than teams in the past," Shaw said.
"They have a lot of pride. They're
going for the championship."
Still, last night's victory — which
brought the Cardinal's overall
record to 18-1 — was somewhat of
a breather for a Stanford team that
loads its schedule with Top 10
teams. The team seemed to enjoy
the match throughout, showing a
type of playful attitude that
reflected the ease of the victory
and the fact that almost every
player was able to play in the
match.
And they had good reason to feel
giddy.
Behind the powerful hitting of
senior Kim Oden, the Cardinal
women ran off the first four points
of the match before yielding a point
to the Broncos. At 4-1, the Cardinal
took advantage of a perplexed
Santa Clara defense to win nine
consecutive points.
The Broncos rallied to win three
of the next four points, but at 14-4,
Oden slammed another spike by the
overwhelmed Santa Clara blockers

It was a spunky Cardinal squad last night. Clockwise from the
front left: Brook Binley, Nancy Reno, Teresa Smith, Kim Oden,
Barbra Fontana and Cristy Moiso going for the high five.

Senior Kim Oden awaits the set of freshman Brook Binley in the second game of the Cardinal's
15-4, 15-3, 15-10 sweep of Santa Clara. Oden pounded away at the defenseless Santa Clara
blockers before sitting out the third game. Nearly every Stanford player got in some action
against the unlucky Broncos.
