# Card Must Win Today
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
In the end, Stanford's last reg
ular season game, against the
weak sister of the Pacific Soccer
Conference, has turned into the
team's most important match of
the year.
The Cardinal hosts the Univer
sity of the Pacific Tigers today at
2:30 p.m. on Harry Maloney Field
in the final PSC contest for both
teams.
After a sluggish start this
season, Stanford has rolled to a
strong finish and now finds itself
in the running for an NCAA post
season tournament bid. The

Cardinal team has gone 6-0-1 in
its last seven games, and a win
over UOP would keep the team's
recent unbeaten streak alive.
With two teams in the Western
region assured of berths in the
NCAA tournament — Fresno
State and UCLA pretty much
have those locked up — Stanford
must hope for one of the eight at
large bids in the nation.
The NCAA looks favorably on
strong-finishing teams, so a loss
against UOP today would prob
ably be fatal for the Cardinal.
Stanford is coming off a satisfy
ing 2-0 shutout victory over the
UC-Berkeley Golden Bears Sun
day. That win enabled the Card
inal to clinch at least a tie for

second place in the conference
and raised the team's record to
11-6-3 overall and 5-1 in the PSC.
UOP on the other hand, is
struggling. The Tigers have won
only twice this year. Head Coach
Ray Fitchette's team is 0-5 in the
conference and 2-13 overall.
As far as Cardinal Coach Sam
Koch is concerned, team records
won't mean anything today.
"They played us tough last
year when we beat them 3-2 at
Pacific," Koch said. "They are
capable of playing well, and we
have trouble playing against
teams not as good as us — noth
ing is easy."

Midfielder Cassio Conceicao has been a playmaker for the Cardinal offense all year. The
senior from Brazil has five assists on the season, including a brilliant pass to teammate Rob
West in Sunday's win over Cal.
But as far as team records and
stats go, LJOP looks to be over
matched.
The Tigers have scored only 11
goals in 15 games while allowing a
whopping 64 goals. UOP's starting
goaltender, Paul Parkinson, has a
high 3.95 goals-against average.
Stanford, meanwhile, has out
scored its opponents 29-13. The
Cardinal has the conference's stin
giest defense, with goaltender Tom
Austin sporting a 0.62 goals-against
average.
Austin has set a Stanford record

with 11 shutouts and recently he
has allowed only one goal in his last
470 minutes of play.
The junior goalie has had a solid
and experienced defense in front of
him all year. Senior sweeperback
Phil Horvath, senior fullbacks Todd
Rafalovich, Marshall Monroe and
junior Neal Stephens have played
aggressive, stifling defense all
season.
Maybe the most impressive stat
of all is that Stanford has allowed
opposing teams to score more than
one goal in a game on only two oc
casions.
Furthermore, the Stanford of
fense has come to life, scoring 15
goals during the team's unbeaten

But as Koch said earlier, one
thing which may help UOP is the
difficulty the Stanford team has in
maintaining its quality of play
against weaker opponents.
Last week the Cardinal did not
play with intensity against UC-
Davis, a Division II team, and the
two squads labored to a 0-0 tie.
In that game, the Stanford
players may have been looking past
Davis toward the Cal match.
Today, the Cardinal has nothing to
look forward to if it doesn't defeat
the Tigers.
