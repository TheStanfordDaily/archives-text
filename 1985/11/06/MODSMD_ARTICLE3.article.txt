# ASSU Senate Sets Up Brutality Inquiry
## 
### DAVID EMERSON Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate voted last night to
set up a special committee to investigate
alleged police brutality during arrests of
nine students at a sit-in last month, call
ing a recently released University inves
tigation of the matter "unsatisfactory."
In addition, the senate approved a
$1,384 loan for establishing a student
run Espresso Bar, denied additional fund
ing to the Stanford Coalition Against
Apartheid, and discussed non-binding
guidelines for funding policy.
In response to a motion by Senator
Joel Bellenson, the ASSU directed Sen

ate Chair Carey White to form a commit
tee to "deliver a fair and unbiased inves
tigation " of the events surrounding the
Oct. 11 arrests of students protesting
University investments in South Africa
related companies. The committee is to
make recommendations as to appropri

Explaining the need for an ASSU in
vestigation, Bellenson cited possible
"conflict of interest" by Law Prof. John
Kaplan, who authored the report. He
referred to Kaplan as a "close friend" of
University President Donald Kennedy.
Before voting 12-1 in favor of loaning
money from the ASSU budget reserve

terprise that is scheduled to open in

Bechtel International Center on Friday,
senators debated over the collateral

demand for the bar, and the possibility of
any "preferential treatment" by the sen
ate.
The provisions of the $1,384 loan call
for half of it to be repayed within three
weeks and the rest by Jan. 1, 1986.
No employee salaries can be paid until
the entire debt is retired.
A motion by Senator David Porter to
amend the Program Board's previous al
location for the Stanford Coalition
Against Apartheid by increasing it to
$2,200 failed by a 5-10 vote. The senate
decided that the $1,401 already ear
marked for the group was sufficient to

carry it through to the next funding per
iod.
In other business, the ASSU dis
cussed general guidelines for its funding
policy. The guidelines are intended to
provide "general rules of thumb" for the
disposition of funds and to "fill in the
gaps" of the ASSU bylaws, according to
a rough draft presented by graduate
Senator Jim DeLaHunt.
"The publication is almost entirely a
writing down of a number of traditions
which have been bouncing around the
ASSU for a number of years,"
DeLaHunt said. By distributing them to
groups seeking senate funding, he hopes
