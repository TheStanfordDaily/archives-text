# Gators Take Over No. 1
## Florida is AP's best team despite probation 
### 
The Florida Gators are the No. 1
team in college football for the first
time in the 50-year history of the
Associated Press poll.
While Florida was defeating
sixth-ranked Auburn 14-10, No. 8
Ohio State was knocking off No. 1
lowa 22-13, a setback that dropped
the Hawkeyes from first place to
sixth and left room at the top.
That enabled the Gators, 7-0-1,
to move up from second place to
the top spot. They received 42 of
59 first-place votes and 1,159 of a
possible 1,180 points from a
nationwide panel of sports writers
and sportscasters.
Penn State, which is Florida
Coach Galen Hall's alma mater,
turned back Boston College and
climbed from third place to second
with 15 first-place votes and 1,113
points. The Nittany Lions are 9-0,
one of three unbeaten-untied
major-college teams. The others
are fifth-ranked Air Force and un
ranked Bowling Green, both 9-0.
"I think it's great," Hall said
when informed of the No. 1
ranking. "I appreciate the writers
taking into consideration the
schedule and the competition we've
played. Everyone starts the season
with that goal, and we wanted to be
around the top coming to the end of
the season. With the people we've
played and the way our players
reacted, I think we deserve it."

Florida's season, however, will
end prematurely because of NCAA
probation. The Gators, who are in
eligible for a bowl game, are bidding
to become the third team to capture
a national championship while on
probation. The others were Auburn
in 1957 and Oklahoma in 1974.
Meanwhile, Nebraska trounced
Kansas State 41-3 and jumped from
fifth to third with 1,027 points. Mi
chigan, which had been fourth, was
held to a 3-3 tie by Illinois and
slipped to ninth place while Ohio
State vaulted from eighth to fourth.
The Buckeyes received one first-

place vote and 958 points.
Air Force, a 31-10 winner over
San Diego State, jumped from
seventh to fifth — its highest
ranking ever — with 882 points,
followed by lowa with 834. The
Hawkeyes had been No. 1 for five
consecutive weeks and were a
unanimous choice the last two
weeks.
The other first-place vote went
to Oklahoma, which crushed
Kansas 48-6 and rose from ninth to
seventh with 821 points, followed
by Miami of Florida, which turned
back Florida State 35-27 and leaped
from 11th to eighth with 815 points
while dropping FSU from 10th to
16th.
Rounding out the Top 10 are Mi
chigan, with 685 points, and Okla
homa State, which edged Colorado
14-11 and moved up from 12th to
10th with 600 points.
The Second 10 consists of
Baylor, Arkansas, Auburn, UCLA,
LSU, Florida State, Georgia, Brig
ham Young, Tennessee and Ala
bama.
Last week, it was Miami, Okla
homa State, Baylor, Arkansas,
UCLA, LSU, BYU, Georgia, Ten
nessee and Southern Methodist.
SMU fell out of the Top 20 by
losing to Texas A&M 19-17 and Al
abama moved back in after a two
week absence by defeating Missis
sippi State 44-28.
