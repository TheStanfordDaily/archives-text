Moscow Talks Make No Gains
MOSCOW — Secretary of State George Shultz wound up 14 hours
of "vigorous discussion" with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and
other Kremlin officials yesterday, saying the talks failed to narrow
the superpowers' differences on arms control.
. Shultz said that despite "serious disagreements," the two sides
had pledged to work hard in preparing the Nov. 19-20 summit
meeting between President Reagan and Gorbachev in Geneva.
"Basically, we have a lot to do," Shultz said.
In a news conference before departing for an overnight refueling
stop in Iceland, Shultz tempered his downbeat appraisal of the two
day visit by observing "we see some positive developments" in the
U.S.-Soviet relationship.
But he did not cite any major area of reconciliation or prospect of
an accord for the first superpower summit in more than six years.
He said later the four-hour session was "a very vigorous exchange
that covered everything."
He twice described the talks as "frank," which in diplomatic par
lance often means considerable disagreement.
Besides arms control, Shultz singled out regional issues and
human rights.
"As we broke up we wished for success at the upcoming Geneva
meeting and beyond and pledged to each other that we would work
hard for continuing preparations."
Afghans Hit Airport, Kill 70
NEW DELHI, India — Afghan rebel forces mounted a major at
tack on Shindand Air base in western Afghanistan last week, killing
70 Soviet soldiers and inflicting huge losses of material and equip
ment, resistance sources said here yesterday.
Quoting information received from the Afghan capital, Kabul, the
sources said that many Afghan government officers were arrested
later on charges of collaboration with the Moujahedeen rebels.
The Moujahedeen denied any collaboration with the government
soldiers in the attack on the heavily guarded airport.
In June a total of 20 Soviet MiG aircraft were destroyed at the air
port, which is in Herat province. Later the Kabul regime executed
Afghan pilots on charges of sabotaging the planes.
The sources also said that on Oct. 31, the rebels set ablaze nearly
80 Soviet gasoline tankers while they were passing through the
Salang Pass leading from the Soviet Union.

Poles Investigate Youth's Death
WARSAW, Poland -— The Polish government said yesterday that
senior officials had been assigned to investigate the death of a 19-
year-old honors student who was severely injured after the police
detained him in the northern city of Olsztyn.
The youth, Marcin Antonowicz, a first-year chemistry student at
Gdansk University, died Saturday, two weeks after receiving
massive head injuries while in police custody. Despite emergency
surgery, he never regained consciousness.
Nobel Peace Prize winner Lech Walesa and other leaders of the
outlawed Solidarity independent labor union movement have cited
the youth's death as an example of police brutality. But the govern
ment's chief spokesman said yesterday that a preliminary investiga
tion showed that Antonowicz was injured when he leaped from a
moving police van in an apparent effort to escape detention.
"There is nothing to indicate that the authorities are responsible
for the death of the young man," the spokesman, Jerzy Urban, said
at his regular weekly news conference.
The investigation, Urban said, so far supported the police position
that while Antonowicz was in the police van, he pushed an officer
aside, opened the rear door and jumped out, falling backward at a
speed of about 25 miles an hour and striking his head on the pave
ment. Urban said an autopsy found heavy bruises elsewhere on the
young man's body consistent with that explanation for his head in
jury, and that a police baton could not have caused it.
Urban said that a senior official from the state prosecutor's office
was conducting an investigation of the death. He noted that Interior
Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak had also ordered the commandant of
Poland's uniformed police, Gen. Josef Bejm, to study the incident.
An appeal signed by Walesa and six other Solidarity leaders inde
pendent trade union movement, condemned the death of Antonowicz
as "another act of lawlessness" by the police. It called on the govern
ment to end police abuses and to release political prisoners.
China, Libya To Expand Ties
PEKING — A senior Chinese official concluded a four-day visit to
Libya yesterday, and the official New China News Agency said the
two countries had pledged to expand their economic links.
At the same time, the agency, in a dispatch from Tripoli, gave con
siderable coverage to Libya's denunciation of the Reagan Adminis
tration's reported plan to undermine the regime of the Libyan leader,
Col. Muammar Khadafy.
China and Libya have had diplomatic relations for the past seven
years, but Khadafy paid a visit to Peking in 1982. Chinese officials
have said that Khadafy attempted several years ago to buy nuclear
weapons from China or to get its technical assistance in a nuclear
program, but that China turned down the effort.
The Chinese official visiting Libya was Vice Premier Tian Jiyun,
who is making a tour of five African countries. The New China News
Agency said that at the end of Tian's stop in Tripoli, China and Libya
"expressed satisfaction over the remarkable progress in the eco
nomic and technological cooperation between the two countries."
Boesak To Fight for Passport
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Dissident clergyman and
president of the World Federation of Reformed Churches, Allan
Boesak, said yesterday that he would fight to get back his passport
which was withdrawn by the South African authorities.
"I do not intend to let this one go unchallenged," Boesak said.
"This is an act of petty vindictiveness, but even more serious is the
disregard, the contempt of the courts and the rule of law."
A spokesman for Interior Minister Stoffel Botha confirmed yester
day that Boesak's passport was withdrawn, although a court Monday
lifted some of the restrictions imposed on the anti-apartheid activist,
who is co-founder of the United Democratic Front and had ruled that
Boesak would be allowed to travel.
Boesak was planning to travel to the United States to accept the
Robert F. Kennedy humanitarian award, and then visit Sweden and
Switzerland.

aside, opened the rear door and jumped out, falling backward at a
speed of about 25 miles an hour and striking his head on the pave
ment. Urban said an autopsy found heavy bruises elsewhere on the
young man's body consistent with that explanation for his head in
jury, and that a police baton could not have caused it.
Urban said that a senior official from the state prosecutor's office
was conducting an investigation of the death. He noted that Interior
Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak had also ordered the commandant of
Poland's uniformed police, Gen. Josef Bejm, to study the incident.
An appeal signed by Walesa and six other Solidarity leaders inde
pendent trade union movement, condemned the death of Antonowicz
as "another act of lawlessness" by the police. It called on the govern
ment to end police abuses and to release political prisoners.
China, Libya To Expand Ties
PEKING — A senior Chinese official concluded a four-day visit to
Libya yesterday, and the official New China News Agency said the
two countries had pledged to expand their economic links.
At the same time, the agency, in a dispatch from Tripoli, gave con
siderable coverage to Libya's denunciation of the Reagan Adminis
tration's reported plan to undermine the regime of the Libyan leader,
Col. Muammar Khadafy.
China and Libya have had diplomatic relations for the past seven
years, but Khadafy paid a visit to Peking in 1982. Chinese officials
have said that Khadafy attempted several years ago to buy nuclear
weapons from China or to get its technical assistance in a nuclear
program, but that China turned down the effort.
The Chinese official visiting Libya was Vice Premier Tian Jiyun,
who is making a tour of five African countries. The New China News
Agency said that at the end of Tian's stop in Tripoli, China and Libya
"expressed satisfaction over the remarkable progress in the eco
nomic and technological cooperation between the two countries."
Boesak To Fight for Passport
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Dissident clergyman and
president of the World Federation of Reformed Churches, Allan
Boesak, said yesterday that he would fight to get back his passport
which was withdrawn by the South African authorities.
"I do not intend to let this one go unchallenged," Boesak said.
"This is an act of petty vindictiveness, but even more serious is the
disregard, the contempt of the courts and the rule of law."
A spokesman for Interior Minister Stoffel Botha confirmed yester
day that Boesak's passport was withdrawn, although a court Monday
lifted some of the restrictions imposed on the anti-apartheid activist,
who is co-founder of the United Democratic Front and had ruled that
Boesak would be allowed to travel.
Boesak was planning to travel to the United States to accept the
Robert F. Kennedy humanitarian award, and then visit Sweden and
Switzerland.
Moscow Talks Make No Gains
MOSCOW — Secretary of State George Shultz wound up 14 hours
of "vigorous discussion" with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and
other Kremlin officials yesterday, saying the talks failed to narrow
the superpowers' differences on arms control.
. Shultz said that despite "serious disagreements," the two sides
had pledged to work hard in preparing the Nov. 19-20 summit
meeting between President Reagan and Gorbachev in Geneva.
"Basically, we have a lot to do," Shultz said.
In a news conference before departing for an overnight refueling
stop in Iceland, Shultz tempered his downbeat appraisal of the two
day visit by observing "we see some positive developments" in the
U.S.-Soviet relationship.
But he did not cite any major area of reconciliation or prospect of
an accord for the first superpower summit in more than six years.
He said later the four-hour session was "a very vigorous exchange
that covered everything."
He twice described the talks as "frank," which in diplomatic par
lance often means considerable disagreement.
Besides arms control, Shultz singled out regional issues and
human rights.
"As we broke up we wished for success at the upcoming Geneva
meeting and beyond and pledged to each other that we would work
hard for continuing preparations."
Afghans Hit Airport, Kill 70
NEW DELHI, India — Afghan rebel forces mounted a major at
tack on Shindand Air base in western Afghanistan last week, killing
70 Soviet soldiers and inflicting huge losses of material and equip
ment, resistance sources said here yesterday.
Quoting information received from the Afghan capital, Kabul, the
sources said that many Afghan government officers were arrested
later on charges of collaboration with the Moujahedeen rebels.
The Moujahedeen denied any collaboration with the government
soldiers in the attack on the heavily guarded airport.
In June a total of 20 Soviet MiG aircraft were destroyed at the air
port, which is in Herat province. Later the Kabul regime executed
Afghan pilots on charges of sabotaging the planes.
The sources also said that on Oct. 31, the rebels set ablaze nearly
80 Soviet gasoline tankers while they were passing through the
Salang Pass leading from the Soviet Union.

Poles Investigate Youth's Death
WARSAW, Poland -— The Polish government said yesterday that
senior officials had been assigned to investigate the death of a 19-
year-old honors student who was severely injured after the police
detained him in the northern city of Olsztyn.
The youth, Marcin Antonowicz, a first-year chemistry student at
Gdansk University, died Saturday, two weeks after receiving
massive head injuries while in police custody. Despite emergency
surgery, he never regained consciousness.
Nobel Peace Prize winner Lech Walesa and other leaders of the
outlawed Solidarity independent labor union movement have cited
the youth's death as an example of police brutality. But the govern
ment's chief spokesman said yesterday that a preliminary investiga
tion showed that Antonowicz was injured when he leaped from a
moving police van in an apparent effort to escape detention.
"There is nothing to indicate that the authorities are responsible
for the death of the young man," the spokesman, Jerzy Urban, said
at his regular weekly news conference.
The investigation, Urban said, so far supported the police position
that while Antonowicz was in the police van, he pushed an officer
aside, opened the rear door and jumped out, falling backward at a
speed of about 25 miles an hour and striking his head on the pave
ment. Urban said an autopsy found heavy bruises elsewhere on the
