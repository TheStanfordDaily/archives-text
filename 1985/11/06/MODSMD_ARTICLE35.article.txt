# Ex-defector says he was not pressured
## U.S. Allows Yurchenko To Return 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Vitaly Yurchenko, the So
viet spy who slipped from the ClA's grasp after
three months in America, was granted permis
sion to return to the Soviet Union yesterday
after assuring U.S. authorities he was leaving on
his own volition.
Yurchenko, clenching his hands over his head
like a victorious boxer, left the State Depart
ment after a half-hour meeting and declared,
"Yes, home" when asked if he was heading back
to the Soviet Union.
With four Soviet diplomats on one side and six
State Department officials, including a doctor, on
the other, Yurchenko had his first face-to-face
meeting with U.S. authorities since he walked
away from their custody over the weekend, after
three months in the United States.
Yurchenko had appeared at an extraordinary
news conference at the Soviet Embassy Mon
day, charging he had been abducted in Rome,

drugged and pumped for secrets in CIA
hideaways. The State Department denied the
charges, saying Yurchenko had voluntarily
defected.
As a result of his meeting yesterday,"the
United States government has decided that Mr.
Yurchenko's decision to return to the Soviet
Union was made of his own free will, and that he
is now free to leave the United States," State
Department spokesman Charles Redman said.
"In arranging this meeting we wanted to
satisfy ourselves that Mr. Yurchenko truly did
wish to return to the U.S.S.R. and that he made
this decison freely and of his own volition," Red
man said.
He said the meeting was held in an atmos
phere free of the possibility of Soviet coercion
and that Yurchenko was told he would not be
subject to U.S. detention or returned to Soviet
custody if he did not want to be.

The doctor determined there was no ob
servable evidence Yurchenko had been drugged,
"which could affect his behavior, or that he was
not competent to make his own decision to return
to the U.5.5.R.," Redman added. He said the
doctor made no direct physical examination of
Yurchenko but was "completely satisfied."
The U.S. delegation at the meeting was led by
William Woessner, acting chief of the Bureau of
European and Canadian Affairs. Victor Isakov,
the third ranking diplomat at the Soviet em
bassy, led the other side.
There was no immediate word on when Yur
chenko would leave the country.
Yurchenko, identified by U.S. intelligence ex
perts as the onetime head of the KGB's Ameri
can section, came to the United States in early
August and was in the custody of CIA officials
until last weekend.
