# Marcos Changes Stance on Election

### 
MANILA, Philippines â€” President Ferdinand
Marcos, reversing position, said yesterday that
he will let the Philippines' Parliament decide
whether to hold a special presidential election in
January, adding that he thought the vice
presidency should also be on the ballot.
Marcos' statements further muddied an issue
that has been unclear since he announced Sun
day on the ABC-TV program, "This Week With
David Brinkley," that he would call a special
presidential election and later set the balloting
for Jan. 17. He said then that he could order the
election through a presidential decree, but yes
terday he said that the decision would be left to
Parliament, now controlled by his ruling KBL
Party.

The Philippines constitution provides for spe
cial presidential elections in four instances: if the
president dies, is incapacitated, resigns or is im
peached. Marcos suggested that a fifth reason
could be established in law that would allow spe
cial elections to be called if a president deemed it
necessary to prevent "fundamental issues" from
upsetting the stability of the government.
The president's statement yesterday said,
however, that he would not use his decree
powers to change the law.
"We will throw everything to the Batasan
Pambansa (the parliament), and it is up to the
Batasan to decide whether to hold the special
elections or not."
The KBL will discuss the election procedures

in a caucus Friday. The plan then would be
placed before the parliament, which reconvenes
on Monday.
The opposition continued to demand yester
day that Marcos resign the presidency, and the
powers of the incumbent, if he wants to hold a
special election.
The United Nationalist Democratic Organiza
tion, whose president, former Sen. Salvador
Laurel, is an opposition front-runner for an elec
tion, called for the president's resignation.
Liberal Party leader Jovito Salonga agreed.
If Marcos did resign, a caretaker government
headed by the speaker of the assembly, KBL
stalwart Nicanor Yniguez, would rule during the
election campaign.
