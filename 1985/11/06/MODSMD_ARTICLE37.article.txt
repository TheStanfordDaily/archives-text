Abortion Hearings
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court,
taking up one of the most politically charged is
sues on its current docket, heard arguments
yesterday over how much authority the states
should have to restrict procedures for obtain
ing abortions.
But in nearly two hours of questions to
lawyers, the justices gave no indication they
were even considering a plea by the Reagan
Administration to go beyond the question of
state regulations and flatly overturn their con
troversial 1973 ruling establishing a constitu
tional right to abortion.
The Administration filed a "friend-of-the
court" brief last summer urging that unusual
step. "Pro-life" and "pro-choice" groups,
members of Congress and women's and medi
cal organizations jumped into the fray, filing
their own briefs with the justices, intensifying
the debate. But the court later refused to pro
vide extra time for government lawyers to
argue their case personally.
There also were further indications in yes
terday's hearing that procedural problems that
plague the two cases before the court could
force the justices to dispose of them later this
term without definitive rulings. Many of the
questions from the justices reflected concern
over those problems.
The court was urged to strike down laws in
Pennsylvania and Illinois that imposed an array
of procedural restrictions and requirements on
doctors performing abortions. The laws,
lawyers told the justices, intruded on the prin
ciples established in the court's 12-year-old
landmark in Roe vs. Wade.
But lawyers defending the laws countered
that the states should be permitted to make
sure women are fully informed about abortion

and to require abortion procedures that
protect an unborn child that could survive
outside the womb.
A decision by the justices is expected by
next spring.
Mormon Leader Dies
SALT LAKE CITY — Spencer Kimball, the
president and prophet of the Mormon Church
since 1973 and one of its most energetic
leaders until age and infirmity curtailed his
ministry, died last night. He was 90.
Kimball died at 9:08 p.m. at his Westin Hotel
Utah apartment of causes incident to age, said
church spokesman Don LeFevre. He said
Kimball's wife, Camilla, and a nurse were with
him at the time.
LeFevre said he had no other details on the
death and funeral arrangements were pending.
He said Gordon Hinckley, Kimball's second
counselor in the governing First Presidency,
had been notified.
Kimball, the 12th "prophet, seer and
revelator" of the 5.8 million-member Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, had been
in a weakened state since surgery Sept. 5,
1981 — his third operation in two years — and
was mostly confined to his apartment.
Election Roundup
Gerald Baliles was elected governor of Vir
ginia yesterday, keying a historic Democratic
sweep that gave the Old Dominion its first
black and first woman in statewide office. New
Jersey Republican Gov. Thomas Kean romped
to re-election with a landslide that gave the
GOP sway in the new state Assembly. In
featured off-year municipal contests, Houston

Mayor Kathy Whitmire won handily in a tough
re-election campaign in which AIDS was an
issue, and Democratic Mayor Ed Koch of New
York swept to a third term.
Detroit's Coleman Young, a heavy favorite,
held a growing lead in his try for a fourth term.
But six-term Miami Mayor Maurice Ferre, run
ning against 10 rivals, slipped into second place
behind Raul Masvidal, and a runoff appeared
likely.
On a night generally kind to the incumbents,
Cleveland's GOP Mayor George Voinovich
won two more years in office, while the first
black mayor of Charlotte, N.C., Democrat
Harvey Gantt, was re-elected, as well. Incum
bents Don Fraser in Minneapolis, George
Latimer of St. Paul, Richard Caliguiri of Pitts
burgh, Thirman Milner of Hartford, Conn., and
Terry Goddard of Phoenix, Ariz., won fresh
terms. In Louisville, Ky., Democrat Jerry
Abramson was elected mayor for the first
time.
Despite the presence of hundreds of local
candidates on the ballot, it was the races in
New Jersey and Virginia that were scoured for
signs of a national trend, and there was enough
encouragement for both sides to claim suc
cess.
Stocks Rise
NEW YORK — The stock market showed
broad strength yesterday as the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials set another record,
reflecting traders' hopes for non-inflationary
growth in the U. S. economy.
The Dow Jones average was stalled for
most of the day but surged in the final hours of
trading to close near the 1,400 level, rising
6.99 to a record 1396.67.

candidates on the ballot, it was the races in
New Jersey and Virginia that were scoured for
signs of a national trend, and there was enough
encouragement for both sides to claim suc
cess.
Stocks Rise
NEW YORK — The stock market showed
broad strength yesterday as the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials set another record,
reflecting traders' hopes for non-inflationary
growth in the U. S. economy.
The Dow Jones average was stalled for
most of the day but surged in the final hours of
trading to close near the 1,400 level, rising
6.99 to a record 1396.67.
Abortion Hearings
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court,
taking up one of the most politically charged is
sues on its current docket, heard arguments
yesterday over how much authority the states
should have to restrict procedures for obtain
ing abortions.
But in nearly two hours of questions to
lawyers, the justices gave no indication they
were even considering a plea by the Reagan
Administration to go beyond the question of
state regulations and flatly overturn their con
troversial 1973 ruling establishing a constitu
tional right to abortion.
The Administration filed a "friend-of-the
court" brief last summer urging that unusual
step. "Pro-life" and "pro-choice" groups,
members of Congress and women's and medi
cal organizations jumped into the fray, filing
their own briefs with the justices, intensifying
the debate. But the court later refused to pro
vide extra time for government lawyers to
argue their case personally.
There also were further indications in yes
terday's hearing that procedural problems that
plague the two cases before the court could
force the justices to dispose of them later this
term without definitive rulings. Many of the
questions from the justices reflected concern
over those problems.
The court was urged to strike down laws in
Pennsylvania and Illinois that imposed an array
of procedural restrictions and requirements on
doctors performing abortions. The laws,
lawyers told the justices, intruded on the prin
ciples established in the court's 12-year-old
landmark in Roe vs. Wade.
But lawyers defending the laws countered
that the states should be permitted to make
sure women are fully informed about abortion

and to require abortion procedures that
protect an unborn child that could survive
outside the womb.
A decision by the justices is expected by
next spring.
Mormon Leader Dies
SALT LAKE CITY — Spencer Kimball, the
president and prophet of the Mormon Church
since 1973 and one of its most energetic
leaders until age and infirmity curtailed his
ministry, died last night. He was 90.
Kimball died at 9:08 p.m. at his Westin Hotel
Utah apartment of causes incident to age, said
church spokesman Don LeFevre. He said
Kimball's wife, Camilla, and a nurse were with
him at the time.
LeFevre said he had no other details on the
death and funeral arrangements were pending.
He said Gordon Hinckley, Kimball's second
counselor in the governing First Presidency,
had been notified.
Kimball, the 12th "prophet, seer and
revelator" of the 5.8 million-member Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, had been
in a weakened state since surgery Sept. 5,
1981 — his third operation in two years — and
was mostly confined to his apartment.
Election Roundup
Gerald Baliles was elected governor of Vir
ginia yesterday, keying a historic Democratic
sweep that gave the Old Dominion its first
black and first woman in statewide office. New
Jersey Republican Gov. Thomas Kean romped
to re-election with a landslide that gave the
GOP sway in the new state Assembly. In
featured off-year municipal contests, Houston

Mayor Kathy Whitmire won handily in a tough
re-election campaign in which AIDS was an
issue, and Democratic Mayor Ed Koch of New
York swept to a third term.
Detroit's Coleman Young, a heavy favorite,
held a growing lead in his try for a fourth term.
But six-term Miami Mayor Maurice Ferre, run
ning against 10 rivals, slipped into second place
behind Raul Masvidal, and a runoff appeared
likely.
On a night generally kind to the incumbents,
Cleveland's GOP Mayor George Voinovich
won two more years in office, while the first
black mayor of Charlotte, N.C., Democrat
Harvey Gantt, was re-elected, as well. Incum
bents Don Fraser in Minneapolis, George
Latimer of St. Paul, Richard Caliguiri of Pitts
burgh, Thirman Milner of Hartford, Conn., and
Terry Goddard of Phoenix, Ariz., won fresh
terms. In Louisville, Ky., Democrat Jerry
Abramson was elected mayor for the first
time.
Despite the presence of hundreds of local
candidates on the ballot, it was the races in
New Jersey and Virginia that were scoured for
signs of a national trend, and there was enough
encouragement for both sides to claim suc
cess.
