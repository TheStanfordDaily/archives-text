# Stanford Lands Fill Palo Alto Coffers

### ERIC HEALY Staff writer 
Revenues generated by Stanford lands
for the City of Palo Alto have more than
doubled in the last four years, according
to the University's director of Community
Relations.
The director, Andy Doty, said three
sources of revenue — sales taxes, prop
erty taxes and net utility income —
totaled nearly $17.5 million in 1983-84 and
currently account for 39.7 percent of Palo
Alto's income.
"The figures point out the significance

of Stanford in our revenue strain," said
Bill Zaner, city manager of Palo Alto.
The figures are based on sales taxes,
property taxes and net utility income from
two areas of land that were placed under
Palo Alto's jurisdiction in the 19505. Area
one contains the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter, the Stanford Professional Center and
the Oak Creek Apartments. The other
area includes the Stanford Research Park.
Doty attributed the rapid growth in tax
revenues for the city to "expansion and
modernization" throughout the land areas.
He said he believes the lands have been
on a financial upswing for the "past 10
years" and that development has ac

celerated in the past few years. Two ex
amples are the $17 million modernization
of the shopping center and the "build-out"
of the Stanford Research Park, he said.
Doty received his figures on the land
revenues from Vicki Rudin, assistant to
the city manager. Rudin said the
"information is actually premature" in that
it has not yet been officially released by
the city council, a motion that Zaner char
acterized as "just a formality."
"I did Andy Doty a courtesy," Rudin
said, referring to the fact that she gave
Doty the figures to be used by University
President Donald Kennedy in a speech.
