# Espresso Bar Opens Friday
## Student Coffee House 
### MICHAEL GOFF Senior staff writer 
The Espresso Bar, a student-run enterprise con
ceived as an alternative to the Coffee House, is sched
uled to open its doors on campus this weekend in the
Bechtel International Center.
"We really need a place for students to hang out. . .
run by students, for students," said junior Lee Cline, a
key organizer of the project.
According to Cline, the idea was formulated by a
group of students who manned a boycott booth behind
the Coffee House earlier this year. The students were
protesting a Saga Corp. takeover of the Coffee House,
which had been owned and operated by the ASSU.
The group "found the I-Center for us (and) started
this thing rolling," but then decided to let others take
charge of the project, Cline said.
Espresso Bar organizer Leslie Leland, a member of
the ASSU Council of Presidents, noted that the center
will not charge the students to rent the space. The en
deavor will "open up the I-Center and provide a good
opportunity to have a pure student space," she said.
The center's director, Lee Zeigler, agreed, saying,
"We hope (The Espresso Bar) will attract more people
into the I-Center." He said the project "makes sense
as a programmatic activity."
Stipulations for the use of the center are that the
program provide a good environment for foreign and
other students, that it be a non-profit activity and that
the students manage the program themselves, Zeigler
said.
Leland said the students agree that the project
should be more than a food service. She said they plan
to have live student music and to serve "mostly coffee
and pastries."
Initial funds for the project are being provided
through a loan of $1,834.38 from the ASSU budget
reserve that was approved by the ASSU Senate last
night.
In addition, the Graduate Student Association (GSA)
is procuring machines for espresso and coffee that it in
tends to reclaim if the GSA sets up a graduate student
pub in the future, Cline said.
Restrictions on the ASSU loan stipulate that 50 per
cent is to be repaid three weeks after the funding al
location and the remainder by Jan. 1. In addition, the
appropriations committee added the condition that "no
employees shall be paid until the entire allocation has
been repaid."
Leland said the first three weeks of operation may
determine the future of the en
deavor because of the need to
repay the ASSU. "If people care,
then it will continue," she said.
"Students are out of the Coffee
House now," and Espresso Bar or
ganizers would like to attract this
group, she said.
Ellie Oppenheim, director of
Tresidder Union, said she was
aware of interest in a student-run

coffee house but said she had "no
concerns" about The Espresso Bar
competing with Tresidder food
services.
Leland emphasized the flexibility
of facilities and future plans. "If
people decide to make it political
(or) an interfraternity place, it's
flexible enough, because it's run by
students," she said.
1 he Espresso Bar will open this
Friday and Saturday from 8 p.m. to
11 p.m. Beginning next week, it
will be open Thursday as well, Cline
said.
