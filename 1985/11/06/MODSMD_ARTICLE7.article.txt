# Grant of $3.5 Million To Fight Blood Illness

### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
With the help of a $3.5 million grant from
the National Institutes of Health, re
searchers at the Stanford Medical Center
have started a new program for specialized
blood transfusion research.
The medical center has picked seven in
vestigators to take what the new pro
gram's director, Dr. Carl Grumet, termed
"key steps" in research in areas that are

currently perplexing the medical commu
nity.
Grumet, associate professor of pathol
ogy, said the grant will help research ef
forts aimed at combating three diseases
that can be transmitted through blood
transfusions.
The AIDS (acquired immune deficiency
syndrome) virus, which so far has eluded
attempts at preventing its spread through
transfusions, will be a primary focus of the
program's work, according to Grumet. He said that re
search will revolve around the development of im
proved methods for detecting the virus and preventing
its transmission through the blood supply.
Grumet said the grant will also enable investigators
to continue trying to identify a cell receptor that the
AIDS virus could lock onto when it enters the
bloodstream.
The cytomegalovirus (CMV) will be another re
search target, according to Grumet, who said that the
infection this virus causes is the number one cause of
death following bone marrow transfusions. He said re

searchers will attempt to identify possible vaccine can
didates against the CMV virus and to develop more
efficient methods of screening CMV-contaminated
blood.
Research will also seek out ways of developing a
vaccine to combat the hepatitis-B virus, Grumet said.
He added that although a "surge in public concern"
about AIDS has magnified its relative impact on the
community at large, the hepatitis-B virus affects "far
more people" than the AIDS virus. The hepatitis and
cytomegalovirus research will thus have more of a
"long-term impact" on disease control than the AIDS
research, Grumet said.
The development of monoclonal antibodies will be an
important factor linking the separate paths of inquiry,
according to Grumet.
