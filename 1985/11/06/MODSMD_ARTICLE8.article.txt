# Wisconsin TAs Will Bargain Collectively
## Bill passes after years of work and two strikes at UW- Madison 
### TODD RAMMING Editorial staff 
Gov. Anthony of Wisconsin signed into
law last Wednesday a bill granting teaching assis
tants in the University of Wisconsin system the
right to bargain collectively.
Twenty-seven faculty members had urged re
jection of the bill, saying in a letter to legislators
that it would cause "dissension" and strain rela-

tions between faculty members and graduate
students.
About 3,300 teaching and program assistants
are covered by the bill, although research assis
tants are not, according to The Chronicle of
Higher Education.
According to Ross Finnie, president of the
Teaching Assistants Association (TAA), bargain
ing was necessary because "the university
imposes its own work rules and its own griev
ance procedures according to its own agenda."
Under the new law, which will take ef
fect July 1, TAs will be granted the same powers
of bargaining as are other state employees.
Under the new law, the UW system will be
divided into three units, UW-Madison, UW-

Milwaukee and the remaining campuses.
For a given unit to have an election, 30 per
cent of the voters must sign cards in support.
Elections are decided by a simple majority.
The first task of each unit will be to select its
bargaining unit representative. The TAA has
been the long-standing representative body at
UW-Madison and is expected to be reinstated un
der the new law.
The remaining two units will have to organize
their own unions, although the TAA "would be
willing to lend assistance to graduate students
across the state" in organizing, Finnie said.

Once a representative organization is selected
to represent the TAs of a given unit, the univer
sity system will have to "bargain in good faith"
with the chosen representative.
Although the TAs are forbidden from striking
due to their new status as government
employees, they would be able, under the new
law, to use such measures as "picketing" and
"working to rules," Finnie said.
Working to rules is a strategy by which
employees, in protest, work only enough to
satisfy the exact requirements as set down in the
contract.
Finnie considered the prohibition against strik
ing as no hardship. The requirements eas
tablished by the new law that forcc recognition
by the UW system of the bargaining unit repre
sentative "obviate the need for a strike," he
said.
Under the new law, the chosen representa
tives of the TAs will be bargaining with the de
partment of employee relations of the state, not
with the university system directly.
Public pressure may be a useful tool in future
bargaining since a government department will
be on one side of the negotiating table. "Publicity

will be a key tool," Finnie said.
TAs at UW-Madison have
been primarily concerned with
the provision of adequate
facilities and resources for teach
ing.
"People have not been pro
vided with enough space to
teach," Finnie said, citing a
drama course that was "being
taught out of what was essen
tially a store room."
Many TAs have also been
forced to pay for such day-to-day
supplies as Xerox copies out of
their own pockets, according to
Finnie.
"Hourly wage has never been
a big issue," Finnie added.
The fight for representation
has long been centered at the
UW-Madison campus, where ap
proximately two-thirds of the
TAs in the UW system are lo
cated.
From 1969 to 1980, TAs had a
collective-bargaining arrange
ment at the Madison campus,
where two strikes occurred.
The first strike, which hap
pened in 1970, arose when UW-
Madison refused to recognize
the TAA as the bargaining unit,
although graduate students had
previously selected it as their

representative, Finnie said.
According to a structure
agreement passed in the settle
ment of the strike, the UW-
Madison and the TAA would sub
mit to third party arbitration in
the event of an impasse in a
dispute.
By 1980, UW-Madison was
starting to reject arbitration
decisions.
"Just before a strike vote (was
taken by members of the TAA),
the university said they would
impose their own grievance pro
cedure," Finnie said.
This announcement forced a
strike, but "the strike was lost,"
according to Finnie.
Since 1980, UW-Madison has
been gradually withdrawing
gains made by students in the
19705, Finnie said.
"Rules themselves were
formed with no legitimate
graduate student input," Finnie
said.
In addition, "the administra
tion made the final decision in all
cases," Finnie said.
Finnie attributed passage of
the new bill to the "publicizing of
decisions (by the university) that
were so blatantly unfair to
graduate students" and the
realization that the system UW-
Madison was fostering was
"inherently flawed."
