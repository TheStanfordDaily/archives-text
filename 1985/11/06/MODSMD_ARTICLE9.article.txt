# New Study on the Pill Changes Little
## 
### KELLY SUND Staff writer 
Despite widespread attention, a
newly released government study
that concludes there is no correla
tion between the use of birth con
trol pills and the risk of contracting
breast cancer is actually a
"confirmation" of research done
previously on the subject, accord
ing to an oncology professor here.
"This really wasn't a new study,"
said Dr. Frank Stockdale, professor
of medicine and oncology and direc
tor of a new breast cancer clinic at
the Stanford Medical Center.
The study of more than 4,000
women, conducted by the National
Institutes of Health and the Centers
for Disease Control and released
Thursday, found that oral contra
ceptive users under age 45 are no
more likely to develop breast can
cer than other women, regardless of
the age they begin using the pill or
the length of time they use it.
The study, the largest ever made
on the possible connection between
birth control pills and breast cancer,
also concluded that whether a
woman begins taking the pill before

or after the birth of her first child
does not affect her chances of de
veloping breast cancer.
"Most studies have never shown
a relationship (between use of the
pill and incidence of breast can
cer)," Stockdale said.
The study has received
widespread attention primarily be
cause it was large and conducted by
the government, Stockdale said.
The imDortance of the study was

its contradiction of other smaller
studies, Stockdale said. An investi
gation at the University of Southern
California indicated a possible link
between early use of the pill and
breast cancer. A 1983 study in Brit
ain and a 1985 report from Sweden
implied a link, but these studies
were also done on a smaller scale.
Stockdale said it is "quite clear
there has not been an increase in
the incidence (of breast cancer),"
although there has been "an in
crease in the use of the pill."
In the newly released study, re
searchers selected 2,088 women
aged 20 to 44 who were diagnosed
between 1980 to 1982 as having
breast cancer and compared them
with an equal number of women of
the same ages who did not have the
disease. Each woman was inter
viewed to determine if she had used
birth control pills. If so, she was
questioned regarding the dosage,
brand, length of time the pills were
used and age at which use began.
An additional finding of the study
was that the amount of the
hormone progesterone contained in
the pill does not appear to affect the
incidence of breast cancer.
