# AIDS: What it means for Stanford
## Why this issue? 
### 
AIDS (Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome) has
dominated the media, ab
sorbed the attention of our
policy makers, and provoked
our fears. Our understanding
of the disease is complicated
by the ever-changing scientific
evidence. There have been
cases of AIDS at Stanford. In
light of this, an informed com
munity is of even more impor
tance.
This issue of The Student
Body examines what AIDS is,
and what it means for the
Stanford community. It is an
attempt to. help you answer
"What can I do to reduce my
risk of getting AIDS?"

We hope you will gain suffi
cient information to separate
myth from fact in order to
make informed personal deci
sions. AIDS raises concerns
about sexual practices,
seeming to emphasize the
"Don'ts." Clearly there are
sexual behaviors which are
high risk and should be
avoided. However, the infor
mation here is intended to
provide guidance for each of
us to make the best possible
personal decisions.
Some of the language in this
issue of The Student Body is
explicit. While this may be un
comfortable for some, the
dangers now associated with
transmission of disease

through sexual contact make it
essential that those who are or
are planning to become
sexually active, understand
which sexual practices are
"safer" and which are not.
This is not the time for
delicacy but for clear terminol
ogy.
Because the evidence is
changing rapidly, we at Cowell
offer this not as the last word

on AIDS, but the latest. We
hope to keep the Stanford
community as up to date on
the issues as possible.
