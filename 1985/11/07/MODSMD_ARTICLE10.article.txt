# How to talk, when to talk, what to talk about AIDS
## 
### 
It is clear to most people
who have been following the
AIDS crisis that AIDS is
primarily a sexually transmit
ted disease. Being sexually
transmitted means it is a be
havioral disease, a disease of
what we do and don't do.
What does this mean for
each of us practically? It
means we have to evaluate our
sexual practices and deci
sions. Even more tricky is the
importance of finding out our
partner's sexual history in or
der for us to make more in
formed decisions.
So, why is it so difficult to
discuss our sexual pasts in or
der to make more comfortable
decisions now? It is difficult
because most of us have this
firm belief that talking takes
away from doing. Talking, es
pecially about matters as
sensitive as one's previous
sexual relationships, is felt to
decrease spontaneity and to
take away some of the mystery
of a sexual encounter. It can
be experienced as a wall put
up in front of the wave of pas
sion and sexual excitement.
Talking disrupts the flow.
In addition, talking about
sex or concerns about sexually

transmitted disease intro
duces negative aspects into an
otherwise romantic moment.
All of a sudden images of
disease, lesions, and risks
replace a pounding heart.
Also, you may worry that
your partner may think you
may have a reason to ask. You
may be concerned that he or
she assumes there is a prob
lem.
So, what happens if you
don't talk? As nice a defense
mechanism as denial is, it may
not work for you. The result:
• fear for what you didn't
clarify;
• uncertainty about what may
happen to you in the future;
• concern about what you
may transmit to other
partners;
• possibility of ignoring physi
cal symptoms that occur;
• WORRY!!!
Additionally, not discussing
an issue as important as sex
and your sexual past may set a
pattern in the relationship of
not talking openly and of not
confronting important con
cerns.
We offer the following
guidelines for talking with
your partner.

How to Talk
Be direct. Be prepared to
talk about your past experi
ence. Persist even if the other
person wants to brush your
concerns aside. Be prepared
to postpone or not have
sexual relations if the other
person isn't responsive to
your concerns or is not taking
you seriously.
When to Talk
Timing is always the key.
Admittedly, discussing these
issues is difficult because it
may appear that you are as
suming intimacy and your
partner is not. However,
• it is much better to talk
before you get physically inti
mate. This is the best time to
discuss the kind of intimacy
you are comfortable with.
• if you don't talk before the
passion becomes the mo
ment, you can always stop the
process at any point. While
this may be awkward, it still
saves you from worrying and
from being exposed to some
thing you could have
prevented.
• if you were sexually inti
mate, it is still important to

talk. It is never too late. You
can learn that there was noth
ing to worry about, that you
want to use condom protected
sex or sexual practices that do
not include an exchange of
body fluids, or that you decide
not to have sex again with this
person.
What to Say
• Acknowledge the awkward
ness or difficulty in talking.
• Acknowledge the
caring/affection/desire you
feel for the person.
• Volunteer information
about yourself.
• Ask for their sexual history.
• Come up with a plan to
gether.
• View talking together as a
process and not a one-time
event.
We offer some hypothetical
examples of conversations be
tween two people. While the
language may not be your
style, adapt those concepts
which seem more appropri
ate.
Please keep in mind that any
attempts to write down con
versations like these will ap
pear contrived. They are only
meant as a guide for possible
directions in a conversation.
You may want to practice
what you are going to say
beforehand, even though it
may feel awkward. If you can
talk about this, you can talk
about other difficult things in
your relationship.
1) Jane to John 1) This is hard
to talk about and I want you to
know that I really care about
you. I'd like for us to sleep to
gether and I think we'd better
talk. I want you to know I am
not a virgin. I've slept with
several other guys in the past.
As far as I know I've never had
herpes and I don't think I've
been exposed to any other
sexually transmitted diseases.
But I can't be 100 percent for
sure. I hope you understand

why we need to talk about this
and why I need to know about
you. . . .(John
replies). . .Since we have both
been sexually involved with
other people and need to
protect each other, I'd like for
us to use condoms if we are
going to have intercourse. I'm
planning to use a diaphram for
contraception.
2) Dave to Susan
There is something I need to
tell you. I really like you a lot
and going to bed with you was
great. I feel bad I didn't men
tion this before, but I want to
tell you now. I had sex with a
male friend of mine a while
ago. After.that, I decided it
wasn't for me. With every
thing in the newspapers about
AIDS, I feel a little worried.
We are still friends and he
seems healthy — but it's still
on my mind. I would feel bet
ter if we used condoms and
foam from now on. If you are
uncomfortable with that, we
can still make each other feel
good without having inter
course. How do you feel
about this?
3) Peter and Robert
Robert: Peter, I need to talk
with you about something. It's
not easy and I hope you don't
think I'm assuming too much.
We've been spending a lot of
time together and before we
get more physical, I think we
should talk about AIDS.
Peter: I'm attracted to you
too, Robert, and I'm glad you
brought this up because it has
been on my mind lately. I've
been hesitating to talk about
sex and AIDS. I don't want to
take any chances and I don't
want you to take any either.
Robert: I feel the same way.
I'd like us to use condoms and
spermicidal jelly as a lubricant.
(Conversation continues.
Peter and Robert decide not to
have oral sex and to try only
dry kissing.) I'm glad we fi
nally talked about this.
