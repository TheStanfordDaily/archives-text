# What we know:
## Transmission of the AIDS virus 
### 
Dr. Edgar Engleman of the
Stanford Medical Center
recently offered the following
comments on AIDS to the
Stanford community:
At-risk populations
Current information indi
cates that: (bullet) Approxi
mately 73 percent of AIDS
patients in this country are
homosexual or bisexual men.
This figure has remained
relatively constant since the
outbreak was first noted in
1981. (bullet) Seventeen per
cent of cases have been illicit
drug users who inject drugs
into their blood, and
presumably have been
exposed to the virus by use of
virus-contaminated needles.
(bullet) Approximately two
percent of AIDS victims have
contracted the disease
through transfusion of blood
or blood products con
taminated with the AIDS virus.
(bullet) One perent of AIDS
patients to date appear to have
acquired the virus during inti
mate heterosexual contact. Six
percent of AIDS patients do
not fit in to any of the above
categories.
Casual contact
There is no evidence at this
time that the AIDS virus can be
transmitted through the use of
public swimming pools, spas,
hot tubs, showers, or toilets
used previously by an infected
individual, or by "rubbing
shoulders" with an AIDS pa
tient or carrier in a theater,
store, or work place. The virus
does not survive in water and
no cases have been reported

involving documented trans
mission through the air.
Similarly, there is no evidence
that AIDS can be contracted
from dishes, food or personal
objects touched by a patient
or carrier. All available
evidence indicates that the

through a transfer of body
fluids, either through intimate
contact or intravenous injec
tion.
Infectivity
Despite the overwhelming
symptoms seen in infected
patients, the AIDS virus ap
pears not to be highly con
tagious. The fact that there
have been no reported cases
of full-blown AIDS among
health care workers in the
United States (as of October
1985) specifically linked to oc
cupational exposure supports
this. Exposure, refers not only
to the direct care of these
patients or to the handling of
food, blood, bedpans, etc.,
but also to numerous inci

dents of exposure to poten
tially infected body fluids.
In the United States, there
have now been more than 200
"AIDS needlestick injuries",
many followed for more than
two years. At this date, only

two victims have even
developed antibodies to the
AIDS virus.
These data, while not
definitive, suggest that not
only exposure to blood or inti
mate sexual contact is usually
required for infection but also
that the amount of virus to
which an individual is exposed
is critical. Repeated exposure
to the virus may also play a
role in susceptibility.
The wide spectrum of con
ditions associated with the
AIDS virus (from full-blown
AIDS, to AIDS related complex
(ARC), to asymptomatic carri
ers) also shows the variability
of possible outcomes follow
ing exposure to the virus.
There may be different "co

factors" which increase the
likelihood of becoming infec
ted. Individuals such as in
travenous drug users and
those with multiple sexual
partners are more likely to
have been exposed to other
infections and are more likely
to be infected.
AIDS, ARC, and the carrier state
Currently, there are approx
imately 13,000 reported cases
of the full-blown AIDS
syndrome in this country.
There are at least five times as
many patients with
symptomatic AIDS related
conditions. Beyond these indi
viduals, however, there are
perhaps one million individ
uals without symptoms but in
fected with the virus â€” the
vast majority of whom are un
aware they are infected. These
individuals represent a major
potential source of new infec
tions since, as far as we know,
they are fully capable of trans
mitting the virus to others. Of
those individuals who are in
fected with the virus, approxi
mately five to 20 percent are
expected to contract full
blown AIDS over a five year
period, perhaps an additional
30 to 40 percent will contract
one of the lesser AIDS related
conditions, and perhaps 50
percent will remain as
asymptomatic "carriers"
There is reason to believe that
infected individuals remain in
fected, and potentially infec
tious for life. Even among
those who show symptoms,
the time from initial exposure
to the onset of symptoms

averages three years and
ranges from six months to five
years or more.
The crucial issue is that at
the present time, most of the
individuals carrying the virus
and capable of transmitting it
to others are unaware of their
status and do not feel ill. It
seems likely that a number of
such carriers are working or
going to school at Stanford,
and that those individuals who
are known to have
symptomatic AIDS related
conditions represent only
about half of the group infec
ted with the AIDS virus.
Testing
What is the status of our
current ability to test individ
uals for the presence of the
AIDS virus? At present, the
only routine testing that can
be carried out is for detection
of the antibody to the AIDS
virus, not for the virus itself.
The presence of the antibody
to the AIDS virus documents
prior exposure to the virui Jut
does not indicate whether an
individual is likely to develop
AIDS. Furthermore, the test as
currently available is associ
ated with an incidence of false
positive and false negative
results. Use of the test for
evaluation of individual
patients, therefore, is limited
since no treatment exists for
those found to be infected. If
in the future tests are
developed for the detection of
infectious virus, then consid
erable thought and discussion
will have to be given to how
such tests should be used.
