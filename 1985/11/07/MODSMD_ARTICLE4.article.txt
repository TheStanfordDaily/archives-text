# The 						other epidemic

AIDS touches each of us . . . heterosex
ual, homosexual man, woman, child. The
virus may not have entered out body — but
fear has.
AIDS is a disease we are all afraid of, with
good cause. It kills. There is no cure cur
rently. This raises anger and frustration.
One irrational way of dealing with these
feelings is to focus on a group to blame, a
group we can distance ourselves from.
Tragically, fear and anger become directed
at those primarily victimized by this fatal
disease. Equally tragic, pointing the finger —
in fear, in anger, in jest, in self
righteousness — may reinforce the myth
that we do not need to protect ourselves
and others we care about.
We can be afraid of disease, or disagree
with a particular lifestyle. It is unethical,
however, to deal with people as if they were
a disease. AIDS is an issue in all of our lives.

Displacing fear and frustration towards indi
viduals who are homosexual does not elimi
nate the disease. AIDS does not assault us
because of who we are. The virus does not
discriminate, humans do.
We ask that each member of the Stanford
community examine his or her emerging at
titudes and the way these attitudes are ex
pressed, overtly or subtly. Our hope is that
we all focus on what we have in common,
rather than our differences. This attitude will
prevent fear from infecting us.
