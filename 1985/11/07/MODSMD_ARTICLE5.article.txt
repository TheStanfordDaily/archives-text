# Risks for heterosexuals
## 
### John Dorman, M.D. Associate Director of Medicine 
Given the current level of knowledge (as of
October 1985) about AIDS, what are the risks to
the heterosexual population? The following is a
summary of important points to consider for
the heterosexual population at Stanford:
• Those who are not sexually active at all and
do not use IV drugs do not seem to be at any
risk at present.
• Since the disease is not transmitted by casual
contact, and blood transfusions are no longer a
risk.
• There is no question that AIDS can be trans
mitted by heterosexual intercourse. In Africa
there are as many infected women as men.
Many authorities believe that in most sexually
transmitted diseases, transmission occurs less
easily from women to men than from men to
women.
• Sexually active women may be more likely to
be infected than heterosexual men, since the
women may be infected by bisexual men. Het
erosexual men would likely only be infected by
prostitutes who are frequent IV drug abusers
(50 percent in New York City) and who may

have contact with bisexual men. In the future,
men may be more at risk as the asymptomatic
carrier rate increases in women.
• Women who have a positive antibody test for
the virus should defer having children until the
significance of a positive test is better under
stood.
• Quite obviously, the more partners you have
the more you place yourself at risk. Also, multi
ple partners increases the risk of other infec
tions which can suppress the immune system.
Keep in mind that there is a long (2-5 years) in
cubation period from the time of infection to
the onset of symptoms, so that you really need
to know your potential partner's sexual
practices over the past five years.
• Truly "safe sex" can only be defined as a
mutually monogamous sexual relationship with
someone you've known for over 5 years. Con
doms and contraceptive foam seem to provide
protection, but it is probably not 100 percent
certain. Anal intercourse is the highest risk
practice, perhaps because of tissue injury.
Tissue injury allows semen to enter tears in the
rectal mucosa. Oral-genital sex carries risk as
well, since transmission of body fluids occurs.
