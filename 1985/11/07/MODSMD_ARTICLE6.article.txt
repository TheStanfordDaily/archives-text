# Can a student with AIDS continue at Stanford?
## 
### 
I have been asked, "Can a
student continue at Stanford if
he or she contracts AIDS?"
The answer is, "Yes." Given
the current understanding of
AIDS, there is little likelihood
that the University would say
to a student that he or she can
not be here if the student
were suffering from AIDS.
Having said that, we also know
that students with AIDS often
decide themselves to leave
fully or partially; to not carry
on their studies, or to con
tinue their studies but not to
live in a campus setting.
There have been examples
of students with terminal il
lnesses having been admitted
to Stanford, examples of stu
dents having continued here
after having contracted a fatal
illness, and examples of stu
dents having been graduated
with a terminal disease. The
medical staff, faculty, and
deans have always worked
with the individual situation —
trying to provide support,
comfort, an academic load
that the student can handle,
and living and other amenities
that make sense for the stu
dent and his or her situation.
We won't change that ap
proach in the case of students
with AIDS. To the contrary, we

will continue to respond to
each individual's situation on
its own terms.
"But AIDS is contagious;
doesn't having someone
around with AIDS put other
students at risk?" Indeed it is
contagious — but only
through very specific and inti
mate sexual contacts, sharing
of needles (intravenous injec
tion of drugs), and, less com
monly, through infected
blood or its components.
There is simply no evidence
that the AIDS virus is
tramsmitted casually and
through usual day-to-day stu
dent contacts.
Nevertheless, roommates
and friends might have con
cerns about their risk of con
tracting the disease. These are
matters that the University
health and support staff will
help students with AIDS and
others deal with and make
decisions about. The Univer
sity clearly does not wish to
put other students at risk. Vet
we want to do all that can rea
sonably be done to make it
possible for an AIDS victim to
continue his or her studies for
as long as he or she wants and
feels able to do so.
