# AIDS: Risks for gays
## 
### Carlos Greaves, M.D., Psychiatrist at Psychological Services 
Although the issue of AIDS
concerns all of us, this article
addresses issues particularly
relevant to the gay individual.
There is no question about the
profound impact that AIDS
has had on gay men and on
the gay community as a whole.
This epidemic has affected gay
men in far greater numbers
than any other single group in
society. The reasons for this
relate to the particular biology
of the HTLV-III virus, the
unique epidemiology of the
disease and sociologi
cal/behavioral factors directly
related to gay sexuality.
The large number of sexual
partners among urban gays ac
counts for the rapid spread of
the virus in gay centers across
the United States, in Europe
and Australia. This phenome
non is responsible for the shift
in gender distribution from an
infection that affects men and
women on a 1:1 ratio in

Central Africa (where it most
likely originated) to the 14:1
ratio in this country.
The following facts provide
an ideal triad for transmission:
• the HTLV-111 virus exists in
semen in the highest concen
tration of all body fluids;
• direct contact with iDlood is
by far the most effective mode
of transmission; and
• minute capillary injuries oc
cur in the rectal mucosa
during anal intercourse.
The vaginal mucosa, al
though less fragile than the
rectal, also suffers minute in
juries from friction during in
tercourse. This explains
transmission among hetero
sexual partners. Other sexual
modes of transmission prob
ably include oral-genital sex.
The clinical consequences
of this infection are extremely
serious. At this point, approxi
mately 5 to 20 percent of those
infected with the virus will die
in the next 8 years from a
profound suppression of their
immunological system.

For a gay man with AIDS,
facing the probability of death
is preceded by psychologically
devastating losses: his job,
physical strength, body image,
social roles, independence,
economical resources, mental
acuity and even friends and
family. There is also the added
social stigma of being identi
fied as a member of a group
which has been discriminated
against, as well as the stigma
that accompanies both
promiscuity and venereal
disease. In this sense those
close to someone with AIDS
are not only afraid of being
contaminated by a biological
agent but also afraid of "moral
contamination."
The paradox for gay men is
that something which is a life
affirming pleasurable act
could be associated with a
deadly outcome. This is hard
to comprehend. An emerging
social concern resulting from
the spread of AIDS is homop
hobia at two levels. The first is
