# AIDS: Risks for gays
## 
### Carlos Greaves, M.D., Psychiatrist at Psychological Services 
Although the issue of AIDS
concerns all of us, this article
addresses issues particularly
relevant to the gay individual.
There is no question about the
profound impact that AIDS
has had on gay men and on
the gay community as a whole.
This epidemic has affected gay
men in far greater numbers
than any other single group in
society. The reasons for this
relate to the particular biology
of the HTLV-III virus, the
unique epidemiology of the
disease and sociologi
cal/behavioral factors directly
related to gay sexuality.
The large number of sexual
partners among urban gays ac
counts for the rapid spread of
the virus in gay centers across
the United States, in Europe
and Australia. This phenome
non is responsible for the shift
in gender distribution from an
infection that affects men and
women on a 1:1 ratio in

Central Africa (where it most
likely originated) to the 14:1
ratio in this country.
The following facts provide
an ideal triad for transmission:
• the HTLV-111 virus exists in
semen in the highest concen
tration of all body fluids;
• direct contact with iDlood is
by far the most effective mode
of transmission; and
• minute capillary injuries oc
cur in the rectal mucosa
during anal intercourse.
The vaginal mucosa, al
though less fragile than the
rectal, also suffers minute in
juries from friction during in
tercourse. This explains
transmission among hetero
sexual partners. Other sexual
modes of transmission prob
ably include oral-genital sex.
The clinical consequences
of this infection are extremely
serious. At this point, approxi
mately 5 to 20 percent of those
infected with the virus will die
in the next 8 years from a
profound suppression of their
immunological system.

For a gay man with AIDS,
facing the probability of death
is preceded by psychologically
devastating losses: his job,
physical strength, body image,
social roles, independence,
economical resources, mental
acuity and even friends and
family. There is also the added
social stigma of being identi
fied as a member of a group
which has been discriminated
against, as well as the stigma
that accompanies both
promiscuity and venereal
disease. In this sense those
close to someone with AIDS
are not only afraid of being
contaminated by a biological
agent but also afraid of "moral
contamination."
The paradox for gay men is
that something which is a life
affirming pleasurable act
could be associated with a
deadly outcome. This is hard
to comprehend. An emerging
social concern resulting from
the spread of AIDS is homop
hobia at two levels. The first is
the general societal reinforce
ment of negative attitudes
about homosexuals. The
second is the incorporation of
those attitudes by gays them
selves; leading to old guilt
feelings, alienation, and self
hate.
As medicine has not yet
developed effective im
munologic prevention (a
vaccine) or effective treatment
(a cure) the only way to com
bat this epidemic is with edu
cation. This basically means a
change in one's sexual atti
tudes and practices. Foremost
are two actions:
• the universal use of con
doms; and
• the drastic reduction of
promiscuous behavior, or bet
ter, its elimination.
While condom use is not ab
solute protection against the
spread of the virus, it is one of
the safer sexual practices. Uni
versal use of condoms means
covering the penis with a con
dom always, regardless of the
sexual act being performed
(fellatio, anal intercourse,
mutual masturbation, body
rubbing, etc.). Spermicides or
contraceptive gels are known
to kill the HTLV-111 virus. It
makes sense then to use them
for lubrication purposes. Ap
plying gel inside the condom
before covering the penis with
it would be helpful in case of
an unexpected break in the
condom.
Dealing with the logistics of
condoms, during the heat of
passion, particularly if you are
not familiar with them, can
have the effects of a cold
shower. Probably the best
thing to do is to become

thoroughly familiar with
them: buy some and test them
out on your own. Begin to
eroticize their use so that they
can become part of your rep
ertoire of foreplay techniques
and behaviors. With the AIDS
epidemic, condoms have to
become an integral part of the
sexual act rather than a both
ersome hindrance. Develop
ing more sophisticated
masturbatory practices can
become quite important in
these days of serious sexual
dangers.
Exchange of saliva while kis
sing remains controversial, yet
most experts agree that the
likelihood of transmission via
this route is small. However,
considering the stakes, you
may want to reserve intimate
kissing for someone very spe
cial, if at all.
Reducing promiscuous be
haviors means avoiding sexual
encounters with people you
do not know. It means drasti
cally reducing the number of
sexual partners you do have
and learning as much as you
can about their health and
sexual history. Once a
friendship is established and
becomes special, the explora
tion of sexuality exists in a
context of trust and mutual
caring, undoubtedly a much
safer and enjoyable proposi
tion.
Implementing the above
recommendations is not a
simple matter, but it is crucial.
It entails changing formed
habits and this is always diffi
cult. The level of trust, knowl
edge and communication with
a prospective sexual partner
have to be much greater than
ever before. For many this

represents a loss of the spon
taneity, impulsivity and mys
tery that made casual sex so
compelling to begin with.
This health-conscious atti
tude means taking the risk of
talking about sex before both
partners have expressed
mutual desire. The risks in
volve the possibility of
premature rejection or of
being perceived as
presumptuous. But, is it really
such a big risk? The advantage
is the acquisition of respect
given the values of conscien
tiousness, responsibility,
maturity and assertiveness
that such an attitude conveys.
This can surely be a "turn-on"
for your partner.
For those in the process of
"coming-out," AIDS poses a
serious dilemma. The reaf
firmation of a gay identity is
not only based on the individ
ual's perception of his or her
capacity to love members of
one's own sex, but also in the
actual experience of satisfying
sexual acts. Hopefully, the
eagerness to go through such
experiences will be matched
by a high degree of caution
and good judgement: in other
words, the strict observance
of "safe sex" practices. A
homosexual lifestyle is still a
valid way of being in the
world.
It is very important for gay
men as well as for all of us to
maintain a distinction be
tween an infectious agent
leading to a lethal illness in
any person, and the
homosexual or bisexual life
style. The blurring of this dis
tinction leads to unnecessary
fallout from a disease which
has enough tragedy associated
with it.

the safer sexual practices. Uni
versal use of condoms means
covering the penis with a con
dom always, regardless of the
sexual act being performed
(fellatio, anal intercourse,
mutual masturbation, body
rubbing, etc.). Spermicides or
contraceptive gels are known
to kill the HTLV-111 virus. It
makes sense then to use them
for lubrication purposes. Ap
plying gel inside the condom
before covering the penis with
it would be helpful in case of
an unexpected break in the
condom.
Dealing with the logistics of
condoms, during the heat of
passion, particularly if you are
not familiar with them, can
have the effects of a cold
shower. Probably the best
thing to do is to become

thoroughly familiar with
them: buy some and test them
out on your own. Begin to
eroticize their use so that they
can become part of your rep
ertoire of foreplay techniques
and behaviors. With the AIDS
epidemic, condoms have to
become an integral part of the
sexual act rather than a both
ersome hindrance. Develop
ing more sophisticated
masturbatory practices can
become quite important in
these days of serious sexual
dangers.
Exchange of saliva while kis
sing remains controversial, yet
most experts agree that the
likelihood of transmission via
this route is small. However,
considering the stakes, you
may want to reserve intimate
kissing for someone very spe

Reducing promiscuous be
haviors means avoiding sexual
encounters with people you
do not know. It means drasti
cally reducing the number of
sexual partners you do have
and learning as much as you
can about their health and
sexual history. Once a
friendship is established and
becomes special, the explora
tion of sexuality exists in a
context of trust and mutual
caring, undoubtedly a much
safer and enjoyable proposi
tion.
Implementing the above
recommendations is not a
simple matter, but it is crucial.
It entails changing formed
habits and this is always diffi
cult. The level of trust, knowl
edge and communication with
a prospective sexual partner
have to be much greater than
ever before. For many this

represents a loss of the spon
taneity, impulsivity and mys
tery that made casual sex so
compelling to begin with.
This health-conscious atti
tude means taking the risk of
talking about sex before both
partners have expressed
mutual desire. The risks in
volve the possibility of
premature rejection or of
being perceived as
presumptuous. But, is it really
such a big risk? The advantage
is the acquisition of respect
given the values of conscien
tiousness, responsibility,
maturity and assertiveness
that such an attitude conveys.
This can surely be a "turn-on"
for your partner.
For those in the process of
"coming-out," AIDS poses a
serious dilemma. The reaf
firmation of a gay identity is
not only based on the individ
ual's perception of his or her
capacity to love members of
one's own sex, but also in the
actual experience of satisfying
sexual acts. Hopefully, the
eagerness to go through such
experiences will be matched
by a high degree of caution
and good judgement: in other
words, the strict observance
of "safe sex" practices. A
homosexual lifestyle is still a
valid way of being in the
world.
It is very important for gay
men as well as for all of us to
maintain a distinction be
tween an infectious agent
leading to a lethal illness in
any person, and the
homosexual or bisexual life
style. The blurring of this dis
tinction leads to unnecessary
fallout from a disease which
has enough tragedy associated
with it.
Although the issue of AIDS
concerns all of us, this article
addresses issues particularly
relevant to the gay individual.
There is no question about the
profound impact that AIDS
has had on gay men and on
the gay community as a whole.
This epidemic has affected gay
men in far greater numbers
than any other single group in
society. The reasons for this
relate to the particular biology
of the HTLV-III virus, the
unique epidemiology of the
disease and sociologi
cal/behavioral factors directly
related to gay sexuality.
The large number of sexual
partners among urban gays ac
counts for the rapid spread of
the virus in gay centers across
the United States, in Europe
and Australia. This phenome
non is responsible for the shift
in gender distribution from an
infection that affects men and
women on a 1:1 ratio in

Central Africa (where it most
likely originated) to the 14:1
ratio in this country.
The following facts provide
an ideal triad for transmission:
• the HTLV-111 virus exists in
semen in the highest concen
tration of all body fluids;
• direct contact with iDlood is
by far the most effective mode
of transmission; and
• minute capillary injuries oc
cur in the rectal mucosa
during anal intercourse.
The vaginal mucosa, al
though less fragile than the
rectal, also suffers minute in
juries from friction during in
tercourse. This explains
transmission among hetero
sexual partners. Other sexual
modes of transmission prob
ably include oral-genital sex.
The clinical consequences
of this infection are extremely
serious. At this point, approxi
mately 5 to 20 percent of those
infected with the virus will die
in the next 8 years from a
profound suppression of their
immunological system.

For a gay man with AIDS,
facing the probability of death
is preceded by psychologically
devastating losses: his job,
physical strength, body image,
social roles, independence,
economical resources, mental
acuity and even friends and
family. There is also the added
social stigma of being identi
fied as a member of a group
which has been discriminated
against, as well as the stigma
that accompanies both
promiscuity and venereal
disease. In this sense those
close to someone with AIDS
are not only afraid of being
contaminated by a biological
agent but also afraid of "moral
contamination."
The paradox for gay men is
that something which is a life
affirming pleasurable act
could be associated with a
deadly outcome. This is hard
to comprehend. An emerging
social concern resulting from
the spread of AIDS is homop
hobia at two levels. The first is
the general societal reinforce
ment of negative attitudes
about homosexuals. The
second is the incorporation of
those attitudes by gays them
selves; leading to old guilt
feelings, alienation, and self
hate.
As medicine has not yet
developed effective im
munologic prevention (a
vaccine) or effective treatment
(a cure) the only way to com
bat this epidemic is with edu
cation. This basically means a
change in one's sexual atti
tudes and practices. Foremost
are two actions:
• the universal use of con
doms; and
• the drastic reduction of
promiscuous behavior, or bet
ter, its elimination.
