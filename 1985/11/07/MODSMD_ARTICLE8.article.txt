# The
						AIDS antibody test
## Should I or shouldn't I? 
### 
Currently there is no test for
AIDS itself but a test for
antibodies to the HTLV-111
virus. This virus is the cause of
AIDS.
Antibodies are substances
produced by the body to fight
infection. Once exposed to a
virus it takes the body some
time to produce antibodies. A
person may be infected with a
virus, but there may not have
been sufficient time for the
body to make the antibodies.
For this reason, an antibody
test may say that a person is
"negative" (the person
doesn't have antibody), but
the person may still have the
virus.
What does a positive result
mean?
A positive result may mean:
• A person has come in con
tact with the HTLV-111 virus.
• A person may spread the
virus to others via sexual con
tact or shared IV drug needles.
• A person may develop AIDS,
but current estimations are
that only up to 20 percent of
people with positive antibody
may develop disease over the
next 5 years.
• The blood test is wrong.
A positive result does not
mean:
• That you definitely have
AIDS.
• That you definitely will get
AIDS.
What does a negative result
mean?
A negative result may mean:
• A person has not come in

contact with the HTLV-111 virus
and does not have antibody to
HTLV-111.
• A person has come in con
tact with the HTLV-111 virus
and has not had sufficient time
to produce antibody.
• The test is wrong, and the
person really does have an
tibody.
What can I learn from having
the test done?
If the test result is accurate
and you have a positive test
result, this only means you
have come in contact with
HTLV-111 virus. It does not

The rationale for
the antibody test
was to improve the
safety of the blood
supply. All donated
blood is tested for

mean you have or will get
AIDS. Eighty percent of
people with a positive test will
not go on to develop full
blown AIDS in the next 5
years. This is not a test for
AIDS.
What won't I learn from
having the test done?
• You will not learn if you do
have AIDS — the test cannot
diagnose AIDS.

• You cannot learn that you
do not have AIDS. The test
cannot tell whether or not you
have the disease.
• Again, you may cause your
self undue stress and anxiety if
your result is positive.
Some students wish to be
tested in order to prevent the
spread of the virus to their
partners. By practicing what is
currently understood to be
"safe sex," individuals who
may have been exposed to the
virus should be able to
prevent its spread.
Remember that this test was
developed as a screening test
for blood donors. It was not
intended for individual clinical
evaluation. This test is wrongly
viewed by many to be' a test
for AIDS, rather than for
HTLV-111 exposure; conse
quently should a person's test
result be revealed, this could
result in:
• denial of life or health insur
ance;
• denial of employment or the
termination of employment;
• other forms of social and
economic discrimination.
For those people who wish
to be tested, test sites where
anonymity is assured are
available. If you are consider
ing being tested, please make
an appointment with a Cowell
physician.
