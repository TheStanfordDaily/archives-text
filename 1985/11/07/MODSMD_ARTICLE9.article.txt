# All about AIDS
## 
### 
AIDS (Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome) — a
serious condition charac
terized by a defect in natu
ral immunity against
disease. With this loss in
immune response, the indi
vidual falls prey to a host of
what are called
"opportunistic infections."
It is not highly contagious
and it is specifically trans
mitted through sexual con
tact, by shared needles or
by direct infusion of infec
ted blood or blood prod
ucts.
Antibody — protein
substance developed by
the body to fight disease
organisms. Not effective
against virus which is inside
cells.
ARC (AIDS Related Com
plex) — characterized by a
prolonged (two weeks) his
tory of fever, unexplained
weight loss, swollen lymph
nodes, and/or fungus infec
tion of mouth and throat. It
is not known what
percentage of people with
ARC or LAS (below) will go
on to develop full-blown
AIDS.
ARV (AIDS related virus) —
same as HTLV-111.
Carrier — Virus-infected in
dividuals with no
symptoms. Most of these
people are unaware that
they are infected. These in
dividuals represent a major
potential source of new in
fection since they are fully
capable of transmitting the
virus to others.
Cofactors — other charac
teristics of the individual
which may make them
more susceptible to the
AIDS virus.
False Negative — a negative
test in someone who in fact
has been infected by the
virus but for some reason
has not developed the an
tibody.
False Positive — a positive
test for HTLV-111 antibody,
usually a result of an artifact
of the laboratory test, in
someone who has not in
fact been exposed to the
virus. All persons with posi
tive results should have test
repeated at least once.
HTLV-111 (Human T-
Lymphotrophic Virus Type
III) — the virus that causes
AIDS.
Incubation Period — the
time between infection
with the AIDS virus and the
onset of symptoms. Seems
to range from 6 months to 5
years. Not everyone
exposed to the virus
develops the disease.

Involved Cells — the HTLV
III virus changes the
protein on the surface of T
-4 lymphocytes (helper
cells) in such a way to
prevent them from activat
ing B cells (antibody
producing cells) and killer
T-cells. Band T-cells are
responsible for fighting the
virus, but will not go into
action unless the T-4 sys
tem is intact. HTLV-111
destroys the T-4 cells.
Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) — a
type of cancer usually oc
curing on the surface of the
skin or in the mouth. KS
may also spread to other
organs of the body. Nor
mally found as a slowly
progressing cancer in el
derly men.
LAS (Lymphodenopathy
Syndrome) — disease of
the lymph nodes — part of
ARC.
LAV (Lymphodenopathy as
sociated virus) — same as
HTLV-111.
Opportunistic Infections —
illness which would not be
a threat to anyone whose
immune system was func
tioning normally.
Pneumocystic Carinii (PCP)
— a parasitic infection of
the lungs. One of the two
rare diseases that affect 85
percent of AIDS patients.
PCP has symptoms similar
to any other form of severe
pneumonia: cough, fever
and difficulty breathing.
This infection rarely if ever
affects individuals with nor
mal immunity.
Populations At Highest Risk
(descending order of risk)
— (1) sexually active
homosexual men with mul
tiple partners; (2) sexually
active bisexual men with
multiple partners; (3) pres
ent or past abusers of in
travenous drugs; (4)
prostitutes; (5) female
partners of bisexual men;
(6) heterosexual men and
women with multiple
partners.
"Safe Sex" — relatively
"safer sex" is condom
protected sex with the use
of spermicidal foam. Sexual
practices involving tissue
injury are extremely dan
gerous and should be
avoided. Oral sex carries
the potential of viral trans
mission.
Virus — minute, parasitic
organism which depends
on nutrients inside cells for
its metabolic and
reproductive needs. These
organisms cause a variety
of infectious diseases and
stimulate host antibodies.
Unlike a bacteria, unable to
survive long on its own.
Not affected by antibiotics.

stimulate host antibodies.
Unlike a bacteria, unable to
survive long on its own.
Not affected by antibiotics.
AIDS (Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome) — a
serious condition charac
terized by a defect in natu
ral immunity against
disease. With this loss in
immune response, the indi
vidual falls prey to a host of
what are called
"opportunistic infections."
It is not highly contagious
and it is specifically trans
mitted through sexual con
tact, by shared needles or
by direct infusion of infec
ted blood or blood prod
ucts.
Antibody — protein
substance developed by
the body to fight disease
organisms. Not effective
against virus which is inside
cells.
ARC (AIDS Related Com
plex) — characterized by a
prolonged (two weeks) his
tory of fever, unexplained
weight loss, swollen lymph
nodes, and/or fungus infec
tion of mouth and throat. It
is not known what
percentage of people with
ARC or LAS (below) will go
on to develop full-blown
AIDS.
ARV (AIDS related virus) —
same as HTLV-111.
Carrier — Virus-infected in
dividuals with no
symptoms. Most of these
people are unaware that
they are infected. These in
dividuals represent a major
potential source of new in
fection since they are fully
capable of transmitting the
virus to others.
Cofactors — other charac
teristics of the individual
which may make them
more susceptible to the
AIDS virus.
False Negative — a negative
test in someone who in fact
has been infected by the
virus but for some reason
has not developed the an
tibody.
False Positive — a positive
test for HTLV-111 antibody,
usually a result of an artifact
of the laboratory test, in
someone who has not in
fact been exposed to the
virus. All persons with posi
tive results should have test
repeated at least once.
HTLV-111 (Human T-
Lymphotrophic Virus Type
III) — the virus that causes
AIDS.
Incubation Period — the
time between infection
with the AIDS virus and the
onset of symptoms. Seems
to range from 6 months to 5
years. Not everyone
exposed to the virus
develops the disease.

Involved Cells — the HTLV
III virus changes the
protein on the surface of T
-4 lymphocytes (helper
cells) in such a way to
prevent them from activat
ing B cells (antibody
producing cells) and killer
T-cells. Band T-cells are
responsible for fighting the
virus, but will not go into
action unless the T-4 sys
tem is intact. HTLV-111
destroys the T-4 cells.
Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) — a
type of cancer usually oc
curing on the surface of the
skin or in the mouth. KS
may also spread to other
organs of the body. Nor
mally found as a slowly
progressing cancer in el
derly men.
LAS (Lymphodenopathy
Syndrome) — disease of
the lymph nodes — part of
ARC.
LAV (Lymphodenopathy as
sociated virus) — same as
HTLV-111.
Opportunistic Infections —
illness which would not be
a threat to anyone whose
immune system was func
tioning normally.
Pneumocystic Carinii (PCP)
— a parasitic infection of
the lungs. One of the two
rare diseases that affect 85
percent of AIDS patients.
PCP has symptoms similar
to any other form of severe
pneumonia: cough, fever
and difficulty breathing.
This infection rarely if ever
affects individuals with nor
mal immunity.
Populations At Highest Risk
(descending order of risk)
— (1) sexually active
homosexual men with mul
tiple partners; (2) sexually
active bisexual men with
multiple partners; (3) pres
ent or past abusers of in
travenous drugs; (4)
prostitutes; (5) female
partners of bisexual men;
(6) heterosexual men and
women with multiple
partners.
"Safe Sex" — relatively
"safer sex" is condom
protected sex with the use
of spermicidal foam. Sexual
practices involving tissue
injury are extremely dan
gerous and should be
avoided. Oral sex carries
the potential of viral trans
mission.
Virus — minute, parasitic
organism which depends
on nutrients inside cells for
its metabolic and
reproductive needs. These
organisms cause a variety
of infectious diseases and
stimulate host antibodies.
Unlike a bacteria, unable to
survive long on its own.
Not affected by antibiotics.
