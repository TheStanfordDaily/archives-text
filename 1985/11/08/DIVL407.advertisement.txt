The CPPC is getting busier and busier with new internships. Because so many new ones have
been coming in with upcoming deadlines, some of them don't have a chance to be advertised in
the Daily column. So come in and look through the internship binders before the deadlines are
passed.
Special Note: If you're interested in a Public Service internship but have had a hard time finding
one at the CPPC, it's because they've moved! They are now located in the Public Service Center
in Owen House — right next to the Bike Shop. Stop in to see what they have to offer
