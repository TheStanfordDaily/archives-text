# C-IR Eyes Divestment Proposal
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
The Commission on Investment
Responsibility (C-IR) took a
"positive step" yesterday in draft
ing a proposal for selective divest
ment of University holdings in
South Africa-related companies, ac
cording to the co-author of an
amendment presented for discus
sion at the meeting.
Senior Jonathan Turk said his
proposed amendment, co-authored
with senior Joel Bellenson, calls on
the University to divest of its hold
ings in companies that do not take
"positive steps to eliminate or
reduce this social injury."
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody, co-author of the draft pro
posal Turk and Bellenson wish to
amend, said the proposed amend
ment has "some influence" but
declined additional comment.
The draft proposal will be pre
sented by C-IR to the Board of
Trustees on Tuesday.
Brody said "philosophical" differ
ences underscored his disagree
ment with the amendment pro
posed by Turk and Bellenson. "We
have different tactics for achieving
the same ends," he said.
In reference to the proposal it
self, Brody said, "The pieces of the
draft completed today were sup
ported unanimously. ... A con
sensus will carry more weight with
the trustees and with the Stanford
community."
The existing C-IR draft proposal
contains recommendations guided
by the Sullivan Principles, a code of
conduct for companies employing
workers in South Africa. The
amendment proposed by Turk and
Bellenson would eliminate the Sul
livan Principles as a criterion for Stan
ford's selective divestment policy.
According to Bellenson, the com
mission has formulated three points
concerning social injury:
• Group initiatives such as the Sul
livan Principles would be "beefed
up" so that companies would "need
a high rating" in order to conform.
• Company membership in the
American Chamber of Commerce,
an organization that encourages
government reform, would be
taken into consideration.
• Company membership in the U. S.
Corporate Council, a collection of
reform-minded chief executive offi
cers, would also be considered.
Bellenson said he was not
surprised that these initiatives
were brought up, but charged they
are "all words and no action."
Turk said he and Bellenson want
to change the present C-IR draft
proposal to "make Stanford more
accountable for what (it is) doing."

Bellenson said he is "happy" with
portions of the draft proposal in
which the University would hold
"consultations with representatives
of all race groups and political par
ties, which necessarily includes
leaders of organizations now
proscribed and/or operating in
exile. . . . land would recognize]
support groups currently excluded
from the political process which
actively work against apartheid."
"Today was definitely a big
step," Bellenson said. "We accom
plished more in today's meeting
than all the others combined in
terms of the words put out."
Turk concurred, saying, "We ac
complished what we set out to
do. . . . We got the committee
thinking and acting. . .but there is
still a long way to go.
"The process will be a rather
deliberate one," he said.
