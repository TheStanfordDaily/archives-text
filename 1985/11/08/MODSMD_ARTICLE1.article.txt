# C-IR Eyes Divestment Proposal
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
The Commission on Investment
Responsibility (C-IR) took a
"positive step" yesterday in draft
ing a proposal for selective divest
ment of University holdings in
South Africa-related companies, ac
cording to the co-author of an
amendment presented for discus
sion at the meeting.
Senior Jonathan Turk said his
proposed amendment, co-authored
with senior Joel Bellenson, calls on
the University to divest of its hold
ings in companies that do not take
"positive steps to eliminate or
reduce this social injury."
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody, co-author of the draft pro
posal Turk and Bellenson wish to
amend, said the proposed amend
ment has "some influence" but
declined additional comment.
The draft proposal will be pre
sented by C-IR to the Board of
Trustees on Tuesday.
Brody said "philosophical" differ
ences underscored his disagree
ment with the amendment pro
posed by Turk and Bellenson. "We
have different tactics for achieving
the same ends," he said.
In reference to the proposal it
self, Brody said, "The pieces of the
draft completed today were sup
ported unanimously. ... A con
sensus will carry more weight with
the trustees and with the Stanford
community."
