## Hands Off the Philippines 
### 
In the Nov. 5 Daily, Kenneth Fenyo aired his views
in his column entitled "We Must Act in the Philippines."
In his piece, he outlined three alternative courses of
action for the United States in the Philippines. The op
tion which Fenyo advocated was direct and escalating
U.S. political intervention.
In particular, he suggests that President Reagan in
sist that Marcos resign. Failing this, as is likely, Fenyo
states that the United States should sponsor a military
coup, then back a junta of sorts, to be rid of Marcos.
He claims that "such a course of action is not ex
cessive."

VIEWPOINT

I have to express my utter amazement that Fenyo
and The Daily could even consider publishing such a
naive opinion.
As a Filipino, I can hardly be considered a Marcos
supporter. But I also cannot even begin to think of the
repercussions, violence and bloodshed that such a
move would cause in the Philippines.
I would have to live in the midst of such a situation.
Fenyo would not.
U.S.-backed violence has hardly ever brought las
ting reforms. Recall the example of Salvador Allende's
Chile, where one dictator was replaced by an even
more oppressive one. The volatility of several South
American political systems is alien to the Philippines,
but one coup would start the ball rolling.
Such a coup would benefit the United States in the
short run by keeping the military bases safe. But the
overt intervention by an outside nation whose
popularity is already on the decline within Filipino intel
lectual and opposition circles would serve to catalyze
general public indignation. The United States may well
end up being viewed as the "common enemy" rather

than the "common savior," and a united front of radical
and moderate opposition would be formed to oust the
foreign enemy or its puppet government. History has
shown that such united fronts are very effective in a
chieving their "overthrow" goal. But history also shows
that, once the initial goal is met, the radical group
emerges victorious in the ensuing internal power
struggle.
Undoubtedly, the United States has a high stake in
terest in the Philippines. The Filipino populace and the
business community still have favorable feelings
toward Americans, and these feelings should not be
strained to breaking point. If the United States must in
tervene at all, it can do so in the economic arena and
thus indirectly affect the political one.
I do not mean the current vice-like grip the Interna
tional Monetary Fund-World Bank is keeping on the
country. I mean equitable distribution to livelihood
projects through channels that will ensure that funds
are properly used. After all, the only time the
Philippine communist insurgency was effectively
suppressed was in the 19605, when economic relief
was poured into the depressed rural areas that the
rebels had found to be fertile ground for agitation.
More immediately, the United States can serve as a
watchdog at the upcoming elections and, if it chooses,
back a moderate opposition party financially. But no
more than that.
Mr. Fenyo, the Philippines is a sovereign nation
and, as such, has the right to conduct its affairs without
the kind of intervention you suggest. The United
States relinquished its 48-year colonial hold, if not its
interest, in 1946. America has a right to protect its in
terest â€” within limits. But above and beyond all else,
the Philippines has the right to be its own country.
