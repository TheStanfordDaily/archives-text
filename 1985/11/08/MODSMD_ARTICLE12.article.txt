Nuclear Force
Is Unacceptable
French Prof. Robert Greer
Cohn's viewpoint on arms control
(The Daily, Nov. 5) shows a poor
understanding both of the arms
race and of the existentialist posi
tion he claims to represent.
Prof. Cohn's optimism is com
forting, and he may be right that
"we can live with (nuclear) compe
tition indefinitely." On the other
hand, he may be like the proverbial
man who jumped from the top of
the Empire State Building only to
announce halfway down,
"everything's fine so far." My point
is that — in a world where we are
building six new nuclear weapons
each day, where military
strategists are talking again about
"winnable" nuclear wars, and
where we are moving rapidly
toward a computerized launch-on
warning posture (nuclear war by
computer error?) — it may take
more than Cohn's robust optimism
to avert a catastrophe. If Prof.
Cohn spent less time thinking
about James Joyce and Thornton
Wilder and more looking into the
laws of probability — the planet is,
after all, playing Russian roulette
on a vast scale — he might be less
sanguine.
This option does not suit Prof.
Cohn since he is a fatalist, albeit of
the most sentimental kind. Al
though he affects an existentialist
vocabulary, Prof. Cohn does not
believe in human will in the ul
timate sense. "Fate," he tells us,
"paired us off in rivalry with the
Soviet Union," and it is our job to
make the most of the situation as
stoically as we can. I tell you it
does not have to be that way un-

less we choose to acquiesce to the
leaders and special interests who
have chosen it on our behalf. If we
wish, we may continue spending
65 cents of every tax dollar on the
military and add to our stockpile of
30,000 nuclear weapons in the
miserable pursuit of an illusory
advantage over the Soviet Union.
Or we can make a truly existential
choice to transcend our history by
negotiating an end to the arms
race. We can choose and work for
survival rather than fatalistically,
passively assuming it.

Board Meetings
Should Be Open
The Stanford Board of Trustees
meets this week. Since this board
decides on matters of certain inter
est to the Stanford community, it
seems logical that members of the
community and the press should be
admitted to address the board and
to observe. But no such sense
exists.
It is absurd that the trustees of
an educational institution like Stan
ford can hide behind its private
status and not feel compelled to
open their meetings to the public.
If people within the community and
the press can only construct an
opinion based on second-hand
information, how can they make an
independent assessment of the
discussions and decisions of the
trustees? This closed attitude of
the board is another indication that
those who control the University
formally treat it as a corporation,
considering the community —
including faculty, staff and students
— as a mass to be managed from

the top. Input to the board
meetings is only introduced at the
trustees' request, not as a result of
community initiative. A first step
to deal with this problem is to
allow reporters from The Daily and
KZSU to attend the meetings.
Equally important is the right of
concerned groups and individuals
within the Stanford community to
attend meetings and express their
interests.
A last note: if the trustees feel
competent to deal with re
sponsibilities as the highest admin
istrative officers of the University,
what do they fear from acting in
the public eye?

ASSUMust
Fulfill Promises
It's always good to see
politicians — especially ASSU
politicians — live up to their cam
paign promises. Last spring, the
current Council of Presidents
promised to abolish the ASSU
Senate, and with that got elected.
We're glad to read reports that
they are making good their pledge
(Daily, Oct. 28), even through
their plans sound wildly unrealistic.
But let's not forget their other
campaign promises — to turn
down their combined $20,520
salary, or at least to donate it to
student groups. They are now
putting that salary into their own
pockets. We are looking forward to
seeing how they use it as "the
humble servant of the students."
