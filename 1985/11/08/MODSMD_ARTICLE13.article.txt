# Students Don't Deserve the Coffee House
## 
### 
I used to go to the Coffee House. It was not
then an issue whether I went inside or stayed
away. I still go to the Coffee House — at every
opportunity I get. Now I am able to get some
thing to eat and drink without having to wait in
line for 20 minutes.
People who are protesting Saga Corp.'s win
ning the Coffee House contract should stop their
belly-aching and shut up. The ASSU is still
obligated to pay $30,000 for their mistakes. It is

a collective $30,000 out of student funds. I was
never asked if I wanted to have part of my quar
terly ASSU fee assessment used to pay off that
debt. Is there some way that I can get back my
share of that money, as there is to get back
other monies that are donated to various organi
zations through the ASSU student fee assess
ment? When did I agree to assume the liabilities
of the Coffee House?
Students are notorious for not catering to the
needs of other students. The advantages that
they bring to a working position are imagination
and energy, but, in general, they are not de
pendable. They come and go, and they have
other agendas. They have mutiple commit
ments, and know that, when they leave Stan
ford, they will be going on to bigger and better
things. The title "Coffee House manager" or

"Coffee House president" will simply be another
line in their resume for business school. What
"commitment to students" are the protesters
talking about when they talk about a student-run
Coffee House versus one run by an outside ven
dor?
An example of a student-run system is The
Daily. My experience with the staff so far has
been that of broken promises, unreturned phone
calls and a lack of responsibility. My first column
was published on a different day than I was told
that it would and with a picture of another colum
nist. This kind of arbitrary sloppiness seems to
be more the rule than the exception in student
run organizations. It is, in a way, understand
able. Most of us, as students, experience the
pressure of academic assignments, midterms,
etc. — and often these must take priority over
other obligations. The Daily provides an impor
tant training ground for budding journalists and
other potential newspaper employees.
Therefore the disadvantages inherent in a
student-run system are probably offset by the
availibility of this experience.
Managing the Coffee House, however, will
provide experience to one person to the poten
tial detriment of many. When I go to the Coffee
House I am looking for good service, which I
may not get from a student manager who ranks
running the Coffee House as a second priority to
an upcoming political science midterm.
The ASSU is paying off $30,000 of the
$43,000 in debts incurred by the Coffee House,
of which $42,000 was incurred during a strike by
the United Stanford Workers Union in 1982.
During the period of the strike, the Coffee
House was deluged by students because they
were one of the few convenient places open for
business. In spite of the fact that it did not join
the strike, the Coffee House managed to lose

$42,000 during this period. I am told that this
happened because they were selling sandwiches
for less than it cost to make them! Now, who
was responsible for this? If it were a private
company, that person would have been sacked
and would be walking the streets looking for an
other job, chagrined at what he or she had done.
But the manager was a Stanford student who,
rather than losing a job, is probably working for
some high tech firm for much more than he or
she could ever possibly make managing a cafe.
How could something as basic as the appropriate
price of a sandwich be overlooked to the tune of
$42,000? Not only did the Coffee House, Inc.,
not support the United Stanford Workers' efforts
to obtain a reasonable contract with the adminis
tration, but they demonstrated their lack of re
sponsibility and judgment.
Unless there is someone who makes the Cof
fee House a top priority, Stanford students can
only expect inconsistent quality of the service
and the food. A student manager may be less,
not more, responsive to students. A person who
is worried about his or her own neck is going to
be more responsive to students than a student
aspriring to a $40,000-a-year job after earning an
MBA. What the ASSU should have done long
ago, if it was serious about continuing to control
the Coffee House, would have been to have the
student board of directors hire a full-time
manager. That way the ASSU would have still
had ultimate control without having to worry
about the day-to-day responsibilities.
Stay away from the Coffee House if you like,
but be clear about your reasons for doing so.
Frankly, I am one student at Stanford who is
happy the Coffee House is out of student hands.
