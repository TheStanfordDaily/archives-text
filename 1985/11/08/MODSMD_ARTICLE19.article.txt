## 'Top Girls' Tops Theatric Bill 
### MARK TOMPKINS Staff writer 
The Stanford Department of
Drama is billing its 1985-86 season
as "an adventure in provocative
theater," and their current produc
tion "Top Girls" is exactly that, ad
venturous and provocative. Written
by British playwright Caryl Chur
chill, "Top Girls" makes an unusual
statement about the role of women
in today's society, and more di
rectly, about how women interact
among themselves in that society.
The play centers around Marlene
(played by Macall Dunahee), an in
dependent and aggressive woman
who has just been promoted to the
head of an employment agency. In
the first scene, Marlene hosts a din
ner party to celebrate her rise to
the top. But this is no ordinary din
ner party, for Marlene's choice of
guests is eclectic, to say the least.
Her guests are Lady Nijo
(Charlotte Alexander), a thirteenth
century Japanese courtesan;
Isabella Bird (Erica Vener), a Vic
torian explorer; Dull Gret (Terra
Vandergaw), a peasant character
from a sixteenth century Brueghel
painting; Pope Joan (Decca De
Meza), the woman who supposedly
reigned as pontiff disguised as a
man in the ninth century; and Pa
tient Griselda (Shannon Jackson), a
character who appears in both
Petrarch and"The Clerk's Tale" in
Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.
This dinner scene is a marvel. All
five guests are wonderfully theatri
cal in their speech, costumes and
behavior. There's so much inter
esting interaction going on between
the characters that it's difficult to
catch all of the scene's delightful
little touches. For example, as the
normally staid Pope Joan gets
drunk, she begins to play with her
silverware and makes a cross out of
two forks. Another amusing mo

ment comes when Dull Gret, lack
ing any sort of politesse what
soever, bawls out "Potatoes!" to
the waitress, and the dainty Lady
Nijo winces in exaggerated dis
taste. These little details give the
dinner party scene an unusual rich
ness.
From this bravura opening, the
play moves to the employment
agency where Marlene works. The
scenes in the office are presented
as a series of sharp, biting vig
nettes. The all-female staff speaks
in a brittle jargon: they live in a
world of "high-flyers" and "head
hunters." In this furiously competi
tive environment, Marlene is the
undisputed leader by virtue of being
the most ruthless person there.
The play's final setting is the
dingy home of Joyce and Angie,
Marlene's sister and niece,
respectively. Joyce (Erica Vener)
and Angie (Terra Vandergaw) live
in a world of no money and no
prospects. Angie desperately
wants out, as she tells her girlfriend
Kit (Ashley Quinn), and for this rea
son Angie idolizes his Aunt Marlene
who has made it in the outside
world.
It may sound as if the play is
made up of three separate parts
which never really connect. But
these parts link together subtly,
and this subtlety is what prevents
the play from ever being didactic or
heavy-handed.
The relevance of the fantastic
dinner party to the rest of the play
lies in the innovative device of
having each actress play several
roles. Decca De Meza plays Pope
Joan, a character who tells us that
she was able to rule in a man's
world by disguising herself as a
man. Later, the same actress plays
Louise, an office manager who fits
in at her job by "acting like a man."
By seeing the same actress in both
parts, the audience cannot help but

to draw parallels between the two
characters and wonder if things
have really improved for women
since the ninth century.
The cast works like a true en
semble, with actresses over
shadowing one another. But while
all the actresses handle their multi
ple roles with great dexterity, spe
cial mention goes to Vander
gaw for her affecting portrayal of
Angie. Angie is ignorant and fre
quently uncouth, but Vandergaw
lets us see that Angie is sensitive
and knowing underneath her
boorish exterior.
Similarly, credit goes to
Alexander for her careful
handling of Lady Nijo. It's an ex

tremely mannered, theatrical role
(Lady Nijo's hilarious entrance in
the first scene is flamboyant to the
point of being high camp), but Alex
ander never descends into mere
caricature.
About the only thing that doesn't
work in the play is the overlapping
dialogue in the first scene. Overlap
ping dialogue is used throughout to
give the impression of realism, as in
the films of Robert Altman, but in
the first scene we badly want to
hear everything that is said, and we
can't, because some characters
drown out others.
This is a minor flaw considering
the wealth of interesting material
this production can, and does, of
fer.

the characters that it's difficult to
catch all of the scene's delightful
little touches. For example, as the
normally staid Pope Joan gets
drunk, she begins to play with her
silverware and makes a cross out of
two forks. Another amusing mo

ment comes when Dull Gret, lack
ing any sort of politesse what
soever, bawls out "Potatoes!" to
the waitress, and the dainty Lady
Nijo winces in exaggerated dis
taste. These little details give the
dinner party scene an unusual rich
ness.
From this bravura opening, the
play moves to the employment
agency where Marlene works. The
scenes in the office are presented
as a series of sharp, biting vig
nettes. The all-female staff speaks
in a brittle jargon: they live in a
world of "high-flyers" and "head
hunters." In this furiously competi
tive environment, Marlene is the
undisputed leader by virtue of being
the most ruthless person there.
The play's final setting is the
dingy home of Joyce and Angie,
Marlene's sister and niece,
respectively. Joyce (Erica Vener)
and Angie (Terra Vandergaw) live
in a world of no money and no
prospects. Angie desperately
wants out, as she tells her girlfriend
Kit (Ashley Quinn), and for this rea
son Angie idolizes his Aunt Marlene
who has made it in the outside
world.
It may sound as if the play is
made up of three separate parts
which never really connect. But
these parts link together subtly,
and this subtlety is what prevents
the play from ever being didactic or
heavy-handed.
The relevance of the fantastic
dinner party to the rest of the play
lies in the innovative device of
having each actress play several
roles. Decca De Meza plays Pope
Joan, a character who tells us that
she was able to rule in a man's
world by disguising herself as a
man. Later, the same actress plays
Louise, an office manager who fits
in at her job by "acting like a man."
By seeing the same actress in both
parts, the audience cannot help but

to draw parallels between the two
characters and wonder if things
have really improved for women
since the ninth century.
The cast works like a true en
semble, with actresses over
shadowing one another. But while
all the actresses handle their multi
ple roles with great dexterity, spe
cial mention goes to Vander
gaw for her affecting portrayal of
Angie. Angie is ignorant and fre
quently uncouth, but Vandergaw
lets us see that Angie is sensitive
and knowing underneath her
boorish exterior.
Similarly, credit goes to
Alexander for her careful
handling of Lady Nijo. It's an ex

tremely mannered, theatrical role
(Lady Nijo's hilarious entrance in
the first scene is flamboyant to the
point of being high camp), but Alex
ander never descends into mere
caricature.
About the only thing that doesn't
work in the play is the overlapping
dialogue in the first scene. Overlap
ping dialogue is used throughout to
give the impression of realism, as in
the films of Robert Altman, but in
the first scene we badly want to
hear everything that is said, and we
can't, because some characters
drown out others.
This is a minor flaw considering
the wealth of interesting material
this production can, and does, of
fer.


Marlerie (Macall Dunahee, seated) and Joyce (Erica Vener) ex
plore the problems facing women of today and yesterday in the
Stanford Drama Department's production of "Top Girls."
The Stanford Department of
Drama is billing its 1985-86 season
as "an adventure in provocative
theater," and their current produc
tion "Top Girls" is exactly that, ad
venturous and provocative. Written
by British playwright Caryl Chur
chill, "Top Girls" makes an unusual
statement about the role of women
in today's society, and more di
rectly, about how women interact
among themselves in that society.
The play centers around Marlene
(played by Macall Dunahee), an in
dependent and aggressive woman
who has just been promoted to the
head of an employment agency. In
the first scene, Marlene hosts a din
ner party to celebrate her rise to
the top. But this is no ordinary din
ner party, for Marlene's choice of
guests is eclectic, to say the least.
Her guests are Lady Nijo
(Charlotte Alexander), a thirteenth
century Japanese courtesan;
Isabella Bird (Erica Vener), a Vic
torian explorer; Dull Gret (Terra
Vandergaw), a peasant character
from a sixteenth century Brueghel
painting; Pope Joan (Decca De
Meza), the woman who supposedly
reigned as pontiff disguised as a
man in the ninth century; and Pa
tient Griselda (Shannon Jackson), a
character who appears in both
Petrarch and"The Clerk's Tale" in
Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.
This dinner scene is a marvel. All
five guests are wonderfully theatri
cal in their speech, costumes and
behavior. There's so much inter
esting interaction going on between
the characters that it's difficult to
catch all of the scene's delightful
little touches. For example, as the
normally staid Pope Joan gets
drunk, she begins to play with her
silverware and makes a cross out of
two forks. Another amusing mo
