# Grad Election Results In
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Kenneth Witzke and Stewart Boyd are the unofficial
winners of two graduate voting positions in the ASSU
Senate that were left vacant when not enough candi
dates sought positions in the spring general election.
Seven alternate seats were also filled, and two
remained vacant in the special election held Tuesday
and Wednesday that attracted more than 300 graduate
students to six polling sites across campus, according
to ASSU Elections Commissioner Derek Kampfe.
The senate will vote to validate and certify the elec
tion results at its Nov. 19 meeting, Kampfe said. The
validation vote assures that the "election was held in a
proper manner," he said, while the certification vote
recognizes the senators elected.
Witzke, with 106 votes, outdistanced Michael

Strange by six votes to claim a voting seat in the sen
ate's engineering school district, while Boyd garnered
47 votes to top Fred Cate by 20 votes to capture a seat
in the business, law and medicine district.
Witzke, a doctoral candidate in electrical engineer
ing, stated in his platform that he hoped "to make engi
neering students more aware of the fact that the engi
neering senators are elected to represent them.
Therefore, more interaction with individual students is
needed."
Boyd, a master's of business administration stu
dent, said in his platform that the "ASSU has tremen
dous resources. I'd like to apply my finan
cial/managerial training to making this resource work
for the students. I'm not yet sure what's to be done,
but there appear to be almost unlimited possibilities."
