# Lange Stands Out In 'Sweet Dreams'
## 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
There may never be a better time than now to examine the depic
tion of modern women in movies. Currently, "Sweet Dreams" and
"Marie" portray the lives of two women who had enormous impact in
their limited fields. "Plenty" and "Wetherby," both adaptations of
plays by, David Hare, have female protagonists. Add to that list
"Agnes of God," "Dance with a Stranger" and "Jagged Edge," and
you've covered most of the major new films and talented actresses in
film today.
Jane Fonda, Meryl Streep, Anne Bancroft, Vanessa Redgrave,
Meg Tilly, Sissy Spacek, Jessica Lange, Glen Close — that's a very
impressive list. This may be a unique moment in film history when,
in a season typically devoted to "prestige" films, Hollywood is shoot
ing for Oscars not with big-name directors or actors, but almost ex
clusively with famous actresses.
Unfortunately, these films do not deliver what one would expect.
"Marie," "Plenty" and "Agnes of God" all cash in on what's popular
(and honorable) in women's roles today: women against the system,
be it corrupt politicos, the Catholic church or post-World War II
European society. This material is somewhat retrograde; men in the
movies have been fighting the "system" for decades.
The real problem with these pictures is that the roles themselves
have so litle urgency. John Briley's screenplay for "Marie" breaks its
back piling underdog status on Marie Ragghianti (Sissy Spacek), yet
the movie, despite a talented filmmaking team, is curiously uninvolv
ing. The film shamelessly sets up Marie's martyrdom, much in
the same way that "Plenty" tries to get us to sympathize with Meryl
Streep's Susan and "Agnes" works over its actors.
None of these movies asks the big questions about their charac
ters. For example: What turned Marie into a crusader for justice?
Why doesn't Susan stop beating her head against the wall and do
something to change her life? Why do the characters in "Agnes" do
what they do?
The moviemakers may be so awestruck with their subjects that
they forget to ask these questions. It may also be that we are
supposed to accept the dim motivations because, after all, these
women are mysterious, unexplainable creatures. Streep's Susan
decides, out of the blue and with little fuss, to have a baby, and we're
supposed to accept this as an insight into her character. Instead,
we're questioning what motivated her character to make that deci
sion. These actresses have to work too hard to pull off convincing
characterizations.
Jessica Lange in "Sweet Dreams" works hard too, but in her
movie it pays off spectacularly.
Lange, as country & western
singer Patsy Cline, is so vibrantly
alive that she practically leaps off
the screen. Cline's life has few of
the traps built into the storylines of
"Marie," "Plenty" and "Agnes," yet
we care about her far more than we
do about the heroines of those
pictures.
Patsy has a wholehearted drive
and ambition that takes us by
surprise in the very first scenes,
where we see her singing at a
roadside bar and grill. Here she
meets Charlie Dick (Ed Harris),
and right off the movie has a great
moment. Charlie approaches the
stage while Patsy is singing, and
slowly, lyrically, begins strumming
an air guitar accompaniment. He's
serenading her with her own music,
and it's clear that director Karel
Reisz and screenwriter Robert
Getchell see a connection between

these two that Lange and Harris
smoothly develop.
"Sweet Dreams" has a simple,
linear narrative that spans Patsy
and Charlie's life together from
1956, when they first meet, to
1963. The movie doesn't leave out
any scenes that we might want to
see, or events that might have
some influence on the characters,
and that's refreshing. Although we
immediately can see why Charlie
and Patsy like each other, the
storyline still opens up aspects of
their relationship that surprise us
while still making sense in terms of
their characters.
Patsy's character is upfront and
dynamic. In the film's early scenes
her best friend and confidant is her
mother, beautifully played by Ann
Wedgeworth, and along with the
mother/daughter tension goes a
communicative warmth and feeling
that links these two as assuredly as
Patsy and Charlie.
But she's not simple-minded.
She has a talent, and she knows
that it can propel her to fame. She's

shrewd, but not sneaky. She does
not see herself as politically
liberated, and she's not consciously
feminist, yet she embodies the
spirit of the modern liberated
women more than any other
women in movies out now. It's a
great role, and her story doesn't
have to manufacture obstacles in
her life to build her character and
hold our interest (as "Marie" tries
to).
In the early scenes, when she
confronts Charlie's crude, brazen

Ed Harris is the perfect counterpart for
Lange. In many ways, Harris has the
film's most challenging role.

come-ons with a scabrous wit and
humor, she shows that she can be
just as crude and brazen as he is.
And when she gets her first televi
sion appearance, she doesn't play
the shy, demure aspiring starlet;
she flashes her knockout smile and

launches into her performance
without a trace of self
consciousness.
Ed Harris is the perfect counter
part for Lange. In many ways, Har
ris has the film's most challenging
role because Charlie has a volatile
temper and often terrible judge
ment. Yet we see from Patsy's
eyes, and witness what gets her to
love him. Harris' slightly crazed
grin, which kept us guessing about
the true nature of his John Glen in
"The Right Stuff," is used here to

great effect. Patsy can channel her
energies into her songs and her
public; Charlie has only Patsy, and
the energy he devotes to her is un
stable.
Charlie could be a very simple
character: a crude lout who feels

left behind by the success of his fa
mous wife. But this movie connects
these two in ways so fundamental
that even when they're apart or
fighting, it's clear that they belong
together. In the early scenes we
see how Patsy and Charlie's
energies are matched and feed off
one another. After they first make
love in the back of Charlie's car,
Patsy says, "Charlie, don't leave
me — I was starving and didn't
know it." And in the fights thay
have later, there are no good guys
or bad guys; they're both respon
sible, because their tempers are
matched, and explode together.
These performers work so well
together that it's easy to pass over
the small disappointing details.
Patsy's original singing has been
Dolbyized and electronically en
hanced, which is a mistake in the
scenes where Lange has to lip-sync
practice sessions or sing over tele
vision. The sound quality is simply
too good to be believable. There's
nothing obviously bad about
Lange's lip-syncing, but Patsy's

voice was originally so good that
making it better transforms it into
something almost inhuman. And the
parallels between the songs she
sings and what's going on in her
own life seem a little pat. When she
sings "Sweet Dreams" near the
end, and the camera swirls around
her and gives her an angelic
radiance, we know it's all over.
But many of the trickier details
work out just fine. Patsy's wish to
have "a white house with yellow
roses all around it" could come
across as hopelessly sappy, as
could the scene where she and
Charlie dance in the rain in front of
the roadhouse where they first
met. But Reisz has a respect for
these characters as real people that
transforms the material. The argu
ments and bitterness between
Patsy and Charlie aren't used to
trash their squarely middle class
ideals; Reisz doesn't try to sell us
their dreams, nor does he try to
expose them as false. In that sense,
"Sweet Dreams" is as honest and
upfront as the characters it's about.

But many of the trickier details
work out just fine. Patsy's wish to
have "a white house with yellow
roses all around it" could come
across as hopelessly sappy, as
could the scene where she and
Charlie dance in the rain in front of
the roadhouse where they first
met. But Reisz has a respect for
these characters as real people that
transforms the material. The argu
ments and bitterness between
Patsy and Charlie aren't used to
trash their squarely middle class
ideals; Reisz doesn't try to sell us
their dreams, nor does he try to
expose them as false. In that sense,
"Sweet Dreams" is as honest and
upfront as the characters it's about.
There may never be a better time than now to examine the depic
tion of modern women in movies. Currently, "Sweet Dreams" and
"Marie" portray the lives of two women who had enormous impact in
their limited fields. "Plenty" and "Wetherby," both adaptations of
plays by, David Hare, have female protagonists. Add to that list
"Agnes of God," "Dance with a Stranger" and "Jagged Edge," and
you've covered most of the major new films and talented actresses in
film today.
Jane Fonda, Meryl Streep, Anne Bancroft, Vanessa Redgrave,
Meg Tilly, Sissy Spacek, Jessica Lange, Glen Close — that's a very
impressive list. This may be a unique moment in film history when,
in a season typically devoted to "prestige" films, Hollywood is shoot
ing for Oscars not with big-name directors or actors, but almost ex
clusively with famous actresses.
Unfortunately, these films do not deliver what one would expect.
"Marie," "Plenty" and "Agnes of God" all cash in on what's popular
(and honorable) in women's roles today: women against the system,
be it corrupt politicos, the Catholic church or post-World War II
European society. This material is somewhat retrograde; men in the
movies have been fighting the "system" for decades.
The real problem with these pictures is that the roles themselves
have so litle urgency. John Briley's screenplay for "Marie" breaks its
back piling underdog status on Marie Ragghianti (Sissy Spacek), yet
the movie, despite a talented filmmaking team, is curiously uninvolv
ing. The film shamelessly sets up Marie's martyrdom, much in
the same way that "Plenty" tries to get us to sympathize with Meryl
Streep's Susan and "Agnes" works over its actors.
None of these movies asks the big questions about their charac
ters. For example: What turned Marie into a crusader for justice?
Why doesn't Susan stop beating her head against the wall and do
something to change her life? Why do the characters in "Agnes" do
what they do?
The moviemakers may be so awestruck with their subjects that
they forget to ask these questions. It may also be that we are
supposed to accept the dim motivations because, after all, these
women are mysterious, unexplainable creatures. Streep's Susan
decides, out of the blue and with little fuss, to have a baby, and we're
supposed to accept this as an insight into her character. Instead,
we're questioning what motivated her character to make that deci
sion. These actresses have to work too hard to pull off convincing
characterizations.
Jessica Lange in "Sweet Dreams" works hard too, but in her
movie it pays off spectacularly.
Lange, as country & western
singer Patsy Cline, is so vibrantly
alive that she practically leaps off
the screen. Cline's life has few of
the traps built into the storylines of
"Marie," "Plenty" and "Agnes," yet
we care about her far more than we
do about the heroines of those
pictures.
Patsy has a wholehearted drive
and ambition that takes us by
surprise in the very first scenes,
where we see her singing at a
roadside bar and grill. Here she
meets Charlie Dick (Ed Harris),
and right off the movie has a great
moment. Charlie approaches the
stage while Patsy is singing, and
slowly, lyrically, begins strumming
an air guitar accompaniment. He's
serenading her with her own music,
and it's clear that director Karel
Reisz and screenwriter Robert
Getchell see a connection between

these two that Lange and Harris
smoothly develop.
"Sweet Dreams" has a simple,
linear narrative that spans Patsy
and Charlie's life together from
1956, when they first meet, to
1963. The movie doesn't leave out
any scenes that we might want to
see, or events that might have
some influence on the characters,
and that's refreshing. Although we
immediately can see why Charlie
and Patsy like each other, the
storyline still opens up aspects of
their relationship that surprise us
while still making sense in terms of
their characters.
Patsy's character is upfront and
dynamic. In the film's early scenes
her best friend and confidant is her
mother, beautifully played by Ann
Wedgeworth, and along with the
mother/daughter tension goes a
communicative warmth and feeling
that links these two as assuredly as
Patsy and Charlie.
But she's not simple-minded.
She has a talent, and she knows
that it can propel her to fame. She's

shrewd, but not sneaky. She does
not see herself as politically
liberated, and she's not consciously
feminist, yet she embodies the
spirit of the modern liberated
women more than any other
women in movies out now. It's a
great role, and her story doesn't
have to manufacture obstacles in
her life to build her character and
hold our interest (as "Marie" tries
to).
In the early scenes, when she
confronts Charlie's crude, brazen

film's most challenging role.

come-ons with a scabrous wit and
humor, she shows that she can be
just as crude and brazen as he is.
And when she gets her first televi
sion appearance, she doesn't play
the shy, demure aspiring starlet;
she flashes her knockout smile and

launches into her performance
without a trace of self
consciousness.
Ed Harris is the perfect counter
part for Lange. In many ways, Har
ris has the film's most challenging
role because Charlie has a volatile
temper and often terrible judge
ment. Yet we see from Patsy's
eyes, and witness what gets her to
love him. Harris' slightly crazed
grin, which kept us guessing about
the true nature of his John Glen in
"The Right Stuff," is used here to

great effect. Patsy can channel her
energies into her songs and her
public; Charlie has only Patsy, and
the energy he devotes to her is un
stable.
Charlie could be a very simple
character: a crude lout who feels

left behind by the success of his fa
mous wife. But this movie connects
these two in ways so fundamental
that even when they're apart or
fighting, it's clear that they belong
together. In the early scenes we
see how Patsy and Charlie's
energies are matched and feed off
one another. After they first make
love in the back of Charlie's car,
Patsy says, "Charlie, don't leave
me — I was starving and didn't
know it." And in the fights thay
have later, there are no good guys
or bad guys; they're both respon
sible, because their tempers are
matched, and explode together.
These performers work so well
together that it's easy to pass over
the small disappointing details.
Patsy's original singing has been
Dolbyized and electronically en
hanced, which is a mistake in the
scenes where Lange has to lip-sync
practice sessions or sing over tele
vision. The sound quality is simply
too good to be believable. There's
nothing obviously bad about
Lange's lip-syncing, but Patsy's

voice was originally so good that
making it better transforms it into
something almost inhuman. And the
parallels between the songs she
sings and what's going on in her
own life seem a little pat. When she
sings "Sweet Dreams" near the
end, and the camera swirls around
her and gives her an angelic
radiance, we know it's all over.
But many of the trickier details
work out just fine. Patsy's wish to
have "a white house with yellow
roses all around it" could come

Dolbyized and electronically en
hanced, which is a mistake in the
scenes where Lange has to lip-sync
practice sessions or sing over tele
vision. The sound quality is simply
too good to be believable. There's
nothing obviously bad about
Lange's lip-syncing, but Patsy's

voice was originally so good that
making it better transforms it into
something almost inhuman. And the
parallels between the songs she
sings and what's going on in her
own life seem a little pat. When she
sings "Sweet Dreams" near the
end, and the camera swirls around
her and gives her an angelic
radiance, we know it's all over.
But many of the trickier details
work out just fine. Patsy's wish to
have "a white house with yellow
roses all around it" could come
across as hopelessly sappy, as
could the scene where she and
Charlie dance in the rain in front of
the roadhouse where they first
met. But Reisz has a respect for
these characters as real people that
transforms the material. The argu
ments and bitterness between
Patsy and Charlie aren't used to
trash their squarely middle class
ideals; Reisz doesn't try to sell us
their dreams, nor does he try to
expose them as false. In that sense,
"Sweet Dreams" is as honest and
upfront as the characters it's about.
