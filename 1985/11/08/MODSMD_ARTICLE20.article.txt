# Lange Stands Out In 'Sweet Dreams'

There may never be a better time than now to examine the depic
tion of modern women in movies. Currently, "Sweet Dreams" and
"Marie" portray the lives of two women who had enormous impact in
their limited fields. "Plenty" and "Wetherby," both adaptations of
plays by, David Hare, have female protagonists. Add to that list
"Agnes of God," "Dance with a Stranger" and "Jagged Edge," and
you've covered most of the major new films and talented actresses in
film today.
Jane Fonda, Meryl Streep, Anne Bancroft, Vanessa Redgrave,
Meg Tilly, Sissy Spacek, Jessica Lange, Glen Close â€” that's a very
impressive list. This may be a unique moment in film history when,
in a season typically devoted to "prestige" films, Hollywood is shoot
ing for Oscars not with big-name directors or actors, but almost ex
clusively with famous actresses.
Unfortunately, these films do not deliver what one would expect.
"Marie," "Plenty" and "Agnes of God" all cash in on what's popular
(and honorable) in women's roles today: women against the system,
be it corrupt politicos, the Catholic church or post-World War II
European society. This material is somewhat retrograde; men in the
movies have been fighting the "system" for decades.
The real problem with these pictures is that the roles themselves
have so litle urgency. John Briley's screenplay for "Marie" breaks its
back piling underdog status on Marie Ragghianti (Sissy Spacek), yet
the movie, despite a talented filmmaking team, is curiously uninvolv
ing. The film shamelessly sets up Marie's martyrdom, much in
the same way that "Plenty" tries to get us to sympathize with Meryl
Streep's Susan and "Agnes" works over its actors.
None of these movies asks the big questions about their charac
ters. For example: What turned Marie into a crusader for justice?
Why doesn't Susan stop beating her head against the wall and do
something to change her life? Why do the characters in "Agnes" do
what they do?
The moviemakers may be so awestruck with their subjects that
they forget to ask these questions. It may also be that we are
supposed to accept the dim motivations because, after all, these
women are mysterious, unexplainable creatures. Streep's Susan
decides, out of the blue and with little fuss, to have a baby, and we're
supposed to accept this as an insight into her character. Instead,
we're questioning what motivated her character to make that deci
sion. These actresses have to work too hard to pull off convincing
characterizations.
Jessica Lange in "Sweet Dreams" works hard too, but in her
