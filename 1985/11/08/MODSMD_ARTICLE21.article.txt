# 'Miami Vice' Offers Cool Cops, Catchy Clothes
## 
### MARK TOMPKINS Staff writer 
By now, everyone knows what's
going down in Miami. Two cops,
one white and handsome in a dis
reputable kind of way, dressed in a
bright Italian designer jacket, T
shirt and cotton pants; the other
black and sporting a more formal
look, but stylish nonetheless in a tie
and double-breasted jacket. Driving
a sleek Ferrari, they cruise around
a Miami that does not really exist,
flouting conventional police proce
dures wherever they go. Their ac
tions are accompanied by the
sounds of moody synthesizers or
the hit rock song of the day.
NBC's "Miami Vice," the pro
gram that has resuscitated the cop
show genre, is launching a stylistic
revolution on network television. If
one tends to groan at the mention
of "Miami Vice," it's no wonder, for
the media has publicized this show
with an unprecedented zeal. In the
past month, Don Johnson (who
plays Detective Sonny Crockett in
the series) has appeared on the
covers of People magazine, TV
Guide and Rolling Stone. USA
Today has barraged its readers
with news about the show, and in
September "Miami Vice" even
captured the cover of Time maga
zine, a feat unusual for any product
of the entertainment industry, let
alone a TV cop show.
In an attempt to figure out what
makes "Miami Vice" unique, the
press has focused much of its
coverage on the show's use of a

rock soundtrack and glittery high
fashion. But these elements are
easily copied, as all the woeful
"Vice" imitators of the new televi
sion season have demonstrated.
And by now Johnson's look of
"casual elegance" is terribly
popular; soon it will be passe.
No, the real reasons for the
show's uniqueness are more com
plex. Perhaps it is worth bringing
up writer Fran Liebowitz's "Three
Great Questions," a rather ir
reverent set of aesthetic criteria
that applies equally well to high art
or low junk. Liebowitz's three
questions are: Is it original? Is it
amusing? And does it know its
place?
"Miami Vice" answers "yes" to
all three. The show may not pres
ent a completely original plot, but
certainly no television show has
ever presented its story the way
this one does. It's all looks, looks,
looks; the style is the substance.
Everything from the cars to the
women to the locations is carefully
chosen on the basis of chic visual
appeal.
The clothes are the most obvious
example of the show's slavish devo
tion to visuals. Crockett and co-star
Philip Michael Thomas are such
narcissistic dandies that it's easy to
imagine one of them shrugging off a
woman by saying, "I'm sorry dear, I
can't go out with you — you just
don't dress well enough."
"Miami Vice" is certainly
amusing, although in a subtle way.
Some of the flip dialogue is witty (as
best seen in the original two-hour
pilot that launched the series last

year, written by "Hill Street Blues"
writer Anthony Yerkovich).
But there is a good deal else to
laugh at in the show. Consider, for
example, how Crockett and Tubbs
are shamelessly made into pop
icons by the camera; the camera
clearly worships them, and would
never do anything to make them
look bad.
A good example of the humor
lurking beneath the show's surface
can be found in a scene from

"Smuggler's Blues," one of last
year's best episodes. Posing as
drug dealers (what else?), Crockett
and Tubbs confront a sleazy drug
kingpin in his equally sleazy
hideout, a run-down bar in Car
tagena, South America. Jan Ham
mer's keyboards murmur
ominously in the background; the
camera intercuts between tight,
sweaty closeups of the two heroes
and the dealer; red lights flicker in
the background to suggest a hellish

atmosphere. It's a tense scene, but
at the same time it's so overdone
with such a straining for effect that
it all seems ludicrous — a hilarious
self-parody. If one isn't hooked into
the drama of a "Vice" episode, it
can be appreciated as clever camp.
As for the show knowing its
proper place, the above example
answers the question. The as
sorted creators realize how silly
their material can get. But this may
be changing.
In an attempt to give "Vice"
some depth, and also to outrun the
hordes of "Vice" imitators such as
"The Insiders" and "Hollywood
Beat," the show's executive
producer Michael Mann has an
nounced he wants the show to
become a more serious, human in
terest drama. And indeed some of
the new episodes have struck a
more realistic note, without losing
any of the bravura energy which is
the show's trademark.
The program still has its silly mo
ments, of course. The two-hour
premiere of the new season, set in
New York, was a glorious mess.
Nearly everything about it was ex
cessive: the non-stop use of music,
the stars' constant wardrobe
changes, the innumerable
shootouts. And yet, somehow it all
worked — the sense of crazed ex
uberance which sets "Miami Vice"
apart from all other television pro
grams propelled the entire two
hours along at a dizzying rate.
Will "Miami Vice" last? One al
most wishes that it would end soon,
as this is one show which should
never be allowed to grow old and

flabby. Still, one needn't
about the show's future too much,
since this program has the coolest
guy on TV, after all. And that's not
a reference to Johnson but to Ed
ward James Olmos, the gifted actor
who plays Lt. Castillo, boss of
Crockett and Tubbs. With his
gaunt, spectral face and stark black
suit, Castillo can't help but grab
center stage; the less he does, the
more fascinating he is. When Cas
tillo takes charge, Crockett and
Tubbs look like barely animated
mannequins in comparison.
There are a few things the
creators of "Miami Vice" might do
to keep their show from passing on
like any other fad. One is to give
more attention to Philip Michael
Thomas, who plays Tubbs. In the
series opener, Tubbs was a very
aggressive character, but since
then he's become very passive,
taking a backseat to the glamour
boy in the Versace jacket. Thomas
is a fairly charismatic actor, given
the right material; he deserves
more screen time.
Another thing the show's as
sorted writers and directors should
do is to increase the already ex
treme stylization. The show's
greatest asset is the way it stands
out from ordinary television bland
ness; why don't the show's
creators try and see just how far
out they can get? After all, Crock
ett and Tubbs certainly never shy
away from taking risks, so the writ
ers would be doing their characters
a tremendous disservice if they
decided to play it safe.

lurking beneath the show's surface
can be found in a scene from

"Smuggler's Blues," one of last
year's best episodes. Posing as
drug dealers (what else?), Crockett
and Tubbs confront a sleazy drug
kingpin in his equally sleazy
hideout, a run-down bar in Car
tagena, South America. Jan Ham
mer's keyboards murmur
ominously in the background; the
camera intercuts between tight,
sweaty closeups of the two heroes
and the dealer; red lights flicker in
the background to suggest a hellish

atmosphere. It's a tense scene, but
at the same time it's so overdone
with such a straining for effect that
it all seems ludicrous — a hilarious
self-parody. If one isn't hooked into
the drama of a "Vice" episode, it
can be appreciated as clever camp.
As for the show knowing its
proper place, the above example
answers the question. The as
sorted creators realize how silly
their material can get. But this may
be changing.
In an attempt to give "Vice"
some depth, and also to outrun the
hordes of "Vice" imitators such as
"The Insiders" and "Hollywood
Beat," the show's executive
producer Michael Mann has an
nounced he wants the show to
become a more serious, human in
terest drama. And indeed some of
the new episodes have struck a
more realistic note, without losing
any of the bravura energy which is
the show's trademark.
The program still has its silly mo
ments, of course. The two-hour
premiere of the new season, set in
New York, was a glorious mess.
Nearly everything about it was ex
cessive: the non-stop use of music,
the stars' constant wardrobe
changes, the innumerable
shootouts. And yet, somehow it all
worked — the sense of crazed ex
uberance which sets "Miami Vice"
apart from all other television pro
grams propelled the entire two
hours along at a dizzying rate.
Will "Miami Vice" last? One al
most wishes that it would end soon,
as this is one show which should
never be allowed to grow old and

flabby. Still, one needn't
about the show's future too much,
since this program has the coolest
guy on TV, after all. And that's not
a reference to Johnson but to Ed
ward James Olmos, the gifted actor
who plays Lt. Castillo, boss of
Crockett and Tubbs. With his
gaunt, spectral face and stark black
suit, Castillo can't help but grab
center stage; the less he does, the
more fascinating he is. When Cas
tillo takes charge, Crockett and
Tubbs look like barely animated
mannequins in comparison.
There are a few things the
creators of "Miami Vice" might do
to keep their show from passing on
like any other fad. One is to give
more attention to Philip Michael
Thomas, who plays Tubbs. In the
series opener, Tubbs was a very
aggressive character, but since
then he's become very passive,
taking a backseat to the glamour
boy in the Versace jacket. Thomas
is a fairly charismatic actor, given
the right material; he deserves
more screen time.
Another thing the show's as
sorted writers and directors should
do is to increase the already ex
treme stylization. The show's
greatest asset is the way it stands
out from ordinary television bland
ness; why don't the show's
creators try and see just how far
out they can get? After all, Crock
ett and Tubbs certainly never shy
away from taking risks, so the writ
ers would be doing their characters
a tremendous disservice if they
decided to play it safe.

By now, everyone knows what's
going down in Miami. Two cops,
one white and handsome in a dis
reputable kind of way, dressed in a
bright Italian designer jacket, T
shirt and cotton pants; the other
black and sporting a more formal
look, but stylish nonetheless in a tie
and double-breasted jacket. Driving
a sleek Ferrari, they cruise around
a Miami that does not really exist,
flouting conventional police proce
dures wherever they go. Their ac
tions are accompanied by the
sounds of moody synthesizers or
the hit rock song of the day.
NBC's "Miami Vice," the pro
gram that has resuscitated the cop
show genre, is launching a stylistic
revolution on network television. If
one tends to groan at the mention
of "Miami Vice," it's no wonder, for
the media has publicized this show
with an unprecedented zeal. In the
past month, Don Johnson (who
plays Detective Sonny Crockett in
the series) has appeared on the
covers of People magazine, TV
Guide and Rolling Stone. USA
Today has barraged its readers
with news about the show, and in
September "Miami Vice" even
captured the cover of Time maga
zine, a feat unusual for any product
of the entertainment industry, let
alone a TV cop show.
In an attempt to figure out what
makes "Miami Vice" unique, the
press has focused much of its
coverage on the show's use of a

rock soundtrack and glittery high
fashion. But these elements are
easily copied, as all the woeful
"Vice" imitators of the new televi
sion season have demonstrated.
And by now Johnson's look of
"casual elegance" is terribly
popular; soon it will be passe.
No, the real reasons for the
show's uniqueness are more com
plex. Perhaps it is worth bringing
up writer Fran Liebowitz's "Three
Great Questions," a rather ir
reverent set of aesthetic criteria
that applies equally well to high art
or low junk. Liebowitz's three
questions are: Is it original? Is it
amusing? And does it know its
place?
"Miami Vice" answers "yes" to
all three. The show may not pres
ent a completely original plot, but
certainly no television show has
ever presented its story the way
this one does. It's all looks, looks,
looks; the style is the substance.
Everything from the cars to the
women to the locations is carefully
chosen on the basis of chic visual
appeal.
The clothes are the most obvious
example of the show's slavish devo
tion to visuals. Crockett and co-star
Philip Michael Thomas are such
narcissistic dandies that it's easy to
imagine one of them shrugging off a
woman by saying, "I'm sorry dear, I
can't go out with you — you just
don't dress well enough."
"Miami Vice" is certainly
amusing, although in a subtle way.
Some of the flip dialogue is witty (as
best seen in the original two-hour
pilot that launched the series last

year, written by "Hill Street Blues"
writer Anthony Yerkovich).
But there is a good deal else to
laugh at in the show. Consider, for
example, how Crockett and Tubbs
are shamelessly made into pop
icons by the camera; the camera
clearly worships them, and would
never do anything to make them
look bad.
