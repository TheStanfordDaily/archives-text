## Mendocino Welcomes Winter Weekend Visitors 
### JEFFREY MALTZMAN Staff writer 
Mendocino (second in a two
part series)
Population: 1,008
Location: Approximately 180
miles northwest of Stanford on
Highway 1.
Area Code: 707
Visitors to Mendocino can walk
for miles through trails exploring
the rugged coast. Each turn of the
trail brings new surprises. Several
small coves have underwater tun
nels. When the surf rushes in, giant
blowholes splash water into the air.
Sea otters dance in the surf while
prying open their delicious dinner of
fresh abalone. At several spots
along Mendocino's bay, rusted
anchor chains and other relics of the
town's seafaring past have washed
ashore.
On clear, fogless winter days
visitors are well-advised to spend a
few hours just driving along scenic
Route 1, the coastal highway. This
roadway twists and winds past one
stunning panorama after another.
The drive south will instantly take
you to a photographer's paradise.
Should you choose to start out
driving north, you have to get past
industrial Fort Bragg before the
real scenery begins. Fort Bragg is
located about 15 minutes north of
Mendocino. The only sight worth
stopping for in Fort Bragg is the fa
mous Skunk Train (964-6371). The
train gets its name from the odor of
its steam engines. The train
operates once a day during the win
ter on the old logging route to Wil
lits. The trip takes about seven
and-a-half hours, round trip, includ
ing a lunch stop in Willits.
The Hill House Inn, a relatively
new addition to Mendocino (the

older of its two wings was built
eight years ago), is done up in a
style suggestive of a quaint New
England Inn. The location is excel
lent: atop a small hill, the inn
presents a view of the coast on one
side, the town on the other.
Reservations should be made three
to four weeks in advance during
peak times.
Accommodations range from
pleasant, functional rooms without
a view for $65, to beautiful fireplace
suites overlooking the ocean for
$110. These suites are well worth
it if your budget permits. Our
room, with a full ocean view but no
fireplace, cost us $90, a little steep
on a student budget. But how can
you beat watching the waves roll in
while breakfasting?
The breakfast provided with the
room was no ordinary continental
breakfast of a dry roll and cold,
weak coffee. The Hill House pro
vides outstaflfling fresh cakes and
muffins from a bakery in nearby
Fort Bragg. Guests telephone the
office when they are ready for
breakfast, and delivery takes less
than 60 seconds.
The staff at the Hill House is
friendly and competent, ready to
provide information on where to go
and what to do in and around Men
docino. During a recent visit, our
only regret was that the Hill House
Restaurant, which has an excep
tional view of the coast, was closed
for renovations. It seems the inn's
owners were displeased with the
job the people originally chosen to
run the restaurant had done, so
they decided to take on the job
themselves.
The renovated Hill House Res
taurant is scheduled to open this
weekend. If the rest of the inn is
any indication of its quality, it should
be well worth a visit.

We had only middling success
going out to eat while in Mendocino.
For lunch, we tried the Chocolate
Mousse on Kasten Street. Its menu
of soups, salads and pates was
routine, but a good value for Men
docino. Lunch for two was only
about $12 with tax and tip. We must
admit, though, the tip was rather
small, as the employees seemed
much more interested in chatting
with friends passing by than attend
ing to the patrons. The desserts,
despite what the name might indi
cate, were uninspiring, so we ad
journed to the candy shop.
Mendocino's shops and galleries
are fabulous, especially if you have
lots of money. Even if you cannot
afford to spend $5,000 on a coffee
table, they are still fun to look at.
Local artists and artisans do excel
lent work in furniture, clothing, pot
tery, jewelry and the decorative
aits. You can do all the browsing
there is to do in less than a day, and
we have no particular place to rec
ommend, since part of the fun is
separating the worthwhile from the
touristy.
For dinner, we tried the Men
docino Hotel. The attitude was . . .
relaxed. Despite the fact that we
made the required reservations, we
had to wait for 25 minutes to be
seated, which did not seem to dis
turb the hostess in the least.
Things got better, however. The
waitress, though overworked, tried
not to leave us with nothing to eat
for too long.
The garlic bread provided with
the meal is a garlic-lover's dream; a
real garlic taste, not too buttery,
and with a touch of melted cheese
to boot. The salads were plentiful
and fresh, and the tomatoes were
real, juicy and red, not your typical
supermarket superballs.
The Mendocino Hotel offers a
"light" menu of dishes under $10,

but be forewarned light really
means light. The baked chevre and
almonds, however, almost made up
in quality for what it lacked in quan
tity.
The regular entree menu is a
standard mix of meat and fish
dishes. We opted for the lamb
chops in a light sauce that was tasty
but not overpowering. We asked
that they be cooked medium and
they arrived pink inside, tender and
juicy throughout, the way lamb
chops should be.
For the truly adventurous with a
few extra days, explore the coast
between Mendocino and the
Oregon border. The last 100 miles
of the coast before hitting Oregon is
commonly known as the Lost
Coast. Although settled during the
1840s during the gold rush, major
roads were never developed along
this expanse of coast. The original
settlers relied upon infrequent
sailing ships for transport.
Small roads hug the coastal cliffs
throughout this area, and long
abandoned towns sit in decay here
and there. Be prepared for wet,
rainy weather, as much of the Lost
Coast logs more than 200 inches of
rainfall annually.
The tiny towns of Honeydew and
Petrolia both have small stores and
gas stations (limited hours during
the winter). There are occasional
motels in the area, but camping is
easily available. King's Range Na
tional Conservation Area has many
primitive campgrounds. Permits
are not required for fires, and
camping is free. For an excellent
guide to the Lost Coast, pick up the
"Let's Go Budget Guide to Califor
nia and the Pacific Northwest." The
Stanford Bookstore has several
copies available.

of soups, salads and pates was
routine, but a good value for Men
docino. Lunch for two was only
about $12 with tax and tip. We must
admit, though, the tip was rather
small, as the employees seemed
much more interested in chatting
with friends passing by than attend
ing to the patrons. The desserts,
despite what the name might indi
cate, were uninspiring, so we ad
journed to the candy shop.
Mendocino's shops and galleries
are fabulous, especially if you have
lots of money. Even if you cannot
afford to spend $5,000 on a coffee
table, they are still fun to look at.
Local artists and artisans do excel
lent work in furniture, clothing, pot
tery, jewelry and the decorative
aits. You can do all the browsing
there is to do in less than a day, and
we have no particular place to rec
ommend, since part of the fun is
separating the worthwhile from the
touristy.
For dinner, we tried the Men
docino Hotel. The attitude was . . .
relaxed. Despite the fact that we
made the required reservations, we
had to wait for 25 minutes to be
seated, which did not seem to dis
turb the hostess in the least.
Things got better, however. The
waitress, though overworked, tried
not to leave us with nothing to eat
for too long.
The garlic bread provided with
the meal is a garlic-lover's dream; a
real garlic taste, not too buttery,
and with a touch of melted cheese
to boot. The salads were plentiful
and fresh, and the tomatoes were
real, juicy and red, not your typical
supermarket superballs.
The Mendocino Hotel offers a
"light" menu of dishes under $10,

but be forewarned light really
means light. The baked chevre and
almonds, however, almost made up
in quality for what it lacked in quan
tity.
The regular entree menu is a
standard mix of meat and fish
dishes. We opted for the lamb
chops in a light sauce that was tasty
but not overpowering. We asked
that they be cooked medium and
they arrived pink inside, tender and
juicy throughout, the way lamb
chops should be.
For the truly adventurous with a
few extra days, explore the coast
between Mendocino and the
Oregon border. The last 100 miles
of the coast before hitting Oregon is
commonly known as the Lost
Coast. Although settled during the
1840s during the gold rush, major
roads were never developed along
this expanse of coast. The original
settlers relied upon infrequent
sailing ships for transport.
Small roads hug the coastal cliffs
throughout this area, and long
abandoned towns sit in decay here
and there. Be prepared for wet,
rainy weather, as much of the Lost
Coast logs more than 200 inches of
rainfall annually.
The tiny towns of Honeydew and
Petrolia both have small stores and
gas stations (limited hours during
the winter). There are occasional
motels in the area, but camping is
easily available. King's Range Na
tional Conservation Area has many
primitive campgrounds. Permits
are not required for fires, and
camping is free. For an excellent
guide to the Lost Coast, pick up the
"Let's Go Budget Guide to Califor
nia and the Pacific Northwest." The
Stanford Bookstore has several
copies available.

The Northern California coastline is only one of the many attrac
tions that Mendocino offers to the prospective visitor.
Mendocino (second in a two
part series)
Population: 1,008
Location: Approximately 180
miles northwest of Stanford on
Highway 1.
Area Code: 707
Visitors to Mendocino can walk
for miles through trails exploring
the rugged coast. Each turn of the
trail brings new surprises. Several
small coves have underwater tun
nels. When the surf rushes in, giant
blowholes splash water into the air.
Sea otters dance in the surf while
prying open their delicious dinner of
fresh abalone. At several spots
along Mendocino's bay, rusted
anchor chains and other relics of the
town's seafaring past have washed
ashore.
On clear, fogless winter days
visitors are well-advised to spend a
few hours just driving along scenic
Route 1, the coastal highway. This
roadway twists and winds past one
stunning panorama after another.
The drive south will instantly take
you to a photographer's paradise.
Should you choose to start out
driving north, you have to get past
industrial Fort Bragg before the
real scenery begins. Fort Bragg is
located about 15 minutes north of
Mendocino. The only sight worth
stopping for in Fort Bragg is the fa
mous Skunk Train (964-6371). The
train gets its name from the odor of
its steam engines. The train
operates once a day during the win
ter on the old logging route to Wil
lits. The trip takes about seven
and-a-half hours, round trip, includ
ing a lunch stop in Willits.
The Hill House Inn, a relatively
new addition to Mendocino (the

older of its two wings was built
eight years ago), is done up in a
style suggestive of a quaint New
England Inn. The location is excel
lent: atop a small hill, the inn
presents a view of the coast on one
side, the town on the other.
Reservations should be made three
to four weeks in advance during
peak times.
Accommodations range from
pleasant, functional rooms without
a view for $65, to beautiful fireplace
suites overlooking the ocean for
$110. These suites are well worth
it if your budget permits. Our
room, with a full ocean view but no
fireplace, cost us $90, a little steep
on a student budget. But how can
you beat watching the waves roll in
while breakfasting?
The breakfast provided with the
room was no ordinary continental
breakfast of a dry roll and cold,
weak coffee. The Hill House pro
vides outstaflfling fresh cakes and
muffins from a bakery in nearby
Fort Bragg. Guests telephone the
office when they are ready for
breakfast, and delivery takes less
than 60 seconds.
The staff at the Hill House is
friendly and competent, ready to
provide information on where to go
and what to do in and around Men
docino. During a recent visit, our
only regret was that the Hill House
Restaurant, which has an excep
tional view of the coast, was closed
for renovations. It seems the inn's
owners were displeased with the
job the people originally chosen to
run the restaurant had done, so
they decided to take on the job
themselves.
The renovated Hill House Res
taurant is scheduled to open this
weekend. If the rest of the inn is
any indication of its quality, it should
be well worth a visit.

We had only middling success
going out to eat while in Mendocino.
