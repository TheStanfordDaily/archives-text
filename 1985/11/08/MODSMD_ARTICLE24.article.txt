# An 'Insider' Tests La Pizzeria

La Pizzeria

Those forgettable days of
grade-school lunch plans, high
school gruel, and my bout with
food poisoning at luxurious
Stern Food Service have made
me particular in my eating
habits. I've grown quite fond of
the culinary world.
So it is that I would be writing
a restaurant review of the Italian
House's Pizzeria, and so it is that
I will not lie to you and leave out
that . . . well, as my mom puts
it, "but dear, you live there."
Had my own experience as a
customer been displeasing, I
would never have written this
article; had the food been bad, I
would never have wanted to
work there again.
La Pizzeria is a student-run
restaurant at the Italian House
open on Saturday nights from 5
to 10 p.m. Located along the
row cluster between 558
Mayfield and American Studies
House, La Pizzeria offers an at
tractive alternative to food ser
vice: the prices are reasonable
and the atmosphere is pleasant.
One notices the small, attractive
dining room with red and white
cloths and candlelight on each
table.
Not only do you have the
choice of pizzas about the size of
a frisbee, but La Pizzeria also of
fers a salad bar, the special of
the week and ice cream with
amaretto for dessert. Past spe
cials include fettucine con vongole
and lasagne homemade by the
mother of La Pizzeria's
manager, Paul McCloone.
La Pizzeria is voluntarily run
by members of the Italian

House. Those who work there
always seem to enjoy them
selves. Most of the business to
date has been from word of
mouth to friends and cohorts. So
the next time the thought of
driving off campus to find a place
to eat comes up, you might be
making things hard on yourself.
Actually, I have always been
curious to see how the custom
ers are treated, and you never
really know until you try. I
decided to sit down and find out.
My guest and-1 were fortunate to
be served by a woman who
doesn't live at Italian House. No
special treatment. Truthfully, I
wouldn't have gotten much
anyway.
I'll give you my guest's reac
tions first. She ordered the
calzone, a favorite of ricotta
cheese fans, but-not of mine. It
looks something like a folded
over waffle. Her favorable com
ments centered on the cour
teous service and the generous
quantity of the food. However,
she did impatiently wait five
minutes more than I for her dish
— the calzone takes longer to

make than the pizza.
I ordered a ham, olive and
mushroom pizza, my motivation
being that you can use your
hands eating pizza, and no one
would comment on my rotten
manners. Besides, the taste of
good pizza — the house makes
its own sauce and dough —
saved me from the greasy, over
priced Domino's variety, to
which I have yet to fall prey this
year.
I offer several tips to those of
you who plan to visit the Piz
zeria. The Pizzeria is usually
only half-full early on from 5 to 6
p.m., and again after 8. At these
-times you are guaranteed better
service and more room.
Secondly, if you are in a large
group making reservations (497-
0739), allow the house to make
preparations. Third, if you en
courage the help, you can usually
get them to toss dough in the air,
able or not.
Finally, you are welcome to
bring wine or champagne if you
desire. The group next to me
was celebrating a birthday. Just
be careful with your cork.
