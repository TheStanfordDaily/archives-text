## Card Looks To Light It Up Against OSU 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
Tomorrow night, in a lonely East Coast suburb, a
man in a dirty white T-shirt will sneak down his base
ment stairs and tiptoe to the Zenith he has stashed in
the corner.
"I gotta have it,"he whispers. His hand shakes as he
flips the channels. "Football. Any football." He wipes
the sweat off his forehead. "Please. I promise to be
good from now on. Just this once. I gotta have it."
It looks bleak. Nothing but prime-time shows and
videos until. . .
"From Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto, California, it's
Stanford versus Oregon State!"
"Hallelujah!" The man sinks to his knees, a smile
creasing his sweaty face. "Thank you, Ted! Thank
you!"
Think of this man tomorrow night, when you're
freezing in the bleachers, watching the battle between
the 2-6 Cardinal and the 3-5 Beavers. He's one of the
few people that will be happy that the Turner Broad
casting System is televising tomorrow's meaningless
game, the only Pacific 10 Conference matchup that was
available.
In order to get a bigger audience, TBS decreed that
the game would start at 5:15 p.m. Pacific Time, prime
time on the East Coast. That's perfect for TV football
junkies, but for the estimated 37,000 people who will
show up, it means long tailgaters, cold seats and a dark
trip home.
So the game had better be worth the hassle. The
current spread is Stanford by 14, but don't be
surprised if it's a lot tighter than that.
Hey, OSU has a better record than Stanford. The
Beavers jumped California 23-20 back in September
and shocked Washington 21-20 three weeks ago to land
themselves in sixth place in the Pac-10. If they win to
morrow, they will finish ahead of the Cardinal for the
first time in decades.
The biggest reason for Oregon State's turnaround
this year is new Head Coach Dave Kragthorpe, for

merly an assistant coach at Brigham Young. Krag
thorpe jumpstarted the sluggish Beavers and their
even more sluggish fans by installing a wide-open of
fensive attack.
"Our philosophy is simple," he said before the
season. "We'll throw the ball from any place on the
field. We'll throw from our own 1-yard line and we'll
throw from the other guy's 1-yard line. We'll throw it
from any place on the field to all the eligible receivers.
"I like to light up the scoreboard, to score, to win,"
he continued. "No one is going to come to the stadium
and be bored. But I hope for a while that people don't
be too critical if sometimes people in the wrong color
jerseys get their hands on the ball. If we don't make it,
we'll go down in flames, go down smoking."
That's exactly what's happened this season. When
the Oregon State air show clicks, it's good enough to
beat the best of them. When it doesn't, the Beavers
get burned by scores like 63-0 (USC) and 34-0
(Washington State).
The pilot of Air Kragthorpe is freshman quarterback
Rich Gonzales, who came on for the injured Erik Wil
helm — also a freshman — midway through the
season. Gonzales shone in the upset of Washington,
but he was hammered in last week's 27-6 loss to
Arizona when his protection broke down.
"He got knocked around," Kragthorpe admitted.
"He's only 18, and you're going to have new and differ
ent experiences every time out. Overall, he's doing
everything we could ask of him."
His main target is All-Pac-10 flanker Reggie Bynum,
who has caught 48 passes for 584 yards and seven
touchdowns this year. Fullback Darvin Malone has 25
receptions, and leads the OSU ground attack with 433
yards on 100 carries.
On defense, the Beavers have been tough at times
this year. Arizona didn't score a single touchdown
against the Oregon State defense last week, and could
manage only 13 first downs and 90 yards passing.
OSU has picked off 19 passes this year — six each
by cornerback Lavance Northington and safety Michael

Missed tackles cost the Cardinal dearly in last week's 34-0 loss to the Washington Huskies. Toi
Cook will work on wrapping up opposing ball-carriers Saturday against the Beavers. Kickoff is
scheduled for 5:15 p.m.
Lopez — and outside linebacker Osia Lewis has 101
tackles. But the Beavers have allowed 31 points a
game, giving up an average of 387.5 yards a game.
That kind of opposition could be just what the sput
tering Cardinal offense needs. After last week's
shutout at Washington, quarterback John Paye and
company need a confidence-builder.
"We have to put things together on offense, be more
physical on offense," Stanford Coach Jack Elway said.
"I look at this game (Oregon State) as one where we
find out what our offensive personality is going to be."
The personality is going to include fullback Brad
Muster this week, but tailback Kevin Scott will prob
ably start ahead of Thomas Henley. Henley bruised the
A.C. joint in his right shoulder against Washington, and
did not wear pads in practice until yesterday.

Paye will be trying to get the ball to tight end Greg
Baty a little more than he did last week, when Baty
caught one pass. But Elway is expecting that his star
tight end, who has 47 grabs on the season, will get the
same kind of man-on-man coverage that he got against
Washington.
"He's the guy who's been catching the ball," Elway
said. "I could anticipate that this (man-on-man
coverage) would happen against Oregon State as well."
Considering that over the last four games Stanford
has averaged 10.8 points and Oregon State has
averaged 6.8, the odds are in the favor of a low-scoring
contest. Which is one more reason why TBS execu
tives are probably biting their nails over this one.
But hey, when you're a football junkie, it just doesn't
matter.
Card notes
Stanford safety Brad Humphreys is questionable
for tomorrow's game with a pinched nerve in his neck.
