After only three weeks of
practice, the Stanford men's bas
ketball team is facing its first com
petition of the season when it hosts
the Australian National Team
tonight at 7:30 at Maples Pavilion.
Admission is free.
Coach Tom Davis doesn't mind
the early start on things, though.
"It's going to be a good test," he
said before last night's practice.
"It's unique to play an exhibition
this early. It's good because if we
see any problems, we have 18 days
to make corrections. The other
thing is that it forces us to think
about the season earlier."
One problem the Cardinal won't
be facing is a lack of depth. "We've
got 10 guys contending for starting

positions," Davis said. "We'll start
five the first half and have them call
in their subs, and for the second
half we'll start the other five."
Davis said the first-half starters
will be guards Keith Ramee and
Novian Whitsitt, forwards Andy
Fischer and Greg Butler and center
Eric Reveno. The second-half
group will have guard Steve Brown
and forward Earl Koberlein joined
by a trio of freshmen — guard
Terry Taylor, forward Todd Lichti
and center Howard Wright.
"You never know how the fresh
men are going to play under the
bright lights," Davis said. "They've
looked good under the afternoon
lights in practice, but it'll be another
set of lights tomorrow night."
In the Australians, Stanford will
be seeing virtually the same team
that finished seventh at the 1984
Olympics in Los Angeles. The na

tional team defeated a visiting
Pacific 10 Conference all-star team
convincingly in three games this
summer.
Davis and assistant Gary Close
coached that Pac-10 team, and
Koberlein played two games on the
trip before being sidelined with the
loss of two teeth in collision under
the basket.
Australia is led by 6-foot-10 cen
ter Ray Borner, the most valuable
player in the Australian National
Basketball League. Borner
averaged 22 points and 12 rebounds
for the Coburg Giants this past
season.
Cal Bruton, a 5-9 guard, played
his college ball at Wichita State and
is now an Australian citizen. He
averaged 17 points per game with
the Brisbane Bullets.
Others to watch are 6-0 guard
Philip Smyth, a veteran of 124 in
ternational games, and Andrew

Gaze, a 20-year-old 6-6 forward
who averaged over 30 points a
game for the Melbourne Tigers this
season.
"They're not going to be im
patient," Koberlein said of the
Australians, who have an average
age of almost 25. "They've been

around the block a few times. They
aren't great athletes, they're just
smart — : good shooters and good
passers.
"International ball tends to be a
little more physical," Koberlein
said. "They know how to use their
bodies."
