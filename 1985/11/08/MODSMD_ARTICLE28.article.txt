# Hockey Travels to Cal To End Regular Season
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
This afternoon at UC-
Berkeley, the Stanford field
hockey team will close out its
most successful regular season
ever. Meanwhile, the squad will
likely be thinking about its first
ever appearance in post-season
NCAA play.
The Cardinal will be looking for
its ninth straight win and to better
an already impressive overall
record of 9-3-1. The team's 5-1-1
Northern Pacific Conference
record gives it an undisputed hold
on first place in the final stand

ings, regardless of the outcome of
this afternoon's game.
While Stanford might be able to
take the game lightly, California's
end-of-the-year position rests on
the outcome of this game. The
Bears are now tied with San Jose
State for second place, with a
conference record of 3-3-1.
At the same time Cal plays the
Cardinal today, the Spartans will
face the University of the Pacific.
If either Stanford or San Jose
wins while the other loses, the
victorious team will be the confer
ence's sole bridesmaid. If they
both win or both lose, they will
finish the season in dual posses
sion of second place.

Despite the fact that Stanford
has wrapped up not only a NorPac
title but a NCAA playoff berth,
the Cardinal will not take
game lightly. "We all realize that it
will have a lot to do with our
seeding (in the NCAA tourna
ment)," co-captain Suzanne Doi
said.
And that's not the only reason
the Cardinal will be ready for the
Bears. "It's important because
it's Cal," Doi said.
In their only other meeting this
fall, the two squads battled
through 70 minutes of regulation
and 20 minutes of overtime until
the game finally ended with Stan
ford on top 1-0.
