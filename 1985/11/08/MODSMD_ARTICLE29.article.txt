# Stanford Heads South For UCLA Showdown
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
The conference championship and No. 1 ranking will
be on the line tonight as the top-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team travels to UCLA's John
Wooden Center to battle the second-ranked Bruins.
The two teams — both 5-1 in Pac-West play this
season — built quite a rivalry in the space of a single
year alone. In December UCLA came from way behind
to steal the national championship from the Cardinal at
Pauley Pavilion, and earlier this season Stanford routed
the Bruins in three games at Maples Pavilion.
"Last year's loss (in the championship) will make us
go after it more," Stanford sophomore Theresa Smith
said. "We don't want to let the same thing happen
again."
In that championship game last season, Stanford
held a 12-3 lead in the deciding fifth game before letting
the match slip gradually out of their hands.
Cardinal Co-coach Don Shaw is not concerned,
however, about possible jitters upon returning to the
scene of the great disappointment. "This is a different
season," he said. "They (UCLA) have a lot of the same
players, but they use different formations all of the
time."
UCLA Coach Andy Banachowski also downplayed
the possibility of a psychological advantage for the
Bruins. "We're not playing at Pauley which is where we
played them at the championship," he explained.
Banachowski did, however, indicate that the Bruins
should be supported by an enthusiastic crowd tonight.
"People have been talking about this one for a while,"
he said. "I know that Stanford rooters have been call
ing for reservations. It should be packed."
When the Cardinal defeated UCLA 15-6, 15-10, 15-
11 on Oct. 4, the Bruins, playing without their two top
players, were badly outmatched and somewhat embar
rassed before a tremendous Maples Pavilion crowd,
i Banachowski indicated that the Bruins still remem
ber that night. "We tend to play a little bit better after

incidents like that," he said.
And indeed the Bruins have been strong, losing just
one match since the loss to the Cardinal and winning
their past five conference matches.
Hurt by injuries and suspensions earlier in the
season, UCLA is now back at full strength.
"We're getting to the point where we have
everybody back at practice," Banachowski said. "We
now have the starting lineup that I thought we would
have at the start of the season."
"They are playing real well," Shaw added.
Liz Masakayan — last season's Collegiate Player of
the Year — has had another oustanding season since
being hindered first by a suspension and then by an in
jury. She had been kept out of the lineup for discipli
nary reasons when the Cardinal defeated the Bruins at
Maples.
"She had a little knee strain earlier, but she's back
on her game now," Banachowski said.
"She's a great player," Shaw said. "She's going to
get her kills. We'll just try to contain her."
The fact that the Cardinal team has not seen UCLA's
best team yet this season does not seem to be of too
much concern. "We know how the other players play,"
Smith said.
"We've played them before last year when they
(Masakayan and Dawn Kenny) were on the team,"
Smith added. "We know their hitting tendencies. All we
have to do is concentrate and play our positions. We'll
be ready for them."
Tomorrow night the Cardinal women travel to the
volleyball haven of Malibu to play a Pepperdine team
that has been somewhat of a puzzle this season.
"They've been kind of in and out of the Top 20,"
Shaw said.
The Waves have been strong against the weaker
teams but have been unable to be consistent other
wise. "They haven't been able to beat the top teams,"
Shaw indicated.
Nevertheless, Pepperdine has a lot of talent and
should pose a serious threat to the No. 1 Cardinal.
"Everyone expected them to have a good team," Shaw
said. "They should be very dangerous."

Christy Moiso saw action in Tuesday's rout of Santa Clara, but the Cardinal's outside hitter is
unlikely to play tonight against UCLA.
