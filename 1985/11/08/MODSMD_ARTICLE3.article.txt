# Fac Sen Views Kaplan Report
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy told the Faculty Senate
yesterday that he concurs with the
findings of an investigation into
charges of police brutality at an
anti-apartheid sit-in here last
month.
At its regular semi-weekly
meeting, the senate also heard
Kennedy explain several tax
proposals now in Congress that, if
passed, could harm the University's
finances.
On Oct. 16, Kennedy asked Law
Prof. John Kaplan to investigate al
legations that Stanford police used
unnecessary force, including
compliance-pain holds, in the sit-in
arrests at Old Union on Oct. 11.
Kaplan's report, issued Monday,
found police actions "wrong and un
justifiable" but called for no specific
disciplinary action against Stanford
officers.
Kennedy told the senate that the
compliance-pain holds "were not
the appropriate ones for use on
passive protesters" in this situa
tion.
According to Kennedy, Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington
recognized that the holds were in
appropriate and has changed the
way in which officers remove
protesters from civil disobedience
scenes.
When Anthropology Prof. James
Gibbs questioned Kennedy on what
Gibbs called the lack of a "sense of
concern" and "passion" expressed
publicly by the University on behalf

of the protesters, Kennedy said his
"responsibility" also extends to
members of the staff, including
police officers.
"It seems to me passion in
declaration in these matters is per
haps less important as what one
does," Kennedy said.
He said the University will ask
the Santa Clara County sheriff to
conduct a "diligent investigation" of
allegations that officers at the North
County Jail beat senior Robby
Perkins when he was taken there
after his civil disobedience arrest.
Kennedy said that despite
Perkins' allegations, the evidence
does not sustain the charge that he
was maliciously beaten by police.
"That is what we don't know
about," Kennedy said, "and that
seems to be the very center of the
issue."
Kennedy said there is evidence
that Perkins was involved in a
"considerable struggle" with offi
cers at the jail.
Kaplan, the author of the report
and a member of the senate, said
Perkins' uncooperative actions con
tributed to the incident.
"There is no doubt that there
was 'unpleasantnesses' there,"
Kaplan said, "but I also know that
he kept trying to leave the cell."
"Jailors take a dim view of their
people trying leaving the cell with
out permission, and there was obvi
ously some physical restraint,"
Kaplan said. "To say that he was
singularly uncooperative in the jail
would be to underestimate him. He
kept trying to leave, and he
wouldn't stay put."
The evidence was insufficient to
determine the necessity of the
force used by Santa Clara County
sheriffs deputies in the incident,
Kaplan said.
"I know approximately how much
force was used on Perkins, but I
don't know how much was neces
sary under the real conditions that
were there," Kaplan said.
The University's policy on arrest
and prosecution of protesters was
also amplified in a written state
ment by John Schwartz, the Uni
versity's vice president and general
counsel.
The University "has an obligation
to protect the basic activities of the
institution from serious disruption,
which requires that at some point it
request arrests if necessary to put
an end to disruptive occupations of
the premises where those institu
tional activities are carried on,"
Schwartz wrote.
Despite the stated intentions of
the protesters, the University will
treat conventual crime and inten
tional civil disobedience in a similar
matter, Kennedy said.
"Treatment of such matters has

to be independent of whether
people announce a particular pur
pose or not," Kennedy said. "You
have to be guided by what their be
havior is."
In other action, Kennedy told the
senate about tax proposals now
pending in Congress that could ad
versely affect University finances.
If enacted, the proposals will
place private educational institu
tions such as Stanford at a
"conspicuous disadvantage" to their
public counterparts, Kennedy said.
According to Kennedy, one pro
posal will terminate the authority of
private institutions to issue tax
exempt revenue bonds to help
finance the construction of educa
tional facilities.
The proposal calls for a cap on
exemption limits, either on individ
ual institutions or on a state's
cumulative total, Kennedy said,
adding that this would give undue
advantage to public universities
with unlimited borrowing abilities
and tax-supported capital expendi
tures.
"The cap, in effect, takes us out
of tax-exempt borrowing," Ken
nedy said.
Another proposal would alter the
tax treatment of appreciated as
sets, a vital component of large
donations to the University, Ken

nedy said.
According to Kennedy, the pro
posal would eliminate the deduction
of the appreciation, or increase in
value, of assets transferred to the
University.
The result would be a "profound
discouragement to the donation of
such assets" to the University,
Kennedy said.
Kennedy said the University will
actively lobby the House Ways and
Means Committee and other com
mittees against the bills, but he
added, "We are not doing well on
either (of the proposals)."
The senate also heard the annual
report of the Committee on Re
search, chaired by Medical School
Dean David Korn.
Although the report contained no
new policy recommendations, the
committee recommended clarifica
tion of the existing guidelines on
secrecy in research.
Senate chairman Elie Abel also
announced that the senate will not
discuss allegations of improper ac
tivities by the Hoover Institution.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz had
requested debate on Hoover's al
leged political ties be formally
scheduled, but his request was
denied by the Steering Committee.
"Senate debate at this time
would be premature," Abel said.
