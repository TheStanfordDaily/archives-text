# Fac Sen Views Kaplan Report
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy told the Faculty Senate
yesterday that he concurs with the
findings of an investigation into
charges of police brutality at an
anti-apartheid sit-in here last
month.
At its regular semi-weekly
meeting, the senate also heard
Kennedy explain several tax
proposals now in Congress that, if
passed, could harm the University's
finances.
On Oct. 16, Kennedy asked Law
Prof. John Kaplan to investigate al
legations that Stanford police used
unnecessary force, including
compliance-pain holds, in the sit-in
arrests at Old Union on Oct. 11.
Kaplan's report, issued Monday,
found police actions "wrong and un
justifiable" but called for no specific
disciplinary action against Stanford
officers.
Kennedy told the senate that the
compliance-pain holds "were not
the appropriate ones for use on
passive protesters" in this situa
tion.
According to Kennedy, Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington
recognized that the holds were in
appropriate and has changed the
way in which officers remove
protesters from civil disobedience
scenes.
When Anthropology Prof. James
Gibbs questioned Kennedy on what
Gibbs called the lack of a "sense of
concern" and "passion" expressed
publicly by the University on behalf

of the protesters, Kennedy said his
"responsibility" also extends to
members of the staff, including
police officers.
"It seems to me passion in
declaration in these matters is per
haps less important as what one
does," Kennedy said.
He said the University will ask
the Santa Clara County sheriff to
conduct a "diligent investigation" of
allegations that officers at the North
County Jail beat senior Robby
Perkins when he was taken there
after his civil disobedience arrest.
Kennedy said that despite
Perkins' allegations, the evidence
does not sustain the charge that he
was maliciously beaten by police.
"That is what we don't know
about," Kennedy said, "and that
seems to be the very center of the
issue."
Kennedy said there is evidence
that Perkins was involved in a
"considerable struggle" with offi
cers at the jail.
Kaplan, the author of the report
and a member of the senate, said
Perkins' uncooperative actions con
tributed to the incident.
"There is no doubt that there
was 'unpleasantnesses' there,"
Kaplan said, "but I also know that
he kept trying to leave the cell."
"Jailors take a dim view of their
people trying leaving the cell with
out permission, and there was obvi
ously some physical restraint,"
Kaplan said. "To say that he was
singularly uncooperative in the jail
would be to underestimate him. He
kept trying to leave, and he
