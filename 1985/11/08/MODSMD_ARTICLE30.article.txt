# Water Polo Hosts USC at DeGuerre
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff writer 
The Stanford water polo team
will look to maintain its current No.
1 national ranking today as it hosts
No. 8 USC, 17-10 on the year, at 3
p.m. at DeGuerre Pool.
The Cardinal, 19-4, has three
matches remaining in the season
before the NCAA Championships,
all of them Pacific-10 Conference
matches.
Stanford, 3-0 in the conference,
currently leads the Pac-10, and a
victory this afternoon over USC (1-
1) would guarantee Stanford at
least a tie for first place in the con
ference.
"A win over USC would virtually
lock up a number one spot in the
conference for us," Stanford Coach
Dante Dettamanti said. "We are
seeded No. 1 and we want to stay
that way entering the NCAAs so
the next the next three games we
play will be very important."
Stanford will play UC-Berkeley
next weekend in Berkeley and will
host the Bears the following
weekend in the "Big Splash" of the
season.
Today's matchup of the No. 1

team versus the No. 8 team ap
pears quite predictable, but accord
ing to Dettamanti, the Trojans are a
highly unpredictable team.
"USC is really hard to figure out
because their level of play fluctu
ates so drastically," Dettamanti
said. "In the 49er tournament, they
lost to a team ranked below them
and played their best against
higher-ranked teams. They obvi
ously play better against better
competition.
"The Trojans are a really young
team. They come out very emo
tionally at the start of each match so
we will have to make sure they
don't take the lead at the start."
After a successful tournament
last weekend, Dettamanti said he is
very pleased with the way the team
is playing and working together.
"I have very few complaints with
the team. Last weekend we put
everything together and did a lot of
'the little things' right," Dettamanti
said. "In our one loss, our 6-5
wasn't working very well, but we
worked on that this week, going
over the basics, and I think we are
going to do a lot better with that
today."
After 23 matches, the Card's top
scorer is Craig Klass with 44 goals.

could clinch a tie for the Pac 10 title. Stanford, ranked No. 1 in
the country, sports a 3-0 conference record. USC's conference
record stands at 1-1.

Chris Woolfolk may be looking for an open teammate, but the
Cardinal water polo team has its eyes on a national champion
ship. By winning today's game with league-rival USC, Stanford
