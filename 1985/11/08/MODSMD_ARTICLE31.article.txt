# Crew To Row in Regatta
## 
### BRANDI WATSON Staff writer 
The Stanford women's crew season doesn't officially
start until the spring, but the team is looking to get an
early start on things. The Cardinal will be out rowing
this Sunday in what it hopes will be a helpful training
exercise.
The team will travel to Sacramento to compete in
the Head of the American River Open Regatta.
"It's not a crucial race. It's mainly to get experi
ence," Coach John Davis said.
Team members aren't expecting a win. The Cardinal
just started training and isn't in top form yet.
"We're just starting to get to the point where we can
do a decent job," Davis said.
The Stanford rowers should be in excellent shape by
spring, however, thanks to the new training philoso
phy. "Last year we went out too fast," Davis said, ex
plaining the slower approach to training this year. Last
year the Cardinal was not in the top five in the nation
for the first time in a long while. "We didn't go as fast as
we wanted to," Davis said.
The competition on Sunday is just another part of
the training. It is a three-mile race on a narrow and

winding course, much longer than the 2,000-meter
races the women will encounter in the spring. "It takes
about 17 or 18 minutes — it's tough," Davis said.
Besides providing experience, the race holds an ex
tra importance. It is to be run on Lake Notoma, the
same course that will host the Pacific Coast Champion
ships in the spring. Racing there is an excellent oppor
tunity for the crews to become familiar with the area
and the course.
Stanford will enter four boats to compete against
such teams as UC-Davis, Sacramento State and Hum
boldt State. The team looks to be very balanced this
year so every boat is expected to do well.
"We have more depth this year and more good
people," Davis said. "It should be just as exciting to be
in the second varsity boat as the varsity boat."
Stanford also enticed some high school talent to the
Farm. Davis expects immediate contributions from
freshmen Amy Berner, Betsy Hamm, Christie May
and Jennifer Scotti. "We have a lot of good talent. . .
hard workers, good athletes and unselfish people,"
Davis said.
In the true spirit of team play, however, Davis was
hesitant to single out individuals for praise. "The only
star is the boat," Davis said. "If the boat does well,
everyone is a star."
