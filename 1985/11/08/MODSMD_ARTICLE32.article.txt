# Donald Kennedy Picks the Winners
## 
### 
The Greek rolls on into Week
Five, with the Daily Greeks finally
out-performing the Guest Greeks
Last week's 44-16 record (.744)
gave the Daily Greeks a 157-83
record (.654) for the year.
Last week's guest, Dean of Ad
missions Jean Fetter, went 6-4 as
the Guest Greeks went to 24-16
(.600).
The Guest Greek of the Week
has reached a new pinnacle this
week, as University President
Donald Kennedy has been tabbed
for the illustrious honor.
"I'm always very accurate," Ken
nedy said when he learned of his se
lection outside the Faculty Senate
meeting yesterday. Kennedy,
however, claimed he was late for
the meeting (in fact he was a good
45 seconds early), and opted to
make his choices later in the even
ing.
After obviously having ruminated
for several hours on the grave re
sponsibility of being the Greek (he

mumbled something about hosting a
fund-raising dinner last night, but
we know better), Kennedy put
forth a set of picks that should chal
lenge the current Guest Greek
record of 7-3, held by former Daily
Sports Editor Mark Zeigler and
former Daily Editor in Chief Kristen
Christopher.
Kennedy picked the Cardinal to
dispose of Oregon State tomorrow.
"It'll be a solid, workman-like win
for the Cardinal, with some being
saved for next week in the desert,"
he said, referring to next week's
clash at Arizona State.
Kennedy showed his knowledge
of college football by picking Divi
sion I-AA powerhouse Richmond
over Ivy League foe Brown.
"That's your cripple," he said. His
upset special is Arizona State over
Washington.
"My record is impeccable," Ken
nedy said of his past record as
Guest Greek, though he didn't
recall his prior record

The Greek rolls on into Week
Five, with the Daily Greeks finally
out-performing the Guest Greeks
Last week's 44-16 record (.744)
gave the Daily Greeks a 157-83
record (.654) for the year.
Last week's guest, Dean of Ad
missions Jean Fetter, went 6-4 as
the Guest Greeks went to 24-16
(.600).
The Guest Greek of the Week
has reached a new pinnacle this
week, as University President
Donald Kennedy has been tabbed
for the illustrious honor.
"I'm always very accurate," Ken
nedy said when he learned of his se
lection outside the Faculty Senate
meeting yesterday. Kennedy,
however, claimed he was late for
the meeting (in fact he was a good
45 seconds early), and opted to
make his choices later in the even
ing.
After obviously having ruminated
for several hours on the grave re
sponsibility of being the Greek (he

mumbled something about hosting a
fund-raising dinner last night, but
we know better), Kennedy put
forth a set of picks that should chal
lenge the current Guest Greek
record of 7-3, held by former Daily
Sports Editor Mark Zeigler and
former Daily Editor in Chief Kristen
Christopher.
Kennedy picked the Cardinal to
dispose of Oregon State tomorrow.
"It'll be a solid, workman-like win
for the Cardinal, with some being
saved for next week in the desert,"
he said, referring to next week's
clash at Arizona State.
Kennedy showed his knowledge
of college football by picking Divi
sion I-AA powerhouse Richmond
over Ivy League foe Brown.
"That's your cripple," he said. His
upset special is Arizona State over
Washington.
"My record is impeccable," Ken
nedy said of his past record as
Guest Greek, though he didn't
recall his prior record
