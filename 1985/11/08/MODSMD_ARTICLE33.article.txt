Arafat Vows To Limit Violence
CAIRO, Egypt — Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman
Yasser Arafat, under heavy pressure from Jordan and Egypt to
prove his commitment to the peace process, pledged yesterday to
suspend all PLO military operations outside Israel and not to attack
civilians inside the Jewish state.
However, Arafat stopped short of renouncing all forms of violence
against Israel and appeared to introduce a note of ambiguity by also
declaring that the PLO "reiterates the right of the Palestinian people
to fight against Israeli occupation in all possible ways."
The wording of the pledge, the significance of which Arafat sought
to enhance by naming it"The Cairo Declaration," was worked out in
two days of talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
With Mubarak at his side, Arafat told reporters that the PLO
"denounces and condemns all terrorist acts, whether those by
countries, or by persons or groups, against unarmed civilians in any
place."
In a veiled reference to the hijacking of the Italian cruise liner Ac
hille Lauro and the killing of an elderly American passenger last
month, Arafat noted that recent incidents have had "adverse effects
on the Palestinian people's cause." But he said the PLO "condemns
all outside operations and all forms of terrorism and repeats once
more the commitment of all its institutions and factions to this deci
sion. "
Officials said the key lines in Arafat's pledge were the condemna
tion of "all outside operations" — meaning outside Israel — and of
attacks against civilians "in any place," including Israel.
Hostage Deaths Still Unverified
BEIRUT — An anonymous caller said Islamic Jihad extremists
planned to kill their half-dozen American hostages yesterday, and a
second caller claimed they were dead. But no bodies were found in
the designated spot.
The captives were to be "executed" by firing squad because indi
rect negotiations with the United States had reached "a dead end,"
the first man said in a call to a Western news agency.
In Washington, however, a White House official said "contacts" in
the Lebanon hostage case had not broken down. And President
Reagan said of the death threat, "Evidently there is no substantiation
of that at all."
Since the calls could not be authenticated, it was impossible to de
termine whether they were a macabre hoax or simply part of a war of
nerves being waged by the shadowy Shiite Moslem faction to pres
sure Washington into making a deal.
Six Americans are missing in Lebanon. Islamic Jihad claimed Oct.
4 it killed one of them, diplomat William Buckley, 57. But no body has
turned up.
Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, believed made up of fundamen
talist followers of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, had said it
would release the Americans when Kuwait frees 17 Shiite comrades
serving prison terms for the bombings of the U.S. and French em
bassies in Kuwait in December 1983. Kuwait refuses. '
Death Unrelated to Yurchenko
TORONTO — Toronto police said yesterday the death of a Soviet
woman earlier this week definitely was a suicide that apparently
resulted from depression over being separated from her teen-aged
son and friends in Moscow.
There had been speculation here and in the United States that the
death Tuesday of Svetlana Dedkova, 48, might be linked to the case
of KGB officer Vitaly Yurchenko, who was said by CIA officers to
have returned to Moscow after defecting to the United States be
cause of a broken love affair with a Soviet woman living in Canada.
Neighbors of Dedkova said they dimly remembered seeing a man
resembling the 50-year-old, mustachioed Yurchenko in their apart
ment building. But Canadian and U.S. officials,denied that there was
any connection between Dedkova and Yurchenko.
Meanwhile, a sergeant in division 2 of the Toronto Police Depart
ment who asked not to be identified said yesterday that Dedkova,
the wife of a Soviet trade representative, had written a note to a
female friend in Moscow before she jumped Tuesday morning from
her 27th-floor apartment in suburban Etobicoke.
"There was no mention or any other indication that she killed her
self for any other reason" than her separation from family and
friends, the sergeant said. He added that a coroner's autopsy found
that Dedkova had died as the result of injuries incurred in the fall.
Stray Jet Spurs Soviet Scramble
TOKYO — A Japan Air Lines plane veered off course last month
and triggered an apparent scramble by Soviet jets from the island of
Sakhalin where Soviet warplanes shot down a Korean airliner two
years ago, Defense Agency officials said Wednesday.
They said JAL Flight 441 out of Tokyo bound for Paris via Moscow
on Oct. 31 flew 68 miles east of its prescribed course over the Japan
Sea as a result of pilot error.
The pilot of the Boeing 747, Morihiko Nishioka, notified flight con
trollers in Khabarovsk, Siberia, that he was off course some 17
minutes after Japanese Air Self Defense Force radar discovered the
error, the Defense Ministry said. The plane, carrying 132 pas
sengers and crew, returned to its normal course without incident,
the officials said.
Chile Cracks Down on Protests
SANTIAGO, Chile — The government said yesterday it will be as
tough as necessary in stopping any repetitions of a two-day protest
against military rule. The battles have killed four people and left
scores wounded.
Interior Minister Ricardo Garcia said the 12-year-old military
regime will take "drastic measures" to maintain public order.
Garcia did not elaborate, but the government has wide powers to
punish dissidents. Many activists in previous protests have been
tried for violations of national security or sent to internal exile in
remote villages.
Police said two people died yesterday of bullet wounds suffered in
the previous two days of protest organized by political parties and
other opposition groups.
That brought the death toll to four. Another 25 people were hospi
talized with bullet wounds and a total of about 70 people were hurt,
many of them hit by police shotgun fire. Hundreds of people were ar
rested.
Thousands of people went into the streets, marching and building
barricades. Protests against Pinochet, an army general who came
to power after a coup in September 1973 have cost 134 lives since
1983.

Death Unrelated to Yurchenko
TORONTO — Toronto police said yesterday the death of a Soviet
woman earlier this week definitely was a suicide that apparently
resulted from depression over being separated from her teen-aged
son and friends in Moscow.
There had been speculation here and in the United States that the
death Tuesday of Svetlana Dedkova, 48, might be linked to the case
of KGB officer Vitaly Yurchenko, who was said by CIA officers to
have returned to Moscow after defecting to the United States be
cause of a broken love affair with a Soviet woman living in Canada.
Neighbors of Dedkova said they dimly remembered seeing a man
resembling the 50-year-old, mustachioed Yurchenko in their apart
ment building. But Canadian and U.S. officials,denied that there was
any connection between Dedkova and Yurchenko.
Meanwhile, a sergeant in division 2 of the Toronto Police Depart
ment who asked not to be identified said yesterday that Dedkova,
the wife of a Soviet trade representative, had written a note to a
female friend in Moscow before she jumped Tuesday morning from
her 27th-floor apartment in suburban Etobicoke.
"There was no mention or any other indication that she killed her
self for any other reason" than her separation from family and
friends, the sergeant said. He added that a coroner's autopsy found
that Dedkova had died as the result of injuries incurred in the fall.
Stray Jet Spurs Soviet Scramble
TOKYO — A Japan Air Lines plane veered off course last month
and triggered an apparent scramble by Soviet jets from the island of
Sakhalin where Soviet warplanes shot down a Korean airliner two
years ago, Defense Agency officials said Wednesday.
They said JAL Flight 441 out of Tokyo bound for Paris via Moscow
on Oct. 31 flew 68 miles east of its prescribed course over the Japan
Sea as a result of pilot error.
The pilot of the Boeing 747, Morihiko Nishioka, notified flight con
trollers in Khabarovsk, Siberia, that he was off course some 17
minutes after Japanese Air Self Defense Force radar discovered the
error, the Defense Ministry said. The plane, carrying 132 pas
sengers and crew, returned to its normal course without incident,
the officials said.
Chile Cracks Down on Protests
SANTIAGO, Chile — The government said yesterday it will be as
tough as necessary in stopping any repetitions of a two-day protest
against military rule. The battles have killed four people and left
scores wounded.
Interior Minister Ricardo Garcia said the 12-year-old military
regime will take "drastic measures" to maintain public order.
Garcia did not elaborate, but the government has wide powers to
punish dissidents. Many activists in previous protests have been
tried for violations of national security or sent to internal exile in
remote villages.
Police said two people died yesterday of bullet wounds suffered in
the previous two days of protest organized by political parties and
other opposition groups.
That brought the death toll to four. Another 25 people were hospi
talized with bullet wounds and a total of about 70 people were hurt,
many of them hit by police shotgun fire. Hundreds of people were ar
rested.
Thousands of people went into the streets, marching and building
barricades. Protests against Pinochet, an army general who came
to power after a coup in September 1973 have cost 134 lives since
1983.
Arafat Vows To Limit Violence
CAIRO, Egypt — Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman
Yasser Arafat, under heavy pressure from Jordan and Egypt to
prove his commitment to the peace process, pledged yesterday to
suspend all PLO military operations outside Israel and not to attack
civilians inside the Jewish state.
However, Arafat stopped short of renouncing all forms of violence
against Israel and appeared to introduce a note of ambiguity by also
declaring that the PLO "reiterates the right of the Palestinian people
to fight against Israeli occupation in all possible ways."
The wording of the pledge, the significance of which Arafat sought
to enhance by naming it"The Cairo Declaration," was worked out in
two days of talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
With Mubarak at his side, Arafat told reporters that the PLO
"denounces and condemns all terrorist acts, whether those by
countries, or by persons or groups, against unarmed civilians in any
place."
In a veiled reference to the hijacking of the Italian cruise liner Ac
hille Lauro and the killing of an elderly American passenger last
month, Arafat noted that recent incidents have had "adverse effects
on the Palestinian people's cause." But he said the PLO "condemns
all outside operations and all forms of terrorism and repeats once
more the commitment of all its institutions and factions to this deci
sion. "
Officials said the key lines in Arafat's pledge were the condemna
tion of "all outside operations" — meaning outside Israel — and of
attacks against civilians "in any place," including Israel.
Hostage Deaths Still Unverified
BEIRUT — An anonymous caller said Islamic Jihad extremists
planned to kill their half-dozen American hostages yesterday, and a
second caller claimed they were dead. But no bodies were found in
the designated spot.
The captives were to be "executed" by firing squad because indi
rect negotiations with the United States had reached "a dead end,"
the first man said in a call to a Western news agency.
In Washington, however, a White House official said "contacts" in
the Lebanon hostage case had not broken down. And President
Reagan said of the death threat, "Evidently there is no substantiation
of that at all."
Since the calls could not be authenticated, it was impossible to de
termine whether they were a macabre hoax or simply part of a war of
nerves being waged by the shadowy Shiite Moslem faction to pres
sure Washington into making a deal.
