## Columbian Troops Break Siege 
### 
BOGOTA, Colombia — In a bloody final as
sault, army and police forces crushed a guerrilla
commando group yesterday that seized the na
tional Palace of Justice and held scores of
hostages for more than 25 hours.
The president of the Supreme Court, six
other high court magistrates and an un
determined number of other civilians were
among at least 89 people killed in the spectacular
siege, military authorities said.
Most of the dead were said to be guerrillas of
the April 19 Movement including several of the
leftist guerrilla organization's top commanders.
Unconfirmed reports said that some of the guer
rillas committed suicide rather than surrender.
"The battle is over," Col. Alfonso Plazas, a
high Army commander declared. Other Army of
ficers said the death toll was 89.
Several guerrillas were captured before the
final assault. Officers emphasized that they
repeatedly promised not to harm the holdout
guerrillas if they surrendered, but that the guer
rillas answered with gunfire.
"They didn't want to give up," said Carlos

Martinez, president of the Colombian Red
Cross.
An Army lieutenant, a police lieutenant and
two policemen were killed. About 20 other
policemen and soldiers were wounded.
Several high court judges and other civilians
were also wounded. Two judges had not been
accounted for late yesterday.
The heavily armed guerrillas shot their way
into the Palace of Justice in the heart of Bogota
shortly before noon Wednesday. Security forces
counterattacked within minutes, laying siege to
the modern, four-story building.
As the battle progressed, the government
used armored cars with cannon and machine
guns, rockets, rocket-propelled grenades and
dynamite.
President Belisario Betancur's government
refused to negotiate with the rebels. "There can
be no negotiations with terrorism," a govern
ment minister said.
By early yesterday afternoon, security forces
had retaken most of the building and had rescued
more than 200 people who had been trapped or

held hostage inside. The guerrillas were holding
between 30 and 40 hostages on the building's
northern side.
Shortly after 2 p.m. government forces broke
into a stairwell where the guerrillas were con
centrated. An explosion rocked the building, and
heavy gunfire was heard outside for several
minutes.
By 2:30 p.m., security forces were evacuating
freed hostages. The evacuation of bodies began
later and continued until dark. Official reports
said more than 50 bodies were found on the
building's burned-out fourth floor, which was set
afire.
Among the bodies recovered was that of the
president of the Supreme Court, Alfonso Reyes,
and Judge Maria Ines Ramos of the Council of
State. The Palace of Justice is headquarters for
the Supreme Court and the Council of State,
Colombia's two highest courts.
Military officers said that guerrilla leader
Andres Almarales shot and killed Reyes and
Ramos when troops stormed the guerrilla's last
norket of resistance.
