# Record Flooding Soaks East Coast
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Potomac
River, swollen after days of rainfall,
surged over its banks in the Wash
ington area yesterday, flooding low
lying shopping and residential
areas, submerging parks and
causing police to close a major road
way into the city.
The churning, debris-laden
water, which crested during the
evening rush hour at 12 feet, was
the fifth-highest flood level on
record and the worst since Hur
ricane Agnes struck in 1972.
Nonetheless, the river peaked at
several feet less than had been
feared, and "things are going much
better than projected," said Samuel
Jordan, deputy director of the Dis
trict of Columbia Office of Emer
gency Preparedness.
Heavy flooding in the mid-

Atlantic states has killed 41 persons
so far, authorities reported. The
deluge caused extensive damage in
West Virginia. Parts of Virginia, in
cluding the capital of Richmond,
remained under 22 feet of water
yesterday.
Hundreds of National Guardsmen
patrolled 40 city blocks in Richmond
that were swamped by the muddy
James River, which spilled into a
newly renovated area of shops and
businesses.
In West Virginia, where many
towns had been cut off for at least a
day, new reports of devastation
surfaced, with as much as 75 per
cent of the homes or businesses in
some hamlets destroyed.
The water created only a mea
sure of havoc in Washington, lap
ping at several of the nation's most
(imoiis monuments Pnlirp HosspH

the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials
and the Washington Monument,
primarily as a precaution to keep
visitors away from the encroaching
water.
"We don't see any real danger to
the monuments," National Park
Service spokesman Sandra Alley
said. She noted, however, that
water was seeping onto the plaza at
the Jefferson Memorial and could
flood the building's basement.
At the Tidal Basin several blocks
from the White House, many of
Washington's famed cherry trees
were standing in 2 feet of water,
ana police were prepared to erect a
sandbag dike to protect nearby
areas.
In historic Alexandria, Va., shops
were flooded and boats ferried cus
tomers to one restaurant in the

city's Old Town neighborhood.
Across the Potomac, in the fas
hionable Georgetown neighborhood
of Washington, flooding forced
some businesses to place sandbags
around their buildings.
Donovan Kelly of the U.S.
Geological Survey predicted that
"about a half million tons of sedi
ment will move past Washington" as
the floodwaters move on toward
the Chesapeake Bay, adding that
the sediment could settle in ship
channels and threaten the bay's
oyster beds.
"We have a great bar business for
this time of the afternoon," said
John Pyburn, manager of Chad
wick's restaurant in Georgetown,
just yards from the Potomac.
"We're all watching the show up
here."
