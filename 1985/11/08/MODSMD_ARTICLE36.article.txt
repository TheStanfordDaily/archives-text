HHS Head Chosen
WASHINGTON — President Reagan
nominated yesterday former Indiana Gov. Otis
Bowen, described by friends as a country doc
tor with a "hoosier down-home sense of fair
ness," to succeed outgoing Secretary of
Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler.
Without a formal announcement, Reagan in
troduced his newest cabinet member in a brief,
low-key session before a blazing fireplace in
the Oval Office, saying simply, "This is a photo
opportunity with the newly designated secre
tary of Health and Human Services." Then he
added, "We're delighted he has accepted."
Reagan said he selected the 67-year-old
former family doctor, known as Doc Bowen,
"because of all the qualifications he has in
excess."
Bowen's appointment was praised by both
congressional Republicans and Democrats as
well as by Heckler. The Senate is expected to
act on his nomination in a few weeks.
Bowen served as Indiana's Republican
governor from 1973 to 1981. He served for a
time as coroner of Marshall County, Ind., and
maintained his family practice during the 14
years he served in the state Legislature, in
cluding four terms as House speaker. He is

currently professor of family medicine and
director of undergraduate family practice edu
cation at the Indiana University School of
Medicine.
SDI Contract Granted
WASHINGTON — The Lockheed Missiles
and Space Co. was selected by the Pentagon
yesterday to design a new generation of "anti
missile missiles" in one of the most significant
"Star Wars" contracts awarded to date.
The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based unit of the
Lockheed Corp. will serve as the prime con
tractor on what the Pentagon calls the ERIS
project — or Exoatmospheric Reentry-Vehicle
Interceptor Subsystem. The firm will soon en
ter negotiations leading to a five-year contract,
the Pentagon said.
Pentagon officials said they could not dis
cuss the possible value of the contract or what
other firms might be selected as subcontrac
tors in advance of those negotiations. The
project, however, has been described as offer
ing one of the most promising components of
the missile defense system envisioned under
President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initia
tive, informally known as Star Wars.

Boxer Released
NEW YORK — With a stinging rebuke to
the prosecution, a federal judge ruled yester
day that former boxer Rubin "Hurricane"
Carter's second conviction for triple murder
was the result of racial prejudice and he should
be released after almost 19 years in a New Jer
sey state prison.
At the time of his second trial, the case of
the former top contender for the world mid
dleweight title drew widespread noteriety.
Bob Dylan recorded a ballad of support titled
"Hurricane," celebrities including Muhammad
Ali helped raise $600,000 for a defense fund.
But after his second conviction, celebrity in
terest evaporated and Carter was left with the
lonely task of helping draft much of the legal
brief that brought about the favorable ruling.
Stock Market Slows
NEW YORK — The Dow Jones industrial
average dropped to 1,399.54 after climbing
6.77 on Wednesday to record high of 1,403.44.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
slowed to 118.95 million shares from 129.48
million the day before.
