Bathhouses Stay Open
LOS ANGELES — County health commis
sioners refused yesterday to endorse a pro
posed law that would close gay bathhouses
after a medical expert testified that shutting
down the bathhouses would not stop the
spread of AIDS.
Dr. Shirley Fannin, head of the com
municable diseases section of the county
health department, said frequenters of bath
houses "are the highest of high risk group in
our community, and as such are already very
highly infected" with AIDS.
Keeping such an already infected group
from bathhouses will not save them from AIDS
nor alter the habits that spread it, she warned.
"I believe that people who have compulsive,
sex-seeking behavior will not be reformed by
taking away ... the places. Because in fact
the compulsion will have them seek that activ
ity somewhere else," she said.

Her comments came during a hearing by the
Los Angeles County Health Commission or
dered by the Board of Supervisors, who want
to know if an emergency ordinance should be
enacted to shut down the bathhouses.
County Counsel DeWitt Clinton said his ini
tial study showed that existing laws may per
mit a health officer to shut down a gay bath
house if he believes the activity inside is
spreading a communicable disease.
A full report from the commission is due
Nov. 12. Yesterday's vote means the commis
sion will advise the supervisors to reject adapt
ing an ordinance to close bathhouses.
Duke Letter Ripped
SACRAMENTO — A GOF recruitment let
ter signed by Gov. George Deukmejian is
"shockingly lacking in candor," partly for failing
to acknowledge Deukmejian's opposition to

Proposition 13, the state Senate's leader said
yesterday.
The letter, which tries to lure Riverside
area Democrats to the Republican Party, con
demns "Democratic leaders" for opposing the
1978 tax-cutting initiative. But it fails to men
tion Deukmejian's position.
The Republican governor, then the state
Senate's GOP leader, backed a rival ballot
measure passed by the Legislature that would
have provided a smaller property tax cut than
the $7 billion slash made by Proposition 13.
The state Senate's leader, President Pro
Tem David Roberti, D-Los Angeles, said that
the letter was "shockingly lacking in candor"
and contained "vicious innuendoes."
"I have no quarrel with the governor at
tempting to convert Democrats to his party,"
Roberti said in a statement. "What concerns
me is his willingness in the letter to deceive
voters."
