### JOYA WESLEY Senior staff writer 
Stanford's 100 th birthday party moves into high gear
this weekend, with several events commemorating the
signing of the University's founding grant on Nov. 11,
1885.
At 4:30 p.m. Monday in Memorial Church, a con
vocation will mark the anniversary of the signing,
which was one of the key steps in establishing the Uni
versity.
The convocation will begin with a procession of more
than 200 faculty members, and University President
Donald Kennedy, Centennial Commission chairman
Eugene Webb, associate dean of the Graduate School
of Business, and Cornell University President Frank
Rhodes will speak. The convocation is free and open to
the public, but tickets must be secured in advance
from the Tresidder Union ticket office.
Special Centennial carillon concerts will ring out of
Hoover Tower before and after church services Sun
day and before the convocation Monday.
Just before the convocation, Fenner Douglass, visit
ing organist and music professor, will perform a free
Centennial organ concert in Memorial Church.
At 7:30 p.m. Monday in Tresidder's Oak Lounge,
Kennedy and Bob Beyers, director of Stanford News

and Publications Service, will speak at an ASSU
sponsored Centennial program on the history of stu
dent activism here.
Beginning today, the founding grant and other Cen
tennial artifacts will be on display at the Herbert
Hoover Memorial Exhibit Pavilion. The exhibit will be
open 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. except Sundays through Nov.
16.
Two documents — the enabling act and the founding
grant — were key to the establishment of Stanford.
The enabling act, which was signed on March 9, 1885
by then-Gov. George Stoneman, gave founders more
control over the destinies of their charitable and educa
tional institutions.
The founding grant, which Gov. Leland and Jane
Stanford signed eight months later, provided the Uni
versity's initial endowment, defined its scope, respon
sibilities and organization and named 24 trustees and
defined their duties.
The university thus formed was to be based on three
tracts of land — Gridley Farm, Vina Ranch and Palo
Alto Farm — and was to be a free, non-sectarian uni
versity open to all students regardless of social class or
sex.
Its goals were based upon the progressive view of
education the Stanfords had
admired at Cornell University.
Stanford eventually opened in
October 1891, with 465 students
and 15 faculty members. Large
celebrations of that anniversary in
1991 will be the culmination of the
University's Centennial.
