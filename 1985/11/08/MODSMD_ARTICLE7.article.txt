# Preparing for the Yearly Flood
## Six newcomers join the ranks of the admissions staff FEATURES 
### CHRIS MYERS Staff writer 
Cheri Ross has been an assistant director of
Admissions at Stanford for only a few months.
But Ross, who completed her Ph.D. in the
English Department this past June, already has a
strong sense of the importance and rewards of
her new job.
"I feel very fond of Stanford," Ross said.
"It's such a wonderful environment, and it's
neat to take that perspective out to other
people. Admissions really affects how the
campus looks, what Stanford will be like."
Ross is part of an influx of six new Admissions
directors, five of whom were previously Stan
ford students.
While each of the new directors brings a
markedly different background and perspective
to the job, they all share Ross' enthusiasm for
and commitment to Stanford and its admissions
process.
Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter, now in her
second year on the job, chose Ross and her five
fellow newcomers from an applicant pool of over
200.
Fetter seems to be thoroughly pleased with
her selections.
"I've never worked in a more incredibly

devoted, hard-working, committed office," Fet
ter said. "(The new directors) are all very differ
ent people, and I think that's important."
An Understanding of Values
The job description for the admissions posi
tions listed qualifications beginning with "an un
derstanding of the values of a liberal arts educa
tion. "
The directors who are former Stanford stu
dents undoubtedly furthered that understanding
during their years on the Farm.
Scott Allen and Kent Seymour graduated last
June, Allen with a B.A. in psychology, and
Seymour, a B.A. in history.
Mary Haynes collected her B.A. in communi
cations in 1983.
Jon Reider received bachelor's, master's and
doctoral degrees from Stanford before spending
the last 10 years co-founding, coordinating and
teaching in the Structured Liberal Education pro
gram.
The sixth new arrival is Associate Dean and
Director of Transfer Admissions Bill Tingley.
Tingley studied political science at UC-Davis,
and served as the Director of Admissions at

Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash, for the
last 14 years.
New People, New Challenge
Choosing next year's freshmen will be espe
cially challenging this year because of the rela
tive inexperience of the whole staff and because
of the anticipated number of applications. Ex
cluding John Bunnell, associate dean and director
of Undergraduate Admissions, the longest Stan
ford tenure of any of the current directors is
Marie Mookini's two years. The number of appli
cations, meanwhile, rose 13 percent between
January 1984 and January 1985, totaling 17,562
last year.
Fetter said that the inexperience of the staff
makes her job more challenging. And while she
said she agrees with Bunnell that "turnover isn't
necessarily bad at all," she is hoping to minimize
turnover and maintain a little more stability in the
staff of directors.
Unraveling the Turnover
Some turnover (ordinarily two or three direc-
tors each year) has come to be ex
pected. This turnover has been at
tributed, with no great certainty, to
several different factors.
"I don't think we can devise a
system such that we won't lose
some people," Bunnell said.
"Anytime you hire someone right
out of school, graduate school is a
consideration. Other people go
through one or two reading periods
and decide tha£ it's just not for
them. If you want to work with stu
dents on an everyday basis, this
isn't the job."
Last year's fallout of five direc
tors was somewhat unusual, but
largely coincidental, according to
the present staff members.
Assoc. Dean Parker Beverage,
for example, received an offer to
become the dean of admissions at
Colby College in Maine. Assoc.
Director Carol Bernstein took
maternity leave to have a baby and
decided she would move to college
counseling at a Los Angeles high
school. Two others, Keith Light
and Marty Everson, have gone on
to graduate school.
Fetter has already taken steps to
ease the strain of the job, and espe
cially of the reading period. She has
added two assistant directors to the
staff since she became dean, bring
ing the total to 11.
In addition, in an attempt to
"build some slack into the reading
period," the deadline for under
graduate applications has been
moved up two weeks to Dec. 16.
Fetter has also moved to invest
the new directors with more im
mediate responsibility in the office,
so that "they will have a sense of
professional development, rather
than viewing admissions as just a
transitional job."
Beware of Inbreeding
Fetter said she sees a lot of value
in the recent Stanford experiences

that most of the new directors have
had, but also finds Tingley's years
in admissions to be a big plus.
"The recent graduates can really
relate by an immediacy of experi
ence, but we don't want to be too
inbred," Fetter explained. "It's
helpful to have different
perspectives, and I've already
found Bill Tingley's experience
very valuable."
Keeping in Touch
For those new directors who had
been at Stanford in recent years,
much of the attraction of the admis
sions job was the chance to remain
in touch with the University.

"l really enjoyed my four years at
Stanford," said Haynes, who as a
senior won a Dean's Award for Ser
vice to the University.
"Admissions seemed like a way
to continue giving to the Univer
sity, but in an official capacity."
Reider said he has lost no love or
enthusiasm for teaching, but saw

admissions as an opportunity to be
"a little more centrally functioning
in the University, being in the heart
of it."
Several of the rookie directors
said they want to pursue careers in
education and look at admissions as
a beginning in that direction.
"I'm sure I'll be in education for a
long time," Allen said. "I was sure
that I wanted to work with stu
dents, get them interested in edu
cation and college. I wished some
one had gotten me to think about
college more."
Haynes, who worked for a Bay
Area cable TV company last year,
said she has an interest in educa-

tional administration. "Admissions
is a way to see if higher education is
what I really want to do," she said.
As for Tingley, a Bay Area
native, the opening at Stanford
"just seemed like the right position
at the right time."
"I had a very positive experience
at Whitman, but you reach a point

where you're looking for a fresh op
portunity," Tingley said.
Carrying a Heavy Load
The new directors came to the
Admissions Office with few illusions
about the nature of the job.
"Jean really warned us about the

work load," Reider said. "You're al
ways behind."
All the newcomers agree with
Haynes' estimation that the job "is
not nearly as glamorous" as the
public perceives it to be.
Travel is an example. During au
tumn quarter, each director must
make two "recruiting" trips to

various regions of the country.
Each trip typically lasts two weeks,
during which the director visits four
schools a day. Unfamiliar schools,
in unfamiliar cities.
"It's very exhausting," said Al
len, whose first trip was to his
home state of Georgia and adjacent
Southeastern states. "Occasionally,
you get to stay in the same hotel
two nights in a row."
"The travel is sometimes ag
gravating. You're in a rental car and
it's just you and the map and your
travel case," Haynes said.
"But the students make up for all
the traffic jams, when you see the
lightbulb go on in their heads," she
added.
For Reider, the recruiting trips
are an extension of his teaching ex
perience and appeal to the
"amateur sociologist" in him.
"There's a lot of teaching in
volved," he said. "There are a cer
tain number of things about Stan
ford that people would like to or
should know."
The Best of Both Worlds
Despite the rigors of the travel,
all the new directors are delighted
with the job so far.
"It's different from what I ex
pected," Ross said. "I love
representing Stanford. It's fun to
try to represent the school to
people in a short time."
"It's really the best of both
worlds," said Seymour, who played
on the varsity basketball team last
year. "You're on campus, but
you're also in the real world."
Words of an Elder Statesman
Bunnell, the elder statesman of
the Stanford Admissions Office, has
been through 22 reading periods
and lived to tell about it.
He compared the experience to
"a series of Dead Weeks and Finals
Weeks."

much of the attraction of the admis
sions job was the chance to remain
in touch with the University.

"l really enjoyed my four years at
Stanford," said Haynes, who as a
senior won a Dean's Award for Ser
vice to the University.
"Admissions seemed like a way
to continue giving to the Univer
sity, but in an official capacity."
Reider said he has lost no love or
enthusiasm for teaching, but saw

admissions as an opportunity to be
"a little more centrally functioning
in the University, being in the heart
of it."
Several of the rookie directors
said they want to pursue careers in
education and look at admissions as
a beginning in that direction.
"I'm sure I'll be in education for a
long time," Allen said. "I was sure
that I wanted to work with stu
dents, get them interested in edu
cation and college. I wished some
one had gotten me to think about
college more."
Haynes, who worked for a Bay
Area cable TV company last year,
said she has an interest in educa-

tional administration. "Admissions
is a way to see if higher education is
what I really want to do," she said.
As for Tingley, a Bay Area
native, the opening at Stanford
"just seemed like the right position
at the right time."
"I had a very positive experience
at Whitman, but you reach a point

where you're looking for a fresh op
portunity," Tingley said.
Carrying a Heavy Load
The new directors came to the
Admissions Office with few illusions
about the nature of the job.
"Jean really warned us about the

work load," Reider said. "You're al
ways behind."
All the newcomers agree with
Haynes' estimation that the job "is
not nearly as glamorous" as the
public perceives it to be.
Travel is an example. During au
tumn quarter, each director must
make two "recruiting" trips to

various regions of the country.
Each trip typically lasts two weeks,
during which the director visits four
schools a day. Unfamiliar schools,
in unfamiliar cities.
"It's very exhausting," said Al
len, whose first trip was to his
home state of Georgia and adjacent
Southeastern states. "Occasionally,
you get to stay in the same hotel
two nights in a row."
"The travel is sometimes ag
gravating. You're in a rental car and
it's just you and the map and your
travel case," Haynes said.
"But the students make up for all
the traffic jams, when you see the
lightbulb go on in their heads," she
added.
For Reider, the recruiting trips
are an extension of his teaching ex
perience and appeal to the
"amateur sociologist" in him.
"There's a lot of teaching in
volved," he said. "There are a cer
tain number of things about Stan
ford that people would like to or
should know."
The Best of Both Worlds
Despite the rigors of the travel,
all the new directors are delighted
with the job so far.
"It's different from what I ex
pected," Ross said. "I love
representing Stanford. It's fun to
try to represent the school to
people in a short time."
"It's really the best of both
worlds," said Seymour, who played
on the varsity basketball team last
year. "You're on campus, but
you're also in the real world."
Words of an Elder Statesman
Bunnell, the elder statesman of
the Stanford Admissions Office, has
been through 22 reading periods
and lived to tell about it.
He compared the experience to
"a series of Dead Weeks and Finals
Weeks."

Cheri Ross has been an assistant director of
Admissions at Stanford for only a few months.
But Ross, who completed her Ph.D. in the
English Department this past June, already has a
strong sense of the importance and rewards of
her new job.
"I feel very fond of Stanford," Ross said.
"It's such a wonderful environment, and it's
neat to take that perspective out to other
people. Admissions really affects how the
campus looks, what Stanford will be like."
Ross is part of an influx of six new Admissions
directors, five of whom were previously Stan
ford students.
While each of the new directors brings a
markedly different background and perspective
to the job, they all share Ross' enthusiasm for
and commitment to Stanford and its admissions
process.
Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter, now in her
second year on the job, chose Ross and her five
fellow newcomers from an applicant pool of over
200.
Fetter seems to be thoroughly pleased with
her selections.
"I've never worked in a more incredibly

devoted, hard-working, committed office," Fet
ter said. "(The new directors) are all very differ
ent people, and I think that's important."
An Understanding of Values
The job description for the admissions posi
tions listed qualifications beginning with "an un
derstanding of the values of a liberal arts educa
tion. "
The directors who are former Stanford stu
dents undoubtedly furthered that understanding
during their years on the Farm.
Scott Allen and Kent Seymour graduated last
June, Allen with a B.A. in psychology, and
Seymour, a B.A. in history.
Mary Haynes collected her B.A. in communi
cations in 1983.
Jon Reider received bachelor's, master's and
doctoral degrees from Stanford before spending
the last 10 years co-founding, coordinating and
teaching in the Structured Liberal Education pro
gram.
The sixth new arrival is Associate Dean and
Director of Transfer Admissions Bill Tingley.
Tingley studied political science at UC-Davis,
and served as the Director of Admissions at

Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash, for the
last 14 years.
New People, New Challenge
Choosing next year's freshmen will be espe
cially challenging this year because of the rela
tive inexperience of the whole staff and because
of the anticipated number of applications. Ex
cluding John Bunnell, associate dean and director
of Undergraduate Admissions, the longest Stan
ford tenure of any of the current directors is
Marie Mookini's two years. The number of appli
cations, meanwhile, rose 13 percent between
January 1984 and January 1985, totaling 17,562
last year.
Fetter said that the inexperience of the staff
makes her job more challenging. And while she
said she agrees with Bunnell that "turnover isn't
necessarily bad at all," she is hoping to minimize
turnover and maintain a little more stability in the
staff of directors.
Unraveling the Turnover
Some turnover (ordinarily two or three direc-
tors each year) has come to be ex
pected. This turnover has been at
tributed, with no great certainty, to
several different factors.
"I don't think we can devise a
system such that we won't lose
some people," Bunnell said.
"Anytime you hire someone right
out of school, graduate school is a
consideration. Other people go
through one or two reading periods
and decide tha£ it's just not for
them. If you want to work with stu
dents on an everyday basis, this
isn't the job."
Last year's fallout of five direc
tors was somewhat unusual, but
largely coincidental, according to
the present staff members.
Assoc. Dean Parker Beverage,
for example, received an offer to
become the dean of admissions at
Colby College in Maine. Assoc.
Director Carol Bernstein took
maternity leave to have a baby and
decided she would move to college
counseling at a Los Angeles high
school. Two others, Keith Light
and Marty Everson, have gone on
to graduate school.
Fetter has already taken steps to
ease the strain of the job, and espe
cially of the reading period. She has
added two assistant directors to the
staff since she became dean, bring
ing the total to 11.
In addition, in an attempt to
"build some slack into the reading
period," the deadline for under
graduate applications has been
moved up two weeks to Dec. 16.
Fetter has also moved to invest
the new directors with more im
mediate responsibility in the office,
so that "they will have a sense of
professional development, rather
than viewing admissions as just a
transitional job."
Beware of Inbreeding
Fetter said she sees a lot of value
in the recent Stanford experiences

that most of the new directors have
had, but also finds Tingley's years
in admissions to be a big plus.
"The recent graduates can really
relate by an immediacy of experi
ence, but we don't want to be too
inbred," Fetter explained. "It's
helpful to have different
perspectives, and I've already
found Bill Tingley's experience
very valuable."

For those new directors who had
been at Stanford in recent years,
much of the attraction of the admis
sions job was the chance to remain

Mary Haynes collected her B.A. in communi
cations in 1983.
Jon Reider received bachelor's, master's and
doctoral degrees from Stanford before spending
the last 10 years co-founding, coordinating and
teaching in the Structured Liberal Education pro
gram.
The sixth new arrival is Associate Dean and
Director of Transfer Admissions Bill Tingley.
Tingley studied political science at UC-Davis,
and served as the Director of Admissions at

Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash, for the
last 14 years.
New People, New Challenge
Choosing next year's freshmen will be espe
cially challenging this year because of the rela
tive inexperience of the whole staff and because
of the anticipated number of applications. Ex
cluding John Bunnell, associate dean and director
of Undergraduate Admissions, the longest Stan
ford tenure of any of the current directors is
Marie Mookini's two years. The number of appli
cations, meanwhile, rose 13 percent between
January 1984 and January 1985, totaling 17,562
last year.
Fetter said that the inexperience of the staff
makes her job more challenging. And while she
said she agrees with Bunnell that "turnover isn't
necessarily bad at all," she is hoping to minimize
turnover and maintain a little more stability in the
staff of directors.
Unraveling the Turnover
Some turnover (ordinarily two or three direc-
tors each year) has come to be ex
pected. This turnover has been at
tributed, with no great certainty, to
several different factors.
"I don't think we can devise a
system such that we won't lose
some people," Bunnell said.
"Anytime you hire someone right
out of school, graduate school is a
consideration. Other people go
through one or two reading periods
and decide tha£ it's just not for
them. If you want to work with stu
dents on an everyday basis, this
isn't the job."
Last year's fallout of five direc
tors was somewhat unusual, but
largely coincidental, according to
the present staff members.
Assoc. Dean Parker Beverage,
for example, received an offer to
become the dean of admissions at
Colby College in Maine. Assoc.
Director Carol Bernstein took
maternity leave to have a baby and
decided she would move to college
counseling at a Los Angeles high
school. Two others, Keith Light
and Marty Everson, have gone on
to graduate school.
Fetter has already taken steps to
ease the strain of the job, and espe
cially of the reading period. She has
added two assistant directors to the
staff since she became dean, bring
ing the total to 11.
In addition, in an attempt to
"build some slack into the reading
period," the deadline for under
graduate applications has been
moved up two weeks to Dec. 16.
Fetter has also moved to invest
the new directors with more im
mediate responsibility in the office,
so that "they will have a sense of
professional development, rather
than viewing admissions as just a
transitional job."
Beware of Inbreeding
Fetter said she sees a lot of value
in the recent Stanford experiences

that most of the new directors have
had, but also finds Tingley's years
in admissions to be a big plus.
"The recent graduates can really
relate by an immediacy of experi
ence, but we don't want to be too
inbred," Fetter explained. "It's
helpful to have different
perspectives, and I've already
found Bill Tingley's experience
very valuable."
Keeping in Touch
For those new directors who had
been at Stanford in recent years,
much of the attraction of the admis
sions job was the chance to remain
in touch with the University.

"l really enjoyed my four years at
Stanford," said Haynes, who as a
senior won a Dean's Award for Ser
vice to the University.
"Admissions seemed like a way
to continue giving to the Univer
sity, but in an official capacity."
Reider said he has lost no love or
enthusiasm for teaching, but saw

admissions as an opportunity to be
"a little more centrally functioning
in the University, being in the heart
of it."
Several of the rookie directors
said they want to pursue careers in
education and look at admissions as
a beginning in that direction.
"I'm sure I'll be in education for a
long time," Allen said. "I was sure
that I wanted to work with stu
dents, get them interested in edu
cation and college. I wished some
one had gotten me to think about
college more."
Haynes, who worked for a Bay
Area cable TV company last year,
said she has an interest in educa-

tional administration. "Admissions
is a way to see if higher education is
what I really want to do," she said.
As for Tingley, a Bay Area
native, the opening at Stanford
"just seemed like the right position
at the right time."
"I had a very positive experience
at Whitman, but you reach a point

where you're looking for a fresh op
portunity," Tingley said.
Carrying a Heavy Load
The new directors came to the
Admissions Office with few illusions
about the nature of the job.
"Jean really warned us about the

work load," Reider said. "You're al
ways behind."
All the newcomers agree with
Haynes' estimation that the job "is
not nearly as glamorous" as the
public perceives it to be.
Travel is an example. During au
tumn quarter, each director must
make two "recruiting" trips to

various regions of the country.
Each trip typically lasts two weeks,
during which the director visits four
schools a day. Unfamiliar schools,
in unfamiliar cities.
"It's very exhausting," said Al
len, whose first trip was to his
home state of Georgia and adjacent
Southeastern states. "Occasionally,
you get to stay in the same hotel
two nights in a row."
"The travel is sometimes ag
gravating. You're in a rental car and
it's just you and the map and your
travel case," Haynes said.
"But the students make up for all
the traffic jams, when you see the
lightbulb go on in their heads," she
added.
For Reider, the recruiting trips
are an extension of his teaching ex
perience and appeal to the
"amateur sociologist" in him.
"There's a lot of teaching in
volved," he said. "There are a cer
tain number of things about Stan
ford that people would like to or
should know."
The Best of Both Worlds
Despite the rigors of the travel,
all the new directors are delighted
with the job so far.
"It's different from what I ex
pected," Ross said. "I love
representing Stanford. It's fun to
try to represent the school to
people in a short time."
"It's really the best of both
worlds," said Seymour, who played
on the varsity basketball team last
year. "You're on campus, but
you're also in the real world."
Words of an Elder Statesman
Bunnell, the elder statesman of
the Stanford Admissions Office, has
been through 22 reading periods
and lived to tell about it.
He compared the experience to
"a series of Dead Weeks and Finals
Weeks."
