# Preparing for the Yearly Flood
## Six newcomers join the ranks of the admissions staff FEATURES 
### CHRIS MYERS Staff writer 
Cheri Ross has been an assistant director of
Admissions at Stanford for only a few months.
But Ross, who completed her Ph.D. in the
English Department this past June, already has a
strong sense of the importance and rewards of
her new job.
"I feel very fond of Stanford," Ross said.
"It's such a wonderful environment, and it's
neat to take that perspective out to other
people. Admissions really affects how the
campus looks, what Stanford will be like."
Ross is part of an influx of six new Admissions
directors, five of whom were previously Stan
ford students.
While each of the new directors brings a
markedly different background and perspective
to the job, they all share Ross' enthusiasm for
and commitment to Stanford and its admissions
process.
Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter, now in her
second year on the job, chose Ross and her five
fellow newcomers from an applicant pool of over
200.
Fetter seems to be thoroughly pleased with
her selections.
"I've never worked in a more incredibly

devoted, hard-working, committed office," Fet
ter said. "(The new directors) are all very differ
ent people, and I think that's important."
An Understanding of Values
The job description for the admissions posi
tions listed qualifications beginning with "an un
derstanding of the values of a liberal arts educa
tion. "
The directors who are former Stanford stu
dents undoubtedly furthered that understanding
during their years on the Farm.
Scott Allen and Kent Seymour graduated last
June, Allen with a B.A. in psychology, and
Seymour, a B.A. in history.
Mary Haynes collected her B.A. in communi
cations in 1983.
Jon Reider received bachelor's, master's and
doctoral degrees from Stanford before spending
the last 10 years co-founding, coordinating and
teaching in the Structured Liberal Education pro
gram.
The sixth new arrival is Associate Dean and
Director of Transfer Admissions Bill Tingley.
Tingley studied political science at UC-Davis,
and served as the Director of Admissions at

Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash, for the
last 14 years.
New People, New Challenge
Choosing next year's freshmen will be espe
cially challenging this year because of the rela
tive inexperience of the whole staff and because
of the anticipated number of applications. Ex
cluding John Bunnell, associate dean and director
of Undergraduate Admissions, the longest Stan
ford tenure of any of the current directors is
Marie Mookini's two years. The number of appli
cations, meanwhile, rose 13 percent between
January 1984 and January 1985, totaling 17,562
last year.
Fetter said that the inexperience of the staff
makes her job more challenging. And while she
said she agrees with Bunnell that "turnover isn't
necessarily bad at all," she is hoping to minimize
turnover and maintain a little more stability in the
staff of directors.
Unraveling the Turnover
Some turnover (ordinarily two or three direc-
