# Strip-Search Use In Question
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
Charges of brutality brought against the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Office by Stanford senior
Robby Perkins have also raised questions over the
appropriateness of the decision to strip-search him
at North County Jail.
Perkins, who has said he will sue the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Office over the alleged beating,
was arrested after participating in an anti-apartheid
protest at Old Union on Oct. 11.
In a report requested by University President
Donald Kennedy and released Monday, Law Prof.
John Kaplan writes, "unnecessary force may well
have been used on Perkins in the strip cell. . . but I
am simply unable to second his conclusions with any
degree of confidence based on the evidence. ..."
According to Law Prof. Barbara Babcock, the
decision to strip-search a prisoner depends upon the
crime for which he was arrested and whether the
prisoner will be placed with other prisoners.
According to Deputy Scott Camada, the Santa
Clara County Sheriffs Office strip-searches a pris
oner who is arrested on a drug-related charge, viol
ent crime or felony, or who is suspected of conceal
ing a weapon or contraband.
Sergeant Kirts, one of three deputies on duty in
the jail, decided to strip-search Perkins.
In the Kaplan report, Kirts is quoted as saying, "I

noticed he was wearing pins holding a red ribbon on
his shirt, and some sort of pin-on button on his
shorts. I asked him to give them to me, but he
refused. I then told him that if he would not, I would
strip-search to obtain them, as well as any thing else
he might have not authorized in this facility."
According to Perkins, Kirts never explained to
him that the concern over the pins was that they
could be used as weapons.
Kaplan questioned whether it is standard policy
for the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office to strip
search a person who violates Section 148 of the Cal
ifornia Penal Code, resisting and impeding arrest.
Charges against Perkins include a violation of that
law.
Kaplan wrote, "I have been told, though I am
unable to verify it, that the County Sheriff s policy is
that those arrested for violations of Section 148 be
strip-searched."
There is disagreement over the existence of this
rule among the members of the sheriff s office. "I'm
not sure if an average (violation of) 148 falls under
strip-search," Camada said.
But, according to Lt. Fine, assistant detention di
vision commander, a prisoner can definitely be strip
seached if he continues to violate Section 148 at the
jail. "If he is acting in a 148 mode, then we will have
to strip-search," he said. Fine would not give his
first name.
Perkins was "less cooperative" than any of the
other arrestees, Kaplan wrote.
