## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Pretoria's Crackdown 
### 
When white settlers began moving into the inte
rior of South Africa in the mid-1800s, they fre
quently encountered violent resistance from black
tribes in the areas.
When these settlers, known as Boers, halted for
the night or felt an attack was imminent, they would
position their ox-drawn wagons into a tight circle.
This laager, as it was called, provided a limited mea
sure of protection for families and their possessions.
Now South Africans are again circling their wag
ons. The South African government announced Sat
urday that all television crews, photographers and
radio reporters would be barred from areas under
the four-month-old state of emergency decree.
Print journalists are prohibited from covering unrest
without police permission or a police escort. Now
the wagons are not to provide shelter from violence,
but to hide the violence from the eyes and ears of
foreigners.
The Pretoria government claims the measure is
intended to limit violence instigated by journalists.
"The presence of television and other camera crews
in unrest situations," said Louis LeGrange, the min
ister of Law and Order, ". . . proved to be a catalyst
to further violence." Some South African
newspapers have recently accused television teams
of paying blacks to burn books or repeat stone
throwing incidents in front of cameras.

Despite these allegations, which to date are un
substantiated, the move by the South African gov
ernment seems to be one of desperation.
Rather than focusing its attention on the underly
ing racial problems that have caused more than 800
deaths in little more than a year, the Pretoria gov
ernment is simply trying to remove deaths from the
world's television screens.
Rather than meeting with leaders of the African
National Congress, the Pretoria government ap
pears to prefer setting up a laager around the
country, hiding riots and muffling the cries of those
flayed by shotguns.
In parliamentary elections held three days before
the imposition of the new press restrictions, South
Africa President Pieter Botha's National Party won
four of five seats, sustaining its nearly absolute con
trol of the government. Botha seemed encouraged
by the results, and his response sounded good:
"There is no one in this country, or anywhere else,
who appreciates the urgency for reform better than
the members of this government of South Africa,"
he said.
But reform is not something to hide from the rest
of the world. If Botha truly believes in reform, why
did he pull the country into a modern-day laager de
signed to impede the free conveyance of ideas?
