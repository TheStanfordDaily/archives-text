# Band Favorite Mickelson Substituted
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
of the bombast used by serious
band announcers like USC's.
The Band members have a spe
cial affection for Mickelson, whom
they have affectionately dubbed
"Fat Man."
"He's an inspirational leader and
an adviser we can turn to," Band
Manager Scott Gode says of the Fat
Man. "He's a lot of fun and he really
makes people glad to be in the
Band."
"He enjoys making people laugh
and just feel good," says Dollie
Arija Bareikis.
Mickelson has mixed feelings
about phasing himself out of the
Band.
"I have an indecent amount of fun
being Band announcer," he says.
"It ought to be against the law."
But he insists that the Band
needs new blood, and he is deter
mined to do what he thinks is best
for it.
"The Band staff would be
tempted to let me overstay my use
fulness out of personal loyalties. I'd
like to talk them out of that."
"But I'm around forever to help
out," he adds.
One of Mickelson's reasons for
wanting a replacement is his fear
that he is losing the poetic gift.
"I worry a little bit about not
being as funny as I used to be," he
says. "I sometimes doubt whether I
was ever funny at all."
Gode is quick to discard this no
tion. "Hal's humor and his approach
to shows has definitely not soured

The voice of the Stanford Band
won't be heard today.
And if he has his way, Hal Mickel
son won't be heard much in the
future, either.
"The Band needs to be trying
new things," says Mickelson, a 35-
year-old attorney for Hewlett-
Packard who began announcing
Band shows as a Stanford junior in
1969.
"The Band needs to keep on
trying to top itself, like any other
entertainment medium. It might be
more entertaining and funnier if we
got new involvement in the announ
cer's part of the show."
Mickelson's replacement today is
senior John Nisbet, a Band member
with experience in drama and public
speaking. Nisbet was chosen to an
nounce the Oregon State show
after Mickelson asked the Band
staff to find a one-game substitute.
Mickelson calls himself a team
player an "aging designated hit
ter" who is willing to sit out if he
feels it's best for the Band.
"I don't want to become a
parasite," he says. "I don't want to
take more out than I put in."
Mickelson has become an institu
tion at Stanford, announcing Band
shows at each football game with an
unmistakable voice, unbelievable
vocabulary and unparalled humor.
He describes his style as a parody

over the years," he says.
Piccolo player Sue Greim
describes the pre-game pep talk
that Mickelson on occasion delivers
to the Band. "He talks off the top of
his head.-He tells hilarious stories."
Mickelson is the key to "making
the shows funny for the audience,"
explains Bareikis. "When we're
SMUTing (planning the upcoming
week's show), we'll always say,
'Hal could make this so funny'. . . .
He's hysterical."
Gode may not want to retire the
voice of the Band, but he sees
Mickelson's point of view.
"There's always a feeling that the
Band is first and foremost for the
students, and maybe the announcer
for the Band should be someone
more in the student range."
Gode emphasizes, though, that
he loves Mickelson's style and
doesn't want to replace him perma
nently.
Mickelson has an equal amount of
respect for the Band's unique style.
"You won't induce students to
have a military-style marching band
at Stanford," he says, adding that
Harvard, Yale and Princeton stu
dents would be no more likely to
field a marching band.
Asked whether there is an in
verse relation between high SAT
scores and the ability to march in a
straight line, Mickelson chuckles,
then responds.
"At the Rose Bowl parade, I've
noticed that the other bands march
straight through everything the

horses leave behind. I've always
wondered whether this type of self
discipline is something to be proud
of."
Mickelson's respect for the Band
extends to the staff, whom he
praises, and the Dollies, whom he
adores.
"If there's one thing that's per
fect, it is the [Dollies]," he says.

"The main thing the Dollies contrib
ute is that they celebrate the
Band's music. It requires an im
mense amount of energy and talent.
The fact that they are attractive
just enhances that performance."
Physical beauty is an important
quality for all performers, he ex
plains.
"Unless you're an announcer."

"But I'm around forever to help
out," he adds.
One of Mickelson's reasons for
wanting a replacement is his fear
that he is losing the poetic gift.
"I worry a little bit about not
being as funny as I used to be," he
says. "I sometimes doubt whether I
was ever funny at all."

The voice of the Stanford Band
won't be heard today.
And if he has his way, Hal Mickel
son won't be heard much in the
future, either.
"The Band needs to be trying
new things," says Mickelson, a 35-
year-old attorney for Hewlett-
Packard who began announcing
Band shows as a Stanford junior in
1969.
"The Band needs to keep on
trying to top itself, like any other
entertainment medium. It might be
more entertaining and funnier if we
got new involvement in the announ
cer's part of the show."
Mickelson's replacement today is
senior John Nisbet, a Band member
with experience in drama and public
speaking. Nisbet was chosen to an
nounce the Oregon State show
after Mickelson asked the Band
staff to find a one-game substitute.
Mickelson calls himself a team
player an "aging designated hit
ter" who is willing to sit out if he
feels it's best for the Band.
"I don't want to become a
parasite," he says. "I don't want to
take more out than I put in."
Mickelson has become an institu
tion at Stanford, announcing Band
shows at each football game with an
unmistakable voice, unbelievable
vocabulary and unparalled humor.
He describes his style as a parody

over the years," he says.
Piccolo player Sue Greim
describes the pre-game pep talk
that Mickelson on occasion delivers
to the Band. "He talks off the top of
his head.-He tells hilarious stories."
Mickelson is the key to "making
the shows funny for the audience,"
explains Bareikis. "When we're
SMUTing (planning the upcoming
week's show), we'll always say,
'Hal could make this so funny'. . . .
He's hysterical."
Gode may not want to retire the
voice of the Band, but he sees
Mickelson's point of view.
"There's always a feeling that the
Band is first and foremost for the
students, and maybe the announcer
for the Band should be someone
more in the student range."
Gode emphasizes, though, that
he loves Mickelson's style and
doesn't want to replace him perma
nently.
Mickelson has an equal amount of
respect for the Band's unique style.
"You won't induce students to
have a military-style marching band
at Stanford," he says, adding that
Harvard, Yale and Princeton stu
dents would be no more likely to
field a marching band.
Asked whether there is an in
verse relation between high SAT
scores and the ability to march in a
straight line, Mickelson chuckles,
then responds.
"At the Rose Bowl parade, I've
noticed that the other bands march
straight through everything the

horses leave behind. I've always
wondered whether this type of self
discipline is something to be proud
of."
Mickelson's respect for the Band
extends to the staff, whom he
praises, and the Dollies, whom he
adores.
"If there's one thing that's per
fect, it is the [Dollies]," he says.

"The main thing the Dollies contrib
ute is that they celebrate the
Band's music. It requires an im
mense amount of energy and talent.
The fact that they are attractive
just enhances that performance."
Physical beauty is an important
quality for all performers, he ex
plains.
"Unless you're an announcer."

the public address chores.
of the bombast used by serious
band announcers like USC's.
The Band members have a spe
cial affection for Mickelson, whom
they have affectionately dubbed
"Fat Man."
"He's an inspirational leader and
an adviser we can turn to," Band
Manager Scott Gode says of the Fat
Man. "He's a lot of fun and he really
makes people glad to be in the
Band."
"He enjoys making people laugh
and just feel good," says Dollie
Arija Bareikis.
Mickelson has mixed feelings
about phasing himself out of the
Band.
"I have an indecent amount of fun
being Band announcer," he says.
"It ought to be against the law."
But he insists that the Band
needs new blood, and he is deter
mined to do what he thinks is best
for it.
