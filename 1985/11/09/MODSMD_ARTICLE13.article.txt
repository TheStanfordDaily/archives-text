Bynum, a first-team All Pac-10
selection last season, is well on his
way to similiar honors this year,
leading the Beavers with 48 catches
for 584 yards and seven touch
downs. Bynum is currently 10
catches behind Stanford's Ken Mar
gerum for fifth-place on the all
time Pac-10 receiving list. If he
finishes his career with three big
games, he could reach as high as
third.

Entering today's game, the Bea
vers' 19 interceptions lead the Pac
-10 with Northington claiming six of
the total take. Northington faces
the Cardinal's deep-threat wide
receiver Jeff James, who leads the
Pac-10 in average yardage per
catch at 16.6.

On a pass-oriented team,
Malone's 433 yards rushing and 4.3
average are even more impressive
than they look. Malone can catch,
too. His 25 receptions are second
on the team. Gilmete, second on
the team in tackles with 92, should
have his hands, hopefully, full.

Usually when one thinks of de
fensive linemen, images of
refrigerators, small trucks and
mobile homes come to mind. So
when one reads 223 pounds for a
defensive end, a misprint is a fair
assumption. Not so with Todd, who
was the hero in the upset of Wash
ington with his fourth quarter
blocked punt. Luckily, Marchin is
healthy again, for he wouldn't want
to miss the opportunity to face
someone 30 pounds his junior.

Hey you, catch! The timing between Cardinal wide receiver Jeff James and quarterback John Paye has
been consistent all season, accounting for 30 completions. James' 16.6-yard average per catch leads the
conference.
