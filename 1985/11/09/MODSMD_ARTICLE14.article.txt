### ERIK ESELIUS Editorial staff 
After blowing a 28-point lead
against Washington State the
previous week, Stanford entered
the Oregon State game with the
reputation of doing, or undoing,
anything.
Against the Beavers, the
Cardinal experimented with an
innovative approach fold first,
accomplish later. It worked.
The Cardinal worked its strat
egy to perfection by fumbling
away the opening kickoff. The
Beavers graciously accepted the
gift and converted the turnover
into a 7-0 early lead.
On Oregon State's second
possession of the game, Beaver
quarterback Steve Steenwyk
culminated a five-minute drive
with a one-yard plunge to make
it 14-0.
Still in the first quarter, the
Beavers were lured once more
by the conniving Cardinal when
Oregon State tight end Duane
Stan grabbed a Steenwyk pass to
stretch the lead to 21-0.
Once the initial period ended,
Stanford was ready for the
Washington State ploy the
return from nowhere comeback.

After a Mark Harmon field
goal got the Cardinal on the
scoreboard, Stanford fullback
Brad Muster, who rushed for
137 yards for the afternoon,
scored the Cardinal's first touch
down, scampering in from three
yards out.
The comeback continued its
course when Oregon State
fumbled away a Cardinal punt,
setting up a first-and-10 at the
Beaver 13-yard line. Moments
later, the score became 21-17 on
a Fred Buckley one-yard sneak.
The first half scoring finished at
21-20 on another Mark Harmon
field goal.
The second half played to
more of a defensive theme. En
tering the fourth quarter with
Stanford still trailing by one,
Cardinal outside linebacker Mike
Noble nailed elusive Beaver
quarterback Ricky Greene in
the end zone for a safety.
The bereaving Beavers, con
founded by the turn of events,
relinquished one more Stanford
score to bring the final count to
28-21.
Stanford staved off Oregon
State's last ditch hopes with an
Eric Price interception in the end
zone to seal the Cardinal victory.
