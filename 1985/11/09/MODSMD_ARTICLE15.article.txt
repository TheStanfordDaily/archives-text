# Band To Preview Superpower Summit
## 
### 
It is a Saturday, and we are gath
ered here for a game. But despite
these facts, we will learn many
things about the world outside this
modern-day gladiatorial coliseum.
You all know about the up-and
coming summit meeting between
"us" and "them," don't you? Let's
take a look at the Geneva meeting.
Well, certainly the MX will be
brought up in the mountains. This
time It's Real! NO skirting the topic
now, boys. Let's save the talk
about LASERs for LATER. I don't
want to be Blinded by Science so
early on in this historic meeting.
Show some humanity and put
those Bombs A-Way! There are
certain things more important than
Strategic Defense Initiatives. Birth
control for one. Forget SDIs and
the Evil Ways that lurk about them.
Let's hear something about lUDs, a
much more humane defensive im
plant.
After all, boys, earth is ours for
keeps. She doesn't have an uncon
ditional guarantee. She's already A
Small World. Let's not make her
into a radioactive dirt clod.
At this point in time, a

retrospective of technology may be
called for.
Once, the great pyramids were
the only "silos" on earth. They
were harmless unless a hapless
tourist fell off an observation plat
form. The platforms were removed
during the 13th dynasty.
Firewords brought us an exciting
way to Light Up the sky for
celebrations. One step closer to
rockets and missiles.
Now there are computers
everywhere. Hey, Big Brother was
only a fictional character. Maybe we
should believe in him after all, with
all the talk of "Star Wars." Perhaps
in the future we will have a Death
Star a Master Blaster.
