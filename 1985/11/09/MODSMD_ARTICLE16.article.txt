# Is This Really the Pac-10 Game of the Week?
## TV probation for USC, Arizona puts game under the lights 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
While only a relatively few die-hard Card
inal fans are expected to come to Stanford
Stadium for today's game against Oregon
State, football fans from across the nation will
have the privilege of viewing the game on af
filiated stations of the Turner Broadcast Sys
tem (WTBS).
Privilege is probably too euphemistic.
Punishment might be a more appropriate
word. The Beavers, 3-5 overall, and the
Cardinal, 2-6, are considered to be also-rans
in the Pacific 10 Conference and have been
mere punching bags in most of their games
this season.
So why would people around the nation be
interested in this game? And better yet, why
would WTBS pick it as its Game of the Week?
'We're trying to push it as a battle of giant
killers," WTBS Program Coordinator John
Vandegrift said.
Vandegrift was referring to a pair of major
upsets OSU's 21-20 victory over Washing
ton on Oct. 19 and Stanford's 28-17 defeat of
Pac-10 leader Arizona on Oct. 26.
Another attraction, according to Van
degrift, is Cardinal quarterback John Paye.
'We figured it would be a good game to
televise with John Paye and the great tradi
tion of Stanford quarterbacks," he said.
While Vandegrift appears enthusiastic
about today's telecast, he and WTBS actually
are trying to do their best to sell a rather in
significant game. They are making the most
of the situation, considering the circum
stances.
Those circumstances include the fact that
the OSU-Stanford game was one of the last
games they considered broadcasting.
Each week, WTBS covers a college foot
ball game in a broadcast called Super Football
Saturday Night. The network chooses from
games in the Atlantic Coast, Big 10 and Pac
-10 conferences, as well as from major inde
pendent games.
Because of its new contract with the Pac
-10 schools, WTBS is obligated to televise five
Pac-10 games this season. According to Van
degrift, the network needed to cover a Pac
-10 matchup this week.
'We try to work out with the conference
what weekend is good," he said. "And it's our
time to show a Pac-10 game."

There are two outstanding Pac-10 games
today UCLA at Arizona and Washington at
Arizona State. All four of these teams have
one conference loss each and are involved in
a tremendous battle for the Rose Bowl bid.
So why did WTBS select the OSU-Stanford
game over both of these contests?
"To be honest with you, we wanted the
Washington-Arizona State game," Vandegrift
indicated. "But CBS decided to cover it."
WTBS could not pursue the UCLA-Arizona
game because of provisions in Arizona's
NCAA probation which stipulate that the
Wildcats cannot be televised this season.
Similarly, the USC-California game could not
be covered because of the Trojans' NCAA
probation.
Since neither Oregon nor Washington State
is involved in Pac-10 action today, WTBS
really had no choice with regards to which
game to broadcast. It was either OSU-
Stanford or nothing.
Vandegrift was not overly concerned that
the lack of quality teams might reduce the
number of viewers. "It's like anything else,"
he said. 'We have an SEC (Southeastern
Conference) game every week and we count
on Southern viewers. For this game we're
going to have to rely on viewers west of the
Rockies."
WTBS' decision to televise the OSU-
Stanford game has met with mixed reactions
at Stanford. The major complaint is that the
game's starting time has been moved from 1
to 5:10 p.m. in order to accommodate WTBS.
"I'm not crazy about it, but I'm certainly
going to cooperate," Stanford Athletic Direc
tor Andy Geiger said. Geiger indicated that
"attendance will certainly drop" as a result of
the switching of the starting time. He esti
mated an attendance of 30,000 today as
opposed to the Cardinal's 1985 average of
56,000.
Vandegrift explained that the 5:10 p.m.
game time is employed because it is the best
time for all of Turner's affiliates. "It's prime
time football," he said.
While the Stanford Athletic Department
and the ticket-holders may not be overjoyed
by the WTBS broadcast and its complications,
at least one player is pleased.
"Personally, I'm excited about this," said
Cardinal tight end Greg Baty, a native of
Sparta, N.J. "All my relatives back east can
watch me play."

Today's game will be the first official night contest in the history of Stanford Stadium.
Two others, last year's USC-Stanford game and Super Bowl XIX, started during the
day but finished in the dark. A crowd of 30,000 is expected to be on hand for this historic
evening.
