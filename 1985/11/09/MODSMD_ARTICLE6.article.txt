# Stanford, OSU Battle for Respectability
## 2-6 Cardinal looks to catch 3-5 Beavers in Pac-10 race 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
Two months ago, if one were to have told a
Cardinal supporter that Stanford would have
a worse record, both overall and in the Pacific
10 Conference, than Oregon State after eight
games, what would his reaction have been?
"Cancel my season ticket," would have
been a possibility.
"Ivy League, here we come," would also
have had potential.
Undoubtedly, however, the most probable
response would have been, "And how many
quarters' tuition would you like to bet on
that?"
But it's November, and the Beavers are 3-
5. Their 2-3 Pac-10 mark currently has them
in seventh place, which is two or three spots
higher than they have been accustomed to in
the past few seasons.
In his first eight games, first-year OSU
Coach Dave Kragthorpe has already posted
half as many victories as his predecessor, Joe
Avezzano, earned in 55 contests.
'We've made a lot of progress in this pro
gram," Kragthorpe said. 'We feel pretty
confident with the things we've done. We'd
like to win more football games, but we know
where we started from. It (the program) was
certainly as low as it could get. That is sub
stantiated by the won-lost record (6-47-2
during the Avezzano years)."
The Beavers began the season with back
to-back victories over Idaho and California,
but then reality set in. 'We did get off to a
great start with enthusiasm for a new pro
gram and a new coach," Kragthorpe said.
"Then things caught up with us, and we had
(quarterback Erik) Wilhelm's injury."

The loss of Wilhelm, a promising freshman,
to a knee injury against Grambling grounded
the Beavers' "Air Express" offense. "If you
lose the cog of the wheel, it affects the whole
team," Kragthorpe said.
Without the cog, the wheel totally fell apart
during the next two weeks the Beavers
were shut out twice, 63-0 by USC and 34-0
by Washington State. The next game figured
to be another blow-out, this time at the hands
of Washington in Seattle.
But, in one of the biggest upsets in recent
Pac-10 history, the 37-point underdog
Beavers pulled off a shocking 21-20 win over
the Huskies. Another freshman quarterback,
Rich Gonzales, threw for 298 yards, but it
took a Lavance Northington touchdown
recovery of a punt blocked by Andre Todd
with 1:46 left to pull it out for OSU.
"I can't believe that I'm sitting talking
about losing this game," Washington quarter
back Hugh Millen said.
The loss may have humbled Millen, but it
was positively embarassing for the Seattle
media, who had been ridiculing the Beavers
all week. One columnist wrote that OSU
played football the way Barney Fife played
deputy. A television station ran an old film of
bumbling players in leather helmets and
pretended it was of the Beavers.
"They were attacking our manhood," Nor
thington told Sports Illustrated.
Probably the only team as upset about the
game as Washington was Stanford the
Huskies' next opponent. To make matters
worse for the Cardinal, the Huskies had a bye
the week before their game, giving them
some extra time to think about, read about
and hear about the OSU loss.
Washington then did to Stanford what it
should have done to OSU, crushing the Card

inal 34-0. Stanford was simply manhandled in
every phase of the game. "That was a total
victory for Washington," Stanford Coach Jack
Elway said. "It was gradual, and it wasn't a
blow-out. But it was steady."
According to Elway, the OSU game was
definitely a factor in the Huskies' perfor
mance. "It's obvious that their team played
with a tremendous amount of emotion after a
big defeat," he said. "They played with emo
tion plus execution on defense and gave their
offense many scoring opportunities."
Reserve quarterback Greg Ennis com
pleted 7-of-12 passes in relief of John
Paye, who was replaced in order to avoid the
risk of further injury to his separated right
shoulder. "We were coming off a big high,
beating Arizona (28-17), and Washington was
really fired up," Ennis said.
If Stanford is to be sucessful today, it will
have to find away to get tight end Greg Baty
back into the Cardinal offense. Baty entered
last week's contest averaging 6.6 catches per
game. But, using a strong pass rush on Paye
and tough man-to-man coverage on Baty, the
Huskies held the 6-foot-6 tight end to one
catch for three yards.
"They took a lot of our shorter pass routes
away (with man-to-man)," Baty said. 'We
went to the longer routes, but on those it
takes time to get open, to set the guy up. "
Elway believes that Baty will get similar
defensive treatment today. "He's the guy
that's been catching the football," Elway said.
"I would anticipate that's what will happen
this week."
But Baty isn't so sure. "After seeing film of
the Washington game, they probably don't
think too much of me."
Don't count on it. Although he was shut

down last week, Baty is still third in the Pac
-10 and eighth in the nation with 47 recep
tions.
Even with his statistics, Baty is not the
leading receiver on his own team. That honor
belongs to fullback Brad Muster, who is ready
to go again after missing at least parts of the
past five games with a bruised sternum.
Muster's 49 catches lead the Pac-10 and are
second in the nation.
The Cardinal has two other receivers
among the conference elite. Fullback Brian
Morris is tied for fifth with 36 receptions, and
wide receiver Jeff James has snared 30 more
passes, tied for eighth in the Pac-10.
With so many Stanford receivers piling up
so many catches, one would expect that the
Cardinal's quarterback isn't doing too badly
either. And he isn't. Despite his recent injury
problems, Paye is still the conference leader
in passing and total offense.
"Stanford is better than its record would
indicate," Kragthorpe said. "They're explo
sive offensively and have a lot of talent. Paye
is one of the premier athletes in the league.
We'll have to be at our very best to play with
Stanford."
If the Cardinal is at its very best, it should
handle the Beavers. But Stanford has just
finished the toughest part of its schedule, and
the Big Game with Cal is still two weeks
away. A letdown is a possible danger.
Should the Cardinal suffer a letdown today,
the Big Game could be a battle for ninth place
in the Pac-10. But Baty doesn't see it hap
pening. "There's no way," he said. "If we
were 8-0 or 6-2, maybe we might have to
worry. There's no way you can have a let
down when you're scrapping to save a
respectable season."

Cardinal linebacker Matt Soderlund (47) staves off a block in route to one of his teamleading

5. Their 2-3 Pac-10 mark currently has them
in seventh place, which is two or three spots
higher than they have been accustomed to in
the past few seasons.
In his first eight games, first-year OSU
Coach Dave Kragthorpe has already posted
half as many victories as his predecessor, Joe
Avezzano, earned in 55 contests.
'We've made a lot of progress in this pro
gram," Kragthorpe said. 'We feel pretty
confident with the things we've done. We'd
like to win more football games, but we know
where we started from. It (the program) was
certainly as low as it could get. That is sub
stantiated by the won-lost record (6-47-2
during the Avezzano years)."
The Beavers began the season with back
to-back victories over Idaho and California,
but then reality set in. 'We did get off to a
great start with enthusiasm for a new pro
gram and a new coach," Kragthorpe said.
"Then things caught up with us, and we had
(quarterback Erik) Wilhelm's injury."

The loss of Wilhelm, a promising freshman,
to a knee injury against Grambling grounded
the Beavers' "Air Express" offense. "If you
lose the cog of the wheel, it affects the whole
team," Kragthorpe said.
Without the cog, the wheel totally fell apart
during the next two weeks the Beavers
were shut out twice, 63-0 by USC and 34-0
by Washington State. The next game figured
to be another blow-out, this time at the hands
of Washington in Seattle.
But, in one of the biggest upsets in recent
Pac-10 history, the 37-point underdog
Beavers pulled off a shocking 21-20 win over
the Huskies. Another freshman quarterback,
Rich Gonzales, threw for 298 yards, but it
took a Lavance Northington touchdown
recovery of a punt blocked by Andre Todd
with 1:46 left to pull it out for OSU.
"I can't believe that I'm sitting talking
about losing this game," Washington quarter
back Hugh Millen said.
The loss may have humbled Millen, but it
was positively embarassing for the Seattle
media, who had been ridiculing the Beavers
all week. One columnist wrote that OSU
played football the way Barney Fife played
deputy. A television station ran an old film of
bumbling players in leather helmets and
pretended it was of the Beavers.
"They were attacking our manhood," Nor
thington told Sports Illustrated.
Probably the only team as upset about the
game as Washington was Stanford the
Huskies' next opponent. To make matters
worse for the Cardinal, the Huskies had a bye
the week before their game, giving them
some extra time to think about, read about
and hear about the OSU loss.
Washington then did to Stanford what it
should have done to OSU, crushing the Card

inal 34-0. Stanford was simply manhandled in
every phase of the game. "That was a total
victory for Washington," Stanford Coach Jack
Elway said. "It was gradual, and it wasn't a
blow-out. But it was steady."
According to Elway, the OSU game was
definitely a factor in the Huskies' perfor
mance. "It's obvious that their team played
with a tremendous amount of emotion after a
big defeat," he said. "They played with emo
tion plus execution on defense and gave their
offense many scoring opportunities."
Reserve quarterback Greg Ennis com
pleted 7-of-12 passes in relief of John
Paye, who was replaced in order to avoid the
risk of further injury to his separated right
shoulder. "We were coming off a big high,
beating Arizona (28-17), and Washington was
really fired up," Ennis said.
If Stanford is to be sucessful today, it will
have to find away to get tight end Greg Baty
back into the Cardinal offense. Baty entered
last week's contest averaging 6.6 catches per
game. But, using a strong pass rush on Paye
and tough man-to-man coverage on Baty, the
Huskies held the 6-foot-6 tight end to one
catch for three yards.
"They took a lot of our shorter pass routes
away (with man-to-man)," Baty said. 'We
went to the longer routes, but on those it
takes time to get open, to set the guy up. "
Elway believes that Baty will get similar
defensive treatment today. "He's the guy
that's been catching the football," Elway said.
"I would anticipate that's what will happen
this week."
But Baty isn't so sure. "After seeing film of
the Washington game, they probably don't
think too much of me."
Don't count on it. Although he was shut

down last week, Baty is still third in the Pac
-10 and eighth in the nation with 47 recep
tions.
Even with his statistics, Baty is not the
leading receiver on his own team. That honor
belongs to fullback Brad Muster, who is ready
to go again after missing at least parts of the
past five games with a bruised sternum.
Muster's 49 catches lead the Pac-10 and are
second in the nation.
The Cardinal has two other receivers
among the conference elite. Fullback Brian
Morris is tied for fifth with 36 receptions, and
wide receiver Jeff James has snared 30 more
passes, tied for eighth in the Pac-10.
With so many Stanford receivers piling up
so many catches, one would expect that the
Cardinal's quarterback isn't doing too badly
either. And he isn't. Despite his recent injury
problems, Paye is still the conference leader
in passing and total offense.
"Stanford is better than its record would
indicate," Kragthorpe said. "They're explo
sive offensively and have a lot of talent. Paye
is one of the premier athletes in the league.
We'll have to be at our very best to play with
Stanford."
If the Cardinal is at its very best, it should
handle the Beavers. But Stanford has just
finished the toughest part of its schedule, and
the Big Game with Cal is still two weeks
away. A letdown is a possible danger.
Should the Cardinal suffer a letdown today,
the Big Game could be a battle for ninth place
in the Pac-10. But Baty doesn't see it hap
pening. "There's no way," he said. "If we
were 8-0 or 6-2, maybe we might have to
worry. There's no way you can have a let
down when you're scrapping to save a
respectable season."

Cardinal linebacker Matt Soderlund (47) staves off a block in route to one of his teamleading
95 tackles. Soderlund has been the main force of the defense in the '85 season,
but fellow linebacker Jack Gilmete has asserted himself as well, with 35 tackles in the
last two games.
Two months ago, if one were to have told a
Cardinal supporter that Stanford would have
a worse record, both overall and in the Pacific
10 Conference, than Oregon State after eight
games, what would his reaction have been?
"Cancel my season ticket," would have
been a possibility.
"Ivy League, here we come," would also
have had potential.
Undoubtedly, however, the most probable
response would have been, "And how many
quarters' tuition would you like to bet on
that?"
