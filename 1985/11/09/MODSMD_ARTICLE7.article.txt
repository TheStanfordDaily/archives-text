# Bynum Brings Big Plays To Oregon State Attack
## 
### TOM GILLESPIE Staff writer 
While performing for a football program that gener
ally doesn't attract much attention outside of the
Northwest, Reggie Bynum has turned a lot of heads
during his career.
The Oregon State senior flanker has impressed fans
and scouts alike with his his ability to make the big
play, and his consistent productivity in 1984 was
recognized with a selection to the All-Pacific 10 first
team.
Coming out of high school, Bynum's potential to be a
college-level receiver was not apparent to everyone.
Though fairly highly-recruited, he eventually settled on
Oregon State over San Jose State, San Diego State and
Washington State because it was the only school that
wanted him as a receiver rather than as a defensive
back.
Bynum has more than justified OSU's faith in his abil
ities as a receiver. As a freshman in 1982, he was
fourth on the team in receiving and was named Out
standing Offensive Freshman on the Beavers.
By 1983, he was one of the main cogs in the Oregon
State offense. Bynum led the team in receiving, dis
playing his knack for the big play by leading the Pac-10
in touchdown receptions with seven and yards
per catch with a 24.2 average. He was named to the
All Pac-10 Second Team after his sophomore year.
In 1984, Bynum had a remarkable season. Playing
on a team that prefered to run, he hauled in 51 passes
for 711 yards to lead the Pac-10 in both categories. In
addition to his conference honors, he was also named
honorable mention All-America.
"It was definitely the highlight of my college career
to be named All Pac-10," Bynum said. "Just to be
playing in the Pac-10 is an honor, but it makes it all
worthwhile when someone notices your play."
Bynum's senior year has been an interesting one.
Among other changes, Oregon State has a new coach
this year in Dave Kragthorpe, who, much to Bynum's
pleasure, installed a pass-oriented offense upon his ar
rival.
"Coach Kragthorpe has maximized our talents.
We're making up for a lack of size with a game that em
phasizes finesse, and there's a much more confident
feeling on the team this year," Bynum said.
In addition to having to adjust to a new coach,
Bynum has been catching passes from a pair of fresh
man quarterbacks, first from Erik Wilhelm and then
from Rich Gonzales after Wilhelm was injured. The ad
justment, according to Bynum, has not been all that dif
ficult.

"They're both excellent athletes, and throw the ball
well. It was tough to have to switch in midseason, but
Gonzales has been doing the job. I'm sure he'll only get
better as the season goes on."
Despite these adjustments, as well as some nagging
health problems, Bynum has had an outstanding senior
year. In the Arizona game last week, he became
Oregon State's all-time leading receiver with 136
career catches, and he has a reasonable shot to move
as high as fifth on the all-time Pac-10 receiving list.
He is currently second in the Pac-10 in both catches
and yardage with 48 and 584, respectively. He also
leads all conference receivers with seven touchdown
receptions, and his average of 6.9 catches per game
rank him fifth nationally.
All of these statistics were compiled while being the
"man to stop" in the Oregon State offense. Bynum has
frequently faced defenses that were designed specific
ally to stop him. Today's game may not be any differ
ent.
"I wouldn't say our defense is specifically keying on
Bynum. Let's just say we have a great 'awareness' of
him on the field," said Stanford cornerback Toi Cook.
"We know that if it comes down to a key situation,
they'll probably be going to him because he's very
much of a big play man. All around, he's an excellent
receiver who likes to burn you long, and you've got to
give him a great deal of respect."
Today will be a homecoming of sorts for Bynum. A
San Jose native, he will have his last opportunity to
perform as a collegian in front of his family and ex-high
school teammates. "It's always fun to come back to the
Bay Area. Since this may be my last game in front of
the home folks for a while, I'd really like to have a big
day."
As for his post-collegiate career, Bynum plans to
test the professional ranks. "To be able to play in the
National Football League would be a very special op
portunity. I have no particular preferences about
where I'd be playing, and I really don't know where I'd
be taken in the draft, but I'm definitely looking forward
to giving it a shot."
In his four years at Oregon State, Bynum has been a
consistently outstanding performer, operating in an
area of the country that brings him little recognition.
With more Pac-10 and possibly All-America honors
waiting for him at the end of the season, Bynum has
done more than his share in trying to turn the OSU
football program around.
"More than anything else, I'd like to go out on a win
ning note. I feel like our program is finally beginning to
gain respect, and it would be nice to know that I was a
part of the rebuilding process. With Coach Kragthorpe
here and the new feeling on the team, I think OSU
football has a great future."

In 1984, Bynum had a remarkable season. Playing
on a team that prefered to run, he hauled in 51 passes
for 711 yards to lead the Pac-10 in both categories. In
addition to his conference honors, he was also named
honorable mention All-America.
"It was definitely the highlight of my college career
to be named All Pac-10," Bynum said. "Just to be
playing in the Pac-10 is an honor, but it makes it all
worthwhile when someone notices your play."
Bynum's senior year has been an interesting one.
Among other changes, Oregon State has a new coach
this year in Dave Kragthorpe, who, much to Bynum's
pleasure, installed a pass-oriented offense upon his ar
rival.
"Coach Kragthorpe has maximized our talents.
We're making up for a lack of size with a game that em
phasizes finesse, and there's a much more confident
feeling on the team this year," Bynum said.
In addition to having to adjust to a new coach,
Bynum has been catching passes from a pair of fresh
man quarterbacks, first from Erik Wilhelm and then
from Rich Gonzales after Wilhelm was injured. The ad
justment, according to Bynum, has not been all that dif
ficult.

"They're both excellent athletes, and throw the ball
well. It was tough to have to switch in midseason, but
Gonzales has been doing the job. I'm sure he'll only get
better as the season goes on."
Despite these adjustments, as well as some nagging
health problems, Bynum has had an outstanding senior
year. In the Arizona game last week, he became
Oregon State's all-time leading receiver with 136
career catches, and he has a reasonable shot to move
as high as fifth on the all-time Pac-10 receiving list.
He is currently second in the Pac-10 in both catches
and yardage with 48 and 584, respectively. He also
leads all conference receivers with seven touchdown
receptions, and his average of 6.9 catches per game
rank him fifth nationally.
All of these statistics were compiled while being the
"man to stop" in the Oregon State offense. Bynum has
frequently faced defenses that were designed specific
ally to stop him. Today's game may not be any differ
ent.
"I wouldn't say our defense is specifically keying on
Bynum. Let's just say we have a great 'awareness' of
him on the field," said Stanford cornerback Toi Cook.
"We know that if it comes down to a key situation,
they'll probably be going to him because he's very
much of a big play man. All around, he's an excellent
receiver who likes to burn you long, and you've got to
give him a great deal of respect."
Today will be a homecoming of sorts for Bynum. A
San Jose native, he will have his last opportunity to
perform as a collegian in front of his family and ex-high
school teammates. "It's always fun to come back to the
Bay Area. Since this may be my last game in front of
the home folks for a while, I'd really like to have a big
day."
As for his post-collegiate career, Bynum plans to
test the professional ranks. "To be able to play in the
National Football League would be a very special op
portunity. I have no particular preferences about
where I'd be playing, and I really don't know where I'd
be taken in the draft, but I'm definitely looking forward
to giving it a shot."
In his four years at Oregon State, Bynum has been a
consistently outstanding performer, operating in an
area of the country that brings him little recognition.
With more Pac-10 and possibly All-America honors
waiting for him at the end of the season, Bynum has
done more than his share in trying to turn the OSU
football program around.
"More than anything else, I'd like to go out on a win
ning note. I feel like our program is finally beginning to
gain respect, and it would be nice to know that I was a
part of the rebuilding process. With Coach Kragthorpe
here and the new feeling on the team, I think OSU
football has a great future."

Formerly one of the best kept secrets in college football, Reggie
Bynum has finally begun to receive the recognition he deserves. In
1984, Bynum was a first-team All Pac-10 selection and may be
headed for All-America honors this season.

All around, he's an excellent receiver who likes to burn you long, and
you've got to give him a great deal of respect," Stanford cornerback
Toi Cook said of Reggie Bynum. Cook and his teammates in the Cardinal
secondary have faced their share of excellent receivers this
season and should be ready for Bynum.
While performing for a football program that gener
ally doesn't attract much attention outside of the
Northwest, Reggie Bynum has turned a lot of heads
during his career.
The Oregon State senior flanker has impressed fans
and scouts alike with his his ability to make the big
play, and his consistent productivity in 1984 was
recognized with a selection to the All-Pacific 10 first
team.
Coming out of high school, Bynum's potential to be a
college-level receiver was not apparent to everyone.
Though fairly highly-recruited, he eventually settled on
Oregon State over San Jose State, San Diego State and
Washington State because it was the only school that
wanted him as a receiver rather than as a defensive
back.
Bynum has more than justified OSU's faith in his abil
ities as a receiver. As a freshman in 1982, he was
fourth on the team in receiving and was named Out
standing Offensive Freshman on the Beavers.
By 1983, he was one of the main cogs in the Oregon
State offense. Bynum led the team in receiving, dis
playing his knack for the big play by leading the Pac-10
in touchdown receptions with seven and yards
per catch with a 24.2 average. He was named to the
All Pac-10 Second Team after his sophomore year.
In 1984, Bynum had a remarkable season. Playing
on a team that prefered to run, he hauled in 51 passes
