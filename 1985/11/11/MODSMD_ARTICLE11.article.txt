## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Trimming the Senate 
### 
The ASSU Council of Presidents' proposal to dis
band the current ASSU Senate and construct a
smaller legislative body is designed to focus the stu
dent government on its real goal: meeting the needs
of the student community.
COP member Mike Collins has said that the cur
rent senate has "too many people, too little repre
sentation" and a "diaphanous sense of what it should
do."
The role of the senator is not well defined and a
sense of accountability is minimal, according to
some senators.
In addition, "senators now see themselves as
protectors of (ASSU) resources. Students coming
to them have to prove their worth," COP member
Tim Quirk has said, adding that the ASSU should be
the "humble servant of the students."
The COP's proposal is a viable attempt at cor
recting such problems in the senate system and re
alizing the goal of an effective student government.
The size of the proposed legislative body would

be half that of the current senate, increasing individ
ual accountability; each member would be elected
for specific jobs, giving senators responsibilities that
are better defined than they are now; voters would
select only one candidate instead of 10, increasing
the chances that a voter would know his representa
tive in the ASSU.
Undergraduate Senator Ed Renwick has ex
pressed a concern that shrinking the size of the sen
ate would also shrink the number of creative ideas
produced by the ASSU. Although this may be a
legitimate point, it seems minor. Creative ideas
should come from the entire student body, not just
the ASSU.
"We're not electing people to be creative," Collins
said, adding that the senate is not very creative now
despite its large size. "Any elective body should
serve to assist creative people get things done."
Having a smaller senate should weed out the
bureaucrats, leaving the effective senators to do
their jobs: using ASSU resources to serve the stu
dents.
