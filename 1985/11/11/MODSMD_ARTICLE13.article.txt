## Kaplan Report Proves Unsatisfying 
### 
The administration has finally
released the Kaplan report, after
several delays. Now that we, the
members of Stanford Out of South
Africa, have read the report, and
after a meeting between University
President Donald Kennedy and the
nine arrestees on Monday, Nov. 4,
we can only decry Kaplan's work as
a whitewash.

VIEWPOINT

The report was meant to be ob
jective; it fails even this most basic
requirement. It was questionable
enough that Law Prof. John Kaplan
stated in public that he was doing
the report as a "personal favor" to
Kennedy, but even more out
rageous are the glowing tes
timonials to Police Chief Marvin
Herrington in the report. Kaplan
writes: "I have worked with Marvin
Herrington on a number of occa
sions â€” and enjoyed his protection
on one or two. I have the highest
regard for him and think that Stan
ford is lucky, indeed very lucky, to
have him." Statements such as

these severely undermine, to say
the least, Kaplan's claim to be ob
jective.
The report is incomplete in its
findings, and it ignores the con
tradictions between police accounts
of what happened at Old Union on
Oct. 11 and visual evidence to the
contrary. In their reports, police of
ficers claimed that senior Robby
Perkins put up a great struggle
during his arrest, and that in partic
ular he grabbed the wrists of the of
ficers holding him. But videotapes
of the arrest show nothing of the
sort. The tapes show police using a
wristhold on Perkins, who is clearly
in pain. And yet nowhere in his fin
dings does Kaplan question the
credibility of the police reports.
Furthermore, there is no men
tion in Kaplan's report of police ad
ministering pain to students with
the sole intent of causing pain. But
a Daily photograph, never pub
lished, shows a police officer apply
ing a nerve pinch to Perkins' neck,
while Perkins was already hand
cuffed and sitting in a police van.
Then there is the matter of what

happened to Perkins in the
North County Jail. Kaplan states
that Perkins entered the jail without
any bruises, and left with bruises
which corroborate his claim of being
beaten. Stanford police admit that
they were present with Perkins
while he was in jail, nothing more;
Kaplan lets the matter go at that.
He does not request that any dis
ciplinary actions be taken against
these officers, and he does not
even call for a more detailed inves
tigation of the affair.
The report seems to be an apol
ogy for police actions. Kaplan never
makes any decisions. The few con
clusions he does reach are couched
in vague, imprecise terms designed
to offend no one. The only time
Kaplan does make a judgement is
when he admits that pain infliction is
"wrong and unjustifiable" as a police
procedure. And yet, the police
force is never once reprimanded,
never held accountable for its stra
tegic use of brutality.
On Monday, Nov. 4, the presi
dent finally met with the nine arres
tees about the Kaplan report. Little

was accomplished at this meeting.
The arrestees were not given
copies of the report until they met
with Kennedy, despite the fact that
they repeatedly asked to see the
report beforehand. During the
meeting, Kennedy's standard
response to the arrestees' com
ments and questions was, "You
haven't read the report." Surely the
absurdity of the situation is, ob
vious.
The Kaplan report is an extreme
disappointment. Its objectivity is
dubious, it is incomplete and it
comes to no real conclusions. Ac
cording to this document, no one
needs to be punished and there is
no problem. The administration
considers the case closed: in his
meeting with the arrestees, Ken
nedy would not even look at the
photograph of police applying the
nerve pinch to a handcuffed
Perkins. Does the University really
expect us to be satisfied with the
Kaplan report?
