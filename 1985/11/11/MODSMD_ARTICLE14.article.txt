# 'Star Wars' Insures Against Annihilation
## 
### 
I'm just a regular human and, like most
people, I would like to continue living. But I have
to live with the fear that at any moment I, every
one else, and every place on earth may cease to
exist. Put plainly, I fear dying in a nuclear war or
in an equally hideous nuclear winter. In my
column of Oct. 14, I went as far as to say we
should take half of the money spent on nuclear
bombs and put it into public works. But realisti
cally, our government will never do that, at least
not in the foreseeable future. So as a survival
conscious human, I must try to avoid death by
backing the policies I see as most able to keep
me alive. That is why I back the Strategic
Defense Initiative.
"Star Wars" is a lofty idea. President Reagan
expresses the "dream" when he says he wants
to remove the fear of total destruction from the
American people. But the opponents of SDI use
the term "dream" to discredit it. They have
many arguments why the system would not be
practical and would not save anyone from
destruction.
I would like to introduce first, the concept of
"Death Potential." Death Potential (DP) is the
sum of total destructive power posessed by the
two superpowers that would actually reach its
targeted destinations and detonate. For exam
ple, if we owned 10 units of destruction (a unit of
destruction is the amount of warheads needed to
destroy the Soviet Union), and the Soviet Union
also owned 10, and there was no way of stopping
warheads from reaching their targets (SDI,
knocking out missiles before they launch, etc.),
the DP would be 20 (10+10).
For the majority of American citizens, any DP
past one is irrelevant. But for the rest of the
world the story is different. Let's say, for exam
ple, that the threshold of life-extinguishing nu
clear winter occurs at a DP of 16. If we were to
build a laser defense system that was only 50
percent effective, we would stop five of their
destruction units, lower the DP to 15 and thus
avoid total human extinction through nuclear
winter. Isn't it moral for a system that could
enable life to go on, even if that life isn't neces
sarily our own?
People argue that SDI will cost too much and
will be just an expansion of the military. This is
why I say that with implementation of such a sys
tem we must have financial responsiblity. A cut
back in spending on other forms of the military

must be coupled with the building of S6l. This
will not only offset some of the cost of SDI, but
will also help in lowering the important Death
Potential. For example, if the Soviet Union still
has 10 destructions but we cut back to six
destructions with four units of laser defense, our
six destructions reach their destination, but two
of theirs are stopped by our four units of 50 per
cent effective defense. The Death Potential is
now at 14, down from 20 in the defenseless
scenario.
Another argument against SDI is that such a
system would be destabilizing to the world situa
tion, and lead to an escalation of the arms race.
Common sense says that the Soviets will react
with countermeasures. But as I see it, the
Soviets would have three options, none of which
would threaten my survival. Their options would
be to build a defense system of their own, to
build more missiles to saturate our defense or to

create weapons to attack the satellites in our
system.
I would welcome a counter-laser system built
by the Soviets. If they were to build one equal to
ours, then the numbers in the last scenario
would change to sue destructions launched by
each side, four of which would make it to target,
resulting in a Death Potential of only eight.
The Soviet Union could react by building more
missiles. But they must think that such a system
would be effective; why else would they be so
alarmed at our wanting to install it. And if the
Soviets do think it would be effective, then build
ing missiles might seem somewhat useless be
cause our system could destroy them.
It seems a more plausible decision for the
Soviets would be to build a system of their own
or build weapons to shoot down our satellites
rather than gambling on the effectiveness of our
system. And the Soviet Union is using its mili
tary to shoot down satellites is preferable to
them shooting at me.

Another advantage to having a defense sys
tem is that if a single missile was launched at us
by a terrorist group or a nation such as Libya, or
misfired by a soldier in a Soviet silo (or an Ameri
can in an American silo, for that matter), there
would be a chance to stop it before a major dis
aster occurred, which might in turn lead to all
out nuclear war. The days when the United
States and the Soviets were the only ones to
have nuclear arsenals are over. Many nations
now are becoming able to have arsenals. We
can't be certain that these nations will be as re
sponsible in the handling of nuclear weapons as
we and the Soviet Union are. A defense system
would provide some hope of guarding against a
terrorist attack or a mistaken launch.
Yet another thing to consider is that in the
event that a nuclear war was starting, the firing
on defense satellites would be the only logical
first move, in order to insure a maximum num
ber of missiles reaching their target. This would
increase the time it took to start a nuclear war.
As it stands now, if the Soviet Union were to
launch its missiles, President Reagan would have
about 10 minutes to decide what to do. With a
defense, the Soviet's first move would be to hit
satellites — their missiles would not be launched
yet. Another decision to actually fire missiles
would have to be made. Also, we would be
alerted to the Soviet Union's actions but would
not have to make an immediate decision as to
whether to launch our own.
Maybe, just maybe, someone on either side
would have the sense to stop, before it would be
too late. True, this may only extend the
decision-making process by half an hour, but that
amount of time could be the difference between
life and death.
Finally, it must be remembered that a defense
system, like nuclear weapons, is for deterrance
— never to be used. The strength of the system
is not how many missiles it can shoot down, but
how many the Soviet Union thinks it can shoot
down, and how many less missiles we need to
maintain since we have a system. The object of
the game is to never have war at all, but if one
were to happen, at least SDI leaves a chance for
some life to continue. As things stand now, if
there is a nuclear war everyone on this planet is
dead.
