Public Service
Good Experience
One of the noblest things a per
son can do is to give of themselves
to help the disadvantaged. No one,
conservative or liberal, will deny
that generously giving one's time is
worthwhile and rewarding. Nor
would anyone deny that there are
many situations in our own country
and abroad that cry out for our
help.
Stanford students give
generously of their time, doing
everything from donating their
blood to repairing playgrounds, but
only while we can. Most of us have
specific career goals that preclude
anything but diligent, sustained
effort as soon as we graduate.
Most of us have already accum
ulated large debts either to parents
or lending institutions that will
become due a short time after we
leave school. The question isn't
whether or not Stanford students
want to perform public service of
some sort, rather it's whether we
can afford it.
One of University President
Donald Kennedy's projects has
been to promote public service
among Stanford students. There is
a multitude of resources available
to anyone who wants to become
involved. However, to an engineer
who has endured academic torture
for four years, the prospect of get
ting minimal wages working with
the poor is almost inconceivable.
Other disciplines have the same
problem. We've worked hard, now
it's time to get some of the
rewards of our labor. Besides that,
what about the $24,000 I owe to
the bank?
The student who thinks there is

no option but working is wrong.
The skills learned at a university
may not be directly applicable to
renovating housing for poverty
level families or helping to provide
food and medical care to the el
derly poor, but while the equations
won't help, the perseverence,
tenacity and analytical skills we've
learned would be utilized to the
utmost. • •
A university education is ideally
meant to teach a person how to
learn, not necessarily to develop a
marketable skill. The learning and
organizational skills that every
Stanford student has are adequate
for any type of public service, and
those skills would certainly be
used.
Financial obligations are another
matter. Most banks won't accept
anything but cash; idealism and ,
human compassion don't go very
far. Something that Stanford has
failed to do is to provide some sort
of financial help to people who are
involved in public service.
If the University is truly inter
ested in promoting public service,
a loan re-financing program would
go a long way toward helping take
some of the pressure for quick
repayment away from students.
Perhaps some of the hundreds of
millions being spent on building
new labs and offices could be
diverted to a fund designed to float
long-term, low-interest loans to
graduates working in low-paying
public service jobs.
Few people feel a calling for
public service, but as Jacob Holdt's
presentation of poverty in America
shows, there is as much need here
for service as there is anywhere
else in the world.
