# Seniors Petition To Request Gorbachev at Commencement
## 
### INGRID WICKELGREN 
In an attempt to persuade the Univer
sity to ask Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev to be the 1986 commencement
speaker, three Roble resident assistants
are circulating a petition among the senior
class to support the nomination.
So far, over 200 signatures have been
collected, according to Mark Fleischauer,
one of the three RAs who started the peti
tion.
There also seemed to be "a good deal

of student interest at Pub Night," one of
the places where the petition was passed
around, said Steve Smith, a senior class
president. Smith is also one of two stu
dents on the Commencement Panel,
which is responsible for making the final
recommendation for the commencement
speaker.
In the petition, the three RAs state
their belief that "a gesture of this kind will
display this University's commitment to
the peaceful coexistence of the United
States and the Soviet Union on all fron
tiers," Fleischauer said.

"Even though we don't know how real
istic it is that Gorbachev would actually
come, we believe that the University
should send a message that it recognizes
the possibility of improved relations be
tween the two countries, and is willing to
promote them," he added.
Gaining the support of the senior class
is only the first step in getting Gorbachev
selected as commencement speaker.
The opinion of the senior class is
represented by the two students on the
Commencement Panel. The panel,
composed of various University of
ficials and the two student repre
sentatives, makes a
recommendation to University
President Donald Kennedy.
At the Commencement Panel's
first meeting on Wednesday, Gor
bachev was mentioned, but his
name evoked "no major reaction,"

Smith said. Among the other
speakers under consideration are
Bill Cosby, Ronald Reagan, Andrei
Gromyko, Desmond Tutu and
Linus Pauling.
The criteria for selecting a com
mencement speaker include appeal
to students and guests, speaking
ability and the probability of getting
them to come, said Marlene Wine,
special assistant to Kennedy.
If the University did ask Gorba
chev, there is a great risk that even
if he did agree to come, he might

have to cancel at the last minute. In
addition, the security risk is a con
sideration, especially on a "family
day,"Wine said.
The security concern, of course,
would also be present for other
speakers such as Reagan and
Gromyko, Fleischauer said.
"I think it's kind of funny," said
Judith Goldstein, assistant profes
sor of political science. "You want
speakers at graduation who can
speak to parents and the graduating
class about things that are impor

tant to them. I don't know whether
Gorbachev could do this," she said.
Fleischauer said he thought Gor
bachev's perspective on the needs
of future U. S. leaders would be in
valuable in giving students a
broader vision and an open mind as
they "venture out into the real
world."
Kennedy will make the final deci
sion on the commencement
speaker by Dec. 1, according to
Robert Hamrdla, assistant to Ken
nedy.
