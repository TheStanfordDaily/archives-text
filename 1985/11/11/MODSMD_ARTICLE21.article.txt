## Fest Mixes East and West 
### BETSY JONES 
Delicate kaleidescope-like paper cutouts, lacy
dragons and panda bear doilies lined the walls in
the EAST House lounge last Friday night.
On the floor, approximately 20 Stanford stu
dents and faculty members sat and tried their
own hand at this traditional Chinese art form.
The sound of snipping scissors filled the room as
scraps of brightly colored paper began to cover
the floor.
A child methodically circled the room, picking
up some of the larger bits and depositing them
dutifully in the trash, explaining with a big grin on
his rosy-cheeked face that that's "where they
belong."
One man, oblivious to the concentrated activ
ity surrounding him, slumped in one of EAST
House's too-comfortable sofas.
"Oh," a woman exclaimed as she acidentally
cut her triangle of folded paper in two. "I think
I'd better start over."
Artist Wendy Wong took charge of helping the
group by explaining her native art with eloquent
gestures, and by the example of her cutouts
hanging on the wall. "It's hard to do â€” don't
worry about it," she said sympathetically.
Another girl, dressed in the traditional kimono
with a big yellow sash tied in a festive bow at her
back, opened the folded paper triangle she was
working on to find a dragonfly patterned inside.
Next to her, a student opened his cutout and
threw it on his friend's shoulder.
"Watch out," he yelled. "There's a bug on
your back."
Outside the lounge hung a big sign: Welcome
to East Fest, Nov. 8, 1985.
Just down the hall, eating a cup of green tea
ice cream, sat Lena Wuu, an EAST House resi

dent who explained what the festival was all
about.
"This is our fourth annual celebration of East
Fest in which we recognize the traditions of
Asian culture and have fun," she said.
The evening was broken into a progression of
colorful activities, beginning with a dinner that
featured Asian dishes as unfamiliar as Papar, a
spicy Indian version of tortilla chips, as basic as
Chop Che, a traditional Korean noodle dish and
as classic as Japanese tea.
The festival ended with an ail-American Stan
ford Friday night party.
In between dinner and the party there were
six sets of demonstrations like Wendy Wong's
paper cutout session, and two impressive per
formances: Pencak Silot, an Indonesian martial
arts group, and the San Francisco Taiko Dojo
drummers.
Though East Fest is only one of many cultural
educational experiences this academic theme
house sponsors every year, Wuu said, "It is our
biggest event."
The activities and shows focused on making
Asian traditions fun and informal.
The Taiko Dojo Drummers, a group of seven
men and women who perform some of the early,
almost primitive music for Japanese drums,
came out looking like savage kamikazis in their
black tights, blue headbands and yellow karate
smocks.
They danced dramatically around huge bongo
drums called Okedo drums, pounding rhythmi
cally as they circled around, all to the sound of
Tarzan jungle calls and unintelligible shouts com
ing from other group members behind them.
They performed a traditional rendition of
"Space Noto," the re-enactment of a 17th cen
tury campfire scene in which Japanese warriors
scare away their enemies by wearing savage

masks and seaweed in their hair.
Following this number, the drummers took a
break and asked audience members to try the
drums for themselves.
Five children, two of them dressed in mini
ature versions of karate black belt outfits, began
to batter the drums; each trying to outdo the
other.
Another volunteer, seemingly too mature for
this kind of thing, whipped off his tweed jacket
and swung his arms windmill-fashion in an im
promptu performance with two of his friends.
Then, resuming their show with a more so
phisticated synthesis of rhythm and dance har
mony, the Taiko drummers were joined by the
entire audience as Steve Kim, an EAST House
staff member, motioned everyone to stand up
and dance along.
The evening, in keeping with the way EAST
House residents live year-round, provided an
opportunity for students and faculty members to
extend their interests through an accessible ex
perience.
George, a junior in engineering, came to East
Fest to see the flower arranging demonstration.
"I'm interested in Japanese flower arrange
ment," he said. "The different colors have differ
ent meanings."
Though Japanese flower arranging originally
began as a religious ritual, today it is considered
a fine art.
"You can use any flowers, though," explained
the Japanese-born instructor inside EAST
House's demonstration room. "These 1 picked
up from Safeway."
An architectural engineering major came to
East Fest after a trip to Japan impressed him
with some of the same traditions being per
formed and demonstrated by the dancers and ar
tists at EAST House.
