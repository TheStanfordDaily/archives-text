# Biz Students Stock Up Against a Chimp
## 
### CHRIS LOUGHRIDGE KEN SAWYER 
What is hairy, picks fleas from its
body and eats them — and could
make $1,000?
No, it is not the average Daily
writer. It is the stock-picking chim
panzee for the Investor's Daily.
This chimpanzee (really just
Graduate School of Business stu
dent Jack Meyers concealed in a
monkey suit) leads the list of 156
entrants in the Investor's Daily
Stock Market game beginning today
at the business school. The game,
sponsored by both the business
school's Finance Club and the In
vestor's Daily (an investment
newspaper based in Los Angeles)
gives graduates, undergraduates
and primates alike the opportunity
to test their investment skills. At
the same time, the participants vie
for a $1,000 first prize as well as a
four-year subscription to the Inves
tor's Daily.
The rules of the game are as fol
lows: for a $5 entry fee, each con
testant is given an imaginary $1 mil
lion to invest in the stock market.

The contestant must select a
minimum of five and a maximum of
20 securities. Only purchases of
common and preferred stock are
allowed. Short sales, options,
futures, bonds and margin trades
are expressly forbidden.
The game runs for 25 weeks with
the grand prize to be awarded at
the end of that period. Cash prizes
of $50 will be awarded at the end of
each five-week period to those par
ticipants whose portfolios achieve
the highest appreciation.
To change one's original or cur
rent selection of stocks, the contes
tant must submit an order ticket by
noon on the day the transaction is
to be executed and pay a 1 percent
transaction fee or "commission."
The pseudo-chimp was dragged
in on a leash last Wednesday for his
inaugural picks by "zookeeper"
Mark Kammer, another business
school student.
At first, the banana-eating oracle
had some troubles hitting the stock
quotes, but succeeded finally in in
dicating the stocks listed in the box.
The chimp, while not making any
claims, did divulge his strategy. Sit
ting five yards from an Investor's

Daily stock page, he took careful
aim and hurled his darts, selecting
the 10 stocks he felt were most
likely to earn him $1,000.
Skip Klein, one of the game's or
ganizers, hopes the game will
become an annual event."The
finance club used to run a game just
like this a few years back. We
haven't done it recently because
the software we used became
outdated."
This year we just decided to do a
simplified version of the game on
Lotus," he said.
Klein, a Yale graduate, thinks the
game will give players an
"interesting educational experi
ence." He anticipates the majority
of entrants to choose highly risky
strategies, buying only a few very
speculative stocks.
Many contestants have spent
long hours researching possible in
vestments. Ross Williams, a first
year student in the business school,
has logged well over 25 hours at the
Jackson Business School Library.
While unwilling to divulge either his
carefully selected portfolio or his in
novative strategies, Williams
predicted, "I picked winners."


The chimp's picks: On the NYSE, Harcourt Brace,
Kopers,General Instruments, International Public Group,
Burroughs, International Harvestor. On NASDAQ,
Gaßnd, GeriM. On the AOTC, Gentex, Satlco.
