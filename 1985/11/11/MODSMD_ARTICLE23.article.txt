## Is There a Science Fiction Epic Poetry? 
### LISA LYNCH Editorial staff 
"The New World"
Fredrick Turner
Princeton University Press, 1985
When I think of epic poems, I think old. Real old. The "Iliad," the
"Aeneid," the "Odyssey" — these are epic poems, good adventure stories
related in their blank-versed glory by a benevolent poet. And they're about
things that happened in the past, the far past, long before our lifetimes and
often before the lifetime of the narrating poet.
So much for certainties. I've just read a 200-page epic poem that isn't
about the past, but about the future, and I'm really not quite sure how to
approach it. Fredrick Turner's "The New World" is so markedly different
from anything I've read that I'm not sure if it's good poetry, bad poetry or
poetry at all — I can think of several other things that it could be.
Turner's poem is set in the year 2376, and it describes life in the rough
geographical equivalent of the United States four centuries from now.
Turner's thesis (may ring a bell for students of American history) is that
the world's fossil and nuclear fuels will have been spent by this time, its
metallic ores exhausted and much of its population either departed for the
stars or slaughtered in centuries of class, political and religious wars.
Things in general will be pretty messy. High civilizations will still exist,
however, based on a technology of solar and wind power, glass and resin
chemistry, microprocessors and bioengineering. War is waged by mounted
knights in plastic armor, with laser swords. The Nation State (our present
political structure) will have collapsed, and new political organizations will
have emerged: violent matriarchies known as Riots, The Burbs, a servile
class descended from present day suburbia, cult-like Mad Counties and
aristocratic democracies known as Free Counties.
Most of this information isn't in the poem proper — it's in an introduction
to the work by Turner himself, in which he explains what's going on in the
story and what he's trying to do. The introduction is uncompromisingly op
timistic. According to Turner, the poem suggests "that a viable human
future, a possible history, however imperfect, does lie beyond our present
horizon." Turner explains that "art has the world-saving function of im
aginatively constructing other future" and adds, "The epic poem . . . may
be the most potent instrument for creating those alternate worlds."
At least the reader knows right away that Turner's up to serious busi
ness. Without the introduction, I imagine I would have taken the opening
section, where the hero James and his mother meet up with a futuristic
Sears' salesman, somewhat in the spirit of "Star Wars." Instead, I found
myself from the outset seeking an alternative to the Gotterdammerung of
mass suicide.
There's an almost painful similarity between some of the action in "The
New World" and the action of classic epic poems; James, the protagonist,
seems stamped into the role of the archetypal hero, and Turner's
presumptions about the regressions of civilization allow him to stage
battles and rituals that are almost Homeric parodies.
But at the bottom of the slash, bash and adventu r< \ I'm not sure if

Turner ever fulfills the ambitions of his introduction. I don't see hope for
the future in "The New World," I only see the future — science-fiction
style.
One of my problems with this book is that I have trouble defining science
fiction and fantasy works as literature. To me, they're a genre in them
selves, occupying a special and separate place in the universe between
"War and Peace" and "Swamp Thing." But a science fiction poem is still a
poem, I suppose. Unless I call it a non-literary poem, "The New World'
has pretty much created its own category.
Not that there haven't been works of science fiction regarded as
literature; George Orwell's "1984" and Aldous Huxley's "Brave New
World" immediately come to mind. These books, like "The New World,"
are both set in the future, and discuss "alternatives." Actually, Turner's
poem has a lot in common with these works; all three make political and
economic predictions, and suggest technological and social developments
that draw their roots more from the period in which they were written than
from the fantastic twists of a Bradburian mind.
There's one major difference: "The New World" is set 400 years in the
future, instead of a half-century or so. Huxley and Orwell painted their
grim visions on an already-existing canvas of English political and social so
ciety; Turner assumes that by the time his poem is written that massive,
fundamental changes have taken place. He does try'to explain these
changes, and I find his explanations fascinating, but his "New World" ulti
mately has too little to do with the old one.
Also, though Turner's ideas about the future are fascinating, they
remain only ideas. We don't see the actual workings of the society Turner
has set up — except in glimpses, such as an amusing story in the beginning
of the book in which the Sears' salesman relates how he got his job.
Rather than focusing on society, Turner focuses on his characters. Like
any good adventure, the poem is filled with love, hate, heroism betrayal
and mysterious "causes" which people are willing to die for. James, the
hero, and Ruth, the heroine, have a turbulent marriage which mirrors the
turbulence of the society around them. It is their story that Turner prefers
to tell. I imagine he hopes that through them we'll draw conclusions about
the world they live in.
Ruth's personal and intellectual development is detailed in a section
called "Ruth's Education." This is one of the most fascinating parts of the
poem; in it, Turner manages to summarize 400 years of the Earth's history
in his synopsis of Ruth's lessons.
The history Ruth learns begins — coincidentally— in the late 1900s.
She learns (and we learn) the history of the U.S. Supreme Court in the last
centuries of its existence. Turner has a field day with recent Supreme
Court decisions. He tells us: "Perhaps the deepest decision that the court
arrived at, and the most far-reaching, was to confirm the late/ nineteen
seventy's legality of abortion on demand ... /it constituted a redefinition
of what it is to be human/The landmark series of cases where children
sued/for malpractice, and won, against parents and schools, was only/the
start of a process that. . . shattered the reigning liberal tyranny."
Eventually, Turner suggests, the Supreme Court and the legal system
of the United States self-destructed, collapsing under the weight of con
flicts and redefinitions of human rights and principles.

It is in this "history" section that Turner's work most closely resembles
Huxley's and Orwell's. Like these authors, Turner points to what he
seems to feel are contemporary problems, and suggests possible effects.
His editorialization of the future — in the form of history — makes one
consider both the validity of his predictions and the validity of history in
general. In doubting what Turner's narrator tells us about the "past," I
start to reconsider my acceptance of history in general. But this still isn't a
solution to the Gotterdammerung of mass suicide.
When I finished reading "The New World," I was left with the feeling
that Turner had done something not many other contemporary poets have
tried to do. (That's a good an excuse as any for why I didn't discuss the
poetics of the poem, but rather talked about it in "prosey" terms.) For that
reason alone, I think it's worth reading if you've an interest in contempo
rary poetry. If you're a science fiction buff, so much the better. If you think
poetry is flighty and science fiction just too weird, well, it's a great ad
venture story. Not for the weak-hearted, nostalgic or haters of "Star
Wars."

Most of this information isn't in the poem proper — it's in an introduction
to the work by Turner himself, in which he explains what's going on in the
story and what he's trying to do. The introduction is uncompromisingly op
timistic. According to Turner, the poem suggests "that a viable human
future, a possible history, however imperfect, does lie beyond our present
horizon." Turner explains that "art has the world-saving function of im
aginatively constructing other future" and adds, "The epic poem . . . may
be the most potent instrument for creating those alternate worlds."
At least the reader knows right away that Turner's up to serious busi
ness. Without the introduction, I imagine I would have taken the opening
section, where the hero James and his mother meet up with a futuristic
Sears' salesman, somewhat in the spirit of "Star Wars." Instead, I found
myself from the outset seeking an alternative to the Gotterdammerung of
mass suicide.
There's an almost painful similarity between some of the action in "The
New World" and the action of classic epic poems; James, the protagonist,
seems stamped into the role of the archetypal hero, and Turner's
presumptions about the regressions of civilization allow him to stage
battles and rituals that are almost Homeric parodies.
But at the bottom of the slash, bash and adventu r< \ I'm not sure if

Turner ever fulfills the ambitions of his introduction. I don't see hope for
the future in "The New World," I only see the future — science-fiction
style.
One of my problems with this book is that I have trouble defining science
fiction and fantasy works as literature. To me, they're a genre in them
selves, occupying a special and separate place in the universe between
"War and Peace" and "Swamp Thing." But a science fiction poem is still a
poem, I suppose. Unless I call it a non-literary poem, "The New World'
has pretty much created its own category.
Not that there haven't been works of science fiction regarded as
literature; George Orwell's "1984" and Aldous Huxley's "Brave New
World" immediately come to mind. These books, like "The New World,"
are both set in the future, and discuss "alternatives." Actually, Turner's
poem has a lot in common with these works; all three make political and
economic predictions, and suggest technological and social developments
that draw their roots more from the period in which they were written than
from the fantastic twists of a Bradburian mind.
There's one major difference: "The New World" is set 400 years in the
future, instead of a half-century or so. Huxley and Orwell painted their
grim visions on an already-existing canvas of English political and social so
ciety; Turner assumes that by the time his poem is written that massive,
fundamental changes have taken place. He does try'to explain these
changes, and I find his explanations fascinating, but his "New World" ulti
mately has too little to do with the old one.
Also, though Turner's ideas about the future are fascinating, they
remain only ideas. We don't see the actual workings of the society Turner
has set up — except in glimpses, such as an amusing story in the beginning
of the book in which the Sears' salesman relates how he got his job.
Rather than focusing on society, Turner focuses on his characters. Like
any good adventure, the poem is filled with love, hate, heroism betrayal
and mysterious "causes" which people are willing to die for. James, the
hero, and Ruth, the heroine, have a turbulent marriage which mirrors the
turbulence of the society around them. It is their story that Turner prefers
to tell. I imagine he hopes that through them we'll draw conclusions about
the world they live in.
Ruth's personal and intellectual development is detailed in a section
called "Ruth's Education." This is one of the most fascinating parts of the
poem; in it, Turner manages to summarize 400 years of the Earth's history
in his synopsis of Ruth's lessons.
The history Ruth learns begins — coincidentally— in the late 1900s.
She learns (and we learn) the history of the U.S. Supreme Court in the last
centuries of its existence. Turner has a field day with recent Supreme
Court decisions. He tells us: "Perhaps the deepest decision that the court
arrived at, and the most far-reaching, was to confirm the late/ nineteen
seventy's legality of abortion on demand ... /it constituted a redefinition
of what it is to be human/The landmark series of cases where children
sued/for malpractice, and won, against parents and schools, was only/the
start of a process that. . . shattered the reigning liberal tyranny."
Eventually, Turner suggests, the Supreme Court and the legal system
of the United States self-destructed, collapsing under the weight of con
flicts and redefinitions of human rights and principles.

It is in this "history" section that Turner's work most closely resembles
Huxley's and Orwell's. Like these authors, Turner points to what he
seems to feel are contemporary problems, and suggests possible effects.
His editorialization of the future — in the form of history — makes one
consider both the validity of his predictions and the validity of history in
general. In doubting what Turner's narrator tells us about the "past," I
start to reconsider my acceptance of history in general. But this still isn't a
solution to the Gotterdammerung of mass suicide.
When I finished reading "The New World," I was left with the feeling
that Turner had done something not many other contemporary poets have
tried to do. (That's a good an excuse as any for why I didn't discuss the
poetics of the poem, but rather talked about it in "prosey" terms.) For that
reason alone, I think it's worth reading if you've an interest in contempo
rary poetry. If you're a science fiction buff, so much the better. If you think
poetry is flighty and science fiction just too weird, well, it's a great ad
venture story. Not for the weak-hearted, nostalgic or haters of "Star
Wars."

"The New World"
Fredrick Turner
Princeton University Press, 1985
When I think of epic poems, I think old. Real old. The "Iliad," the
"Aeneid," the "Odyssey" — these are epic poems, good adventure stories
related in their blank-versed glory by a benevolent poet. And they're about
things that happened in the past, the far past, long before our lifetimes and
often before the lifetime of the narrating poet.
So much for certainties. I've just read a 200-page epic poem that isn't
about the past, but about the future, and I'm really not quite sure how to
approach it. Fredrick Turner's "The New World" is so markedly different
from anything I've read that I'm not sure if it's good poetry, bad poetry or
poetry at all — I can think of several other things that it could be.
Turner's poem is set in the year 2376, and it describes life in the rough
geographical equivalent of the United States four centuries from now.
Turner's thesis (may ring a bell for students of American history) is that
the world's fossil and nuclear fuels will have been spent by this time, its
metallic ores exhausted and much of its population either departed for the
stars or slaughtered in centuries of class, political and religious wars.
Things in general will be pretty messy. High civilizations will still exist,
however, based on a technology of solar and wind power, glass and resin
chemistry, microprocessors and bioengineering. War is waged by mounted
knights in plastic armor, with laser swords. The Nation State (our present
political structure) will have collapsed, and new political organizations will
have emerged: violent matriarchies known as Riots, The Burbs, a servile
class descended from present day suburbia, cult-like Mad Counties and
aristocratic democracies known as Free Counties.
