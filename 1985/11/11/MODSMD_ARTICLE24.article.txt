## Stanford Pours it on OSU 39-24 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
If you weren't one of the 26,000 brave
and/or suicidal fans who turned out to see
Stanford defeat Oregon State 39-24 Satur
day night, you missed two things:
1. The first complete-game performance
by the Cardinal offense since the loss to
Texas six weeks ago.
2. Pneumonia.
The attendance was the lowest at a Stan

ford home game since 1973, but consider
ing that it was cold, dark, windy, rainy and
Oregon State was the opponent, that
wasn't too surprising.
The surprises were a new-look Cardinal
offense that ran a lot of plays out of the
three-back power-I formation and a we
don't-look-at-films Beaver defense that
allowed Stanford's two leading receivers to
catch a total of 17 passes.
Fullback Brad Muster, making his first
start in almost a month, rushed for 65 yards
and two touchdowns and snagged 12 passes

to boost his conference-leading receiving
total to 61. And just a week after being shut
down by Washington's man-on-man
coverage, tight end Greg Baty was inex
plicably abandoned long enough to catch
five passes for 91 yards.
The power-I was dusted off in practice
this week because, according to Muster,
"the coaches haven't been happy with the
way we've been running." With backs Brian
Morris and Kevin Scott lined up in front of
him, Muster was able to bang out enough
yardage to keep the Oregon State

defenders honest.
"1 love it (the power-I)," said Muster,
who wore a foam rubber pad and a flak
jacket to protect his bruised sternum. "I did
a lot of it in high school. I think you get to
see a little more of the defense, and you can
make a lot better reads."
Baty, the team's second-leading
receiver, was able to get open at the right
times. He set up a first-half touchdown with
a 50-yard catch and sparked a second-half
TD drive with grabs of 17 and 10 yards.
"In the first half I didn't catch the ball that

much, so I think they kind of relaxed in the
second half," Baty said. "I don't think they
overplayed me at all."
Much of the reason why the Stanford of
fense had such a good day was the Stanford
defense. Three of the Cardinal's scoring
drives started inside the Oregon State 30-
yard line, and another three began between
the Stanford 46 and the Beaver goal line.
Freshman Beaver quarterback Rich
Gonzales was sacked three times and
threw three interceptions, thanks to the Cardinal's first
strong pass rush of the Pacific 10 Conference season.
And the Stanford defense did a number on hobbled All-
Pac-10 wide receiver Reggie Bynum, who caught only
three passes for 17 yards.
"The biggest part of our defense on Reggie Bynum
was getting that pass rush," said cornerback Toi Cook,
who picked off one Bynum-bound pass in the end zone
and returned it 53 yards. "Without that pressure, he
(Gonzales) could have sat back and picked us apart."
"They came in here thinking they were going to beat
us," Baty said. "After they beat Washington and Wash
ington beat us, they thought they were the better
team. We didn't want to let that happen.
"There was a lot of emotion before the game, a lot
more than usual," he said. "We came out and did what
it took to win. Good teams find a way to win, and that's
what we did today."
Stanford scored on its first possession of the after
noon — whoops, evening. On a third and nine from the
Cardinal 47, Muster took a screen pass from quarter
back John Paye and rumbled past tacklers on the right
sideline for a 28-yard gain. Four plays later, Morris
took a quick handoff out of the power-I and scored from
the one.
Oregon State came back to tie the game on a five
minute, 80-yard drive that was capped by taiback
Erick Montgomery's two-yard plunge. Then things got
weird.
The Beavers waddled downfield on another long
drive — seven minutes, 78 yards — and ran into a
Cardinal dam inside the 10-yard line. On fourth and
goal from the one, defensive tackle Sean Scheller
rejected OSU fullback Darvis Malone and Stanford took
over on downs.
And the fans were treated to what was apparently
the fastest two-step safety dance in NCAA history. On
the Cardinal's first play, Muster tried to sweep right
and was nailed in the end zone by cornerback Lavance
Northington and linebacker Harold Johnson.
Punter Doug Robison belted a 65-yard free kick to
the Oregon State 15, and the Beavers went nowhere in
three plays. The snap to punter Chip Stempeck was
high, and Cardinal linebacker Chris Weber forced
Stempeck to eat the ball in the end zone. Within a space
of 58 seconds, the score had gone from 7-7 to 9-9.
On the Cardinal's next possession, Paye looked
downfield and saw Baty cruising over the middle, two
steps ahead of safety Michael Lopez. He drilled the ball
home and Baty roared down to the OSU three-yard
line, where Muster took the ball two plays later and
barreled into the end zone.
Stanford had a chance to blow the game open on its

next two possessions. A Kurt Colehower interception
gave the Cardinal the ball on the Oregon State 20, and
a 15-yard Stemper punt put the ball on the Beaver 30.
But the OSU defense held on both occasions, and
kicker David Sweeney had to come on to kick field
goals of 37 and 34 yards.
The Beavers pulled to within 22-16 at the half on a
play that Cook called a "fluke." Gonzales scrambled
right on first and 20 from the OSU 27, and lofted a pass
down the right sideline that looked like it was heading
for receiver Dave Montagne and Cook.
"At first I was thinking 'This is a pick, this is a
pick,' " Cook said. "I jumped for it and it went over my
hands to the other guy."
The other guy was tight end Phil Ross, who hap
pened to be running a pattern behind Montagne. He
cradled in the pass and juked cornerback Walt Harris
into the ground en route to a 73-yard TD completion.
The Stanford offense opened the second half with
the long-awaited reprise of the Brad Muster march.
Muster carried eight times, caught four passes and
scored the touchdown on the eight-minute, 76-yard
drive that extended the Cardinal's lead to 29-16.
Oregon State looked like it was about to reshrink
that lead when Cook got his crucial pickoff.
On second and seven from the Stanford 9, Bynum
ran an out-and-up into the right side of the end zone.
Gonzales tried to force it in, and Cook stepped in front
of Bynum and raced to the OSU 47, setting up an even
tual 31-yard Sweeney field goal.
"Cook's interception was a big one," Stanford Coach
Jack Elway said. "That turned it around."
"It happened at the right time," Cook said. "We had
our backs against the wall. Anytime you stop a team
like that, it gives you a lift."
The Cardinal ended any doubts about the game's
outcome when Ernie Fisher partially blocked Glenn
Pena's punt, sending the ball seven yards downfield to
the Oregon State 30. Paye found Baty for a pair of key
receptions, and Scott scored on a four-yard reverse to
put Stanford ahead 39-16.
The Beavers put together an 81-yard TD drive and
connected on the two-point conversion to pull to within
15 points. The onside kick worked, but Harris got the
defense's third interception of the day to seal the win.
Card notes
Thanks to 12 hours of therapy with an electrical
stimulator on his partially separated right shoulder,
Paye said he was able to "throw without pain for the
first time since my injury." He hit on 24 of 36 passes
for 238 yards, and threw downfield a little more often
than usual.
Inside linebackers Matt Soderlund and Jack Gil
mete each recorded 10 tackles and moved over the
100-tackle plateau for the season. Soderlund has 105,
Gilmete 102.

gave the Cardinal the ball on the Oregon State 20, and
a 15-yard Stemper punt put the ball on the Beaver 30.
But the OSU defense held on both occasions, and
kicker David Sweeney had to come on to kick field
goals of 37 and 34 yards.
The Beavers pulled to within 22-16 at the half on a
play that Cook called a "fluke." Gonzales scrambled
right on first and 20 from the OSU 27, and lofted a pass
down the right sideline that looked like it was heading
for receiver Dave Montagne and Cook.
"At first I was thinking 'This is a pick, this is a
pick,' " Cook said. "I jumped for it and it went over my
hands to the other guy."
The other guy was tight end Phil Ross, who hap
pened to be running a pattern behind Montagne. He
cradled in the pass and juked cornerback Walt Harris
into the ground en route to a 73-yard TD completion.
The Stanford offense opened the second half with
the long-awaited reprise of the Brad Muster march.
Muster carried eight times, caught four passes and
scored the touchdown on the eight-minute, 76-yard
drive that extended the Cardinal's lead to 29-16.
Oregon State looked like it was about to reshrink
that lead when Cook got his crucial pickoff.
On second and seven from the Stanford 9, Bynum
ran an out-and-up into the right side of the end zone.
Gonzales tried to force it in, and Cook stepped in front
of Bynum and raced to the OSU 47, setting up an even
tual 31-yard Sweeney field goal.
"Cook's interception was a big one," Stanford Coach
Jack Elway said. "That turned it around."
"It happened at the right time," Cook said. "We had
our backs against the wall. Anytime you stop a team
like that, it gives you a lift."
The Cardinal ended any doubts about the game's
outcome when Ernie Fisher partially blocked Glenn
Pena's punt, sending the ball seven yards downfield to
the Oregon State 30. Paye found Baty for a pair of key
receptions, and Scott scored on a four-yard reverse to
put Stanford ahead 39-16.
The Beavers put together an 81-yard TD drive and
connected on the two-point conversion to pull to within
15 points. The onside kick worked, but Harris got the
defense's third interception of the day to seal the win.
Card notes
Thanks to 12 hours of therapy with an electrical
stimulator on his partially separated right shoulder,
Paye said he was able to "throw without pain for the
first time since my injury." He hit on 24 of 36 passes
for 238 yards, and threw downfield a little more often
than usual.
Inside linebackers Matt Soderlund and Jack Gil

Oregon State did not hound Stanford tight end Greg Baty as Washington had two weekends ago.
Baty found enough open space in the Beaver secondary to grab five balls for 91 yards.
If you weren't one of the 26,000 brave
and/or suicidal fans who turned out to see
Stanford defeat Oregon State 39-24 Satur
day night, you missed two things:
1. The first complete-game performance
by the Cardinal offense since the loss to
Texas six weeks ago.
2. Pneumonia.
The attendance was the lowest at a Stan

ford home game since 1973, but consider
ing that it was cold, dark, windy, rainy and
Oregon State was the opponent, that
wasn't too surprising.
The surprises were a new-look Cardinal
offense that ran a lot of plays out of the
three-back power-I formation and a we
don't-look-at-films Beaver defense that
allowed Stanford's two leading receivers to
catch a total of 17 passes.
Fullback Brad Muster, making his first
start in almost a month, rushed for 65 yards
and two touchdowns and snagged 12 passes

to boost his conference-leading receiving
total to 61. And just a week after being shut
down by Washington's man-on-man
coverage, tight end Greg Baty was inex
plicably abandoned long enough to catch
five passes for 91 yards.
The power-I was dusted off in practice
this week because, according to Muster,
"the coaches haven't been happy with the
way we've been running." With backs Brian
Morris and Kevin Scott lined up in front of
him, Muster was able to bang out enough
yardage to keep the Oregon State

defenders honest.
"1 love it (the power-I)," said Muster,
who wore a foam rubber pad and a flak
jacket to protect his bruised sternum. "I did
a lot of it in high school. I think you get to
see a little more of the defense, and you can
make a lot better reads."
Baty, the team's second-leading
receiver, was able to get open at the right
times. He set up a first-half touchdown with
a 50-yard catch and sparked a second-half
TD drive with grabs of 17 and 10 yards.
"In the first half I didn't catch the ball that

much, so I think they kind of relaxed in the
second half," Baty said. "I don't think they
overplayed me at all."
Much of the reason why the Stanford of
fense had such a good day was the Stanford
defense. Three of the Cardinal's scoring
drives started inside the Oregon State 30-
yard line, and another three began between
the Stanford 46 and the Beaver goal line.
Freshman Beaver quarterback Rich
Gonzales was sacked three times and
threw three interceptions, thanks to the Cardinal's first
strong pass rush of the Pacific 10 Conference season.
And the Stanford defense did a number on hobbled All-
Pac-10 wide receiver Reggie Bynum, who caught only
three passes for 17 yards.
"The biggest part of our defense on Reggie Bynum
was getting that pass rush," said cornerback Toi Cook,
who picked off one Bynum-bound pass in the end zone
and returned it 53 yards. "Without that pressure, he
(Gonzales) could have sat back and picked us apart."
"They came in here thinking they were going to beat
us," Baty said. "After they beat Washington and Wash
ington beat us, they thought they were the better
team. We didn't want to let that happen.
"There was a lot of emotion before the game, a lot
more than usual," he said. "We came out and did what
it took to win. Good teams find a way to win, and that's
what we did today."
Stanford scored on its first possession of the after
noon — whoops, evening. On a third and nine from the
Cardinal 47, Muster took a screen pass from quarter
back John Paye and rumbled past tacklers on the right
sideline for a 28-yard gain. Four plays later, Morris
took a quick handoff out of the power-I and scored from
the one.
Oregon State came back to tie the game on a five
minute, 80-yard drive that was capped by taiback
Erick Montgomery's two-yard plunge. Then things got
weird.
The Beavers waddled downfield on another long
drive — seven minutes, 78 yards — and ran into a
Cardinal dam inside the 10-yard line. On fourth and
goal from the one, defensive tackle Sean Scheller
rejected OSU fullback Darvis Malone and Stanford took
over on downs.
And the fans were treated to what was apparently
the fastest two-step safety dance in NCAA history. On
the Cardinal's first play, Muster tried to sweep right
and was nailed in the end zone by cornerback Lavance
Northington and linebacker Harold Johnson.
Punter Doug Robison belted a 65-yard free kick to
the Oregon State 15, and the Beavers went nowhere in
three plays. The snap to punter Chip Stempeck was
high, and Cardinal linebacker Chris Weber forced
Stempeck to eat the ball in the end zone. Within a space
of 58 seconds, the score had gone from 7-7 to 9-9.
On the Cardinal's next possession, Paye looked
downfield and saw Baty cruising over the middle, two
steps ahead of safety Michael Lopez. He drilled the ball
home and Baty roared down to the OSU three-yard
line, where Muster took the ball two plays later and
barreled into the end zone.
Stanford had a chance to blow the game open on its

next two possessions. A Kurt Colehower interception
gave the Cardinal the ball on the Oregon State 20, and
a 15-yard Stemper punt put the ball on the Beaver 30.

much, so I think they kind of relaxed in the
second half," Baty said. "I don't think they
overplayed me at all."
Much of the reason why the Stanford of
fense had such a good day was the Stanford
defense. Three of the Cardinal's scoring
drives started inside the Oregon State 30-
yard line, and another three began between
the Stanford 46 and the Beaver goal line.
Freshman Beaver quarterback Rich
Gonzales was sacked three times and
threw three interceptions, thanks to the Cardinal's first
strong pass rush of the Pacific 10 Conference season.
And the Stanford defense did a number on hobbled All-
Pac-10 wide receiver Reggie Bynum, who caught only
three passes for 17 yards.
"The biggest part of our defense on Reggie Bynum
was getting that pass rush," said cornerback Toi Cook,
who picked off one Bynum-bound pass in the end zone
and returned it 53 yards. "Without that pressure, he
(Gonzales) could have sat back and picked us apart."
"They came in here thinking they were going to beat
us," Baty said. "After they beat Washington and Wash
ington beat us, they thought they were the better
team. We didn't want to let that happen.
"There was a lot of emotion before the game, a lot
more than usual," he said. "We came out and did what
it took to win. Good teams find a way to win, and that's
what we did today."
Stanford scored on its first possession of the after
noon — whoops, evening. On a third and nine from the
Cardinal 47, Muster took a screen pass from quarter
back John Paye and rumbled past tacklers on the right
sideline for a 28-yard gain. Four plays later, Morris
took a quick handoff out of the power-I and scored from
the one.
Oregon State came back to tie the game on a five
minute, 80-yard drive that was capped by taiback
Erick Montgomery's two-yard plunge. Then things got
weird.
The Beavers waddled downfield on another long
drive — seven minutes, 78 yards — and ran into a
Cardinal dam inside the 10-yard line. On fourth and
goal from the one, defensive tackle Sean Scheller
rejected OSU fullback Darvis Malone and Stanford took
over on downs.
And the fans were treated to what was apparently
the fastest two-step safety dance in NCAA history. On
the Cardinal's first play, Muster tried to sweep right
and was nailed in the end zone by cornerback Lavance
Northington and linebacker Harold Johnson.
Punter Doug Robison belted a 65-yard free kick to
the Oregon State 15, and the Beavers went nowhere in
three plays. The snap to punter Chip Stempeck was
high, and Cardinal linebacker Chris Weber forced
Stempeck to eat the ball in the end zone. Within a space
of 58 seconds, the score had gone from 7-7 to 9-9.
On the Cardinal's next possession, Paye looked
downfield and saw Baty cruising over the middle, two
steps ahead of safety Michael Lopez. He drilled the ball
home and Baty roared down to the OSU three-yard
line, where Muster took the ball two plays later and
barreled into the end zone.
Stanford had a chance to blow the game open on its

next two possessions. A Kurt Colehower interception
gave the Cardinal the ball on the Oregon State 20, and
a 15-yard Stemper punt put the ball on the Beaver 30.
But the OSU defense held on both occasions, and
kicker David Sweeney had to come on to kick field
goals of 37 and 34 yards.
The Beavers pulled to within 22-16 at the half on a
play that Cook called a "fluke." Gonzales scrambled
right on first and 20 from the OSU 27, and lofted a pass
down the right sideline that looked like it was heading
for receiver Dave Montagne and Cook.
"At first I was thinking 'This is a pick, this is a
pick,' " Cook said. "I jumped for it and it went over my
hands to the other guy."
The other guy was tight end Phil Ross, who hap
pened to be running a pattern behind Montagne. He
cradled in the pass and juked cornerback Walt Harris
into the ground en route to a 73-yard TD completion.
The Stanford offense opened the second half with
the long-awaited reprise of the Brad Muster march.
Muster carried eight times, caught four passes and
scored the touchdown on the eight-minute, 76-yard
drive that extended the Cardinal's lead to 29-16.
Oregon State looked like it was about to reshrink
that lead when Cook got his crucial pickoff.
On second and seven from the Stanford 9, Bynum
ran an out-and-up into the right side of the end zone.
Gonzales tried to force it in, and Cook stepped in front
of Bynum and raced to the OSU 47, setting up an even
tual 31-yard Sweeney field goal.
"Cook's interception was a big one," Stanford Coach
Jack Elway said. "That turned it around."
"It happened at the right time," Cook said. "We had
our backs against the wall. Anytime you stop a team
like that, it gives you a lift."
The Cardinal ended any doubts about the game's
outcome when Ernie Fisher partially blocked Glenn
Pena's punt, sending the ball seven yards downfield to
the Oregon State 30. Paye found Baty for a pair of key
receptions, and Scott scored on a four-yard reverse to
put Stanford ahead 39-16.
The Beavers put together an 81-yard TD drive and
connected on the two-point conversion to pull to within
15 points. The onside kick worked, but Harris got the
defense's third interception of the day to seal the win.
Card notes
Thanks to 12 hours of therapy with an electrical
stimulator on his partially separated right shoulder,
Paye said he was able to "throw without pain for the
first time since my injury." He hit on 24 of 36 passes
for 238 yards, and threw downfield a little more often
than usual.
Inside linebackers Matt Soderlund and Jack Gil
mete each recorded 10 tackles and moved over the
100-tackle plateau for the season. Soderlund has 105,
Gilmete 102.

Oregon State did not hound Stanford tight end Greg Baty as Washington had two weekends ago.
Baty found enough open space in the Beaver secondary to grab five balls for 91 yards.
