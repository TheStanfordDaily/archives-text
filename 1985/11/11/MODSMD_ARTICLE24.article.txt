## Stanford Pours it on OSU 39-24 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
If you weren't one of the 26,000 brave
and/or suicidal fans who turned out to see
Stanford defeat Oregon State 39-24 Satur
day night, you missed two things:
1. The first complete-game performance
by the Cardinal offense since the loss to
Texas six weeks ago.
2. Pneumonia.
The attendance was the lowest at a Stan

ford home game since 1973, but consider
ing that it was cold, dark, windy, rainy and
Oregon State was the opponent, that
wasn't too surprising.
The surprises were a new-look Cardinal
offense that ran a lot of plays out of the
three-back power-I formation and a we
don't-look-at-films Beaver defense that
allowed Stanford's two leading receivers to
catch a total of 17 passes.
Fullback Brad Muster, making his first
start in almost a month, rushed for 65 yards
and two touchdowns and snagged 12 passes

to boost his conference-leading receiving
total to 61. And just a week after being shut
down by Washington's man-on-man
coverage, tight end Greg Baty was inex
plicably abandoned long enough to catch
five passes for 91 yards.
The power-I was dusted off in practice
this week because, according to Muster,
"the coaches haven't been happy with the
way we've been running." With backs Brian
Morris and Kevin Scott lined up in front of
him, Muster was able to bang out enough
yardage to keep the Oregon State

defenders honest.
"1 love it (the power-I)," said Muster,
who wore a foam rubber pad and a flak
jacket to protect his bruised sternum. "I did
a lot of it in high school. I think you get to
see a little more of the defense, and you can
make a lot better reads."
Baty, the team's second-leading
receiver, was able to get open at the right
times. He set up a first-half touchdown with
a 50-yard catch and sparked a second-half
TD drive with grabs of 17 and 10 yards.
"In the first half I didn't catch the ball that

much, so I think they kind of relaxed in the
second half," Baty said. "I don't think they
overplayed me at all."
Much of the reason why the Stanford of
fense had such a good day was the Stanford
defense. Three of the Cardinal's scoring
drives started inside the Oregon State 30-
yard line, and another three began between
the Stanford 46 and the Beaver goal line.

Gonzales was sacked three times and
