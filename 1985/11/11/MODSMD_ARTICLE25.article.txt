# Odd Plays Under The Lights
## 
### 
Thanks a lot, Ted Turner. Saturday afternoon
was a classic day for football — cool, crisp and
partly sunny. And Stanford had a home game Sat
urday. At night. So, instead of cool and sunny, it
was cold and rainy and generally miserable.
It seemed the game would be just as
miserable. Two teams battling it out for eighth
place in a down year for the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. The folks at WTBS were probably kicking
themselves for having to show this one nation
ally.

It had all the ingredients to be a good high
school game. It was under the lights, and a good
high school crowd of 26,000 braved the cold. And
then strange things began to happen.
There was the Oregon State timeout with one
second left before the end of the first quarter and
a free timeout. There was the exchange of
safeties within 53 seconds, believed to be an
NCAA record. There were the dropped snaps by
Beaver punter Charles Stempeck.
There was Oregon State's second touchdown,
when Rich Gonzales overthrew Robert Adams,
only to have Phil Ross 10 yards further downfield
and turn it into a 73-yard score.
There was the Stanford fake punt that lost a
yard just before the half — good timing, wrong
play. And fittingly, a snap over Gonzales' head to
end the half.
The fun continued when Ernie Fisher blocked
a Beaver punt, only to have OSU's Ron Heller
catch the punt and run 30 yards illegally. The
Beavers' last touchdown came when Gonzales
fumbled and turned the broken play into a scoring
run.
So the folks watching at home were at least
entertained. Yet, buried in all the strangeness,
were some straightforward Division I perfor
mances.
The first was by the Stanford defensive line.
Usually conspicuous only when being run over
this year, the down linemen played their best
game of the year. Joe Lortie had a pair of sacks,
and Sean Scheller and Kurt Colehower combined
for another. Tony Leiker, Fisher and Jack Gil
mete all had tackles for losses.
"We ran some stunts we hadn't run before, and
they worked real well," Leiker said. "We've got
ten better as the year's gone on. We're young,
and we hadn't had that cohesiveness. We
definitely had something to prove."
"The first thing is that we got a good pass
rush," cornerback Toi Cook said. "When we
blitzed, we got to the quarterback. We didn't give
Gonzales time to find Reggie Bynum."
And coming through on those blitzes were Gil
mete and Matt Soderlund, except when strong
safety Sam Sutherland had Gonzales wishing he
had chosen another extracurricular activity.
Another key was Brad Muster: "I'm feeling
good," the fullback said. The man is back, which
is good news for the Stanford offense. He had 12
receptions for 103 yards and had another 65
yards rushing.
Then there were the expected performances.
John Paye: 24-of-36, 238 vards, no interceptions.
There was also an offensive line that allowed
Paye to be sacked only once and helped grind out
107 yards on the ground. And the secondary shut
down Bynum, holding the main Beaver receiving
threat to only three catches for 17 yards, while
intercepting Gonzales three times.
Although Oregon State doesn't rank among
the Pac-10 elite, the win was refreshing in one
regard — the Cardinal soundly defeated a team it
should soundly defeat. That hasn't happened
since the opener against San Jose State, as
losses to Oregon and San Diego State will attest.
The trip to Arizona State next week won't be a
should-win game, but with a solid performance
like Saturday's, it is a could-win game.
