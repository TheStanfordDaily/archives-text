# Aussies Go Down Under Pressure
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
It may not count, but the Stanford men's basketball
team's 102-90 exhibition victory over the Australian
National Team on Friday might convince a lot of people
that a repeat of last season is not forthcoming.
Led by guard Steve Brown with 17 points and for
ward Greg Butler with 16, the Cardinal disposed of a
team that came back the next night to defeat California
73-55. The Sporting News has picked the Bears to win
the Pacific 10 Conference.
"I was pleased with everything," Stanford Coach
Tom Davis said. "We played pretty good basketball,
overall. I'm glad with how the new kids played, and the
older kids have all improved over last year."
"Everything went smoothly," guard Keith Ramee
said. "There are still some things we have to work on,
but everyone played real well."
The Australians, who finished seventh a year ago at
the Olympics in Los Angeles, still seemed to be suffer
ing from the effects of almost 24 hours of travel, as
well as having to adjust to NCAA rales.
"I don't know if that was their best effort," Davis
said. "I think they're still coming off the effects of the
trip."
"I think the refs here call it a little tighter than what
they're used to," forward Earl Koberlein said. "And it's
our turf, our rules."
Another change for the Australians was the lack of a
three-point line. Forward Andrew Gaze led Australia
with 26 points before fouling out, but many of his
bombs would have been worth an extra point back
home.
Australia took an early 22-11 lead in the first seven
minutes, but Stanford came back with 10 straight
points to pull within one. The Cardinal took its first lead
at 27-26 when Butler — who was 8-for-10 from the
field — scored on a hook with nine minutes left.
Stanford went ahead for good at 35-34 when Novian
Whitsitt popped a baseline jumper from six feet at the
four-minute mark and took a 46-41 lead in at halftime.
The Cardinal press took the Australians out of their
game for much of the second half. "It's a combination,"
Davis said. "I think we played it pretty well, but it's
something you don't see in international ball. They
back off, play it like the NBA. We try to play like the
NBA at playoff time."
"If they were used to a press, it wasn't our kind,"
Ramee said.
The only negative for the Cardinal seemed to be in
its rebounding, despite holding a 38-37 edge in that de
partment on the night. "It's shaky," Davis said.
"There's no question that's what will limit how good
this team is."
"It's just a matter of screening out and being more
aggressive," said Koberlein, who led Stanford with
seven boards. "It's going to take a lot of work — we
can't just jump and get it."

Freshman Todd Lichti's debut for the Cardinal in Friday's 102-90 victory over the Australian na
tional team raised hopes among Stanford boosters. Lichti scored 11 points on the evening.


Kevin Scott's fourth-quarter touchdown run of four yards gave the
Cardinal a 39-16 lead and all but sealed the victory for Stanford. The

Romerein/Daily
win gave the Cardinal a 3-6 mark on the year and provided reason for
the team to keep its head up.
