# Cardinal Beats USC 9-7, Smells Pac 10 Title
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff writer 
For lack of hunger, the Stanford water polo
team could have lost a match this weekend.
Luckily, the Cardinal's appetite was sparked
and Stanford came out victorious in the end,
defeating No. 8 University of Southern Cali
fornia 9-7 on Friday afternoon at DeGuerre
Pool.
The Cardinal, No. 1 in the nation with a 20-
4 record, trailed 4-1 at one point in the
match, following a three-goal rally by the
Trojans (17-11) in the second quarter.
"We really wanted to win the match, but
we just weren't hungry enough for it at first,"
Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti said. "We
weren't in a must-win situation so we weren't
pushing ourselves. USC's three-goal lead
opened our eyes and really got us going."
Stanford was able to pull up to 4-2 by the
half after junior Jaime Velez scored on a
counter attack with 2:04 remaining in the
half.
"At the half, the players were really get
ting mad at themselves and got tired of being
behind," Dettamanti said. "We started fight
ing in the third quarter and took advantage of
the sun being in USC's eyes to help us
score."
After the halftime, Stanford jumped back
into the match with a five-goal third quarter,
three of those goals coming in the last three
minutes of the quarter. Following goals by
Velez and sophomore Erich Fisher, junior

Craig Klass was able to even the score at five
for the Cardinal with 2:25 remaining in the
third.
David Imbernino's backhand shot from the
hole with 0:55 remaining put the Cardinal up
for the first time in the match, and a shot by
Fisher with 0:03 remaining built Stanford's
lead to 7-5.
Although the Trojans were able to rally
two goals in the final quarter, Klass and soph
omore Matt Tingler tallied two more goals for
Stanford to keep the Cardinal lead at two.
"In the second half we played well, but
overall the match was hardly one of our
best," Dettamanti said. "The refs were call
ing in such a way that it was difficult to pick up
any rhythm and get going."
One area of the Cardinal play that did
please Dettamanti was the defensive play of
freshman goalie Todd Kemp.
"(Todd) Kemp had some spectacular saves
and really did well for us," Dettamanti said.
The Cardinal is now 4-0 in the Pac-10 con
ference with two matches against UC-
Berkeley remaining in regular season play.
The teams will meet at Berkeley on Friday
for a match beginning at 3 p.m. Then it's back
to Stanford on Nov. 23 for the "Big Splash."
That game, which has already been billed as a
warmup for the Stanford-Berkeley football
game, will start at 10:30 a.m. in DeGuerre
Pool.
Stanford is shooting for the NCAA playoffs
to be held Nov. 29 through Dec. 1 in Long
Beach.
