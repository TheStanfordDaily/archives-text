# Spikers Dump UCLA, Pepperdine
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
An overflow crowd that came to see a repeat
of UCLA's national championship victory over
the Cardinal last year left the John Wooden Cen
ter Friday night disappointed as No. 1 Stanford
devastated the defending champions 15-11, 15-
12, 15-5.
The No. 2 Bruins, who last December
defeated the Cardinal in five games at UCLA's
Pauley Pavilion to claim the national title, had not
lost in 16 previous matches at the Wooden Cen
ter since it opened three years ago.
Saturday night the Cardinal completed its per
fect weekend with a 15-7, 15-13, 15-11 sweep of
Pepperdine at Malibu. The victory raised Stan
ford's overall record to 20-1. The 20 wins match
last seasons's victory total.
The Cardinal's victory over UCLA upped its
Pac-West record to 6-1 and clinched the confer
ence title. UCLA at 5-2 in Pac-West play (22-3
overall) can only tie the Cardinal with one more
conference game remaining. Since Stanford has
already defeated the Bruins twice this
season, the Cardinal would be the champions in
the case of a tie.
The victory Friday left no doubt as to who is
the top team in the nation. UCLA, which was
short-handed in an October loss at Stanford, had

all of its players available and the support of
more than 2,000 fans for this match.
"We played at the Wooden Center because
they (UCLA) wanted to pack the number of
people they would get into a small space," Card
inal Co-coach Don Shaw explained. "They had
to turn people away."
Still, Stanford dominated.
"We never really let them get into the match,"
Shaw said.
The Cardinal silenced the anxious crowd by
starting quickly in each of the three games.
"The girls seemed to be really pumped up,"
Shaw said. "They were really prepared."
The Bruins mounted rallies after falling behind
early in the first two games, briefly allowing the
crowd to become a factor.
"There were some great rallies in the first two
games," Shaw said. "It was just unbelievable.
We had pretty sizeable leads, but they made runs
at us."
In the fashion of a top-ranked team, though,
the Cardinal kicked into high gear when UCLA
closed in. "They never got close," Shaw empha
sized.
The difference in the match was Stanford's
domination in the middle. Sophomore Nancy
Reno had 17 kills and senior Kim Oden added 15.
"Nancy and Kim really dominated them,"
Shaw said. "Their middle wasn't very strong
against us."

UCLA senior Liz Masakayan had been a key
figure in past matches with the Cardinal, gaining
Most Valuable Player honors in last year's na
tional championship but missing this year's
match at Stanford due to suspension.
Friday she was controlled by the Cardinal.
"She (Masakayan) had 18 kills but only hit for a
.250 percentage," Shaw explained. "She did not
control the match like she has to for them."
Following the big victory over UCLA, Stan
ford struggled against Pepperdine Saturday but
still managed to sweep the Waves.
"We were nowhere near the same level (as
against UCLA)," Shaw said. "We had trouble
with our concentration which is understandable.
It was the typical letdown."
The Waves, who were expected to be a dan
gerous team this season, dropped to 17-14.
The match featured several long rallies, ac
cording to Shaw. "Pepperdine is a great defen
sive team, but they don't have a lot of power,"
he said. "So they rally with you forever."
The Cardinal has this week off before hosting
Arizona Friday in the last Pac-West match of the
season. This weekend they play in the Wendy's
Classic at Stockton.
Stanford, which plays in an unaccredited five
team conference, seems a lock to earn an at
large bid for the NCAA playoffs later this year.
The playoffs are scheduled for Dec. 20-22 in
Kalamazoo, Michigan.
