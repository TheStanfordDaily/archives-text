# Survey Indicates That MIT, Cal Preferred by Graduate Students

### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
According to a survey released by the Stanford
Graduate Division, the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and UC-Berkeley are Stanford's main
competitors for graduate students, especially in engi
neering.
The survey concludes that "this year's group (of ap
plicants) appeared to have made the ultimate decision
to go elsewhere on the basis of academic considera
tions. "MIT attracted 22 percent of the surveyed appli
cants away from Stanford and Berkeley attracted 21
percent.
The study said the applicants all had positive com
ments about Stanford's reputation and "interest in stu
dents." But a number of applicants said "overall pro-

gram and research opportunities" were the heaviest
factors applicants used in weighing their decisions to go
elsewhere.
The schools that attracted the next largest
percentage of applicants were Harvard, Princeton,
Yale, Caltech and Cornell, according to the survey.
Engineering and chemistry students were the ones
who were most likely to go elsewhere. The Stanford
Engineering Department lost 74 students to MIT and
Berkeley this year, while the Chemistry Department
lost 21.
Although financial aid was an important factor in the
students' decision-making process, the similarity of of
fers from the most competitive schools reduced the
weight of that factor considerably.
Also, loan debts were not important to the applicants
in making their decisions, according
to the report. Only 33 of the 367
questioned indicated that going into
debt concerned them at all, and
only 14 of those said it was a "very
significant" concern.
According to the survey, another
reason students went elsewhere
was a lack of contact between appli
cants and the departments to which
they applied. The "lack of planning
on the department's part to make
(the) prospective student's visit
profitable" was cited as contributing
to the problem.
Other factors that drove stu
dents away from Stanford graduate
departments were the tardiness of
the University in mailing accep
tance and financial offer notifica
tions to applicants; the high cost of
living in the Stanford area â€” includ
ing the need for a car; and the rules
against applying to more than one
department.
The survey did not examine
records of professional schools,
such as the business, law and medi
cal schools because so few profes
sional school students receive aid,
the survey said.
