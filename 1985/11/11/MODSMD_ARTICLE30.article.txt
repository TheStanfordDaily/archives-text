# Hockey Hacks Berkeley 1-0

### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
BERKELEY — Nothing could
be more satisfying for a Stanford
team getting ready for the
NCAA playoffs than ending the
regular season with a win over
UC-Berkeley.
And that is just what the Card
inal field hockey team got Friday
by defeating the Bears 1-0.
Oddly, however, the game
may have suffered because of
the Stanford-Cal rivalry. "It was
intense," Cardinal Coach Sheryf™
Johnson said. "Too intense."
The victory, Stanford's ninth
straight, upped the Cardinal's
record to 10-3-1. Their North
ern Pacific Conference record of
6-1-1 puts them far out in front
of second-place finishers Cal and

San Jose State, both of whom
finished with 3-4-1 marks.
The play was not superb, but
neither team broke down and the
match ended just as the first
Berkeley-Stanford matchup had
earlier in the season, in a 1-0
Stanford win. "They stuck it
out," Johnson said.
Word was received last night
about the location of Stanford's
first-round playoff games. The
Cardinal will travel to North
western University in Chicago to
compete with lowa and North
western in a single-elimination
tournament.
On Saturday, Stanford will
face an lowa team that the Card
inal beat a year ago here in a
double-overtime contest. If
Stanford can survive that match,
it will encounter Northwestern
on Sunday.
