Beirut Hostages Issue Appeal
BEIRUT — Four American hostages in Lebanon, saying their
captors are "growing impatient," appealed to President Reagan
Friday to abandon "quiet diplomacy" and negotiate with their kidnap
pers for their freedom.
In an open letter to Reagan, Associated Press Bureau Chief Terry
Anderson, Thomas Sutherland, dean of the agriculture school of the
American University of Beirut, David Jacobsen, administrator of the
American University Hospital and the Rev. Lawrence Jenko, head of
Catholic Relief Services in Lebanon, said they had been told that a
fifth hostage, William Buckley, U.S. Embassy political officer, is
dead.
In Washington Friday, White House spokesman Larry Speakes
reiterated U.S. policy of not "negotiating" with terrorists, saying
Reagan's stance "has not" and "will not change."
Islamic Jihad, a shadowy Shiite fundamentalist group that has
claimed responsibility for abducting the Americans as well as other
westerners, has demanded the release of 17 Arabs held in Kuwait
following the December 1983 bombings of American, French and
Kuwaiti installations there as a condition for freeing the hostages.
Five people were killed in those attacks.
Kuwait has refused to release any of the 17, and it is not clear
what effect any U.S. negotiating effort might have on Kuwait.
Bogota Siege Provokes Protest
BOGOTA, Colombia — Surviving judges of last week's guerrilla
assault on Colombia's Palace of Justice and most relatives of slain Su
preme Court justices boycotted a memorial Roman Catholic Mass
called yesterday by the government, reflecting mounting public
protest against its handling of the emergency.
In an address at the end of the service, President Belisario Betan
cur acknowledged the criticism but said the results ultimately would
strengthen the democratic rule of law in Colombia. "The choice is
between democracy and terrorism, between law and lawlessness,
between liberty and fear," said the 62-year-old Conservative presi
dent.
The decision to rush heavily armed government troops into the
rebel-occupied courthouse within hours of its seizure has provoked
protests from the legal community, university students and many
poorer Colombians sympathetic to the leftist guerrillas' cause.
These outcries have shattered the initial appearance of national
solidarity behind Betancur after the two-day siege ended Thursday
with the deaths of 60 or 70 hostages or bystanders as well as 30 or
40 members of the Ml 9 movement that seized the palace.
After yesterday's mass, in an impromptu encounter with
reporters on the steps of the presidential mansion, Justice Minister
Enrique Parejo said the government had tried to talk to the guerrillas
after they seized the court Wednesday morning, but ordered the
building stormed after becoming convinced that they did not want a
dialogue and intended to kill the judges whom they were holding
hostage.
Soviets Rip Yurchenko Report
MONTREAL — The Soviet Consulate yesterday denounced a
report that KGB officer Vitaly Yurchenko secretly met with a Soviet
diplomat's wife here last month and begged her to defect to the
United States as "dirty lies" aimed at spoiling Soviet-Canadian rela
tions.
The Los Angeles Times report, which said the Central Intelli
gence Agency brought Yurchenko to a meeting with Valentina
Yereskovsky, the wife of the Soviet consul general, was an insult "to
all Soviet women who stay abroad with their diplomat husbands," the
statement said.
Yurchenko, who had been in CIA hands since he sought American
asylum in August, became depressed after Yereskovsky spurned
him at the meeting and soon decided to return to Soviet hands, the
report quoted Administration sources as saying.
The sources described the Montreal meeting as one of many CIA
blunders in the handling of Yurchenko, who the CIA said Friday had
been the KGB's No. 2 official for North American espionage.
Kasparov Captures Chess Title
MOSCOW — Gary Kasparov, a 22-year-old chess genius from the
southern Soviet city of Baku, scored a dazzling, last-minute victory
Saturday night to become the youngest world champion in history.
With 15 minutes left on the clock at the end of the final game of the
championship match, Kasparov whisked through a series of moves
that seemed to stun defending champion Anatoly Karpov, leaving
chess fans aghast and delighted. Karpov, 34, the Soviet who has held
the world title for 10 years, resigned after the 42nd move, caught in
a trap that chess grandmasters here described as brilliant.
"It was a victory worthy of a champion," said Soviet grandmaster
Mark Taimanov. "It was a very complicated struggle from beginning
to end — one of the most beautiful games of this match."
Reagan Radios Speech to USSR
WASHINGTON — President Reagan told the Soviet people Sat
urday that Americans "do not threaten your nation and never will"
and he called for increased contacts between the superpowers, in
cluding annual summit meetings.
In an address broadcast to the nation and beamed to parts of the
Soviet Union by the Voice of America, Reagan struck an exception
ally conciliatory tone just a week before he departs for his meeting in
Geneva, Switzerland, with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
He urged "expanded contact between our two great societies,
wherever there is mutual interest," and said he hoped the Nov. 19-
20 Geneva talks will be "fruitful" and lead to more meetings.
He told the radio audience that "we should open a dialogue be
tween our nations, so leaders of each country would have the same
chance to communicate to the people of the other on television."
Violence in Sri Lanka Escalates
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Security forces were on maximum alert
yesterday in Sri Lanka after at least 39 persons died in ethnic vio
lence in the country's northern and eastern sections.
Security forces killed 33 Tamil separtist guerrillas in the Trin
comalee district and destroyed four guerrilla hideouts in the eastern
section of the island, official sources said yesterday.
In Sittha, near Trincomalee, rebels yesterday attacked a bus car
rying civilans, killing six persons and seriously injuring at least 11.
In Colombo and its suburbs, paramilitary units and police patroled
streets and mounted roadblocks in the alert operation code-named
"Operation Thunderbolt."

United States as "dirty lies" aimed at spoiling Soviet-Canadian rela
tions.
The Los Angeles Times report, which said the Central Intelli
gence Agency brought Yurchenko to a meeting with Valentina
Yereskovsky, the wife of the Soviet consul general, was an insult "to
all Soviet women who stay abroad with their diplomat husbands," the
statement said.
Yurchenko, who had been in CIA hands since he sought American
asylum in August, became depressed after Yereskovsky spurned
him at the meeting and soon decided to return to Soviet hands, the
report quoted Administration sources as saying.
The sources described the Montreal meeting as one of many CIA
blunders in the handling of Yurchenko, who the CIA said Friday had
been the KGB's No. 2 official for North American espionage.
Kasparov Captures Chess Title
MOSCOW — Gary Kasparov, a 22-year-old chess genius from the
southern Soviet city of Baku, scored a dazzling, last-minute victory
Saturday night to become the youngest world champion in history.
With 15 minutes left on the clock at the end of the final game of the
championship match, Kasparov whisked through a series of moves
that seemed to stun defending champion Anatoly Karpov, leaving
chess fans aghast and delighted. Karpov, 34, the Soviet who has held
the world title for 10 years, resigned after the 42nd move, caught in
a trap that chess grandmasters here described as brilliant.
"It was a victory worthy of a champion," said Soviet grandmaster
Mark Taimanov. "It was a very complicated struggle from beginning
to end — one of the most beautiful games of this match."
Reagan Radios Speech to USSR
WASHINGTON — President Reagan told the Soviet people Sat
urday that Americans "do not threaten your nation and never will"
and he called for increased contacts between the superpowers, in
cluding annual summit meetings.
In an address broadcast to the nation and beamed to parts of the
Soviet Union by the Voice of America, Reagan struck an exception
ally conciliatory tone just a week before he departs for his meeting in
Geneva, Switzerland, with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
He urged "expanded contact between our two great societies,
wherever there is mutual interest," and said he hoped the Nov. 19-
20 Geneva talks will be "fruitful" and lead to more meetings.
He told the radio audience that "we should open a dialogue be
tween our nations, so leaders of each country would have the same
chance to communicate to the people of the other on television."
Violence in Sri Lanka Escalates
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Security forces were on maximum alert
yesterday in Sri Lanka after at least 39 persons died in ethnic vio
lence in the country's northern and eastern sections.
Security forces killed 33 Tamil separtist guerrillas in the Trin
comalee district and destroyed four guerrilla hideouts in the eastern
section of the island, official sources said yesterday.
In Sittha, near Trincomalee, rebels yesterday attacked a bus car
rying civilans, killing six persons and seriously injuring at least 11.
In Colombo and its suburbs, paramilitary units and police patroled
streets and mounted roadblocks in the alert operation code-named
"Operation Thunderbolt."
Beirut Hostages Issue Appeal
BEIRUT — Four American hostages in Lebanon, saying their
captors are "growing impatient," appealed to President Reagan
Friday to abandon "quiet diplomacy" and negotiate with their kidnap
pers for their freedom.
In an open letter to Reagan, Associated Press Bureau Chief Terry
Anderson, Thomas Sutherland, dean of the agriculture school of the
American University of Beirut, David Jacobsen, administrator of the
American University Hospital and the Rev. Lawrence Jenko, head of
Catholic Relief Services in Lebanon, said they had been told that a
fifth hostage, William Buckley, U.S. Embassy political officer, is
dead.
In Washington Friday, White House spokesman Larry Speakes
reiterated U.S. policy of not "negotiating" with terrorists, saying
Reagan's stance "has not" and "will not change."
Islamic Jihad, a shadowy Shiite fundamentalist group that has
claimed responsibility for abducting the Americans as well as other
westerners, has demanded the release of 17 Arabs held in Kuwait
following the December 1983 bombings of American, French and
Kuwaiti installations there as a condition for freeing the hostages.
Five people were killed in those attacks.
Kuwait has refused to release any of the 17, and it is not clear
what effect any U.S. negotiating effort might have on Kuwait.
Bogota Siege Provokes Protest
BOGOTA, Colombia — Surviving judges of last week's guerrilla
assault on Colombia's Palace of Justice and most relatives of slain Su
preme Court justices boycotted a memorial Roman Catholic Mass
called yesterday by the government, reflecting mounting public
protest against its handling of the emergency.
In an address at the end of the service, President Belisario Betan
cur acknowledged the criticism but said the results ultimately would
strengthen the democratic rule of law in Colombia. "The choice is
between democracy and terrorism, between law and lawlessness,
between liberty and fear," said the 62-year-old Conservative presi
dent.
The decision to rush heavily armed government troops into the
rebel-occupied courthouse within hours of its seizure has provoked
protests from the legal community, university students and many
poorer Colombians sympathetic to the leftist guerrillas' cause.
These outcries have shattered the initial appearance of national
solidarity behind Betancur after the two-day siege ended Thursday
with the deaths of 60 or 70 hostages or bystanders as well as 30 or
40 members of the Ml 9 movement that seized the palace.
After yesterday's mass, in an impromptu encounter with
reporters on the steps of the presidential mansion, Justice Minister
Enrique Parejo said the government had tried to talk to the guerrillas
after they seized the court Wednesday morning, but ordered the
building stormed after becoming convinced that they did not want a
dialogue and intended to kill the judges whom they were holding
hostage.
