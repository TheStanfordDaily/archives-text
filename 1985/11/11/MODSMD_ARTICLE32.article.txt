## U.S. Holds Little Hope for Summit Accord 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan and So
viet leader Mikhail Gorbachev are so far from
agreement on any major issues that their
meeting next week will probably end without a
joint declaration, Administration officials said
yesterday.
Secretary of State George Shultz indicated
that the two sides may simply issue separate
statements, which is an outcome that would
demonstrate disagreement rather than agree
ment.
National security adviser Robert McFarlane
was quoted as saying flatly: "There will be no
communique. I think that is pandering. These
two countries are starting something; they are
not finishing something."

If the warnings are borne out, the Geneva,
Switzerland, meeting would be the first U.S.-
Soviet summit with no joint declaration on points
of agreement since 1960, when Soviet leader
Nikita Khrushchev walked out to protest U.S.
surveillance flights over Soviet territory.
The Administration presented a proposed
draft communique to the Soviets last week when
Shultz met with Gorbachev in Moscow, but the
Kremlin objected "to virtually every item," arms
control adviser Paul Nitze said.
"It is really a difficult thing to get an agree
ment at this time between the Soviet Union and
ourselves on the full range of subjects that we
discussed at Moscow," Nitze said in a television
interview.

"Rather than have a communique full of their
positions and our positions, perhaps it's better
not to have that kind of a long, complicated docu
ment."
The officials' comments appeared aimed partly
at lowering public hopes of results from the two
day summit, which is scheduled to begin Nov.
19.
McFarlane, who spoke to a few reporters Sat
urday in the guise of "a senior administration offi
cial" but was identified yesterday by other aides,
was bluntest.
He was quoted as saying that the two
countries agreed during last week's meetings in
Moscow that no communique was possible.
