WASHINGTON — Secretary of
State George Shultz said yesterday
that Ukrainian sailor Miroslav Med
vid may have decided to return to
the Soviet Union because of fear of
reprisals against his parents.
As Medvid's ship steamed
through the open ocean toward
home, Shultz defended the Admin
istration's handling of the ship
jumping incident, and said that
everyone involved, including the
Justice Department, had concluded
that Medvid had changed his mind
about defecting.
The incident created problems
for U.S.-Soviet relations shortly
before the summit between Presi
dent Reagan and Soviet leader Mik
hail Gorbachev in Geneva Nov. 19-
20, and drew sharp protests from
the Republican Party's right wing,
led by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).
The 120,000-ton grain-carrying
freighter Marshal Konev was

wanted to come to the United
States and after he was subjected
to whatever he was subjected to
aboard that ship, he changed his
mind," Shultz said on CBS' "Face
the Nation."
Shultz noted that Medvid
"repeatedly referred to Mama and
Papa, and he talked about life. I
have no basis for being explicit
about what threats may have been
suggested to him. But it is clear
that he had his mother and father on
his mind, and, all things considered,
decided what he wanted to do."
Shultz conceded, as he had done
previously, that it was a mistake to
return Medvid to the ship against
his will after he had twice jumped
into the Mississippi.
The 25-year-old Medvid was
returned to his vessel by Border
Patrol agents after jumping ship at
Belle Chasse, La., on Oct. 24.
