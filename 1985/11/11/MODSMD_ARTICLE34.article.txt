Midair Collision
CLIFFSIDE PARK, N.J. — Two planes —
a twin-engine propeller-driven aircraft and a
business jet capable of carrying more than a
dozen people — collided over New Jersey op
posite Manhattan last night, setting five build
ings afire and scattering wreckage over
several towns.
At least two bodies, apparently from one of
the aircraft, were found in a street in the ad
joining community of Fairview, about five
blocks from the fire.
There were fears that the death toll could
climb much higher.
Firefighters were trying tc determine how
many people were aboard the jet and how
many may have been trapped in their homes
when the jet crashed into the buildings, ignit
ing them.
The jet crashed into a street of small frame
and brick buildings, mostly residential, hitting
two two-story brick homes. Children were
playing in the front yard of one of the houses.
But when they heard an explosion — ap
parently from the midair collision — they fled
down the street.
Some of the buildings were leveled. Two
residential duplexes were destroyed, a meat
market was heavily damaged and a third house
caught fire. Two cars in front of one building
were blown up. Firefighters fought the five
structure blaze for more than three hours
before it was declared under control. The
fireball and its dense black smoke were visible
for miles.
Royal Couple Visits
WASHINGTON — Charles and Diana, the
prince and princess of Wales, arrived inWash

ington Saturday and plunged into a breakneck
schedule that ran from a visit to a hospice for
the terminally ill to a showbiz-and-society din
ner hosted by President Reagan.
Charles, the 36-year-old heir to Britain's
throne, admitted that he was still "trying to get
over the jet lag" after flying here from
Australia with an overnight rest in Hawaii.
But his 24-year-old consort, Diana, showed
no signs of fatigue, despite reports in the
Australian press that she had tired during their
10-day visit there — leading to rumors, dis
missed by a royal spokesman, that she might
be pregnant for a third time.
The coming of the royal couple has thrown
Washington's elite — the political and social
circles that make up the unofficial aristocracy
of this democratic capital — into a tizzy for
weeks.
For them, the high points of the prince and
princess' three-day visit are the parties, and
President and Nancy Reagan kicked off the so

cial round with White House pomp and Holly
wood glitter.
The 81 guests at the Reagans' dinner-dance
included a cross-section of America's own ver
sion of royalty: money, show-business and the
arts.
Jewish Group Blamed
LOS ANGELES — The FBI said Friday it
believes the Jewish Defense League was re
sponsible for the Oct. 11 bomb blast in South
ern California that killed Arab rights leader
Alex Odeh, and for at least two other recent
terrorist incidents on the East Coast.
"We are attributing the three bombings to
the JDL," Lane Bonner, a supervisory special
agent at FBI headquarters in Washington,
D.C., said in a telephone interview. "There
are similarities in all three bombings, but we
can't comment on details, because they're all
still under investigation."
