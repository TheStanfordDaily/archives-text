Winter Storms Strike
Heavy snowfall in Northern California
knocked out power in parts of the Sierra
Nevada, closed roads and apparently stranded
six hikers yesterday near Yosemite National
Park.
The National Weather Service issued a win
ter storm warning for most of the Sierra,
warning drivers to stay off the roads and citing
strong gusty winds over the passes and ridges
and at least three feet of snow in some areas.
Rain pelted lower elevations and caused
flooding on some roads in the San Francisco
Bay area, including a section of Highway 101
near the San Francisco International Airport.
A spokeswoman for the Tuolomne County

sheriff's office said last night that a four-person
search squad was looking for a couple east of
the city of Tuolomne that had been reported
missing the snow. A family of four that had
been reported missing earlier was located by
deputies and was safe.
Travelers advisories were posted for the
mountains of northwest California as well as
most areas over the north central and north
east part of the state.
"Persons are urged to avoid driving into
these areas," the National Weather Service
warned. "Travel into the Sierra Nevada is
strongly discouraged. Travel to any mountain
areas should be done so with much care and
planning. Emergency equipment, survival gear
and chains should be on hand in your vehicle."

Westlands Win Water
WASHINGTON â€” With a nudge from a
former White House official, the Interior De
partment is preparing to concede millions of
dollars worth of federally subsidized irrigation
water to more than 150,000 acres of California
farmland never authorized by Congress, ac
cording to Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) and
others familiar with the case.
The decision, expected to be offered as part
of a negotiated court settlement with the
Westlands Water District near Fresno, would
reverse the government's longstanding posi
tion that the land was illegally placed under ir
rigation more than two decades ago and has no
claim to federal water.
