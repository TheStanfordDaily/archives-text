# Kennedy Defends Booklet
## Also discusses Kaplan report on KZSU 
### DAVID EMERSON Staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy said
that he was "probably in error" to have dis
tributed a booklet outlining the history of the
South African conflict, but he defended the
publication as a "simple, quick and unbiased"
presentation of important backround ma
terial, speaking on a KZSU radio program to
be aired today at 7 p.m.
Besides the booklet, Kennedy also dis
cussed the Kaplan report, labor negotiations,
the Coffee House and the future of fraterni
ties on campus.
While discussing criticisms of the booklet,
entitled "Stanford and South Africa," Ken
nedy said that there was "very little under
standing" of the publication's purpose. Al
though it was not error free, the booklet at
tempted to "provide some background for
people who had very little in this subject," he
said.
Concerning the recently released Kaplan
report on alleged police brutality, Kennedy
said that charges of possible "conflict of inter
est" against Law Prof. John Kaplan were un
founded. "If anything (Kennedy's friendship
with Kaplan), would make IKaplan] more
conscientious" in the preparation of the
report, Kennedy said.
Kennedy pledged to "cooperate in any way
we can" with the ASSU Senate's independent
investigation into the events surrounding the
sit-in arrests.
On the recent labor negotiations with the
United Stanford Workers, Kennedy said that
he was "a little suprised" by the worker's ac
ceptance of the University's final contract of
fer.
He said that "economically and in every
other respect" he considered the new contract
fair.
As to why the union and the University have
had somewhat poor relations in the past, Ken
nedy said that it is "not unusual for contract
negotiations to be somewhat acrimonious.
Both sides are positioning themselves and of
ten union leaderships are trying to increase the
loyalty of the rank and file."
He said that the result is one with which
"the members will ultimately be satisfied,"
and that therefore the University can "go on
from here to produce a more harmonious re

lationship" with the union.
On student protests over losing control of
the Coffee House, Kennedy said "students
were a little late in realizing what was hap
pening. The time to complain was before the
bids were submitted." He also stated that the
history of the student-run Coffee House was
"not very encouraging."
"What we want is a Coffee House which is
well managed and in which the students have
a good deal of participation — but that doesn't
require the contract be with a student organi
zation," he said.
As for the possibility of contracting out
University Food Service to Saga Corp. or some
other organization, Kennedy said that Stan
ford may "try another experiment or two" in
the future, but is not likely to contract out the
entire food service, or even a large part of it.
When questioned regarding the future of
fraternities and their role on campus, Ken
nedy responded that it depended on what the
fraternities themselves decide to do.
"The best performances are pretty
creditable; the worst, pretty disappointing. In
the long run, the future of fraternities will be
determined by whether there are more of the
first kind or more of the second," he said.
"I'd like to think the situation can im
prove," Kennedy added.
On the other hand, Kennedy is "very en
couraged" about the future of theme houses
on campus. He said that they have recently
"been succeeding better in their stated pur
pose; the doubt about them and the contro
versy present earlier is much less evident
now."
Responding to allegations of cheating in
Prof. Philip Zimbardo's Psychology 1 class in
the spring, Kennedy said that "we may very
well need some revisions in the way we
teach, or examine or grade in some courses,
but I don't think we need any revisions in the
Honor Code."
"The reason we have an honor code is that
we believe it really is up individuals to regu
late their own academic conduct," he said.
"The test of whether an honor code is
working is not whether there is a level of
cheating — there is always going to be some
finite level — but whether it is the best sys
tem in terms of all of our values.
"I believe it is," he said.
