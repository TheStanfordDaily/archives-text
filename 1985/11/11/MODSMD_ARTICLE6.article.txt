As students head off to classes
this morning, Stanford will be
heading into its second century as
a university, having received its
founding grant from Leland and
Jane Stanford 100 years ago
today.
Stating that the objective of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
was "to qualify students for per
sonal success and direct useful
ness in life" and "to promote the
public welfare by exercising an in
fluence in behalf of humanity and

civilization," the grant was signed
three days later at the Stanfords'
Nob Hill mansion by the original
24 members of the Board of
Trustees.
The grant also established the
initial endowment of the Univer
sity — now estimated at $1.8 bil
lion — based on three plots of
land, including the 8,800-acre
Palo Alto Farm on which the
campus sits today.
Less then two years later, the
cornerstone was laid at what is
now Building 60, and construction
on the Inner Quad was completed
four years later in 1891. It was
that year in which David Starr

Jordan, a biologist and president
of Indiana University, became the
first president of Stanford, a posi
tion he would hold for 22 years
until his retirement.
Jordan was followed by John
Casper Branner, the man for
whom the 61-year-old dormitory
is named, as the University's
second president.
1891 also marked the arrival of
the first group of students on the
Farm — 465 men and women
who had to pay no tuition to
receive instruction from the initial
15 faculty members. Encina Hall,
