# Farm Begins 2nd Century

As students head off to classes
this morning, Stanford will be
heading into its second century as
a university, having received its
founding grant from Leland and
Jane Stanford 100 years ago
today.
Stating that the objective of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
was "to qualify students for per
sonal success and direct useful
ness in life" and "to promote the
public welfare by exercising an in
fluence in behalf of humanity and

civilization," the grant was signed
three days later at the Stanfords'
Nob Hill mansion by the original
24 members of the Board of
Trustees.
The grant also established the
initial endowment of the Univer
sity — now estimated at $1.8 bil
lion — based on three plots of
land, including the 8,800-acre
Palo Alto Farm on which the
campus sits today.
Less then two years later, the
cornerstone was laid at what is
now Building 60, and construction
on the Inner Quad was completed
four years later in 1891. It was
that year in which David Starr

Jordan, a biologist and president
of Indiana University, became the
first president of Stanford, a posi
tion he would hold for 22 years
until his retirement.
Jordan was followed by John
Casper Branner, the man for
whom the 61-year-old dormitory
is named, as the University's
second president.
1891 also marked the arrival of
the first group of students on the
Farm — 465 men and women
who had to pay no tuition to
receive instruction from the initial
15 faculty members. Encina Hall,
now an administrative building, was
designated as the residence for
men, while women were housed at
Roble Hall. Faculty members were
housed in 10 clapboard houses on
Alvarado Road.
Almost immediately after classes
began at the Univeristy, the Greek
system was founded. It consisted of
eight fraternities and approximately
100 students by the end of the Uni
versity's first year.
By 1903 there were 17 fraterni
ties, a number that would decrease
to 12 during the '70s before experi
encing the current rejuvenation of
Greek interest. Phi Delta Theta,
one of 19 fraternities recognized
today by the University, was the
first housed fraternity.
The University also recognizes
seven unhoused sororities today,
after lifting a 33-year ban on the or
ganizations in 1977. Sororities were
discontinued in 1944 after a vote by
the female student body. The vote
was called because the Board of
Trustees stated that there was
"serious disunity" between women
in Greek organizations and "hall
women."
Student government also got its

start in 1891, with the founding of
the Associated Students of Stanford
Univeristy.
But students at the time had
more than just academics and
promoting public welfare on their
minds. On March 19, 1892, a group
of ambitious Stanford students,
decked out in cardinal uniforms,
trekked to Haight Street Field in
San Francisco where they defeated
the Golden Bears of UC-Berkeley
14-10 in the first Big Game.
Stanford Stadium, the cite of this
year's Big Game, was constructed
in 1921 and Stanford received a 42-
7 thrashing by Cal in the inaugural
game at the stadium. Today, Stan
ford leads the rivalry with Cal, 41-
36-10.
The Daily Palo Alto — now The
Stanford Daily — first hit the
streets on Sept. 19, 1892, and The
Chaparral was founded on Oct. 5,
1899.
While the University continued to
grow after the turn of the century,
the 1906 earthquake, measuring
8.3 on the Richter scale, struck the
Bay Area and the University.
The quake caused more than $2
million in damages to the Univer
sity, destroying the new library and
dropping the arch at the entrance of
the Quad.
