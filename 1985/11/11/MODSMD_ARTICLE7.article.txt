# You Can Espresso Yourself Now
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
Students are gathered around small tables,
sipping steamy beverages and conversing freely
while music plays in the background, creating a
casual atmosphere. Outside the cold rain pelts
bundled pedestrians.
But this isn't the Coffee House, the image you
might have been creating in your mind oased on
this description.
Such was the scene at the Bechtel Interna
tional Center this weekend for the opening of the
Espresso Bar, a new student-run coffee and
pastry bar. The Espresso Bar will be open for
two more weekends, Thursday through Satur
day from 8 to 11:30 p.m.
At the Espresso Bar, the smell of homemade
coffee and baked goods welcomes patrons at the
door, and fresh flowers decorate each table.
While sipping cappuccino and munching on a
scone or brownie, people in the main area are
entertained by the strumming of the guitarist,
senior Gary Rosenberg. A cozy room off to the
side with comfortable couches on which to sit
and converse provides a more quiet spot.
Bechtel provides enough air space for both
smokers and non-smokers to feel comfortable,
rather than being relegated to separate sections
of the bar.
Junior Lee Cline. who, along with sophomores

Debbie Milkowski and Doug Welle, is responsible
for the organization of the Espresso Bar, said it
was founded partially out of "reaction to the
takeover (by the University) of the old Coffee
House."
Many of the people who used to frequent the
Coffee House have turned up at the I-Center,
Cline said. Many of the Espresso Bar volunteers
also used to run or work at the old Coffee
House, including Cline herself.
However, she said that they are not in "direct
competition" with the Coffee House.

'It's even nicer than the
other Coffee House.'

"We are stressing a place to hang out, which is
not really what the Coffee House empha
sizes. ... It is a different type of place," she
said.
The people at the I-Center have been
"wonderful," according to Cline, and are letting
Cline and her associates occupy the space free of
charge. However, the Espresso Bar still needs a
permanent location.
Cline said that the undertaking is enormous
"especially when you're a student," but she em

phasized that students need a place they can call
their own.
"People are having fun right now, and that's
great," she said, glancing over to one of the oc
cupied tables.
The gloomy Saturday night weather did not
put a damper on the spirits of the students enjoy
ing the atmosphere at the Espresso Bar.
"It's even nicer than the other Coffee House,"
said junior Susan Porter-Shirley. "It is very
relaxing and not as smoky."
Junior Danielle Cullinane agreed, adding that
the "entertainment is great."
"It's a non-Tresidder coffe* house." said
graduate student Jim DeLaHunt
Rosenberg is one of th» > any student
musicians who have volunt red their time to
play. He used to spend mui 11 of his time at the
Coffee House.
"It (the Coffee House) is no longer like
home," he said after completing his perfor
mance.
The Espresso Bar will "take some getting
used to. . . . It is less conducive to studying, but
more conducive to other things," he said, like
giving people a rare opportunity to make new
friends.
Students need "a new place of our own," he
said.
The Espresso Bar will continue to operate in
this location for the next two weekends, starting
up again Thursday night.
