# Ex-Chancellor at Berkeley Calls for College Neutrality
## 
### KELLY SUND Staff writer 
A university should not "take
a stand on non-educational mat
ters," said a former chancellor of
UC-Berkeley during a forum at
Memorial Church on Friday.
The only commitment a uni
versity should make is to aca
demic freedom, according to
Roger Heyns, the fourth
speaker in a series of forums on
"Social Responsibilities of the
Modern University," and chancel
lor of Berkeley from 1965 to
1971.
Even informal position by a
university on political or social is
sues causes the "freedom to
learn and to teach" to be
"jeopardized in subtle ways,"
Heyns said.
Such infringements on aca
demic freedom could range from
the policy for distribution of
scholarship money to the
presentation of subject matter in

classrooms, he said.
Quoting historian Richard
Hofstader from a speech given
on the Berkeley campus during
the Vietnam War, Heyns said the
nature of the university must
rely on "something less
precarious than the momentary
balance of forces in society."
The university should provide
its members with the "essential
gift ofsecurity" as they "explore
any task which will lead them to
truth,"he said.
However, Heyns also said a
modern university's dependence
on outside funding, combined
with the ability of the university
to complete research often re
quested by non-neutral parties,
makes it difficult for the univer
sity to maintain neutrality.
To minimize such outside in
fluence, university administra
tors should insist that all univer
sity dealings with the outside
world meet certain academic
criteria, he said.
