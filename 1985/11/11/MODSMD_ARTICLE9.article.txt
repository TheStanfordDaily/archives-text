Dr. Hugh McDevitt, the Joseph D. Grant pro
fessor of medical microbiology and medicine,
was named the 1985 recipient of the $100,000
Lita Annenberg Hazen Award for excellence in
clinical research last week.
His research has led to the discovery that
"genes control immune responses," and they are
identical to genes linked to major transplantation
antigens, McDevitt said.
These antigens play a key role in a patient's
acceptance or rejection of transplanted tissue.
McDevitt, who has been studying immune
response penec since the early '60s, said re

search may lead to a clinical treatment for
diseases such as multiple sclerosis, but empha
sized that any treatment would take a long time
to develop.
The development of human monoclonal an
tibodies that prevent such diseases is crucial,
McDevitt said, but he added that there are other
approaches to finding a treatment. Methods to
"down-regulate expression of genes" and thus
block expression of the immune response gene
or of the gene product are some alternatives, he
said.
McDevitt said his current and future research
will focus on developing human monoclonal an
tibodies and determining more about the nature
of the genes, their structure and their evolution.
The award was established in 1979 by Lita An

nenberg Hazen, a philanthropist who has made
many contributions to biomedial research, for
the dual purpose of honoring established re
searchers and encouraging young physicians to
enter research. Half of the $100,000 prize goes
to a young physician chosen by the winner.
"I nominate somebody and if Ithe selection
committee] thinks it's OK, it funds him,"
McDevitt said, adding that he has not yet made
his choice.
The award is made annually by the Mount
Sinai School of Medicine in New York.
McDevitt, who will become chairman of the
Medical Microbiology Department in January,
was a Stanford undergraduate and received his
medical degree from Harvard. He has been on
the faculty since 1966.
