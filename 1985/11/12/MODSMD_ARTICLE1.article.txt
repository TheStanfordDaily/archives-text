# University Celebrates Centennial

Recalling the vision and devotion of Leland and Jane
Stanford, Cornell University's president yesterday
heralded Stanford as a "world-class university" during
a convocation at Memorial Church commemorating the
centennial of the University's founding.
Frank Rhodes, president of Cornell since 1977, sug
gested that although Stanford borrowed heavily from
both Harvard and Cornell, it has "in many ways
succeeded more brilliantly than either."
Noting that Stanford "appropriated" its first presi
dent, numerous early faculty members and many of the
same founding ideals from Cornell, Rhodes recalled
that Cornell was not entirely uncooperative. The Stan
fords offered the University's first presidency to
Andrew White, Cornell's president. White declined but
recommended his protege, David Starr Jordan of the
University of Indiana, to whom he then wired "decline
no offer from California until you hear from me,"
Rhodes said.
It was through Jordan's leadership that the character
of the University was shaped. Because "the faculty
was the glory of old Cornell," Jordan assembled much

of his faculty from Cornell, according to
Rhodes. So many of Stanford's faculty
members came from Cornell that at one
time Alvarado Street was dubbed "the
Cornell colony."
Despite contrary opinions in the East,
Rhodes said Jordan shared the Stanfords'
vision in having a University that would
"serve the wrong kind of students â€” the
talented masses rather than the wealthy
elite.
"(Stanford) would be coeducational at a
time when single-sex colleges were the
norm; non-sectarian when most private
institutions were still affiliated with a spe
cific chuch or religious denomination. It
would be broadly practical. . . when most
colleges still offered a narrow traditional
curriculum," Rhodes said.
He then singled out four other individ
uals to whom he ascribes Stanford's suc
cess: Wallace Sterling, Stanford's fifth
president; Frederick Terman, Sterling's
vice-president and provost; Richard
Lyman, Stanford's seventh president and
current president of the Rockefeller
Foundation; and University President
Donald Kennedy.
Rhodes credited Sterling with greatly
increasing the student body and faculty
after World War 11, initiating what became

the Stanford Overseas Studies Program
and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter and setting and achieving high goals of
fund raising for the University.
Terman, the "father of Silicon Valley,
created the modern Stanford by recogniz
ing the ties the modern university must
have with business and industry and by
creating "steeples of excellence," small
groups of faculty that bring national
prominence to the University in certain
areas, according to Rhodes.
Lyman, president of the University
from 1970 to 1980, raised the funds for
the Terman Engineering Center and chan
neled "the activist sentiments (of the '70s)
more productively," Rhodes said.
Kennedy, Rhodes said, has continued
Lyman's excellence at Stanford by his
deep commmitment to the humanities and
his strengthening of the University's ties
to business and industry.
Rhodes cited four qualities he felt con
tributed to Stanford's excellence: a sense
of vision rooted in reality; a commitment
to excellence; an ability to share dreams
with others; and a willingness to take
risks.
Before Rhodes spoke, students from
Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA)
protested the University's investments in
companies doing business in South Africa
and handed out literature encouraging
passersby to write letters of protest to
Kennedy.

Realizing the University's large fund
raising push for the centennial of the Uni
versity's opening in 1991, SOSA repre
sentatives said they hope the celebration
will not be funded by profits from corpora
tions doing business in South Africa.
Another perspective on the Stanford vi
sion was addressed at a Branner Hall
luncheon yesterday in which the origin of
large-scale philanthropy of 19th century
millionaires and "robber barons" was
linked to the Stanfords.
Don Fehrenbacher, professor of his
tory and American studies emeritus, told
a group that included a number of Stanford
trustees, board members of the Stan
ford Associates and the Stanford Alumni
Association, that the Stanfords should be
credited for the subsequent philanthropy
of Andrew Carnegie and John Rockefeller.
In his talk, "Stanford University: A
Legacy from the Gilded Age," Fehrenbac
her said Carnegie was "deeply im
pressed" by the University's founding in
that it was "perhaps the greatest sum
ever given by an individual for any pur
pose."
Fehrenbacher also emphasized the im
portance of the Stanfords' bequest, noting
that it was most of his wealth and"it was a
gift made during his lifetime, not a be
quest that would take place after his
death."
