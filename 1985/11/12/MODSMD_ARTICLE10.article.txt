## No Bowl Bid for Stanford Police 
### 
When my coed intramural football team was
playing the business school a couple of weeks
ago, one of their players tackled one of ours by
pushing him from behind. It was obvious that
there should have been a penalty on the play, but
the referee did not make a call. I complained
about the blind officiating, but the referee still
refused to call a penalty, saying, "I'll call holding,
but I'm going to be lax on unnecessary rough
ness."

• Compliance pain holds, Vulcan nerve pinches,
strip searches, etc. — all forms of illegal proce
dure. The penalty for this infraction is usually
five yards and down over. However, this does
not seem to be an appropriately stiff sentence
given the nature of the fouls committed by the
police. A wise referee would invoke the illegal
use of the hands rule on these methods and
would march the police back 10 yards.
• Breaking the wrist of a Peninsula Times-
Tribune photographer whose field pass
wasn't recognized by police at a recent
Stanford football game — pass interference.
This is a most serious penalty, as it should be
when the victim suffers a broken wrist and espe
cially since it came at the hands of the police. In
pro football, it's an automatic first down at the
scene of the crime for the opposition. In college
football, it's 15 yards and an automatic first
down.
There is no excuse for such a brutal injury in
any situation, let alone because there was a mix
up in the color of the reporter's press pass. It
seems as though there was a breakdown in com
munication in the Stanford police secondary on
this one. • • • -><

This is the type of ridiculous standard we see
in another realm of University life. Consider the
following incidents in which violations have gone
unpenalized:
• Bodily abuse to civil disobedience protesters
sitting in at Old Union — this is unnecessary
roughness. Philosophically speaking, the rules
have the primary goal of preventing injuries.
Such flagrant direct personal fouls which
knowingly inflict pain on students deserve the
most severe judgment — 15 yards and an auto
matic first down for the other team.
We expect the police to have higher ethical
standards than biz school students. We have to
be able to trust the police with authority. We do
not have to trust biz school students. Aren't the
police accountable to us, the people they are
supposed to serve? How about applying the Fun
damental Standard to them?
Coach Donald Kennedy (University presi
dent), however, does not seem to agree that a
penalty should be assessed to his team. Interest
ingly, Coach Kennedy is also the referee in this
case. So, as acting referee as well as head coach,
he has exercised his prerogative to take no dis
ciplinary action.
Team captain Marvin Herrington (Stanford
police chief) has pledged that the team will play
with less of the knock-'em-down, beat-'em-up
style of football that former Chicago Bears
linebacker Dick Butkus made famous. This
remains to be seen. We heard the same sort of
thing from the biz school.

By the way, is there a rule to eject a player or
to kick a person off the team when he commits
too many penalties? If not, there should be.
Surely some of the Stanford policemen are
suspect on these grounds.
• Slugging and clubbing fans who wanted to
celebrate Stanford's victory in Big Game last
year — unsportsmanlike conduct and unneces
sary roughness. Raining on sports lovers' parade
with such violence incurs the wrath of football
rulemakers to the tune of 15 yards. Beating up
fans is never to be encouraged. Lighten up,
guys.
• Taking forever to release a report on the inci
dents at Old Union — delay of game. The Uni
versity's strategy on controversial matters

seems to be to stall as long as possible before
saying anything. This is so that when they hedge
on moral and ethical issues — which they in
evitably do — the negative consequences will be
somewhat tempered as they are diluted over
time. This phenomenon in football led to the ad
vent of the five-yard delay-of-game penalty.
We've seen the delay-of-game syndrome
plaguing the University's decision-making
process before. The Board of Trustees has in
curred enough delay-of-game penalties on the di
vestment issue since the '70s to stretch to the
moon and back four times.
• Overall inaction and footdragging on divest
ment — grounds for NCAA probation. Ethics in
sports come first. If Stanford cannot get on the
ball and get out of South Africa, then there
should be strict sanctions placed on the Univer
sity.
At the rate the police and the administration
are going, one would expect that they would suf
fer from continually lousy field position. They
seem to accrue so many penalties that they
would always be bottled up inside their own five
yard line. Obviously, in this sense, they risk a
safety — and it is our safety which is at stake.

By my tally, the score is in the neighborhood
of: Abuse, Brutality and Other Evils 48, Stanford
Police 0. Coach Kennedy takes full responsibility
for the loss at the post-game press conference,
but still defends himself and his coaching staff.
He proposes putting names on the police's jer
seys as a new game plan for next week. Football
analysts question the value of such a paltry
reform for a team that seems to suffer some
very serious, fundamental flaws.

By the way, is there a rule to eject a player or
to kick a person off the team when he commits
too many penalties? If not, there should be.
Surely some of the Stanford policemen are
suspect on these grounds.
• Slugging and clubbing fans who wanted to
celebrate Stanford's victory in Big Game last
year — unsportsmanlike conduct and unneces
sary roughness. Raining on sports lovers' parade
with such violence incurs the wrath of football
rulemakers to the tune of 15 yards. Beating up
fans is never to be encouraged. Lighten up,
guys.
• Taking forever to release a report on the inci
dents at Old Union — delay of game. The Uni
versity's strategy on controversial matters

seems to be to stall as long as possible before
saying anything. This is so that when they hedge
on moral and ethical issues — which they in
evitably do — the negative consequences will be
somewhat tempered as they are diluted over
time. This phenomenon in football led to the ad
vent of the five-yard delay-of-game penalty.
We've seen the delay-of-game syndrome
plaguing the University's decision-making
process before. The Board of Trustees has in
curred enough delay-of-game penalties on the di
vestment issue since the '70s to stretch to the
moon and back four times.
• Overall inaction and footdragging on divest
ment — grounds for NCAA probation. Ethics in
sports come first. If Stanford cannot get on the
ball and get out of South Africa, then there
should be strict sanctions placed on the Univer
sity.
At the rate the police and the administration
are going, one would expect that they would suf
fer from continually lousy field position. They
seem to accrue so many penalties that they
would always be bottled up inside their own five
yard line. Obviously, in this sense, they risk a
safety — and it is our safety which is at stake.

By my tally, the score is in the neighborhood
of: Abuse, Brutality and Other Evils 48, Stanford
Police 0. Coach Kennedy takes full responsibility
for the loss at the post-game press conference,
but still defends himself and his coaching staff.
He proposes putting names on the police's jer
seys as a new game plan for next week. Football
analysts question the value of such a paltry
reform for a team that seems to suffer some
very serious, fundamental flaws.
In any event, it's no bowl bid again this year
for the Stanford police.

When my coed intramural football team was
playing the business school a couple of weeks
ago, one of their players tackled one of ours by
pushing him from behind. It was obvious that
there should have been a penalty on the play, but
the referee did not make a call. I complained
about the blind officiating, but the referee still
refused to call a penalty, saying, "I'll call holding,
but I'm going to be lax on unnecessary rough
ness."

• Compliance pain holds, Vulcan nerve pinches,
strip searches, etc. — all forms of illegal proce
dure. The penalty for this infraction is usually
five yards and down over. However, this does
not seem to be an appropriately stiff sentence
given the nature of the fouls committed by the
police. A wise referee would invoke the illegal
use of the hands rule on these methods and
would march the police back 10 yards.
• Breaking the wrist of a Peninsula Times-
Tribune photographer whose field pass
wasn't recognized by police at a recent
Stanford football game — pass interference.
This is a most serious penalty, as it should be
when the victim suffers a broken wrist and espe
cially since it came at the hands of the police. In
pro football, it's an automatic first down at the
scene of the crime for the opposition. In college
football, it's 15 yards and an automatic first
down.
There is no excuse for such a brutal injury in
any situation, let alone because there was a mix
up in the color of the reporter's press pass. It
seems as though there was a breakdown in com
munication in the Stanford police secondary on
this one. • • • -><

This is the type of ridiculous standard we see
in another realm of University life. Consider the
following incidents in which violations have gone
unpenalized:
• Bodily abuse to civil disobedience protesters
sitting in at Old Union — this is unnecessary
roughness. Philosophically speaking, the rules
have the primary goal of preventing injuries.
Such flagrant direct personal fouls which
knowingly inflict pain on students deserve the
most severe judgment — 15 yards and an auto
matic first down for the other team.
We expect the police to have higher ethical
standards than biz school students. We have to
be able to trust the police with authority. We do
not have to trust biz school students. Aren't the
police accountable to us, the people they are
supposed to serve? How about applying the Fun
damental Standard to them?
Coach Donald Kennedy (University presi
dent), however, does not seem to agree that a
penalty should be assessed to his team. Interest
ingly, Coach Kennedy is also the referee in this
case. So, as acting referee as well as head coach,
he has exercised his prerogative to take no dis
ciplinary action.
Team captain Marvin Herrington (Stanford
police chief) has pledged that the team will play
with less of the knock-'em-down, beat-'em-up
style of football that former Chicago Bears
linebacker Dick Butkus made famous. This
remains to be seen. We heard the same sort of
thing from the biz school.
