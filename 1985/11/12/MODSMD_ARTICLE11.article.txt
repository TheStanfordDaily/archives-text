Lyons Should
Face Standard
The University Fundamental
Standard requires that members of
the Stanford community show
"respect for order, morality, per
sonal honor and the rights of
others, as is demanded of good
citizens." We believe that on Oct.
11, when nine students were ar
rested in Old Union after engaging
in a peaceful act of civil dis
obedience against Stanford's in
vestments in apartheid, Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons and
other administrators did not fulfill
their obligations to the Stanford
community.
Lyons was present when
the Stanford police violently man
handled the arrestees, many of
whom cried out in pain, asking to
be treated in a more humane man
ner. He and the other University
officials could have done something
to prevent police violence against
the students, but didn't.
Lyons not only showed a lack of
"respect for the rights of others,"
as is requested by the Fundamen
tal Standard, but also a lack of
compassion toward the victims of
police brutality. We think that
these actions are a serious and
reprehensible transgression of the

Fundamental Standard. If it is
legitimate to indict a student for
breaking this standard — as was
threatened against the student
protesters — then it should also be
legitimate for the Stanford Judicial
Council to investigate similar viola
tions committed by an administra
tor. No one should be immune
from standards which demand
"respect for order, morality, per
sonal honor and the rights of
others as is demanded of good
citizens." Rules should apply
equally to students as to the offi
cials who charted them and enforce
them.

Daily Missed
Point of Speech
The Daily's coverage of Vice
President of Business and Finance
William Massy's talk ("Massy
Defends Stanford Policy," Nov. 5)
is quite puzzling. First, Massy's
talk took place in the History
Building, where he was invited to
speak by our SWOPSI course on
the United States' role in South
Africa, not in Cubberley as was
reported. This is an insignificant
error, but it reflects the fact that

The Daily's coverage of Massy's
talk missed the mark in more ways
than one.
Massy's talk was newsworthy
because of the honesty with which
he defended the University's in
vestment policy. He acknowledged
that "non-investment considera
tions" are the main reason why
total divestment from corporations
doing buisness in South Africa
cannot be carried out by Stanford.
Massy stressed that the key factor
is the $120 million in "gifts" given
to Stanford each year by corpora
tions, many of which operate in
South Africa. He concluded that
the University is intimately tied to
the business world and therefore
cannot and should not risk offend
ing the "business culture" by
divesting.
Our discussion Monday evening
with Massy was significant in bring
ing us closer to the truth about the
divestment debate at this Univer
sity. Gone were assertions that
divestment will hurt the blacks,
and gone too was the administra
tion's certitude that the Sullivan
Principles are significant. This was
highlighted during the 45-minute
question-and-answer period, which
your coverage failed to mention.
Through our SWOPSI course we
have devoted tremendous energies
toward clarifying the nature of

relations between U.S. institutions
and South Africa. With regard to
the divestment debate at Stanford,
it is essential that our community
address the real issues and not
smoke screens. The Daily missed
an important opportunity to com
municate the essence of the di
vestment debate as put forth by
the administration's expert on
investment considerations.

COP Is Not
Pocketing Money
Shortly after my letter "ASSU
Must Fulfill Promises" appeared in
the Daily on Nov. 8, Council of
Presidents' members Tim Quirk
and Mike Collins showed me a
thick stack of uncashed COP pay
checks. I was wrong to say that
"they are now putting that salary
into their own pockets," and I
apologize for the unintended per
sonal slur. They plan to deposit the
money into a money market ac
count where it can earn interest
while they decide how to use it. I
will be scanning the pages of The
Daily in eager anticipation of their
decision.

officials could have done something
to prevent police violence against
the students, but didn't.
Lyons not only showed a lack of
"respect for the rights of others,"
as is requested by the Fundamen
tal Standard, but also a lack of
compassion toward the victims of
police brutality. We think that
these actions are a serious and
reprehensible transgression of the

Fundamental Standard. If it is
legitimate to indict a student for
breaking this standard — as was
threatened against the student
protesters — then it should also be
legitimate for the Stanford Judicial
Council to investigate similar viola
tions committed by an administra
tor. No one should be immune
from standards which demand
"respect for order, morality, per
sonal honor and the rights of
others as is demanded of good
citizens." Rules should apply
equally to students as to the offi
cials who charted them and enforce
them.

Daily Missed
Point of Speech
The Daily's coverage of Vice
President of Business and Finance
William Massy's talk ("Massy
Defends Stanford Policy," Nov. 5)
is quite puzzling. First, Massy's
talk took place in the History
Building, where he was invited to
speak by our SWOPSI course on
the United States' role in South
Africa, not in Cubberley as was
reported. This is an insignificant
error, but it reflects the fact that

The Daily's coverage of Massy's
talk missed the mark in more ways
than one.
Massy's talk was newsworthy
because of the honesty with which
he defended the University's in
vestment policy. He acknowledged
that "non-investment considera
tions" are the main reason why
total divestment from corporations
doing buisness in South Africa
cannot be carried out by Stanford.
Massy stressed that the key factor
is the $120 million in "gifts" given
to Stanford each year by corpora
tions, many of which operate in
South Africa. He concluded that
the University is intimately tied to
the business world and therefore
cannot and should not risk offend
ing the "business culture" by
divesting.
Our discussion Monday evening
with Massy was significant in bring
ing us closer to the truth about the
divestment debate at this Univer
sity. Gone were assertions that
divestment will hurt the blacks,
and gone too was the administra
tion's certitude that the Sullivan
Principles are significant. This was
highlighted during the 45-minute
question-and-answer period, which
your coverage failed to mention.
Through our SWOPSI course we
have devoted tremendous energies
toward clarifying the nature of

relations between U.S. institutions
and South Africa. With regard to
the divestment debate at Stanford,
it is essential that our community
address the real issues and not
smoke screens. The Daily missed
an important opportunity to com
municate the essence of the di
vestment debate as put forth by
the administration's expert on
investment considerations.

COP Is Not
Pocketing Money
Shortly after my letter "ASSU
Must Fulfill Promises" appeared in
the Daily on Nov. 8, Council of
Presidents' members Tim Quirk
and Mike Collins showed me a
thick stack of uncashed COP pay
checks. I was wrong to say that
"they are now putting that salary
into their own pockets," and I
apologize for the unintended per
sonal slur. They plan to deposit the
money into a money market ac
count where it can earn interest
while they decide how to use it. I
will be scanning the pages of The
Daily in eager anticipation of their
decision.
