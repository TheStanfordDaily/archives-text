## Kaplan Probe Shows Lack of Compassion For Police Brutality 
### 
Since my knowledge of the Oct.
11 sit-in at Old Union and its after
math is limited to what I read in the
press, I am grateful to Law Prof.
John Kaplan for his detailed report
of those events, published in
Campus Report. It is, however, the

VIEWPOINT

most disturbing document I have
read in any Stanford publication.
Aside from Kaplan's comments and
conclusions, the report is largely a
stark account of the beating, and
even worse, terrorizing of a young
man whose only crime was to cause
a minor nuisance on the Stanford
campus. Because senior Robby
Perkins went limp during arrest,
police twisted his arms almost out
of their sockets. Because he was
wearing a political button that police
claimed could be used as a weapon,
Perkins was dragged into a cell,
thrown to the floor, stripped of his
clothes and manhandled by a
policeman who, in the officer's own
words, threatened "to kill him or
break his face."
Apparently, neither Kaplan
nor University President Donald
Kennedy believes these events jus
tify a strong protest on the part of
the University. The police said that
Perkins resisted their efforts to
take his clothes off by "rolling on his
side and screaming that we were
hurting him." Kaplan concludes that
"he did wriggle and make the police
officer's job as difficult as possible."
Kennedy has since commented that
Perkins was involved in "a consid
erable struggle" with the police and
that the evidence does not sustain
the charge that he was beaten

"maliciously."
Some obvious questions come to
mind: How much damage can
anyone do with the pin attached to a
political button? Why didn't the
police simply take away the button?
Does anyone seriously expect a
terrified, helpless individual, whose
wrists are shackled, to refrain from
struggling while a group of
policemen pin him to the floor and
tear his clothes off? Can the
deliberate beating of a handcuffed
prisoner be anything but
"malicious"?
In the end, Kaplan offers sympa
thy to both sides, but fails iotritkize
police procedures that, where
Perkins was concerned, may
technically have been "lawful" but
should be unacceptable in a civilized
society. Kennedy has so far ex
pressed no outrage at what was
done to a member of this commu
nity. That Perkins is a Stanford stu
dent and black matters less than
that he is a human being who, for no
justifiable reason, was treated by
police officers as less than human.
Santa Clara County is surely a far
cry from Chile or South Africa, but
what happened in the local jail sug
gests how the police in those
countries can torture and
dehumanize their victims with im
punity while respectable citizens
manage to ignore the abuses or find
rationalizations for them.
Perkins' nightmare has laid bare
the insitutional brutality that exists
within our own society. The Uni
versity's response, in turn, reveals
the lack of concern that permits
such brutality to continue.
