## Food Service Leftovers and Your Hair 
### ANDREW McCLUNG Staff writer 
Salutations to all of those who are
carrying on a weekly love affair with
this column. Both of you will doubt
less be fascinated by my quelling of
curiosity in this installment, so here
we go.
I have a friend who wants to know
why it is that facial, underarm and
pubic hair are often of a different
color than the same person's head
type hair. Also, why does it feel dif
ferent when you run your hands,
etc., through it? Thanks, mister. -
Your admirer, Bobo the Clown
I've been battling this problem in
vain for years, so let's get it
straight right now: it's different
from, not different than, and, yes, I
refuse to let usage define linguistic
propriety. Got it? Good.
I called several hair clinics, and
eventually Dr. Samuel Stegman
contacted me to discuss these is
sues, which are of global signifi
cance.
Stegman is an associate clinical
professor of dermatology at UC-
San Francisco and happens to be
very interested in hair. His conten
tion is that the causes of differing
colors and textures of hair on one's
body are undoubtedly genetic, but
that one can only speculate on the
reasons why certain colors and
textures would win the evolution
ary struggle over others.
Hair color is determined by three
pigments: black, brown and red
(blonde hair, like blue eyes, is an
expression of a lack of pigmenta
tion). Stegman said he knew of no
evidence, however, that defin
itively supports any conjecture as
to why any coloration pattern
would be more successful than an
other.
Obviously, the three main racial
groups of homo sapiens have distinct
and consistent hair coloration
schemes, but no one seems to have
proven a specific reason for this
pattern .
The same goes for hair texture.
It is not clear why white people
have curly pubic hair and much
straighter cranial hair, or why
Asians typically have very little
body hair at all. Nor is it well under
stood why hair in different locations
on the body grows in phases of dif
ferent lengths before falling out and
being replaced (thus allowing
cranial hair to grow quite long while
eyebrow hairs stay very short).
What is known is what these
growth patterns are, but the why is
currently lost in the mists of his
tory. So although there exists a
great body of knowledge on hair

physiology and the characteristics
of hair growth, not much can be
said about why it grows the way it
does. I offer my apologies.
Why do automobile manufacturers
make it necessary to push a button in
order to remove the keys from the
ignition? - Mike Sabina
You probably wouldn't believe
how clever the Ford Motor Com
pany is at shuffling around people
who ask questions like this. Ulti
mately, I conversed with Henry
Machado, the district service en
gineer for the FoMoCo. He said
that that button is an anti-theft
device. It's for cars that have an au
tomatic transmission, but no steer
ing control shift lever.
You see, on cars that do have a
"column shift," the lever must be
shoved forward into the park posi
tion before the keys can be taken
out, but cars whose shifting is done

I suppose that
there is a cartel of
button manufac
turers that needs
to be kept in busi
ness somehow, and
this is certainly one
way to do it.

on the console at one's side don't
have such a feature. To com
pensate, that little button is placed
near the ignition switch so that you
can (with Herculean effort) push it
while you remove your keys.
At that point, the steering
column becomes locked and so do
the wheels, just as they would if
your car had its shift lever on the
steering column. And then bad men
cannot steal your car quite as*easily
as they could if you could remove
your keys without pushing that but
ton.
Also, I . suppose that there is a
cartel of button manufacturers that
needs to be kept in business some
how, and this is certainly one way
to do it.
What does our beloved food service
do with its tasty leftovers? Could the
situation be as heinous as I've heard,
that everything is just thrown away?
I mean, are we wasting food while

people are starving? - Corrinne
Martin
I assume that you are talking
about, leftovers proper, and not
simply the extra food on people's
plates that gets thrown away be
cause they decide they don't want it
after all. If so, then the answer to
your question is no.
University Food Service lef
tovers are not automatically thrown
away; sometimes they come back,
like Marley's ghost, to haunt you.
This is true if the left-over items
are things like potatoes or other
vegetables that can be reprepared
as fries or a soup.
Things like scrambled eggs and
souffles, however, do not keep well
enough to survive the waiting per
iod attending reincarnation, so if
people don't eat them the first time
they arc served, they get dumped.
Of course, University Food Ser
vice managers make every effort to

use their judgment (based on
years of experience) to match food
orders to precision estimates of
students' appetites, but you folks
do occasionally fool them.
All of this information is available
for the asking from Lois Ohms, who
is the assistant manager of Univer
sity Food Service and its dietician
as well. She hastens to point out
that, as you may have suspected,
the real threat to hungry people
around the world is not leftovers
that can't be served again, but food
that gets thrown away because stu
dents think they are hungrier than
they actually are.
And that is why food service in
sists on serving only one of its two
entrees at a time. It helps minimize
the volume of discarded food, and
then the world becomes a better
place.
On the front door to the Graduate
Programs Office (in Old Union) is a

small plaque above the door handle
that reads, "Latch Sticks; Press
Down Firmly." Why don't they get
the door fixed, and why was it a bet
ter idea to place the plaque on door?
They must have gone to some trouble
to have it made, as you wouldn't ex
pect ready-made ones to be sitting in
Woolworth's. - Joel Bion, graduate
student in computer science
It turns out that that plaque did
have to be specially crafted, and the
reason why is one of those great
bureaucratic barbarisms that plague
our great nation.
Let me state parenthetically that
I am amplifying the comments of
Mollie Goetz, the building manager
of the Graduate Awards Office, and
making them more accusative than
she herself could have. Ever. She is
too even-tempered and reasonable
and forgiving to sink to my level.
See, it went like this: back in the
days of the GPO, things had been
just hunky-dory for quite some time
until they were forced to move into
their present location near the
Nitery. While moving in, they were
faced with a severely constrained
budget for shaping up the insides of
the offices to accommodate them,
and most of that budget was needed
for recarpeting, reorganizing and
repainting.
It was quite evident even then
that the door latch was sticking, but
the command from on high was that
there were no funds available to pay
for fixing it. Of course, some inno
cent graduate students, weak from
the hunger engendered by having
to survive on meager fellowships
and stipends, couldn't get the door
open and assumed the office was
closed all the time. To remedy this
unfortunate situation, Mollie went
out and got the now-famous plaque
made by the hands of old-world
craftsmen out of old-world plastic
for the staggering sum of $35.
For a plastic plaque, the thing has
an amazingly impressive
weathered-bronze appearance,
don't you think? Complete with
stress-corrosion cracking and
everything.
Now, I thought it was pretty
lame that poor Mollie had to go out
and pay highway-robbery prices for
that plaque, and she said that it's
nearly impossible to get the car
pentry shop to process work orders
like this quickly and inexpensively.
So I think all of you out there who
are in Mechanical Engineering 103
and are searching desperately for a
project should give serious thought
to doing the repair work on the
door to the GPO. It would be easy,
requiring at most some lathe work
and cleaning and refitting of parts,
and it would be a good deed.
