## Mamet Hits Twice 
### PETER MORGAN Staff writer 
If you like David Mamet, there
are two very good productions of
his best plays currently running in
the Bay Area. If you don't like
Mamet and his dark visions of men
obsessed with money, then the
Curran Theatre's "Glengarry Glen
Ross" and the San Jose Stage Com
pany's "American Buffalo" should
be avoided at all costs, if only be
cause of their utter effectiveness.
Both plays look at the obsession
with money in modern America. In
both plays "doing business" comes
before friends, morals or anything
else that might get in the way of the
good old American dream.
"American Buffalo" is about three

blue-collar men trying to pull off an
improviso robbery. "Glengarry
Glen Ross" is about six white-collar
real estate salesmen trying to
sucker anyone they can. Neither
play concludes with the aquisition of
money or a sense of humanity.
Things continue for the thugs in the
pawn shop and the salesmen in the
office just as they always did. This
is the most wrenching part of
Mamet's plays. No one learns from
the mistakes of their materialistic
attitude: they just keep on bullshit
ting themselves, telling each other
that things are fine.
The parallels between
"Glengarry," which won the Pulit
zer Prize last year, and Arthur Mil
ler's "Death of a Salesman" are ob
vious. Anyone who watches the fall
of Shelly Levene, the over-the-hill

salesman ably played by Peter Falk,
will immediately think of the fall of
Willy Loman. The differences from
Miller's play, however, are what
makes Mamet's a unique state
ment. Most notable is the lack of
any admirable character or moral
view. There are no loving wives in
Mamet's world: pity for the sick
obsession of these "men at work" is
the best that we feel. Although
there is an emotional bond in
"American Buffalo" between
Bobby, the young street kid, and
Don, the old pawn shop proprietor,
it is destroyed by the desperation
to get the robbery off the ground.
Money is always the bottom line in
both plays, and everything else is
expendable in attaining it.
Another big difference from Mil
ler's play is that Mamet is ex

tremely funny. This sounds odd for
such a seedy, viscious subject, but
the fact is that "Glengarry" is the
funniest show I've seen this year.
The humor comes mostly from the
dialogue, which is fast, overlapped
and extremely obscene. The ex
tremism of the language builds a
tension that becomes absurd in in
tensity, and we laugh.
In the Curran production, Falk
has the audience smirking within
the first minute of the show with his
repeated cries of "Wait a minute,
just give me a goddamn minute will
you?" to his lunch partner who has
yet to say a word. Similiarly, Joe
Mantegna's portrayal of the
"successful" salesman Rick Roma is
hilarious when his fast paced snow
job is counterpointed with "Fuck
you" every now and then.

The San Jose Stage's production
lacks the intensity and comedy that
Falk and Mantegna have, but the
cast of "Glengarry" has come direct
from Broadway, with all the talent
that entails. Nevertheless, both
productions use the absurdity of the
character's bullshitting to, create
very funny comedy. This particu
larly heightens our fear when we
realize that these people believe,
and will keep on believing, their
own lies. The absurdity of the situa
tion turns out to be reality. Ugly
language is funny, but it supports an
ugly reality.
I recommend both these produc
tions, particularly "Glengarry Glen
Ross" at the Curran. They are both
funny and frightening shows. It may
be your only chance to see Mamet
for a while, since he's not as

popular to produce as the other
leading playwright in America, Sam
Shepard. One doesn't get such an
opportunity to see two fine produc
tions together. We may not like to
see his dismal vision of modern
American men, but whether ; we
watch or not,.4t is a reality.
"Glengarry Glen Ross," starring
Peter Falk and Joe Mantegna, runs
Tuesday through Thursday at 8
p.m. and Friday through Saturday
at 8:30 p.m., with some special
matinees. Call the Curran Theatre,
445 Geary Street, San Francisco

"American Buffalo" runs through
Nov. 24, Wednesday through
Friday at 9 p.m. Call the San Jose
Stage Company, 372 South First
Street, San Jose, for tickets at
(408) 293-2110.

office just as they always did. This
is the most wrenching part of
Mamet's plays. No one learns from
the mistakes of their materialistic
attitude: they just keep on bullshit
ting themselves, telling each other
that things are fine.
The parallels between
"Glengarry," which won the Pulit
zer Prize last year, and Arthur Mil
ler's "Death of a Salesman" are ob
vious. Anyone who watches the fall
of Shelly Levene, the over-the-hill

salesman ably played by Peter Falk,
will immediately think of the fall of
Willy Loman. The differences from
Miller's play, however, are what
makes Mamet's a unique state
ment. Most notable is the lack of
any admirable character or moral
view. There are no loving wives in
Mamet's world: pity for the sick
obsession of these "men at work" is
the best that we feel. Although
there is an emotional bond in
"American Buffalo" between
Bobby, the young street kid, and
Don, the old pawn shop proprietor,
it is destroyed by the desperation
to get the robbery off the ground.
Money is always the bottom line in
both plays, and everything else is
expendable in attaining it.
Another big difference from Mil
ler's play is that Mamet is ex

tremely funny. This sounds odd for
such a seedy, viscious subject, but
the fact is that "Glengarry" is the
funniest show I've seen this year.
The humor comes mostly from the
dialogue, which is fast, overlapped
and extremely obscene. The ex
tremism of the language builds a
tension that becomes absurd in in
tensity, and we laugh.
In the Curran production, Falk
has the audience smirking within
the first minute of the show with his
repeated cries of "Wait a minute,
just give me a goddamn minute will
you?" to his lunch partner who has
yet to say a word. Similiarly, Joe
Mantegna's portrayal of the
"successful" salesman Rick Roma is
hilarious when his fast paced snow
job is counterpointed with "Fuck
you" every now and then.

The San Jose Stage's production
lacks the intensity and comedy that
Falk and Mantegna have, but the
cast of "Glengarry" has come direct
from Broadway, with all the talent
that entails. Nevertheless, both
productions use the absurdity of the
character's bullshitting to, create
very funny comedy. This particu
larly heightens our fear when we
realize that these people believe,
and will keep on believing, their
own lies. The absurdity of the situa
tion turns out to be reality. Ugly
language is funny, but it supports an
ugly reality.
I recommend both these produc
tions, particularly "Glengarry Glen
Ross" at the Curran. They are both
funny and frightening shows. It may
be your only chance to see Mamet
for a while, since he's not as

popular to produce as the other
leading playwright in America, Sam
Shepard. One doesn't get such an
opportunity to see two fine produc
tions together. We may not like to
see his dismal vision of modern
American men, but whether ; we
watch or not,.4t is a reality.
"Glengarry Glen Ross," starring
Peter Falk and Joe Mantegna, runs
Tuesday through Thursday at 8
p.m. and Friday through Saturday
at 8:30 p.m., with some special
matinees. Call the Curran Theatre,
445 Geary Street, San Francisco
for more information at 673-4400.
"American Buffalo" runs through
Nov. 24, Wednesday through
Friday at 9 p.m. Call the San Jose
Stage Company, 372 South First
Street, San Jose, for tickets at
(408) 293-2110.




Peter Falk "bullshits" with Joe Mantegna (left) ar.d again with J.T. Walsh in David Mamet's "Glengarry Glen Ross" at the Curran Theatre. In Mamet's "American Buffalo," (lower right) at the
San Jose Stage Company, Wes Finlay, Randall King and J. Philip Jimenez do the same. Both shows run through Nov. 24.
If you like David Mamet, there
are two very good productions of
his best plays currently running in
the Bay Area. If you don't like
Mamet and his dark visions of men
obsessed with money, then the
Curran Theatre's "Glengarry Glen
Ross" and the San Jose Stage Com
pany's "American Buffalo" should
be avoided at all costs, if only be
cause of their utter effectiveness.
Both plays look at the obsession
with money in modern America. In
both plays "doing business" comes
before friends, morals or anything
else that might get in the way of the
good old American dream.
"American Buffalo" is about three

blue-collar men trying to pull off an
improviso robbery. "Glengarry
Glen Ross" is about six white-collar
real estate salesmen trying to
sucker anyone they can. Neither
play concludes with the aquisition of
money or a sense of humanity.
Things continue for the thugs in the
pawn shop and the salesmen in the
office just as they always did. This
is the most wrenching part of
Mamet's plays. No one learns from
the mistakes of their materialistic
attitude: they just keep on bullshit
