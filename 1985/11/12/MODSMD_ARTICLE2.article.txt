# Shuttle Service Picks Up Speed
## 
### ALLISON HARTWELL Editorial staff 
After a slow first month, the number of riders
on ASSURE is growing steadily, according to the
coordinators of the evening shuttle service.
ASSURE, or ASSU route extension, supple
ments the daytime Marguerite shuttle service by
running Sunday through Friday nights from 6
p.m. to 12:30 a.m. The service, which uses Mar
guerite buses, is funded by a $35,000 ASSU fee
assessment approved by students this spring.
About 300 people used the ASSURE shuttles
in October, according to Les Sinclair, owner of

Sinclair Transport, the company that runs the
ASSURE and Marguerite shuttle systems.
The ASSURE system is "like most anything
new, it starts out slow," he said, adding that the
service needs at least three to five months of op
eration before a fair evaluation can be made.
Considering the relatively few number of stu
dents who use the system, the ASSURE service
"is fairly expensive," Sinclair said.
But when judged by the small amount each
student has to pay for the service, ASSURE is
economical, he added, noting that the average
cost to the student is approximately $1.
Council of Presidents (COP) member Leslie

Leland, who serves on the ASSURE Advisory
Board, said, "In the beginning (of this year), we
really had doubts of whether ASSURE was going
to work out. But now, ridership is steadily
growing."
According to Leland, the use of ASSURE in
creases as students find out about the service.
"Last year people approved of the concept.
Now we just have to get them to know about this
year's implementation," Leland said.
COP member Andy Frisch, the director of the
ASSURE Adivisory Board, said the service "was
not doing that badly for the first few
months," estimating that the
shuttles serve about 12 students a
night.
The future of the service will not
be determined until the fee assess

ment is brought to the students
again in the spring, according to
Frisch.
"There is talk of combining
ASSURE and SURF- (Stanford
United for Rape Elimination)," he
said. SURE is an evening escort
service aimed at protecting women,
he said.
