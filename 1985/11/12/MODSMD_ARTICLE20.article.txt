# Historical Colonel Redl Provides Fascinating Fiction
## 
### GREG WATKINS Staff writer 
The winner of the Jury Prize at the '85 Cannes Film
Festival, "Colonel Redl" is the richly textured story of
the rise and fall of the Austro-Hungarian chief of
counter-intelligence just before the outbreak of World
War I. With the assistance of basically the same produc
tion team behind the Academy Award-winning
"Mephisto," director Istvan Szabo brings to the screen
a brilliant and beautiful film of epic proportions, a film
which, when compared with the story's historical
origins, provides an equally fruitful source for critical
considerations.
Although based on true events, Szabo's depiction of
Redl's life in its specificity, from childhood to death, is
entirely fictional. And as fiction, the film's historical
setting as well as its content and presentation encour
age comparison to the great novels of the 19th cen
tury.
As with many of those novels, "Colonel Redl" is
about the transformation of social orders, specifically,
that period between the utter disintegration of an order
that only romantic visions can save, and the rise of the
uncertain and necessarily violent determination of new
social structure and discourse.
In this case, we are shown the Austro-Hungarian
Empire with its aged and decrepit emperor whose
physical disrepair mirrors the corruption and decline of
its once dignified and revered army. The officers have
given themselves to corruption of all kinds: smuggling,
gambling, drunkeness, even rape. Yet it is precisely
the empire's diminished state that allows the young
Alfred Redl, a peasant boy from the Ukraine, to enter
its ranks. His modest origins give birth to a deep devo
tion and dedication to that world represented by the
Hapsburgs, a commitment exceeding even (especially)
those who have been born into nobility and have no
choice but to accept responsibility for the security and
perpetuation of their empire.
Like Julien Sorel in Stendahl's "The Red and the
Black," Redl's intelligence, gratitude, determination
and eventual insincerity and ruthlessness make possi
ble his speedy success. We follow Redl from his years
at the academy, to his days as a young officer, to his ap
pointment in Vienna, all wonderfully filmed. The army
and the empire are for Redl what they are ideally, a
place of honor and greatnesss. Just as Madame Bovary
sees her illusory world of romantic relationships, so
Redl sees his decadent and transforming world with old
and thus romantic vision.
Indeed, the genius of this film lies in part in its ability
to convey both worldviews simultaneously: creating a
sympathy for Redl's youthful idealism and dreams of
greatness while constructing an empire shot through
with corruption and irreversible decline. Finally, Redl's
realization of the real state of things ("What I wanted to
defend no longer exists") forces his self-destruction.

This is an equally novelistic ending, an ending that
ties together all of the great bourgeois novels and
which, as our own Rene Girard, professor of French
ana Italian, points out, completes the construction of
the hero: "The hero triumphs in defeat; he triumphs
because he is at the end of his resources; for the first
time he has to look his despair and nothingness in the
face. But this look which he has dreaded, which is the
death of pride, is his salvation."
Yet my sketch of the film's novelistic form belies
much of the richness of the film's content. For in
presenting the greatness of an individual in an age of
decline, one must also explore so many other things.
Indeed, it is precisely during crisis that what shapes
history is most clearly revealed. "Colonel Redl" is
about power and desire, idealism and realism: It is
about politics and persecution, dedication and decep
tion. All of these themes are brought to life within the
film's own realism: with the scenery of the Austrian
countryside, the period music and historical settings.
If you haven't gathered as much by now, "Colonel
Redl" should not be missed. It is a magnificent film, a
film whose thick texture is rivaled only by Klaus Maria
Brandauer's portrayal of Redl himself, stunning in its
depth and complexity.
Nor should it be seen with an uncritical eye. This
film represents a unique opportunity for very produc
tive critical assessment in that it is a particular
presentation of a very real historical figure. The San
Francisco Chronicle recently ran an article that con
veyed a drastically different picture of the historical
Redl. And that gap between storytelling and historical
circumstance provides potentially productive, critical
space.
If the film portrays a man destroyed by his idealism
and his candidacy as a scapegoat for the deteriorating
empire, history shows us a man whose homosexual ac
tivities led to blackmail for military information. Soon,
Redl was being rewarded financially for his information,
information that led to the death of thousands in Redl's
own army.
Even Redl's own perception of his eventual destruc
tion, revealed in a suicide note, contrasts significantly
with director Szabo's depiction: "Passion and levity
have destroyed me. I pay with my life for my sins. Pray
for me." Szabo, more than aware of the difference in
the character he presents, explains that he was more
interested in what he calls Redl's identity crisis, that
Redl wanted to be something he was not.
For me, this is perhaps the most uninteresting
course of exploration. The constellation of events and
circumstances is richer than that: Redl, more impor
tantly, was living a life that was no longer (perhaps
never) possible in his world, and was eventually
destroyed by his actions and desires, destroyed by
what he was, not what he wanted to be.
Of course, the progression and resolution of a story
are in the hands and intentions of the storyteller; we

must attempt to understand the Redl Szabo wants to
present and in the terms which he presents him. And
yet, that is precisely my point: the specific choices
Szabo makes are highlighted by the distance they hold
from what history would tell us. Not that that is a dis
tance between fiction and reality, nor should it be con
sidered as such. It is, rather, nothing more than a

"critical" gap, with a potential for elucidating the
choices made in fictioning and thus providing a very
real source for a critical appraisal of those choices.
"Redl" should be viewed with that gap in mind in an at
tempt to discover the assumptions behind, and implica
tions of, the choices Szabo has made. Why show us this
Redl?
