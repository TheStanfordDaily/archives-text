# Everyone Must Go See 'What the Butler Saw'
## 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
There is no way you can see the
Ram Head's production of Joe Or
ton's 1969 farce "What the Butler
Saw" without bursting into
laughter. It is, quite simply, a
hilarious romp.
At the same time, there is no
way you can leave the auditorium
(the last two performances will be
given in Cubberley this Friday and
Saturday at 8 p.m.) without a
greater appreciation for the brand
of intellectual humor that is
peculiarly British. You will marvel
that so many puns, witticisms and
other verbal devices can be jammed
into one hour-and-a-half show with
out any loss in physical humor.
Orton was a playwright who
derived satire from subjects pre
cious to the 20th century. He
stirred up a whirlwind of laughs
from things we otherwise might not
consider debatable, let alone
laughable — things like the desper
ate fixations we have on sexuality,
insanity and other manifestations of
our human infirmity.
"What the Butler Saw" captures
sharply the distinct modernness of
our obsession with the mind, drag
ging Freud through the dirt merci
lessly and ridiculing the vast net
work of authority built around the
sciences of psychology and psychia
try. It's not just the tired old
lecherous-doctor or web-of-intrigue
play you might imagine it being.
The cast doesn't waste any of its

scenes. Charles Cosovich is superb
as Dr. Prentice, the psychiatrist in
a small clinic who spends the entire
play creating and then desperately
trying to unravel a web of lies he
spins to cover up his stab at seduc
ing a secretary sent over from an
employment agency. Cosovich
captures Prentice's mounting con
fusion at the mess he's gotten him
self into with expansive jollity,
bounding back and forth across the
stage like a madman while keeping
a tight enough rein on his wits to be
able to cut everyone else with many
a well-placed barb.
Cosovich's barbs wouldn't be
nearly as effective as they are with-

out an equal amount of adeptness at
conveying the wild physical humor
of Orton's play, and he meets the
challenge well. It is almost as fun
anticipating what Chaplinesque fa
cial expression he'll employ next as
it is keeping your ears pricked for
the next pun.
In that respect, the entire cast is
gifted, and it would be unfair to
leave out mention of any of the
other players, who each contribute
in some degree to keep the produc
tion as well-paced as it is. Alison
Mockett as the doctor's wife is a
purring cheetah when she comes
onstage, but we see her weakness

The constable and the pageboy
who find themselves drawn inex
orably into the web are played with
an appropriately side-splitting level
of disorientation by Andres Mera
and Fred Harris.
Marcus Mabry almost steals the
show in his performance as Dr.
Ranee, the government psychiatrist
who stumbles into the maelstrom
and immediately sets about making
things as absurd as possible by
trying to stamp order on the situa
tion.
At one point in the play, for in
stance, Ranee is giving physical ex
aminations to everyone in sight,

vividly when by the end she's been
reduced to running around shooting
guns at "all the naked men." But
even disheveled, Mockett wears a
mask of sophistication that as
tonishes. Dignity is often a sad
thing to watch crumble, and Mock
ett crumbles exquisitely.
The beleaguered secretary
Ouliana Horseman) is a thrilling
study in working-class innocence
and honesty. Her tears of confusion
at being "twice declared insane in
one day" don't seem the least bit
ostentatious, and she does a terrific
job of weathering the battering
she's given by the authorities in the
clinic.

and orders the constable to
undress. When the constable
protests, Ranee says, "We can't be
too careful."
"It seems a bit unusual, sir," the
constable says.
"You're in a madhouse," Ranee
laughs. "Unusual behavior is the or
der of the day."
"Only for patients."
"We're no privileged class here,"
Ranee shoots back. "It's demo
cratic lunacy we practice."
Not more than a minute later,
Ranee is after the secretary, who
he confuses for the pageboy be
cause she's switched outfits with
him. He asks the secretary which
sex she belongs to, and when she
backs off, shaking her head that she
doesn't know, Ranee orders her to
disrobe:
"Take your trousers down. I'll
tell you which sex you belong to."
"I'd rather not know."
"You wish to remain in ignor
ance?"
"Yes."
"I can't encourage you in such a
self-indulgent attitude. You must
face facts like the rest of us."
The befuddled Dr. Prentice in
tervenes, trying to make better of
the circumstance he has helped
develop:
"You're forcing the boy to un
dergo a repetition of a traumatic ex
perience, sir. He might go insane."
"This is a mental home. He
couldn't choose a more appropriate
place."
Then, to the secretary:
"Undress. My time is valuable."

cause she's switched outfits with
him. He asks the secretary which
sex she belongs to, and when she
backs off, shaking her head that she
doesn't know, Ranee orders her to
disrobe:
"Take your trousers down. I'll
tell you which sex you belong to."
"I'd rather not know."
"You wish to remain in ignor
ance?"
"Yes."
"I can't encourage you in such a
self-indulgent attitude. You must
face facts like the rest of us."
The befuddled Dr. Prentice in
tervenes, trying to make better of
the circumstance he has helped
develop:
"You're forcing the boy to un
dergo a repetition of a traumatic ex
perience, sir. He might go insane."
"This is a mental home. He
couldn't choose a more appropriate
place."
Then, to the secretary:
"Undress. My time is valuable."

There is no way you can see the
Ram Head's production of Joe Or
ton's 1969 farce "What the Butler
Saw" without bursting into
laughter. It is, quite simply, a
hilarious romp.
At the same time, there is no
way you can leave the auditorium
(the last two performances will be
given in Cubberley this Friday and
Saturday at 8 p.m.) without a
greater appreciation for the brand
of intellectual humor that is
peculiarly British. You will marvel
that so many puns, witticisms and
other verbal devices can be jammed
into one hour-and-a-half show with
out any loss in physical humor.
Orton was a playwright who
derived satire from subjects pre
cious to the 20th century. He
stirred up a whirlwind of laughs
from things we otherwise might not
consider debatable, let alone
laughable — things like the desper
ate fixations we have on sexuality,
insanity and other manifestations of
our human infirmity.
"What the Butler Saw" captures
sharply the distinct modernness of
our obsession with the mind, drag
ging Freud through the dirt merci
lessly and ridiculing the vast net
work of authority built around the
sciences of psychology and psychia
try. It's not just the tired old
lecherous-doctor or web-of-intrigue
play you might imagine it being.
The cast doesn't waste any of its

scenes. Charles Cosovich is superb
as Dr. Prentice, the psychiatrist in
a small clinic who spends the entire
play creating and then desperately
trying to unravel a web of lies he
spins to cover up his stab at seduc
ing a secretary sent over from an
employment agency. Cosovich
captures Prentice's mounting con
fusion at the mess he's gotten him
self into with expansive jollity,
bounding back and forth across the
stage like a madman while keeping
a tight enough rein on his wits to be
able to cut everyone else with many
a well-placed barb.
Cosovich's barbs wouldn't be
nearly as effective as they are with-

out an equal amount of adeptness at
conveying the wild physical humor
of Orton's play, and he meets the
challenge well. It is almost as fun
anticipating what Chaplinesque fa
cial expression he'll employ next as
it is keeping your ears pricked for
the next pun.
In that respect, the entire cast is
gifted, and it would be unfair to
leave out mention of any of the
other players, who each contribute
in some degree to keep the produc
tion as well-paced as it is. Alison
Mockett as the doctor's wife is a
purring cheetah when she comes
onstage, but we see her weakness

The constable and the pageboy
who find themselves drawn inex
orably into the web are played with
an appropriately side-splitting level
of disorientation by Andres Mera
and Fred Harris.
Marcus Mabry almost steals the
show in his performance as Dr.
Ranee, the government psychiatrist
who stumbles into the maelstrom
and immediately sets about making
things as absurd as possible by
trying to stamp order on the situa
tion.
At one point in the play, for in
stance, Ranee is giving physical ex
aminations to everyone in sight,

vividly when by the end she's been
reduced to running around shooting
guns at "all the naked men." But
even disheveled, Mockett wears a
mask of sophistication that as
tonishes. Dignity is often a sad
thing to watch crumble, and Mock
ett crumbles exquisitely.
The beleaguered secretary
Ouliana Horseman) is a thrilling
study in working-class innocence
and honesty. Her tears of confusion
at being "twice declared insane in
one day" don't seem the least bit
ostentatious, and she does a terrific
job of weathering the battering
she's given by the authorities in the
clinic.

and orders the constable to
undress. When the constable
protests, Ranee says, "We can't be
too careful."
"It seems a bit unusual, sir," the
constable says.
"You're in a madhouse," Ranee
laughs. "Unusual behavior is the or
der of the day."
"Only for patients."
"We're no privileged class here,"
Ranee shoots back. "It's demo
cratic lunacy we practice."
