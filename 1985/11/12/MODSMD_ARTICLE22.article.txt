If it's action you like, there was
more than enough this weekend as
the Stanford sailing team captured
third place in what turned out its
most challenging regatta of the
year.
The team traveled to Cal-Poly
San Luis Obispo to compete in the
season finale, the North/South
Regatta. The results of this regatta
determined the final rankings for
the year.
It turned out to be more of a fight

14 other schools present. "It was

the most variable and challenging
conditions I've ever seen," sail
Coach Joe Petrucci said. "It was
wet and wild." The swirling winds
on Saturday and the stormy 10 to
35 knot gusts on Sunday resulted in
over 100 capsizes. Unfortunately
for Stanford, many of them were
piloted by Cardinal sailors.
Stanford ended the first day of
competition 14 points behind South
ern Cal, and 14 points ahead of UC-
Irvine. "We didn't cope well with
the shifting wind," Petrucci said.

a number of capsizes prompted
many team changes. In the A divi
