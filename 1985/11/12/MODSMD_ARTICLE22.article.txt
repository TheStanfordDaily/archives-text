## Violent Winds Blow No Good For the Card 
### BRANDI WATSON Staff writer 
If it's action you like, there was
more than enough this weekend as
the Stanford sailing team captured
third place in what turned out its
most challenging regatta of the
year.
The team traveled to Cal-Poly
San Luis Obispo to compete in the
season finale, the North/South
Regatta. The results of this regatta
determined the final rankings for
the year.
It turned out to be more of a fight
against the weather than any of the
14 other schools present. "It was

the most variable and challenging
conditions I've ever seen," sail
Coach Joe Petrucci said. "It was
wet and wild." The swirling winds
on Saturday and the stormy 10 to
35 knot gusts on Sunday resulted in
over 100 capsizes. Unfortunately
for Stanford, many of them were
piloted by Cardinal sailors.
Stanford ended the first day of
competition 14 points behind South
ern Cal, and 14 points ahead of UC-
Irvine. "We didn't cope well with
the shifting wind," Petrucci said.
On Sunday, the heavy winds and
a number of capsizes prompted
many team changes. In the A divi

when the NCAA did not give them a playoff bid.

Sophomore Bob Sage ended up injuring the goalie but missing
the shot on this play during Stanford's season-ending 1-0 vie-
sion for Stanford, Rich Bergsend
and Mareka Fussganger took over for
Drew Gashler and Kristin Boyles
when they capsized their boat.
Bergsend ended up being replaced
by freshman Bill Shoemaker.
In the B division, Dan Buckstaff
and Rona Sisson sailed well but
were too light to handle the heavy
wind. Sisson was replaced by fresh
man Brad Swett.
The D division proved to be pivo
tal in the overall team standings for
the regatta, as Stanford senior Al
bert Boyce fell apart and capsized
twice. He was replaced by sopho
more There DuPont, who also
capsized and damaged his boat
If the Stanford team had been
able to finish the race, it would have
asssured itself of a second-place
finish in the regatta. But with Du-
Pont's inability to finish, the Card
inal ended up taking third overall,
behind USC and UC-I.
