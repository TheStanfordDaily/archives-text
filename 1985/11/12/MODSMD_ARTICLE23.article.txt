# Stanford Is Out, The Bears Are In
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
The waiting and, unfortunately
for the Stanford men's soccer team,
the season both ended yesterday
afternoon when the NCAA an
nounced the recipients of post
season tournament bids.
Cardinal Coach Sam Koch
and his players were hoping to
receive the final Western region at
large bid, but it went instead to
arch-rival UC-Berkeley.
Not all of yesterday's news was
bad, however. The Stanford Sports
Information Directors named
goaltender Tom Austin as the Stan
ford Athlete of the Month for Octo
ber.
But the award did not take all the
sting out of the team's disappoint
ment at not making the NCAAs.
"I didn't realize Cal was so much
in the running, especially after we
beat them," Austin said. "And now
the losses early in the season to
Westmont and USIU hurt more. If

we had won those, we'd definitely
be in the tournament."
The fact that Cal got the bid
rather than the Cardinal probably
added to the players' frustrations.
On Sunday Stanford outplayed Cal
up and down the field and shutout
the usually high scoring Bears 2-0.
As far as head-to-head competition
goes, logic would dictate that the
Cardinal get the bid.
"But the NCAA doesn't go so
much on who beats whom," Paul
Kennedy, editor of Soccer America
magazine said. "They judge more
on overall record and strength of
schedule."
Under that criteria, Cal does look
better. The Bears had an impres
sive schedule and ended the season
with a record of 14-4-1, while Stan
ford's finished up at 12-6-3.
"To put it simply, Cal had four
losses compared to our six, and
that's what hurt us," Koch said.
The NCAA also examines how
teams finished the season, and in
that respect, Stanford looked great.
Over the Cardinal's last 10 games,
the team went 8-1-1, including five
shutouts.
But the national committee
doesn't disregard the beginning of
the season. And Stanford went 1-3-
1 in its first five games.
"We finished stronger than Cal,
but those three losses early in the
year came back to haunt us," Koch
said.
Two more factors contributed to
Cal receiving the invitation. First,
the Bears turned in a convincing 2-0
victory over the University of San
Francisco Sunday to end the season
on a high note.
Finally, Kennedy added a last
factor. Both Stanford and Cal took
an East Coast trip.
"Cal went to Florida and won
both games (against Florida Inter
national and the University of
Tampa), while Stanford went to the
Northeast and didn't do as well,"
Kennedy said. In three games back
East, the Cardinal went 1-1-1.
"Now it's just time to look ahead
to next year," Koch, the second
year head coach, said.
Nine seniors will graduate this
spring, so Koch will have quite a
few holes to fill. But luckily for the
Cardinal, Austin will be back to fill
the goaltending position.
Austin, a junior from Chadds
Ford, Pa., had a stellar season in
the net. He allowed only 13 goals in
21 matches, a miniscule average of
. 59 goals per game.

Stanford goalie Tom Austin yesterday was named Stanford's
Athlete of the Month for October. During the month, Austin led
the Cardinal to a 6-2-1 record by giving up a scant .72 goals a
game. He also had four shutouts.
