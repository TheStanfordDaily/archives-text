# Stanford Is Out, The Bears Are In

The waiting and, unfortunately
for the Stanford men's soccer team,
the season both ended yesterday
afternoon when the NCAA an
nounced the recipients of post
season tournament bids.
Cardinal Coach Sam Koch
and his players were hoping to
receive the final Western region at
large bid, but it went instead to
arch-rival UC-Berkeley.
Not all of yesterday's news was
bad, however. The Stanford Sports
Information Directors named
goaltender Tom Austin as the Stan
ford Athlete of the Month for Octo
ber.
But the award did not take all the
sting out of the team's disappoint
ment at not making the NCAAs.
"I didn't realize Cal was so much
in the running, especially after we
beat them," Austin said. "And now
the losses early in the season to
Westmont and USIU hurt more. If

we had won those, we'd definitely
be in the tournament."
The fact that Cal got the bid
rather than the Cardinal probably
added to the players' frustrations.
On Sunday Stanford outplayed Cal
up and down the field and shutout
the usually high scoring Bears 2-0.
As far as head-to-head competition
goes, logic would dictate that the
Cardinal get the bid.
"But the NCAA doesn't go so
much on who beats whom," Paul
Kennedy, editor of Soccer America
magazine said. "They judge more
on overall record and strength of
schedule."
Under that criteria, Cal does look
better. The Bears had an impres
sive schedule and ended the season
with a record of 14-4-1, while Stan
ford's finished up at 12-6-3.
"To put it simply, Cal had four
losses compared to our six, and
that's what hurt us," Koch said.
The NCAA also examines how
teams finished the season, and in
