## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Bret Saber
hagen became the first Kansas City
Royals' pitcher to win the American
League Cy Young Award, grabbing
23 of 28 first-place votes, the
Baseball Writers Association of
America announced yesterday.
Saberhagen, 21, was 20-6 with a
2.87 earned run average in his
second major-league season. He
had 10 complete games, with one
shutout, and struck out 158 in 235
innings.
The right-hander easily outdis
tanced New York Yankees left
hander Ron Guidry. Saberhagen,
who also received four second
place votes, collected 127 points.
Guidry had four first-place votes,
22 for second and was picked third
on two ballots. He finished with 88
points.
Guidry was the only pitcher
named on all 28 ballots — two writ
ers from each of the AL's 14 cities.
Saberhagen was not selected by
Ray Sons of the Chicago Sun-
Times, who had Minnesota's Bert

Blyleven first, Royals reliever Dan
Quisenberry second and Guidry
third.
Saberhagen was the Royals' ace,
leading Kansas City's charge to the
AL West title, the American
League pennant and World Series.
He pitched complete games to win
the third and seventh games of the
Series, though his postseason
achievements did not figure in the
voting, which was conducted prior
to the playoffs.
At one point, Saberhagen won
seven consecutive decisions and
had another five-game winning
streak.
As a rookie in 1984, Saberhagen
was 10-11.
Guidry, who won the award in
1978, was 22-6 with a 3.27 ERA,
two shutouts in 11 complete games
and 143 strikeouts in 259 innings
this year.
Guidry, 35, rebounded from the
worst season of his nine-year
career — he was 10-11 in 1984 —
to help the Yankees finish second.
