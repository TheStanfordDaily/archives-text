# Joe Cain May Jump Ship
## 'The Right StufF defensive back is pondering a transfer 
### JASON COLE 
Joe Cain, a football player for Stanford
during the 1983 and 1984 seasons who is not
playing this season because he is on academic
probation, said yesterday he may transfer to
another school, although he will not make a
definite decision for a few weeks.
Cain, who is currently taking classes at Cal
State-Dominquez Hills near his home in Com
pton, said yesterday that he has been con
tacted by several other schools that are inter
ested in him. Cain declined to say which
schools because he wasn't sure if there would

be a possible NCAA infraction.
"I don't really know myself what I'm going
to do," Cain said. "Some (schools) have con
tacted me. I'm definitely going to go to school,
but I'm not sure where."
Cain will have to apply for provisional
registration later this month if he intends to
return to Stanford for winter quarter, accord
ing to Cain's former adviser, Kathy
Thoelecke, an academic advising consultant
with the Undergraduate Advising Center. Cain
has not taken classes at Stanford since spring
quarter.
"My number one goal is to get a degree, but

it goes hand-in-hand with playing football. I
don't think I can put one (football or
academics) ahead of the other," Cain said.
Cain came to Stanford from Compton High
School in 1983 as a top-rated recruit (had been
recruited by USC, UCLA and Washington,
among others.) After playing extensively as a
freshman at both linebacker and safety in
1983, he became the starting strong safety in
1984. He was supposed to be moved back to
linebacker this season.
Ironically, Cain was one of six players


Joe Cain, shown here in action last year, may never don a
Cardinal jersey again. He is not sure yet, but the former
linebacker/defensive back, who has been declared academi-

Rod Searcey/Daily file
cally ineligible this year, has been talking with other Division I
schools about a possible transfer. Cain is currently living at
home in Compton and will come to a decision in a few weeks.
