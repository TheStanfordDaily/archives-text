# Penn State Climbs to No. 1 in AP Poll
## 
### 
Penn State has become the fifth team to reach the top of
The Associated Press college football poll this season, ending
Florida's one-week reign.
The Nittany Lions, second a week ago, boosted their
record to 9-0 by defeating Cincinnati 31-10 Saturday and took
advantage of Florida's 24-3 loss to Georgia, which dropped
the Gators to 11th place.
Penn State received 44 of 59 first-place votes and 1,143 of
a possible 1,180 points Monday from a nationwide panel of
sports writers and sportscasters.
The rise to the top capped a season-long climb for Penn
State, which was 19th in the first regular-season poll and has
since been 11th, 10th, ninth, eighth, sixth, third and second.
Oklahoma, Auburn, lowa and Florida had previously been
ranked No. 1 this season.

The No. 1 ranking wasn't expected to excite Penn State
Coach Joe Paterno. Following Saturday's game, he said: "As
I've always said, nobody's anything until the season's over.
That's exactly the way I feel about it."
Nebraska, which crushed lowa State 49-0 Saturday, moved
up from third place to second with nine first-place votes and
1,083 points. Ohio State trounced Northwestern 35-17 and
went from fourth to third with two first-place votes and 1,021
points.
Air Force, the nation's only 10-0 team, rose from fifth to
fourth with two first-place votes and 941 points by routing
Army 45-7 and lowa went from sixth to fifth with 905 points
after walloping Illinois 59-0.
Miami of Florida, a 29-22 winner over Maryland, vaulted

from eighth place to sixth with 891 points. The remaining two
first-place votes went to Oklahoma, which held seventh place
with 883 points following a 51-6 romp over Missouri.
Michigan moved up from ninth to eighth with 744 points by
drubbing Purdue 47-0, Arkansas leaped from 12th to ninth
with 662 points by downing No. 11 Baylor 20-14, and Okla
homa State, which beat Kansas State 35-3, remained in 10th
place with 646 points.
The 20 teams in this week's poll are the same as last week,
with some shuffling.
The Second Ten consists of Florida, Georgia, UCLA,
Auburn, Florida State, Brigham Young, Baylor, Tennessee,
LSU and Alabama.
Last week, it was Baylor, Arkansas, Auburn, UCLA, LSU,
Florida State, Georgia, BYU, Tennessee and Alabama.
