# Ex-Card QB fires two TD passes
## Elway Paces Bronco Win 
### 
DENVER (AP) — Former Stanford quarterback
John Elway fired a pair of first-half touchdown passes
and Rich Karlis drilled a 24-yard field goal with 1:27
remaining, lifting the Denver Broncos into sole posses
sion of first place in the AFC West with a 17-16 Na
tional Football League victory over the San Francisco
49ers last night.
The 49ers, trailing 14-3 at the half, rallied behind the
arm of Joe Montana, the legs of Roger Craig and the
foot of Ray Wersching to take a 16-14 lead with 3:46
remaining. Wersching kicked a 45-yard field goal to put
San Francisco ahead for the first time.
But Denver countered with a 63-yard drive, high
lighted by a pass-interference penalty on 49er safety
Dwight Hicks that covered 42 yards and a 22-yard pass
from a scrambling Elway to Steve Watson — both on
third down.
Denver reached the 49er seven-yard-line, and Karlis

connected on his second game-winning kick of the
season.
In a first half characterized by kicking-game errors
on both sides, Denver moved to a 14-3 lead behind El
way touchdown passes of three yards to running back
Gene Lang and six yards to Watson.
The 49ers, who had driven inside the Denver 10-
yard-line on three occasions in the first half but scored
only a field goal, battled back in the second half. Mon
tana got them in the end zone early in the third quarter
with a 13-yard pass to Mike Wilson.
Following a Ronnie Lott interception, Wersching
kicked a 22-yarder to draw the 49ers within 14-13 mid
way through the quarter.
The victory raised Denver's record to 7-3, one game
ahead of both the Los Angeles Raiders and the Seattle
Seahawks in the AFC West. San Francisco fell to 5-5
and remained three games behind the Los Angeles
Rams in the NFC West.
