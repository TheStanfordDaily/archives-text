# Kennedy Speaks on Activism
## 
### KAREN MARANGI 
"I have always believed that occasional
acts of civil disobedience with the ac
cepted consequences are often necessary
. . . and deeply persuasive," University
President Donald Kennedy said in a
speech yesterday at Tresidder Oak
Lounge West.
Kennedy and Bob Beyers, director of
University News Service, spoke on "The
Tradition of Student Activism at Stanford"
to a group of approximately 70 people,
many of whom were members of Stanford
Out of South Africa (SOSA).
"Part of activism is to accept and
respect risks and consequences," Ken
nedy said, explaining why the administra
tion had threatened the students arrested
last month for civil disobedience with pos
sible expulsion or suspension.
Beyers emphasized that effective ac-

tivists build coalitions, keep a sense of
humor and adjust rapidly to unexpected
situations. He added that "nonviolence
usually works better than violence in
securing change . . . (and) the most en
during changes are usually those which
enable individuals to gain a greater degree
of control over their own futures."
Kennedy listed four kinds of student ac
tivism: public service; interest in civil
rights and liberties; interest in national
policy; and student involvement in institu
tional affairs.
The "most familiar forms of activism
are political and social," according to
Beyers, who was introduced by Elizabeth
Gardner, student representative to the
Centennial Commission, as "probably
having seen more demonstrations on the
Peninsula than any other living person."
"There is no one brand of activism
here, nor is there a single political per
spective," Beyers said.

Beyers and Kennedy related numerous
instances of student activism at Stanford
during the past several decades, explain
ing how they influenced the University.
In 1962, in response to the civil rights
movement, the first fraternity on campus
voluntarily severed ties with its national
organization in order to pledge a black un
dergraduate, according to Beyers.
Voluntary student organizations were
not allowed to "take positions on political
issues at Stanford" until 1963, Beyers
said.
One out of 10 students involved in the
Mississippi Summer Project in 1964 came
from Stanford, as did about a dozen fac
ulty and staff. Many taught in the first in
tegrated elementary and secondary
schools in the state.

Summer Project, "three civil rights

workers were killed. . . . There
were six major beatings, five home
and business bombings, 11 church
burnings and attempted arsons,
over "200 arrests of civil rights
workers, and seven arrests — six
by the FBI — of local whites
accused of violence against the
movement," Beyers said.
He warned that activists must be
responsible for any actions they in
itiate as the "beneficiaries of change
will bear most of its costs."
Kennedy said the cultural empha
sis 011 youth in the '60s was an
added impetus for students to have
an increasing role in institutional af
fairs. The first protests and sit-ins
during the early '60s pushing for
institutional involvement eventually
led to the Study of Education at

Stanford (SES) from 1966 to 1969
that involved "hundreds of stu
dents." according to Kennedy.
" I he SES report resulted in a
major shift of academic resources
toward the freshman year and sub
stantially loosened curricular re
quirements," Bevers said.
"I*our days after the assassina
tion of Martin Luther King Jr., Stan
ford black students quietly took
over the stage in Memorial
Auditorium, demanding increased
enrollment of minority students at
Stanford. Within a few hours, Presi
dent Wallace Sterling and Provost
Richard Lyman responded with a
commitment to double minority en
rollment by 1969-70," said Beyers.
"In 1969 and 1970, highly
publicized and increasigly violent
demonstrations accompanied the
phaseout of classified research and
the end of academic credit for
ROTC at Stanford," Beyers said.

accused of violence against the
movement," Beyers said.
He warned that activists must be
responsible for any actions they in
itiate as the "beneficiaries of change
will bear most of its costs."
Kennedy said the cultural empha
sis 011 youth in the '60s was an
added impetus for students to have
an increasing role in institutional af
fairs. The first protests and sit-ins
during the early '60s pushing for
institutional involvement eventually
led to the Study of Education at

Stanford (SES) from 1966 to 1969
that involved "hundreds of stu
dents." according to Kennedy.
" I he SES report resulted in a
major shift of academic resources
toward the freshman year and sub
stantially loosened curricular re
quirements," Bevers said.
"I*our days after the assassina
tion of Martin Luther King Jr., Stan
ford black students quietly took
over the stage in Memorial
Auditorium, demanding increased
enrollment of minority students at
Stanford. Within a few hours, Presi
dent Wallace Sterling and Provost
Richard Lyman responded with a
commitment to double minority en
rollment by 1969-70," said Beyers.
"In 1969 and 1970, highly
publicized and increasigly violent
demonstrations accompanied the
phaseout of classified research and
the end of academic credit for
ROTC at Stanford," Beyers said.
