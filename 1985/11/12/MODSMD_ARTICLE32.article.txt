# Crew Braves Blustery Weather

Braving pouring rain, freezing
cold and driving winds, the Stan
ford women's crew team rowed
impressively in the Head of the
American River Regatta, an open
pre-season event held Sunday in
Sacramento.
With the inclement weather
working against them, the Card
inal proved it could perform. "The
conditions were awful," Stanford
captain Hilde Emlander said. "It
was hard to be positive about
racing, it was so bad. We did
really well considering the condi
tions."

The Cardinal entered two
boats in the four-man competi
tion, placing second and third in
the field of six boats. The race
was won by the Lake Merit
Rowing Club, a team with mostly
post-college rowers. "We felt real
good about coming in right behind
them," Assistant Coach Wendy
Davis said. "We put together
even boats while they had all their
good rowers in one boat."
In the eights, Stanford entered
three varsity boats. They placed
second, third and fourth, behind
Lake Merit again. The third Card
inal boat edged out UC-Santa
Barbara at the finish.
Rowers and coaches alike were

pleased with the day's outcome.
"We were pretty happy,"
Emlander said. "Most of the boats
were decided late. We had never
even rowed together before."
The race was not for serious
competition, but mainly for ex
perience and to familiarize the
teams with the course where the
Pacific Coast Championships will
take place this spring. According
to Davis, "It was real good exper
ience. The team did a good job. It
was a good practice race. We had
three novices out that had never
rowed before, one in each eight.
They showed they could handle
themselves. I think we did quite
well."
