Argentina Indicts War Planners
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — A military prosecutor urged
prison terms yesterday for a former president and two other armed
forces commanders who took Argentina to war in 1982 in the belief
that the British would never fight for the Falkland Islands.
The officers, including former President Leopoldo Galtieri, are
accused of military negligence in a 240-page indictment presented to
a court-martial by Brig. Hector Canale, judge advocate of the armed
forces.
In the name of military secrecy, the court-martial has been closed
to the public since it began two years ago, and the two-week sum
ming up that began yesterday also is closed. But details have been
widely leaked.
The charges, brought by the junta that replaced Galtieri following
the Argentine surrender on June 14, 1982, deal only with alleged mil
itary bungling and do not take into account any political errors, in
cluding refusal to accept international mediation, that may have con
tributed to the Argentine defeat.
Galtieri was both president and army commander when he or
dered the April 2, 1982, invasion of the Falklands, a British colony off
Argentina. The Argentines call the islands the Malvinas and have
claimed them for more than a century. Adm. Jorge Anaya and Air
Force Brig. Basilio Lami Dozo were members of the junta that Gal
tieri headed.
In all, 16 officers are accused of negligence in the prosecution of
the war. The indictment charges that the Galtieri junta believed that
occupation of the islands, home to about 2,000 English-speaking
sheep farmers, would enhance Argentina's negotiating position.
The indictment contends that the junta failed to anticipate an
armed British response to the invasion and that it ignored repeated
warnings from Washington that the United States would side with the
British.
Minister Warns of Rebel Power
MANILA, Philippines — Philippine Defense Minister Juan Ponce
Enrile said yesterday that the communist-led insurgency here could
not be contained for at least a decade, an estimate at sharp odds with
that of President Ferdinand Marcos.
The president recently claimed that "we'll wipe them out" in one
year with continued U. S. military aid.
"I am not that optimistic," Enrile told a press forum here. "I think
we are getting too panicky about it. In the case of Malaysia, it took
three or four decades" to put down a communist insurgency.
Also yesterday, Marcos, declaring "there is not a moment to
lose," submitted a deferred resignation along with his party's bill call
ing for early presidential elections to seek a new mandate in the
troubled Philippines. His resignation of the remaining portion of his
term would not take effect until a winner is declared in the Jan. 17
polling.
Although expressing pessimism regarding the rebels, Enrile in
sisted that the government's anti-insurgency program is on track.
Any succeeding president "will have to use the same formulation
adopted by President Marcos," he said.
American officials have been less optimistic than either Enrile or
Marcos. Military, political and economic reforms urged by Washing
ton would have to be stepped up, Assistant Defense Secretary Rich
ard Armitage warned. The current pace is "insufficient to arrest the
growth of the insurgency," he said.
Egyptians Apprehend Hit Squad
CAIRO, Egypt — Egypt's Interior Minister announced yesterday
that police have arrested a Libyan hit squad and thwarted the second
attempt in less than a year to assassinate exiled opponents of Libyan
leader Col. Moammar Khadafy.
One of the intended victims, former Libyan Prime Minister Abdel-
Hamid Bakoush, said that the assassins were apprehended in a
shootout moments before the attack was to have taken place at a
farm house near the Mediterranean port of Alexandria on Nov. 6.
Announcing their apprehension to reporters, Interior Minister
Ahmed Rushdi indicated that Egyptian intelligence was aware of the
movements of the four Libyans from the time they entered Egypt
Nov. 2. He said security agents followed the assassins to Alexandria,
where they rented an apartment, and recorded their actions on video
tape before laying a trap for them on the day of the planned assas
sination.
Besides Bakoush, who was the target of a similar assassination at
tempt last November, the four-man hit squad had orders to kill
Mohammed el-Mokaryef, an ex-Libyan government financial official,
Rushdi said.
The carefully planned intelligence operation appeared to be an at
tempt to duplicate the success that Egypt enjoyed last November,
when it not only foiled the first attempt to kill Bakoush but, through
an elaborate ruse, exposed the Libyan plot and scored a major
propaganda victory over Khadafy.
Controversial Play Cancelled
BONN, West Germany — A controversial play that provoked bit
ter debate in West Germany over whether freedom of artistic ex
pression should extend into anti-Semitic caricature was canceled last
night by Frankfurt's city theater after its management concluded that
the risks of violent protests were too severe.
Following anguished consultations with city officials, Jewish
leaders and the acting community, Frankfurt's theater director
Guenther Ruehle announced that the play "Garbage, the City and
Death," written in 1975 by the late filmmaker Rainer Fassbinder,
would not be performed n the foreseeable future because of the
need to preserve civic peace and secure working conditions for the
theater.
The play, sharply attacked by the city's 5,000-member Jewish
community as blatantly anti-Semitic, and judged by many critics to be
one of Fassbinder's most inferior works, ostensibly was written in a
fit of rage to satirize the rampant materialism perceived in one of the
world's leading banking capitals.
Rebels Hold Airline Passengers
KAMPALA, Uganda — The 49 passengers of a Uganda Airlines
plane hijacked Sunday are being held by guerrillas deep inside rebel
held territory in western Uganda, it was learned here yesterday.
Although a spokesman for the rebel National Resistance Army
said that the civilian passengers were "free to leave" at any time,
West German Ambassador Guenther Held reported that the civilians
were "guests of the NRA" at a hotel near Kasese, 175 miles west of
Kampala.
The NRA spokesman, Sam Kiseke, said that about 10 military
personnel among the passengers were being held as "prisoners of
war" and were undergoing "re-education."

we are getting too panicky about it. In the case of Malaysia, it took
three or four decades" to put down a communist insurgency.
Also yesterday, Marcos, declaring "there is not a moment to
lose," submitted a deferred resignation along with his party's bill call
ing for early presidential elections to seek a new mandate in the
troubled Philippines. His resignation of the remaining portion of his
term would not take effect until a winner is declared in the Jan. 17
polling.
Although expressing pessimism regarding the rebels, Enrile in
sisted that the government's anti-insurgency program is on track.
Any succeeding president "will have to use the same formulation
adopted by President Marcos," he said.
American officials have been less optimistic than either Enrile or
Marcos. Military, political and economic reforms urged by Washing
ton would have to be stepped up, Assistant Defense Secretary Rich
ard Armitage warned. The current pace is "insufficient to arrest the
growth of the insurgency," he said.
Egyptians Apprehend Hit Squad
CAIRO, Egypt — Egypt's Interior Minister announced yesterday
that police have arrested a Libyan hit squad and thwarted the second
attempt in less than a year to assassinate exiled opponents of Libyan
leader Col. Moammar Khadafy.
One of the intended victims, former Libyan Prime Minister Abdel-
Hamid Bakoush, said that the assassins were apprehended in a
shootout moments before the attack was to have taken place at a
farm house near the Mediterranean port of Alexandria on Nov. 6.
Announcing their apprehension to reporters, Interior Minister
Ahmed Rushdi indicated that Egyptian intelligence was aware of the
movements of the four Libyans from the time they entered Egypt
Nov. 2. He said security agents followed the assassins to Alexandria,
where they rented an apartment, and recorded their actions on video
tape before laying a trap for them on the day of the planned assas
sination.
Besides Bakoush, who was the target of a similar assassination at
tempt last November, the four-man hit squad had orders to kill
Mohammed el-Mokaryef, an ex-Libyan government financial official,
Rushdi said.
The carefully planned intelligence operation appeared to be an at
tempt to duplicate the success that Egypt enjoyed last November,
when it not only foiled the first attempt to kill Bakoush but, through
an elaborate ruse, exposed the Libyan plot and scored a major
propaganda victory over Khadafy.
Controversial Play Cancelled
BONN, West Germany — A controversial play that provoked bit
ter debate in West Germany over whether freedom of artistic ex
pression should extend into anti-Semitic caricature was canceled last
night by Frankfurt's city theater after its management concluded that
the risks of violent protests were too severe.
Following anguished consultations with city officials, Jewish
leaders and the acting community, Frankfurt's theater director
Guenther Ruehle announced that the play "Garbage, the City and
Death," written in 1975 by the late filmmaker Rainer Fassbinder,
would not be performed n the foreseeable future because of the
need to preserve civic peace and secure working conditions for the
theater.
The play, sharply attacked by the city's 5,000-member Jewish
community as blatantly anti-Semitic, and judged by many critics to be
one of Fassbinder's most inferior works, ostensibly was written in a
fit of rage to satirize the rampant materialism perceived in one of the
world's leading banking capitals.
Rebels Hold Airline Passengers
KAMPALA, Uganda — The 49 passengers of a Uganda Airlines
plane hijacked Sunday are being held by guerrillas deep inside rebel
held territory in western Uganda, it was learned here yesterday.
Although a spokesman for the rebel National Resistance Army
said that the civilian passengers were "free to leave" at any time,
West German Ambassador Guenther Held reported that the civilians
were "guests of the NRA" at a hotel near Kasese, 175 miles west of
Kampala.
The NRA spokesman, Sam Kiseke, said that about 10 military
personnel among the passengers were being held as "prisoners of
war" and were undergoing "re-education."
Argentina Indicts War Planners
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — A military prosecutor urged
prison terms yesterday for a former president and two other armed
forces commanders who took Argentina to war in 1982 in the belief
that the British would never fight for the Falkland Islands.
The officers, including former President Leopoldo Galtieri, are
accused of military negligence in a 240-page indictment presented to
a court-martial by Brig. Hector Canale, judge advocate of the armed
forces.
In the name of military secrecy, the court-martial has been closed
to the public since it began two years ago, and the two-week sum
ming up that began yesterday also is closed. But details have been
widely leaked.
The charges, brought by the junta that replaced Galtieri following
the Argentine surrender on June 14, 1982, deal only with alleged mil
itary bungling and do not take into account any political errors, in
cluding refusal to accept international mediation, that may have con
tributed to the Argentine defeat.
Galtieri was both president and army commander when he or
dered the April 2, 1982, invasion of the Falklands, a British colony off
Argentina. The Argentines call the islands the Malvinas and have
claimed them for more than a century. Adm. Jorge Anaya and Air
Force Brig. Basilio Lami Dozo were members of the junta that Gal
tieri headed.
In all, 16 officers are accused of negligence in the prosecution of
the war. The indictment charges that the Galtieri junta believed that
occupation of the islands, home to about 2,000 English-speaking
sheep farmers, would enhance Argentina's negotiating position.
The indictment contends that the junta failed to anticipate an
armed British response to the invasion and that it ignored repeated
warnings from Washington that the United States would side with the
British.
Minister Warns of Rebel Power
MANILA, Philippines — Philippine Defense Minister Juan Ponce
Enrile said yesterday that the communist-led insurgency here could

that of President Ferdinand Marcos.

year with continued U. S. military aid.
"I am not that optimistic," Enrile told a press forum here. "I think
