## Reagan Signals He Will Not Give Up SDI 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” President
Reagan, clearly mindful of the hard
bargaining he will soon face with
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev,
again signaled yesterday that he
would not surrender the U.S. right
to research his controversial "Star
Wars" missile defense program.
"The surest way to keep a peace
going is to stay strong," Reagan
said in a Veterans Day ceremony at
Arlington National Cemetery.
"Strength is a declaration that can
not be misunderstood."
Although Reagan did not specifi
cally mention his Strategic Defense
Initiative, as the "Star Wars" pro
gram is officially known, it contin
ues to dominate pre-summit discus
sions and is considered by both
sides to be the major obstacle to
any arms agreement at the Nov.
19-20 summit in Geneva.
With the prospects of any con
crete results from the summit con
sidered bleak, Reagan reminded
the nation of what is at stake when
the two superpowers meet next
week. Those who have died in war,

he said, "were victims of a peace
process that failed."
The president also foreshadowed
his approach to his meeting with
Gorbachev, telling an audience of
6,000 under sunny skies that peace
fails "when you forget to bring to
the bargaining table God's first in
tellectual gift to man: common
sense."

After placing a wreath at the
Tomb of the Unknowns, Reagan
said, "A week from now, when I am
some thousands of miles away,
believe me, the memory and the
importance of this day will be in the
forefront of my mind and in my
heart."
The Soviets are seeking a ban on
space weapons and an agreement

not to proceed with what they term
the militarization of outer space.
Administration officials, meanwhile,
say they will not accept any prohibi
tions on research into the "Star
Wars" program, but they are willing
to discuss restraints during the pro
gram's developmental and testing
phases.
Because the two sides are so far
apart, prospects are minimal for
even a modest agreement in
Geneva. National security adviser
Robert McFaiiane has said publicly
that the meeting is unlikely to
produce even a joint communique,
the diplomatic paper routinely
issued at the conclusion of a
meeting between heads of govern
ment.
Senior arms control adviser Paul
Nitze is the only top official who has
sounded optimistic in the least in his
public statements. Nitze says he
believes there is a chance the su
perpowers will agree on a set of
guidelines for future arms talks that
could give momentum to the stalled
process.

presents a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery during the an
nual Veterans Day ceremony yesterday.
