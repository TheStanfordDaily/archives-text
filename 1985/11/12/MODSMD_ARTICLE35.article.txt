# Congress Faces Impending Fiscal Crisis
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Still divided after weeks of
effort, Congress returns today to negotiations
aimed at breaking a deadlock over balanced
budget legislation. Failure could lead not only to
a government shutdown but to an unprece
dented financial default by the federal treasury at
week's end.
Adding to the deadline pressure, a financial
default and resulting government chaos would
occur at an inopportune time for President
Reagan — on the eve of his departure Saturday
for his summit with the Soviets.
A White House spokesman said the Adminis
tration is still demanding action by Thursday.
For more than a month, Congress has argued
over legislation to extend the federal debt

ceiling, an action legally necessary to give the
government the authority to continue borrowing
to finance its operations. It has attached the debt
bill to new, controversial legislation that would
force a balanced budget over the next four or
five years by requiring the president to cut
spending that does not meet fixed deficit targets.
Despite intensive negotiations, the political
scorecard on the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legis
lation is, if anything, more confused. The Repub
lican Senate has approved one version, and the
Democratic House has approved another that
protects more programs for the poor, could cut
defense more and requires deeper cuts in 1986.
Distracted by this and other problems,
Congress has also failed thus far to pass most of

its regular appropriations bills that allow govern
ment agencies to spend money during the fiscal
year that began Oct. 1. To keep the agencies in
spending money, one short-term "continuing
resolution" has already been approved; another
must be approved by Thursday. That is neces
sary even if the debt-ceiling problem is solved or
postponed.
Failure to meet the Thursday continuing
resolution deadlines would leave the government
without cash to operate, a situation that has oc
curred for brief periods. But failure to meet the
debt-ceiling deadline would leave the govern
ment without power to borrow and facing finan
cial default for the first time, according to the
Treasury Department.
