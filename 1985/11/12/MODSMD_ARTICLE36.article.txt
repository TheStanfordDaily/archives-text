Arms Report Issued
WASHINGTON — A long-awaited Defense
Department study of Soviet arms-agreement
violations, which will be sent to President
Reagan today or tomorrow, accuses Moscow
of systematically breaking treaties to-gain mili
tary advantages but does not recommend any
U.S. responses, Administration sources said
yesterday.
The 70-page report has been considered im
portant because of its scheduled arrival at the
White House only a week before Reagan's
summit meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev in
Geneva, where the president is expected to
press the Soviet leader on arms violations.
The study, drafted primarily by Assistant
Defense Secretary Richard Perle, generally
recounts details of alleged Soviet violations
already made public by the Administration. It
contains no new revelations, sources said, al
though it will include some indication of possi
ble future violations.
The study was ordered in June by the Na
tional Security Council in the wake of a major
intergovernmental battle over how to respond
to Soviet violations.
The report being sent to Reagan this week,
with a 12-page executive summary, will con
tain a "careful and deliberate analysis" of past
Soviet actions and their "significance," one
senior official said.
The study, which one Pentagon official has
dubbed "RSVP" — Response to Soviet Viola
tions Policy — is the latest symbol of pre
summit maneuvering within the Reagan Ad
ministration. Perle, a relentless critic of the

Soviets and past arms agreements, has been
described in news reports as delaying the
study to prevent other officials from reviewing
and tempering it before Reagan leaves for
Geneva on Saturday.
Royal Visit Continues
WASHINGTON — Capping their stay in the
nation's capital, Prince Charles and Princess
Diana paid a visit yesterday to suburbia, where
they mingled with 6,000 fans at a J.C. Penney
store, gazed quizzically at a two-and-a-half-ton
Rolls-Royce perched on four Wedgwood
teacups and fomented a royal fuss by browsing
through maternity clothes.
The shopping tour began a day that contin
ued on a more somber note as the royal couple
laid a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery
and Diana visited a controversial drug
rehabilitation center with First Lady Nancy
Reagan. The prince and princess, who travel
tomorrow to Palm Beach, Fla., ended their
tour of Washington with a black-tie dinner at
the National Gallery of Art, where guests in
cluded justices of the Supreme Court and
Olympic gold medalist Mary Lou Retton.
Mormons Pick Leader
SALT LAKE CITY — Ezra Taft Benson,
86, a once outspoken national figure on the po
litical right who has reportedly moderated with
age, was formally named yesterday as the new
prophet-president of the 5.8-million-member
Mormon Church.

Benson had been expected to succeed
Spencer Kimball, who died last Tuesday at age
90, because the church's Council of the 12
Apostles has always elevated the man with the
most seniority on the council.
Benson, who served as • secretary of
agriculture from 1953 to 1961 under President
Dwight Eisenhower, was intermittently men
tioned as a potential presidential candidate or
running mate in the '60s, and by fledgling
right-wing third parties in the early '70s. He
at times expressed admiration for the John
Birch Society and its anti-communist zeal.
Benson's statements of recent years have
been confined to religious doctrine, although
as late as 1979 he warned church members
that America must not tolerate "appeasement"
of communism, a policy that he said did not
prevent "the takeover of Nicaragua, the sur
render of the Panama Canal" or infiltration of
America by enemy agents.
Market Surges Ahead
NEW YORK — Stock prices surged ahead
yesterday, lifting the Dow Jones industrial
average and some other leading indexes to
new highs in the market's strongest day in
more than 10 months.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
jumped 27.52 to 1,431.88, for its biggest gain
since it climbed 34.01 points last Jan. 21.
It was the sixth time in the last nine sessions
that the Dow set a record. Volume on the
New York Stock Exchange reached 126.54
million shares, up from 114.96 million Friday.
