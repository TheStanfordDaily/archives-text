Storms Move South
Skiers rejoiced and travelers groaned yes
terday as a chilly arctic storm moved into
Southern California, dumping snow in the
mountains and forcing closure of some roads.
Heavy afternoon snow slowed traffic to a
crawl on Interstate 5, a major north-south ar
tery, and Interstate 15, which connects South
ern California with Las Vegas.
Snowfall in the mountains ranged from five
inches in Southern California's ranges to
several feet in the Sierra Nevada.
The storm, which blanketed "the whole
West Coast, and then some," is expected to
ease early today, according to weather service
specialist Bill Hoffer.
Traffic over the mountain passes north of
Los Angeles bogged down when 1-5 was partly

closed shortly after 6 p.m. Cars were allowed
to move only in convoys of 100, led by
snowplows and sand trucks, said California
Highway Patrol officer Lou Warnick.
Road crews were concerned that the after
noon's increasing snowfall might hamper travel
at Mountain Pass north of Baker, said Jay
Smart, maintenance superintendent with the
California Department of Transportation.
"It seems 80 percent of the people don't
have chains," Smart said.
Lab Plans X-Ray Test
LIVERMORE — The Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory is proceeding with plans
for a $30 million test of its nuclear-driven X
ray laser weapon despite charges from other
government scientists that there are serious

flaws in the experiment's design, the Los An
geles Times has learned.
The decision to proceed with the top-secret
test, code-named Goldstone, next month at
the Nevada nuclear test site also ignores warn
ings from some of Livermore's own experts —
as well as from scientists at the government's
other weapons lab at Los Alamos, N.M. —
that a design error in a key measuring device
used in all past tests has caused it to give false
readings.
The X-ray laser weapon has been the most
publicized element in President Reagan's Stra
tegic Defense Initiative, or "Star Wars" pro
gram. But past claims for the weapon's suc
cess have now been called into question, in
cluding the most recent $30 million test, which
was conducted in March and code-named
Cottage.
