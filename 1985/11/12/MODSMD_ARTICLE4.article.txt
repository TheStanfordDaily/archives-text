# Trustees Consider Expansion, Hoover
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
In a "non-controversial" gather
ing, the Board of Trustees yester
day began a two-day meeting by
taking the first steps toward ap
proving a new Board of Overseers
for the Hoover Institution and
hearing a report on the expansion of
Stanford Medical Center, according
to Bob Hamrdla, assistant to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy.
In their closed meeting at the
Lou Henry Hoover Building, the
trustees also discussed funding for
new safety devices in the McCul
lough Building laboratories and a
measure that would make the Uni
versity liable for any lawsuit
brought against one of its trustees.
In yesterday's meeting of the
Committee on Academic Affairs and
Development, the members ap
proved a recommendation that Alf
Brandon, William Coberly, Jr., John
Grey, Kenneth Khachigian and Jack
Parker be appointed to the Hoover
board. The entire Board of Trus
tees will vote on the recommenda
tion tomorrow, according to
Hamrdla, who said he sat in on
some of the trustees' meetings yes
terday.
When an identical list of names
was put before the board in May,
the trustees deferred a decision,
asking that the committee find a
more diverse group, according to
junior Mike Collins, a member of
the Council of Presidents (COP)
who attended yesterday's meeting
of the trustee Committee on Aca
demic Affairs.
The committee also recom
mended tor the approval of the
entire board the re-appointments of
current overseers Roger Milliken

and C.H. Tung, according to
Collins.
As part of the medical center's
ongoing expansion program, the
entire board saw a slide show and
heard a report by David Hopkins,
executive assistant vice-president
for Medical Affairs, on the history
and development of the center.
"It was just an informational
meeting at this point," Trustee
James Ware said afterward.
Although no specific construction
plans are on the trustees' agenda
for this week's meeting, more de
velopment at the medical center is
planned, according Leslie Leland,
another COP member who also at
tended the meeting. "Some
(development) is approved and
some is still in the design stage,"
she said.
In other business, the board's
Committee on Finance and Admin
istration approved between $1.3
and $2.2 million in safety improve
ments in the McCullough Engineer
ing Building, according to Leland.
The plan calls for "relocation of
the processes involving hazardous
production materials out of the
basement, five new and separate
exhaust systems . . . gas detec
tion, gas vaults, fire protection sys
tems and emergency power," ac
cording to the proposal in the
meeting's agenda.
Under another proposal ap
proved by the finance committee,
the University would be liable for all
lawsuits brought against the trus
tees, "provided that the Board of
Trustees determines that such
trustees acted in good faith and in a
manner . . . believed to be in the
best interests of the institution."
The full board will consider ap
proval of both of these proposals
today.
