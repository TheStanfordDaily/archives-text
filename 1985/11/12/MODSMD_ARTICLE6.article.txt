# The 						Biggest Little Black Book
## Student directories to be distributed Friday and Monday 
### ROBERT ENO 
A year's work and a $50,000 investment will
be realized this week with the distribution of the
long-awaited student directories on Fiiday and
Monday.
Putting together the student directory is a
year-round operation, but the majority of the
work is done during the summer, according to
Project Manager Michael Banks.
Eight students, including the project manager,
editor, business manager and several advertising
representatives, work 40 hours per week during
the entire summer. For Banks and Editor Felicia
Lee, the 40-hour-a-wee! load persisted into the
first few weeks of classes.
The majority of time is spent obtaining ads
from local businesses. The ads must cover the
directory's $50,000 budget, since the University
provides no funding.
"Because of the effort of the ad reps and a
great sales pitch, we raised almost $60,000 this
year," Banks said.
Some of this surplus will be left to next year's
staff. The rest is to be donated to charitv.

The ad reps, most of whom
had previous experience in
working at The Daily, under
went training at the beginning of
the summer, Banks said.
There were some instances
for which no training could
prepare them. Banks recalled a
morning meeting in pursuit of an
ad at a local beer distributor.
During the meeting a company
executive offered him and ad rep
Victor Johnson some ale.
Despite the time and the ale's
bad taste, they accepted and
drank the ale. And got the ad.
The staff contacted all of last
year's advertisers plus 700 addi
tional companies. Roughly 300
companies took out ads, ranging
up to $890 for a full page ad, in
this year's edition.
For various reasons, some ad
vertisers refused to renew their
ads. A local nudist club, for ex
ample, declined because of a
poor response to last year's
coupon, which read: "$1 off ini
tial guest visit."
According to the members of
the directory office, the direc
tories cannot be made available
sooner because most students
do not have phones when they
register for fall quarter. They
must be given a period of a few
weeks to give their phone num
ber to the Registrar's Office,
which compiles the list.
The registrar records the in
formation on magnetic tape and
sends it to be typeset. Mean
while, the directory staff lays out
the advertisement, University
information and department list
ings sections that comprise the
rest of the directory.
Surprisingly, the directory
staff spends only a cpuple of
hours on the student listings.
They merely check the typeset
list for accuracy.

After this information is
brought together, the directory
is sent to the printer.
Three weeks later, the direc
tories are ready for distribution.
All undergraduate and graduate
students will receive a copy of
the directory. Faculty and staff
will also be able to obtain copies.
The staff of the directory of
fice said that they wish that stu
dents would better utilize this
resource.
Business Manager Ann Whit
ley advised that students "sit
down and look at the whole
directory. The Yellow Pages
(section of the student directory)
are a good listing of local busi
nesses."
The directory has been im
proved every year, according to
Whitley. This issue is a
"quantum leap" over last year's,
she said.
One noticable improvement is
the reduction of unlisted num
bers. This year there are over
1,000 more complete listings.
Banks pointed out that the
current system for compiling the
directories is not perfect. It is
impossible to include the listings of
students who have stopped out
for fall quarter, or who are not
on the registrar's list due to their
unregistered status, he said.
The phone system in the Stan
ford area will undergo a change
this winter that will result in new
phone numbers for many Uni
versity phones. Fortunately,
student phones will be unaf
fected.
Many of the department num
bers listed in the directory will
be obsolete, however. Banks
said that both numbers were in
cluded for the few departments
aware of their new numbers.
It will be impossible to update
the listings for the others. In or
der to reach the new number,
though, one must simply dial the
old number. A recording will as
sist the caller.


The pages of the Stanford Student Directory provide a
handy listing each year of student names, majors, local
and permanent addresses and phone numbers.

The pages of the Stanford Student Directory provide a
handy listing each year of student names, majors, local
and permanent addresses and phone numbers.
A year's work and a $50,000 investment will
be realized this week with the distribution of the
long-awaited student directories on Fiiday and
Monday.
Putting together the student directory is a
year-round operation, but the majority of the
work is done during the summer, according to
Project Manager Michael Banks.
Eight students, including the project manager,
editor, business manager and several advertising
representatives, work 40 hours per week during
the entire summer. For Banks and Editor Felicia
Lee, the 40-hour-a-wee! load persisted into the
first few weeks of classes.
The majority of time is spent obtaining ads
from local businesses. The ads must cover the
directory's $50,000 budget, since the University
provides no funding.
"Because of the effort of the ad reps and a
great sales pitch, we raised almost $60,000 this
year," Banks said.
Some of this surplus will be left to next year's
staff. The rest is to be donated to charitv.

The ad reps, most of whom
had previous experience in
working at The Daily, under
went training at the beginning of
the summer, Banks said.
There were some instances
for which no training could
prepare them. Banks recalled a
morning meeting in pursuit of an
ad at a local beer distributor.
During the meeting a company
executive offered him and ad rep
Victor Johnson some ale.
Despite the time and the ale's
bad taste, they accepted and
drank the ale. And got the ad.
The staff contacted all of last
year's advertisers plus 700 addi
tional companies. Roughly 300
companies took out ads, ranging
up to $890 for a full page ad, in
this year's edition.
For various reasons, some ad
vertisers refused to renew their
ads. A local nudist club, for ex
ample, declined because of a
poor response to last year's
coupon, which read: "$1 off ini
tial guest visit."
According to the members of
the directory office, the direc
tories cannot be made available
sooner because most students
do not have phones when they
register for fall quarter. They
must be given a period of a few
weeks to give their phone num
ber to the Registrar's Office,
which compiles the list.
The registrar records the in
formation on magnetic tape and
sends it to be typeset. Mean
while, the directory staff lays out
the advertisement, University
information and department list
ings sections that comprise the
rest of the directory.
Surprisingly, the directory
staff spends only a cpuple of
hours on the student listings.
They merely check the typeset
list for accuracy.

After this information is
brought together, the directory
is sent to the printer.
Three weeks later, the direc
tories are ready for distribution.
All undergraduate and graduate
students will receive a copy of
the directory. Faculty and staff
will also be able to obtain copies.
The staff of the directory of
fice said that they wish that stu
dents would better utilize this
resource.
Business Manager Ann Whit
ley advised that students "sit
down and look at the whole
directory. The Yellow Pages
(section of the student directory)
are a good listing of local busi
nesses."
The directory has been im
proved every year, according to
Whitley. This issue is a
"quantum leap" over last year's,
she said.
One noticable improvement is
the reduction of unlisted num
bers. This year there are over
1,000 more complete listings.
Banks pointed out that the
current system for compiling the
directories is not perfect. It is
impossible to include the listings of
students who have stopped out
for fall quarter, or who are not
on the registrar's list due to their
unregistered status, he said.
The phone system in the Stan
ford area will undergo a change
this winter that will result in new
phone numbers for many Uni
versity phones. Fortunately,
student phones will be unaf
fected.
Many of the department num
bers listed in the directory will
be obsolete, however. Banks
said that both numbers were in
cluded for the few departments
aware of their new numbers.
It will be impossible to update
the listings for the others. In or
der to reach the new number,
though, one must simply dial the
old number. A recording will as
