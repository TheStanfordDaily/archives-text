## Student directories to be distributed Friday and Monday 
### ROBERT ENO 
A year's work and a $50,000 investment will
be realized this week with the distribution of the
long-awaited student directories on Fiiday and
Monday.
Putting together the student directory is a
year-round operation, but the majority of the
work is done during the summer, according to
Project Manager Michael Banks.
Eight students, including the project manager,
editor, business manager and several advertising
representatives, work 40 hours per week during
the entire summer. For Banks and Editor Felicia
Lee, the 40-hour-a-wee! load persisted into the
first few weeks of classes.
The majority of time is spent obtaining ads
from local businesses. The ads must cover the
directory's $50,000 budget, since the University
provides no funding.
"Because of the effort of the ad reps and a
great sales pitch, we raised almost $60,000 this
year," Banks said.
Some of this surplus will be left to next year's
staff. The rest is to be donated to charitv.
