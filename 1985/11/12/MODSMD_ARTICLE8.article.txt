# Study Scrutinizes Pilots on Pot

### ERIC HEALY Staff writer 
Smoking marijuana may result in
a loss of physical and mental coor
dination for up to 24 hours, accord
ing to a new study by Stanford
Medical School and Veterans Ad
ministration researchers.
The study, which is believed to
be the first to explore day-after ef
fects of marijuana on people who
perform tasks involving complex
physical and mental coordination,
was conducted by Dr. Jerome
Yesavage, assistant professor of
psychiatry and behavioral science;
Dr. Leo Hollister, professor of
medicine/clinical pharmacology; and
Dr. Von Otto Leirer, psychiatry re
search associate.
"The findings (of the study) sug
gest that the carry-over effects
may be related to any sort of com
plex human-machine interaction,"
Leirer said, defining "complex" as
involving a "lot of human thinking
and complex behavioral acts."
In the study, airplane pilots were
tested at intervals of one, four and
24 hours after smoking a marijuana

cigarette. Although the detrimental
effects on the pilots' abilities were
less marked as more time passed,
"significant detriments in perfor
mance" were still apparent after 24
hours, according to Leirer.
During the tests that were con
ducted one hour and four hours
after the intake of marijuana, pilots

'Even though they thought they were
fine, they still performed with detri
ments. — D r> y on Q tto L e i r er

admitted they "still experienced the
subjective effects of the drug,"
Leirer said, adding that well after
pilots did not feel any of the
"subjective effects" of the drug,
their performance was still
negatively affected.
"Even though they thought they
were fine, they still performed with
detriments," he said.
"The big issues were take-offs
and landings, the two critical parts
of piloting an aircraft," said Leirer.
Pilots were tested at the Palo Alto

Veterans Medical Center in a flight
simulatoi comparable in handling to
that of a single-engine plane.
After an initial flight simulation,
pilots were given a cigarette con
taining "the equivalent of a strong
social dose." 19 milligrams of
tetrahydrocannibinol (THC), the
nrtivp ingredient in marijuana, ac-

cording to the researchers. The
after-effects of the drug on take-off
and landing procedure were then
documented during further tlight
simulations.
In addition to pointing out the
study's utility in reducing drug
related accidents in jobs such as
"operating complicated heavy
equipment, railway trains and
switching procedures," Yesavage
said the study should also prove es
pecially helpful in combating drug
related mishaps.

Among tln v errors pilots made
were exaggerated and uncommonly
frequent movements of the
ailerons, the movable wing parts
that provide side-to-side control of
the plane, and the elevators, re
sponsible for vertical control of the
aircraft.
Pilots also had trouble landing in
tht' center of the runway without
excessive vertical and lateral devia
tion in the approach. "The near
doubling of lateral deviation on a
landing .it 24 hours may be an ex
tremely serious error. ... In ac
tual flight, where there is wind and
turbulence, such errors can easily
lead to crashes," the researchers
said in the study, noting that one of
the 24-hour tests ended in an off
runway landing.
In the study, Yesavage also
pressed for more experiments in
volving the use of alcohol by pilots,
saying he feels the "bottle to
throttle" guidelines of eight hours
for commercial pilots and 12 hours
for military pilots may be outdated.
Yesavage and his groups are,
however, not currently conducting
anv such research.
