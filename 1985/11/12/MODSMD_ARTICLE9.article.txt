## An Independent Newspaper Investigate Fairly 
### 
The ASSU Senate's vote last week to create a
special committee to investigate student allegations
of police brutality was a necessary step. The Uni
versity's in-house report, prepared by Law Prof.
John Kaplan as a "personal favor" to President
Donald Kennedy, contains serious deficiencies that
can best be addressed in an independent forum.
Stanford police officers have yet to be disciplined
for what the Kaplan report recognizes as "wrong
and unjustifiable" methods in the arrests of nine stu
dents at an anti-apartheid sit-in Oct. 11. Indeed,
Kaplan takes pains to praise the University's police
force and brushes off allegations of misconduct by
saying the faulty practices have been discontinued.
The Kaplan report also suggests a University
double standard: Students here are not insulated
from the law, but as it stands now, the Stanford

police force is insulated from disciplinary action. And
events at the North County Jail, from which senior
Robby Perkins emerged with bruises, remain a
mystery after the Kaplan report.
The senate investigation must seek to answer
these questions and more. But to do this effectively,
the senate committee cannot be limited to students.
It must also include faculty — from Stanford and
other universities — police from other jurisdictions,
legal experts and community members. Such a dis
tribution would reduce the stigma of bias that has
plagued the Kaplan report.
Ultimately, the results of the senate investigation
must be carefully reviewed by the University. We
urge the University to support the investigation
now, and to prepare to act on its findings.
