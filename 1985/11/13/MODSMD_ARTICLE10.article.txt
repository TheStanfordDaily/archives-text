# 'Bottom-up' plan to cut costs
## Hospital Begins Management Shift 
### LYNN MARCUS Senior staff writer 
The University has launched a project to see if a
new management system at Stanford Hospital —
one led by doctors, nurses and technicians instead
of administrators — can help other hospitals cut
health care costs.
In the project, which is backed by a $200,000
two-year grant from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation,
a team from Stanford Medical Center will seek to
implement the new management system at
Children's Hospital of San Francisco and San Fran
cisco General Hospital.
The project's goal is to "see whether we can in
stitute the same process at two very different kinds
of hospitals," according to Stanford Hospital Chief of
Staff James Silverman, who heads the investigative
team.
The process underway at Stanford is "sort of a
bottom-up type of management system, where you

use the people who are taking care of patients to
decide where the cuts can best be made" rather
than having such decisions made by hospital
managers, Silverman said.
Silverman, also associate dean for Clinical Affairs
at the medical center, said there are likely to be
problems when other types of hospitals try to use
the procedures for cost containment developed at a
university hospital. San Francisco General is a
public teaching hospital, and the Children's Hospital
of San Francisco is a private institution affiliated with
the University of California.
"We want to see whether ... a public hospital or
a private hospital could take our guidelines and make
them work there. We're going to take our process,
test it and re-define it," Silverman said.
"Now that hospitals are squeezed, as funds
become less, patient care decisions should be made
by the people who are taking care of the patients —
the physicians, nurses and technicians. They're the
ones who can allocate resources the best," Silver
man said.
