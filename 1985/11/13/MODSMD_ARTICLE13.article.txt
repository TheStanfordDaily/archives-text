As hard as it may be to admit, Sen. Jesse Helms
said it best: Miroslav Medvid, the Ukrainian who
twice jumped ship off New Orleans last week —
only to be twice returned by U.S. officials — is a
"dead duck." Well aware that the 25-year-old sailor
would face less than a hero's welcome if he returned
to the Soviet Union, the Administration this week
opted to punish two minor U.S. officials instead of
taking every possible step to keep Medvid in the
United States.
Not that the officials — border patrol agents
from the Immigration and Naturalization Service —
should not be punished. In the words of INS Com
missioner Alan Nelson, the agents "made a mistake
in not following the guidelines" when they forcibly
returned Medvid to the Soviet freighter Marshall
Koniev hours after his first defection attempt on
Oct. 24.
That Medvid wanted to leave the Soviet Union
was never really in doubt. Later in the day, as the
INS launch carrying the would-be defector ap
proached the Marshall Koniev, Medvid broke free
— and again jumped into the Mississippi. The same
INS agents who rescued Medvid proceeded immedi
ately to turn him over to Soviet authorities.

What happened aboard the Marshall Koniev,
where Medvid spent the next four days, is the sub
ject of grim speculation. We know Medvid tried to
kill himself, most likely after hearing Soviet officials
had plans to punish his family. In any case, Medvid
"definitely changed his mind," according to Secre
tary of State George Shultz, who declared the case
closed.
Helms, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, was not satisfied. In a move designed
to give the would-be defector a second chance, the
North Carolina Republican subpoenaed Medvid to
testify before Congress.
The U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. Coast
Guard said they would carry out the subpoena, but
in the end, the decision was President Reagan's. On
Saturday, the Marshall Koniev entered international
waters, and Medvid was gone.
It is ironic that after his first defection attempt,
Medvid told U.S. officials he wanted a chance "to
live in an honest country." As Medvid's name disap
pears from the headlines, we are left to wonder
along with Helms: "Maybe we threw this guy to the
wolves because we're getting ready for Geneva."
