On Nov. 4, new hope unfolded concerning the issue
of arms control. In an interview with four Soviet jour
nalists, President Reagan's remarks regarding the
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) led the media to
believe that a "new policy" had been adopted.
Instead of maintaining an uncompromising position
on his "space-defense shield," the "new policy" pro
posed a contingency plan: U.S. deployment of its nu
clear defense system would be contingent on reduction

VIEWPOINT

of offensive arms by both the United States and the So
viet Union. This so-called contingency clause would
provide new hope for arms control'talks, since
Reagan's hard-line stance on SDI has been a major
stumbling block in negotiations between the two
powers.
Unfortunately, Reagan's aides made it clear later
that there had been a misunderstanding resulting from
a verbal error by the president. In short, there was no
change in the inflexible policy. So much for new hope.
Ironically, this misunderstanding reflects a deeper
misunderstanding inherent in the Administration's
arms control policy. The fundamental problem in the
policy is that no defense system, not even a seven
layered one, will be effective as long as the United
States continues to increase the quantity and quality of
its offensive nuclear arsenal, forcing the Soviet Union

to match it step for step. The Administration does not
understand that an effective defensive system cannot
be realized until after offensive arms have been ap
preciably reduced. Disarmament is an essential prere
quisite to the development of nuclear defense systems.
This failure to understand the mechanisms of sociol
ogy produces the fundamental problem confronting the
Administration. Physicist Sidney Drell, in his lecture to
the students of Political Science 35 last Monday after
noon, stated that the effective deployment of SDI is
not a technical problem but a political problem. As long
as each superpower perceives the other's formidable
arsenal to be potentially offensive, the arms
< race will continue to escalate, rendering any defense
system impotent. '' ~ , tv
In short, the imaginary "new policy's" contingency
clause was its main strength. Since SDI, sitting atop a
huge offensive arsenal, threatens the Soviets, ap
preciable progress in arms control negotiations is not
likely. However, if our Administration sees the light
and adopts a contingency clause, Kremlin fears may be
relieved, and disarmament could actually be achieved.
In any case, the summit between Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev is rapidly approaching. I hope
that our leaders consider the fanciful tenets of a "new
policy" and, thereby, take the power of common sense
to the bargaining tables.
