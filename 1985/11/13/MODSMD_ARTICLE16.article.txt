## Don't Ignore Refugees 
### 
In 1984, Anna, a 20-year-old El Salvador native,
was forced to watch three soldiers from a right-wing
death squad peel her uncle's skin off with machetes
before they murdered him along with one of her
cousins. The soldiers then turned to the women of the
family, beating and raping Anna and two of her cousins.
Anna survived the attack, but one of the men who had
raped her and murdered her uncle tracked her down
and threatened to kill her entire family if she told
anyone what had happened. Her employer was so
worried about her safety that he raised the money she

VIEWPOINT

needed to get out of the country and into the United
States.
On her first day here, Anna was picked up by the Im
migration and Naturalization Service (INS). After
hearing her story at the deportation hearing, the
presiding judge denied political asylum for Anna and or
dered her deported, stating, "You can pick up the
newspaper everyday and read about the same thing
happening in any urban area of the U.S." Later, when
appealing casf, a.prqsecutortfor the INS charged
that Anna's case "almost borders on the frivolous."
The outcome of Anna's hearings is not exceptional
among Central American refugees. In hearings that
typically last less than an hour, these refugees tell their
tales of persecution, imprisonment, torture and narrow
escape only to be perfunctorily denied political asylum.
As one might guess, individuals fleeing violence in a
country unfriendly to the United States fare much bet
ter in INS hearings. While only 2 percent of El Sal
vadoran refugees and an even smaller percentage of
Guatemalans are granted political asylum, 78.2 percent
of all refugees from the Soviet Union and 75.8 percent
of Iranian refugees are given this status.
The policy of refusing to grant political asylum to vir-

tually all Central American refugees violates several
U.S. statutes and treaties. The 1980 Refugee Act
states that anyone who faces the risk of persecution in
his homeland has a right to political asylum, a fact the
INS avoids by claiming that persons like Anna have fled
for "economic" reasons and would not face persecution
in their native countries. The United States is the only
signatory of the United Nations Protocol on Refugees
which deports El Salvadorans and Guatemalans.
In addition, Article 45 of the Geneva Convention
states explicitly that refugees cannot be returned to a
country at war such as El Salvador. Nor may refugees
be sent to any state that has not satisfactorily demon
strated a willingness or ability to comply with
humanitarian norms, a category that both El Salvador
and Guatemala would fall under.
But in spite of these statutes and treaties, the INS
continues to send hundreds of Central American
refugees back to El Salvador and Guatemala every
week. In response to these deportations, over 200
churches, synagogues and meeting houses have
declared their places of worship to be sanctuaries for
anyone fleeing the violence of Central America. The
INS usually will not enter a church to arrest persons it
considers to be illegal aliens, although there have been
several well-publicized exceptions. This movement has
expanded to many universities, including UCLA and
UC-Berkeley, where students have declared their
campuses to be sanctuaries. To date, over 60,000
people are involved in the sanctuary movement.
We believe this issue has not received the attention
it deserves within the Stanford community. When
thousands of Jews were fleeing the repression of the
Third Reich, the United States closed its doors. Let us
not make this mistake again.
