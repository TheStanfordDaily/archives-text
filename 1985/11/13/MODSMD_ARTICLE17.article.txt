# U.S. Destiny Lies in Confrontation
## 
### 
The upcoming summit meeting between the
United States and the Soviet Union on Nov. 19
and 20 in Geneva raises an important issue in
public debate: just what kind of a relationship the
two superpowers should have. Many people are
hopeful that an arms control agreement will be
reached, and the prospects for peace enhanced.
But our Administration has downplayed the im
portance of the talks, for it realizes that not
much is going to change as a result of the sum
mit.
These alternating hopeful and pessimistic
views stem from two contradictory world views
that have taken hold in our society. The more
idealistic (or liberal) viewpoint seems to advance
the notion that the United States and the Soviet
Union can co-exist peacefully and eventually
reconcile their differences. The "hard-line" (or
more conservative viewpoint) portrays the two
nations as irreconcilable enemies, constantly
struggling for world influence.

This dichotomy of public outlook creates in
credible difficulties for our policy makers.
Around 40 or 50 percent of the voting public
usually holds each view. Thus, it appears our
leaders in Washington usually are forced to
either reconcile the two competing outlooks or
choose one over the other. What often happens
is that they vote one way and speak the other.
Thus, they're covered no matter what. As the
saying goes, "If you can't win 'em, confuse em."
Reconciliation of the two viewpoints is ex
tremely difficult, if not impossible, and is thus
frequently attempted by our leaders. One can
understand the Soviet Union's perception that
our foreign policy looks frequently contradictory
and always confusing. It is no wonder it finds it
difficult to deal with us.
Both viewpoints take for granted that the

people of the United States and most of the
world desire peace and economic prosperity.
How we could achieve this simple, yet complex,
goal is the political question that created these
competing ideologies.
History, however, has shown the "liberal"
policies of dialogue, concessions and detente to
be rather ineffective. The Soviet Union has con
sistently violated every major arms control
agreement and other international accords. It
ignores human rights violations by its own inter
nal security forces and those of its proxies. It
openly supports left-wing terrorism worldwide
and executes or supports communist imperialism
on every continent. The overall effect of detente
seemed to be that the Soviet Union was left
alone to pursue its goals and expand its world
power. It seeks to do whatever it wishes and to
use our belief in meaningful negotiation to limit
U.S. actions.
The conservative outlook falls on the other
end of the spectrum. With its origins in the Cold
War, this mentality tends to see the world's na
tions in one of two opposing camps. Inevitably,
its proponents argue, either the United States or
the Soviet Union will fall. The secret hope of the
conservatives is that eventually the Soviet
Union's police state will face an economic crisis,
a domestic revolt and eventually a political col
lapse. Until this time, however, we must contain
the expansion of Soviet power abroad and
prepare ourselves for war. If left to its own
devices, the Soviet Union will eventually erode
our own world influence and gain control. In
other words, to appease the Soviets is to invite
their expansion.
So, policy makers are hoping for peace
through detente while fearing the growth of So
viet power. Our hearts long for the realization of

international understanding, but our minds tell us
that this is impossible and that we are doomed to
certain conflict.
The Soviet view seems consistent and under
standable. Their paranoia of the West has
imposed a realistic mentality on the Soviet lead
ership. They have used treaties to temporarily
gain concessions from the West while trying to
increase their security. The Soviets seem to un
derstand only force and coercion. They use their
ideology to hide their imperialist actions. Serious
negotiation is impossible with the Soviet Union,
for we are intractable enemies. Only 30 years
ago, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev shouted in
the United Nations, "We will bury you," and that
there would be no peace until the death knell of
communism or capitalism is struck.
We are two nations whose destinies lie in con
frontation. Negotiation, politicians' smiles and
endless arms talks are superficial and meaning
less. The course of our future relations has
already been pre-determined. One of our great
nations will fall — it is the fate of every nation to
eventually do so. The key to our current foreign
policy lies in preparing for that day, for great na
tions usually fall in war.
In the interim, we will continue to play the
media game and shake hands while saying we are
"making progress." Meanwhile, the strategists
in the back rooms of the Kremlin will meet, as
will stategists in the back rooms of the the Pent
agon. They will look at the world and determine
where to move next in search of a strategic edge
that will help when we finally confront one an
other.

the expansion of Soviet power abroad and

The upcoming summit meeting between the
United States and the Soviet Union on Nov. 19
and 20 in Geneva raises an important issue in
public debate: just what kind of a relationship the
two superpowers should have. Many people are
hopeful that an arms control agreement will be
reached, and the prospects for peace enhanced.
But our Administration has downplayed the im
portance of the talks, for it realizes that not
much is going to change as a result of the sum
mit.
These alternating hopeful and pessimistic
views stem from two contradictory world views
that have taken hold in our society. The more
idealistic (or liberal) viewpoint seems to advance
the notion that the United States and the Soviet
Union can co-exist peacefully and eventually
reconcile their differences. The "hard-line" (or
more conservative viewpoint) portrays the two
nations as irreconcilable enemies, constantly
struggling for world influence.

This dichotomy of public outlook creates in
credible difficulties for our policy makers.
Around 40 or 50 percent of the voting public
usually holds each view. Thus, it appears our
leaders in Washington usually are forced to
either reconcile the two competing outlooks or
choose one over the other. What often happens
is that they vote one way and speak the other.
Thus, they're covered no matter what. As the
saying goes, "If you can't win 'em, confuse em."
Reconciliation of the two viewpoints is ex
tremely difficult, if not impossible, and is thus
frequently attempted by our leaders. One can
understand the Soviet Union's perception that
our foreign policy looks frequently contradictory
and always confusing. It is no wonder it finds it
difficult to deal with us.
Both viewpoints take for granted that the

people of the United States and most of the
world desire peace and economic prosperity.
How we could achieve this simple, yet complex,
goal is the political question that created these
competing ideologies.
History, however, has shown the "liberal"
policies of dialogue, concessions and detente to
be rather ineffective. The Soviet Union has con
sistently violated every major arms control
agreement and other international accords. It
ignores human rights violations by its own inter
nal security forces and those of its proxies. It
openly supports left-wing terrorism worldwide
and executes or supports communist imperialism
on every continent. The overall effect of detente
seemed to be that the Soviet Union was left
alone to pursue its goals and expand its world
power. It seeks to do whatever it wishes and to
use our belief in meaningful negotiation to limit
U.S. actions.
The conservative outlook falls on the other
end of the spectrum. With its origins in the Cold
War, this mentality tends to see the world's na
tions in one of two opposing camps. Inevitably,
its proponents argue, either the United States or
the Soviet Union will fall. The secret hope of the
conservatives is that eventually the Soviet
Union's police state will face an economic crisis,
a domestic revolt and eventually a political col
lapse. Until this time, however, we must contain
the expansion of Soviet power abroad and
prepare ourselves for war. If left to its own
devices, the Soviet Union will eventually erode
our own world influence and gain control. In
other words, to appease the Soviets is to invite
their expansion.
