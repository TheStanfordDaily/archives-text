### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
A new Board of Overseers for the Hoover
Institution, safety improvements for an engi
neering building and a measure that would
make the University liable for lawsuits
brought against its trustees were among the
proposals approved yesterday by the Univer
sity Board of Trustees, according to Bob
Hamrdla, assistant to the president.
Each of the items had been approved Mon
day by trustee committees and were submit
ted for the scrutiny of the full board yester
day.
Despite the approvals, however, Hamrdla
said the board had relatively few issues on its
agenda and characterized the meeting as
"routine."
The board, as it usually does in its full
meeting, "went through (and approved) what
had been discussed thoroughly the previous
day (in committee meetings)," according to
Hamrdla, who attended the meeting.
"Members of a board like that need a
chance once in a while to just kick back and
talk with one another," he added.
All but one member of the 33-member

board were present at yesterday's two-hour
and-45-minute meeting in the Lou Henry
Hoover Building, Hamrdla said.
At the recommendation of the Committee
on Academic Affairs and Development, the
board approved a seven-member slate for the
Hoover Board of Overseers, according to
Hamrdla.
Those seven will now be asked to serve on
the institution's board, according to a stipula
tion in the trustees' agenda.
An identical list was proposed at a trustee
meeting in May, but the board then deferred
its decision, asking that a more diverse group
be found, according to Mike Collins, a mem
ber of the Council of Presidents who attended
the Academic Affairs Committee meeting
Monday.
In other business, the board approved be
tween $1.3 and $2.2 million in safety im
provements for the McCullough Engineering
Building.
According to the proposal, recommended
by both the Academic Affairs Committee and
the Committee on Finance and Administra
tion, 46 gas cabinets — mechanisms that fun
nel hazardous gases from the laboratory —
would be installed in the building by
May 1986.
"The potential for and the conse
quences of an accident are suffi
ciently high that the problems in
McCullough are judged to be the
most critical of the safety
motivated facilities problems (on
campus)," the proposal said.
The board also approved a re
commendation by the finance com
mittee that the University assume
financial liability for any lawsuit
brought against a trustee for his or
her actions as a representative of
Stanford, according to Hamrdla.
The University will indemnify
trustees who are sued "provided
that the Board of Trustees
determines that such trustees
acted in good faith and in a manner
which such trustees reasonably
believed to be in the best interests
of the institution," according to the
proposal.
