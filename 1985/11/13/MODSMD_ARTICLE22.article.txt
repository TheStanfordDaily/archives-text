## Synchrotron Swings Into Synch on Farm 
### ANTOINETTE REED Staff writer 
Question one: How do you get a
biologist, a physician, a geologist, a high
particle physicist, a computer scientist (and
a newspaper reporter) all into the same
room?
Answer: Make the room part of the Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory
(SSRL). In the 12 years since its inception,
SSRL has housed projects ranging from the
study of coronary angiography, to the study
of the behavior of metals in semi
conductors, to the search for new chemical
elements in rocks.
Question two: What is a synchrotron?
Answer: "It's a device for accelerating
particles," Arthur Bienenstock, director of
SSRL said, "or more precisely, an appara
tus, consisting of a high-frequency electric
field, coupled with a low-frequency mag
netic field, for imparting very high speed to
charged particles."
According to Bienenstock, the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and
Stanford Positron-Electron Accelerator
Ring (SPEAR) fit together to form a
synchrotron. The high-energy electron
beam produced in SLAC can be accelerated
by magnets into a circular pathway in
SPEAR.
"Whenever charged particles are sub
jected to acceleration," he said, "they lose
energy, radiation is given off and this is

what's known as synchrotron radiation."
When SLAC was first built in 1966, the
intent was primarily to study the behavior
of elementary particles; the collection of
synchrotron radiation was only a side inter
est, but it has bloomed far beyond original
expectations in the last few years.
Indeed, the synchrotron radiation is in
teresting to researchers. Although the radi
ation itself just represents a portion of the
ordinary electromagnetic spectrum, rang
ing from visible light to X-rays, it can be
collected at an intensity and with a
specificity never before possible.
As the 3-billion-volt electron beam from
SLAC travels around SPEAR, at close to
the speed of light, the synchrotron radiation
emitted is 10,000 to 1 million times more
intense than the X-ray beams usually used,
explained Bienenstock.
In order to maximize this intensity,
"wiggler" and "undulator" magnets have
been placed along SPEAR. As their names
suggest, these magnets accelerate each
electron many times, causing it to wiggle
along its circular pathway and emit far more

radiation than it would just traveling in a
circle.
Then, thanks to the unprecedented
smoothness of the radiation spectrum ob
tained, the synchrotron radiation can be
specifically separated into its individual
component frequencies using a complex
system of mirrors and crystals.
"Now what we have here," said
Bienenstock, "is the means of looking at
the environment of individual atomic
species in a complex material." As one ex
ample, he said that the precise relation of
the iron atom in a hemoglobin molecule to
all the atoms immediately around it can be
studied by looking at diffraction of the very
high-energy X-ray beams producible at
SSRL.
In this context, the synchrotron radiation
technique has many advantages over the
usual low-energy X-ray diffraction tech
nique, said Bienenstock. He pointed out
that in order to study any object, your tool
must be finer than the object itself; in order
to study atoms, for example, your tool
must have a shorter wavelength than the

interatomic distances of the materials being
studied.
Because the energy of radiation in
creases, its wavelength decreases, the X
ray beams 1 at SSRL have very short
wavelengths. Bienenstock said that these
can be used to study the complex relation
ships between the iron atom and the sur
rounding atoms of the hemoglobin
molecule.
According to Bienenstock, the great
specificity of frequency with which SSRL
researchers can direct an X-ray beam at the
material they wish to study has permitted
the development of a safe, non-invasive
method for early detection of coronary ar
tery disease. This new type of coronary an
giography, as it is called, should be ready
for use in humans within a year.
The current method of diagnosis, he ex
plained, involves inserting a catheter far
into a patient's blood vessels, even into the
heart, in order to inject a dye that will enter
the coronary arteries and make them
visible on an X-ray.
Coronary arteries are those which supply
oxygen and nutrients to the heart tissue it

self; blockage of the coronary arteries is a
phenomenon which frequently leads to
death of the heart tissue and to heart at
tacks.
"The whole problem with the current
technique," said Bienenstock, "is that the
doctor's office X-ray tube produces a whole
range of X-ray frequencies, and everything
— bone, tissue and dye — shows up as
equally white on the X-ray, so it's hard to
see the coronary arteries, unless you inject
a lot of dye."
But, using just one fact about iodine,
SSRL researchers have overcome this
problem. lodine, which is often used as a
dye, has certain properties that cause it to
show up more distinctly than than bone and
soft tissue on an X-ray film.
Using a computer to "subtract" one X
ray from the other, Bienenstock said that
they can obtain a final image in which only
the iodine, and therefore the major blood
vessels and coronary arteries are visible.
The result is the desired view of the
coronary arteries, with no catheterization
required and very little patient exposure to
radiation.
"Once we try this technique on human
patients," said Bienenstock, "hospitals will
probably begin constructing small particle
accelerator rings to make the procedure
available to many patients.
"It's amazing," he said, "that when
SLAC first started, no one even knew what
to do with synchrotron radiation. Now, I
think we can safely say that we lead the
world in its study."
