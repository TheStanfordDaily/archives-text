## Washington Scores Big for Stanford 
### SCOTT ROTH Staff writer 
Within the next two weeks, Gene Wash
ington's name will be prominent again
around Stanford.
But Washington, a standout receiver with
the Stanford football team and the San
Francisco 49ers, won't be in the news for
something he's done.
Rather, Washington's name will be men
tioned when Brad Muster, Stanford's start
ing fullback, breaks the former Stanford
player's long-standing school record for
catches in a single season.
Washington grabbed 71 passes in 1969,
his senior season. That mark survived the
challenges of the likes of James Lofton,
Tony Hill and KenMargerum.
But then, along came Muster. With 61
catches already this year, Muster has two
full games, against Arizona State Saturday
and then UC-Berkeley on Nov. 23, to bet
ter Washington's 16-year-old mark.
So much for records. Easy come, easy
go-
But Washington deserves attention for
more than his on-field exploits, substantial
though they were. His contributions to his
alma mater go far beyond that clutch third
down reception or the last-minute touch
down grab.
He may have played his last game on the
Stanford Stadium turf some 16 years ago,
but his interest in the school's athletic pro
gram has remained very much alive.
Because of his concern, Washington has
contributed to Stanford's recruiting efforts
and, most recently, to its fundraising pro
gram.
On Sept. 1, Washington began a three
year term on the Cardinal Club's board of
directors. The Cardinal Club is a fundrais
ing organization benefiting women's ath
letics.
Washington jumped from the college
gridiron in 1969 straight into the ranks of
pro ball. He was a first-round selection in
the 1969 NFL draft and quickly flourished.
He earned All-Pro honors with the San
Francisco 49ers from 1970-73 before con
cluding his 11-year pro career with the
Detroit Lions in 1979.
With national exposure on the football
fifeld came national recognition. The alum's
fame made him a natural to help in recruit
ing young talent around the country for the
University.
"It's critically important to use former
players who've been successful to help
recruit," Cardinal Recruiting Coordinator
Dick James said. "It's a valuable tool used
by everybody."
James, who came to Stanford as a mem
ber of Coach Jack Elway's staff, said Wash
ington has "gladly" made phone calls and at
tended receptions on behalf of the football
team. "In the two years that we've been
here, Gene has helped us land a couple of
big recruits," James said.
According to Michelle Hall of the Cardinal
Club, Washington is replacing Jim Plunkett
on the club's board of directors, who "after
two terms, decided to step down."

As a board member, Washington must at
tend four strategy meetings each year. He
and the other board members decide policy
and try to mobilize the club's resources.
Washington's efforts have had an immedi
ate impact. Prior to this year's Stanford-
USC football game, he acted as the master
of ceremonies at an auction benefiting the
Cardinal Club. Thanks to his efforts, the
club pulled in $70,000.
The Cardinal Club is "a young organi
zation. Having big-name alumni help
ing us is a big boost. It gives us good expo
sure, " Hall said when asked about Washing
ton's contributions to her organization's
performance.
After retiring from football in 1979,
Washington started a career in television.
He began as a local sportscaster, then
hosted a youth-oriented show in San Fran
cisco called "Hot Streak." It was his work
on "Hot Streak" that first caught the Card
inal Club's attention.
"He came across as a very well
mannered, articulate gentleman. He
worked well with the young people. He's
the kind of spokesman we need," Hall said.
And Washington was eager to
help. "When you enjoyed your experiences
at a place, you naturally want others to be
able to have the same chance," he said.
"I'm like any other alum who supports his
school. You want to see it prosper and do
well in the future."
Despite his humility about his work for
Stanford, Washington did note one funda
mental difference between himself and
other would-be donors. "Some people can
only give money to Stanford. Others can
only give time. I'm fortunate enough to be
able to give both," he said.
This alumnus may give both time and
money to Stanford these days, but during
his playing career he gave plenty of thrills
to football fans here.
He came from Long Beach to the Farm in
1965 on a football scholarship. Like many
other Stanford athletes, he passed up offers
from more than 40 other schools, including
perennial football factories like USC be
cause "Stanford was the only college that
was strong academically and had a good
program with a winning tradition."
During his first two years with the then-
Indians, Washington played quarterback,
but he made x tlw*#witch teceiveF-in
his junior year. In two years, he managed
to set virtually every Pacific-8 Confer
ence and Stanford receiving record.
Though most of his marks have been
broken since his graduation, he still holds
the record for most yards receiving in a
single season. His 1,117 yards in 1969
remain a benchmark that appears, for the
time being, safe.
After leaving the Farm, Washington
turned his attention to television acting. He
appeared in programs like "Mod Squad" and
"McMillan and Wife."
Presently, he is working in Los Angeles
as a sportscaster. "Working in broadcasting
is very similar to being a professional ath
lete in terms of the discipline, the prepa-

sports and in broadcasting, you
have to gear up for the performance
— and you find out how you're
doing very quickly," he said.
If the rave reviews heaped on
Washington by the Cardinal Club
and Athletic Department officials

are any indication, he is doing very
well, thank you. Well for himself,
and well for the University at the
same time.
Washington's name may not be
atop the school record book
much longer, especially if Muster
has anything to say about it.
But his contributions to Stanford
can't be fully measured by any mere
statistic.

During his first two years with the then-
Indians, Washington played quarterback,
but he made x tlw*#witch teceiveF-in
his junior year. In two years, he managed
to set virtually every Pacific-8 Confer

Though most of his marks have been
broken since his graduation, he still holds
the record for most yards receiving in a
single season. His 1,117 yards in 1969
remain a benchmark that appears, for the
time being, safe.
After leaving the Farm, Washington
turned his attention to television acting. He
appeared in programs like "Mod Squad" and
"McMillan and Wife."
Presently, he is working in Los Angeles
as a sportscaster. "Working in broadcasting

sports and in broadcasting, you

— and you find out how you're
doing very quickly," he said.
If the rave reviews heaped on
Washington by the Cardinal Club
and Athletic Department officials

are any indication, he is doing very
well, thank you. Well for himself,
and well for the University at the
same time.
Washington's name may not be
atop the school record book
much longer, especially if Muster
has anything to say about it.
But his contributions to Stanford
can't be fully measured by any mere
statistic.
Within the next two weeks, Gene Wash
ington's name will be prominent again
around Stanford.
But Washington, a standout receiver with
the Stanford football team and the San
Francisco 49ers, won't be in the news for
something he's done.
Rather, Washington's name will be men
tioned when Brad Muster, Stanford's start
ing fullback, breaks the former Stanford
player's long-standing school record for
catches in a single season.
Washington grabbed 71 passes in 1969,
his senior season. That mark survived the
challenges of the likes of James Lofton,
Tony Hill and KenMargerum.
But then, along came Muster. With 61
catches already this year, Muster has two
full games, against Arizona State Saturday
and then UC-Berkeley on Nov. 23, to bet
ter Washington's 16-year-old mark.
So much for records. Easy come, easy
go-
But Washington deserves attention for
more than his on-field exploits, substantial
though they were. His contributions to his
alma mater go far beyond that clutch third
down reception or the last-minute touch
down grab.
He may have played his last game on the
Stanford Stadium turf some 16 years ago,
but his interest in the school's athletic pro
gram has remained very much alive.
Because of his concern, Washington has
contributed to Stanford's recruiting efforts
and, most recently, to its fundraising pro
gram.
On Sept. 1, Washington began a three
year term on the Cardinal Club's board of
directors. The Cardinal Club is a fundrais
ing organization benefiting women's ath
letics.
Washington jumped from the college
gridiron in 1969 straight into the ranks of
pro ball. He was a first-round selection in
the 1969 NFL draft and quickly flourished.
He earned All-Pro honors with the San
Francisco 49ers from 1970-73 before con
cluding his 11-year pro career with the
Detroit Lions in 1979.
With national exposure on the football
fifeld came national recognition. The alum's
fame made him a natural to help in recruit
ing young talent around the country for the
University.
"It's critically important to use former
players who've been successful to help
recruit," Cardinal Recruiting Coordinator
Dick James said. "It's a valuable tool used
by everybody."
James, who came to Stanford as a mem
ber of Coach Jack Elway's staff, said Wash
ington has "gladly" made phone calls and at
tended receptions on behalf of the football
team. "In the two years that we've been
here, Gene has helped us land a couple of
big recruits," James said.
According to Michelle Hall of the Cardinal
Club, Washington is replacing Jim Plunkett
on the club's board of directors, who "after
two terms, decided to step down."

As a board member, Washington must at
tend four strategy meetings each year. He
and the other board members decide policy
and try to mobilize the club's resources.
Washington's efforts have had an immedi
ate impact. Prior to this year's Stanford-
USC football game, he acted as the master
of ceremonies at an auction benefiting the
Cardinal Club. Thanks to his efforts, the
club pulled in $70,000.
The Cardinal Club is "a young organi
zation. Having big-name alumni help
ing us is a big boost. It gives us good expo
sure, " Hall said when asked about Washing
ton's contributions to her organization's
performance.
After retiring from football in 1979,
Washington started a career in television.
He began as a local sportscaster, then
hosted a youth-oriented show in San Fran
cisco called "Hot Streak." It was his work
on "Hot Streak" that first caught the Card
inal Club's attention.
"He came across as a very well
mannered, articulate gentleman. He
worked well with the young people. He's
the kind of spokesman we need," Hall said.
And Washington was eager to
help. "When you enjoyed your experiences
at a place, you naturally want others to be
able to have the same chance," he said.
"I'm like any other alum who supports his
school. You want to see it prosper and do
well in the future."
Despite his humility about his work for
Stanford, Washington did note one funda
mental difference between himself and
other would-be donors. "Some people can
only give money to Stanford. Others can
only give time. I'm fortunate enough to be
able to give both," he said.
This alumnus may give both time and
money to Stanford these days, but during
his playing career he gave plenty of thrills
to football fans here.
He came from Long Beach to the Farm in
1965 on a football scholarship. Like many
other Stanford athletes, he passed up offers
from more than 40 other schools, including
perennial football factories like USC be
