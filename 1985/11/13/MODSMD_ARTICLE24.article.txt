# The 						'Ramblin' Wreck' Tops Preseason Poll
## 
### 
ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia
Tech's No. 1 ranking in The As
sociated Press preseason college
basketball poll is a double-edged
sword because "a tremendous
amount of pressure" comes with
the recognition, Yellow.Jackets
Coach Bobby Cremins said yes
terday.
The Ramblin' Wreck of Georgia
Tech got 28 first-place votes and
1,192 points from the nationwide
panel of 63 sports writers and
broadcasters to edge North
Carolina for the top spot. Georgia
Tech beat the Tar Heels 57-54 in
the Atlantic Coast Conference
tournament championship game
last season.
"To be honest, right now I
don't know if we can live up to it.
It puts a tremendous amount of
pressure on us. My expectations
are usually very high, but they
can't go highfer than the ones that
have been put upon us," Cremins
said.
"I just hope we can deal with
it"
Georgia Tech and North
Carolina were among five ACC
teams placed in the Top Twenty.
In third place was Michigan, one
of two Big Ten teams in the Top
Ten.
The Tar Heels got 13 first
place votes and 1,148 points. Mi
chigan had 13 first-place votes

and 1,141 points.
The No. 4 team was Syracuse,
one of two Big East teams in the
Top Ten, with 936 points. No. 5
was Kansas, with four first-place
votes and 921 points.
The ACC's Duke got two first
place votes and 911 points for the
sixth-place ranking, and Illinois of
the Big Ten got one first-place
vote and 847 points for seventh
place.

Georgetown of the Big East,
last year's national runner-up, got
one first-place vote and 824
points for eighth; No. 9 Louisville
of the Metro Conference had 687

and Auburn of the Southeastern
Conference rounded out the Top
Ten with 670.
Last year's national champion,
Villanova, was not ranked, nor
was St. John's, a fellow Big East
school and Final Four participant.
Both teams lost several key
players to graduation, among
them the Redmen's Chris Mullin
and the Wildcats' "E.Z." Ed
Pinckney.
Georgetown has been in the
NCAA championship game three
of the last four years, but now
faces life without star center
Patrick Ewing. The Hoyas were
the top team in last year's
preseason poll and held that spot
for all but five weeks of the
season.
The SEC is the only other con
ference to have more than two
teams in the Top Twenty, with
Kentucky ranked 11th and
Louisiana State 14th. Kentucky,
which lost the venerable Joe
Beesman Hall to retirement, will
begin the season with a new
coach, Eddie Sutton, who left
Arkansas to take the Kentucky
job.
Notre Dame, the only indepen
dent in the Top Twenty, was one
of seven teams to receive first
place votes. The Irish finished
12th and received one vote for
the top spot.
