# Walsh Denies Rumors

### 
REDWOOD CITY (AP) — Coach
Bill Walsh acknowledged yesterday
that rumors linking Joe Montana to
drug use have reached the San
Francisco 49ers' front office, and he
said club officials consider the
rumors "absurd, ridiculous, factless
strings of gossip."
Montana, the quarterback named
Most Valuable Player in the team's
Super Bowl victory last January,
has given the team urine samples,
when asked, and none showed any
thing to indicate drug usage, the
coach added.
Walsh was asked at his weekly
news conference if he was aware of
rumors involving a star player on
the National Football League team.
He responded, "We're aware of
most of the rumors that are surfac
ing and have been spread around
the community and even around the
country.

generally, we look into rumors
that have been repeated."
He added, "I think probably the
person who has had the most said
about them is Joe Montana. There
have been many, many stories that
have been circulated about Joe
Montana and the use of drugs to the
point where they have pinpointed
where this occurred, when it oc
curred, who he was with, and the
atmosphere in which it occurred.
"We've had at least five stories
on him being pulled over on the
road by police, all of the way from
the East Coast to the West Coast,
and that politicians have saved him,
that I've saved him."
Walsh concluded, "I can categori
cally say that none of these in
stances ever occurred ... He
categorically denies the use of
drugs. He has, in the past,
whenever we've asked, taken a
drug urine sample for us, never

showing any drugs."
Walsh refused to say how many
times Montana had been asked for
urine samples.
"These are absurd, ridiculous,
factless strings of gossip about a
player and it has affected Joe,"
Walsh said. "He and his wife prefer
not to go out to the city (San Fran
cisco), or anything now because of
this circulation of trash."
Walsh's defending Super Bowl
champions fell to 5-5 this season
with the 17-16 loss in Denver on
Monday night, where a snowball
tossed by a fan helped mess up a
49ers' field goal attempt during the
game.
Walsh suggested yesterday that
there should be a rule calling for
replaying plays after such incidents.
"It was a very important play,
and (the officials) saying their hands
are tied, it's just about inviting the
riotous action of fans," Walsh said.
