# Uncertain Market for Players
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) —Major league baseball's largest
group of free agents had the opportunity to negotiate
with any team starting yesterday amid indications that
club owners will hold the line on big salaries and long
term contracts.
A total of 63 players filed for free agency, the big
gest number since the process began in 1976.
As part of a new labor contract reached in August,
this marks the first year that players do not have to go
through a re-entry draft, which limited each free
agent's dealings to 13 teams.
Such teams as the Kansas City Royals, Texas Rang
ers, Cleveland Indians, Philadelphia Phillies, Los An

geles Lkxjgeis, Montreal Expos, Chicago Cubs, Hous
ton Astros and even the New York Yankees, to a
smaller degree, have claimed they presently have no
plans to enter the free agent market.
The last 11 players to file — players who filed Mon
day before the midnight deadline — included Hal
Mcßae, veteran designated hitter for the world cham
pion Royals, and infielder Bobby Grich of California.
The others were infielders Dickie Thon of Houston,
Tony Perez of Cincinnati, Ivan Dejesus of St. Louis,
Indians outfielder Benny Ayala and pitchers Bruce
Kison of Boston, Bart Johnson of
the White Sox, Marty Bystrom of
the Yankees, Mike Norris and
Tommy John of Oakland.
The biggest prize is slugging out
fielder Kirk Gibson, who made
$685,000 last season and opted for
free agency when the Tigers of
fered him a three-year deal.
Don Fehr, acting executive
director of the Major League
Players Association, said he is wary

about the owners adopting a tough
er policy on free agents.
"There's a new (free agent) sys
tem in effect now, and it's too early
to tell if the owners are attempting
to destroy it,"he said.
George Steinbrenner, the
Yankees owner, said, "This isn't
collusion or anything remotely like
that. It's just a matter of everybody
getting disgusted with the way
they've been conducting business,
and I'm as guilty as anyone."
Tixty-six players, the largest
group before this year, filed for free
agency in 1984.
