# Poloists Win 4-1
## 
### 
In its first away match of the
season, the Stanford men's horse
polo team man-handled the five
time defending national champion
Davis Mustangs in Davis on Satur
day.
The 4-1 victory, the Cardinal's
second against Davis, upped the
team's season mark to 2-0.
Stanford, paced by a pair of
goals by senior Jack Fox, stormed to
an early first-quarter lead against
the Mustangs. The period ended
with the Cardinal on top 2-0.
Sophomore Igor Aguirre's
second-quarter goal increased
Stanford's margin to 3-0.
The Davis offense, dormant
throughout the first two periods, or
chukkers, began to click in the
third. Solid defensive play from Ar
turo Farias and Feisal Khan,
however, limited the Mustangs to
just one goal.
