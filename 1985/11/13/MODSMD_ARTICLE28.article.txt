Doe Battles Revolt in Liberia
NAIROBI, Kenya — A former military commander attempted
yesterday to topple the government of Liberian President Samuel
Doe, but army troops loyal to the president recaptured several key
radio stations, and Doe said he had crushed the attempted coup is
hours after it began.
The attack on Doe's government was led by Gen. Thomas
Quiwonkpa, 30, one of 17 low-ranking soldiers who helped Doe
overthrow a civilian government in Liberia in 1980.
Quiwonkpa claimed in a statement read on a radio station in Mon
rovia, the capital, that Doe, 33, was "in hiding." However, later
reports from the official Liberian news agency said that Doe had
issued his own statement from the country's executive mansion,
contending that the rebel forces had failed in their coup attempt and
that he remained in charge.
He called on the army, the police and "all Liberians" to stand
firmly behind him, saying, "Do not permit these rebels, these dissi
dent forces to intimidate you or influence you." He also urged rebel
holdouts to lay down their arms "because we are in complete control
of the situation."
At least 16 persons, among them 15 rebels, were killed in the
fierce battles, Doe said.
It was not known late yesterday whether the fighting had ended.
In Washington, a State Department spokesman said, "It is not clear
what forces are in control."
Bombing Kills Four in Lebanon
BEIRUT, Lebanon — A suicide driver blew up a truck loaded with
explosives yesterday at a former monastery where six Lebanese
Christian leaders were meeting to discuss their opposition to a
Syrian-sponsored political-reform plan for Lebanon. Four people
were killed and 26 injured, including several of the Christian leaders.
The explosion, at Aukar, a Christian suburb of East Beirut,
demolished a wing of a former monastery and broke windows 300
yards away at the U.S. Embassy annex, the site of a suicide car
bombing in September 1984. No injuries were reported there yes
terday.
In addition to the unidentified driver of the truck carrying the ex
plosives, two Lebanese army guards and a woman who was outside
the building were killed. Authorities said the thick walls of the build
ing prevented serious injury to the Christian leaders meeting inside.
Those hurt included former President Camille Chamoun, 85, who
emerged with minor cuts and bruises.
Callers claimed responsibility for the bombing on behalf of two
previously unknown groups, but authorities said it was impossible to
verify the claims.
Polish Shakeup Nixes Hardliner
WARSAW, Poland — Poland completed a major realignment of
government and Communist Party posts yesterday that removed a
leading hard-line figure, Foreign Minister Stefan Olszowski, from the
political scene.
At the same time, two liberal allies of the top Polish leader, Woj
ciech Jaruzelski, emerged with greatly reduced influence, while two
Moscow-oriented hard-liners gained in prominence.
Diplomatic observers said these changes appeared to mark the
opening moves of a struggle for dominance between Jaruzelski, the
Communist Party's first secretary, and orthodox Marxist hard-liners
leading up to next year's party congress, which will set the nation's
political and economic course for the next five years.
Olszowski, 54, stepped down Monday from the Politburo, saying
he wanted to devote time to writing and research, according to the
Polish news agency PAP. Western diplomats said it was more likely
that Olszowski had been forced out of the leadership, as he was for
six months in 1980, and that he could conceivably engineer another
recovery.
He was long considered a likely candidate to replace Jaruzelski as
party leader. There have been indications that the Soviets felt more
comfortable with his hard-line views than with Jaruzelski's more
liberal economic policies and his relatively restrained efforts to curb
Poland's defiantly outspoken opposition and the powerful Roman
Catholic Church.
Verdict Reached in Aquino Case
MANILA, Philippines — The special court trying 26 men accused
in the 1983 assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr. has
reached a verdict, Justice Augusto Amores said yesterday.
Amores did not disclose the verdict but said it was unanimous and
the decision is 100 pages long. The defendants, including Gen.
Fabian Ver, armed forces chief of staff, were ordered to appear
before the court Nov. 20, when the decision will be announced.
The verdict will be potentially explosive in the political climate
here, heightened by President Ferdinand Marcos' call for early presi
dential elections.
The president has pledged to reinstate Ver, on voluntary leave
since he was charged as an accomplice in the assassination, if he is
acquitted.
Announcement of the verdict was delayed to allow the Supreme
Court to consider a petition, filed Monday, accusing the three
justices and the prosecutor of "serious irregularities in the proceed
ings and . . . manifest bias" in favor of the accused. The petition
seeks declaration of a mistrial and a new trial before another court.
It was signed by 31 Filipinos, including prominent businessmen,
human right leaders and former Justice Cecilia Munoz-Palma, head of
the opposition's National Unification Committee.
The Supreme Court could declare the mistrial, reject the petition
or temporarily restrain the trial judges from issuing their verdict
while it considers the matter.
Sailor Will Be Issue at Summit
WASHINGTON — During his summit meeting with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, President Reagan will seek assurances that a So
viet sailor returned to his ship in New Orleans will not be harmed
when he gets back to the Soviet Union, the president told congres
sional leaders yesterday.
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) who led the fight to try to getMiroslav
Medvid off the ship, meantime charged that the Reagan Administra
tion had handled the case callously without regard for either Medvid
or the wishes of Congress.
Helms, at a hearing of the Senate Agriculture Committee which he
chairs, suggested that the Administration had cut a secret deal with
the Soviets to keep Medvid from obtaining political asylum here on
the eve of the Geneva summit meeting.

Olszowski, 54, stepped down Monday from the Politburo, saying
he wanted to devote time to writing and research, according to the
Polish news agency PAP. Western diplomats said it was more likely
that Olszowski had been forced out of the leadership, as he was for
six months in 1980, and that he could conceivably engineer another
recovery.
He was long considered a likely candidate to replace Jaruzelski as
party leader. There have been indications that the Soviets felt more
comfortable with his hard-line views than with Jaruzelski's more
liberal economic policies and his relatively restrained efforts to curb
Poland's defiantly outspoken opposition and the powerful Roman
Catholic Church.
Verdict Reached in Aquino Case
MANILA, Philippines — The special court trying 26 men accused
in the 1983 assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr. has
reached a verdict, Justice Augusto Amores said yesterday.
Amores did not disclose the verdict but said it was unanimous and
the decision is 100 pages long. The defendants, including Gen.
Fabian Ver, armed forces chief of staff, were ordered to appear
before the court Nov. 20, when the decision will be announced.
The verdict will be potentially explosive in the political climate
here, heightened by President Ferdinand Marcos' call for early presi
dential elections.
The president has pledged to reinstate Ver, on voluntary leave
since he was charged as an accomplice in the assassination, if he is
acquitted.
Announcement of the verdict was delayed to allow the Supreme
Court to consider a petition, filed Monday, accusing the three
justices and the prosecutor of "serious irregularities in the proceed
ings and . . . manifest bias" in favor of the accused. The petition
seeks declaration of a mistrial and a new trial before another court.
It was signed by 31 Filipinos, including prominent businessmen,
human right leaders and former Justice Cecilia Munoz-Palma, head of
the opposition's National Unification Committee.
The Supreme Court could declare the mistrial, reject the petition
or temporarily restrain the trial judges from issuing their verdict
while it considers the matter.
Sailor Will Be Issue at Summit
WASHINGTON — During his summit meeting with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, President Reagan will seek assurances that a So
viet sailor returned to his ship in New Orleans will not be harmed
when he gets back to the Soviet Union, the president told congres
sional leaders yesterday.
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) who led the fight to try to getMiroslav
Medvid off the ship, meantime charged that the Reagan Administra
tion had handled the case callously without regard for either Medvid
or the wishes of Congress.
Helms, at a hearing of the Senate Agriculture Committee which he
chairs, suggested that the Administration had cut a secret deal with
the Soviets to keep Medvid from obtaining political asylum here on
the eve of the Geneva summit meeting.
Doe Battles Revolt in Liberia
NAIROBI, Kenya — A former military commander attempted
yesterday to topple the government of Liberian President Samuel
Doe, but army troops loyal to the president recaptured several key
radio stations, and Doe said he had crushed the attempted coup is
hours after it began.
The attack on Doe's government was led by Gen. Thomas
Quiwonkpa, 30, one of 17 low-ranking soldiers who helped Doe
overthrow a civilian government in Liberia in 1980.
Quiwonkpa claimed in a statement read on a radio station in Mon
rovia, the capital, that Doe, 33, was "in hiding." However, later
reports from the official Liberian news agency said that Doe had
issued his own statement from the country's executive mansion,
contending that the rebel forces had failed in their coup attempt and
that he remained in charge.
He called on the army, the police and "all Liberians" to stand
firmly behind him, saying, "Do not permit these rebels, these dissi
dent forces to intimidate you or influence you." He also urged rebel
holdouts to lay down their arms "because we are in complete control
of the situation."
At least 16 persons, among them 15 rebels, were killed in the
fierce battles, Doe said.
It was not known late yesterday whether the fighting had ended.
In Washington, a State Department spokesman said, "It is not clear
what forces are in control."
Bombing Kills Four in Lebanon
BEIRUT, Lebanon — A suicide driver blew up a truck loaded with
explosives yesterday at a former monastery where six Lebanese
Christian leaders were meeting to discuss their opposition to a
Syrian-sponsored political-reform plan for Lebanon. Four people
were killed and 26 injured, including several of the Christian leaders.
The explosion, at Aukar, a Christian suburb of East Beirut,
demolished a wing of a former monastery and broke windows 300
yards away at the U.S. Embassy annex, the site of a suicide car
bombing in September 1984. No injuries were reported there yes
terday.
In addition to the unidentified driver of the truck carrying the ex
plosives, two Lebanese army guards and a woman who was outside
the building were killed. Authorities said the thick walls of the build
ing prevented serious injury to the Christian leaders meeting inside.
Those hurt included former President Camille Chamoun, 85, who
emerged with minor cuts and bruises.
Callers claimed responsibility for the bombing on behalf of two
previously unknown groups, but authorities said it was impossible to
verify the claims.
Polish Shakeup Nixes Hardliner
WARSAW, Poland — Poland completed a major realignment of
government and Communist Party posts yesterday that removed a
leading hard-line figure, Foreign Minister Stefan Olszowski, from the
political scene.
At the same time, two liberal allies of the top Polish leader, Woj
ciech Jaruzelski, emerged with greatly reduced influence, while two
Moscow-oriented hard-liners gained in prominence.
Diplomatic observers said these changes appeared to mark the
opening moves of a struggle for dominance between Jaruzelski, the
Communist Party's first secretary, and orthodox Marxist hard-liners
leading up to next year's party congress, which will set the nation's
political and economic course for the next five years.
Olszowski, 54, stepped down Monday from the Politburo, saying
