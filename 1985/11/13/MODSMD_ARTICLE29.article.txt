## Reagan Sees Many Areas for Agreement 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, in one
of his most optimistic statements about the out
look for next week's summit with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, said yesterday there are
"many areas for agreement" between the United
States and the Soviet Union.
Although he was not specific about any agree
ments the summit might produce, the president
suggested progress could be made toward the
establishment of a nuclear-free zone in Europe.
At the same time, he said, the issue of negotia
tions to eliminate medium-range missiles in
Europe "is definitely one of the topics we will
take up at the summit."
Among the major U.S. goals at the Nov. 19-20
meeting are the elimination of suspicion and dis
trust between the two superpowers as well as
the signaling of progress to arms control
negotiators in Geneva, Reagan declared in a pre
summit interview with five foreign broadcasters.
He also said he would like arms negotiators to
consider the question of medium-range missiles
separately from strategic weapons or intercon
tinental ballistic missiles. A similar suggestion

was made by Gorbachev during a recent visit to
Paris, but the Soviets never have officially sub
mitted the proposal.
Reagan was asked if he could envision an un
derstanding with Gorbachev on medium-range
nuclear weapons, and if he thought the two sides
were closer to an agreement on that than on in
tercontinental ballistic missiles.
"Well, I know that the Soviets have talked
about such things as a nuclear-free zone in
Europe," he replied. "And we're willing to
engage them, and will, in conversation on that
kind of a subject."
Meanwhile, Reagan's arms control adviser,
Paul Nitze, also guardedly optimistic, predicted
in a separate interview yesterday that Reagan
and Gorbachev will reach agreement on some
bilateral matters, and perhaps even agree on a
statement on the difficult issue of arms control.
Although he expects no dramatic
breakthrough, Nitze has continued to sound
much more hopeful than other senior U.S. offi
cials that substantial progress will be made in
resolving U.S.-Soviet differences.
Nitze said he still held out hope that the sum-

Mit would produce a statement of guidelines on
the Geneva arms talks that would at least move
the negotiations forward. But other senior Ad
ministration officials have said the Soviets' insis
tence on a ban on so-called "Star Wars" research
makes agreement on such a statement unlikely.
Nitze, whose interview with foreign jour
nalists was beamed to Europe through U.S. In
formation Agency facilities, said that at the sum
mit it may be possible to make progress on ap
proaches the superpowers will take toward mul
tilateral arms control issues, such as United Na
tions negotiations in Geneva on chemical
warfare.
He said he expects the two sides to reach
agreements on several longstanding bilateral is
sues, including perhaps air safety in the Pacific,
resuming commercial air flights between the
United States and the Soviet Union and an ex
change of consulates.
With Reagan scheduled to leave for Geneva
Saturday, most of his activities this week are
revolving around preparations for his first
encounter with a Soviet counterpart.
