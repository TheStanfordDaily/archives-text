# Burglaries Decrease After Suspect Arrest

Although $800 to $1,000 worth
of merchandise has been reported
stolen from student residences
since the Oct. 23 arrest of John
Suppes, officers from the Stanford
Police Department say the fre
quency of burglaries has decreased.
Stanford Pohce'TJetective IVlike
Seamons said 11 burglaries account
for that sum. He added that police
believe a single suspect was re
sponsible for at least two of the
cases.
Roble Hall has been victimized
most frequently of late, chalking up
five entries on the police depart
ment's burglary log. Two other
thefts were reported at Wilbur Hall,

and one each at Hurlburt House,
Theta Delta Chi, Lagunita Court
and 373 Campus Drive.
In addition, Seamons said four
more burglary charges will be filed
against Suppes later this week. The
charges are related to thefts com
mitted since August at Lambda Nu,
Phi Sig House, Theta Chi and Build
ing 520. Suppes, arrested Oct. 23
in connection with a theft at
Columbae House, goes on trial for
first-degree burglary and resisting
arrest on Nov. 22.
Campus thieves appear to be
looking for small items that can
be carried out easily and then sold
quickly on the street for cash. Stan
ford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said the most frequently stolen
items include small televisions,
watches, stereos, money, jewelry

and "Walkman" portable stereos.
Niemeyer said the primary
suspect in several burglaries is a
black male in his late 20s. The
suspect drives a brown Volkswagen
Dasher made in the early 70s,
Niemeyer said.
According to Niemeyer, the
suspect typically walks down a hall,
trying doors to find one that is un
locked. If noticed, he pretends to
be leaving a message on a door.
When he finds an open door, he
walks in, takes what valuables he
can and leaves quickly. If caught
inside a room, he says he is looking
for one of the people who lives
there, citing one of the names listed
on the door, and says he will leave a
note.
Most residential burglaries are
occurring around meal times, ac

cording to Niemeyer. Six of the 11
recent thefts occurred around noon
or 6 p.m. People walk down the hall
to eat or shower and leave their
doors unlocked, Niemeyer said,
and"it only takes about 10 seconds
to walk in and grab a wallet."
If students see an unfamiliar or
suspicious-looking person in their
dorms, Niemeyer said they should
dial 911 immediately. "Better safe
than sorry," he said.
He added, "It would really be
helpful if (victims) reported these
things immediately." For instance,
if one waits a full week, it's a "total
impossibility that you would get fin
gerprints out of (the scene of the
crime)."
Students should also be obser
