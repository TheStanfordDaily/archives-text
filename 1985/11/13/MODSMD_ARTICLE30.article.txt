# Navy Spy Sentenced to Life
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Retired Navy
officer Arthur Walker was sen
tenced yesterday to life in prison
plus 10 years and fined $250,000
for spying for the Soviet Union — a
stiffer punishment than that the
government agreed to for his
brother, John, the ringleader who
enlisted Arthur as a spy.
Actually, government sources
here said after federal court
proceedings in Norfolk, Va., the
sentences would work out about
the same: Both brothers will go to
jail penniless and for life, making
them technically eligible for parole
in 10 years.

Based on current Parole Com
mission guidelines, however, their
chances of being freed that soon ap
pear slim because espionage is a
"category eight" offense, placing it
among the most severe.
Despite a plea by Walker's wife,
Rita, that he was a man who could
not say no and who grew suicidal
over his espionage, U.S. District
Judge Calvitt Clarke imposed life
sentences on each of three counts
and 10 years on three others, but
said they were to run concurrently.
"I can't treat this as a slap-on
the-wrist case," said Clarke, who
found Walker guilty Aug. 9 in a non

jury trial after deliberating only 16
minutes. "The evidence is all to the
contrary."
Walker, 51, who was convicted of
funneling Navy secrets from his
defense contractor employer, VSE
Corp., to his brother for relay to
the Soviets, apologized yesterday.
"I'd like to take this opportunity
to apologize to all the citizens of this
country for what I did," he said.
"No one could be an sorrier. ... I
dishonored myself."
Rita Walker, saying her husband
"wouldn't hurt anybody," told how
he suffered nightmares and in
creased his drinking and smoking

while he was spying. One night, she
recalled, he searched their home
for a shotgun to "blow his brains
out."
But Walker's prosecutor, Assis
tant U.S. Attorney Tommy Miller,
said the government did not believe
that Walker had revealed his full
role in the ring. "His version is not
corroborated by other witnesses,"
Miller said.
Walker's attorney, Samuel
Meekins, contended his client's role
in the espionage ring was minor.
"There really is no evidence that he
intended to injure the United
States," Meekins said.
