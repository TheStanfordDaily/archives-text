Deficit Issue on Hold
WASHINGTON — The Democratic
controlled House moved yesterday to sweep
the government's pressing debt and spending
crises under the rug until after next week's
summit, but it was unclear whether the White
House and the Republican-run Senate would
go along.
Citing a wish not to burden President
Reagan with domestic money problems on the
eve of his meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, the House Ways and Means Com
mittee approved on a voice vote a bipartisan
measure that would extend the government's
borrowing power to Dec. 13.
At the same time, the full House, which is
likely to take up the debt measure today,
voted 259-151 to renew spending authority
through Dec. 12 for virtually all government
agencies, which are dependent on appropria
tions bills still working their way through
Congress. And the Ways and Means Commit
tee also approved on a voice vote an extension
of the lucrative 16-cent-a-pack cigarette tax
through Dec. 14.
The actions painted a clear picture of law
makers seizing on the summit as a way of
avoiding the increasingly unpleasant prospect
of dealing with balanced-budget legislation that
had been tying up the money measures.
"The president isn't in any position to refuse
this," said House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.) after the action on the
debt ceiling. "We don't want to be a
defaulting nation when he goes to Geneva.
We're leaning backwards to help him."
Such an extension, if passed into law, would
avert a cash crunch expected Friday, when the

Treasury Department has predicted federal
accounts will run dry and government checks
will start bouncing.
It would allow the government, which hit
the current debt ceiling of $1.8 trillion last
month, to borrow an additional $80 billion. Ul
timately, the Administration hopes to raise the
debt ceiling to fund government operations for
the rest of the fiscal year to more than $2 tril
lion.
Court Reviews Cable
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court,
responding to an appeal from the City of Los
Angeles that could affect television viewing
nationwide, agreed yesterday to decide
whether a community may grant exclusive
franchises to cable TV companies to operate
within its borders.
The justices will review a federal appeals
court decision that extended constitutional
protection to cable operators for the first time,
saying that the exclusive franchises granted by
Los Angeles and other cities would violate the
First Amendment when there was capacity for
additional systems.
Government has long held wide authority to
regulate television and radio stations, in con
trast to print media, because of the scarcity of
broadcast channels. But the appellate court
refused to accept the contention that cities
could exercise the same sweeping control over
cable systems.
It said that the utility poles that carry cable
TV lines are "a type of public forum," and that
limiting access to only one cable company
would be akin to limiting street-corner news
paper vending machines to one publisher.

The justices' ruling, expected by next
spring, could have broad impact: Currently, 38
million cable-TV subscribers are served
through 6,900 municipally regulated cable sys
tems, most of them the only system in their
area.
The Supreme Court, entering a sex
discrimination dispute between a fundamen
talist Christian school and an expectant
teacher it dismissed so she could stay home
with her baby, also agreed yesterday to con
sider whether states can enforce job-bias laws
against church-affiliated educational institu
tions.
The justices will review an action by Ohio
authorities against a Dayton school that had
refused to employ the teacher because church
doctrine called for mothers to be in the home
with young children.
A federal appeals court ruled last June that
such intervention by a state agency em
powered to conduct sweeping investigations
and to order reinstatement and back pay would
infringe on the school's religious freedom.
Prices Swing Widely
NEW YORK — Stock prices swung widely
yesterday and the Dow Jones industrial
average ended with a modest gain in the
busiest trading session since January.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which crossed over the 1,400 threshold for the
first time last week and set a record Monday,
finished up 1.72 at a new closing high of
1,433.60. It marked the seventh time in the
past 10 sessions that the blue-chip index has
closed at a new peak.

Court Reviews Cable
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court,
responding to an appeal from the City of Los
Angeles that could affect television viewing
nationwide, agreed yesterday to decide
whether a community may grant exclusive
franchises to cable TV companies to operate
within its borders.
The justices will review a federal appeals
court decision that extended constitutional
protection to cable operators for the first time,
saying that the exclusive franchises granted by
Los Angeles and other cities would violate the
First Amendment when there was capacity for
additional systems.
Government has long held wide authority to
regulate television and radio stations, in con
trast to print media, because of the scarcity of
broadcast channels. But the appellate court
refused to accept the contention that cities
could exercise the same sweeping control over
cable systems.
It said that the utility poles that carry cable
TV lines are "a type of public forum," and that
limiting access to only one cable company
would be akin to limiting street-corner news
paper vending machines to one publisher.

The justices' ruling, expected by next
spring, could have broad impact: Currently, 38
million cable-TV subscribers are served
through 6,900 municipally regulated cable sys
tems, most of them the only system in their
area.
The Supreme Court, entering a sex
discrimination dispute between a fundamen
talist Christian school and an expectant
teacher it dismissed so she could stay home
with her baby, also agreed yesterday to con
sider whether states can enforce job-bias laws
against church-affiliated educational institu
tions.
The justices will review an action by Ohio
authorities against a Dayton school that had
refused to employ the teacher because church
doctrine called for mothers to be in the home
with young children.
A federal appeals court ruled last June that
such intervention by a state agency em
powered to conduct sweeping investigations
and to order reinstatement and back pay would
infringe on the school's religious freedom.
Prices Swing Widely
NEW YORK — Stock prices swung widely
yesterday and the Dow Jones industrial
average ended with a modest gain in the
busiest trading session since January.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which crossed over the 1,400 threshold for the
first time last week and set a record Monday,
finished up 1.72 at a new closing high of
1,433.60. It marked the seventh time in the
past 10 sessions that the blue-chip index has
closed at a new peak.
