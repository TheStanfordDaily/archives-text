Animal Rights Protest
BERKELEY — Animal rights activists
chained themselves to bulldozers at UC-
Berkeley yesterday to stop the construction of
a new laboratory they decried as a "death
camp" for animals.
There were five arrests, and organizers say
the protest was "only the beginning" of a
militant campaign to stop the project and end
the pain and suffering inflicted upon animals.
Activists accuse the nine-campus university
system of conducting cruel and unneccessary
experiments on animals. They contend much
of the research can be performed on cells and
computer models.

Alleged Lover Sues
LOS ANGELES — A man who says he was
Rock Hudson's lover in the last years of the ac
tor's life sued his estate and others for $14 mil
lion yesterday, claiming Hudson repeatedly
had sex with him while concealing the fact he
had AIDS.
"He asked Rock, and Rock denied he had
it," attorney Marvin Mitchelson told a news
conference as 31-year-old plaintiff Marc Chris
tian sat by silently.
Mitchelson said that although recent tests
indicated no presence of AIDS antibodies in
Christian, it was probable that Hudson infected
him with the disease, which he said could

surface later. He said Christian last had sex
with the star in February 1985.
However, Shirley. Fannin, head of the
county health department's communicable
disease section, yesterday said the infection
would have to show up within six months,
which in this case passed in August.
"If a person had sex with someone six
months ago and doesn't have antibodies, then I
think one can assume he didn't get infected.
Mitchelson said he doubted the accuracy of
Fannin's analysis.
"Many people don't agree with that at all,"
he said. "I'm not a scientist, but I don't believe
that (the six-month limit on detection of an
tibodies) is the case."
