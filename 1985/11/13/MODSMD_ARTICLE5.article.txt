# Panel Discusses Drinking Policy
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
"There is no hidden agenda"
to make Stanford an alcohol-free
campus, Norm Robinson, associ
ate dean of Student Affairs, told
a crowd of approximately 40
people last night at Toyon Hall.
Robinson was joined in the
panel discussion on alcohol con
sumption at Stanford by Diana
Conklin, assistant dean of Stu
dent Affairs and director of the
Row, Toyon resident assistant
Steve Kaplan and psychiatrist
Tom Engelsing. The talk was or
ganized by Toyon RAs.
Robinson said the use of the
Fundamental Standard against a
student arrested on campus this
spring for driving under the influ
ence of alcohol, in addition to a
request by Residential Education
that RAs break up drinking
games, has lead some students
to feel there is a move to make
Stanford a dry campus.
"It simply isn't the case,"
Robinson said.
Conklin concurred, stating,
"There's not a master plan to
make this campus dry. I think
that there is a master plan to
make this campus aware" of the
dangers of alcohol abuse.
The case involving the Funda

mental Standard pertained to
student Joseph Anderson, who
allegedly drove his car, while in
toxicated, on the sidewalk in
front of Florence Moore, running
into and damaging at least one
bicycle.
The one-quarter, stayed
suspension given to Anderson
"did signal a change" in the Uni
versity's policy toward drunk
driving on campus, Robinson
said.
He pointed out, however, that
it is "awfully hard to draw any
vast generalizations" about what
will happen to students found
guilty of driving drunk on
campus. "One has to look at the
specific circumstances in any
given case," Robinson said.
"Here (the Anderson case) we
had someone who left the scene
after doing some damage," Rob
inson said.
"The closer one gets to the
physical core of campus, where
there are a lot more buildings
and where there are a lot of
people. ... I think the chances
are greater" of being punished
under the Fundamental Stan
dard, Robinson said.
Calling Stanford's alcohol
policy "a lot more progressive"
than that of other universities,
