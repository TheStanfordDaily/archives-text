# What's That Ringing in Your Ears?

### C.R. DOUGLAS 
You've probably seen Hoover
Tower, but when was the last time
you thought about hearing it?
Some have asked whether or not
Stanford keeps a creature in the
tower to swing by ropes and wildly
ring bells, similar to the legendary
hunchback of the Notre Dame ca
thedral in Paris.
Electrical Engineering Prof.
James Angell, who plays the carillon
most days, would take exception to
this myth.
Those who have been so bold as
to venture to the top of the tower
know what the carillon looks like. It
is a 35-bell instrument enclosed on
the observation deck. Each bell is
attached to a wire that leads to an
apparatus on the 13th floor of the
tower, directly below the observa
tion level.
Angell says that playing the caril
lon is a cross between playing the
piano and playing the organ, since
the bells are activated by a
keyboard and foot pedals. It is also
possible for the carillon to play au
tomatically since each bell is also at

tached by wire to a spinning drum
similar to that in a music box.
Angell became interested in
music at an early age. As a child he
studied organ privately and had
ambitions about pursuing it as a
career.
Bells Are Ringing
Angell has played the tower's
carillon since he arrived at Stanford
in 1960. During that period he has
tried to keep to a schedule of
sounding the bells twice every
weekday, at noon and 5 p.m.
Angell also takes special re
quests. For instance he played for a
half hour before the Centennial
Convocation at Memorial Church
Monday afternoon.
Angell doesn't do all this alone,
though. Graduate students Tim
Zerlang in the Department of Music
and Ginny Barton in the Depart
ment of Electrical Engineering have
integrated themselves into Angell's
carillon program.
On Halloween, these two took it
upon themselves to haunt the Stan

ford air space with such carillon
renditions as the theme to
"Twilight Zone."
The bells have a long history of
incidents like this one, as Angell
pointed out.
They were built in Belgium in
1938 and brought to New York for
the World's Fair of 1939-40. Each
bell is engraved with the words, "In
the Name of King Leopold, I Ring
for Peace," and while at the fair,
they were housed in the Belgium
Tower.
Ironically, Angell remembers
visiting the fair as a small child. "I
remember where the Belgium
Tower was, but I did not know
there were bells in it,"he said.
Once the fair came to a close, the
bells were acquired by the Belgian-
American Educational Foundation.
A few years later, this foundation
gave the bells to Stanford in ap
preciation of the work Herbert
Hoover did in helping rehabilitate
the lowlands of Europe, including
Belgium.
Coincidentally, Hoover Tower,

which was just being built, was
deemed a great place for the bells
not only because of the Hoover
connection, but also because of its
ideal location and height.
Bell Beginners
According to Angell, Stanford
was the first university in California
to procure a carillon of its size.
Since then, the University of Cal
ifornia system has bypassed Stan
ford three times. Campuses at
Berkeley, Santa Barbara and
Riverside have all since acquired
carillons that surpass the size of
Stanford's.
However, according to Angell, all
three UC carilloners had their
starts at Stanford.
Angell has many anecdotes to of
fer after 25 years of musical service
atop Hoover Tower. The one he
most loves to tell has to do with the
Drama Department.
The occasion was a performance
of "Jesus Christ Superstar" in Frost
Amphitheater a number of years
ago.
At various points during the per

formance the audience was given a
special dose of carillon music that
coincided with the play. Angell
proudly hinted that it worked per
fectly.
On a typical day on the tower's
13th floor, Angell may enrich his 5
p.m. performance with songs from
the "Sound of Music," including a
beautiful carillon version of
"Edelweiss."
Although Angell has no plans of
giving up his voluntary post as caril
lon caretaker, he did express some
fears about the future.
"At this time there is no mecha
nism set up to insure that it would
be continued," he said.
Having finished a concert, Angell
wends his way out of his lair by way
of a private elevator provided for
him by the Hoover Institution ad
ministration.
When he finally reaches the sun
light outside, he can look up from
the concrete-sidewalk realm of ordi
nary mortals and students with the
knowledge that the musical voice of
Hoover Tower will ring out over
the campus at least a little while
longer.

The 35 bells of the carillon in Hoover Tower chime out every day at noon and 5 p.m., thanks to the
dedication of Electrical Engineering Prof. James Angell and his two assistants who play selec
tions on the console located on the 13th floor.
You've probably seen Hoover
Tower, but when was the last time
you thought about hearing it?
Some have asked whether or not
Stanford keeps a creature in the
tower to swing by ropes and wildly
ring bells, similar to the legendary
hunchback of the Notre Dame ca
thedral in Paris.
Electrical Engineering Prof.
James Angell, who plays the carillon
most days, would take exception to
this myth.
Those who have been so bold as
to venture to the top of the tower
know what the carillon looks like. It
is a 35-bell instrument enclosed on
the observation deck. Each bell is
attached to a wire that leads to an
apparatus on the 13th floor of the
tower, directly below the observa
tion level.
Angell says that playing the caril
lon is a cross between playing the
piano and playing the organ, since
the bells are activated by a
keyboard and foot pedals. It is also
possible for the carillon to play au
tomatically since each bell is also at

tached by wire to a spinning drum
similar to that in a music box.
Angell became interested in
music at an early age. As a child he
studied organ privately and had
ambitions about pursuing it as a
career.
Bells Are Ringing
Angell has played the tower's
carillon since he arrived at Stanford
in 1960. During that period he has
tried to keep to a schedule of
sounding the bells twice every
weekday, at noon and 5 p.m.
Angell also takes special re
quests. For instance he played for a
half hour before the Centennial
Convocation at Memorial Church
Monday afternoon.
Angell doesn't do all this alone,
though. Graduate students Tim
Zerlang in the Department of Music
and Ginny Barton in the Depart
ment of Electrical Engineering have
integrated themselves into Angell's
carillon program.
On Halloween, these two took it
upon themselves to haunt the Stan

ford air space with such carillon
renditions as the theme to
"Twilight Zone."
The bells have a long history of
incidents like this one, as Angell
pointed out.
They were built in Belgium in
1938 and brought to New York for
the World's Fair of 1939-40. Each
bell is engraved with the words, "In
the Name of King Leopold, I Ring
for Peace," and while at the fair,
they were housed in the Belgium
Tower.
Ironically, Angell remembers
visiting the fair as a small child. "I
remember where the Belgium
Tower was, but I did not know
there were bells in it,"he said.
Once the fair came to a close, the
bells were acquired by the Belgian-
American Educational Foundation.
A few years later, this foundation
gave the bells to Stanford in ap
preciation of the work Herbert
Hoover did in helping rehabilitate
the lowlands of Europe, including
Belgium.
Coincidentally, Hoover Tower,

which was just being built, was
deemed a great place for the bells
not only because of the Hoover
connection, but also because of its
ideal location and height.
Bell Beginners
According to Angell, Stanford
was the first university in California
to procure a carillon of its size.
Since then, the University of Cal
ifornia system has bypassed Stan
ford three times. Campuses at
Berkeley, Santa Barbara and
Riverside have all since acquired
carillons that surpass the size of
Stanford's.
However, according to Angell, all
three UC carilloners had their
starts at Stanford.
Angell has many anecdotes to of
fer after 25 years of musical service
atop Hoover Tower. The one he
most loves to tell has to do with the
Drama Department.
The occasion was a performance
of "Jesus Christ Superstar" in Frost
Amphitheater a number of years
ago.
At various points during the per

formance the audience was given a
special dose of carillon music that
coincided with the play. Angell
proudly hinted that it worked per
fectly.
On a typical day on the tower's
13th floor, Angell may enrich his 5
p.m. performance with songs from
the "Sound of Music," including a
beautiful carillon version of
"Edelweiss."
Although Angell has no plans of
giving up his voluntary post as caril
lon caretaker, he did express some
fears about the future.
"At this time there is no mecha
nism set up to insure that it would
