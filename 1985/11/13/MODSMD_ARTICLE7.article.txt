# What's That Ringing in Your Ears?

You've probably seen Hoover
Tower, but when was the last time
you thought about hearing it?
Some have asked whether or not
Stanford keeps a creature in the
tower to swing by ropes and wildly
ring bells, similar to the legendary
hunchback of the Notre Dame ca
thedral in Paris.
Electrical Engineering Prof.
James Angell, who plays the carillon
most days, would take exception to
this myth.
Those who have been so bold as
to venture to the top of the tower
know what the carillon looks like. It
is a 35-bell instrument enclosed on
the observation deck. Each bell is
attached to a wire that leads to an
apparatus on the 13th floor of the
tower, directly below the observa
tion level.
Angell says that playing the caril
lon is a cross between playing the
piano and playing the organ, since
the bells are activated by a
keyboard and foot pedals. It is also
possible for the carillon to play au
tomatically since each bell is also at

tached by wire to a spinning drum
similar to that in a music box.
Angell became interested in
music at an early age. As a child he
studied organ privately and had
ambitions about pursuing it as a
career.
Bells Are Ringing
Angell has played the tower's
carillon since he arrived at Stanford
in 1960. During that period he has
tried to keep to a schedule of
sounding the bells twice every
weekday, at noon and 5 p.m.
Angell also takes special re
quests. For instance he played for a
half hour before the Centennial
Convocation at Memorial Church
Monday afternoon.
Angell doesn't do all this alone,
though. Graduate students Tim
Zerlang in the Department of Music
and Ginny Barton in the Depart
ment of Electrical Engineering have
integrated themselves into Angell's
carillon program.
On Halloween, these two took it
upon themselves to haunt the Stan

he played the theme from"The Twilight Zone."
