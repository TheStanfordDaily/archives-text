# Beyond War Gains Support
## 
### JOYA WESLEY Senior staff writer 
The total devastation that would result from a nu
clear war has motivated thousands nationwide to join
Beyond War, the area coordinator of the Palo Alto
based organization said here last night.
Diana Lindsay, a Stanford graduate, told an audience
in the Branner Lounge that "Beyond War is actually a
response to the environment we live in today." She
began her presentation with an experiment she said il
lustrated the magnitude of the destruction a nuclear
war could bring about.
Lindsay first dropped a single ball bearing into a
large tin bucket as a representation of all of the damage
done by World War 11. She then dropped three balls as
a representation of the damage that can be done by all
of the weapons on one Poseidon submarine, and eight
balls for the capabilities of the weapons on one Trident
submarine.
Next, she had the audience close its eyes as she
poured a whole jar full of ball bearings into the bucket.
The rumbling this caused lasted for two full minutes.
This demonstration was meant to explain the sense
of urgency felt by members of Beyond War.
"We're actually in a race against time," she said.

The major goal of Beyond War is to change
Americans' mode of thinking, she said.
Lindsay attacked the assumptions that a limited nu
clear war is survivable, that nuclear war will never hap
pen because we have reasonable leaders and that indi
viduals cannot make a difference in breaking the nu
clear deadlock.
She said these assumptions have been proven false
by recent discoveries and considerations, citing nu
clear winter, computer error and the proliferation of
nuclear weapons as examples.
Eventually, Beyond War will seek to improve the at
titudes of heads of state toward war and violence,
Lindsay said.
She said that despite the fact that the United Nations
was created to prevent war, the 40 wars currently
being waged around the world are evidence that armed
conflict is not obsolete.
The change in international thinking that Beyond
War hopes to bring about would end war forever,
Lindsay said.
Beyond War has gained such distinguished adherents
as Carl Sagan and Jonas Salk, according to Lindsay.
The organization has also proliferated nationwide in the
three years it has been in existence, garnering a great
deal of support at Stanford, she said.
