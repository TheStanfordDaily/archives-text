An appeal to the president of the United States and
the general secretary of the Communist Party of the
Soviet Union
Dear Mr. President and Mr. General Secretary:
We address you as physicians and medical scientists who believe with you, that "a nuclear war can never be
won and must never be fought."
On November 19 in Geneva, you will have the opportunity to change the course of human history.
First, you can begin the process of deep cuts in the nuclear arsenals of your two nations.
Second, you can agree to preserve outer space for peaceful purposes.
Third, you can proclaim a mutual moratorium on all nuclear explosions to begin on January 1, 1986, and can
resume negotiations on a permanent treaty to end nuclear explosions forever. ,
The world will long remember the leaders of two great nations who took an historic step back from the
precepice. We urge you to make this summit the landmark event that it can be.
Respectfully,
PSR urges every concerned citizen, off whatever political persuasion, to
write to President Ronald Reagan (The White House, Washington, D.C.)
and to General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev (The Kremlin, Moscow,
U.S.S.R.) and express your views on the Summit negotiations.
