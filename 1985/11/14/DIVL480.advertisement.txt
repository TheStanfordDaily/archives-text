PLANNING TO MOVE OUT
OF YOUR RESIDENCE NEXT QUARTER?
Single students and married couples without children who are currently living in a
University residence and who plan not to return for Winter Quarter must complete a
termination of occupancy card at their local residence office. All students should read
the Residence Agreement regarding financial obligations of the academic year
contract and termination during the year.
Students who fail to notify their residence office of termination of occupancy by
Friday, November 15 lose their $50 housing deposit.
