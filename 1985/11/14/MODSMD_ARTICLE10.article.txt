# Policy Eludes Logic
## 
### LYNN MARCUS Senior staff writer 
There appears to be no logic behind U.S. policy in El
Salvador, a former deputy director of the Salvadoran
agrarian reform institute told an audience of 14 in the
Geology Building last night.
"To me, it's not clear what the U.S. wants to ac
complish," Leonel Gomez said.
Gomez quoted from the texts of several articles pub
lished in U.S. newspapers describing the squandering
and personal abuses of U.S. aid by members of the Sal
vadoran government and military. He emphasized the
passive or sometimes collaborative role played by the
State Department when confronted with these abuses.
"Time and time again, the signal is always the same.
The Salvadoran army will get away with almost any
thing it does vis-a-vis the United States," Gomez said.
Gomez said that, when trying to understand U.S. in
tentions in El Salvador, one needs to focus on the
"signals" the government sends rather than merely
concentrating on U. S. policy.
The signals being sent to Salvadorans through U.S.
statements and actions indicate that U.S. officials
"don't really want to make any changes there," but
would rather keep the rich and the army in power,
using President Jose Napoleon Duarte as a "front,"
Gomez said. Duarte, head of the Christian Democratic
Party, has received U.S. backing as a moderate,
centrist force whom U.S. officials say can promote
democracy in the strife-torn nation.

"The U.S. has [given] $2 billion in military and finan
cial aid to these people, and whatever they're doing
there doesn't seem to be working," Gomez said.
Gomez described the social and political system in El
Salvador as exploitative and inequitable, one in which a
few families and military strong men live in luxury while
3 million peasants live in dire poverty, without basic so
cial and economic benefits. Two million work on large
coffee, cotton and sugar plantations for $200 a year and
are regarded by the wealthy as "basically like animals."
Gomez said U.S. policy makers incorrectly attribute
the problems in El Salvador to communism, accept the
violence in the nation as "a cultural problem," and think
that peasants can be content under the current system
because they have a tradition of not owning anything.
He said peasant support for the 5,000 guerrillas,
many of whom were trained in communist bloc
countries, is widespread not because of ideological
reasons, but because "sometimes it's just the side that
is helping you."
In an interview with The Daily, Gomez described
the frustrations of trying to institute agrarian reform in
a country in which most of those in power oppose any
changes in the system and those in favor of changes
either die or resign due to death threats or frustration.
Gomez became deputy director of the institute in
1980 and survived eight assassination attempts that
year, before being forced to leave the government be
cause the army listed him as an "enemy of the state,"
he said.
