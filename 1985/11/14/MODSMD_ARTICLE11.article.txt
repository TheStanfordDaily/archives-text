When students have steam to let off about some
thing, and they complain and complain without doing
anything about what bothers them, then the steam
rises up into the air and stagnates. All the anger and
bad feelings linger, and nothing is done to get rid of
them.
But when that steam is funneled in one direction,
then anger can generate creative energy. Things
can be accomplished. The steam can start coming
out of where it belongs — out of student-made cups
of coffee in a student-run coffee house.
In other words, the efforts made by those behind
Friday's opening of the Espresso Bar in the Bechtel
International Center must be commended. Indeed,
it was a job well done. After Saga Corp. took over
the Coffee House, it was apparent that some stu
dents were unhappy. Rather than merely boycott
the new Coffee House, they did something about
their dissatisfaction — and the Espresso Bar was

born.
Certainly, there was a need for a "place for stu
dents to hang-out . . . run by students, for stu
dents," as Lee Cline, the Espresso Bar's organizer,
put it. The Espresso Bar meets that need. And the
I-Center location is an added attraction to the new
student coffee house — it lends a homey atmos
phere in which undergrads can interact with the
group of graduate students who typically inhabit the
place.
The supporters, the organizers and the patrons of
the Espresso Bar deserve praise. After a few minor
difficulties are ironed out, such as improving the
taste of the coffee at the Espresso Bar, extending
its hours so that it is open on a daily basis (instead of
just Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights) and
making it more conducive to studying, then the
Espresso Bar will be an almost perfect student
haven.
