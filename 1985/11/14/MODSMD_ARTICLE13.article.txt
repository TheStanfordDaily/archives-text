Bruce Springsteen's smash tour eclipses
♦:hose of Prince and Michael Jackson.
I know a lot of people are getting just a little
bit tired of the media hype of superstar rockers,
and unfortunately the Boss — Bruce
Springsteen — is subject to this overexposure
now. But the question is, what is Springsteen
about? Is he a product of an overzealous media
market, or is there something really powerful
and relevant to his message? (I bet you can
guess which way I am leaning!) Tell you what, I'll
put out my view on the Boss, and if you agree
great! If not, you can write a letter to your
congressman, 'cause I certainly won't
change my mind. I didn't want you to start think
ing that this was going to be an unbiased analysis
of the Boss.
Springsteen's 15-month world tour went to
most of the major metropolitan areas in the
United States, then to Japan, Australia, Western
Europe, and back to more U.S. cities, because
he was having so much fun. It was on the last leg
of this tour that Bruce's popularity skyrocketed
from playing to 13,000 people indoors to 50,000-
plus at football stadiums (which sold out within
four hours for the Oakland concerts). Couple
that with Springsteen's face on Time,
Newsweek, People and a recent issue of Rolling
Stone, and you have a nation suddenly bom
barded with Bruce Springsteen at a level unpar
alleled in his career. The tide of the tour, taken
from his latest album, "Born in the USA," aided
the media in trying to use patriotism again as a
tool to "megahype" the Boss after the full-scale
assault on progressive and sane minds by Rambo
the crazed, idiot boxer earlier this year.
In fact this patriotic-sounding theme was
combined with Springsteen's superior rock 'n'
roll musicianship to promote this concert in a
manner that downplayed the powerful and
harshly realistic lyrics. It is the lyrical value of
Bruce's work that makes his music progressive,
dynamic art and not the slick, commercialized,
mindless trash that seems so popular today. The
words to his pieces and his monologues in con
cert also lay to rest the myths that the conserva
tive right and other ultra-patriotic, military types
perpetrate about the Boss. Myths such as:
Bruce really is happy with the course America is
taking, perpetrated by our dear and esteemed

president; or that the Boss "sold out" with his
latest album, trading politics for popularity.
In reality, his latest songs have more of a poli
tical slant than previous albums, with
Springsteen making strong statements on the
plight of the white American male worker in a
cruel time of unemployment and economic hard
times. Songs about towns that have lost fac
tories, and with them the employment and eco
nomic support the now-dying town needs; songs
about broken dreams, broken hearts and hard
times — all a result of the economy; as well as
"Working on the Highway," whose title speaks
for itself.

Bruce's patriotic message is not for the gov
ernment and the establishment that has created
all the suffering that exists, but for the workers
who make America and are broken by it in
return. His message of good times through rock
'n' roll music, fast cars and bittersweet romances
reflects his attitude that these are temporary
remedies for a problem so deep and serious that
the solutions seem almost unachievable. He
sings of the working class experience in a som
ber yet hopeful way, from the worker's view
point, not the media's or the president's.
To get a clear idea of his message you have to
see him in concert, where he combines parables
about his youth with stark stories of the life of
unemployed oil workers. And in concert the
lyrics leap out at his fans, as his whole being
shows the pain, anger, frustration and occasional
joy that the working American faces daily. For
those of you who didn't see his latest "Festival of
Working America/Hardships Illuminated not
Ignored," let me give a taste of his gritty art.
During his four-hour concert (which is the
rule, not the exception, for rock's truly working
class artist), Bruce introduced a song from his
latest album, soon to be released. The song is

titled "Seeds," and in his introduction
Springsteen told the story of the many un
employed steel workers from Pennsylvania who
head down to Houston in search of work in the
oil fields. He continued to relate what these and
other desperate job seekers are finding out: The
jobs are gone from the oil fields too, and they
ain't coming back. Then the E Street Band plays
the troubling ballad using the melody to add
punch to the message. The result: a glimpse of
the harsh realities of the hard-hit American oil
workers, with the boredom, frustration, anger
and disappointment that follows these Americans
every day. For those of you who think I'm adding
a lot to his songs of struggle, you haven't been
listening to what Bruce sings about the
message is his.
After the first half of the show exposing the
struggling American's plight for what it is, Bruce
launches into the second half of his show where
he offers at least a temporary solution to all the
troubles with a rock 'n' roll party. His classics
"Born to Run," "Cadillac Ranch" and "Out on the
Street," tell of his hell-bent determination to be
in charge of his life, using carthartic rock music
to aid his freedom journey. The crowd was alive
and dancing throughout the second half pf the
show, working off the tensions and traumas of
their lives with some great rock 'n' roll music.
Springsteen's final encore, a medley of the
Beatles' "Twist and Shout," turned into a 30-
minute dance party, which neither Bruce
nor the many worn-out fans wanted to
end. But when it did end, I went home more
alive than when I came. Springsteen's music had
lifted some of the troubles from the shoulders of
those who heard him, and though temporary, the
release was definitely appreciated.
I guess Springsteen really has something that
touches a chord inside of me and the many
others that groove with the Boss. And I know
many, including myself, are getting tired of full
page pictures of the American flag and Bruce's
behind, but when I really get upset at People
magazine, I put on "The River" or "Born to Run"
and listen to what the Boss has to say, and forget
the hype that's confused so many otherwise ar
dent fans.
