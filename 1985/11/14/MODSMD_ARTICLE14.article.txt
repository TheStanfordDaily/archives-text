## Kaplan Report Does Not Address Key Questions 
### 
We, the members of the Black
Student Union, after reading Law
Prof. John Kaplan's report to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
investigating police brutality
charges at an Old Union sit-in on
Oct. 11 and at the North County Jail
later that day, wish to give our view
of some critical issues the report
raises.

VIEWPOINT

These items include the still un
clear, yet important, details of inci
dents at the North County Jail
where Robby Perkins received his
bruises; the University's role in
seeking further investigation to un
cover these occurrences at the jail;
Stanford police officers' attitudes
and conduct, in general, as they
pertain to blacks on campus; and
the appropriateness of the police
using certain types of equipment
while patrolling the campus.
We first commend Kennedy for
calling for an investigation and
Kaplan for agreeing to undertake
the inquiry. This action was a ne
cessary attempt to clarify and un
cover the actual events of Oct. 11.
Although we appreciate his efforts,
there remain key questions that are
unanswered by the Kaplan report
and, indeed, are indeterminable

from the amount of information he
compiled.
The central issues, which Kaplan
states he is unable to resolve, are
how Perkins received his bruises
while in custody at the North
County Jail and whether these
wounds constitute police brutality.
According to Kaplan, "There is no
doubt. . . that Robby Perkins went
to jail with no bruises whatsoever
and emerged with a considerable
number of such and other signs cer
tainly consistent with his having
received an unlawful beating. The
problem is precisely what happened
to him and how he go these marks.
That unfortunately is not clear to
me . . . Since Kaplan could not
determine the particular circum
stances at the jail, Stanford must
look further into the matter as the
incidents at the jail involve both a
Stanford student — Perkins — and
a Stanford deputy — Sgt. Nick
Brunot.
Brunot, according to Kaplan's
report, was an observer of a strip
search on Perkins conducted by
Sgt. Arthur Kirts, a Santa Clara
County sheriffs deputy. Brunot
filed a report stating that no un
necessary force was used on
Perkins in the search. Kaplan
points out, though, that, "it seems
to me that if unnecessary force
were used on Perkins by Sgt. Kirts

and Brunot knew this, he would be
guilty of serious misconduct in
covering up an unlawful action by a
police officer against a Stanford stu
dent." This assertion reinforces the
importance of uncovering the un
clear details of the situation at the
jail facility. Also, since Kennedy, as
Kaplan points out in the report, is at
least partially responsible for dis
ciplining Stanford police officers,
the Kaplan report is insufficient and
the University must investigate this
matter further.
A second issue arises out of this
whole incident — the perceptions,
attitudes and conduct of Stanford
police toward blacks, particularly
black male students. In recent
years black students have com
plained that they have been pulled
over and accosted by police officers
because they looked "suspicious,"
or because they fit vague descrip
tions of black suspects the police
are looking for. We intend to set up
a committee to investigate the
legitimacy of such allegations and to
look into police perceptions and
conduct in general at Stanford and
in the Palo Alto area.
In this light, we must also state
that police misconduct of this type
and of more serious forms is not
only inappropriate for the Stanford
community, but for all communit

ies, be they Stanford, East Palo
Alto, the south side of Chicago or
New York City.
We also question the appropriate
ness of the equipment the Stanford
police are outfitted with for patroll
ing the Stanford campus, particu
larly the inner campus. An officer
on a motocross-type motorcycle,
with a side-holstered handgun and a
riot-type helmet is an intimidating
and unpleasant figure to walk past
in White Plaza. We question
whether this type of equipment is
really necessary to patrol the
campus, and we ask that the Stan
ford Police Department consider
less menacing ways and methods to
protect the campus.
Finally, we see a need for Stan
ford Police Chief Marvin Herrington
to meet with students to
discuss black community and
Stanford community concerns,
police officer misconduct and meth
ods the Stanford Police Department
can and will pursue to address
these problems.
We anticipate hearing from and
participating in further discussions
with Kennedy and Herrington to
seek resolutions to the Perkins sit
uation and to the issues addressed
in this document.

Black Student Union at Stanford.)
