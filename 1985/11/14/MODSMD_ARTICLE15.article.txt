Facts Incorrect
On Coffee House

A teacher in the medieval period
once told his students: "Do not
speak unless you can improve upon
the silence." After reading Homer
Chin's column "Students Don't
Deserve the Coffee House" (The
Daily, Nov. 8), I commend this
teacher's advice to Mr. Chin con
cerning writing. With an inaccurate
article based in careless generaliza
tions, Mr. Chin left readers with
misconceptions regarding the Cof
fee House and its management.
Chin writes that the ASSU is
paying off the Coffee House's debt
through a "collective of $30,000
out of student funds." He is mis
taken. According to the financial
manager of the ASSU, the funding
system — the component covering
fee assessments — is independent
from the business operations of the
ASSU. As students, we pay quar
terly fee assessments into two
categories: special and association

fees. The Coffee House owes
Tresidder Union and the ASSU
around $30,000. This debt, more
likely to be absorbed by the ASSU
than to be collected by them, is
subsumed within the business
operations of the ASSU. Students'
money does not go into the busi
ness operations. Neither Mr. Chin
nor any student assumed the
"liabilities of the Coffee House."
When the Coffee House lost
money because of the strike in
1982, Stanford students were not
responsible for pricing food items.
Contrary to Chin's claim, neither
full-time manager was a student,
and neither is currently working
for some "high tech" firm, making
$40,000 annually. After managing
at the Coffee House for one year, I
counter Chin's proclivity for pes
simistic generalization with one
point: Not every student manager
at the Coffee House is motivated
purely by the pursuit of resume
stardom. Life can transcend the
inevitable motive of monetary
success found in many students at
this school, whether graduate or
post-doctoral.
Mr. Chin needs to be more care
ful in his criticism. He is happy the
Coffee House is "out of student
hands." But the debt is not being
subsidized by student hands, and
the mistakes made in pricing in
1982 were unattributable to stu
dents. And what about student
managers whose performance on
the job took "second priority to an
upcoming political science mid
term?" The blue book in my hands
on democracy in America did not
impede my ability the night before
to make a cappucino or to assign
an extra worker to an over
crowded sandwich line.
