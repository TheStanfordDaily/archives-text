## Stanford Maintains Ties With Nearby Silicon Valley 
### DAN DeLUCE Staff writer 
Ties between Stanford and Silicon Valley run so
deep it's sometimes difficult to separate the two. Asst.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Brian Reid goes so far as
to say, "The boundary between companies and Stan
ford is artificial."
"The relationship operates on several different
levels," said Chris Shinkman, director of the Career
Planning and Placement Center.
Silicon Valley companies actively recruit at Stanford.
They directly and indirectly fund research. Stanford
faculty and trustees are on the board of directors of
many companies or do consulting work. Some of
Silicon Valley's major firms are on Stanford land.
"Silicon Valley companies are really hungry for Stan
ford students," said Reid.
Shinkman said Stanford students, because of the
University's proximity to the area, have an edge over
other students in getting hired by Silicon Valley com
panies. "These companies know more about Stanford,
about its students and its faculty," he said.
Hewlett-Packard, Advanced Micro Devices,
Spectrophysics, Varian and ROLM are the major
Silicon Valley companies that recruit at Stanford, ac
cording to Shinkman.
Employees of these companies "are likely to be
Stanford graduates," Shinkman said. The four letters
of ROLM, for instance, stand for the initials of the four

founders of the company â€” all Stanford graduates.
And recruiting Stanford students becomes a self
perpetuating system. A Silicon Valley company "hires
Stanford people, and they work out well, and then they
want to hire more," according to Shinkman.
New competition for Silicon Valley
But in recruiting Stanford students as well as in ear
ning profits, Silicon Valley firms no longer have a
monopoly in the high-tech industry.
"There are certainly some other high-tech areas
which are growing," Shinkman said. He cited the "128
belt" outside of Boston (named for route 128), and
Austin, Texas.
Companies popular with students are those with "big
research labs like DEC (Digital Electronics Corpora
tion), IBM, Xerox," said Reid.
"DEC just opened a research lab in Palo Alto on
Alma Street," Reid said.
"They just put a lot of money into these labs. It's ob
vious they're trying to build interest with Stanford stu
dents.
"That's an expensive piece of real estate. You don't
go building that without a good reason," Reid said.
Conflict of interest?
Although the close ties to Silicon Valley can have its
advantages, they sometimes lead to conflict of inter
est.
