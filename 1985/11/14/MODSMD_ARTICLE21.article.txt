## Stanford Maintains Ties With Nearby Silicon Valley 
### DAN DeLUCE Staff writer 
Ties between Stanford and Silicon Valley run so
deep it's sometimes difficult to separate the two. Asst.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Brian Reid goes so far as
to say, "The boundary between companies and Stan
ford is artificial."
"The relationship operates on several different
levels," said Chris Shinkman, director of the Career
Planning and Placement Center.
Silicon Valley companies actively recruit at Stanford.
They directly and indirectly fund research. Stanford
faculty and trustees are on the board of directors of
many companies or do consulting work. Some of
Silicon Valley's major firms are on Stanford land.
"Silicon Valley companies are really hungry for Stan
ford students," said Reid.
Shinkman said Stanford students, because of the
University's proximity to the area, have an edge over
other students in getting hired by Silicon Valley com
panies. "These companies know more about Stanford,
about its students and its faculty," he said.
Hewlett-Packard, Advanced Micro Devices,
Spectrophysics, Varian and ROLM are the major
Silicon Valley companies that recruit at Stanford, ac
cording to Shinkman.
Employees of these companies "are likely to be
Stanford graduates," Shinkman said. The four letters
of ROLM, for instance, stand for the initials of the four

founders of the company â€” all Stanford graduates.
And recruiting Stanford students becomes a self
perpetuating system. A Silicon Valley company "hires
Stanford people, and they work out well, and then they
want to hire more," according to Shinkman.
New competition for Silicon Valley
But in recruiting Stanford students as well as in ear
ning profits, Silicon Valley firms no longer have a
monopoly in the high-tech industry.
"There are certainly some other high-tech areas
which are growing," Shinkman said. He cited the "128
belt" outside of Boston (named for route 128), and
Austin, Texas.
Companies popular with students are those with "big
research labs like DEC (Digital Electronics Corpora
tion), IBM, Xerox," said Reid.
"DEC just opened a research lab in Palo Alto on
Alma Street," Reid said.
"They just put a lot of money into these labs. It's ob
vious they're trying to build interest with Stanford stu
dents.
"That's an expensive piece of real estate. You don't
go building that without a good reason," Reid said.
Conflict of interest?
Although the close ties to Silicon Valley can have its
advantages, they sometimes lead to conflict of inter
est.

"When a professor has an interest in a company and
his students work for that company, it creates an am
biguous relationship," Reid said. "To whom does the
student owe allegiance?"
A "classic example" of conflict of interest, said Reid,
is when the federal government funds research to
develop a new computer program.
The professor creates the program, but has "a com
pany on the side, sells the program commercially and
hires students," Reid said. Also, the companies that
buy the program usually need to consult its creator.
In effect, "the government is paying for research in a
professor's company," Reid said. "I know several in
cidences of this going on in the last six months. I can
think of three separate incidences of this happening
with three different professors."
Another example of conflict of interest, Reid said, is
when companies donate computers.
"Let's say a professor has an interest in a company.
He arranges for a company to donate computers that
are still not totally developed," Reid said.
"The computers are not ready to go to market. You
have to put time and energy into developing software
in order to be able to use it.
"Mysteriously this software developed by students
finds its way back to the company," Reid said.
"The company is using Stanford as a research lab,"
he said. Reid said he knew of "two incidences of this
happening in the last couple of years."
Reid pointed out there are also many advantages to
links with Silicon Valley.
"The computers are for free, not fully developed,
but better than nothing," he said.
Another advantage, he said, is that "the University
always benefits from exchanging ideas with smart
people. These people being graduates makes the ex
change that much easier."

Finally, "A large amount of dollars pours in here
from Silicon companies," Reid said.
Valley lures faculty
However, one of the most significant problems asso
ciated with Stanford's Silicon Valley relationship is not
conflict of interest, but losing faculty to Silicon Valley
companies, according to Reid.
"It's so easy to leave (Stanford). All you have to do
is pick up a phone and call a friend and say 'I want to
leave Stanford,' and you can get a job the next day,"
Reid said. Faculty leaving for industry is "a real
disease," he added.
"Working at Stanford is a big nuisance, you have to
go to so many committees and meetings," he said.
There are too many commitments to draw a professor
away from his research and work, Reid said.
"Every professor I know is hopelessly behind," he
said.
"You wake up one day, and you realize you haven't
had a vacation in a year, you work 14 hours a day,"
Reid said.
Working for a company appears more attractive,
Reid said, not as much for the higher pay but because
it's "less intense, it allows a little more time to enjoy
life."
Another factor leading to faculty migration is the fact
that Stanford is "hopelessly undercapitalized," Reid
said.
He said faculty have to struggle for research money
to pay for their own new computers, whereas, "in a
company there are computers everywhere, ready for
use.
"There's some hunger at Stanford (for more capital
funds)," he said.
The tight relationship between Stanford and Silicon
Valley has its advantages and disadvantages, but all in
all, the relationship appears to be symbiotic. Stanford,
according to Shinkman, "is lucky to be in the location
we're in. At the same time, the companies are lucky to
be close by a resource of talent and future employees."
