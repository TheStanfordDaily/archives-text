# Mac Reigns at Stanford
## 
### ANDREA OLIVAS 
The Apple Macintosh continues
to be the most popular of the three
computer systems that can be pur
chased at less than wholesale price
through the University Microdisc
Discount Plan.
Hewlett-Packard and IBM also
offer their respective versions of
the personal computer at a low rate
through the same program.
Since 1984, these three leading
computer firms have been offering
programs comparable to the
Microdisc program at 24 colleges
and universities across the country.
Schools involved in the program in
clude from east to west, Boston
College and Harvard University,
Northwestern University and the
University of Chicago, Rice Univer
sity, and the University of Utah.
Each of the systems is offered at
a substantially reduced price to the
students, faculty and employees of
these institutions, and the discount
program is used very extensively
by all the universities that partici
pate in it.
The Stanford program is spon
sored by Instruction and Research
Information Systems (IRIS).
Local computer retailers don't
even try to compete with the com
puter discount programs, as the
lowest retail prices available are
still 30 to 40 percent higher than
the prices though IRIS.
The price of the Macintosh and
the ease with which it is operated

are what seem to attract the per
sonal computer purchaser. Since
the Microdisc Consortium began,
the use of typewriters among stu
dents seems to have become more
and more infrequent as their
careers at Stanford progress.
Most freshmen said they bought
the Macintosh with the intent of
using it for word processing.
Freshman Shannon Jackson said
she waited to buy her Macintosh
until after she had her first Western
Culture paper assignment.
Shannon "used half a bottle of
Liquid Paper" on her first paper,
and then bought her Macintosh,
which she said she considers very
easy to use. She said she hasn't
heard any complaints from profes
sors, either.
Junior Vikky Sluzky bought her
Macintosh when she was a fresh
man. When Vikky bought her
Macintosh, "It was the thing to do.
Now, the concept of typing a paper
is so alien to me at this point," she
said.
Sluzky, a chemical engineering
major, said she now uses her com
puter for the storage and editing of
lab reports and write-ups, utilizing
both the Macpaint and the Macwrite
software that comes with the sys
tem. She said most of her profes
sors and TAs have been very
receptive to assignments submitted
in the Macintosh's computerized
print.
She noted that there are pro
grams available at Meyer Library
which are becoming integrated with

several different engineering
courses.
The Macintosh is marketed as a
very user-friendly computer sys
tem; some say that it is too easy to
use.
Freshman Jaime Vargas said that
he'll stick with his IBM Peanut (a
smaller version of the IBM PC) be
cause he tires very quickly of the
"silly pictures" that the Macintosh
displays.
Macintosh print is appearing on
everything from midterms and
homework assignments to the
flyers which appear on every dining
hall table on campus.
For those who dislike the LOTS
facilities on campus or perhaps en
joy studying to the sounds of loud
rock and roll music, owning a
Macintosh allows one to log onto
the LOTS system from the comfort
of her own room. To make this pos
sible, a modem (which makes the
hook-up by phone) and appropriate
software are all that is necessary.
The IRIS and Microdisc offices
are located in Cypress Hall.
Microsoft, the company that
makes most of the software com
patible with the Macintosh besides
Apple, will be producing integrated
software packages for the new
512K8 (kilobyte) model; the
software for the 128KB model will
also eventually be discontinued,
since the model itself has been dis
continued. The 128KB model expe
rienced difficulties in word process
ing and business applications due to
its limited storage capacity.
