Harvard Divests
Harvard University will divest.
Harvard President Derek Bok
said Oct. 22 that the University will
divest immediately — of all stock in
companies that contributed to the
demise of the long-haired North
American wooly mammoth.
Two Harvard freshmen who
"wanted to protest something" left
a flier on Bofc's doorstep demanding
that the university divest of all its
stock in companies that proved so
cially injurious to the wooly mam
moth, which has been extinct for
about 100,000 years.
In a statement issued by his of
fice, Bok wrote:
"Henceforth, Harvard will have
nothing to do with any corporation
that teases, intimidates, harasses
or otherwise contributes to the
demise of wooly mammoths."
One of the freshmen called the

decision to "remove Harvard
morally and financially from the
arena of mammoth discrimination" a
"victory cast down from heaven."
But at the same time, the pair ac
knowledged that their fight for
liberation has just begun.
"We can't say we've won the war
just because one university has
agreed to divest," one of the fresh
men explained. "The wooly mam
moth is not yet saved — it's still ex
tinct."
Do what you like,
but don't do it here
"No Word Processing."
That's the word at the Macintosh
computer station in the basement of
Harvard's Science Center.
One year ago, Harvard installed
Macintoshes for students to use in
classes which required Macintosh

programs. But over the year, a
"string of confrontations" and at
least one fist-fight broke out be
tween students who needed the
machines for Macintosh-related
coursework and others who wanted
to use them for other school work.
(Show a computer nerd "Rambo"
and see what you get?)
Enough is enough, said Harvard
administrators, so the signs went
up. In addition, the school has hired
proctors to inspect the area for
would-be illegal word processors.
Disciplinary action is planned for
anyone who violates the Macintosh
law.
Consider yourselves warned,
use is No. 1
The University of Southern Cali
fornia (Spoiled Children, Second
Choice, Some Chumps, etc.) has

lost some of its status as an
eminent sporting power, so it ap
pears Tommy Trojan is looking
elsewhere for fame and glory.
If we can't be No. 1 in football,
the Trojans seem to be saying, we
can at least be No. 1. in crime.
Although the FBI lists the Uni
versity of Maryland as the nation's
most violent campus, USC police
say their campus is indeed the No.
1 crime campus in the country.
Fifty-eight violent crimes were
reported last year at the 30,000-
student USC campus, USC police
Lt. Dwight Sanders told the Associ
ated Press.
The previously released FBI fig
ures listed 53 violent crimes at the
University of Maryland and 45 each
at UCLA and Michigan State Uni
versity.
Because USC is protected by a
private security force, the univer

sity doesn't report its crime figures
directly to the FBI.
Sanders said that could be a rea
son why USC's crime rate was ex
cluded from the FBI report.
Sanders said three rapes, 13 as
saults with deadly weapons and 42
robberies were reported at USC in
1984. Through October this year,
there have been 71 violent crimes
reported on the campus.
Conquest, Trojans. March on.
No more sexism for
Cal State schools
The chancellor of the California
State University system has
banished a Latin word from the sys
tem's motto after she determined
that the word was sexist.
W. Ann Reynolds, the first
woman chancellor of the system,
observed the offending word "Vir"

as the first word in the motto "Vir,
Veritas, Vox."
Vir, university officials said in a
report, is a gender-specific word
that refers only to men. The motto
meant "man, truth, voice."
"After consulting numerous Latin
scholars and receiving numerous
suggestions on how the motto could
be changed to include both men and
women," university officials
devised a new motto.
It is: "Vox, Veritas, Vita."
The report noted that education
begins with vox, the voice, and
pursues Veritas, the truth. The
result is that "through education,
the quality of life, vita, is en
hanced. "
So there it is, and there is that.
But is there any "there" there?
