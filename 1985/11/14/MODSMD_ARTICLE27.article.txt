### ROBERT BLUMEN 
Despite a disappointing opening
number, the San Francisco Sym
phony provided a satisfying evening
of fine music Saturday evening in
Davies Symphony Hall.
Guest conductor Erich Leinsdorf
opened the concert with Arnold
Schoenberg's tone poem
"Verklarte Nach" ("Transfigured
Night"). The piece is based on a
poem by Richard Dehmel, which
describes a man and a woman
walking in a cold, hostile night. The
woman is carrying the child of a
stranger, but now she is in love
with her companion. When she tells

him, he accepts her child as his
own, transfiguring the night
through their love.
Schoenberg tried to convey the
various moods of the poem through
music. The piece alternates be
tween modulating passages of
rhythmic intricacy and placid,
serene stretches with simple
themes.
"Transfigured Night," Schoen
berg's first major work, his most
popular, was originally written for a
string sextet of two violins, two
violas and two cellos. It was later
transcribed by the composer for a
full string orchestra.
If the evening's performance
showed anything, it is that the work

is better left in the original version.
The transcribed score poses for
midable difficulties that Leinsdorf
did not fully overcome.
The full orchestra version does
have greater weight than the
original, due to the heavier sound of
the large ensemble. Leinsdorf took
advantage of the bigger sound, de
veloping a richer dynamic range
that would be impossible to achieve
with a chamber ensemble.
But in the chamber version, each
voice can be clearly distinguished.
When the piece is played by an or
chestra of 50 or more instruments,
the individual melodic lines blend
into an amorphous mass of sound.
Whether it was the fault of the
score or the conductor is hard to
say, but melodies and counter
points that form the texture of the
original version were not articulated
clearly in Saturday's performance.
There were a few moments of
clarity in the middle and just before
the end, but the rest was muddy.
After the Schoenberg piece, the
first part of the concert concluded
with Spanish pianist Alicia de Lar
rocha in a spirited performance of
Maurice Ravel's "Concerto in G for
Piano and Orchestra."
Composed in 1931, the concerto
reflects the influence of the jazz
movement of the time. Specifically,
the concerto shares a thematic
resemblance to George Gershwin's
"An American in Paris" and
"Rhapsody in Blue."
The work is a collage of interest
ing sounds, ebullient rhythms and
impertinent melodies. It starts with
the snapping of a whip, which

returns in the third movement. The
work contains trombone slides,
clarinet smears and raucous jibes
by the bassoon.
De Larrocha opened with great
animation and technical virtuosity.
In the first movement, where
themes and snatches of melody
bounce alternately between the or
chestra and the piano, Leinsdorf
and de Larrocha coordinated their
efforts meticulously. They hurled
precise musical Jabs back and forth.
In the slower second movement, de
Larrocha produced a round, rich
tone, then returned in the third for
a rather plodding conclusion.
Leinsdorf closed with a superb
performance of Dvorak's ninth
symphony,"From the New World."
Leinsdorf's performance demon
strated the drama and emotional
range of this popular work.
The Czech composer Antonin
Dvorak had come to America to
direct the National Conservatory of
Music in New York when he
composed the ninth symphony;
hence the title, "From the New
World." The piece does not,
however, use American folk music
themes. It is as characteristic of the
composer's homeland as any of his
music.
Leinsdorfs interpretation of the
piece emphasized the great con
trast both in dynamic range and or
chestral color inherent in the work.
Too often it is performed as almost
a brass fanfare, with its numerous
crescendos all at the maximum
level, indistinguishable from one an
other.
Leinsdorf brought the orchestra

to a powerful dramatic peak in the
first climax, immediately after the
opening phrase. This level of inten
sity was not to be achieved again
until the end; Leinsdorf showed
restraint in the inner movements.
When he finally unleashed the full
forces of the orchestra at the con
clusion, it was more satisfying be
cause of the supreme contrast with
the subdued earlier passages.
In contrast to the Schoenberg
work, the Dvorak was transparent.
The many voices could always be
heard. Leinsdorf maintained an
astute sense for the balance be
tween the solo, the counterpoint
and the accompanying background.

"From the New World" is a de
manding work for an orchestra.
Numerous solo passages expose
the individual players. The principal
French horn played beautifully and
skillfully through several treach
erous passages. The English horn
solo in the second movement was
excellent, and the timpani player
was exceptional, as were the cel
lists.
The Dvorak symphony was the •
most well-received of the three !
works by the audience. Leinsdorf '
was called back to the stage several ;
times, and the woodwind and brass ;
soloists were given enthusiastic ap- •
plause. I

Schoenberg's tone poem
"Verklarte Nach" ("Transfigured
Night"). The piece is based on a
poem by Richard Dehmel, which
describes a man and a woman
walking in a cold, hostile night. The
woman is carrying the child of a
stranger, but now she is in love
with her companion. When she tells

him, he accepts her child as his
own, transfiguring the night
through their love.
Schoenberg tried to convey the
various moods of the poem through
music. The piece alternates be
tween modulating passages of
rhythmic intricacy and placid,
serene stretches with simple
themes.
"Transfigured Night," Schoen
berg's first major work, his most
popular, was originally written for a
string sextet of two violins, two
violas and two cellos. It was later
transcribed by the composer for a
full string orchestra.
If the evening's performance
showed anything, it is that the work

is better left in the original version.
The transcribed score poses for
midable difficulties that Leinsdorf
did not fully overcome.
The full orchestra version does
have greater weight than the
original, due to the heavier sound of
the large ensemble. Leinsdorf took
advantage of the bigger sound, de
veloping a richer dynamic range
that would be impossible to achieve
with a chamber ensemble.
But in the chamber version, each
voice can be clearly distinguished.
When the piece is played by an or
chestra of 50 or more instruments,
the individual melodic lines blend
into an amorphous mass of sound.
Whether it was the fault of the
score or the conductor is hard to
say, but melodies and counter
points that form the texture of the
original version were not articulated
clearly in Saturday's performance.
There were a few moments of
clarity in the middle and just before
the end, but the rest was muddy.
After the Schoenberg piece, the
first part of the concert concluded
with Spanish pianist Alicia de Lar
rocha in a spirited performance of
Maurice Ravel's "Concerto in G for
Piano and Orchestra."
Composed in 1931, the concerto
reflects the influence of the jazz
movement of the time. Specifically,
the concerto shares a thematic
resemblance to George Gershwin's
"An American in Paris" and
"Rhapsody in Blue."
The work is a collage of interest
ing sounds, ebullient rhythms and
impertinent melodies. It starts with
the snapping of a whip, which

returns in the third movement. The
work contains trombone slides,
clarinet smears and raucous jibes
by the bassoon.
De Larrocha opened with great
animation and technical virtuosity.
In the first movement, where
themes and snatches of melody
bounce alternately between the or
chestra and the piano, Leinsdorf
and de Larrocha coordinated their
efforts meticulously. They hurled
precise musical Jabs back and forth.
In the slower second movement, de
Larrocha produced a round, rich
tone, then returned in the third for
a rather plodding conclusion.
Leinsdorf closed with a superb
performance of Dvorak's ninth
symphony,"From the New World."
Leinsdorf's performance demon
strated the drama and emotional
range of this popular work.
The Czech composer Antonin
Dvorak had come to America to
direct the National Conservatory of
Music in New York when he
composed the ninth symphony;
hence the title, "From the New
World." The piece does not,
however, use American folk music
themes. It is as characteristic of the
composer's homeland as any of his
music.
Leinsdorfs interpretation of the
piece emphasized the great con
trast both in dynamic range and or
chestral color inherent in the work.
Too often it is performed as almost
a brass fanfare, with its numerous
crescendos all at the maximum
level, indistinguishable from one an
other.
Leinsdorf brought the orchestra

to a powerful dramatic peak in the
first climax, immediately after the
opening phrase. This level of inten
sity was not to be achieved again
until the end; Leinsdorf showed
restraint in the inner movements.
When he finally unleashed the full
forces of the orchestra at the con
clusion, it was more satisfying be
cause of the supreme contrast with
the subdued earlier passages.
In contrast to the Schoenberg
work, the Dvorak was transparent.
The many voices could always be
heard. Leinsdorf maintained an
astute sense for the balance be
tween the solo, the counterpoint
and the accompanying background.

"From the New World" is a de
manding work for an orchestra.
Numerous solo passages expose
the individual players. The principal
French horn played beautifully and
skillfully through several treach
erous passages. The English horn
solo in the second movement was
excellent, and the timpani player
was exceptional, as were the cel
lists.
The Dvorak symphony was the •
most well-received of the three !
works by the audience. Leinsdorf '
was called back to the stage several ;
times, and the woodwind and brass ;
soloists were given enthusiastic ap- •
plause. I
