Selected cuts from these albums will be played on KZSU tomorrow at 6 p.m.

Pete Townshend — "White
City" ★★★★
Well, it ain't The Who, but who
expected it to be? Pete has cer
tainly moved into the '80s. He's
refined his sound and has moved
the wizard guitar trademark to the
background, much as he did in his
last solo LP, "All the Best Cowboys
Have Chinese Eyes." Townshend
can still write powerful songs, just
like in the old days with The Who.
He is among the few musicians who
can use synthesizers as a backbone

to songs that make you want to turn
your stereo up until it melts. With
The Who, though, he could make
you want to hurl bottles against
your wall and throw your Macintosh
through your window. And that's
the difference. Pete had something
to yell about then. Things are going
pretty well for him now. He's out of
alcohol, drugs, marriage trouble.
He looks back with more accep
tance, even pride. In this album,
he's at his best. The beat, guitar,
drums, vocals are all pulsing with
energy. "Give Blood,"
"Secondhand Love" and "Come to
Mama" are kick-butt. On "Face the
Face," Pete tries a funky backbeat
that works remarkably well. At the
very least, other songs are melodic
and pleasant. It's a strong album
that makes you wonder what would
have happened if he had written
these for The Who.

Apartheid — "Sun City"
(not rated)
It's a good thing we have an

excuse not to rate this record. If it
were just another profit-oriented al
bum, we would rate it about a two,
make fun of it for a while and get on
with Wall of Voodoo. There are only
seven songs, two of which are the
title track "Sun City" in two equally
tiring extra-long versions. The vo
cals are mixed so badly that it's
hard to tell Pat Benatar from Bruce
Springsteen. (Pat's the one wearing
Spandex.) One trashrap song
features everybody in rapdom. Its
only virtue is Gil-Scot Heron, who

refrains from the temptation to yell
in tempo and instead just talks.
Herbie Hancock, Stanley Jordan
and other jazz studs improvise
some on the jazzish "The Struggle
Continues," and Bono Hewson
finishes the record off (literally) by
screaming and ranting and raving so
much that he makes more sense
played backwards. (Try it, serious
music fans.) It's great that rock 'n'
roll continues to defy all its critics
and move in a socially conscious di
rection, and "Sun City" is well
within that trend. However, the
musical results are less than they
could have been. Sure, request the
single, but don't feel that you have
to buy this less-than-adequate al
bum to support the cause it
promotes.
Wall of Voodoo — "Seven Days
in Sammystown" ★★
Before y'all go rush out to buy
this, remember that Stan Ridge way
left already. This means no more of
his vocals, obviously, which in turn
means no "Mexican Radio" or "Ring

of .Fire." It means the band has got
ten a whole new vocalist, who
sounds like everybody else, unless
he's trying to sound like Stan
(which he'd never admit, so you
needn't ask him). Listen to the
near-miss "Far Side of Crazy" for
details. The group has just gone to
heck since Stan left, too — they're
all dressing funny, a couple of them
are looking downright scary, and no
one is around to write good songs
anymore. The band seems lost in
some kind of new wave-rap-dirge

gloom-hardcore-nowhere-land, and
there is no leader around to help
them get back to their best — their
older style. If they ever do this and
get their confidence back, maybe
they'll get haircuts and,dress nor
mally and eat right and get a life and
maybe even a real contract. UntTil
then, let's face facts. These guys
have practically nothing to say, and
certainly no medium in which to not
say it. This is a bad thing in the
music world. Please, please, don't
buy this and encourage them.
Ignore them and maybe they'll go
away (see real-life example below).
Mrs. Work: Now Telford, dear,
don't go outside. Those Wall of
Voodoo boys are out there. Ignore
them, and maybe they'll go away.
(Telford ignores them)
W.0.V.: Hey, Telford. Yo, Tel
ford. Oh, fudge, he's ignoring us.
Let's just go play with the Lords of
the New Church.
Exeunt Wall of Voodoo, forever.

excuse not to rate this record. If it
were just another profit-oriented al
bum, we would rate it about a two,
make fun of it for a while and get on
with Wall of Voodoo. There are only
seven songs, two of which are the
title track "Sun City" in two equally
tiring extra-long versions. The vo
cals are mixed so badly that it's
hard to tell Pat Benatar from Bruce
Springsteen. (Pat's the one wearing
Spandex.) One trashrap song
features everybody in rapdom. Its
only virtue is Gil-Scot Heron, who

refrains from the temptation to yell
in tempo and instead just talks.
Herbie Hancock, Stanley Jordan
and other jazz studs improvise
some on the jazzish "The Struggle
Continues," and Bono Hewson
finishes the record off (literally) by
screaming and ranting and raving so
much that he makes more sense
played backwards. (Try it, serious
music fans.) It's great that rock 'n'
roll continues to defy all its critics
and move in a socially conscious di
rection, and "Sun City" is well
within that trend. However, the
musical results are less than they
could have been. Sure, request the
single, but don't feel that you have
to buy this less-than-adequate al
bum to support the cause it
promotes.
Wall of Voodoo — "Seven Days
in Sammystown" ★★
Before y'all go rush out to buy
this, remember that Stan Ridge way
left already. This means no more of
his vocals, obviously, which in turn
means no "Mexican Radio" or "Ring

of .Fire." It means the band has got
ten a whole new vocalist, who
sounds like everybody else, unless
he's trying to sound like Stan
(which he'd never admit, so you
needn't ask him). Listen to the
near-miss "Far Side of Crazy" for
details. The group has just gone to
heck since Stan left, too — they're
all dressing funny, a couple of them
are looking downright scary, and no
one is around to write good songs
anymore. The band seems lost in
some kind of new wave-rap-dirge

gloom-hardcore-nowhere-land, and
there is no leader around to help
them get back to their best — their
older style. If they ever do this and
get their confidence back, maybe
they'll get haircuts and,dress nor
mally and eat right and get a life and
maybe even a real contract. UntTil
then, let's face facts. These guys
have practically nothing to say, and
certainly no medium in which to not
say it. This is a bad thing in the
music world. Please, please, don't
buy this and encourage them.
Ignore them and maybe they'll go
away (see real-life example below).
Mrs. Work: Now Telford, dear,
don't go outside. Those Wall of
Voodoo boys are out there. Ignore
them, and maybe they'll go away.
(Telford ignores them)
W.0.V.: Hey, Telford. Yo, Tel
ford. Oh, fudge, he's ignoring us.
Let's just go play with the Lords of
the New Church.
Exeunt Wall of Voodoo, forever.

Selected cuts from these albums will be played on KZSU tomorrow at 6 p.m.

Pete Townshend — "White
City" ★★★★
Well, it ain't The Who, but who
expected it to be? Pete has cer
tainly moved into the '80s. He's
refined his sound and has moved
the wizard guitar trademark to the
background, much as he did in his
last solo LP, "All the Best Cowboys
Have Chinese Eyes." Townshend
can still write powerful songs, just
like in the old days with The Who.
He is among the few musicians who
can use synthesizers as a backbone

to songs that make you want to turn
your stereo up until it melts. With
The Who, though, he could make
you want to hurl bottles against
your wall and throw your Macintosh
through your window. And that's
the difference. Pete had something
to yell about then. Things are going
pretty well for him now. He's out of
alcohol, drugs, marriage trouble.
He looks back with more accep
tance, even pride. In this album,
he's at his best. The beat, guitar,
drums, vocals are all pulsing with
energy. "Give Blood,"
"Secondhand Love" and "Come to
Mama" are kick-butt. On "Face the
Face," Pete tries a funky backbeat
that works remarkably well. At the
very least, other songs are melodic
and pleasant. It's a strong album
that makes you wonder what would
have happened if he had written
these for The Who.
