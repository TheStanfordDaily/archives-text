### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
Despite student criticism of the acceptance
of a white South African student on a full
track scholarship here, NCAA and Pacific 10
Conference officials said that there are no
recruiting restrictions based on nationality.
"There are no specific restrictions on ath
letes from that country besides the 2.0
(grade point average) qualifier," which
applies to every student-athlete, according
to Tom Calder, legislative assistant for the
National Collegiate Athletic Association.
The recruitment and acceptance of fresh
man James Alborough, a South African
native, was criticized by students in a Black
Student Union (BSU) rally on Oct. 14 and
again when University President Donald
Kennedy was questioned during a Nov. 3
BSU meeting in the Ujamaa lounge.
The protesters suggested that Alborough's
recruitment undermines the efforts of those
trying to bring about change in South Africa's
racist system of apartheid and the Univer
sity's policies toward that country.
During Kennedy's presentation on Nov. 3,
BSU member David Troutt said that Al
borough's acceptance violates, in principle,
an international agreement barring South
African athletes from competing in sanctioned
events.
"No one is protesting the individual â€” he's
not a spokesperson for South Africa. . . . It's
what it means when the University actively
recruits South Africans" that is the issue,
Troutt said.
Alborough refused to comment on the con
troversy.
BSU representatives have also refused ad
ditional comment, saying that their state
ments will he released following the publica

tion of Monday's edition of The Real News,
the black student newspaper here.
Dennis Brutus, a black South African now
living in the United States and teaching En
glish at Swarthmore College in Philadelphia,
has been an outspoken critic of white South
African participation in international athletic
events and said yesterday that the "protest is
reasonable."
Brutus, who spoke at Stanford on Oct. 25,
was influential in the movement to ban South
Africa from the Olympic Games in 1964. He
was founding secretary of the South African
Sports Association and president of the South
African Non-Racial Olympic Committee.
Brutus said that he plans to issue a state
ment calling for restrictions on the right of
South African whites to compete in intercol
legiate competition. He will send the state
ment to the United Nations and several uni
versities in the United States, he said.
University administrators have defended
the recruitment and acceptance of Al
borough, arguing that an individual should not
be held accountable for the policies of his or
her nation.
Although the fact that Alborough is South
African "crossed my mind" when his accep
tance was being considered, "the bottom line
is I would be very reluctant to judge individ
uals and hold them responsible for the actions
of their nation," Dean of Admissions Jean
Fetter said.
"It's like holding all Soviet citizens respon
sible for not allowing . . . any of the Soviet
prisoners to leave that country," Fetter said.
"He was admitted on the basis of his merits
both as a student and as an athlete."
Kennedy agreed with Fetter, saying,
"When [Alborough] runs for Stanford, he
