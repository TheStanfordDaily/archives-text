# 'Cease Fire' Should Simply Stop Playing
## 
### FELICIA WONG 
The Vietnam War experience is
an open wound in the American
psyche, and films that deal with the
subject are often moving and
thought-provoking. Unfortunately,
"Cease Fire" does not fit into this
category. The problem with the
film is not its intentions, which are
noble enough, but rather its execu
tion, which is technically sloppy and
devoid of interesting plot develop
ment. "Cease Fire" is dedicated to
Vietnam veterans and soldiers mis
sing in action. Too bad â€” they
deserve better.
From the beginning of "Cease
Fire," the audience is introduced to
stock, stereotypical characters.
Don Johnson (of "Miami Vice"
fame) stars as Tim, an unemployed
veteran who is married and lives in
suburban Miami with his suburban
family. The family is poor (the tele
vision repossession company has
sent its third notice), but surviving
happily enough. Tim tucks his
children in every night, loving
father style.
In the unemployment office, Tim
meets Luke, another Vietnam vet.
Suddenly, all the memories of
" 'Nam" that Tim has supposedly
repressed resurface. Tim becomes
destructive, depressed and violent
because of these memories. His
ever-concerned and loving wife

Paula (Lisa Blount) begins to
worry.
Unfortunately, director David
Nutter still has a few hours of
screen time to fill. Very little else of
any interest or consequence hap
pens for the rest of "Cease Fire."
The audience is shown many
scenes of Tim and Luke drinking
and reminiscing about their fighting
days. However, these scenes are
convoluted, comprised mostly of
inside jokes and unintelligible
drunken dialogue. Interspersed
with these "buddy" scenes are
flashbacks of Tim's horrible Viet
nam experience. Despite the fact
that the audience is shown the
same blood and machine guns over
and over, no valuable insight into
Tim's mind is provided. Instead, we
are bored by the same blood and
machine guns.
Just when the filmmakers realize
that we've all had just about enough
drunken hysteria, they throw in
scenes which are supposed to be
meaningful character revelations
about Paula or Tim or Luke, but in
stead are only cliches calculated to
shock the audience. Tim beats his
wife, temporarily loses his mind and
threatens his child with a seven
inch blade. These are all actions
that we've seen on daytime soap
operas; while they have their place
in melodrama, they certainly do not
belong in a film that purports to be a
serious investigation of the trials of

a Vietnam veteran.
Some of the worst scenes of an
already bad movie occur during
therapy sessions at a local veteran's
center, where both Paula and Tim
seek help for their problems. With
dialogue like, "Sometimes I wish
love was a faucet, so you could just
turn it on and off," the film becomes
laughable. The leader of the sup
port group (Richard Chaves)
literally has as much appeal as a

wooden post. He has one facial ex
pression; at one point, it was hard
to tell whether he was trying to
comfort Paula in her distress, yell
at her for neglecting her husband or
seduce her.
Technically, "Cease Fire" is ex
tremely poor. Many scenes are out
of focus or poorly lit. Badly cropped
shots in which the subject is not
centered in the frame are cut to
gether with well-composed shots,

giving the film a disturbingly jumpy
look. Because of the poor technical
quality of "Cease Fire, " we never
sink into the world of the characters
the way we should while watching
any film; instead, we are painfully
aware that we are sitting in a movie
theater.
Also, the film lacks continuity. At
one point, when Tim and Luke are
supposedly out of work, we see
them loading a moving truck. Did
they find work? Do they bum
around Miami, loading trucks by day
just for fun?
"Cease Fire" opens with one of
Tim's violent Vietnam nightmares,
which supposedly occurs before he
meets Luke and before all of his
repressed experiences well up
again. The audience is confused by
illogical juxtapositions of time in a
movie that otherwise progresses in
a linear timeline. Is Tim disturbed
from the film's start, or is his lunacy
triggered by his friendship with
Luke, or did the filmmakers just
make a large mistake?
Any interesting points about the
movie, like the fact that Luke is an
artist who recreates his disturbing
visions of the war on paper, are
completely ignored. Details like this
could make Tim and Luke more
than cardboard cutouts, but instead
these items are introduced and
thrown away, simply confusing the
audience.
The crux of "Cease Fire" evi

dently lies in an especially horrible
experience of Tim's war years.
This memory is finally revealed at
the end of the film, and, surpris
ingly enough, it isn't another cliche,
but instead is a genuinely good
twist which would make an excel
lent basis for a film.
Unfortunately, the audience
doesn't learn of this until the last
five minutes of the film, which
doesn't help us survive the middle
95 minutes. If the filmmakers had
revealed the secret to us bit by bit,
creating a real sense of tension and
suspense, perhaps the surprise
ending would have been very effec
tive, As it is, the revelation serves
merely as a trick that the
filmmakers evidently hope will pull
the story together.
"Cease Fire" is a confused
melange of cliches, shock effects,
melodramatic scenes and one
dimensional acting. Granted, Don
Johnson and Lisa Blount aren't
given much to work with, and both
give passable performances, con
sidering the circumstances. But
Robert Lyons, as Luke, deserves a
Purple Heart for overacting, and
Richard Chaves, as the director of
the veteran's center might as well
have been an inanimate object.
During this movie you'll yawt>,
think about the weather and check
your watch. But most of all, youH
wish "Cease Fire" would simply
cease.
