## A 						Double Good Start For Stanford Tennis star is a team player Eldredge Spells Success 
### JIM GUNTON 
If the Rolex Northern California Collegiate Tennis
Championships are any indication of how tough Leigh
Anne Eldredge is going to be this year, then the rest of
Division I women's tennis better watch out.
.Eldredge, competing against a very talented field
that included teammate and No. 1 seed Eleni Rossides,
claimed both the singles and doubles crowns at the
tournament, held here Nov. 1-3. Eldredge was seeded
No. 2.
But Eldredge, a junior, is more than just an out
standing tennis player. She's also a popular, supportive
and enthusiastic team player who derives a lot of satis
faction from her teammates' victories.
. "Leigh Anne has always been very supportive of the
team" claims sophomore teammate Cindy Spiekerman.
"You know she's always going to be out there rooting

for you, and that's a good feeling to have when you're
playing your match."
"Leigh Anne is the kind of steady, dependable player
the team can really rally around," women's tennis
Coach Frank Brennan said. "The other girls always
know she's out there giving 100 percent, both in her
own matches as well as in her support for them. She's
always there."
This type of consistency is also evident in Eldredge's
play on the court, where she has been amazingly suc
cessful. A National Junior Champion as a high school
senior from Altadena in 1982, Eldredge was highly
recruited by Stanford.
When she did decide on Stanford in 1983, she was an
immediate winner. In her first year on the college cir
cuit, she knocked off No. 1 seed Kathy Cummings in
the third round of the 1983 NCAA Championships. She

The season's first big tournament was a big success for junior Leigh Anne Eldredge. She beat
teammate Eleni Rossides to take the singles title and won the doubles crown with Patty Fendick
in last Sunday's Rolex Tournament here.


Senior Julie Carmichael won her first collegiate tournament last weekend, taking the Stanford-
Burger King Women's Intercollegiate Tournament. She finished way ahead of a tough field of
more than 90 golfers from 16 colleges.
eventually lost in the quarterfinals
of that tournament and wound up
ranked No. 9 in the pre-season
Inter-Collegiate Tennis Association
rankings for 1984.
For Eldredge, there are no real
secrets for success. "I'm a very
hard worker, and I've been playing
everyday for the last 10 years," she
said. "Tennis is a very mental
game. The harder I work, the
easier it is to stay mentally sharp."
"Leigh Anne is a very strong
player both mentally and emotion
ally," agrees Rossides. "She's so
consistent that you really have to
play great tennis to beat her."
Despite all these individual ac
colades, Elredge still feels her
greatest achievement as a player
came when the Cardinal won the
NCAA championship in 1983.
"There's no doubt that that was my
greatest moment. Tennis is tradi
tionally such an individually oriented
sport. It felt really good out there
to win as a team."
This enthusiasm for team compe
tition could explain why Eldredge is
such an accomplished doubles
player as well. In 1983, she and
teammate Patti Fendick compiled
the best doubles record in America
for Division I women's tennis. They
were seeded No. 1 going into the

1983 NCAAs, but they lost in the
first round. Eldredge came back,
however, and captured last year's
doubles title with then-senior Linda
Gates.
"I was very disappointed, after

all we had done, to lose so quickly,"
Elredge said of the 1983 campaign.
"That's why winning last year with
Linda was so great."
"She's a champion," Brennan
said. "There's no doubt about it.

She'll find 101 different ways to
beat you. And the best thing about
her is that she inspires the other
girls on the team to play better with
her supportive and enthusiastic
team spirit."

Everyone may have been all smiles after the Rolex Regional Women's Tennis Championships
last Sunday, but it was the team of Leigh Anne Eldredge and Patty Fendick (left) that beat UC-
Berkeley's Alissa Finnerman and Sharon Fletcher in the doubles finals. The win qualified
Eldredge and Fendick for the National Indoor Championships in Houston in February.
