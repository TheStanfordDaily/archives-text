If the Rolex Northern California Collegiate Tennis
Championships are any indication of how tough Leigh
Anne Eldredge is going to be this year, then the rest of
Division I women's tennis better watch out.

that included teammate and No. 1 seed Eleni Rossides,
claimed both the singles and doubles crowns at the
tournament, held here Nov. 1-3. Eldredge was seeded
No. 2.
But Eldredge, a junior, is more than just an out
standing tennis player. She's also a popular, supportive
and enthusiastic team player who derives a lot of satis
faction from her teammates' victories.
. "Leigh Anne has always been very supportive of the
team" claims sophomore teammate Cindy Spiekerman.
"You know she's always going to be out there rooting

for you, and that's a good feeling to have when you're
playing your match."
"Leigh Anne is the kind of steady, dependable player

Coach Frank Brennan said. "The other girls always
know she's out there giving 100 percent, both in her
own matches as well as in her support for them. She's
always there."

play on the court, where she has been amazingly suc

senior from Altadena in 1982, Eldredge was highly
recruited by Stanford.
When she did decide on Stanford in 1983, she was an
immediate winner. In her first year on the college cir
cuit, she knocked off No. 1 seed Kathy Cummings in
the third round of the 1983 NCAA Championships. She

The season's first big tournament was a big success for junior Leigh Anne Eldredge. She beat
teammate Eleni Rossides to take the singles title and won the doubles crown with Patty Fendick
in last Sunday's Rolex Tournament here.


Senior Julie Carmichael won her first collegiate tournament last weekend, taking the Stanford-
Burger King Women's Intercollegiate Tournament. She finished way ahead of a tough field of
more than 90 golfers from 16 colleges.
