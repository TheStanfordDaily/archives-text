# Fencing Teams Win
## 
### LISA MARTINEZ 
Yesterday, Stanford's
nationally-ranked fencing teams
opened their collegiate seasons
on a high note. The men's team
ousted the University of San
Francisco 22-5, while the
women struggled to a 9-7 tri
umph over a club team from San
Francisco State.
Heading into the contest, the
men held a No. 12 ranking na
tionally, while the women en
tered as the nation's eighth best
squad.
Roble Gym echoed with the
sounds of ringing foils as the
men's team challenged the less
experienced USF squad in five
touch bouts. Stanford had little
trouble with the weaker team,
beating them 9-0 in foil, 8-1 in
sabre and 5-4 in epee.
The men's team began the
tournament impressively as it
took touch after touch from
USF. All-American Elliot Cheu,
foil team captain, and Christop

her Gillen both remained unde
feated throughout the foil bouts,
leaving the Dons behind as they
fenced with skill and determina
tion.
Mark Stout and David Finkles
tein also performed well, bring
ing the men's foil match to an
end with style in an impressive
9-0 victory.
Men's and women's fencing
Coach Buzz Hurst said the men's
performance in foil was better
than he expected, but it was the
performance of his epee team
that was that really surprised
him.
Larry Murk, captain of the
epee team and former national
finalist, and his teammates,
Vince Bradshaw, Evan Reis and
Paul Endo, defeated USF in a
close 5-4 match. The bout was
even at 4-4 when the Cardinal's
Reis got ready for the deciding
bout. With the pressure on his
shoulders, Reis, the least expe
rienced member of the epee
team, came through with a
resounding victory that won the
match for Stanford.
The performance of the sabre
team — captain Andrew Goorno,
Stephen Levitan, Michael Cramer,
David Fishman and Drew Saunders
— capped off the match with an im
pressive 8-1 win.
Against a club team from San
Francisco State, Stanford's highly
ranked women's squad managed to
win a close match 9-7 thanks mainly
to the play of Jennifer Yu.
After the tournament, Hurst said
he was very disappointed in the
women's performance. "They
fenced seriously below their normal
level," he said. Hurst added that he
expected more from the women be
cause of their extensive fencing ex
perience.
The women "choked," Hurst
said, and he added that they didn't
take the San Francisco State match
seriously enough.
