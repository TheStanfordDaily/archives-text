# It Was Worth the Wait
## Julie Carmichael's first win was a big one 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
If the season ended right now, it
would've been a great one for
senior Julie Carmichael. But what
has got both the senior golfer and
women's golf Coach Tim Baldwin
excited is that the year in golf is
only just beginning.
On Sunday, Nov. 3, Carmichael
won the Stanford-Burger King
Women's Intercollegiate. The
tournament featured 90 golfers
representing 16 of the country's
finest amateur golf teams. Baldwin
said it was "probably the strongest
field" to be assembled in the

country so far this year.
So Carmichael's victory was no
small task. It was her first win as a
college player, but it didn't look like
it.
"She played so spectacularly that
no one was close to her," Baldwin
said.
And even though the triumph
was her first one in four years here,
Carmichael said it was "worth
waiting for. If I had to pick a tourna
ment to win, it would be this one."
It was Carmichael's first win, but
it came as no surprise to Baldwin.
"We've known all along that she has
the game and the ability," the coach

said. "She's always possessed the
great talent. And recently she's
worked very hard."
But in golf, talent and potential
aren't always enough. If a golfer
isn't able to stay mentally in control
over the long stretches of tourna
ments, which sometimes last three
days, talent alone won't get the job
done. Mental composure is an
elusive variable in the game of golf.
After a sophomore year in which
she was an All-Conference player
and boasted the second-lowest
average on the Cardinal squad, Car-
Michael had a "less than strong
junior year," Baldwin said.
It's hard to stay consistent, but
consistency is what Carmichael
thinks she may have found. "I really
feel confident. It was fun (the Stan
ford tournament). No matter what I
did, it seemed like nothing could go
wrong."
"Winning the first one is hard.
Hopefully consistency will come
from it."
If consistency does come from it,
Carmichael and her teammates will
reap the rewards of a successful
season. Forecasting Carmichael's
chances in next spring's NCAA
finals, Baldwin pulled no punches.
"If she played like she did (at the
Stanford tournament), she'd win
it,"he said.
And although golf is an individual
game, Baldwin still considers Car-

Michael a team leader. "She's the
most senior player on the team, and
we look to her for leadership," he
said.
Carmichael was a little more
modest. "Everybody (on the team)
is a leader. Being a senior, though,
there are a lot of things I can do to
help the team out. I like to consider
myself a leader."
Looking ahead, Carmichael plans
to just "keep practicing and thinking
positive." Stanford doesn't have an
other tournament until Jan. 25, and
for now Carmichael is content to
take the time to reinforce her posi
tive thoughts and to keep refining
her skills.
The length of the season, accord
ing to Carmichael, is the toughest
thing to overcome. "It's hard not to
get tired, and it's hard to miss
school," she said.
Carmichael is majoring in interna
tional relations, and despite her
tough schedule, she plans to
graduate in June.
