# Why was Florida AP's No. 1 Team?
## Cheaters Should Not Win 
### 
Fortunately their reign at the top lasted only
one week, but that the Florida Gators were even
considered the No. 1 team in the country is a
travesty.
The Gators are currently on NCAA probation
for a number of violations that approaches three
digits. They cannot appear on television, cannot
go to a bowl game and cannot win the Southeast
ern Conference title.
Why, then, did the Associated Press list them
as the No. J. team until Georgia mercifully ended
the prospect of a national champion on proba
tion? Some believe that journalistic objectivity
required overlooking NCAA sanctions to find the
best team in the country. Weak. Some believe
that cheating in college sports is inevitable and
acceptable. God, let's hope not.
Face it: Teams should not be rewarded for
cheating. The No. 1 team in the country should
be the best team that plays within the rules.
Awarding a national title to a team on probation
defeats the whole purpose behind the probation
— namely, that a team will not benefit by break
ing the rules.
Ever since lowa lost to Ohio State, Penn State
has been the best team in the nation that plays
within the rules. It shouldn't have taken an upset
win by Georgia to knock Florida from the top
spot.

The AP should take the same position as
United Press International and not allow teams
on probation to be ranked in its Top 20.
Eleven years ago, the AP awarded a national
title to an OkJahoma team on probation. That
should never be allowed to happen again.

A tragedy
Our condolences to the family, friends and
teammates of David Cichoke, the Santa Clara
University linebacker who died Monday from a
head injury suffered in the Broncos' game Satur
day.
Cichoke's death is a reminder of the risk in

volved in any contact sport and also a reminder
of how unimportant winning and losing are in the
broader scope of things.
The Broncos are to be commended for voting,
in a closed players meeting, to continue their
season despite the tragedy. "It's a chance for us
all to pay our respect to his family, and, basically,
it's a symbol to Dave of all the love we have for
him," Santa Clara co-captain John Faylor said.
Santa Clara is currently 8-1 and would win the
Western Football Conference with a victory Sat
urday night over Portland State. The Broncos
are also a likely recipient of an NCAA Division II
playoff berth should they win their final two
games.
The other extreme
Purists have decried the switching of college
football games from day to night, from Saturday
to Thursday, and from October to December.
Big-time football schools would play on Wednes
day at 3 a.m. if television so desired, they say.
Granted, switches like last week's night game
against Oregon State can prove to be incon
venient to watch, but they usually benefit all con
cerned without much problem — giving the
schools money, the networks a game and fans

without tickets a chance to watch.
So one must question the deci
sion by Amherst Coach Jim Osten
darp not to allow ESPN to broad
cast the 100 th game between Am
herst and Williams last weekend.
Though the money was small, the
schools would have gotten expo
sure, and the alumni of both col
leges would have had the opportu
nity to watch the historic game.
According to The Sporting
News, neither Williams nor the Am
herst alumni were particularly
pleased with Ostendarp's unilateral
decline.
Big Game Time
While the Cardinal will be fighting
for its life in Arizona this weekend,
the Golden Bears will be taking it
easy at home with a bye. That
means that when next week's Big
Game rolls around, Cal will be com
ing off of two weeks of rest. Just
food for thought.
