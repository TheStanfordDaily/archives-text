# Cy Young Goes To Gooden
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Soft-spoken but hard
throwing Dwight Gooden of the New York Mets
became the youngest player ever to win the Cy
Young award, receiving unanimous acclaim yes
terday as the best pitcher in the National League
last season.
Gooden, who turns 21 on Saturday, also
became the first pitcher to win Rookie of the
Year and Cy Young awards in successive
seasons. The right-hander had a record of 24-4
and led the National League in earned run
average, strikeouts, complete games and innings
pitched.
Gooden received 120 points, including all 24 of
the first-place votes cast by the Baseball Writers'
Association of America, becoming the seventh
pitcher to receive the award unanimously.
John Tudor of St. Louis, 21-8 during the
season, was second with 65 points, followed by

Orel Hershiser of Los Angeles with 17, Joaquin
Andujar of St. Louis with 6, Fernando Valen
zuela of Los Angeles with 4, Tom Browning of
Cincinnati with 3 and Jeff Reardon of Montreal
with 1.
The other unanimous winners were Sandy
Koufax in 1963, '65 and '66; Denny McLain in
1968; Bob Gibson in 1968; Steve Carlton in 1972
and '77; Ron Guidry in 1978, and Rick Sutcliffe in
1984.
Votes are cast by two members of the
BBWAA from each National League city with a
first-place vote counting five points, three points
for second and one point for third.
"I'm honored to have my name listed with the
other Cy Young winners," said Gooden. "So
much has happened to me in such a short period
of time — Rookie of the Year last year and now
this. Still, I would gladly trade both of these

awards for one World Series ring."
The award came to Gooden three days before
his 21st birthday, making him 13 days younger
than Valenzuela when the Dodgers southpaw
won his Cy Young Award in 1981. Valenzuela
was 10 days past his 21st birthday when he won
the award on Nov. 11 of that year.
While consistently down playing his own ac
complishments in relation to those of the team as
a whole, Gooden had the kind of season that
made him stand out from the rest.
His ERA of 1.53 was a team record, and he
led the league with 276 2-3 innings pitched, 268
strikeouts and 16 complete games. He also had
eight shutouts, second in the NL to Tudor s 10.
Gooden was the first pitcher since Sandy
Koufax in 1966 to lead the league in the pitching
triple crown categories of victories. ERA and
strikeouts.
