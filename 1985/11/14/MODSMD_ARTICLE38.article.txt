Envoy Seeks Hostage Release
BEIRUT, Lebanon — A special envoy sent by the archbishop of
Canterbury to negotiate the release of American hostages held by
Shiite Moslem extremists said last night that he saw a "real opportu
nity for a breakthrough."
"I see some hope," said the envoy, Terry Waite, who successfully
negotiated the release of Britons held in Iran and Libya.
"The fact that I'm here does indicate there's a possibility (of
freeing the hostages)," said Waite, who was ringed by Moslem
militiamen and airport security officials upon his arrival. "There is a
real opportunity for a breakthrough." '
Waite, a special adviser to Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie, the spiritual head of the Church of England, said after arriv
ing from London that he was "here on humanitarian grounds because
I want to see a resolution to this problem. ..."
Waite embarked on his latest mission after making contact with an
unidentified intermediary in Beirut over the Americans, who have
been missing between five and 10 months, and after receiving a con
fidential letter from four of the Americans believed held by Islamic
Jihad, or Islamic Holy War.
Italian Court Points To Abbas
GENOA, Italy — Italian judicial authorities investigating the
Achille Lauro hijacking have concluded that Palestinian leader
Mohammed Abbas was its mastermind, as U.S. authorities claimed,
judicial sources indicated yesterday.
These authorities unofficially confirmed reports that Abbas was
one of the 16 persons for whom the Genoa state prosecutor's office
has issued arrest warrants in connection with the ship hijacking and
killing of American passenger Leon Klinghoffer.
All 16, only five of whom are in Italian custody, have been charged
with cooperation in voluntary homicide, kidnapping, hijacking of a
ship and canying of arms and explosives. Italian authorities maintain
the 16 are members of Abbas' Palestine Liberation Front, a militant
faction of Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization.
Francesco Meloni, the assistant state prosecutor heading the in
vestigation, announced yesterday that the four actual hijackers and a
fifth Palestinian who helped bring their arms and explosives into Italy
would be tried Monday on the lesser arms possession and smuggling
charges, pending the completion of the investigation of the more
serious charges.
South Africa Releases Activists
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Five leading anti-apartheid
activists, detained without charge nearly four months ago when the
South African government imposed a state of emergency, were
released yesterday but were forbidden indefinitely to take part in any
political activity.
The government's action, taken under threat of lawsuits by the
men's families seeking their release, aroused immediate fears that
the minority white regime of President Pieter Botha was returning
to its widely denounced practice of "banning" its critics, silencing
them with unchallengeable police orders and imposing virtual house
arrest, with violations punishable by lengthy prison sentences.
Among those released was Rashid Saloojee, 52, one of the most
prominent opponents of apartheid and the Transvaal province presi
dent of the United Democratic Front and acting president of the
Transvaal Indian Congress. The others are four young whites active
in the Johannesburg Democratic Action Committee and other leftist
groups here.
Under the government's restrictions, the five are barred from
taking part in the activities of those and other anti-apartheid groups,
from attending political rallies, from involvement with any labor uni
ons, youth organizations or groups based in Johannesburg's black
townships, and from speaking publicly, writing for publication or
giving interviews to the press. They also are restricted to the Johan
nesburg magisterial district for the duration of the state of emer
gency, which began July 21.
Soviets Say U.S. Abused Sailor
MOSCOW — A Soviet newspaper charged yesterday that U.S. of
ficials "trampled on human rights" in the controversial New Orleans
incident involving sailor Miroslav Medvid.
Rather than jumping from a Soviet grain ship, as American officials
had contended, Medvid, 20, just slipped and fell overboard, the So
viet newspaper Trud also said.
Trud said that Medvid "lost his bearings for some time" but was
pulled from the water by a U.S. patrol boat. It did not report the
American claim that he jumped into the water a second time as Bor
der Patrol agents returned him to his ship or the assertion that he
struggled against going back.
The newspaper reported, however, that U.S. officials "went ber
serk" the next day, taking Medvid to a U.S. Coast Guard ship for
questioning and posting 11 police agents on the vessel for five days.
"The American authorities wanted to take our man away at all
costs, separating him from his fellow crew members, from his
comrades, to persuade him to betray his motherland," Trud said.
"The provocateurs achieved a big zero. . . . Our sailor is coming
home."
State Department officials said that they questioned Medvid and
he said that he did not want to defect. As a result, he.and his ship
were allowed to leave despite efforts by a Senate committee to stop
the vessel and summon the sailor for questioning.
Panels Pass Chinese Nuke Deal
WASHINGTON — Senate and House committees voted yester
day to approve President Reagan's long-delayed agreement to share
nuclear-power technology with China, but both panels blocked any
shipments by U.S. corporations until the president receives firmer
assurances that China won't divert material to countries trying to
build nuclear weapons.
In a strong rebuff to the Administration's handling of the nuclear
accord, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 11-3 to set
the new conditions. Hours later the House Foreign Affairs Commit
tee agreed to the same language on a voice vote.
White House and State Department officials worked until late
Tuesday to water down the conditions, according to one source. The
Administration has argued consistently that the agreement, which
was initialed by President Reagan during his 1984 trip to China, met
all legal requirements and non-proliferation concerns.
The resolution does not give Congress veto power over proposed
nuclear shipments, but Administration officials nonetheless fought
the restrictions because they set up a series of hurdles that could
make it more difficult for U.S. firms to compete for China's nuclear
business.

Under the government's restrictions, the five are barred from
taking part in the activities of those and other anti-apartheid groups,
from attending political rallies, from involvement with any labor uni

Soviets Say U.S. Abused Sailor
MOSCOW — A Soviet newspaper charged yesterday that U.S. of
ficials "trampled on human rights" in the controversial New Orleans
incident involving sailor Miroslav Medvid.
Rather than jumping from a Soviet grain ship, as American officials
had contended, Medvid, 20, just slipped and fell overboard, the So
viet newspaper Trud also said.
Trud said that Medvid "lost his bearings for some time" but was
pulled from the water by a U.S. patrol boat. It did not report the
American claim that he jumped into the water a second time as Bor
der Patrol agents returned him to his ship or the assertion that he
struggled against going back.
The newspaper reported, however, that U.S. officials "went ber
serk" the next day, taking Medvid to a U.S. Coast Guard ship for
questioning and posting 11 police agents on the vessel for five days.
"The American authorities wanted to take our man away at all
costs, separating him from his fellow crew members, from his
comrades, to persuade him to betray his motherland," Trud said.
"The provocateurs achieved a big zero. . . . Our sailor is coming
home."
State Department officials said that they questioned Medvid and
he said that he did not want to defect. As a result, he.and his ship
were allowed to leave despite efforts by a Senate committee to stop
the vessel and summon the sailor for questioning.
Panels Pass Chinese Nuke Deal
WASHINGTON — Senate and House committees voted yester
day to approve President Reagan's long-delayed agreement to share
nuclear-power technology with China, but both panels blocked any
shipments by U.S. corporations until the president receives firmer
assurances that China won't divert material to countries trying to
build nuclear weapons.
In a strong rebuff to the Administration's handling of the nuclear
accord, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 11-3 to set
the new conditions. Hours later the House Foreign Affairs Commit
tee agreed to the same language on a voice vote.
White House and State Department officials worked until late
Tuesday to water down the conditions, according to one source. The
Administration has argued consistently that the agreement, which
was initialed by President Reagan during his 1984 trip to China, met
all legal requirements and non-proliferation concerns.
The resolution does not give Congress veto power over proposed
nuclear shipments, but Administration officials nonetheless fought
the restrictions because they set up a series of hurdles that could
make it more difficult for U.S. firms to compete for China's nuclear
business.
Envoy Seeks Hostage Release
BEIRUT, Lebanon — A special envoy sent by the archbishop of
Canterbury to negotiate the release of American hostages held by
Shiite Moslem extremists said last night that he saw a "real opportu
nity for a breakthrough."
"I see some hope," said the envoy, Terry Waite, who successfully
negotiated the release of Britons held in Iran and Libya.
"The fact that I'm here does indicate there's a possibility (of
freeing the hostages)," said Waite, who was ringed by Moslem
militiamen and airport security officials upon his arrival. "There is a
real opportunity for a breakthrough." '
Waite, a special adviser to Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie, the spiritual head of the Church of England, said after arriv
ing from London that he was "here on humanitarian grounds because
I want to see a resolution to this problem. ..."
Waite embarked on his latest mission after making contact with an
unidentified intermediary in Beirut over the Americans, who have
been missing between five and 10 months, and after receiving a con
fidential letter from four of the Americans believed held by Islamic
Jihad, or Islamic Holy War.
Italian Court Points To Abbas
GENOA, Italy — Italian judicial authorities investigating the
Achille Lauro hijacking have concluded that Palestinian leader
Mohammed Abbas was its mastermind, as U.S. authorities claimed,
judicial sources indicated yesterday.
These authorities unofficially confirmed reports that Abbas was
one of the 16 persons for whom the Genoa state prosecutor's office
has issued arrest warrants in connection with the ship hijacking and
killing of American passenger Leon Klinghoffer.
All 16, only five of whom are in Italian custody, have been charged
with cooperation in voluntary homicide, kidnapping, hijacking of a
ship and canying of arms and explosives. Italian authorities maintain
the 16 are members of Abbas' Palestine Liberation Front, a militant
faction of Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization.
Francesco Meloni, the assistant state prosecutor heading the in
vestigation, announced yesterday that the four actual hijackers and a
fifth Palestinian who helped bring their arms and explosives into Italy
would be tried Monday on the lesser arms possession and smuggling
charges, pending the completion of the investigation of the more
serious charges.
South Africa Releases Activists
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Five leading anti-apartheid
activists, detained without charge nearly four months ago when the
South African government imposed a state of emergency, were
released yesterday but were forbidden indefinitely to take part in any
political activity.
The government's action, taken under threat of lawsuits by the
men's families seeking their release, aroused immediate fears that
the minority white regime of President Pieter Botha was returning
to its widely denounced practice of "banning" its critics, silencing
them with unchallengeable police orders and imposing virtual house
arrest, with violations punishable by lengthy prison sentences.
Among those released was Rashid Saloojee, 52, one of the most
prominent opponents of apartheid and the Transvaal province presi
dent of the United Democratic Front and acting president of the
Transvaal Indian Congress. The others are four young whites active
in the Johannesburg Democratic Action Committee and other leftist
groups here.
Under the government's restrictions, the five are barred from
taking part in the activities of those and other anti-apartheid groups,
from attending political rallies, from involvement with any labor uni
ons, youth organizations or groups based in Johannesburg's black
townships, and from speaking publicly, writing for publication or
giving interviews to the press. They also are restricted to the Johan
