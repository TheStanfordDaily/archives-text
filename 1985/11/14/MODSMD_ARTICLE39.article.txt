# Israeli coalition expected to fall
## Peres Fires Sharon in Government Clash 
### 
JERUSALEM â€” Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres last night
announced that he was firing his
controversial trade minister, Ariel
Sharon, precipitating a Cabinet
crisis that is expected to bring
down the 14-month-old national
unity government.
Following a series of bitter at
tacks by Sharon against Peres' ini
tiative for direct Israeli-Jordanian
peace talks, the prime minister was
reported to have read to Sharon a
dismissal letter at an emergency
meeting of the Cabinet. Sharon's
rightist Likud faction in the coalition
refused to accept the dismissal,
triggering the most serious crisis
since the coalition government was
formed in September 1984.
Sharon, one of the most charis
matic and controversial political fig
ures in Israeli military and political
life since Israel gained indepen
dence 37 years ago, was reported
to be preparing a new challenge to
Peres' leadership following the con
frontation.
Israeli parliamentary law re
quires that Sharon's dismissal can

not take effect for 48 hours, during
which time Peres' Labor Alignment
and its Likud faction partner in the
fragile coalition government could
find a way out of the impasse.
Sharon had earlier submitted to
Peres a letter of apology for his
public remarks against the prime
minister, professing no intention to
"directly insult" Peres.
Peres rejected the apology and
insisted that Sharon leave the gov
ernment. Sharon, who was defense
minister in the government of
former Prime Minister Menachem
Begin, was architect of the 1982 in
vasion of Lebanon.
Peres' Labor Alignment last
night was seeking to put together a
narrow-based coalition government
to replace the broad national unity
government, possibly with the as
sistance of small religious parties
and left-wing factions that have
been generally supportive of Peres'
foreign policy.
The right-wing Likud faction
scheduled meetings today to decide
whether to formally walk out of the
coalition.

Before Sharon issued his apol
ogy, sources close to Peres said
that if the Likud walked out of the
government, the prime minister
was prepared to continue in the
leadership with a narrow-based
coalition of Labor and several small
parties.
Without the Likud's 41 seats in
Israel's 120-member parliament,
the Labor Alignment and the

remaining coalition partners would
have only 56 seats, five short of the
simple majority needed to survive a
no-confidence vote, assuming that
Peres would be successful in win
ning the religious parties to his
side.
Coupled with either support or
abstentions by the three legislators
of the Citizens Rights Movement
and the six members of the leftist
Mapam Party, Peres might be able
to continue in power with such a
narrow coalition, Labor Party
strategists said.
The dispute began Monday when
Sharon, in Haifa, issued a
vituperative attack on Peres, ac
cusing the prime minister of
"unequalled cynicism" and "base
craftiness" in conducting secret
peace negotiations without consult
ing his Cabinet.
He was referring to reports,
denied by Peres but widely ac
cepted as factual throughout the
parliament, or Knesset, that the
prime minister met secretly with
Jordan's King Hussein in Europe
last month.
