# Big Game Will Be Alcohol-Free
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Staff writer 
Stanford students will be expected to play by the
rules at Big Game festivities this year, and that means
no alcohol at the rally and staying off the field after Big
Game.
Alcohol consumption will not be permitted on the
buses going to the Nov. 22 rally in San Francisco, ac
cording to a memo released Oct. 22 by the Stanford
Axe Committee. "This (restriction) seems harsh, but it
is THE primary stipulation given to us by the (San
Francisco) Police Department," the memo said.
The San Francisco police "know, and we know that
there is no way they can enforce that rule," said Larry
Watson, director of the rally. "But they want students
to be responsible. What the city's looking for is to keep
the students in line," he said.
In accordance with city ordinances, open containers
of alcoholic beverages will not be allowed, and police
will arrest anyone possessing them, according to the
memo. "It's against the law to drink in public," San
Francisco police officer Linda Wittcop said. "So we're
not asking anything of [the students] that we wouldn't
ask of the general public."
"If a student is arrested on the parade route, it is a
jailable offense," Watson said. "If he is arrested in

Aquatic Park (the site for the rally), it is a federal of
fense, and he won't be out until Monday (after the Nov.
23 game). . . . But we've never had anyone arrested,"
he said.
In 1983, Stanford Band representatives and the San
Francisco Police Department officially cooperated for
the first time in tightening security during the rally.
The stricter policies were in response to an accident
during the 1982 rally when a driver panicked and ac
celerated into a crowd of six students, injuring six.
Four of them were taken to a San Francisco hospital.
The 1983 rules, which will be followed this year, in
clude orange-vested student rally monitors who act as
liaisons between students and the police.
The Axe Committee has arranged for more than 100
monitors, who will wear green painter's caps, to deter
unsafe behavior among the 5,000 revelers expected for
next week's rally. If there is a complication, they will
"step aside and let the police take care of it," Watson
said.
Simple law enforcement will also be the rule at this
year's Big Game, where students will not be allowed
onto the field. "It's the same policy for any game,"
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington said.
The major problem at the Big Game is when stu
dents throw objects such as fruit or water balloons at
the UC-Berkeley band, according
to Herrington. "I hope people think
twice. It's dangerous when they
use slingshots." he said.
Alcohol is as much a problem at
the game as at the rally.

"'A lot of people drink," Her
rington said. "Ninety-thousand
people in one spot and alcohol
equals some problems. . . . But
over the years, the crowds have
not been too bad."
"We hope that people come and
have a good time and enjoy the
game but not hurt each other,"
Herrington said.
