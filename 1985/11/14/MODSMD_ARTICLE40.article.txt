## New Soviet Offer Proposes ICBM Cuts 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” In the secret diplomacy
leading up to next week's summit meeting, the
Soviet Union has proposed that each nuclear su
perpower quickly reduce its land-based intercon
tinental missiles by 200 to 300 to demonstrate
their good faith in the arms negotiations, Admin
istration officials said yesterday.
While the United States has neither rejected
nor accepted this Soviet offer, some Administra
tion officials have described it as an attempt to
put the United States on the defensive at little
cost to Soviet military strength.
U.S. negotiators have so far been unable to
learn the details of the cutback the Soviets pro
posed, officials said. If it applies to all types of
land-based intercontinental missiles without
restriction, they said, the Soviets could simply
eliminate 200 or 300 of their oldest and least
effective missiles, which would have been

retired four years ago if the SALT 2 treaty,
signed in 1979, had ever been ratified. But the
United States might have to make most of its
cutback from its active Minuteman missile force,
the backbone of the U.S. land-based deterrent.
There is speculation in some quarters here
that the Soviet proposal for this immediate re
duction in missiles could be unveiled next week
as a propaganda ploy when President Reagan
meets Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in
Geneva.
At the White House yesterday, a senior Ad
ministration official told reporters that the sum
mit meeting would not produce any immediate
results in the field of arms control. Rather, he
said, "the president believes that results in arms
control will only be expressed in the months that
follow" the summit and in the subsequent pace of
superpower negotiations in Geneva. The summit

may produce a "joint commitment to accelerate
progress" at the bargaining table, he added.
The senior Administration official who briefed
reporters at the White House yesterday said
Reagan intends to propose expanded contacts in
cultural and other areas with the Soviets in a na
tionally televised address tonight about the sum
mit.
At a news conference yesterday, House Dem
ocratic leaders declared strong support for
Reagan at the summit and urged him to reach
agreement with Gorbachev on a broad array of
issues, from nuclear disarmament to human
rights. The Democrats also predicted that
Reagan would score some significant successes
in the meetings.
Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.)
pledged "a bipartisan willingness to implement
any agreement" reached in Geneva.
