House OKs Extension
WASHINGTON — The House yesterday
approved a one-month, $80 billion extension of
the government's debt ceiling to avert financial
default tomorrow and to allow more time for
Congress to reach a compromise on balanced
budget legislation.
The debt measure was pending last night in
the Senate, where Republican leaders were
meeting to decide whether to go ahead with a
stop-gap extension. Majority Leader Robert
Dole (R-Kan.) held off immediate action to put
pressure on House-Senate conferees to
negotiate a budget compromise within the next
two days.
The conferees met for most of the afternoon
and reported progress but no agreement. At
issue are conflicting versions of legislation to
force a balanced budget over the next four or
five years by requiring spending cutbacks if
fixed deficit targets are not met. The vital debt
ceiling extension has been attached to the
budget measure in a political attempt to force
Congress to address the deficit issue.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes
reiterated that President Reagan "does not
want a short-term extension" of the debt
ceiling but declined to say whether Reagan
would veto one.
The bill would give the government author
ity to borrow an additional $80 billion, allowing
the government to increase its debt from the
current level of $1.82 trillion to $1.9 trillion.
That additional money will only take the gov

ernment to Dec. 13, when another debt limit
extension, either long term or short term,
would be needed to avoid default.
New AIDS Guidelines
WASHINGTON — The Department of
Health and Human Services is expected to an
nounce new national guidelines today on ac
quired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in
the workplace that generally recommend
against routine screening to see who may be
infected with the virus and against employ
ment restrictions on individuals known to be
infected.
The guidelines counter controversial
proposals by legislators in several states and
the Congress to test certain groups of
workers, such as food handlers, teachers and
health-care workers, and impose restrictions
on those found to be AIDS carriers.
The new workplace guidelines emphasize
that "AIDS is a blood-borne, sexually transmit
ted disease that is not spread by casual con
tact." They "do not recommend routine
(AIDS) antibody screening" for workers in
general, according to a document being
readied for final printing yesterday.
The government guidelines say that health
care workers who are known to be infected
with the AIDS virus generally need not be
restricted from work on this basis because
there is "no evidence" that the virus would be
transmitted to patients under most circum
stances.

Water Projects Pass
WASHINGTON — The House, shrugging
off a White House veto threat, voted over
whelmingly yesterday to authorize nearly 400
water projects costing an estimated $20 bil
lion.
The massive bill, the first major revamping
of water resources policy in 15 years, would
authorize lock, dam, port, flood control and
other projects in hundreds of congressional
districts. It was approved by a vote of 358-60.
A key element of the legislation would sub
stantially increase the non-federal share of the
cost of new Army Corps of Engineers flood
control and navigation projects. The bill also
would establish a program for the repair of
unsafe non-federal dams and deauthorize more
than 300 unbuilt corps projects.
The Reagan Administration has stiffly
protested that the measure is much too expen
sive, authorizes numerous projects of dubious
value.
Market Closes Lower
NEW YORK — Stock prices posted some
modest losses yesterday as traders cashed in
on gains from the market's recent rise to
record highs.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
dropped back 5.85 points to 1,427.75. Volume
on the New York Stock Exchange came to
109.69 million shares.
