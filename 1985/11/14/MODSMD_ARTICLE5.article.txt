# Condos Cause Complaints
## 
### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
Complaining that their condominiums were
defectively constructed, residents of the housing
complex built in 1972 by Stanford have filed suit
against both the University and the project's
developers.
Poor construction of the 82 Pearce Mitchell con
dominuims has caused water leaks, dry rot and
termite infestation, the residents charge in their
suit, which was filed in Santa Clara County Superior
Court on Oct. 30.
The condominiums are located across the street
from Grove-Lasuen and are bordered by Mayfield
Avenue, Campus Drive East, and Salvatierra
Street.
The Pearce Mitchell House Owners' Association
is asking for the cost of fully repairing the homes,
which includes tearing down walls and fixing roofs,
homeowners' attorney Mark Scott Collins told the
San Jose Mercury News. The suit, which names
Stanford, architects Wong & Brocchini, consulting
engineers Brian-Kangas-Foulk & Associates and
the building contractor, Wheatley Associates, also

asks for court expenses and damages.
Residents, including current and retired faculty
members, own the condominiums but lease the land
on which they're built from the University.
Stanford has not been served with the complaint,
according to Lee Thompson, associate staff counsel
for the University. "That's the extent of my knowl
edge" regarding the suit, he said.
"There has been ongoing discussion" between
the University and the association, Thompson said,
explaining that residents have complained of water
damage and poor drainage. Thompson said he hopes
the suit "will not mean discussion will be stopped."
Admitting a "difference of opinion" with the asso
ciation concerning responsibility for the damage,
Thompson said that Stanford is not liable. There is
not enough information to know where to put the
blame, he said. "It could be the materials, the con
tractors, who knows?"
The University has made a "good faith attempt"
to repair the units over the past 10 years, but it has
been unable to correct the problems, Collins told
the Mercury News.
The residents filed suit because the statute of
limitations on latent defective construction is about
to run out, he said.
