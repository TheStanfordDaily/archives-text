# Dress Yourself Up With Thrift
## 
### LAIE CAINDEC Staff writer 
The dust may gather, the tarnish may build.
But the merchandise itself does not seem to
change.
Items most frequently found in thrift shops are
typically racks of clothes whose wearer for the
last year was the bedroom closet and aging,
cloth-covered couches that darken a shade each
time one returns to the shop.
Thrift shops are particularly popular around
Halloween, and costume season is precisely
when Stanford students frequent the second
hand franchises in Palo AJto.
Myrna Smith, a provisional volunteer for a
Palo Alto thrift store, The Turnabout Shop, said
that during Halloween, "People come through
here and dig through the racks and find some
thing bizarre."
But, she added, virtually anything could be
found at the store at 2335 El Camino Real.
Although this shop's customers are most often
elderly, Smith said that other customers are
"people who just like to come and find goodies,"
which they do by searching through two floors of
clothing and housewares.
Smith said that all revenues from Turnabout

are donated to charity for recrea
tion and day-care centers for the
elderly. "Money is well-spent at
the Turnabout Shop," she said.
Another Palo Alto shop, the
Quality Thrift Store, has enjoyed
13 years of business and is
situated on California Avenue.
The name promises good mer
chandise. "We don't have any
rags, you know," said Virgil
Downs, the shop's manager.
He said that students who come
into his store usually get a better
deal than other customers. Prices
range anywhere from $2 to $40,
according to Downs.
Quality Thrift seems to attract
quite a few Stanford students,
who "come in for anything,"
Downs said, although he added,
"We sold a lot of odd stuff for Hal
loween. "
If, after rummaging through
these stores, one still hasn't found
the bargain that is sought, there is
yet another shop in Palo Alto
which will attend to the needs of
the bargain hunter.
According to Lois Thorup, co
marking chairman, the Nearly
New Shop, at Alma Street in Palo
Alto, features "all sorts of bric-a
brac. "
Its items are priced very inex
pensively as well, she said. Shirts
are usually about $3, "or if it's
seen some years, it could be $1,"
Thorup said.
The store, unlike many other
thrift shops in Palo Alto, is run by
a non-profit women's organiza
tion, called the Philanthropic Edu
cational Organization (PEO),
which sponsors older women who
wish to further their educations
late in life.
Thorup said that all of the mer
chandise sold by the Nearly New
Shop has been donated by organi
zation members.

The store features such unique
opportunities as a "Grocery Bag
Sale," where customers bring
their own grocery bags and pay
only $5 for everything that can fit
in the bag.
"I think our prices are really
terrific, and why, when it's half
price, it's fantastic," Thorup said.
"Students will find anything they
want in here, I'm sure, if they
keep coming back."
Although the elderly are the
main clientele of Palo Alto thrift
stores, there is one store which
found that most of its shoppers
are students or student-aged.
Hazel's, as it is called, is found
just off University Avenue on
Cowper.

Lorie Dillow, an accountant at
the five-month old franchise, said
the reason most of their custom
ers are students is that their
prices are a little higher. Shirts
run at about $4 instead of $2.
The store has a special collec
tion of antique dresses on con
signment that run at about $40 per
dress, and also has new and old
jewelry collections specially
delivered to the store each week,
she said.
"You wouldn't be able to find
some of these things anywhere
else. It's unique and different,"
Dillow said.
"It's definitely an alternative to
Macy's," she added.
