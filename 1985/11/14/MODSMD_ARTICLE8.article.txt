# Is the University Repressive?

Does academic freedom flourish at Stanford?
Les Csorba, executive director of Accuracy in
Academia (AIA) told a crowd of 150 at Kresge
Auditorium last night that the answer is "no."
In a debate with Political Science Prof. John
Manley, Csorba defended AlA's attempts to
"promote objectivity in the classroom," while
charging Manley — whose position is that AIA
represents "a threat to academic freedom" —
with employing McCarthyist tactics in his
criticisms of the Washington D.C.-based organi
zation.
AIA, founded late this summer, has proposed
combating "brainwashing" of college students
across the nation by monitoring classes that the
organization, tagged a "conservative watchdog

group" by The Washington Post, feels may be
presenting a biased view to unknowledgable stu
dents. Information regarding "problem courses"
is supplied by student volunteers, Csorba ex
plained.
Csorba also criticized Stanford as being
academically repressive, pointing specifically at
the University's alleged antagonism toward the
Hoover Institution (including the cancellation last
summer of a course taught by Adm. James
Stockdale, a Hoover senior fellow) as well as
Stanford's expulsion of anthropology doctoral
candidate Steven Mosher for alleged misconduct
while doing research in China.
Csorba said that professors must not be
allowed to "vent grievances in the classroom,"
quoting one non-Stanford Marxist professor as
saying that the "goal of Marxist professors is to
cause a revolution."
AIA is for academic, and not ideological,
purposes, Csorba said.

Manley, while acknowledging that "professors
say a lot of outrageous things," denied that
courses must necessarily be strictly objective.
"What are professors to do if they hold strong
opinions about their subject matter?" Manley
asked. "What's wrong with a professor who,
after years of study, comes to some conclu
sions?"
Manley charged that AIA is "(only) concerned
about professors with whom they disagree."
Csorba replied to Manley's comment by
stating that any professor, regardless of political
affiliation, may be subject to monitoring, but ad
mitted that of professors thus far investigated by
AIA, only one has been deemed conservative.
Csorba said that one explanation was that left
wing professors had generated more complaints
than those with right-wing affiliations, adding
