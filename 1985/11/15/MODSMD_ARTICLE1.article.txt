# Nicaraguan Ambassador Rips U.S. Intervention
## 
### DAVID EMERSON Staff writer 
Nicaragua can and will never be a threat
to the national security of the United
States, the Nicaraguan ambassador to this
country said here last night.
Speaking to a crowd of nearly 100 in
Terman Auditorium, Carlos Tunnermann
said, "The United States dislikes
(Nicaragua) because we dare to pursue an
independent foreign policy. To us, this
policy of non-alignment is not only a mat
ter of principle, it is in fact essential to our
survival.
"The struggle in Nicaragua and other
Latin American countries is not part of a
larger East-West confrontation, and any
attempt to treat it as such only prolongs
the pain and suffering," Tunnerman said.
"The people and government of Nicaragua
are prepared to make any sacrifice to
preserve their freedom and indepen
dence."
Asserting that Nicaraguans are faced
with "the hostility of a U.S. Administra
tion which refuses to accept the fact of the
(1979) Nicaraguan revolution," Tunner
mann said the Sandinista government

no way an enemy of the United States.
In contrast, the ambassador said the
U.S.-backed contra insurgency is "a ter
rorist organization made up of members of
(former Nicaraguan ruler Anastasio)
Somoza's national guard." He blamed the
contras for the deaths of more than 3,000
Nicaraguans.
"The approval of assistance to the con
tras under the euphemism of
'humanitarian aid' is in fact logistical sup
port for a terrorist organization and a
major step down the road [toward] U.S.
intervention," he said.
According to Tunnermann, "The
original justification for the policy of ag
gression against Nicaragua was the al
leged flow of arms to El Salvador. He said
that although his country "sympathizes"
with the "struggle of the people of El Sal
vador," no material aid has passed from
Nicaragua to El Salvador since before Jan.
1, 1981.
Tunnermann also assailed the U.S.
decision to deny the jurisdiction of the In
ternational Court of Justice, or World
Court, regarding the alleged mining of
Nicaraguan harbors by the Central Intelli
gence Agency last year.
"We will abide by the decision of the

World Court, whatever it may be," Tun
nerman said.
Earlier this year, the United States
served notice that it would abstain from
the World Court proceedings.
Nicaragua expects the court to rule on
its claims against the United States by
early next year, he said.
