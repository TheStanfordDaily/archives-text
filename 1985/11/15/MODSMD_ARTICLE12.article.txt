# Prof. Claims Human Error Threatens Nuclear Stability

### LARRY WEBER 
Human error is the biggest
threat to the successful monitoring
of the world's nuclear arsenal, a co
founder of the International
Physicians for the Prevention of
Nuclear War said in a speech to the
Stanford community last night.
"It is essential to examine per
sonnel reliability in the handling of
nuclear weapons," said Radiology
Prof. Herbert Abrams, whose
group won the Nobel Peace Prize
this year.
The prevalence of drug and alco
hol abuse and on-the-job stress has
led the military's Personnel
Reliability Program (PRP) to
"decertify" more than 40,000
people authorized to be directly in
volved in nuclear operations over
the past 10 years, Abrams said.
"The screening process implies
that at any one time, there are
many unstable individuals with day
to-day responsibilities handling our
nuclear weapons."

According to Abrams, the PRP is
too dependent upon the psychologi
cal and medical records of its
employees to effectively evaluate
their stability.
"Systematic monitoring should
be established, and additional re
search on human reliability factors
should be undertaken," Abrams
said.
The process of keeping accurate
tabs on the people in missile silos
and nuclear submarines is hindered
by the designation of authority to
those who are not necessarily
trained in medical analysis, Abrams
said.
"The ultimate decision of
whether or not someone is a risk
lies not with the physician, but with
the commanding officer," Abrams
lamented.
Furthermore, commanding offi
cers are just as vulnerable to
wrongful actions, Abrams said, il
lustrating his point with a hypotheti
cal scenario in which a submarine
captain launches a missile without
authorization.

While people who must sit in
missile silos can become bored and
detached, miscalculations are less
likely to occur in peacetime than
during crises, Abrams said.
"Human error is far less critical
in times of tranquility than in times
of crisis when tensions are high and
times to make decisions are short,
when paranoias and misunderstand
ings assume a different significance
and can cause irrevocable actions in
grave dimensions for all of us."
Abrams reminded the audience
that there are two participants in
the arms race.
"It is appropriate to ask, 'Does
the Soviet Union have similar prob
lems?' "
Although he said there is a lack of
"objective and quantitative data"
coming out of the Soviet Union, he
cited alcohol and drug abuse among
Soviet troops in Afghanistan as an
indication of probable instability in
Soviet nuclear personnel.
Abrams is the national chairman
of the Physicians for Social Respon
sibility.
