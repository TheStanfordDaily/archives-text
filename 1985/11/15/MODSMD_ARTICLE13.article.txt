# Grad Student Produces AIDS Film

A Stanford doctoral candidate has produced what
is believed to be the first documentary on the life
and death of an AIDS victim.
The film is designed to show the "human realities
of the disease by personalizing the experience," said
Tina DiFeliciantonio, who is making the documen
tary as her doctoral thesis in Stanford's Documen
tary Film Program.
Footage from the 28-minute film, entitled "Living
With AIDS," was shown last night in McClatchy
Hall.
The subject of the film is Todd Coleman, a 22-
year-old homosexual resident of San Francisco who
dedicated the "last days" of his life to the making of
the film, DiFeliciantonio said. The film views
everyday events of Coleman's life and includes in
terviews with his health care workers, friends, fam
ily and lover.
Coleman volunteered for the documentary proj
ect through AIDS Hospice, an AIDS-related service
organization in San Francisco. "When I saw him, I
knew he was the right guy," said DiFeliciantonio.
DiFeliciantonio said she met Coleman on June 27,
1985, one year after he had been diagnosed as
having AIDS, or Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome. He died six weeks later.
DiFeliciantonio said she was first inspired to do
the project in January when she saw a television

feature about an artist who had AIDS and was ex
pressing how his art was changing as a result of the
disease. "I wanted to know more," she said.
DiFeliciantonio said that San Francisco is a
model for how other cities can deal with AIDS. The
film demonstrates some of the programs that exist
for AIDS victims like AIDS Hospice, the AIDS
Foundation and the Shanti Project, an organization
originally designed to care for the ill in general. In
contrast, "New York is a mess and there are twice
as many people with AIDS there," she said.
Coleman lived in a government-subsidized Shanti
apartment with other AIDS victims. It is "a pretty
powerful experience knowing your roommates are
dying," said DiFeliciantonio.
Roland Van Gaalen, spokesperson for the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford, said the film is
"something that should be shown in Memorial
Auditorium and that everybody at Stanford should
see it."
Future distribution of the film will be directed
toward health care audiences as well as the general
public, which DiFeliciantonio said has "a lot to learn"
from the AIDS victim.
The project has been very expensive and is run
ning a large deficit, DiFeliciantonio said. Despite
several donations, DiFeliciantonio estimates she will
need an additional $15,000 to complete the project.
DiFeliciantonio hopes to finish the film by March,
adding that she could conceivably complete the
works by January given significantly higher funding.
