# THE 						STANFORD DAILY
## An Independent Newspaper Communique Needed 
### 
Unfortunately, it appears that next week's two
day meeting in Geneva, Switzerland will be the first
U.S.-Soviet summit since 1960 to end without the
release of a final communique summarizing the
talks.
That the only agreement President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev could reach prior to
the summit was not to compose a joint statement
sets a damaging precedent that seems to doom the
meeting before it begins. The brevity and antagonis
tic stance assumed by both leaders serves only to
exacerbate the situation.
According to Robert McFarlane, Reagan's na
tional security adviser, releasing a final communique
would only be "pandering to the press."
"These two countries are starting something,"
McFarlane said. "They are not finishing something.
You can say you are starting something, but that

would not be much of a communique."
Yet that is exactly what communiques have tradi
tionally been: a synopsis of what came up for discus
sion during summit talks and an outline of both sides'
positions on key issues â€” not a statement of unified
outlook.
The time for pre-summit tough talk has ended.
No one realistically expects either side to back down
on issues of importance, such as arms control or
regional spheres of influence. But to refuse, more
than a week in advance, to release a joint statement
on the outcome of the summit casts serious doubt
on the openness with which Reagan and Gorbachev
are approaching Geneva.
An open exchange of ideas followed by a final
communique is the least that can be expected of
such a critical meeting. If the trip is only for
propaganda, both sides might as well stay home.
