## Student Activism Still Alive and Healthy 
### 
What has happened to the 1,000 people
marching down to University President Donald
Kennedy's office chanting "Divest Now?" Where
are the headlines about anti-apartheid protest?
Why aren't America's campuses awash in protest
as they were last spring?
As I flew to New York two weeks ago for the
National Student Anti-Apartheid Conference, I
thought about these questions because I knew
that they were on the minds of many people.
After spending the weekend with 450 student
activists from more than 100 colleges, I am
pleased to report that the architects of the stu
dent movement are hard at work.
The students assembled in New York had a
clear analysis of the nature of the struggle in
southern Africa, a sophisticated understanding
of the enemies of the anti-apartheid movement in
this country, and a long-term commitment to the
fight for social change.
The student movement is definitely maturing.
People have come to understand that the conflict
in South Africa is not a non-violent movement for
equality. The students at the conference
recognized that the fight of South Africans is a
revolutionary struggle to overthrow the govern
ment and win self-determination for the black
majority. This was evidenced by the loud and
long standing ovations given to the representa
tives of the African National Congress (ANC)
and the South West African People's Organiza
tion (SWAPO).
It was clear that we had not come to New
York to express our personal moral outrage at
apartheid. We were there to offer our solidarity
to the liberation movements and to see what as
sistance we could offer.
Of particular interest at the conference were
the criticisms raised about universities and
boards of trustees. One student from Columbia
University said, "It was no great revelation to
me to find that the university was not my friend,
but some people were pretty upset." Another
student noted that one-third of the people on her
school's board of trustees were vice-presidents
of multinational corporations. People repeatedly
remarked that the trustees were, in most cases,
the very people who ran society and were more
concerned with perpetuating the status quo than

pursuing justice. Everybody agreed that the
trustees would not be induced to divest by moral
persuasion. Most people felt that divestment will
only come as a result of mass pressure.
The primary issue on the minds of the ac
tivists was how to link the anti-apartheid move
ment to the struggle against racism at home. A
representative of United People of Color (UPC)
at UC-Berkeley said that the movement must
support the struggles of black students on

campus. Rather than wondering why black stu
dents aren't participating, students should be
trying to understand the difficulties black stu
dents face in trying to get through school at
predominantly white institutions. He said that it
was not enough to have a few black students in
the anti-apartheid organizations, but rather
those organizations must follow the leadership of
black student organizations.

People have come to un
derstand that the conflict
in South Africa is not a
non-violent movement for
equality.

An example of the implementation of the ad
vice of the UPC student is the Black Student
Union (BSU) rally at Stanford demanding justice
for senior Robby Perkins and an end to police
brutality. The campus anti-apartheid movement
followed the leadership of the BSU and sup

ported and mobilized people for that rally. A
week after the conference, I saw UPC put its
own advice into action. UPC had led a takeover
of Berkeley's Sproul Hall. During the sit-in, the
demonstrators took a traditional divestment
chant and changed it to "What do we want? Eth
nic Studies! When do we want it? Now!"
In talking about struggling against racism at
home at the conference, we began to see that
we were talking about making serious changes in
the nature of American society. What kind of so
ciety opposes affirmative action, persecutes
people trying to register to vote in the black-belt
South, and tries to abolish bilingualism? What
kind of country selects for president a man who
just 20 years ago went on record against the
Voting Rights Act, against the Civil Rights Bill,
and against fair housing efforts? Somebody
remarked how foreign policy is merely an exten
sion of domestic policy, and that a society that
tolerated the Ku Klux Klan and racism at home
would surely have no problems supporting apart
heid.
It is becoming increasingly evident to the stu
dent movement that the best way to help the
black people of southern Africa is to change our
own society, which oppresses black people at
home and around the world.
While the demonstrations are not as big as in
the spring, the student movement is not dead.
Out of the spring upsurge has come a large core
of activists committed to the long-term struggle
for social change. They are building a firm foun
dation for the movement by helping people
develop a high level of understanding about the
prevalant issues. When the movement takes off
again, it will be more organized and sophisticated
and better able to put pressure effectively on the
intransigent keepers of the status quo.
In a lot of ways, the movement here takes its
lead from the struggle in South Africa. In both
situations, the level of the struggle will go up and
down. It's sort of like the waves of the ocean
which come into the beach, go back out, and
then come in again a little farther. This process
will go on for a while; but one day, the ocean will
come in as a tidal wave.
