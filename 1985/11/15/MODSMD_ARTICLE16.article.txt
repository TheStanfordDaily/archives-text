# MARY ROSE
## Kennedy's 'Nerve' 
### 
Donald Kennedy, you never
cease to amaze me. I say this in
response to the fact that University
President Kennedy would have the
nerve to speak about "The Tradi
tion of Student Activism at Stan
ford" on Nov. 11.
Mr. Kennedy stated that, . .
occasional acts of civil disobedience
with the accepted consequences
are often necessary . . . and deeply
persuasive." I find it difficult to

VIEWPOINT

believe that this would come out of
one side of his mouth when The
Daily reports President Kennedy as
having "repeatedly stated that civil
disobedience will have no effect in
bringing about the University's di
vestment of South Africa-related
stock" (The Daily, Oct. 17). The 48
arrests which occurred during
three sit-ins at Old Union do not ap
pear to be "persuasive" at all to Mr.
Kennedy. Aside from one speech to
the Black Student Union, he has
refused to engage in any sort of ra
tional discourse concerning divest
ment or Stanford's police brutality
— even at a meeting to which he
himself called nine arrestees. Per
haps these acts of civil disobedience
were not "occasional" enough.
Our president emphasized the
idea of protesters respecting "risks
and consequences." He used this as
a rationalization for the threats
coming from the administration to
suspend or expell activists engaging
in "occasional acts of civil dis
obedience." When I was arrested at
Old Union, it was not difficult for
me to understand the risks involved
— a possible jail sentence, proba
tion, and yes, even expulsion. The
hardest thing for me to accept,
however, is the fact that the admin
istration relays a message that
says: "Go ahead and protest, as

long as you realize we can shut you
up at any time."
Bob Beyers, director of Univer
sity News Service, was also a
speaker at this revealing talk on ac
tivism. One of his points was that
effective activists should "keep a
sense of humor." I am sure this
remark is in association with Don
Kennedy's infamous "Question Au
thority" speech. At that speech,
freshmen were told never to
become so serious about an issue
that they could not laugh about it.
Why is it so important to those in
power at Stanford that students run
around laughing at issues that touch
us very deeply? I find nothing

'Go ahead and ___
protest... we can
shut you up at any
time.'

humorous about giving money to
South Africa's repressive govern
ment. It disgusts me that my
money goes to apartheid. Is it so
awful for me to feel this way? Or
should I tell a few racial jokes at the
next rally to liven things up a bit?
Please, sirs, understand the
message you are putting out.
I am new to the Stanford
campus. I am not new, however, to
hypocrisy and political tap dancing.
I guess I did not realize that those
things which are new to me would
coincide so much with those things
I am familiar with. Well, Don, your
talk on Nov. 11 worked. I definitely
intend to continue, in full force, the
tradition of student activism at
Stanford.
