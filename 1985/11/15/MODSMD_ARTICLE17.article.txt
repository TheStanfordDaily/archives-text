## Why Would Kennedy Seek Office? 
### 
I am glad that University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy has laid to
rest, once again (The Daily, Oct.
31), that absurd rumor about his
seeking the Democratic nomination
for the Senate.
Personally, I can't imagine any
thing that would make less sense.
Why would anyone whose name can
hardly be a household word south
of Gilroy or much north of San
Francisco County give up a per-

VIEWPOINT

fectly good job, with lots of money,
dripping with prestige and per
quisites, performed to the ultimate
satisfaction of his employers and
the admiration of the multitudes —
most of whom seem to look upon
him as an emperor with all his
clothes on — for the vagaries of
elected office? That much admira
tion must be hard to come by on the
hustings.
But, above all, why would a good
Reaganite like Kennedy want to run
on the Democratic ticket? Look at
his record!
Without him, might we not be
without our Reagan library, cen
ter and museum (somewhat more
vestigial than originally intended,
but with us still, forever and anon)?
Without him, might someone in
this University not already have

succeeded in loosening our ties
with the Hoover Institution — our
local fountainhead and think tank for
an Administration that history may
well come to regard as the Dark
Ages of the United States? But we
had Kennedy to assure us that
Hoover is not political (a word
mostly used to describe the other
side), and that we need only get to
know it better to love it more.
Surely you have got to be a card
carrying member of the Republican
Party to come up with a notion like
that!
Without Kennedy, would Stan
ford be as helpful as it is to
Reagan's so-called "Star Wars"
strategic defense plan? Without his
leadership, could we still count on
pursuing our policy of constructive
engagement in South Africa? And
would we have a brand-new hand
out on, or indeed a brand-new his
tory of, South Africa?
Would we have our law-and
order-friendly report on allegations
of police brutality by Law Prof. John
Kaplan, with its dissuasion from
dislocating the shoulders of arres
tees and its suggestion that police
wear name tags — already a proven
aid at cocktail parties — which
should dramatically alter the station
house scenario of future arrests
(THUMP, THUMP . . . Eeeeek!
How do you do, officer Jones?").

cer Jones?").
But it is as a union-buster —
Reagan's first act in office, as you
will recall — that Kennedy comes
into his own. It isn't even that he
has always been so good at it. His
first couple of tries merely
succeeded in unifying the United
Stanford Workers union (USW) as
it never had been before. But, as
Goethe said, "Genie ist Fleiss." It
isn't talent, it's application that
counts. And you can't fault him
there. By sticking to his guns, by
some great communicating via his
negotiators and by four months'
worth of stockpiling, he has
succeeded at last in forcing USW
against the wall. You have got to
hand it to him — President Ken
nedy is standing tall at last!
Now, I ask you — with Stanford
controlling over $9.9 billion in as
sets, more than the Chrysler Cor
poration or Procter & Gamble or
several other organizations we nor
mally don't think of as so poor —
does all this sound to you like the
"Compassionate Society?" Or the
'Welfare State?"
And sure enough, in good Repub
lican fashion, we reserve our
welfare for the deserving — our ad
ministrators, for instance. And do
they fare well! No measly 2.5 per
cent there! It is true that those who
have actually been videotaped fall

ing over their own feet are
penalized by having their salaries
held down to a tad below six fig
ures; but their job security is
assured. Have you ever heard of a
directorship, etc., no matter how
incompetently or counter
productively occupied, getting con
tracted out?
As for the workers, they have
been provided with a safety net for
their discontents — unlimited
access to their union stewards to
discuss their working grievances,
provided they do not do so on
working time. What with time out
for chewing, bathroom visits and
just going to and fro, how much
trouble can you stir up in a 34-
minute lunch break? That should
ensure labor peace in our time!
Let's face it. Calling someone a
Democrat these days is not exactly
describing a winner. And unless a
man shows a clear imperative of
principle — and no one has men
tioned that about Kennedy —
saying he has political ambitions is
not the greatest compliment in the
world. No wonder Kennedy bridles
at this story, now bandied about
from Herb Caen to David Stephens
(The Daily, Oct. 29), and calls it a
myth. We should all do our bit to
have it stay that way.
