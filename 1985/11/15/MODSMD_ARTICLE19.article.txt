SOSA Misstated
Meeting's Intent

Mark Tompkins, writing on behalf
of Stanford Out of South Africa
(SOSA), seriously misrepresented
the purpose of the Nov. 4 meeting
between University President
Donald Kennedy and the nine stu
dents who were arrested during
the Oct. 11 sit-in at Old Union
(The Daily, Nov. 11). The purpose
of that meeting was made clear to
all who were there: It was to give
the students an advance copy of
the report on alleged police
brutality prepared by Law Prof.
John Kaplan and to share with
them what Don Kennedy would do
with it and publicly say about it.
It is interesting to read how that
misrepresentation gives Mr.
Tompkins a self-serving license to
criticize on his own terms. Some
straightforward looking state
ments suddenly take on perforative
qualities. For example, he says,
"The arrestees were not given
copies of the report until they met
with Kennedy, despite the fact that
they repeatedly asked to see the
report beforehand." Another mis
representation was to suggest that
the president was absurd in sug
gesting that the report be read
before being criticized.
Mr. Tompkins and SOSA, having
read the report, now write to
criticize it. That's OK and as it
should be if there are parts of it
that they find wanting or in error.
After all, the report was made
public in order that people might
give it the scrutiny it merits. But I,
at least, will be more impressed
with arguments that deal with facts
and substantive issues than with
critiques that try to discredit the
author or the receiver of the
report.
There are substantive issues
that beg some attention and
clarification and which have not
been central to most of the discus
sions growing out of the arrests.
For one, there is a need to know
more about what those arrested
have a right to expect from police,
jailers and the courts when they
comply with, passively resist or
forcibly resist arrest. Should being

convinced of the righteousness of
one's position and engaging in civil
disobedience based on that position
exempt a person from the usual
consequences of breaking the law?
Or result in other forms of differ
ential treatment?
To repeat myself, I will be more
impressed with viewpoints that
forthrightly present facts and deal
with substantive issues than I will
with critiques that misstate situa
tions and try to discredit those
associated with a report or some
side of an issue.

SDI Undermines
Arms Stability

Jim Suhre's columnn (The Daily,
Nov. 11) shows a fundamental
misunderstanding of the likely
consequences of deploying a "Star
Wars" defensive system. Far from
insuring against annihilation, the
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI)
would help bring it about.
SDI would make nuclear war
more likely by destabilizing deter
rence. Nuclear war is not a natural
phenomenon that just happens.
Our own actions, especially weap
ons deployment, can make war
more or less likely. Currently, it
makes no difference which side
strikes first. The leaders of each
side know that if they attack
first, the other side's retaliatory
strike will destroy their country.
Each side is thus deterred from
attacking in the first place.
But SDI would undermine this
stability by introducing an advan
tage to a first strike. Since all
experts are in agreement that SDI
would provide only a partially ef
fective shield against incoming
Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles
(ICBMs) — President Reagan's
specious claims notwithstanding —
it would not protect the U. S. popu
lation from a first strike. What
SDI would do is significantly lessen
the effect of a Soviet retaliatory
strike. The scenario would go as
follows:
The American Pershing 2,
cruise, D-5, and MX missiles all
are capable of destroying Soviet

command centers, ICBMs still in
their silos, bombers on the ground
and submarines in port. After such
an attack, the Soviet Union could
launch only a "ragged" retaliation.
The retaliation would be so weak
that the SDI shield could hold
American casualties to between 10
to 20 million deaths (considered an
"acceptable" level to many military
planners). This means that the
Soviet Union could not be confi
dent that its threat of retaliation
would deter a U.S. attack. In a
crisis, Soviet leaders would be
forced to choose between an effec
tive first strike and an ineffective
second strike. They would strike
first.
Conversely, the United States
would be tempted to launch first to
prevent this. There is crisis insta
bility on both sides. SDI is useless
against a Soviet first strike but
would be useful if the United
States were to attack first. Even
Reagan has admitted that defense
in combination with an offensive
buildup like the one currently oc
curring could be viewed as fostering
an aggressive policy. The United
States doesn't need first strike
weapons — like SDI and MX —
that undermine deterrence.
Another point about space
weaponry is its vulnerability. Split
second reactions would be neces
sary if SDI is to be at all successful
against a Soviet strike. Suhre
states incorrectly that SDI deploy
ment would add time for decision
making. On the contrary, as the
system is planned, there might be
no human participation at all in the
decision to start nuclear war — the
decision would be made by com
puters. This is why so many com
puter experts are coming out
against SDI. Putting nuclear war
on a hair-trigger is not my idea of
ensuring against annihilation.
SDI in combination with other
weaponry currently being deployed
would undermine the stability of
deterrence. Since the only way to
survive nuclear war is not to have
one, it is of paramount importance
that we oppose SDI and other
first-strike-capable weapon sys
tems.
