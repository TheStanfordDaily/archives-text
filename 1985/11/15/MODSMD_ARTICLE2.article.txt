# Experts Predict No Arms Accord

### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
President Reagan told the nation yesterday
that he is going to next week's Geneva sum
mit meeting on a "mission for peace" and will
seek agreements on broad cultural, educa
tional and scientific exchanges with the Soviet
Union.
"We can find as yet undiscovered avenues
where American and Soviet citizens can
cooperate, fruitfully, for the benefit of
mankind," the president said in his televised
address from the Oval Office.
Reagan said the two sides "are close to
completing a new agreement" to resume and
expand the cultural and educational exchange
programs that President Carter suspended
following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in
1979.
The president offered few comments on
arms control in his 20-minute address. He
said he has geared his Geneva agenda not just
to avoid war but to ensure peace.
Experts here say the two superpowers
have shown in recent weeks that their cur
rent goals for arms control are irreconcilable.
Thus, the Reagan Administration, recogniz
ina fhot arms control agreement is

unlikely, has attempted to lower expectations
of progress in that area and to switch the
focus from nuclear weapons reductions to
other areas, such as cultural exchanges of
American and Soviet students, sports teams
and musicians.
"The prospects for a meaningful agree
ment or a guideline to an agreement are dis
mal," said Coit Blacker, associate director of
Stanford's Center for International Security
and Arms Control.
The Reagan Administration wants to lower
expectations of success on the arms control
front to hedge against looking bad if the sum
mit is a non-event, and to reap the rewards if
the two sides reach a significant agreement in
Geneva, Blacker said.
He noted that Soviet leaders also have
been "positioning through propaganda," by
releasing optimistic pre-summit statements
so that they appear willing to negotiate and
thus can blame Reagan for a failure to reach
an arms control agreement.
Blacker, saying that cultural and educa
tional exchanges are less significant than
agreements on arms control, noted that the
summit could not be considered a success un
less Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev "initialed some understanding
for guidelines to (pursuing) an arms con
trol agreement."
But he listed measures "to prevent the
accidental outbreak of nuclear war ... to
decrease uncertainty and improve com
munications in a crisis" as other important
topics the leaders may address at the
summit.
Alexander Dallin, professor of history
and political science, said he had no ex
pectations that the two sides would reach

an arms control agreement in Geneva and
called other areas of discussion, such as
cultural exchanges and adding consulates
in each country, "face-saving agreements
that can always be pulled out of a drawer."
"These are useful things, but they don't
turn around U.S.-Soviet relations," Dallin
said. "If there are no agreements reached
on managing conflicts, relations are likely
to get worse."
Dallin said the summit might prove
fruitful in that Reagan and Gorbachev will
have a chance to meet in person. "Both
are sort of genial personalities," he said,
but added that "it would be naive to think
everything said and done over the past
five years will be forgotten."

Richard Staar, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution who served as U.S.
ambassador to the Mutual and Balanced
Force Reduction Talks from 1981 to
1983, said he opposed a "get-acquainteJ"
summit meeting.
"I'm against going to a summit without
adequate preparation," Staar said, adding
that before a summit, all agreements
should be completely worked out and all
treaties ready to sign.
"Disillusionment will occur," Staar said
of the summit. "The media has built ex
pectations up . . . and the White House is
trying to deflate those expectations."
Experts say Gorbachev should prove a
for Reagan.
