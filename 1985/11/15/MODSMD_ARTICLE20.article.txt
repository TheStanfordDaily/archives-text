## Why Not a Test Ban? 
### 
In late July, one of the most important events in the
history of the nuclear era occurred, but it was quickly
glossed over by the U.S. media. On July 29, the Soviet
Union decided unilaterally to halt any further testing of
nuclear weapons for the rest of the year and as long as
the United States would reciprocate and refrain from
testing. An extended ban might have opened the way
for a long-term treaty like the Limited Test Ban Treaty
of 1963. Since new nuclear weapons — as well as many
of the components of Star Wars, like X-ray lasers —
cannot easily be developed without testing, a mutual,
comprehensive test ban would halt technical advance
ments in the nuclear arms race.

VIEWPOINT

This major Soviet initiative was quickly dismissed by
the Reagan Administration and the national media as a
mere propaganda ploy. Reagan stated that the Soviets
are ahead in the arms race and their testing program.
But this is not true. The U. S. arsenal is comparable to
that of the Soviet Union if not superior, according to
the 1982 Department of Defense Annual Report. Gen.
John Vessey, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
testified on May 11, 1982, "Overall, would I trade with
(Soviet Chief of the General Staff Nikolai) Ogarkov?
Not on your life!" On April 18, 1983, Lt. Gen. Brent
Scowcroft, chairman of the President's Commission on
Strategic Forces, testified, "I don't think I would trade
our triad of forces for the Soviets'." Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger also testified on April 29,
1982: "I would not for a moment exchange anything (in
our nuclear arsenal), because we have an immense
edge in technology."
Regarding testing, the United States has exploded
770 nuclear weapons since World War 11, compared to
the Soviet Union's 564. In 1985, the Soviet Union has
conducted seven nuclear test explosions. The United
States has tested 14 times — twice as many.
Can we trust the "Evil Empire?" The Soviets cer
tainly don't treat dissidents in their country well, and
the invasion of Afghanistan and the bloody war there
are certainly as brutal as the U. S. -backed contra war in
Nicaragua. But this does not mean that the Soviets are
incapable of making a truly positive step toward dis
armament. The comprehensive test ban invitation was
such a positive step. It is notable, too, that the Soviets
didn't just make a verbal proposal. They took the first
step in actually unilaterally halting their tests.
Reagan has argued that a comprehensive nuclear
test ban would be unverifiable. This is odd, since he
also believes that a flawless Star Wars defense can be
created. It is far easier to develop a system to detect a
nuclear weapon test explosion than it is to create a sys
tem that can find and shoot down every Soviet missile
during the few minutes in which they zoom toward the
United States.
The spy satellites and computer wizardry that it
takes to detect and recognize a launched missile in

these four minutes during a war is much, much, more
sophisticated than the spy satellites, computers and
earthquake detectors that are needed to detect a
massive nuclear detonation during peacetime. In the
last decade, the Soviets also appear to have become
much more open to on-site inspections. This should
make verification even easier.
If the test ban proposal was simply a public relations
move, it would have been very easy to counter — the
United States could simply have called their bluff and
accepted the Soviets' invitation. Then, if they reneged
on their commitment, the United States would have
won the propaganda war; if they did not, we would
have achieved a halt in the arms race.
Why didn't the United States quickly accept this invi
tation to halt the nuclear arms race? Why did the media
so easily accept the perspective that "it's all a public re
lations ploy?" Does the United States really want to
halt the nuclear arms race? Certainly the people of the
United States do. In poll after poll, a majority of people
say they are afraid of nuclear war and that they want a
mutual freeze in nuclear weapons production and
negotiations toward balanced reductions. Americans
are quite aware that the billions of dollars that are
spent each year on new nuclear weapons could be used
instead to do things like address world hunger, im
prove our schools or clean up dangerous toxic waste
dumps. The money could also be used to pay off our
gargantuan national debt and to get the economy back
on track and the government off our backs.
But there are other forces involved. The "military
industrial complex" about which President Eisenhower
warned has a vested interest in the arms race. The mil
itary machine is big business, eating up more than 50
percent of our federal income tax dollars and compris
ing 6.4 percent of the entire gross national product.
Some of the largest and most profitable companies in
this country rely on military contracts, and to many
millions of people it appears that their jobs and careers
are dependent on the continuation of the arms race.
Even Stanford, presumed to be a bastion of liberals and
peace doves, is the sixth largest recipient of prime mili
tary research contracts among colleges and univer
sities. In 1984, Stanford received $29,183,000 —
equivalent to about one-quarter of the money raised
from tuition and student fees.
It is very expedient for each Administration to talk
about negotiations and arms reductions, but never to
halt or reduce weapons development and production.
Guessing that the Reagan Administration would not
respond to the Soviet proposal, Rep. Patricia
Schroeder (D-Colo.) has offered a bill that would cut off
funding for U.S. nuclear tests as long as the Soviets
continue to refrain from testing. It is very important for
each of us to support this bill and insist that the Soviet
initiative not be ignored.
