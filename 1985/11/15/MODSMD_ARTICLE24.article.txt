"The academic atmosphere in
Poland is more open than any other
country in the Soviet bloc," said
Prof. Norman Davies, visiting pro
fessor in the History Department
and an expert on Poland.
Details are now being worked
out to establish a Stanford overseas
center in Krakow, Poland as an
eight-week summer program
through Jagellonian University.
"We began making field trips to
Poland two years ago from the Ber
lin and Vienna centers," said Amy
Sims, assistant to the director of
the Overseas Studies Office.
The groups traveled in Poland to
Warsaw and Krakow, and "student
enthusiasm was so great after
those field trips" that the idea of a
new overseas center was pursued,
Sims said.
Sims, who was teaching at the
Berlin overseas center in 1984
when she participated in a field trip
to Poland, said, "It was a wonder
fully exciting place to be, more
stimulating than either East Ger
many or Hungary."
"Stanford students will find when
they go there, Poland's highly in

dividualistic nature," said Davies.
"American students will be faced
with quite conflicting attitudes.
There's always an atmosphere of
intense debate," said Davies.
"Americans will be surprised by
how popular America is with young
Poles, how popular Reagan is," said
Davies.

"After the second world war,
Poland was included in the Soviet
bloc, contrary to the wishes of the
populace," said Davies.

"At regular intervals the popula
tion has protested against the sys
tem of government," explained
Davies.
Solidarity was "crushed physi
cally in 1981-82 . . . thousands
were imprisoned," Davies said.
"Now Solidarity can only operate
as an illegal operation. The great
majority passively support it.
"There is widespread under
ground activity (by the Solidarity
movement)," he said.
"Courses with ideological bias
are much less acceptable than they
were before 1980," Davies said.
"Poland is a lively place. The
church and other institutions are
well able to hold their own with the
government.
"The Roman Catholic Church in
Poland is the only independent in
stitution of any sort in the Soviet
bloc. The Polish church is the foun
dation on which Polish culture lies,"
he explained.
Davies said economic reforms in
the direction of private enterprise are
unlikely in Poland. "Economic ex
perimentation only takes place in a
communist system when the party
in power feels secure in their posi
tion. Poland's ruling party is weak
and unlikely to change."
