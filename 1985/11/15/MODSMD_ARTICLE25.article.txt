## 'Insignificance' Introduces Einstein to Monroe 
### LARRY NADLER 
"I'm not theoretic, I demonstrate," Marilyn Monroe
seductively announces to a politely nonplussed Albert
Einstein, breathlessly emphasizing her words as if
proclaiming her intention to set forth Freud's theories
of sexual repression with a striptease. Actually, she
does proceed to prove to A 1 her mastery of the prin
ciples of Specific Relativity, illustrating the mathemati
cal relationship of energy, space, time and matter with
the same bubbly, sex-kitten radiance that won her the
leading role in the dream-worlds of countless post
pubescent males.
Of course, Einstein's and Monroe's paths never ac
tually crossed in our universe, only in the dream-world
translated first to the stage by playwright Terry
Johnson, and then to the big screen in British director
Nicholas Roeg's seventh feature film, "Insignificance."
Here, Roeg once again deals with his favorite themes:
the struggle of keeping a firm grasp on identity and
truth in a mischievously perplexing universe, and how
the failure to comprehend that world leads to aliena
tion, spiritual vacuity and fantasy.
In "Insignificance's" revisal of history, which unfolds
over one hot summer night in 1954, Einstein has just
arrived in New York City to speak at a World Peace
Conference. By morning, he has been harassed by
Sen. Joe McCarthy for refusing to give anti-communist
testimony at his Senate witch trials, by Monroe for
refusing to sleep with her, and by her husband Joe
DiMaggio for appearing to have.
"Insignificance" moves at a breezy pace, thanks to
Johnson's script, chock full of fast-paced verbal repar
tee that is a constant reminder of the film's theatrical
origins (as well as the concentration of action in one
setting — Einstein's admittedly expansive hotel suite).
There are enough witty one-liners for a Neil Simon
farce, but the punnery is just frosting on a layer cake of
signifiers and signifieds (msignifiers?) that play on the
public's impressions of who these famous figures
reallv were.
These are people, like you and I, in a constant flux
in their own searches for definition of identity. It is that

search which unifies apparently dissimilar per
sonalities, transforming Monroe's insistence to
Einstein that "We have an awful lot in common!" into
an ironic double-edged observation rather than simply
a wishful come-on line.
The performances are, for the most part, a delight.
Roeg has brought out a complexity in the characters
that is crucial to how Johnson explores the contradic
tions in their mental and emotional qualities — the gray
territory where simple archetypal traits blur into an in
tricate, heterogenous whole.
Theresa Russell, in a glistening performance that
expands on the self-destructive free-spirit she played
in Roeg's last film, the quickly-forgotten "Bad
Timing/A Sensual Obsession," is a strikingly multi
hued Monroe. Her ability to glide from exotic sexiness
to sheepish coyness to wrenching frustration breathes

life into a Hollywood caricature. It is a carefully
composed presentation of a troubled, discomposed
personality using sensuality as emotional armor.
Michael Emil is just as adroit as a modest but
troubled Einstein, unrelentingly haunted by the
spectre of Hiroshima. His knowledge turns against him
as he desperately tries to communicate with a world of
insecurities which have already botched up his
humanitarian efforts as a scientist. Whether patiently
nodding as DiMaggio explains bubble-gum baseball se
ries, stumbling over his own words in a fluster as
McCarthy threatens his reputation, or suppressing his
libido as he explains the shape of the universe to
Marilyn, it appears he may at any time erupt into
spontaneous enlightenment from the force of the quan
tum calculations formulating in his head.
Like the two young children who find themselves

confronted with a mysterious aborigine culture in the
Australian outback in Roeg's 1970 Walkabout, these
are strangers in a mystifying wilderness. In their at
tempt to resolve love, knowledge, fame and responsi
bility to humanity with individual conceptions of
self-importance and non-importance, they begin to
resemble Ingmar Bergman's tormented, loveless souls
searching for a common language of communication.
Like Bergman, Roeg links the past, present and
future as a key to their pursuit. His elliptical treatment
of spaces and time-frames creates new associative
meanings or emphasizes existing ones.
When Monroe stares into the bathroom mirror
(there's a lot of staring into mirrors in Roeg films), she
can only see (like in Hockney's portrait) a distorted,
confused image — a collection of thoughts and emo
tions in disarray. It is ultimately the conquerors of time
and space, the same villains that Roeg manipulates so
valiantly and Einstein seeks to define, that hold the key
to Monroe's suffering. They become the common
variable in Einstein's scientific/political and Monroe's
emotional torment, while ignorance is the obstacle to
both inner and global peace. Accordingly, when
McCarthy announces that he "has come to the conclu
sion that the shape of space-time is not important!" and
erases Einstein's equations from the blackboard, you
feel that the Wicked Witch of the West has just stran
gled Toto!
Einstein and Monroe can only observe, learn, and
experience their worlds with their unique intellectual
tools — ultimately passive viewers in a cosmic three
ring circus of irrationality. Einstein can thumb his nose
at human stupidity, but Roeg comes up with the win
ning hand: with film he can stop time by moving with
the speed of light and beyond. His imaginative use of
his creative medium emerges as a lone hope, suggest
ing that, faced with the juxtaposition of past and pres
ent experiences, some of mankind's mystifications and
illusions of identity might just dissolve with the
recognition of correlation. Roeg thus guiltlessly
becomes the center of the universe he has created,
defiantly thumbing his nose at the apocalypse, unifying
the fields, and melting the Wicked Witch where she
stands.
