# Christie Strikes Again with 'Ordeal'
## 
### PAT FREYTAG 
Neither Monsieur Hercule Poirot
nor Miss Jane Marple undertakes
the nasty business of revealing the
guilty in Agatha Christie's "Ordeal
by Innocence." Instead, the digging
for clues of a murder-in-the-past
and their suspenseful interpretation
is left to an American paleontologist
(Donald Sutherland) back from a
two-year tour of the Antarctic. This
switch in sleuths sounds comical,
but in this Desmond Davis ("Clash
of the Titans") production of
Christie's detective novel it works
artfully.
Dr. Arthur Calgary (Sutherland)
is an ordinary man who becomes
entangled in a murder-mystery by
mere chance. Prior to his research
expedition, he gives a lift to a young
man who absentmindedly leaves his
address book on the front seat of
the car. Unable to return it, Dr.
Calgary saves it and consequently
returns it two years later. It is here
that the movie commences.
Subsequently, the doctor learns
from the young man's father, Leo
Argyle (Christopher Plummer),
that his son has been hanged for the

murder of his wife, the young man's
mother, Rachel Argyle (Faye
Dunaway). As this conversation
develops, the audience learns that
Dr. Calgary was the absent witness
at the trial and the never-believed
alibi of Jacko Argyle.
Out of a sense to put justice
right, and perhaps even to clear his
conscience, Dr. Calgary
determines to reopen the case.
This, however, proves to be a life
threatening, one-man challenge as
none of the members of the Argyle
household, even when presented
with proof of Jacko's innocence, has
the least desire to pursue the road
to just exoneration. Even the sup
erintendent in charge of the murder
investigation two years previously
subtly threatens the doctor to leave
well enough alone. This religious
reluctance to clear the name of the
innocent man, however, serves
only to deepen the doctor's drive to
amend the injustice and to reveal
the guilty. Furthermore, the audi
ence's curiosity about the character
of Jacko Argyle is broadened: Who
was this "enfant terrible?" Why is
his family so satisfied with the
outcome of the trial even after
proof of the young man's innocence

is set forward? If he did not do it,
who did? The movie grips the
viewer and does not surrender him
until the very end, unfortunately,
somewhat anticlimactically. This is
the only real weakness of the
movie. The deflation, however, is
not caused by the revelation of who
the murderer is but rather by the
reasons why he did it; they lack the
small detail of credibility.
Irony pervades the character of
Dr. Calgary. He stands for the prin
ciple of justice done right
(encapsulated in the very first
scene of the movie by ringing a bell
— the bell of justice), yet his ab
sense at the trial of Jacko Argyle
causes an innocent man to be
hanged. Later, his determination to
reveal the guilty claims two other
innocent victims, thus enveloping
the Argyle household in an "Or
deal by Innocence." The doctor's
attempt to champion the righteous
ness of justice ultimately fails to the
extent that the injustice committed
is convenient and economically
silenced. By the end, convenience
and money destroy a natural princi
ple and gain another apathetic con
vert.
The creation of suspense in the

movie is exceptionally well done.
The interjection of repetitive flash
backs, as imagined by Dr. Calgary,
parallels his thought process as he
attempts to piece together the ran
dom anecdotes he hears from the
second-time suspects and the sup
posedly innocent. This allows the
audience to share in the psychologi
cal development of the main charac
ter, and thus almost participate
with him in the murder solution.
The music selections (all new and
old pieces by Dave Brubeck) also
add to the environment of
suspense. They suspend and com
plement the imagined flashbacks as
does the exquisite photography of
the Devonshire landscapes. The
use of jazz as a suspense tool is
fresh and ties in very well to the
mood of the film.
The movie as a whole is a good
murder-mystery, artfully edited,
photographed and directed. The
acting is consistent with what is ex
pected in an all-star cast with small
roles. The commentary it carries
concerning the righteousness of
justice is blunt but forceful. It is all
ironically summed up by the last
words of Dr. Calgary to the super
intendent: "You were right."

of the Titans") production of
Christie's detective novel it works
artfully.
Dr. Arthur Calgary (Sutherland)
is an ordinary man who becomes
entangled in a murder-mystery by
mere chance. Prior to his research
expedition, he gives a lift to a young
man who absentmindedly leaves his
address book on the front seat of
the car. Unable to return it, Dr.
Calgary saves it and consequently
returns it two years later. It is here
that the movie commences.
Subsequently, the doctor learns
from the young man's father, Leo
Argyle (Christopher Plummer),
that his son has been hanged for the

murder of his wife, the young man's
mother, Rachel Argyle (Faye
Dunaway). As this conversation
develops, the audience learns that
Dr. Calgary was the absent witness
at the trial and the never-believed
alibi of Jacko Argyle.
Out of a sense to put justice
right, and perhaps even to clear his
conscience, Dr. Calgary
determines to reopen the case.
This, however, proves to be a life
threatening, one-man challenge as
none of the members of the Argyle
household, even when presented
with proof of Jacko's innocence, has
the least desire to pursue the road
to just exoneration. Even the sup
erintendent in charge of the murder
investigation two years previously
subtly threatens the doctor to leave
well enough alone. This religious
reluctance to clear the name of the
innocent man, however, serves
only to deepen the doctor's drive to
amend the injustice and to reveal
the guilty. Furthermore, the audi
ence's curiosity about the character
of Jacko Argyle is broadened: Who
was this "enfant terrible?" Why is
his family so satisfied with the
outcome of the trial even after
proof of the young man's innocence

is set forward? If he did not do it,
who did? The movie grips the
viewer and does not surrender him
until the very end, unfortunately,
somewhat anticlimactically. This is
the only real weakness of the
movie. The deflation, however, is
not caused by the revelation of who
the murderer is but rather by the
reasons why he did it; they lack the
small detail of credibility.
Irony pervades the character of
Dr. Calgary. He stands for the prin
ciple of justice done right
(encapsulated in the very first
scene of the movie by ringing a bell
— the bell of justice), yet his ab
sense at the trial of Jacko Argyle
causes an innocent man to be
hanged. Later, his determination to
reveal the guilty claims two other
innocent victims, thus enveloping
the Argyle household in an "Or
deal by Innocence." The doctor's
attempt to champion the righteous
ness of justice ultimately fails to the
extent that the injustice committed
is convenient and economically
silenced. By the end, convenience
and money destroy a natural princi
ple and gain another apathetic con
vert.
The creation of suspense in the

movie is exceptionally well done.
The interjection of repetitive flash
backs, as imagined by Dr. Calgary,
parallels his thought process as he
attempts to piece together the ran
dom anecdotes he hears from the
second-time suspects and the sup
posedly innocent. This allows the
audience to share in the psychologi
cal development of the main charac
ter, and thus almost participate
with him in the murder solution.
The music selections (all new and
old pieces by Dave Brubeck) also
add to the environment of
suspense. They suspend and com
plement the imagined flashbacks as
does the exquisite photography of
the Devonshire landscapes. The
use of jazz as a suspense tool is
fresh and ties in very well to the
mood of the film.
The movie as a whole is a good
murder-mystery, artfully edited,
photographed and directed. The
acting is consistent with what is ex
pected in an all-star cast with small
roles. The commentary it carries
concerning the righteousness of
justice is blunt but forceful. It is all
ironically summed up by the last
words of Dr. Calgary to the super
intendent: "You were right."
