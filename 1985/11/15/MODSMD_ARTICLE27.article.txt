# Dancing Lends Its Own Style To Rest of 'My One and Only'
## 
### ELAINE WANG 
The storyline in George
Gershwin's "My One and Only" is
nothing to shout about — the usual
boy meets girl, loses girl and gets
her in the end. Capt. Billy Buck
Chandler (Tommy Tune) is a flying
ace determined to be the first to fly
from New York to Paris. Edith Her
bert (Lucie Arnaz) is queen of the
European Aquacade, who makes
decorous dives into swimming
pools, but who wants to "defect"
from the slavedriver, Prince Nic
holai (Don Amendolia), who holds
her passport. "Nikki" also holds
supposedly crude photos of Edith
as further blackmail.
The plot takes place during
Prohibition, which is the rationale
for a lot of dance and carousing se
quences; the historical twist is that,
were it not for love, Billy Chandler
would have been the pilot who
made the first recorded trans-Atlan
tic flight, not Charles Lindbergh.
There's a further twist to that too.
The show is a collection of music

by George Gershwin and lyrics by
Ira Gershwin, and includes such
classics as "Strike Up the Band"
and "SWonderful," worked into a
story that tends toward the
schmaltzy. So go to "My One and
Only" because you like Gershwin
and you like tap dancing; the music,
choreography and energy are
rousing and superb. The lights go
out for one scene, and the dancing
gentlemen perform with canes,
gloves and bow ties that glow in the
dark. In another sequence they dis
appear behind a backdrop and all
you see are synchronized feet.
When Billy's plane wrecks on a
beach on Staten Island, the lovers
dance in the water — and there
really is a shallow pool on stage.
The two leads fit their parts and
each other. Arnaz's Edith is sophisti
cated, but with a hesitant vul
nerability that matches Tune's
portrayal of the rather hickish Billy.
Both are fair singers and better
dancers; Tune, in fact, directed and
choreographed this production with
Thommie Walsh. Being 6-foot-6
makes Tune distinctive in the dance

world, but he's got tremendous
style as well.- Humor and loose
jointed grace make him the most
endearing person in the show.
The show hits its richest stride
when Billy goes to Mr. Magix's Em
porial for advice on how to win his
one and only. Charles "Honi" Coles
is the wise old charmer who
teaches the boyish pilot the "High
Hat" and "Sweet and Low-Down"
ways of winning Edith, all il
lustrated through strong presence,
nevertheless, as calm authority. It
is in Act Two, when Billy is really
desperate, that Coles gets to
move; he casts his eyes heaven
ward, sighing, "Lord, this boy's
gonna make me get outta my
chair," and shows the boy what to
do. The playbill lists this part as
"special material," and it is special
indeed.
The wonders of tap — the effort
lessness, the elegance — are
epitomized in Coles' dancing. He
and Tune tap fast, then slow, then
slower, and quickly again, a little
friendly one-upmanship here and
there. The step sequence is un

predictable and seems almost ad
libbed. Even after they have
seemingly finished, with the audi
ence going wild, the two confer and
do it again — this time with more

complicated steps, Tune following
Coles. It's so exhilarating that you
lose track of the plot, or at least
aren't involved with it anymore.
This Gershwin musical isn't the

only show in town, obviously, but
it's well worth seeing and hearing.
"My One and Only" plays at the
Golden Gate Theatre in San Fran
cisco through Dec. 22.
