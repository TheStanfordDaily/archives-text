## SF's Gray Derby Cramps Elegance

There are more than 4,000 res
taurants in San Francisco. If you ate
at a different place every day for
breakfast, lunch and dinner, it
would be four years before you
got around to all of San Fran
cisco's restaurants. Since most
Stanford students don't have this
kind of time, I've taken the task on
myself.
This week, my search for San
Francisco dining excellence brought
me to The Gray Derby, inside the
Lombard Hotel on 1015 Geary.
The; Gray Derby's location has its
advantages and disadvantages. The
Lombard Hotel is close to impor
tant cultural attractions, like the
San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra. At the same time, the
hungry student will find it excep
tionally difficult to find parking near
the Gray Derby.
Alsoy be forewarned. Though
The Gray Derby is not by any
mearfwn the red light district, there
is a garish adult bookstore across
the ffireet.

The Gray Derby features glass
topped tables in an opulent art deco
interior. It is designed well enough,
but the good ideas are not carried
far enough. The silverware and
table layouts look great, and would
give the place a stylish, "Miami
Vice" feel. Unfortunately, one gets
the sense that the Lombard Hotel
only had limited space to allocate
for the restaurant. The tables are
squeezed into a little corner of the
hotel lobby, and seating can be
cramped. The lighting is not really
low enough to be romantic.
Worst of all, the double doors of
the kitchen are close enough to the
main part of the restaurant that you
can see and hear them slam open
every time a waiter or busboy goes
through. Little details, like wall
finishes that somehow remind you
of painted cinder blocks, clash with
the overall feel of glittering tables
and well-dressed waiters.
As an appetizer, we started off
with chicken teriyaki au brochette
($2.75). It was well seasoned and
tender, and there was plenty to eat
for two.
For entrees, The Gray Derby
has a variety of French and Califor
nia cuisine entrees, ranging in price
from about $9 to $13. I had veal
marsala ($10.25), which was good,

though not outstanding. My com
panion had chicken isu ($9.75),
chicken stuffed with ham, cheese
and spices, which she enjoyed
greatly.
In keeping with the rest of the
restaurant, the entrees were in
ventively laid out on the plates. You
can tell the chef cared about not
only how the food tasted, but how it
looked as well.
I thought the service was pretty
uninspired. We had the impression
that our waiter had something else
on his mind, or had a party he really
wanted to get to after work. Like
the entrees, he seemed in charac
ter with the rest of the place; well
dressed, but uncaring about all the
details.

Although the management seems
to go a long way to make sure the
tables and the waiters look their
best, the fact remains: The Gray
Derby is crammed into a hotel
lobby. You can even see the heating
ducts beyond the restaurant's false
ceiling. It's like a magic show where
everyone can see the card up the
magician's sleeve; it tends to
destroy the illusion.
The Gray Derby certainly has
good points, but they simply are not
followed through on enough to
make the restaurant really good. If
you find yourself downtown for a
play or concert and you already
have a parking space nearby, you
could easily do worse than The Gray
Derby, but I wouldn't recommend a
special trip from the Farm.
