The Espresso Bar
Bechtel International Center

Friday night was probably the
most enjoyable evening I have ex
perienced on campus this year.
I sat in a warm room, listened to
a live jazz performance, drank cof
fee, indulged myself in some des
sert, and talked with old friends,
new friends and people I had never
seen before.
All I had to do was to walk to the
International Center behind Tresid
der Union. And there I found the
student-run Espresso Bar, gearing
up for its first night of business.
When I arrived at the Espresso
Bar at 8 p.m. there were already
scattered people sitting with their
hot cups of coffee. The two large
rooms of the Espresso Bar felt a
little cold and impersonal at first.
The lights were too bright, the
decor was fairly stark, and the
furniture was Victorian-looking in
its stiff lightness.
By 8:30, however, the Espresso
Bar had transformed into a warm,
cheerfully noisy and comfortable
place. Students had filled the tables

in the "main" room and were begin
ning to spill over into the second
room, which looks more like a living
room than a cafe.
There wasn't much studying
going on, but then again it was a
Friday. People played chess on the
boards provided by the Espresso
Bar. A few couples danced to the
great jazz tunes of the Timothy
Enos band. Mostly the patrons of
the Espresso Bar talked, laughed
and argued.
And, of course, they ate and
drank. The Espresso Bar's menu
includes house coffee for 45 cents a
cup, which is hot and good. I had a
cafe mocha ($1.40), which was the
perfect mixture of tastes, and
which was nice and warm after the
cold weather outside. I also tasted
the hot chocolate (65 cents), and it
was very good.
The Espresso Bar also offers
desserts, freshly baked by the stu
dents who run the place. Friday
night I sampled the poppyseed
cake. For 75 cents I got an ample
portion of light cake with the per
fect amount of poppyseeds and a
nice frosting on top.
For studying, talking and drink
ing coffee close to home, the
Espresso Bar is definitely the place
to go.
