### MARY K. McDEVITT Staff writer 
At a public hearing in San Jose
yesterday, the County of Santa
Clara approved a proposed site for
a new multi-million dollar Graduate
School of Business building sched
uled to open in December 1987.
Approval of the property situated
at the intersection of Lausen Street
and Memorial Way faced no public
opposition, according to Ransom
Bratton, the county's architectural
and site approval committee sec
retary. "There were no real con
cerns at all," he said.
Construction of the $16 million
classroom and office building is to
begin this spring, depending on the

availability of funds and approval by
the Board of Trustees, according to
Paul Johnson, associate dean of ad
ministration for the business
school.
Johnson said the new building,
which is to be built on land adjacent
to the business school's current
four-story structure, is designed to
fulfill a need for office and expansion
space.
"Virtually, we don't have any
space (now)," Johnson said. "The
faculty who teach Monday, Wednes
day and Friday share offices with
the ones who teach Tuesday and
Thursday."
A generous stock donation by
alumnus Edmund Littlefield, an
nounced in July, enabled the
Graduate School of Business to

begin fund raising for the building
project, Johnson said.
The sale of stock, which the San
Francisco business executive will
donate over the next several years,
is expected to accrue $5 million.
Additional gifts of $500,000 from
both Lockheed Corp. and the Ford
Motor Co. and $250,000 from Con
oco Inc. will also help finance the
project.
Business school administrators
estimated in 1981 that the school
was between 30,000 and 50,000
feet short of needed space.
As a short-term solution, three
temporary units were built to pro
vide office space for 40 doctoral
candidates and to house the busi
ness school's Career Planning and
Placement Office.

The Edmund W. Littlefield Cen
ter, which will replace the tempo
rary structures and will allow for
expansion in new areas, such as
microcomputers, was designed to
meet the needs of the school for the
next 10 to 20 years, Johnson said.
The ground level of the new
building will hold two 45-person
capacity classrooms, three seminar
rooms and some meeting space for
use by University groups, including
the Board of Trustees. The second
and third floors will house office
space for 100 tenured faculty.
A basement level will be used by
the Provost's Office and as storage
for mechanical equipment. Charac
teristic of Stanford architecture,
red tile roofing will cover the
structure.
