One of the first things I did when
I first arrived at this esteemed uni
versity as a freshman was to find
where all the good restaurants
were. That was before I realized
that as a student I was going to
have to cut down on my spending
money.
I've never gone back to most of
the restaurants I tried in my "pre
thrift" days, but one restaurant I
did go back to is Chili's.
This time I went with my big
sister. She's a Stanford graduate
who now works in Palo Alto, where
she hangs out with her yuppy
friends. She goes to Chili's a lot,
too. Sue (that's my sister's name)
offered a whole new perspective on
the "Chili's experience."
She said, "Chili's is neat 'cause
you can hang out and drink if you
want." Not to condone that sort of
activity, but it is a distinct possibil
ity for those over 21.
I'm not 21, so we just ate. Oh
well. No juicy bar stories to tell, no
Cheers plots, nothing. Just great
food.
And the food is great. Chili's calls
itself a hamburger grill, but it also
serves great Mexican food and
wonderful chili, so I guess you
could classify it as a Tex-Mex place.
The atmosphere is casual. The
appetizers really are called
"starters," so when I say, "For
starters we had, etc." you can't
groan at my writing style.
So, for starters we had the tos
tado chips with hot sauce (95 cents).
The tostado chips were hot and
crispy, and there were more than
enough for both of us. The hot
sauce tasted a lot like Mrs.
Renfroe's, which is my favorite hot
sauce, except for the stuff my Aunt
Mary Ann buys at the Lucky's in
Berryessa. (It's a quiet week in
Lake Wobegon. . . .)
We could have gotten the super

nachos, the cheese fries, the buf
falo wings, the tostado chips with
guacamole, the quesadillas, or the
barbecue beans, all of which are
very reasonably priced. But since
there were only two of us, and
since Chili's is notorious for its big
servings, we stuck with a more
conservative amount of starters.
Then we got The Salad. It was a
choice between The Salad and the
taco salad, but we chose The Salad
so Sue could lower her voice while
she ordered it, emphasizing the
gargantuan feel of its name. For
$3.75, the salad includes lettuce,
sprouts, mushrooms, cheese,
tomato, chives, bacon, sesame
seeds and your choice of house,
Ranch, Thousand Island or Blue
Cheese dressings. For $4.50 the
salad also comes with guacamole.
We got the cheaper one, with the
house dressing, which was a good
oil and vinegar. We didn't finish the
salad, not becaiise it wasn't good,
but because it was so big (we were
sharing one).
The entrees at Chili's are divided
into groups. There's "Something
Different," which offers a chicken
sandwich, a barbecue chicken bas
ket, fajitas and fajitas for two.
These are the most expensive
items on the menu, the fajitas for
two topping them all at $12.95.
Then the "Tacos" category, in
which you can get Honest Tacos,
Chili's Special Soft Tacos, or
Veggie Tacos. The taco prices
range from $3.30 for the specials to
$3.95 for the Honest Tacos
(honesty always has its price). I've
had the soft tacos before, and
they're really good.
The "Burgers" list is extensive
and mouth-watering. Chili's serves
fresh ground half-pound burgers
cooked medium rare, and you can
add bacon to any burger for 65
cents. The burgers are inexpen
sive, too, for what you get. The
two cheapest burgers are the
Oldtimer (mustard, lettuce,
tomato, pickle, onion) and the No
Bun Burger (meat, cheese, tomato,
chives and sesame seeds) for
$3.30. The Bacon Burger is the
most expensive, including bacon,
cheddar, mayo, onion, lettuce,

tomato and pickle for $4.15.
You can also get fresh cut
homestyle fries for $1.25, and
Chili's Dog, a hot dog with chili,
cheese, onions and mustard for
$3.30. Then at the back of the
menu Chili's lists homestyle chili.
The chili is good and cheap, all
three kinds costing only $2.95.
My sister got the Chili's Own
Bowl of Red and couldn't finish it. I
tasted some: It was good, for chili,
which I don't like. Sue liked it, but
complained that it didn't come with
sour cream. She took the sour
cream off of the plate of relishes
that came with my fajitas (the
prerogative of a big sister).
My fajitas were excellent. You
get a plate of loudly sizzling
charbroiled steak and chicken on a
bed of grilled onions. Then you get
a plate of freshly warmed tortillas,
and a pottery dish of grated cheese,
guacamole, sour cream and
tomatoes with a slight taco-sauce
flavor about them, called pico de
gallo. So you roll your own tortilla,
and it's really good, but also a bit

messy. You can also eat the meat
alone, or the tortilla alone, or
create any other combination that
you feel like making.
The service on a Wednesday at
about 6 p.m. was excellent, but as
the crowds started coming in, and
the waitress got busier, some prob
lems came up. It took quite a long
time for us to get refills on our
drinks. And when I started eating
my fajitas, I realized that there
were no napkins on the table.-
Other than that, Chili's macte for
a very enjoyable dining experience.
The full restaurant is made fess
noisy and crowded-feeling by (he
dim lighting, separate booths, and
abundance of plants and decorative
items. It's fun to look around the
restaurant and see all the bizarre
little objects placed in every
available space. It gives the restau
rant a college-town, hang-out feel.
The best thing about Chili's is
that you can get a satisfying meal
for $5 or $6 and still feel like you've
actually "gone out." Great for
dates, large groups or going out
with your big sister.
