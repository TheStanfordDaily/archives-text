## Card Hopes Desert Sun Won't Burn 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
The Stanford football team has a bad case
of the road trip blues, and tomorrow night's
at Arizona State doesn't look like a
cure.
The 3-6 Cardinal has yet to win a game
away from home this season. It has lost on
the road to mediocre teams (Oregon, San
Diego State) and good but troubled teams
(USC, Washington).
And at 5:15 tomorrow it will line up on the
home turf of a Rose Bowl contender. Arizona
State is 7-2 overall — 4-1 in the conference
— and needs two more wins and a UCLA loss
to qualify for its first-ever trip to Pasadena.
Considering how important the game is to
ASU, and considering that the young, quick
Sun Devils are 5-0 at home, the Stanford road
crew could very well be looking at a rough
night in the Arizona desert and a quiet flight
home Saturday night.
New Coach John Cooper has won over the
disgruntled Arizona State fans by ditching
Darryl Rogers' blitz-a-minute defense and in
stalling a more percentage-based scheme on
both offense and defense. The strategy has
produced a string of wins for the Sun Devils,
including a stunning 36-7 defeat of Washing
ton on Saturday.
"I don't think we blitzed once in the Wash
ington game," Cooper said. "Our defensive
philosophy is based on zone coverages,

keeping the ball in front, playing the correct
pursuit angles, things like that. In this day
and age, you face so many offensive sets that
we have enough trouble executing our as
signments out of the base defense. You want
to keep it simple."
Simple, and simply devastating. The Sun
Devil defense has allowed only 13 touch
downs this season (Stanford has given up 33).
Arizona State has intercepted 25 passes, 11
in its last two games, and recorded 32 quar
terback sacks.
The two major forces on the ASU defense
are All-America safety David Fulcher and
inside linebacker Greg Battle. Fulcher, a 6-
foot-3, 224-pound junior, roams all over the
field, supporting the run (68 tackles) and get
ting in the way of passes (five interceptions).
Battle has 105 tackles on the season and is a
near-lock for All-Pacific 10 Conference
honors.
On the offensive side of the board, Arizona
State hasn't been dominating, but then again,
it hasn't had to be.
The Sun Devils were hurt by the early
season loss of 1,000-yard rusher Darryl
Clack, who beat Stanford defenders on two
long touchdown plays in last year's 28-14
ASU win. Fullback Vince Amoia and tailbacks
Mike Crawford and Darryl Harris have shared
the load in Clack's absence — each back has
run for over 300 yards this season.

Last week against Oregon State, Stanford introduced a new formation into its attack — the fullhouse backfield
— to better exploit the talents of fullback Brad Muster.
been amazing — .56 completion percentage, nine in
terceptions — but he's thrown for 1,716 yards this
season. His favorite target is split end Aaron Cox, who
has pulled in 32 passes for 612 yards.
Stanford's biggest challenge will be to establish a
balanced offensive attack against ASU's formidable

defense. That's where the three-fullback formation
Coach Jack Elway used so extensively in last
weekend's win over Oregon State comes in.
With Brad Muster, Brian Morris and Marshall Dillard
lining up behind quarterback John Paye, the Cardinal
should be able to bang out enough rushing yardage to
keep ASU honest. And if the offensive line can hold up
the Sun Devils' four-man rush, Paye should have the
time to work the short passing game.
It worked in Stanford Stadium last weekend. Now
let's see if the Cardinal can take its show on the road.
