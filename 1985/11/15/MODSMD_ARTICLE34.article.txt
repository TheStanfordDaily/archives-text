# Spikers Host Arizona, Then Go to Stockton
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
The No. 1-ranked Stanford women's vol
leyball team will face its strongest challenge
of the season this weekend as it plays three
games in as many days against some of the
nation's finest teams.
Arizona — a team that is much better than
its 1-5 Pac-West record indicates — travels
to Maples Pavilion tonight for a 7:30 p.m.
match that will be the Cardinal's last confer
ence match.
The Arizona match will also be the Card
inal's last home match and the last chance for
local fans to see the team this season unless
Stanford is selected to host one of the NCAA
regionals in December.
Following tonight's match, the Cardinal
travels to Stockton to play against the highly
ranked trio of the University ;of the Pacific,
UCLA and San Jose State in the prestigious
Wendy's Classic tomorrow and Sunday.
Arizona has not won a Pac-West match in a
month, but it has compiled a 14-3 non
conference record this season, and Cardinal
Co-coach Don Shaw is not about to take the
Wildcats lightly.
"You've got to consider what region
they're in," he said. "You have to respect a
team that has a winning record playing those
kind of teams."
On Oct. 19 the Cardinal witnessed just
how well Arizona is capable of playing. That
afternoon in Tucson the Wildcats forced the
No. 1 Cardinal into a fifth game before losing
by scores of 15-9, 10-15, 15-5, 13-15, 15-9.
Arizona has been paced throughout the
season by senior Melissa McLinden, one of
the nation's top players, according to Shaw.
McLinden, who toured with the U.S. Na
tional team last year, is currently ranked
eighth in the country in hitting with a .367
percentage. She also leads the Wildcats in
blocking with 20 solos and 66 assists.

"She's one of the best players in the na
tion," Shaw said. "Once the season's over, I
have a feeling that she'll rejoin the national
team."
The Wendy's Classic will feature three op
ponents that are hungry for a victory against
the Cardinal. UOP, UCLA and San Jose are
a combined 0-5 against Stanford this season.
The tournament is set up in a semi-final
format, and the Cardinal's opening match is
against UCLA at 5:30 p.m. tomorrow. UOP
and San Jose will follow at 7:30.
Stanford and UCLA have played twice this
season with the most recent match last
Friday when the Cardinal swept the Bruins in
Los Angeles, 15-11, 15-12, 15-5.
UCLA, 22-4 overall and 5-2 in the Pac-
West, defeated the Cardinal in last year's
NCAA championship but was unable to win a
single game this season against Stanford.
Senior Liz Masakayan leads the Bruins and
the nation with 375 kills. However, in last
Friday's match, the Cardinal held her to a
.250 hitting percentage.
Shaw indicated that the Cardinal must con
trol Masakayan again in order to notch,its
third victory over UCLA this season. "She
averages 49 total attempts a match," he said.
"You know that she carries a bulk of the
load."
Should the Cardinal defeat the Bruins in
the semifinals, its opponent in the finals
would most likely be the host team, UOP.
The Tigers, who narrowly lost to Stanford
in early October at Maples, have a reputation
for enthusiastic home crowds. "At home they
(UOP) are especially tough," Shaw said.
"This tournament is a big thing for them."
UOP has women's volleyball's next
emerging superstar in freshman Elaina Oden,
the younger sister of Stanford's Kim Oden.
Oden leads the Tigers in hitting (350 kills for
a .365 percentage) and blocking (37 solos and
92 assists).
Senior Julie Maginot tops UOP
defensively with 275 digs. Oden has 272 digs
on the season.
