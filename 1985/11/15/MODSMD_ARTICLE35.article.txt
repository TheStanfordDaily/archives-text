# Hockey Playoffs Start Today

Stanford's field hockey team is a long
way from home today â€” way out in
Evanston, 111., preparing for tomor
row's first-round NCAA playoff match
against the lowa Hawkeyes.
Most likely, team members are trying
to keep their minds off the contest.
After all, none of the Cardinal players
has ever participated in NCAA post
season competition. In fact, no Cardinal

team in the entire history of the field
hockey program has ever played as one
of the nation's 12 elite squads that take
part in the annual NCAA tournament.
Tomorrow's 11 a.m. match at North
western University will pit the 10-3-1
Cardinal against its toughest competi
tion since its preseason swing through
the East. That road trip included games
against what were the country's No. 1
and 3 teams, Old Dominion and North
Carolina.
lowa is ranked No. 3 now. Should
Stanford win tomorrow's match, it will

face the Northwestern Wildcats, who
are currently ranked No. 1.
Although identically ranked teams did
beat them in those preseason games,
the Cardinal players are not intimidated
by the NCAA poll's great respect for
lowa and Northwestern, and for good
reason.
Last year, both teams included Stan
ford on western road trips midway
through the season. The Cardinal beat
lowa 2-1 in double overtime. The score
was the same against Northwestern,
