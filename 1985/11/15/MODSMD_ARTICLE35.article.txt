# Hockey Playoffs Start Today

### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Stanford's field hockey team is a long
way from home today â€” way out in
Evanston, 111., preparing for tomor
row's first-round NCAA playoff match
against the lowa Hawkeyes.
Most likely, team members are trying
to keep their minds off the contest.
After all, none of the Cardinal players
has ever participated in NCAA post
season competition. In fact, no Cardinal

team in the entire history of the field
hockey program has ever played as one
of the nation's 12 elite squads that take
part in the annual NCAA tournament.
Tomorrow's 11 a.m. match at North
western University will pit the 10-3-1
Cardinal against its toughest competi
tion since its preseason swing through
the East. That road trip included games
against what were the country's No. 1
and 3 teams, Old Dominion and North
Carolina.
lowa is ranked No. 3 now. Should
Stanford win tomorrow's match, it will

face the Northwestern Wildcats, who
are currently ranked No. 1.
Although identically ranked teams did
beat them in those preseason games,
the Cardinal players are not intimidated
by the NCAA poll's great respect for
lowa and Northwestern, and for good
reason.
Last year, both teams included Stan
ford on western road trips midway
through the season. The Cardinal beat
lowa 2-1 in double overtime. The score
was the same against Northwestern,

except the Wildcats were the ones
who recorded the winning goal,
again in double overtime.
Stanford Coach Sheryl Johnson
does not expect that this year's
Hawkeyes will be significantly dif
ferent from last year's. "I have a
feeling that they're the same
team," Johnson said.
Johnson doesn't see Northwest
ern as having changed much either.
"They're both good teams," she
said, "but we're good, too."

Johnson said this fall's Cardinal is
without a doubt a stronger team
than the one that did so well against
those same opponents last fall. She
attributes this improvement in
great part to Stanford's "five super
freshman recruits."
One of these freshmen was
Karen Jones, the Northern Pacific
Conference's top goalkeeper during
the regular season. Jones allowed
only five goals in eight conference
matches for a goals-against average
of .63 per game.
Jones admitted that she did not
come into the Stanford program ex
pecting to be in the cage for a team

playing in the NCAA playoffs. "I
had no idea (that the squad might
make the tournament)," Jones said.
"I knew the team would be good,
but not this good."
Johnson feels that the Cardinal
has good reason to be confident.
"We have as good a chance as any
of these teams," she said. "We're
playing well right now, we're on a
streak."
Stanford's nine-game streak
could come to a quick end, though.
"We all know that this is it," co
captain Suzanne Doi said. .
"It's just being ready to play, and
we're ready," she said.
