# Kostoff, Stanford Kick Off Another Swimming Year
## 
### AMY FRANCETIC 
Remember those guys who kept coming to class in
the morning with wet hair this spring?
They're the ones who swam so fast in April they
won the NCAA swimming championship, breaking a
few American/United States Open records in the
process. They're also one of the best kept secrets on
the Stanford campus.
Tomorrow at 3 p.m., men's swim Coach Skip Ken
ney will unveil the 1985-86 version of the Cardinal
swim team at DeGuerre Pool against the University of
Texas. The Longhorns, ranked No. 3 in the
nation, should proved to be a good litmus test
for the similarly talented Cardinal. Stanford enters the
competition as the country's No. 1 team.
After a stellar performance last year, Kenney's
squad will be looking for a win and maybe a little
recognition in the process.
Stanford won eight out of 16 events at the NCAA
Championship meet last year, and the team easily
dominated its Division I opponents. Certain acclaim
should come with that accomplishment.
However, little does anyone know that it was

the second team in the history of Stanford swimming to
win that title. It also won the conference meet for
the fourth year in a row and, for the third consecutive
year, it was undefeated in dual meet competition.
This year's co-captains, John Moffet and Jim
Reynolds, acknowledged that last year's victory was a
surprise. They just went out and had a good time, and
they feel the same way about their upcoming chal
lenges.
But the best part for Stanford is that nearly all of the
members of last year's NCAA championship team
return this year. Moreover, 19 incoming freshmen are
expected to contribute.
Kenney, now in his seventh year at Stanford, hopes
to work on consistency in 1985-86. "If everyone
reaches their potential and swims fast, the winning will
come automatically," he said.
Kenney is looking to the frosh to strengthen the
shorter events and admits that "they're inexperienced
internationally, but their enthusiasm makes up for it."
Yet with almost all of the NCAA championship swim
mers returning, Kenney feels the teamwork bond will
be an added boost to morale.
