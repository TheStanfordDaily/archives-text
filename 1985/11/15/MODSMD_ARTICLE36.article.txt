# Kostoff, Stanford Kick Off Another Swimming Year
## 
### AMY FRANCETIC 
Remember those guys who kept coming to class in
the morning with wet hair this spring?
They're the ones who swam so fast in April they
won the NCAA swimming championship, breaking a
few American/United States Open records in the
process. They're also one of the best kept secrets on
the Stanford campus.
Tomorrow at 3 p.m., men's swim Coach Skip Ken
ney will unveil the 1985-86 version of the Cardinal
swim team at DeGuerre Pool against the University of
Texas. The Longhorns, ranked No. 3 in the
nation, should proved to be a good litmus test
for the similarly talented Cardinal. Stanford enters the
competition as the country's No. 1 team.
After a stellar performance last year, Kenney's
squad will be looking for a win and maybe a little
recognition in the process.
Stanford won eight out of 16 events at the NCAA
Championship meet last year, and the team easily
dominated its Division I opponents. Certain acclaim
should come with that accomplishment.
However, little does anyone know that it was

the second team in the history of Stanford swimming to
win that title. It also won the conference meet for
the fourth year in a row and, for the third consecutive
year, it was undefeated in dual meet competition.
This year's co-captains, John Moffet and Jim
Reynolds, acknowledged that last year's victory was a
surprise. They just went out and had a good time, and
they feel the same way about their upcoming chal
lenges.
But the best part for Stanford is that nearly all of the
members of last year's NCAA championship team
return this year. Moreover, 19 incoming freshmen are
expected to contribute.
Kenney, now in his seventh year at Stanford, hopes
to work on consistency in 1985-86. "If everyone
reaches their potential and swims fast, the winning will
come automatically," he said.
Kenney is looking to the frosh to strengthen the
shorter events and admits that "they're inexperienced
internationally, but their enthusiasm makes up for it."
Yet with almost all of the NCAA championship swim
mers returning, Kenney feels the teamwork bond will
be an added boost to morale.

Senior Jeff Kostoff s off-season training regimen included a rigorous running program designed
by Stanford's cross country coach, Brooks Johnson. Kostoff heads a long list of returnees from
last year's national championship team.
An integral part of last year's champion
ship team was Jeff Kostoff, who will be back
this year.
When he's not listening to his many al
bums, tasting wine, leading a Bible study or
philosophizing on the meaning of life, Kos
toff trains to be one of the top collegiate
swimmers in the country.
A junior, Kostoff first got his feet wet at
the age of five at a local country club and
since then has painted quite a colorful
collage of swimming accomplishments.
While attending high school in his
hometown of Upland, Kostoff captured 12
U.S. national titles.
He currently holds two American
records — the 1,650 meter freestyle with a
time of 14:38.22 set two years ago and the
400 individual medley record of 3:46.54 set
in April at the NCAA Championships, his best

performance to date. The 400 individual
medley includes four laps each of butterfly,
backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle.
Kostoff accomplished all this despite
health problems — a recurring peritonsular
abcess — which he felt slowed him down
quite a bit in the middle of the season. But
as his motto is "Shit happens, you gotta
deal with it," Kostoff looks toward the new
year enthusiastically.
He has begun a new training regiment.
Kostoff runs with the cross country team in
the afternoon under the supervision of
track and cross country Coach Brooks
Johnson, and he swims four mornings a
week with Kenney.
Kenney says these rigorous workouts
are "a great combination, exactly what
(Kostoff) needs since he has virtually no
pain threshhold and likes to do things no
one else has done."
Originally just hoping to run a race with
the team, Kostoff is currently the seventh
man on the cross country squad. He says

his last race in Wisconsin "was a blast. I was
psyched and it was fun."
Johnson explains that Kostoffs running
"should compliment and supplement his
swimming, it shouldn't interfere with it.
He's getting a lot out of it. He's also a role
model for the rest of the athletes. He
shows how important it is to be tough
competitively."
Johnson calls Kostoff "the consummate
competitor. People run better than him in
practice, but you never know what he'll do
in a race. He's a great competitor."
Kostoff trains day by day. He works hard
when he can, and makes adjustments ac
cordingly.
With a major in philosophy and history,
Kostoff hopes to go into secondary school
teaching and coaching after graduation. But
until then, he's got his hands full juggling his
swimming, running, school work and
leisure activities.
And tomorrow, he wants to give the
Longhorns a lesson.
