# No. 1 Polo Can Clinch Pacific 10 Title at Cal
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff writer 
Each of the last two times the Stanford water polo
team has faced UC-Berkeley, the Bears have walked
away with a victory. If the No. 1 Cardinal has its way
this afternoon at Cal, that will happen no more.
The Cardinal, 20-4 overall, could capture the Pacific
10 Conference league title with a victory today, but the
major incentive for Stanford goes beyond Pac-10 title.
"If we can maintain our top national ranking, we will
enter the NCAA Championships with the top seed,"
Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti said. "The top seed
draws a berth against the bottom seed in the first
round, which is a major advantage in the tournament
and can have an affect on the final outcome. At this
point in the season, we are focusing not on the Pac 10
standings but on our hopes for the top seeding."
Cal, on the other hand, will most certainly be focus
ing on the conference standings today. Winless in the
Pac-10, the No. 5 Bears need two victories over Stan
ford in the next two weekends in order to move up
from the bottom depths of the conference rankings.
"Berkeley is in a 'must-win' situation against us and
should be extremely motivated to knock off the No. 1
team," Dettamanti said. "The most difficult part of the
match will probably be our attitude versus theirs. Cal
has been tapering all week for this match, and they nor
mally don't taper until the week before NCAAs, so I
know they are concerned about this match."
Even though Berkeley is in a must-win situation,
that certainly does not guarantee a victory for the
Bears. In the same situation last weekend, the Bears
fell to USC 9-7.
Stanford on the other hand, though not in a tight sit

uation, can certainly emerge with a victory if the team
is "executing in prime form. According to Detta
manti, the Cardinal is "very motivated and plans to get
out to a strong start by putting some doubt in
Berkeley's mind from the very beginning.
Dettamanti said that although the Bears sport a 14-7
record, the talent on their team should have made for a
more successful season. Indeed, Cal began the season
as the country's preseason No. 1 team. J .r.i
Despite the graduation of Alan Gresham and goalie
Sean Cleary, Berkeley still possesses one of the finest
teams in the nation in terms of overall talent.
"I think Berkeley possesses more sheer talent than
any team in the nation, but so far this season, they
have not been able to put it all together,' Dettamanti
said. "With the speed of Olympian Matt Biondi and
Colin Thompson and the scoring ability of Bill Schoen
ing, Berkeley has the potential to be a very dangerous
opponent."
In the goal for the Bears will be sophomore Jeff
Brush, a member of the Junior National Team. Accord
ing to Dettamanti, the Cardinal is "somewhat con
cerned" about Brush's talent, but Stanford's freshman
goalie Todd Kemp should likewise concern the Bears.
"Todd (Kemp) has never played against Berkeley
and since they don't know him as a goalie, that could be
a definite advantage for him," Dettamanti said.
The Cardinal's 6-5 play could also be an advantage
for Stanford if the team performs well in its man-up sit
uations. According to Dettamanti, the 6-s's usually
decide the game in the Stanford-Cal match-ups, and so
far this season, Stanford's 6-5 is somewhat stronger
than Cal's.
"It we can capitalize on our 6-s's and execute all the
basics, we can win this match," Dettamanti."We are
virtually at full strength right now."

Jaime Velez's powerful shot has been on the money 39 times already this year for Stanford, the
country's No. 1 ranked team. He is second on the team in goals, trailing only Craig Klass, who
