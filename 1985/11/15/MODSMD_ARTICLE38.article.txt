Tomorrow th 6 Stanford's men's and
women's cross country teams will per
form in their most important meets of
the 1985 season â€” the NCAA District 8
Championships in Seattle, Wash.
The women, who triumphed in this
meet last year in Tuscon, Ariz., are
heavy favorites again this year. The
men, despite a seventh-place finish last
year on the Arizona layout, are also be
favored to emerge victorious.
The Cardinal's upset victory two
weeks ago at the Pacific 10 Champion
ships held on the Stanford Golf Course

earned the team one of the top seeds in
tomorrow's race.
The Cardinal squads are looking to
finish among the top two teams in
Seattle. If either the men or the women
can finish in the top two, they will se
cure a berth in the NCAA Championship
meet to be held in Milwaukee, Wis., on
Nov. 25.
If Coach Brooks Johnson sticks with
the same runners he has used in this
season's previous events, Stanford's
men's team will consist of of Marc
Olesen, Ryan Stoll, Jeff Atkinson,
James Alborough, Brian Pettingill and
Steve Schadler. The women will feature
Regina Jacobs, Alison Wiley, Kathy
Smith, Kim Stevens, Michelle Mason
and Stacey Zartler.
