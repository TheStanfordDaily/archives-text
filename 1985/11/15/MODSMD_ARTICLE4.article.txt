# Kennedy Urges Release of Police Findings
## Disclosure can 'alleviate disquiet' on campus 
### DAVID RISSER Editorial staff 
Allegations of police brutality at North County
Jail last month can be addressed if the Santa
Clara County Sheriffs Office will make public its
investigation of the incident, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy said in a letter to that
agency.
"Otherwise, there will remain a prevailing
sense of deep distress throughout the commu
nity," Kennedy wrote in a Nov. 13 letter to
Sheriff Robert Winter released yesterday.
In the Oct. 11 incident, senior Robby Perkins
was taken to the jail and strip-searched following

his arrest at an anti-apartheid sit-in at Old Union.
Perkins has said he was beaten by Santa Clara
County sheriffs deputies before being released
the following day.
Kennedy called a University-commissioned
report by Law Prof. John Kaplan examining the
incident "fair and balanced" but said that a
sheriffs office investigation can more success
fully explore the events in the North County Jail.
"Robby Perkins, the only black student ar
rested, was also the only one strip-searched and
the only one who emerged from the jail with new
bruises," Kennedy said in the letter.
Kaplan was unable to reveal events at the

jail completely due to "statutory constraints"
on police officers, Kennedy .wrote.
"Only a full and open account, either
demonstrating that there was no improper con
duct or acknowledging and correcting any im
proprieties, can alleviate the disquiet on the
campus," he said in the letter.
"It is a matter of grave concern to me per
sonally whenever there is a possibility that any
Stanford student may have been injured because
of an official transgression."
Perkins has said he plans to file a lawsuit
against the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office.
