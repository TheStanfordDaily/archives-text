# Swirvin' Irvin Pastes Up Winners
## Back from brink of death, he picks AF in snow bowl 
### 
With the Stickney's Hick'ry
House-Stanford Daily "Be the
Guest Greek" contest running
strong this week, the Daily Greeks
put it on the line for the sixth week.
A mediocre 31-29 (.506) week
dropped the Daily prognosticators
to an overall mark of 188-112
(.627).
University President Donald
Kennedy suffered from an upset
plagued week, finishing with a 5-5
mark. Kennedy, who called his pre
vious record "impeccable," was
forced to settle for middle-of-the
road this time around.
This week's Guest Greek is Paul
IrvitM of the ASSU Typesetting
Shopl A celebrated wielder of the
Exacto knife who has achieved
nedr-legendary status in not a few
venues, Irvin has been working on
production of The Daily since 1982.
Pleading ignorance of college
football (like many so chosen), Irvin
nonetheless came up with a
credible set of picks that should
raise the current 29-21 (.580)
record of the Guest Greeks.
One of only two Greeks to
pick Stanford over Arizona State,
Irvin picked Notre Dame over Penn
State "because I'm rooming with a
Catholic," Montana State over
Washington State "because it's
warmer in Washington and Montana

State will appreciate it,"and
Bowling Green State University
over Toledo "because I hate
Toledo."
Columnist John Lis continues to
lead the race for the case of Henry
Weinhard's Private Reserve with a
37-13 (.740) record, though Sports
Editor Pete Haven (34-16, .680)
turned in a 7-3 week to pull within
three games with two weeks to go.
Haven, you may recall, set a
Daily record for typographical er
rors yesterday by misspelling
"jury" three times in agate and
overlooking the two intramural
playoff victories of B League quar
terfinalist Dosa Beta (7-1), some
thing Lis and Card Today Editor
Tom Senf noticed immediately.
Managing Editor Clint Highfill, who
proofed Haven's copy, asserted
late last night that jury is spelled
"gerrie" and capitalized on second
reference in OATQ. Editor in Chief
Troy Eid, who never reads agate at
all, promptly fired himself out of
personal loyalty to all concerned.
Sports Editor Rob Graham took
sole possession of third at 30-20
(.600), while Senf, CT Editor Erik
Eselius and football writer Geoff
Sanborn are tied at 29-21 (.580).
Sanborn, the pride of Beta Theta
Pi, dropped from second place with
a miserable 2-8 performance.
