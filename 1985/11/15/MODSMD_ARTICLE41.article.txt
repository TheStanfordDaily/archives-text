700 S. African Strikers Arrested
SOWETO, South Africa — More than 700 striking black hospital
workers were arrested by riot police and troops here yesterday as
they demonstrated for higher wages in a new challenge to South
Africa's white minority government.
When the police moved to detain seven of the strike's leaders
outside Baragwanath Hospital, the main medical facility of Soweto,
Johannesburg's sprawling black sister city, hundreds of student
nurses, clerks, cooks, porters, janitors and other workers refused to
disperse and came forward to be arrested.
The peaceful confrontation, signaling the mounting restiveness of
black workers over low pay and the growing readiness to take strike
action, even against the state, appeared to take the police by
surprise as they struggled to arrest all those surging forward, chant
ing anti-government slogans and singing freedom songs.
The 718 who were arrested were charged with taking part in an il
legal strike and in an illegal gathering. They were released on their
own recognizance.
In Cape Town yesterday, President Pieter Botha reiterated his of
fer to include black representatives in the central government for the
first time by appointing them to the President's Council. The council
is a parliamentary body that resolves legislative disputes, advises the
president and is currently drafting many of the country's political,
economic and social reforms.
Sharon Apology Saves Coalition
JERUSALEM — A collapse of Israel's 14-month-old "national
unity" coalition government was averted early today when Prime
Minister Shimon Peres accepted a revised letter of apology from his
controversial trade minister, Ariel Sharon, for criticizing recent
peace initiatives.
At a midnight press conference, Sharon, who had threatened to
bring the fragile coalition government down over his feud with
Peres, said, "The crisis is over." In a major retreat following two
days of intense rhetorical battle with Peres, Sharon, whose enjoys
wide personal support because of his hawkish views, pledged his
support of the unity government.
His letter was understood to have retracted the substance of the
major points of criticism he had leveled at Peres early this week, in
cluding the charge that Peres was willing to negotiate with the
Palestine Liberation Organization and return the occupied Golan
Heights to Syria.
Deputy Prime Minister Yitzhak Navon said after a meeting of
Labor Alignment ministers that if Sharon renews his attacks on
Peres, the letter of dismissal that Peres drafted yesterday would be
served on Sharon.
"I don't think it will happen again," Navon said, "but if it does, we
won't need all these negotiations. The letter of dismissal will be sent,
and that will be that."
Sharon's decision followed a day of intense political negotiations
between him and Peres' representatives, as the government ap
peared on the verge of collapse.
Envoy 'In Touch' With Captors
BEIRUT, Lebanon — A Church of England envoy said yesterday
that he was "in touch" with the captors of four Americans held
hostage in Lebanon and his effort to arrange their release was
progressing.
Terry Waite, a lay representative of Archbishop of Canterbury
Robert Runcie, arrived in the Lebanese capital Wednesday. He told
reporters asking yesterday about his contacts with the Moslem
Shiites believed to be holding the Americans: "We are in touch in
several ways. Progress is being made, and we are moving forward."
Waite, who has negotiated the release of Britons held in Iran and
Libya, warned the reporters that if they followed him as he moved
around Beirut it could block his efforts and endanger the lives of him
self and the hostages.
"I would like to make a plea that I'm not to be followed by anybody
because if that happens then it might jeopardize my own safety and
the safety of other people. It is extremely important because of the
great, great sensitivity of the situation that I am left totally alone be
cause anything I have to do beyond this point would have to be en
tirely by myself."
Yurchenko Criticizes CIA
MOSCOW — KGB officer Vitaly Yurchenko ridiculed and con
demned the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency yesterday and said
CIA agents tried to intercept him at the gates of the Soviet Embassy
the night he escaped from his guard.
Yurchenko, leading a pre-summit Soviet chorus of accusations that
the United States was guilty of "state terrorism" against him, said
the CIA had fabricated a story that he defected only after his
mistress in Canada spurned his proposal that she defect with him.
Yurchenko, described by the CIA as a defector who invented false
charges of kidnapping and torture against the agency when he
decided to return to the Soviet Union last week, was the star of a
Moscow news conference that added fresh details to his sensational
account.
Western diplomats said that the timing of the news conference,
five days before President Reagan is to meet Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev in Geneva, was not a good omen for success at the sum
mit, the first between the superpowers in six years.
Election Date May Move
MANILA, Philippines — Political Affairs Minister Leonardo Perez
said yesterday the ruling KBL Party will be flexible on the date of
early presidential elections, the strongest indication yet that the vote
will not take place Jan. 17 as proposed by President Ferdinand
Marcos.
Perez, who heads the parliamentary committee on revision of
laws, said that the date will depend on how soon Parliament passes
the election bill. It now calls for filing of candidacies Dec. 2 and a 45-
day campaign.
"We (the KBL and the opposition) merely agreed to be flexible on
the date, but it should not be later than the first week in February,"
Perez said.
Opposition members of parliament are pushing for a series of
changes, including a later election date, to give them more time to
prepare to take on Marcos' formidable political machine.
Marcos' party "asked us if we would agree not to include the vice
presidency, and we said no," said Jaime Ferrer, an opposition leader.
The vice presidency presents problems for both sides. If Marcos
chooses a strong figure for the KBL vice presidential slot, he could
face a six-year presidency with an ambitious lieutenant manuevering
for control in the party. If he chooses a political nonentity and were
to die in office, the party would be left in weak hands.

BEIRUT, Lebanon — A Church of England envoy said yesterday
that he was "in touch" with the captors of four Americans held
hostage in Lebanon and his effort to arrange their release was
progressing.
Terry Waite, a lay representative of Archbishop of Canterbury
Robert Runcie, arrived in the Lebanese capital Wednesday. He told
reporters asking yesterday about his contacts with the Moslem
Shiites believed to be holding the Americans: "We are in touch in
several ways. Progress is being made, and we are moving forward."
Waite, who has negotiated the release of Britons held in Iran and
Libya, warned the reporters that if they followed him as he moved
around Beirut it could block his efforts and endanger the lives of him
self and the hostages.
"I would like to make a plea that I'm not to be followed by anybody
because if that happens then it might jeopardize my own safety and
the safety of other people. It is extremely important because of the
great, great sensitivity of the situation that I am left totally alone be
cause anything I have to do beyond this point would have to be en
tirely by myself."
Yurchenko Criticizes CIA
MOSCOW — KGB officer Vitaly Yurchenko ridiculed and con
demned the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency yesterday and said
CIA agents tried to intercept him at the gates of the Soviet Embassy
the night he escaped from his guard.
Yurchenko, leading a pre-summit Soviet chorus of accusations that
the United States was guilty of "state terrorism" against him, said
the CIA had fabricated a story that he defected only after his
mistress in Canada spurned his proposal that she defect with him.
Yurchenko, described by the CIA as a defector who invented false
charges of kidnapping and torture against the agency when he
decided to return to the Soviet Union last week, was the star of a
Moscow news conference that added fresh details to his sensational
account.
Western diplomats said that the timing of the news conference,
five days before President Reagan is to meet Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev in Geneva, was not a good omen for success at the sum
mit, the first between the superpowers in six years.
Election Date May Move
MANILA, Philippines — Political Affairs Minister Leonardo Perez
said yesterday the ruling KBL Party will be flexible on the date of
early presidential elections, the strongest indication yet that the vote
will not take place Jan. 17 as proposed by President Ferdinand
Marcos.
Perez, who heads the parliamentary committee on revision of
laws, said that the date will depend on how soon Parliament passes
the election bill. It now calls for filing of candidacies Dec. 2 and a 45-
day campaign.
"We (the KBL and the opposition) merely agreed to be flexible on
the date, but it should not be later than the first week in February,"
Perez said.
Opposition members of parliament are pushing for a series of
changes, including a later election date, to give them more time to
prepare to take on Marcos' formidable political machine.
Marcos' party "asked us if we would agree not to include the vice
presidency, and we said no," said Jaime Ferrer, an opposition leader.
The vice presidency presents problems for both sides. If Marcos
chooses a strong figure for the KBL vice presidential slot, he could
face a six-year presidency with an ambitious lieutenant manuevering
for control in the party. If he chooses a political nonentity and were
to die in office, the party would be left in weak hands.
700 S. African Strikers Arrested
SOWETO, South Africa — More than 700 striking black hospital
workers were arrested by riot police and troops here yesterday as
they demonstrated for higher wages in a new challenge to South
Africa's white minority government.
When the police moved to detain seven of the strike's leaders
outside Baragwanath Hospital, the main medical facility of Soweto,
Johannesburg's sprawling black sister city, hundreds of student
nurses, clerks, cooks, porters, janitors and other workers refused to
disperse and came forward to be arrested.
The peaceful confrontation, signaling the mounting restiveness of
black workers over low pay and the growing readiness to take strike
action, even against the state, appeared to take the police by
surprise as they struggled to arrest all those surging forward, chant
ing anti-government slogans and singing freedom songs.
The 718 who were arrested were charged with taking part in an il
legal strike and in an illegal gathering. They were released on their
own recognizance.
In Cape Town yesterday, President Pieter Botha reiterated his of
fer to include black representatives in the central government for the
first time by appointing them to the President's Council. The council
is a parliamentary body that resolves legislative disputes, advises the
president and is currently drafting many of the country's political,
economic and social reforms.
Sharon Apology Saves Coalition
JERUSALEM — A collapse of Israel's 14-month-old "national
unity" coalition government was averted early today when Prime
Minister Shimon Peres accepted a revised letter of apology from his
controversial trade minister, Ariel Sharon, for criticizing recent
peace initiatives.
At a midnight press conference, Sharon, who had threatened to
bring the fragile coalition government down over his feud with
Peres, said, "The crisis is over." In a major retreat following two
days of intense rhetorical battle with Peres, Sharon, whose enjoys
wide personal support because of his hawkish views, pledged his
support of the unity government.
His letter was understood to have retracted the substance of the
major points of criticism he had leveled at Peres early this week, in
cluding the charge that Peres was willing to negotiate with the
Palestine Liberation Organization and return the occupied Golan
Heights to Syria.
Deputy Prime Minister Yitzhak Navon said after a meeting of
Labor Alignment ministers that if Sharon renews his attacks on
Peres, the letter of dismissal that Peres drafted yesterday would be
served on Sharon.
"I don't think it will happen again," Navon said, "but if it does, we
won't need all these negotiations. The letter of dismissal will be sent,
and that will be that."
Sharon's decision followed a day of intense political negotiations
between him and Peres' representatives, as the government ap
peared on the verge of collapse.
