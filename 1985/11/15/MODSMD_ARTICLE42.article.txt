# Volcano Erupts in Colombia, Killing 20,000
## 
### 
BOGOTA, Colombia — An An
dean volcano in western Colombia
erupted early yesterday, melting a
deep snowpack and triggering giant
mud slides and flash floods that
killed an estimated 20,000 people,
authorities said yesterday.
It was the world's most deadly
volcanic disaster since Krakatoa in
Indonesia more than 80 years ago
and.the worst natural disaster in
Colombia's history.
One torrent of mud and rubble
buried 90 percent of Armero, a
riverside town with more than
25,000 inhabitants, said Gov.
Eduardo Alzate of Tolima province.
Alzate estimated that 15,000 to
18,000 people were killed in the
town and outlying villages.
"Thousands of persons trapped
by the sea of mud remained at mid
day in trees, roofs and hilltops,"
said the Bogota newspaper El
Campo. Armero, about 30 miles
east of the Nevado del Ruiz volcano
and about 100 miles west of
Bogota, was a prosperous farming
center.
"Armero Wiped Off the Map,"
said an El Campo headline.
Other towns were flooded by
torrential rivers descending from
the 17,716-font Nevado del Ruiz
volcano, resulting in hundreds and

perhaps thousands of additional
deaths.
El Campo said at least 400 people
were believed dead in the town of
Chinchina, on the volcano's west
ern slope.
According to several accounts,
the volcano had been smoking for
weeks, and the activity increased
sharply on Wednesday. A series of
loud explosions with earth tremors
were reported Wednesday night
and early yesterday. Eruptions sent

up huge clouds of smoke and ash.
Volcanic heat melted the massive
snowpack around the Arenas
crater, one of three craters on the
Nevado del Ruis. The melt-off
flooded the rivers, already swollen
by heavy rains.
A natural dam on the Lagunilla
River gave way above Armero,
releasing the huge mud slide that
swept through the town.
"The town is now like an im
mense black beach," said Fernando

Rivera, a private pilot who flew
over the area yesterday. Others
said the mud was 30 feet deep in
some parts of the town.
Only the top floor of Armero's
four-story hospital was visible
above the mud yesterday.
President Belisario Betancur
flew over the disaster area yester
day morning and took direct com
mand of the rescue operation,
which included the army, police,
Red Cross and civil defense.
Ten helicopters worked through
the day to rescue survivors. Hospi
tals in the area were crowded with
injured persons.
In September a Red Cross com
mission had recommended that the
population be evacuated from the
area below the natural dam on the
Lagonea river. The dam, formed by
avalanches and earth slides, was
about a mile wide.
Alzate, the Tolima provincial
governor, said at that time that "no
immediate risks exist for the in
habitants along the Lagunilla
River."
It was the first eruption of the
Nevado de Ruis since 1847. Its
most deadly previous eruption was
in 1845, when the Lagonea river
flooded and thousands of persons
were killed.
