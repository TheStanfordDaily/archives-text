# Britain, Ireland Reach Agreement
## 
### 
DUBLIN, Ireland — Ireland and Britain ap
proved a historic agreement yesterday giving
this Roman Catholic nation a formal voice in
governing the troubled, Protestant-dominated
British province of Northern Ireland.
Protestant hardliners immediately condemned
the accord as "a recipe for war" and vowed to
withdraw support for the Northern Irish adminis
tration.
The pact was endorsed at separate meetings
of the Irish and British Cabinets and is expected
to be signed by Prime Ministers Margaret

Thatcher of Britain and Garret FitzGerald of
Ireland at a summit today in an undisclosed loca
tion.
It is the most important initiative on Northern
Ireland since 1974, and is designed to help pacify
a strife-torn region where more than 2,450
people have been killed since a centuries-old
Catholic-Protestant conflict flared anew in 1969.
Officials in Britain and Ireland have refused to
disclose more than the outlines of the plan. But it
appears largely to formalize a relationship that

has existed in practice for years.
It gives Ireland a consultative role — thus far
not publicly defined — in Northern Ireland's af
fairs. Irish and British press reports said the
republic's government would maintain an office
in the area of Belfast, Northern Ireland's capital,
where members of the Catholic minority can
bring their grievances against the Protestant-led
administration.
Ireland, in return, is to acknowledge British
sovereignty over Northern Ireland as long as the
Protestant majority so wishes.
