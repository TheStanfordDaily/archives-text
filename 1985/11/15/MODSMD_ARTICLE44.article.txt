Congress OKs Credit
WASHINGTON — The House yesterday
gave final approval to interim legislation raising
federal borrowing authority — the national
debt limit — to $1.9 trillion.
With no debate and only about two dozen
members present, the House, on a voice vote,
approved the legislation that postpones a
credit crunch through Dec. 6 by raising the
government's $1,824 trillion line of credit by
$80 billion. It now goes to the White House for
President Reagan's expected signature.
The Senate passed the measure on a voice
vote Wednesday night.
Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-
Kan.) said the action would "relieve the presi
dent of any burden while he was at the sum
mit" next week with Soviet leader Mikhail Gor
bachev.
Without action, the government would have
been in default. The president had ordered
federal agencies to stop issuing new checks
starting today if Congress had not increased
the debt limit.
Attached to the legislation is an extension
until Dec. 15 of the 16-cent-a-pack federal tax
on cigarettes. Congress has not completed ac
tion on pending legislation making the 16-cent
tax permanent and without the extension the
tax would have dropped to 8 cents per pack
after midnight yesterday.
Bacteria Use Approved
WASHINGTON — The Environmental
Protection Agency yesterday approved the
first open-air use of genetically engineered
bacteria, permitting a California company to
test bacteria that appear to protect plants from
frost, but the decision was immediately chal

lenged in court.
Advanced Genetic Sciences of Oakland plans
to spray the bacteria on a small plot of straw
berry plants near Salinas in late December or
January to test whether the material will help
protect plants from frost at temperatures
down to 23 degrees Fahrenheit.
The EPA decision had long been anticipated
by other genetic engineering companies that
hope to cash in on a potentially lucrative
biotechnology market.
Announcing federal approval of the contro
versial experiment, Jack Moore, EPA assistant
administrator for pesticides and toxic sub
stances, said that the products are "very
unlikely to pose unreasonable hazards to man
or the environment."
But critics immediately charged that the
EPA failed to gauge the test's likely impact on
the environment sufficiently. Several ex
pressed fear that the new bacteria could float
into the atmosphere and alter frost formation
in clouds, thus changing weather patterns and
the ecological balance.
AIDS Guidelines
WASHINGTON — The federal govern
ment's new guidelines on AIDS in the
workplace won immediate endorsement yes
terday from public health organizations and
homosexual rights groups as "an extremely ra
tional" approach to the disease.
"This document encompasses our concern
for the physical and emotional care of these
patients, the safety of health care workers and
the welfare of the public," said Eunice Cole,
president of the American Nurses' Associa
tion.
The guidelines, released yesterday by the
Department of Health and Human Services,

recommend against routine blood screening of
employees for AIDS antibodies and against re
strictions on workers known to be ill with the
disease or infected with the virus. The blood
test for antibodies detects exposure to the
virus that causes AIDS, known as HTLV-111,
but does not mean that an individual has or will
develop the disease.
But Rep. William Dannemeyer (R-Calif.)
vowed to continue his fight for legislation that
would forbid AIDS victims from working in the
health care industry.
"The people in the Public Health Service are
erring on the side of protecting the sensitivity
of the victims of AIDS — 75 percent of whom
are male homosexuals — when they should be
erring on the side of protecting the public
health," Dannemeyer said. "Serious consider
ation should be given as to whether or not they
should be permitted to continue in their jobs."
Dannemeyer has introduced five bills
dealing with AIDS, among them a measure
that would eliminate federal funds to hospitals
and other health care facilities that permit
health care personnel with AIDS to practice.
The new national guidelines, which do not
have the force of law but have a considerable
amount of influence within the public health
community, apply to workers in jobs where
there is no known danger of AIDS transmis
sion, as well as to health care professionals and
personal service workers, such as cos
metologists, who may be exposed to the
disease in their jobs.
Market Rallies Again
NEW YORK — The stock market jumped to
new highs yesterday, reviving its recent rally
on the strength of a late outburst of buying.
