# Cal State Ups Requirement Ante
## Only 9 percent of students would be dealt in if they applied now 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior Staff Writer 
Following the trend toward stiffer entrance
requirements for public colleges and univer
sities, the California State University trustees
approved Wednesday tougher admissions stand
ards that more than double the number of high
school courses successful applicants must com
plete.
The decisions came despite protests from
minority groups and others who claimed that
tougher admissions standards, which will go into
effect in 1988, discriminate against poor and
minority students.
Slightly more than 9 percent of current Cal
State students would have met the new stand
ards, which include course requirements in so
cial studies, sciences, arts and foreign languages
and electives.
Trustees and administrators said the require
ments are necessary to combat high dropout
rates in the system. State schools Superintend
ent William Honig, who is a Cal State trustee,
praised the new standards, saying that Cal State
students will be less likely to drop out because
they will be better prepared for college.

Other trustees said the tougher standards will
allow the system to reallocate resources from
remedial to advanced courses.
Minority faculty members in the system com
plained that minority students from inner-city
high schools will stand little chance of gaining ad
mission under the new system. Until inner-city

schools get better teachers and more resources,
students there will not be able to meet the new
requirements, the faculty members charged.
Some students who do not meet the new
standards will still be accepted under special
provisions, but those students will be required to
make up the courses they should have taken in
high school.
The new requirements are similar to stiffer
University of California standards that go into ef
fect this year.
The new Cal State standards require one year
of U.S. history/social studies, four years of En
glish, three years of math, two years of foreign
languages, one year of arts, one year of labora
tory science and four years of other college
preparatory courses. The University of Califor
nia standards do not carry a specific arts require
ment, but they do call for an additional year of
college preparatory study.
Previous Cal State standards required only
that a student finish in the top 30 percent of his
graduating class, based on grade-point averages
and standardized test scores. That requirement
will continue to be a part of the overall standards.
