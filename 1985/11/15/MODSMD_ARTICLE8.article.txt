## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
The Mount Holyoke College board of
trustees announced Saturday its decision
to divest of the college's $14 million of
stock in companies that do business in
South Africa.
"The process [will be] completed no
later than 1987 in a manner consistent
with the board's fiduciary responsibili
ties," according to a statement released

immediately following the meeting in
which the decision was made.
The $14 million in stock represents 100
percent of the college's South Africa
related stock and approximately 17 per
cent of its total endowment, according to
Cathy Skidmore, president of a Mount
Holyoke activist group called Action South
Africa.
The decision came about as a result of
"a combination of student and faculty
pressure," according to Beth Biddle,
editor of the campus newspaper, the
Mount Holyoke News.

In referenda held last Monday, 54 per
cent of students and 90 percent of faculty
members voted for total divestment,
Skidmore said.
Elizabeth Kennan, president of the
South Hadley, Mass., all-women's col
lege, said she was "extremely pleased
that Mount Holyoke College has persued
this matter in a debate . . . and, in the
recent past, discussed the issues fully and
with great respect for the differing views,
so that a genuine consensus could be
drawn among the campus communitv."
