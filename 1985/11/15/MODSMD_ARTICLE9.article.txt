# Indian Mascot Is History
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Staff writer 
"The University has gone on record
that we will never adopt racial or ethnic
symbols, so the Indian is never coming
back," English Prof. Ken Fields said
during a panel discussion yesterday on the
1972 decision to remove the Indian sym
bol as Stanford's mascot for athletic
teams.
The issue remains controversial, ac
cording to Director of University Rela
tions Don Carlson, who joined Fields in
the discussion at Sterling Quad Dining and
Performance Center. "I am still answering
letters from alumni asking when the Indian
will come back," Carlson said. The panel
also featured Asst. Dean of Student Af
fairs James Larimore.
For more than 30 years the athletic
teams' symbol was simply the color card
inal, according to Carlson. Then in 1923,
Dr. T.M. Williams, a 1897 Stanford
graduate, thought of using the Indian as a
symbol. Students initially showed little in
terest in the idea, but in 1930 the ASSU
adopted it as the symbol for athletic teams
while retaining the tree to represent the

whole University, he said.
"At first the students didn't accept (the
Indian)," Carlson said. "Then in 1950,
(UC-Berkeley mascot) Oski the Bear was
a real force at Cal ... so the Stanford
Band adopted the Indian as a mascot."
Timm Williams, a local Yurok Indian,
first danced in costume as the Stanford In
dian at the Big Game Rally in 1951 in ex
change for tickets to the game. He contin
ued to play that role as "Prince Lightfoot"
until 1971, when the controversy over the
mascot reached a head.
"A group of Indian students became
really upset and decided that the Indian
symbol and mascot had to go. They con
vinced the ombudsman that it was an in
sult to them," Carlson said. The students
also met with then-University President
Richard Lyman, who subsequently
abolished the Indian symbol, according to
Carlson.
"One of the first things (University)
President Kennedy did (when he took of
fice) was state that the Indian mascot
would not return," Carlson said.
"Their race and their culture were
being used in a way that could be excused
as innocence in an earlier time."
