Stanford students can gain a
unique glimpse into the futuristic
world of human colonization of Mars
and possible contact with extrater
restrial beings when the presiden
tially appointed National Commis
sion on Space meets here this
week.
The nine-member commission
was "put together to look at the
long-term futures that the country
might pursue in its space pro
grams," according to Electrical En
gineering Prof. Peter Banks, of
Stanford's Star Lab.
Members of the commission in
clude Neil Armstrong, the first
man on the moon; Thomas
Paine, a former NASA administra
tor; Nobel laureate Luis Alvarez;
Gerard O'Neill, developer of the
cities-in-space concept; and Brig.
Gen. Charles Yeager.
The commission is meeting today
in executive session, but meetings
tomorrow and Wednesday are open
to the public. They will be held in
room 450 of the Durand Building
from 8:30 a.m. to about 5:30 p.m.
Banks said he believes the com
mission is "trying to avoid the short
term" decisions about U.S. space
policy, on topics such as the space

shuttle and simple explorations of
space.
Instead, the group is concerned
with manned space stations, the
search for extraterrestrial intelli
gence and human exploration of
Mars.
While the United States will prob
ably launch an unmanned mission to
Mars in 1995 or 1996, the commis
sion is even "looking beyond that to
manned exploration of space,"
Banks said.
The drive for such futuristic con
siderations exists because several
members of the commission are
"keen on interplanetary explora
tion, " according to Banks.
Mars, in particular, is "being tar
geted as a likely place for explora
tion in the future," he said.
The commission is scheduled to
submit a report of its recommen
dations to President Reagan next
year.
Most of the nine commission
members are expected to be pres
ent at the Stanford meetings with
the exception of Jeanne
Kirkpatrick, commission member
and former U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations, who has said she is
unable to attend.
Members of the commission will
have the opportunity to meet with
Stanford scientists at dinners held
during the week.
