# South Africa a Struggle To Regain, Not to Reform
## 
### JOHN CALLON 
The turmoil in South Africa, according to a repre
sentative of the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania
(PAC), represents "not a civil rights struggle . . .
but a struggle to regain land taken in 1652."
Elizabeth Sibeko, a member of PAC's United Na
tions Observer Mission, called native South Africans
a "colonized people" and told students at the Bech
tel International Center Friday that "anybody who
speaks of our struggle as a civil rights struggle is
crazy. . . . We have to have our land first."
Sibeko emphasized that her organization, founded
in 1959, embraces "non-racialism" and is against
what she termed "multi-racialism."
"We only address ourselves to one race â€” the
human race," she said. "We look at loyalty to and
contributions to Africa."
She is attempting to raise funds for refugees from
South Africa who have fled to neighboring states.
She said the money will be used to transport
refugees to states such as Tanzania where they can
"eke out a living."
Sibeko is also sensitive to what she calls per
ceived misrepresentations of the nature of the con
flict in South Africa. She hoped to "explain what the
struggle is all about," and dispel impressions given

by the "racist" Rev. Jerry Falwell and "people
brought to Ted Koppel's (TV program) "Nightline,"
who are already supporting the status quo."
"Falwell goes to South Africa for four days, and
he's suddenly an expert (on South Africa)," she
said.
She took exception with many purported South
African representatives as well, saying that she had
"yet to see a spokesperson" who goes "to the
country to find out" what is happening. "They end
up on the white side of Johannesburg," she said.
More generally, she felt that misinformation has
been pervasive because "we did not write the his
tory. If you look in the books, all wars are called bar
baric wars, fought against the Christian colonizers."
She said such biased language "sugar-coats" the
facts, and pointed to a tradition of oral history as
"the one thing on our side."
PAC is a "mass movement" that has been
recognized by the United Nations, she said, while
the South African government lost such legitimacy
in 1973.
"We are the rightful representatives of our
people. The majority of the millions are under
ground, and they have sent us to speak for them,"
she said. Institutional reform in South Africa is no
longer even an issue, she said. "The time for
talking is over," she said.
