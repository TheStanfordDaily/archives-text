# Despite Urge To Roam, Robinson Makes Stanford Home
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
"What happened to the sun?" asked Norm
Robinson, associate dean of Student Affairs, as
he gazed out his third-floor office window in Old
Union. It was clear that the brisk weather was
going to put a damper on his plans for swimming
that day:
"I try to swim or do something — go for a bike
ride — every day," Robinson said, his tan face
and fit figure belying his age, 42, and his 15 years
of administrative service at Stanford. "If you
asked me to put something at the top of my list
(of things to do), it would be swimming or
traveling. I'm always holding plane tickets to
somewhere. There's some song about two tic
kets to paradise. I haven't been there, but I've
been damn close," Robinson said, calling Hawaii
one of his favorite places.
But Robinson hasn't done much traveling — at
least not for an extended period of time — since
he received his Ph.D. in counseling psychology
from Stanford in 1972.
Since receiving his doctorate, Robinson has
held numerous positions at the University, in
cluding director of the Row and associate dean of
Student Affairs, his post for the past nine years.
Robinson, a native of Worcester, Mass.,
studied on the East Coast before coming to
Stanford, doing his undergraduate work at Bow

doin College in Maine and getting his MBA from
Columbia.
He tried working on Wall Street for a while,
but found that both the financial world and New
York weren't to his liking. He soon found himself
on the way to Stanford.
"It wasn't part of a plan to stay (at Stanford).
In my first year I thought, 'God, get me out of
here. Get me back to the East Coast,' " he said.
But Robinson, who was a resident assistant in
Toy on Hall while a student, was attracted by the
opportunities that California and Stanford pro
vided and became director of the Stanford Insti
tute for Behavioral Counseling in 1970.
His plans to become a psychologist were put
on the back burner when he became director of
Florence Moore Hall in 1971, a position that no
longer exists. That job, which Robinson held for
one year, included the responsibilities now
handled by resident fellows, as well as some ad
ditional administrative work.
Robinson was also appointed director the Row
in 1971, the first person to hold the job as it cur
rently exists. He stayed in the position until
1975. When the position of associate dean of
Student Affairs opened the next year, Robinson
jumped for it.
"How do you get people out of their insulated
environments to think about bigger issues?"
Robinson asked rhetorically. It is the task of
trying "to make people see that Stanford really is
part of the larger world" that keep's Robinson's

interest in students piqued.
"I'm amazed at the number of people who
don't use some of the resources around here,"
he said, adding that for a large number of stu
dents, San Francisco consists of "the three
blocks between the piers and Aquatic Park" —
the path of the annual Big Game rally.
Robinson, on the other hand, loves traveling.
"There's a real joy and sense of adventure that
comes from traveling. . . .You learn to be inde
pendent that way. Learning how you get from
point Ato point Bis fun," Robinson said.
Helping students learn about University policy
decisions is the part of his job Robinson likes
most.
Last week, Robinson, along with Diana Con
klin, director of the Row, addressed a group of
approximately 40 students at Toyon Hall on the
University's alcohol policy. It was one of five or
six meetings Robinson had been to this quarter
to speak specifically on the topic. Sitting cross
legged and wearing a green sweater-vest over a
yellow Oxford shirt, Robinson fielded student
questions with ease.
"He's the most personable person I know,"
said Alice Supton, assistant dean of Residential
Education, who has worked with Robinson for
the past 10 years. "He knows how to make any
body feel at ease," she said.
Conklin called Robinson "wonderful to work

with," adding that "he's very calm
in confrontational situations."
Interfraternity Council President
Donald Galles also praised Robin
son, saying that "everything has
been decidedly positive this quar-

ter. I haven't really had to deal with
him at a point where we disagree,
although I'm sure that will happen."
Robinson, however, is not popu
lar with all members of the frater
nity system. The president of one
fraternity refused to comment on
what he thought of Robinson, stat
ing that what he had to say would be
unprintable.

Robinson was also criticized by
Assoc. History Prof. Kennell
Jackson, the resident fellow in
Branner Hall.
"There is a greater furor today
over the lack of a clear intellectual
agenda for residential education
than I have ever observed, and I
would think that unless Norm
Robinson has some plans for ac

complishing in residences what his
title is about, there will be a move
to create a new office for intellec
tual programs in the residences.
They've yet to produce a distin
guished all-campus, intellectual
program for the residences,"
Jackson said.
Robinson agreed that sometimes
his job isn't so easy. "Maybe the

hardest thing is being misun
derstood or not being understood at
all," he said. People, he explained,
often perceive Stanford as having a
certain position on a subject without
bothering to talk to someone in his
office to find out if it is true.
Robinson has faced — and
weathered — such differences of
opinion in the past. He has no plans

to leave the University, but he is
quick to point out that "I'm not the
person to talk to if you're interested
in planning careers. I'm a strong
advocate of the 'being-in-the-right
place-at-the-right-time' theory."
It seems that for Robinson,
Stanford is the right place for the
time being.

from Stanford in 1972.
Since receiving his doctorate, Robinson has
held numerous positions at the University, in
cluding director of the Row and associate dean of
Student Affairs, his post for the past nine years.
Robinson, a native of Worcester, Mass.,
studied on the East Coast before coming to
Stanford, doing his undergraduate work at Bow

doin College in Maine and getting his MBA from
Columbia.
He tried working on Wall Street for a while,
but found that both the financial world and New
York weren't to his liking. He soon found himself
on the way to Stanford.
"It wasn't part of a plan to stay (at Stanford).
In my first year I thought, 'God, get me out of
here. Get me back to the East Coast,' " he said.
But Robinson, who was a resident assistant in
Toy on Hall while a student, was attracted by the
opportunities that California and Stanford pro
vided and became director of the Stanford Insti
tute for Behavioral Counseling in 1970.
His plans to become a psychologist were put
on the back burner when he became director of
Florence Moore Hall in 1971, a position that no
longer exists. That job, which Robinson held for
one year, included the responsibilities now
handled by resident fellows, as well as some ad
ditional administrative work.
Robinson was also appointed director the Row
in 1971, the first person to hold the job as it cur
rently exists. He stayed in the position until
1975. When the position of associate dean of
Student Affairs opened the next year, Robinson
jumped for it.
"How do you get people out of their insulated
environments to think about bigger issues?"
Robinson asked rhetorically. It is the task of
trying "to make people see that Stanford really is
part of the larger world" that keep's Robinson's

interest in students piqued.
"I'm amazed at the number of people who
don't use some of the resources around here,"
he said, adding that for a large number of stu
dents, San Francisco consists of "the three
blocks between the piers and Aquatic Park" —
the path of the annual Big Game rally.
Robinson, on the other hand, loves traveling.
"There's a real joy and sense of adventure that
comes from traveling. . . .You learn to be inde
pendent that way. Learning how you get from
point Ato point Bis fun," Robinson said.
Helping students learn about University policy
decisions is the part of his job Robinson likes
most.
Last week, Robinson, along with Diana Con
klin, director of the Row, addressed a group of
approximately 40 students at Toyon Hall on the
University's alcohol policy. It was one of five or
six meetings Robinson had been to this quarter
to speak specifically on the topic. Sitting cross
legged and wearing a green sweater-vest over a
yellow Oxford shirt, Robinson fielded student
questions with ease.
"He's the most personable person I know,"
said Alice Supton, assistant dean of Residential
Education, who has worked with Robinson for
the past 10 years. "He knows how to make any
body feel at ease," she said.
Conklin called Robinson "wonderful to work

with," adding that "he's very calm
in confrontational situations."
Interfraternity Council President
Donald Galles also praised Robin
son, saying that "everything has
been decidedly positive this quar-

ter. I haven't really had to deal with
him at a point where we disagree,
although I'm sure that will happen."
Robinson, however, is not popu
lar with all members of the frater
nity system. The president of one
fraternity refused to comment on
what he thought of Robinson, stat
ing that what he had to say would be
unprintable.

Robinson was also criticized by
Assoc. History Prof. Kennell
Jackson, the resident fellow in
Branner Hall.
"There is a greater furor today
over the lack of a clear intellectual
agenda for residential education
than I have ever observed, and I
would think that unless Norm
Robinson has some plans for ac

complishing in residences what his
title is about, there will be a move
to create a new office for intellec
tual programs in the residences.
They've yet to produce a distin
guished all-campus, intellectual
program for the residences,"
Jackson said.
Robinson agreed that sometimes
his job isn't so easy. "Maybe the

hardest thing is being misun
derstood or not being understood at
all," he said. People, he explained,
often perceive Stanford as having a
certain position on a subject without
bothering to talk to someone in his
office to find out if it is true.
Robinson has faced — and
weathered — such differences of
opinion in the past. He has no plans

to leave the University, but he is
quick to point out that "I'm not the
person to talk to if you're interested
in planning careers. I'm a strong
advocate of the 'being-in-the-right
place-at-the-right-time' theory."
It seems that for Robinson,
Stanford is the right place for the
time being.
"What happened to the sun?" asked Norm
Robinson, associate dean of Student Affairs, as
he gazed out his third-floor office window in Old
Union. It was clear that the brisk weather was
going to put a damper on his plans for swimming
that day:
"I try to swim or do something — go for a bike
ride — every day," Robinson said, his tan face
and fit figure belying his age, 42, and his 15 years
of administrative service at Stanford. "If you
asked me to put something at the top of my list
(of things to do), it would be swimming or
traveling. I'm always holding plane tickets to
somewhere. There's some song about two tic
kets to paradise. I haven't been there, but I've
been damn close," Robinson said, calling Hawaii
one of his favorite places.

least not for an extended period of time — since
