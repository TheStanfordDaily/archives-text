						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Talk Arms Control 
### 
The chances that a meaningful arms agreement
will emerge from this week's summit conference
seem to be dwindling rapidly. It is now up to the two
key individuals — President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev — to surprise the world
by sitting down and seriously bargaining and
negotiating on a pact that would reduce nuclear ar
senals and preserve peace.
Undoubtedly, human rights, regional wars and
the cultural exchanges that Reagan discussed in his
address Thursday night are important issues, but
nuclear weapons control must take precedence.
Arms cutbacks must be the central item on the
agenda.
Experts here say that the superpowers have
turned their attention away from arms control,
believing that their differences on that issue are ir
reconcilable. Neither side foresees an arms agree
ment, and both are therefore "positioning through
propaganda" to avoid looking bad for their failure,

according to Coit Blacker, associate director of
Stanford's Center for International Security and
Arms Control.
The time has come to set aside propaganda and
pessimism to get to the heart of the matter —
50,000 nuclear warheads now menace the world,
and new, even more threatening weapons are now
in the research and development stage. Deep cuts
in weapons and a ban on space militarization would
be a start.
If Reagan and Gorbachev could rise above the
rhetoric and pessimistic predictions to negotiate a
meaningful arms control pact, they would come
away looking like geniuses. What better way to
ensure that the other side would negotiate effec
tively than to frighten it with rhetoric? Let us hope
that the hard-line and doubtful opinions expressed
thus far are only setting the stage for sincere
negotiations and are not a sign of things to come.
