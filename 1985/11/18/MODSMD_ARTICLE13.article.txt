# Hoover's Problem Is Its Political Activity
## 
### 
Q: Once an editorial columnist has touched
upon issues ranging from the efficacy of public
execution to the efficiency of sex in space,
where does he go from there?
A: A thoughtful, yet pleasant study of a prob
lem that directly confronts the students and fac
ulty of Stanford. A problem where questions out
number answers and dialogue seems skewed. A
problem called the Hoover Institution and its re
lation to Stanford University.

Q: That's the tall building, right? What's wrong
with the Hoover Institution? Doesn't it house
some of country's most significant documents
concerning war, revolution and peace? They say
Hoover boasts a membership of renowned
scholars, including four Nobel laureates.
A: Hoover, as a library and archive, is not the
problem. It serves an indispensable need both to
the United States and to the Stanford commu
nity. But only one-third of Hoover's activity is
devoted to the library. The other two-thirds of
Hoover's efforts are directed toward political ac
tivities. By associating our university with an in
stitution devoted to political activism, we com
promise the unbiased and free-thinking philoso
phy of Stanford University, and that is the prob
lem.
Q: "Political activities?" Sounds intriguing.
A: To be sure. You see, during the last 25
years, Hoover has slowly evolved into a political
entity that — in association with Stanford Uni

versity — furnishes ideas to political candidates,
assists those candidiates in their campaigns,
helps politicians enact programs and attempts to
influence public opinion.
Q: Can you elaborate a bit?
A: Certainly. The Hoover Institution proved
virtually indispensable to Ronald Reagan's first
presidential campaign. As Reagan said in
Hoover's 1981 report, "during the recent cam
paign, I called on more people from the institu
tion to help with my campaign than from any
other institution." Four years later Reagan con
tinues to receive considerable support from the
institution as a whole. "Politics," explained
Reagan in a 1985 reception for the Hoover Board
of Overseers, "is a battle of ideas, and it was
ideas — many of them originating at the Hoover
Institution — that helped overthrow what
(Hoover Fellow) Milton Friedman has called the
'tyranny of the status quo.' "
Q: You know, I had a feeling you'd sneak
Ronald Reagan in somehow. It's been said that
the loudest critics of Hoover just don't like the
conservatives who profit from its academic re
search. Sounds like an ad homineni argument to
me.
A: I applaud your daring language, but just be
cause a word is Latin doesn't mean it applies.-
Hoover is not inappropriate because it is conser
vative; it is inappropriate because it is politically
active.
Q: But for you isn't that the same thing?
A: Well, let's suppose that instead of funding
studies lauding the effects of nuclear build-up or
reduced federal spending, the Hoover Institution
promoted a more liberal idea — like federally
funded abortions. You'd have a lot of people up
set on this campus; they would say Stanford has
no business associating itself with an entity that
actively engages in political legislation. And
those students would be right. Prof. Alexander

Dallin, a former Hoover fellow, summed it up
best in 1983: "There should be no such thing as
Hoover on any campus that has such political
commitments, be it left, right or sideways."
Q: Still, besides the fact that Stanford's com
mitment to Hoover may be a bit unfair, don't we
as a university profit more by having associations
with such influential Hoover fellows as Milton
Friedman, Edward Teller and Honorary Fellow
Ronald Reagan?
A: Unfortunately, our ties with such a political
body challenge our non-partisan, academic com
mitment in the eyes of many onlookers. On Jan.
26, 1984, the conservative Chicago Tribune
wrote, "Hoover's ideology and growing influence
threaten [Stanford's] reputation for academic
excellence and independence."
Q: Supposing your argument merits consider
ation, haven't University President Donald Ken
nedy and the Faculty Senate already dedicated
themselves to a happy solution?
A: Again, you've hit the nail on the proverbial
head. Don Kennedy, the Ward Committee of
1984, and the Faculty Senate committee of 1985
have consistently focused on Hoover's supposed
ideological bias; they conclude that any improper
bias can soon be ironed out through changes in
administration. But, as professors John Manley
and Ronald Rebholz point out, "The problem
with Hoover is not that it is ideologically conser
vative. The problem with Hoover is that it is
politically active." Hence, we must disassociate
the Stanford name with the political activity of
the Hoover once and for all. So — how was that
for a friendly little dialogue?
Q: Well, it was a bit theoretical. . .
A: I'd add catechitical
Q: And just a bit dogmatic.
A: But you must admit — Socratic.
