## SDI Will Expand Arms Race 
### 
I feel compelled to respond to Jim Suhre's arti
cle (The Daily, Nov. 11) not only because I dis
agree with him, but also because his argument
— that such a "defensive" system would protect
us — has a great intuitive appeal, one that must
be dispelled for reasons I hope to make clear.
Suhre claims that a "Star Wars"-type system,
if deployed, could defend against attacks by ter
rorists or countries like Libya. It is against
precisely these types of attacks, however, that

VIEWPOINT

such a system would be least effective, a point
admitted even by staunch "Star Wars" advocates
in the Pentagon.
Because these groups possess poor technol
ogy, they would not be likely to attack via spa"ce,
where "Star Wars" would work best, but would
attack using, for example, a plane (or some other
endoatmospheric method). It is against weapons
that travel within the atmosphere, like bombers
or cruise missiles, that such a defense would ex
perience great difficulties.
Suhre further asserts that "Star Wars" would
slow down a nuclear war, perhaps allowing
enough time to contemplate stopping it before
the world gets blown up. This flows from his
belief that the "Star Wars" satellites would have
to be attacked first, with a later decision made
about launching missiles. More likely, both would
happen simultaneously. Further, he feels that
"Star Wars" would give the president more time
for decisions. But contrary to his claim, the pres
ident does not have to decide in 10 minutes; the
invulnerability of our submarines gives us as
much time as we'll ever get. "Star Wars" won't
help in this regard.
More importantly, to contradict Suhre again,
the Soviets most certainly will begin building
more missiles if we make it clear that we seek
"Star Wars" with the SDI program (here I distin
guish between the preliminary SDI program and

a deployed "Star Wars" system). Furthermore,
the Soviets will begin this buildup now, not be
cause they think "Star Wars" will work, but be
cause they must hedge aginst the chance that it
might.
As admitted even by the Department of
Defense, a "Star Wars" system could never be
perfect. For this reason, it makes sense that the
Soviets will build both more missiles to try to
overwhelm it and new weapons like cruise
missiles that can circumvent it. These efforts
will seek to ensure that, even if our "defense" is
90 percent effective, they will always have
enough missiles to annihilate America, no matter
what we do.
If this sounds cold blooded, remember that it
is the fact that both sides have the ability to
destroy each other no matter what the other
side does that has kept and continues to keep the
nuclear peace.
If both know that the alternative is total
destruction, they will try their very hardest to
prevent nuclear war. Put in more palatable
terms, it is this mutual hostage relationship that
is the basis of stable deterrence and peace. As
this is the only proven way we have to keep the
peace, we should be very wary of discarding it in
favor of more "moral" methods. Furthermore, if
we try to "rescue" ourselves with an elusive nu
clear shield, we will only put ourselves in much
greater danger.
The above points are critical, for they under
cut Suhre's main argument — that "Star Wars"
could protect the human race from annihilation in
the event of nuclear war. Quite the opposite, in
fact. The increased likelihood of nuclear war that
would result from an arms race in both offensive
and "defensive" weapons, combined with the
fact that a war would still be highly destructive
(the result of more missiles and imperfect
defenses), means that the human race would be
in more danger than ever.
This is even more evident if one questions
assumption that extinguishing the human

race takes significantly more destructive power
than it takes to destroy either the United States
or the Soviet Union. If this assertion were true,
then a "Star Wars" system that couldn't protect
America could still be valuable if it protected
humanity. The existing evidence, though highly
incomplete, suggests that the difference may not
be so great. At the very least, the great amount
of uncertainty surrounding this point should
bring caution in using arguments based on it.
With these considerations made, Suhre's point
that "Star Wars" could provide protection against
an accidental or unauthorized launch is also
weakened as a rationale. Is it "moral" to try to
protect a few million people when in doing so you
greatly increase the chances of human extinc
tion? Reading his article, I think even Jim Suhre
would agree that it isn't.
A space-based "defense," if deployed, would
only endanger us. Furthermore, proceeding with
a "research program" that also includes opera
tional testing only stimulates an expanded arms
race. Once operationally tested, it is much easier
to deploy a system and much harder to be sure
that it isn't being deployed. By pursuing the SDI
program as currently structured, therefore, we
could put ourselves in just as much danger as if
we had actually deployed a system. This is why I
have put the word "defense" in quotes through
out this letter. Something can only be considered
defensive if it makes people safer. These pro
grams should not be labelled what they are not
— defenses — but instead what they are —
threats.
I agree with Suhre when he says"I must try
to avoid death by backing the policies I see as
most able to keep me alive." That is why I
oppose the current SDI program and the "Star
Wars" system that it seeks. The way to ensure
peace is not through the continued acquisition of
weapons.
