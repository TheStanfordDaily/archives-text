## SDI Won't Protect 
### 
In his article, " 'Star Wars"
Insures Against Annihilation" (The
Daily, Nov. 11), columnist Jim
Suhre argues in support of the
Reagan Administration's plans for
development and deployment of the
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI).
He says it is Reagan's "dream" to
remove the threat of total destruc
tion by nuclear weapons. SDI,
presumably, is the instrument
which would make that dream
become reality. Regardless of one's
level of confidence in our ability to

VIEWPOINT

actually develop a workable space
based laser defense system, one
must admire the president's inten
tions. Suhre, however, departs
from this motive and offers three
reasons of his own in favor of SDI.
His arguments, however, are fun
damentally flawed in logic and
reasoning.
Suhre first agrees with what
many experts have offered as an ar
gument against SDI: it would be
impossible to deploy a system that
could shoot down 100 percent of in
coming missiles. In a full-scale So
viet first strike, U.S. society would
probably be destroyed, with or
without SDI. However, he gives us
a concept he calls "death potential"
— which essentially reduces nu
clear strategy to a numbers game
— and says that SDI should be used
to limit death potential after the
destruction of our society. Even if
our country were annihilated,
Suhre seems to say, the United
States should have SDI available to
save the rest of the species from
extinction in the nuclear winter that
would follow an all-out exchange.
The problems with this line of
reasoning are staggering in both
number and dimension. First of all,
Suhre's juggling of numbers to find

a balance between the effective
ness of SDI and the possibility of a
nuclear winter is useless because it
is based on pure speculation. The
fact is no one knows how many
warheads would have to be ex
ploded to bring on a nuclear winter.
Second, it is hard to believe that
the United States would be willing
to spend hundreds of billions of dol
lars to deploy a "defense" which
would in no way defend our society.
This is especially true in light of the
fact that SDI would do nothing to
guarantee protection from a nuclear
winter.
Finally, if we are to grant that the
United States would be destroyed
in a nuclear exchange, even if we
were to deploy SDI, why not limit
the possibility of a nuclear winter
simply by unilaterally disarming?
The end result would be the same;
in the event of a Soviet attack, the
United States would be
demolished, and we could guaran
tee that fewer warheads would be
exploded, thus saving mankind
from extinction and sparing us the
cost of development.
The most disturbing point in
Suhre's article is the unstated
theme of reliance on a technological
fix to alleviate the threat of global
destruction. Suhre does not ac
knowledge the fact that, in its
simplest form, SDI is just another
advancement in a seemingly end
less arms race. Contrary to what
Suhre argues, "Star Wars" will not
ensure against annihilation. With
the technology available to destroy
the planet by pressing a single but
ton, the only useful step against an
nihilation is total nuclear disarma
ment, demobilization of armed
forces and abandonment of force as
a means to resolve political prob
lems.
