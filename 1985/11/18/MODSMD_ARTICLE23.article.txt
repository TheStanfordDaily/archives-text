## Cardinal Comeback Gets Tripped Up 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
TEMPE, Ariz. — The Stanford
football team lost its seventh game
of the season here Saturday night,
but it won some respect in the
process.
In front of a national audience on
the Turner Broadcasting System
and a homecoming crowd of 64,003
in Sun Devil Stadium, the Cardinal
thoroughly outplayed powerful
Arizona State for the entire second
half. After spotting ASU a 21-0
lead, the Cardinal dug in and fought
its way back to within seven points
of the Rose Bowl contenders at the
five-minute mark.
The Sun Devils, backed by the
screams of their towel-waving,
horn-hatted fans, had to grind out
four first downs on their final drive
before they could breathe easily
again and head to the locker room
with a 21-14 win and an intact set of
bowl dreams.
Stanford Coach Jack Elway was
generally pleased with the play of
his team, which had gone into the
game as a 16-point underdog.
"I told them they should feel
about as good as they can in this sit
uation," he said. "I've got no com
plaint about this team's effort and
enthusiasm. They weren't in
timidated, and they came out and
played hard football."
Particularly fullback Brad
Muster. The big junior aggravated a
hip pointer early in the fourth quar
ter, but came back to make a num
ber of key plays in the Cardinal's
second touchdown drive. One of
those plays — a shovel pass that he
broke for 15 yards and a first down
— gave him 72 receptions on the
season, erasing Gene Washington's
17-year-old Stanford and Pac-10
record of 71.
"I think it's a great record, but I
don't know if I deserve the credit or
not," Muster said. "I think you can
question a lot of my receptions. I'm

a dump-off receiver, and Gene
Washington was catching his balls
20 yards downfield. This doesn't
take anything away from his
record."
Quarterback John Paye had an
other routinely amazing day, com
pleting 29 of his 41 passes for 211
yards, despite pressure from the

uncharacteristically blitz-happy
ASU defense. Paye threw out of
the shotgun formation for most of
the second half, mixing the short
dumps to Muster with sideline
throws to Jeff James (six catches)
and passes over the middle to tight
end Greg Baty (seven grabs).
The Stanford defense fell prey to

the same problem that has plagued
it all year — the big play. ASU
scored on plays covering 47 and. 58
yards in the first half and set up a
third touchdown with a 23-yard
pass on third and 19 from the Stan
ford 38. In the second half,
however, the Cardinal defense
settled down to hold the Sun Devils

to zero points and only 151 total
yards.
"We shut them out in the second
half, so we should have shut them
out in the first half," cornerback Toi
Cook said.
ASU scored first on a 47-yard
romp up the middle by tailback Mike
Crawford, who finished the day

with 139 yards rushing.
Stanford blew a big scoring op
portunity on its next possession
after Paul Svitenko recovered a
fumbled punt on the Sun Devil 30.
The Cardinal drive sputtered out at
the 16-yard line, and kicker David


David Kravetz/Daily
Stanford fullback Brad Muster, who caught 12 passes to set a new Pac-10 Greg Battle. Muster's 12 snags gave him 72 on the year, breaking former Card
single-season reception record, gets caught from behind by ASU linebacker inal Gene Washington's record of 71.
