# Women Top Arizona But Lose To UCLA
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
Just a week after being pum
meled on its home court by Stan
ford, the defending-champion
UCLA women's volleyball team
upset the No. 1 Cardinal Satur
day in the semi-finals of the
Wendy's Classic at Stockton.
The Cardinal came back yes
terday to take third place in the
tournament by defeating San
Jose State, 15-12, 15-9, 15-11.
The University of the Pacific,
the host team, captured the
tournament, defeating UCLA in
a close five-game final.
Friday night, Stanford swept
Arizona at Maples Pavilion — 15-
12, 15-6, 15-9 — to finish the

Pac-West season in first place at
7-1.
UCLA's 15-12, 12-15, 15-13,
15-12 victory Saturday ended a
seven-match Cardinal win
streak.
"It was a close match," Stan
ford Co-coach Don Shaw said.
"Each game was up for grabs."
The Bruins had failed to win a
game in their first two matches
with the Cardinal this season.
But Saturday they were deter
mined to put an end to their
frustration.
"They played as though they
had a lot more riding on the
match," Shaw said. "We didn't
play particularly well."
"With a loss they could have
dropped out of the top four (in the
rankings)," Shaw added. "They
were really fired up."
The Cardinal's victory yesterday
was its third of the season against
San Jose and upped its overall
record to 22-2.
"We played better," Shaw said.
"The motivation we had was that
the team was disappointed with the
loss to UCLA."
Though the loss to UCLA was
obviously disappointing, Shaw said
the results of the tournament were
not very consequential.
"We seem to always play this
way at the Wendy's Classic," he ex
plained. "We've never really played
that well there. A lot of people think
it's really significant, but it's just a
tournament."
Friday night's win over Arizona
was relatively easy after a close
first game.
Card notes
Though it was reported Friday
that the Arizona match was the last
home match of the season, the
Cardinal does have one more match
at Maples — tomorrow at 7:30
against California.
