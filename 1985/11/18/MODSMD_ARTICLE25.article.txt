# Paye goes for the shotgun
## Elway Adds Some New Wrinkles 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
TEMPE, Ariz. — It was the next-to-last game
of the season, but that didn't stop Stanford
Coach Jack Elway from experimenting with new
formations in Saturday's 21-14 loss to Arizona
State. And because he did, the outlook for next
week's Big Game with UC-Berkeley has grown
much, much brighter.
Instead of standing pat with the offensive
weapon that had worked so well against Oregon
State, the three-fullback offense, or power-I, El
way came to practice last week and installed a
new way of generating instant offense — the
shotgun.
And when the power-I went no where in the
first half, Elway pulled out his new weapon.
Before Elway unholstered the shotgun on the
last drive of the first half, Stanford had collected
102 total yards and no points. With the gun, the
Cardinal rolled up 165 yards and two touch
downs.
"(The power-I) didn't start well," Elway said.
"We didn't get anything going out of it. We

wanted to score on something, to break their
jaw. We used it (the shotgun) at the end of the
first half and after that, we knew we were going
to stay with it all second half.
"The shotgun gave (quarterback) John Paye
more visibility," he continued. "He was ex
tremely accurate and mobile, and the receivers
did a good job catching the football. It gave us
more time to do the things we wanted to do."

Other than a couple of miscues that resulted
when center Kurt Josephson couldn't hear
Paye's signals, the shotgun was extremely effec
tive. It gave Paye more time for downfield

reads, and it opened up the shovel pass for a
couple of big gainers.
Paye, the man in charge of pulling the trigger,
was happy with the new look. "I really like it,"he
said. "It's a good addition to our offense."
The gun isn't the only new weapon Cal will
have to worry about, either. The big, quick ASU
defense stuffed the power-I, but Elway won't
hesitate to bring it out again for the Bears. Stan
ford should be able to set up a running game
against Cal, and the power-I is the best way of
doing it.
A new defensive twist that might stay in the
game plan for next week is blitzing cornerback
Toi Cook on a fairly regular basis. It didn't work
very well against the Sun Devils, but again, Cal
ain't ASU.
"It was a wrinkle we put on defense," Cook
said. "We thought it would help out. But every
time we ran the blitz, they'd either run away
from me or run a trap."
And remember, the innovations haven't nec
essarily stopped. There's still a week of practice
left before the game, plenty of time for Elway to
think up more and better twists. Did someone
say single wing?
