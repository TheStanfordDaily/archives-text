# No. 3 Longhorns Lose Big 77-36
## Swimmers Off To a Fast Start And Texas Is the First To Fall 
### AMY FRANCETIC 
The season opener for the Stan
ford men's swim team was reminis
cent of the past and perhaps a
foretelling of the future.
The No. 1 ranked Cardinal easily
overpowered the No. 3 ranked
Texas Longhorns Friday at De-
Guerre Pool, winning its 36th con
secutive dual meet by a score of
77-36.
Stanford Coach Skip Kenney was
obviously very pleased with the
meet. "With all the new things
we've been doing, with the frosh
and new kinds of training, I didn't
know what to expect. But, things
turned out well. Our guys raced
hard, and I'm really proud of them,"
Kenney said.
Indeed, things turned out well for
Stanford. The Cardinal took first in
10 out of 13 events, including both

the 400 medley relay and the 400
freestyle relay.
The frosh made an outstanding
debut. "They swam well all the way
around. From distance to middle
distance to the sprinters," Kenney
said. Jeff Garr placed third in the 50
freestyle and Bob Gavin took two
seconds in the 1,000 and 500
freestyle. John Hodge and Rich Roll
also contributed significantly by
snatching up third places in the 200
freestyle and the 200 butterfly, re
spectively.
In addition, the winning 400
freestyle team was comprised of
freshmen.
Stanford's performance was even
more impressive considering the
team was without the services of
two of its top swimmers, Pablo
Morales and Jeff Kostoff.
"We got more honest swims out
of everyone because this time we
couldn't rely on Pablo and Jeff. The

energy put into the efforts was
tremendous," Kenney said en
thusiastically.
Morales and Kostoff were both
out of town competing in other
sports. Morales was with the water
polo team in Berkeley and Kostoff
was running with the cross country
team in Seattle.
But their absence didn't seem to
set the Cardinal back, as the team
kicked past the Longhorns with fine
performances from other key
swimmers.
Sophomore Matt Nance swam a
fantastic double, taking first in the
1,000 freestyle and the 200 indi
vidual medley. Teammate Gavin
finished a close second in the 1,000
freestyle. In the end, their times —
Nance swam a 9:17.53 and Gavin a
9:18.21 — placed them seventh and
eighth on Stanford's all-time Top 10

On his way to an easy but unofficial win, John Moffet thrashes toward the finish in the 200 meter
breast stroke at DeGuerre Pool Friday. Stanford beat Texas handily despite the absence of Pablo
Morales and Jeff Kostoff.
record for that event.
Junior Dave Louden also stole
two firsts from the Longhorns in
the 200 freestyle and the 500
freestyle. Senior Thor Johnson
clinched two more firsts in the one
and three-meter dives. Junior An
thony Moss, recovering from a bout
with the chicken pox and a broken
finger, still turned in a good enough
time (1:51.49) in the 200 butterfly
to take first.
Texas Coach Eddie Reese felt
that the Longhorns' performance
was disappointing. "They shouldn't
have let the weather get to them
(the Longhorn swimmers)," he
said. "It was no excuse." Used to
competing indoors, the Longhorns
felt the chill as the sun set on a
sunny but brisk 50 degree after
noon at DeGuerre.
Regardless, Reese said, "We
could have never beaten them
today. They were very, very good.
We just didn't measure up."

sophomore Matt Nance receives hearty congratulations from a camera-shy Cardinal swimmer.
Nance also won the 1,000 meter freestyle with a time of 9:17.53, just ahead of teammate Bob
Gavin's 9:18.21.
