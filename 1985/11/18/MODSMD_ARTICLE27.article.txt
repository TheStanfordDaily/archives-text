# Water Polo Wraps Up Pac-10 Title
## Dettamanti praises defense in 6-3 win over Cal 
### INGRID SEYER Staff writer 
The No. 1 ranked Stanford water polo team (21-4)
clinched the Pacific 10 Conference title and avenged an
earlier mid-season loss on Friday as it defeated No. 5
UC-Berkeley 6-3 at Cal.
With a 4-0 Pac-10 record prior to the match, the
Cardinal needed only one more conference victory to
capture the title. Friday, Stanford not only earned that
victory, but it avenged a 9-8 overtime loss to Cal that
took place in October in the Nor Cal Tournament.
"The team really wanted to win this match. We felt
we owed them one," water polo Coach Dante Det
tamanti said. "Basically, we were pretty excited and
psyched about the game, and we were able to channel
that drive into our performance."
Dettamanti said the Cardinal's basic game plan relies
on coming out strong at the start and forcing opponents
into a highly defensive game. In Friday's match, Stan
ford's game plan could not have been executed more
perfectly.

The Cardinal jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first
quarter, setting the scene for the remainder of the
match. Although the Bears were virtually in a "must
win" situation and had tapered earlier in the week for
the match, they did not come out strong at the start.
"Cal did not come out at all like we had expected
them to in the first quarter," Dettamanti said. "I think
they were quite nervous, causing them not only to be
be more cautious, but also causing them to use poor,
judgment and make a lot of errors."
After their scoreless first quarter, Cal started off the
second quarter with an early goal — only to be
answered with a quick Stanford goal that put the score
at 3-1.
The Bears were able to score two more times in the
second period, only to have the Cardinal retort each
time with a goal to maintain its two-goal advantage.
"The second quarter was really tough," Dettamanti
said. "We kept fighting it out, exchanging goals back
and forth, but we were still able to hold our lead."

In the second half, Stanford scored one goal in the
third quarter while Cal was shut out, making the final
6-3. Although the Cardinal had a very low-scoring
match, as Dettamanti said, "when your opponent
scores three goals, you really only have to score four.
We scored six."
According to Dettamanti, although there was no
single key to Stanford's victory, the Cardinal's strong
defense was certainly a prominent factor.
"We played absolutely fabulous defense," Det
tamanti said. "To hold Cal to three goals, with none in
the second half, is quite a feat. Todd Kemp played ex
cellent in the goal, committing virtually no mental er
rors whatsoever.
"I had predicted that the six-on-fives (man-up situa
tions) would decide the game, and that was at least
partially true. The key to our defense was our ability to
stop Cal from scoring on their six-on-fives."
Defense, however, was hardly the sole facet of the
Cardinal's play that was shining on Friday. Stanford's

offense was able to work together as a total team,
committing very few errors during the course of the
match.
"As usual, Cal keyed on (David) Imbernino, but
every player pulled his share of the load, and once
again we were able to prove that we are far from a
one-man team," Dettamanti said. "(Cal Coach) Pete
Cutino was quoted in The Daily Californian as saying
that we (Stanford) play the 'most together' of any team
around. In the Cal match, we really did play together;
we concentrated, communicated, executed and did all
the little things right."
Stanford will play its final match of the season Satur
day against Cal in the "Big Splash" at De Guerre Pool.
The following week, the Cardinal will travel to Long
Beach to compete in the NCAA Championships Nov.
30-31.
Although the Bears are now 0-5 in the Pac-10, even
if they lose Saturday's match to Stanford, they still
might have a chance of entering the NCAAs on the
basis of their 14-8 overall season record.

committing very few errors during the course of the
match.
"As usual, Cal keyed on (David) Imbernino, but
every player pulled his share of the load, and once
again we were able to prove that we are far from a
one-man team," Dettamanti said. "(Cal Coach) Pete
Cutino was quoted in The Daily Californian as saying
that we (Stanford) play the 'most together' of any team
around. In the Cal match, we really did play together;
we concentrated, communicated, executed and did all
the little things right."
Stanford will play its final match of the season Satur
day against Cal in the "Big Splash" at De Guerre Pool.
The following week, the Cardinal will travel to Long
Beach to compete in the NCAA Championships Nov.
30-31.
Although the Bears are now 0-5 in the Pac-10, even
if they lose Saturday's match to Stanford, they still
might have a chance of entering the NCAAs on the
basis of their 14-8 overall season record.
