The Stanford wrestling team
opened the 1985-86 season suc
cessfully at the Cal-Poly San Luis
Obispo Collegiate as four Cardi
nal wrestlers got into the finals.
The tournament was a non
scoring one, meaning that there
were no final places awarded to
the 10 teams that competed.
"The purpose of the tourna
ment was to identify areas where
we need work," wrestling Coach
Chris Horpel said. "I am very
pleased with the first-string
guys, for those who have been
competitive in the past really
shined in the tournament."
Leading the Cardinal squad
was senior Ail-American Jeff
Bradley. Bradley defeated Dondi
Teran of Cal-State Fullerton 6-1
to win the 134-pound division.
Bradley's last collegiate ap
pearance was March 16 at the

NCAA Championships, but the
long layoff had little effect on
Bradley, as Horpel said that this
was the best he had seen him
wrestle.
Senior Scott Wiggen decided
to move up to 150 pounds for the
tournament in orde* to meet
long-time foe Rich Berg of
Fresno State. The match never
materialized as Berg lost in the
semi-finals, while Wiggen went
on to capture the 150-pound
title.
In what has grown to be a per
sonal battle, Dave Lee (167
pounds) squared off against
Fresno State's Fred Little, who
knocked Lee out of the NCAA
Championships last year.
Little upped his record over
Lee with a 2-2 criteria decision.
In the overtime period Little
scored a two-point takedown,
which was worth more in the
criteria process than Lee's two
one-point scores.
