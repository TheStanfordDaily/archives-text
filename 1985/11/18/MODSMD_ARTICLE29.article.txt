# Card loses to Iowa 3-0
## Curtain Falls On Hockey '85 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
The Stanford field hockey sea
son is over. The No. 3 ranked
lowa Hawkeyes put an end to
the hockey program's best sea
son ever by defeating the Cardi
nal Saturday 3-0 in the first
round of the NCAA playoffs at
Evansville, 111.
The loss gave Stanford a final
record of 10-4-1. lowa upped its
record to 19-3-1 before losing
yesterday in a second-round
match against the No. 1 ranked
Northwestern Wildcats. Nor
thwestern's 3-2 triple overtime
win puts the team in the Final
Four, which takes place next
weekend in Norfolk, Va.
With the victory, the Hawk
eyes avenged their 2-1 loss at
the hands of the Cardinal last
year. It was that win and the
nine-game winning streak that
Stanford took into the match
Saturday which made the Cardi
nal confident that it could play at
the level of the highly ranked
Hawkeyes.
According to Cardinal Asst.
Coach Jen Bleakley, Stanford did
just that. "We were not over
whelmed today, the game was
not a mismatch," Bleakley said.
Statistically, though, this
game was not the pressure
cooker last year's was. lowa
took 26 shots to Stanford's

three. All of the Cardinal shots
were taken in the first half and
included a penalty stroke taken
by co-captain Karen Chamberlain
14:50 into the game.
All three of lowa's goals were
scored in the first half. The
Hawkeye combination of Mary
Koboldt and Marcia Pankratz ac
counted for the first two. Liz
Tchou tallied the second score
on one of the Hawkeyes' 10 cor
ners.
"lowa was the better team
today. They were very aggres
sive and put a lot of pressure on
us," Bleakley said.
Despite a tough ending to its
storybook season, the Cardinal
can look forward to a potentially
greater year next fall.
Stanford will lose six seniors,
including 1984 West Region
All-America Chamberlain and
Suzanne Doi, who led a defense
which allowed only 17 goals in a
15-game season. But each of the
returning nine underclassmen
saw consistent and substantial
playing time this year. Included
in these nine are freshmen
Karen Jones, the Northern
Pacific Conference's leading
goalie, and junior Maree Chung,
the squad's top scorer.
Replacing Chamberlain at the
helm of the offense will be junior
Andi Wolpert, also a West Re
gion All-America last year and
likely to receive that honor again
this year.
