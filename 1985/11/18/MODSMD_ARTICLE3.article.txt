The arraignment of four of nine
apartheid protesters arrested Oct.
11 for civil disobedience was
deferred on Friday to Nov. 26.
Graduate student Cam Baker,
seniors David Romo and Kaylen
Worth and sophomore Peter Heslin
are now scheduled to appear at the
Palo Alto Municipal Court on Nov.
26. Graduate student Eric Diesel,
senior Warren Habib, junior Sophia
Raday and freshman Robert Shaw,
also arrested Oct. 11, are sched

uled to be arraigned that day as
well.
Of the nine students, Baker,
Heslin, Romo and Worth said they
plan to enter pleas of not guilty.
The ninth demonstrator, senior
Robby Perkins, was arraigned
Tuesday and entered a plea of not
guilty to charges of trespassing, un
lawful assembly and refusal to dis
perse. Perkins was also initially
charged with resisting arrest, but
that charge has been dropped.
"It's an individual choice, but
most of the people I've talked to in
dicate that they are also planning to

plead not guilty," Heslin said yes
terday.
Baker and Romo were charged
with trespassing, unlawful assem
bly, remaining at the scene of a riot
and refusal to disperse from an un
lawful assembly. All charges are
misdemeanors punishable by six
months in jail or a $500 fine.
Heslin, Worth and Raday were
also charged with resisting arrest
because they allegedly went limp
and refused to cooperate with
police when arrested.
According to Raday, that charge
against her has been dropped.
Diesel, Habib and Shaw,

released immediately after being
arrested, were cited for trespass
ing, refusal to disperse and unlawful
assembly.
At least two of the six protesters
arrested Oct. 14 are expected to be
arraigned today. They are graduate
student John Kennedy and Statis
tics Prof. Charles Stein â€” the first
faculty member to be arrested in
apartheid protests here.
Kennedy and Stein, issued cita
tions and released immediately
after their arrests, were charged
with trespassing, unlawful assem
bly, refusal to disperse and remain
ing at the scene of a crime.
