# Men Run Into the NCAAs
## 
### BILL JACKSON Staff writer 
For the first time in countless seasons, the
Stanford men's cross country team has qualified
for the NCAA Championship meet.
In an unforeseen role reversal, the men placed
third in the NCAA District-8 meet in Seattle,
Wash., Saturday, while the defending champion
Stanford women placed sixth and failed to qualify
for the NCAAs.
Leading the way for the Cardinal and gather

ing top individual honors was standout junior
Marc Olesen, with a time of 29:51 over the 10
kilometer course. Olesen, also the individual
Pacific 10 Conference champion two weeks ago,
was followed by Jay Marden of UC-Berkeley at
29:58 and Andre Woods of Arizona at 29:59.
Behind Olesen and aiding in the Stanford
scoring were seniors Jeff Atkinson in 30:17 (12th
place overall) and Ryan Stoll in 30:31 (20th), the
outstanding freshman runner James Alborough in
30:36 (22nd) and Steve Schadler in 31:10 (40th).
Rounding out the top six finishers for the Card
inal was Jeff Kostoff in 63rd place with a time of
31:59.

Arizona led the way in team competition with
58 points. The Sun Devils were followed by
UCLA (75 points), Stanford (95), Oregon (97)
and UC-Irvine (126).
The Cardinal men will again test their strength
in their last meet of the season, the NCAA meet
in Milwaukee, Wise., November 25.
Despite the men's good fortune, the lady
Cardinal did not fare as well. The Stanford
women took sixth overall and consequently
missed qualifying for the nationals by four teams.
