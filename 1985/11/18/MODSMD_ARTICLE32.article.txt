Thatcher Faces Protestant Fury
LONDON — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher explains her gov
ernment's historic pact on Northern Ireland today in Parliament,
where furious Protestant lawmakers from the violence-torn province
have threatened to resign in opposition.
The historic agreement giving the Irish Republic a say in the af
fairs of the British-ruled province was signed Friday by Thatcher and
the Irish prime minister, Garret FitzGerald.
One of the 15 Protestant legislators from Northern Ireland, the
Rev. Lan Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party,
denounced the British prime minister from his Belfast pulpit last
night.
"I can only liken Mrs. Thatcher to Jezebel, who sought to destroy
Israel in a day of grave national crisis," said Paisley, referring to the
wicked wife of King Ahab, whose deeds are chronicled in the Old
Testament.
But the fiery Paisley said Northern Ireland's Protestants would
not riot and fight the army or police. "We are going to do this the con
stitutional way," he told his congregation.
Thatcher and FitzGerald are seeking to bring peace to the
Protestant-dominated north of Ireland, where overwhelmingly
Roman Catholic IRA guerrillas fight British rule.
Highjackers To Go on Trial
GENOA, Italy — The four men charged with highjacking the Ital
ian luxury liner Achille Lauro and a man accused of being their ac
complice go on trial today for illegal possession of arms and ex
plosives.
A second trial for kidnapping and murder is expected later but no
date has been set. Leon Klinghoffer, 69, a wheelchair-bound pas
senger from New York City, was killed and his body tossed over
board during the October highjacking.
Separating charges is a relatively common practice in Italy in com
plicated cases involving terrorist-related crimes. Judicial sources say
the reason for the immediate trial is to give prosecutors time to in
vestigate the more serious charges. The four men claimed to be
motivated by the Palestinian cause.
The first trial will involve the four men from the Achille Lauro and
a Syrian arrested in this northern port city with what police said were
false passports before the Achille Lauro departed Oct. 3 on its
Mediterranean cruise.
The five are charged with illegally bringing to Italy four Soviet
made automatic rifles, eight hand grenades and nine detonators, and
with illegal possession of the weapons. Conviction can bring three to
12 years imprisonment and a fine.
Colombia To Continue Search
ARMERO, Colombia — The government reversed its decision to
halt the search for survivors in this Andean village covered by a river
of volcanic mud and said yesterday it will continue rescue operations.
Just hours earlier, Health Minister Rafael Zubiria told reporters
the government had called an end to the emergency operation. "The
last three survivors were rescued this morning in Armero, and I
believe they later died. There is now no one left to rescue," he said.
But after the Caracol radio network reported that as many as
2,500 people were still trapped in the area, Victor Ricardo, a top aide
to President Belisario Betancur, said the search effort would con
tinue. He made the statement in a Caracol interview.
U.S. officials on the scene had agreed with the earlier government
report that all trapped survivors had been rescued. The officials,
who toured the area yesterday, said stranded residents had been air
lifted to relief centers and the injured were being treated.
More than 21,000 people perished in the avalanche of mud that
swept over Armero following the eruption of the Nevado del Ruiz
volcano Wednesday night.
Sharon Sees Unified Coalition
LOS ANGELES — Israel's government remains unified, Cabinet
member Ariel Sharon said yesterday, days after his bitter criticism of
Prime Minister Shimon Peres threatened to tear apart the country's
ruling coalition.
"I believe the conflict in the Israeli government is over and we can
work together until the next elections in 1988. We can now concen
trate on economic and anti-terrorist problems," Sharon, Israel's min
ister of industry and trade and leading member of the conservative
Likud bloc, told a news conference at the Century Plaza Hotel.
"I believe that the relations in the government have improved. I
believe we'll be able to work together in the government with closer
and better understanding," said the 57-year-old soldier-politician.
Sharon, in town to appear as speaker at a Los Angeles Israel Bond
Organization dinner last night, refused to say anything critical of
Peres or the prime minister's threat to fire him should he criticize
the national unity government again.
U.S. Companies Press Botha
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — A group representing 186
U.S. companies doing business in South Africa has called on Presi
dent P.W. Botha to compromise to end final-exam boycotts by black
and mixed-race students, news reports said yesterday.
In other developments, police reported four more riot deaths over
the weekend, and a newspaper said Nobel Peace Prize-winner Bis
hop Desmond Tutu was a candidate to replace the head of the
Anglican Church in southern Africa. U.S. companies that endorse
the Sullivan Principles code of conduct in South Africa sent a
message to Botha Friday urging conciliatory gestures on the school
dispute, the reports said.
Final exams that determine promotion and graduation have begun
in both black and mixed-race schools, but thousands of students are
boycotting the tests to press demands that include the withdrawal of
troops from riot-torn black townships.
Rajneesh Criticizes the U.S.
NEW DELHI, India — Guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, whose
prosecution on U.S. immigration fraud charges was described by a
disciple as "divine play." denounced the United States yesterday,
complained of bad treatment there and said he was "finished with the
whole world."
The 53-year-old guru, in his first news conference since he was
arrested Oct. 28 in North Carolina in an immigration scandal, said the
world must "put the monster America in its place."
He said that during his 12 days in jail, he was tortured and "treated
as a very dangerous criminal." He said that though he pleaded guilty,
he was not.

who toured the area yesterday, said stranded residents had been air
lifted to relief centers and the injured were being treated.
More than 21,000 people perished in the avalanche of mud that
swept over Armero following the eruption of the Nevado del Ruiz
volcano Wednesday night.
Sharon Sees Unified Coalition
LOS ANGELES — Israel's government remains unified, Cabinet
member Ariel Sharon said yesterday, days after his bitter criticism of
Prime Minister Shimon Peres threatened to tear apart the country's
ruling coalition.
"I believe the conflict in the Israeli government is over and we can
work together until the next elections in 1988. We can now concen
trate on economic and anti-terrorist problems," Sharon, Israel's min
ister of industry and trade and leading member of the conservative
Likud bloc, told a news conference at the Century Plaza Hotel.
"I believe that the relations in the government have improved. I
believe we'll be able to work together in the government with closer
and better understanding," said the 57-year-old soldier-politician.
Sharon, in town to appear as speaker at a Los Angeles Israel Bond
Organization dinner last night, refused to say anything critical of
Peres or the prime minister's threat to fire him should he criticize
the national unity government again.
U.S. Companies Press Botha
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — A group representing 186
U.S. companies doing business in South Africa has called on Presi
dent P.W. Botha to compromise to end final-exam boycotts by black
and mixed-race students, news reports said yesterday.
In other developments, police reported four more riot deaths over
the weekend, and a newspaper said Nobel Peace Prize-winner Bis
hop Desmond Tutu was a candidate to replace the head of the
Anglican Church in southern Africa. U.S. companies that endorse
the Sullivan Principles code of conduct in South Africa sent a
message to Botha Friday urging conciliatory gestures on the school
dispute, the reports said.
Final exams that determine promotion and graduation have begun
in both black and mixed-race schools, but thousands of students are
boycotting the tests to press demands that include the withdrawal of
troops from riot-torn black townships.
Rajneesh Criticizes the U.S.
NEW DELHI, India — Guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, whose
prosecution on U.S. immigration fraud charges was described by a
disciple as "divine play." denounced the United States yesterday,
complained of bad treatment there and said he was "finished with the
whole world."
The 53-year-old guru, in his first news conference since he was
arrested Oct. 28 in North Carolina in an immigration scandal, said the
world must "put the monster America in its place."
He said that during his 12 days in jail, he was tortured and "treated
as a very dangerous criminal." He said that though he pleaded guilty,
he was not.
Thatcher Faces Protestant Fury
LONDON — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher explains her gov
ernment's historic pact on Northern Ireland today in Parliament,
where furious Protestant lawmakers from the violence-torn province
have threatened to resign in opposition.
The historic agreement giving the Irish Republic a say in the af
fairs of the British-ruled province was signed Friday by Thatcher and
the Irish prime minister, Garret FitzGerald.
One of the 15 Protestant legislators from Northern Ireland, the
Rev. Lan Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party,
denounced the British prime minister from his Belfast pulpit last
night.
"I can only liken Mrs. Thatcher to Jezebel, who sought to destroy
Israel in a day of grave national crisis," said Paisley, referring to the
wicked wife of King Ahab, whose deeds are chronicled in the Old
Testament.
But the fiery Paisley said Northern Ireland's Protestants would
not riot and fight the army or police. "We are going to do this the con
stitutional way," he told his congregation.
Thatcher and FitzGerald are seeking to bring peace to the
Protestant-dominated north of Ireland, where overwhelmingly
Roman Catholic IRA guerrillas fight British rule.
Highjackers To Go on Trial
GENOA, Italy — The four men charged with highjacking the Ital
ian luxury liner Achille Lauro and a man accused of being their ac
complice go on trial today for illegal possession of arms and ex
plosives.
A second trial for kidnapping and murder is expected later but no
date has been set. Leon Klinghoffer, 69, a wheelchair-bound pas
senger from New York City, was killed and his body tossed over
board during the October highjacking.
Separating charges is a relatively common practice in Italy in com
plicated cases involving terrorist-related crimes. Judicial sources say
the reason for the immediate trial is to give prosecutors time to in
vestigate the more serious charges. The four men claimed to be
motivated by the Palestinian cause.
The first trial will involve the four men from the Achille Lauro and
a Syrian arrested in this northern port city with what police said were
false passports before the Achille Lauro departed Oct. 3 on its
Mediterranean cruise.
The five are charged with illegally bringing to Italy four Soviet
made automatic rifles, eight hand grenades and nine detonators, and
with illegal possession of the weapons. Conviction can bring three to
12 years imprisonment and a fine.
Colombia To Continue Search
ARMERO, Colombia — The government reversed its decision to
halt the search for survivors in this Andean village covered by a river
of volcanic mud and said yesterday it will continue rescue operations.
Just hours earlier, Health Minister Rafael Zubiria told reporters
the government had called an end to the emergency operation. "The
last three survivors were rescued this morning in Armero, and I
believe they later died. There is now no one left to rescue," he said.
But after the Caracol radio network reported that as many as
2,500 people were still trapped in the area, Victor Ricardo, a top aide
to President Belisario Betancur, said the search effort would con
tinue. He made the statement in a Caracol interview.
U.S. officials on the scene had agreed with the earlier government
report that all trapped survivors had been rescued. The officials,
who toured the area yesterday, said stranded residents had been air
