# Soviets jump on U.S. arms dispute
## Weinberger Letter Shows U.S. Arms Split 
### 
GENEVA — President Reagan's inner-circle
arms control dispute exploded in public yester
day, perhaps damaging the united front Reagan
hoped to take with him when he sits across the
table from Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
The episode began on the eve of Reagan's trip
to Geneva when a letter from Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger was leaked before Reagan
could read it. Reagan's spokesman said he
thought Weinberger, or one of his aides, did the
leaking.
Weinberger said Reagan, in Geneva, should
not agree to an extension of compliance with the
SALT II Treaty; should not agree to an interpre
tation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that in
hibits "Star Wars" testing; and should not sign a
joint communique on arms goals with Gorba
chev.
The leak came as Administration moderates
seemed to be gaining the upper hand on arms
control. The letter amounted to a high-risk ap
peal from a key cabinet officer for Reagan to
reverse decisions already made.
Administration officials said the letter and the
leak would not be damaging to the summit,
however, and spokesman Larry Speakes said:
"I'd be willing to put five bucks right here that

General Secretary Gorbachev will not say a
word about the Weinberger letter."
Whether he does or doesn't, the evidence of
an American split on arms control policy could
hamper Reagan in talks with Gorbachev. While
the Administration had sought to cover up its dif
ferences, the Weinberger letter again spotlights
Reagan's difficulties in achieving unity among his
own aides.
Weinberger, an opponent of the kind of arms
control strategy that some others in the Admin
istration favor, was pushed off the official summit
delegation, and some observers believe there
may have been an element of retaliation in the
motive of whoever leaked the letter.
The letter and the leak clearly were an effort
to block the kind of compromise that some other
advisers hoped would take shape here.
Georgy Arbatov, a chief Kremlin adviser on
American affairs, said of the Weinberger letter,
"If it is true what he is saying, it is a direct at
tempt to torpedo the arms control process."
At a press conference yesterday, Arbatov said
the letter confirms Soviet suspicions that the Ad
ministration is "trying to disrupt the whole
structure" of arms control.
Robert McFarlane, the president's national se

curity adviser, said yesterday that the leak of the
letter shouldn't be damaging, but said it will be
investigated to see how it occurred. But he also
said that Weinberger was only carrying out the
president's orders in drafting the letter.
He said Reagan asked in June for a report on
Soviet violations of existing arms control agree
ments. "The president expects members of his
cabinet to report on the threat and how it is
evolving over time . . . that is what the secre
tary has done with the report."
The president, walking from the 18th-century
Maison de Saussure where he is staying for a
meeting with top advisers, was asked if he
thought someone was trying to sabotage the
summit by leaking the letter.
"No," the president replied firmly. As to
whether he would fire Weinberger, Reagan said,
"You want a two-word answer or one?" When a
reporter said, "Two," the president replied,
"Hell, no."
Meanwhile, a survey showed that America's
European allies hold no exaggerated illusions,
but hope this week's summit leads to a better
basis of confidence when arms negotiators
return to work in the months ahead.
