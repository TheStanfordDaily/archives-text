### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Terry
Waite, the archbishop of Canter
bury's envoy seeking to free Amer
ican hostages in Lebanon, said yes
terday that he met their captors at a
secret meeting in Beirut and that
"positive steps have been taken."
Before flying to London and
Washington, he stressed at a news
conference that the situation
"remains very difficult and very
dangerous."
Waite left Beirut to brief Arch
bishop Robert Runcie of Canter
bury, primate of the Anglican Com
munion, on the results of his mis
sion and to consult senior U.S. offi
cials on his contacts.

Waite's meeting was seen as the
first real breakthrough in the long
running hostage drama. It is
believed to be the first contact be
tween a Western intermediary and
the kidnappers, thought to belong
to the Shiite Moslem extremist or
ganization Islamic Jihad, or Islamic
Holy War.
Four of the six Americans mis
sing in Beirut appealed to the arch
bishop by letter nine days ago to
help negotiate their release.
Waite said he was satisfied that
the four who wrote to Runcie are
alive and well, but when asked if he
had seen any of them, he said, "No
Cnmmpnf "

Waite, 46, told reporters his mis
sion "is not over" and said he ex
pects to return to Beirut to pursue
his one-man journey of mercy to
free the captives.
"During the past days I have had
lengthy contacts. There is ab
solutely no doubt at all that I have
got through to the right people and
that a measure of trust has been es
tablished. "
The hostages' message to the
archbishop was one of 12 letters
from the four captive Americans
that an unidentified man delivered
to the Beirut bureau of The Associ
ated Press.

The letters were signed by
hostages Terry Anderson, 38, AP's
chief Middle East correspondent;
the Rev. Lawrence Jenco, 50, a
Roman Catholic relief official; David
Jacobsen, 54, director of the Amer
ican University Hospital in Beirut;
and Thomas Sutherland, 53,
Scottish-born dean of agriculture at
the university.
The four wrote that they had
been told by their captors, identi
fied as members of Islamic Jihad,
that a fifth hostage, U.S. diplomat
William Buckley, 57, is dead.
They made no mention of Peter
Kilburn, 60, a university librarian
missing since Dec. 3, 1984.
