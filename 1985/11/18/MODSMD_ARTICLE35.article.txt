Public Wants Accord
NEW YORK — Nearly 75 percent of those
surveyed in a Time magazine poll said they
would be willing to see the United States trade
away "Star Wars" for cuts in Soviet military
power.
The survey of 1,020 registered voters was
taken by Yankelovich, Skelly & White a week
in advance of the Geneva summit, which
begins tomorrow.
Almost three out of four people surveyed
said they would be willing to have President
Reagan's proposed strategic defense system,
known as "Star Wars," dropped in return for
cuts in Soviet military power, Time reported
yesterday.
Eighty-six percent of those surveyed con
sidered a mutual reduction in arms a "very im
portant" summit goal, but only 31 percent
thought it likely to be realized.
While 82 percent of the respondents said the
U.S.-Soviet summit — the first in six years —
was a good idea, only 7 percent expected sig
nificant progress, and 16 percent expected no
progress.
Fifty-three percent described Reagan as
more knowledgeable about world affairs that
his Soviet counterpart, Mikhail Gorbachev.
Twenty percent viewed Gorbachev as more
knowlegeable, and Time did not give the

opinion of the other 27 percent.
The poll's potential sampling error is plus or
minus 3 percent.
Aid Proposal Drafted
NEW YORK — The Reagan Administration
may ask Congress to exempt state and local
governments from many of the laws and rules
that are a condition of getting federal funds, ac
cording to a published report.
The Administration has drafted a bill that
asks Congress to approve a procedure in
which the Ofice of Management and Budget
would recommend which of 68 federal statutes
or administrative requirements could be
eliminated, The New York Times reported in
today's editions.
The proposal, which is not finalized, would
represent a significant change in federal policy
and is part of the Administration's longstanding
effort to reduce what it says is interference in
local government decisions.
Under the draft of the proposal to be called
the Crosscutting Requirements Restraint Act,
Administration officials argue it is wrong to
impose a myriad of requirements on govern
ments or nonprofit groups simply because they
receive federal money, no matter how little or
for what purpose, The Times said.

Kate To Hit Florida
CORAL GABLES, Fla. — Hurricane Kate,
with gusts of almost 110 mph, continued its
westward drift yesterday, and hurricane warn
ings were issued for the southeast Bahamas
and the north coast of the Dominican Republic.
The storm also threatened to become the
first November hurricane to make U.S. landfall
in half a century.
"It looks as though it will pass right over the
Turks and then pass through the southeast
Bahamas," National Hurricane Center
forecaster Bob Case said last night. "Right
now, it looks as though it will have to be con
sidered here (in south Florida) in 72 hours.
"A lot can happen in that time, but it looks as
though we are going to be in trouble," he said.
Kate lashed the Turks and Caicos in the
southeast Bahamas with winds measuring 40-
50 mph, Case said.
A hurricane watch was in effct for central
Bahamas and the north coast of Haiti, the hur
ricane center here said.
At 8 p.m. EST, the 11th named storm of the
1985 Atlantic hurricane season was centered
at latitude 21.4 north and longitude 70.0 west,
or about 75 miles east of Grand Turk island, or
about 700 miles east-southeast of Miami.
