FULLERTON — Lon Nol, the U.S.-backed
general who overthrew Prince Norodom
Sihanouk in Cambodia in 1970 and was ousted
five years later by the communist Khmer
Rouge, died in exile yesterday. He was 72.
Lon, who lived in the United States since he
was ousted, died at 10 a.m. at St. Jude's Hosp
tial, where he had been admitted yesterday
morning, said nursing supervisor Mary Foley.
She said she did not know the cause of death.
Lon fled to Hawaii when his regime was
toppled in 1975 and lived there until 1979.
Since then, he, his wife and nine children had
lived in Orange County.
In a 1979 interview, Lon said he hoped the
international community would help restore his
country after the destruction wrought by the
Khmer Rouge under leader Pol Pot. The
regime, portrayed in the Academy Award
winning 1984 movie "The Killing Fields,"
destroyed much of Cambodia's population
through forced labor in work camps.

State Department press duty officer Bruce
Ammerman had no comment about Lon's
death.

SAN JOSE — San Jose Democratic Rep.
Norman Mineta complained this weekend that
the government is "steaming around in circles"
in attempts to clean up ground water pollution
in Silicon Valley.
He told a subcommittee of the House Com
mittee on Public Works and Transportation
Saturday, "Efforts to solve this problem are in
disarray. We are literally losing ground to the
problem rather than closing in on a solution."
Mineta was addressing the problems arising
form many sites in Santa Clara County with
toxic contamination of underground water
supplies. Most are believed caused by leaking
solvent tanks at high-tech plants.
Nearly a score of the sites have been placed
on the Superfund cleanup list, and Mineta

raked the Environmental Protection Agency
for coping with them one at a time, instead of
together as one problem.
Said Mineta, "This valley is supposed to be
the model for the economic future of the na
tion, and yet we have more Superfund sites
than any other county in the nation."
Whale Washes up
SAN FRANCISCO — The 1,000-pound
carcass of a dead whale washed up on China
Beach south of the Golden Gate early yester
day, the Marine Mammal Center reported.
Center spokeswoman Mary Jane Schramm
said the 13-foot-long creature was tentatively
identified as a mature female beaked whale,
which looks something like a huge dolphin.
The whale was found at dawn on the beach,
outside the Golden Gate about a mile south of
the bridge on the city's ocean frbnt. Schramm
said the cetacean would be dissected for
study.
