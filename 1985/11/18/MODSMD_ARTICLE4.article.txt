# Soviet Says SDI Key to Negotiations
## 
### ERIC HEALY Staff writer 
The success of arms control negotiations be
tween the United States and the Soviet Union
will be contingent upon President Reagan's Stra
tegic Defense Initiative, because, militarily, the
two countries are "pretty much even except for
SDI," according to Andrei Melville, head of sec
tion at the Soviet Union's Institute of the U.S.A.
and Canada.
Melville spoke Friday on U.S.-Soviet rela
tions and the problem of security in the contem
porary world. Approximately 40 attended the

Bechtel International Center event.
Melville attributed the current lack of deep
Soviet-American ties to the irreconcilability of
political philosophies and military cycles. Each
nation acts with respect to its own "type of his
tory and national psychology," Melville said.
Melville stressed that the relations must be
approached using "not only a psychological anal
ysis, but also a cross-cultural analysis."
The most important psychological problems,
according to Melville, concern nuclear weapons
and the introduction of nuclear issues.
"We must introduce new ways of thinking. We
tend to think in old patterns, and we try to avoid
the new reality of the nuclear revolution," Mel

ville said.
The advent of nuclear weapons "changed all
the conditions of our survival. . . . War used to
be a continuation of politics by other means.
Now war will be the end of politics," Melville
said. "It will be omnicide. That's not war. It can't
be limited.
"I doubt the very notion of balance of power
has any meaning today," Melville said. "In the
age of overkill, neither side can attain the stage
of superiority."
With respect to the future of Soviet-U.S. rela
tions, Melville said "the two systems have differ
ent visions of the future. Is this the prescription
for disaster? I don't think so."
