# Survey Ranks Stanford First Nationwide
## 
### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
For the second consecutive time,
the nation's college presidents
ranked Stanford as the top under
graduate college in the United
States, a few points ahead of Har
vard, Yale and Princeton, according
to a survey conducted by U.S.
News & World Report.
Stanford was also ranked No. 1 in
1983 when the magazine first con
ducted the survey.
College presidents were given a
list of colleges and universities
similar to their own in academic of
ferings and size and asked to
choose the five top institutions, ac
cording to a report in yesterday's
San Jose Mercury News.
Of the 788 college presidents
who responded to the survey this
year, 40.2 percent picked Stanford,
38.4 percent chose Harvard and
Yale and 36.6 percent named
Princeton.
University officials greeted the
results with a mixture of apprecia
tion and skepticism.
"It's nice to be called No. 1," said
Bob Beyers, director of University
New Service, who said the results
displayed increasing awareness of
Stanford's strengths in undergradu
ate education.
"The question is, "What are the top
five?' " Beyers said, emphasizing
that the survey did not ask college
presidents to rank the schools.
"Stanford was just mentioned more
often."
"I don't know what (the survey)
means," said Jean Fetter, dean of
Undergraduate Admissions. "The
bottom line is that we're among
very distinguished company."
The results are "no cause for
complacency," Beyers said, ex
plaining that such rankings are not
absolute. "Stanford is still behind
Harvard in the more direct compar
ison of admission."
Of those students admitted to
both universities, more choose to
enroll at Harvard than at Stanford,
according to Fetter.
The results of the survey of col
lege presidents are consistent with
the results of surveys done of stu
dents, Fetter said. All applicants to
Stanford are asked the names of
other colleges to which they are ap
plying, and Harvard, Yale and
Princeton are continually at the top
of the list.
"The presidents and the students
seem to hold the same opinion,"
Fetter said.
The results of this year's U.S.
News & World Report survey and
the 1983 survey are very similar. In
the previous survey, Stanford was
ranked first, followed by Harvard,
Yale, Princeton, UC-Berkeley and

the University of Chicago. All are
again in the top 10.
Other schools in the top 10 this
year include Duke, Brown,
Dartmouth and the University of
North Carolina.
Beyers discounted the survey's
importance. "It's nice to be first,
but I don't see it to be as significant
as the studies done periodically by
hundreds of faculty in their fields to
evaluate graduate education."
Judging a university's quality is
very difficult unless one is well
informed about its curriculum, re
sources and faculty, Beyers said.
The professors are better-equipped
than college presidents to give a
balanced assessment, particularly
since professors are judging only
the graduate departments within
their fields rather than the entire
university, he said.
"At a graduate level where re
search and work are being
evaluated, rankings become signifi
cant," Beyers said.
Stanford has risen steadily in
such evaluations, according to
Beyers. In the 19505, Stanford was
ranked 13th overall and in the
1960s became firmly entrenched in
the top 10, Beyers said.
The most recent graduate school
survey, done in 1982, showed the
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy to be the clear winner with all
but one of its evaluated depart
ments in the top 10, according to
Beyers.
Four Stanford departments, in
cluding psychology and computer
science, were ranked No. 1, and
the University was ranked second
overall, Beyers said.
According to the Mercury News,
the U.S. News & World Report
survey, scheduled to be published
in this week's issue, ranks 192
major universities. Williams College
in Massachusetts was rated first
among small liberal arts schools,
followed by Swarthmore in Penn
sylvania, Amherst in Massachu
setts, Carleton in Minnesota,
Haverford in Pennsylvania, Oberlin
in Ohio, Wellesley in Massachu
setts, Grinnell in lowa and Bowdoin
in Maine.
Stanford's top ranking in the
1983 survey raised the ire of two
Harvard students, who wrote: "If
college presidents believe Har
vard's not up there, what else don't
they believe? Is not Pope John Paul
II one of the five leading Catholics?
Is not the Pacific Ocean one of the
five largest bodies of water on the
West Coast? Is not the moon one of
the five largest celestial bodies or
biting our planet? We think so."
The column, by Paul Choi and
Clark Freshman, ran in the Harvard
Crimson and was reprinted in The
Daily.
