Several University of California regents have
assailed a plan announced on Wednesday by Cali
fornia State University to begin offering doctoral
degrees, calling it an attempt to usurp the role of
UC in meeting the higher education needs of Cal
ifornia.

UC President David Gardner, speaking at a
regents meeting at UCLA on Thursday, called
the Cal State plan "a radical departure from [the
state university's] . . . assigned role" under the
California Master Plan for Higher Education, re
ported the Los Angeles Times.
The California Master Plan, adopted in 1960,
calls for the nine-campus UC system to offer
graduate and professional degrees and to serve
as the center for the state's major scientific and
scholarly research. The 19-campus Cal 'State
system, according to the plan, is to devote its re
sources almost solely to undergraduate educa
tion.
The plan was adopted to curtail competition
and overlap between the state's colleges and uni
versities.
UC Regent Edward Carter, one of the earliest
supporters of the plan, said at Thursday's

meeting that he "could not agree more" that the
legislature should block Cal State's move to
begin offering doctoral degrees.
"Nothing could be more damaging" to Califor

nia's system of higher education, Carter said. "It
would create competition for research (dollars).
The state simply cannot afford it."
Cal State Chancellor W. Anne Reynolds said
Wednesday in announcing the Cal State plan that,
with the shortage of teachers and engineers, the
"demand is clearly there" for Cal State to begin
offering doctoral degrees in at least some sub
jects.
Gardner, however, countered that added doc
toral programs would tend to produce scholars
aloof from the practical roles of teaching and en
gineering.
"Should further study suggest there is on un
met need for doctoral degrees, the university is
prepared to address that need," Gardner said.
Also on Wednesday, Cal State announced
tougher admissions standards which, for appli
cants, would necessitate taking a full college
preparatory program in high school, similar to
the program required of UC applicants.
Under the master plan, students who are in
the top 12 percent of their graduating class are
admissible to UC, while students in the top third
are admissible to Cal State.
Some UC regents contend that the new ad
missions standards, in conjunction with the plan
to offer doctoral degrees, constitute an effort by
Cal State to encroach upon UC's role in meeting
the higher education needs of California.
Carter said he had "no doubt" the two actions
were related.
