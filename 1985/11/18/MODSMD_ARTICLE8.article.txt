# Judge Scientific Research Merits Rather Than Politics, Prof. Says
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
Basic research should be judged
on its scientific merits and not ac
cording to political considerations
or the end product of the research,
the director of the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory
(SSRL) said here Friday.
Prof. Arthur Bienenstock dis
cussed conflicting values in re
search in the fourth of a five-part
series, "Social Responsibilities of a
Modern University," held at
Memorial Church.
The unrivaled capabilities of
SSRL and the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) often
place the University in a difficult sit
uation, Bienenstock said.
In 1982, a consortium of outside
academics and private institutions
proposed constructing a new beam
line at SSRL, Bienenstock said.

Members of government laborato
ries specializing in weapons re
search were included in the consor
tium.
Although much of the funding
was to be provided by the Office of
Military Applications of the U.S.
Department of Energy, the pro
posal outlined "a broad range of
basic research" in addition to that
clearly related to weapons re
search, he said.
"It was quite clearly a proposal
for basic research, but basic re
search where you could see both
the non-military and the military ap
plications of (the) very same re
search," he said.
Bienenstock said this raised a
key question — whether research
linked to the development of nu
clear weapons is immoral.
Despite dissension among faculty
members and SLAC employees,
the proposal was approved by a
review panel of scientists. The

decision was in keeping with the
University policy of judging basic
research "on its own merits" and
understanding the distinction be
tween basic and applied research,
Bienenstock said.
Motivating the approval of the
decision was a basic belief that one
should "never attempt to limit
(efforts) to understand nature be
cause you don't like the end prod
ucts of the research," he said.
"I know that guiding me along my
entire scientific career was a sort of
statement of faith," he said. "It is
that the attempt to understand the
world and understand nature is in
trinsically good."
The creation of organizations
such as SSRL necessitates balanc
ing moral concerns with the tre
mendous opportunities for re
search, an attitude not always dupl
icated at government-run entities
such as the Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico, he said.
