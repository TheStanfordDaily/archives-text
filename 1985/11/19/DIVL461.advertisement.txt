Teamwork -5"-A !7 —j?
CAMPUS INTERVIEWS-NOVEMBER 26,1985
RCA/Sharp Microelectronics, a new joint venture of two world leaders in high technology, will give a
new and exciting meaning to the desired objective of teamwork.
Created to design and manufacture state-of-the-art memories, microprocessors and other IC products,
RCA/Sharp Microelectronics pools resources from east and west to pioneer breakthrough advance
ments in CMOS fab and VLSI design and development.
If you are graduating with a degree in:
• Chemistry • Material Science • Physics • Computer Science • Electrical Engineering
we offer the following areas of responsibility:
Design Engineers
Responsible for the design nf advanced CMOS VLSI integrated circuits for both digital and signal
processing application ; Woject areas include memories, microprocessors and signal processing
(analog and pr>. : jets. BS/MS/PhD in CS or EE required.
Proc^at Engineers
You will have responsibility for a specific product line of memory, telecom, microprocessor devices.
You will maintain and enhance yields to ascertain product meets application specification. Exposure to
all facets of semiconductor manufacturing, from design through wafer processing, and final test.
BS/MS/PhD in Physics or EE required.
Process Engineers
Responsible for converting silicon slices to functional semiconductors Process Engineers are key to
the implementation of process changes and the sustaining/developing of an automated wafer manu
facturing environment. Opportunities exist in the photolithography, diffusion, yield improvement, wet
chemistry, metal/chemical vapor deposition or ion implantation. BS/MS/PhD in Chemistry, Material
Science. Physics or EE required
RCA/Sharp Microelectronics is located along the Columbia River in Camas, Washington, minutes away
from Portland, offering the unique lifestyle of the Pacific Northwest
If you are unable to meet with us, please send your resume to: College Relations Manager, RCA/Sharp
Microelectronics, Dept. COL-85, PO Box 1044, Camas, WA 98607.
