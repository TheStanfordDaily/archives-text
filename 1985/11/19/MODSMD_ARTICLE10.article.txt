# Students Win Boothe Prize
## 
### KELLY SUND Staff writer 
The University last night awarded
Boothe prizes for freshman excellence in
writing to Kelli Bullard and Marguerite
Bui. Seven finalists were also recognized.
Bullard received the award for the es
say, 'Madame Bovary and the Emotional
Marketplace," which she wrote last spring
in the Conflict and Change track of West
ern Culture. Bullard, who plans to major
in Human Biology, said she did not know
her essay had been submitted and was
surprised and happy to win.
Bui's winning essay, "Chinese Eco
nomic Reforms: A Touch of Capitalism in
Communist China," was a research paper
written for a freshman English class called
The Individual Across Culture. Bui said
the paper inspired her to major in East
Asian studies, in addition to economics.
A panel of four judges selected the win
ning papers from essays submitted by
freshman English and Western Culture
teachers. One winner and one finalist
were picked from the English research
papers, and one winner and six finalists
were chosen from the Western Culture
essays. All finalists and winners received
copies of "The Riverside Shakespeare"
anthology, and the two winners also
received $250 each.

The seven finalists were Jeff Colen,
from freshman English; Richard Gompell,
from the Great Works Western Culture
track; Meryl Shapiro, from the Literature
and the Arts track; Cathy Gallagher, from
the Humanities track; Dorena Rodriguez,
from the Philosophy track; Rob Bentley,
from the History track; and Michael
Thornton, from the Structured Liberal

Education program.
Pod Boothe, who with his wife Katie
donated the Boothe awards to Stanford,
said the awards were established to com
pensate for the failure of humanities
alumni to "make the heavy (monetary)
contribution" to their department that
science-oriented graduates make to
theirs.
