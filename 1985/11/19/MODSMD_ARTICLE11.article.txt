# Philippines Must Promote Reforms, Expert Asserts

"The new elections in the Philippines have
to coincide with the interests of the Filipino
people, not just with those in power," said
Sergy Floro, a staff member with the
Philippine Resource Center at Berkeley.
In a speech yesterday at Bechtel Interna
tional Center, Floro, who is also a doctoral
student at Stanford's Food Research In
stitute, said the major problems of the
Filipino people — unemployment, poverty
and inflation — will not be completely ad
dressed or solved by the upcoming elec
tions. Instead, she said, "meaningful struc
tural changes (in government) which are
long overdue will have to occur."
Floro presented five paradoxes of the
"Philippine situation." First, the Philippines
is a nation of 55 million and gained its formal
independence in 1946, yet the country does
not have "real independence because of the
entrenched foreign interest."
Second, although the Philippines is rich in
natural and human resources, "poverty and
hunger abound." Third, Floro said the
"Filipino people are peace-loving and just

but are increasingly besieged by gross viola
tion of human rights."
Fourth, the Philippine constitution
guarantees a bill of rights for all, but in
reality the rights are given to an elite few.
Fifth, the government is called a
democracy, but "rule is implemented by one
man, Ferdinand Marcos." Marcos, who has
been president for 20 years, proclaimed
martial law in 1972.
"U.S. policy has always played an impor
tant, decisive role in the political, economic,
social and cultural [concerns] of the
Philippines," Floro said. She said the United
States supported the declaration of martial
law and has not questioned the legitimacy of
Marcos' rule. In her opinion, the United
States is mainly worried about "the uncer
tainty of the system of succession in the
event of Marcos' death."
Floro proposed three ways to alleviate
the internal problems of the Philippines: the
opposition should "continue to give pres
sure to Marcos and break his monopoly over
the political system"; revolutionary forces
within the country should be isolated and
weakened; and reforms, such as true elec
tions, should be promoted, she said.
