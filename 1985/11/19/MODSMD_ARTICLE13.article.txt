### 
"Armero doesn't exist anymore."
This is how an International Red Cross rescue
worker described the havoc wrought by Colombia's
Nevado del Ruiz volcano, which last week erupted
for the first time since 1595. An avalanche of snow
and mud broke a natural dam on the slopes high
above Armero, and the resulting wall of water
destroyed 90 percent of the city.
The death toll in Colombia now stands at more
than 20,000, with thousands more still missing — a
disaster on the scale of the recent Mexico City
earthquake. Add to this the tragedy in Colombia the
week before, when an attempted terrorist assault at
a government palace in Bogota left nearly 100
people dead — including members of the country's
Supreme Court — and you have no less than a na
tional emergency.
While the damage in Armero has already been
done, it is disturbing that some of the same govern
ment officials who are currently leading the relief ef
fort ignored warnings that the dam on Nevado del
Ruiz was ready to collapse. Colombian Foreign Mini
ster Octavio Ramirez Ocampo has said his govern
ment "took precautions, but it was impossible to
evacuate the population." Yet a report by the Inter
national Red Cross in September had urged Colom
bian authorities to evacuate Armero and other areas
downstream from the dam — a highly unstable ac

cumulation of sliding rock and mud — before it was
too late.
On Saturday, the government's health minister,
Rafael Zubiria, asserted that there was "no one left
to rescue" in Armero and called off the search —
only to resume it hours later when relief workers
reported that the cries of survivors trapped in the
rubble could still be heard.
Questions of government responsibility aside,
there can be no doubt that much aid is needed. The
United States immediately sent $1 million in relief
aid, in addition to helicopters and other equipment.
Europe has pledged $1.5 million. More help will be
required to account for the millions of dollars of
damage caused by the catastrophe.
Colombia has traditionally not topped the list of
countries to receive economic assistance from the
United States and other Western nations, so it will
take an extra effort to ensure the residents of Ar
mero can rebuild from last week's disaster. An ef
fort is already underway by Colombian students
here to raise funds to assist with the relief effort.
The consolances and contributions the Stanford
community can make to Colombia are great, as was
made evident by our gifts to the victims in Mexico.
Colombia must not be overlooked. The time to give
is now.
