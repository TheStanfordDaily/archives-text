# The 						Need for U.S. Intervention
## 
### 
Ask any random sampling of
liberals to sketch a picture of Amer
ican intervention and they will un
doubtedly conjure up an image of a
club-wielding, brutish Uncle Sam
pummeling a small, cowering
foreign nation.
Yet American intervention rarely
assumes such a grotesque form.
This does not mean, however, that
the United States does not actively
interfere with the affairs of other
countries. Ebullient rhetoric on the
respect Washington holds for the
sovereignty of other nations aside,
the United States is the world's
premier interventionist power.
Military force, while certainly the
most conspicuous example of inter
vention, is also the least used. The
United States acts mostly through
economic incentive and disincentive,
and through the support of sur
rogate entities. The motives for in
tervention range from strategic
necessity to moral compulsion.
America interferes with other
countries in many different ways,
and in varying degrees of intensity.
Regardless of its inspiration or
manner, the United States is fully
committed to a policy of interven
tion.
It is the very nature of a super
power to attempt to direct the ac
tions of lesser nations. The strong
are not content to allow events to
follow their own course. With the
power to effect change comes the
desire to do so. Throughout his
tory, world leaders have mingled
(meddled?) in the affairs of other
countries. Often intervention
meant the usurpation of foreign
lands. British imperialism in the
19th century and Russian im
perialism today are two examples.

The United States, in contrast to
past world leaders, has the idealis
tic desire to use its dominance to
spread peace and freedom. But the
motives of the strong do not alter
the basic tendency of superpowers
to monopolize independent deci
sion.
The democratic mission of the
United States rests on the twin pil
lars of interdependence and inter
vention. Woodrow Wilson, the 28th
president of the United States,
claimed the role of the United
States is "to make the world safe
for democracy." Keeping in mind
the potency of nationalism, it is the
ultimate goal of U. S. foreign policy
to create a world of peaceful,
cooperative democracies. The
United Nations and its predeces
sor, the League of Nations, were
two primitive attempts to push for
ward this democratic vision. In such
a Utopian state, all nations would be
perfectly interdependent and would
work together to promote the gen
eral welfare.

But with perfect interdepen
dence comes the need for perfect
(that is, unhindered) intervention.
Since in the Utopian model the
friendly democracies are intrinsi
cally linked, disease in one country
infects the entire global community.
Disruption, therefore, would be im
mediately quelled. Intervention is a
prerequisite for health in the demo
cratic Utopia.
The democratic Utopia will be
long in coming. But as the world
grows more interdependent, the in
stances of interference will also in
crease. Intervention is an un
avoidable and necessary component
of the vision of the democratic su
perpower.
Currently the United States is in
terdependent, but to a limited
degree. Yet the extent of American
involvement with other nations is
sufficient enough to prevent the
United States from allowing events
to follow their natural course.
The American economy is inter
woven with that of many other na
tions. American business trades ex
tensively in foreign markets. Loans
by American banks and the heavily
U.S.-financed International Mone
tary Fund bolster many Third World
nations. And Washington spends
millions of dollars annually supply
ing economic aid to less fortunate
nations.
The United States also maintains
vital military ties with other
countries. Besides economic sup
port, the United States offers mili
tary aid to friendly governments.
The U.S. armed forces lease bases
from strategically located nations
and devote much time and effort to
training the armies of allied
countries.
Simply put, the United States has
invested too many resources in and
depends too heavily upon other na
tions to permit them complete
autonomy. The United States will
intervene when it is in its interest
to do so. Questions arise concern
ing only the degree and manner of
interference.

For example, in a recent view
point (The Daily, Nov. 8)
Maragarita Ortigas voiced her dis
pleasure at the suggestion that the
United States could use military
force in the Philippines, but still
stated "if the United States must in
tervene at all, it can do so in the
economic arena." While the extent
and form of American involvement
in the affairs of foreign nations
depends on a multitude of factors,
the will to intervene remains con
stant. An appropriate response will
always be found once a power has
committed itself to a policy of inter
vention.
The United States will pursue
the form of intervention that
promotes American interests and
desires with the least amount of ef
fort. As long as they prove effec
tive, subtler methods such as eco
nomic incentive and disincentive
will be employed. More forceful
policies will be used as they become
necessary. The demands of the sit
uation, along with the will of the
people, dictate the form and extent
of intervention.
When the United States became
a world power, embarked on its
democratic mission and began an
outpouring of aid and resources, it
commited itself to a policy of inter
vention. Whether the country in
question is Nicaragua or South
Africa, both sides of the political
fence acknowledge that the United
States has either the obligation or
need to mingle in the affairs of other
nations. Differences arise only over
which forms of coercion to practice.
As the United States pushes
even closer to its goal of democratic
Utopia, the instances and intensity
of intervention will continue to mul
tiply. The United States, with the
power and the desire to spread the
benefits of democracy, fully intends
to direct the course of world
events.
