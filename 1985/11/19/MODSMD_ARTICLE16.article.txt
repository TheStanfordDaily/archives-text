# LINDA CROUSE, DAVID STEPHENS
## USW Plans for Future 
### 
First, we want to thank you — students, faculty and
staff — for your support during our negotiations with
the University administration. Workers in United Stan
ford Workers union (USW) were encouraged and hear
tened by your many acts of solidarity.
We are writing this article to summarize what's hap
pened, starting when we began negotiations last sum
mer and ending when USW members voted to accept
the administration's final offer. Many community mem
bers have asked us how we felt about the vote and
what's ahead now. This is an attempt to answer those
questions.
Administration Makes Move
In July, USW submitted its initial contract proposals
for improved job security, pension and medical benefits
and wages.
One week before the contract's Aug. 31 expiration
date, the administration finally responded to USW's

VIEWPOINT

proposals. The administration rejected every single
improvement, and instead counterproposed a massive
take-away of workers' rights, including the elimination
of paragraph 94 — our sole job security.
The administration's negotiators refused to put a pay
proposal on the table, refused to bargain face-to-face,
and then launched a massive public relations campaign
in Campus Report to ridicule the union's proposals and
to make their own proposals look reasonable.
USW's Response
We felt our best defense against this attack was a
well-informed membership and a well-informed com
munity. Every day USW members and staff went out
into the shops so workers could discuss these
proposals. At night we discussed them with students,
faculty and other unions. Our job was to get the issues
out in the open.
As a result of this, USW workers authorized a strike
vote, signed petitions, marched to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's office, took action in the shops
and helped prepare for a strike. Other unions —
Teamsters, Longshoremen and many others — wrote
Kennedy and pledged support to USW. Students, fac
ulty and staff expressed concern, the Student Labor
Support Committee organized support, the Co-op
Council prepared to feed students in struck dorms, and
The Daily provided fair coverage. Together, the com
munity and other unions put intense pressure on Ken
nedy to bargain in good faith.
The Administration's Response
The day after USW workers authorized a strike
vote, the administration bargained face-to-face and put

a pay proposal on the table. Under pressure, the ad
ministration gradually backed off from many of its take
aways; instead of eliminating paragraph 94 and all of
our job security, the University proposed a modifica
tion of 94.
Double the Wage Offer
Finally, in the last hours of negotiations, the adminis
tration almost doubled its wage offer for most workers
in the first year of the contract, moving from a 4 per
cent pay increase to what was effectively a 7 percent
increase. This final offer clearly was a move to defuse
an imminent strike.
Workers' Choice
On Oct. 31, USW workers were faced with a choice.
On the one hand there was a sizable pay increase
coupled with the remaining take-aways. On the other
hand there was the choice of going on strike, possibly
for a long time, to retain our rights.
Although the negotiating team could not in good con
science recommend the contract, USW workers voted
to accept it. Hundreds of workers, however, unani
mously voted to accept the contract under protest and
vowed to bring the fight against take-aways inside the
workplace.
What Was Achieved?
Many in the community were disappointed that USW
workers didn't go on strike. They felt the vote to ac
cept the contract was a retreat. That is true. It was a
retreat. But it was a strategic retreat.
Stanford University's administration is a formidable
power. When we take on the administration head-on,
we in USW have to win. Otherwise we could lose our
union. Many workers who voted against a strike did so
in order to continue building strength, internally and in
the community. When USW is stronger we will
recapture those rights we have lost.
What was really achieved this fall was the
groundwork to build that strength. For the first time in
many years there was a sense of community at Stan
ford. For the first time workers, students, faculty and
staff formed a beginning alliance because we all share a
common problem. We all find ourselves facing an ad
ministration that is increasingly "corporate," un
democratic and unaccountable to the community. We
all have little say in the decisions that affect us.
Experience has shown that students alone, or
workers alone or even faculty alone, have little power
when up against the administration. An alliance will
change that. If we in the community continue to build
that alliance we will create a wonderful opportunity to
make positve changes at Stanford in the future.

mously voted to accept the contract under protest and
vowed to bring the fight against take-aways inside the
workplace.
What Was Achieved?
Many in the community were disappointed that USW
workers didn't go on strike. They felt the vote to ac
cept the contract was a retreat. That is true. It was a
retreat. But it was a strategic retreat.
Stanford University's administration is a formidable
power. When we take on the administration head-on,
we in USW have to win. Otherwise we could lose our
union. Many workers who voted against a strike did so
in order to continue building strength, internally and in
the community. When USW is stronger we will
recapture those rights we have lost.
What was really achieved this fall was the
groundwork to build that strength. For the first time in
many years there was a sense of community at Stan
ford. For the first time workers, students, faculty and
staff formed a beginning alliance because we all share a
common problem. We all find ourselves facing an ad
ministration that is increasingly "corporate," un
democratic and unaccountable to the community. We
all have little say in the decisions that affect us.
Experience has shown that students alone, or
workers alone or even faculty alone, have little power
when up against the administration. An alliance will
change that. If we in the community continue to build
that alliance we will create a wonderful opportunity to
make positve changes at Stanford in the future.

First, we want to thank you — students, faculty and
staff — for your support during our negotiations with
the University administration. Workers in United Stan
ford Workers union (USW) were encouraged and hear
tened by your many acts of solidarity.
We are writing this article to summarize what's hap
pened, starting when we began negotiations last sum
mer and ending when USW members voted to accept
the administration's final offer. Many community mem
bers have asked us how we felt about the vote and
what's ahead now. This is an attempt to answer those
questions.
Administration Makes Move
In July, USW submitted its initial contract proposals
for improved job security, pension and medical benefits
and wages.
One week before the contract's Aug. 31 expiration
date, the administration finally responded to USW's

VIEWPOINT

proposals. The administration rejected every single
improvement, and instead counterproposed a massive
take-away of workers' rights, including the elimination
of paragraph 94 — our sole job security.
The administration's negotiators refused to put a pay
proposal on the table, refused to bargain face-to-face,
and then launched a massive public relations campaign
in Campus Report to ridicule the union's proposals and
to make their own proposals look reasonable.
USW's Response
We felt our best defense against this attack was a
well-informed membership and a well-informed com
munity. Every day USW members and staff went out
into the shops so workers could discuss these
proposals. At night we discussed them with students,
faculty and other unions. Our job was to get the issues
out in the open.
As a result of this, USW workers authorized a strike
vote, signed petitions, marched to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's office, took action in the shops
and helped prepare for a strike. Other unions —
Teamsters, Longshoremen and many others — wrote
Kennedy and pledged support to USW. Students, fac
ulty and staff expressed concern, the Student Labor
Support Committee organized support, the Co-op
Council prepared to feed students in struck dorms, and
The Daily provided fair coverage. Together, the com
munity and other unions put intense pressure on Ken
nedy to bargain in good faith.
The Administration's Response
The day after USW workers authorized a strike
vote, the administration bargained face-to-face and put

a pay proposal on the table. Under pressure, the ad
ministration gradually backed off from many of its take
aways; instead of eliminating paragraph 94 and all of
our job security, the University proposed a modifica
tion of 94.
Double the Wage Offer
Finally, in the last hours of negotiations, the adminis
tration almost doubled its wage offer for most workers
in the first year of the contract, moving from a 4 per
cent pay increase to what was effectively a 7 percent
increase. This final offer clearly was a move to defuse
an imminent strike.
Workers' Choice
On Oct. 31, USW workers were faced with a choice.
On the one hand there was a sizable pay increase
coupled with the remaining take-aways. On the other
hand there was the choice of going on strike, possibly
for a long time, to retain our rights.
Although the negotiating team could not in good con
science recommend the contract, USW workers voted
to accept it. Hundreds of workers, however, unani
mously voted to accept the contract under protest and
vowed to bring the fight against take-aways inside the
workplace.
