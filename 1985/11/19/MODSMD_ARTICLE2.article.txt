# Bonfire To Blaze Again
## 
### BRYAN WALSER Staff writer 
After a decade on the back burner, the legendary
Big Game Bonfire will rage again on the Lagunita
lakebed.
With torch time set at 10 p.m. Thursday, the bonfire
will consume more than a thousand industrial wooden
forklift platforms, according to Mike Tuchin, chairman
of the Stanford Axe Committee.
The accompanying program will feature the entire
Stanford football squad, along with Coach Jack Elway
and Athletic Director Andy Geiger.-The Band will hold
a typical rally, according to Tuchin, and the Fleet
Street singers will also perform. Also appearing will be
a yell leader from the Class of '35, and the surviving
local members of the Immortal 21, responsible for the
recapture of the Axe from Berkeley in 1930.
"The bonfire that we will have is going to be superior
to anything that has gone before," said Scott Martin,

bonfire chairman for the Axe Committee. "Since it will
be on Thursday, rather than Friday, it stands by itself
and has its own program. Previous bonfires were
usually just someplace to get drunk between Gaities
and the San Francisco rally."
Alcohol will be entirely prohibited at the bonfire, ac
cording to Tuchin, and 80 rally monitors will be on hand
to ensure that no one brings any illicit hooch onto the
lakebed.
The bonfire was discontinued after an abortive 1976
attempt broke the legs of two would-be builders, ac
cording to Tuchin. The safety of bonfire builders, the
lack of proper equipment and the use of improper
crowd control procedures all caused the administration
to deny the request for a bonfire in 1977, making 1975
the last year in which a bonfire actually went off.
Such often-cited concerns as waste and pollution
caused by the fire were actually of secondary concern,
Tuchin said.
