## Catch the Chorale Before It Flies 
### ALICE PETERS 
If you don't plan on wandering around
Europe any time in the next few months and
you're an avid fan of the Stanford Chorale, you
can catch the group's last performance in the
states for a while by going to Memorial Church
tonight at 8 p.m.
In anticipation of its upcoming tour of
Europe, the 30-student chamber choir will
perform the principle pieces in the tour pro
gram — works by Telemann, Schubert, Bil
lings and Mendelssohn — according to Direc
tor William Ramsey.
"The music we'll be doing this evening will
be taken from our repertoire for overseas,"
explained senior Nancy Asbill, a four-year
member of the chorale.
Embarking on Dec. 16, the chorale will per
form for midnight service in Bethlehem on
Christmas Eve, in Jerusalem on Christmas
Day, and for Pope John Paul II in Rome on
Dec. 27. The group's concert schedule in
cludes a joint performance with the Berlin Phil
harmonic and concerts in such historic venues
as the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, West
minster Abbey in London and Christ Church
Cathedral in Oxford.
Other concert stops will include Florence,
Venice, Salzburg, Heidelburg and Cologne.
"I'm really excited," Asbill said. "This is a
once in a lifetime chance to sing in a lot of
these places."
"They really have to be up for this," Ram
sey said. "The Berlin Philharmonic is one of
the world's greatest orchestras. The other
places we're singing are all very good acousti

cal and historical spots for the performance of
music."
In addition to all of their singing engage
ments, chorale members will also enroll in
classes at Stanford's campus in Vienna. "They
must take at least 12 units," Ramsey
said.
Ramsey explained the beginnings of the idea
for such a trip by saying, "The proposal was
made by me, and it's a joint effort — really by
the auspices of Overseas Studies."
In preparation for the trip, chorale members
were asked to learn and memorize their music
over the summer. "Everyone who is in the
group was admitted before school was out last

year," Ramsev said.
Officially, the chorale rehearses three times
a week, but some of its members have organ
ized additional practice times to get ready for
the trip.
"We've been having optional practices on
Tuesdays and Thursdays at noon," com
mented senior Joel Bosch, another fourth-year
chorale member.
Bosch modified his academic schedule in or
der to go on the group trip. "I was going to go
to Vienna last year," he explained, "but I
decided to wait and go with the chorale."
"It's just an amazing idea," Asbill said. "I
never thought I'd be able to do this."
