# Fortunetellers Forecast a Stern Future
## 
### ANDREW McCLUNG 
Good morning, everyone!
I don't have much to say in the way of
greetings this week, so I'll just wish you all
well and get to work.
I wish you well. All of you.
Do fortunetellers in California have to be
licensed in order to practice, and if so, how
do they get their licenses? Thank you. -
Camper Mike
I was more than a bit surprised to dis
cover that fortunetellers, both the crystal
ball-gazing variety and the more common
palmists, do in fact need to obtain a license
to practice their art.
Such licenses are not distributed by the
State of California directly, but are meted
out by the local municipalities.
This information comes my way courtesy
of Eileen, a clerical worker for the Menlo
Park Finance and Business Licensing Of
fice. She points out that the licensing is
fairly routine once the fortuneteller has
made it past the police, who are the real se
curity check on fortunetellers of dubious in
tent.
The upstanding law enforcement agents
are the ones who issue permits for telling
people's fortunes, and before doing so they

do some thorough background research and
fingerprinting to ensure that no practicing
fortuneteller is a serious fraud risk.
After the applicant makes it past the men
and women in blue, he or she must pay the
City of Menlo Park $180 per year for the
duration of the fortunetelling career. These
rates vary from city to city, but they seem
pretty steep to otherwise free-spending
souls like myself.
Sure, it seems like only .00057 pennies
per second, but it adds up. Because they
must spend that much every second just to
stay in business.
My question is: how do you know if
you're being defrauded by a fortuneteller?
If Theodore Streleski were to donate
$25,000 to Stanford's Office of Development,
would the University give him a prime spot in
the Chuck Taylor Grove to host an alumni
tailgater? - Stephanie Comer
I called the Office of Development and
was reminded, by a very genial fellow who
declined to be named, that California State
law currently bars Mr. Streleski from ever
setting foot on this campus again, for the
remainder of his natural life. After that, I
guess, it's OK,
Such was not formerly the case, but now
that it is, the University doesn't seem will
ing to let said Streleski make amends for his

past actions, should that desire ever seize
him.
There does not, however, appear to be
any legal machinery in place to prevent Mr.
Streleski from donating large sums to the
University and being rewarded with a tract
of the Grove on which he might host tail
gaters in absentia, but this seems some
what contrived. Personally, I don't think
this prestigious educational institution feels

compelled to allow Mr. Streleski to host
tailgaters anywhere on campus, despite the
celebrity status that now attends his name.
This state of affairs may or may not dis
may ol' Ted himself, who might fancy the
image of himself firin' up some dogs in the
Grove, his bright red pants and white shirt
dappled with the sunlight of an autumn Sat
urday, a rather fetching picture.
On the bottom of the cover of some Stanford
Bookstore notebooks, underneath the ex
quisite facsimile of the store, is the following
statement: "Made expressly for the Stanford
Bookstore, Standford, CA. 94305." Where
exactly is Standford? Is the Bookstore aware
of this misprint? Are they embarrassed? Will
they increase my rebate check substantially if
I act like I never saw it? - Tim Gemin, a
slighted rebate recipient seeking revenge.
Gee, Tim, I don't think it matters
whether they would increase your rebate
or not, now that this expose is appearing in
a widely-read publication.
Nonetheless, I sprinted to the beloved
bookstore and searched through the rows
of Official Stanford Notebooks. The only
ones I found that fit your description were
the yellow, 80-sheet, single-subject
notebooks that have "Stanford" printed
diagonally across the front. These are
priced at $1.09 apiece, and at such bargain

basement prices you should expect little
slip-ups now and then.
Preferably then, I suppose, but it seems
to have happened now, and the notebooks
do indeed allege that the bookstore is lo
cated in Standford, Ca. As you may have
surmised, there exists no metropolis by the
name of Standford within California, and es
pecially not within this zip code zone.
The bookstore staff that was hanging out
by the back counter when I brought this to
their attention did seem chagrined by the
revelation, but suggested that more
cataclysmic calamities could befall a busi
ness.
They attributed the misprint to plain old
human error, and pointed out that the mis
spelling not only did not characterize any of
the other notebooks, but also was not the
norm for our 80-page, single-subject
friends.
I was unable to reach the National Blank
Book Company of Holyoke, Mass. (the
printers of the notebooks), but presumably
one of their employees bears the ultimate
responsibility for the gaffe. So, if this really
incenses you, call them (an act that will cost
much more than the notebook, let me
assure you) and berate, castigate, chasten
and chastise them for their negligence.
Your devoted bookstore, apparently, is in
nocent.
