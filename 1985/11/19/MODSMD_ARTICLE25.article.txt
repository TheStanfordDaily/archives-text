## San Francisco Throws 'Un Ballo in Maschera' 
### NANCY HENRY Editorial staff 
"Un Ballo in Maschera" by
Giuseppe Verdi is a joy to listen to.
The music alone tells the dramatic
story of King Gustave 111 of
Sweden and his ill-starred love for
the beautiful Amelia, wife of the
proud and vengeful Count Renato
Anckarstrom. The orchestra flows,
taking us from the boistrous fishing
docks of Stockholm to the eerie and

enchanted forest where Amelia and
Gustavus (known as Riccardo) pas
sionately but shamefully proclaim
their love for one another, to the
frivolous yet ominous setting of the
final masquerade ball, where the
unsuspecting Gustavus confronts
the blind anger of Renato's jealousy
and offended honor.
The music alone is beautiful and
moving, but when combined with
the extensive ranges and pristine
clairity of the leading voices and
with the spectacularly designed

sets of the San Francisco Opera's
current production, "Un Ballo in
Maschera" becomes an aesthetic
experience. It pounds the senses
— piercing, then soothing the ears,
delighting the eyes — and mildly,
though not distractingly, engaging
the mind in the simple but noble
plot.
Opera is meant to be such an ex
perience, and Verdi represents the
ideal of opera. Imposing chorus
scenes that fill the stage and air
with strikingly costumed bodies and
perfectly harmonized voices are
balanced by self-indulgent but
enthralling solo performances. In
this case they were delivered with
emotion and poise by Carol Neblett
as Amelia, Fiorenza Cossotto as
the powerful and mysterious for
tuneteller Ulrica, Silvano Carroli as
Renato and Carlo Bergonzi as the
tormented King, caught between
passion and honor. They all suc
cessfully and completely generate
the intensity required of their char
acters.
Like the characters, each act is
unique, and not every scene is
equally effective. The final image of
the first act for example is one of
the most powerful. Against a tur
bulent, multi-colored sky, towering
ships' masis provide a frame for the
robust voices of a crew of seaman,
watching in wonder as Ulrika for
casts the king's doom. The mascu
line aura, enhanced by the richness
of the music, engulfs the women,
yet it is Ulrica who has complete
control and the only real power.
Other memorable images include
that of Amelia wandering aimlessly
in the darkened wood; alone, fright
ened and haunted by visions. She is
dwarfed by the massiveness of the
trees around her and seems at a
loss until Riccardo arrives. The

king, on the other hand, displays his
loneliness in the barren sterility of
his royal palace. Writing a letter to
honorably and self-sacrificingly
send Amelia and Renata away —
together — he visibly struggles
with himself and seems to be
defeated by the very structure and
order that physically, as well as
psychologically, confine him. In both
cases, the impressive set designs
by John Conklin dominate the stage
and establish a visual tone appropri
ate to the music and situation.
The final scene, toward which all
the others have built and which
might have been the most dazzling
is, due to sheer lack of energy, a
disappointment. It is at the royal
masquerade ball that the plot to kill
Gustavus, generated by Renato, is
carried off. The tension builds as
Amelia, aware of her husband's evil
plan; Gustavus, miserable yet
honorable to the last; and Renato,

determined and uncompromising, all
meet in an atmosphere of elegance
and gaity — where everyone dins a
decorative but deceptive mask.
Such a scene is prime for creating a
feeling of apprehension and excite
ment in the audience; but this time
the ball is too crowded, the
acrobats seem heavy, lacking that
sprightly spring that, if transferred
to the whole crowd, could imbue
the impending tragedy with an
added sense of surprise and irony.
But such is not the case. Instead,
rather listless actors belittle the
impact of the energetic music.
The only truly vibrant and en
dearing character in this tragic tale
is that of Oscar, the court page
whose cocked ears here all. Erie
Mills gives a memorable perfor
mance; her lovely soprano voice
emerges above the others on
several occasions without ever
overwhelming them, and her pres

ence on stage is always felt. She
provides a ready and much-needed
contrast to the heavy and somber
hearts of the other leading charac
ters.
Ultimately, "Un Ballo in Mas
chera," because the music is
Verdi's and because this production
is a professional and mastserful
one, is a powerful experience. The
extended curtain calls which follow
each act and are themselves fol
lowed by extended intermissions,
eliminate any danger that one might
be caught up for more than an in
stant in the drama of the whole af
fair, yet the opera leaves the
senses satisfyingly satiated.
One word of warning: The San
Francisco Chronicle published an
incorrect curtain time for the Wed
nesday night performance. Call the
Opera Box Office before leaving for
San Francisco.

Carol Neblett, as the beautiful and honorable victim of love, cannot stop tragedy from happening
in "Un Ballo in Maschera."
"Un Ballo in Maschera" by
Giuseppe Verdi is a joy to listen to.
The music alone tells the dramatic
story of King Gustave 111 of
Sweden and his ill-starred love for
the beautiful Amelia, wife of the
proud and vengeful Count Renato
Anckarstrom. The orchestra flows,
taking us from the boistrous fishing
docks of Stockholm to the eerie and

enchanted forest where Amelia and
Gustavus (known as Riccardo) pas
sionately but shamefully proclaim
their love for one another, to the
frivolous yet ominous setting of the
final masquerade ball, where the
unsuspecting Gustavus confronts
the blind anger of Renato's jealousy
and offended honor.
The music alone is beautiful and
moving, but when combined with
the extensive ranges and pristine
clairity of the leading voices and
with the spectacularly designed

sets of the San Francisco Opera's
current production, "Un Ballo in
Maschera" becomes an aesthetic
experience. It pounds the senses
— piercing, then soothing the ears,
delighting the eyes — and mildly,
though not distractingly, engaging
the mind in the simple but noble
plot.
Opera is meant to be such an ex
perience, and Verdi represents the
ideal of opera. Imposing chorus
scenes that fill the stage and air
with strikingly costumed bodies and
perfectly harmonized voices are
balanced by self-indulgent but
enthralling solo performances. In
this case they were delivered with
emotion and poise by Carol Neblett
as Amelia, Fiorenza Cossotto as
the powerful and mysterious for
tuneteller Ulrica, Silvano Carroli as
Renato and Carlo Bergonzi as the
tormented King, caught between
passion and honor. They all suc
cessfully and completely generate
the intensity required of their char
acters.
Like the characters, each act is
unique, and not every scene is
equally effective. The final image of
the first act for example is one of
the most powerful. Against a tur
bulent, multi-colored sky, towering
ships' masis provide a frame for the
robust voices of a crew of seaman,
watching in wonder as Ulrika for
casts the king's doom. The mascu
line aura, enhanced by the richness
of the music, engulfs the women,
yet it is Ulrica who has complete
control and the only real power.
Other memorable images include
that of Amelia wandering aimlessly
in the darkened wood; alone, fright
ened and haunted by visions. She is
dwarfed by the massiveness of the
trees around her and seems at a
loss until Riccardo arrives. The

king, on the other hand, displays his
loneliness in the barren sterility of
his royal palace. Writing a letter to
honorably and self-sacrificingly
send Amelia and Renata away —
together — he visibly struggles
with himself and seems to be
defeated by the very structure and
order that physically, as well as
psychologically, confine him. In both
cases, the impressive set designs
by John Conklin dominate the stage
and establish a visual tone appropri
ate to the music and situation.
The final scene, toward which all
the others have built and which
might have been the most dazzling
is, due to sheer lack of energy, a
disappointment. It is at the royal
masquerade ball that the plot to kill
Gustavus, generated by Renato, is
carried off. The tension builds as
Amelia, aware of her husband's evil
plan; Gustavus, miserable yet
honorable to the last; and Renato,

determined and uncompromising, all
meet in an atmosphere of elegance
and gaity — where everyone dins a
decorative but deceptive mask.
Such a scene is prime for creating a
feeling of apprehension and excite
ment in the audience; but this time
the ball is too crowded, the
acrobats seem heavy, lacking that
sprightly spring that, if transferred
to the whole crowd, could imbue
the impending tragedy with an
added sense of surprise and irony.
But such is not the case. Instead,
rather listless actors belittle the
impact of the energetic music.
The only truly vibrant and en
dearing character in this tragic tale
is that of Oscar, the court page
whose cocked ears here all. Erie
Mills gives a memorable perfor
mance; her lovely soprano voice
emerges above the others on
several occasions without ever
overwhelming them, and her pres

ence on stage is always felt. She
provides a ready and much-needed
contrast to the heavy and somber
hearts of the other leading charac
ters.
Ultimately, "Un Ballo in Mas
chera," because the music is
Verdi's and because this production
is a professional and mastserful
one, is a powerful experience. The
extended curtain calls which follow
each act and are themselves fol
lowed by extended intermissions,
eliminate any danger that one might
be caught up for more than an in
stant in the drama of the whole af
fair, yet the opera leaves the
senses satisfyingly satiated.
One word of warning: The San
Francisco Chronicle published an
incorrect curtain time for the Wed
nesday night performance. Call the
Opera Box Office before leaving for
San Francisco.
