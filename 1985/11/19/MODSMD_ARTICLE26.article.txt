# Church Hosts MacLeish's 'J.B.'
## 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
To stage a verse play like Ar
chibald MacLeish's "J. 8." is no easy
task, yet director Mitch Rudominer
and producer John Paff's attempt
Thursday, Friday and Saturday was
direct and unabashed. The produc
tion, set in Memorial Church, of
fered theater in which every move
was meant to be a sweep through
vast metaphorical expanse.
This is as it should be, since
MacLeish meant his work to be an
incisive symbolic link between th®

story of Job in the Old Testament
and the reality of personal conflicts
of faith in the modern world. The
mythic nature of the play leaves
little room for bare portrayals, and
everything must have an emotional
grandeur to it.
By and large, solid jobs of acting
kept the production from succumb
ing to a lethal overdose of over
emotionalization. Rudominer
changed the traditional popcorn
vender and ballon man who sym
bolize the battle between Satan and
God over Job's soul to a janitor
fplaved --'--v, —* gusto by

Ron Clemens, clearly a veteran of
the dramatic scene) and an indeter
minate person clothed in jeans and
button-down shirt (Rudy Loh
meyer, who turned in a perfor
mance of great bravado and
hauteur).
These actors enjoyed each
other's company and made the
dialectic they had over faith and
divine justice into something more
than a murmuring of airy words —
it was almost a genuine dialogue.
J.B. (Giancarlo Ferruzzi), wife
Sarah (Karen Mary Davalos) and
the messengers Geffrey Janger and
Nicholas Anderson) gave well

rehearsed, occasionally overblown
performances. J.B.'s confrontation
with God, presented in tumultuous
trembles, and Anderson's recitation
of verse like "Death is a bone that
stammers/a tooth/Among the flints
that has forgotten" could have
stood efforts at restraint.
Perhaps the most effective per
formances of the night were handed
in by the three women (Donna An
derson, Sally Schnur, Juliana Prat
her) sitting and staring at J.B.'s
misery. They looked every bit the
part of the three crones in Macbeth,
cackles and all.
