# Penn Loses His Past Glory in Current 'Target'
## 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
Arthur Penn seems to be caught in the
worst kind of time warp. The director who
gave us "Alice's Restaurant" and the mas
terpiece "Bonnie and Clyde" in the late '60s
is lost in the '80s with "Target," a wildly
schizophrenic spy thriller starring Gene
Hackman and Matt Dillon. Penn's last few
films have been commercial and artistic
bombs, and though he seems to be aiming
for a commercial success with "Target," his
talents are simply too peculiar to sit still
while the flat, laughable screenplay by
Howard Berk and Don Peterson grinds
along. The movie is ostensibly a family
drama-CMm-spy caper, but Penn keeps
throwing curves at the material.
Penn, Berk and Peterson transplant
generation-gap family drama from the '50s
into a '60s Cold War thriller. What we get on
the screen is Hackman as Walter Lloyd, a
Texas lumberyard worker, trying to com
municate with his "rebel" son Chris (Dillon)
in the early scenes of the movie. We see
right away that Dad is hip in a stodgy sort of
way, and Chris is really just a confused kid

worried about his future; he works with
race cars, and Walter wants him to go to
college. Fortunately, this "Happy Days"
scenario goes awry quickly when Mom
(Gayle Hunnicutt) gets kidnapped in
Europe and the father and son fly to her
rescue.
The filmmakers' Europe is crawling with
spies and counterspies, and by the way that
Walter starts to move and act it's readily ap
parent that this is no average concerned
family man. Soon Walt and Chris are saving
each other's life, wielding guns, driving fast
and, of course, communicating and devel
oping mutual respect. After Chris gets over
his initial reservations about Dad's sordid
past, they start hugging and slapping each
other around to indicate affection and cam
raderie.
Virtually every frame of "Target" shows
how bored Penn is with this material. He
has no idea what to do with a simple
father/son relationship scene; once Hun
nicutt (who provides a few moments of life
early in the film) leaves Texas, we're beg
ging for her character to be kidnapped so
the movie can get rolling again. Once in
Europe, we get to watch Chris realize how
wrong he was about dear old Dad, and Berk

and Peterson set up the pay-offs like clock
work. Chris makes a crack about Walter's
slow driving and seconds later we get a car
chase. Walter dispatches two goons in the
airport while Chris is off picking up young
women. This might have been played as
elaborate Reagan era parody; the father
wins his son's respect by turning into a CIA
superman. But the tone is wobbly, to put it
kindly. The mixture of realistic violence and
gangster romp in "Bonnie and Clyde"
served a definite point, but in "Target" the
spy stuff fails to serve the family drama and
vice versa, and the hyperbole of later
scenes serves neither.
The latter provides the movie's most en
tertaining moments, however. Penn
throws in a dying patriarch spy chief called
the Colonel and a German villian in a wheel
chair with a doberman by his side (in his
swaddled clothes he looks like Jabba the
Hut), and their segments degenerate into
hilarious black comedy. Penn must have
realized about halfway through the movie
that it was going nowhere, and attempted
comic resuscitation. He doesn't save the
picture (though he makes it more
watchable), but he does end up trashing any
credibility the serious drama might have

had; "Target" never completely recovers
its tone.
Dillon was probably drawn to this role by
its rebel aspects, without realizing the
craziness he was getting into. His natural
ness has carried him through other pictures
like "Tex," but he's never built on his skills
as an actor. With the skewed material of
"Target" he's critically miscast, and the
results are disasterous. Every outburst
rings false, and in one scene, when he fi
nally catches on that his dad was a secret
agent, Dillon has an incredibly bad moment
where he has to tear himself away from the
father he cannot face. I doubt that a more
appropriate actor (this is a Timothy Hutton
role) would be able to do much more with
this character, but he wouldn't embarrass
himself. The filmmakers repeatedly set up
Chris only to knock him down; it's a
demeaning role, and Penn exposes Dillon's
weaknesses with surgical precision.
Hackman glides through his part and
emerges, if not triumphant, then at least in
tact. Hackman uses his physicality for the
first time since Penn's "Night Moves," and
from the way he moves it's clear that he's in
shape. Hackman is on screen virtually all of
the time, and, though he doesn't have a

commanding presence, he holds our inter
est and doesn't look lost in any scene. This
may be a minor miracle. Walter isn't much
of a character, yet the strange tonal shifts
in the material would completely lose most
actors; Hackman's opaque intensity lets
him survive Penn's mood swings and much
of the numbing dialogue. He makes much
less of an impression here than he did in his
comic turns in the "Superman" films, per
haps because he knows how to distance
himself from a project like this one. He's
the most self-effacing of our major Ameri
can actors, and here it saves him from a
script that ensnares Dillon and Penn. !
I can't believe that Penn ever thought
that this screenplay might work. Whatever
ideas the movie expresses about family
relationships are so laughable that they
don't even provide the mechanism f&r a
simple thriller. Beyond that, mixing a cyni
cal "Ipcress File" espionage caper with
retro-'sos "Father Knows Best" soap
opera is so bizarre it's otherworldly. Penn,
who tapped a the American psyche in; the
late '60s with "Bonnie and Clyde," has;lost
his bearings in his recent movies-. In
"Target," he's looking for something in the
material that was never there.

family man. Soon Walt and Chris are saving
each other's life, wielding guns, driving fast
and, of course, communicating and devel
oping mutual respect. After Chris gets over
his initial reservations about Dad's sordid
past, they start hugging and slapping each
other around to indicate affection and cam
raderie.
Virtually every frame of "Target" shows
how bored Penn is with this material. He
has no idea what to do with a simple
father/son relationship scene; once Hun
nicutt (who provides a few moments of life
early in the film) leaves Texas, we're beg
ging for her character to be kidnapped so
the movie can get rolling again. Once in
Europe, we get to watch Chris realize how
wrong he was about dear old Dad, and Berk

and Peterson set up the pay-offs like clock
work. Chris makes a crack about Walter's
slow driving and seconds later we get a car
chase. Walter dispatches two goons in the
airport while Chris is off picking up young
women. This might have been played as
elaborate Reagan era parody; the father
wins his son's respect by turning into a CIA
superman. But the tone is wobbly, to put it
kindly. The mixture of realistic violence and
gangster romp in "Bonnie and Clyde"
served a definite point, but in "Target" the
spy stuff fails to serve the family drama and
vice versa, and the hyperbole of later
scenes serves neither.
The latter provides the movie's most en
tertaining moments, however. Penn
throws in a dying patriarch spy chief called
the Colonel and a German villian in a wheel
chair with a doberman by his side (in his
swaddled clothes he looks like Jabba the
Hut), and their segments degenerate into
hilarious black comedy. Penn must have
realized about halfway through the movie
that it was going nowhere, and attempted
comic resuscitation. He doesn't save the
picture (though he makes it more
watchable), but he does end up trashing any
credibility the serious drama might have

had; "Target" never completely recovers
its tone.
Dillon was probably drawn to this role by
its rebel aspects, without realizing the
craziness he was getting into. His natural
ness has carried him through other pictures
like "Tex," but he's never built on his skills
as an actor. With the skewed material of
"Target" he's critically miscast, and the
results are disasterous. Every outburst
rings false, and in one scene, when he fi
nally catches on that his dad was a secret
agent, Dillon has an incredibly bad moment
where he has to tear himself away from the
father he cannot face. I doubt that a more
appropriate actor (this is a Timothy Hutton
role) would be able to do much more with
this character, but he wouldn't embarrass
himself. The filmmakers repeatedly set up
Chris only to knock him down; it's a
demeaning role, and Penn exposes Dillon's
weaknesses with surgical precision.
Hackman glides through his part and
emerges, if not triumphant, then at least in
tact. Hackman uses his physicality for the
first time since Penn's "Night Moves," and
from the way he moves it's clear that he's in
shape. Hackman is on screen virtually all of
the time, and, though he doesn't have a

commanding presence, he holds our inter
est and doesn't look lost in any scene. This
may be a minor miracle. Walter isn't much
of a character, yet the strange tonal shifts
in the material would completely lose most
actors; Hackman's opaque intensity lets
him survive Penn's mood swings and much
of the numbing dialogue. He makes much
less of an impression here than he did in his
comic turns in the "Superman" films, per
haps because he knows how to distance
himself from a project like this one. He's
the most self-effacing of our major Ameri
can actors, and here it saves him from a
script that ensnares Dillon and Penn. !
I can't believe that Penn ever thought
that this screenplay might work. Whatever
ideas the movie expresses about family
relationships are so laughable that they
don't even provide the mechanism f&r a
simple thriller. Beyond that, mixing a cyni
cal "Ipcress File" espionage caper with
retro-'sos "Father Knows Best" soap
opera is so bizarre it's otherworldly. Penn,
who tapped a the American psyche in; the
late '60s with "Bonnie and Clyde," has;lost
his bearings in his recent movies-. In
"Target," he's looking for something in the
material that was never there.
Arthur Penn seems to be caught in the
worst kind of time warp. The director who
gave us "Alice's Restaurant" and the mas
terpiece "Bonnie and Clyde" in the late '60s
is lost in the '80s with "Target," a wildly
schizophrenic spy thriller starring Gene
Hackman and Matt Dillon. Penn's last few
films have been commercial and artistic
bombs, and though he seems to be aiming
for a commercial success with "Target," his
talents are simply too peculiar to sit still
while the flat, laughable screenplay by
Howard Berk and Don Peterson grinds
along. The movie is ostensibly a family
drama-CMm-spy caper, but Penn keeps
throwing curves at the material.
Penn, Berk and Peterson transplant
generation-gap family drama from the '50s
into a '60s Cold War thriller. What we get on
the screen is Hackman as Walter Lloyd, a
Texas lumberyard worker, trying to com
municate with his "rebel" son Chris (Dillon)
in the early scenes of the movie. We see
right away that Dad is hip in a stodgy sort of
way, and Chris is really just a confused kid

worried about his future; he works with
race cars, and Walter wants him to go to
college. Fortunately, this "Happy Days"
scenario goes awry quickly when Mom
(Gayle Hunnicutt) gets kidnapped in
Europe and the father and son fly to her
rescue.
The filmmakers' Europe is crawling with
spies and counterspies, and by the way that
Walter starts to move and act it's readily ap
parent that this is no average concerned
family man. Soon Walt and Chris are saving
each other's life, wielding guns, driving fast
and, of course, communicating and devel
oping mutual respect. After Chris gets over
his initial reservations about Dad's sordid
past, they start hugging and slapping each
other around to indicate affection and cam
raderie.
