# Symphony Takes the Bad With the Good
## 
### ROBERT BLUMEN 
Sandra Lau's brilliant performance of the Rach
maninov's Concerto No. 3 for Piano and Orchestra was
the highlight of the Stanford Symphony Orchestra's
Friday evening concert at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The concerto was preceded on the program by Bee
thoven's Symphony No. 6 in F Major, the "Pastoral"
symphony. Director Andor Toth conducted both
works.
Rachmaninov's third concerto, although written
after 1900, lies clearly in the mainstream of the
Romantic movement of the previous century. It is an
unmistakably Russian work; its wistful Slavic themes
are reminiscent of Tchaikovsky. The third is one of the
most difficult works for the soloist in the concerto
repertory. After opening with a simple, soulful melody,
the first movement develops into a voluptuous diplay of
pianistic richness. The cadenza reiterates the opening
and second themes with cascading arpeggios and crash
waterfalls of thick chords. An opulent sound is
achieved with a dense texture of notes, ornamented by
dizzing figures at the high end of the keyboard.
• Award-winning student soloist Lau rose im
pressively to the challenge of the work. She played
with poise, polish and dazzling dexterity. Lau demon
strated complete mastery of the imposing pianistic dif
ficulties of the concerto: all the notes were there, clean
and confidently sounded.
Lau was never gushing or overly rich. She played
the concerto in the style of a Mozart piano concerto,

without the intense emotional extremes of Vladimir
Horowitz's version of this piece.
From the first entrance of the piano, Lau was cap
tivating. She articulated the first theme with a delicate
dynamic nuances, poignantly stating the simple Rus
sian melody. She was no less enthralling in the heavier
passages, painting a pianistic picture in dark colors.
Rachmaninov's third concerto is primarily a

showcase for the pianist. The orchestra does not have
extended passages of much importance and does not
have a dominant role in its dialogue with the piano.
Toth led the orchestra in an appropriately subsidary
role. He followed the soloist faithfully, never over
powering the piano except at the very end.
The concerto is mostly dark in tone color, but Toth
brought out the few bright moments developing an in

teresting and welcome contrast. When it was the or
chestra's turn, they played expressively, especially the
lush, silky music of the strings.
Lau and the orchestra made the evening memorable,
after a truly forgettable performance of Beethoven's
"Pastoral" symphony which opened the concert. The
sixth symphony of Beethoven is meant to express
feeling associated with nature and the country life.
Toth's conducting was dull; the dynamics had no
subtle shadings; everything was loud, soft or right
down the middle. The sixth symphony is somewhat
lacking in thematic development compared to other
Beethoven symphonies, but what makes it interesting
is its variety of tones and colors. Toth did not draw a
sufficient contrast between lyrical and staccato, be
tween light and dark, to make the peformance exciting.
He further reduced the tonal spectrum by obscuring
many important statements by brass and woodwinds
with too much sound from the strings.
The playing of the orchestra left something to be
desired as well. The violins had pitch problems. They
were not together in the rapid arpeggios and figures,
making them muddy. They were choppy in the serene,
lyrical passages. Several of the wind players were dis
appointing, missing notes in solos. The principal
clarinet and flute players were inconsistent, producing
some eloquent solos but sounding timid and unsure in
others.
Despite mixed results, the evening was worthwhile.
The splendid Rachmaninov concerto made it worth the
trip.
