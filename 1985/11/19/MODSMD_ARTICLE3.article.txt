# Protesters Plead Not Guilty

### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
Twenty-seven of the 39 apartheid
protesters arrested last month at Old
Union in two similar incidents of civil dis
obedience entered pleas of not guilty yes
terday at the Palo Alto Municipal Court.
The 27 defendants, six of whom were
arrested Oct. 14, and 21 of whom were
arrested Oct. 16, were charged with
trespassing, unlawful assembly, refusal to
disperse from an unlawful assembly and
remaining at the scene of a riot.
Graduate student Eric Diesel and soph
omore Peter Heslin were also charged as
repeat offenders due to their previous ar
rests on Oct. 11, and graduate student
Bryan Van Norden and sophomore David
Potter were charged with resisting ar
rest. All four were arrested Oct. 14.
Judge Stephen Manley called the
protesters to the bench in three groups,

asking them to enter pleas and accept or
waive their right to speedy trials. All ac
cepted their right to a speedy trial and are
scheduled to return to court on Nov. 26.
Statistics Prof. Charles Stein, who on
Oct. 14 became the first faculty member
arrested in apartheid protests here, said
yesterday that "a plea of guilty is irrevoca
ble" and that he and the other protesters
are "not really guilty" of the charges
leveled against them.
Heslin said the defendants did not
decide to plead guilty as a group, but
rather reached their decisions individu
ally. "Given the reasons we [protested], it
doesn't seem that anyone there would
think he was guilty," Heslin said.
Most of the protesters had met as a
group with attorneys to get advice on
what plea to enter, and the information
they received led to a consensus that
pleading not guilty would be most practi
cal, according to graduate student Michael
Schmidt, who was arrested Oct. 16. He

emphasized, however, that each person
made an individual decision.
The majority of the defendants were
advised by Manley to go to the public
defender's office because they lacked
funds to hire private lawyers. Sophomore
Stacey Leyton, arrested Oct. 16, said offi
cials there made appointments to consult
with the protesters throughout the
remainder of this week.
Those who appeared in court yesterday
plan to hold a meeting Thursday in Tresid
der Union to decide on their next course
of action, according to Andy Frisch, one of
the three Council of Presidents members
arrested Oct. 16.
To date this academic year, there have
been three incidents of civil disobedience
in which 48 protesters have been ar
rested. All arrestees were participating in
Old Union sit-ins protesting South African
apartheid and Stanford's investments in
companies that do business in South
Africa.
