# The
						Visit Breaks Off Campus To Gain Following

### NANCY HENRY Editorial staff 
According to Marty Bedoian, founder and lead singer
of The Visit, the group plays "music, just music." He
and the other members of the band don't want their
sound to be fettered by labels such as "dirge" or "hard
core" rock. In fact, their music does seem to defy clas

sification, and there is no doubt that The Visit, as one
of the few Stanford bands to transcend the confines of
the campus party cicuit, has established a style of its
own, and a considerable Stanford and non-Stanford fol
lowing.
Saturday night atMabuhay Gardens in San Francisco
marked the debut of the band with its new drummer,
Rob Jancu. The change is not the first the band has ex
perienced since its inception about a year ago. When

the band first played at Splendor in the Grass and the
Beta Nooner last spring, it featured a female lead
singer, with Bedoian on guitar. But soon group mem
bers decided this was not quite the style they were
aiming for. So Bedoian, who had never sung before,
took over the position of lead singer, leaving the in
strumental to Lori Adams on keyboard, Murphy
Haliburton on base, John Hamilton on guitar. This
quarter, Jancu has taken over the drums.
Changes in the original songs, mostly the addition of
lyrics written by Bedoian, and plenty of practice, have
paid off. The Visit's aim, according to Bedoian, is to
"play shows with more established bands that we have
respect for and to headline some of our own shows."
Group members say they were pleased with their
reception at the Mabuhay and with the response of
their first demo tape, which earned them favorable
mention in This magazine, and an offer to include one of
their songs on an album representing Bay Area artists.
Most promising, however, are the gigs The Visit has
coming up. More spots at Mabuhay and the VIS Club,
but also at the Keystone Palo Alto on Dec. 3, and a
chance to open for a well-known British band, Love
and Rockets, at Wolfgang's in San Francisco Dec. 15.
Wolfgang's regularly features international bands and is
one of the largest and most popular clubs in San Fran
cisco. The group hopes its unique style, mournful and
haunting lyrics â€” like that of dirge music, accompanied
by rhythmic, repetitive and often fast-paced instrumen
tals that place it somewhere between hard core and
punk, will appeal to all kinds of audiences.
If The Visit's music does catch on, Bedoian, who
says he likes to keep his sights for the band high and al
ways moving, would like to see the group cut an album
by the end of the year. Everyone in the group is cur
rently an undergraduate, and all plan to be in the area
next year.
Is it difficult to be a full-time student and devote the
energy needed to improve and develop as a group?

Bass player Haliburton said, "I think we could
really get somewhere, but nobody really has the time."
The Visit's style is definitely not improvisational; its
performances are tight and well-rehearsed. If group
members can keep it up, The Visit may go far in the
world of Bay Area music.
