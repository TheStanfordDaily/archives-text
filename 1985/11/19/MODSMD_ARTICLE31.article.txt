## High-Flying Oden Leaps to Stardom 
### CHRIS MYERS Staff writer 
Kim Oden just doesn't seem like
the type who would spike a volley
ball in your face.
The Stanford senior has a very
pleasant, matter-of-fact manner,
speaks softly with an air of humility
and laughs easily and often.
In fact, she'd probably laugh if
you told her that many people say
she's the finest women's volleyball
player in the college game today.
But people do say that about
Oden. And it just may be true.
Facts speak for themselves.
; Oden, who will play her last
home game tonight against UC-
Berkeley, has collected All-
America honors every year she has
been on the Farm.
The last two years, Oden was
named Most Valuable Player of the
now-defunct Western Collegiate
Athletic Association, which was
probably the most competitive
women's volleyball conference in
the nation.
Last season, Volleyball Monthly
named her Player of the Year in col
legiate women's volleyball.
And the list goes on.
Oden is certainly not the only
great volleyball player on Stanford's

talent-laden and No. 1 ranked
squad. But at 6-foot-2, with
seemingly endless legs and a
strong, powerful style, she is no
doubt the team's most potent and
eye-grabbing weapon.
From her middle-blocker posi
tion, often working in tandem with
Wendi Rush, Stanford's splendid
sophomore setter, Oden unleashes
an array of hits that range in impact
from nuclear to soft and
strategically-placed.
Besides leading the team in kills,
Oden has the most blocks and has
used her quickness and agility to ac
cumulate over 200 digs this season.
Only junior Barbra Fontana has
more digs.
But beyond statistics and her ac
tual play, Oden, as the team's cap
tain and one of only two seniors on
the squad, is also Stanford's emo
tional leader. Her teammates find
her very valuable in that role.
"It's a pleasure to play with Kim
because she's always going all out,"
Fontana said. "She gives a lot of her
leadership on the court, through
her intensity."
"Kim is a great team leader,"
sophomore Teresa Smith said.
"She just is really sensitive to the
way people feel."
"Kim definitely leads by exam
ple," Co-coach Don Shaw said.

"But she's also well-respected . . .
when she has something to say,
people generally listen to her."
Oden sees her leadership role as
being restricted mostly to the
court.
"On the court, I think I'm
definitely a leader," she said. "I
think I try to make things happen."
Oden has succeeded in making a
lot of things happen in her four
seasons at Stanford and has been
able to watch as the Cardinal
women's volleyball program has
risen with her to national
prominence.
The Cardinal has improved its
season record as well as its national
finish each year that Oden has
played. The team finished fourth in
the nation her freshman year, third
two years ago, and second last
year.
Three of six starters from last
year's team, including two All-
Americas, were lost to graduation.
But the team's current top ranking
and 22-2 overall record speak elo
quently of how well this year's
players have overcome that turn
over.
For Oden, the team's success
this season has been "a pleasant
surprise."

Unless Stanford is declared a site for the NCAA's Western Regional, Kim Oden will play her last
volleyball game in Maples Pavilion tonight at 7:30.

At 6-foot-2-inches tall, senior Kim Oden came to Stanford a leg up on the competition. In each of
her four years on the Farm, Oden has led the Cardinal in kills.
"I really didn't expect the team to
pick up the slack as well as they
did," she said, before pointing to
the talent of the younger players in
the program as an explanation.
"When I first came here, Stan
ford got by with several players
who had only played a few years of
volleyball, but who developed into
great players while they were
here," she said.
"Now the freshmen coming in
have all played for five or six years.
They come in great and they just
get greater."
Oden herself has been playing
volleyball since the seventh grade.

"That summer, my father all of a
sudden became very interested in
volleyball," she said. "He had a
friend who coached a club team,
and he pushed me to go out.
"I did, and I was on the second
team. I hated it. It was really hard
and hurt my hands and arms."
Oden didn't know it, but that was
the beginning of what has been a
long and rewarding relationship
with the sport.
Through high school, she contin
ued playing for that initial club, the
Orange County Volleyball Club, one
of the first of its kind for women in
Southern California.
She also led her Irvine High
School team to the championship of
the California Interscholastic Fed
eration in her senior year, while

picking up all-league honors four
years running.
She ended her senior season as
the MVP of the CIF and the No. 1
recruit in the nation.
Her college decision came down
to a choice between local favorite
UCLA and relative unknown Stan
ford.
"I hadn't really heard of Stanford
until my senior year," she said.
UCLA, meanwhile, was not only
a known and local commodity but
also had a better volleyball program
than Stanford at that time.
On the last night before letters of
intent were due to be signed, Oden
chose the Farm. Looking back, she
has no easy explanation for the
choice.
"It was mostly a gut feeling," she

said. "I didn't know what to expect,
but I felt like I could belong here.
"I'm happy here. I know I made
the right choice," she continued. "I
like the idea of me doing it my
way."
While Oden describes collegiate
volleyball as "more than a full-time
job," she has found time to contrib
ute to Stanford in other ways, this
year serving as one of four senior
class presidents.
"I really enjoy it a lot," she said
of that activity. "I'm keeping in
touch with some people who I prob
ably wouldn't have otherwise. And I
enjoy planning things, understand
ing how things work."
Appropriately enough, given this
most recent activity, Oden is
majoring in public policy. However,

she has no firm career plans yet.
After she collects her degree in
June, she'll have an official tryout
for the U.S. National Team, which
will eventually go on to play at the
1988 Olympics in Seoul.
Whether or not she plays on the
Olympic team, Oden would eventu
ally like to play professional volley
ball in Italy.
Perhaps the most impressive
thing about Oden's tremendous
success is that, in her own and her
coach's estimation, there's still a lot
of room for improvement.
"As good as she is, she could be
so much better," Shaw said.
"There's no danger of her becom
ing complacent because I know she
has a lot to work on and improve,
and I make sure she knows that."

"I need to get stronger, jump
higher and read the court better,"
says Oden of the areas in which she
needs to improve.
"I'm tall and pretty agile, and I
learn pretty fast," she said. "I think
I'm pretty intense on the court. I
love to improve, and I think I'm
very dedicated to the sport.
"I guess I don't get tired of
playing volleyball. I just love the
sport and the people involved in the
sport."
And when Kim Oden steps off
the Maples Pavilion court for the
last time tonight, she'll leave behind
a four-year legacy of unparalleled
success that testifies quite
positively to her love of and dedica
tion to volleyball. The Stanford
faithful will surely miss her.
