## High-Flying Oden Leaps to Stardom 
### CHRIS MYERS Staff writer 
Kim Oden just doesn't seem like
the type who would spike a volley
ball in your face.
The Stanford senior has a very
pleasant, matter-of-fact manner,
speaks softly with an air of humility
and laughs easily and often.
In fact, she'd probably laugh if
you told her that many people say
she's the finest women's volleyball
player in the college game today.
But people do say that about
Oden. And it just may be true.
Facts speak for themselves.
; Oden, who will play her last
home game tonight against UC-
Berkeley, has collected All-
America honors every year she has
been on the Farm.
The last two years, Oden was
named Most Valuable Player of the
now-defunct Western Collegiate
Athletic Association, which was
probably the most competitive
women's volleyball conference in
the nation.
Last season, Volleyball Monthly
named her Player of the Year in col
legiate women's volleyball.
And the list goes on.
Oden is certainly not the only
great volleyball player on Stanford's

talent-laden and No. 1 ranked
squad. But at 6-foot-2, with
seemingly endless legs and a
strong, powerful style, she is no
doubt the team's most potent and
eye-grabbing weapon.
From her middle-blocker posi
tion, often working in tandem with
Wendi Rush, Stanford's splendid
sophomore setter, Oden unleashes
an array of hits that range in impact
from nuclear to soft and
strategically-placed.
Besides leading the team in kills,
Oden has the most blocks and has
used her quickness and agility to ac
cumulate over 200 digs this season.
Only junior Barbra Fontana has
more digs.
But beyond statistics and her ac
tual play, Oden, as the team's cap
tain and one of only two seniors on
the squad, is also Stanford's emo
tional leader. Her teammates find
her very valuable in that role.
"It's a pleasure to play with Kim
because she's always going all out,"
Fontana said. "She gives a lot of her
leadership on the court, through
her intensity."
"Kim is a great team leader,"
sophomore Teresa Smith said.
"She just is really sensitive to the
way people feel."
"Kim definitely leads by exam
ple," Co-coach Don Shaw said.

"But she's also well-respected . . .
when she has something to say,
people generally listen to her."
Oden sees her leadership role as
being restricted mostly to the
court.
"On the court, I think I'm
definitely a leader," she said. "I
think I try to make things happen."
Oden has succeeded in making a
lot of things happen in her four
seasons at Stanford and has been
able to watch as the Cardinal
women's volleyball program has
risen with her to national
prominence.
The Cardinal has improved its
season record as well as its national
finish each year that Oden has
played. The team finished fourth in
the nation her freshman year, third
two years ago, and second last
year.
Three of six starters from last
year's team, including two All-
Americas, were lost to graduation.
But the team's current top ranking
and 22-2 overall record speak elo
quently of how well this year's
players have overcome that turn
over.
For Oden, the team's success
this season has been "a pleasant
surprise."
