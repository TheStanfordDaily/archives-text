# Stanford Hosts Cal In Last Home Game
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
Stanford hosts California tonight at 7:30 at Maples
Pavilion in what could be the last chance for local fans
to see the top-ranked Cardinal women's volleyball
team this season.
"We're going to try to get the regional here, but if
not, it will be our last match," Cardinal Co-coach Don
Shaw said.
Tonight's match could also be the last in Maples for
seniors Terry Bryson and Kim Oden. Should the Card
inal qualify for this year's national semi-finals next
month, Bryson and Oden will have played on Final
Four teams during each of their four years at Stanford.
Oden — a three-time All-America and Volleyball
Monthly's Player of the Year last season — said that
the last home game of each season is always emotional,
and this match will be no exception. "I can't believe it's
the end," she said.
In order to make their last home match of the regu
lar season a successful one, Bryson, Oden and com
pany will have to defeat a Cal team that gave the Card
inal trouble Sept. 24 at Berkeley.
The score of that previous match was 15-10, 16-14,
15-9. But despite the three-game loss, Cal was any
thing but a pushover, according to Shaw.
"They're a good team," he said. "I'm not just trying

to build up the match. They played us tough at Cal."
This weekend Stanford had its seven-match winning
streak halted by defending national champion UCLA in
the opening-round of the Wendy's Classic at Stockton.
Despite the loss, the Cardinal did pick up two victories
on the weekend against Arizona and San Jose State and
raised its overall record to 22-2.
Shaw indicated that the loss to UCLA could drop the
Cardinal out of the No. 1 spot in the national polls.
"When you're No. 1 and you lose, (the pollsters)
start to panic and think they have to find a new No. 1,"
he said.
Regardless of which team the pollsters vote as No. 1
in the nation, Shaw believes that Stanford has the
credentials to be the top team.
"In the end you have to look at strength of schedule
and head-to-head competition," he said. "We're still 2-1
in three games with UCLA."
Card notes
The Stanford Axe Committee will be holding a con
test at tonight's match that should produce a large
crowd. The Axe Committee is going to choose the
group showing the most spirit at the match and will al
low that group to enter Saturday's Big Game prior to
other students.
KZSU, 90.1 FM, will broadcast tonight's match live
at 7:30. Tom Burgess will be doing the play-by-play.
Scott Fortune, a member of the Cardinal men's volley
ball team, will handle the color commentary.
