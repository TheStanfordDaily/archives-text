# Five Card Scotchers Named
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
The field hockey season is not quite over for
five members of the Stanford Cardinal.
Seniors Karen Chamberlain and Suzanne
Doi; juniors Andi Wolpert and Maree Chung;
and freshman Karen Jones yesterday were
named to the All-NorPac team. These five will
take the field for the Northern Pacific Confer
ence team against the All-Pacific Southwest
Conference team Nov. 23.
Not only does Stanford have five all-league
players on its squad, but one of them, Cham
berlain, was named Co-Athlete of the Year
with Chico State's Kristi Pavloff. Stanford's
Coach, Sheryl Johnson, was honored as Coach
of the Year.
All these honors are not too surprising.
Stanford, which ended the year Saturday with
a 10-4-1 overall mark, dominated its NorPac
•competition and finished the season with a 6-1-
.1 conference record. The three teams that

tied for second place each completed the
season with records of 3-4-1, six points behind
the Cardinal.
Besides being a top coach, Johnson plays a
little field hockey, too. She was a member of
the 1984 Olympic team and remains a member
of the U.S. National Team. According to her
players, she is not just on the Stanford team —
she is one of the squad's best.
Johnson said that her playing experience is a
great aid to her coaching. "Being a player
myself, I learn a lot (about coaching)," she
said. "I know the frustrations the players go
through."
Jones, who led the league with a goals
against average of one per game, can thank
Asst. Coach Noelle Mitchell, a top goalie
during her college career at San Jose State, as
well as Johnson, for her quick development
into an All-NorPac player.
But Stanford's unforgiving defense — its
strong point throughout the fall — was not just
the result of Jones' excellence. The San Jose
native credited Doi specifically, and the rest of

the defensive backs generally, as having given
her great confidence throughout her first col
lege campaign.
Doi, who missed most of the 1984 campaign
after suffering a fractured kneecap, said that
this season meant a lot to her, especially after
last fall's disappointment.
"It was probably the most fun season I've
had," Doi said.
Doi is the roommate of forward Maree
Chung, the team's leading scorer with four
goals and four assists. Doi said the potential
problem of a defensive player living with her
seemingly natural enemy, an offensive player,
is "no problem."
Being named to the All-NorPac team is not a
new thrill for two of the Cardinal players. Both
Wolpert and Chamberlain were on the squad
last year, and both were also West Region All-
Americas. Stanford's offense was designed to
exploit the talents of Wolpert and Chamberlain.
Johnson said Chamberlain richly deserved
the honor of being named as Co-Athlete of the
Year.
