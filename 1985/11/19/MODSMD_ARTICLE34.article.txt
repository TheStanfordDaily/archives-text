Cal students really hate Stanford
and that's why they get so excited
about Big Game, right?
Well, not really. As some of the
people behind Big Game Week fes
tivities at Berkeley explain, Big
Game provides an opportunity for
Cal students to rally around their
own university in a positive way.
"I look upon it as a time when
everyone can back one thing," said
Ruthie Souroujon. She is a
vice president of the Californians, a
Cal service group in charge of or
ganizing Big Game Week activities.
"Backing Cal — I think that's
what's most important about Big
Game. Everyone is happy during

Big Game Week," Souroujon
added.
"It's just a time where everybody
on the campus just comes together
for one cause, and that's to beat
Stanford," Cal pompon girl Maina
Kirton said.
"It makes Cal people feel a little
better for this school," Carrie
Cherman, Cal's head yell-leader,
said.
In recent years a Big Game win
has also helped ease the disappoint
ment of another desultory football
season.
"Considering the way Stanford
and Cal • have been doing the last
few years, if you can win Big Game
it can make the rest of the season
OK," said Mike Wandolewski,
chairman of the Rally Committee.
"One of the Cal songs is, "When the
training days are done and Big

Game has just begun.' "
"Both Stanford and Cal
have what people see as
mediocre football teams,"
Kirton said. "It's almost like
a fight for first place, but it's
not. It's like we're not as bad
as everyone thinks — Stan
ford is worse."
Robin Melnick, senior
manager of the University of
California Band, agreed. "No
one would care if we went 1-
10 on the season, if we beat
Stanford," she said.

The rivalry is also seen in a good
natured light by these Cal student
leaders.
"It's important for us to win, but
it's more just having fun,"
Souroujon said. "I don't think

anyone hates anyone. That would
be terrible if they did."
"I think during the week of Big
Game it's just good fun, but lately
on the actual day of the game,
there's real enmity toward each
other," Kirton said. "It can get a
little ridiculous."

Cherman said, "I think it should
be a friendly rivalry, but some stu
dents make it more than friendly."
"Deep down you don't hate Stan
ford," Melnick said. "Just in a fun
way you're brought up to 'hate'
Stanford. The Stanford Band is an

interesting group. When you meet
them individually, they're real nice
people."
"I think Cal students see Stan
ford as a rival that you can get emo
tional about, (but) it's truly a
good-natured rivalry," Wan
dolewski said. "After Big Game you

can still go out with friends
from Stanford, whereas, for
example, we wouldn't be
caught dead with (USC)."
Cal's last game, an emo
tional home-field victory
against the Trojans two
weeks ago, has added to the
excitement of Big Game
Week on the Cal campus.
"I think this year (school
spirit) is very strong on our
campus after the big USC
win," Souroujon said. "I

think 'Go Cal, Go Bear' spirit is
very high this year."
For these students, though, the
win over USC also marked the end
of the pre-Big Game training per
iod. Big Game truly is different for
them.
