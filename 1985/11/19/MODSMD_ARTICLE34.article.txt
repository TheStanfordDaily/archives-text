Cal students really hate Stanford
and that's why they get so excited
about Big Game, right?
Well, not really. As some of the
people behind Big Game Week fes
tivities at Berkeley explain, Big
Game provides an opportunity for
Cal students to rally around their
own university in a positive way.
"I look upon it as a time when
everyone can back one thing," said
Ruthie Souroujon. She is a
vice president of the Californians, a
Cal service group in charge of or
ganizing Big Game Week activities.
"Backing Cal — I think that's
what's most important about Big
Game. Everyone is happy during

Big Game Week," Souroujon
added.
"It's just a time where everybody
on the campus just comes together
for one cause, and that's to beat
Stanford," Cal pompon girl Maina
Kirton said.
"It makes Cal people feel a little
better for this school," Carrie
Cherman, Cal's head yell-leader,
said.
In recent years a Big Game win
has also helped ease the disappoint
ment of another desultory football
season.
"Considering the way Stanford
and Cal • have been doing the last
few years, if you can win Big Game
it can make the rest of the season
OK," said Mike Wandolewski,
