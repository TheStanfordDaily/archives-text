# Sailors Finish Fifth

### BRANDI WATSON Staff writer 
It was the women's turn to do the work this
weekend as the Stanford sailing team sent its female
side to compete in the Fall Women's Invite, hosted by
UC-Irvinu.
The team did well, considering it was made up of
only two sailors.
Stanford's Buffy Wendt and D.J. Berinstein raced
consistently Saturday, finishing fourth in most of the 11
tees run. Their cumulative score, however, left them
iifth overall, just a point out of fourth. San Diego State
won the regatta, with boats from UC-Irvine finishing
second, third and fourth.
"It was a good day of racing, " Wendt said. "There
was good competition."
The field of 12 boats from up and down the California
coast was dominated by teams from the South. UC-

Irvine "has a good team. They have lots of skippers,"
Wendt said.
The regatta offered tough competition for the
relatively inexperienced Cardinal team. Races were
close and the winners were not decided until the end.
"The fleet was close," Wendt said. "The finishes
were tight. The boats really stayed together."
The Cardinal's performance was all the more im
pressive considering one of Stanford's sailors,
Berinstein, was ill. "My crew (Berinstein) deserves
the purple heart award for effort," Wendt said.
Her performance and that of skipper Wendt were ap
preciated by Coach Joe Petrucci. "Joe was happy. He
had a smile on his face," Wendt said.
Although the regatta did not count toward national
rankings, it offered a chance for the women's team to
compete. Events later this year will be meaningful.
The performance of the Cardinal women in this
spring's Pacific Coast Championships will count toward
the ranking of the entire team, both men and women.
