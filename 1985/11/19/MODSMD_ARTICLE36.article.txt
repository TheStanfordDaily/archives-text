# Wright on the Money To Win Greek
## 
### 
For those of you holding your
breath in anticipation of the win
ner of the Stickney's Hick'ry
House-Stanford Daily "Be the
Guest Greek" Contest, the
waiting is over.
The winner is David Wright,
who went 9-1 to claim the dinner
for two at Stickney's Hick'ry
House restaurant in Town and
Country Village. Wright's only
mistake on the weekend was
picking Georgia to defeat Auburn.
A total of seven people went 9-
1, but Wright's prediction of a 24-
17 score in the Stanford-Arizona
State game earned him the prize.
The final in that game was 21-14.

Wright also used an interesting
tactic in choosing his teams — he
picked the home team in every
game. Auburn was the only
visitor to triumph. We tried to
contact Wright last night to in
quire about his methods, but he
was not at the Sequoia Hall num
ber on his entry form.
By winning the contest, Wright
has also gotten the honor of being
the Guest Greek this week and
making selections on our 15 top
games. Look for his picks in
Friday's Daily.
Joining Wright at 9-1, but failing
to come as close on picking the
score of the Stanford-ASU game,

were Judy Haymore, Joe Sinner,
Mako Bockholt, Andrew Green
halgh, Mark Alex and David
Quigley. "Four years at Stanford
taught me one thing — how to
pick football games," said
Quigley, a history major who is
currently looking for employ
ment. "I really needed the free
meal, too."
Among the almost 100
entrants, those came the closest.
As runners-up, they have each
won two 50-yard-line tickets to
the Ink Bowl — matching teams
from The Stanford Daily and The
Daily Californian — this Saturday
morning at Roble Field.
