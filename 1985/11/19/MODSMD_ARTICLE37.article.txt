Strife Spreads in South Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The deaths of eight more
blacks, shot and killed by police during a weekend of fierce rioting at
Queenstown, were reported yesterday as South Africa's civil strife
spread further across the country.
Police headquarters in Pretoria said that the eight, as well as a
ninth whose death was reported earlier, had all been fatally wounded
Sunday when police fired buckshot at groups of black rioters in the
black township outside Queenstown, but leaders in the black com
munity put the death toll at 14.
There had been earlier incidents, including several deaths, at
Queenstown, a severely depressed farming center about 400 miles
south of Johannesburg. The weekend rioting appeared to mark the
spread of South Africa's civil strife into yet another region of the
country, frustrating the government's efforts to confine and curtail
it.
Further incidents, among them the fatal police shooting Sunday of
a 13-year-old girl at Zwelitsha near King William's Town, were re
ported over the weekend and late last week in a dozen other towns
in the area, which includes parts of the two Xhosa tribal homelands,
Ciskei and Transkei, and the "white corridor" that runs between
them north from East London to Queenstown and beyond.
The Queenstown riots were touched off, according to black
sources there, when police swept through the black ghetto outside
the town on Friday in an apparent search for the leaders of local anti
apartheid groups, the organizers of the black boycott of white stores
and youths simply regarded as troublemakers.
This unrest quickly spread into neighboring colored, or mixed
race, townships, and there were repeated clashes between blacks
and coloreds, who are viewed by blacks there as somewhat
privileged and who, in turn, have felt threatened by the simmering
unrest and the extensive black unemployment as well.
CIA Suspects Yurchenko Ruse
WASHINGTON — U.S. experts studying the re-defection of So
viet KGB officer Vitaly Yurchenko are increasingly suspicious that he
was a double agent dispatched to debunk another top defector's
warnings of a Soviet "mole" within the CIA, senior intelligence offi
cials said yesterday.
The intelligence officials described the suspicions, which arise
from a new CIA analysis of the information Yurchenko provided
before he returned to Moscow, as "not a clear-cut case," and said
that CIA opinion on his reliability remains deeply split.
But they said that close study of independent intelligence data,
combined with disclosures Yurchenko made during his three-month
debriefing at a CIA safe house in Virginia, suggest a "clear pattern"
designed to steer U.S. experts away from a double agent.
Separate information leads those counterintelligence experts to
conclude that if a mole exists, he probably occupies a "very senior
level" within the CIA, said the officials, who spoke on condition they
not be identified.
The officials said that they were making the new fears public be
cause they hoped to prod the Administration, Congress and the CIA
itself into a thorough review of the nation's intelligence apparatus.
They added that President Reagan last week secretly ordered an in
vestigation the ClA's handling of all defectors.
Colombia Extends Rescue Effort
ARMERO, Colombia — Rescue operations for survivors of last
week's giant mud flow resumed yesterday under public pressure to
continue searching and, almost miraculously, several persons who
were buried for five days in this submerged, rotting town were found
alive.
Army commanders involved in salvage actions said they had
received fresh orders yesterday morning extending the rescue effort
for another two days, although they doubted that more than a few
additional victims would be located and lifted still breathing from the
mud covering this devastated agricultural community.
The captain said orders arrived at 6 a.m. yesterday stretching res
cue activities another 50 hours.
Concern that decomposing bodies, estimated at more than
22,000, were posing a serious threat of typhoid, tetanus and other
epidemics led to the evacuation of rescue workers Sunday and a
declaration from the minister of health that the disaster site would be
closed to traffic and treated with chemicals.
That decision, however, was reversed or overruled late Sunday
by other government officials after relatives of Armero victims ob
jected to halting the search for the missing.
Envoy Returns to Hostage Talks
LONDON — The Archbishop of Canterbury's special envoy left
for Lebanon last night to meet again with kidnappers of Americans
whose release he is trying to arrange. He conferred with U.S. offi
cials in London.
"I think there are certain things that I can now say (to the kidnap
pers) which I hope will take the conversations forward and help us in
this long and difficult process of negotiation," Terry Waite told
reporters at London's Heathrow Airport.
He left with obvious urgency less than 24 hours after arriving from
Beirut. He went there last week after four of six missing Americans
wrote an appeal for help to Archbishop Robert Runcie, spiritual head
of the Anglican church. He left on a Paris-bound flight and is to fly on
to the Lebanese capital today.
Waite spent the morning with U.S. officials who came to London
for the meeting, and conferred separately later with British govern
ment officials.
Waite said he remained "optimistic" and would stay in Beirut "as
long as necessary," but would not predict when the hostages might
be released.
Marcos Hedges on Plans for Ver
MANILA, Philippines — Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
said yesterday that Gen. Fabian Ver, the armed forces chief of staff
who is being tried on conspiracy charges arising from a political as
sassination, may serve as a consultant in a reorganization of the
Philippine military.
Marcos' statement indicated that Ver might not be reinstated even
if he is acquitted in the trial of 26 men accused of the assassination of
opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr. in August 1983.
A verdict is expected tomorrow, but the Supreme Court is still
considering petitions for a mistrial or a restraining order delaying
declaration of the decision. Ver has been on voluntary leave since his
indictment late last year. On Friday, Marcos said that the general's
reinstatement will be automatic if he is acquitted.
