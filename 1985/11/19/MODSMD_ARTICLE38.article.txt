# Summit talks begin today
## Officials Indicate U.S. May Bargain on SDI 
### 
GENEVA — President Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev prepared yesterday for the
first face-to-face encounter of their
historic two-day summit amid in
dications that Reagan might accept
continued restrictions on the devel
opment of his "Star Wars" program
if Moscow will agree that research
on the controversial anti-missile
system is permitted under the Anti-
Ballistic Missile Treaty.
And, while still expressing doubt
that a major breakthrough on arms
control can be achieved here, Ad
ministration officials said they enter
the first round of summit talks with
hopes that an approach they have
prepared for removing Soviet
troops from Afghanistan — while
guaranteeing the future security of
Pakistan — may win Kremlin ac
ceptance.
While U.S. officials indicated that
Reagan is prepared to be flexible
both on "Star Wars," formally called
the Strategic Defense Initiative,
and regional conflicts, Administra

tion tactics call for holding back until
the Soviets send a signal that they
are prepared to work toward com
promises on major issues.
Administration officials said this
waiting-game approach has been
adopted because the White House

is convinced that the enormously
popular Reagan can better afford to
go home empty-handed than can
Gorbachev, who is seen as needing
at least modest success here to
consolidate his newly acquired posi
tion.

Arthur Hartman, the U.S. am
bassador to the Soviet Union, said
that when Gorbachev goes before
the Communist Party Congress in
February to have his selection as
general secretary ratified, he wants
to be able to point to the summit as
an example of how he is capable of
dealing successfully with foreign af
fairs.
"There could be agreement in
principle that research is permitted
(on SDI), and that (agreement)
could be referred to negotiators"
representing the United States and
the Soviet Union at the Geneva
arms control talks, the official said.
Such a statement "could facilitate
things" in terms of eliciting conces
sions from the U.S. side, Hartman
added.
The president will be looking for
any Soviet move away from the
hard-line positions the Soviets took
during the Moscow visit of Secre
tary of State George Shultz two
weeks ago, officials said.
