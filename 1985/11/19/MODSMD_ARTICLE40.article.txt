Court Limits Awards
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court
yesterday gave the states more latitude to
curb soaring medical malpractice awards,
rejecting a challenge to a California law that
limits the fees lawyers can collect in such
cases.
Over two dissenting votes, the court dis
missed an appeal that contended the law —
passed a decade ago in a major legislative ef
fort to control rising awards and insurance
costs — unfairly restricted the ability of
malpractice victims to secure legal counsel.
It was the second time in the current term
that the justices cleared the way for the states
to enact such laws. On Oct. 15, the court
refused to hear an appeal to another California
law placing a $250,000 maximum on medical
malpractice awards for pain and suffering.
Dozens of states have enacted or are cur
rently are considering a wide range of legisla
tion designed to control medical malpractice
suits. By recent count, at least four states in
addition to California have enacted attorney
fee limits in such cases.
Americans Back SDI
A majority of Americans support President
Reagan's plan for a space-based missile
defense system and his decision not to use that
project as an arms-control bargaining chip, but
in the long run they believe the United States
and the Soviet Union should outlaw space
weapons, a Los Angeles Times Poll has found.
In a survey of Americans' attitudes toward a
number of critical issues likely to be raised
when Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev meet today and tomorrow in Geneva, a

strong sentiment in favor of arms control and
superpower accommodation emerged.
The views of those questioned reflected a
strong consensus favoring limits on a variety of
weapons projects, a belief that the United
States has sufficiently built up its arsenals, and
a continuing undercurrent of fear — expressed
by a sizable minority — of the likelihood of nu
clear war.
Of seven likely topics of discussion at the
summit conference, the first such meeting in
six-and-a-half years, disarmament was given
top priority by those surveyed. While the
idea of a missile defense characterized by the
"Star Wars" project, known formally as the
Strategic Defense Initiative, wins considerable
public support, the potential cost of such a sys
tem is a point of major concern.
Chemical Safety Plan
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
unveiled a draft of a national chemical
emergency preparedness program yesterday
and urged local governments across the nation
to voluntarily adopt it, warning that lives could
be at risk in the event of a Bhopal-type dis
aster.
In announcing the draft during a national
satellite-TV hookup, the EPA also confirmed
that it has identified an estimated 400 acutely
toxic chemicals found throughout the country
that could pose a serious health risk in the
event of their accidental release into the at
mosphere, even if the exposure is short-term.
The voluntary EPA program is part of a na
tional strategy developed in the wake of major
chemical accidents in Bhopal, India and In
stitute, W. Va.
The list of acutely toxic chemicals, to be

completed in December, will enable commun
ities to focus their attention on the chemicals in
their midst posing the greatest potential dan
ger and then develop emergency response
plans geared to local needs.
Kate Nears Landfall
MIAMI — People flocked out of the vulner
able Florida Keys yesterday and Gov. Bob
Graham declared a state of emergency in
South Florida as Hurricane Kate churned
across tiny Bahamian islands.
Boaters gathering to escape winter in the
North were told to head for safe inland har
bors, and residents of mobile homes and
beachfront condominiums were urged to find
more-secure shelter. .
At 5 p.m. EST, Kate's highest sustained
winds of 100 mph were centered near latitude
22.0 north and longitude 76.0 west, in the
southeastern Bahamas and about 375 miles
southeast of Miami.
Five to 10 inches of rain was expected along
its path, and tides four to seven feet above
normal were predicted for the area where it
makes landfall, the advisory said.

NEW YORK — Yesterday went into the
books as a mixed day on Wall Street as the
stock market churned through an erratic ses

Dow Jones's average of 30 big-name stocks
gained 4.93 to 1,440.02, surpassing the previ

Of seven likely topics of discussion at the
summit conference, the first such meeting in
six-and-a-half years, disarmament was given
top priority by those surveyed. While the
idea of a missile defense characterized by the
"Star Wars" project, known formally as the
Strategic Defense Initiative, wins considerable
public support, the potential cost of such a sys
tem is a point of major concern.
Chemical Safety Plan
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
unveiled a draft of a national chemical
emergency preparedness program yesterday
and urged local governments across the nation
to voluntarily adopt it, warning that lives could
be at risk in the event of a Bhopal-type dis
aster.
In announcing the draft during a national
satellite-TV hookup, the EPA also confirmed
that it has identified an estimated 400 acutely
toxic chemicals found throughout the country
that could pose a serious health risk in the
event of their accidental release into the at
mosphere, even if the exposure is short-term.
The voluntary EPA program is part of a na
tional strategy developed in the wake of major
chemical accidents in Bhopal, India and In
stitute, W. Va.
The list of acutely toxic chemicals, to be

completed in December, will enable commun
ities to focus their attention on the chemicals in
their midst posing the greatest potential dan
ger and then develop emergency response
plans geared to local needs.
Kate Nears Landfall
MIAMI — People flocked out of the vulner
able Florida Keys yesterday and Gov. Bob
Graham declared a state of emergency in
South Florida as Hurricane Kate churned
across tiny Bahamian islands.
Boaters gathering to escape winter in the
North were told to head for safe inland har
bors, and residents of mobile homes and
beachfront condominiums were urged to find
more-secure shelter. .
At 5 p.m. EST, Kate's highest sustained
winds of 100 mph were centered near latitude
22.0 north and longitude 76.0 west, in the
southeastern Bahamas and about 375 miles
southeast of Miami.
Five to 10 inches of rain was expected along
its path, and tides four to seven feet above
normal were predicted for the area where it
makes landfall, the advisory said.

sion.
