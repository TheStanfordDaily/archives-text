Rabin Speaks in SF
SAN FRANCISCO — Israeli Defense Mini
ster Yitzhak Rabin yesterday challenged Jor
dan to "take a courageous step,' as Egypt did
through its leader, the late Anwar Sadat, and
act alone among the Arab nations to negotiate
a peace pact directly with Israel.
Rabin, addressing a security-heavy
combined session of the World Affairs Council
and the Commonwealth Club, said "the
negotiations should be bilateral and direct
(with Jordan)."

It would be "understandable" that any such
talks would include the Palestinians "as part of
the Jordanian or Jordanian-Palestinian delega
tion," but never anyone from the Palestine
Liberation Organization, and without the in
volvement of the Soviet Union, he said.
Rabin warned that any attempt by Israel to
negotiate a multilateral pact with all the Arab
countries together "will lead nowhere" and be
"unattainable." Rabin urged Jordan to "take
a courageous step" and go into (direct)
bilateral negotiations with his country.
