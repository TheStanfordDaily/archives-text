Santa Clara County Supervisor Diane McKenna said
yesterday that she "expects Stanford (Hospital) will be
approved" soon as an officially designated trauma cen
ter by the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors.
An on-site inspection committee is scheduled to
review Stanford's application Dec. 2 and is expected to
send a positive recommendation to the board.
Stanford would then join San Jose Hospital and Santa
Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose, which were
both approved last Tuesday by the board as sites for
such a facility. McKenna said the introduction of such
centers is consistent with efforts "to become a full
service type of county."
The trauma center would provide specialized per
sonnel and equipment to handle extreme medical
emergencies.
"They will take care of major injuries, the kind that a
normal hospital is not prepared to cope with," accord
ing to Ron Goldman, a spokesman in Stanford Medical

Center's news bureau.
Critical patients are currently taken to the nearest
emergency room, which may not be able to provide the
sort of services necessary in cases of extreme trauma.
The new centers will be staffed 24 hours a day by a
surgeon, an anesthesiologist, an emergency room
physician, a radiology technician, a blood bank repre
sentative, a respiratory therapist and a laboratory spe
cialist.
An operating room will also remain open at all times.
A study at San Francisco General Hospital found that
20 to 40 percent of trauma deaths could be prevented
with such special care centers available, according to
the Peninsula Times-Tribune.
If the Stanford program is approved, all three trauma
centers — at Stanford, San Jose Hospital and Santa
Clara Valley Medical Center — could be on line early
next year.
Formal approval from the Santa Clara County Board
of Supervisors is necessary for trauma centers to ob-
