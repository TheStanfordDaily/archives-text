# Students Set Up Aid
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Staff writer 
Colombian students here have
organized a fund raiser to aid vic
tims of last week's Nevada del Ruiz
volcano eruption in northern
Colombia that left more than 21,000
people dead or missing.
The students plan to collect
donations for the Red Cross-
Colombia Volcano Relief Fund to
morrow at a table in White Plaza.
"The Colombian students here
had never really met," said
graduate student Felipe Jaramillo.
"But we came together for this. We
all wanted to do something to help."
At least three or four of the
Colombian students will travel to
Colombia within a month, where
they will "check whether the
money got there, and if it's been
used for the right purposes,"
Jaramillo said. "We want to assure

people that we'll do our best to
make sure that the money gets to
the right area."
"We hope the money will be used
to .rebuild people's lives," said
Colombian Bernard Mehl, a Stan
ford graduate. "The immediate af
termath has been taken care of. But
people's education has been inter
rupted . . . and they have lost their
homes."
The Colombian students are cur
rently discussing several other
fund-raising ideas, Jaramillo said.
"We plan to ask for a percentage of
the Big Game receipts, or we might
set up tables for donations around
(Stanford) Stadium at the Big
Game," he said. "We hope
[Stanford students] will be as
generous as possible.
"We hope the response will be as
large as the one for' the Mexican
Earthquake Relief Fund," Jaramillo
said in reference to last month's
earthquake in Mexico City.

Mehl added, "We would hope that
the Colombians throughout the
country are doing something to
raise money."
Several Colombian students at
Stanford have relatives in the
devastated area of Colombia, but all
of them are well, according to
Jaramillo.
"I just spoke to my parents in
Colombia," said Valerie Shalom, a
graduate student here. "They are
extremely upset, but they are also
overwhelmed with the international
aid. Right now, everybody in the
country is working very hard to
help. There is a lot of solidarity."
The Colombian students are not
an official organization, but accord
ing to Shalom, "After this we may
talk about forming something more
lasting."
There will be a box for donations
at the Bechtel International Center
throughout this month, Jaramillo
said.
