# Peace Corps Sees Twenty-Fifth Year
## 
### MICHAEL GOFF Senior staff writer 
Former Peace Corps volunteers, gath
ered here for an informal celebration of the
25th anniversary of the organization last
night, discussed the evolution of the Peace
Corps and offered current applicants the
chance to learn about various opportunities.
The first 25 years of Peace Corps have
seen a change from an "off-the-wall new op
portunity" to one "perceived as being part
of the establishment," Ellen Elliot, who was
with Peace Corps in the '60s, said at the
Bechtel International Center.
Richard Haavisto, a returned volunteer

from Mauritania and Rwanda, and one of the
event's organizers, echoed these senti
ments, saying that until recently, "people
were not looking so much at how this will
help in terms of a career." He said people
now are looking at the Peace Corps experi
ence as offering them "the time and expo
sure to focus in on what they want to do in
terms of a career. ... It is much more tied
to the individual."
Libby Blackwell, another of the event's
organizers, said that recently, "Stanford has
been a really solid school in terms of provid
ing good recruits." She said the University
administration has been very helpful with
recruiting and that the Stanford applicants have been
well-qualified and have done very well within the pro
gram. Peace Corps "falls in line with the Stanford com
munity" and provides "an opportunity to continue to
volunteer," she said.
According to Catherine Milton, special assistant to
University President Donald Kennedy, the near quad
rupling a few years ago of Stanford students interested
in Peace Corps may be "one of the ways to see how we
are doing" with the recent emphasis on public service
at Stanford. Last year, Stanford ranked seventh of all
colleges in percentage of the student body that joined
the Peace Corps.
Students at the gathering who are currently going
through the application process or are waiting to hear
of their assignments had varied explanations for the in
creased interest in Peace Corps.
Tim Harlman, a senior majoring in philosophy of sci
ence, attributed the interest to an "increased aware
ness among students of political situations."
Christina Fink, a senior in international relations,
said she looked at Peace Corps as an "exciting oppor
tunity to do something useful as well as for myself."
President John F. Kennedy signed the Executive
Order creating the Peace Corps in March 1961. Since
then, more than 120,000 Americans have served in
more than 90 different countries.
Blackwell said that "needs have changed throughout
the years." Countries have changed but education,
agricultural work and water resource development
continue to be the most extensive programs, she said.
New programs have been added, though, in an at
tempt to correct past errors. Blackwell said Peace
Corps is working on the "concept of partnership pro
grams in an attempt to bring in the private sector in the
United States."
Another new program in Africa assigns several
Peace Corps volunteers with different specialties to a

small area so that they can work together, com
plementing each other's talents.
Volunteers usually serve for two years and receive
training, a monthly living allowance, medical coverage
and a re-adjustment allowance of approximately $4,500
on completion of service. In addition, Peace Corps vol
unteers can defer their student loans during their ser
vice.
A number of returned volunteers said they found it
difficult to represent the American government.
But Laura Streichert, a graduate student in neuro
science who served in Nepal, said she felt she "was
representing the American people," and that the cross
cultural exchange was the most important part of the
experience.

The Peace Corps has changed
from an 'off-the-wall new op
portunity' to 'part of the es
tablishment. '

Approximately 10 percent of each class of Foreign
Service officers are former Peace Corps volunteers,
and 500 former volunteers currently work for the U.S.
Agency for International Development.
To celebrate the anniversary of Peace Corps, fes
tivities are planned across the country. On Jan. 17, the
Stanford International Development Organization will
present a symposium on Peace Corps and volunteering
to commemorate the anniversary. Organizers say they
would like to present a "critical, objective look at Peace
Corps." The program is scheduled to include a number
of discussions, including an evening panel discussion
with Kennedy and Peace Corgs officials from the East
Coast.
