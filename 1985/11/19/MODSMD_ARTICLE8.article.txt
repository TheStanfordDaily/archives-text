# Who's the Student in the Lab Coat?

If you are an arts or science major, or if you
just have extra time on your hands, you may
have what it takes to participate in the Under
graduate Research Program at Stanford.
Under the direction of Laura Selznick and
through the affiliation with the School of
Humanities and Sciences, the research opportu
nities at Stanford have, in recent years, been ex
panded to offer more opportunities for under
graduates.
According to Selznick, the Undergraduate Re
search Program is based on improving the
communication between faculty members and
students; giving students a chance to get some
thing of personal value from their education; and
challenging students to participate in the honors
courses provided at Stanford.
The program encourages involvement in
academia, but the opportunities don't always end
with the student working under the guidance of
the professor. Beyond supervised research,
there are opportunities for students to branch
out independently, creating individual proposals
and devising methods for adequately determin
ing the applications the research will have to a
major or field of study.
The funding for these student opportunities
exists in the form of grants of up to $2,500. All
students are eligible to apply in the spring.

Last year, approximately 84 students applied.
While 20 of them received Firestone grants (the
maximum $2,500), 34 received small grants.
The difference between the Firestone Major
Grants and the Small Grants — another form of

aid for undergraduates doing their own research
— is the expense of the requested reimburse
ment for a project, but more importantly the
scope of the question to be studied, Selznick
said.
Selznick expounded on many personal values
inherent in the program, stressing the opportu
nity to learn about oneself, broaden one's aca
demic background and focus on one's interests.
The undergraduate research program is
relatively new at Stanford. It is basically a prod
uct of the progressive action taking place to im
prove the conditions for undergraduates,
Selznick observed. In the last 10 years, a chain
of events has increased the motivation and en
couragement for students to get the most out of
their years in college.
First there was the re-institution of distribu
tion requirements that forced students to ex
plore other areas of interest and broaden their
educational backgrounds, Selznick said.
She recalled that there was a great deal of em
phasis placed on the process of declaring a
major. As a result, the accessibility of guidance
personnel was improved.
By incorporating undergraduate research into
the variety of programs provided at Stanford,
the trend has now shifted, allowing students to
lead rather than to follow in directing their aca
demic lives, she said.
