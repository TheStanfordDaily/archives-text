# Who's the Student in the Lab Coat?

### STACEY ESTRELLA 
If you are an arts or science major, or if you
just have extra time on your hands, you may
have what it takes to participate in the Under
graduate Research Program at Stanford.
Under the direction of Laura Selznick and
through the affiliation with the School of
Humanities and Sciences, the research opportu
nities at Stanford have, in recent years, been ex
panded to offer more opportunities for under
graduates.
According to Selznick, the Undergraduate Re
search Program is based on improving the
communication between faculty members and
students; giving students a chance to get some
thing of personal value from their education; and
challenging students to participate in the honors
courses provided at Stanford.
The program encourages involvement in
academia, but the opportunities don't always end
with the student working under the guidance of
the professor. Beyond supervised research,
there are opportunities for students to branch
out independently, creating individual proposals
and devising methods for adequately determin
ing the applications the research will have to a
major or field of study.
The funding for these student opportunities
exists in the form of grants of up to $2,500. All
students are eligible to apply in the spring.

Last year, approximately 84 students applied.
While 20 of them received Firestone grants (the
maximum $2,500), 34 received small grants.
The difference between the Firestone Major
Grants and the Small Grants — another form of

aid for undergraduates doing their own research
— is the expense of the requested reimburse
ment for a project, but more importantly the
scope of the question to be studied, Selznick
said.
Selznick expounded on many personal values
inherent in the program, stressing the opportu
nity to learn about oneself, broaden one's aca
demic background and focus on one's interests.
The undergraduate research program is
relatively new at Stanford. It is basically a prod
uct of the progressive action taking place to im
prove the conditions for undergraduates,
Selznick observed. In the last 10 years, a chain
of events has increased the motivation and en
couragement for students to get the most out of
their years in college.
First there was the re-institution of distribu
tion requirements that forced students to ex
plore other areas of interest and broaden their
educational backgrounds, Selznick said.
She recalled that there was a great deal of em
phasis placed on the process of declaring a
major. As a result, the accessibility of guidance
personnel was improved.
By incorporating undergraduate research into
the variety of programs provided at Stanford,
the trend has now shifted, allowing students to
lead rather than to follow in directing their aca
demic lives, she said.

By noting the chain of improve
ments that have taken place at
Stanford, Selznick said the benefits
have had an effect on upperclass
life.
The necessity of fulfilling certain
distribution requirements was
geared toward incoming freshmen,
while the provision of counseling
services for students who are in the
process of declaring their majors
was directed toward sophomores,
according to Selznick.
Although anyone may partici
pate, the Undergraduate Research
Opportunities were designed with
upperclassmen in mind because it
works best for applicants who are
already pretty clear about their
futures, their majors and their edu
cational interests..
Selznick said the majority of the
students participating in the pro
grams are, in fact, sophomores and
juniors. Approximately 200 to 250
students do research work through
this office annually for an average of
two quarters each.
Each student's motivation is as
diverse as the individual himself,
according to Selznick. Some stu
dents do it purely out of interest in
a particular subject or field. Others
participate to feel useful. Some stu
dents want to use up extra time,
while others like the idea of having
a personal hand in determining the
data that go into the writing of a
thesis paper.

Senior Gabrielle Glaser, a Stan
ford student and history major who
is in the process of composing her
thesis, received funding to conduct
her own research in Haiti last sum
mer. Her primary reason was her
desire to write an honors thesis.
The research was directed
toward the U.S. Marine occupation
in Haiti from 1915-1934. According
to Glaser, the research she con-

In the last 10 .
years, a chain of
events has in
creased the moti
vation and encour
agement.

ducted shed light on the di r ection of
her thesis and brought her closer to
her subject, allowing her to collect
data on a first-hand basis.
But why does the faculty partici
pate? According to Selznick, one
reason is their personal involve
ment in the research. With the stu
dents' energy, enthusiasm and as
sistance, professors are encour
aged to pursue their own hypothe
ses and intuitions.
She stressed that faculty mem
bers enjoy working with the stu
dents, and since the only compen
sation for student time is academic
credit, it is less costly to those
funding the research.

of events has increased the motivation and en
couragement for students to get the most out of
their years in college.
First there was the re-institution of distribu
tion requirements that forced students to ex
plore other areas of interest and broaden their
educational backgrounds, Selznick said.
She recalled that there was a great deal of em
phasis placed on the process of declaring a
major. As a result, the accessibility of guidance
personnel was improved.
By incorporating undergraduate research into
the variety of programs provided at Stanford,
the trend has now shifted, allowing students to
lead rather than to follow in directing their aca
demic lives, she said.

By noting the chain of improve
ments that have taken place at
Stanford, Selznick said the benefits
have had an effect on upperclass
life.
The necessity of fulfilling certain
distribution requirements was
geared toward incoming freshmen,
while the provision of counseling
services for students who are in the
process of declaring their majors
was directed toward sophomores,
according to Selznick.
Although anyone may partici
pate, the Undergraduate Research
Opportunities were designed with
upperclassmen in mind because it
works best for applicants who are
already pretty clear about their
futures, their majors and their edu
cational interests..
Selznick said the majority of the
students participating in the pro
grams are, in fact, sophomores and
juniors. Approximately 200 to 250
students do research work through
this office annually for an average of
two quarters each.
Each student's motivation is as
diverse as the individual himself,
according to Selznick. Some stu
dents do it purely out of interest in
a particular subject or field. Others
participate to feel useful. Some stu
dents want to use up extra time,
while others like the idea of having
a personal hand in determining the
data that go into the writing of a
thesis paper.

Senior Gabrielle Glaser, a Stan
ford student and history major who
is in the process of composing her
thesis, received funding to conduct
her own research in Haiti last sum
mer. Her primary reason was her
desire to write an honors thesis.
The research was directed
toward the U.S. Marine occupation
in Haiti from 1915-1934. According
to Glaser, the research she con-

ducted shed light on the di r ection of
her thesis and brought her closer to
her subject, allowing her to collect
data on a first-hand basis.
But why does the faculty partici
pate? According to Selznick, one
reason is their personal involve
ment in the research. With the stu
dents' energy, enthusiasm and as
sistance, professors are encour
aged to pursue their own hypothe
ses and intuitions.
She stressed that faculty mem
bers enjoy working with the stu
dents, and since the only compen
sation for student time is academic
credit, it is less costly to those
funding the research.
If you are an arts or science major, or if you
just have extra time on your hands, you may
have what it takes to participate in the Under
graduate Research Program at Stanford.
Under the direction of Laura Selznick and
through the affiliation with the School of
Humanities and Sciences, the research opportu
nities at Stanford have, in recent years, been ex
panded to offer more opportunities for under
graduates.
According to Selznick, the Undergraduate Re
search Program is based on improving the
communication between faculty members and
students; giving students a chance to get some
thing of personal value from their education; and
challenging students to participate in the honors
courses provided at Stanford.
The program encourages involvement in
academia, but the opportunities don't always end
with the student working under the guidance of
the professor. Beyond supervised research,
there are opportunities for students to branch
out independently, creating individual proposals
and devising methods for adequately determin
ing the applications the research will have to a
major or field of study.
The funding for these student opportunities
exists in the form of grants of up to $2,500. All
students are eligible to apply in the spring.

Last year, approximately 84 students applied.
While 20 of them received Firestone grants (the
maximum $2,500), 34 received small grants.
The difference between the Firestone Major
Grants and the Small Grants — another form of

aid for undergraduates doing their own research
— is the expense of the requested reimburse
ment for a project, but more importantly the
scope of the question to be studied, Selznick
said.
Selznick expounded on many personal values
inherent in the program, stressing the opportu
nity to learn about oneself, broaden one's aca
demic background and focus on one's interests.
The undergraduate research program is
relatively new at Stanford. It is basically a prod
uct of the progressive action taking place to im
prove the conditions for undergraduates,
Selznick observed. In the last 10 years, a chain
of events has increased the motivation and en
couragement for students to get the most out of
their years in college.
