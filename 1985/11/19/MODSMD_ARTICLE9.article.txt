# Kibbutizm Alter Sex Roles
## 
### NANCY HENRY Editorial staff 
Kibbutzim in Israel are currently attempting to
place men in traditionally female roles in an attempt
to dissolve the great division between the sexes
there, according to an Israeli scholar visiting Har
vard this year as a Fulbright Fellow.
The kibbutzim were founded during times of
stress, when physical strength was valued, ex
plained Michal Paigi, director of the Institute for
Kibbutz Studies at Haifa University in Israel.
Similarly, in Israeli society as a whole, women

tend to play a subservient role because of the con
tinual "state of war" there, Paigi said. Due to this
state of war, men are often away from home, and
women seek to make life as comfortable as possible
for them when they return, she said.
It is of great importance to be aware of the differ
ences in sex roles on kibbutzim, and the importance
of dissolving those differences, Paigi said.
Paigi offered her views at a Florence Moore Hall
talk sponsored by Stanford Overseas Studies and
the Haifa Program.
At Harvard, Paigi is teaching classes on sex roles
in society and on industrial democracy. She is also
continuing her writing about life on the kibbutz.
