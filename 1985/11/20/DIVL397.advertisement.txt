SUPER LOW-COST COMPUTERS FROM APPLE & IBM
The School of Engineering, IRSI, and ITS have cooperated in arranging for two low-cost
computer purchase opportunities which may be of great interst to students, faculty, and
staff.
IBM is offering:
IBM Portable Personal Computer
256 KB of user memory, expandable to 640K8
2 - 360 KB diskette drives
Built-in, 9" amber display
83 key, typewriter-like keyboard
Adapter to add an extra display
Five expansion slots, one long, four short
PC/XT technology
115/230V, 50/60 cycle universal power supply
COST: $1000 plus Microdisc 5% handling fee, sales tax, and shippinq.
WARRANTY: 1 year
APPLE is offering:
Lisa 2/5, with 1 MB memory, 5 MB Profile hard disk
Mac Works, MacPaint, Mac Write, and Switcher Construction Kit software
This Lisa operates all Macintosh software except that requiring sound and
performs like a "super" Macintosh with larger screen, larger memory, and
a hard disk.
Includes Macintosh pixel adapter so entire screen is used without distortion.
COST: $957 plus Microdisc 5% handling fee, sales, tax, and shippinq.
WARRANTY: 90 days
How to see the systems:
Both IBM and Apple will have demonstrators and staff to answer questions in the basement
lounge of Terman Engineering Center 10-4 p.m., November 21 and 22. Stop by and use the
machines and talk to the representatives. Specification sheets will be available.
How to obtain the systems:
Both systems will be available for ordering through Microdisc beginning on December 2.
The usual Microdisc eligibility restrictions and ordering procedures will apply
MORE ABOUT THIS OFFER
The School of Engineering faculty is increasingly using Apple and IBM compatible
personal computers in their teaching programs. Also, it is felt that Engineering students
need a working knowledge of pc's as they practice their profession. Therefore, students are
strongly encouraged to own their own personal computer for their convenience and to
prepare most effectively for their careers.
The computer systems offered under this program are not singled out as the best — they
are simply the lowest price suitable computers that we could obtain in negotiating with
Apple and IBM. The School feels purchasers should be aware of the followina
IBM: *
The IBM Portable does not come with software. It is anticipated that purchaser will have
to spend about $60 additional to have an operating system.
IBM officials have reported in the press, plans to introduce a new model of the PC
Portable. Therefore, this model may be superseded at any time determined by IBM.
However, IBM will continue to support and maintain this model. The present unit sells for
$2,250, in the IBM retail store; so a new model is expected to be considerably more
expensive than the present offer.
APPLE:
The Lisa 2/5 was discontinued by Apple in Spring 1985 because the manufacturing
costs were higher than the unit could be profitably sold for. At that time Apple
announced they would support Lisa and provide spare parts for 5 years. The system is
an "orphan" and purchasers should be aware that servicing may be more difficult than
for a Mac, especially at distances far from Cupertino.
The School of Engineering had heard some stories of reliability problems with the Lisa
and checked into this by interviewing the personal computer manager at GTE, the
largest industrial user of the Lisa. The interviewing panel was satisfied with the
favorable maintenance recommendation from the GTE representative.
The weight and footprint of the Lisa is considerably greater than that of the Macintosh.
BOTH MACHINES: The School of Engineering, IRIS, and ITS have made available
special purchase arrangements for these machines as a service to
engineering students and all of the Stanford community eligible to buy from Microdisc
These computers are not "recommended" above others but may be attractive to
individuals because of cost and performance. Stanford does not assume any liability
with regard to this special offer.
