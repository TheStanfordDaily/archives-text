# Sagan Urges Mutual Exploration of Mars

### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Americans and Soviets should
plan a joint manned mission to
Mars, astronomer Carl Sagan
told the president's commission
on space yesterday in hearings
held at the Durand Building.
Sagan, president of the
Planetary Society and host of the

public television program
"Cosmos," told the National
Commission on Space that the
two superpowers should "turn
over a new leaf by doing some
thing "on behalf of the human
species."
"Imagine a situation in which

States and the Soviet (leader)

sion on Space yesterday in Durand Building.
actually decided to do something to
gether," he said. "Soviet cos
monauts' lives would depend on
American astronauts, and vice
versa. It would be a microcosm of
the situation on earth."
The nine-member commission,
which includes former astronaut
Neil Armstrong and "Right Stuff"
pilot Chuck Yeager, is conducting
three days of meetings here to gat
her testimony from area space ex
perts. The Commission, which was
created to study the U.S. space
program and develop an
"aggressive" plan for the future, is
expected to submit a report to
President Reagan in March.
Sagan said that although from a
scientific standpoint missions to
Mars could be carried out more effi
ciently by robots than by men, such
missions "necessarily involve
politics" and that manned — "and
womanned" — space flights will be
necessary to capture America's im
agination.
"The (space shuttle) doesn't
capture the imagination of the
public," Sagan said. "But explora
tion does. It's working toward the
unknown, toward the future."

For similar reasons, the United
States and the Soviet Union should
carry out such a mission together,
he said.
Sagan told the committee that
while the Soviets are tentatively
planning a manned mission to Mars
in 1992, he doubts that it actually
will happen. "They haven't landed
on the moon yet," he said.
Although the unmanned Viking
Mars missions revealed much use
ful information, the spacecraft were
sent to "the two dullest portions of
Mars."
There might be forms of life se
questered in other areas, Sagan
said. "A billion years ago, the envi
ronment of Mars was very differ
ent. There may have been life that
has disappeared," Sagan said.
After the presentation,
Armstrong said Sagan's suggestion
for a joint U.S.-Soviet expedition to
Mars was an "interesting proposal"
that has been suggested by several
sources. He said, however, that it
would be "premature to comment."
Later, Prof. Ronald Bracewell of
the Department of Electrical Engi
neering here told the commission
that the search for extraterrestrial
life could have unexpected benefits
on Earth.
Tangible benefits like modern
telecommunications have come

from space research, he said, but
the intangible benefits are also im
portant.
"It is not possible to prove that
we are alone, but it could be proved
that we are not alone, he said. To
prove that, we have only to make
contact."
