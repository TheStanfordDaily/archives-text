# COP Creates Unique Award
## 
### LIZ EGAN Staff writer 
Citing "inherent failings" in the Dean's Service
Award, the ASSU Council of Presidents has
decided to create a new award for students it
believes will never be honored by the University.
The award, to be called the "Fred," will be "more
of a disservice award, in contrast to the service
awards," said COP member Mike Collins.
The Fred can do things that the Dean's Service
Award will simply never do," said COP member
Leslie Leland. "I mean, think about it. The dean
doesn't exactly run around awarding people who
stick thorns in the side of the administration. That's
our job," she said.
"We want to recognize individuals who have done
good things, really worthy of mention, who are
never going to get a red star from the current pro
gram," she said.
Collins expressed dismay that the University has
pressed charges against students arrested during
anti-apartheid sit-ins, stating that the protesters'
actions are of "real value" to the University.
The dean's award will probably not be presented
to those who support a student-run coffee house be
cause "the administration killed (the proposal) with
a big stick through the heart," Collins said.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons, who is re
sponsible for giving the University award to about

20 students each year, said the COP award is un
necessary.
According to Lyons, his award is given to a vari
ety of students and can include those who have
been involved in protests. Noting that nominations
for the award can be made by anyone, he suggested
that it would be more constructive for the COP to
"begin nominating, rather than sitting in the wings
during a process that is quite open."
The name of the COP service award comes from
a desire by COP members to rename the ASSU
"Fred" in a version of the ASSU constitution to be
rewritten next quarter.
"It's much more homey," said Collins. He and the
other members of the COP belong to the Chapar
ral's Hammer and Coffin Society.
Collins said the first winner will be announced at
the beginning of next month, and will be featured in
the Dec. 4 ASSU News, which is printed in The
Daily.
"It's going to be more than just a piece of paper
and a photo in Old Union," said ASSU News Editor
Josh Weinstein, referring to the dean's award.
"Every winner — and that's going to be one every
two months — is going to be taken to dinner at
Chuck E. Cheese restaurant. All they can eat.
Something the dean isn't going to do."
Asked to speculate on possible recipients, Col
lins said only that "it sure ain't gonna be Jim
Lyons."
