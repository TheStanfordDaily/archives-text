# Study Conducted on Fault

A Stanford professor's plan to drill a five kilometer
(3.1 mile) hole near the San Andreas fault may help to
forecast earthquakes and explain why some of the
fault's characteristics are inconsistent with the theory
of plate tectonics.
One goal of Geophysics Prof. Mark Zoback's project
is to "discover the magnitude of the stresses at depth,"
according to Wayne Thatcher, a member of the team
conducting the experiment.
Thatcher emphasized the importance of understand
ing the stresses in the fault. "From the standpoint of
earthquake prediction you must first understand me
chanically what's going on there," said Thatcher, who is
chief of tectonophysics with the U.S. Geological Sur
vey.
Thatcher was optimistic about the project, which will
begin next summer and is scheduled to be completed
by early 1987.
"Most (of us) are looking for definitive answers.
Everybody really envisions an enormous impact on the
field," he said.
Currently, experts in the field believe that there
must be a great deal of stress in fault lines. Thus, labo
ratory experiments use a high-stress model. If scien
tists evaluating evidence from the new drill hole deter
mine that the fault is actually under low pressure, then
previous models must be redesigned to include the
new data, said Thatcher.

But scientists are not completely sure what results
will come out of the project.
Although stress measurements at the surface indi
cate high stresses, low temperature levels found at the
surface of faults contradict that evidence, Thatcher
said.
If there are high stresses in the fault plane, then the
friction caused by the two sides rubbing together
should generate higher temperatures.
One explanation for the discrepancy is that the fault
is under a great deal of stress, but the heat, caused by
friction, is removed through convection by subsurface
waters. This theory seems unlikely, however, since
the heat cannot be found in subsurface hot springs.
Another theory is based on the idea that there is ac
tually little stress at the fault plane. In this explanation,
called the "weak-fault hypothesis," fluid pressure is
very high, restricting the build-up of stress.
By drilling to a depth of five kilometers, scientists
expect to finally determine whether or not the stress
level is as high as has been theorized.
The drill hole will also enable scientists to conduct
experiments to determine if heat is being carried off by
subsurface water.
The program is being sponsored jointly by the U.S.
Geological Survey and a consortium of about a dozen
universities known as Deep Observation and Sampling
of Earths Continental Crust (DOSECC), Thatcher
said.
The National Science Foundation and the U.S.
Geological Survey are paying for the $2.5 million proj
ect.
