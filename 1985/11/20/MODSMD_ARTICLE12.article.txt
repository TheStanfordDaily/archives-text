## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper A 						Vote To Divest 
### 
We support full divestment by the University of all
stock held in companies doing business in South
Africa.
But not in the hope that divestment will cause sig
nificant change in South Africa. Divestment would
be the most effective means for the Stanford com
munity to affect U.S. foreign policy.
Ever since 800 people gathered in White Plaza on
April 25, apartheid and the appropriate University
response have become the subjects of intense
debate on campus. After seven months of discus
sion, it has become clear that the issue is not apart
heid: Everyone agrees it is bad. Rather, the ques
tion is: What should Stanford do about it?
University President Donald Kennedy argues
against divestment. In a letter to the community this
spring, he said divestment would not be effective
because it would not lead directly to better condi
tions for blacks in South Africa.
Agreed. Selling Stanford's holdings would prob
ably not make conditions significantly better or
worse for blacks in that country.
In May's apartheid forum in the Quad, former
Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher said
Stanford would do best to leave the formulation of
foreign policy to the federal government. Our duty
as citizens, said the man who is now president of the
Board of Trustees, is simply to make the govern
ment aware of our opinions.
Again, we agree, but how do we make known our
abhorrence of apartheid and our desire for a
stronger U.S. stance?
Both men ignore reality when they tell us to lobby
Washington. Washington is 2,800 miles away. Let
ters to Congress from each member of the Univer
sity community would have a negligible impact. And
very few of us, with the exception of Kennedy,

Christopher and some members of the Board of
Trustees, have political power in Washington.
Stanford, on the other hand, is one of the most
well-known institutions of higher learning on the
West Coast. Other institutions watch and respect
the University — consider Stanford's top-ranking in
a recent survey of college presidents. Divestment
would be the strongest way for this institution to
state that it despises apartheid and advocates a
tough, aggressive policy by the U.S. government.
The cost of using this influence would not neces
sarily be high. Investment returns must be mea
sured against the risks. Economic issues such as
transaction costs, liquidity and diversification can all
be accommodated if divestment occurs over a
reasonable period of time (most institutions have set
two-year time frames for divestment). Columbia
University claims to have divested for economic
reasons.
I
Nor would academic freedom at the University be
adversely affected if Stanford divested. Some have
argued that a university must remain apolitical to
ensure the independence of its academic activities.
But not divesting represents a political stance too,
and, if a majority of the University community
desires it, we see no harm in divesting.
Senators and congressmen have said that this
spring's campus protests were influential in putting
the apartheid issue in front of U.S. policy makers.
Let's go one step further and add the voice of Stan
ford to those of Columbia University, Mount
Holyoke College, the University of Minnesota and
the University of Wisconsin. Let us tell President
Reagan and the U.S. Congress exactly where this
educational institution stands on the issue of South
Africa.
