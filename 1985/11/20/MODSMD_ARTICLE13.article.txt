## Why Recruit S. Africans? 
### 
University President Donald Kennedy, Dean of Ad
missions Jean Fetter and David Romo of Stanford Out
of South Africa are all, I would respectfully suggest,
missing the point in the case of James Alborough, the
Stanford freshman from South Africa (The Daily, Nov.
14).
The Black Student Union (BSU) is not objecting to
Alborough having scholarship aid to attend Stanford. I
personally wouldn't object to his running on the track

VIEWPOINT

team, if, after he was admitted, someone found he had
the ability. BSU member David Troutt stated the real
issue when he suggested that "the University actively
recruits South Africans." Is this true? If so, who does
it?
Athletic Director Andy Geiger and track Coach
Brooks Johnson are reported as saying they see
"no reason to discriminate" against this young man.
Failing to recruit him would not have been discrimina
tion against him. Recruiting him — and embarrassing
him by doing so — was discriminating in favor of him.
There are plenty of fine African track prospects in
Kenya, Ethiopia and Tanganyika, as well as in Ghana

and Nigeria. Were any of them given offers? Was an
"equal opportunity recruitment program" for Africans
in force? If not, why not?
It is unlikely that Alborough heard of Stanford and
wrote spontaneously, saying he had track talents to of
fer. If he was "actively recruited," we have a right to
know. And if he was, we have a right to ask for a policy
of not recruiting white athletes from South Africa at
this point in history without putting a black, Asian or
colored on the team at the same time — or offering a
non-athletic scholarship to a non-white in compensa
tion.
But why recruit from South Africa at all? This is not
a question of academic freedom or of individual
freedom, as the people cited above insist. It is a
serious political question. To deny that is to put on
blinders. It would not be unreasonable to withdraw the
young man's athletic scholarship and to give him an
equal amount of aid in some kind of financial package
like other freshmen get. To fly in the face of an interna
tional boycott of South African athletes — professional
and amateur — is a deliberate political decision.
