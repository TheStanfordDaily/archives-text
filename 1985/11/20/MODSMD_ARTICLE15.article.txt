## No More Res Ed Games 
### 
It had never entered my mind for a moment that
there was a "hidden agenda" to make Stanford an
alcohol-free campus until I read the comments made by
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Norm Robinson
(The Daily, Nov. 13). Now I fear that the hidden
agenda is not one to make Stanford alcohol-free, but
rather an agenda to heighten the arbitrary powers of
University officials, all in the name of protecting the
student body from itself.
According to the article, Robinson has declared that
there has been a change in the University's policy
toward drunk driving on campus. Yet, he will not

VIEWPOINT

specify what this change consists of, saying that it is
"awfully hard to draw any vast generalizations" on the
subject of students driving drunk on campus.
I am calling on Residential Education to make more
than some vast generaliziations. I would like to see
some actual rules — rules that are as clear to the stu
dent body as the Honor Code. Write them down so I
don't have to play these stupid Rfes Ed games, in the
great tradition of "Write the Party Flier" and "Hide the
Quarters." These games have no commonly perceived
set of rules, players who'd rather just be left alone and
referees who show up only to make "change of policy
signals."
Now, just in time for the Christmas rush, the elves
at Res Ed have come up with what can only be labeled
"Drunken Driving Darts." I quote Robinson: "The
closer one gets to the physical core of campus, where
there are a lot more buildings and where there are a lot
of people ... I think the changes are greater" of being
punished under the Fundamental Standard.
No wonder vast generalizations are so difficult for
Robinson to come up with. Let me sugest an aid to im
plementing this statement as actual policy. If all 8,000-
odd acres of the University were painted with con
centric circles, we could have easily recognizable dan
ger zones, sort of a "bull's eye — you're busted" ap
proach. This way, a weaving driver coming out of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center would know for
sure that he ran a much lower risk of being brought up

on charges of violating the Fundamental Standard than
a drunken student close to the bull's eye at the
"physical core of campus." Any point disputes could be
settled by our local Stanford police equipped with first
down markers.
Yes, the new Res Ed policy has made me more
aware, but not of the dangers of alcohol abuse. I
learned of those dangers in seventh, eighth and ninth
grades through drug education classes. I doubt that
even the most sheltered of Stanford students does not
realize that alcohol is a drug, and it can be abused. I am
more aware now of a wholly different type of abuse:
the abuse by Res Ed of my right to live under a consis
tent rule of law, rather than suffer the arbitrary punish
ment brought about because some administration staff
member wants to "signal a change" in policy.
My education at Stanford is at this time the most im
portant pursuit in my life, and I do not intend to have it
jeopardized because I didn't know the rules of the
game. I do not drink and drive because I realize that it
would not only endanger my life, but the lives of
others. I also know the penalties which the law holds for
those who are convicted of drunk driving. These
penalties are common knowledge to most students at
Stanford, unlike the nebulous "policies" of Res Ed.
If this is a dry campus, Norm, tell me so, and I'll go
somewhere else and partake. If being accused but not
convicted of drunken driving is sufficient to get a "one
quarter, stayed suspension" placed on my record as
was the case with Joseph Anderson, then tell me ahead
of time so that I can put as much distance as possible
between my revelry and your randomness. Looking at
"the specific circumstances in any given case" just isn't
good enough when we're talking about the cost of a
Stanford education and the stigma of being suspended
due to a violation of the Fundamental Standard.
Until you come up with some real rules, I'll just
hedge my bets and do my drinking as far away as possi
ble from"the physical core of campus." Given the
power you seem to possess over the fate of Stanford
students, this can only be perceived by you as one lo
cation — the office of the associate dean of Student Af
fairs for Res Ed.
