# Breaking Down the Barriers to Happiness

"Sacrifices," Dad said. "You've got to be
prepared to make some sacrifices." It was the
end of summer, and I was about to enter my
senior year. I had taken a week off from work to
go home, and it was family night.
"So what are you majoring in anyway?" my
aunt asked.
"As long as it's practical, it doesn't matter,"
my mother chimed in.
"And what will you be doing after graduation?"

The questions were right through me.
I was answering them, giving these relatives the
best answers I could, but still the questions were
passing right through me. They only asked for
titles, not for what was truly me.
Later that night, I had a terrible nightmare.
Everyone who had ever asked me what I was
going to do after graduation was building a huge
wall of bricks. Then* the wall came alive and
chased me. I ran, but it kept getting closer and
closer until I woke.
After having a dream like that, I was afraid to
go back to sleep, so I stayed up to stare at my
fish tank. I don't usually stare at my fish much,
but one of the fish looked sort of like Dustin
Hoffman, and I had lots to think about.
We rarely think that someone merely asking a
question has much effect on us. When someone
asks me, "What are you going to do after gradua
tion?" he or she is not criticizing my choice. He
or she is merely wondering what the choice is.
But these questions about my future have a
strong influence on the way I perceive the world,

my relationship to the world and my relationship
to my time spent here at college.
When I'm asked what kind of job my major will
lead to, I begin to think that there is a direct con
nection between what I learn in school and what
work I do afterward. I spend countless hours
wondering if what I'm doing now will help me
later.
The problem is that this connection isn't really
there. Most jobs have some sort of training. If I
get a job it will be because of the type of person I
am — not because of my major. Stanford is not a
vocational school. But all these questions asked
of me make me think it's supposed to be. This
iai&e opinion teaches me how our society values
titles — and almost makes me value them, too.
The fish that looked like Dustin Hoffman was
staring back at me as if he were listening.
Nobody seems to want to know anything
about my future except where I'll be working. It
makes me think I will be no more than my job.
But I know better, at least I think I do. I mean,
won't I be doing a lot of things outside my job
that contribute to my identity and my happiness?
How come nobody asks about those things?

'Being Po' is the best term
for what I'll be doing a
year from now.

I'd never seen a fish with a nose before, let
alone a big one.
These questions about life after graduation are
supposed to be valuable because they make me
think about who I am, but I disagree. They make
me evaluate myself against some predetermined
role in society, not against my own highest self.
The questions limit my possibilities. I want to
make my own path. "Being Po" is the best term

for what I'll be doing a year from now.
The fish had taken to chasing after another
fish, a striped one that looked much older.
I feel like graduation has been built up as a
huge wall, beyond which I can only see at the
main gate. The problem is that everyone has
come to the main gate to see into their future,
and this situation creates a very impersonal, un
creative mainstream. All our ideals and dreams
and our true personalities are out on those side
roads that lead right into the wall. In order to see
past this wall, we must turn off the side road,
forget our dreams, enter the mainstream and
pass through the main gate.
A friend once told me about the time she was
in Berlin. The city is in East Germany, but one
part of it, West Berlin, is not considered East
Germany because Winston Churchill, Joseph
Stalin and Franklin Delano Roosevelt divided it
up that way. So in the middle of East Germany is
West Berlin, with a huge wall constructed around
it to separate the areas.
My friend went up in a tall tower in West Ber
lin and looked out over the land. She said it was
very strange because all the roads went right up
to the wall and continued past. The wall was
placed right on top. It seemed out of place, al
most imaginary, as if the roads going right under
it meant it was all a hoax.
Looking over the wall is exactly what I'd like
to do. I'd like to flap my arms really hard and fly
up in the air to see that all the side roads and
ideals can continue right on past. Then when
graduation comes, I could walk right through
their myth.
I finally went back to sleep, and I dreamt that
the fish that looked like Dustin Hoffman was lec
turing me about how fish must graduate from the
beautiful sea, and choose a fish tank in which to
live out their lives. He told me that plastic fish
tanks were the best.

Later that night, I had a terrible nightmare.
Everyone who had ever asked me what I was
going to do after graduation was building a huge
wall of bricks. Then* the wall came alive and
chased me. I ran, but it kept getting closer and
closer until I woke.
After having a dream like that, I was afraid to
go back to sleep, so I stayed up to stare at my
fish tank. I don't usually stare at my fish much,
but one of the fish looked sort of like Dustin
Hoffman, and I had lots to think about.
We rarely think that someone merely asking a
question has much effect on us. When someone
asks me, "What are you going to do after gradua
tion?" he or she is not criticizing my choice. He
or she is merely wondering what the choice is.
But these questions about my future have a
strong influence on the way I perceive the world,

my relationship to the world and my relationship
to my time spent here at college.
When I'm asked what kind of job my major will
lead to, I begin to think that there is a direct con
nection between what I learn in school and what
work I do afterward. I spend countless hours
wondering if what I'm doing now will help me
later.
The problem is that this connection isn't really
there. Most jobs have some sort of training. If I
get a job it will be because of the type of person I
am — not because of my major. Stanford is not a
vocational school. But all these questions asked
of me make me think it's supposed to be. This
iai&e opinion teaches me how our society values
titles — and almost makes me value them, too.
The fish that looked like Dustin Hoffman was
staring back at me as if he were listening.
Nobody seems to want to know anything
about my future except where I'll be working. It
makes me think I will be no more than my job.
But I know better, at least I think I do. I mean,
won't I be doing a lot of things outside my job
that contribute to my identity and my happiness?
How come nobody asks about those things?

'Being Po' is the best term
for what I'll be doing a
year from now.

I'd never seen a fish with a nose before, let
alone a big one.
These questions about life after graduation are
supposed to be valuable because they make me
think about who I am, but I disagree. They make
me evaluate myself against some predetermined
role in society, not against my own highest self.
The questions limit my possibilities. I want to
make my own path. "Being Po" is the best term

for what I'll be doing a year from now.
The fish had taken to chasing after another
fish, a striped one that looked much older.
I feel like graduation has been built up as a
huge wall, beyond which I can only see at the
main gate. The problem is that everyone has
come to the main gate to see into their future,
and this situation creates a very impersonal, un
creative mainstream. All our ideals and dreams
and our true personalities are out on those side
roads that lead right into the wall. In order to see
past this wall, we must turn off the side road,
forget our dreams, enter the mainstream and
pass through the main gate.
A friend once told me about the time she was
in Berlin. The city is in East Germany, but one
part of it, West Berlin, is not considered East
Germany because Winston Churchill, Joseph
Stalin and Franklin Delano Roosevelt divided it
up that way. So in the middle of East Germany is
West Berlin, with a huge wall constructed around
it to separate the areas.
My friend went up in a tall tower in West Ber
lin and looked out over the land. She said it was
very strange because all the roads went right up
to the wall and continued past. The wall was
placed right on top. It seemed out of place, al
most imaginary, as if the roads going right under
it meant it was all a hoax.
Looking over the wall is exactly what I'd like
to do. I'd like to flap my arms really hard and fly
up in the air to see that all the side roads and
ideals can continue right on past. Then when
graduation comes, I could walk right through
their myth.
I finally went back to sleep, and I dreamt that
the fish that looked like Dustin Hoffman was lec
turing me about how fish must graduate from the
beautiful sea, and choose a fish tank in which to
live out their lives. He told me that plastic fish
tanks were the best.

"Sacrifices," Dad said. "You've got to be
prepared to make some sacrifices." It was the
end of summer, and I was about to enter my
senior year. I had taken a week off from work to
go home, and it was family night.
"So what are you majoring in anyway?" my
aunt asked.
"As long as it's practical, it doesn't matter,"
my mother chimed in.
"And what will you be doing after graduation?"

The questions were right through me.
I was answering them, giving these relatives the
best answers I could, but still the questions were
passing right through me. They only asked for
titles, not for what was truly me.
