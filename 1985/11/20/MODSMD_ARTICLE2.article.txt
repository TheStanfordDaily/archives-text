# Students See Soviet Summit News
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Staff writer 
A group of Stanford scientists stepped behind
the Iron Curtain yesterday morning as they mon
itored the Soviet Union's nightly news broad
cast, just in time to catch the pre-summit
coverage.
Using a 16-foot radar dish, electrical engineer
ing graduate student Stuart Neubarth inter
cepted a signal from a Soviet communications
satellite orbiting past the Earth's poles. U.S.
satellites orbit above the equator and can "see"
the entire Northern Hemisphere, making it pos
sible to intercept Soviet broadcasts.
Neubarth, physics graduate student Alex
Markevich and Louis Lerman, a graduate stu
dent in physical sciences, will watch the Soviet
news coverage until the summit ends tomorrow.
They also plan to monitor Radio Moscow, the
government-approved version of the news that
is officially released to other nations.
"This is a tremendous opportunity for Stan

ford to understand the Soviet Union," Neubarth
said. " I hey (the Soviets) present a different
picture to their own people from the one they
present to the outside world."
Neubarth developed the prototype receiver in
the spring of 1983. He began work on the
satellite-receiving system when he was a fresh
man here in 1978. The broadcast reception yes
terday morning was "excellent," he said.
Although the broadcast took place before the
Reagan-Gorbachev summit began, "we were
able to make a number of interesting observa
tions," Neubarth said.
Markevich translated much of the broadcast,
which showed footage of Gorbachev's address to
the staff of the Soviet Embassy in Geneva.
"We are strong . . . socialist, economic and
spiritual. ... I doubt there's another people that
tries so hard and cares so much about the
country," Gorbachev told the crowd outside the
embassy.
"We don't have to be prisoners of a group that
likes the cold war, the hot war, unannounced
war . . . prisoners of the interest of peoples," he

said.
"Our only approach is open, honest," Gorba
chev said. "The strength of our politics lies in
that we invited everyone to join working to
gether . . . and in essence this lies in the inter
est of everyone."
Any mention of the Strategic Defense Initia
tive (SDI) in the broadcast was "very
downplayed," Markevich said. The Soviets
"don't deal in specifics at all. One of the euph
emisms they use for 'Star Wars' is 'extending the
arms race to other spheres.' "
The broadcast also contained about a minute
of footage of Reagan and Gorbachev meeting and
talking, without audio from either leader or a
voice-over from the Soviet news commentator.
"The only time we've seen that silence was
during Chernenko's death," Lerman said. "It
may be to underline the solemnity of the situa
tion. "
Several other groups in America are monitor
ing the Soviet broadcasts, including one at Co
lumbia University in New York, according to
Lerman.
