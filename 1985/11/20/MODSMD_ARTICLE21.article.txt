## 'Father' of Linear Programs at Stanford 
### DERRICK LEE 
Linear programming has a father
at Stanford.
George Dantzig, professor of
operations research and computer
science here, is recognized as a
pioneer of linear programming, a
mathematical technique born out
of an urgent need to tackle complex
large-scale problems of planning, al
location and optimization in decision
making.
The idea of linear pogramming
arose out of Dantzig's experience
as chief of combat analysis for the
U. S. Air Force during World War 11.
According to Dantzig, critical deci
sions in planning combat missions,
training and logistics were often
made based on intuitive experience
and an ad-hoc set of ground rules.
Because of the scope and com
plexity of the military effort, usually
inconsistent and often bad plans
were made, resulting in a war effort
that was far from efficient. It was
this that motivated Dantzig to look
for a more scientific approach to
decision making.
After the war, he laid the theo
retical foundations of linear pro
gramming and developed a solution
technique called the simplex al
gorithm. In the process, he made
some of the most important contri
butions to mathematics in the 20th
century.

Today, some 38 years after his
initial work, linear programming is
an indispensable tool in the large
scale planning of government
agencies and corporations through
out the world, Dantzig explained.
He said that millions of dollars
are being saved every year as a
result of linear programming;
scarce resources are allocated
more efficiently, and the competing
demands of different interest
groups are being resolved more ef
fectively.
Before the advent of linear pro
gramming and the electronic com
puter, solving such large programs
was impossible. Today, problems
containing many thousands of
variables and constraints are
routinely solved.
For his groundwork in develop
ing the theoretical foundations of
linear programming, Dantzig was
awarded the National Medal of Sci
ence in 1975. He has received
numerous other honors and prizes,
including the John von Neumann
Theory Prize awarded by the In
stitute for Management Science and
the Operations Research Society of
America.
He is a member of the National
Academy of Sciences, a fellow of
the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences and was recently elected

to the National Academy of Engi
neering.
Dantzig described linear pro
gramming as a sophisticated mathe
matical theory of optimizing an an
swer to a problem that has been ex
pressed as a mathematical equa
tion, a linear objective function.
This function is subjected to certain
mathematical conditions, such as
linear inequality constraints, using
computers.
In modeling a problem, linear
programming requires the modeler
to state the constraints of his prob
lem as linear equalities, linear equa
tions and to express his goal expli
citly as an objection to be max
imized or minimized.
Dantzig is modest about his con
tributions to the field. "All I did was
provide a tool," he said.
But finding such a tool is no easy
task. Typically, in attempting to
solve such mathematical systems,
mathematicians visualize the prob
lem as a multi-dimensional
geometrical object. A very simple
three-dimensional problem can be
represented geometrically as a
crystal with many planar surfaces.
Any point inside or on its surface
corresponds to a feasible plan, but

not necessarily an optimal one. An
optimal plan corresponds to one of
the corners of the crystal.
Hence, developing an algorithm
for solving such a problem from
scratch was not simple. Although
Dantzig is a man who by the age of
18 had solved literally thousands of
problems in geometry, coming to
grips with the complexity of the
problem and developing an al
gorithm to handle large problems
took a long time to perfect.
Even for a modest size problem,
the multi-geometrical object that
represents such a problem can have
so many little corners that solving it
by examining all corners seems
hopelessly slow.
Nevertheless, in solving the pro
gram, the simplex algorithm
proceeds along the edges of the
crystal from corner to corner in
search of the best possible solution
but does so selectively. The result
is that in practice, the algorithm has
proved to be fast and efficient.
"One's intuition as to what is going
on in higher dimensional space is
not worth a damn," said Dantzig.
However, Dantzig's intuition has
helped him with other projects. An
outside interest has led him to to
co-author a book, "Compact City,"
with Prof. Thomas Saaty of the
University of Pennsylvania.
In the book, a typical, present-day

city is compared with that of a
multi-layered city built so that on
less than nine square miles of land,
every point in the city is close to
every other point. Time as well as
distance is conserved for there is
no longer any reason for everyone
to be on exactly the same day-night
cycle.

'The arrogance of policy makers leads
them to believe that they can grasp
economic complexity, that they can
grasp dynamic changes over time and
that they can make good decisions. . . .
It is impossible to do so without the use
of models.'

"Our general idea was to deter
mine for each main activity within a
city its input requirement and
various outputs — both good and
bad," Dantzig said.
"We then tried to find a combina
tion of these activities that was in
some way optimal, but also was in
balance with available resources

and satisfied certain standards," he
explained.
Dantzig's current focus,
however, deals with applying the
techniques of linear programming
to solve some of the most pressing
problems in economic allocation of
scarce resources such as energy.
Since 1975, he has been actively

developing the PILOT Macro-
Economic Model used to analyze
energy supply, energy usage, al
ternative energy sources, foreign
competition and structural changes
in the economy in light of changes
due to the modernization, innova
tion and the use of computers and
robotics. It attempts to provide a

coherent strategy to manage such
changes some 40 years into the
future.
Dantzig said that he feels sad that
policy makers have been slow to
take advantage of this immensely
powerful analytic tool to aid their
decision making.
"Instead of training themselves
to use the planning tools which are
available, they continue to kid
themselves that they can find quick
answers to very complex deci
sions," he said.
Dantzig also noted that "the ar
rogance of policy makers leads
them to believe that they can grasp
economic complexity, that they can
grasp dynamic changes over time
and that they can make good deci
sions." He added that "it is
impossible to do so without the use
of models."
That the policy makers' self
confidence is unjustified is evident
from the number of bad decisions
made, he said. "What is missing is a
clear-cut discipline and a structure
for decision making in organiza
tions."
Using mathematical models may
not provide the user with ready
made solutions, but it does help in
making better decisions by syste
matically considering all alterna
tives and their trade-offs.
"Politicians are correct when

they say models are not going to
give them the full answers. They
use it as an excuse to ignore the
models.
"What we see in its place is a hap
hazard ad-hoc way of planning. It is
a process without a memory. Next
time around you have the same
crises all over again," he said.
On reflecting upon how models
may help in improving the standard
of living, he noted that "in this
country, we have the physical
capacity to have everybody well
off. There is no excuse for any
poverty whatsoever.
"So basically, if we have the
wherewithal to do it, then in a
sense we are not getting our act to
gether. The reason we are not get
ting our act together is that we are
dealing with a very complex eco
nomy with everything interacting
with everything else," he said.
These problems are not un
solvable — "the approach that can
handle this complexity is through
the use of models, the use of com
puters, and by a process of coor
dination between special interest
groups," he said.
According to Dantzig, the future
could be promising. "The models
clearly indicate that we have the re
sources to eliminate poverty and at
the same time develop the nation
on many fronts."

Dantzig also noted that "the ar

them to believe that they can grasp
economic complexity, that they can
grasp dynamic changes over time
and that they can make good deci

impossible to do so without the use

made, he said. "What is missing is a

Linear programming has a father
at Stanford.
George Dantzig, professor of
operations research and computer
science here, is recognized as a
pioneer of linear programming, a
mathematical technique born out
of an urgent need to tackle complex
large-scale problems of planning, al
location and optimization in decision
making.
The idea of linear pogramming
arose out of Dantzig's experience
as chief of combat analysis for the
U. S. Air Force during World War 11.
According to Dantzig, critical deci
sions in planning combat missions,
training and logistics were often
made based on intuitive experience
and an ad-hoc set of ground rules.
Because of the scope and com
plexity of the military effort, usually
inconsistent and often bad plans
were made, resulting in a war effort
that was far from efficient. It was
this that motivated Dantzig to look
for a more scientific approach to
decision making.
After the war, he laid the theo
retical foundations of linear pro
gramming and developed a solution
technique called the simplex al
gorithm. In the process, he made
some of the most important contri
butions to mathematics in the 20th
century.

Today, some 38 years after his
initial work, linear programming is
an indispensable tool in the large
scale planning of government
agencies and corporations through
out the world, Dantzig explained.
He said that millions of dollars
are being saved every year as a
result of linear programming;
scarce resources are allocated
more efficiently, and the competing
demands of different interest
groups are being resolved more ef
fectively.
Before the advent of linear pro
gramming and the electronic com
puter, solving such large programs
was impossible. Today, problems
containing many thousands of
variables and constraints are
routinely solved.
For his groundwork in develop
ing the theoretical foundations of
linear programming, Dantzig was
awarded the National Medal of Sci
ence in 1975. He has received
numerous other honors and prizes,
including the John von Neumann
Theory Prize awarded by the In
stitute for Management Science and
the Operations Research Society of
America.
He is a member of the National
Academy of Sciences, a fellow of
the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences and was recently elected

to the National Academy of Engi
neering.
Dantzig described linear pro
gramming as a sophisticated mathe
matical theory of optimizing an an
swer to a problem that has been ex
pressed as a mathematical equa
tion, a linear objective function.
This function is subjected to certain
mathematical conditions, such as
linear inequality constraints, using
computers.
In modeling a problem, linear
programming requires the modeler
to state the constraints of his prob
lem as linear equalities, linear equa
tions and to express his goal expli
citly as an objection to be max
imized or minimized.
Dantzig is modest about his con
tributions to the field. "All I did was
provide a tool," he said.
But finding such a tool is no easy
task. Typically, in attempting to
solve such mathematical systems,
mathematicians visualize the prob
lem as a multi-dimensional
geometrical object. A very simple
three-dimensional problem can be
represented geometrically as a
crystal with many planar surfaces.
Any point inside or on its surface
corresponds to a feasible plan, but

not necessarily an optimal one. An
optimal plan corresponds to one of
the corners of the crystal.
Hence, developing an algorithm
for solving such a problem from
scratch was not simple. Although
Dantzig is a man who by the age of
18 had solved literally thousands of
problems in geometry, coming to
grips with the complexity of the
problem and developing an al
gorithm to handle large problems
took a long time to perfect.
Even for a modest size problem,
the multi-geometrical object that
represents such a problem can have
so many little corners that solving it
by examining all corners seems
hopelessly slow.
Nevertheless, in solving the pro
gram, the simplex algorithm
proceeds along the edges of the
crystal from corner to corner in
search of the best possible solution
but does so selectively. The result
is that in practice, the algorithm has
proved to be fast and efficient.
"One's intuition as to what is going
on in higher dimensional space is
not worth a damn," said Dantzig.
However, Dantzig's intuition has
helped him with other projects. An
outside interest has led him to to
co-author a book, "Compact City,"
with Prof. Thomas Saaty of the
University of Pennsylvania.
In the book, a typical, present-day

city is compared with that of a
multi-layered city built so that on
less than nine square miles of land,
every point in the city is close to
every other point. Time as well as
distance is conserved for there is
no longer any reason for everyone
to be on exactly the same day-night
cycle.

'The arrogance of policy makers leads
them to believe that they can grasp
economic complexity, that they can
grasp dynamic changes over time and
that they can make good decisions. . . .
It is impossible to do so without the use
of models.'

"Our general idea was to deter
mine for each main activity within a
city its input requirement and
various outputs — both good and
bad," Dantzig said.
"We then tried to find a combina
tion of these activities that was in
some way optimal, but also was in
balance with available resources

and satisfied certain standards," he
explained.
Dantzig's current focus,
however, deals with applying the
techniques of linear programming
to solve some of the most pressing
problems in economic allocation of
scarce resources such as energy.
Since 1975, he has been actively

developing the PILOT Macro-
Economic Model used to analyze
energy supply, energy usage, al
ternative energy sources, foreign
competition and structural changes
in the economy in light of changes
due to the modernization, innova
tion and the use of computers and
robotics. It attempts to provide a

coherent strategy to manage such
changes some 40 years into the
future.
Dantzig said that he feels sad that
policy makers have been slow to
take advantage of this immensely
powerful analytic tool to aid their
decision making.
"Instead of training themselves
to use the planning tools which are
available, they continue to kid
themselves that they can find quick
answers to very complex deci
sions," he said.
Dantzig also noted that "the ar
rogance of policy makers leads
them to believe that they can grasp
economic complexity, that they can
grasp dynamic changes over time
and that they can make good deci

with Prof. Thomas Saaty of the
University of Pennsylvania.
In the book, a typical, present-day

city is compared with that of a
multi-layered city built so that on
less than nine square miles of land,
every point in the city is close to
every other point. Time as well as
distance is conserved for there is
no longer any reason for everyone
to be on exactly the same day-night
cycle.

'The arrogance of policy makers leads
them to believe that they can grasp
economic complexity, that they can
grasp dynamic changes over time and
that they can make good decisions. . . .
It is impossible to do so without the use
of models.'

"Our general idea was to deter
mine for each main activity within a
city its input requirement and
various outputs — both good and
bad," Dantzig said.
"We then tried to find a combina
tion of these activities that was in
some way optimal, but also was in
balance with available resources

and satisfied certain standards," he
explained.
Dantzig's current focus,
however, deals with applying the
techniques of linear programming
to solve some of the most pressing
problems in economic allocation of
scarce resources such as energy.
Since 1975, he has been actively

developing the PILOT Macro-
Economic Model used to analyze
energy supply, energy usage, al
ternative energy sources, foreign
competition and structural changes
in the economy in light of changes
due to the modernization, innova
tion and the use of computers and
robotics. It attempts to provide a

coherent strategy to manage such
changes some 40 years into the
future.
Dantzig said that he feels sad that
policy makers have been slow to
take advantage of this immensely
powerful analytic tool to aid their
decision making.
"Instead of training themselves
to use the planning tools which are
available, they continue to kid
themselves that they can find quick
answers to very complex deci
sions," he said.
Dantzig also noted that "the ar
rogance of policy makers leads
them to believe that they can grasp
economic complexity, that they can
grasp dynamic changes over time
and that they can make good deci
sions." He added that "it is
impossible to do so without the use
of models."
That the policy makers' self
confidence is unjustified is evident
from the number of bad decisions
made, he said. "What is missing is a
clear-cut discipline and a structure
for decision making in organiza
tions."
Using mathematical models may
not provide the user with ready
made solutions, but it does help in
making better decisions by syste
matically considering all alterna
tives and their trade-offs.
"Politicians are correct when

they say models are not going to
give them the full answers. They
use it as an excuse to ignore the
models.
"What we see in its place is a hap
hazard ad-hoc way of planning. It is
a process without a memory. Next
time around you have the same
crises all over again," he said.
On reflecting upon how models
may help in improving the standard
of living, he noted that "in this
country, we have the physical
capacity to have everybody well
off. There is no excuse for any
poverty whatsoever.
"So basically, if we have the
wherewithal to do it, then in a
sense we are not getting our act to
gether. The reason we are not get
ting our act together is that we are
dealing with a very complex eco
nomy with everything interacting
with everything else," he said.
These problems are not un
solvable — "the approach that can
handle this complexity is through
the use of models, the use of com
puters, and by a process of coor
dination between special interest
groups," he said.
According to Dantzig, the future
could be promising. "The models
clearly indicate that we have the re
sources to eliminate poverty and at
the same time develop the nation
on many fronts."
