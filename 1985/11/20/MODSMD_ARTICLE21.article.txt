## 'Father' of Linear Programs at Stanford 
### DERRICK LEE 
Linear programming has a father
at Stanford.
George Dantzig, professor of
operations research and computer
science here, is recognized as a
pioneer of linear programming, a
mathematical technique born out
of an urgent need to tackle complex
large-scale problems of planning, al
location and optimization in decision
making.
The idea of linear pogramming
arose out of Dantzig's experience
as chief of combat analysis for the
U. S. Air Force during World War 11.
According to Dantzig, critical deci
sions in planning combat missions,
training and logistics were often
made based on intuitive experience
and an ad-hoc set of ground rules.
Because of the scope and com
plexity of the military effort, usually
inconsistent and often bad plans
were made, resulting in a war effort
that was far from efficient. It was
this that motivated Dantzig to look
for a more scientific approach to
decision making.
After the war, he laid the theo
retical foundations of linear pro
gramming and developed a solution
technique called the simplex al
gorithm. In the process, he made
some of the most important contri
butions to mathematics in the 20th
century.

Today, some 38 years after his
initial work, linear programming is
an indispensable tool in the large
scale planning of government
agencies and corporations through
out the world, Dantzig explained.
He said that millions of dollars
are being saved every year as a
result of linear programming;
scarce resources are allocated
more efficiently, and the competing
demands of different interest
groups are being resolved more ef
fectively.
Before the advent of linear pro
gramming and the electronic com
puter, solving such large programs
was impossible. Today, problems
containing many thousands of
variables and constraints are
routinely solved.
For his groundwork in develop
ing the theoretical foundations of
linear programming, Dantzig was
awarded the National Medal of Sci
ence in 1975. He has received
numerous other honors and prizes,
including the John von Neumann
Theory Prize awarded by the In
stitute for Management Science and
the Operations Research Society of
America.
He is a member of the National
Academy of Sciences, a fellow of
the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences and was recently elected
