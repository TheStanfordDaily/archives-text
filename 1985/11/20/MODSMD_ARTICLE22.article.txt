## 'Hawks' Exposes Old Power Politics 
### LISA LYNCH 
"A Cast Of Hawks"
Milton Gould
Copley Books, 1985
It seems like a historical romance, but it's not. "A
Cast Of Hawks," a book recently written by Milton
Gould, a New York attorney, has enough sex, power
and corruption in its 300 or so glossy pages to compete
for air time with "Dynasty." But according to Gould,
who wrote "Hawks" to satisfy a 50-year curiosity
about a case he researched while at Cornell Law
School, every lurid detail of the story is true.
In an interview at the Stanford Law School, Gould
said that "Hawks" was a "rowdy, true tale of greed,
corruption, murder, violence and power politics set in
early-day San Francisco." The book is based on events
leading up to the law case of In vs. Neagle, an 1890
case which decided that a federal officer acting in the
line of duty could not be prosecuted by state law.
"Hawks" reads like a gross parody of a legal system
where "justice" takes a back seat to the legal circus.
The characters in Gould's history are simultaneously
good guys and bad guys, prosecutors and the
prosecuted.
Gould described his incredulity when he first came
across the case as a Cornell law student. "I said to
myself, this can't be true, these kinds of things just
don't happen. A U.S. Marshall kills a former U.S. judge
in his attempts to protect another U.S. judge from a
felonious assault with a Bowie knife. I mean, we're not
talking about the sidewalks of Marseilles here," Gould
said, "we're talking about San Francisco."
Gould said that after his initial exposure to In vs.
Neagle, he wanted to "dig into the case, find out more
about the history," but was not able to do so to his

satisfaction until recently.
When writing the book, Gould found that the case
had a shadier background than he'd first imagined. "It
turned out that this former judge — Terry was his
name — came to California from Texas during the gold
rush years, back when all you needed to be a judge was
to be able to read and write."
However, in researching Terry's history the attor
ney discovered that this "judge" had been involved in
rigged duels, vigilante politics and even the "wrong"
side of the war in Mexico. "He was a real loser — he
just needed to join up with a cause to have it go under,"
Gould said.

'Hawks' reads like a gross
parody of the legal system
where 'justice' takes a back
seat to the legal circus.

One cause Terry championed that had at least tem
porary success was a sensational "divorce" trial be
tween prostitute Sara Althea Hill and Sen. William
Sharon of Nevada. Hill, a "well-upholstered blonde in
her middle 305," was for a time Sharon's mistress.
After Sharon discarded her, Hill and her madame,
Mammy Pleasent, concocted a fake marriage certifi
cate and sued for divorce on the basis of Sharon's
"adulterous" relationships with other shady ladies.
Terry was called in as "special counsel and protector
to the plaintiff," and the case was won on the state
level. Hill re-established her virtue so completely that
Terry decided to marry her. But when Justice Field, a
federal judge, again brought the marriage into ques

tion, the result was legal chaos. After bouts of Western
gunslinging and rowdiness, Terry made one final claim
for his wife's honor. He punched Field out in the dining
car of a train, and was "shot cold" by Field's protector,
Deputy Marshall David Neagle.
"This," Gould said, "is the stuff of fiction."
Neagle and Field were arrested by state authorities;
Field was released immediately and Neagle's trial
resulted in the landmark In vs. Neagle decision.
Gould has had plenty of experience in dealing with
the mechanations of the rich and powerful. He has
represented clients such as Aristotle Onassis, Sun
Myung Moon, and Abraham Beame, a former New
York mayor. Recently, he represented Gen. Ariel
Sharon in the Israeli minister's libel case against Time
magazine.
Though Gould insists things have changed since the
times of In vs. Neagle, he seems to recognize a
cowboys-and-Indians style of law and order, where
right and wrong is not as important as the glory of the
fight.
When asked about the moral issues surrounding the
Sharon case, Gould said, "It's not my business to
judge, or even to know, whether a client is right or
wrong. Sure, sometimes it gives you a moral boost to
know you're on the side of virtue and justice, but then
again. . . . My business is to see that everyone gets a
fair shake according to the law of the land."
Gould then quoted a line from Samuel Johnson which
is also quoted in his book: "A lawyer has no business
with the justice or injustice of the cause he undertakes.
The justice or injustice of the cause is to be decided by
the judge."
Though his legal career has kept him more than oc
cupied, Gould said that a stroke of luck 10 years ago
started him on his way to finally writing "Hawks."
"I had this case in my head for about 40 years," he

explained. "Then about 10 years ago, while I was at
Bohemian Grove cavorting with the local nabobs, I ran
into John Howard, who's over at the Berkeley library. I
told him about my interest in In vs. Neagle, but added I
didn't know how the hell to research the thing.
"He said to me, Milt, I think I got all the books you
need.' I spent a couple of weeks over at Berkeley, and
then I started writing the book," Gould said.
