"Skevington's Daughter"
Oliver Reynolds
Faber & Faber, 1985
Dylan Thomas — everybody's best known Welsh poet — once wrote:
"Too many of the poets in Wales spend too much time talking about the po
sition of the poet in Wales. There is only one position for a poet, and that
is upright."
Dylan Thomas himself was hardly "upright" in all the senses of that
word. His poems were surreal and jerked slantwise from image to image.
Not to mention his customary posture: leaning diagonally on a bar.
A new slanted poet has appeared in Wales. His name is Oliver Reynolds.
He is 28 years old, and his first book, "Skevington's Daughter," has just
been published by Faber & Faber. His poems are obsessively about the
position of the poet in Wales.
What is this thing called "Wales?" Officially it is a principality within the
United Kingdom. In practice it is a province of England, and has been so
ever since Edward the Black Prince conquered it 600 years ago. However,
the Welsh retain a vague, nostalgic feeling of separateness. They cherish a
romantic image of themselves as Celtic bards wandering through a misty
mountainscape and/or pugnacious practitioners of rugby football. Yet you
can stroll through any town in Wales and come across almost no indication
that you aren't in a corner of England.
Almost, but not quite. The Welsh do retain a separate language — and
for a poet language is the root of everything. More exactly, the Welsh
have two languages. There is a dialect of Gaelic, spoken as a mother
tongue only by a few thousand people, but studied by most Welsh school
children; and there is the Welsh version of English. Like most Welsh poets,
Reynolds speaks the latter and stakes an ancestral claim to the former.

"Skevington's Daughter" is divided into three sections: lexicography,
photography and the Welsh language with its wordplay, magic and nostal
gia. The first poem in the first section is called "Victoriana," and it's as
good an illustration as any of his technique. Ostensibly, it's a narrative
about a meeting between the first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary
and an insane American lexicographer. In fact, the story line wanders

bards wandering through a misty moun
tainscape and/or pugnacious practition
ers of rugby football.

crazily. For instance, the history of the editor's beard is described at
length: "Its fringes were to ebb slightly/Later on, in 1904/ Following his
brave ascent of/Le Pic de la Croix de Belledonne./He said afterwards his
beard froze/ Into one huge blue icicle./A plank was set under his chin/And
the ice smashed out by hammer."
Reynolds himself worked in a mental hospital, and he has a yen for
deranged language. In fact, a recent survey of a statistical sample of
British poets revealed thai most of them had resided at some stage of their

career in a psychiatric ward — so Reynolds belongs to the mainstream
tradition of British eccentricity. . ...
The second section of the book, dealing with photography, is r; her gliD.
Each poem is centered on a pun or a simile: a still ; a ssolve ,
"undeveloped . . . negatives"; a shutter "falling like an axe. Re >»olds in
geniously compares someone cropping a photograph to the vnge o
Death: "The reaper eyes us, gauging the distance./He is putti > oti the
hard choice/Between Instamatic and scythe." H
The best poem in this section is the title one. "Skevington si lughter
is the nickname for an instrument of torture which the ei ivmous
Skevington designed to grab and crush a victim within its ii. frame.
Reynolds posed and photographed his girlfriend beside the (1 e. The
flash from his camera caught and froze her, just like (so Reynol ; meta
phor insists) the torture the machine itself could do to her.
This playful sadism is also inflicted on us readers, in a Nabokov an way.
We begin reading a narrative poem with a comfy story-line, but it t irns into
a madcap mishmash of anecdotes and irrelevant remarks. I"or instance,
Reynolds teaches us in the course of his verse that the rodent called a
"jerboa . . . is also known as Jaculus jaculusand that ill and ich in
Welsh resemble ixl and ir in Xhosa."
There is a whole ode dedicated to the sound ich, which is also the fourth
letter in the Welsh alphabet. "Fetishists relish/Bits of the body . . ./Why
not go for the heard/And dote on vocables?" asks the ode.
That excerpt could serve as a type of summary for the whole book.
Reynolds lusts for bizarre sounds and kinky suggestions. What he lacks is
poetic "polish." His verse rhythms have a nursery rhyme clumpishness.
And you won't find compassion or psychological realism; one of his poems
is seif-mockingly entitled:"Faced by the Real Thing, the Critic Demurs."
Nevertheless, what he does, he does very well. And it is refreshing — to
anyone who has browsed on bookstore shelves through groaning loads of
generic verse — to come across a poet who is simply different.

"Skevington's Daughter"
Oliver Reynolds
Faber & Faber, 1985
Dylan Thomas — everybody's best known Welsh poet — once wrote:
"Too many of the poets in Wales spend too much time talking about the po
sition of the poet in Wales. There is only one position for a poet, and that
is upright."
Dylan Thomas himself was hardly "upright" in all the senses of that
word. His poems were surreal and jerked slantwise from image to image.
Not to mention his customary posture: leaning diagonally on a bar.
A new slanted poet has appeared in Wales. His name is Oliver Reynolds.
He is 28 years old, and his first book, "Skevington's Daughter," has just
been published by Faber & Faber. His poems are obsessively about the
position of the poet in Wales.
What is this thing called "Wales?" Officially it is a principality within the
United Kingdom. In practice it is a province of England, and has been so
ever since Edward the Black Prince conquered it 600 years ago. However,
the Welsh retain a vague, nostalgic feeling of separateness. They cherish a
romantic image of themselves as Celtic bards wandering through a misty
mountainscape and/or pugnacious practitioners of rugby football. Yet you
can stroll through any town in Wales and come across almost no indication
that you aren't in a corner of England.
Almost, but not quite. The Welsh do retain a separate language — and
for a poet language is the root of everything. More exactly, the Welsh
have two languages. There is a dialect of Gaelic, spoken as a mother
tongue only by a few thousand people, but studied by most Welsh school
children; and there is the Welsh version of English. Like most Welsh poets,
Reynolds speaks the latter and stakes an ancestral claim to the former.

"Skevington's Daughter" is divided into three sections: lexicography,
photography and the Welsh language with its wordplay, magic and nostal
gia. The first poem in the first section is called "Victoriana," and it's as
good an illustration as any of his technique. Ostensibly, it's a narrative
about a meeting between the first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary
and an insane American lexicographer. In fact, the story line wanders
