## Spikers Go On a Bear Hunt at Home Rowdy crowd cheers on Card In a three-set Maples blowout 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volleyball
team commenced Big Game week
with a resounding 15-0, 15-5, 15-11
victory over UC-Berkeley before a
rambunctious crowd last night at
Maples Pavilion.
The victory increased the No. 1
Cardinal's overall record to 23-2
and completed the second con
secutive season in which Stanford
has been undefeated at Maples.
The Bears dropped to 22-19 on the
season.
The story of the match was
simply that Cal chose the wrong
night to play the Cardinal.
The Golden Bears were victims
of a hungry Cardinal team which
lost for only the second time this
season Saturday at the Wendy's
Classic.
Another factor was the Axe
Committee's promotion which gave
choice seats for Saturday's Big
Game to the group that showed the
most spirit. The result was a sea of
red and white that unnerved the Cal
players in the first two games.
Most importantly, though, the
Cardinal players had an emotional
edge generated by a pre-game cer
emony which honored seniors
Terry Bryson and Kim Oden in
their last home game at Stanford.
The crowd gave each player a
rousing standing ovation.
"I couldn't help but smile," Oden
said. "It was great to experience
that."
"That's kind of a first for me,"
Bryson said of the standing ovation.
"Because of the position I play, I'm
usually more of the supportive per
son. It was wonderful."
The Cardinal responded to the
pre-game ceremony with a near
flawless first game. Stanford's hit

ters feasted on sophomore Wendi
Rush's outstanding sets, pounding
spikes with authority past the Cal
block.
And the Stanford block over
whelmed the much smaller Cal hit
ters, stuffing potential kills.
The Bears' coach, Marlene
Piper, attempted to stop the Card
inal momentum by calling timeouts
at 0-5 and 0-10 in the first game.
But the timeouts only whipped the
Stanford crowd into more of a
frenzy.
A Barbra Fontana off-speed hit
closed out the game at 15-0. Nei
ther Bryson nor Oden could re
member another instance during
their four years at Stanford when
the Cardinal had shut out the op
ponent.
"The nice thing is that it (the
shutout) shows that we didn't make
any execution errors," Bryson said.
The Cardinal dominance spilled
over into game two as Stanford
quickly took a 6-0 lead. The combi
nation of Rush-to-Oden continued
to destroy the Cal block, and when
Oden was not hitting, sophomore
Theresa Smith was firing kills from
her outside hitting position. Both
Oden and Smith had six kills in the
second game.
The Cardinal streak of con
secutive points finally ended when,
ironically, Oden mis-hit a Cal serve
to make the score 6-1.
But the Bears' surge was halted
before it could make a dent in the
Cardinal lead. Stanford won five
straight points to up the lead to 11-
1.
Cal did win four more points in
the game, but three of them came
on Cardinal errors. When Rush
landed a shot in front of the Bears'
back row, Stanford had captured
game two, 15-5.


In her final game at Maples yesterday, senior Kim Oden helped
pace the women's volleyball team to a three-set thrashing of

Matt Bateman/Daily
Cal. In a pre-game ceremony, Oden and fellow senior Terry
Bryson were given standing ovations by the vocal crowd.
The third game saw the Bears fi
nally challenge the top-ranked
Cardinal. Trailing 10-5, Cal scored
six consecutive points to lead 11-
10.
A Smith kill evened the game,
however, and Stanford never
looked back. Sophomore Nancy
Reno slammed an errant Cal pass to
give the Cardinal the game at 15-
11.
Oden indicated that the Bears did
not play up to their potential in last
night's match. "They are a good
team, but they didn't play that well
tonight," she said. "Usually they
dig more balls."
In her last regularly scheduled
match at Maples, Oden disap
pointed nobody. Knowing that this
would be Oden's last chance to
sparkle before the local fans, Rush
seemed to set the three-time All-
American more frequently, and
Oden responded with a variety of
booming kills.
Defensively, Oden led the Card
inal block and also came up with
several spectacular digs. "I love
playing back row," she said. "I love
to read the hitters. Tonight I just
seemed to be in the right place."
Both Bryson and Oden praised
the crowd support last night and
throughout the season. "The crowd
definitely helps us," Bryson said.
"It's been just tremendous what
has happened this year."

doesn't even get to share the same locker room as the red team. As Close says of the gray
players, "You've got to really love the game."

match at Maples, Oden disap
pointed nobody. Knowing that this
would be Oden's last chance to
sparkle before the local fans, Rush
seemed to set the three-time All-
American more frequently, and
Oden responded with a variety of
booming kills.
Defensively, Oden led the Card
inal block and also came up with
several spectacular digs. "I love
playing back row," she said. "I love
to read the hitters. Tonight I just
seemed to be in the right place."
Both Bryson and Oden praised
the crowd support last night and
throughout the season. "The crowd
definitely helps us," Bryson said.
"It's been just tremendous what
has happened this year."

While the red squad gets its orders from Coach Tom Davis (right), the grays have their own
coach, Gary Close (near left with sweats). Despite their hard work on the court, the gray team
doesn't even get to share the same locker room as the red team. As Close says of the gray
players, "You've got to really love the game."

Junior Brooke Hahner helped lead the Cardinal back from its
only defeat Saturday, at the hands of UCLA in the Wendy's
Classic. Hahner and the other Stanford hitters overwhelmed
Cal throughout the match last night.
The Stanford women's volleyball
team commenced Big Game week
with a resounding 15-0, 15-5, 15-11
victory over UC-Berkeley before a
rambunctious crowd last night at
Maples Pavilion.
The victory increased the No. 1
Cardinal's overall record to 23-2
and completed the second con
secutive season in which Stanford
has been undefeated at Maples.
The Bears dropped to 22-19 on the
season.
The story of the match was
simply that Cal chose the wrong
night to play the Cardinal.
The Golden Bears were victims
of a hungry Cardinal team which
lost for only the second time this
season Saturday at the Wendy's
Classic.
Another factor was the Axe
Committee's promotion which gave
choice seats for Saturday's Big
Game to the group that showed the
most spirit. The result was a sea of
red and white that unnerved the Cal
players in the first two games.
Most importantly, though, the
Cardinal players had an emotional
edge generated by a pre-game cer
emony which honored seniors
Terry Bryson and Kim Oden in
their last home game at Stanford.
The crowd gave each player a
rousing standing ovation.
"I couldn't help but smile," Oden
said. "It was great to experience
that."
"That's kind of a first for me,"
Bryson said of the standing ovation.
"Because of the position I play, I'm
usually more of the supportive per
son. It was wonderful."
The Cardinal responded to the
pre-game ceremony with a near
flawless first game. Stanford's hit

ters feasted on sophomore Wendi
Rush's outstanding sets, pounding
spikes with authority past the Cal
block.
And the Stanford block over
whelmed the much smaller Cal hit
ters, stuffing potential kills.
The Bears' coach, Marlene
Piper, attempted to stop the Card
inal momentum by calling timeouts
at 0-5 and 0-10 in the first game.
But the timeouts only whipped the
Stanford crowd into more of a
frenzy.
A Barbra Fontana off-speed hit
closed out the game at 15-0. Nei
ther Bryson nor Oden could re
member another instance during
their four years at Stanford when
the Cardinal had shut out the op
ponent.
"The nice thing is that it (the
shutout) shows that we didn't make
any execution errors," Bryson said.
The Cardinal dominance spilled
over into game two as Stanford
quickly took a 6-0 lead. The combi
nation of Rush-to-Oden continued
to destroy the Cal block, and when
Oden was not hitting, sophomore
Theresa Smith was firing kills from
her outside hitting position. Both
Oden and Smith had six kills in the
second game.
The Cardinal streak of con
secutive points finally ended when,
ironically, Oden mis-hit a Cal serve
to make the score 6-1.
But the Bears' surge was halted
before it could make a dent in the
Cardinal lead. Stanford won five
straight points to up the lead to 11-
1.
Cal did win four more points in
the game, but three of them came
on Cardinal errors. When Rush
landed a shot in front of the Bears'
back row, Stanford had captured
game two, 15-5.


In her final game at Maples yesterday, senior Kim Oden helped
pace the women's volleyball team to a three-set thrashing of

Matt Bateman/Daily
Cal. In a pre-game ceremony, Oden and fellow senior Terry
Bryson were given standing ovations by the vocal crowd.
The third game saw the Bears fi
nally challenge the top-ranked
Cardinal. Trailing 10-5, Cal scored
six consecutive points to lead 11-
10.
A Smith kill evened the game,
however, and Stanford never
looked back. Sophomore Nancy
Reno slammed an errant Cal pass to
give the Cardinal the game at 15-
11.
Oden indicated that the Bears did
not play up to their potential in last
night's match. "They are a good
team, but they didn't play that well
tonight," she said. "Usually they
dig more balls."
In her last regularly scheduled
match at Maples, Oden disap
pointed nobody. Knowing that this
would be Oden's last chance to
sparkle before the local fans, Rush
seemed to set the three-time All-
American more frequently, and
