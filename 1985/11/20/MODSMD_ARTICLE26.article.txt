## Synchro Swimmers Sink Cal 
### 
With a bright sun that belied the chill in the air
Sunday at DeGuerre Pool, the Stanford
synchronized swim team claimed victory for the
seventh year in a row in its preseason dual meet
against UC-Berkeley.
The squad was paced by freshman Dee Cohen
and sophomore Leslie Tackett, who both turned in
fine performances to take first and second
respectively in the senior figures competition.
In synchronized swimming, each swimmer com
petes in one of three different divisions, senior,
junior and novice. A panel of five judges awards each
competitor a compulsory figure score on a scale of
one to 10.
As expected, senior Jeri Lane won the junior fig

ures event. Lane was last year's junior division
champion at the Synchronized Swimming Intercol
legiate Nationals in Indianapolis.
In novice figures, Stanford swept the first five
places, with fifth-year senior Jane Abraham leading
the way. Abraham, in her first year of synchronized
competition, is an ex-varsity swimmer who was on
swim Coach George Haines' squad for four years.
The meet proved to be a test of each swimmer's
ability to hold up in the cold on the sunny but brisk
morning.
With the regular season not set to begin until Feb.
15 — a rematch with the Golden Bears at Cal —
Stanford will spend the next few months
choreographing their routines to music.
