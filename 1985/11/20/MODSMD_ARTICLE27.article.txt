# Penn State Stays No. 1
## 
### 
Pittsburgh's record isn't worthy
of even one vote in The Associated
Press Poll. But the Panthers hold a
key to a possible national champion
ship showdown in the Orange Bowl
— and perhaps a bowl appearance
of their own.
The 5-4-1 Panthers haven't been
close to a berth in the Top Twenty
since the opening weeks of the
1984 college football season. They
get a close-up look at No. 1 Satur
day when they entertain Penn
State, with the Nittany Lions
hoping to remain atop the rankings
for a third consecutive week.
If Penn State, 10-0, can do it, and
if No. 2 Nebraska can beat fifth
ranked Oklahoma at Norman,
Okla., the Lions and Cornhuskers
are virtually certain to meet in

Miami with the national champion
ship at stake.
For Pitt, the incentive to win —
besides beating its cross-state rival
— is a possible bowl berth of its
own. Athletic Director Edward
Bozik said he has "talked to a
couple of bowl people and we're not
out of the picture yet," an apparent
reference to the Liberty and Aloha
bowls.
Penn State avoided the fate of
lowa and Florida, each of which as
cended to No. 1 in the poll only to
lose and tumble from the top. The
Nittany Lions, after pounding Notre
Dame 36-6 on Saturday in what
was supposed to have been a com
petitive game, earned 46 of 60 first-
place votes yesterday and remained
first in the rankings with 1,180 of a
possible 1,200 points from a
nationwide panel of sports writers
and sportscasters.
Nebraska mauled Kansas 56-6
and received 12 first-place votes
and 1,122 points. lowa edged
Purdue 27-24 and rose two places
to third with 1,020 points, followed
by Miami, which went from sixth to
fourth with 1,011 points.
The two remaining first-place
ballots went to Oklahoma, which
moved from seventh to fifth with
992 points following a 31-0 shellack
ing of Colorado. Michigan, with 923
points, also moved up two places,
to sixth, following a 48-7 trouncing
of Minnesota.
Rounding out the Top Ten were

Oklahoma State, up from 10th to
seventh following a 21-19 victory
over Missouri; UCLA, up five rungs
to eighth after blanking Oregon
State 41-0; Florida, up two spots to
ninth by virtue of its 15-13 victory
over Kentucky, and Auburn, up to
10th from 14th following its 24-10
triumph over Georgia.
All of that moving up was due in
part to losses by Ohio State and Air
Force.
Ohio State was beaten 12-7 by
Wisconsin and Air Force lost 28-21
to Brigham Young, and each fell out
of the Top Ten — the Buckeyes to
12th and the Falcons to 13th.
Arkansas, a 10-6 loser to Texas
A&M, plunged from ninth place to
18th.
In the Second Ten were Brigham
Young, Ohio State, Air Force,
Florida State, Baylor, Tennessee,
LSU, Arkansas, Texas A&M and
Georgia.
