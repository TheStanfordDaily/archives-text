# Color the Cardinal Red and Gray
## Basketball's gray team has tough job 
### AIMEE BERG 
For seven non-scholarship members of the
Stanford men's basketball team, coordinating
academics and basketball is a gray matter.
In the classroom, they face the pressures
every student has with schoolwork. But on the
court, "These guys play a vital role in preparing
the red (varsity) team," Associate Head Goach
Bruce Pearl said.
First and foremost, the gray team is there to
simulate the upcoming opponent. "The better
they do this in practice, the better the red does
in games. This has been proven year after year,"
said former scholarship player Charles Hunt,
now an assistant coach with the team.
"They try to eliminate surprises as much as
possible. They help the red coaches see where
they need to make adjustments," Hunt added.
In addition to those players recovering from
injuries and other scholarship players not in the
starting lineup, the gray team provides more
people to practice with. "It saves us physically,"
basketball Coach Tom Davis said.
Just as the number of varsity players is lim
ited, so is the glory and recognition of the men in
gray.
"Their results don't always show," Neil
Johnson, a two-year gray team MVP, said.
Johnson was one of the few gray team players to
earn a basketball scholarship.
Hunt pointed out at least one way the gray
teamers can get recognition. "If they can get the
coach yelling at the red, they know they've done

their job well. There's satisfaction in knowing
that," he said.
Personal gratification is not the gray team
players' only reward. "I also got a pair of shoes I
think I get to keep," senior Tim Allen said. It
seems that tough souls are just what the grays
need.
'It's not something for everybody," Davis
said.

'You're not really
supposed to like the red
guys. You play your hard
est to try to screw them
up — make them make
mistakes.'

"It takes a special individual to stick it out.
You've got to really love the game," gray team
Coach Gary Close said.
"We look for kids that work hard . . . who
aren't afraid to dive for loose balls. They need to
like playing defense but also like being physical
and aggressive," he added.

Like every challenge, being on the gray has its
frustrating moments. Despite coaches' efforts to
suit up a few grays for every varsity game, first
year player Allen still laments that "the hardest
thing is sitting out."
Worse still, frequent rotations make "sitting
out at practice ... a little mentally frustrating,"
he said.
So why do they stick with it? Mark Sylvain, a
junior back for his second year with the gray, is a
dedicated player who is there to "help out the
team, keep in shape and maybe get to play
(varsity) sometime."
Others de-emphasize the importance of
making varsity. "It's a possibility, but not a
driving force right now. That was part of trying
out," freshman Kevin Anderson said.
Former gray Joe Watson said, "It does give
you something to shoot for — pardon the ex
pression. "
According to Close, others persevere because
they "want to find out how good they can
become."
No matter how different the goals of the indi
vidual players may be, "I'd say we're unified in
spirit," sophomore Chris Bonang, another
rookie, said of his gray team.
When it comes to camaraderie, the red and
gray sometimes clash.
"You're not really supposed to like the red
guys. You play your hardest to try to screw
them up — make them make mistakes," Watson

good enough, he may earn a scholarship like former gray mem
