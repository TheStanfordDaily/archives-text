# Johnson Lawsuit Rejected by Court
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer With wire reports 
A federal appeals court yester
day rejected a lawsuit filed by Stan
ford staff member Clifford Johnson
that sought to prohibit computer
controlled launching of nuclear
weapons by the United States.
Johnson's suit contended that
using such a system would violate
the constitutional authority of
Congress and the president to
declare war.
A three-member panel of the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said
the issue of constitutionality cannot
be addressed because Johnson
"has not alleged that launch-on
warning-capability (LOWC) is even
technologically feasible, much less
that its use has been adopted as of
ficial policy or implemented." •
I he LOWC, a computer system
that would automatically launch nu
clear missiles if electronic sensors
indicate that the nation is under at
tack, is void of human prudence and
capable of error, according to
Johnson.
The rejected suit claimed that
such a defense program was imp
lied in the deployment of Pershing
II missiles in Europe.
The Department of Defense,
however, has denied that LOWC is
official policy, refusing to say
whether the technology is being
developed.
Johnson, a computer expert at
Information Technology Services,

said he does not consider the deci
sion a defeat.
"It isn't really a setback," he
said, citing the fact that the court's
ruling does not state that launch
on-warning is constitutional.
"It was a square decision on
their part. It was an honest deci
sion, and I respect it," Johnson
said.
He added that it may be possible
to prove that launch-on-warning
currently is in use. "It is my belief
that it does exist," he said, noting
that missiles can be fired in
response to a computer warning.
Johnson originally filed the suit
against Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger in 1984, but a
district court judge ruled that the
suit raised military and political is
sues outside the court's jurisdic
tion.
Johnson said he did not think
that this most recent decision was
based on a desire to avoid political
issues.
But he suggested that the poten
tial for danger inherent in LOWC
might have warranted the judges
taking a stand on the con
stitutionality issue.
The appeals court said the suit
was a request for an "advisory
opinion," and that the duty of the
court is to rule on concrete legal
disputes concerning actual or
threatened damage to the plaintiff.
Johnson said it is too soon to tell
what his next move will be. His op
tions include: appealing the deci-
sion, refiling the suit with a new
paragraph addressing the allega
tions mentioned in the decision or
dropping the suit, he said.
Johnson described his lawsuit as
a first initiative, but did not say if
he would be the one to take the
next step.
He said he is fearful that if he
simply drops the matter, people
will then believe that the threat of a
war being declared by computers
does not exist.
