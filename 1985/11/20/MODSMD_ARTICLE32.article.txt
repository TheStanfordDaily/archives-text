policemen were wounded as police used shotguns, tear gas and rub
ber bullets.
The headquarters said four of the deaths occurred in Leandra,

black squatters. Police said officers killed one man near
Queenstown, a farming center in eastern Cape Province, where the
burned body of a black man also was found.
According to police, 11 blacks have been killed near Queenstown
since Sunday, in one of the highest tolls from rioting in recent weeks.
Police reports attributed all but one of the deaths to police fire.
Italy Issues Warrant for Abbas
GENOA, Italy — International arrest warrants have been issued
for PLO official Mohammed Abbas and several of his top aides,
charging them with murder and kidnapping in the Achille Lauro
hijacking, a prosecutor said on yesterday.
The United States has accused Abbas, head of a faction of Yasser
Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization, of masterminding the
Oct. 7-9 Mediterranean ordeal in which an American passenger was
killed and thrown overboard.
Abbas, whose present whereabouts were not known, previously
denied he was involved in the hijacking.
At an impromptu news conference, Deputy Prosecutor Luigi Carli
also told reporters that one of the four accused hijackers had ad
mitted killing Leon Klinghoffer of New York City.
Carli announced that arrest warrants containing charges of murder
and kidnapping have been issued for 16 suspects in the hijacking.
When reporters asked Carli whether Abbas could be considered
the mastermind of the hijacking, he replied, "Yes, you could say
that."
Waite Sees Hope for Hostages
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Terry Waite, the archbishop of Canter
bury's special envoy, said yesterday the time is ripe "for a major
move forward" in negotiations with kidnappers to free their Ameri
can captives.
Waite returned here yesterday from London, where he met with
U.S. government officials, and said he is now "hopeful" that progress
can be made. He met with the kidnappers last week.
"I have very important things to say to them," he said yesterday.
"I'm not prepared to say publicly what I need to say to them in
private. I believe that last time was a good step forward. I think now
it's possible to take another step forward."
Waite, who is a veteran hostage negotiator, said: "I hope those
who have responsibility (for the hostages) will see what an op
portune time this is now for a major move forward — not just for lim
ited causes, but for greater causes." He did not elaborate.
Asked whether his London talks covered the kidnappers' demand
for the release of 17 of their comrades convicted in Kuwait for bomb
ing the U.S. and French embassies in 1983, he said: "What was said
to me will be a matter for private discussion."
Jackson Meets With Gorbachev
GENEVA — American civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, here to
deliver peace petitions to the summiteers, was granted an unex
pected face-to-face meeting yesterday with Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
In a 40-minute discussion during the lunch break from his talks
with President Reagan, the seemingly irrepressible Gorbachev
treated Jackson and some 50 members of various peace groups to a
spirited defense of Soviet policy, inviting Americans who doubt his
country's record on human rights to visit the Soviet Union and see
for themselves.
"We are for open doors," Gorbachev said at one point as Jackson
pressed him on human-rights abuses. 'We welcome an opportunity
for everyone, including American citizens, to get acquainted with the
Soviet Union and even get married, why not?"
"We're down to business," Gorbachev said when Jackson asked
how the talks with Reagan were going.
Rescue Hopes Fade in Colombia
BOGOTA, Colombia — An army of 4,000 rescuers searched yes
terday for more survivors of last Wednesday's volcanic eruption that
killed more than 22,500 people in central Colombia, but they held out
little hope of finding anyone alive.
The government put the registered death toll at 22,540 with an
other 3,300 classified as missing. An estimated 4,000 people were
injured and 20,000 made homeless when the Nevadel Del Ruis vol
cano erupted.
Most of the bodies remain buried under mud that poured down the
sides of the volcano after the eruption had melted its snowcap.
Soldiers tightened up security yesterday in the devastated 100-
square-mile area, including the inundated town of Armero, after
numerous reports of looting.
Doctors expressed concern over the spread of typhus and yellow
fever among survivors, especially children.
Rescue teams began burning bodies of the dead Monday to contain
the spread of disease.
Court Delays Aquino Verdict
MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine Supreme Court ordered
yesterday a delay of at least five days in a reading of the verdict in
the Aquino assassination trial, which had been scheduled for today.
The court issued a restraining order in order to continue consider
ation of a petition for a mistrial, alleging that the lower court that
heard the case was influenced by President Ferdinand Marcos.
Shortly after the delay was ordered, Chief Justice Felix Makasiar
retired from the bench, as required by law at reaching age 70. He
was succeeded, on presidential appointment, by Ramon Aquino, 68,
a law school classmate of Marcos.
The new chief justice is no relation to Benigno Aquino Jr., the op
position leader who was assassinated in 1983. On trial for his murder
are the armed forces chief, Gen. Fabian Ver, 24 other military men
and a civilian.
Meanwhile, a parliamentary committee approved Feb. 7 As the
date for early presidential elections called by Marcos.

Jackson Meets With Gorbachev
GENEVA — American civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, here to
deliver peace petitions to the summiteers, was granted an unex
pected face-to-face meeting yesterday with Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
In a 40-minute discussion during the lunch break from his talks
with President Reagan, the seemingly irrepressible Gorbachev
treated Jackson and some 50 members of various peace groups to a
spirited defense of Soviet policy, inviting Americans who doubt his
country's record on human rights to visit the Soviet Union and see
for themselves.
"We are for open doors," Gorbachev said at one point as Jackson
pressed him on human-rights abuses. 'We welcome an opportunity
for everyone, including American citizens, to get acquainted with the
Soviet Union and even get married, why not?"
"We're down to business," Gorbachev said when Jackson asked
how the talks with Reagan were going.
Rescue Hopes Fade in Colombia
BOGOTA, Colombia — An army of 4,000 rescuers searched yes
terday for more survivors of last Wednesday's volcanic eruption that
killed more than 22,500 people in central Colombia, but they held out
little hope of finding anyone alive.
The government put the registered death toll at 22,540 with an
other 3,300 classified as missing. An estimated 4,000 people were
injured and 20,000 made homeless when the Nevadel Del Ruis vol
cano erupted.
Most of the bodies remain buried under mud that poured down the
sides of the volcano after the eruption had melted its snowcap.
Soldiers tightened up security yesterday in the devastated 100-
square-mile area, including the inundated town of Armero, after
numerous reports of looting.
Doctors expressed concern over the spread of typhus and yellow
fever among survivors, especially children.
Rescue teams began burning bodies of the dead Monday to contain
the spread of disease.

Waite Sees Hope for Hostages
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Terry Waite, the archbishop of Canter
bury's special envoy, said yesterday the time is ripe "for a major
move forward" in negotiations with kidnappers to free their Ameri
can captives.
Waite returned here yesterday from London, where he met with
U.S. government officials, and said he is now "hopeful" that progress
can be made. He met with the kidnappers last week.
"I have very important things to say to them," he said yesterday.
"I'm not prepared to say publicly what I need to say to them in
private. I believe that last time was a good step forward. I think now
it's possible to take another step forward."
Waite, who is a veteran hostage negotiator, said: "I hope those
who have responsibility (for the hostages) will see what an op
portune time this is now for a major move forward — not just for lim
ited causes, but for greater causes." He did not elaborate.
Asked whether his London talks covered the kidnappers' demand
for the release of 17 of their comrades convicted in Kuwait for bomb
ing the U.S. and French embassies in 1983, he said: "What was said
to me will be a matter for private discussion."
