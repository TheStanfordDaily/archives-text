## Gorbachev Brings New 'Star Wars' Offer 
### 
GENEVA — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev, after meeting President Reagan for the
first time in the opening session of the summit,
indicated yesterday that he has brought new
"Star Wars" proposals to the bargaining table and
will raise the possibility of an early resumption of
U.S.-Soviet arms control negotiations.
Although both sides agreed to a news blackout
until the conclusion of the two-day summit, U.S.
and Soviet spokesmen described the atmos
phere as "good" throughout almost four hours of
first-day meetings, including nearly two hours of
one-on-one talks initiated by Reagan.
Under a cold gray sky laced with occasional
hints of snow, the leaders of the world's two su
perpowers met in the manicured splendor of a
19th-century mansion known as the Fleur
d'Eau, whose surrounding stone walls had been
decorated with barbed concertina wire.

Detachments of Swiss soldiers in camouflage
battle dress and police officers wearing leather
coats patrolled the surrounding woods as Reagan
and Gorbachev first chatted before a crackling
fire in the mansion's library, then summoned
their aides for more formal discussions.
Almost nothing emerged about the sub
stantive details of the two leaders' discussions,
and a Soviet spokesman said after the morning
session, "At this date, we are still not anywhere
near the signing of an agreement."
Gorbachev made it clear that he had still not
given up his fundamental opposition to Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative, the space-based
defense research program commonly called
"Star Wars."
"These arms are more dangerous than ever
. . . and we may all wind up being hostages of
these weapons," he was quoted as saying at one
point yesterday.

Still, at least at the level of personal
diplomacy, the external signs were widely
viewed as positive.
Reagan told reporters that he and Gorbachev
exchanged cordial greetings and said he believed
that they "both share the same goals." But the
president refused to discuss the substance of
their discussions.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said
that the Reagan team would strictly abide by the
agreement that, until the summit ends later
today, neither side would disclose any details of
the summit sessions except for the names of the
participants and the length of the discussions.
With Administration officials adhering carefully
to the blackout, the limited comments of Soviet
spokesmen and remarks by Gorbachev himself
provided most of the information available yes
terday.
