# Israeli Fighters Down Two Syrian Jets

### 
JERUSALEM — Israeli pilots
flying U.S.-made fighters on what
was described as a "routine recon
naissance mission" over Lebanon's
Bekaa Valley yesterday shot down
two Soviet-built Syrian MiG-23s in
the first such incident since the ini
tial days of the Lebanon War in
1982, the Israeli military an
nounced.
Sources here described it as "bad
timing" that the clash between the
two Middle East rivals coincided
with the opening in Geneva of a
summit meeting between their
respective superpower backers —
the United States and the Soviet
Union.

Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres congratulated the Israeli air
men but deferred judgment on the
long-term significance of the clash.
"One should not speak of trends on
the basis of one incident," he told
an Israel radio interviewer while on
a visit to the Negev Desert.
According to the official an
nouncement released here early
yesterday afternoon, the Syrian
planes attempted to intercept the
Israeli patrol. Military sources
added that the Israelis fired air-to
air missiles when the Syrian planes
closed beyond an unspecified safety
range.
The two Syrian MiGs fell several

miles inside Syrian territory, ac
cording to the official military ac
count. Air Force Gen. Amos
Lapidot confirmed in an Israel radio
interview that the Israeli planes
pursued the Syrian planes into
Syrian airspace, then shot them
down.
A Syrian military communique
released in Damascus said the Is
raeli planes were driven out of
Syrian airspace "without achieving
their aims." The Syrian announce
ment made no mention of any
planes being shot down.
Israel said all its planes returned
safely to their bases.

Lebanese military sources in
Beirut, quoting reports from the
army's Bekaa Valley command,
confirmed the basic Israeli version
of the clash.
Meanwhile, an Israeli Foreign
Ministry official warned yesterday
that Jerusalem "would oppose" any
change in a decade-old U.S. com
mitment not to negotiate with the
Palestine Liberation Organization
as long as it refuses to recognize Is
rael.
Ministry spokesman Avi Pazner
was responding to Israeli press
reports that Peres has agreed to
accept a softening in American con
ditions for talks with the PLO.
