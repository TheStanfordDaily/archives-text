Pennzoil Wins Suit
HOUSTON — A Texas jury yesterday
awarded Pennzoil Corp. $10.53 billion in dama
ges against Texaco Inc., finding that Texaco
beat out Pennzoil in their 1984 battle to buy
Getty Oil Co. by unlawfully subverting a bin
ding contract between Pennzoil and Getty.
Pennzoil, anticipating that Texaco would
respond to the verdict by undertaking a hostile
tender offer to acquire Pennzoil or that some
corporate "raider" would move to reap the
benefits of the award, said late yesterday that
it had prepared its own takeover defense. Its
board of directors adopted a preferred stock
distribution plan that a spokesman said would
"show Texaco a takeover bid won't work."
The jury's decision — reached after only
nine hours' deliberation at the conclusion of
four months of testimony that filled 24.000
transcript pages — was apparently the largest
damage award in the history of corporate
litigation. If upheld on appeal it would virtually
destroy Texaco, the nation's third-largest oil
company, which reported a net worth of $13.5
billion at the end of September.
But Texaco said it would challenge the jury's
finding through "all available legal remedies,"
and company officials told stock analysts they
were determined that Pennzoil would never
collect a cent.
Most analysts agreed yesterday that Pen
nzoil is unlikely to collect $10.53 billion —
which would be more than Texaco paid to ac
quire all of Getty Oil — but they said the jury's
award increased the likelihood that Pennzoil
would eventually receive some damages from
the much larger Texaco. Estimates ranged
from about $500 million to $2 billion.

Jurors who talked to reporters in Houston
made clear that they wanted to teach Texaco a
lesson in business ethics, despite Texaco's in
sistence that it had never done anything im
proper, and had entered its last-minute bid for
Getty only when invited to do so by Getty's
directors and investment bankers.
The jury's verdict does not affect Texaco's
$10.1 billion acquisition of Getty, which was
completed last year and was not at issue in the
trial. The issue was whether Texaco acquired
Getty by sabotaging a binding agreement be
tween Getty and Pennzoil — an agreement
already announced to the press — under which
Pennzoil would have acquired the 43 percent.
Panel for Tax Change
WASHINGTON — A House Ways and
Means panel, finally digging into the heart of
business tax issues, agreed yesterday to elimi
nate the investment tax credit and adopted a
new system of write-offs for purchases of plant
and equipment that would require business to
stretch out deductions to as long as 30 years.
The compromise, worked out among six
members of the tax-writing committee, falls
only slightly short of Ways and Means Chair
man Dan Rostenkowski's original goal and is
expected to raise a massive $160 billion from
business over the next five years.
The decisions are tentative and must be
ratified by the full committee, which was plan
ning to work well into the night on such issues
as tax shelters, business investment, research
and development (R&D), and oil industry tax
breaks.
In addition, a separate group of committee

members informally agreed to extend for three
years the research and development tax
credit, scheduled to expire at the end of this
year, but also proposed to trim it from 25 per
cent to 20 percent. The group's recommenda
tion was later adopted by the full committee.
The decision to extend the R&D credit is of
crucial importance to high-technology indus
tries concentrated in California and New Eng
land. The panel also rejected several proposals
from the committee staff that would have
diluted the value of the R&D tax credit and
agreed to extend the credit to research con
ducted at colleges and universities.
"We preserved at least 80 percent of cur
rent law for R&D," said Rep. Robert Matsui
(D-Calif.), who had been active on behalf of
high-tech industries in Silicon Valley near his
district.
Subsidy Cut Rejected
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday
narrowly defeated an Administration-backed
effort to slash dairy subsidies, reinforcing a
similar House decision to ward off deep cuts in
the multibillion-dollar program.
By a vote of 50-47, the Senate killed an
amendment by Sen. Paula Hawkins (R-Fla.)
that would have trimmed an estimated $600
million from a pending farm bill over the next
three years.
Opponents complained that the amendment
would, in the words of Sen. Patrick J. Leahy
(D-Vt.) "force farmers into bankruptcy and in
crease the strain on farm lenders" amid the
worst farm crisis in 50 years.

"We preserved at least 80 percent of cur
rent law for R&D," said Rep. Robert Matsui
(D-Calif.), who had been active on behalf of
high-tech industries in Silicon Valley near his
district.
Subsidy Cut Rejected
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday
narrowly defeated an Administration-backed
effort to slash dairy subsidies, reinforcing a
similar House decision to ward off deep cuts in
the multibillion-dollar program.
By a vote of 50-47, the Senate killed an
amendment by Sen. Paula Hawkins (R-Fla.)
that would have trimmed an estimated $600
million from a pending farm bill over the next
three years.
Opponents complained that the amendment
would, in the words of Sen. Patrick J. Leahy
(D-Vt.) "force farmers into bankruptcy and in
crease the strain on farm lenders" amid the
worst farm crisis in 50 years.
Pennzoil Wins Suit
HOUSTON — A Texas jury yesterday
awarded Pennzoil Corp. $10.53 billion in dama
ges against Texaco Inc., finding that Texaco
beat out Pennzoil in their 1984 battle to buy
Getty Oil Co. by unlawfully subverting a bin
ding contract between Pennzoil and Getty.
Pennzoil, anticipating that Texaco would
respond to the verdict by undertaking a hostile
tender offer to acquire Pennzoil or that some
corporate "raider" would move to reap the
benefits of the award, said late yesterday that
it had prepared its own takeover defense. Its
board of directors adopted a preferred stock
distribution plan that a spokesman said would
"show Texaco a takeover bid won't work."
The jury's decision — reached after only
nine hours' deliberation at the conclusion of
four months of testimony that filled 24.000
transcript pages — was apparently the largest
damage award in the history of corporate
litigation. If upheld on appeal it would virtually
destroy Texaco, the nation's third-largest oil
company, which reported a net worth of $13.5
billion at the end of September.
But Texaco said it would challenge the jury's
finding through "all available legal remedies,"
and company officials told stock analysts they
were determined that Pennzoil would never
collect a cent.
Most analysts agreed yesterday that Pen
nzoil is unlikely to collect $10.53 billion —
which would be more than Texaco paid to ac
quire all of Getty Oil — but they said the jury's
award increased the likelihood that Pennzoil
would eventually receive some damages from
the much larger Texaco. Estimates ranged
from about $500 million to $2 billion.

Jurors who talked to reporters in Houston
made clear that they wanted to teach Texaco a
lesson in business ethics, despite Texaco's in
sistence that it had never done anything im
proper, and had entered its last-minute bid for
Getty only when invited to do so by Getty's
directors and investment bankers.
The jury's verdict does not affect Texaco's
$10.1 billion acquisition of Getty, which was
completed last year and was not at issue in the
trial. The issue was whether Texaco acquired
Getty by sabotaging a binding agreement be
tween Getty and Pennzoil — an agreement
already announced to the press — under which
Pennzoil would have acquired the 43 percent.
Panel for Tax Change
WASHINGTON — A House Ways and
Means panel, finally digging into the heart of
business tax issues, agreed yesterday to elimi
nate the investment tax credit and adopted a
new system of write-offs for purchases of plant
and equipment that would require business to
stretch out deductions to as long as 30 years.
The compromise, worked out among six
members of the tax-writing committee, falls
only slightly short of Ways and Means Chair
man Dan Rostenkowski's original goal and is
expected to raise a massive $160 billion from
business over the next five years.
The decisions are tentative and must be
ratified by the full committee, which was plan
ning to work well into the night on such issues
as tax shelters, business investment, research
and development (R&D), and oil industry tax
breaks.
In addition, a separate group of committee

members informally agreed to extend for three
years the research and development tax
credit, scheduled to expire at the end of this
year, but also proposed to trim it from 25 per
cent to 20 percent. The group's recommenda
tion was later adopted by the full committee.
The decision to extend the R&D credit is of
crucial importance to high-technology indus
tries concentrated in California and New Eng
land. The panel also rejected several proposals
from the committee staff that would have
diluted the value of the R&D tax credit and
agreed to extend the credit to research con
ducted at colleges and universities.
"We preserved at least 80 percent of cur
rent law for R&D," said Rep. Robert Matsui
(D-Calif.), who had been active on behalf of
high-tech industries in Silicon Valley near his
district.
