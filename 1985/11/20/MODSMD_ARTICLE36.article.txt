FBI Probes Poisoning
LOS ANGELES — The FBI entered an in
vestigation of whether food may have been
poisoned in a 16-day-old supermarket strike as
tests confirmed that syringes found at six
stores contained commercial herbicide.
"This is a particularly cowardly and vicious
crime," said Richard Bretzing, special agent
in-charge of the FBI office here.
Meanwhile, violence flared at some stores
affected by the work stoppage and stink bombs
went off at seven Von's markets in Hermosa
Beach, Redondo Beach, Gardena, Tujunga, La
Canada and Burbank, forcing evacuation of
customers and workers.
No injuries were caused by the stink bombs
but the stores will be kept closed until the
noxious fumes are removed by fans and chemi
cal deodorizers, Von's spokesman Stuart
Rosenthal said.
Separately, Frank Allen, a federal mediator,
indicated the first significant progress at the

bargaining table since the walkout began Nov.
5.
He said one of the striking unions, the
Teamsters, returned to negotiations yester
day and were making progress. No talks are
scheduled with striking meatcutters.
State Losing Revenue
SACRAMENTO — The state loses $2 bil
lion a year in unpaid income taxes, partly due
to a growing "underground economy," say offi
cials who differ on ways to improve tax
collection efficiency and fairness.
Witnesses at an Assembly Revenue and
Taxation Committee hearing yesterday sug
gested such steps as consolidating California's
two largest tax agencies, hiring more tax
auditors and simplifying the tax system as
ways to fight tax evasion.
Michael Kassan, former chairman of the
Little Hoover Commission's advisory commit

tee on the underground economy, estimated
that the underground economy involves $40
biliion a year in cash transactions designed to
avoid sales or income taxes.
Unhappy Christmas
LOS ANGELES — Three years and two
dozen postponements after a film producer
pleaded no contest to swindling $1.5 million
from investors, George Le Fave has been sen
tenced to two years in prison.
Le Fave, 42, an independent filmmaker who
made a TV cartoon called "The Bear That
Slept Through Christmas," was sentenced
Monday on three counts of grand theft and
three counts of unlawful sale of securities.
He pleaded no contest to the six counts in
1982 after prosecutors agreed to drop 41
other counts against him.
Superior Court Judge Gordon Ringer called
Le Fave "the grinch who stole Christmas."
