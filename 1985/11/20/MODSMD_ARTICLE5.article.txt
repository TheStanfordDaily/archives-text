# ASSU Calls Election
## 
### DAVID EMERSON Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night moved to hold a special
winter quarter referendum on the new Council of
Presidents (COP)-sponsored constitution and on the
advisability of divesting the ASSU's funds from the
University's merged endowment investments.
The senate also passed an amended version of the
Program Board funding guidelines and questioned
University President Donald Kennedy concerning the
viability of having Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev as
a Commencement speaker.
The referendum, which is scheduled to be held Jan.
28-29, is provisional upon the submission of petitions
signed by more than 5 percent of the student body by
Dec. 13. Supporters of the new constitution plan to
start circulating petitions by the beginning of Dead
Week.
As originally proposed by the COP, the new consti
tution includes provisions for reducing the size of the
senate and dividing it into two bodies — one dealing
with funding and the other with legislative matters.
Senators Mary Thurber and Jim DeLaHunt, Senate
Chair Carey White and Deputy Chair Ed Renwick are
working with COP members Mike Collins, Tim Quirk
and Andy Frisch to produce a final version of the pro
posal.
A draft is expected by this Sunday, according to
White.
Also on the ballot for the winter election is an initia

tive asking students whether they feel the ASSU
should withdraw its investments from the University's
general pool on the grounds that these investments in
clude holdings in companies which do business with
South Africa.
The initiative, authored by senators Joel Bellenson
and Richard Beigel, is designed to gauge student
opinion. It requires no action by the senate if ap
proved.
In other business, the senate debated general fund
ing guidelines presented by DeLaHunt for Program
Board appropriations. After senator David Porter
succeeded in a motion to separate some of the more
controversial provisions from the rest of the bill, the
amended version of the guidelines was approved by a
13-2 margin.
The separated provisions, dealing with the treat
ment of voluntary student organizations versus the
treatment of non-voluntary groups (such as fraterni
ties) and the Program Board's policy against funding
social events and parties, were sent back to the Ap
propriations Committee for further study.
Kennedy, when questioned on whether Gorbachev
will receive "serious consideration" as a Commence
ment speaker, said, "Sure thing — but I can't guaran
tee that we'll get serious consideration from him."
Also, Kennedy said that he wonders if Gorbachev
would provide the kind of Commencement that seniors
would want.
Nevertheless, he stated that if, all things consid
ered, the seniors still want to invite Gorbachev, the
University will "try to be cooperative."
