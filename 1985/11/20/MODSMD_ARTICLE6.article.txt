# Panofsky Says SDI Plays on False Hopes
## FEATURES 
### CHARLES SEAVEY Staff writer 
Wolfgang Panofsky, director emeritus of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, stressed in
an interview with The Daily that the U.S.
Congress must consider the long-term strategic
value of offensive and defensive weapons pro
grams before it funds them. He also voiced his
opinion that "a deployed defense against ballistic
missiles doesn't make any sense in the face of a
determined opponent."
Panofsky has a long history of experience with
strategic military matters. Since participating in
the "Trinity Test" in 1945, in which the first nu
clear explosive was detonated, he has been in
volved in such projects as the first investigation
of the possibility of smuggling nuclear explosives
into this country and the development of the first
early warning systems against missile attack.
He has been chairman of the Strategic Military
Panel of the President's Science Advisory Com
mittee under Presidents Eisenhower and Ken
nedy. and a member of the General Advisory
Committee on Arms Control to the J resident
under President Carter.
He is currently a member of the Committee
on International Security and Arms Control of
the National Academy of Sciences.

Panofsky underscored the need to evaluate
programs such as the Strategic Defense Initia
tive (SDI) on their own merit.
"One of the worst ways to settle an argument
about whether or not to implement an offensive or
defensive program is to say 'the Soviets are
doing it,' " he said. "We should reduce our argu
ments in Congress to the question of Do we
reallv need it?' Never mind what the other guy's

doing. The Soviets do many things which are
stupid.
"They are making many mistakes; they have
done much which has been damaging to their
own population. So we should establish a strict
standard in Congress that military systems be
valued on their own merit. They shouldn't be im
plemented to show strength, to show patriotism,
to show resolve, to be used as 'bargaining chips.'
These things are real. They kill people.
"For instance, in the MX (missile) debate,
there is almost universal agreement that the MX
is a very bad military system. The reason it
keeps passing by a small margin is that we don't
want to show weakness. Now we simply have to
reject the continuing argument, repeated over
and over again, that we must buy instruments of
death and destruction for some symbolic pur
pose.
"One should take a hard-nosed look at such
proposals with the question, 'Do we need that
thing for our defense and will it help our
defense?' By that standard, the majority of the
things that we do in this area don't make any
sense. And, may I add, the majority of the things
that the Soviets do don't make any sense,"
Panofsky said.
"To lessen our vulnerability in a first strike,
we should be decreasing the number of land-
