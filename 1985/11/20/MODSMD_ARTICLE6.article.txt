# Panofsky Says SDI Plays on False Hopes
## FEATURES 
### CHARLES SEAVEY Staff writer 
Wolfgang Panofsky, director emeritus of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, stressed in
an interview with The Daily that the U.S.
Congress must consider the long-term strategic
value of offensive and defensive weapons pro
grams before it funds them. He also voiced his
opinion that "a deployed defense against ballistic
missiles doesn't make any sense in the face of a
determined opponent."
Panofsky has a long history of experience with
strategic military matters. Since participating in
the "Trinity Test" in 1945, in which the first nu
clear explosive was detonated, he has been in
volved in such projects as the first investigation
of the possibility of smuggling nuclear explosives
into this country and the development of the first
early warning systems against missile attack.
He has been chairman of the Strategic Military
Panel of the President's Science Advisory Com
mittee under Presidents Eisenhower and Ken
nedy. and a member of the General Advisory
Committee on Arms Control to the J resident
under President Carter.
He is currently a member of the Committee
on International Security and Arms Control of
the National Academy of Sciences.

Panofsky underscored the need to evaluate
programs such as the Strategic Defense Initia
tive (SDI) on their own merit.
"One of the worst ways to settle an argument
about whether or not to implement an offensive or
defensive program is to say 'the Soviets are
doing it,' " he said. "We should reduce our argu
ments in Congress to the question of Do we
reallv need it?' Never mind what the other guy's

doing. The Soviets do many things which are
stupid.
"They are making many mistakes; they have
done much which has been damaging to their
own population. So we should establish a strict
standard in Congress that military systems be
valued on their own merit. They shouldn't be im
plemented to show strength, to show patriotism,
to show resolve, to be used as 'bargaining chips.'
These things are real. They kill people.
"For instance, in the MX (missile) debate,
there is almost universal agreement that the MX
is a very bad military system. The reason it
keeps passing by a small margin is that we don't
want to show weakness. Now we simply have to
reject the continuing argument, repeated over
and over again, that we must buy instruments of
death and destruction for some symbolic pur
pose.
"One should take a hard-nosed look at such
proposals with the question, 'Do we need that
thing for our defense and will it help our
defense?' By that standard, the majority of the
things that we do in this area don't make any
sense. And, may I add, the majority of the things
that the Soviets do don't make any sense,"
Panofsky said.
"To lessen our vulnerability in a first strike,
we should be decreasing the number of land-


Reality, Not Symbolism
based missiles, not increasing it,
and increasing the number of sub
marine and bomber based
missiles. ... It was considered
whether the MX should be made
small enough to fit into airplanes,
and this was rejected, interestingly
enough, not for technical reasons
but because, for prestige/resolve
reasons, our missiles would have to
be just as big as the Soviet SS-9 and
SS-18.
"The most destructive argu
ments are those that mix military
necessity and potential of military
use with arguments of using these
things as symbols — because, in a
war of symbols, there's no way of
knowing when enough is enough."
Not a Bargaining Chip
Panofsky said he does not agree
with backing SDI in order to give
President Reagan a bargaining chip
for the Geneva Summit, and
warned that "the danger with that is
that when you start using a bargain
ing chip, you may get stuck with it.
And if it's no good, you don't want
to get stuck with it.
"More importantly, if it is in
tended to be a bargaining chip, then
you should bargain with it. At the
present moment, the president has
made it abundantly clear that he
isn't going to do that.
"I think it is a mistake to initiate a
process which everybody agrees is
going to cost billions of dollars
simply in its research and develop
ment phase and in which a deploy
ment decision may be considered
10 or 15 years from now to be a
bargaining chip. ... I mean we're
bargaining in Geneva now, and
what we're talking about with the
SDI is initiating a process which will
go on for decades. The two time
scales are simply incompatible. The
SDI has to be judged on its own
merits," Panofsky said.

Remote Possibilities
Discussing SDI in particular,
Panfosky said he questioned
whether even the possibility exists
to switch from an "offense
dominated" stability to a "defense
dominated" stability.
"The goal of the SDI is, at least
the president's version, to reverse
the present stability from what is
called an offense-dominated
stability to a defense-dominated
stability."
Moderation of Research
Although doubting the possibili
ties of strategic success for SDI,
Panofsky said that that he was in fa
vor of continuing such funding, but
at a level comparable to the level
which existed before Reagan's
March 23, 1983, "Star Wars"
speech.
Panofsky said that continued re
search of strategic defense was ne
cessary in order to avoid what he
called "technological surprise" and
to continue to be able to interpret
new Soviet weapons or innova
tions.
He added that a certain level of
research was necessary to continue
reviewing the somewhat remote
possibilities for a strategically intel
ligent defense system in the future:
"I have the current conclusion that
a deployed defense against ballistic
missiles doesn't make any sense in
the face of a determined opponent.
But, like any conclusion, one should
keep reviewing it in terms of evolv
ing knowledge. So I think we should
keep up with that knowledge."
Not Under Present Conditions
Panofsky said that "under no
conditions" that he could foresee at
the present moment would he be in
favor of deploying a strategic
defense system.
"With the technology that I see
and particularly with the counter
measures which the other side can

adopt, I would not be in favor of
deployment. I would be willing to
review the situation at a time when
the total number of nuclear weap
ons in the world is much lower than
it is today. So until and unless there
have been drastic reductions, I
don't foresee any sense in the
deployment of a system," he said.
"In the kind of science which we

normally do, we are basically fight
ing nature or trying to uncover
things which nature does. Given
enough effort and enough time and
enough ingenuity, you keep inex
orably making progress. But nature
doesn't fight back. Nature is there.
People often say that if we can go to
the moon, we can do the SDL
That's silly. I mean the moon didn't
fight back; there were no little
green men who shot at the
astronauts. Here the issue is not
'Can you accomplish it?' The point
is that you're initiating (something)
which the other side doesn't like.
We do something. They do some
thing. We do something. They do
something."
He stressed that deployment
would be tantamount to beginning a
"defense race."

"You have to analyze whether, if
you go through this process, you
end up with more security for the
United States. And the answer to
that is simply 'No,' within the tech
nology as I know it,"he said.
Loopholes of SDI
Panofsky said he finds other
limitations of the proposed strategic
defense.
"At the present moment, the
SDI program exclusively worries
about defense against ballistic
missiles. Defense against cruise
missiles is very difficult, and, at
present, it's not being emphasized.
"But that's only one of many. I
mean there is also the question of
defense against penetrating
bombers. There is the question of
defense against nuclear weapons
which might be hidden on board
ship. So there are all these possibil
ities you have to think through. So
another objection I have is the ex
clusive emphasis on ballistic
missiles, which is only one way of
delivering nuclear weapons," he
said.
Panofsky said he also sees a
problem in that one would be unable
to conclusively test a strategic
defense system made of the pres
ently foreseeable technology.
"I am familiar with turning on big
accelerators, and one thing I can
assure you is that they don't work
the first time, or the second time,
or the third time. Any time we
make a large change and then turn
the machine back on, we go
through a long period of getting the
bugs out. I simply see no way in
which a system of this kind, which
is very complex and involves
hundreds of thousands of lines of
code and is an interrelated system,
will work the first time. And there
is no way to test the whole system.
"You can test components, you
can do modeling, you can exercise
it in the presumed ways in which a

conflict will go, but the actual con
flict won't go that way. So you can't
test it. And therefore, when push
comes to shove, you can't depend
on it. You just create an even big
ger dilemma than we have already,"
he said.
Sincerity Not Sufficient
Although doubting the possibili
ties of success for the president's
notion of SDI, Panofsky said "I
have no reason to think he (Reagan)
is not sincere. I think that he was
sincere when he delivered his
speech (March 1983) although I am
totally persuaded, and I know a
great deal about it, that he had ab
solutely minimal technical advice
before he made the speech."
Scientists Not To Blame
Panofsky challenged the sugges
tion that it is in part the zeal of sci
entists that is responsible for en
couraging funding for the develop
ment of an SDI program. "It was,
as I mentioned, the president who
initiated the program after very
little consultation, so scientists
can't be blamed for starting the
SDI," he said.
"Not a Man of Detail"
Panofsky expressed ambivalence
concerning the ability of Edward
Teller, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institute and outspoken
proponent of SDI, to judge a scien
tific and strategic issue such as
SDI.
"Mr. Teller has not personally
really been involved in science for
several decades. He has always
been a strong advocate for nuclear
explosives, which are to some ex
tent his child, for all sorts of
purposes. He has been advocating
using nuclear explosives for mining
harbors, for stimulating gas
recovery, and so on. He has
opposed any limitations on nuclear
weapons. He has opposed any form

of test ban. He has, in my view, an
almost pathological view of the Rus
sian system.
"On the other hand, he is not a
man of detail. He likes to push in
certain directions, but he really is
not concerned with the actual func
tioning of things. And I seem to dis
agree with him in this phase of
defenses. My point of view is very
simple: The nuclear age has in
creased by a factor of over a million
the total amount of explosive power
you can pack into a given size and
weight of a weapon, and that has
tremendously tilted the scale of of
fense against defense. The job of
the defender in the nuclear age has
become harder by that factor of a
million."
Do Not Despair
In light of the virtual impossibility
of reducing the threat of nuclear
weapons with a defense system,
Panofsky said he sees the only solu
tion as being political. "The only
way to get there (to a reduction of
the burden and danger of nuclear
weapons) is to improve the political
rapport between the two sides and
reduce the total number of nuclear
weapons, and not try to do what
we're doing now, making a
propaganda war out of it, but doing
serious negotiation to cut these
things down.
"One reason why I'm not all that
pessimistic is that if we look at our
relations with China we'll see that
as little as 15 years ago, the
Chinese were the devil; we had to
'fight them on all fronts.' Now all
administrations, both Republican
and Democratic administrations,
are suddenly ignoring their [anti
communism] and are willing to start
cooperation," he said.
The Daily has scheduled an inter
view with Edward Teller which will
take place in December. The inter
view should be published in early
January.

That's silly. I mean the moon didn't

'Can you accomplish it?' The point
is that you're initiating (something)

He stressed that deployment
would be tantamount to beginning a

"You have to analyze whether, if
you go through this process, you

that is simply 'No,' within the tech

Panofsky said he finds other
limitations of the proposed strategic
defense.
"At the present moment, the
SDI program exclusively worries
about defense against ballistic
missiles. Defense against cruise
missiles is very difficult, and, at

"But that's only one of many. I
mean there is also the question of

another objection I have is the ex

delivering nuclear weapons," he
said.
Panofsky said he also sees a
problem in that one would be unable
to conclusively test a strategic
defense system made of the pres
ently foreseeable technology.
"I am familiar with turning on big
accelerators, and one thing I can
assure you is that they don't work
the first time, or the second time,
or the third time. Any time we
make a large change and then turn
the machine back on, we go
through a long period of getting the
bugs out. I simply see no way in
which a system of this kind, which
is very complex and involves
hundreds of thousands of lines of
code and is an interrelated system,
will work the first time. And there
is no way to test the whole system.

sincere when he delivered his

totally persuaded, and I know a

solutely minimal technical advice
before he made the speech."
Scientists Not To Blame
Panofsky challenged the sugges
tion that it is in part the zeal of sci
entists that is responsible for en
couraging funding for the develop
ment of an SDI program. "It was,
as I mentioned, the president who
initiated the program after very
little consultation, so scientists
can't be blamed for starting the
SDI," he said.
"Not a Man of Detail"
Panofsky expressed ambivalence
concerning the ability of Edward
Teller, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institute and outspoken
proponent of SDI, to judge a scien
tific and strategic issue such as
SDI.
"Mr. Teller has not personally
really been involved in science for
several decades. He has always
been a strong advocate for nuclear
explosives, which are to some ex
tent his child, for all sorts of
purposes. He has been advocating
using nuclear explosives for mining
harbors, for stimulating gas
recovery, and so on. He has
opposed any limitations on nuclear
weapons. He has opposed any form

of test ban. He has, in my view, an
almost pathological view of the Rus
sian system.
"On the other hand, he is not a
man of detail. He likes to push in
certain directions, but he really is
not concerned with the actual func
tioning of things. And I seem to dis
agree with him in this phase of
defenses. My point of view is very
simple: The nuclear age has in
creased by a factor of over a million
the total amount of explosive power
you can pack into a given size and
weight of a weapon, and that has
tremendously tilted the scale of of
fense against defense. The job of
the defender in the nuclear age has
become harder by that factor of a
million."
Do Not Despair
In light of the virtual impossibility
of reducing the threat of nuclear
weapons with a defense system,
Panofsky said he sees the only solu

way to get there (to a reduction of
the burden and danger of nuclear
weapons) is to improve the political
rapport between the two sides and
reduce the total number of nuclear
weapons, and not try to do what
we're doing now, making a
propaganda war out of it, but doing
serious negotiation to cut these
things down.
"One reason why I'm not all that
pessimistic is that if we look at our
relations with China we'll see that
as little as 15 years ago, the
Chinese were the devil; we had to
'fight them on all fronts.' Now all
administrations, both Republican
and Democratic administrations,
are suddenly ignoring their [anti
communism] and are willing to start
cooperation," he said.
The Daily has scheduled an inter
view with Edward Teller which will
take place in December. The inter
view should be published in early
January.


Wolfgang Panofsky
Director emeritus of SLAC
Wolfgang Panofsky, director emeritus of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, stressed in
an interview with The Daily that the U.S.
Congress must consider the long-term strategic
value of offensive and defensive weapons pro
grams before it funds them. He also voiced his
opinion that "a deployed defense against ballistic
missiles doesn't make any sense in the face of a
determined opponent."
Panofsky has a long history of experience with
strategic military matters. Since participating in
the "Trinity Test" in 1945, in which the first nu
clear explosive was detonated, he has been in
volved in such projects as the first investigation
of the possibility of smuggling nuclear explosives
into this country and the development of the first
early warning systems against missile attack.
He has been chairman of the Strategic Military
Panel of the President's Science Advisory Com
mittee under Presidents Eisenhower and Ken
nedy. and a member of the General Advisory
Committee on Arms Control to the J resident
under President Carter.
He is currently a member of the Committee
on International Security and Arms Control of
the National Academy of Sciences.

Panofsky underscored the need to evaluate
programs such as the Strategic Defense Initia
tive (SDI) on their own merit.
"One of the worst ways to settle an argument
about whether or not to implement an offensive or
defensive program is to say 'the Soviets are
doing it,' " he said. "We should reduce our argu
ments in Congress to the question of Do we
reallv need it?' Never mind what the other guy's

doing. The Soviets do many things which are
stupid.
"They are making many mistakes; they have
done much which has been damaging to their
own population. So we should establish a strict
standard in Congress that military systems be
valued on their own merit. They shouldn't be im
plemented to show strength, to show patriotism,
to show resolve, to be used as 'bargaining chips.'
These things are real. They kill people.
"For instance, in the MX (missile) debate,
there is almost universal agreement that the MX
is a very bad military system. The reason it
keeps passing by a small margin is that we don't
want to show weakness. Now we simply have to
reject the continuing argument, repeated over
and over again, that we must buy instruments of
death and destruction for some symbolic pur
pose.
"One should take a hard-nosed look at such
proposals with the question, 'Do we need that
thing for our defense and will it help our
defense?' By that standard, the majority of the
things that we do in this area don't make any
sense. And, may I add, the majority of the things
that the Soviets do don't make any sense,"
Panofsky said.
"To lessen our vulnerability in a first strike,
we should be decreasing the number of land-


Reality, Not Symbolism
based missiles, not increasing it,
and increasing the number of sub
marine and bomber based
missiles. ... It was considered
whether the MX should be made
small enough to fit into airplanes,
and this was rejected, interestingly
enough, not for technical reasons
but because, for prestige/resolve
reasons, our missiles would have to
be just as big as the Soviet SS-9 and
SS-18.
"The most destructive argu
ments are those that mix military
necessity and potential of military
use with arguments of using these
things as symbols — because, in a
war of symbols, there's no way of
knowing when enough is enough."
Not a Bargaining Chip
Panofsky said he does not agree
with backing SDI in order to give
President Reagan a bargaining chip
for the Geneva Summit, and
warned that "the danger with that is
that when you start using a bargain
ing chip, you may get stuck with it.
And if it's no good, you don't want
to get stuck with it.
"More importantly, if it is in
tended to be a bargaining chip, then
you should bargain with it. At the
present moment, the president has
made it abundantly clear that he
isn't going to do that.
"I think it is a mistake to initiate a
process which everybody agrees is
going to cost billions of dollars
simply in its research and develop
ment phase and in which a deploy
ment decision may be considered
10 or 15 years from now to be a
bargaining chip. ... I mean we're
bargaining in Geneva now, and
what we're talking about with the
SDI is initiating a process which will
go on for decades. The two time
scales are simply incompatible. The
SDI has to be judged on its own
merits," Panofsky said.

Remote Possibilities
Discussing SDI in particular,
Panfosky said he questioned
whether even the possibility exists
to switch from an "offense
dominated" stability to a "defense
dominated" stability.
"The goal of the SDI is, at least
the president's version, to reverse
the present stability from what is
called an offense-dominated
stability to a defense-dominated
stability."
Moderation of Research
Although doubting the possibili
ties of strategic success for SDI,
Panofsky said that that he was in fa
vor of continuing such funding, but
at a level comparable to the level
which existed before Reagan's
March 23, 1983, "Star Wars"
speech.
Panofsky said that continued re
search of strategic defense was ne
cessary in order to avoid what he
called "technological surprise" and
to continue to be able to interpret
new Soviet weapons or innova
tions.
He added that a certain level of
research was necessary to continue
reviewing the somewhat remote
possibilities for a strategically intel
ligent defense system in the future:
"I have the current conclusion that
a deployed defense against ballistic
missiles doesn't make any sense in
the face of a determined opponent.
But, like any conclusion, one should
keep reviewing it in terms of evolv
ing knowledge. So I think we should
keep up with that knowledge."
Not Under Present Conditions
Panofsky said that "under no
conditions" that he could foresee at
the present moment would he be in
favor of deploying a strategic
defense system.
"With the technology that I see
and particularly with the counter
measures which the other side can

adopt, I would not be in favor of
deployment. I would be willing to
review the situation at a time when
the total number of nuclear weap
ons in the world is much lower than
it is today. So until and unless there
have been drastic reductions, I
don't foresee any sense in the
deployment of a system," he said.
"In the kind of science which we

normally do, we are basically fight
ing nature or trying to uncover
things which nature does. Given
enough effort and enough time and
enough ingenuity, you keep inex
orably making progress. But nature
doesn't fight back. Nature is there.
People often say that if we can go to
the moon, we can do the SDL
That's silly. I mean the moon didn't
fight back; there were no little
green men who shot at the
astronauts. Here the issue is not
'Can you accomplish it?' The point
is that you're initiating (something)
which the other side doesn't like.
We do something. They do some
thing. We do something. They do
something."
He stressed that deployment
would be tantamount to beginning a
"defense race."

"You have to analyze whether, if
you go through this process, you

United States. And the answer to
that is simply 'No,' within the tech

make a large change and then turn
the machine back on, we go

is very complex and involves
hundreds of thousands of lines of
code and is an interrelated system,
will work the first time. And there
is no way to test the whole system.

can do modeling, you can exercise
it in the presumed ways in which a

He is currently a member of the Committee
on International Security and Arms Control of
the National Academy of Sciences.

Panofsky underscored the need to evaluate
programs such as the Strategic Defense Initia
tive (SDI) on their own merit.
"One of the worst ways to settle an argument
about whether or not to implement an offensive or
defensive program is to say 'the Soviets are
doing it,' " he said. "We should reduce our argu
ments in Congress to the question of Do we
reallv need it?' Never mind what the other guy's

doing. The Soviets do many things which are
stupid.
"They are making many mistakes; they have
done much which has been damaging to their
own population. So we should establish a strict
standard in Congress that military systems be
valued on their own merit. They shouldn't be im
plemented to show strength, to show patriotism,
to show resolve, to be used as 'bargaining chips.'
These things are real. They kill people.
"For instance, in the MX (missile) debate,
there is almost universal agreement that the MX
is a very bad military system. The reason it
keeps passing by a small margin is that we don't
want to show weakness. Now we simply have to
reject the continuing argument, repeated over

defense?' By that standard, the majority of the
things that we do in this area don't make any
sense. And, may I add, the majority of the things
that the Soviets do don't make any sense,"
Panofsky said.
"To lessen our vulnerability in a first strike,
we should be decreasing the number of land-


Reality, Not Symbolism
based missiles, not increasing it,
and increasing the number of sub
marine and bomber based
missiles. ... It was considered
whether the MX should be made
small enough to fit into airplanes,
and this was rejected, interestingly
enough, not for technical reasons
but because, for prestige/resolve
reasons, our missiles would have to
be just as big as the Soviet SS-9 and
SS-18.
"The most destructive argu
ments are those that mix military
necessity and potential of military
use with arguments of using these
things as symbols — because, in a
war of symbols, there's no way of
knowing when enough is enough."
Not a Bargaining Chip
Panofsky said he does not agree
with backing SDI in order to give
President Reagan a bargaining chip
for the Geneva Summit, and
warned that "the danger with that is
that when you start using a bargain
ing chip, you may get stuck with it.
And if it's no good, you don't want
to get stuck with it.
"More importantly, if it is in
tended to be a bargaining chip, then
you should bargain with it. At the
present moment, the president has
made it abundantly clear that he
isn't going to do that.
"I think it is a mistake to initiate a
process which everybody agrees is
going to cost billions of dollars
simply in its research and develop
ment phase and in which a deploy
ment decision may be considered
10 or 15 years from now to be a
bargaining chip. ... I mean we're
bargaining in Geneva now, and
what we're talking about with the
SDI is initiating a process which will
go on for decades. The two time
scales are simply incompatible. The
SDI has to be judged on its own
merits," Panofsky said.

Remote Possibilities
Discussing SDI in particular,
Panfosky said he questioned
whether even the possibility exists
to switch from an "offense
dominated" stability to a "defense
dominated" stability.
"The goal of the SDI is, at least
the president's version, to reverse
the present stability from what is
called an offense-dominated
stability to a defense-dominated
stability."
Moderation of Research
Although doubting the possibili
ties of strategic success for SDI,
Panofsky said that that he was in fa
vor of continuing such funding, but
at a level comparable to the level
which existed before Reagan's
March 23, 1983, "Star Wars"
speech.
Panofsky said that continued re
search of strategic defense was ne
cessary in order to avoid what he
called "technological surprise" and
to continue to be able to interpret
new Soviet weapons or innova
tions.
He added that a certain level of
research was necessary to continue
reviewing the somewhat remote
possibilities for a strategically intel
ligent defense system in the future:
"I have the current conclusion that
a deployed defense against ballistic
missiles doesn't make any sense in
the face of a determined opponent.
But, like any conclusion, one should
keep reviewing it in terms of evolv
ing knowledge. So I think we should
keep up with that knowledge."
Not Under Present Conditions
Panofsky said that "under no
conditions" that he could foresee at
the present moment would he be in
favor of deploying a strategic
defense system.
"With the technology that I see
and particularly with the counter
measures which the other side can

adopt, I would not be in favor of
deployment. I would be willing to
review the situation at a time when
the total number of nuclear weap
ons in the world is much lower than
it is today. So until and unless there
have been drastic reductions, I
don't foresee any sense in the
deployment of a system," he said.
"In the kind of science which we

normally do, we are basically fight
ing nature or trying to uncover
things which nature does. Given
enough effort and enough time and
enough ingenuity, you keep inex
orably making progress. But nature
doesn't fight back. Nature is there.
People often say that if we can go to
the moon, we can do the SDL
That's silly. I mean the moon didn't
fight back; there were no little
green men who shot at the
astronauts. Here the issue is not
'Can you accomplish it?' The point
is that you're initiating (something)
which the other side doesn't like.
We do something. They do some
thing. We do something. They do
something."
He stressed that deployment
would be tantamount to beginning a
"defense race."

"You have to analyze whether, if
you go through this process, you
end up with more security for the
United States. And the answer to
that is simply 'No,' within the tech
nology as I know it,"he said.
Loopholes of SDI
Panofsky said he finds other
limitations of the proposed strategic
defense.
"At the present moment, the
SDI program exclusively worries
about defense against ballistic
missiles. Defense against cruise
missiles is very difficult, and, at
present, it's not being emphasized.
"But that's only one of many. I
mean there is also the question of
defense against penetrating
bombers. There is the question of
defense against nuclear weapons
which might be hidden on board
ship. So there are all these possibil
ities you have to think through. So
another objection I have is the ex
clusive emphasis on ballistic
missiles, which is only one way of
delivering nuclear weapons," he
said.
Panofsky said he also sees a
problem in that one would be unable
to conclusively test a strategic
defense system made of the pres
ently foreseeable technology.
"I am familiar with turning on big
accelerators, and one thing I can
assure you is that they don't work
the first time, or the second time,
or the third time. Any time we
make a large change and then turn
the machine back on, we go
through a long period of getting the
bugs out. I simply see no way in
which a system of this kind, which
is very complex and involves
hundreds of thousands of lines of
code and is an interrelated system,
will work the first time. And there
is no way to test the whole system.
"You can test components, you
can do modeling, you can exercise
it in the presumed ways in which a

conflict will go, but the actual con
flict won't go that way. So you can't
test it. And therefore, when push
comes to shove, you can't depend
on it. You just create an even big
ger dilemma than we have already,"
he said.
Sincerity Not Sufficient
Although doubting the possibili
ties of success for the president's
notion of SDI, Panofsky said "I
have no reason to think he (Reagan)
is not sincere. I think that he was
sincere when he delivered his
speech (March 1983) although I am
totally persuaded, and I know a
great deal about it, that he had ab
solutely minimal technical advice
before he made the speech."
Scientists Not To Blame
Panofsky challenged the sugges
tion that it is in part the zeal of sci
entists that is responsible for en
couraging funding for the develop
ment of an SDI program. "It was,
as I mentioned, the president who
initiated the program after very
little consultation, so scientists
can't be blamed for starting the
SDI," he said.
"Not a Man of Detail"
Panofsky expressed ambivalence
concerning the ability of Edward
Teller, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institute and outspoken
proponent of SDI, to judge a scien
tific and strategic issue such as
SDI.
"Mr. Teller has not personally
really been involved in science for
several decades. He has always
been a strong advocate for nuclear
explosives, which are to some ex
tent his child, for all sorts of
purposes. He has been advocating
using nuclear explosives for mining
harbors, for stimulating gas
recovery, and so on. He has
opposed any limitations on nuclear
weapons. He has opposed any form

of test ban. He has, in my view, an
almost pathological view of the Rus
sian system.
"On the other hand, he is not a
man of detail. He likes to push in
certain directions, but he really is
not concerned with the actual func
tioning of things. And I seem to dis
agree with him in this phase of
defenses. My point of view is very
simple: The nuclear age has in
creased by a factor of over a million
the total amount of explosive power
you can pack into a given size and
weight of a weapon, and that has
tremendously tilted the scale of of
fense against defense. The job of
the defender in the nuclear age has
become harder by that factor of a
million."
Do Not Despair
In light of the virtual impossibility
of reducing the threat of nuclear
weapons with a defense system,
Panofsky said he sees the only solu
tion as being political. "The only
way to get there (to a reduction of
the burden and danger of nuclear
weapons) is to improve the political
rapport between the two sides and
reduce the total number of nuclear
weapons, and not try to do what
we're doing now, making a
propaganda war out of it, but doing
serious negotiation to cut these
things down.
"One reason why I'm not all that
pessimistic is that if we look at our
relations with China we'll see that
as little as 15 years ago, the
Chinese were the devil; we had to
'fight them on all fronts.' Now all
administrations, both Republican
and Democratic administrations,
are suddenly ignoring their [anti
communism] and are willing to start
cooperation," he said.
The Daily has scheduled an inter
view with Edward Teller which will
take place in December. The inter
view should be published in early
January.


Wolfgang Panofsky
Director emeritus of SLAC
Wolfgang Panofsky, director emeritus of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, stressed in
an interview with The Daily that the U.S.
Congress must consider the long-term strategic
value of offensive and defensive weapons pro
grams before it funds them. He also voiced his
opinion that "a deployed defense against ballistic
missiles doesn't make any sense in the face of a
determined opponent."
Panofsky has a long history of experience with
strategic military matters. Since participating in
the "Trinity Test" in 1945, in which the first nu
clear explosive was detonated, he has been in
volved in such projects as the first investigation
of the possibility of smuggling nuclear explosives
into this country and the development of the first
early warning systems against missile attack.
He has been chairman of the Strategic Military
Panel of the President's Science Advisory Com

"defense race."

"You have to analyze whether, if
you go through this process, you
end up with more security for the
United States. And the answer to
that is simply 'No,' within the tech
nology as I know it,"he said.
Loopholes of SDI
Panofsky said he finds other
limitations of the proposed strategic
defense.
"At the present moment, the
SDI program exclusively worries
about defense against ballistic
missiles. Defense against cruise
missiles is very difficult, and, at
present, it's not being emphasized.
"But that's only one of many. I
mean there is also the question of
defense against penetrating
bombers. There is the question of
defense against nuclear weapons
which might be hidden on board
ship. So there are all these possibil
ities you have to think through. So
another objection I have is the ex
clusive emphasis on ballistic
missiles, which is only one way of
delivering nuclear weapons," he
said.
Panofsky said he also sees a
problem in that one would be unable
to conclusively test a strategic
defense system made of the pres
ently foreseeable technology.
"I am familiar with turning on big
accelerators, and one thing I can
assure you is that they don't work
the first time, or the second time,
or the third time. Any time we
make a large change and then turn
the machine back on, we go
through a long period of getting the
bugs out. I simply see no way in
which a system of this kind, which
is very complex and involves
hundreds of thousands of lines of
code and is an interrelated system,
will work the first time. And there
is no way to test the whole system.
"You can test components, you
can do modeling, you can exercise
it in the presumed ways in which a

conflict will go, but the actual con
flict won't go that way. So you can't
test it. And therefore, when push
comes to shove, you can't depend
on it. You just create an even big
ger dilemma than we have already,"
he said.
Sincerity Not Sufficient
Although doubting the possibili
ties of success for the president's
notion of SDI, Panofsky said "I
have no reason to think he (Reagan)
is not sincere. I think that he was
sincere when he delivered his
speech (March 1983) although I am
totally persuaded, and I know a
great deal about it, that he had ab
solutely minimal technical advice
before he made the speech."
Scientists Not To Blame
Panofsky challenged the sugges
tion that it is in part the zeal of sci
entists that is responsible for en
couraging funding for the develop
ment of an SDI program. "It was,
as I mentioned, the president who
initiated the program after very
little consultation, so scientists
can't be blamed for starting the
SDI," he said.
"Not a Man of Detail"
Panofsky expressed ambivalence
concerning the ability of Edward
Teller, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institute and outspoken
proponent of SDI, to judge a scien
tific and strategic issue such as
SDI.
"Mr. Teller has not personally
really been involved in science for
several decades. He has always
been a strong advocate for nuclear
explosives, which are to some ex
tent his child, for all sorts of
purposes. He has been advocating
using nuclear explosives for mining
harbors, for stimulating gas
recovery, and so on. He has
opposed any limitations on nuclear
weapons. He has opposed any form

of test ban. He has, in my view, an
almost pathological view of the Rus
sian system.
"On the other hand, he is not a
man of detail. He likes to push in
certain directions, but he really is
not concerned with the actual func
tioning of things. And I seem to dis
agree with him in this phase of
defenses. My point of view is very
simple: The nuclear age has in
creased by a factor of over a million
the total amount of explosive power
you can pack into a given size and
weight of a weapon, and that has
tremendously tilted the scale of of
fense against defense. The job of
the defender in the nuclear age has
become harder by that factor of a
million."
Do Not Despair
In light of the virtual impossibility
of reducing the threat of nuclear
weapons with a defense system,
Panofsky said he sees the only solu
tion as being political. "The only
way to get there (to a reduction of
the burden and danger of nuclear
weapons) is to improve the political
rapport between the two sides and
reduce the total number of nuclear
weapons, and not try to do what
we're doing now, making a
propaganda war out of it, but doing
serious negotiation to cut these
things down.
"One reason why I'm not all that
pessimistic is that if we look at our
relations with China we'll see that
as little as 15 years ago, the
Chinese were the devil; we had to
'fight them on all fronts.' Now all
administrations, both Republican
and Democratic administrations,
are suddenly ignoring their [anti
communism] and are willing to start
cooperation," he said.
The Daily has scheduled an inter
view with Edward Teller which will
take place in December. The inter
view should be published in early
January.
