# Scientists Discuss Benefits Of Possible Mars Research

Three members of the National Commission on
Space, an astrogeologist with the U.S. Geological Sur
vey and astronomer Carl Sagan told a near-capacity
audience at Dinkelspiel Auditorium last night of the
challenges and possible benefits inherent in future ex
ploration of Mars.
Mars is "by far the most attractive candidate" of the
several potential locations for human colonization,
Commission Vice-Chair Laurel Wilkening said at a
symposium entitled "Continuing Steps to Mars."
The next U.S. mission to Mars is set to be made by
the Mars Observer in 1990, two years after a planned
Soviet mission to the planet, according to Michael
Carr, an astrogeologist who has authored a book on
Mars and worked on the Apollo, Voyager, Orbiter and
Viking space exploration projects.
Carr, who spoke before the panel discussion, said
the main gaps in knowledge about Mars are in under
standing the chemistry and minerology of its surface.
One of the most puzzling aspects of Mars has to do
with water, he said. Sub-freezing temperatures on the
planet's surface preclude the existence of fluid bodies
of water, but extensive evidence of large-scale flood
ing on the surface indicates that climatic conditions on
Mars have changed significantly.
Most knowledge about Mars comes from the Viking

missions in 1976, during which photographs were
taken and experiments were conducted to detect the
existence of life, Carr said.
"There is almost universal agreement that what is
needed next is a sample of the surface," he said. But
many other decisions must be made, such as whether
to take one sample or use a roving vehicle, and
whether the spacecraft should be manned, according
to Carr.
Carr said that while he does not believe the main
rationale behind a manned mission is scientific,
"Historically, we've always explored those areas
within our technological capabilities. I do believe live
missions to Mars are inevitable. The uncertainties are
whether we are going to do it and who" will go on the
mission.
Rumors in the international scientific community
and recent extended manned flights in space by the
Soviets indicate that the Soviet Union is planning to
launch a manned flight to Mars, Carr said.
"I feel this is an area we could realistically hook up"
in international cooperation, he said, adding that the
mission would also benefit science.
Among the technological challenges to be con
fronted before such a mission can take place is how
to shorten the length of the mission, which would cur
rently have to last about 1,000 days and would subject
astronauts to severe physiological stresses, Carr said.
He suggested that nuclear boosters could cut the
length of the mission by at least half.
