# Summit Signals Open Dialogue, Says Statesman

### MORTY POSNER 
Speaking on the day of the final session of the
Geneva summit, the West German ambassador to the
United States said he thinks the meeting between the
superpowers signaled a "green light of genuine
dialogue" for Western and Eastern Europe.
Gunther van Wall, speaking to a group of 60 at the
Campbell Recital Hall in Braun Music Center yester
day, commended President Reagan for not limiting the
summit's agenda to arms control.
Speaking about the summit between Reagan and So
viet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, van Wall said he hoped
this meeting between the two would bring a new
meeting with a "broadened and deepened dialogue."
"This first meeting should not be loaded with expec
tations," van Wall said, later adding "we don't expect
too much too quickly."
On the subject of Reagan's Strategic Defense Initia
tive (SDI), van Wall said that his government has
stated that SDI is justified as a research program but
that its strategic use undermines the U.S. policy of
deterrence.
Van Wall said it was surprising to hear of this use of
the SDI, but SDI research should proceed so long as it
is in line with the restrictive interpretation of the Anti-
Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty which calls for research
but no development or testing.
Expressing a hope that the Soviets won't break the
ABM Treaty as SDI research progresses, van Wall
said, "We assume the other side will keep the treaty
while we research." Van Wall also expressed a hope
that a Soviet treaty violation would not be followed by a
"tit-for-tat" treaty violation which, van Wall said,
"erodes the purpose of treaties."
On other topics, van Wall said that meetings such as
the current summit stimulate the nations of the NATO
alliance to work toward the "necessity of integrating
Europe."
"West Germany cannot maintain its own balance,"
