# Doctor Debunks AIDS Fallacies

AIDS is a disease that has continued to defy
attempts to find a cure, but the illness is not a
complete mystery, according to Dr. Donald
Abrams, the assistant director of the AIDS Clinic
at San Francisco General Hospital.
Abrams, speaking at History Corner last night
in an event sponsored by the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanford (GLAS), outlined the history
of research into acquired immune deficiency
syndrome and presented an overview of infor
mation currently known about the disease and
the virus linked to it.
Abrams emphasized that AIDS cannot be
spread by casual contact of any kind. Recalling
the uproar in a San Francisco congregation over
the possibility that AIDS might be spread by the
passing of the communion cup, Abrams said that
if such a thing were possible, the disease would

have contaminated the entire congregation by
now.
The AIDS researcher said that although one
death a day in San Francisco from the disease is
cause for concern, the fear spread by
epidemiologists who theorize that the number of
new cases doubles every six to 12 months is un
warranted.
But, he added, "AIDS is a disease that is 100
percent fatal and will continue to be so until we
can figure out exactly what to do about it."
Abrams also noted that none of the drugs on
the market currently touted as cures for AIDS
even comes close to being conclusively effective
in neutralizing the virus believed to cause AIDS.
The HTLV-111 virus — as the organism is offi
cially called — belongs to a special class of
viruses which have the peculiar ability to
reproduce themselves in a way that allows them
to "twine" around the nucleus of a immune sys
tem cell (lymphocyte) and stay there "forever,"

according to Abrams. The virus identifies a lym
phocyte, attaches itself to it, and, in effect, fuses
itself with the cell's genetic structure, prevent
ing the cell from carrying out its normal function
of combatting foreign substances, he said.
This unique "entwining" ability has thus far
frustrated efforts by researchers to find the
"magic bullet" that would deter the virus from
attaching to the cell, Abrams said. He added that
at this point, the only drug that would effectively
combat the virus would be a drug taken in
chronic therapy similar to that given to diabetes
patients, who must take insulin shots once a day.
The body, after its immune system has been
destabilized by the virus, is easily afflicted by op
portunistic infections that humans normally can
combat with antibodies, according to Abrams.
For instance, Kaposi's sarcoma, which once oc
curred most frequently among elderly Italian and
Jewish men, now invades the bodies of AIDS vic
tims in a much more pronounced form.
