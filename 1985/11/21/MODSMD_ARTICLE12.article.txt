On Nov. 15 in Northern Ireland, Irish and British
officials signed a bold agreement giving the Irish
government a consultative role in governing North
ern Ireland's affairs.
The purpose of the agreement, in British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's words, was "to offer
hope to young people particularly that the cycle of
violence and conflict can be broken." The govern
ments claim that the accord will improve the lives of
Catholics in Northern Ireland and therefore
decrease the violence that plagues the province.
Whether or not this is a realistic expectation remains
to be seen.
Violence in Northern Ireland, provoked by the
bitter conflict between Protestants (mostly British
loyalists) and Catholics (mainly Irish nationalists),
has become a part of people's daily lives. In the past
16 years, 2,500 people have been killed in more
than 43,000 incidents of shooting, bombing and ar
son.
Often the Irish Republican Army (1.R.A.) is held
solely responsible for the violence, but this ignores
the reality of British rule. Catholics make up less
than 10 percent of the police force, and police
practices reflect this imbalance. Catholics are regu
larly the victims of police harassment and brutality,
and Northern Ireland's prison system is one of the
most brutal in the world. Furthermore, Catholics
and Protestants alike live in abject poverty in ghet
tos that rival the Third World in their desperation.
The state of Northern Ireland is so bad that a recent

New York Times editorial deemed the entire prov
ince a "slum."
As long as conditions like these persist, Catholics
and Protestants will turn against each other and
toward violence. The success or failure of the
recent agreement will depend on whether or not it
actually affects the living conditions of people in
Northern Ireland. If the agreement fails to improve
Catholics' lives, the only result will be to convince
the Catholic population that there is no hope for
peaceful change. In this case, the I.R.A. and its poli
tical wing, Sinn Fein, will gain legitimacy in Cat
holics' eyes, and the violence will escalate.
In any case, the best word to describe the current
accord is "fragile." Already loyalists are accusing
Thatcher of betrayal and promising boycotts and
resistance. Protestants have their own armed
militias that strongly oppose any Irish role in
governing the province. In 1973, an accord designed
to allow a greater Irish role was abandoned due to
pressure from the loyalists.
The agreement should be hailed as a symbol that
Great Britain is searching for a solution to the con
flict, but Northern Ireland must be watched closely
to see if any concrete changes result. The Irish gov
ernment has called the accord the beginning of a
process of improving relations between Catholics
and Protestants. For this to materialize, the accord
must go beyond symbolism and actually change the
province from a slum into a country offering hope for
the peaceful improvement of people's lives.
