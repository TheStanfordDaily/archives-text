# 'Star Wars' Plan Lacks Support
## 
### 
In an age where millions of people go hungry
each day and basic education and health care are
denied to a majority of the world's people, the
funneling of billions of dollars into nuclear weap
ons of destruction stands out as one of the sick
est and most terrifying aspects of the super
power conflict. The people of the United States
want peace; we want the arms race to stop. In a
recent poll by Time magazine, nearly 75 percent
of the people polled were willing to drop "Star
Wars" in return for Soviet military cuts. As
evidenced by the recent growth of groups like
Nuclear Freeze, a grassroots peace movement
is growing here.

Europeans, caught in the battlefield of nuclear
proliferation, are even clearer and more adamant
about ending the threat of nuclear war.
Demonstrations of tens and even hundreds of
thousands of people have been occurring for
years, pushing European governments to take a
stand against the arms race. Many governments
are taking increasingly active roles; in late Octo
ber a letter from the leaders of Mexico, India,
Sweden, Tanzania, Argentina and Greece
publicly called for "concrete" results from the
U.S.-Soviet summit. The New Zealand govern
ment, in response to demands from its people,
no longer allows nuclear vessels to use its ports.
Is there a basis for hoping that these strong
sentiments for peace will lead to significant steps
to curtail the arms race? Unfortunately, Presi

dent Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev are not the most promising architects for
peace. As evidenced by Nicaragua, the
Philippines, Afghanistan and Poland, neither of
the superpowers seems to have much respect
for peoples' desire for peace and self
determination. Under Reagan, U.S. foreign
policy has become increasingly militaristic and
aggressive — witness the invasion of Grenada
and multiple increases in aid to governments,
like those of El Salvador and Guatemala, that
torture and murder their own citizens. It should
be no surprise that Reagan is again on the offen
sive when it comes to the arms race.
Reagan has been put on the defensive by the
Soviet proposals to cut nuclear arms by 50 per
cent, but he refuses to let go of his "Star Wars"
proposal. Billed as a defensive system, space
weapons that could protect us from Soviet
retaliation would make a U.S. first strike possi
ble. Pushing this system will also force the
Soviets to respond to this new level of confronta
tion, draining their country economically.
As people and governments worldwide
demand that the superpowers work toward
peace, we in the United States have a responsi
bility to join them. Because the United States
and the Reagan Administration in particular are
providing the main push to the arms race, we
should lobby our government to pursue peace.
It will be difficult to influence the Administra
tion to drop "Star Wars" and to agree to a nu
clear freeze and test ban. Decisions made by this
Administration are neither democratic nor
responsive to public opinion or the needs of the
American people.
Reagan's decision to go ahead with "Star
Wars" is a case in point. In contrast to his official
statement that the decision was reached after
consultation with his advisers, Reagan made the
decision and kept it secret from all but a half

dozen National Security Council staff members
until hours before it was announced as official
policy. A detailed account by the San Jose Mer
cury News of the way the decision was formu
lated and carried out includes the comment by
one participant that this was "a fabulous study of
top-down leadership."
It became critical to the plan to avoid any
doubters in the security council and Joint Chiefs
of Staff and to avoid completely debate by
keeping Congress, the bureaucracy and the
media in the dark.
Of special interest to us at Stanford is the
composition of Reagan's so-called "kitchen
cabinet," the small group of friends and advisers
that he depends on to work out his plans. In the
"Star Wars" case, five of the people who worked
closely with Reagan are also strong supporters
of the Hoover Institution: brewer Joseph Coors,
paper magnate Karl Bendetsen, investor and
rancher William Wilson, food magnate Jacqueline
Hume and nuclear physicist Edward Teller. It is
chilling to recognize the close connection be
tween Hoover and the most conservative sup
porters of U.S. policy.
Stanford tries to portray itself as a liberal
campus, open and encouraging to all different
points of view. With the nation's "premier con
servative think tank" giving active support to the
Reagan Administration, this is nothing but a fal
lacy. A recent speaker from South Africa made
me realize that Hoover's influence is not only na
tional. The racist South African government con
siders Stanford, due to the Hoover connection,
one of the strongest pillars of support for apart
heid.
The Stanford community must join together in
ensuring that this think tank is removed from our
campus.

In an age where millions of people go hungry
each day and basic education and health care are
denied to a majority of the world's people, the
funneling of billions of dollars into nuclear weap
ons of destruction stands out as one of the sick
est and most terrifying aspects of the super
power conflict. The people of the United States
want peace; we want the arms race to stop. In a
recent poll by Time magazine, nearly 75 percent
of the people polled were willing to drop "Star
Wars" in return for Soviet military cuts. As
evidenced by the recent growth of groups like
Nuclear Freeze, a grassroots peace movement
is growing here.

Europeans, caught in the battlefield of nuclear
proliferation, are even clearer and more adamant
about ending the threat of nuclear war.
Demonstrations of tens and even hundreds of
thousands of people have been occurring for
years, pushing European governments to take a
stand against the arms race. Many governments
are taking increasingly active roles; in late Octo
ber a letter from the leaders of Mexico, India,
Sweden, Tanzania, Argentina and Greece
publicly called for "concrete" results from the
U.S.-Soviet summit. The New Zealand govern
ment, in response to demands from its people,
no longer allows nuclear vessels to use its ports.
Is there a basis for hoping that these strong
sentiments for peace will lead to significant steps
to curtail the arms race? Unfortunately, Presi

dent Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev are not the most promising architects for
peace. As evidenced by Nicaragua, the
Philippines, Afghanistan and Poland, neither of
the superpowers seems to have much respect
for peoples' desire for peace and self
determination. Under Reagan, U.S. foreign
policy has become increasingly militaristic and
aggressive — witness the invasion of Grenada
and multiple increases in aid to governments,
like those of El Salvador and Guatemala, that
torture and murder their own citizens. It should
be no surprise that Reagan is again on the offen
sive when it comes to the arms race.
Reagan has been put on the defensive by the
Soviet proposals to cut nuclear arms by 50 per
cent, but he refuses to let go of his "Star Wars"
proposal. Billed as a defensive system, space
weapons that could protect us from Soviet
retaliation would make a U.S. first strike possi
ble. Pushing this system will also force the
Soviets to respond to this new level of confronta
tion, draining their country economically.
As people and governments worldwide
demand that the superpowers work toward
peace, we in the United States have a responsi
bility to join them. Because the United States
and the Reagan Administration in particular are
providing the main push to the arms race, we
should lobby our government to pursue peace.
It will be difficult to influence the Administra
tion to drop "Star Wars" and to agree to a nu
clear freeze and test ban. Decisions made by this
Administration are neither democratic nor
responsive to public opinion or the needs of the
American people.
Reagan's decision to go ahead with "Star
Wars" is a case in point. In contrast to his official
statement that the decision was reached after
consultation with his advisers, Reagan made the
decision and kept it secret from all but a half

dozen National Security Council staff members
until hours before it was announced as official
policy. A detailed account by the San Jose Mer
cury News of the way the decision was formu
lated and carried out includes the comment by
one participant that this was "a fabulous study of
top-down leadership."
It became critical to the plan to avoid any
doubters in the security council and Joint Chiefs
of Staff and to avoid completely debate by
