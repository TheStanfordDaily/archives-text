## Accuracy in Academia Squelches Freedom 
### 
The money and the brains may
come from elsewhere. But last
year, I witnessed the birth of Ac
curacy in Academia. At the time,
some of us wondered whether we
were really at the University of Cal
ifornia at Davis, because some of
the things that happened seemed to
belong in the next "Rambo"
picture.

VIEWPOINT

Accuracy in Academia, as you
may have heard, is monitoring pro
fessors across the nation for
ideological bias, especially of a
liberal, anti-American nature.
There are at least 10,000 Marxists
teaching on American college
campuses, the Washington-based
group has stated. One professor
they have their eyes on is Political
Science Prof. Richard Fagen, ap
parently due to his opposition to the
Central American war.
Last week, AlA's executive
director came to Stanford to debate
civil liberties with Political Science
Prof. John Manley. The idea of
monitoring classes, the ALA repre
sentative insisted, is simply to
promote balanced viewpoints. To
defend the right of all sides to be

heard. In a word, to defend aca
demic freedom.
The representative also wanted
to meet with University President
Donald Kennedy over what he
called threats to academic freedom
at Stanford. One threat the visitor
dwelt on at length was antagonism
toward the Hoover Institution.
To get back to Davis, in October
1984, a group calling itself Students
for a Better America (SBA) held a
"Grenada Victory Rally" there. It
was to celebrate the U.S. invasion
of Grenada. "I'd love to kill a com
munist," the school paper quoted
one of the organizers as yelling.
SBA also distributed copies of
Freedom Fighter, a publication ur
ging U.S. military overthrow of the
Sandinistas. In exchange for $20,
the January-February issue offered
contributors brass casings from
rifle cartridges fired at
Nicaraguans.
"Quantities are limited,"
Freedom Fighter pitched, "so send
your donation soon!"
Then last spring, SBA attacked a
visiting lecturer, accusing him of
being an agent of Fidel Castro and
the Soviet Union. The target was
Marxist filmmaker Saul Landau,

who teaches history at UC-Santa
Cruz. Outside Landau's classes in
Davis, small knots of students gath
ered with placards denouncing him
as a communist. Inviting Landau to
Davis, SBA declared, was like wel
coming Nazi propagandist Joseph
Goebbels.
When the administration at Davis
failed to comply with SBA's demand
— to apologize for Landau's visit
and make sure that such a thing
never happened again — a state
legislator's office got into the act.
The Landau matter might have to
be raised when the legislature takes
up the University of California
budget.
Who are these guys? SBA's office
in Washington is at the same ad
dress as the Heritage Foundation,
the architect of operations against
liberal institutions such as the Legal
Services Corporation and the Na
tional Endowment for the
Humanities. As for SBA, it appears
to be a sort of campus farm club for
the New Right, to identify for
promotion to Washington young
men who show promise at attacking
liberals.
Supervising SBA's activities in
Davis was a member of the College
Republicans named Les Csorba. No

one ever questioned the sincerity of
this intense young man. In a what-I
did-on-my-summer-vacation story
for the paper, Les told how he had
gone down to El Salvador on some
kind of exchange program with the
Atlacatl Battalion. Now, defending
his attacks on Landau, he appealed
to the memory of his grandfather,
who he said was shot by a Soviet
colonel during the 1956 uprising in
Hungary.
But no doubt about it, Les was
going places. Soon the right wing
press was lauding his exploits at
Davis, then we heard something
about a new job in Washington. It
was with some kind of watchdog
outfit, run by some of the same
people who finance and direct SBA
and the Heritage Foundation.
So it is with real pleasure that,
last week, I saw Csorba appear at
Stanford as the executive director
of Accuracy in Academia. It gives a
person real faith in America to
know that, in just one semester, a
Red baiter can turn into a civil liber
tarian and champion of academic
freedom.

Science Prof. Richard Fagen, ap
parently due to his opposition to the
Central American war.
Last week, AlA's executive
director came to Stanford to debate
civil liberties with Political Science
Prof. John Manley. The idea of
monitoring classes, the ALA repre
sentative insisted, is simply to
promote balanced viewpoints. To
defend the right of all sides to be

heard. In a word, to defend aca
demic freedom.
The representative also wanted
to meet with University President
Donald Kennedy over what he
called threats to academic freedom
at Stanford. One threat the visitor
dwelt on at length was antagonism
toward the Hoover Institution.
To get back to Davis, in October
1984, a group calling itself Students
for a Better America (SBA) held a
"Grenada Victory Rally" there. It
was to celebrate the U.S. invasion
of Grenada. "I'd love to kill a com
munist," the school paper quoted
one of the organizers as yelling.
SBA also distributed copies of
Freedom Fighter, a publication ur
ging U.S. military overthrow of the
Sandinistas. In exchange for $20,
the January-February issue offered
contributors brass casings from
rifle cartridges fired at
Nicaraguans.
"Quantities are limited,"
Freedom Fighter pitched, "so send
your donation soon!"
Then last spring, SBA attacked a
visiting lecturer, accusing him of
being an agent of Fidel Castro and
the Soviet Union. The target was
Marxist filmmaker Saul Landau,

who teaches history at UC-Santa
Cruz. Outside Landau's classes in
Davis, small knots of students gath
ered with placards denouncing him
as a communist. Inviting Landau to
Davis, SBA declared, was like wel
coming Nazi propagandist Joseph
Goebbels.
When the administration at Davis
failed to comply with SBA's demand
— to apologize for Landau's visit
and make sure that such a thing
never happened again — a state
legislator's office got into the act.
The Landau matter might have to
be raised when the legislature takes
up the University of California
budget.
Who are these guys? SBA's office
in Washington is at the same ad
dress as the Heritage Foundation,
the architect of operations against
liberal institutions such as the Legal
Services Corporation and the Na
tional Endowment for the
Humanities. As for SBA, it appears
to be a sort of campus farm club for
the New Right, to identify for
promotion to Washington young
men who show promise at attacking
liberals.
Supervising SBA's activities in
Davis was a member of the College
Republicans named Les Csorba. No

one ever questioned the sincerity of
this intense young man. In a what-I
did-on-my-summer-vacation story
for the paper, Les told how he had
gone down to El Salvador on some
kind of exchange program with the
Atlacatl Battalion. Now, defending
his attacks on Landau, he appealed
to the memory of his grandfather,
who he said was shot by a Soviet
colonel during the 1956 uprising in
Hungary.
But no doubt about it, Les was
going places. Soon the right wing
press was lauding his exploits at
Davis, then we heard something
about a new job in Washington. It
was with some kind of watchdog
outfit, run by some of the same
people who finance and direct SBA
and the Heritage Foundation.
So it is with real pleasure that,
last week, I saw Csorba appear at
Stanford as the executive director
of Accuracy in Academia. It gives a
person real faith in America to
know that, in just one semester, a
Red baiter can turn into a civil liber
tarian and champion of academic
freedom.
