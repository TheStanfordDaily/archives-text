Don't Persecute
The Individual
Last week I almost sent a letter
to The Daily regarding Black Stu
dent Union member David Troutt's
comment that the University's
acceptance (recruitment?) of a
South African runner, James Al
borough, "violates, in principle, an
international agreement barring
South African athletes from com
peting in sanctioned events." But
my good friend and teammate,
James, convinced me not to. He
said, "Let it die." The problem is
that James may die first — from
old age — before he is left alone.
I'm not writing this because I am
in favor of apartheid. Frankly, I
don't know enough of the relevant
facts to have an opinion. What I am
protesting is the constant harass
ment James has had to put up with
since he first set foot on sacred
Stanford turf.
On Nov. 14, The Daily printed
an addition to Troutt's previous
statement. Troutt followed up by
saying, "We are not protesting the
individual — he's not a spokesper
son for South Africa." That's an
intelligent thought. Why not follow
up on it? If David Troutt is not
protesting the individual, why is
Alborough's name constantly being
brought up by him and The Daily?
Wouldn't it suffice to leave Al
borough as "a Stanford student?"
It's not like he has nothing else to
think about.
Think back to when you were a
freshman. Remember how nervous
you were leaving home, taking
your first midterm, your first final?
Add to that the pressure of being a
collegiate athlete, particularly a
scholarship athlete, entering a
championship season trying to help
your team win a national title. Now
remember how good it felt
knowing that you were going home
soon to forget about life for a while.
Well, James isn't going home for
Thanksgiving, or for Christmas, or
for spring break. He's 8,000 miles
away from home, and he won't be
back there until summer. So give

the guy a break. Since it's sup- \
posedly not him people are pro- ;
testing, why not leave his name •
out of it and let him live a normal-*
crazy life to which every freshman
— regardless of race, religion or *
hair color — should be entitled. ;
And I hope The Daily will take •
extra care in the future to edit the
near-slanderous statements which*
have frequented its pages lately. I
This should be the primary con- *
cern of any self-respecting news- •
paper. Actually, different news •
altogether would be a welcome I
change. After all, it would seem tO
me that officials who will bar a *
South African from collegiate com
petition would be more worthy of
front page headlines than officials.,
who won't.

Break All Ties To
Apartheid System
While members of Stanford Out
of South Africa applaud the efforts
by the University administration to
try to play a more active role in the
movement against apartheid in
South Africa, we find a recent
statement by the University dis
turbing.
The University announced that it
is establishing closer ties with the
White University of Cape Town
and the Colored University of the
Western Cape. We see neither a
need nor a justification for Stanford
University to establish institutional
ties with the segregated institu
tions created by the apartheid . _
government, and we strongly con
demn it.
Although some individuals atX
these particular institutions are ; -
committed to the struggle against
apartheid, it is Stanford's policy;';
toward these institutions that must
exemplify our condemnation of v
apartheid. We call on the adminis
tration to break Stanford's ties X
with all institutions of the racist;'
apartheid system.
