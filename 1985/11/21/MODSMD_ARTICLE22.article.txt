Livin' With Roaches
Mohammed Ali didn't want you livin' with roaches,
and neither does the University of Louisville.
Seems students at Louisville are living with roaches
on a full-time sort of basis nowadays.
A Louisville Delta Upsilon brother woke up and
found the crispy critters in his bed.
"That's when I put the Roach Motels out. I haven't
had many problems since then. I thought about moving
out, but I didn't know they would work so well," he
said.
School's Out For Summer
At Michigan, folks are doing what they can to crack
down on "disruptive and unbecoming" behavior at the
school's graduation ceremonies.
Administrators say that students have been sneak
ing too much hooch into the ceremonies recently, re
sulting in something less than the decorum the event
might demand.
No firm plans are set yet, but students may be
searched before heading into the ceremonies.

In Berkeley, War
There's war in Berkeley.
A pizza war.
The combatants are Fat Slice, Empire State Pizza
and Blondie's, our favorite.
Empire State flooded the area with discount
coupons, and Blondie's responded with an offer to ac
cept all pizza joints' coupons as if they were its own.
Fat Slice immediately joined in that offer.
Empire State, of course, has that New-York-pizza
is-the-best-pizza-and-this-stuff-you-guys-call-pizza-
out-here-really-sucks attitude so common among mis
guided former New Yorkers.
The Daily Californian, that weenie thing across the
Bay, hasn't made a decision on the winner. The only
relevant comment from the crew there? "Both
Blondie's and Fat Slice employ a staff made up largely
of young people, frequently sporting pointedly modern
haircuts."
And that is, after all, what really matters.
