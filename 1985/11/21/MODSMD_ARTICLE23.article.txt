# Congress Cuts College Funds
## 
### 
The House Education and Labor
Committee last week approved an
extension of the Higher Education
Act of 1965 that would cut $1 billion
from the amount now authorized to
be spent annually on higher educa
tion programs, according to The
Chronicle of Higher Education.

Ceilings have been placed on
most higher education programs to
bring them in line with what
Congress has actually appropriated
in recent years.
A maximum of $10.8 billion
would be allotted in the academic
year 1987-88 for dozens of pro
grams providing aid to students and
their schools, while Congress ap
propriated only $9.3 billion for the
programs for the current academic
year.
The bill approved by the commit
tee would have these ramifications:

• Authorization of $3.18 billion for
the Guaranteed Student Loan pro
gram for academic year 1987-88, an
amount approximately $90 million
less than Congress authorized for
1986-87. The measure would in
crease the funds that students
could borrow, but it would also
reduce federal spending by requir
ing all students to show substantial
proof of need and by improving the
collection of repayments.
• Increase the spending authority
for Pell Grants. Under the bill, $4.5
billion, which is about $90 million
more than before, would be author
ized for Pell Grants in the academic
year 1986-87. The increase would
set the maximum grant at $2,300,
or 60 percent of a student's college
cost, whichever is less. Currently,
students may receive up to $2,100,
or 60 percent of their costs.
• Establish a spending ceiling of
$3.1 billion for all other higher edu
cation programs in the academic

year 1987-88. Such programs
would include funds for teacher
education, construction of facilities,
library resources and counseling
and recruitment programs for dis
advantaged students. The ceiling
represents a $1 billion reduction in
the amount authorized for the aca
demic year 1986-87.
• Create a small number of new
programs in such areas as graduate
education, adult education, teacher
training and assistance to black col
leges.
The bill, HR3700, which extends
the higher education programs
through the academic year 1991-
92, passed by a vote of 28-2.
Rep. Steve Bartlett (R-Texas)
and Rep. Richard Armey (R-Texas)
voted against the measure, arguing
that the bill still authorized too
much spending.
The measure is expected to be
considered by the full House within
the next month.
