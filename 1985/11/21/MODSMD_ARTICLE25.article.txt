# West Bay Opera's 'Pagliacci' Sizzles of Passion and Intrigue
## 
### EUGENE ROBINSON 
The West Bay Opera's recent production of
"Pagliacci" struck with the flash and bang of a
fireworks display, only marginally undermined by an
occasional dud.
The opera "Pagliacci," by Ruggiero Leoncavallo,
sets the mind aflame through its chronicling of a double
murder that is sparked by the corrosive influences of
jealousy and obsession. The work centers around a
troupe of traveling comedians: their leader Canio; his
wife Nedda; Tonio, the hunchback; Beppe, another
member of the troupe; and Silvio, a villager and
Nedda's lover.
In Canio's absence, Tonio amorously attends Nedda,
but she rejects him unequivocally. Tonio vows ven
geance, and when he spies Nedda and Silvio making
plans to run away together, he hastily summons her
husband. Canio arrives, but fails to identify the fleeing
Silvio. Enraged by Nedda's refusal to divulge her
lover's name, he attempts to stab her, but is suddenly
calmed, reminded that preparation for the troupe's cur
rent production must go on. Breaking down, and worn
out by frustration, passion and jealousy, Canio sings
the heart-wrenching aria, "Vesti la giubba."

In the second act, the villagers arrive for the
troupe's performance. The play's opening scene has
the comedians performing roles that mirror their own
lives. Canio, who performs the role of the jealous
Pagliacci, attempts to discover Columbina/Nedda's
lover. Canio no longer distinguishes between the ar
tifice and the reality, first stabbing Nedda, and then Sil
vio, who had come to her rescue. Swinging directly to
the audience, Canio exclaims, "The comedy is ended!"
Macatee Hollie, in his first appearance with the West
Bay Opera, delivers a well-crafted performance as
Tonio. Tonio is expressively full, and Hollies treat
ment avoids the more obvious characterizations that
could accompany this role.
Other bright spots were Warren Rothman as Beppe,
a lesser role, but equally as enjoyable.
Rachelle Perry, as Nedda, sang beautifully but with
out passion. The dispassionate delivery was a problem
that seemed to affect the rest of the cast.
As Canio, Keith Purdy allowed his staginess to
denude his role of its potential power. In order to
believe "Pagliacci," we must believe Canio. The
portrayal and understanding of the impulse that would
drive one to jealous murder is essential to sustain a
belief in the opera, and Purdy only partially succeeded
toward this end.


Rachelle Perry (Nedda), Keith Purdy (Canio) and Macatee Hollie (Tonio) appear in West Bay
Opera's production of the suspenseful "Pagliacci."
