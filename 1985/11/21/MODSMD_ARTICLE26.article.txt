# Church of the Sub Genius Indoctrinates Through Weird Humor
## 
### LAWRENCE NADLER 
Walking into The Church of the
Sub Genius 1985 West Coast
Atomic Seance and Devival
meeting, held at The Stone in San
Francisco last week, you couldn't
help but feel that you had walked
into a land full of outcasts.
The Church of the Sub Genius by
its very raison d'etre attracts those
who consider themselves to be
defined by any or all of the 55
synonyms for "weird" in Roget's
Collegiate Thesaurus. The
Church's many self-descriptions
range from"the world's only inher
ently bogus religion" (the term
"subgenius" itself is certainly
meaningless), to "the ultimate per
formance art."
Developed in the early 70s in
Dallas by, among others, a failed
science fiction writer named Ivan
Stang, the Bay Area stronghold
now broadcasts an outlandish call-in
radio show from Berkeley public
radio and helps put out an endless
supply of merchandise and
literature, including the epic 200-
page manifesto, "The Book of the
Sub Genius: Lunatic Prophecies for
the Coming Weird Times."
In a very small nutshell, the
Church promises "thrills, chills, sex
and success in business" to its fol
lowers (and especially donors) who
follow the example of one of its
most important "short-duration
personal saviors," J.R. "Bob"
Dobbs. Blessed with mystic sales

ability, pipe-puffing "Bob" is the in
spiration in the perpetual life
struggle against the insidious con
spiracy of normalcy, the conquest
of which can restore lost psychic
abilities such as time control.
Not to mention the fact that the
Sub Geniuses will save the world
from being sold over to the Men
From Planet X, who are prophesied
to invade earth on "X-Day," July 5,
1998, (Americans will be especially
vulnerable because they'll all be suf
fering from hangovers). Even this
basic outline of church doctrine
smacks of the hard-edged acknowl
edgment of reality that lies behind
the most thought-provoking sci

ence fiction and the most biting
humor.
The best Sub Genius material
exposes with amazing precision the
way social and personal ideals and
values are shaped and manipulated
by external forces, whether they be
the mass media, religion or political
systems. The sci-fi and absurd
humor, by pushing supposed no
tions of universal cause and effect
to extremes and irreverently
making hamburger of a vast breadth
of cultural norms and even scientific
knowledge, effectively points up
the danger of faith in false idols —
whether it be the Moral Majority or
Nestle's Crunch Bars.

Last week s "devival" (as
opposed to revival) was less consis
tently impressive than the printed
material, but then it was a
showcase for a wide display of tal
ents. Being a religious revival in
spirit, it also depended heavily on
the enthusiasm of the crowd, which
was oddly lacking.
The audience seemed truly
engrossed in the intonation of the
sacred mantra of "Mmmmoe . . .
Larry . . . Curly," and chanted
"Hate! Hate!" with an Orwellian
gusto as the "conspiracy-planted
sin-chrometer" was snatched from
an audience volunteer's wrist and
destroyed. The audience also

cheered encouragingly as Saint
Janor Hypercleats delivered a
rousing improvisational rant and
sang his fiery "Gosp-hell hymns."
The traditional "Launching of the
Bloodied Head of Arnold Palmer"
from the stage with a golf club (and
subsequent miraculous healing)
drew a response, but by the time
the infamous ensemble, "The Band
That Dare Not Speak Its Name,"
took the stage, few audience mem
bers responded with the abandoned
frenzy that the band's dreaded dis
sonant strains aimed to induce.
Perhaps the crowd became
despairing as Pastor Buck Naked
pointed out that "slack for two

thirds of the world was a good
meall" or when Rev. Doctor Doctor
David N. Meyer II explained the in
sidious subconscious manipulation
of "high-concept advertising," using
Levi's 501 jeans as a potent exam
ple. The final damper might have
been his detailed argument that the
spirit of the '60s can't come back'
because of the watering-down or
complete disappearance of what;
delineated that legendary decade of
change: brains, drugs, sex and
politics.
Punctuated by a choir of mutant!
flower children who sang cha-cha;
versions of Jefferson Airplane's;
"White Rabbit" and Donovan's
"Season of the Witch," Meyer'
drove home the same message!
John Lennon declared after the;
Beatles breakup: "The dream is;
over." His point was that even faith
in "the spirit of the '60s" is a
reliance on an external abstraction,;
not an inner fire.
The comfort that comes with
conformity is a powerful protection*
against personal insecurity, and this
spirit of maturity seemed to afflict
the San Francisco crowd. If such
rituals as the Sub Geniuses supply
were to succeed as a true "gut
blow-out" (translation: cathartic
release of existential frustration),
they could be a truly important ar
tistic/cultural event, perhaps be
coming as synonomous with the
Bay Area as Rice-a-Roni.

conformity is a powerful protection*

Walking into The Church of the
Sub Genius 1985 West Coast
Atomic Seance and Devival
meeting, held at The Stone in San
Francisco last week, you couldn't
help but feel that you had walked
into a land full of outcasts.
The Church of the Sub Genius by
its very raison d'etre attracts those
who consider themselves to be
defined by any or all of the 55
synonyms for "weird" in Roget's
Collegiate Thesaurus. The
Church's many self-descriptions
range from"the world's only inher
ently bogus religion" (the term
"subgenius" itself is certainly
meaningless), to "the ultimate per
formance art."
Developed in the early 70s in
Dallas by, among others, a failed
science fiction writer named Ivan
Stang, the Bay Area stronghold
now broadcasts an outlandish call-in
radio show from Berkeley public
radio and helps put out an endless
supply of merchandise and
literature, including the epic 200-
page manifesto, "The Book of the
Sub Genius: Lunatic Prophecies for
the Coming Weird Times."
In a very small nutshell, the
Church promises "thrills, chills, sex
and success in business" to its fol
lowers (and especially donors) who
follow the example of one of its
most important "short-duration
personal saviors," J.R. "Bob"
Dobbs. Blessed with mystic sales

ability, pipe-puffing "Bob" is the in
spiration in the perpetual life
struggle against the insidious con
spiracy of normalcy, the conquest
of which can restore lost psychic
abilities such as time control.
Not to mention the fact that the
Sub Geniuses will save the world
from being sold over to the Men
From Planet X, who are prophesied
to invade earth on "X-Day," July 5,
1998, (Americans will be especially
vulnerable because they'll all be suf
fering from hangovers). Even this
basic outline of church doctrine
smacks of the hard-edged acknowl
edgment of reality that lies behind
the most thought-provoking sci

ence fiction and the most biting
humor.
The best Sub Genius material
exposes with amazing precision the
way social and personal ideals and
values are shaped and manipulated
by external forces, whether they be
the mass media, religion or political
systems. The sci-fi and absurd
humor, by pushing supposed no
tions of universal cause and effect
to extremes and irreverently
making hamburger of a vast breadth
of cultural norms and even scientific
knowledge, effectively points up
the danger of faith in false idols —
whether it be the Moral Majority or
Nestle's Crunch Bars.

Last week s "devival" (as
opposed to revival) was less consis
tently impressive than the printed
material, but then it was a
showcase for a wide display of tal
ents. Being a religious revival in
spirit, it also depended heavily on
the enthusiasm of the crowd, which
was oddly lacking.
The audience seemed truly
engrossed in the intonation of the
sacred mantra of "Mmmmoe . . .
Larry . . . Curly," and chanted
"Hate! Hate!" with an Orwellian
gusto as the "conspiracy-planted
sin-chrometer" was snatched from
an audience volunteer's wrist and
destroyed. The audience also

cheered encouragingly as Saint
Janor Hypercleats delivered a
rousing improvisational rant and
sang his fiery "Gosp-hell hymns."
The traditional "Launching of the
Bloodied Head of Arnold Palmer"
from the stage with a golf club (and
subsequent miraculous healing)
drew a response, but by the time
the infamous ensemble, "The Band
That Dare Not Speak Its Name,"
took the stage, few audience mem
bers responded with the abandoned
frenzy that the band's dreaded dis
sonant strains aimed to induce.
Perhaps the crowd became
despairing as Pastor Buck Naked
pointed out that "slack for two

thirds of the world was a good
meall" or when Rev. Doctor Doctor
David N. Meyer II explained the in
sidious subconscious manipulation
of "high-concept advertising," using
Levi's 501 jeans as a potent exam
ple. The final damper might have
been his detailed argument that the
spirit of the '60s can't come back'
because of the watering-down or
complete disappearance of what;
delineated that legendary decade of
change: brains, drugs, sex and
politics.
