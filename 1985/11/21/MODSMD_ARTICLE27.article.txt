# Savoyards' 'Patience' Is a Virtue
## 
### MARK TOMPKINS Staff writer 
The Stanford Savoyards are back
with yet another of their ever
popular Gilbert and Sullivan produc
tions. "Patience" is an excellent ex
ample of why Gilbert and Sullivan
musicals are still successful 100
years after they were first staged in
London. Despite the fact that many
of its jokes and references are now
dated, "Patience" is a highly enter
taining production.
"Patience, or Bunthorne's Bride"
a broad satire on the aesthetic
movement in art and literature of
the late 19th century. Basically, the
tenets of aestheticism held that
beauty was to be valued above all
Qther things; art was the highest
aim of life, and man should surround
himself with beautiful things so that
His own emotions might become
refined.
Historically, aestheticism was a
comparatively minor movement in
the arts; while it did spread to the
Continent and, in a limited way,
America, its big names all came
from England. Art critics such as
John Ruskin, the pre-Raphaelite
painters, and poets such as Alger
non Swinburne gave the movement
its philosophy in the mid-19th cen
tury. In the 1880 sand '90s, the
aesthetic tradition was continued,
in a more exaggerated and flam
boyant style, by Oscar Wilde and
his circle of followers.

In his speech, writing and man
ner of dress, Wilde pursued a policy
of relentless self-promotion, turn
ing himself into the high priest of
aestheticism. He was also respon
sible for icoming the movement,
for when he was imprisoned for his
homosexuality in 1895, aes
theticism became linked with
decadence in the public mind and
fell into widespread disfavor.
In April 1881, W.S. Gilbert and
Arthur Sullivan opened "Patience"
in London, and it was widely
assumed that the principal charac
ter, the aesthetic poet Reginald
Bunthorne, was a composite
parody of Wilde and Swinburne.
Wilde, in fact, made sure to be seen
at an early performance and quickly
identified himself with the role of
Bunthorne.
The preceding history lesson
should not deter anyone from
seeing the Savoyards' "Patience"
for fear that they won't get the
jokes or understand what is being
satirized. Gilbert and Sullivan's sole
aim was to entertain, and they took
care to ensure that their jokes
would be funny to everyone. In any
case, their characters are so
broadly comic that it's impossible
not to laugh at them.
Consider Bunthorne for instance,
played to preening perfection by Ed
Glazier. Bunthorne minces around
the stage in an absurdly effete man
ner, and his poetry readings are
hilariously pompous. Like Wilde, he
is passionate about lilies and

sprinkles his quotations with refer
ences to Greek antiquity; his purple
clothing even recalls Wilde's famous
purple velvet knee-breeches. But
Bunthorne is no aesthetic at all, we
learn, and has simply affected the
pose to gain the adoration of
women. Glazier delivers this
confession superbly, and the audi
ence begins to admire Bunthorne as
the perfect scoundrel.
And then there is Archibald
Grosevnor (Adam Schwarz), an
other poet and Bunthorne's rival for
the aesthetic throne. Grosevnor is
the ultimate fop, constantly brush
ing his golden locks and admiring
himself in a mirror. But like Bun
thorne, Grosevnor is not quite the
dandy he affects to be, and in the
play's climax he renounces aes
theticism to become a "common
young man." At this point Schwarz
suddenly gives his character an out
rageous Cockney accent — to great
comic effect.
Julia Jepsen, Karen Huyser and
Elizabeth Oana all give able support
as three of the "rapturous maidens"
who long for Bunthorne, but it is
Kay Arnaudo as the hefty Lady Jane
who steals every scene in which the
maidens appear. At the opening of
the second act, there's a brief bit of
comedy where Lady Jane struggles
to play the cello, alas without any
success; it's an immensely funny,
winning moment.
The major players are ably
rounded out by Theresa Ringgold
as Patience, the simpering dairy

maid coveted by both poets, and by
Paul Whitmer, Bill Rehor and Tyler
Ochoa as three Officers of the
Dragoon Guards. The Guards were
once the lovers of the maidens, but
now the girls swear allegiance to
Bunthorne and Grosevnor, to the
Guards' considerable dismay.
One of the musical's high points
comes when the three officers,
trying to win back the maidens'
love, turn themselves into aes
thetics; the less-than-convincing
results are memorably silly. And fi
nally, Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons has an amusing cameo ap
pearance as Bunthorne's solicitor
(Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions Jean Fetter will take over the
part this weekend).
The orchestra opens the produc
tion with a fine overture, and then
lends strong support to the cast all
evening. Also noteworthy are the
large flower designs on each side of
the stage; they neatly reinforce the
rather flowery sentiments voiced
by Bunthorne in his poetry. The
only complaint to be made about
this "Patience" is that some of the
lines are difficult to make out, par
ticularly in the cases of the Dragoon
Guards and Patience, the dairy
maid. As the speech of all the char
acters is loaded with jokes and ref
erences to various writers and ar
tists, it is important that all the lines
be clearly audible. Once this prob
lem is worked out, the Savoyards
will have a uniformly fine production
on their hands.

for fear that they won't get the
jokes or understand what is being
satirized. Gilbert and Sullivan's sole
aim was to entertain, and they took
care to ensure that their jokes
would be funny to everyone. In any
case, their characters are so
broadly comic that it's impossible
not to laugh at them.
Consider Bunthorne for instance,
played to preening perfection by Ed
Glazier. Bunthorne minces around
the stage in an absurdly effete man
ner, and his poetry readings are
hilariously pompous. Like Wilde, he
is passionate about lilies and

sprinkles his quotations with refer
ences to Greek antiquity; his purple
clothing even recalls Wilde's famous
purple velvet knee-breeches. But
Bunthorne is no aesthetic at all, we
learn, and has simply affected the
pose to gain the adoration of
women. Glazier delivers this
confession superbly, and the audi
ence begins to admire Bunthorne as
the perfect scoundrel.
And then there is Archibald
Grosevnor (Adam Schwarz), an
other poet and Bunthorne's rival for
the aesthetic throne. Grosevnor is
the ultimate fop, constantly brush
ing his golden locks and admiring
himself in a mirror. But like Bun
thorne, Grosevnor is not quite the
dandy he affects to be, and in the
play's climax he renounces aes
theticism to become a "common
young man." At this point Schwarz
suddenly gives his character an out
rageous Cockney accent — to great
comic effect.
Julia Jepsen, Karen Huyser and
Elizabeth Oana all give able support
as three of the "rapturous maidens"
who long for Bunthorne, but it is
Kay Arnaudo as the hefty Lady Jane
who steals every scene in which the
maidens appear. At the opening of
the second act, there's a brief bit of
comedy where Lady Jane struggles
to play the cello, alas without any
success; it's an immensely funny,
winning moment.
The major players are ably
rounded out by Theresa Ringgold
as Patience, the simpering dairy

maid coveted by both poets, and by
Paul Whitmer, Bill Rehor and Tyler
Ochoa as three Officers of the
Dragoon Guards. The Guards were
once the lovers of the maidens, but
now the girls swear allegiance to
Bunthorne and Grosevnor, to the
Guards' considerable dismay.
One of the musical's high points
comes when the three officers,
trying to win back the maidens'
love, turn themselves into aes
thetics; the less-than-convincing
results are memorably silly. And fi
nally, Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons has an amusing cameo ap
pearance as Bunthorne's solicitor
(Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions Jean Fetter will take over the
part this weekend).
The orchestra opens the produc
tion with a fine overture, and then
lends strong support to the cast all
evening. Also noteworthy are the
large flower designs on each side of
the stage; they neatly reinforce the
rather flowery sentiments voiced
by Bunthorne in his poetry. The
only complaint to be made about
this "Patience" is that some of the
lines are difficult to make out, par
ticularly in the cases of the Dragoon
Guards and Patience, the dairy
maid. As the speech of all the char
acters is loaded with jokes and ref
erences to various writers and ar
tists, it is important that all the lines
be clearly audible. Once this prob
lem is worked out, the Savoyards
will have a uniformly fine production
on their hands.

The show runs this weekend in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The Stanford Savoyards are back
with yet another of their ever
popular Gilbert and Sullivan produc
tions. "Patience" is an excellent ex
ample of why Gilbert and Sullivan
musicals are still successful 100
years after they were first staged in
London. Despite the fact that many
of its jokes and references are now
dated, "Patience" is a highly enter
taining production.
"Patience, or Bunthorne's Bride"
a broad satire on the aesthetic
movement in art and literature of
the late 19th century. Basically, the
tenets of aestheticism held that
beauty was to be valued above all
Qther things; art was the highest
aim of life, and man should surround
himself with beautiful things so that
His own emotions might become
refined.
Historically, aestheticism was a
comparatively minor movement in
the arts; while it did spread to the
Continent and, in a limited way,
America, its big names all came
from England. Art critics such as
John Ruskin, the pre-Raphaelite
painters, and poets such as Alger
non Swinburne gave the movement
its philosophy in the mid-19th cen
tury. In the 1880 sand '90s, the
aesthetic tradition was continued,
in a more exaggerated and flam
boyant style, by Oscar Wilde and
his circle of followers.

In his speech, writing and man
ner of dress, Wilde pursued a policy
of relentless self-promotion, turn
ing himself into the high priest of
aestheticism. He was also respon
sible for icoming the movement,
for when he was imprisoned for his
homosexuality in 1895, aes
theticism became linked with
decadence in the public mind and
fell into widespread disfavor.
In April 1881, W.S. Gilbert and
Arthur Sullivan opened "Patience"
in London, and it was widely
assumed that the principal charac
ter, the aesthetic poet Reginald
Bunthorne, was a composite
parody of Wilde and Swinburne.
Wilde, in fact, made sure to be seen
at an early performance and quickly
identified himself with the role of
Bunthorne.
The preceding history lesson
should not deter anyone from
seeing the Savoyards' "Patience"
for fear that they won't get the
jokes or understand what is being
satirized. Gilbert and Sullivan's sole
