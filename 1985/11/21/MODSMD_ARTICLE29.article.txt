# Hollywood Hurts 'That Was Then'
## 
### FELICIA WONG 
Sometimes it seems as if Hollywood is more interested in making
big money than in making quality movies, more concerned with box
office appeal than acting ability, and more interested in attracting the
teen market than maintaining a good story line. Unfortunately,
Christopher Cain's screen version of the S.E. Hinton novel, "That
Was Then . . . This Is Now," falls right into this Hollywood trap.
Cain combines teen idol Emilio Estevez, constant soundtrack-type
music and a story about the problems of today's youth and comes up
with a movie that is sufficiently entertaining but ultimately heavy
handed and formulaic.
The strength of Hinton's novel keeps the film from being
transparently mundane. The characters are all familiar: nice guy
Bryon (Craig Sheffer); tough guy Mark (Emilio Estevez); sweet
girlfriend Kathy (Kim Delaney); and sleazy girl Angela (Jill
Schoeper).
However, the characters don't always react to situations the way
one expects — the plot contains several wonderful twists and
details, thanks to Hinton's ability as a storyteller. For example, when
Mark wants revenge on Angela, he doesn't resort to the violence we
all expect. Instead, he cuts off her hair, which is a much more effec
tive form of humiliation than a black eye could ever be.
Little touches like this keep "That Was Then . . . This Is Now"
from sinking entirely. Unfortunately, they are not strong enough to
carry the entire film.
The filmmakers often suffer from overkill. The audience can infer
from the action that the relationship between best buddies Mark and
Bryon is strained. We don't need to be beaten over the head with a
five-minute, introspective monologue from Bryon, describing
"things changing" and "new things beginning." Not only does this
type of monologue slow the film down, but it also insults the intelli
gence of the audience.
Visual effects are also overused by the filmmakers. During Mark's
big revelation scene, he sits by a window, and it appears as if the rain
outside is actually rolling down his face. This is a nice image for a
while, showing us the internal pain of a tough guy who can't bring
himself to cry. However, after several minutes, the image becomes
incessant and finally annoying.
Mark's revelation speech itself is also moving, but becomes maud
lin when we are told, "I don't like it when people hurt me." Because
the audience has been shown this both through the action of the film
and in the monologue itself, the blunt statement seems unnecessary
and melodramatic.
The loud, soundtrack-style music of Keith Olson and Bill Cuomo is
not a help to the movie, but rather a hindrance. It sounds so generi
cally Top 40 that it adds banality rather than liveliness to the film. It's
a good thing the filmmakers relegated the title song to the film's
closing credits, because the song is so insipidly cheerful that one
suspects its composers knew nothing about the film's plot, charac
ters or theme.
If the filmmakers had stuck to Hinton's original work, "That Was
Then . . . This Is Now" would have been a really strong drama with
universal appeal. As it is, the movie's strongest parts are lifted al
most line-for-line or action-for-action from the novel. It seems that
Christopher Cain succumbed to Hollywood pressure for a box-office
sure thing. He doctored the film with heavy-handed, expository
monologues and a with generic 1980s teen-flick look, feel and sound
— elements that when combined, detract from the film's potential
power.
The film is also obviously a vehicle for Emilio Estevez, who, at
first glance, seems to be in the film merely to insure the film's mone
tary success. Surprisingly, Estevez turns out a fine performance as
troubled Mark. The rest of the actors, including Craig Sheffer and
Kim Delaney, are adequate, but Estevez manages to be tough, yet
convincingly and appropriately poignant. One of the film's best
scenes is a snippet in which Mark stands outside the supermarket
where his buddy Bryon works and draws a happy face on the plate
glass window.
"That Was Then . . . This Is Now" provides an evening's enter
tainment but is certainly not memorable. If you're a real Emilio Es
tevez fan, this film might be worth seeing. If not, you might as well
wait until it comes out in video cassette.

suspects its composers knew nothing about the film's plot, charac
ters or theme.
If the filmmakers had stuck to Hinton's original work, "That Was
Then . . . This Is Now" would have been a really strong drama with
universal appeal. As it is, the movie's strongest parts are lifted al
most line-for-line or action-for-action from the novel. It seems that
Christopher Cain succumbed to Hollywood pressure for a box-office
sure thing. He doctored the film with heavy-handed, expository
monologues and a with generic 1980s teen-flick look, feel and sound
— elements that when combined, detract from the film's potential
power.
The film is also obviously a vehicle for Emilio Estevez, who, at
first glance, seems to be in the film merely to insure the film's mone
tary success. Surprisingly, Estevez turns out a fine performance as
troubled Mark. The rest of the actors, including Craig Sheffer and
Kim Delaney, are adequate, but Estevez manages to be tough, yet
convincingly and appropriately poignant. One of the film's best
scenes is a snippet in which Mark stands outside the supermarket
where his buddy Bryon works and draws a happy face on the plate
glass window.
"That Was Then . . . This Is Now" provides an evening's enter
tainment but is certainly not memorable. If you're a real Emilio Es
tevez fan, this film might be worth seeing. If not, you might as well
wait until it comes out in video cassette.
