# Students Enter Pleas
## Tuesday hearing for 33 protesters 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
Six students arrested last month
for civil disobedience pleaded not
guilty*yesterday to charges of
trespassing, unlawful assembly and
refusal to disperse during their ar
raignment at Palo Alto Municipal
Court.
The six, graduate student Rick
Motamedi; seniors Mike Collins,
Ron Nassimov, Tony Tran and
Richard Walter; and junior Tim
Quirk, were among 33 students and
community members arrested on
Oct. 16 for sitting in at Old Union.
They were protesting both the Uni
versity's South Africa-related in
vestments and the alleged abuse of
Robby Perkins by police. Perkins, a
senior, was arrested in a similar
demonstration on Oct. 11.
Collins and Quirk are two of
three ASSU Council of Presidents
members who were arrested in last
month's protests.
Those arraigned yesterday must
appear Tuesday along with 27 other
Stanford protesters at a pre-trial
hearing scheduled for the same
courtroom.
On Monday, those 27, who were
arrested in protests on Oct. 14 and
16, all pleaded not guilty to identical
charges.
At the arraignment yesterday,
Judge Stephen Manley called all six
to the bench at about 10:30 a.m.
The protesters said that they
pleaded not guilty because they feel
they committed no crime in refus
ing to leave Old Union when the
building closed on the day of their
sit-in.
"1 dma't think 1 did anything

wrong. I didn't plan to damage any
thing or hurt anyone," Tran said.
"If we went to Old Union to save
people in a fire, we wouldn't be con
victed, and it's sort of the same
principle," Tran added, referring to
the situation in South Africa.
"I think it's ludicrous that Stan
ford University, bastion of philo
sophic freedom, would ever press
such charges," Collins said.
The protesters will now wait to
see what the district attorney has
to offer on Tuesday, according to
Collins, one of two defendants ar
raigned yesterday who met with a
public defender for a half hour fol
lowing the court session.
At the pre-trial hearing, the dis
trict attorney could offer to drop all
but one of the charges or to make a
bargain with the students if they en
ter a certain plea, Collins explained.
"It's possible that the charges
might be dropped, rearranged or
pressed all the way," Collins said.
Once the district attorney
presents his position at the pre-trial
hearing, the students will have the
option of accepting his offer or
pursuing the case in a jury trial, he
added.
According to Collins, the public
defender told Quirk that, in the
worst case, the students may "have
to serve jail time (on) weekends."
Collins added that the protesters
"can't tell at this time" whether
they would accept a favorable offer
from the district attorney.
Collins said that all of those who
have committed civil disobedience
this year will "undoubtedly" hold a
meeting before their next court ap
pearance to discuss their course of
action.
