The KZSU Picks corporate
supply-side, pre-Christmas,
greatest hits anthology deluge,
election-issue, inventory

more BMWs for their children at
use.
Depeche Mode — "Catching Up
With Depeche Mode"
$$$$$
It sure must have been depress
ing at Depeche Mode's record com
pany when the band made it big a
year after releasing a greatest hits
album, "People Are People." We all
learned in Econ 1 that anthologies
only make megabucks when the
band is well-known. But the guys at
Sire Records apparently audited
Econ 1 between the release of
"People Are People" and the
release of this, the band's second
"greatest hits" album in two years.
Actually, they managed to find in
teresting songs and off-hits, rather
than just chartbusters, and they
added not one, but four unreleased
tracks, three of which have hit po
tential: "Shake the Disease,"
"Flexible" and "It's Called a Heart."
The tracks proceed from earliest to
present-day, showing quite effec
tively the band's changes and im
provements over the years. It's a
truly quality-ridden approach to the
anthology format. And, best of all,

"Catching Up" is gonna redefine
platinum this season and put lotsa
spare change into those poor ex
ploited band members' pockets.

The Cars —
"Cars Greatest Hits"
★ ★
$$$$
Beware, mom 'n' dad. This al
bum is a record company execu
tive's retirement plan. It comes
complete with an extra single
which, for some reason, is un
available on any other album.
Hmmmmmmm. The record's most
redeeming function is as a study aid
in documenting the steady decline
of the group after its best and first
two albums, "The Cars" and
"Candy-O." The Cars' early, rough
edge was vastly superior to their
current smooth, technological side,
which seems limp by direct compar
ison. "Tonight She Comes," the al
bum's "future hit" single, doubt
lessly came into being while the
group was listening to its collected
works too long and decided to make
the ultimate amalgamation of Cars
ness. The rest of the album does a
good job of covering all of the
band's radio hits in the process. But
alas, strong songs like "Moving in
Stereo," "Candy-O," and
"Heartbeat City" are ignored. Why?
Because Elektra Records is releas

ing this record for those who don't
know any better. Well, folks, now
you know better. Caveat emptor.
Various (so-called) Artists —
"Television's Greatest Hits"
*★*
$$$3
First the good news. Side one is
chock full of original cartoon themes
that no self-respecting, American,
television-loving kid doesn't already
know by heart. There's no need to
rate these — listing them is
enough: "The Jetsons," "The
Flintstones," "Felix the Cat,"
"Casper the Friendly Ghost."

The listening-pleasure scale: from one to five stars, with five being the best
The predicted-profit scale: from one to five dollars — the more bucks the better
Selected cuts from these albums will be played on KZSU tomorrow at 6 p.m.

Enough already? Well, don't get
complacent yet. There are still
three sides to go, filled with themes
of live-action television shows from
the '50s and '60s. And it is here that
things take a nasty turn. For some
inexplicable reason, the good folks
at TeeVee Tunes (the Inc. that
compiled this here compilation)
decided that some of the original
versions weren't good enough for
us, and that it would be better to
(gasp) remake them. Maybe they
thought we wouldn't notice their
quasi-versions of "Gilligan's Is
land," "Star Trek" and "Twilight
Zone" — but we did. Maybe they

didn't think we'd mind that they
butchered "Hawaii Five-O" and
"The Ballad of Jed Clampett" — but
we do. The trade-off between
sound quality and artistic accuracy
just doesn't exist when things as sa
cred as TV theme songs come into
play. Therefore, at least half of the
double-album is wasted, and along
with the stupid commentary by Don
Pardo and the fact that nobody can
listen to 90 straight minutes of this
stuff, "Television's Greatest Hits"
ends up as valuable only to his
torians, radio stations and people
who hate their roommates.
Elvis Costello — "The Best
of Elvis Costello"
★ ★★★
$$
It isn't easy to be a true Elvis
Costello fanatic, for the simple rea
son that no one is rich enough to
buy a new record every nine
months. So in this case, we gotta
side with the record companies and
actually endorse the idea of an Elvis
Costello greatest hits album. The
record has 16 songs on it, plenty for
fans and non-fans alike, and total
length is even greater than 45
minutes — the only classy way to
prevent home taping. The album
seems pretty well divided between
chart hits and truly great songs, en
abling a fan to listen to the entire
record appreciating not only the kil
ler hits but the off-hits as well. A
good balance is also struck among
Costello's many different styles,
adding a degree of diversity not
present on his regular studio al
bums. Face it, we can't be funny in
this review because there's nothing
to poke fun at. They did it right. We

admit it. Record companies do oc
casionally get filled with Christmas
spirit. Parents of tasteful, non-Top
40 children should take note.
Elvis Presley — "Elvis'
Christmas Album"
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Let's not worry about whether
this is a good album, per se. Elvis
has already been canonized, and
there's no going back. This particu
lar Elvisthing comes with a fold-out
color poster section in the middle, a
greeting from the King himself,
clear green vinyl and 12 Elvis-ized
Christmas melodies that'll either
make you cry, laugh out loud or
take the record back. The arrange
ments and instruments are very
definitely dated, and Elvis' intona
tions take you back to every 60-
second "K-Tel" commercial you
ever saw on independent daytime
TV. The "ooooooo" background
singers, rhythm and blues in
fluences and occasional church or
gan would be laughable in any
modern context. But surprisingly
enough, this record isn't nearly &s
preposterous as one might think.
After all, comparing this to the
usual Tony Orlando "Christmas
With Dawn"-style collection sobers
you up right quick. "Elvis'
Christmas Album" may be most
value for novelty purposes, but
there is something legitimate way
down there. Kids with Nashville
parents should think about this one.
And remember, someday your
kids'll be laughing at your music,
too.
