## A 						pre-season meet today A 						Bear Battle Is Set For Card Swimmers 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
It isn't official, but it's highly
likely that neither the UC-Berkeley
men's swimming team nor the Stan
ford squad will be taking this after
noon's pre-season meet lightly.
The 1 p.m. long-course meet, to
be held in the 50-meter pool at
Stanford's DeGuerre Pool, will be
the second competition of the
season for the Cardinal and the first
of the season for the Bears.
Cardinal Coach Skip Kenney will
be taking the competition as
seriously as he would one that
really counted. And he expects the
Stanford swimmers to do the same.
The only difference between this
and a regular season meet is that it
will be held in the long-course for
mat, and there will be no official
timing done. In addition, the swim
mers will not be jumping off of
starting blocks.
"We swim our best lineup," Ken
ney said. "These people who have
been swimming want to find out
where they are in their training."
Kenney said the meet was estab
lished for two reasons. "Number
one, to get some early season com
petition, and number two, to take
advantage of the Big Gaine/Cal-
Stanford hoopla."
Kenney thinks the "hoopla" could
get the swimmers up to swim their

best times of the season. "We've
been training slow," Kenney
confessed. "We swam better
(against Texas) than we trained."
Because of the team's success
against the Longhorns Friday, Ken
ney is not concerned with slow
practice times. Who could be con
cerned? The No. 1 Cardinal looked
like it was swimming in peak form,
as it whipped No. 3 Texas.
The meet ended with Stanford on
top 77-36, having won 10 of 13
events. This came even though two
top team members, Pablo Morales
and Jeff Kostoff, were compet
ing with the water polo and cross
country teams, respectively.
Neither the water polo team nor
the cross-country team has a com
petition tomorrow, yet with both
seasons still going strong, Kenney
does not know whether or not the
two Olympians will be swimming.
California, ranked No. 5 in the
nation, has a few world-class swim
mers of its own. One of them, Matt
Biondi, may also be absent from
this afternoon's meet. Biondi, one
of the world's best freestylers, is an
All-American in water polo during
his free time. Though there is a
possibility that he will compete, it is
unlikely with the "Big Splash" be
tween Stanford and Cal only three
days away.

Coach Skip Kenney is hoping he will do it again today against
Cal. Gavin took second in the 1,000 and 500 freestyle events
swimmers to forget about, accord
ing to Kenney, is the weather. The
water in DeGuerre's heated pools
is fine, but once you're out of the
pool, it is a little cold to be wearing
just a swimsuit.
Kenney said the cold means

slower times, but pointed out that
with a little "mental toughness," it
should be no problem for Stanford.
The Texas swimmers could not
handle the cold, according to Ken
ney and Longhorn Coach Eddie
Reese. The Bears, though, are
familiar with this climate and should
not find it difficult to overcome.
"They'll still say it's colder here
(than in Berkeley)," Kenney said.
