# Just One Last Time
## Scholar-athlete Matt Soderlund's final game 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
He doesn't look like a graduate student.
Especially when he's crouched behind the Stanford
defensive line, all six feet, three inches and 223 pounds
of him, watching the quarterback call the signals and
getting ready to explode into the ball carrier coming
through the line. Guys studying for a master's degree
usually spend their Saturday afternoons in Green Li
brary, not out in the middle of Stanford Stadium.
Matt Soderlund is different. He is that rare figure in
college athletics — a star of a major sport and a very
serious student. He came back for a fifth year on the
Farm for two reasons: to start at inside linebacker and
to work toward a master's degree at the Food Re
search Institute.
After last season, when he finished second on the
team with 104 total tackles, he was named a Second
Team Academic All-American. And considering the
stats he has rung up so far this year — a team-leading
127 tackles — and his academic status, he's got a good
shot at being voted to the first team this time around.
"It would be nice," said Soderlund, who completed
his undergraduate requirements in June, finishing with
a 3.31 GPA in human biology. "It's rewarding to be
recognized for working hard off the football field, for
doing what we're supposed to be doing."
On the football field, Soderlund has been just as
diligent as in the classroom. He has started every
Cardinal football game since the 1982 opener — 43
games of hard hitting on the line and in the open field.
And only once has the ironman streak been in doubt.
"In my junior year, before the Oregon State game, I
sprained an ankle on Wednesday," Soderlund said. "I
couldn't run on Friday, but I still started on Saturday.

That was the only real close one. I've had a lot of luck
with injuries."
In that four-year stretch, which will reach an end
when he makes his 44th and final start Saturday against
UC-Berkeley, Soderlund has totaled 382 tackles. Be
cause of his solid performance, and because he has
called the defensive signals in the huddle for the last
two years, he agrees that he is a leader of the 1985 de
fensive squad.
