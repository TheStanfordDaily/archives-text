He is the only man on the team who has started for

"This has been my best year so far," he said. "I've

Soderlund is one of four fifth-year
seniors on the team, along with of
fensive tackle John Barns, quarter

back Fred Buckley and linebacker
Jack Gilmete. All will end their
Stanford careers Saturday without
ever having played for a winning
