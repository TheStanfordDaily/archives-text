# Big Game Could Still Help Bad Year
## 
### 
It is fitting that the college foot
ball season here is ending this week
— winter has descended.
The rain yesterday was annoy
ing, not heavy enough for
windshield wipers, not light enough
to ignore. The clouds were low
enough to fill the valley of the San
Andreas Fault and almost touch the
reservoirs that line Interstate 280.
It's basketball season in North
ern California. The rain has come,
the chill is here to stay, and indoors
is the logical place to cheer on the
home team.
The Stanford football team has
struggled to a 3-7 season that has
seemed almost as gray as the sky
obscuring the sunshine that is sure
to reappear. Likewise, winning
football will reappear on the Farm
sometime soon.
But 1985 is not the year for that.
This season is the fifth straight that
Stanford has lost more games than
it has won. This university has
fielded teams since 1892; never
have there been five consecutive
losing seasons. Should the Cardinal
win Saturday, a 4-7 year might

kindly be described as mediocre;
should it lose, a 3-8 year might
kindly be called poor.
For some teams with whom the
hope of a conference championship
hinges on the phrase, "Wait 'til next
year," the final game is a chance to
end that hope for an archrival. It's a

chance to gain some measure of
satisfaction from contributing to a
hated team's misery just as the
entire season has contributed to
your own misery.
That is not the case for Stanford.
California is 4-6, itself on the verge
of achieving mediocrity. The game
will have a bearing on the final
Pacific 10 Conference standings —
eighth place remains up for grabs

— but on nothing else of impor
tance.
Saturday is the final game of a
forgettable season for two second
division football teams on a rain
slicked road to obscurity, far from
Pasadena. It is important to the
players, but then any college foot
ball game is important to college
football players. But does it matter
to anyone else?
As one drives up 1-280, two
splotches of red paint provide an af
firmative answer. There is a sign on
a mountain that reads "SOUTH
SAN FRANCISCO/THK INDUS
TRIAL CITY." The first Sand U
stand out of the unceasing mist be
cause of the coating of cardinal paint
applied by a Stanford booster.
Then there was the sight atop
Nob Hill of two poorly attired
marching bands swarming into the
Fairmount Hotel. Granted, the
Fairmount is a place one wears a
jacket and tie, but a red jacket and
five-tone tie isn't exactly the idea.
And inside the Grand Ballroom of

win. The two exchanged pleasantries again at yesterdays Guardsmen Big Game Luncheon in
San Francisco.

the Fairmount, with four grand
crystal chandeliers overhead and
everything just so, several hundred
of the leading professionals in the
Bay Area gathered for lunch,
brought together by an occasion
this week that can still be called Big
Game.
The Guardsmen are 150 young
professionals from around the Bay
Area who raise funds to send needy
children to summer camps and the
like. They and their guests weren't
at the Fairmount just to eat — they
were there to be a part of what sur
rounds this week's football game.
The two bands played during
lunch, alternating songs while the
Dollies and the Cal cheerleaders
danced. Say what you will about the
Stanford Band, but as KFOG
Radio's Kevin Radich, a man who
should know his rock 'n' roll, put it,
"The Stanford Band won this one
hands down." The comparison be
tween the Dollies and the Cal
cheerleaders was also, shall we
say, equally positive.
Then KCBS' Bob Murphy took
over the show. The laughs soon fol
lowed. "In you and Joe (Kapp),"
Murphy said to Jack Elway, "we've
got two guys who know how to
cocktail."
When Elway got up to speak,
game strategy continued to be
ignored. No talk of how to stop
Marc Hicks or John Paye, no refer
ence to Power I's and 50 Okies and
the 90 Series.
"It's the biggest football game
I've ever been a part (of)," said El
way, an alumnus of Washington
State. "There've been a lot of great
players associated with it, and I'm
going to say, Joe, you were one of
them," he said, looking at the cur
rent Bears coach who led Cal to its
last Rose Bowl in 1959.
But Elway couldn't escape the
disappointment this year has
brought and the relative insig
nificance of the game. "My dream is
to be a part of Big Game when both
teams are 10-0 and going for the
Rose Bowl," he said.
And Kapp shared that view but
realized it may not happen soon. "I
just hope you're not 200 years old

when that happens, Jack," he said.
Kapp endeared himself even
more to those on the Stanford side
when he recognized two Olympic
gold medalist swimmers in atten
dence, Cal's Matt Biondi and Stan
ford's Pablo Morales, whom he
called "that Mexican who went to
Stanford." Morales, whose parents
came to the United States from
Cuba, is a native of Santa Clara.
As Murphy recounted the great
Big Games through the years, as
Don Bunce told what it was like to
quarterback Stanford in the last Big
Game with a Rose Bowl team in
1971, the tradition behind this game
began to negate the records of the
two teams.

'This game is mar
velous regardless
of the records.'
- KGO Radio's
Joe Sharkey

KGO Radio's Joe Sharkey, the
radio voice of the Bears, summed
that up. "I don't think the records
have anything to do with it. This
game is marvelous regardless of
the records. I think it'll be the Big
Game forever."
In light of the attention paid to it,
the television cameras whirring,
the hundreds of column inches
being written, the hundreds of
people wanting to be a part of it, the
more than 86,000 people willing to
sit in the cold and watch two foot
ball teams end forgettable seasons,
he may be right.
Maybe it is a game between a
football team that hasn't won the
conference since most freshmen
were four years old and one that
hasn't won since the Eisenhower
Administration. Maybe Stanford's
win over Arizona and Cal's win over
USC meant more than this one will
to either.
But it is Big Game, and the tradi
tion behind it is what makes it the
biggest sporting event in Northern
California. Winning would be a patch
of sunshine against an otherwise
battleship-gray season.
