# Big Game Could Still Help Bad Year
## 
### 
It is fitting that the college foot
ball season here is ending this week
— winter has descended.
The rain yesterday was annoy
ing, not heavy enough for
windshield wipers, not light enough
to ignore. The clouds were low
enough to fill the valley of the San
Andreas Fault and almost touch the
reservoirs that line Interstate 280.
It's basketball season in North
ern California. The rain has come,
the chill is here to stay, and indoors
is the logical place to cheer on the
home team.
The Stanford football team has
struggled to a 3-7 season that has
seemed almost as gray as the sky
obscuring the sunshine that is sure
to reappear. Likewise, winning
football will reappear on the Farm
sometime soon.
But 1985 is not the year for that.
This season is the fifth straight that
Stanford has lost more games than
it has won. This university has
fielded teams since 1892; never
have there been five consecutive
losing seasons. Should the Cardinal
win Saturday, a 4-7 year might

kindly be described as mediocre;
should it lose, a 3-8 year might
kindly be called poor.
For some teams with whom the
hope of a conference championship
hinges on the phrase, "Wait 'til next
year," the final game is a chance to
end that hope for an archrival. It's a

chance to gain some measure of
satisfaction from contributing to a
hated team's misery just as the
entire season has contributed to
your own misery.
That is not the case for Stanford.
California is 4-6, itself on the verge
of achieving mediocrity. The game
will have a bearing on the final
Pacific 10 Conference standings —
eighth place remains up for grabs

— but on nothing else of impor
tance.
Saturday is the final game of a
forgettable season for two second
division football teams on a rain
slicked road to obscurity, far from
Pasadena. It is important to the
players, but then any college foot
ball game is important to college
football players. But does it matter
to anyone else?
As one drives up 1-280, two
splotches of red paint provide an af
firmative answer. There is a sign on
a mountain that reads "SOUTH
SAN FRANCISCO/THK INDUS
TRIAL CITY." The first Sand U
stand out of the unceasing mist be
cause of the coating of cardinal paint
applied by a Stanford booster.
Then there was the sight atop
Nob Hill of two poorly attired
marching bands swarming into the
Fairmount Hotel. Granted, the
Fairmount is a place one wears a
jacket and tie, but a red jacket and
five-tone tie isn't exactly the idea.
And inside the Grand Ballroom of

win. The two exchanged pleasantries again at yesterdays Guardsmen Big Game Luncheon in
