# Water Polo Women Stay Together
## Club team is national champ, still looking for recognition 
### ROBERT PORTNOY 
Camaraderie may be the driving
force behind women's water polo
at Stanford, but the women have a
lot more going for them. Like tal
ent.
Last year's squad, which won
the national championship, was
made up of a skilled and resource
ful group of swimmers, many of
whom could have swam for the
varsity at another college.
But what keeps all the talent to
gether is a feeling of camaraderie
that usually arises in a club sport.
The women do most of their own
fund raising, and just finding
enough money to make the trip to
Berkeley to meet the arch-rival
Bears is an accomplishment.
Also, the players themselves
are involved in most of the major
decisions concerning the team. In
fact, they even made the final
decision regarding the hiring of
the team's new coach this season,
Bruce Johnson.
Johnson has been coaching
water po!o, both women's and
men's, no less than 15 years, and
he has produced a total of 10 high
school Ail-Americans and three
Olympians in that span.
In addition to all that, Johnson
was an Ail-American swimmer
and polo player in high school and
college.
Just like most club sports, the
women had to go out and find
what they wanted. What they
sought was a capable and experi
enced coach, and the team got
just that in Johnson.
Workouts for the women began
about four weeks ago with relaxed
conditioning at DeGuerre Pool.
Some 25 women will be playing
for Stanford this year, and none of
them will be disappointed.
Women's water polo is rather
unique in that everyone who
comes out gets to play. The only
requirement is that you learn how
to swim and swim fast.
The squad is divided into three
teams, A, Band C, with the A
team representing the highest
level of skill and experience.
There has been a larger than
expected turnout for the team this
year, and returning player Vicki
Chan attributes the large crowd to
better publicity.
"There seems to be more inter
est this year simply because more

people heard about us," Chan
said.
As one might expect, recogni
tion is a problem for the team, es
pecially when there exists such a
highly successful men's water
polo team here. There's a general
feeling among the women that a
lot of people in the Stanford com
munity don't even know women's
water polo exists.
Karen Doctor, an honorable
mention Ail-American last year, is
one of those who is a little
frustrated.
"We workout, too. It's not too
bothersome that we don't get
much exposure, but we sure wish
we had a lot more," Doctor said.
Despite the lack of recognition,
the women are very enthusiastic
about the upcoming season. Just
watching them practice, one can
sense the closeness on the team.
Several of the players are in their
junior or senior years and have
piayea water polo since they were
freshmen. First-team honorable
mention All-America Jill Palmer is
one.
"I played in high school, and
this is my fourth year on the team
here. We've got a mix of per
sonalities on this team. A lot of us
used to be competitive swimmers
and like to be in the water," Pal
mer said. "It's fun and social, but

you still maintain the competitive
ness. You can play a sport without
involving yourself five hours a
day.
"It's different from varsity
teams because we do so much
ourselves. We hired the coach,
not the University. Wendy
Johnson, a player, is the president
of the club, and she took care of
organizing and getting the pro
gram in order this year," Palmer
added.
Everyone's working together
to make the team both fun and
successful. Lorna Thornton is an
other four-year senior on the
team.
"It's a good distraction from
studies for me. I'm an electrical
engineer, and it's a good way to
stay in shape without a huge com
mitment, " Thornton said.
"Madeleine Maillet is really a
hard worker and one who's dedi
cated and gives a lot of moral sup
port," Thornton added. "She
never complains, and that's pretty
typical of the team. We're all very
supportive of each other and posi
tive in everything we do. Never in
my four years on the team has
there been a problem between
players. Since we're a club sport,
it's hard to complain about some
thing that's self-run."
Eileen McManus, a third-year

junior who played on the B team
last year, is an example of a player
that just drifted into the program.
"I swam in New Hampshire,
and I took [men's water polo
Coach Dante Dettamanti's] water
polo class and got really inter
ested. I came out for the team,
and here there's a level of compe
tition for everybody," she said.
"I'm stopping out spring quar
ter, when competition starts, but
I'm working out with the team
through the fall and winter so I can
hopefully go to nationals with the
team as a senior," McManus ex
plained.
Maillet, also a four-year senior,
has only one goal in mind for the
team.
"We have a lot of fun, but it
could be even better. It doesn't
bother me we don't get enough
recognition. The bothersome
thing is we don't get enough
funds. If we'd get more recogni
tion, we might get more money,"
Maillet said.
The team is a little lean right
now with three starters overseas
and one not returning, but they'll
be back in time for competition in
the spring.
One thing is certain â€” a little
lack of support won't get these
women down. They're too used to
winning.

The women do most of their own
fund raising, and just finding
enough money to make the trip to
Berkeley to meet the arch-rival
Bears is an accomplishment.
Also, the players themselves
are involved in most of the major
decisions concerning the team. In
fact, they even made the final
decision regarding the hiring of
the team's new coach this season,
Bruce Johnson.
Johnson has been coaching
water po!o, both women's and
men's, no less than 15 years, and
he has produced a total of 10 high
school Ail-Americans and three
Olympians in that span.
In addition to all that, Johnson
was an Ail-American swimmer
and polo player in high school and
college.
Just like most club sports, the
women had to go out and find
what they wanted. What they
sought was a capable and experi
enced coach, and the team got
just that in Johnson.
Workouts for the women began
about four weeks ago with relaxed
conditioning at DeGuerre Pool.
Some 25 women will be playing
for Stanford this year, and none of
them will be disappointed.
Women's water polo is rather
unique in that everyone who
comes out gets to play. The only
requirement is that you learn how
to swim and swim fast.
The squad is divided into three
teams, A, Band C, with the A
team representing the highest
level of skill and experience.
There has been a larger than
expected turnout for the team this
year, and returning player Vicki
Chan attributes the large crowd to
better publicity.
"There seems to be more inter
est this year simply because more

people heard about us," Chan
said.
As one might expect, recogni
tion is a problem for the team, es
pecially when there exists such a
highly successful men's water
polo team here. There's a general
feeling among the women that a
lot of people in the Stanford com
munity don't even know women's
water polo exists.
Karen Doctor, an honorable
mention Ail-American last year, is
one of those who is a little
frustrated.
"We workout, too. It's not too
bothersome that we don't get
much exposure, but we sure wish
we had a lot more," Doctor said.
Despite the lack of recognition,
the women are very enthusiastic
about the upcoming season. Just
watching them practice, one can
sense the closeness on the team.
Several of the players are in their
junior or senior years and have
piayea water polo since they were
freshmen. First-team honorable
mention All-America Jill Palmer is
one.
"I played in high school, and
this is my fourth year on the team
here. We've got a mix of per
sonalities on this team. A lot of us
used to be competitive swimmers
and like to be in the water," Pal
mer said. "It's fun and social, but

you still maintain the competitive
ness. You can play a sport without
involving yourself five hours a
day.
"It's different from varsity
teams because we do so much
ourselves. We hired the coach,
not the University. Wendy
Johnson, a player, is the president
of the club, and she took care of
organizing and getting the pro
gram in order this year," Palmer
added.
Everyone's working together
to make the team both fun and
successful. Lorna Thornton is an
other four-year senior on the
team.
"It's a good distraction from
studies for me. I'm an electrical
engineer, and it's a good way to
stay in shape without a huge com
mitment, " Thornton said.
"Madeleine Maillet is really a
hard worker and one who's dedi
cated and gives a lot of moral sup
port," Thornton added. "She
never complains, and that's pretty
typical of the team. We're all very
supportive of each other and posi
tive in everything we do. Never in
my four years on the team has
there been a problem between
players. Since we're a club sport,
it's hard to complain about some
thing that's self-run."
Eileen McManus, a third-year

junior who played on the B team
last year, is an example of a player
that just drifted into the program.
"I swam in New Hampshire,
and I took [men's water polo
Coach Dante Dettamanti's] water
polo class and got really inter
ested. I came out for the team,
and here there's a level of compe
tition for everybody," she said.
"I'm stopping out spring quar
ter, when competition starts, but
I'm working out with the team
through the fall and winter so I can
hopefully go to nationals with the
team as a senior," McManus ex
plained.
Maillet, also a four-year senior,
has only one goal in mind for the
team.
"We have a lot of fun, but it
could be even better. It doesn't
bother me we don't get enough
recognition. The bothersome
thing is we don't get enough
funds. If we'd get more recogni
tion, we might get more money,"
Maillet said.
The team is a little lean right
now with three starters overseas
and one not returning, but they'll
be back in time for competition in
the spring.
One thing is certain â€” a little
lack of support won't get these
women down. They're too used to
winning.

Junior Carol Lieske is in Florence now, but like a few other Cardinal water polo players, she
plans to return in the spring for the season. The club team won the national championship
last year, but many players still feel overshadowed by the men's squad.
Camaraderie may be the driving
force behind women's water polo
at Stanford, but the women have a
lot more going for them. Like tal
ent.
Last year's squad, which won
the national championship, was
made up of a skilled and resource
ful group of swimmers, many of
whom could have swam for the
varsity at another college.
But what keeps all the talent to
