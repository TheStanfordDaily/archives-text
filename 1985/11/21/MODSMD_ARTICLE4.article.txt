# The 						Future Sweeps Forth From Stanford
## Scholars Submit Mars Base Proposal 
### LARRY WEBER Staff writer 
A group of scholars yesterday presented a plan for
the development of a research base on Mars to the Na
tional Commission on Space, just one day after
astronomer Carl Sagan suggested a joint U.S.-USSR
expedition to the red planet.
"The next goal of the United States space program
should be to establish a permanent research base on
Mars," stated the report submitted by the Case For
Mars research group.
The commission received the plan on the last day of
a three-day convention at Stanford. The nine-month
old commission was appointed by President Reagan to
collect opinions concerning future directions for the
space program and will file its final report to the presi
dent in March 1986.
"Establishing a permanent colony on another planet
would have immense historical importance, greater
than the colonizing of the New World," said Carol
Stoker, leader of Case For Mars, which is comprised of

former University of Colorado graduate students.
A necessary precursor to the development of a Mars
base is an accurate assessment of the Martian environ
ment in order to determine the adverse effects it could
have on humans, to outline the planet's resource po
tential and to help locate a safe and "scientifically inter
esting" area of settlement, according to Stoker.
"Why Mars? It is endowed with the resources to sus
tain human life," said Stoker, noting the presence of
water and carbon dioxide on the planet.
The ultimate goal of a lasting settlement on Mars,
according to Stoker and her colleagues, is the utiliza
tion of Martian resources to achieve total self
sufficiency.
"Self-sufficiency is an important concept for develop
ing an initial base, and also for very long-range plan
ning," said Case For Mars member Chris McKay.
"Even if the first mission is a grab-the-rocks-and
come-home mission, it will be important in terms of
using Martian resources and setting a precedent. We
would be establishing a new
paradigm for space exploration by
going there and relying on in
digenous sources," McKay told the
commission.
Penelope Boston, the research
group's biologist, stressed that the
current lack of scientific knowledge
hinders proper development and
use of Martian resources.
, she urged immediate research
on closed ecological systems, which
would be necessary to grow food
for Martian dwellers, as well as in
.vestigations of long-duration recy
cling systems, which are vital for
the group's goal of a self-sufficient
base.
Also on her "shopping list for re
search needs" are inquiries into the
possible isolating effects upon the
psyche caused by extended in
volvement away from earth and the
potential physiological complica
tions of living in fractional or zero
gravity.
.•.•"We need to do those kinds of
studies for periods we feel are close
to the duration of a long-term space
mission," she said.
Jim French, a Jet Propulsion Lab

oratory engineer and Case For
Mars member, presented actual
designs for a potential Mars-bound
craft — which he called a "Model T
version" — that would land on the
planet's surface with a cargo of
building blocks for an initial base.
Pointing at a slide of the Martian
surface and the red sky above,
French said, "Between that surface
and that atmosphere, we have what
we need to establish a permanently
habitated base on Mars. We have
the technology. We only lack the
will to do it."
A reason for this unwillingness,
as space commission member
David Webb indicated, is the enor
mous cost implied by the Case For
Mars proposal.
Webb pointed out the untimeli
ness of presenting the U.S.
Congress with a "$lOO billion pro
gram" while the government is cur
rently harboring a $200 billion dollar
deficit.
Stoker agreed, stating that
"selling Congress is a different
issue," and suggested "addressing
what are the causes of the deficit."
