# The
						Future Sweeps Forth From Stanford
## Scholars Submit Mars Base Proposal 
### LARRY WEBER Staff writer 
A group of scholars yesterday presented a plan for
the development of a research base on Mars to the Na
tional Commission on Space, just one day after
astronomer Carl Sagan suggested a joint U.S.-USSR
expedition to the red planet.
"The next goal of the United States space program
should be to establish a permanent research base on
Mars," stated the report submitted by the Case For
Mars research group.
The commission received the plan on the last day of
a three-day convention at Stanford. The nine-month
old commission was appointed by President Reagan to
collect opinions concerning future directions for the
space program and will file its final report to the presi
dent in March 1986.
"Establishing a permanent colony on another planet
would have immense historical importance, greater
than the colonizing of the New World," said Carol
Stoker, leader of Case For Mars, which is comprised of

former University of Colorado graduate students.
A necessary precursor to the development of a Mars
base is an accurate assessment of the Martian environ
ment in order to determine the adverse effects it could
have on humans, to outline the planet's resource po
tential and to help locate a safe and "scientifically inter
esting" area of settlement, according to Stoker.
"Why Mars? It is endowed with the resources to sus
tain human life," said Stoker, noting the presence of
water and carbon dioxide on the planet.
The ultimate goal of a lasting settlement on Mars,
according to Stoker and her colleagues, is the utiliza
tion of Martian resources to achieve total self
sufficiency.
"Self-sufficiency is an important concept for develop
ing an initial base, and also for very long-range plan
ning," said Case For Mars member Chris McKay.
"Even if the first mission is a grab-the-rocks-and
come-home mission, it will be important in terms of
using Martian resources and setting a precedent. We
