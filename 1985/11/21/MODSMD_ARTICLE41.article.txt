## Basketball Signs Top Recruit 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
The Stanford men's basketball
team yesterday announced the
signing of Stuart Thomas, a 6-
foot-9 forward from Mater Dei
High School in Los Angeles, on
the final day of the NCAA's early
signing period.
"We feel Stuart is a first-rate,
front-line player, and we're very
pleased that he decided to further
his education at Stanford," bas
ketball Coach Tom Davis said.
"He comes to us with an estab
lished reputation."
The November signing period
was implemented to allow high
school seniors to commit to a col
lege before starting their final
season.
In his junior season last year,
Thomas averaged nine points and
eight rebounds a game as Mater
Dei capped a 29-0 season by win
ning the state championship.
Thomas caught the attention of
the Stanford coaches with his per

formance in two top camps this
summer. At the Great Western
Shootout in Huntington Beach
and the Basketball Congress In
ternational All-Star Tournament
in Phoenix, Ariz., Thomas
averaged over 30 points a game
and was the most valuable player
at both camps.
Thomas was a preseason
honorable mention Ail-American
by Street and Smith, was named
one of the top 100 prep players in
the country by The Sporting
News and is the 70th best high
school player in America accord
ing to Basketball Weekly.
"I'm coming to Stanford be
cause of its basketball and its aca
demic program," Thomas said.
"It truly represents the best of
both worlds."
Thomas was offered scholar
ships to several other Pacific 10
Conference schools, as well as
being recruited heavily by Big
East power Syracuse.
Last season, Thomas was
named to the All-California Inter
scholastic Federation and the All-

Angelus League teams, as well as
the all-tournament teams in all
four tournaments Mater Dei
played in.
"First of all, Stanford is the
perfect school for Stuart," Mater
Dei Coach Gary McKnight said.
"He's very strong academically,
and I feel he will make an impact
on their program. Stuart's a
rugged, durable left-hander
whom I compare favorably to
USC's Wayne Carlander (last
year's Pacific 10 Conference
Player of the Year).
"Even at 6-9, he's at his best
facing the basket. He's an out
standing outside shooter."
In the last three seasons,
Mater Dei was 86-5 and has been
in the state final all three times,
winning twice. Assoc. Head Coach
Bruce Pearl said, "He's a power
forward whom we consider to be a
great offensive player."
"He has a fine perimeter game
for such a big man. There's little
doubt he comes from a great pro
gram and has been well
coached."
