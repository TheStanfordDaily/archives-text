Regan's Words Draw Comments
GENEVA — President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev were drawn into the controversy yesterday over a remark by
White House chief of staff Donald Regan that the weighty issues of
summitry are beyond the understanding of most women.
Regan had told a Washington Post reporter that he thought women
would be more interested in the activities of the U.S. and Soviet first
ladies than in the meetings between Reagan and Gorbachev.
"They're not . . . going to understand (missile) throw-weights or
what is happening in Afghanistan or what is happening in human
rights," Regan said. "Some women will, but most women, believe
me, your readers for the most part if you took a poll, would rather
read the human interest stuff of what happened."
Reagan, standing next to Gorbachev as the second day of summit
talks began yesterday at the Soviet mission, was asked about the
furor over Regan's remarks. "I don't think that he meant for it to be
interpreted in that way at all," the president said. "He was simply
adding to that interest that they also had an interest in children and a
human touch. I think that I know his views on the entire subject bet
ter than most."
In response to the same question Gorbachev replied, "My view is
that both men and women in the United States and the Soviet Union,
all over the world, are interested in having peace for themselves and
being sure that peace would be kept stable and lasting for the future,
and for that they are interested in the reduction of countless weap
ons that we have."
Regan, through an aide, refused to amplify on or clarify his
remarks.
Tribal Clash Kills 8 in S. Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — At least eight blacks were
killed and dozens more wounded as rival tribal groups, numbering
more than 1,000 warriors each and fighting with spears, machetes
and clubs, battled through the night until dawn yesterday outside
Durban.
Most of those killed were hacked to death as groups of Zulu and
Pondo warriors, old rivals, fought up and down a hillside near the
Durban airport, according to police, in one of the most savage tribal
clashes here in recent years. Others were stabbed to death with
spears. Zulus, who constitute the black majority around Durban and
in most of South Africa's Natal province, apparently were intent on
forcing Pondo tribesmen, competitors for increasingly scarce jobs,
to return to eastern Cape province or the Xhosa tribal homelands of
Transkei and Ciskei from where they had come.
The number of dead could rise as high as 20, police said, with
many of the wounded in critical condition and more bodies believed
buried in the ashes of burned-out shacks at Malagazi. Heavily armed
police patrols restored peace late yesterday.
Scientists Fear Second Eruption
MANIZALES, Colombia — Scientists studying the Nevado del
Ruiz volcano that exploded last week, burying 25,000 people in a
massive mud flow, said yesterday the mountain could erupt again
soon.
"Many volcanoes that go off this way have more than one big
bang," said John Tomblin, of the United Nations Disaster Relief Co
ordinator and a senior member of a group of international geologists
who rushed to Colombia after the explosions.
Colombian authorities have sought to calm public fears of another
explosion, issuing daily communiques suggesting that activity inside
the volcano has subsided. But Colombian and foreign specialists who
have established a monitoring site in this city, 35 miles west of the
mountain, said the government's assurances may be overly optimis
tic.
"The situation looks very much the way it did before Nov. 13."
when the last eruption occurred, Tomblin told a group of U.S.
geologists yesterday within earshot of several reporters. "This is
cause for anxiety."
British Official Attacked
LONDON — A British Cabinet minister was physically attacked
by a group of angry Protestants yesterday as he walked from his car
to the city hall entrance in Northern Ireland's provincial capital of
Belfast.
Tom King, secretary of state for Northern Ireland, was hit by an
egg, severely jostled and grabbed in a headlock during the attack by
a handful of men who broke away from a small demonstration outside
the city hall.
At least one punch was thrown, but it apparently missed King as
his aides threw up their briefcases to fend off attackers.
The demonstrators, said to include a large number of city council
lors from the predominantly Protestant Democratic Unionist Party
headed by the Rev. Lan Paisley, had apparently gathered at the city
hall to confront King with their anger over the recent Anglo-Irish
agreement aimed at promoting sectarian peace in the troubled prov
ince.
Protestant militants have charged that the agreement is a first
step toward ending British control of Northern Ireland, which has
seen centuries of sectarian violence between Protestants and Roman
Catholics.
The agreement, which provides the mainly Catholic Irish Republic
with a formal consultative role in Northern Ireland, has been bitterly
denounced as a sellout by leaders of the province's Protestant
majority.
Arafat Meets Top Soviet Official
BAGHDAD, Iraq — Palestine Liberation Organization chairman
Yasser Arafat met here for four hours yesterday with Vladimir
Poliakov, the undersecretary of the Soviet Foreign Ministry.
The meeting came shortly before Arafat was due to meet with top
members of the PLO in an attempt to draft a new policy that the or
ganization hopes will qualify it as a viable political partner in future
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.
Poliakov, currently on a Middle Eastern tour, is understood to
have briefed Arafat on the Arab-Israeli stance taken by Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev at his Geneva talks with President Reagan.
There have been mounting indications that the PLO, which
recently renounced terrorism and guerrilla attacks outside Israel and
the occupied territories, was considering further steps to boost its
image as a political partner in Mideast peacemaking.
The main issue expected to be taken up at the PLO meetings is
Jordanian King Hussein's demand that the organization publicly ac
cepts U.N. resolutions 242 and 338, which explicitly recognize Is
rael's right to exist within secure boundaries.

British Official Attacked
LONDON — A British Cabinet minister was physically attacked
by a group of angry Protestants yesterday as he walked from his car
to the city hall entrance in Northern Ireland's provincial capital of
Belfast.
Tom King, secretary of state for Northern Ireland, was hit by an
egg, severely jostled and grabbed in a headlock during the attack by
a handful of men who broke away from a small demonstration outside
the city hall.
At least one punch was thrown, but it apparently missed King as
his aides threw up their briefcases to fend off attackers.
The demonstrators, said to include a large number of city council
lors from the predominantly Protestant Democratic Unionist Party
headed by the Rev. Lan Paisley, had apparently gathered at the city
hall to confront King with their anger over the recent Anglo-Irish
agreement aimed at promoting sectarian peace in the troubled prov
ince.
Protestant militants have charged that the agreement is a first
step toward ending British control of Northern Ireland, which has
seen centuries of sectarian violence between Protestants and Roman
Catholics.
The agreement, which provides the mainly Catholic Irish Republic
with a formal consultative role in Northern Ireland, has been bitterly
denounced as a sellout by leaders of the province's Protestant
majority.
Arafat Meets Top Soviet Official
BAGHDAD, Iraq — Palestine Liberation Organization chairman
Yasser Arafat met here for four hours yesterday with Vladimir
Poliakov, the undersecretary of the Soviet Foreign Ministry.
The meeting came shortly before Arafat was due to meet with top
members of the PLO in an attempt to draft a new policy that the or
ganization hopes will qualify it as a viable political partner in future
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.
Poliakov, currently on a Middle Eastern tour, is understood to
have briefed Arafat on the Arab-Israeli stance taken by Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev at his Geneva talks with President Reagan.
There have been mounting indications that the PLO, which
recently renounced terrorism and guerrilla attacks outside Israel and
the occupied territories, was considering further steps to boost its
image as a political partner in Mideast peacemaking.
The main issue expected to be taken up at the PLO meetings is
Jordanian King Hussein's demand that the organization publicly ac
cepts U.N. resolutions 242 and 338, which explicitly recognize Is
rael's right to exist within secure boundaries.
Regan's Words Draw Comments
GENEVA — President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev were drawn into the controversy yesterday over a remark by
White House chief of staff Donald Regan that the weighty issues of
summitry are beyond the understanding of most women.
Regan had told a Washington Post reporter that he thought women
would be more interested in the activities of the U.S. and Soviet first
ladies than in the meetings between Reagan and Gorbachev.
"They're not . . . going to understand (missile) throw-weights or
what is happening in Afghanistan or what is happening in human
rights," Regan said. "Some women will, but most women, believe
me, your readers for the most part if you took a poll, would rather
read the human interest stuff of what happened."
Reagan, standing next to Gorbachev as the second day of summit
talks began yesterday at the Soviet mission, was asked about the
furor over Regan's remarks. "I don't think that he meant for it to be
interpreted in that way at all," the president said. "He was simply
adding to that interest that they also had an interest in children and a
human touch. I think that I know his views on the entire subject bet
ter than most."
In response to the same question Gorbachev replied, "My view is
that both men and women in the United States and the Soviet Union,
all over the world, are interested in having peace for themselves and
being sure that peace would be kept stable and lasting for the future,
and for that they are interested in the reduction of countless weap
ons that we have."
Regan, through an aide, refused to amplify on or clarify his
remarks.
Tribal Clash Kills 8 in S. Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — At least eight blacks were
killed and dozens more wounded as rival tribal groups, numbering
more than 1,000 warriors each and fighting with spears, machetes
and clubs, battled through the night until dawn yesterday outside
Durban.
Most of those killed were hacked to death as groups of Zulu and
Pondo warriors, old rivals, fought up and down a hillside near the
Durban airport, according to police, in one of the most savage tribal
clashes here in recent years. Others were stabbed to death with
spears. Zulus, who constitute the black majority around Durban and
in most of South Africa's Natal province, apparently were intent on
forcing Pondo tribesmen, competitors for increasingly scarce jobs,
to return to eastern Cape province or the Xhosa tribal homelands of
Transkei and Ciskei from where they had come.
The number of dead could rise as high as 20, police said, with
many of the wounded in critical condition and more bodies believed
buried in the ashes of burned-out shacks at Malagazi. Heavily armed
police patrols restored peace late yesterday.
Scientists Fear Second Eruption
MANIZALES, Colombia — Scientists studying the Nevado del
Ruiz volcano that exploded last week, burying 25,000 people in a
massive mud flow, said yesterday the mountain could erupt again
soon.
"Many volcanoes that go off this way have more than one big
bang," said John Tomblin, of the United Nations Disaster Relief Co
ordinator and a senior member of a group of international geologists
who rushed to Colombia after the explosions.
Colombian authorities have sought to calm public fears of another
explosion, issuing daily communiques suggesting that activity inside
the volcano has subsided. But Colombian and foreign specialists who
have established a monitoring site in this city, 35 miles west of the
mountain, said the government's assurances may be overly optimis
tic.
"The situation looks very much the way it did before Nov. 13."
when the last eruption occurred, Tomblin told a group of U.S.
geologists yesterday within earshot of several reporters. "This is
