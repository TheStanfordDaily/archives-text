# Joint ceremony in Geneva
## Reagan, Gorbachev Conclude Summit 
### 
GENEVA — President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev wrapped up their two
day summit early this morning, saying that while
major differences remain between the super
powers, both sides would seek to accelerate on
going arms control negotiations.
Meanwhile, U.S. officials said the two leaders
reached an understanding that they will hold two
more summits, one in the United States and the
other in the Soviet Union.
In separate addresses televised live starting at
1:10 a.m. PST, Reagan and Gorbachev acknowl
edged that differences persist in arms control
and regional conflicts but stressed that the sum
mit provided a starting point for future talks.
After Reagan and Gorbachev spoke, Secre
tary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze signed treaties

relating to the talks. The text of those accords
was unavailable at presstime.
Gorbachev, speaking in Russian, said both
sides "must be realistic," adding that it was "not
possible" for the superpowers to reach major
agreements at this time. He stressed the need
to limit arms on earth and prevent weapons
deployments in space.
The Soviet leader also urged "further con
sultation on regional problems on which our posi
tions are different."
Reagan, who said he "came to Geneva to seek
a fresh start in our relations with the Soviet
Union," said the summit had "useful interim
results." While he noted that the final "report
card" on the talks is not yet known, he said the
summit, would "inject momentum" into the on
going arms control negotiations.

The president, who referred to the meeting as
a "fireside summit," said, "We are ready for hard
work ahead." He then told Gorbachev, we need
your help in getting the job done — and I m sure
you will."
U.S. officials, talking on condition they not be
identified, said the two leaders would announce
at a joint ceremony before leaving Geneva on
Thursday that Gorbachev will visit the United
States next year and Reagan will go to the Soviet
Union in 1987.
Specific locations and plans for the back-to
back follow-up summit conferences are still to be
worked out, the sources said.
The quick succession of three superpower
summit meetings, after a lapse of more than six
years, recalled the pace of summit diplomacy in
the 19705.
