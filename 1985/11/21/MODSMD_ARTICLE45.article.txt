# Economy Shows Unexpected Strength
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The economy
grew at an unexpectedly sharp 4.3
percent annual rate from July
through September, the strongest
gain in nearly a year and a marked
improvement over its sluggish per
formance in the first half of the
year, the government said yester
day.
The Commerce Department ear
lier had reported that the gross na
tional product — the nation's total
output of goods and services — had
increased at a 3.3 percent annual
rate in the third quarter. But yes
terday it revised that figure a full
percentage point higher, crediting a
sharp jump in defense spending and
strong automobile sales and pro
duction this summer.

The Reagan Administration,
which has predicted the economy
would speed up from its 0.3 percent
real growth rate in the first quarter
of the year and 1.9 percent rate in
the second, said yesterday the new
GNP report vindicated its earlier
forecast of a sharp rebound in the
second half of the year.
"We're coming into the new year
with some pretty good numbers,"
Council of Economic Advisers
Chairman Beryl Sprinkel said. "It's
solidly in the bag. It looks pretty
good to me. We're certainly not on
the verge of a sump hole of eco
nomic activity."
Sprinkel said the Administration
planned to stay with its forecast of 5
percent real growth for the last half

of the year and 3 percent growth
for the full year. He said fourth
quarter growth should be between
5 and 6 percent. With yesterday's
revision, GNP would have to grow
at a 5.7 percent rate in the last
three months to achieve the Admin
istration's goal.
Many economists said they were
surprised by yesterday's figures
and had expected the Commerce
Department to revise downward its
earlier estimate of 3.3 percent
growth in GNP. With the upward
revision, the third quarter rate was
the fastest since a 4.3 percent pace
in the fourth quarter last year.
Despite the encouraging figures
yesterday, many analysts said they
doubted the economy would do

more than continue to muddle
along, because a major force behind
the stong growth in the third quar
ter was a sharp increase in automo
bile sales, spurred by cut-rate
financing programs that have since
ended.
Some analysts also were pes
simistic about future economic ac
tivity because business outlays
have slowed and consumers, with
historically high debt and low
savings, aren't expected to main
tain their rapid spending pace. The
Commerce Department said yes
terday that personal saving as a
percentage of disposable personal
income dropped to a 35-year low of
2.7 percent from 5.1 percent in the
second quarter.
