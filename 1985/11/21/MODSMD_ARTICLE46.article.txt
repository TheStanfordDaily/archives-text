School Bias Ruling
A federal judge, in the first decision of its
kind, ruled yesterday that city officials in
Yonkers, N.Y., maintained a segregated
school system by refusing to build low-income
housing on the exclusive east side of town for
more than three decades.
In a 600-page decision, U.S. District Court
Judge Leonard Sand detailed the causal rela
tionship between segregated neighborhoods
and segregated schools. He said that Yonkers
officials are liable for the perpetuation of
mostly white and mostly black schools because
they deliberately relegated all subsidized
housing projects to the minority neighbor
hoods on the city's west side.
Civil-rights lawyers said the ruling would
provide a potent legal weapon for private plain
tiffs to challenge patterns of housing and
school segregation in other cities, but that
they do not expect the Reagan Administration
to bring such cases.
Senate OKs Farm Cut
WASHINGTON — A bipartisan Senate coal
ition handed the Reagan Administration a
major farm policy victory yesterday, voting 55-
42 to steadily reduce direct income-subsidy
payments to grain, cotton and rice farmers
after a one-year freeze.
The action, which met the Administration's
primary demand for cutting the huge costs of
farm programs, reversed an earlier decision to
join the House in freezing the multibillion
dollar subsidies for at least four years.

The Senate reversed its stand after Majority
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) dumped a wagon
load of "sweeteners" into a pending farm bill,
inducing six Republicans and three Democrats
to switch sides on the politically explosive sub
sidy issue.
The Senate action broke a three-week im
passe during which Republicans and Demo
crats had jockeyed furiously on an issue that
Democrats hope will help them recapture con
trol of the Senate in next year's congressional
elections.
Twelve of the 22 Republican Senate seats
up for re-election are in heavily agricultural
states that are experiencing the worst eco
nomic crisis in six decades.
The net fiscal effect of the Senate's voting to
cut income subsidies and other programs —
while increasing benefits elsewhere — was to
trim about $10 billion from a bill that the Ad
ministration contended was $30 billion over
budget.
Oil Tax Approved
WASHINGTON — The House Ways and
Means Committee, pushing toward finishing
sweeping tax overhaul legislation by the end of
this week, yesterday approved a set of new
taxes on the oil industry that would raise $4.2
billion over five years.
The proposal "didn't kill us. (It) just chopped
off an arm and a leg. I'm alive; I'm just not
happy," said Rep. Henson Moore, a Republi
can from oil-producing Louisiana and a leading
opponent of the proposed new regulations.
The committee approved the plan 29-4.

It was tougher on the industry than the plan
set forward by President Reagan, which would
raise $1.9 billion over five years, but fell far
short of the $9.1-billion revenue goal set by
committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D
-111.)
Trade Bill Introduced
WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of 30
senators, asserting that trade remains a top
priority on Capitol Hill, yesterday introduced
sweeping legislation that Majority Leader
Robert Dole (R-Kans.) said would be the cen
terpiece of next year's congressional debate
on trade.
"The strong bipartisan showing
demonstrates well that we in Congress have to
face up to the trade issue," said Dole, a co
sponsor.
"It addresses the major problems of U.S.
trade, including the credibility of our laws, the
effectiveness of GATT (General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based or
ganization that regulates world trade) and the
value of the dollar," added Sen. John Danforth
(R-Mo.) principal sponsor of the bill.
