Duke's Task Force
SAN FRANCISCO — Gov. George Deuk
mejian yesterday announced the formation of a
Task Force on Waste, Energy and Technology
to help find a solution to the state's toxic waste
problem.
"We've learned very painfully that the toxics
we think are safely buried in the ground are a
threat and can poison our water, contaminate
our food, hurt our wildlife and spoil our recrea
tional opportunities," Deukmejian said in San
Francisco during a speech to the Common
wealth Club.
Theodore Hullar, chancellor of UC-
Riverside, was appointed chairman of the task
force. A spokesman for the governor said
other task force members will be announced
later in the week.
Deukmejian said the task force will be a
"high-level, non-partisan panel" of leading sci
entists, academicians, corporate leaders, en
vironmentalists, legislators and state and na
tional officials.

Poisoning Scare
LOS ANGELES — Terrified shoppers
jammed a county Health Department hotline
with calls yesterday as leaders of striking uni
ons posted a $25,000 reward for information
on whoever threatened to poison meat and
produce.
No tainted food was found by early yester
day afternoon, but tensions in a bitter labor
dispute ran high after syringes containing
traces of herbicides were found at five Alpha
Beta stores in Los Angeles County. The FBI
was among those investigating.
In a separate development, Superior Court
Judge Norman Epstein ordered six Southern
California meat cutters locals and five
Teamsters locals to stand trial on contempt
charges. Ralph Scalzo, an attorney for the su
permarkets, argued that union pickets have
threatened customers, slashed tires and bro
ken windows at markets.
Epstein, who set a Dec. 19 hearing date,
said there was sufficient evidence for trial that

union pickets had violated court orders
governing their conduct.
Alpha Beta assured customers that security
had been increased as violence continued else
where: Stink bombs were set off Tuesday
night at seven Vons markets in the county and
two men were jailed yesterday after shots
were fired at a Safeway truck driver in San
Bernardino. There were no reports of major
injuries.
Smoking Trial Set
SANTA BARBARA — A jury composed
mostly of nonsmokers was selected yesterday
to decide whether R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.
is liable for the lung cancer death of a man who
smoked the firm's cigarettes.
Only two current smokers were on the
panel of 16 jurors who were sworn in after
three days of intensive questioning by attor
neys for Reynolds and the family of the late
John Mark Galbraith.
