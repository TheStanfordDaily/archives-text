# Information-Driven Society Envisioned

### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
The United States in the year 2035 will play the role
of an "integrator" among the world's nations, Prof.
Rene Zentner told the National Commission on Space
yesterday.
The commission was created by President Reagan
to study the space program and develop an
"aggressive" plan for the future. Yesterday's meeting
in the Durand Building, attended by about 50 people,
concluded three days of hearings at Stanford.
Zentner, a law professor at the University of Hous
ton, told the commission that the United States in 50
years will be an "information-driven society," with new
moral issues being raised by the increase in technol
ogy.
Although the United States will still be a
"democratic, egalitarian society," many political, eco
nomic and judiciary changes will occur by 2035,
Zentner explained.

"There will be continued reinterpretation of the
Constitution, as problems arise (from new technologi
cal developments)," he said.
Zentner also predicted an improved criminal justice
system, a theory supported by criticism concerning the
existing system.
Social changes, he said, will include an increase in
the Hispanic and Asian population, "with an increasing
concern with the work ethic, which these people will
bring with them." This ethic will lead to a growing
respect for ethnicity, Zentner said.
Other predictions included a 10-year increase in the
average life span, an accelerated growth of the use of
robotics in industry and a tolerance of "intellectual
heterodoxy," Zenter said.
Zenter's lecture was supplemented by an address
from Management Prof. Joseph Kenner of New York
University, who spoke to the commission on the
"alternative futures" of the United States.
Through an examination of the economic history of
the United States, Kenner suggested, important fun-
damental changes can be seen, and
ideas concerning the economic
future of the nation can be reached.
Basing his conclusions on studies
of the gross national product (GNP)
in past years, Kenner predicted a
real-dollar value GNP of up to $6
trillion by 2035, adding, however,
that a more pessimistic estimate
might be as low as $2 trillion.
Kenner concluded by addressing
a topic directly pertinent to the
commission â€” a plan for future
space exploration.
"An establishment in space is an
important adjunct to life on earth,"
Kenner said.
Commission Chairman Thomas
Paine said after the hearing that it
was too early to comment on possi
ble conclusions reached by the
group, but explained that the pur
pose of the present meetings
reflected "the practical benefits of
space systems." He declined to
comment on astronomer Carl
Sagan's suggestion, put before the
commission Tuesday, to plan a joint
U.S.-Soviet manned mission to
Mars.
