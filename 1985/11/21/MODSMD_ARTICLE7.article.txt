# Band Won't Rest 'til Shak Is Safe
## 
### ROB ENO 
Big Game week is a time of tradi
tions: the Axe, the bonfire,
Gaieties, the Rally, a Stanford vic
tory and, of course, pranks. The
Band takes part in its own tradi
tions. Besides the activities we
have come to expect, the incom
parable Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity Marching Band will attempt
to make the campus, or at least the
Band Shak, safe from weenies and
vandalism.
This week, the Band will guard
the Shak non-stop to prevent any
possible vandalism. A different sec
tion of the Band will spend each
night at the Shak.
The Band's manager, Scott
Gode, explains the added responsi
bility. "By the nature of the two
schools, the rivalry is not played up
as much as in the Midwest, where
schools steal each other's mascots.
So the rivalry tends to focus more
on the bands, which are the most
visible groups on campus, besides
the football teams."

The drum section is one group of Band members that has pulled watch duty at the Band Shak this
week, assiduously guarding its lair from Cal band marauders and party poopers.
