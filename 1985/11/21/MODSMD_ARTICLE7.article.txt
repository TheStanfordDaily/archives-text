# Band Won't Rest 'til Shak Is Safe
## 
### ROB ENO 
Big Game week is a time of tradi
tions: the Axe, the bonfire,
Gaieties, the Rally, a Stanford vic
tory and, of course, pranks. The
Band takes part in its own tradi
tions. Besides the activities we
have come to expect, the incom
parable Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity Marching Band will attempt
to make the campus, or at least the
Band Shak, safe from weenies and
vandalism.
This week, the Band will guard
the Shak non-stop to prevent any
possible vandalism. A different sec
tion of the Band will spend each
night at the Shak.
The Band's manager, Scott
Gode, explains the added responsi
bility. "By the nature of the two
schools, the rivalry is not played up
as much as in the Midwest, where
schools steal each other's mascots.
So the rivalry tends to focus more
on the bands, which are the most
visible groups on campus, besides
the football teams."

The drum section is one group of Band members that has pulled watch duty at the Band Shak this
week, assiduously guarding its lair from Cal band marauders and party poopers.
The ritual had a very serious
beginning. In 1977, Stanford
Band announcer Hal Michaelson
said, "In the old days the Band
was in many respects a
paramilitary organization, and a
central focus of activity was to
guard the Band Shak to keep the
Cal weenies from (committing)
acts of vandalism. People then
ran around with walkie-talkies or
slept overnight in the Shak."
Now, spending the night at the
Shak during Big Game week has
become more of a party than a
strategic blockade.
That doesn't mean that the
Band takes the event lightly. The
night before last year's game, the
trumpet section built a brick wall
blocking the main entrance to the
Shak. The Band members had to
crawl through a window to enter
their own practice room. The wall
was hastily disassembled with a
homemade wrecking ball in the fa
mous post-game grovel, a tradi
tion that entails destroying any
thing in the Shak not safeguarded
beforehand.
As well as guarding the Shak,
the Band will watch for unwanted
visitors near Angell Field, where
it practices. Four years ago
someone sawed the 25-foot-high
observation tower located on An
gell Field in half. Now a metal
tower stands in its place, and
Gode said he worries about a mis
sing strut which would be un
detected and dangerous.
There have been few attacks
on the Band recently. However,
one event still sticks in the mind
of many Band members. Two
years ago, after a Big Game Rally
in San Francisco, a Cal band
member stole drum major Simon
Streets' baton.
He let the Cal band members

know, in person and during
numerous post-Rally television
and radio interviews, what he
thought about their actions. As a
result, the baton, "covered with
paper bags," was returned during
Big Game, Streets said.
A similar incident occurred
after the 1978 game. A rickshaw
used by drum major Jim Jett for
the entrance and halftime show
was stolen by a Cal fraternity.
After a lengthy search, a brief car
chase and a minor accident which
the Cal students fled, the slightly
damaged rickshaw was
recovered.
A likely target this year is the
cannon that used to be fired after
Stanford touchdowns. It is no
longer in use and would be easy
to vandalize.
Already several signs and in
struments have disappeared from
the Shak this year, according to
Gode. No one knows, however,
who is responsible for the thefts.
As usual, the Stanford Police
Department is gearing up for an
increase in vandalism and theft
"that is associated with the tradi
tion of Big Game," according to
Capt. Marvin Moore. Additional

foot and traffic patrols have been
added to attempt to prevent the
usual rash of blue paint inscrip
tions and the classic prank of
dyeing the fountains a lovely
shade of blue.
A Cal Spirit Committee mem
ber had no comment regarding
Cal's plans to conduct a vigil
similar to the Band's or any
Berkeley activities.
According to several Band
members, the Cal trumpet sec
tion was expected on campus last
night to attempt, as it has in the
past, to serenade the dorms.
Generally, these musicians are
pelted with eggs and vegetables.
Their final stop is the Shak
where, says Gode, "If we are in a
good mood and have some beer
left, we give them some. Other
wise, we just watch them to make
sure they don't do any damage."
Everyone involved with the
Band firmly discounted sugges
tions that they may "visit" Cal.
"Unless someone had a really
good idea or wanted to get ar
rested, we wouldn't take the time
to drive all the way to Berkeley,"
noted Gode. "Besides, even if we
were going, I wouldn't tell you."

ran around with walkie-talkies or
slept overnight in the Shak."
Now, spending the night at the
Shak during Big Game week has
become more of a party than a
strategic blockade.
That doesn't mean that the
Band takes the event lightly. The
night before last year's game, the
trumpet section built a brick wall
blocking the main entrance to the
Shak. The Band members had to
crawl through a window to enter
their own practice room. The wall
was hastily disassembled with a
homemade wrecking ball in the fa
mous post-game grovel, a tradi
tion that entails destroying any
thing in the Shak not safeguarded
beforehand.
As well as guarding the Shak,
the Band will watch for unwanted
visitors near Angell Field, where
it practices. Four years ago
someone sawed the 25-foot-high
observation tower located on An
gell Field in half. Now a metal
tower stands in its place, and
Gode said he worries about a mis
sing strut which would be un
detected and dangerous.
There have been few attacks
on the Band recently. However,
one event still sticks in the mind
of many Band members. Two
years ago, after a Big Game Rally
in San Francisco, a Cal band
member stole drum major Simon
Streets' baton.
He let the Cal band members

know, in person and during
numerous post-Rally television
and radio interviews, what he
thought about their actions. As a
result, the baton, "covered with
paper bags," was returned during
Big Game, Streets said.
A similar incident occurred
after the 1978 game. A rickshaw
used by drum major Jim Jett for
the entrance and halftime show
was stolen by a Cal fraternity.
After a lengthy search, a brief car
chase and a minor accident which
the Cal students fled, the slightly
damaged rickshaw was
recovered.
A likely target this year is the
cannon that used to be fired after
Stanford touchdowns. It is no
longer in use and would be easy
to vandalize.
Already several signs and in
struments have disappeared from
the Shak this year, according to
Gode. No one knows, however,
who is responsible for the thefts.
As usual, the Stanford Police
Department is gearing up for an
increase in vandalism and theft
"that is associated with the tradi
tion of Big Game," according to
Capt. Marvin Moore. Additional

foot and traffic patrols have been
added to attempt to prevent the
usual rash of blue paint inscrip
tions and the classic prank of
dyeing the fountains a lovely
shade of blue.
A Cal Spirit Committee mem
ber had no comment regarding
Cal's plans to conduct a vigil
similar to the Band's or any
Berkeley activities.
According to several Band
members, the Cal trumpet sec
tion was expected on campus last
night to attempt, as it has in the
past, to serenade the dorms.
Generally, these musicians are
pelted with eggs and vegetables.
Their final stop is the Shak
where, says Gode, "If we are in a
good mood and have some beer
left, we give them some. Other
wise, we just watch them to make
sure they don't do any damage."
Everyone involved with the
Band firmly discounted sugges
tions that they may "visit" Cal.
"Unless someone had a really
good idea or wanted to get ar
rested, we wouldn't take the time
to drive all the way to Berkeley,"
noted Gode. "Besides, even if we
were going, I wouldn't tell you."

Big Game week is a time of tradi
tions: the Axe, the bonfire,
Gaieties, the Rally, a Stanford vic
tory and, of course, pranks. The
Band takes part in its own tradi
tions. Besides the activities we
have come to expect, the incom
parable Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity Marching Band will attempt
to make the campus, or at least the
Band Shak, safe from weenies and
vandalism.
This week, the Band will guard
the Shak non-stop to prevent any
possible vandalism. A different sec
tion of the Band will spend each
night at the Shak.
The Band's manager, Scott
Gode, explains the added responsi
bility. "By the nature of the two
schools, the rivalry is not played up
as much as in the Midwest, where
schools steal each other's mascots.
So the rivalry tends to focus more
on the bands, which are the most
visible groups on campus, besides
the football teams."

The drum section is one group of Band members that has pulled watch duty at the Band Shak this
week, assiduously guarding its lair from Cal band marauders and party poopers.
The ritual had a very serious
beginning. In 1977, Stanford
Band announcer Hal Michaelson
said, "In the old days the Band
was in many respects a
paramilitary organization, and a
central focus of activity was to
guard the Band Shak to keep the
Cal weenies from (committing)
acts of vandalism. People then
ran around with walkie-talkies or
slept overnight in the Shak."
