# Documentary Downs Rape Myth

If a woman is raped by a man she knows, is it still
rape? It is, according to "Rethinking Rape," a short
film on acquaintance rape that played last night to an
audience of more than 200 people in Kresge
Auditorium.
The film examines in a personal manner societal in
fluences, from subtle advertising to blatantly violent or
sexist pornography, that it contends are responsible
for the stereotyping of women as being generally unas
sertive and susceptible to domination by others.
Rape is the only violent crime on the increase today,
acccording to the film, and many facets of modern cul
ture must assume responsibility for that situation.
Rape is not an uncommon occurrence, nor is it un
common for it to go unreported for reasons ranging
from feelings of shame and disgust to genuine fear that
the attacker will strike again, according to the film.
The least commonly reported incidence of rape in
volves acquaintance rape, a situation where the victim
knows the attacker. If a man forces his girlfriend to
have sex, that is still rape, the film said.
The film focuses on two victims with opposing expe
riences: one woman, raped by a casual acquaintance
who immediately dealt with the complications; and the
other, raped by her boyfriend who did not seek coun
seling despite being deeply troubled by the incident.
The film's commentator stated that over two-thirds
of all rapes fall under the heading of acquaintance rape

and that the rape victim typically "tells almost no one,
seeks no counseling and never reports the rape. Ac
quaintance rape cases are much more likely to go un
reported than rapes where the attacker is a stranger.
Traditionally, forced sex occurring between two
people who were intimate with each other was not con
sidered to be rape, according to the film. However, a
forced act of sex constitutes rape, regardless of the ad
vertising and other mass media forms that seem to
push the idea in men that "whenever woman say 'no,
they really mean 'yes,' " according to the film.
The master's thesis of Jeanne LePage, the film
received major funding from the Stanford Rape Educa
tion Project (REP), created in 1979 to combat miscon
ceptions concerning rape. The organization holds
community- and residence-based functions such as the
premiere screening of this film and also collects infor
mation regarding rape.
LePage credited the group with "originally perceiv
ing the need for such a film."
LePage considers rape to be an issue that should not
be cast aside by men as a woman's problem. "Men
need to deal with the problem of rape" because at the
rate at which rapes are increasing, a large number of
men will have to cope with the harsh reality of some
one close to them becoming the victim of rape, she
said. "â€¢3
