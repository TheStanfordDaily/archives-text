BIOLOGY AND THE OCEANS
A New Course
Biology 50, rather than being a survey course, is an
introduction to selected topics felt to be exciting by the
faculty of Hopkins Marine Station and visiting lecturers.
These include aspects of ecology, oceanography,
behavior, cell biology, developmental biology, and
organismal diversity. Weekend field trips to Hopkins
Marine Station will give students "hands-on" experience
with the marine world: collecting trips to the Monterey
submarine canyon and the intertidal zone of the Big Sur
coast; whale observations on Monterey Bay; laboratories
dealing with fertilization of sea urchin eggs, octopus
behavior, wave dynamics, etc.; a tour of the Monterey
Bay Aquarium. No prerequisites.
