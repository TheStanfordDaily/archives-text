# Bonfire Ignites Stanford Spirit
## 
### JOYA WESLEY Senior staff writer 
The Big Game bonfire last night raged almost three
stories high and attracted about 3,000 spectators to
the dry Lagunita lakebed.
The fire, part of a chain of Big Game events staged
by the Stanford Axe Committee, was the culmination
of a rally that included the Stanford Band and Dollies,
the Fleet Street Singers, Football Coach Jack Elway
and a host of Cardinal football players.
The band, along with yell leaders from Branner Hall,
led the crowds in the traditional Big Game chants:
"Give 'em the Axe right in the neck" and, "Beat Cal."
In addition, an announcer gave a presentation on the
Axe's 86-year history and a fireworks display added to
the excitement.
As the program drew on, with football players pass
ing around the microphone and making brief remarks, a
group of impatient students near the back of the crowd
began chanting "Torch It! Torch It!"
Despite the cold and the wait before the lighting of
the bonfire, students expressed a positive response.
"I was totally overwhelmed to see that Stanford has
maintained such a spirited tradition," said freshman
Sherrie Turner.
Although a special unit of Stanford Police, Special
Events police, barricaded the boathouse parking lot for
use as a staging area for Emergency Response, there
were no such incidents, according to the police.
Security for the bonfire, as well as for today's rally
and tomorrow's game, was coordinated by J.J. Chacon,
the Axe Committee's security chairman.
The committee also provided volunteers to guard
Stanford Stadium. From 6 p.m. until morning every
night this week, Axe Committee members have kept
watch in the press box in an attempt to prevent van
dalism.
During the 1983 Big Game Week, student guards
caught a UC-Berkeley student tampering with the
scoreboard. His aim was to set it so that when the
board was turned on, it would display Cal's version of
the controversial score of 1982's Big Game, which Cal
ifornia won 25-20 on the final play.

After 10 years of darkness, the traditional Big Game bonfire was rekindled last
night at Lake Lagunita. The flames reached a height of three stories, dazzling an
audience of 3,000.
In addition to student guards,
events are being policed by Special
Events officers, a force dispatched
by the Stanford Police Department.
Security expenses for Big Game
are paid by the Department of Ath
letics, according to Chacon.
Various student groups outside

the Axe Committee are also assist
ing with security. The rugby team
guarded the boathoause last night;
the crew team guarded the unlit
bonfire; Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity
guarded the stage area and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon contributed.
"Our main goal here is to keep
the arrests down," said Chacon.
"We're going to try to identify and
diffuse any event before it hap
pens."
