The governments of Central America would
prefer to resolve their problems without the help
of foreign intervention, according to a former
president of Costa Rica who spoke yesterday to
approximately 40 people at the Bechtel Interna
tional Center.
"Central America should not be called a
'backyard.' It's our living room, and we should be
able to solve our own problems," said Rodrigo
Carazo, the president of Costa Rica from 1978 to
1982.
Currently president of the University for
Peace, which is located just outside the Costa
Rican capital of San Juan, Carazo said he came to

Stanford to publicize the school and its possible
role as a peace-driving force in Latin America.
Pointing to the recent summit in Geneva as an
example of the inception of the peace process,
Carazo said: "The United States and U.S.S.R.
heads of state have a responsibility to work for
peace. They are not friends, but at least they are
talking. That's exactly what we want to do in my
country. We want to solve the problems on our
own. We don't want the Russians to be there."
The difficulty of foreign intervention in Central
American affairs revolves around the differing
perceptions of the urgent problems facing the
region, explained Carazo. Whereas the Soviet
Union and the United States concentrate on the
possiblity of a nuclear arms build-up there, the
Central American people are more concerned
hunger and well being, he said.

"In my country, to have peace is to be
tranquila," Carazo said, roughly translating the
word to mean "happy" in the sense that one is
free from everyday worries such as finding the
next meal or living an unthreatened life.
In order for the problems of Central America
to be solved, the region must be considered as a
unit and the nations must work together, accord
ing to Carazo, who said it has been difficult for
him personally to work with other people of the
region because he was once president of Costa
Rica.
"Hard feelings are always there. There is
some animosity toward Costa Rica for having
peace," he said. Carazo previously described
Costa Rica as the only peaceful country in the
region.
