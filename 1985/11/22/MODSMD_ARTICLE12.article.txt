## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
The African nation of
Botswana "cannot ignore the
South African threat" to its
liberal democracy, African his
torian Michael Crowder said last
night at Kresge Auditorium.
Crowder, the head of the Uni
versity of Botswana's history de
partment from 1982 until this
year, spoke to about 20 people
concerning Botswana's tenuous
relationship with bordering
South Africa.
"South Africa considers
[Botswana] part of its national
political arena" and would pos
sibly invade Botswana "should
any attempt be made against its
interest," he said.
Crowder said the June 14,
1983 invasion of Botswana by
South African troops seeking al
leged Botswana guerillas

brought a "qualitative change to
the relationship" between the
countries. Prior to that time
South Africa had "never formally
crossed the border in pursuit of
its military interest," he said.
Emphasizing the unusual na
ture of the Botswana govern
ment in relation to other African
nations, Crowder said he was
surprised that South Africa
would strike "against a country
so much admired in the Western
world for its liberal democracy."
Crowder, however, said that
"a rational South African govern
ment" would not launch a full
scale invasion of Botswana, al
though he noted that the South
Africans "haven't necessarily
behaved rationally."
Botswana is "a non-racial soci
ety where race actually doesn't
seem to matter," Crowder said,
citing the country's development
as an example of "what can be
done" in African nations.
