## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Big Game Is Still Big 
### 
Big Game is a big deal. It deserves its capital let
ters and all. But local media seem to think other
wise. The San Francisco Chronicle's sports editor
recently declared a new policy for the paper: That
tomorrow's matchup be referred to merely as "the
Cal-Stanford game." And the San Jose Mercury
News' college football columnist just can't under
stand all of the hype over Big Game. "This is not a
Big Game. This is Stanford vs. Cal. This is 3-7 vs.
4-6," he wrote this week.
Even though Big Game will obviously not decide
who goes to the Rose Bowl, it seems those who
want to turn it into a generic football game have
missed the point. To all the attempts at Big Game
demotion, The Daily says, "Give 'em the axe."
As Steve Aimonetti, Stanford's assistant strength
coach, put it, "People who don't give a damn about
football give a damn about Big Game." Big Game is
a concept apart from the actual clash of two teams
on the field. It just doesn't matter that these two
teams happen to have losing records. Most people
forget about such technicalities when Big Game rolls
around. In fact, Big Game is so big it can practically
salvage an entire season. This is the game people
look forward to. This is the game they remember.
This is the game that counts for as much as

half of a football season, according to Stanford
Coach Jack Elway. Big Game matters because of
bragging rights. It matters because it is the stuff of
rivalry — it is the direct confrontation of the two top
institutions on the West Coast. Big Game is more
than just athletic rivalry; it is has become a symbol
of which school is better as an whole.
Certainly, Big Game is an excuse for Stanford to
despise Cal, and vice versa — and it feels good to
have such intense emotions over something we
know "really" doesn't matter. It is an excuse to
have fun — to run through the streets of San Fran
cisco at the Big Game rally, to get truly psyched. It
is an excuse for tradition: Gaeities, the Axe, the
rally, the Big Game itself.
And we can revel in this tradition, and enjoy the
culmination of the feelings of Cal-Stanford rivalry
that linger in the air in the Bay Area on a daily basis.
There is no denying that these feelings exist, just as
there is no denying the Big Game its rightful name.
Leaving the title off Big Game is unthinkable. It
would be like knocking down Hoover Tower, filling
in Lake Lag with dirt or putting the Band into those
Berkeley band-type uniforms. Stanford wouldn't be
Stanford without Big Game. Indeed, two simple
words can say it all.
