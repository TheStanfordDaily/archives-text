## U.S. Has No Right To Intervene 
### 
Kenneth Fenyo has perhaps des
cribed a version of the U.S. inter
vention policy status quo in his
column (The Daily, Nov. 19), "The
Need for U.S. Intervention." His
support of this nationalistic version,
however, is actually little more than
a manifesto for economic
colonialism.

VIEWPOINT

The point that Mr. Fenyo beats
into our heads for the bulk of the ar
ticle is the idea that the United
States, as the democratic super
power, has both an intrinsic need
and an intrisic right to intervene in
the affairs of "lesser" nations. One
assumes that the nations to which
he refers are those less technologi
cally based or economically for
tunate than ours, thus making them
somehow inferior. Mr. Fenyo
should be reminded, however, that
difference does not imply in
feriority, and many of these nations'
positions of diminished national
strength and great poverty have
been the result of colonization, in
terference or intervention by other
supposedly superior nations. To
say that "Right is on the side of the
mighty" — be it military, economic
or technological might — is to
ignore the basis on which this
country was founded. To use such a
credo as the basis for our foreign
policy is hypocrisy.
Mr. Fenyo separates the United
States from other powerful nations
using the criteria of democracy

versus other governmental
structures. Yet, if democracy as an
ideology is to be proved "better,"
or even different, than others, it
cannot follow the same policies and
practices as past and present "evil
empires." Either we are to assume
that there is an intrinsic value at
tached to being a democracy (a
poorly disguised version of the
Britsh empire's historical belief that
there is a divine rightness attached
to a monarchy), or we must recog
nize, as other superpowers failed to
do, the right of nations to deter
mine their policies without coer
cion. While the Unites States, as
part of the world community,
should be able to express concern
over issues, it should not be posi
tioned as the sole judge and ar
bitrator of all other countries
merely because it is a democratic
superpower.
More important, however, is the
rarity of idealistic motivations in the
United States' intervention in other
countries. U.S. intervention is all
too often for protection of business
interests — protecting access to
oil, mineral rights, monetary in
vestments and general trade inter
ests. We cannot continue to hide
behind such a pseudo-patriotic
claim that we intervene to promote
a worldwide democratic "utopia,"
or whimper that intervention is "the
very nature of a superpower so we
can't help intervening."
Mr. Fenyo portrays the eco
nomic support that the United
States provides to other nations as

a favor, in return for which the
United States should have a free
hand to intervene economically,
militarily or in other ways with that
nation's affairs. In reality, such eco
nomic exchanges between the
United States and other nations are
not intended by the United States
to create what he claims will
become "an interdependence be
tween democratic nations." What
they create is a dependency on
U.S. aid or trade. The other nations
can lose clothing, food, jobs, large
amounts of commerce or the lives
of their people should they not
blindly accept U.S. interference,
though interference is only for the
benefit of the United States. This
one-sided dependence carries with
it the implicit ability to coerce.
While the Soviet Union may be ex
pansionist territorially, we have
become a nation known for building
an economic empire, harming other
nations subtly, under the guise of a
"democratic mission."
In short, the United States cer
tainly should have the right to ex
press approval or disapproval of
other nations' actions. However, to
resort to coercive measures and
call them the only correct solution,
to foster economic dependence and
call it an investment which requires
constant monitoring, are actions to
which no country, proud of a heri
tage built on the foundations of in
dependence, trust and equality,
should carry out.
