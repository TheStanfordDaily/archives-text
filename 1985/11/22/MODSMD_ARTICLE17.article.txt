# Looking Back at J.F.K.

I was playing Trivial Pursuit and the question for a
wedge was: Who killed President John F. Kennedy?
The expected answer was "Lee Harvey Oswald" of
course, but no one knows for certain; on the 22nd an
niversary of Kennedy's assassination we are no closer
to the truth than we were 21 years ago. On Nov. 22,
1963, did Lee Harvey Oswald act alone — or was
there a conspiracy to murder the president of the
United States?
Under the heading: "John Fitzgerald Kennedy, As
sassination," I counted 79 separate books, not includ
ing the 26 volumes produced by the Warren Commis
sion. So much controversy surrounded Kennedy's as
sassination and the commission's shoddy investigation
that, in 1979, a congressional committee was convened
to look into the circumstances surrounding the inci
dent. Its conclusion: Oswald did not act alone. Further
investigations have found no answers, in part because
many significant witnesses have passed away, several
under exceedingly questionable circumstances.

The story of Oswald's life reads like a bad spy novel.
His life included a stay at the base from which U.S. spy
planes flew over the Soviet Union, study of the Russian
language, defections to both the Soviet Union and the
United States and marriage to a Russian woman. Fut
hermore, it seems he was involved in various groups
both favoring and denouncing Fidel Castro's Cuba.
There is strong evidence suggesting that Oswald was a
pawn tangled in a squalid web of intrigue in a Central
Intellignce Agency that was veering out of control. Jack
Ruby, the man who killed Oswald before he had a
chance to testify, had many ties to organized crime and
mysteriously came upon $7,000 before he silenced Os
wald.
The events following the assassination are no less
disturbing. There was wide-spread destruction and al
teration of evidence by the CIA, Federal Bureau of In
vestigation and the Warren Commission itself. The rea
son for this obfuscation of the truth is unclear, but the
possibilities are frightening. It is very possible that the
U.S. intelligence community was involved in Ken
nedy's death, at least indirectly. It is likely that Oswald
did not act alone but was a puppet for elements of or
ganized crime and intelligence. It is also possible that
the conservative right wing, upset at the direction the
United States was heading under the leadership of the
Kennedys, was involved in the plot.
Kennedy's assassination was a pivotal point in the
history of mankind. Through his United Nations am
bassador, Kennedy was moving toward the normaliza
tion of relations with Cuba. In Vietnam, he was
committed to removing U.S. troops already involved
there. The reversal of this policy by President Johnson
soon after Kennedy's death was a tragic mistake that

has stained the hands of the U.S. government with the
blood of innumerable human lives.
With Kennedy, we had an Administration that, above
all else, had a high ethical standard and a balanced un
derstanding of the travails of the common man, an un
derstanding that is sorely lacking in our government
today. Under the Kennedy Administration, we had sig
nificant progress in civil rights. The Kennedy broth
ers (Robert Kennedy was attorney general) were
waging a war against organized crime, a war which may
have claimed Kennedy himself as its ultimate casualty.
A treaty to ban atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons
was concluded at Kennedy's instigation. An active
dialogue with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev was
begun. A path to detente and a hopeful future for
mankind was being constructed.
Since Kennedy's death, our government has been
floundering. With Johnson, we suffered ill-advised in
volvement in Indochina. Richard "I am not a crook"
Nixon brought us the ignominy of Watergate. Ford was
a forgettable president whom Johnson suggested had
been hit in the head once too often while playing foot
ball for the University of Michigan. Next, we had
Carter — a president with his heart in the right place
but who was ineffectual because of a lack of political so
phistication. And now we have a slick grade-B movie
star who is playing more successfully on the stage of
life than he ever did in the celluloid world, a person
with a reckless disregard for human dignity. America,
we have lost our way to truth and justice.
Looking back at Kennedy's speeches, the words he
spoke during his lifetime seem even more relevant
today. On apartheid, at a time when it was not popular
to condemn the policy, he said in an address to the
United Nations: "I hope that not only our nation but all
other multiracial societies will meet these standards of
fairness and justice. We are opposed to apartheid and
all forms of human oppression. We do not advocate the
rights of black Africans in order to drive out white
Africans. Our concern is the right of all men to equal
protection under the law."
I would encourage every reader to review the texts
of Kennedy's speeches. They seem to define the is
sues relevant today, to separate the important from
the irrelevant.
On the occasion of Reagan's summit meeting with
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Kennedy's words
bear special relevance. At a speech at American Uni
versity in Washington, he said: "Let us not be blind to
our differences, but let us also direct attention to our
common interests and to the means by which those dif
ferences can be resolved. And if we cannot end now
our differences, at least we can help make the world
safe for diversity. For in the final analysis our most
basic common link is that we all inhabit this planet. We
all breath the same air. We all cherish our children's
future. And we are all mortal."
Our light to the future was extinguished on Nov. 22,
1963. We must strive to find the match that will light
the torch again for our generation and the generations
to follow.
