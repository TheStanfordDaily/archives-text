## SJC Has Drunk Driving Criteria 
### 
Steve Zahm's assertions in his
viewpoint "No More Res Ed
Games" (The Daily, Nov. 20) are
off the mark. Neither Residential
Education nor Assoc. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Norm Robinson was
responsible for last year's
precedent-setting decision con
cerning drunk-driving on campus.
That decision was made by Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy and
quoted at length in The Daily on
Oct. 4.

VIEWPOINT

It is not a "new Res Ed policy;" it
is not a Res Ed policy at all. It is an
application of the Fundamental
Standard to student misconduct
that involves driving drunk on
campus. The Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC), an annually
appointed body of students and fac
ulty, developed the logic and the
recommendations upon which Ken
nedy's decision was based. The SJC
opinion specified four critera to ap
ply in deciding whether drunk
driving on campus should fall within
the purview of the Fundamental
Standard. Those criteria are: 1) the
manner in which the vehicle was
driven; 2) the time and place in

which the vehicle was driven; 3) the
amount of alchohol or drugs in
gested by the driver and the
likelihood that they affected the
driver's mental and physical
faculties at the time of the violation;
and 4) the damage or injury, if any,
occasioned by the driver's conduct.
Zahm objects to "nebulous policies"
and lack of "real rules" without
recognizing that the purpose of
codes of student conduct at Stan
ford is to guide and encourage
thoughtful choice among behavioral
options. That is, at best, an educa
tional process that may include the
need to accept responsibility for
poor choices.
Introducing arbitrary but con
crete "rules" — e.g., if you are
drunk and drive recklessly within
1.7 miles of the center of Inner
Quad, the chances of being charges
with a Fundamental Standard viola
tion are 96 percent — would focus
attention on measuring distances
and evaluating probabilities rather
than on assessing an individual's
ability to behave responsibly. And
since it is behavior that is always the
issue, even concrete indicators —
however precise — could lead to
false evaluations and bad decisions.
In this area, as in others where

irresponsible behavior may be
viewed as a violation of the Funda
mental Standard, the key question
is whether a student's behavior
poses serious risks to lives, prop
erty or the rights of others. Those
evaluations are, in my view, best
made on a case-by-case basis,
guided by the SJC criteria outlined
above.
To close with a factual correc
tion, Zahm refers to Joseph Ander
son "being accused but not con
victed of drunken driving, resulting
in a "one-quarter, stayed suspen
sion." Mr. Anderson was accused

and found guilty of a violation of the
Fundamental Standard based on ir
responsible conduct while driving
drunk on campus. This is, accord
ing to the SJC and Kennedy, mis
conduct that warrants suspension
from the University. Mr. Ander
son's suspension was stayed and
replaced with probation because —
and only because — the decision
established a precedent about
which there was no advance notice
to the community.
