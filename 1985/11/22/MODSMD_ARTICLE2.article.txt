# Kennedy Supports Overseers
## Addresses Hoover board selection at Fac Sen meeting 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy called the Board of Trus
tees' approval of nominees to the
Hoover Institution's Board of Over
seers a "reasonable decision" at
yesterday's Faculty Senate
meeting.
The senate also heard a report
on the Graduate School of Business
(GSB) from Dean Robert Jaedicke,
the first such report since 1970.
At its Nov. 12 meeting, the
Board of Trustees approved a
seven-member slate of nominees
— including two current overseers
— to the Hoover Board of Over
seers. An identical list had been
proposed at a board meeting in
May, but the trustees, asking that a
more diverse group be found,
deferred a decision, according to
Michael Collins, a Council of Presi
dents member who was present at

a Nov. 11 trustees' meeting.
Explaining that continued defer
ral would result in a shortage of ac
tive overseers, Kennedy said the
Board of Trustees decided to ap
prove this slate and "seek the im
provements we regularly seek with
the next round of appoint
ments. . . . [Trustees] have been
responsive to requests in the past,
and I think they will be again."
The trustees will work with the
overseers to try to increase the
representation of minorities and
women on the Board of Overseers,
according to Kennedy.
The names of the approved
nominees will not be announced un
til they formally accept or reject
their appointments, according to
Kennedy.
In his GSB report, Jaedicke out
lined the diversity of the school's
754 students, including 635 MBA
candidates, 77 doctoral candidates,

and 42 members of the Sloan Man
agement program.
Despite the fact that minorities
and women comprise 33 percent of
the doctoral candidates, Jaedicke
called the GSB record on
minorities, "not terribly spectacu
lar."
To help alleviate this situation,
the GSB has produced a new
recruitment brochure that high
lights several recent minority
graduates, according to Jaedicke.
"We think it's going to do some
good," he said.
In addition, Stanford business
professors are targets for recruit
ment by other business schools,
Jaedicke said, noting that an in
creasing demand for business fac
ulty and a shortage of qualified doc
toral candidates coupled with the
boom in MBA programs throughout
the country has created a "tight"
faculty market.
