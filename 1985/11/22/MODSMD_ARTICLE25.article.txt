## Oakland Ballet Dances Up a Spectacular Storm 
### ALLISON HARTWELL Editorial staff 
Ballet requires more than flexibility, pointe work and
nice legs. As members of the Oakland Ballet proved
last weekend in Berkeley's Zellerbach Hall, the gift of
stage presence — the ability to entrance the audience
and not let go — is the key to a fine performance.
Topping the list of superb performers of the evening
was Summer Lee Rhatigan, who, as the mentor of
less-developed beings in "At a Time When . . . , "
dazzled the audience with her sheer strength and
beauty. The role, requiring somewhat "unballetic"
moves with flexed feet and sharp body angles, was
tailor-made for the leggy Rhatigan.
By mere virtue of her height, Rhatigan towered over
the other dancers in the ensemble. Yet she performed
with an added elegance and brightness that the other
dancers did not possess.
Choreographer Betsy Erickson produced a fulfilling
work from a dancer's point of view — the combinations
of slinky movements over prehistoric "rocks" scat
tered about the stage and light passages of allegro foot
work were challenging and innovative.
But from an intellectual standpoint, the choreog
raphy failed completely. The dancers occasionally
moved the rocks and interacted among themselves,
but none of their actions brought any meaning to the
piece. In the end, Rhatigan passed her headband to an
other dancer, Julie Lowe; this apparently symbolized
the coming of a new age. When the dancers turned the
gray rocks around to reveal reflectors, any thought
provoking potential the piece possessed was lost.
Another highlight of the program was the company's
production of "Bolero," set to the music of the same
title by Maurice Ravel. The piece had a stunning
opening — the curtains unveiled a completely open
auditorium with colored lights, the backstage totally
exposed as if the company were in a warm-up class.
Dancers stepped forward alone or in pairs to perform
small sections of the work, as if they were improvising
or merely fooling around in front of the class.
Joy Gim captured the Spanish character of the music
with a great flare, her seductive expression and
precise movements standing out from the rest of the
dancers. Susan Taylor was also striking, in a more

beautiful, softer way.
The opening number, "Synergies," was less inter
esting, but well-executed. Performed to Prokofiev's
"Piano Concerto No. 5," the ensemble was tight — the
footwork being very clean. Erin Leedom was espe
cially beautiful in the larghetto section, dancing with
ease and grace with the added touch of an expressive
smile.
"Lynchtown" and "Selections From the Seasons"
were less successful works of the evening.

"Lynchtown," consisting of men and women adorned in
the latest prairie fashions leapfrogging up and down the
stage, rated little on the scale of dancing and even less
on the scale of message. The dancers, who were
eagerly awaiting the hanging of a man, looked suffi
ciently bloodthirsty, yet were still uninteresting. The
work, though techniquely sound, was less provocative
than "At a Time When ..."
Abra Rudisell, as the frightened newcomer in the
primitive land in "At a Time When ..." and the Inciter

in "Lynchtown," demonstrated her gift of portraying
scary, angry and frightening roles. Her tiny body gave
her the ability to leap and jerk quickly and perform
amazing contortions. Yet in more classical works, such
as "Bolero" and "Selections From the Seasons," she
was unable to shake the scary expression from her
face, and appeared quite out of place.
"Selection From the Seasons," a classical ballet set
to music by Alexander Glazanov, was listless; not be
cause it was classic choreography, but because of the
impassionate dancing. A large portion of the work was
devoted to a pas de deux between Julie and Michael
Lowe, both of whom danced conservatively and with
out spark. Julie Lowe danced similarly throughout the
evening; even though given many important parts (in
"At a Time When ..." and "Bolero"), she failed to
shine.
The company's costumes were not spectacular —
like most ballet companies, the Oakland Ballet ap
parently does not have the budget for elaborate cos
tuming. However, the costumes for "Synergies" were
a displeasing combination of flourescent and dull hues;
this due to a lack of taste, not a lack of money.
What the company lacks most of all, however, is
strong male dancers. To its credit, the Oakland Ballet
managed to conceal this deficiency with clever
choreography. In a word, the men were uniformly dull
throughout the evening, so in most pieces they sup
ported the women.
This is not to say that partnering is not important,
for it is. But when Ron Thiele, Michael Lowe and Mario
Alonzo were to take the spotlight, as in "Bolero," they
failed to dazzle the most enthusiastic member of the
audience. Pirouettes were executed almost flat-footed,
and without energy. The most distinctive male per
former was Lowe, who exhibited his gymnastic skill,
not his dancing skill.
The company should take advantage of its female tal
ent more than it does. Rhatigan had a lengthy perfor
mance in "At a Time When . . . , " but then was not
seen again the entire evening. After her solo in
"Synergies," Leedom was not featured again either.
And most neglected of all, it seemed, was Gim, who
made a lasting impression in the final piece "Bolero,"
but was not featured before then. The company made
the mistake of hiding the bright performers instead of
showcasing them.

ent more than it does. Rhatigan had a lengthy perfor
mance in "At a Time When . . . , " but then was not
seen again the entire evening. After her solo in
"Synergies," Leedom was not featured again either.
And most neglected of all, it seemed, was Gim, who
made a lasting impression in the final piece "Bolero,"
but was not featured before then. The company made
the mistake of hiding the bright performers instead of
showcasing them.


Julie Lowe and Mario Alonzo grande jete in "Bolero," one of the works performed by the Oakland
Ballet in Berkeley last weekend.
Ballet requires more than flexibility, pointe work and
nice legs. As members of the Oakland Ballet proved
last weekend in Berkeley's Zellerbach Hall, the gift of
stage presence — the ability to entrance the audience
and not let go — is the key to a fine performance.
Topping the list of superb performers of the evening
was Summer Lee Rhatigan, who, as the mentor of
less-developed beings in "At a Time When . . . , "
dazzled the audience with her sheer strength and
beauty. The role, requiring somewhat "unballetic"
moves with flexed feet and sharp body angles, was
tailor-made for the leggy Rhatigan.
By mere virtue of her height, Rhatigan towered over
the other dancers in the ensemble. Yet she performed
with an added elegance and brightness that the other
dancers did not possess.
Choreographer Betsy Erickson produced a fulfilling
work from a dancer's point of view — the combinations
of slinky movements over prehistoric "rocks" scat
tered about the stage and light passages of allegro foot
work were challenging and innovative.
But from an intellectual standpoint, the choreog
raphy failed completely. The dancers occasionally
moved the rocks and interacted among themselves,
but none of their actions brought any meaning to the
piece. In the end, Rhatigan passed her headband to an
other dancer, Julie Lowe; this apparently symbolized
the coming of a new age. When the dancers turned the
gray rocks around to reveal reflectors, any thought
provoking potential the piece possessed was lost.
Another highlight of the program was the company's
production of "Bolero," set to the music of the same
title by Maurice Ravel. The piece had a stunning
opening — the curtains unveiled a completely open
auditorium with colored lights, the backstage totally
exposed as if the company were in a warm-up class.
Dancers stepped forward alone or in pairs to perform
small sections of the work, as if they were improvising
or merely fooling around in front of the class.
Joy Gim captured the Spanish character of the music
with a great flare, her seductive expression and
precise movements standing out from the rest of the
dancers. Susan Taylor was also striking, in a more

beautiful, softer way.
The opening number, "Synergies," was less inter
esting, but well-executed. Performed to Prokofiev's
"Piano Concerto No. 5," the ensemble was tight — the
footwork being very clean. Erin Leedom was espe
cially beautiful in the larghetto section, dancing with
ease and grace with the added touch of an expressive
smile.
"Lynchtown" and "Selections From the Seasons"
were less successful works of the evening.

"Lynchtown," consisting of men and women adorned in
the latest prairie fashions leapfrogging up and down the
stage, rated little on the scale of dancing and even less
on the scale of message. The dancers, who were
eagerly awaiting the hanging of a man, looked suffi
ciently bloodthirsty, yet were still uninteresting. The
work, though techniquely sound, was less provocative
than "At a Time When ..."
Abra Rudisell, as the frightened newcomer in the
primitive land in "At a Time When ..." and the Inciter

in "Lynchtown," demonstrated her gift of portraying
scary, angry and frightening roles. Her tiny body gave
her the ability to leap and jerk quickly and perform
amazing contortions. Yet in more classical works, such
as "Bolero" and "Selections From the Seasons," she
was unable to shake the scary expression from her
face, and appeared quite out of place.
"Selection From the Seasons," a classical ballet set
to music by Alexander Glazanov, was listless; not be
cause it was classic choreography, but because of the
impassionate dancing. A large portion of the work was
devoted to a pas de deux between Julie and Michael
Lowe, both of whom danced conservatively and with
out spark. Julie Lowe danced similarly throughout the
evening; even though given many important parts (in
"At a Time When ..." and "Bolero"), she failed to
shine.
The company's costumes were not spectacular —
like most ballet companies, the Oakland Ballet ap
parently does not have the budget for elaborate cos
tuming. However, the costumes for "Synergies" were
a displeasing combination of flourescent and dull hues;
this due to a lack of taste, not a lack of money.
What the company lacks most of all, however, is
strong male dancers. To its credit, the Oakland Ballet
managed to conceal this deficiency with clever
choreography. In a word, the men were uniformly dull
throughout the evening, so in most pieces they sup
ported the women.
This is not to say that partnering is not important,
for it is. But when Ron Thiele, Michael Lowe and Mario
Alonzo were to take the spotlight, as in "Bolero," they
failed to dazzle the most enthusiastic member of the
audience. Pirouettes were executed almost flat-footed,
and without energy. The most distinctive male per
former was Lowe, who exhibited his gymnastic skill,
not his dancing skill.

ent more than it does. Rhatigan had a lengthy perfor
mance in "At a Time When . . . , " but then was not
