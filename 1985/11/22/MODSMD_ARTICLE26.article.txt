# Festival Showcases Cartoons a Cut Above Saturday Morning

Producing even a short animated feature
over the quality level of Saturday morning
cartoons is a serious commitment — finan
cially risky, and involving an incredibly
painstaking amount of artistic labor. That is
why the "Festival of Animation," which
played to sold-out houses at the New Var
sity Theatre last weekend, was such a
treat.
The festival, produced annually by the
San Diego-based animation enthusiasts
known as Mellow Manor Productions, pro
vided a rare showcase for animation
features that are truly labors of love. Full
length features, consisting of images drawn
with individual eels that run 24 per second,
are rare today because of the investment of

time and money. Even a a three- or four
minute cartoon short routinely involves
something around a $50,000 budget.
But despite the costs, fine animation is
being produced, as demonstrated by last
weekend's festival. Sixteen films from dif
ferent parts of the world were showcased
— all of which showed amazing inventive
ness through various techniques.
Clay animation is a marvelously
manipulative medium, exhibiting a surreal
three-dimensional effect. Utilizing this
medium was a 1967 episode of Art Clokey's
television series, "Gumby and Pokey." The
feature was fun, but a rudimentary effort
compared to Will Vinton's stunning "The
Great Cognito," in which a stand-up comic
literally transforms himself into the heroes
he is imitating — from Churchill and Patton
to the Andrew Sisters singing "Boogie

Woogie Bugle Boy." Vinton's "claymation"
method, for which he has woi. an Academy
Award, recently gained him work on the
special effects team for Disney's recent
feature, "Return to Oz."
The no-holds-barred dream reality of
Max Fleisher, whose classic Betty Boop
short, "Snow White" was shown, was
echoed in Marv Newland's "Hooray for
Sandbox Land," in which an impending tidal
wave threatens to destroy the happy-go
lucky toy animals and children that inhabit
the rather absurd, giddy Utopia of Sandbox
Land. Newland, best known for his own
cult classic, "Bambi Meets Godzilla,"
produced the film as a safety film for the In
surance Corporation of British Columbia.
The current Academy Award winner,
"Charade," by Canadian Jon Minnis,
succeeds on the strength of its running

joke, a game of "charades" in which a
dauntless player is unable to successfully
communicate his titles, even after going to
the extent of catching bullets in his teeth
and flying through the air to denote the
movie "Superman."
Also shown was the mesmerizing 1983
Academy A ward-winning "Tango," which
uses about 30 live actors all animated to
repeat a cycle of action within one room.
Distinctly musical in its conceptual
structure, it is not surprising that Zbigniew
Rybcyinski, the film's Polish animator, is
now one of the more renowned rock video
artists.
Canadian Richard Condie's "The Big
Snit" was touted by the festival organizers
as a probabale candidate for an Oscar next
year. This hilariously loony eight-minute
tale of a couple who argue over such in

anities as a game of scrabble and the hus
band's obsessive penchant for sawing the
furniture while a nuclear war rages outside
is inspired insanity.
Some older gems demonstrated the abil
ity to be vastly philosophical within anima
tion's imposed limitations of succinctness:
Hungarian Marcel Jankouics' "Sisyphus," a
two-minute rendition of the Greek myth;
Italian Bruno Bozzetto's "Self Service," an
astute comment on economic greed and ex
pansion featuring a cast of rather humanly
gluttonous mosquitoes; and Michael Mill's
Reader's Digest version of civilization,
"History of the World in Three Minutes
Flat."
Animation is in some ways the ultimate
film form — the limits are truly the bounds
of the imagination and the energy of its
creators, as these artists show.
