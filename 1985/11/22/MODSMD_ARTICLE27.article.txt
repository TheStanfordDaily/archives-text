# Murphy's 'Quiet Earth' Paints Chilling Glimpse of the Future
## 
### DAVID WILLATS Staff writer 
"The Quiet Earth," directed by Geoff Murphy, is a
philosophically challenging, apocalyptic film that is
nevertheless quite accessible because of the concrete
and unpretentious treatment of its characters. Films of
this type can easily become emotionally heavy morality
plays, but "The Quiet Earth" avoids this pitfall by
fusing humor with drama and by questioning more than
moralizing.
The story takes place in New Zealand, where the
film was made. It is sunrise, and Zac Hobson (played
by Bruno Lawrence) awakes abruptly from a startling
psychedelic vision of swirling colors and changing
forms. He arises to discover that all animal and human
life on earth has seemingly disappeared. Cars have
been abandoned in the streets, office buildings are
empty and planes have crashed for want of a pilot.
Physically, his world is unchanged except that all
human beings have simply vanished. He is alone, con
demned to a life of total isolation.
Initially Zac explores the possibilities of his situation.
Being the only person left, he has total power and
freedom. "Time I moved up in the world," he says as
he settles into the mansion of his choosing. Before the
catastrophe, Zac had been a straight-laced research
scientist on an international defense project, which im
plicates him in the disaster. Now, with no social limita
tions, he experiments with other societal roles. He
wears a dress, he plays the saxophone in the rain, and
so on. His life would be perfect were it not for the utter
loneliness and intense guilt that he feels.
He is finally adjusting to his new life when he dis
covers that he is not alone. He encounters another sur
vivor, an energetic young woman named Joanne
(Alison Routledge). Later, a Maori Indian, Api (Peter
Smith), enters the picture. Together these three must
try to live in harmony under the everpresent strain of a
changing and unstable universe.
In light of the recent events that have brought New
Zealand into the international spotlight, "The Quiet

Earth" is a very timely film. The nuclear overtones of
the plot are obvious, and one of the central themes of
the film deals with the question of personal responsibil
ity in matters of universal importance. With the
declaration of a "nuclear free" zone in the South
Pacific, New Zealand (population 3.2 million) has exhib
ited a remarkable will toward personal control in mat
ters of international importance.
This theme of self-governance is manifested
throughout the film. Joanne's persistent questioning of
the male role in the proliferation of nuclear weapons
and Api's fierce Maori pride reflect New Zealand's con
demnation of the arms race. Zac's rationale for his in
volvement in the defense project is that the United
States had been withholding information regarding the
life-threatening nature of his work. His excuse is pa
thetic, but all too real. We are all responsible for
developments of global importance, but most of us
refuse to acknowledge it. Api summarizes the main
question of the film with the demand, "How can you
change something that you don't understand?"
This theme alone makes for an interesting and dra
matic social statement, but the filmmakers aim for, and
achieve, much more. The film succeeds on many
levels. It is dramatic, funny, very philosophical, and on
the whole quite aesthetically pleasing. One is im
pressed by the strange realness of this fantastical sit
uation. The characters are multi-dimensional, torn be
tween intellect and desire, responsible for their plight
yet tossed about helplessly by a new and alien world.
The humor of the film is refreshing and appropriate
because it emanates from the characters and the irony
of their situation. At one point Zac is watching a
videotape of a "pre-holocaust" debate, which seems, in
light of recent events, totally absurd. With bloodshot
eyes and a haggard look he takes a shotgun and blasts
the television apart. The recoil of the gun sends him
toppling over the back of his chair, a comic symbol of
his own helplessness. There are several good one
liners which complement the action because they
originate from the characters' own views on the
humorous nature of their predicament.
The characterizations are for the most part well

done. The depiction of Zac's psychological metamor
phosis during his isolation is excellent. With the addi
tion of each new person the dynamic changes dramati
cally, and the mood of the film reflects these changes.
The Edenic bliss of Zac and Joanne's relationship is
effectively rendered by means of airy lighting and inti
mate close-ups. The tone changes when Api arrives.
With the whole world to themselves, the three live in
disharmony, in a menage a trois reminiscent of Sartre's
"No Exit." There is a general darkening of setting, and
their alienation is communicated through increased use
of long shots.
The cinematography (by cameraman James Bartle)
is strikingly eloquent. The direction, although dis
jointed at times, is ambitious and lively. The film has an
Hitchcock air, both in plot and use of technical devices
that Hitchcock popularized.
"The Quiet Earth" does have its weak points. The
plot is inconsistent at times, and the film isn't as emo
tionally powerful as it could be. Some of the themes are
not sufficiently developed, not for want of desire, but
because of a basic lack of understanding. Api's Maori
roots are introduced as an important component of his

personality, but are never really connected to the
storyline. It is is if the writers thought his racial iden
tity was significant, but they didn't know why.
The film takes on an intellectually feminist stance
that is finally undermined by the filmmakers' funda
mentally sexist orientation. Joanne's condemnation of
the "all-male club playing God with the universe" is an
admirable statement that is, in the end, essentially
empty because her character is never really developed
as a counterpoint to Zac's typically male-oriented
belief system. It is ludicrous that the only woman left
alive should be young, beautiful, and ready to fall in
love with the first man that comes along.
The problematic nature of Joanne's relationship to
Zac raises questions concerning the nature of reality in
the film. It is never really clear what is going on. Is this
Zac's dream? Is he going crazy? Are there alternate
universes? Throughout the film there is a constant
shifting of perspectives which intentionally leaves the
viewer on uncertain ground. The final shot, which is
spectacularly beautiful, only heightens the ambiguities.
"The Quiet Earth" is a very entertaining and thought
provoking film.
