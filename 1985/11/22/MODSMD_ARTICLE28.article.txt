# 'Bring On the Night' Brings Out the New Sting
## 
### GEOFFREY MINTER Staff writer 
"Bring On the Night" is an exhilarating
experience. It documents the preparations
Sting and his new band made for their first
concert, featuring charts from their
premier album, "The Dream of the Blue
Turtles." Sometimes the film has that sus
picious look of propaganda — like an exten
sive plug for the "new Sting" — but, at its
core, "Bring On the Night" is an enthusias
tic celebration of the band's music, one that
invites the movie audience backstage to
share all the excitement.
Director Michael Apted ("Coal Miner's
Daughter," "Firstborn") is no stranger to
documentaries. He began his career in
1963 with "Seven Up," a documentary that
recorded the lifestyles and thoughts of 14
seven-year-old children. Every seven
years since then, Apted has gone back to
interview the children and show much they
have changed. (The latest in the series, "28
Up," was a hit at this year's Filmex in Los
Angeles, and Apted is currently looking for

a distributor for the film.)
"Bring On the Night" is like a hybrid of
Apted's Hollywood and documentary
works. The "Seven Up" series is about as
low-budget as films should be allowed to
get. "28 Up" was a beautiful film, but
technically, it looks like something
originally shot in Super 8 blown up to 35mm
film; and, of course, it had no stereo.
But it does have that gritty, realistic
crassness you expect from modern
documentaries, the kind that indicates real
people were filming other real people under
real conditions.
"Bring On the Night," which is showing
in some theaters in 70mm with the best
Dolby Stereo money can buy, is a far cry
from Apted's earlier techniques, and it's not
too difficult to see the immense planning
that went into the film.
Nearly every shot is well-lit and ex
tremely colorful. In his private interviews,
Sting is surrounded by darkness save for
one light shining toward the left side of his
face, giving him an inspired, "truthful"
glow. It's in these interviews that Sting
talks about his career and his life in general.

"Pop music is dead," he says, citing rac
ism in the recording and broadcast indus
tries. He's very sincere, and probably
right, but dramatic lighting like this only
helps to cheapen the sentiment. It's as if
Apted (or Sting) wanted to make sure the
audience gets the message. It should be

'Pop music is
dead,' Sting says,
citing racism in the
recording and
broadcasting industries.

noted that the other band members give
their interviews without benefit of such
divine interpretation.
True cinema it ain't, but for all its pre
planned meaning, "Bring On the Night"
manages to keep its spontaneity about 95

percent of the time. It also has a very
strong sense of family, one that's re-in
forced whenever Sting and the band are to
gether rehearsing or performing.
Each band member gets to tell a little
about him or herself. Branford Marsalis,
who plays saxophone, says he doesn't want
to be a star, and feels like "puking"
whenever stars come to visit Sting in
rehearsal. He says playing with the band is
fun, and it really doesn't matter to him if it
flops because he's flopped before. Listening
to the other members, we find out one of
the female background singers used to be a
schoolteacher, and the other used to work
in a whorehouse.
Scenes of the group in rehearsal are
great fun. Apted places the camera in the
middle of things; we're on the floor with
everybody else, overlooking Sting when he
sings, cutting to Marsalis whenever he has
a sax solo or getting a close-up of drummer
Omar Hakim whenever he begins to
boogie.
The music (depending on whether you
like the album or not) is really the high point
of the film. The songs are even more lively

on screen because they are being per
formed in front of us without benefit of ex
tensive studio re-mixing. As an added
treat, there are some songs in the movie
that aren't on the album. Sting and back
ground singers Dolette McDonald and
Janice Pendarvis get down on one soul
number that had everyone in the theater
audience clapping (I can't figure out why the
song didn't make the album). And, of
course, one of the film's highlights is the
group's rendition of the "Flintstones"
theme.
The actual concert footage is a little less
exciting because it lacks the intimacy of the
rehearsals, which were held in a cramped
room of an old French estate. The music's
still good, however, and the group is even
more frenzied than it was in the earlier
rehearsals.
The film succeeds as a document of the
group's first album and concert perfor
mance, but gets bogged down at times by
Sting's public relations drive. However,
these moments are few and far between,
and "Bring On the Night" emerges as a
great film.
