Hedonism hit the High Sierras
when South Lake Tahoe opened for
business. In addition to spectacular
natural scenery, awesome skiing
and unlimited 24-hour entertain
ment, Tahoe is home to a select
group of hotels that strive to help
guests live out their wildest fanta
sies.
Californians who think that heart
shaped jacuzzies and mirrored
ceilings are unique to the Niagara
Falls have never seen South Lake
Tahoe. Lake Tahoe sits on the
California-Nevada border sur
rounded by the majestic, alpine
mountains. In search of the perfect
Sierra den of hedonism, we
sampled three of area's best
known hotels. All three of these
resorts garnered an easy A plus on
Cupid's Romance Scale.
Caesars Tahoe
Our first stop was at Caesars
Tahoe. This glamorous resort
casino is one of the area's best

known. Befitting its regal name,
Caesars offers exceptionally ele
gant accommodations at surpris
ingly affordable rates. Each of the
446 stylish rooms is tastefully
decorated. Extravagant luxury
befitting an emperor is Caesars'
forte. Most rooms offer huge,
round Roman tubs, chiffon
draperies, soft, suede furnishings
and a choice of regular or round
king-sized beds with overhead mir
rors. All rooms have two televi-

sions, one in the bedroom and an
other in the bathroom. Cable
movies are offered free of charge.
Service is also a Caesars
touchstone. Rooms are made up
twice each day, if requested. The
hotel is also home to one of the
world's most spectacular health
clubs. The Alpine Health and Rac
quet Center is a $3.2 million
wonder. It houses a natural rock
lagoon-swimming pool and jacuzzi,
complete with islands and water
falls.

Even if not staying at Caesars,
you should check out the hotel's
casino, which is one of the largest
casinos and showrooms on the lake.
For those unfamiliar with gaming,
the hotel offers free lessons with
non-negotiable chips each weekday
from 11 a.m. to noon on the main
casino floor. Lessons are given for
dice, blackjack and Pai Gow. For
hotel guests the in-room televisions
have continuous lessons on every
game in the casino on channel 2.

Caesars showroom will feature
The Pointer Sisters through Nov.
24. Joan Rivers is scheduled to ap
pear Nov. 28-30.
Room rates for Caesars Tahoe
Resort start at $90 per night,
double occupancy. Most rooms are
identical, but rates for top-floor
rooms are slightly higher. The
resort also offers several excellent
money-saving Ski Packages. Three
nights with two days of skiing starts
at $199 per person, double oc
cupancy. The single rate is $259.

Ski packages include luxurious ac
commodations, taxes, all day lift
tickets at Heavenly Valley and free
ski shuttle service, as well as some
meals. Caesars Tahoe Resort
reservations can be made by calling
800-648-3353 or through any travel
agent.
Fantasy Inn
For those seeking pure plea
sure, the Fantasy Inn is your
port of call. There are three Fan
tasy Inns at Tahoe, two in South
Lake Tahoe and one in Tahoe City.
Of the two South Shore inns, Fan
tasy No. 1 is newer and nicer.
Fantasy's adult rooms are de
signed for pure escapist pleasure.
The rooms are decorated in deep,
rich colors. Our room was a deep
red with red carpeting extending
across the floor and up the walls to
the mirror-covered ceiling. Rooms
are available both with or without
in-room spas and with choice of
king or queen beds (regular or
waterbeds). The spa rooms come
with complimentary bubble bath for
an added touch of fun. All rooms
have cable television complete with
erotic movie channel. Upon check
in Fantasy Inn provides all guests
with a complimentary bottle of Cali
fornia wine. Optional whipped
cream can be purchased at the su
permarket across the street. Most
rooms have refrigerators and coffee
machines.
Some of the spa rooms have
square tubs, while others have
heart-shaped spas, If you plan on
having guests over, ask for a room
with a square tub, as they are much
larger. Request a room as far from
the road as possible as Route 50
runs near a few of the chambers.
Fantasy's room rates vary signifi
cantly. Midweek rates start at $48
per room without a spa. Midweek
spa rooms are $72 for queen-size
beds and $78 for kings. Spa rooms
are $92 (queen) and $100 (king) on
Fridays. Saturday rates go up
again, with spa rooms letting for
$112 (queen) and $120 (king).
Rooms without spa cost $78 per
night on both Friday and Saturday
nights.
Reservations for Fantasy Inn can
be made by calling 916-544-1580 or
by writing: Fantasy Inns, P.O. Box
6008, South Lake Tahoe, CA
95729.
Pacifica Lodge
For those seeking quieter ac
commodations than the huge casino
towers offer, Pacifica Lodge is an

excellent choice. The Lodge is
located off Highway 50 on Park Av
enue, less than a block from the
lake. While the Lodge offers
numerous regular hotel-style
rooms, its several "theme" rooms
are well worth the few extra dol
lars.
As a part-time activities director
aboard cruise ships, I couldn't
resist asking for Pacifica's
"Captain's Quarters" room. This
spacious room featured a fireplace,
heart-shaped sunken whirlpool spa,
wet bar and refrigerator. True to
its name, the room was done up in a
nautical theme with brass fixtures,
ship's wheels and lanterns.
The room (No. 118) enjoys an
excellent view of the lake from the
bedroom. A large king-sized bed
with overhead mirror faces the
warm fireplace in the bedroom. The
heart-shaped whirlpool spa is lo
cated in its own mirrored room so
the steam doesn't drift into the

bedroom. There is also a separate
bathroom with shower and chang
ing room. The Lodge delivers cof
fee and donuts free each morning to
guests. The lodge has a similar
room with a queen-sized waterbed
called the "Queen of Hearts." Both
the Captain's Cabin and the Queen
of Hearts cost $80 per night.
Pacifica also offers several spa
units without fireplace for $75 per
night. Coming in either Roman or
Egyptian themes, these rooms all
have heart-shaped whirlpool spas,
wet bars and choice of either king
sized regular beds or king sized
waterbeds. Spa units without
fireplace go for $75 per night.
The Lodge's standard fireplace
units are extra large and provide an
excellent bargain at only $60 per
night ($5O midweek). Regular
rooms and waterbed rooms start at
only $45 per night ($35 midweek).

Wooded alpine mountains blanketed with snow are among the many pleasing sights that South
Lake Tahoe affords. Hikes and ski treks can afford breathtaking views while providing pleasant
aerobic diversions.

Set against the beautiful Sierra Nevada mountains, Caesars
Tahoe provides inside diversions, such as gambling and nightly
entertainment, as a refuge from the mountain weather.
For groups, the lodge has
several chalets which sleep six in
two bedrooms. The chalets have
full kitchens, fireplace and living
room. Chalets are only $100 per
night. Two-bedroom suites without
fireplaces are available for only $70
per night ($65 on midweek).

Lake Tahoe is considered by
many to be one of the world's most
beautiful alpine lakes. It has
managed to maintain its beauty
despite the increasing pressures of
urbanization. Tahoe's icy water is
amongst the clearest anywhere.
Underwater visibility often exceeds
200 feet.
South Lake Tahoe offers an ideal
combination of urban entertain
ment, outdoor activities and natural
beauty. The southern tip of the lake
is officially split between the towns
of South Lake Tahoe (California)
and Stateline (Nevada). The Cali
fornia side of the border offers
literally hundreds of hotels along
with some of the most beautiful
public lands in the state. Miles of
wilderness are open for explora

tion. The Nevada side is host to 24-
hour entertainment with several
major casino hotels and resorts.
Both states boast exceptional
skiing. The huge Heavenly Valley Ski
Area spans portions of both states.
It is America's largest ski resort
with over 20 square miles of ski ter
rain served by 26 lifts. Heavenly
boasts an amazing 3,600-foot verti
cal drop. Other nearby ski areas in
clude Kirk wood, Sierra Ski Ranch
and Echo Summit (mostly beginner
runs).
Nordic skiing is available both at
most major ski areas as well as on
the excellent public lands nearby.
State park rangers offer guided na
ture walks for those with Nordic
skis or snowshoes on weekends
(not available in most of Decem
ber). For information on these free
hikes, send a self-addresed
