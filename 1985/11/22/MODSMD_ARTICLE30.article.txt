As I walked into the brightly-lit
Seven Seas Restaurant, I had the
strange feeling that I had stumbled
onto the set of a Humphrey Bogart-
Lauren Bacall film.
Scattered patrons looked up dis
interestedly as we entered, then
continued with intense conversa
tions, intense books or papers, or
intense perusal of the food on their
plates. Two waitresses, who
looked like mother and daughter,
hurried among the tables and
booths, and took no notice of our
presence. We seated ourselves in a
booth behind a man in a Stetson hat
and a trench coat, who smoked
while he talked seriously with the
blonde woman sitting opposite him.
Seven Seas Restaurant seems to
be an amalgam of just about every
element of American culture that
can be imagined. The plastic chairs
and booths remind one of the inside
of a Denny's or a Bob's Big Boy.
Several Oriental decorations hang
from random locations around the
restaurant, and a big Chinese-New
Year dragon covers the top half of
one wall. At each booth, Kikkoman
soy sauce is placed next to a big
sugar-container, while ketchup and
mustard containers compete for
space with the conventional ash
tray. On the far wall are hung
several beer plaques, and the
kitchen is clearly visible to anyone
sitting with his or her back to the
street.
The menus that the waitress
places on the table offer everything
from hot Szechuan specialties to
Mandarin fare, from vegetarian
Chinese dishes to veal cutlets, from

eggrolls and rice to steak and
potatoes. In my ignorance of the
variety of this place, I had geared
myself up for a purely Chinese
menu. I was not, however, disap
pointed in the variety of the
Chinese dishes offered. It amazed
me that such a small, seemingly
family-operated restaurant could of
fer such a wide variety of food.
Anyway, we decided to splurge.
First we got the seaweed soup
($3.60). We got a huge taureen
(huge for two people, anyway) of
soup, and served ourselves in two
unmatching soup bowls. The soup
was excellent. Dark- and light
green pieces of seaweed combined
with dropped egg and little chunks
of chicken meat. It was hot, perfect
for the cold evening, and light
tasting, so we still felt hungry after
we had each had one bowl.
While we were still eating our

soup, the waitress brought the two
egg rolls ($1.85) that we had also
ordered. I put aside my soup to get
the egg rolls while they were hot,
but Doug, enamored of the
seaweed soup, decided to finish
one thing before he started an
other. The egg rolls were also very
good, stuffed with the conventional
vegetables, and so hot it was al
most impossible to hold them.
Before I had a chance to start on
the second half of my allotted egg
roll, the waitress brought the two
entrees that we had ordered. Of
course, I immediately dove into my
sweet and sour pork ($4.60), while
Doug still struggled with the soup
and egg roll. The sweet and sour
sauce was very good; the pork,
however, seemed a little chewy. I
would have preferred slightly crispy
pork in this dish, but the pieces of
onion and bell pepper coupled with

the sauce were truly satisfying.
When I had satisfied my craving
for that great sweet and sour
flavor, I dished up some of the
meatless chow mein ($3.15). I
found this dish very bland, but
Doug liked it. We had ordered the
crunchy, deep-fried noodles, rather
than the soft noodles, which for me
redeemed the otherwise boring
texture and flavor of this chow
mein.
The last dish to be served was
the fried rice with lop chow ($3.50),
which was unfortunate, since I like
to have the rice first, so that the
entrees can be piled on top of it.
The fried rice, however, was good.
The rice itself was cooked nearly
perfectly, and the bits of vegetable
and lop chow mixed into it provided
q flnrr**-

After the man with the Stetson
and trench coat left, the restaurant
lost much of its romantic charm.
Still, I enjoyed the intense feeling of
"real Americana" that Seven Seas
Restaurant gave me. I would not,
however, recommend this restau
rant for dinner. Twenty dollars is

too expensive for two students to
have Chinese food. I'd rather spend
the money on a real sit-down, table
cloth, dim-lights type of place, es
pecially for dinner.
But for a late-afternoon snack of
soup or egg rolls or rice, Seven
Seas Restaurant is ideal. The best
time to go would be just before or
just after seeing a film at one of the
downtown theaters.
Here's looking at you, kid.

egg rolls ($1.85) that we had also
ordered. I put aside my soup to get
the egg rolls while they were hot,
but Doug, enamored of the
seaweed soup, decided to finish
one thing before he started an
other. The egg rolls were also very
good, stuffed with the conventional
vegetables, and so hot it was al
most impossible to hold them.
Before I had a chance to start on
the second half of my allotted egg
roll, the waitress brought the two
entrees that we had ordered. Of
course, I immediately dove into my
sweet and sour pork ($4.60), while
Doug still struggled with the soup
and egg roll. The sweet and sour
sauce was very good; the pork,
however, seemed a little chewy. I
would have preferred slightly crispy
pork in this dish, but the pieces of
onion and bell pepper coupled with

the sauce were truly satisfying.
When I had satisfied my craving
for that great sweet and sour
flavor, I dished up some of the
meatless chow mein ($3.15). I
found this dish very bland, but
Doug liked it. We had ordered the
crunchy, deep-fried noodles, rather
than the soft noodles, which for me
redeemed the otherwise boring
texture and flavor of this chow
mein.
The last dish to be served was
the fried rice with lop chow ($3.50),
which was unfortunate, since I like
to have the rice first, so that the
entrees can be piled on top of it.
The fried rice, however, was good.
The rice itself was cooked nearly
perfectly, and the bits of vegetable
and lop chow mixed into it provided

After the man with the Stetson
and trench coat left, the restaurant
lost much of its romantic charm.
Still, I enjoyed the intense feeling of
"real Americana" that Seven Seas
Restaurant gave me. I would not,
however, recommend this restau

too expensive for two students to
have Chinese food. I'd rather spend
the money on a real sit-down, table
cloth, dim-lights type of place, es

But for a late-afternoon snack of
soup or egg rolls or rice, Seven

time to go would be just before or
just after seeing a film at one of the

Seven Seas Restaurant
443 Emerson

As I walked into the brightly-lit
Seven Seas Restaurant, I had the
strange feeling that I had stumbled
onto the set of a Humphrey Bogart-
Lauren Bacall film.
Scattered patrons looked up dis
interestedly as we entered, then
continued with intense conversa
tions, intense books or papers, or
intense perusal of the food on their
plates. Two waitresses, who
looked like mother and daughter,
hurried among the tables and
booths, and took no notice of our
presence. We seated ourselves in a
booth behind a man in a Stetson hat
and a trench coat, who smoked
while he talked seriously with the
blonde woman sitting opposite him.
Seven Seas Restaurant seems to
be an amalgam of just about every
element of American culture that
can be imagined. The plastic chairs
and booths remind one of the inside
of a Denny's or a Bob's Big Boy.
Several Oriental decorations hang
from random locations around the
restaurant, and a big Chinese-New
Year dragon covers the top half of
one wall. At each booth, Kikkoman
soy sauce is placed next to a big
sugar-container, while ketchup and
mustard containers compete for
space with the conventional ash
tray. On the far wall are hung
several beer plaques, and the
kitchen is clearly visible to anyone
sitting with his or her back to the
street.
The menus that the waitress
places on the table offer everything
from hot Szechuan specialties to
Mandarin fare, from vegetarian
Chinese dishes to veal cutlets, from

eggrolls and rice to steak and
potatoes. In my ignorance of the
variety of this place, I had geared
myself up for a purely Chinese
menu. I was not, however, disap
pointed in the variety of the
Chinese dishes offered. It amazed
me that such a small, seemingly
family-operated restaurant could of
fer such a wide variety of food.
Anyway, we decided to splurge.
First we got the seaweed soup
($3.60). We got a huge taureen
(huge for two people, anyway) of
soup, and served ourselves in two
unmatching soup bowls. The soup
was excellent. Dark- and light
green pieces of seaweed combined
with dropped egg and little chunks
of chicken meat. It was hot, perfect
for the cold evening, and light
tasting, so we still felt hungry after
we had each had one bowl.
While we were still eating our

soup, the waitress brought the two
egg rolls ($1.85) that we had also
ordered. I put aside my soup to get
the egg rolls while they were hot,
but Doug, enamored of the
seaweed soup, decided to finish
one thing before he started an
other. The egg rolls were also very
good, stuffed with the conventional
vegetables, and so hot it was al
