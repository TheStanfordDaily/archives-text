China Lion Restaurant

Two benevolent lions guard
the laquered doors of The China
Lion, a friendly Oriental restau
rant specializing in Mandarin and
Szechuan cuisine. Located at
3345 El Camino, it is about a 15-
minute bike ride from campus,
and definitely worth the trip.
Owned by chef Samson Chu,
brother of the well-known "Chef
Chu" who owns the Los Altos
restaurant of the same name,
The China Lion presents a cor
dial, friendly atmosphere. The
red-laquered pillars and silk
light-shades create a warm
feeling, and soft, rather nonde
script music fills the air, allowing
for comfortable conversation.
The back room has a wall of win
dows that offers a pleasant view
of a well-tended garden filled
with jade trees and cacti. This
garden surrounds an outside
patio that looks to be a pleasant
place to have lunch, weather
permitting.
The service was very impres
sive. As soon as we were
seated, the waiter presented us
with hut lia and an excellent ap
petizer of gingered cabbage.
Throughout the meal, the waiter
was courteous and helpful, res
ponding quickly to any requests
that we had. The food was
served fairly promptly, consider
ing that each dish was prepared
individually after the order was
taken. Small touches such as hot

towels and fortune cookies after
dinner offered a pleasant
surprise, capping off the meal
with style.
As an appetizer, we ordered
the po-po platter ($6.95). This
rather spectacular dish contained
several small appetizers: egg
rolls, spare ribs, beefsticks and
foil-wrapped chicken, which we
heated over a flaming cast-iron
grill. This dish was an excellent
choice, because it offered a sam
pling of each appetizer selection.
All of the morsels were very
good, although the spareribs
were slightly overdone.
We ordered three main
dishes: shrimp with sizzling rice
($6.95), sweet and sour pork
($5.75), and bamboo shoots with
black mushrooms ($5.25). The
shrimp were very large and
tender, and they blended well
with the sauce and crisp fried
rice, giving the dish a rather
savory flavor.
The sweet and sour pork was
a little overdone and the sauce
was slightly imbalanced,
seeming more sweet than sour,
but it was still an enjoyable dish.
The vegetarian dish was
pleasantly surprising. The mush
rooms and bamboo shoots
blended well in a slightly power
ful sauce, contributing to a satis
fying vegetarian dish.
Overall, the food was deli
cious, the steamed rice we or
dered was perfectly cooked, and
every dish was made well and
with great care.
China Lion Restaurant has a
full range of dishes which will
satisfy almost any palate, includ
ing dinner specials that are
priced under $10 per person and
include appetizers and two main
courses. The menu includes
many vegetable dishes which can
be made meat-free upon re
quest. It is quite possible to en

joy an elegant dinner for two for
about $20. The food is excellent,
the service outstanding and the
atmosphere comfortable and not
crowded.
The China Lion is certainly
comparable to the best-known
restaurants in Palo Alto, espe
cially if you want to enjoy an ele
gant dinner in a relaxing atmos
phere.
