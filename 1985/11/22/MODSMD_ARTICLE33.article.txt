## All That's Left is Big Game 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
The Play has been played out.
It's been three long years since the Miracle — or
Travesty — at Memorial Stadium, three years since
UC-Berkeley's Kevin Moen took a squib kickoff on the
Cal 43 with four seconds left and Stanford leading 20-
19.
Five laterals, a trombonist and a official conference
later, Cal had a 25-20 victory in the 85th Big Game,
and Stanford had an unparalleled motive for revenge.
The loss meant a lot to the Cardinal players who
were on the field and on the sideline that day. Quarter
back John Elway, who had led a last-ditch drive in the
final moments of the game to put Stanford ahead, called
it the worst day of his life. Defensive tackle Mike
Wyman didn't say anything: he just ripped the door off
the locker room.
The next two Big Games — a 27-18 Cal win in Stan
ford Stadium and a 27-10 Stanford victory in Berkeley
— bristled with emotion left over from The Play. Is
revenge a motivating factor? the reporters would ask
in the days before the games, and the Stanford players
would nod grimly.
Ask that question this week and you get a different
response.
"I've tried to put that out of my mind," said inside
linebacker Matt Soderlund, one of a handful of people
left from the team who saw action on Nov. 20, 1982.
"It's just another part of Big Game history. It's not a
major deal anymore."
Most of the Stanford and Cal players who will stream
into Stanford Stadium on Saturday for the 88th Big
Game weren't even around three years ago. They've
heard about it, but it's like a piece of trivia: it's interest
ing, but it has no direct effect on them.
So maybe it's time we put The Play to rest. There's
plenty of other reasons to get psyched for Stanford-
California; we can spare that one.
Cardinal Coach Jack Elway came up with a new one
this week anyway. He rounded up the players after
practice on Thursday and told them they wouldn't be

wearing suits and ties to the Hyatt Palo
Alto on Friday night, as they had done for
every home game since time out of mind.
Instead, he said, you will get on the
buses in work clothes. And you will travel
to the game in work clothes. No more crap
about the aristocrats from Stanford. We've
got a job to do Saturday, and we're going to
dress like it.

As you can see, even though he has only
been on the Farm for two years, Elway has
still managed to come down with one of the
biggest cases of the Big Game fever in the
Bay Area.
"We literally look at this season in two
halves," he said Monday, "And the second
half starts right now. I've had the game on
my mind for a long while, and I know the
other coaches and players have too."
"I'm getting excited for Cal," cornerback
Toi Cook said. "I want to go out with a win,
a blowout. I just want to have a good game
and kick Cal's ass."

To do that, the Cardinal will have to shut
down the Bears' potent triumverate of
backs. Ed Barbero (571 yards), freshman
sensation Marc Hicks (515 yards) and
Dwight Garner (356 yards) have run
roughshod over opponents, leading Cal's
384 yards-a-game offensive attack.
"They keep their offense on the field for
a long time, in terms of moving the chains
with a power running attack," Elway said.
"But just because (the running game) is
their strength doesn't mean they can't
throw the ball."
Stanford's offense will be a tricky

hodgepodge of the shotgun, the power-I,
the two-tight end, the slotback, the split
backfield . . . you get the idea. In last
year's victory, the Cardinal ran the ball
down the Bears' throat, piling up a season
high 322 rushing yards. That won't be the
case tomorrow.
"There's a different personnel this year,
a different personality," Elway said. "Last
year we went with the misdirection running
game because we had a lot more strength
on the offensive line than they did in the de
fensive interior."
The biggest fo* on the Bears' defense

is junior linebacker Hardy Nickerson, who
has racked up 155 tackles so far this year.
The Cal pass defense has allowed only
185.7 yards a game this year.
But they'll have their work cut out for
them when quarterback John Paye fires up
the 271 yards-a-game Cardinal passing at
tack.
"I think there'll be excitement both ways
as far as offense is concerned, and then it'll
settle into a defensive effort," predicted El
way.
And if Stanford's lucky, the game won't
have to be decided by a Play.
