## All That's Left is Big Game 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
The Play has been played out.
It's been three long years since the Miracle — or
Travesty — at Memorial Stadium, three years since
UC-Berkeley's Kevin Moen took a squib kickoff on the
Cal 43 with four seconds left and Stanford leading 20-
19.
Five laterals, a trombonist and a official conference
later, Cal had a 25-20 victory in the 85th Big Game,
and Stanford had an unparalleled motive for revenge.
The loss meant a lot to the Cardinal players who
were on the field and on the sideline that day. Quarter
back John Elway, who had led a last-ditch drive in the
final moments of the game to put Stanford ahead, called
it the worst day of his life. Defensive tackle Mike
Wyman didn't say anything: he just ripped the door off
the locker room.
The next two Big Games — a 27-18 Cal win in Stan
ford Stadium and a 27-10 Stanford victory in Berkeley
— bristled with emotion left over from The Play. Is
revenge a motivating factor? the reporters would ask
in the days before the games, and the Stanford players
would nod grimly.
Ask that question this week and you get a different
response.
"I've tried to put that out of my mind," said inside
linebacker Matt Soderlund, one of a handful of people
left from the team who saw action on Nov. 20, 1982.
"It's just another part of Big Game history. It's not a
major deal anymore."
Most of the Stanford and Cal players who will stream
into Stanford Stadium on Saturday for the 88th Big
Game weren't even around three years ago. They've
heard about it, but it's like a piece of trivia: it's interest
ing, but it has no direct effect on them.
So maybe it's time we put The Play to rest. There's
plenty of other reasons to get psyched for Stanford-
California; we can spare that one.
Cardinal Coach Jack Elway came up with a new one
this week anyway. He rounded up the players after
practice on Thursday and told them they wouldn't be
