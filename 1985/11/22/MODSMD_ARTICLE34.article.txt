# Cal-Stanford Rivalry: Tradition's Everything
## 
### 
As Big Game week rolls on
toward its annual climax tomorrow
afternoon, the bigness of the week
becomes more apparent, while the
bigness of the game almost begins
to pale.

The last time anything important
hinged on Big Game was 1982,
when Stanford was 5-5 going in and
had a Hall of Fame Bowl invitation
with a victory. Then again, going to
a bowl game with a 6-5 record is
like going to your high school prom
in your dad's old Buick station
wagon — you're happy to be going,
but embarassed about how you got
there.
Of course, a ridiculously im
probable and illegitimate 57-yard
kickoff return was allowed to
negate Mark Harmon's field goal
that had given Stanford a 20-19 vie

tory with four seconds remaining,
and the Cardinal finished 5-6.
The fact is that neither team has
been to a bowl game since Califor
nia received a much-coveted bid to
the illustrious Garden State Bowl in
1979. That game no longer exists.
Stanford hasn't played a 12-game
season since Bill Walsh led the
plural Cardinals to the 1978
Bluebonnet Bowl.
Neither has won the conference
and gone to the Rose Bowl since
the 1971 season, when Stanford
downed Michigan in the 1972 game.
Cal hasn't gone to the Rose Bowl
since 1959, and hasn't won since
1938. Stanford's only national
championship was in 1926. Cal has
never won one.
So winning traditions aren't an
issue — recently for Stanford,
never for Cal. As for being the big
gest win of the year, it won't be for
either team. Cal's shocking upset of
USC and Stanford's triumph over
Arizona to knock the Wildcats from
the Rose Bowl chase were bigger.
For the Stanford side, it appears
winning the final game of the season
is more important than winning the
game against California. "You al
ways want to win the big, tradi
tional game, but it's always our last

game," Coach Jack Elway said. "It's
important to go out with a win. I
think it has a positive effect on
everything you do in the offseason."
So the importance is not that the
game — the 60 minutes of football,
the competition on the gridiron, the
athletic endeavor that will take
place between 1 and 4 p.m. tomor
row — is against the California
Bears. The importance lies in the
tradition that makes it Big Game.
There are many big rivalries
being played tomorrow around the
country. Some like Oregon-Oregon
State and Kansas-Missouri mean
nothing in the standings. Some like
Oklahoma-Nebraska and Ohio
State-Michigan usually determine
conference championships. But few
have the tradition that Big Game
has.
Start with the story behind the
Stanford Axe, of how it was stolen
and smuggled across to Berkeley,
of how the Immortal 21 restored to
its rightful place, and of the many
attempts to duplicate that theft.
Then there are the traditional
events: the annual production
known as Gaieties, the march and
rally through the streets of San


JOHN
LIS
Francisco, the resurrected
bonfire in Lake Lagunita, the
"Beat Cal" signs everywhere
from Roble Hall to the South
Pole. And the pranks, ranging
from the innocuous, like
releasing painted mice in the
opponents library, to the
sacreligious and criminal, like
the desecration of Memorial
Church early yesterday
morning.
I called a couple dozen
other schools playing their big
games tomorrow, asking
what traditional events they
had. There were an oc
casional trophy, a few on-cam
pus rallies and a couple of

intercollegiate newspaper
touch football games (none
rivaling the Ink Bowl), but
nothing close to the tradition
that surrounds the biggest an
nual sporting event in North
ern California.
Elway can hope for a Big
Game when both teams are
10-0 and it decides the Rose
Bowl berth, but it's not this
year. For this week, it's not a
big game, but it remains Big
Game.
And, to add to the thoughts
of the venerable and revered
coach of the University of
California at Berkeley, "The
Bear will not quit, the Bear
will not die, the Bear will not
win." Stanford: 27-17.

The last time anything important
hinged on Big Game was 1982,
when Stanford was 5-5 going in and
had a Hall of Fame Bowl invitation
with a victory. Then again, going to
a bowl game with a 6-5 record is
like going to your high school prom
in your dad's old Buick station
wagon — you're happy to be going,
but embarassed about how you got
there.
Of course, a ridiculously im
probable and illegitimate 57-yard
kickoff return was allowed to
negate Mark Harmon's field goal
that had given Stanford a 20-19 vie

tory with four seconds remaining,
and the Cardinal finished 5-6.
The fact is that neither team has
been to a bowl game since Califor
nia received a much-coveted bid to
the illustrious Garden State Bowl in
1979. That game no longer exists.
Stanford hasn't played a 12-game
season since Bill Walsh led the
plural Cardinals to the 1978
Bluebonnet Bowl.
Neither has won the conference
and gone to the Rose Bowl since
the 1971 season, when Stanford
downed Michigan in the 1972 game.
Cal hasn't gone to the Rose Bowl
since 1959, and hasn't won since
1938. Stanford's only national
championship was in 1926. Cal has
never won one.
So winning traditions aren't an
issue — recently for Stanford,
never for Cal. As for being the big
gest win of the year, it won't be for
either team. Cal's shocking upset of
USC and Stanford's triumph over
Arizona to knock the Wildcats from
the Rose Bowl chase were bigger.
For the Stanford side, it appears
winning the final game of the season
is more important than winning the
game against California. "You al
ways want to win the big, tradi
tional game, but it's always our last

game," Coach Jack Elway said. "It's
important to go out with a win. I
think it has a positive effect on
everything you do in the offseason."
So the importance is not that the
game — the 60 minutes of football,
the competition on the gridiron, the
athletic endeavor that will take
place between 1 and 4 p.m. tomor
row — is against the California
Bears. The importance lies in the
tradition that makes it Big Game.
There are many big rivalries
being played tomorrow around the
country. Some like Oregon-Oregon
State and Kansas-Missouri mean
nothing in the standings. Some like
Oklahoma-Nebraska and Ohio
State-Michigan usually determine
conference championships. But few
have the tradition that Big Game
has.
Start with the story behind the
Stanford Axe, of how it was stolen
and smuggled across to Berkeley,
of how the Immortal 21 restored to
its rightful place, and of the many
attempts to duplicate that theft.
Then there are the traditional
events: the annual production
known as Gaieties, the march and
rally through the streets of San


JOHN
LIS
Francisco, the resurrected
bonfire in Lake Lagunita, the
"Beat Cal" signs everywhere
from Roble Hall to the South
Pole. And the pranks, ranging
from the innocuous, like
releasing painted mice in the
opponents library, to the
sacreligious and criminal, like
the desecration of Memorial
Church early yesterday
morning.
I called a couple dozen
other schools playing their big
games tomorrow, asking
what traditional events they
had. There were an oc
casional trophy, a few on-cam
pus rallies and a couple of

intercollegiate newspaper
touch football games (none
rivaling the Ink Bowl), but
nothing close to the tradition
that surrounds the biggest an
nual sporting event in North
ern California.
Elway can hope for a Big
Game when both teams are
10-0 and it decides the Rose
Bowl berth, but it's not this
year. For this week, it's not a
big game, but it remains Big
Game.
And, to add to the thoughts
of the venerable and revered
coach of the University of
California at Berkeley, "The
Bear will not quit, the Bear
will not die, the Bear will not
win." Stanford: 27-17.
