# Card Cagers Open Tonight in San Jose
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff sportswriter 
Coach Tara VanDerveer likes a challenge.
That's why she's one of best women's bas
ketball coaches in the country.
At Ohio State University, she spear
headed one of the more dominant programs
at the NCAA level. Understandably, there
were those in Buckeye country who ques
tioned her decision at the end of last year to
succeed Dotty McCrea as coach of Stanford
women's basketball, a program that, well,
hasn't been exactly dominant during the last
two seasons (14-42 overall). But VanDer
veer eagerly anticipated the challenge.
However, little did she anticipate the
onslaught of injuries that would beset Stan
ford prior to the start of the 1985-86
season.
"If coming here was a challenge, some

one's trying to make it more of a challenge,"
VanDerveer said stoically after assessing
the team's list of casualties.
This cataclysmic list of injuries, looking
more like a result of some bellicose brawl
than a "non-contact" sport, includes: two
backs, three knees, one foot and an ankle.
Stanford's first game of the season will be
against Hawaii tonight in the San Jose State
Tournament. The Cardinal will be without
the services of last year's freshman All-
America Kami Anderson, Stanford's leading
scorer at 14.7 points per game. She also
was second in rebounding, pulling down 5.9
boards an outing.
Two weeks ago, a soar ankle forced An
derson to sit out a few practices. Further
examinations revealed a stress fracture,
and now the 6-0 forward is not expected to
return to the lineup until
Christmas.
Another starter, 6-foot-1
junior forward Karen
Goedewaagen (5.3 points and
4.3 rebounds a game) has suf
fered a knee injury that may
force her to miss a great deal
of the season.
Probably the most disap
pointing news to emerge from
the recent wave of mishaps
was the announced retire
ment of 6-3 center Sarah
Evans. As a sophomore,
Evans contributed 12.3 points
and 6.7 rebounds to the Card
inal cause. Last year, a painful
back injury forced her to red
shirt the entire season.
The nagging injury plagued
Evans throughout her come
back attempt, which ended
Monday, when she decided to
call it quits. A successful
return would have meant a
great deal of playing time for
the Ohio native; her contribu
tion to the Cardinal will un
doubtedly be missed.
"Injuries are something
that you have little control
over," said VanDerveer.
"Other people are going to
have to pick up the slack —
it's that simple. There's no
sense in crying over it."
