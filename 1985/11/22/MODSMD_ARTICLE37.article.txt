# Swimmers Beat Cal 41-18

### MARY K. McDEVITT Staff writer 
They call it a "double-distance" meet,
and in each race they swam twice as many
laps as they usually do. But at their debut
competition against the UC-Berkeley yes
terday, Stanford women didn't fall short of
success by any measure.
Sweeping both the 400-yard backstroke
and the 2,000-yard freestyle and unoffi
cially garnering more than twice as many
points as the California contingency, the
Cardinal captured the unofficial meet 41-
18.
Unofficial scoring notwithstanding, the
win was a sweet one for the Cardinal,
ranked No. 2 nationally behind last year's
title winner Texas.
The Bears are ranked seventh. "It was
great," senior Kathy Smith said. "We
solidly put them in their place."
Smith, a team co-captain along with
senior Diana Zock, who did not compete
due to illness, won the 400-yard
breaststroke for the Cardinal, finishing
nearly two seconds ahead of Cal runner

up Amy Clark .
The highly touted Stanford freshman
competed well.
Home town teammates Michelle
Donahue and Jenny Shannon, from
Portland, Ore., and the Multnomah Swim
Club, led a sweep in the 400-yard back
stroke. "It shows how strong we are in
backstroke," Donahue, who edged Shan
non 4:29.16 to 4:31.14, said. "I knew it
would be close between us. I didn't know
who Cal had so I thought most of the com
petition would come from my teammates.
Jenna Johnson, a 1984 Olympic gold
medalist and member of the 1985 U.S.
National Team, anchored the winning 800
freestyle relay with an impressive 1:50.6
200-yard split. She also was third in the
400-yard freestyle, a distance event she
rarely swims because her greater talent
lies in sprinting.
"Actually I wasn't too excited about
(the double distance events). 1 think most
people like to swim what they're good at
and I don't think I'm really that good at
distance. I looked at (today's meet) as a
challenge."
Sophomore Stacy Shupe led a sweep in

the 2,000-yard freestyle, a race longer
than the mile, which is the traditional mar
athon in national and international compe
tition.
Junior Susan Rapp, a 1984 Olympic
medalist who specializes in breaststroke
but is swimming mostly freestlye now due
to knee injuries, and senior Lisa Hazen
captured second and third, respectively.
Some Cal swimmers showed they too
are approaching top form. Mary Meagher,
1984 Olympic gold medalist, finished the
400 butterfly over one lap ahead of the
second-place finisher — Lassen, a Stan
ford freshman— with a winning time of
4:12.35.
The Stanford team began workouts in
late September, a month later than many
teams such as powerhouse Texas. "We've
been working real hard from the very
beginning to catch up with them,"
Donahue said. "Now I think we're catch
ing up to and have gone ahead of a lot of
schools."
Hazen said the meet, which opened the
1985-86 season, increased team morale.
"It was really good for getting us going for
the rest of the season," she said.
