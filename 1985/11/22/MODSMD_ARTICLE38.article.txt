# 'Big Splash' Starts Saturday's Festivities
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff writer 
The Stanford water polo team is
ranked No. 1 in the nation, has
clinched the Pacific-10 Conference
title and has already earned a berth
in the NCAA Championships.
The UC-Berkeley water polo
team is ranked No. 5 in the nation,
is currently last in the Pac-10 and
is far away from a berth in the
NCAAs.
When the two teams face off at
De Guerre Pool tomorrow at 10:30
a.m. in the "Big Splash" of the
season, it would appear that the
Cardinal has very few incentives to
win the match, in comparison to
Berkeley's "must-win" incentives.
That could hardly be farther from
the truth.
"We really want to win this
match, not only to avenge last
year's (13-12) Big Splash loss,
and not only to avenge our
one-goal loss in last year's NCAA
final," Stanford water polo coach
Dante Dettamanti said. "Our in
centive tomorrow is not one that's
dwelling on the past. We are looking
toward the future . . . one week
beyond to the NCAA Champion
ships.
"If we can beat Cal tomarrow,
we can almost guarantee that they
will not earn a berth in the NCAAs.
Keeping them out certainly would
give us a better chance of winning
the championships. The thought of
an NCAA title is certainly incentive
enough for our team. The players
are really hungry for that title."

After last weekend's 6-5 victory
at Cal, the Cardinal proved it has
the talent to defend its top national
ranking. Why then is Dettamanti
worried about the Bears? A look at
Cal's starting line-up certainly
gives a pretty good answer.
"Man-for-man, Cal has more tal
ent than any team in the nation, "
Dettamanti said. "If you take a look
at Cal's top 12 players, each and
every one is a fabulous water polo
player. If they make it to the
NCAAs and finally put all that talent
together, they could easily have a
shot at the title, no doubt about it."
Though Berkeley does have an
edge over Stanford in "overall per
sonnel talent," the Cardinal is not
without its exceptional talents.
"Many of the players on our team
have been playing together for
three years now, and they really
know how to 'put it together.' "
Dettamanti said. "The experience
of the players as a team certainly
gives us an advantage, as does our
strong play in the hole."
According to Dettamanti, al
though the Bears' have very few
weaknesses, Berkeley's talent in
the hole is perhaps the most lacking
area for the team. Though
Berkeley has five players that play
the hole, "Cal really doesn't have
anyone outstanding that can really
play the hole for them."
Stanford, on the other hand, is
blessed with two very talented
holeman, namely Craig Klass and
Erich Fisher.
Klass, a junior, is the Cardinal's
leading scorer this season with 48
goals.
