# Stanford Sinks Berkeley Without Three of Its Stars
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Right now, the Stanford men's swimming team is
ranked No. 1 in the nation. When ranking, the NCAA
considers the entire team. Based on the results of its
last two meets, the Cardinal could be No. 1 even with
out its entire team.
Yesterday, five days after it trounced No. 3 Texas,
host Stanford beat No. 5 UC-Berkeley, 60-35. The
Cardinal triumphed in both these meets without either
Pablo Morales or Jeff Kostoff, both Olympians. Yester
day afternoon, the Cardinal didn't have Olympian John
Moffet, who was attending a funeral.
To be fair, California was also missing a few of its
best swimmers, according to Cardinal Coach Skip Ken
ney. Among those absent was Olympian Matt Biondi,
who Kenney called the Bears' "catalyst." So both
teams were not at full strength. Cal's performance
showed it; Stanford's performance did not.
"Our team probably swims better without our big
guns than any other team I've seen," Kenney said.
"Maybe it's because of our depth."
That seems to be a good guess on Kenney's part.
When a team's "big guns" are not swimming and that
team still enjoys the services of the likes of Dave
Louden, Matt Nance and Sean Murphy, that team has
depth.
Louden captured the most exciting of the after
noon's races with a strong effort in the 200-meter
freestyle. From the time the Louden and his opponent
from Berkeley, Michael Soderlund, surfaced after their
starts until the Cardinal junior edged ahead at 150
meters, the competitors were neck and neck. To add

to the drama, the swimmers were in adjacent lanes,
numbers six and seven.
Louden said he was expecting a tough race from
Soderlund. His thinking during the head-to-head com
petition was to "race with him for the first 150, then in
the last 50 I tried to pass him." His attempt was suc
cessful, and he touched the wall about a little more than
a second ahead of Soderlund. Louden's time was
1:56.38.
Later in the meet, Louden took the 400-meter
freestyle in a romp, seven seconds ahead of the
second-place finisher. He said he would have preferred
another tough race, and that his time it would have
been better "if I had somebody right next to me."
This was a much different meet from the intense
competition against Texas. There were no starting
blocks or official times kept yesterday. "Today was a
low-key, low-pressure meet," Louden said.
It was a cold meet, too. Louden said that the more
experienced swimmers don't have a problem with the
inclement weather. "It didn't make any difference to
me," he said.
The relaxed atmosphere of the meet made it difficult
for the swimmers to psyche themselves to do their
best. "It's really hard to (get up for such a meet),"
Louden said.
For a while now, Stanford will need only to get up for
practice, with their first real meet not until January.
Kenney is looking to fine tune his team. He'd like to
develop a base of long-distance swimming that the
team can count on for the rest of the season.
Moreover, Kenney's confident of his team's talent
and attitude. He doesn't see a pressing need to
motivate his swimmers for the upcoming campaign.
"They're dedicated to doing their best," he said.
