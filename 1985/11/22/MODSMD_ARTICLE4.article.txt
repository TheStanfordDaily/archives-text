# Experts Consider Soviet Reporting Of Summit Talks
## 
### MARY K. McDEVITT Staff writer 
Soviet domestic television news
programs analyzing this week's su
perpower summit indicate a chang
ing image of President Reagan from
a "demon" comparable to Adolf Hit
ler to a more "tractable" leader, ac
cording to experts here who moni
tored the broadcasts via a satellite
tracking system designed at Stan
ford.
Speaking at a press conference
yesterday at the Meyer Library
Language Laboratory, Dennis
Ross, executive director of the
Berkeley-Stanford Program on So
viet International Behavior, said the
new image will involve a "de
demonizing" of the president.
"Reagan will become more trac
table (in the Soviet's presenta
tion). ... He may become what
they have always wanted him to
become — (former President)
Nixon," Ross said.
Ross was joined in the press con
ference by Soviet dissident
Vladimir Bukovsky, a Stanford doc
toral student here currently con
ducting research in psychology. An
outspoken proponent of human
rights, Bukovsky is the author of
"To Build a Castle," a book that
details his experiences in Soviet
prison and psychiatric camps.
Bukovsky said the TV broad
casts reveal Gorbachev's success in
"projecting an image of a vigorous
leader, to increase hopes and vigor
and therefore production."
Such an image is crucial for Gor

bachev because the Soviet eco
nomy is in decline and"the situation
is one of doom and gloom,"
Bukovsky said.
"(Gorbachev) was given a
mandate for certain reforms —
(though) not specifically or politi
cally. His only chance is to go to the
West, to improve relations. ... He
even said everything is intercon
nected internally and externally,"
Bukovsky said.
Ross noted that in the broad
casts, Gorbachev is presented as a
strong leader in two distinct ways.
On the one hand, he is portrayed as
"a leader on the world stage" and "a
man of hope" in a way that will help
him by' "building (his) authority,
particularly with the Soviet
(communist party) congress
meeting in a couple of months." On
the other, Gorbachev is heralded as
a leader who "can manage relations
with the United States," Ross said.
Ross also noted the emphasis the
Soviet news placed on the cordial
relations between Gorbachev and
Reagan immediately following the
summit.
Such positive images, particu
larly with relation to the communist
party, are important because Gor
bachev is a new leader and his
power within the hierarchy of the
system needs to be established, ac
cording to Ross.
The political consequences of the
genial relations between Reagan
and Gorbachev will be beneficial but
are unlikely to last, according to
Ross.
