# Grapplers Tangle Davis
## Wiggen will watch from sideline 
### PETER CASTILLO Staff writer 
Wrestling, like most sports at Stanford, languishes in
obscurity. So while most people are thinking about the
Big Game, the Cardinal wrestling team will open its
dual-meet season tonight when it hosts UC-Davis at 7
p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
The Stanford wrestling team had a 8-6-1 dual-meet
record last year and finished 34th in the NCAA Cham
pionships. The team has five returning seniors.
Tonight's meet will be one of only four home meets
this season.
"Since two of our top leaders are question marks we
will need a little luck to remain competitive, for any in
jury could decimate our dual-meet potential," Coach
Chris Horpel said.
"If everything is perfect we could win the Pac-10
Championships and finish in the top 10 at the NCAA
Championships, but it is a little unrealistic, for there
are too many 'ifs.' Yet, I am setting my goals that high
so the guys will work for it."
Senior All-America Scott Wiggen, who wrestles in
the 150 pound weight class, will likely sit out the year,
using his redshirt option. Wiggen, who was ranked
fourth in his weight class by a national preseason poll,
set a school record for victories with a 37-17 record
last year. Wiggen will be replaced tonight by senior Jeff
Hazard.

Wiggen's decision to redshirt or not seems to rest
upon the health of Jeff Bradley. Bradley, last year's
Pac-10 champion who suffers from a neck injury, will
suit up this evening. But if, for some reason, he is
forced to the sideline, Horpel has suggested that he
might go with Wiggen later in the year.
Sophomore Dave Lee (167 pounds) returns after an
outstanding first year in which he broke the school
record for victories, along with Wiggen, with a 37-8-2
record. He also captured the Pac-10 crown for his
weight class.
Also returning will be junior Kurt Kassulke (190
pounds) and senior Pete Rogers (158 pounds).
"This was not a very good recuiting year, and the
better recuits are injured so we can't rely on any fresh
man until next quarter," Horpel said.
"The problem in recuiting is that there are maybe 20
blue-chip wrestlers who have the academic strength to
get into Stanford. The task is finding them and then
they still might not be thinking of Stanford. Unless we
get a championship we won't be their first choice."
Horpel feels that the Cardinal should be favored
tonight, but noted that UC-Davis will be tough because
the Aggies always get psyched-up for their annual dual
match with Stanford.
Last year, the Cardinal triumphed 25-19.
