Confident of victory, the Stanford fencing
teams will meet the Bears at Berkeley today
at 4 p.m.
A continuation of a rivalry begun in 1915,
this meet, according to Cardinal Coach Buzz
Hurst, "should honestly be something of a
mismatch. We fenced them late in the season
last year and really thumped them." The
Stanford men beat the Bears 23-4 and the
women triumphed 14-2.
The Berkeley teams constitute a
"relatively experienced organization" said
Hurst but "we have a stronger team on the
men's side than last year, and we are
supposed to have a considerably stronger
women's team the last year."
Although the Bears have a home-gym ad
vantage, Hurst believes that "(Stanford) will

honestly have no problems, given the posi
tions of the two teams."
In the men's teams, Hurst is looking for
strong performances out of Andy Goorno,
the sabre captain, and Elliott Cheu, the foil
captain. He also expects "good things" from
epee fencers Larry Murk and Vince Brad
shaw.
The Cardinal coach expects a solid showing
from foilist Holly Taylor, a junior. "I suspect
that she is due for an impressive shot this
time around,' Hurst said. His only concern is
that a slight knee injury Taylor suffered from
a bicycle accident earlier this week might
slow her down. However, Hurst feels that
there is no reason to believe that she will not
be ready for today's meet.
Overall, Hurst believes that the Stanford
teams will fence well at Berkeley. "Spirits are
high and we are prepared for this match,"
Hurst said, "but anything can happen in a
meet like this."
