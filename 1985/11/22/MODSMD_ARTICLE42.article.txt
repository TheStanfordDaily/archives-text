# It's the Greeks' Last Hurrah...
## 
### 
To quote Kenny Loggins: This is it. The
final week in the college football season (as far
as we're concerned) and the final Greek of the
Week.
Thanks again to Stickney's Hick'ry House
restaurant and everyone who participated in
last week's contest. David Wright, a graduate
student in statistics, won the contest with a 9-
1 record and by picking Arizona State by seven
points over Stanford.
For his performance, Wright won a dinner
for two at Stickney's, not to mention the incal
culably valuable honor of being this week's
Guest Greek.
"I was working on a crossword puzzle and
got nowhere, so I decided to pick the games.
It was pretty much random. There were a few
teams I hadn't heard of, like Bowling Green,"
Wright said.
Wright picked Stanford to win tomorrow,
saying, "Stanford is the home team, so let's go
with them. Stanford is clearly the better
team." The pick made sense in light of
Wright's having picked the home team in all 10
games last week. Only Georgia failed to please
the home folks against Auburn.

To quote Kenny Loggins: This is it. The
final week in the college football season (as far
as we're concerned) and the final Greek of the
Week.
Thanks again to Stickney's Hick'ry House
restaurant and everyone who participated in
last week's contest. David Wright, a graduate
student in statistics, won the contest with a 9-
1 record and by picking Arizona State by seven
points over Stanford.
For his performance, Wright won a dinner
for two at Stickney's, not to mention the incal
culably valuable honor of being this week's
Guest Greek.
"I was working on a crossword puzzle and
got nowhere, so I decided to pick the games.
It was pretty much random. There were a few
teams I hadn't heard of, like Bowling Green,"
Wright said.
Wright picked Stanford to win tomorrow,
saying, "Stanford is the home team, so let's go
with them. Stanford is clearly the better
team." The pick made sense in light of
Wright's having picked the home team in all 10
games last week. Only Georgia failed to please
the home folks against Auburn.
