Senate Passes China Nuke Deal
WASHINGTON — The Senate, moving quickly after months of
objections by liberal senators, yesterday approved President
Reagan's long-delayed agreement to share nuclear power technology
with China.
On a voice vote with neither debate nor opposition, senators
cleared the way for U.S. companies to begin negotiating contracts to
supply materials and equipment to China's ambitious nuclear pro
gram.
A similar resolution is pending in the House, but to block the
agreement, both chambers would have had to pass resolutions of dis
approval by Dec. 11, the expiration date of a 90-day period in which
Congress could veto the pact. The agreement, first initialed last
year during President Reagan's trip to China, had been held up be
cause critics led by Sen. Alan Cranston (D.-Calif.) feared that China
would share its nuclear technology with Iran, Pakistan and other na
tions.
Overruling Administration objections on an 11-3 vote, the commit
tee made any shipments of material or equipment under the pact
conditional on Reagan receiving firm assurances that China would not
divert fissionable material to any nation trying to assemble a bomb.
Another restriction reserves to the United States the authority to
refuse China permission to reprocess spent reactor fuel supplied un
der the agreement.
Irish Parliament Ratifies Accord
DUBLIN, Ireland — After three days of intense debate, the Irish
Parliament yesterday ratified the Anglo-Irish agreement aimed at
promoting peace in Northern Ireland.
Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald won a narrow 88-75 endorse
ment for the historic accord he signed last week with his British
counterpart, Margaret Thatcher.
Results of the vote, read to a packed house in Ireland's native
Gaelic langauge, removed the only significant obstacle to implemen
tation of the agreement, which is expected to go into force after ap
proval next week by the British Parliament, where it has the support
of all major parties.
The agreement is the first formal attempt by the two countries to
join forces in reducing the level of sectarian violence that has claimed
more than 2,500 lives in Northern Ireland since 1968.
The accord gives the Republic of Ireland a formal, consultative
role in Northern Ireland for the first time ever, but also requires
Ireland to recognize British sovereignty there for the foreseeable
future.
S. African Police Fire on Crowd
MAMELODI, South Africa — Ten blacks were reported killed
here yesterday when riot police opened fire on thousands of anti
government demonstrators and the crowd stampeded in panic, tram
pling many who fell.
Although police headquarters in Pretoria acknowledged its forces
had fatally wounded two persons, a man and a woman, in attempting
to break up the protests, a reporter for a black newspaper counted
10 bodies at the local clinic, some of them the victims of the stam
pede, and witnesses told of seeing six or eight bodies lying in the
street, apparently lifeless, after the incident.
The final death toll is likely to be "as much as 20," said a commu
nity activist who was present, and this would rank the clash among
the worst in 15 months of civil unrest in which more than 850 per
sons, most of them black, have died.
The clash brought the unrest for the first time on a large scale to
Pretoria, the country's administrative capital.
Rumors continued to circulate, meanwhile, that the minority white
government is planning to release Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned
leader of the outlawed African National Congress, perhaps allowing
him to go into exile, in an effort to create a climate for political
negotiations that would end the civil strife here.
But President Pieter Botha told newsmen in Pretoria yesterday
afternoon, "No decision has been taken." He did not elaborate, but
aides said the countrywide speculation is "without foundation — a
sheer fantasy."
Court Sentences French Agents
AUCKLAND, New Zealand — This nation's highest judge sen
tenced two French secret agents to 10 years in prison today for
manslaughter in the bombing of the Greenpeace flagship Rainbow
Warrior. He said the punishment was meant to deter terrorism.
Maj. Alain Mafart, 35, and Capt. Dominique Prieur, 36, also
received seven years each for willful damage to the ship, which was
blown up and sunk in Auckland Harbor on July 10. They will serve
the two sentences concurrently and wfll be eligible for parole in five
years.
"The courts must make it plain that persons coming into this
country cannot expect a short holiday at the expense of the govern
ment and return home as heroes," said Sir Roland Davison, chief
justice of the Auckland High Court.
The Rainbow Warrior was sunk by mines and a Greenpeace pho
tographer, Fernando Pereira of the Netherlands, was killed in the
blast.
Greenpeace had sent the ship to New Zealand to lead a protest
flotilla against French nuclear tests in the Mururoa Atoll in the South
Pacific.
Brad Giles, one of three defense lawyers for the agents, told
reporters it is "much too early" to talk about whether there will be an
appeal. "We must sit down and assess it in a quiet and reasoned
way." The defendants have 10 days to appeal.
Waite Sees 'Progress' in Talks
BEIRUT — Special Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite — pinned
in the office of an international news agency by gunfire and grenades
in the latest inter-Moslem battle in west Beirut — said yesterday
that he was making progress in his efforts to gain freedom for four
American hostages but that "we have a long way to go yet."
"Keep calm. We're making progress," Waite said in The Associ
ated Press office as fighting raged in the streets below.
Waite, 46, is the emissary of the Archbishop of Canterbury,
Robert Runcie, the spiritual head of the church of England.
The worst fighting in months swept across the Moslem-controled
half of the Lebanese capital, trapping Waite in the AP bureau as he
prepared a statement only minutes before a scheduled news confer
ence. Waite said he had planned to fly to Cyprus yesterday afternoon
and then on to New York today for meetings with U.S. State Depart
ment officials and members of the Episcopalian and Presbyterian
churches.

leader of the outlawed African National Congress, perhaps allowing
him to go into exile, in an effort to create a climate for political
negotiations that would end the civil strife here.
But President Pieter Botha told newsmen in Pretoria yesterday
afternoon, "No decision has been taken." He did not elaborate, but
aides said the countrywide speculation is "without foundation — a
sheer fantasy."
Court Sentences French Agents
AUCKLAND, New Zealand — This nation's highest judge sen
tenced two French secret agents to 10 years in prison today for
manslaughter in the bombing of the Greenpeace flagship Rainbow
Warrior. He said the punishment was meant to deter terrorism.
Maj. Alain Mafart, 35, and Capt. Dominique Prieur, 36, also
received seven years each for willful damage to the ship, which was
blown up and sunk in Auckland Harbor on July 10. They will serve
the two sentences concurrently and wfll be eligible for parole in five
years.
"The courts must make it plain that persons coming into this
country cannot expect a short holiday at the expense of the govern
ment and return home as heroes," said Sir Roland Davison, chief
justice of the Auckland High Court.
The Rainbow Warrior was sunk by mines and a Greenpeace pho
tographer, Fernando Pereira of the Netherlands, was killed in the
blast.
Greenpeace had sent the ship to New Zealand to lead a protest
flotilla against French nuclear tests in the Mururoa Atoll in the South
Pacific.
Brad Giles, one of three defense lawyers for the agents, told
reporters it is "much too early" to talk about whether there will be an
appeal. "We must sit down and assess it in a quiet and reasoned
way." The defendants have 10 days to appeal.
Waite Sees 'Progress' in Talks
BEIRUT — Special Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite — pinned
in the office of an international news agency by gunfire and grenades
in the latest inter-Moslem battle in west Beirut — said yesterday
that he was making progress in his efforts to gain freedom for four
American hostages but that "we have a long way to go yet."
"Keep calm. We're making progress," Waite said in The Associ
ated Press office as fighting raged in the streets below.
Waite, 46, is the emissary of the Archbishop of Canterbury,
Robert Runcie, the spiritual head of the church of England.
The worst fighting in months swept across the Moslem-controled
half of the Lebanese capital, trapping Waite in the AP bureau as he
prepared a statement only minutes before a scheduled news confer
ence. Waite said he had planned to fly to Cyprus yesterday afternoon
and then on to New York today for meetings with U.S. State Depart
ment officials and members of the Episcopalian and Presbyterian
churches.
Senate Passes China Nuke Deal
WASHINGTON — The Senate, moving quickly after months of
objections by liberal senators, yesterday approved President
Reagan's long-delayed agreement to share nuclear power technology
with China.
On a voice vote with neither debate nor opposition, senators
cleared the way for U.S. companies to begin negotiating contracts to
supply materials and equipment to China's ambitious nuclear pro
gram.
A similar resolution is pending in the House, but to block the
agreement, both chambers would have had to pass resolutions of dis
approval by Dec. 11, the expiration date of a 90-day period in which
Congress could veto the pact. The agreement, first initialed last
year during President Reagan's trip to China, had been held up be
cause critics led by Sen. Alan Cranston (D.-Calif.) feared that China
would share its nuclear technology with Iran, Pakistan and other na
tions.
Overruling Administration objections on an 11-3 vote, the commit
tee made any shipments of material or equipment under the pact
conditional on Reagan receiving firm assurances that China would not
divert fissionable material to any nation trying to assemble a bomb.
Another restriction reserves to the United States the authority to
refuse China permission to reprocess spent reactor fuel supplied un
der the agreement.
Irish Parliament Ratifies Accord
DUBLIN, Ireland — After three days of intense debate, the Irish
Parliament yesterday ratified the Anglo-Irish agreement aimed at
promoting peace in Northern Ireland.
Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald won a narrow 88-75 endorse
ment for the historic accord he signed last week with his British
counterpart, Margaret Thatcher.
Results of the vote, read to a packed house in Ireland's native
Gaelic langauge, removed the only significant obstacle to implemen
tation of the agreement, which is expected to go into force after ap
proval next week by the British Parliament, where it has the support
of all major parties.
The agreement is the first formal attempt by the two countries to
join forces in reducing the level of sectarian violence that has claimed
more than 2,500 lives in Northern Ireland since 1968.
The accord gives the Republic of Ireland a formal, consultative
role in Northern Ireland for the first time ever, but also requires
Ireland to recognize British sovereignty there for the foreseeable
future.
S. African Police Fire on Crowd
MAMELODI, South Africa — Ten blacks were reported killed
here yesterday when riot police opened fire on thousands of anti
government demonstrators and the crowd stampeded in panic, tram
pling many who fell.
Although police headquarters in Pretoria acknowledged its forces
had fatally wounded two persons, a man and a woman, in attempting
to break up the protests, a reporter for a black newspaper counted
10 bodies at the local clinic, some of them the victims of the stam
pede, and witnesses told of seeing six or eight bodies lying in the
street, apparently lifeless, after the incident.
The final death toll is likely to be "as much as 20," said a commu
nity activist who was present, and this would rank the clash among
the worst in 15 months of civil unrest in which more than 850 per
sons, most of them black, have died.
The clash brought the unrest for the first time on a large scale to
Pretoria, the country's administrative capital.
Rumors continued to circulate, meanwhile, that the minority white
government is planning to release Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned
leader of the outlawed African National Congress, perhaps allowing
him to go into exile, in an effort to create a climate for political
negotiations that would end the civil strife here.
