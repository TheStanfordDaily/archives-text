# UPDATE
## Reagan Reports 'Fresh Start' at Summit Future meetings planned; leaders agree to 'accelerate' arms negotiations 
### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan concluded three days of
personal diplomacy with Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev in
Geneva yesterday and returned
home to tell Congress and the na
tion that they had made "a fresh
start" toward world peace.
"I called for a fresh start, and we
made that start," Reagan reported
to a cheering Congress.
"I can't claim we had a meeting of
the minds on such fundamentals as
ideology or national purposes —
but we understand each other bet
ter," he said.
"That's key to peace. I gained a
better perspective; I feel he did,
too."
The president's nationally broad
cast speech came only hours after
the closing ceremony of what
Reagan called a "fireside summit."
Private meetings between the two
leaders, conducted with only their
interpreters present, used up more
than half of the time allocated for
formal summit sessions.
Before leaving Geneva for their
respective capitals, Reagan and
Gorbachev issued a formal joint
statement that aimed at opening a
path toward progress in the future.

They agreed to meet again — in
Washington next year, in Moscow in
1987 — and they resolved to
"accelerate" the arms reduction
talks that began in Geneva in March
and were recessed early this
month.
Reagan reported that he and
Gorbachev made "a measure of
progress" in the area of arms re
duction. "We moved arms control
forward from where we were last
January, when the Soviets returned
to the table. We are both instructing
our negotiators to hasten their vital

work. The world is waiting for
results.
"Specifically, we agreed in
Geneva that each side should move
to cut offensive nuclear arms by 50
percent in appropriate categories
. . . (and) we called for an interim
accord on intermediate-range nu
clear forces, leading, I hope, to the
complete elimination of this class of
missiles. All this with tough
verification."
Both countries had already put
forth formal arms control proposals
that included those measures, but

the summit was the first time the
two leaders had done so together.
"(The summit) has given a new
start in the right direction to our re
lationship," Gorbachev told Reagan
in a final champagne toast yester
day morning.
"We found that we do seem to
share a certain initial premise on
the improvement of our relations,"
the Soviet leader said later in a one
hour, 40-minute news conference.
"That is the understanding that a
nuclear war cannot occur — that
there can be no winners in a nuclear
war.
"I'm very optimistic when I look
ahead to the future," Gorbachev
said. "I would be so bold as to say
that, although the number of weap
ons remains as high as it was before
the meetings, the world has
become a safer place."
In a whirlwind day, Reagan ap
peared together with Gorbachev to
present the results of their talks
and to watch their aides sign
several bilateral accords; held a
sixth and final private meeting with
the Soviet leader; flew to Brussels
to brief U.S. allies, and returned to
Washington in the evening to report
to the nation from the Capitol.
