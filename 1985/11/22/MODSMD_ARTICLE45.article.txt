# Secrets allegedly delivered to Israel
## FBI Nets Navy Analyst on Spy Charges 
### 
WASHINGTON — The FBI yesterday ar
rested a counterintelligence analyst for the Naval
Investigative Service on charges of passing Navy
and CIA codes to a foreign government, identi
fied by federal sources as Israel.
Jonathan Jay Pollard, 31, was arrested as he
attempted to force his way into the heavily
guarded Israeli Embassy, apparently in an effort
to seek sanctuary.
State Department and law enforcement
sources said they could recall no previous
espionage incident in which U.S. secrets were
passed to Israel, a longtime ally. One law en

forcement source said the case will prove "highly
embarrassing" to Israel.
Pollard, under surveillance by investigators
for "several months" at the Naval Investigative
Service in nearby Suitland, Md., was stopped for
questioning Tuesday and found to have highly
classified documents in his possession, one FBI
source said. On that occasion he was released.
FBI and Naval Investigative agents obtained a
suitcase with Pollard's name on it Tuesday, FBI
agent Lydia Jechorek said in an affidavit filed with
a U.S. magistrate in Washington. Jechorek said
that the suitcase "contains highly classified docu

ments and information relating to the national
defense," and she said Pollard also admitted that
"he had given these documents and this informa
tion to agents of a foreign government."
Pollard's arrest, two government sources
said, took place after he attempted to crash his
car through an iron fence around the Israel com
pound.
The arrest came the same day a Pentagon
panel released a report urging steps to tighten
military security, including expanded use of lie
detectors, fewer security clearances and inspec
tion of people entering or leaving defense instal
lations.
