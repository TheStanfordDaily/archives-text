Kate Lashes Florida
PANAMA CITY, Fla. — The leading edge
of Hurricane Kate ripped ashore at dusk here
yesterday with steady rain and winds up to 100
mph, uprooting trees, shearing roofs from
buildings and forcing thousands of residents to
evacuate Florida's Gulf Coast for the fourth
time in three months.
The storm's 20-mile-wide eye made land
just after nightfall between Port St. Joe and
Mexico Beach east of here as Kate continued
her tortuous trek north after scraping across
Cuba on Tuesday.
Reports from Havana were sparse and con
tradictory, but the hurricane was blamed for as
many as 16 deaths, according to the latest dis
patches reaching here. Two people were re
ported drowned off Key West, Fla.
Kate weakened slightly as she crossed the
cooler waters of the northern Gulf and slowed
briefly before rushing the Florida Panhandle at
10 to 15 mph. It is the first Atlantic hurricane
to hit the mainland United States in November
since Nov. 4, 1935.
Electricity and phone lines were cut off to
thousands of Floridians, and many huddled in
darkened high school hallways sipping cold cof
fee, swapping tales of woe and waiting for bul
letins on transistor radios.
Gov. Robert Graham ordered the evacua

tion of this and seven other coastal counties
across Florida's Big Bend southward to
Sarasota. An estimated 90,000 residents of
the Panhandle left their homes as Kate ap
proached.
Panel Approves Tax
WASHINGTON — The House Ways and
Means Committee, nearing completion of a
comprehensive tax revision package, yester
day approved a minimum-tax plan aimed at im
posing a much heavier tax burden on nearly all
high-income individuals and profitable corpora
tions that currently pay little or no tax. The
committee also agreed to limit deductions for
business meals and entertaining.
The panel adopted a minimum tax provision
that would raise, over the next five years, an
additional $27 billion from individuals and $9
billion from corporations that take special ad
vantage of legal tax breaks.
Pentagon Plans Probe
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon, trying to
attack the weaknesses brought to light by the
Walker spy case, will conduct a top-to-bottom
security inspection, taking action on one of the

recommendations of a senior-level commission
created last summer to identify vulnerabilities
in military security.
The panel, in a report made public yester
day, also recommended expanded use of lie
detectors, rewards for information leading to
the apprehension of spies, improved back
ground investigations and fewer security
clearances.
The panel's report was issued only hours
before it was disclosed that FBI agents had ar
rested a counterintelligence analyst for the
Naval Investigative Service on charges of
passing Navy and CIA codes to a foreign gov
ernment, identified by official sources as Is
rael.
Stocks Hit New Highs
NEW YORK — Wall Street's bull market put
on another show of force yesterday, carrying
major stock indexes to new highs in heavy
trading.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
jumped 23.05 points to 1,462.27, eclipsing the
previous closing high of 1,440.02 set on Mon
day.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
accelerated to 150.32 million shares from
105.10 million Wednesday.
