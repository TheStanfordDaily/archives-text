Smoking Trial Opens
SANTA BARBARA — On the day of the
American Cancer Society's Great American
Smokeout, attorneys made their opening
statements in a far-reaching trial to determine
whether R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. is liable
for the lung cancer death of a man who smoked
the firm's cigarettes.
But the trial, which is being watched closely
by America's $60 billion a year tobacco indus
try, was then recessed while an appellate
court considers whether material from the
U.S. Surgeon General's report on cigarette
smoking should be included in the testimony.
San Francisco attorney Melvin Belli, who
represents the family of John Galbraith, a

Santa Barbara man who died three years ago
of lung cancer and other ailments, told the jury
that he will show a direct link between
smoking and lung cancer and that Galbraith
was addicted to cigarettes.
Drilling Ban Lifted
WASHINGTON — A House committee
dealt a potential blow yesterday to foes of oil
exploration off California, voting 27-26 not to
renew a four-year ban on petroleum leasing
and drilling off much of the state's ecologically
sensitive coastline.
The defeat of the drilling ban, which legisla
tors had sought to attach to a $480 billion stop-

gap funding bill, marked the first time in five
years that the House Appropriations Commit
tee had failed to pass a one-year moratorium
on exploration off California shores.
Infant Gets Heart
LOMA LINDA — A rare infant-to-infant
heart transplant has been performed by the
surgeon who last year transplanted a baboon
heart into the infant known as Baby Fae, offi
cials at Loma Linda University Medical Center
announced yesterday.
The hospital said that the operation was per
formed Wednesday by Dr. Leonard Bailey and
confirmed that the baby was alive.
