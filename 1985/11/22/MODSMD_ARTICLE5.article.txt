# Cal Students Suspects in Vandalism

### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
University officials say they believe UC-Berkeley
students may be responsible for vandalizing both the
Rodin Sculpture Garden and Memorial Church this
week, adding that they have not yet identified
suspects in the case.
Vandals painted slogans on two Rodin statues,
columns at the Stanford Art Museum and the ex
terior of Memorial Church late Wednesday evening
or early Thursday morning, prompting the Stanford
Police Department to station a Special Events offi
cer in the sculpture garden to prevent any further
incidents.
The vandalism drew the ire of University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, who announced the sculpture
garden incident during yesterday's Faculty Senate
meeting.
"The controversial insistence of not placing any
barriers of protection around the Rodin Sculpture
Garden seems like a wonderful idea, but the Univer
sity of California found it too alluring to turn down,"
Kennedy said.
According to Robert Hamerton-Kelly, dean of the
chapel, the "most egregious" defacement occurred

on the door of the East Room of Memorial Church,
where "Go Bears" was scrawled in white paint.
The word "Cal" was also painted on exterior
stonework on both the south and east sides of the
church, Hamerton-Kelley said, calling the vandalism
"a desecration."
Although unable to ascertain the exact extent of
the damage, Hamerton-Kelly said the paint appears
to be "pretty permanent."
Vandals also painted the letters "C-A-L" in white
acrylic paint on columns in front of the Stanford
Museum, according to Prof. Lorenz Eitner, chair
man of the Art Department, who referred to the act
as "a stupid prank."
Two bronze statues were also marked with the
letter "C," according to Eitner.
The paint was "totally removed" yesterday by
museum technical experts and will leave no visible
damage, Eitner said.
A gift of financier B.G. Cantor, the sculpture gar
den was dedicated in May. Keeping the garden com
pletely open to the public was a prime design consid
eration, Cantor told a crowd of several hundred at
the opening ceremony.
"We acted with the conviction that if people saw
our trust, they would respect and share it," Cantor
said.
