# The 						Annual Changing of the Guard
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Staff writer 
Don't be surprised if, after the Big Game to
morrow, the Band's final rendition of "All Right
Now" goes on for longer than usual.
It will be the last song directed by drum major
Andy Switky, and he may want to draw it out a
bit.
Especially if Stanford wins the game.
"There's nothing better than playing a
postgame concert after a victory," Switky said.
"We're out there for 45 minutes or an hour,
people stay, and we do what we like best, which
is play."
The end of the Big Game postgame concert
signals the annual changing of the guard for the
Leland Stanford Junior University Marching
Band (LSJUMB). While the current Dollies will
go on to delight and amaze throughout basketball
season and much of spring quarter, the organiza
tional hierarchy of the group, including the drum
major position, turns over after the football
season.
The incoming drum major is senior Brian Pike,
a veteran of the Band's alto saxophone section.
Incoming Band manager Jeff Stevens said that
Pike will fill the position well.
"Brian's really strong musically, plus he has a
ton of energy, and a lot of spark," Stevens said.

Pike will make his debut as drum major on the
first day of spring quarter, in an all campus rally.
With his tenure as the Band's leader coming to
an end, Switky, a senior from San Mateo, has a
lot to say about the LSJUMB.
"As things start to wind down, you become
very philosophical," he said. "In one year, you
have these ideas about what you want to do.
Then you get bigger ideas, and you can lose
track of what the Band is all about."
Most of Switky's ideas this year were aimed at
improving the Band's musical performance.
"In the past, people who were directing the
Band were working to build the Band up in differ

ent areas," he said.
"I told myself that I wasn't going to go in for
the flash and hype. I've tried to concentrate on
the music; I think people wanted to have more
expected of them musically."
Stevens said that Switky's efforts have paid
off.
"Andy has brought the music to a level where
it's never been before. This is as well as we've
ever played in the time I've been here," said
Stevens, a senior.
Switky said that another focus of the Band this
year was embellishing the format of the on-field
shows.
"We're using a lot more props, and trying not
to be confined to the rectangle of the field," he
explained.
The changes in format were principally efforts
to make the shows more visible to the student
body, because they are seated so low in the
stadium, Switky said.
Switky played trumpet and mellophone in the
Band for three years before becoming drum
major. He was drawn to the new post for practi
cal reasons.
"I thought I could do things better," he said. "I
found out I could do things differently, not neces
sarily better."
After being selected drum major at the end of

the football season last year,
Switky spent the winter mastering
the Band's music, "listening and lis
tening" to the songs in the Band's
files.
He said he also worked out, in
anticipation of the physical demands
of directing the LSJUMB.
"Even so, after the first all
campus rally, my arms were so
tired, I couldn't take my shirt off,"
Switky said.
Spending a year as drum major
gave Switky the opportunity to deal
with public perceptions of the
LSJUMB.
"The best thing about the job is
the way people and the media react
to us," he said.
"Off campus, people take us
seriously, and they come up to me
and ask, 'How can some
thing like this happen at a serious,
respected university?'
"But we're entertainers; we're
not going to show how serious the
University is by the way we play or
march.
"We do what we do, and if people
like us, that's great; and if not, they

just might not understand us,"
Switky said.
Switky has also had to deal with
complaints that the Band's routine
is repetitious and that the group
doesn't support the football team.
"I think the public sees us as just
doing the same thing, but if you see
the USC band, they do the same
thing more than anybody. They've
done the same halftime show at the
Stanford game every year that I've
been here.
"We do what every other band in
the country wants to do.
"We really do support the team
. . . we're supporters of the team
and the University. We play at four
or five alumni functions on every
road trip," he said.
Switky said that at the beginning
of this season the Band restricted
its playing to pregame and halftime
shows during football games,
suspecting that football players
resented the distraction of the Band
playing while the game was actually
in progress.
But after receiving numerous let
ters from alumni and other fans, the
Band started to play during the
games to help spark the Stanford

followers.
"That's something we'll definitely
continue to concentrate on next
season," Switky said.
Though the drum major is the
focus of attention for those observ
ing the Band, and something of a
lightning rod for school spirit on
campus, Switky said he doesn't
think the position is particularly
glamorous.
"My job is to run the Band at
rallies and games and rehearsals, to
be responsible for the Band at func
tions . . . like not taking a left turn
during the rally in the City," he
said.
Outgoing Band manager Scott
Gode said that the drum major's
role goes beyond merely directing
the Band.
"The drum major has to be able
to spark people, too," he said.
"True, a lot of it is just being the
dancing fool. In many situations,
aside from starting and stopping,
the Band really doesn't need some
one up there.
"But the drum major also has the
responsibility of helping to plan the
overall strategy of the season and
helping with a lot of behind-the

scenes decision-making stuff like
who gets in the Band and what kind
of rallies the Band goes to," Gode
said.
Most of that decision-making
goes on within the Band staff, prin
cipally among the manager, assis
tant manager and the drum major.
The selection of the new drum
major is made by the incoming
manager, in this case Stevens.
Beginning a few weeks before the
end of the football season, he reads
applications, interviews each of the
applicants, and consults with other
Band staffers and with various Band
veterans like announcer Hal Mickel
son and photographer Robby
Beyers.
Stevens said he was looking for
someone who would complement
his personal style.
"I was mainly looking for some
one who would be wild, because I'm
not," he said.
"I wanted someone who would
take the Band to a really high level
energy-wise.
"I think the drum major's very
important. He draws attention to
the Band, makes people look at the
Band," Stevens said.
