# The
						Annual Changing of the Guard

### CHRIS MYERS Staff writer 
Don't be surprised if, after the Big Game to
morrow, the Band's final rendition of "All Right
Now" goes on for longer than usual.
It will be the last song directed by drum major
Andy Switky, and he may want to draw it out a
bit.
Especially if Stanford wins the game.
"There's nothing better than playing a
postgame concert after a victory," Switky said.
"We're out there for 45 minutes or an hour,
people stay, and we do what we like best, which
is play."
The end of the Big Game postgame concert
signals the annual changing of the guard for the
Leland Stanford Junior University Marching
Band (LSJUMB). While the current Dollies will
go on to delight and amaze throughout basketball
season and much of spring quarter, the organiza
tional hierarchy of the group, including the drum
major position, turns over after the football
season.
The incoming drum major is senior Brian Pike,
a veteran of the Band's alto saxophone section.
Incoming Band manager Jeff Stevens said that
Pike will fill the position well.
"Brian's really strong musically, plus he has a
ton of energy, and a lot of spark," Stevens said.

Pike will make his debut as drum major on the
first day of spring quarter, in an all campus rally.
With his tenure as the Band's leader coming to
an end, Switky, a senior from San Mateo, has a
lot to say about the LSJUMB.
"As things start to wind down, you become
very philosophical," he said. "In one year, you
have these ideas about what you want to do.
Then you get bigger ideas, and you can lose
track of what the Band is all about."
Most of Switky's ideas this year were aimed at
improving the Band's musical performance.
"In the past, people who were directing the
Band were working to build the Band up in differ

ent areas," he said.
"I told myself that I wasn't going to go in for
the flash and hype. I've tried to concentrate on
the music; I think people wanted to have more
expected of them musically."
Stevens said that Switky's efforts have paid
off.
"Andy has brought the music to a level where
it's never been before. This is as well as we've
ever played in the time I've been here," said
Stevens, a senior.
Switky said that another focus of the Band this
year was embellishing the format of the on-field
shows.
"We're using a lot more props, and trying not
to be confined to the rectangle of the field," he
explained.
The changes in format were principally efforts
to make the shows more visible to the student
body, because they are seated so low in the
stadium, Switky said.
Switky played trumpet and mellophone in the
Band for three years before becoming drum
major. He was drawn to the new post for practi
cal reasons.
"I thought I could do things better," he said. "I
found out I could do things differently, not neces
sarily better."
