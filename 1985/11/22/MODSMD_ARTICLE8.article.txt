# Virus Hits Storey
## 
### LIZ EGAN Staff writer 
Approximately half the students living in Storey
House became ill Tuesday night with a serious virus
called gastroenteritis, according to doctors at Cowell
Student Health Center.
"I came down with it about 10:30 p.m. . . . and by
morning everyone was sick," said junior Jo French, a
Storey House resident who described the illness as
"similar to the stomach flu."
According to Dr. John Dorman, associate director of
Cowell, "People are more likely to get [gastroenteritis]
from a common source than from each other."
The incubation period for this type of virus could be
from two to three days and the duration of the
symptoms varies accordingly, Dorman said. "The
faster it comes, the faster it goes. If it comes like
gangbusters, it's not going to stay very long," he said.
The cause of the virus' widespread presence is still
unknown.
"It was pretty coincidental that everyone got it at
the same time," said Storey resident Traslyn Butler.
"We thought about food poisoning, but then realized
that everyone didn't eat here."
Some residents initially suspected that the house
cook, who had been fired a few days earlier, may have
sabotaged the food.
"But he got sick, too, so I assume he didn't do it,"
Butler said.
French said it was "probably just a virus that
sometimes goes around."
