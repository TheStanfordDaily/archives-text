# A 						Trying Season for an Injured Wyman
## 
### BETH KLEID Editorial stuff 
In a sense, Dave Wyman has
been through a broken-off love af
fair.
Wyman, who was Stanford's
Most Valuable Player last season,
had to end his relationship with
football, the sport he says he "lived
and died for," because of a serious
knee injury incurred during the
third quarter of the Stanford-
Arizona game last season.
At first, reconciliation between
Wyman and his first love was one
big question mark, but now it
seems promising. Indeed, it was a
painful break-up. Wyman becomes
quite sullen as he remembers the
incident behind his injury.
"I was tired before it happened,"
he says, "I had even decided to sit
the next series out." But in his
usual manner, what he describes as
the "full-out or nothing way I play,"
he was chasing the Arizona quarter
back on a rollout when he felt some
body clip him from the side.
"Then I felt something pop. I
looked down to see my whole lower
leg rotated 90 degrees," he says. "I
was really scared the shock was
so much at the time. I found my
brother (then-Cardinal Mike
Wyman) and started grabbing his
jersey right on the field."
The pain was intense, but did not
compare to the emotional trauma
Wyman suffered as a result of the
injury described by his doctors
as extremely serious, the kind
usually seen only from bad car or
motorcycle accidents.
"It was really hard. I was really
depressed," Wyman remembers.
He spent the two weeks after he
was injured at the Stanford Medical
Center, where he had too much
time to think about life without foot
ball.
"I always had a football season to
look forward to, and that option
seemed closed off at the time," he
says. "It was hard to swallow that
one."

Wyman wasn't the only one who
suffered because of his injury. The
Cardinal football program risked
losing its premier tackier the 6-
foot-3, 231-pound linebacker who
led the team with 128 tackles in
1984 and 144 in 1983. He was also
named to the All-Pac 10 Second
team in 1984.
His family, which Wyman
describes as "very close and very
supportive," had its share of
hardship because of the injury, too.
"My mom was torn up, but she
was the first one to say, 'You'll
play.' And Dad was really hurt. He
usually makes an album for us after
every season with clips and
pictures but not last year. It just
hurt too much," Wyman says.
"My parents haven't come to the
games this year, and they had been
going to every single game to watch
us play. It was the most exciting
part of their life," he says. "It's
funny, sometimes they would get
more fired up than us."
According to Wyman, his parents
have always been his greatest fans
and not "pushy" with their sons
about football. "Although we do
have a picture of my brother when
he was two, in full pads in front of
the Christmas tree," he says with a
chuckle. Mike Wyman went on to
play defensive tackle for the Card
inal and saw a lot of playing time at
Stanford. He graduated last year
and is now running the Wymans'
sawmill company in Nevada.
Brother Mike also was distraught
over his younger brother's injured
knee and, in the typical Wyman
way, was helpful throughout the or
deal. "He would do anything for
me, and I would do the same for
him," Wyman says. "I have never
been able to figure out how broth
ers and sisters are competitive. We
are fiercely competitive, but only
out on the field. People probably
think it's phony how much support
we give each other."
Wyman misses playing on the
same team as his brother, but is
grateful to have had the opportunity
to do so. "It's a good feeling to be

on the field together. I miss him, I
loved playing with him. He was the
reason I came to Stanford I
would have gone to UCLA,"
Wyman says.
Although Wyman has not played a
down this season, he has still made
a contribution to Cardinal football.
He has served as sort of a coach,
though he admits he tries "not to be
too much of a coach," to his re
placement, inside linebacker Jack
Gilmete.
"What I do during the game is sit
up in the booth in the press box and
talk to Jack on headphones,"
Wyman says. "And he really ap
preciates it. We have a good rela
tionship. When he says, Thanks
Dave,' it makes me feel good."
However, Wyman says that he
doesn't like the way the press has
tried to pit the two linebackers
against each other, saying that Gil
mete is viciously pursuing Wyman's
tackling record. "It is so far from
the truth," Wyman says.
Wyman is pleased with Gilmete's
performance. "Jack is in no way a
liability he's not a weak point in
the defense he's a strong point. I
have always admired him as an ath
lete." As for the whole team,
Wyman says that "those guys are
trying as hard as they can. You
know they're giving it their all."
Wyman says he doesn't feel he is
doing enough for the Cardinal this
season. "I feel guilty like I'm not
helping the team. I feel pressure,
like they (Stanford's coaches) wish
I could be out there."
It's hard for him to be a redshirt,
not participating on the field. "I try
to remove myself emotionally from
the team," he says. Because his
heart is not in this season, he says
that he finds himself "concentrating
hard" on next year. "And that
makes me feel selfish. Everyone
else is in this year, " Wyman adds.
As a result of Wyman's dedication
to rebuilding his leg, there probably
will be a next seaon for him. He ap
pears optimistic. "I have put my
knee through every test except
playing, which is the ultimate test."

It has certainly taken time and
hard work to heal the wounds.
Wyman says that he has been religi
ous about his rehabilitation pro
gram. He says that he does a series
of weightlifting and agility exercises
to strengthen his knee, which in the
process, has created a new pas
sion. "I ride my bike like crazy. I
ride about 100 miles a week.
"I'm really proud of myself. I'm
not really that much of a disciplined
person. Sometimes I can get away
with a lot more screwing around
than I should. I like to have fun," he
says, adding that he likes movies,
music and living in the Delta Tau
Delta House.
"I started at such a low after the
injury in the hospital my leg was
so skinny, it was this big around,"
he says, holding his hands together
in a small circle.

"I'll be proud to walk out on the
field next year knowing I've rebuilt
myself," he says.
Wyman explains that he has a
stabilizing brace to protect his leg
when he begins to play again.
Of course, thinking about a life
without football has caused Wyman,
a communication major, to develop
some alternate plans. "Maybe busi
ness I know my dad would have
me," he says, "but he would rather
see me in the NFL."
Before Wyman and football are
re-united, he will have another type
of reunion that he says he is looking
forward to: his parents and his
brother returning to Stanford for
Big Game. Despite the fact that
there will be no Wymans on the
field, the family gets pretty heated
about this one. Dave's prediction:
'We can kill Cal."

Although he has the size and the speed to carry the ball effectively,
Stanford linebacker Dave Wyman is better known for what he does
to those carrying the ball than for carrying it himself. After spending
the entire season recovering from a serious injury suffered in 1984
against Arizona, Wyman is expected to be ready to go next year.

Although he has the size and the speed to carry the ball effectively,
Stanford linebacker Dave Wyman is better known for what he does
to those carrying the ball than for carrying it himself. After spending
the entire season recovering from a serious injury suffered in 1984
against Arizona, Wyman is expected to be ready to go next year.
In a sense, Dave Wyman has
been through a broken-off love af
fair.
Wyman, who was Stanford's
Most Valuable Player last season,
had to end his relationship with
football, the sport he says he "lived
and died for," because of a serious
knee injury incurred during the
third quarter of the Stanford-
Arizona game last season.
At first, reconciliation between
Wyman and his first love was one
big question mark, but now it
seems promising. Indeed, it was a
painful break-up. Wyman becomes
quite sullen as he remembers the
incident behind his injury.
"I was tired before it happened,"
he says, "I had even decided to sit
the next series out." But in his
usual manner, what he describes as
the "full-out or nothing way I play,"
he was chasing the Arizona quarter
back on a rollout when he felt some
body clip him from the side.
"Then I felt something pop. I
looked down to see my whole lower
leg rotated 90 degrees," he says. "I
was really scared the shock was
so much at the time. I found my
brother (then-Cardinal Mike
Wyman) and started grabbing his
jersey right on the field."
The pain was intense, but did not
compare to the emotional trauma
Wyman suffered as a result of the
injury described by his doctors
as extremely serious, the kind
usually seen only from bad car or
motorcycle accidents.
"It was really hard. I was really
depressed," Wyman remembers.
He spent the two weeks after he
was injured at the Stanford Medical
Center, where he had too much
time to think about life without foot
ball.
"I always had a football season to
look forward to, and that option
seemed closed off at the time," he
says. "It was hard to swallow that
one."

Wyman wasn't the only one who
suffered because of his injury. The
Cardinal football program risked
losing its premier tackier the 6-
foot-3, 231-pound linebacker who
led the team with 128 tackles in
1984 and 144 in 1983. He was also
named to the All-Pac 10 Second
team in 1984.
His family, which Wyman
describes as "very close and very
supportive," had its share of
hardship because of the injury, too.
"My mom was torn up, but she
was the first one to say, 'You'll
play.' And Dad was really hurt. He
usually makes an album for us after
every season with clips and
pictures but not last year. It just
hurt too much," Wyman says.
"My parents haven't come to the
games this year, and they had been
going to every single game to watch
us play. It was the most exciting
part of their life," he says. "It's
funny, sometimes they would get
more fired up than us."
According to Wyman, his parents
have always been his greatest fans
and not "pushy" with their sons
about football. "Although we do
have a picture of my brother when
he was two, in full pads in front of
the Christmas tree," he says with a
chuckle. Mike Wyman went on to
play defensive tackle for the Card
inal and saw a lot of playing time at
Stanford. He graduated last year
and is now running the Wymans'
sawmill company in Nevada.
Brother Mike also was distraught
over his younger brother's injured
knee and, in the typical Wyman
way, was helpful throughout the or
deal. "He would do anything for
me, and I would do the same for
him," Wyman says. "I have never
been able to figure out how broth
ers and sisters are competitive. We
are fiercely competitive, but only
out on the field. People probably
think it's phony how much support
we give each other."
Wyman misses playing on the
same team as his brother, but is
grateful to have had the opportunity
to do so. "It's a good feeling to be

on the field together. I miss him, I
loved playing with him. He was the
reason I came to Stanford I
would have gone to UCLA,"
Wyman says.
Although Wyman has not played a
down this season, he has still made
a contribution to Cardinal football.
He has served as sort of a coach,
though he admits he tries "not to be
too much of a coach," to his re
placement, inside linebacker Jack
Gilmete.
"What I do during the game is sit
up in the booth in the press box and
talk to Jack on headphones,"
Wyman says. "And he really ap
preciates it. We have a good rela
tionship. When he says, Thanks
Dave,' it makes me feel good."
However, Wyman says that he
doesn't like the way the press has
tried to pit the two linebackers
against each other, saying that Gil
mete is viciously pursuing Wyman's
tackling record. "It is so far from
the truth," Wyman says.
Wyman is pleased with Gilmete's
performance. "Jack is in no way a
liability he's not a weak point in
the defense he's a strong point. I
have always admired him as an ath
lete." As for the whole team,
Wyman says that "those guys are
trying as hard as they can. You
know they're giving it their all."
Wyman says he doesn't feel he is
doing enough for the Cardinal this
season. "I feel guilty like I'm not
helping the team. I feel pressure,
like they (Stanford's coaches) wish
I could be out there."
It's hard for him to be a redshirt,
not participating on the field. "I try
to remove myself emotionally from
the team," he says. Because his
heart is not in this season, he says
that he finds himself "concentrating
hard" on next year. "And that
makes me feel selfish. Everyone
else is in this year, " Wyman adds.
As a result of Wyman's dedication
to rebuilding his leg, there probably
will be a next seaon for him. He ap
pears optimistic. "I have put my
knee through every test except
playing, which is the ultimate test."

It has certainly taken time and
hard work to heal the wounds.
Wyman says that he has been religi
ous about his rehabilitation pro
gram. He says that he does a series
of weightlifting and agility exercises
to strengthen his knee, which in the
process, has created a new pas
sion. "I ride my bike like crazy. I
ride about 100 miles a week.
"I'm really proud of myself. I'm
not really that much of a disciplined
person. Sometimes I can get away
with a lot more screwing around
than I should. I like to have fun," he
says, adding that he likes movies,
music and living in the Delta Tau
Delta House.
"I started at such a low after the
injury in the hospital my leg was
so skinny, it was this big around,"
he says, holding his hands together
in a small circle.

"I'll be proud to walk out on the
field next year knowing I've rebuilt
myself," he says.
Wyman explains that he has a
stabilizing brace to protect his leg
when he begins to play again.
Of course, thinking about a life
without football has caused Wyman,
a communication major, to develop
some alternate plans. "Maybe busi
ness I know my dad would have
me," he says, "but he would rather
see me in the NFL."

"I'm really proud of myself. I'm
not really that much of a disciplined
person. Sometimes I can get away
with a lot more screwing around
than I should. I like to have fun," he
says, adding that he likes movies,
music and living in the Delta Tau
Delta House.
"I started at such a low after the
injury in the hospital my leg was
so skinny, it was this big around,"
he says, holding his hands together
in a small circle.

"I'll be proud to walk out on the
field next year knowing I've rebuilt
myself," he says.
Wyman explains that he has a
stabilizing brace to protect his leg
when he begins to play again.
Of course, thinking about a life
without football has caused Wyman,
a communication major, to develop
some alternate plans. "Maybe busi
ness I know my dad would have
me," he says, "but he would rather
see me in the NFL."
Before Wyman and football are
re-united, he will have another type
of reunion that he says he is looking
forward to: his parents and his
brother returning to Stanford for
Big Game. Despite the fact that
there will be no Wymans on the
field, the family gets pretty heated
about this one. Dave's prediction:
'We can kill Cal."

the entire season recovering from a serious injury suffered in 1984
against Arizona, Wyman is expected to be ready to go next year.
