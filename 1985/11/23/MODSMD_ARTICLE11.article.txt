# In Search of: Hardy Nickerson
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
I really wanted to talk to Hardy Nicker
son.
I mean, I had read about the guy for the

last two years. In 1984, 141 tackles.
Through 10 games this season, 155. And his
name blew me away. Hardy Nickerson! All
linebackers should have names like Hardy
Nickerson.
So when the Cardinal Today editors asked
me to do a story on California's star inside

linebacker, I went nuts. I started doing re
search on him.
I found out he's only a junior. I found out
his nickname is the "Hardware Man," be
cause he hammers runners and nails
receivers. I found out that Cal began pump
ing him for All-America recognition this
week by mailing out flyers with a picture of
Hardy, arms spread, with a gold wrench su
perimposed on each big hand.
I wrote that down: Ask N. about
nickname. Does he like being promoted like
that?
I looked at his picture in the media guide.
He's a friendly looking guy, with close
cropped hair and the hint of a mustache over
his upper lip. The media guide told me
Hardy is from Verbum Dei High School in
Los Angeles and that he is 6-foot-3, 230
pounds. It also told me: "Whenever the Cal
defense is on the field, one will usually find
No. 47 around the football."
I didn't write that down.
During Monday's press conference, Joe
Kapp talked about Hardy Nickerson. I wrote
feverishly, making sure I got everything he
said.
"All the coaches in the conference who
have faced him have stood up and said What
a great football player!' " Kapp yelled over
the phone. "He's the heart of the defense!
He's a very enthusiastic player! He plays
with a smile on his face, looking for people to
hit! I'm sure he's going to have a Big Game
on Saturday!"
That's what he said. It's in my notebook.
I talked with Stanford players about him
and got a different story. He's not as good as
Cal makes him out to be, they said. He's
good, and he travels all over the field, but his

technique isn't great, and he's a hot dog.
Now I was really pumped for an interview
with the Hardware Man. I called the Cal
sports information director on Tuesday, and
he wrote down my number and told me
Hardy would give me a call after 8 p.m. that
night.
I wrote down more Nickerson questions
during the day. Do you really play with a
smile on your face, looking for people to hit?
Do you expect to be running around with a
smile on your face Saturday? Do you like hit
ting Stanford players more than other
players? Why do you think you have racked
up so many tackles this year? Where did
your parents get the name Hardy?
Et cetera.
I was in my room at eight, next to the
phone. I stayed in my room all night. Around
1 a.m., I went to bed.
The next day, I called the Berkeley sports
information office again. "No Hardy," I said.
The assistant sports information director
was deeply apologetic. "I'll give him the
message again," he promised. "I hate it
when the players don't call!"
I got a little suspicious. After all, this was
Cal I was dealing with. I called information.
"The only listings I have in the Berkeley
area are a C.W. Nickerson and a George
Nickerson," the operator informed me.
The next day, Thursday, I called
Berkeley again. The guy on the other end
didn't know who I was, but he offered his
apologies and said he'd leave him my num
ber.
It's deadline now. The editors are waiting.
Hardy hasn't called.
Beat Cal.
