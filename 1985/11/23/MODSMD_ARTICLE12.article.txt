# Last Hurrah for Cardinal Seniors
## Seven graduating players reveal their highlights, low points 
### 
Highlight: Starting at quarterback in
Stanford's 23-21 upset of UCLA at
the Rose Bowl last season.
Low point: Not playing during Stan
ford's 1-10 1983 season. Buckley
backed up Steve Cottrell and John
Paye.
Future plans: A shot at the pro
ranks, a possible jaunt into
screenwriting, law school on the
horizon. Versatility is the key.
What's worse than losing to Cal:
"Attending Cal." Decisively put.
What person most exemplifies your
style of play: "Jack Nicholson."
Fred leaves us to draw the paral
lels.

Highlight: The 1983 Arizona game.
Stan scored a touchdown in the
Cardinal's 31-22 victory over the
nationally ranked Wildcats.
Low point: Lack of playing time
throughout his Stanford career.
Future plans: Graduate with a
degree in industrial engineering, try
out for the pros.
What's worse than losing to Cal:
Following a thoughtful pause, "To
go to Cal?"
c What persons most exemplify your
style of play: "Probably Earl and
Walter," said Stan, obviously refer
ring to Mr. Campbell and Mr.
Payton.

Highlights: The 1985 season. Jack
has started all year and has made
several key defensive plays.
Low point: The 1983 season and
the natural, team-wide depression.
Future plans: Continue job inter
views and career planning, head
home to San Leandro following
graduation. If he's contacted by
NFL scouts, Gilmete said that he
would try out.
What's worse than losing to Cal:
"Failing out." Gilmete has added in
centive to beat Cal, as his
hometown is generally pro-Bears.
What person most exemplifies your
style of play: Los Angeles Raiders
linebacker Rod Martin.

Highlights: His teammates.
Low point: The fact that the Card
inal has never had a winning season
during his Stanford career.
Future plans: Hoping to be drafted
by an NFL team, he will stay in
shape for pro tryouts. If pro football
isn't in the cards, he may travel
abroad, possibly to coach American
football in Italy.
What's worse than losing to Cal:
"Losing the same way as in 1982
(the year of The Play)."
What person most exemplifies your
style of play: Stanford basketball
star Earl Koberlein. Why? "His hus
tling, selfless style of play."

Highlights: Living in the Delt house
and the friends he's made over his
years at Stanford.
Low point Undergoing major knee
surgery early in his freshman year.
Future plans: Await the NFL draft,
return home to Dallas following
graduation and look for a job.
What's worse than losing to Cal:
"Not much, nothing on a football
scale."
What persons most exemplify your
style of play: Professional wrestlers
King Kong Bundy and Andre the
Giant. Barns initially mentioned
Bundy; the Giant was more of an af
terthought.
