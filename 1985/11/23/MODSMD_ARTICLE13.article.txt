When the NCAA gave colleges
the power to redshirt players a few
years ago, a lot of the advantages
were obvious. But for a few Stan
ford seniors who aren't sure
whether today's Big Game will be
their last, the redshirt option and a
little lack of communication have
caused a fair amount of anxiety.
In 1982, Paul Wiggin, then Stan
ford football coach, introduced the
class of 1986 football recruits. Six
teen of those highly-touted fresh
men are still on the team with
scholarships, but after today's
game, only three will have used up
their eligibility. The rest were all
redshirted at one time.
The problem is that the NCAA
allows each college to have 95 eligi
ble players on scholarship. Teams
try to replace the players who use
up their eligibility with new fresh
men on scholarships.
In addition to the three seniors
above tight end Greg Baty, run
ning back Stan Gill and linebacker
Mark Andrew there are only four

other Stanford players, all fifth-year
seniors, whose eligibility ends
today. They are tackle John Barns,
quarterback Fred Buckley and
linebackers Jack Gilmete and Matt
Soderlund.
If that's the way it stays, then
Stanford will have only seven schol
arships to hand out for 1986.
The result is that Stanford Coach
Jack Elway and his staff, who came
here two years ago, now plan to
evaluate more closely the present
football scholarships, and there is a
fear among some potential fifth
year seniors that they will not be
asked to return in 1986.
Though he has made it clear to
his team that "a fifth year is not au
tomatic," Elway said Thursday he
has not made any decisions regard
ing the scholarship situation and will
not look into it closely until after the
season.
That has left many of the seniors
unsure about their futures going
into today's game. All of them were
recruited by Wiggin, and some said
they were told at the time that they
would have a fifth year to finish
their degrees if necessary. Many of

them planned their academic
careers around a five-year pro
gram.
"If Wiggin said that, we will honor
it," Athletic Director Andy Geiger
said. "There's no fussing and
fooling about that business."
Nevertheless, several potential
fifth-year seniors have yet to hear it
officially.
Alan Summers, a reserve tight
end and a 1982 redshirt who
planned a fifth year here to finish his
pre-medical requirements, met
with Elway to find out about his
own status. Summers said Elway
had not made a definite decision.
In particular, Summers said he
wanted to know whether or not he
would be one of those recognized
when seniors playing their final
Cardinal football game are an
nounced at Big Game.
"That (the recognition) is some
thing that any and every senior
should get after playing football for
four years here," Summers said.
"I just want to stress I'm not un
happy with the coaches. I under
stand their position. I just wish they
