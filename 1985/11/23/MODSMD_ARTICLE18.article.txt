# Other Big Games Around the Country

It may be Big Game in Northern
California, but today's Stanford-
California contest is only one of
many longstanding rivalries being
played. Some will have a large
â– bearing on the postseason bowl
picture; some are only for a
timeworn trophy or regional brag
ging rights. Few, though, have the
tradition that Big Game can boast.
Ohio State (8-2) at Michigan
(8-1-1)
This is one of the biggest games
in terms of what it means every
year and how seriously the states
take it. For 17 of the past 18 years,
one of these teams has either won
or shared the Big Ten title, and in
15 of those years, this game has de
termined it. The winner has gone to
the Rose Bowl in nine of the past 11
years.
The teams first met in 1899, and
the Wolverines hold a 44-32-5 ad
vantage. Since OSU joined what
would become the Big Ten in 1913,

the teams are even at 32-32-3. The
game has been played continuously
since 1943, and this will be the 82nd
meeting.
Every year, the shops along High
Street, the main street on the Ohio
State campus, are boarded up as
tens of thousands of Buckeye fans
take to the streets when the Bucks
win, filling the dozens of bars
around campus.
Ann Arbor is a little calmer, but
the game is taken seriously as well.
To be one of the 105,000 people in
the sold-out stadium, some were of
fering $lOO per ticket for the sold
out showdown.
As usual, the politicians have got
ten into the act. Sen. Donald Riegel
(D-Mich.) has a bet with Sen. John
Glenn (D-Ohio) that the loser must
wear the T-shirt of the winning
school in the Senate.
Harvard (7-2) at Yale (3-4-1)
Calling it The Game may be
pretentious, but the rivalry is the
third longest around. Harvard won
the first meeting in 1875, 4-0, but
trails the series 55-35-8. The Game
has been played continually except
during the war years since 1897. It

has been the season finale since
1919.
Both teams have de-emphasized
football a bit since being the national
powerhouses of those early days of
the game. Harvard was the last to
go to the Rose Bowl in 1920.
Despite the long dry spell, fol
lowers of the winning team still
wave white hankies at the other
side as the final seconds tick down.
And if Yale should win in
Cambridge, the Yale band marches
to the statue of John Harvard,
where the drum major leads his
charges while sitting on the face of
Mr. Harvard.
Purdue (4-6) at Indiana (4-6)
The records look a lot like
Stanford-Cal. Neither team has
gone to the Rose Bowl within the
current students' lifetimes, and
there's even a trophy with a story
behind it.
The series began in 1891 with a
0-0 tie and has been continuous
since 1920. Going into the 61st
meeting, Purdue holds a command
ing 40-17-3 lead.

In its intense rivalry with Big Eight foe Nebraska, Oklahoma has a 35-27-3
edge. Between them, the two teams have been the conference
Orange Bowl representative in 21 of the past 23 seasons. When its
team scored, the students used to throw oranges onto the field - until
a policeman was knocked unconscious by one.
