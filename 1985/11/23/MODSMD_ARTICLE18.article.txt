# Other Big Games Around the Country

### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
It may be Big Game in Northern
California, but today's Stanford-
California contest is only one of
many longstanding rivalries being
played. Some will have a large
■bearing on the postseason bowl
picture; some are only for a
timeworn trophy or regional brag
ging rights. Few, though, have the
tradition that Big Game can boast.
Ohio State (8-2) at Michigan
(8-1-1)
This is one of the biggest games
in terms of what it means every
year and how seriously the states
take it. For 17 of the past 18 years,
one of these teams has either won
or shared the Big Ten title, and in
15 of those years, this game has de
termined it. The winner has gone to
the Rose Bowl in nine of the past 11
years.
The teams first met in 1899, and
the Wolverines hold a 44-32-5 ad
vantage. Since OSU joined what
would become the Big Ten in 1913,

the teams are even at 32-32-3. The
game has been played continuously
since 1943, and this will be the 82nd
meeting.
Every year, the shops along High
Street, the main street on the Ohio
State campus, are boarded up as
tens of thousands of Buckeye fans
take to the streets when the Bucks
win, filling the dozens of bars
around campus.
Ann Arbor is a little calmer, but
the game is taken seriously as well.
To be one of the 105,000 people in
the sold-out stadium, some were of
fering $lOO per ticket for the sold
out showdown.
As usual, the politicians have got
ten into the act. Sen. Donald Riegel
(D-Mich.) has a bet with Sen. John
Glenn (D-Ohio) that the loser must
wear the T-shirt of the winning
school in the Senate.
Harvard (7-2) at Yale (3-4-1)
Calling it The Game may be
pretentious, but the rivalry is the
third longest around. Harvard won
the first meeting in 1875, 4-0, but
trails the series 55-35-8. The Game
has been played continually except
during the war years since 1897. It

has been the season finale since
1919.
Both teams have de-emphasized
football a bit since being the national
powerhouses of those early days of
the game. Harvard was the last to
go to the Rose Bowl in 1920.
Despite the long dry spell, fol
lowers of the winning team still
wave white hankies at the other
side as the final seconds tick down.
And if Yale should win in
Cambridge, the Yale band marches
to the statue of John Harvard,
where the drum major leads his
charges while sitting on the face of
Mr. Harvard.
Purdue (4-6) at Indiana (4-6)
The records look a lot like
Stanford-Cal. Neither team has
gone to the Rose Bowl within the
current students' lifetimes, and
there's even a trophy with a story
behind it.
The series began in 1891 with a
0-0 tie and has been continuous
since 1920. Going into the 61st
meeting, Purdue holds a command
ing 40-17-3 lead.


Rod Searcey/Daily
In its intense rivalry with Big Eight foe Nebraska, Oklahoma has a 35-27-3
edge. Between them, the two teams have been the conference
Orange Bowl representative in 21 of the past 23 seasons. When its
team scored, the students used to throw oranges onto the field - until
a policeman was knocked unconscious by one.
The trophy is the Old Oaken
Bucket. When a group of alumni
from the two schools met in
Chicago in 1925, they proposed the
creation of a trophy to go to the
winner of the game. A bucket was
chosen as "the most typical form of
a Hoosier trophy." They found it on
a farm in a well dug during the
1840's, and today the winning
school attaches a block letter "P" or
"I" after winning the game.
Penn State (10-0) at Pittsburgh
(5-4-1)
Not a lot of extracurriculars
here. Just good football. First
played in 1893, this series sees the
Nittany Lions holding a slim 41-39-4
lead going into the 85th meeting.
The no-frills approach to football
seems to have worked. Pitt won
the national title in 1976; Penn
State won it all in 1982 and is two
wins away from turning that trick
again.
Joe Paterno may be 14-4-1
against the Panthers, but don't
count Pitt out. Last year they came
into the game with a 2-7-1 record
and left with a 31-11 victory.
Army (8-2) vs. Navy (3-7) at
Philadelphia
The traditional service academy
game, this will be the 86th meeting
since 1890. Navy holds a 40-38-7
lead; however, Army broke a six

game winless string with a 20-11
triumph last year.
This one began when Navy,
which then had an organized team
for eight years, issued a challenge
to Army, which didn't even have an
eleven. Predictably, the Midship
men won that one, 24-0.
Although two years ago there
was an abortive attempt to move
the game to Pasadena, it is back in
Philadelphia, where 64 games have
been played at Franklin Field, JFK
Stadium and Veterans Stadium.
This year's game is the fifth at the
Vet.
Alabama (7-2-1) vs. Auburn (8-
2) at Birmingham
The 50th anniversary of the Iron
Bowl, played at Legion Field in the
steel center of the South, sees Ala
bama holding a 29-19-1 lead. The
series began in 1892 with a 32-22
Auburn win, but was cancelled in
1907 by mutual disagreement.
It took a law passed by the Ala
bama State Legislature in 1947 to
renew the series, which has now
been played continuously since
1948 in Birmingham.
This one is scheduled for next
Saturday, which, being Thanksgiv
ing break, precludes much in the
way of tradition. Yet, the rivalry
runs deep and year-long between
the two intrastate foes.
Nebraska (9-1) at Oklahoma
(7-1)
Talk about football tradition. In

the 57 seasons since the current
Big Eight got its start in 1928, Ne
braska has won or shared the title
23 times, Oklahoma 30 times. One
of the two has gone to the Orange
Bowl all but two seasons since
1962, and this year appears to be
no exception.
The Sooners hold a 35-27-3 edge
going into the 66th meeting in Nor
man. Nebraska took a 13-9 decision
in the first game in 1912. The se
ries has been continuous since
1928.
Thefe was a tradition in this
game of throwing oranges onto the
field after your team scored, but it
was discontinued after a policeman
was knocked unconscious by one a
couple years back. Those things
are deadlier than bagels.
There's a serious lack of activity
in Norman this week, largely be
cause the Texas game in mid-
October generates a large student
interest, despite being a non
conference game. The two border
each other, and one can forget that
someone decided to put Kansas be
tween Norman and Lincoln.
Oregon State (3-7) at Oregon
(4-5)
Talk about lack of football tradi
tion. Oregon's finally going to a
bowl this year the Mirage Bowl
in Tokyo, a pre-arranged matchup
with USC. In their most recent
bowl the 1983 Donut Bowl in
Eugene both teams futilely
sloshed to a 0-0 tie.

They call it the Civil War, and it
dates back to 1894 when Oregon
defeated then-Oregon Agricultural
College, 16-0. It has been played
continually since 1902, and the
Ducks hold a 41-37-10 edge going
into the 89th meeting.
Unfortunately for the Beavers,
that 0-0 tie is the highlight of the
last decade, in which Oregon holds
a 9-0-1 mark. Consequently, the
game is downplayed in Corvallis a
bit.
The big prank from the U of O
side was yesterday, when the Daily
Emerald distributed bogus copies of
the Daily Barometer on the OSU
campus. It is a deed not devoid of
risk; last year the perpetrators
were pulled over by police and
ticketed for littering.
UCLA (8-1-1) at USC (4-5)
This usually decides the Pac-10
side of the Rose Bowl if Washington
doesn't go. This year it will decide
UCLA's fate. USC, on the other
hand, is going nowhere besides
Tokyo and is likely to have a rare
losing season.
In 1929, the University of Cali
fornia established a campus in
Westwood. That same year, UCLA
fielded a football team against USC.
Trojans 76, Bruins 0.
USC has continued that
dominance, leading 30-18-6 going
into the 55th meeting. The series
has been continuous since 1936.
It may be Big Game in Northern

California contest is only one of

Both teams have de-emphasized
football a bit since being the national
powerhouses of those early days of
the game. Harvard was the last to
go to the Rose Bowl in 1920.
Despite the long dry spell, fol
lowers of the winning team still
wave white hankies at the other
side as the final seconds tick down.
And if Yale should win in
Cambridge, the Yale band marches
to the statue of John Harvard,
where the drum major leads his
charges while sitting on the face of
Mr. Harvard.
Purdue (4-6) at Indiana (4-6)
The records look a lot like
Stanford-Cal. Neither team has
gone to the Rose Bowl within the
current students' lifetimes, and
there's even a trophy with a story
behind it.
The series began in 1891 with a
0-0 tie and has been continuous
since 1920. Going into the 61st
meeting, Purdue holds a command
ing 40-17-3 lead.


Rod Searcey/Daily
In its intense rivalry with Big Eight foe Nebraska, Oklahoma has a 35-27-3
edge. Between them, the two teams have been the conference
Orange Bowl representative in 21 of the past 23 seasons. When its
team scored, the students used to throw oranges onto the field - until
a policeman was knocked unconscious by one.
The trophy is the Old Oaken
Bucket. When a group of alumni
from the two schools met in
Chicago in 1925, they proposed the
creation of a trophy to go to the
winner of the game. A bucket was
chosen as "the most typical form of
a Hoosier trophy." They found it on
a farm in a well dug during the
1840's, and today the winning
school attaches a block letter "P" or
"I" after winning the game.
Penn State (10-0) at Pittsburgh
(5-4-1)
Not a lot of extracurriculars
here. Just good football. First
played in 1893, this series sees the
Nittany Lions holding a slim 41-39-4
lead going into the 85th meeting.
The no-frills approach to football
seems to have worked. Pitt won
the national title in 1976; Penn
State won it all in 1982 and is two
wins away from turning that trick
again.
Joe Paterno may be 14-4-1
against the Panthers, but don't
count Pitt out. Last year they came
into the game with a 2-7-1 record
and left with a 31-11 victory.
Army (8-2) vs. Navy (3-7) at
Philadelphia
The traditional service academy
game, this will be the 86th meeting
since 1890. Navy holds a 40-38-7
lead; however, Army broke a six

game winless string with a 20-11
triumph last year.
This one began when Navy,
which then had an organized team
for eight years, issued a challenge
to Army, which didn't even have an
eleven. Predictably, the Midship
men won that one, 24-0.
Although two years ago there
was an abortive attempt to move
the game to Pasadena, it is back in
Philadelphia, where 64 games have
been played at Franklin Field, JFK
Stadium and Veterans Stadium.
This year's game is the fifth at the
Vet.
Alabama (7-2-1) vs. Auburn (8-
2) at Birmingham
The 50th anniversary of the Iron
Bowl, played at Legion Field in the
steel center of the South, sees Ala
bama holding a 29-19-1 lead. The
series began in 1892 with a 32-22
Auburn win, but was cancelled in
1907 by mutual disagreement.
It took a law passed by the Ala
bama State Legislature in 1947 to
renew the series, which has now
been played continuously since
1948 in Birmingham.
This one is scheduled for next
Saturday, which, being Thanksgiv
ing break, precludes much in the
way of tradition. Yet, the rivalry
runs deep and year-long between
the two intrastate foes.
Nebraska (9-1) at Oklahoma
(7-1)
Talk about football tradition. In

the 57 seasons since the current
Big Eight got its start in 1928, Ne
braska has won or shared the title
23 times, Oklahoma 30 times. One
of the two has gone to the Orange
Bowl all but two seasons since
1962, and this year appears to be
no exception.
The Sooners hold a 35-27-3 edge
going into the 66th meeting in Nor
man. Nebraska took a 13-9 decision
in the first game in 1912. The se
ries has been continuous since
1928.
Thefe was a tradition in this
game of throwing oranges onto the
field after your team scored, but it
was discontinued after a policeman
was knocked unconscious by one a
couple years back. Those things
are deadlier than bagels.
There's a serious lack of activity
in Norman this week, largely be
cause the Texas game in mid-
October generates a large student
interest, despite being a non
conference game. The two border
each other, and one can forget that
someone decided to put Kansas be
tween Norman and Lincoln.
Oregon State (3-7) at Oregon
(4-5)
Talk about lack of football tradi
tion. Oregon's finally going to a
bowl this year the Mirage Bowl
in Tokyo, a pre-arranged matchup
with USC. In their most recent
bowl the 1983 Donut Bowl in
Eugene both teams futilely
sloshed to a 0-0 tie.

They call it the Civil War, and it
dates back to 1894 when Oregon
defeated then-Oregon Agricultural
College, 16-0. It has been played
continually since 1902, and the
Ducks hold a 41-37-10 edge going
into the 89th meeting.
Unfortunately for the Beavers,
that 0-0 tie is the highlight of the
last decade, in which Oregon holds
a 9-0-1 mark. Consequently, the
game is downplayed in Corvallis a
bit.
The big prank from the U of O
side was yesterday, when the Daily
Emerald distributed bogus copies of
the Daily Barometer on the OSU
campus. It is a deed not devoid of
risk; last year the perpetrators
were pulled over by police and
ticketed for littering.
UCLA (8-1-1) at USC (4-5)
This usually decides the Pac-10
side of the Rose Bowl if Washington
doesn't go. This year it will decide
UCLA's fate. USC, on the other
hand, is going nowhere besides
Tokyo and is likely to have a rare
losing season.
In 1929, the University of Cali
fornia established a campus in
Westwood. That same year, UCLA
fielded a football team against USC.
Trojans 76, Bruins 0.
USC has continued that
dominance, leading 30-18-6 going
into the 55th meeting. The series
has been continuous since 1936.
It may be Big Game in Northern
California, but today's Stanford-
California contest is only one of
many longstanding rivalries being
played. Some will have a large
■bearing on the postseason bowl
picture; some are only for a
timeworn trophy or regional brag
ging rights. Few, though, have the
tradition that Big Game can boast.
Ohio State (8-2) at Michigan
(8-1-1)
This is one of the biggest games
in terms of what it means every
year and how seriously the states
take it. For 17 of the past 18 years,
one of these teams has either won
or shared the Big Ten title, and in
15 of those years, this game has de
termined it. The winner has gone to
the Rose Bowl in nine of the past 11
years.
The teams first met in 1899, and
the Wolverines hold a 44-32-5 ad
vantage. Since OSU joined what
would become the Big Ten in 1913,

the teams are even at 32-32-3. The
game has been played continuously
since 1943, and this will be the 82nd
meeting.
Every year, the shops along High
Street, the main street on the Ohio
State campus, are boarded up as
tens of thousands of Buckeye fans
take to the streets when the Bucks
win, filling the dozens of bars
around campus.
Ann Arbor is a little calmer, but
the game is taken seriously as well.
To be one of the 105,000 people in
the sold-out stadium, some were of
fering $lOO per ticket for the sold
out showdown.
As usual, the politicians have got
ten into the act. Sen. Donald Riegel
(D-Mich.) has a bet with Sen. John
Glenn (D-Ohio) that the loser must
wear the T-shirt of the winning
school in the Senate.
Harvard (7-2) at Yale (3-4-1)
Calling it The Game may be
pretentious, but the rivalry is the
third longest around. Harvard won
the first meeting in 1875, 4-0, but
trails the series 55-35-8. The Game
has been played continually except
during the war years since 1897. It

has been the season finale since
1919.
Both teams have de-emphasized
football a bit since being the national
powerhouses of those early days of
the game. Harvard was the last to
go to the Rose Bowl in 1920.

Joe Paterno may be 14-4-1
against the Panthers, but don't
count Pitt out. Last year they came
into the game with a 2-7-1 record
and left with a 31-11 victory.
Army (8-2) vs. Navy (3-7) at
Philadelphia
The traditional service academy
game, this will be the 86th meeting
since 1890. Navy holds a 40-38-7
lead; however, Army broke a six

game winless string with a 20-11
triumph last year.
This one began when Navy,
which then had an organized team
for eight years, issued a challenge
to Army, which didn't even have an
eleven. Predictably, the Midship
men won that one, 24-0.
Although two years ago there
was an abortive attempt to move
the game to Pasadena, it is back in
Philadelphia, where 64 games have
been played at Franklin Field, JFK
Stadium and Veterans Stadium.
This year's game is the fifth at the
Vet.
Alabama (7-2-1) vs. Auburn (8-
2) at Birmingham
The 50th anniversary of the Iron
Bowl, played at Legion Field in the
steel center of the South, sees Ala
bama holding a 29-19-1 lead. The
series began in 1892 with a 32-22
Auburn win, but was cancelled in
1907 by mutual disagreement.
It took a law passed by the Ala
bama State Legislature in 1947 to
renew the series, which has now
been played continuously since
1948 in Birmingham.
This one is scheduled for next
Saturday, which, being Thanksgiv
ing break, precludes much in the
way of tradition. Yet, the rivalry
runs deep and year-long between
the two intrastate foes.
Nebraska (9-1) at Oklahoma
(7-1)
Talk about football tradition. In

the 57 seasons since the current
Big Eight got its start in 1928, Ne
braska has won or shared the title
23 times, Oklahoma 30 times. One
of the two has gone to the Orange
Bowl all but two seasons since
1962, and this year appears to be
no exception.
The Sooners hold a 35-27-3 edge
going into the 66th meeting in Nor
man. Nebraska took a 13-9 decision
in the first game in 1912. The se
ries has been continuous since
1928.
Thefe was a tradition in this
game of throwing oranges onto the
field after your team scored, but it
was discontinued after a policeman
was knocked unconscious by one a
couple years back. Those things
are deadlier than bagels.
There's a serious lack of activity
in Norman this week, largely be
cause the Texas game in mid-
October generates a large student
interest, despite being a non
conference game. The two border
each other, and one can forget that
someone decided to put Kansas be
tween Norman and Lincoln.
Oregon State (3-7) at Oregon
(4-5)
Talk about lack of football tradi
tion. Oregon's finally going to a
bowl this year the Mirage Bowl
in Tokyo, a pre-arranged matchup
with USC. In their most recent
bowl the 1983 Donut Bowl in
Eugene both teams futilely
sloshed to a 0-0 tie.

They call it the Civil War, and it
dates back to 1894 when Oregon
defeated then-Oregon Agricultural
College, 16-0. It has been played
continually since 1902, and the
Ducks hold a 41-37-10 edge going
into the 89th meeting.
Unfortunately for the Beavers,
that 0-0 tie is the highlight of the
last decade, in which Oregon holds
a 9-0-1 mark. Consequently, the
game is downplayed in Corvallis a
bit.
The big prank from the U of O
side was yesterday, when the Daily
Emerald distributed bogus copies of
the Daily Barometer on the OSU
campus. It is a deed not devoid of
risk; last year the perpetrators
were pulled over by police and
ticketed for littering.
UCLA (8-1-1) at USC (4-5)
This usually decides the Pac-10
side of the Rose Bowl if Washington
doesn't go. This year it will decide
UCLA's fate. USC, on the other
hand, is going nowhere besides
Tokyo and is likely to have a rare
losing season.
In 1929, the University of Cali
fornia established a campus in
Westwood. That same year, UCLA
fielded a football team against USC.
Trojans 76, Bruins 0.
USC has continued that
dominance, leading 30-18-6 going
into the 55th meeting. The series
has been continuous since 1936.
It may be Big Game in Northern
California, but today's Stanford-
California contest is only one of
many longstanding rivalries being
played. Some will have a large
■bearing on the postseason bowl
picture; some are only for a
timeworn trophy or regional brag
ging rights. Few, though, have the
tradition that Big Game can boast.
Ohio State (8-2) at Michigan
(8-1-1)
This is one of the biggest games
in terms of what it means every
year and how seriously the states
take it. For 17 of the past 18 years,
one of these teams has either won
or shared the Big Ten title, and in
15 of those years, this game has de
termined it. The winner has gone to
the Rose Bowl in nine of the past 11
years.
The teams first met in 1899, and
the Wolverines hold a 44-32-5 ad
vantage. Since OSU joined what
would become the Big Ten in 1913,

the teams are even at 32-32-3. The
game has been played continuously
since 1943, and this will be the 82nd
meeting.
Every year, the shops along High
Street, the main street on the Ohio
State campus, are boarded up as
tens of thousands of Buckeye fans
take to the streets when the Bucks
win, filling the dozens of bars
around campus.
Ann Arbor is a little calmer, but
the game is taken seriously as well.
To be one of the 105,000 people in
the sold-out stadium, some were of
fering $lOO per ticket for the sold
out showdown.
As usual, the politicians have got
ten into the act. Sen. Donald Riegel
(D-Mich.) has a bet with Sen. John
Glenn (D-Ohio) that the loser must
wear the T-shirt of the winning
school in the Senate.
Harvard (7-2) at Yale (3-4-1)
Calling it The Game may be
pretentious, but the rivalry is the
third longest around. Harvard won
the first meeting in 1875, 4-0, but
trails the series 55-35-8. The Game
has been played continually except
during the war years since 1897. It

has been the season finale since
1919.
Both teams have de-emphasized
football a bit since being the national
powerhouses of those early days of
the game. Harvard was the last to
go to the Rose Bowl in 1920.
Despite the long dry spell, fol
lowers of the winning team still
wave white hankies at the other
side as the final seconds tick down.
And if Yale should win in
Cambridge, the Yale band marches
to the statue of John Harvard,
where the drum major leads his
charges while sitting on the face of
Mr. Harvard.
Purdue (4-6) at Indiana (4-6)
The records look a lot like
Stanford-Cal. Neither team has
gone to the Rose Bowl within the
current students' lifetimes, and
there's even a trophy with a story
behind it.
The series began in 1891 with a
0-0 tie and has been continuous
since 1920. Going into the 61st
meeting, Purdue holds a command
ing 40-17-3 lead.


Rod Searcey/Daily
In its intense rivalry with Big Eight foe Nebraska, Oklahoma has a 35-27-3
edge. Between them, the two teams have been the conference
Orange Bowl representative in 21 of the past 23 seasons. When its
team scored, the students used to throw oranges onto the field - until
a policeman was knocked unconscious by one.
The trophy is the Old Oaken
Bucket. When a group of alumni
from the two schools met in
Chicago in 1925, they proposed the
creation of a trophy to go to the
winner of the game. A bucket was
chosen as "the most typical form of
a Hoosier trophy." They found it on
a farm in a well dug during the
1840's, and today the winning
school attaches a block letter "P" or
"I" after winning the game.
Penn State (10-0) at Pittsburgh
(5-4-1)
Not a lot of extracurriculars
here. Just good football. First
played in 1893, this series sees the
Nittany Lions holding a slim 41-39-4
lead going into the 85th meeting.
The no-frills approach to football
seems to have worked. Pitt won
the national title in 1976; Penn
State won it all in 1982 and is two
wins away from turning that trick
again.
Joe Paterno may be 14-4-1
against the Panthers, but don't
count Pitt out. Last year they came
into the game with a 2-7-1 record
and left with a 31-11 victory.
