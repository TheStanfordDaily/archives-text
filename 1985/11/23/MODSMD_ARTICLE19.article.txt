# Band Considers Plans For Its Weenie Roast
## 
### 
What? No way! The season is almost over?
Cal? Our archenemies are coming here? Watch
out!
So dudes and dudelettes this is the BEEEG
GAME. Actually, it doesn't look much bigger than
the other games. But, hey! I don't mind.
The Band has tried to make many jabs at the
Weenies in the past. . . SO, today we draw the line.
During our pre-game show we will trace back
over some key Axe events in history that is,
after we show you all what the Axe looks like.
Remember, if you will, the Immortal 21. Cal
Weenies are forever vain. In a flash, the Axe was
ours again. The "21" Blinded the Weenies with Sci
ence.
No, we haven't forgotten the Play . . . Stanford
really won. Then Cal said, 'Where's the Axe? She's
Not There." In fact, she's here at Stanford. Damn

Here's where the line is drawn. We will continue
to tease Weenies.
What to do with dead Cal members . . . Door
Stops . . . Hey, there Ain't Nothin' Stoppin' us.
LAND FILL . . . stuff like that. Palo Alto needs a
new rat playground.
Fro' Yo-' topping . . . they'd have Popsicle Toes
. . . maybe we could dip them in carob.
Of course we could sell them to Toyota as test
crash dummies. We could sell 'em to Stanford as bol
lards ....
I've got it! Since Cal students funnelate fruit at
us, we'll funnelate Cal band members at fruit!
Well, it's been nice talking at you this season.
Bye.
(Editor's note: This will, indeed, be the last Band
story of the football season. There is a merciful God.)
