# Card Grinds Down Bears
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
Taking a cue from the Ohio State-Michigan game
played earlier in the day, Stanford brought its version
of the Big Ten's three-yards-and-an-Astroturf-burn of
fense to Memorial Stadium, bringing the Axe back to
the Farm for the first time since 1981 with a 27-10 win
over California.
The game wasn't artistic, but it was decisive. The
Cardinal ground attack simply went around, over and
through the Bears' defense on its way to 322 rushing
yards, including 204 by fullback Brad Muster and 102
by tailback Thomas Henley.
A 12-yard touchdown pass from Gale Gilbert to
Keith Cockett helped Cal to a 10-0 lead in the second
quarter. But then John Paye came on at quarterback
for Stanford, and the Cardinal comeback began.
After two Mark Harmon field goals cut the Bears' ad
vantage to 10-6, Paye lofted a 3-yard scoring toss to
Emile Harry with five seconds remaining in the half to
put Stanford ahead for good.
Cal drove to the Stanford 15-yard line early in the
second half, but was stopped on downs. The Cardinal

then proceeded to march 85 yards on 11 plays, nine of
them runs. The climax of the drive was a 7-yard TD
scamper by Henley. A quarterback sneak from the Cal
1-yard line by Paye closed out the scoring in the fourth
quarter.
Simply put, the game was dominated by the Stanford
offensive line and defense. The line, consisting of Jeff
Deaton, Matt Moran, Brent Martin, Scott Carpenter
and John Barns, ripped gaping holes in the Cal defense
all day long.
Paye completed only she passes for 62 yards, but
with the line having its way up front, the Cardinal was
content just to ram the ball down the Bears' throats.
"We finally got a team we outmanned, and I think that
really showed," Moran said. "Looking at the films, we
knew we could run the ball against them. Everything
was pretty much working."
Including the defense. The Stanford secondary had
been criticized harshly, even by The Daily, but against
Cal it turned in the season's best performance, holding
the Bears to 145 yards through the air.
Cornerback Toi Cook held wide receiver Ranee
McDougald to one catch while intercepting two him
self. "It looked to me like they were trying to pick on
him," Stanford Coach Jack Elway said. "And it didn't
work."
