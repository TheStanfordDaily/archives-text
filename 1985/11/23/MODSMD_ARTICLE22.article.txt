# Explosive Hicks Makes an Immediate Impact
## Cal frosh could soon be one of the nation's finest 
### TOM GILLESPIE Staff writer 
After suffering through a dismal
2-9 season in 1984, California foot
ball fans were looking for something
to show them that Cal's football
future would be brighter than its
present.
On the day that freshman running
back Marc Hicks announced his in
tention to enroll at Cal, Bear fans
were promised the future they had
been hoping for.
Hicks was one of the most highly
prized recruits in the nation last
year and turned down offers from
such schools as Ohio State, Penn
State, Nebraska and Washington in
order to attend Cal. No less an au
thority than Penn State Coach Joe
Paterno dubbed him "the top run
ning back to come out of high school
in the last five years."
Hicks earned these high praises
after a legendary prep career at
Davis High School. In two years of
varsity football, he ran for 2,668
yards and 39 touchdowns and still
found time to be his team's leading
passer and punter, averaging over
40 yards a kick.
In addition, Hicks played basket
ball and ran track, posting a per
sonal best of 23 feet and 11 1/2
inches in the long jump. He was
also selected by the Minnesota
Twins in baseball's amateur draft.
With his athletic versatility, it
was apparent that Hicks had the

ability to contribute to Cal football
right away. "Each freshman is
evaluated to see how he fits in with
the team," Cal Running Back Coach
Jerry Hardaway said.
"It was our initial feeling that
Marc was going to be very much of
an asset to our ball club this year,
and I think it's safe to say that he's
proven that decision to be correct,"
he said.
Hicks has made the most of his
somewhat limited playing time as a
freshman. He has piled up 515
yards rushing over the season, in
cluding a 139-yard effort on 14
carries against Missouri. In addi
tion, he has taken over the punting
duties, averaging 37 yards a kick.
Throughout the season, Hicks
has displayed a knack for making
the big play. He is responsible for
the longest run, longest kickoff
return and longest pass play for Cal
this year. With 4.4 speed in the 40
and a 6-foot-3, 200-pound frame, he
is a very difficult man to bring
down.
"Marc Hicks," said Stanford
Coach Jack Elway, "is truly a tre
mendous running back. Cal has a
big-play dimension with that type of
back. He's got that speed, and he's
got the instincts. He also has size
and he has the moves. It's obvious
he's a premier running back."
Hardaway concurs: "He is the
type of runner that can consistently
gain good yardage against you, and

if you slack off on defense, he can
break it long. He has a tremendous
ability to read his blocks as he runs
downfield."
In Cal's last game, a 14-6 upset
of USC, Hicks played a key role.
Running out of a relatively new of
fensive set known as the "C
-formation," which features three
running backs, he gained 113 yards
on 22 carries while scoring both of
Cal's touchdowns. For his perfor
mance, he was named Pacific 10 Of
fensive Player of the Week.
Today, the Cardinal defense will
have to try to stop this new forma
tion, which promises to put the ball
in Hicks' hands a good deal of the
time.
"I would assume that they are
going to try to get the ball to him as
much as possible," said Stanford
linebacker Matt Soderlund. "He's
their main breakaway threat, and
they seem LO have better games
when he plays a larger role in the
offense. Our job is to make sure we
execute our defense, and don't let
him break a big play on us."
Having grown up in Northern Cal
ifornia, Hicks is excited about the
prospect of playing in his first Big
Game. "It's going to be a very spe
cial game for me. This is a great
rivalry, and no matter how good the
teams are, there is always a lot at
stake. It should be a close, hard
hitting ball game, and a fun game in
general," Hicks said.
As for his future, the overall con

sensus is that he can only get bet
ter. "The main facet of his game
that needs to be improved is his
knowledge of our offense," Har
daway said.
"As he gains more experience
with our system, he'll be able to
concentrate more on just playing. I
think you can look forward to great
things as Marc matures, because he
has outstanding athletic talent," he
added.

"He's a remarkable young man,"
Cal Coach Joe Kapp said. "He
brings a confidence and an enthusi
asm to our whole team. He's a very
dangerous man to defense."
Hicks himself seems to be very
much enjoying his freshman year.
"It's been a lot of fun this year. The
future of this team looks great, and
I'm really looking forward to next
year. Cal's going to be very tough,
so look out Stanford!"

Penn State Coach Joe Paterno called Cal freshman Marc Hicks "the
top running back to come out of high school in the last five years."
And it's not hard to see why. Hicks' 113-yard, two-touchdown effort in
the Bears' 14-6 upset of USC earned him Pac-10 Offensive Player of
the Week honors.
