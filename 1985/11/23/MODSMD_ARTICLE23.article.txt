# Card Rush Finally Putting the Heat on
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Editorial staff 
But that's not the kind of rush they or De
fensive Coordinator Dick Mannini looked for.
After the San Diego State game, the line
managed only two sacks in the next three
games all losses. Stanford surrendered
many points during that stretch 124 to be
exact.
The go-nowhere pass rush had a lot to do
with that.
"I don't care how good a defensive back
you are, you can only cover a receiver so
long," said Toi Cook, Stanford's left corner
back. "With all day to throw, quarterbacks
can stand back there and pick you apart."
That adds up to trouble: plenty of comple-

For much of the year, Stanford's defensive
linemen have been spinning their wheels
when rushing the passer. Try as they might,
they just haven't gotten anywhere.
Aside from opening day, when Stanford re
corded five quarterback sacks against a push
over San Jose State offensive line, the early
season pass rush didn't rush much of anything
at all.
And when they did rush, it was often to the
sideline having surrendered a long touch
down pass.

tions, yards and something Stanford's
defense knows all too much about big
plays.
"Except for the San Jose State game, we
weren't getting the big rush that we needed,"
said sophomore nose guard Eric Volta.
Then things started slowly coming to
gether. By this year's fifth game, the defen
sive line, which didn't return a single starter
from last year, began to mesh.
"I think we started to minimize mistakes
starting with UCLA," Mannini said.
In the seventh week against Arizona, when
the team snapped a five-game losing streak
with a 28-17 win, everything clicked for the
defensive line. The pass rushers hounded
Wildcat quaterback Alfred Jenkins all after
noon, dumping him for losses three times.
Two weeks later, the line came through
again. The unit recorded three more sacks
against Oregon State as Stanford prevailed
39-24.
And the sacks don't tell the whole story.
"The number of sacks, although they're
meaningful, don't really show what's going
on," Mannini said. "Lately we're putting con
sistent pressure on the passer, forcing him to
throw earlier."

What's changed?
Some have speculated that new pass-rush
schemes have made the difference: more
stunts up front, some all-out blitzes and an
occasional cornerback blitz.
But really, Stanford has stuck with the
same defense all year. It's just working bet
ter now. Much better.
"We're starting to come together as a
unit," Mannini said. "It's taken awhile, but
we've stuck with what we do best."
"We're not doing much different than we

did earlier this year," said Ray Huckestein, a
freshman nose guard. "But we are getting in
there a lot more."
It hasn't been the flashy stuff, like the go
for-broke blitz, that's turned things around.
The line has turned in a workman-like job.
Solid play has come with a mastery of the de
fensive scheme and a confidence gained only
through repetition.
Mannini has witnessed with delight the
change in his line's mentality and play.
"They're executing everything, including the
stunts, better," Mannini said. "The guys are
staying in their pass-rush lanes better and
doing what we ask of them."
"Basically, the whole defensive line is
more aggressive than at the beginning of the
year," Huckestein said. "Earlier in the year
we kind of thought it (a strong pass rush)
would just happen.
"We just weren't making it happen."
Mannini attributes the new-found aggres
siveness to familiarity with the defensive sys
tem. Early in the year, Mannini felt his young
players were thinking too much.
"We understand a little more what we're
doing, and it (line play) has become almost
natural," Mannini said. "Any time you're

hesitant, and that happens when you're
unsure, aggressiveness suffers."
It was hard work that turned things around
for the once-maligned unit. It was always able
to get the ball back for the offense in a hurry.
But it was done the wrong way by allowing
one big play.
Now the linemen do it the more conven
tional way, by stuffing offenses without yield
ing loads of points. When they rush off the
field these days, it's more often than not to
the applause of Stanford fans.

sistent pressure on the passer, forcing him to
throw earlier."

What's changed?
Some have speculated that new pass-rush
schemes have made the difference: more
stunts up front, some all-out blitzes and an
occasional cornerback blitz.
But really, Stanford has stuck with the
same defense all year. It's just working bet
ter now. Much better.
"We're starting to come together as a
unit," Mannini said. "It's taken awhile, but
we've stuck with what we do best."
"We're not doing much different than we

did earlier this year," said Ray Huckestein, a
freshman nose guard. "But we are getting in
there a lot more."
It hasn't been the flashy stuff, like the go
for-broke blitz, that's turned things around.
The line has turned in a workman-like job.
Solid play has come with a mastery of the de
fensive scheme and a confidence gained only
through repetition.
Mannini has witnessed with delight the
change in his line's mentality and play.
"They're executing everything, including the
stunts, better," Mannini said. "The guys are
staying in their pass-rush lanes better and
doing what we ask of them."
"Basically, the whole defensive line is
more aggressive than at the beginning of the
year," Huckestein said. "Earlier in the year
we kind of thought it (a strong pass rush)
would just happen.
"We just weren't making it happen."
Mannini attributes the new-found aggres
siveness to familiarity with the defensive sys
tem. Early in the year, Mannini felt his young
players were thinking too much.
"We understand a little more what we're
doing, and it (line play) has become almost
natural," Mannini said. "Any time you're

hesitant, and that happens when you're
unsure, aggressiveness suffers."
It was hard work that turned things around
for the once-maligned unit. It was always able
to get the ball back for the offense in a hurry.
But it was done the wrong way by allowing
one big play.
Now the linemen do it the more conven
tional way, by stuffing offenses without yield
ing loads of points. When they rush off the
field these days, it's more often than not to
the applause of Stanford fans.

Stanford's Ray Huckestein (53) and Chris Weber (98) smother Oregon State quarter back
Rich Gonzales. In the last few games, the Cardinal defensive front has used
various stunts and combined blitzs to expediate the process to opposing signal-callers.
But that's not the kind of rush they or De
fensive Coordinator Dick Mannini looked for.
After the San Diego State game, the line
managed only two sacks in the next three
games all losses. Stanford surrendered
many points during that stretch 124 to be
exact.
The go-nowhere pass rush had a lot to do
with that.
"I don't care how good a defensive back
you are, you can only cover a receiver so
long," said Toi Cook, Stanford's left corner
back. "With all day to throw, quarterbacks
can stand back there and pick you apart."
That adds up to trouble: plenty of comple-

For much of the year, Stanford's defensive
linemen have been spinning their wheels
when rushing the passer. Try as they might,
they just haven't gotten anywhere.
Aside from opening day, when Stanford re
corded five quarterback sacks against a push
over San Jose State offensive line, the early
season pass rush didn't rush much of anything
at all.
And when they did rush, it was often to the
sideline having surrendered a long touch
down pass.

tions, yards and something Stanford's
defense knows all too much about big
plays.
"Except for the San Jose State game, we
weren't getting the big rush that we needed,"
said sophomore nose guard Eric Volta.
Then things started slowly coming to
gether. By this year's fifth game, the defen
sive line, which didn't return a single starter
from last year, began to mesh.
"I think we started to minimize mistakes
starting with UCLA," Mannini said.
In the seventh week against Arizona, when
the team snapped a five-game losing streak
with a 28-17 win, everything clicked for the
defensive line. The pass rushers hounded
Wildcat quaterback Alfred Jenkins all after
noon, dumping him for losses three times.
Two weeks later, the line came through
again. The unit recorded three more sacks
against Oregon State as Stanford prevailed
39-24.
And the sacks don't tell the whole story.
"The number of sacks, although they're
meaningful, don't really show what's going
on," Mannini said. "Lately we're putting con
sistent pressure on the passer, forcing him to
throw earlier."
