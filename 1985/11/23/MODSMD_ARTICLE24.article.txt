# Big Games: A Look at A Few of the Finest
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial Staff 
Regardless of what various local
newspapers say, it's still the
premier annual football game in
Northern California.
Hence the term "Big Game".
Rixford Snyder, Stanford's dean
of admissions fronm 1949-69 and
faculty athletic representative
from 1951-71, has seen as many of
them as just about anyone else.
The 1930 Stanford graduate has
been to 59 Big Games and knows
the local interest the game
generates. "There are a lot of
alums in the Bay Area, especially
Cal alums, and for the Stanford
people, who come from all over the

country, it is sort of a reunion
time."
"I guess it's just the tradition.
Everybody just starts getting
hyped up about it," said Buck Club
Program Manager Jack Laird, a rel
ative stranger to Big Game at 40
witnessed contests. "Where else
would get that many people to go to
a game with two teams that have
only seven wins between them?"
With the help of Snyder and
Laird, here's a review of some Big
Game highlights of the past 93
years:

Versions of the exact numbers
differ, but all accounts of the first

Big Game agree that fans outnum
bered printed tickets by about two
to one. To accomodate the specta
tors, Cal manager Herbert Lang
and Stanford manager Herbert
Hoover (who moved on to a more
important job a few years later) col
lected coins in washtubs, boxes and
whatever else was available.
The kickoff was delayed by an
hour, but not by pre-game shows or
Budweiser commercials. Nobody
brought a football. A San Francisco
sporting goods dealer, David Goul
cher, volunteered to go get one
on horseback.
When the game finally started,
Stanford's Garl Clemens took over.
His pair of 45-yard touchdown runs
keyed the victory.

The Memorial Stadium scoreboard shows the aftermath of Cal's five lateral
kickoff return that won the 1982 Big Game for the Bears. Stanford
contended that it had stopped Dwight Garner at about midfield,
but the officials ruled otherwise.
