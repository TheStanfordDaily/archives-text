# Big Games: A Look at A Few of the Finest
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial Staff 
Regardless of what various local
newspapers say, it's still the
premier annual football game in
Northern California.
Hence the term "Big Game".
Rixford Snyder, Stanford's dean
of admissions fronm 1949-69 and
faculty athletic representative
from 1951-71, has seen as many of
them as just about anyone else.
The 1930 Stanford graduate has
been to 59 Big Games and knows
the local interest the game
generates. "There are a lot of
alums in the Bay Area, especially
Cal alums, and for the Stanford
people, who come from all over the

country, it is sort of a reunion
time."
"I guess it's just the tradition.
Everybody just starts getting
hyped up about it," said Buck Club
Program Manager Jack Laird, a rel
ative stranger to Big Game at 40
witnessed contests. "Where else
would get that many people to go to
a game with two teams that have
only seven wins between them?"
With the help of Snyder and
Laird, here's a review of some Big
Game highlights of the past 93
years:
1892: Stanford 14, California
10
Versions of the exact numbers
differ, but all accounts of the first

Big Game agree that fans outnum
bered printed tickets by about two
to one. To accomodate the specta
tors, Cal manager Herbert Lang
and Stanford manager Herbert
Hoover (who moved on to a more
important job a few years later) col
lected coins in washtubs, boxes and
whatever else was available.
The kickoff was delayed by an
hour, but not by pre-game shows or
Budweiser commercials. Nobody
brought a football. A San Francisco
sporting goods dealer, David Goul
cher, volunteered to go get one
on horseback.
When the game finally started,
Stanford's Garl Clemens took over.
His pair of 45-yard touchdown runs
keyed the victory.

The Memorial Stadium scoreboard shows the aftermath of Cal's five lateral
kickoff return that won the 1982 Big Game for the Bears. Stanford
contended that it had stopped Dwight Garner at about midfield,
but the officials ruled otherwise.
1924: California 20, Stanford
20
The Cardinal stormed back from
a 20-6 deficit in the final few
minutes to salvage a tie, which gave
Stanford the Pacific Coast champi
onship and a berth in the 1925 Rose
Bowl against Notre Dame. In those
days, the Pacific Coast included
Washington, Idaho, USC, Oregon,
Washington State and Montana.
"It was a triumph of the (Stanford
Coach Pop) Warner over the firmly
established Smith system," said the
Daily Palo Alto's David Meiklejohn.
"Not a triumph because Stanford
failed to win, but because California
had a chance to win and didn't."

"The old-timers say that was the
greatest of all Big Games," Snyder
said.
The Cardinal then fell 27-10 to an
Irish team led by a backfield of men
named Layden, Crowley, Miller and
Stublidreher better known as
"The Four Horsemen".
1974: Stanford 22, California
20
USC had already clinched the
conference Rose Bowl bid, but that
didn't diminish the excitement of
Mike Langford's 50-yard field goal
on the game's final play that put
Stanford into second place in the
Pacific 8.
With the Bears leading 10-3, the
Cardinal offense finally got un
tracked in the second half. A

Langford field goal, a touchdown
run by Scott Laidlaw and a 61-yard
bomb from Guy Benjamin to Tony
Hill gave Stanford a 19-10 advan
tage. Cal was down, but not yet
out.
After a Jim Breech field goal, Cal
quarterback Steve Bartkowski hit
wide receiver Steve Rivera, who
caught nine passes for 205 yards,
with a 13-yard touchdown pass,
setting off what The Daily's Tim
Ferguson called "the greatest
response from Berkeleyites since
the Free Speech Movement."
But now it was Benjamin's turn
to be a hero. With only 27 seconds
left, he got the Cardinal to the
Bears' 33-yard line with two
seconds to spare. "I remember sit
ting there with my girlfriend, and
she said, 'He's never gonna make

it,'" Laird said. "But I said, What
else can you try from there?'"
The answer was nothing. For
tunately for the Cardinal, nothing
else was needed, as Langford's kick
wobbled over the cross bar to keep
the Axe on the Farm.
1982: California 25, Stanford
20
Whether one calls it "The Play"
or "The 11-20-85 Robbery," Cal's
57-yard, five-lateral kickoff return
will always be remembered as the
most bizzare ending to any Big
Game.
With four seconds left and Stan
ford leading 20-19, Mark Harmon
squibbed a kickoff downfield that
was fielded by Cal's Kevin Moen.
Moen then pitched the ball to Rich

ard Rodgers, who quickly lateralled
it to Dwight Garner. Garner ap
peared to be stopped, but managed
to get the ball back to Rodgers,
who pitched it to Mariet Ford.
Ford made the final lateral, a
blind flip to Moen. All that stood be
tween Moen and the end zone was
the Stanford Band. Moen weaved
his way through the musicians, then
trampled a trombone player as he
scored the winning touchdown.
Even without The Play, the
game would have been one of the
series' most exciting. The Cardinal
drove 62 yards in the final minutes
for a seemingly game-winning field
goal. The key play in the drive was
a 29-yard pass from John Elway to
Emile Harry on fourth-and-17 from
the Stanford 13-yard line.
Regardless of what various local
newspapers say, it's still the
premier annual football game in

to one. To accomodate the specta
tors, Cal manager Herbert Lang
and Stanford manager Herbert
Hoover (who moved on to a more
important job a few years later) col
lected coins in washtubs, boxes and
whatever else was available.
The kickoff was delayed by an
hour, but not by pre-game shows or
Budweiser commercials. Nobody
brought a football. A San Francisco
sporting goods dealer, David Goul
cher, volunteered to go get one
on horseback.
When the game finally started,
Stanford's Garl Clemens took over.
His pair of 45-yard touchdown runs
keyed the victory.

The Memorial Stadium scoreboard shows the aftermath of Cal's five lateral
kickoff return that won the 1982 Big Game for the Bears. Stanford
contended that it had stopped Dwight Garner at about midfield,
but the officials ruled otherwise.

The Cardinal stormed back from
a 20-6 deficit in the final few
minutes to salvage a tie, which gave
Stanford the Pacific Coast champi
onship and a berth in the 1925 Rose
Bowl against Notre Dame. In those
days, the Pacific Coast included
Washington, Idaho, USC, Oregon,
Washington State and Montana.
"It was a triumph of the (Stanford
Coach Pop) Warner over the firmly
established Smith system," said the
Daily Palo Alto's David Meiklejohn.
"Not a triumph because Stanford
failed to win, but because California
had a chance to win and didn't."

"The old-timers say that was the
greatest of all Big Games," Snyder
said.
The Cardinal then fell 27-10 to an
Irish team led by a backfield of men
named Layden, Crowley, Miller and
Stublidreher better known as
"The Four Horsemen".

USC had already clinched the
conference Rose Bowl bid, but that
didn't diminish the excitement of
Mike Langford's 50-yard field goal
on the game's final play that put
Stanford into second place in the
Pacific 8.
With the Bears leading 10-3, the
Cardinal offense finally got un
tracked in the second half. A

Langford field goal, a touchdown
run by Scott Laidlaw and a 61-yard
bomb from Guy Benjamin to Tony
Hill gave Stanford a 19-10 advan
tage. Cal was down, but not yet
out.
After a Jim Breech field goal, Cal
quarterback Steve Bartkowski hit
wide receiver Steve Rivera, who
caught nine passes for 205 yards,
with a 13-yard touchdown pass,
setting off what The Daily's Tim
Ferguson called "the greatest
response from Berkeleyites since
the Free Speech Movement."
But now it was Benjamin's turn
to be a hero. With only 27 seconds
left, he got the Cardinal to the
Bears' 33-yard line with two
seconds to spare. "I remember sit
ting there with my girlfriend, and
she said, 'He's never gonna make

it,'" Laird said. "But I said, What
else can you try from there?'"
The answer was nothing. For
tunately for the Cardinal, nothing
else was needed, as Langford's kick
wobbled over the cross bar to keep
the Axe on the Farm.

Whether one calls it "The Play"
or "The 11-20-85 Robbery," Cal's
57-yard, five-lateral kickoff return
will always be remembered as the
most bizzare ending to any Big
Game.
With four seconds left and Stan
ford leading 20-19, Mark Harmon
squibbed a kickoff downfield that
was fielded by Cal's Kevin Moen.
Moen then pitched the ball to Rich

ard Rodgers, who quickly lateralled
it to Dwight Garner. Garner ap
peared to be stopped, but managed
to get the ball back to Rodgers,
who pitched it to Mariet Ford.
Ford made the final lateral, a
blind flip to Moen. All that stood be
tween Moen and the end zone was
the Stanford Band. Moen weaved
his way through the musicians, then
trampled a trombone player as he
scored the winning touchdown.
Even without The Play, the
game would have been one of the
series' most exciting. The Cardinal
drove 62 yards in the final minutes
for a seemingly game-winning field
goal. The key play in the drive was
a 29-yard pass from John Elway to
Emile Harry on fourth-and-17 from
the Stanford 13-yard line.
Regardless of what various local
newspapers say, it's still the
premier annual football game in
Northern California.
Hence the term "Big Game".
Rixford Snyder, Stanford's dean
of admissions fronm 1949-69 and
faculty athletic representative
from 1951-71, has seen as many of
them as just about anyone else.
The 1930 Stanford graduate has
been to 59 Big Games and knows
the local interest the game
generates. "There are a lot of
alums in the Bay Area, especially
Cal alums, and for the Stanford
people, who come from all over the

country, it is sort of a reunion
time."
"I guess it's just the tradition.
Everybody just starts getting
hyped up about it," said Buck Club
Program Manager Jack Laird, a rel
ative stranger to Big Game at 40
witnessed contests. "Where else
would get that many people to go to
a game with two teams that have
only seven wins between them?"
With the help of Snyder and
Laird, here's a review of some Big
Game highlights of the past 93
years:
