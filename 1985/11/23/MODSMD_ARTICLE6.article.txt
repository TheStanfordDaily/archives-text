# Stanford Takes on Cal in 88th Big Game
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Editorial staff 
At the beginning of the season, as Stanford
methodically marched down the field at will
against an out-manned San Jose State squad,
many Cardinal faithful, amicably quaffing
down a beverage or two, rose and repeatedly
chanted "Rose Bowl."
This Pasadena quasi-delirium ended
shortly thereafter, somewhere near San
Diego. Still, even after a couple of setbacks,
some optimistic Stanford followers harbored
thoughts of a possible extra like the Indepen
dence or Cherry Bowl.
Unfortunately, with the Cardinal now
hovering steady at 3-7 and the Garden State
Bowl out of existence, postseason action for
most Cardinal football players will most likely
refer to intramural basketball.
Thus, Cardinal fans will have to fall back on
the familiar, perhaps the most gratifying of all
Stanford football hopes a victory over the
California Bears.
The task, however, will not be an easy
one.
This is a different Bear squad from last
year's, which finished 2-9 and tied for last
place in the Pacific 10 Conference with the
perennial cellar gatekeeper Oregon State.
Stanford Coach Jack Elway said, "We were
a lot better on the offensive line than they
were on the defensive interior, but they are a
better defensive team this year."
Washington Coach Don James at an earlier
press conference called Cal "the most im
proved team in the (Pac-10) conference."
USC Coach Ted Tollner may well agree.
Two weeks ago, his Trojans fell to the Bears
14-6 for the first time since 1977. Against a
Trojan defense that ranked sixth nationally,
the Cal offense gained 384 total yards,
matching its season average.

The Bear offense has been led by the rush
ing triumvirate of Dwight Garner, Ed Bar
bero and freshman standout Marc Hicks.
Against USC, the threesome amassed a total
of 228 yards, with Hicks accumulating almost
half that total to raise his season rushing
count to 541 yards on 93 carries.
"They have a strong running attack and
ball-control type of team," said Elway.
"We're going to have to be a very physical
team against the run."
Cardinal defensive back Walt Harris con
curred. 'We definitely have to stop their run
ning game, option game force them to go
to the passing game."
"They show a lot of formations and try to
do a lot of things. They will try to establish
the run with Hicks out of the C-formation,"
Harris said.
The C-formation resembles the wishbone,
with Garner and Barbero lining up as twin ful
lbacks and Hicks set further back, split be
tween the two.
If Cal quarterback Kevin Brown opts not to
hand off, he'll probably look downfield for
wide receiver Vince Delego, who leads the
team with 29 receptions, averaging 11 yards
per catch.
Garner also poses a receiving threat,
flaring out of the backfield a la Stanford's Brad
Muster, though not as often. His 116 total
catches is an all-time record for a Bear back.
But, the men in blue and gold will face a
rejuvenated Cardinal defense, which in the
last few games has been tougher, crankier
even down-right stubborn.
In the second half of last week's Arizona
State game, the Stanford defense held the
explosive Sun Devils scoreless, playing what
Elway succinctly called "pretty darn good
defense."
'More people have been playing within the
defensive scheme, taking care of their assign

ments without a lot of breakdowns," Harris
said. "One or two breakdowns nullifies the
whole defense."
What really annihilates the Stanford
defense are teams coming off a one-week
bye. Two such teams, Washington and USC,
defeated the Cardinal by an aggregate score
of 64-6. To extrapolate the current pace (or
cardiac-arresting jaunt), the final outcome
should be a 32-3 Cal victory.
Few predict such a score, but many an
ticipate a couple of added wrinkles blossom
ing out of the Cal offense due to the one
week vacation.
"I would expect that they are using their
extra week to put in a few new things. . .
they would be dumb not to," Harris said.
"They'll come out trying to confuse us."
What leaves most people baffled is the of
fense the Cardinal will employ. Shotgun?
Power I?
Elway attempted to elucidate. "I doubt
we'll use it (the shotgun) as much. But then
again, maybe we'll throw the ball on every
play."
'We definitely want to establish the run,"
retorted Stanford fullback Brian Morris, who
admittedly prefered the Power I to the shot
gun since it grants him "a few added
minutes."
Most likely, if past games indictate any
thing, Stanford will throw a few times, per
haps 30, 40 or 90 passes. What concerns
Morris is where these airway offerings will be
thrown.
'We have to give the quarterback time to
throw downfield," Morris said. 'We've had
the fullback catch 10 to 12 passes a game. It's
great for stats, but it doesn't win a lot of
games. We need to use the dump-off as a sec
ondary option."
For Cardinal quarterback John Paye, the
primary targets this season have been full
back Brad Muster and tight end Greg Baty,
who are first and second in Pac-10 receptions
with 72 and 59 catches, respectively.
Muster, who rushed for 61 yards last week

against ASU despite an aggravated hip
pointer, also leads Stanford in rushing with
462 yards.
To counter Muster's offensive versatility
will be Cal's inside linebacker Hardy Nicker
son, the Sports Illustrated defensive player of
the week for his 17-tackle performance
against the Trojans.
Nickerson, who Morris said "plays all over
field," has indeed adhered to that claim and
ball carriers alike. His season total of 155
tackles (85 solo) more than doubles Cal's
second-leading tackier.
While Nickerson may prove to be annoying
on the field, Cal Coach Joe Kapp is annoying
off the field especially to players he
recruits and loses to other schools.
Morris, an all-state performer from Mon
tana, was recruited by Kapp, then beginning
his first season as the Cal coach. When Morris
decided to matriculate at Stanford, Kapp
called him "a typical country boy with shit on
his boots."
Kapp further demonstrated his penchant
for the articulate by labeling Morris "a
mama's boy."
"If he wants to say those kind of things
about college players . . . well . . . that's
basically his mentality," said Morris, reflect
ing on Kapp's past derogatory comments.
In addition to winning Big Game, Morris
added that he would like to show Kapp "what
they lost with him going to Stanford."
Cardinal cornerback Toi Cook also voiced
his Big Game hopes. "It (a close game) would
be good for the spectators, but I don't really
care about them. I want to dominate Cal," he
said.
So who is going to win anyway? When
asked, Morris let his thoughts, emotions and
sense of reality fly skyward, predicting a final
count of 99-0. A few sobering seconds later,
Morris followed Newton's laws and came
back to Mother Earth, calling the game for
the Cardinal at 30-7.
Hopefully next season, it'll be a bowl
prediction.

A determined Cardinal fullback Brian Morris sets his aims straight ahead. Morris, who
has been a steady performer in place of injuried starter Brad Muster, hopes to see more
passes caught upfield instead of in the backfield. "We need to use the dump-off as a
secondary option," he said.

And in this case, the opposing ballcarrier (Oregon's Lew Barnes) will eventually fall into
the grasp of a Stanford defender - cornerback Walt Harris. Recently, the Stanford
defense has curbed its habit of relinquishing the big play, which is due to "more people
playing within the defensive scheme," according to Harris.

defense has curbed its habit of relinquishing the big play, which is due to "more people
playing within the defensive scheme," according to Harris.
At the beginning of the season, as Stanford
methodically marched down the field at will
against an out-manned San Jose State squad,
many Cardinal faithful, amicably quaffing
down a beverage or two, rose and repeatedly
chanted "Rose Bowl."
This Pasadena quasi-delirium ended
shortly thereafter, somewhere near San
Diego. Still, even after a couple of setbacks,
some optimistic Stanford followers harbored
thoughts of a possible extra like the Indepen
dence or Cherry Bowl.
Unfortunately, with the Cardinal now
hovering steady at 3-7 and the Garden State
Bowl out of existence, postseason action for
most Cardinal football players will most likely
refer to intramural basketball.
Thus, Cardinal fans will have to fall back on
the familiar, perhaps the most gratifying of all
Stanford football hopes a victory over the
California Bears.
The task, however, will not be an easy
one.
This is a different Bear squad from last
year's, which finished 2-9 and tied for last
place in the Pacific 10 Conference with the
perennial cellar gatekeeper Oregon State.
Stanford Coach Jack Elway said, "We were
a lot better on the offensive line than they
were on the defensive interior, but they are a
better defensive team this year."
Washington Coach Don James at an earlier
press conference called Cal "the most im
proved team in the (Pac-10) conference."
USC Coach Ted Tollner may well agree.
Two weeks ago, his Trojans fell to the Bears
14-6 for the first time since 1977. Against a
Trojan defense that ranked sixth nationally,
the Cal offense gained 384 total yards,
matching its season average.

The Bear offense has been led by the rush
ing triumvirate of Dwight Garner, Ed Bar
bero and freshman standout Marc Hicks.
Against USC, the threesome amassed a total
of 228 yards, with Hicks accumulating almost
half that total to raise his season rushing
count to 541 yards on 93 carries.
"They have a strong running attack and
ball-control type of team," said Elway.
"We're going to have to be a very physical
team against the run."
Cardinal defensive back Walt Harris con
curred. 'We definitely have to stop their run
ning game, option game force them to go
to the passing game."
"They show a lot of formations and try to
do a lot of things. They will try to establish
the run with Hicks out of the C-formation,"
Harris said.
The C-formation resembles the wishbone,
with Garner and Barbero lining up as twin ful
lbacks and Hicks set further back, split be
tween the two.
If Cal quarterback Kevin Brown opts not to
hand off, he'll probably look downfield for
wide receiver Vince Delego, who leads the
team with 29 receptions, averaging 11 yards
per catch.
Garner also poses a receiving threat,
flaring out of the backfield a la Stanford's Brad
Muster, though not as often. His 116 total
catches is an all-time record for a Bear back.
But, the men in blue and gold will face a
rejuvenated Cardinal defense, which in the
last few games has been tougher, crankier
even down-right stubborn.
In the second half of last week's Arizona
State game, the Stanford defense held the
explosive Sun Devils scoreless, playing what
Elway succinctly called "pretty darn good
defense."
'More people have been playing within the
defensive scheme, taking care of their assign

ments without a lot of breakdowns," Harris
said. "One or two breakdowns nullifies the
whole defense."
What really annihilates the Stanford
defense are teams coming off a one-week
bye. Two such teams, Washington and USC,
defeated the Cardinal by an aggregate score
of 64-6. To extrapolate the current pace (or
cardiac-arresting jaunt), the final outcome
should be a 32-3 Cal victory.
Few predict such a score, but many an
ticipate a couple of added wrinkles blossom
ing out of the Cal offense due to the one
week vacation.
"I would expect that they are using their
extra week to put in a few new things. . .
they would be dumb not to," Harris said.
"They'll come out trying to confuse us."
What leaves most people baffled is the of
fense the Cardinal will employ. Shotgun?
Power I?
Elway attempted to elucidate. "I doubt
we'll use it (the shotgun) as much. But then
again, maybe we'll throw the ball on every
play."
'We definitely want to establish the run,"
retorted Stanford fullback Brian Morris, who
admittedly prefered the Power I to the shot
gun since it grants him "a few added
minutes."
Most likely, if past games indictate any
thing, Stanford will throw a few times, per
haps 30, 40 or 90 passes. What concerns
Morris is where these airway offerings will be
thrown.
'We have to give the quarterback time to
throw downfield," Morris said. 'We've had
the fullback catch 10 to 12 passes a game. It's
great for stats, but it doesn't win a lot of
games. We need to use the dump-off as a sec
ondary option."
For Cardinal quarterback John Paye, the
primary targets this season have been full
back Brad Muster and tight end Greg Baty,
who are first and second in Pac-10 receptions
with 72 and 59 catches, respectively.
Muster, who rushed for 61 yards last week

against ASU despite an aggravated hip
pointer, also leads Stanford in rushing with
462 yards.
To counter Muster's offensive versatility
will be Cal's inside linebacker Hardy Nicker
son, the Sports Illustrated defensive player of
the week for his 17-tackle performance
against the Trojans.
Nickerson, who Morris said "plays all over
field," has indeed adhered to that claim and
ball carriers alike. His season total of 155
tackles (85 solo) more than doubles Cal's
second-leading tackier.
While Nickerson may prove to be annoying
on the field, Cal Coach Joe Kapp is annoying
off the field especially to players he
recruits and loses to other schools.
Morris, an all-state performer from Mon
tana, was recruited by Kapp, then beginning
his first season as the Cal coach. When Morris
decided to matriculate at Stanford, Kapp
called him "a typical country boy with shit on
his boots."
Kapp further demonstrated his penchant
for the articulate by labeling Morris "a
mama's boy."
"If he wants to say those kind of things
about college players . . . well . . . that's
basically his mentality," said Morris, reflect
ing on Kapp's past derogatory comments.
In addition to winning Big Game, Morris
added that he would like to show Kapp "what
they lost with him going to Stanford."
Cardinal cornerback Toi Cook also voiced
his Big Game hopes. "It (a close game) would
be good for the spectators, but I don't really
care about them. I want to dominate Cal," he
said.
So who is going to win anyway? When
asked, Morris let his thoughts, emotions and
sense of reality fly skyward, predicting a final
count of 99-0. A few sobering seconds later,
Morris followed Newton's laws and came
back to Mother Earth, calling the game for
the Cardinal at 30-7.
Hopefully next season, it'll be a bowl
prediction.
