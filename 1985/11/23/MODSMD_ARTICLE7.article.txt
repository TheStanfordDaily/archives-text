# Cal-Stanford: Matchups To Watch
## 
### 
They both start their first name
with a 'J' and that's basically where
the similarities end. A flamboyant,
colorful extrovert, Kapp wows
media people with candid, often
outlandish statements. Elway, on
the other hand, articulates in a
more conservative manner, refrain
ing from the excessive superlative.
In the post-game interviews, ex
pect Kapp to provide a healthly
surplus of active verbs and adjec
tives while Elway, taking a few
drags from his cigarette, will do his
best to impersonate Marlon
Brando, uttering only a few words
in clear, concise fashion.

Barbero is runner who runs from
point A to point B. If anything gets
in his way (tacklers, referees or
stray dogs), Barbero will most
likely not change his pre
determined course, which is usually
dead ahead. For this reason, block
ing comes easily to Barbero, who
will most likely confront Prukop on
sweeps to the right side. After
recovering from a back injury that
sidelined him for a few games,
Prukop will need to re-adjust to life
in the blocking alleys.

Neither of these two will be diffi
cult to miss on the playing field, or
otherwise. Both standing tall at 6-
foot-7, it may well be difficult to dis
tinguish the two, though fortunately
Barns weighs a little more. Coming
out of high school, Riesenberg was
highly-touted, choosing Cal over
such perennial powerhouses as
Penn State and Arkansas. After a
rather disappointing sophomore
year, Riesenberg has rallied some
what this season. Barns, the Card
inal's strongest and most consistent
offensive lineman, should provide a
hefty challenge.

The ever evasive Nickerson has
made it a habit out of collecting
those who carry the ball. Thus far
this season, Nickerson has re
corded 155 tackles, already
surpassing the previous Cal tackling
record that he set last. Stanford
brings in its own school record
breaker. Last week against the
Wildcats, Muster hauled in his 72nd
pass of the season to break Gene
Washington's all-time receiving
record at the farm. A big question
will be whether Nickerson can con
tain Muster coming out the back
field to receive a quick pass from
Paye. If he doesn't, Muster will cer
tainly buttress his new school
record.

Considered as Cal's best drive
blocker, Zenker will probable pull
and lead some sweeps. The fact
that he can bench around 500
pounds, not only ranks him as one
of the strongest men in college
football, but it also serves him well
in disposing defensive lineman, who
may boldly venture in his path. One
such crusader will be Leiker, a JC
transfer, who gives away over
30 pounds. In the last few
games, Leiker has emerged as one
of Stanford's most consistent de
fensive performers. His fortitude
and perseverance, not his consis
tency, will be tested today.

Oski

A bear's breath, not unlike a dead
chihuahua, is not a pleasant thing.
No one really enjoys hanging
around bears. They sort of smell
and do a lot of squatting. Oski does
not stray far from the norm, except
he smiles all the time. No one

knows why Mr. Oski walks around
in a state of hysterical happiness.
It's strange. Then again, who's to
say a tree for a mascot isn't a bit
weird. On second thought, who
cares this fir can boogie.
