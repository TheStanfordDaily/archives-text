# Paye Taking His Place Among Card QB Greats
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
It's no secret that Stanford junior
John Paye is a premier college quar
terback.
Stanford Coach Jack Elway, a
man familiar with exceptional quar
terbacks, knows a thing or two
about Paye and why he's better
than the average player at his posi
tion.
"Well, he's bright, talented and
hard-working. He reads defenses
and moves around well in the
pocket. He throws short, inter
mediate, and long, quickly, ac
curately, on the run." On his head,
behind his back and with his eyes
closed.
And as if this weren't enough,
he's probably one of the nicest indi
viduals you'll ever meet.
After giving seven interviews in a
span of two days this week, Paye
continued to field questions
patiently, with a relaxed demeanor
and unwavering congeniality.
"John never refuses an inter
view," said Stanford Sports Infor
mation Director Bob Vazquez.
"He's just a pleasure to work with."
The media blitz that accompanies
Big Game week sometimes runs at
a frenzied pitch. It's potentially un
nerving for the more sought-after
players, but Paye faces this blitz
calmly.

"Quarterback can often be a focal
point for the media. There's pres
sure, but I keep it separate from
my game. Good and bad press
comes, so I can't get too hung up
about it."
You get the feeling that Paye has
the ability to see things clearly,
even amid turmoil. This talent ex
tends to the gridiron, where he
faces blitzes of perhaps a more for
midable nature.
"It's a feeling of confidence when
things are going right. I feel that I
have the ability to sense what's
going on beyond the periphery."
On the football field, a talent such
as this may be a bit subtle for the
average spectator to discern.
However, his raw, physical talent is
obvious.
John Paye is an athlete in the true
sense of the word.
As a freshman, Paye was in the
starting lineup for both football and
basketball, becoming only the
second athlete in NCAA history to
do so at a Division I school.
But Paye doesn't rely solely on
his innate abilities.
"He has great ability," said
teammate and fraternity brother
Greg Baty. "But he also works
harder than anybody else on the
team. Combine great talent with his
kind of work ethic, and you have an
unbeatable combination."
Paye cites his parents as the pri
mary force behind his ardent

dedication. Growing up in neighbor
ing Atherton, his parents supported
all his athletic endeavors, and his
father always found time to play
catch with him.
But it wasn't until the fifth grade
that Paye faced one of the biggest
crossroads in his life.
"I didn't have much focus in my
life. Then I switched to a private
school (Pinewood Elementary)
where more was expected of me. I
had to work harder."
All right. So he was a little late
getting some focus. But since the
fifth grade, he hasn't been anything
else but focused.
It was at some point during his
sophomore year at Menlo School
that Paye decided his ultimate goal
would be to play professional foot
ball.
"It wasn't a single game, but a
result of an entire year in general. I
was able to start that year. College
scouts began to show interest."
After an amazingly prolific high
school career, Paye came to the
Farm. Here he's learned some
valuable lessons, not all of them
easy.
"During my freshman year (a 1-
10 season), there were times, es
pecially after losses, when I
seriously doubted myself, when I
wondered if I was hurting the team.
I had to grow in order to face those
disappointments."

"I had my first experience with
injuries during my sophomore year
as well as this year. I had to learn
how to deal with those injuries and
to keep an optimistic attitude."
After separating the shoulder of
his throwing arm this year against
USC, Paye came off the bench a
week later and led Stanford to a
come-from-behind, upset victory
over the Arizona Wildcats. That's
more than an optimistic attitude.
That's courage.
Paye has learned his lessons
well. But he admits that he has a
ways to go before he's on par with
his model of the complete quarter
back.
"To me, Joe Montana is the ideal.
He always seems very relaxed on
the field, no matter what's going on
around him. He thinks, but most of
the time he just reacts. Quarter

backs can't see what's going on all
the time, but when he reacts, he
seems to do the right thing 90 per
cent of the time. I hope I can reach
the stage where I can see clearly
every game, and to react as well as
he does."
He may be closer than he thinks.
"I would like to play pro ball for
as long as possible, have enough to
support a family. I want a wife to
share life, and kids, so I can give
them the same kind of care and at
tention my parents gave me."
Life at Stanford, away from the
gridiron, may have its share of tur
moil, but Paye has a clear sense of
what he wants and where he's
going.
On the field, John Paye remains
calm, seeing clearly through turmoil
of a different sort.

that Paye decided his ultimate goal
would be to play professional foot
ball.
"It wasn't a single game, but a
result of an entire year in general. I
was able to start that year. College
scouts began to show interest."
After an amazingly prolific high
school career, Paye came to the
Farm. Here he's learned some
valuable lessons, not all of them
easy.
"During my freshman year (a 1-
10 season), there were times, es
pecially after losses, when I
seriously doubted myself, when I
wondered if I was hurting the team.
I had to grow in order to face those
disappointments."

"I had my first experience with
injuries during my sophomore year
as well as this year. I had to learn
how to deal with those injuries and
to keep an optimistic attitude."
After separating the shoulder of
his throwing arm this year against
USC, Paye came off the bench a
week later and led Stanford to a
come-from-behind, upset victory
over the Arizona Wildcats. That's
more than an optimistic attitude.
That's courage.
Paye has learned his lessons
well. But he admits that he has a
ways to go before he's on par with
his model of the complete quarter
back.
"To me, Joe Montana is the ideal.
He always seems very relaxed on
the field, no matter what's going on
around him. He thinks, but most of
the time he just reacts. Quarter

backs can't see what's going on all
the time, but when he reacts, he
seems to do the right thing 90 per
cent of the time. I hope I can reach
the stage where I can see clearly
every game, and to react as well as
he does."
He may be closer than he thinks.
"I would like to play pro ball for
as long as possible, have enough to
support a family. I want a wife to
share life, and kids, so I can give
them the same kind of care and at
tention my parents gave me."
Life at Stanford, away from the
gridiron, may have its share of tur
moil, but Paye has a clear sense of
what he wants and where he's
going.
On the field, John Paye remains
calm, seeing clearly through turmoil
of a different sort.

Stanford quarterback John Paye assumes his customary pose. Once the
ball is released, it has a 67 percent chance of finding a receiver.
It's no secret that Stanford junior
John Paye is a premier college quar
terback.
Stanford Coach Jack Elway, a
man familiar with exceptional quar
terbacks, knows a thing or two
about Paye and why he's better
than the average player at his posi
tion.
"Well, he's bright, talented and
hard-working. He reads defenses
and moves around well in the
pocket. He throws short, inter
mediate, and long, quickly, ac
curately, on the run." On his head,
behind his back and with his eyes
closed.
And as if this weren't enough,
he's probably one of the nicest indi
viduals you'll ever meet.
After giving seven interviews in a
span of two days this week, Paye
continued to field questions
patiently, with a relaxed demeanor
and unwavering congeniality.
"John never refuses an inter
view," said Stanford Sports Infor
mation Director Bob Vazquez.
"He's just a pleasure to work with."
The media blitz that accompanies
Big Game week sometimes runs at
a frenzied pitch. It's potentially un
nerving for the more sought-after
players, but Paye faces this blitz
calmly.

"Quarterback can often be a focal
point for the media. There's pres
sure, but I keep it separate from
my game. Good and bad press
comes, so I can't get too hung up
about it."
You get the feeling that Paye has
the ability to see things clearly,
even amid turmoil. This talent ex
tends to the gridiron, where he
faces blitzes of perhaps a more for
midable nature.
"It's a feeling of confidence when
things are going right. I feel that I
have the ability to sense what's
going on beyond the periphery."
On the football field, a talent such
as this may be a bit subtle for the
average spectator to discern.
However, his raw, physical talent is
obvious.
John Paye is an athlete in the true
sense of the word.
As a freshman, Paye was in the
starting lineup for both football and
basketball, becoming only the
second athlete in NCAA history to
do so at a Division I school.
But Paye doesn't rely solely on
his innate abilities.
"He has great ability," said
teammate and fraternity brother
Greg Baty. "But he also works
harder than anybody else on the
team. Combine great talent with his
kind of work ethic, and you have an
unbeatable combination."
Paye cites his parents as the pri
mary force behind his ardent

dedication. Growing up in neighbor
ing Atherton, his parents supported
all his athletic endeavors, and his
father always found time to play
catch with him.
But it wasn't until the fifth grade
that Paye faced one of the biggest
crossroads in his life.
"I didn't have much focus in my
life. Then I switched to a private
school (Pinewood Elementary)
where more was expected of me. I
had to work harder."
All right. So he was a little late
getting some focus. But since the
fifth grade, he hasn't been anything
else but focused.
It was at some point during his
sophomore year at Menlo School

would be to play professional foot
