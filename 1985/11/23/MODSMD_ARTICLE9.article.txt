# Time To Trade Pocket for Point

Quarterback John Paye will be
playing defense for Stanford next
week, beginning Monday afternoon
at practice.
Basketball practice, that is.
Though Football Coach Jack El
way may not like his star quarter
back's decision, Paye plans to join
the varsity basketball squad, for the
third year, as soon as he hangs up
his cleats.
Paye earned a starting spot on

Stanford's basketball team during
his freshman season and has
started most games since. His sta
tistics belie his importance, particu
larly last year, when he averaged
only 5.6 points and 2 assists per
game but was effective in penetrat
ing defenses and bringing the ball
up the court.
"Basketball's my favorite sport,"
said Paye, discussing the thrill of a
fast-break. "There's more
creativity involved with it."
Paye notes that playing basket
ball complements his football abili
ties. .
"For a quarterback, basketball

does a lot for scrambling ability.
Having to play against quick basket
ball players helps overall quickness
and movement."
He adds that playing against
quick guards also teaches him to
"think quicker" during pressure sit
uations.
Elway, asked whether he wants
Paye to play basketball this year,
said, "I have no opinion on that
issue."
But rumors abound that Elway
wants Paye to rest his shoulder
injured Oct. 19 against USC until
spring football.

On Monday, Stanford quarterback John Paye will become Stanford
point guard John Paye. For the third straight year, Paye will be
trading his shovel passes for bounce passes. In 1983, Paye became
only the second NCAA Division I player to start in both football and
basketball as a freshman.
