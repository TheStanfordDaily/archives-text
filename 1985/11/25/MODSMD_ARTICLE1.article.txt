# Stanford Gave 'em the Axe
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
It took two third-and-long conversions in the final
minutes and a little help from a placekicker named
Leland, but the Stanford football team managed to hold
off a furious second-half UC-Berkeley rally here Satur
day for a 24-22 victory in the 88th Big Game.
The win moved the Cardinal into a tie for seventh
place in the Pacific 10 Conference with a final league
record of 3-5 (4-7 overall). The Golden Bears slipped
to 2-7 (4-7 overall), confirming their reservations in the
conference cellar.

A near-sellout crowd of 84,876 turned out on this
gray, chilly afternoon to watch an apparent Stanford
stampede turn into a barnburner of a Big Game. Trail
ing 24-0 midway through the third quarter, the Bears
exploded for 22 points in a space of five minutes and 24
seconds, and with 8:32 left before the final gun, they
lined up for a 30-yard field goal that would have given
them the lead.
But Leland Rix, a sophomore from Cal who had
missed his last three field goal attempts this season,
pushed the ball wide right. And after an exchange of
punts, Stanford drove the final four minutes off the
clock to keep the Axe on the Farm for a second
straight year.
That final drive hinged on two big plays — a 34-yard
strike from quarterback John Paye to wide receiver Jeff
James on third and 22 from the Stanford 8, and an 11-

yard Brad Muster ramble around left end on third and
eight from the Cardinal 44.
"(After Muster's run), I knew all we had to do was
keep the players off the field and keep the damn Band
off the field and we'd be all right," said Stanford Coach
Jack Elway. "I'm one grateful football coach for this
win."
"This is going to stick out in my mind," said Paye,
who finished the day with 13-of-22 passing for 161
yards and two touchdowns. "I'd say it's even better
than last year's win."
The Cardinal took advantage of four Cal turnovers in
the first half to grab a seemingly safe 21-0 lead at the
intermission. Three times, Stanford started drives
inside the Berkeley 35, and two of them ended in
touchdowns.
"Our team was too charitable," said Cal Coach Joe
Kapp. "We gave away too much."
Actually, Stanford's defense didn't let the Bears get
untracked. The Cardinal's front seven stuffed the
vaunted Cal running game in the first half, holding it to
57 yards, and allowed Kevin Brown only four comple
tions for 31 yards. In seven possessions, the Bears
crossed midfield only once.
And on offense, the Cardinal ran the ball down
Berkeley's throat. Muster gained 62 of his 83 yards in
the first two quarters, on sweeps, line-bangers out of
the power-I and even intercepted shotgun snaps.
Stanford marched 58 yards on its first possession,
finishing off the drive with a 14-yard pass from Paye to
wide-open tight end Greg Baty in the middle of the end

zone. That confident, well-balanced drive set
the tone for the whole first half.
Cal turned the ball over on each of its next
four series and the Cardinal capitalized twice.
Linebacker Matt Soderlund recovered a
fumble by the Bears' heralded Marc Hicks —
who finished the day with 23 yards on 13
carries — and Paye completed an easy 21-
yard march with a touchdown plunge from the
one.
In the second quarter, Stanford drove 30
yards for a touchdown after noseguard Ray
Huckestein fell on an Ed Barbero fumble.
Paye rolled to his right and found Muster on
his knees in the corner of the end zone for the
score.
But the Stanford domination ended early in
the second half, after a David Sweeney field
goal made the score 24-0 at the 12:46 mark of
the third quarter. Backup Cal quarterback
Brian Bedford brought the Berkeley fans to
life with a 49-yard touchdown drive that he
capped (Kapped?) with a four-yard keeper on
fourth and goal.
The blue and gold contingent in the north
end of the stadium began rocking the bleac
hers with their "Go Bears!" rally cheer, and
the game's momentum took a sudden swing.
"We weren't doing anything different in the
second half," said senior offensive tackle John
Barns. "But in a game like this, where the fan
involvement is so important, a momentum
shift like that has a drastic effect."
Stanford went nowhere and punted the ball
away. Brown came in for Bedford, who had
injured his foot while celebrating his touch
down run, and he immediately hit flanker
Vince Delgado with a 39-yard bomb to the
Stanford 3. Tailback Dwight Garner ran it
over on the next play and the score was 24-
14.
And the Berkeley backers cranked their
decibel level so high that you had to wonder
what side of the Bay you were on.
"I don't think we should give them that
many tickets," Paye said. "We got stuck
down in that corner of the stadium where
Cal's fans were, and we couldn't use the shot
gun because it was hard to hear the signals. I
wanted to turn to the ref and say 'I can't
hear,' but you shouldn't have to do that at a
home game."
On a third and 12 from the Stanford 18,
Paye scrambled into the end zone, and under
pressure from Cal linebacker Miles Turpin,
he tossed the ball in the direction of center
Kurt Josephson. The officials called inten

tional grounding in the end zone, an automatic
safety.
"I made a bad play when I started scram
bling backwards," Paye said. "I was hoping
they wouldn't notice it was my center."
Punter Doug Robison kicked it away to
Garner, who returned the ball 20 yards to the
Stanford 45. And on the very next play, Del
gado took a reverse around left end all the
way to the end zone.
That set up a two-point conversion attempt
that could have tied the game at 24. But Stan
ford blanketed the end zone with defenders,
and tackle Sean Scheller chased down Brown
on the right sideline.
It didn't look like the failed conversion
would matter when Cal moved deep into
Stanford territory on its next possession,
early in the fourth quarter. A shanked
Robison punt put the Bears on their own 48,
and Brown drove his team through an in
spired Cardinal defense to a third and one on
the Stanford 12.
There, Garner hit a rock wall on a plunge
up the middle, and Rix came on for his un
successful attempt. Two punts later — one a
51-yard boomer by Robison that kept the
Bears out of good field position — Stanford
embarked on the clock-killing drive that se
cured the victory.
"A win's a win," Barns said. "It would have
been nice if we had kept up the domination,
but it really doesn't matter what the score
is."
"I know some people were talking about it
not being Big Game, but if it's not Big Game,
I'm a little football coach," Elway said. "I'm
damn thrilled to be a part of it."
And with two straight Big Game victories
under their belts, the Stanford fans have got
to be feeling pretty damn thrilled, too.
Card notes
Saturday's game marked the conclusion of
seven Stanford football careers — those of
linebacker Mark Andrew, offensive tackle
John Barns, tight end Greg Baty, quarter
back Fred Buckley, fullback Stan Gill and
linebackers Jack Gilmete and Matt Soder
lund. But it might also have been the last
game for some of the 17 fourth-year seniors
who have a year of eligibility remaining. Many
of those seniors did not see action this year,
and it appears that a number of them will be
asked to give up their scholarships in order to
make room for recruits. For all those seniors
who will end their careers without the ap
plause and recognition that the above seven
did during the bonfire rally and during the
game on Saturday — thank you.

over on the next play and the score was 24-
14.
And the Berkeley backers cranked their
decibel level so high that you had to wonder
what side of the Bay you were on.
"I don't think we should give them that
many tickets," Paye said. "We got stuck
down in that corner of the stadium where
Cal's fans were, and we couldn't use the shot
gun because it was hard to hear the signals. I
wanted to turn to the ref and say 'I can't
hear,' but you shouldn't have to do that at a
home game."
On a third and 12 from the Stanford 18,
Paye scrambled into the end zone, and under
pressure from Cal linebacker Miles Turpin,
he tossed the ball in the direction of center
Kurt Josephson. The officials called inten

tional grounding in the end zone, an automatic
safety.
"I made a bad play when I started scram
bling backwards," Paye said. "I was hoping
they wouldn't notice it was my center."
Punter Doug Robison kicked it away to
Garner, who returned the ball 20 yards to the
Stanford 45. And on the very next play, Del
gado took a reverse around left end all the
way to the end zone.
That set up a two-point conversion attempt
that could have tied the game at 24. But Stan
ford blanketed the end zone with defenders,
and tackle Sean Scheller chased down Brown
on the right sideline.
It didn't look like the failed conversion
would matter when Cal moved deep into
Stanford territory on its next possession,
early in the fourth quarter. A shanked
Robison punt put the Bears on their own 48,
and Brown drove his team through an in
spired Cardinal defense to a third and one on
the Stanford 12.
There, Garner hit a rock wall on a plunge
up the middle, and Rix came on for his un
successful attempt. Two punts later — one a
51-yard boomer by Robison that kept the
Bears out of good field position — Stanford
embarked on the clock-killing drive that se
cured the victory.
"A win's a win," Barns said. "It would have
been nice if we had kept up the domination,
but it really doesn't matter what the score
is."
"I know some people were talking about it
not being Big Game, but if it's not Big Game,
I'm a little football coach," Elway said. "I'm
damn thrilled to be a part of it."
And with two straight Big Game victories
under their belts, the Stanford fans have got
to be feeling pretty damn thrilled, too.
Card notes
Saturday's game marked the conclusion of
seven Stanford football careers — those of
linebacker Mark Andrew, offensive tackle
John Barns, tight end Greg Baty, quarter
back Fred Buckley, fullback Stan Gill and
linebackers Jack Gilmete and Matt Soder
lund. But it might also have been the last
game for some of the 17 fourth-year seniors
who have a year of eligibility remaining. Many
of those seniors did not see action this year,
and it appears that a number of them will be
asked to give up their scholarships in order to
make room for recruits. For all those seniors
who will end their careers without the ap
plause and recognition that the above seven
did during the bonfire rally and during the
game on Saturday — thank you.


Sam Sutherland (No. 5) and Tony Leiker made life difficult for
the Bears' Marc Hicks, who came into the game highly touted.

Hicks managed only 23 yards on 13 carries and 10 more on
three catches in the Big Game.


Walt Harris's over-the-shoulder catch of a Kevin Brown
throw in the first quarter accounted for one of two Cali-

fornia interceptions Saturday. The Bears also lost
three fumbles.
It took two third-and-long conversions in the final
minutes and a little help from a placekicker named
Leland, but the Stanford football team managed to hold
off a furious second-half UC-Berkeley rally here Satur
day for a 24-22 victory in the 88th Big Game.
The win moved the Cardinal into a tie for seventh
place in the Pacific 10 Conference with a final league
record of 3-5 (4-7 overall). The Golden Bears slipped
to 2-7 (4-7 overall), confirming their reservations in the
conference cellar.

A near-sellout crowd of 84,876 turned out on this
gray, chilly afternoon to watch an apparent Stanford
stampede turn into a barnburner of a Big Game. Trail
ing 24-0 midway through the third quarter, the Bears
exploded for 22 points in a space of five minutes and 24
seconds, and with 8:32 left before the final gun, they
lined up for a 30-yard field goal that would have given
them the lead.
But Leland Rix, a sophomore from Cal who had
missed his last three field goal attempts this season,
pushed the ball wide right. And after an exchange of
punts, Stanford drove the final four minutes off the
clock to keep the Axe on the Farm for a second
straight year.
That final drive hinged on two big plays — a 34-yard
strike from quarterback John Paye to wide receiver Jeff
James on third and 22 from the Stanford 8, and an 11-

yard Brad Muster ramble around left end on third and
eight from the Cardinal 44.
"(After Muster's run), I knew all we had to do was
keep the players off the field and keep the damn Band
off the field and we'd be all right," said Stanford Coach
Jack Elway. "I'm one grateful football coach for this
win."
"This is going to stick out in my mind," said Paye,
who finished the day with 13-of-22 passing for 161
yards and two touchdowns. "I'd say it's even better
than last year's win."
The Cardinal took advantage of four Cal turnovers in
the first half to grab a seemingly safe 21-0 lead at the
intermission. Three times, Stanford started drives
inside the Berkeley 35, and two of them ended in
touchdowns.
"Our team was too charitable," said Cal Coach Joe
Kapp. "We gave away too much."
Actually, Stanford's defense didn't let the Bears get
untracked. The Cardinal's front seven stuffed the
vaunted Cal running game in the first half, holding it to
57 yards, and allowed Kevin Brown only four comple
tions for 31 yards. In seven possessions, the Bears
crossed midfield only once.
And on offense, the Cardinal ran the ball down
Berkeley's throat. Muster gained 62 of his 83 yards in
the first two quarters, on sweeps, line-bangers out of
the power-I and even intercepted shotgun snaps.
Stanford marched 58 yards on its first possession,
finishing off the drive with a 14-yard pass from Paye to
wide-open tight end Greg Baty in the middle of the end

zone. That confident, well-balanced drive set
the tone for the whole first half.
Cal turned the ball over on each of its next
four series and the Cardinal capitalized twice.
Linebacker Matt Soderlund recovered a
fumble by the Bears' heralded Marc Hicks —
who finished the day with 23 yards on 13
carries — and Paye completed an easy 21-
yard march with a touchdown plunge from the
one.
In the second quarter, Stanford drove 30
yards for a touchdown after noseguard Ray
Huckestein fell on an Ed Barbero fumble.
Paye rolled to his right and found Muster on
his knees in the corner of the end zone for the
score.
But the Stanford domination ended early in
the second half, after a David Sweeney field
goal made the score 24-0 at the 12:46 mark of
the third quarter. Backup Cal quarterback
Brian Bedford brought the Berkeley fans to
life with a 49-yard touchdown drive that he
capped (Kapped?) with a four-yard keeper on
fourth and goal.
The blue and gold contingent in the north
end of the stadium began rocking the bleac
hers with their "Go Bears!" rally cheer, and
the game's momentum took a sudden swing.
"We weren't doing anything different in the
second half," said senior offensive tackle John
Barns. "But in a game like this, where the fan
involvement is so important, a momentum
shift like that has a drastic effect."
Stanford went nowhere and punted the ball
away. Brown came in for Bedford, who had
injured his foot while celebrating his touch
down run, and he immediately hit flanker
Vince Delgado with a 39-yard bomb to the
Stanford 3. Tailback Dwight Garner ran it
over on the next play and the score was 24-
14.
And the Berkeley backers cranked their
decibel level so high that you had to wonder
what side of the Bay you were on.
"I don't think we should give them that

pushed the ball wide right. And after an exchange of
punts, Stanford drove the final four minutes off the
clock to keep the Axe on the Farm for a second
straight year.
That final drive hinged on two big plays — a 34-yard
strike from quarterback John Paye to wide receiver Jeff
James on third and 22 from the Stanford 8, and an 11-

yard Brad Muster ramble around left end on third and
eight from the Cardinal 44.
"(After Muster's run), I knew all we had to do was
keep the players off the field and keep the damn Band
off the field and we'd be all right," said Stanford Coach
Jack Elway. "I'm one grateful football coach for this
win."
"This is going to stick out in my mind," said Paye,
who finished the day with 13-of-22 passing for 161
yards and two touchdowns. "I'd say it's even better
than last year's win."
The Cardinal took advantage of four Cal turnovers in
the first half to grab a seemingly safe 21-0 lead at the
intermission. Three times, Stanford started drives
inside the Berkeley 35, and two of them ended in
touchdowns.
"Our team was too charitable," said Cal Coach Joe
Kapp. "We gave away too much."
Actually, Stanford's defense didn't let the Bears get
untracked. The Cardinal's front seven stuffed the
vaunted Cal running game in the first half, holding it to
57 yards, and allowed Kevin Brown only four comple
tions for 31 yards. In seven possessions, the Bears
crossed midfield only once.
And on offense, the Cardinal ran the ball down
Berkeley's throat. Muster gained 62 of his 83 yards in
the first two quarters, on sweeps, line-bangers out of
the power-I and even intercepted shotgun snaps.
Stanford marched 58 yards on its first possession,
finishing off the drive with a 14-yard pass from Paye to
wide-open tight end Greg Baty in the middle of the end

Stanford players (from left to right) Fred Buckley, Brian Morris and Greg Baty, seniors all, rejoice
after Saturday's Cardinal triumph in the 88th Big Game.
zone. That confident, well-balanced drive set
the tone for the whole first half.
Cal turned the ball over on each of its next
four series and the Cardinal capitalized twice.
Linebacker Matt Soderlund recovered a
fumble by the Bears' heralded Marc Hicks —
who finished the day with 23 yards on 13
carries — and Paye completed an easy 21-
yard march with a touchdown plunge from the
one.
In the second quarter, Stanford drove 30
yards for a touchdown after noseguard Ray
Huckestein fell on an Ed Barbero fumble.
Paye rolled to his right and found Muster on
his knees in the corner of the end zone for the
score.
But the Stanford domination ended early in
the second half, after a David Sweeney field
goal made the score 24-0 at the 12:46 mark of
the third quarter. Backup Cal quarterback
Brian Bedford brought the Berkeley fans to
life with a 49-yard touchdown drive that he
capped (Kapped?) with a four-yard keeper on
fourth and goal.
The blue and gold contingent in the north
end of the stadium began rocking the bleac
hers with their "Go Bears!" rally cheer, and
the game's momentum took a sudden swing.
"We weren't doing anything different in the
second half," said senior offensive tackle John
Barns. "But in a game like this, where the fan
involvement is so important, a momentum
shift like that has a drastic effect."
Stanford went nowhere and punted the ball
away. Brown came in for Bedford, who had
injured his foot while celebrating his touch
down run, and he immediately hit flanker
Vince Delgado with a 39-yard bomb to the
Stanford 3. Tailback Dwight Garner ran it
over on the next play and the score was 24-
14.
And the Berkeley backers cranked their
decibel level so high that you had to wonder
what side of the Bay you were on.
"I don't think we should give them that
many tickets," Paye said. "We got stuck
down in that corner of the stadium where
Cal's fans were, and we couldn't use the shot
gun because it was hard to hear the signals. I
wanted to turn to the ref and say 'I can't
hear,' but you shouldn't have to do that at a
home game."
On a third and 12 from the Stanford 18,
Paye scrambled into the end zone, and under
pressure from Cal linebacker Miles Turpin,
he tossed the ball in the direction of center
Kurt Josephson. The officials called inten

tional grounding in the end zone, an automatic
safety.
"I made a bad play when I started scram
bling backwards," Paye said. "I was hoping
they wouldn't notice it was my center."
Punter Doug Robison kicked it away to
Garner, who returned the ball 20 yards to the
Stanford 45. And on the very next play, Del
gado took a reverse around left end all the
way to the end zone.
That set up a two-point conversion attempt
that could have tied the game at 24. But Stan
ford blanketed the end zone with defenders,
and tackle Sean Scheller chased down Brown
on the right sideline.
It didn't look like the failed conversion
would matter when Cal moved deep into
Stanford territory on its next possession,
early in the fourth quarter. A shanked
Robison punt put the Bears on their own 48,
and Brown drove his team through an in
spired Cardinal defense to a third and one on
the Stanford 12.
There, Garner hit a rock wall on a plunge
up the middle, and Rix came on for his un
successful attempt. Two punts later — one a
51-yard boomer by Robison that kept the
Bears out of good field position — Stanford
embarked on the clock-killing drive that se
cured the victory.
"A win's a win," Barns said. "It would have
been nice if we had kept up the domination,
but it really doesn't matter what the score
is."
"I know some people were talking about it
not being Big Game, but if it's not Big Game,
I'm a little football coach," Elway said. "I'm
damn thrilled to be a part of it."
And with two straight Big Game victories
under their belts, the Stanford fans have got
to be feeling pretty damn thrilled, too.
Card notes
Saturday's game marked the conclusion of
seven Stanford football careers — those of
linebacker Mark Andrew, offensive tackle
John Barns, tight end Greg Baty, quarter
back Fred Buckley, fullback Stan Gill and
linebackers Jack Gilmete and Matt Soder
lund. But it might also have been the last
game for some of the 17 fourth-year seniors
who have a year of eligibility remaining. Many
of those seniors did not see action this year,
and it appears that a number of them will be
asked to give up their scholarships in order to
make room for recruits. For all those seniors
who will end their careers without the ap
plause and recognition that the above seven
did during the bonfire rally and during the
game on Saturday — thank you.


Sam Sutherland (No. 5) and Tony Leiker made life difficult for
the Bears' Marc Hicks, who came into the game highly touted.
