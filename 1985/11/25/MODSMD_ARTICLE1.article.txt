# Stanford Gave 'em the Axe

### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
It took two third-and-long conversions in the final
minutes and a little help from a placekicker named
Leland, but the Stanford football team managed to hold
off a furious second-half UC-Berkeley rally here Satur
day for a 24-22 victory in the 88th Big Game.
The win moved the Cardinal into a tie for seventh
place in the Pacific 10 Conference with a final league
record of 3-5 (4-7 overall). The Golden Bears slipped
to 2-7 (4-7 overall), confirming their reservations in the
conference cellar.

A near-sellout crowd of 84,876 turned out on this
gray, chilly afternoon to watch an apparent Stanford
stampede turn into a barnburner of a Big Game. Trail
ing 24-0 midway through the third quarter, the Bears
exploded for 22 points in a space of five minutes and 24
seconds, and with 8:32 left before the final gun, they
lined up for a 30-yard field goal that would have given
them the lead.
But Leland Rix, a sophomore from Cal who had
missed his last three field goal attempts this season,
pushed the ball wide right. And after an exchange of
punts, Stanford drove the final four minutes off the
clock to keep the Axe on the Farm for a second
straight year.
That final drive hinged on two big plays â€” a 34-yard
strike from quarterback John Paye to wide receiver Jeff
James on third and 22 from the Stanford 8, and an 11-

yard Brad Muster ramble around left end on third and
eight from the Cardinal 44.
"(After Muster's run), I knew all we had to do was
keep the players off the field and keep the damn Band
off the field and we'd be all right," said Stanford Coach
Jack Elway. "I'm one grateful football coach for this
win."
"This is going to stick out in my mind," said Paye,
who finished the day with 13-of-22 passing for 161
yards and two touchdowns. "I'd say it's even better
than last year's win."
The Cardinal took advantage of four Cal turnovers in
the first half to grab a seemingly safe 21-0 lead at the
intermission. Three times, Stanford started drives
inside the Berkeley 35, and two of them ended in
touchdowns.
"Our team was too charitable," said Cal Coach Joe
Kapp. "We gave away too much."
Actually, Stanford's defense didn't let the Bears get
untracked. The Cardinal's front seven stuffed the
vaunted Cal running game in the first half, holding it to
57 yards, and allowed Kevin Brown only four comple
tions for 31 yards. In seven possessions, the Bears
crossed midfield only once.
And on offense, the Cardinal ran the ball down
Berkeley's throat. Muster gained 62 of his 83 yards in
the first two quarters, on sweeps, line-bangers out of
the power-I and even intercepted shotgun snaps.
Stanford marched 58 yards on its first possession,
finishing off the drive with a 14-yard pass from Paye to
wide-open tight end Greg Baty in the middle of the end
