## THE STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Invite Soviet Leader
### 
"We consider Gorbachev uniquely qualified to of
fer the Eastern Bloc's perspective on international
relations, world peace and in particular, its hopes for
the future leaders of the Western world. We can
think of no issues more appropriate for a speech
marking the commencement of our lives in the real
world."
This statement, issued last week by the authors
of a petition inviting Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev to speak at University commencement exer
cises next June, commands our support. At no time
has the need for mutual understanding between the
superpowers been more important, and a visit by
Gorbachev to campus would be a unique and posi
tive step toward fostering this understanding.
At the outset of the petition drive, more than a
few faculty members said the chances of Gorbachev
coming to commencement were virtually non
existent. But a few weeks and a Geneva summit
later, the four seniors who launched the project
have garnered more than 500 signatures, discussed
security and protocol with the State Department
and entered into consultations with Soviet officials.

Combine that with the recent agreement that
Gorbachev will visit the United States next year and
the prospects for the petition's success may not be
beyond our grasp.
Hosting Gorbachev would be a real coup for Stan
ford, demonstrating the seriousness with which this
institution takes its role in influencing U.S. and in
ternational policy and training policy makers from
around the world. More importantly, in the words of
the petition's authors, "A gesture of this kind will
display this University's commitment to the peaceful
co-existence of the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. on all
frontiers."
The final decision of the commencement speaker
rests with University President Donald Kennedy.
We urge him to back the petition and take all possi
ble steps to bring Gorbachev here next year. There
are likely to be challenges â€” negotiations with both
Moscow and Washington, and complex security ar
rangements on campus. But an opportunity for
Stanford to work for peace between the super
powers will always be worth the effort.
