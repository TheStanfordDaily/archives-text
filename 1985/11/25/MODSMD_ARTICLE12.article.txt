## Resident Assistants Are People Too 
### 
As fall quarter comes to an end,
with midterms past and finals ap
proaching, with Big Game over and
skiing on the way, a certain group
of Stanford students finds them
selves dealing with a stunning
realization that they have been
avoiding for a great deal of the quar
ter — that despite responsibilities
and expectations, they too are stu
dents with academics, and they too
are busy Christmas shoppers, and,
for many of them, they too are

VIEWPOINT

seniors feeling emotions that only
seniors can feel — emotions of
"losing grasp of all that took three
years to get a hold of," as one
senior has said.
More than 180 Stanford under
graduates are RAs. I tend to think
of RAs as people who have a million
other things to do as well, but who
feel "compelled" to be RAs. The
motivation comes from inside
somewhere, and at no time is this
more apparent than it is now. As
the end of each quarter approaches,
many activities that have been
"brewing" for weeks spring to life.
Suddenly an involved RA finds
him/herself juggling things more
than ever before. Think about it —
was your RA in Gaieties, or on staff
at The Daily, or in the Band, or
working with the Stanford Volun
teer Network, or TAing a class or
involved in one of any number of
things that seems to get hectic
toward the end of the quarter?
As RAs everywhere get pulled
away from their residences, the in
evitable comments surface: "Where
have you been?" Or, "Shouldn't you
be spending more time in the

dorm?" Or, "Gee, you sure seem
to have chosen your priorities."
These are the times when the RA
can only hope to smile and try to re
member the old cliche, "You've got
to take the bad with the good." Un
fortunately (and this comes with
any leadership position), the good is
often painfully quiet, especially
compared to the sometimes brutal
comments.
I don't speak for all RAs of
course, but I can speak for a few of
us (based on late night frantic phone
calls), which leads me to believe
that there are many others dealing
with and feeling the same things. So
I decided to be a bit bold and ob
noxious and write this viewpoint
about it.
What does this mean for you?
Well, as you begin to get frazzled
for finals, make plans for winter
break, go Christmas shopping and

all that December stuff, try to re
member that your old reliable RA
has all that to do too, and perhaps a
great deal more (they'd probably
never admit it, as most RAs have to
be a bit masochistic to take all this
on). Also remember all this when
you're stressing over midterms and
papers and job interviews. If you
are like any of the people I'm living
with, you've been an absolute plea
sure to work with, so this wouldn't
be a problem.
Keep pushing your RA around a
bit — it keeps 'em on their toes,
but be a sensitive resident —
sensitive to your RA as a busy
friend and a busy and involved Stan
ford student. The results could be
fantastic for all concerned, believe
me.
