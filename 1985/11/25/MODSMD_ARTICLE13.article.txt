'Liberal' Means
Free Expression
I've heard it said that one can
learn quite a bit about a society by
examining its garbage. Well, sure
enough, the garbage that Alice
Stauffer spewed forth in her
column of Nov. 21 ("Star Wars
Plan Lacks Support") reveals quite
a bit to the careful reader
(hopefully you, Stanford students).
Ms. Stauffer didn't really say
anything substantial that day, but
she did use all the right
"buzzwords:" basic education,
health care, nuclear freeze, arms
race, nuclear proliferation, self
determination, Star Wars,
Nicaragua, Philippines, Poland,
Afghanistan, El Salvador, South
Africa . . . (you get the idea). Ms.
Stauffer knows that she doesn't
have to make a valid argument for
her point of view, she just has to
use enough buzzwords in the right
places to give her column that
leftward tilt that gives her, and a
whole lot of other quasi-informed
people at Stanford, that warm
feeling of self-satisfaction.
I don't know why, but I'd expect
a Stanford senior to know the
difference between a valid argu
ment and the kind of cold intellec
tual leftovers that give everybody

knee-jerk reactions. This ain't no
disco, Alice, so get with it. It may
be chic to express your simplistic
point of view, but the more astute
of the political left are having a
tough time as it is, and don't need
any more senseless babbling on
their behalf.
Oh, and one last thing, Alice:
Please don't confuse the term
"liberal" as it applies to the political
left with that Holy Grail "liberal
campus." Having a forum that
allows expression of all political
viewpoints (yes, even that of the
Hoover Institution) is exactly what
"liberal" is supposed to mean.

SOSA Statement
Confuses Issue
In Thursday's Daily, a letter
signed by Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA) asserts that "the
University announced that it is
establishing closer ties with the
white University of Cape Town,"
and goes on to call on the adminis
tration to "break Stanford's ties
with all institutions of the racist
apartheid system."
Their letter contains two misun

derstandings. First, Stanford has
not announced that it is establish
ing closer ties with South African
universities. Last week, I did
publish an extended account of
various University efforts to play a
more active role in the anti
apartheid movement, and, among
other things, I mentioned that a
consortium of universities and
foundations had met with
representitives of South African
universities, including the Univer
sity of Cape Town, to discuss
ways in which we might aid in the
education of black South Africans.
Dialogue with knowledgeable
and helpful individuals is, it seems
to me, an essential part of such
efforts — but it certainly does not
require "establishing closer ties"
with particular institutions. That
brings me to the second misun
derstanding. The letter describes
the University of Cape Town as
"white." That error probably
arises because the South African
government "officially" considers
the University of Cape Town that
way. Actually, that university has
now raised the enrollment of
blacks to 18 percent and is working
hard to increase it further. This
has been accomplished, despite
government policies, by the vice
chancellor of the University of

Cape Town, Stewart Saunders,
who has courageously announced
publicly that his goal is to make
that an integrated institution. He
and his institution deserve praise
from SOSA, not condemnation.
