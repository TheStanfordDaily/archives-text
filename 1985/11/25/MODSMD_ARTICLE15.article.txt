# Helpful Hints for Frosh
## 
### 
Well, here it is almost Thanksgiving. Time sure does
move fast. While pondering this idea the other day I
started reminiscing about last year when I was in the
midst of that crazy time known as freshman year. Be
tween arriving at Stanford and Thankgiving of my
freshman year, as I think happens with everyone, my
way of thinking was changed drastically. Following the
example and help of upperclassmen made this period,
and my transition from a normal person into a Stanford
student, easier. So now, as an upperclassman, I'm
going to do my part in helping the current freshmen
along. I thereby submit my list of things that freshmen
should know by now.

Frosh should know that your froshbook is more
useful than the Constitution, Dear Abby and the Bible
combined. Finding out the name of that person of the
opposite sex you just met in Western Culture is infi
nitely more important than any law, bit of advice or an
cient wisdom imaginable.
Frosh should know that the construction that you
see on campus is not near completion, nor will it ever
be.
Frosh should know that Wells Fargo does not em
body the spirit of the Old West.
Non-California frosh should know that just because
you are in California, doesn't mean your life will
resemble a commercial for Sunkist orange soda.
Frosh should know that your roommate(s) like/hate
you just as much as you like/hate him/her/them.
Frosh should know that you should not go to the
Post Office at 12:30 to pick up a package and intend to
make your 1:15 class.
Frosh should know that the lines painted on White
Plaza to control bike traffic are to be disregarded. In
the dictionary, under the word "useless," are pictures
of the lines on White Plaza and even though Don sez,
"Walk your bike," you don't have to.
Frosh should know by now that the Coffee House is
not a student-run organization. Likewise, they should
know that Stanford invests in corporations that do busi
ness in South Africa.

Frosh should know that most Domino's delivery
people do not speak English.
Frosh should know that you should never go to
Crothers, nor should you go to the equally ominous
Cro-Mem. Many people don't even know that there is a
distinction between the two, but don't go in either. You
can and should, however, go to Green Library, where
one can do some serious studying or cut some serious
"Zs" in the blissful sleep-inducing chairs found there.
Frosh should know the back row of the Store, to the
right of the cash registers as you come in, on the top
shelf, is wear you can buy supplies.
Frosh should know that deadlines aren't really
deadlines, unless they're a final.
Frosh should know that contrary to Res-Ed policy,
any RA will give you alcohol.
Frosh should know that in the spring, they will not
be taking brisk morning swims in the cool, clear and
clean water of Lake Lag. Here I'm assuming that fresh
men already know that they can't take brisk morning
swims in the cool, clear and clean water of Lake Lag
now. I just hope that they're not harboring any false
hopes for spring.
Frosh should know that yes, you can wear your un
derwear for one more day.
Frosh should know that screaming does not finish
your calculus homework, but it is marginally effective
at reducing stress.
Frosh should know that you will be in a bike wreck,
even if you do not own a bike.
Frosh should know that Bloom County is most often
the funniest comic strip in The Daily.
Frosh should know that if you are looking forward to
Christmas break and going home, you will want to
come back even worse approximately 48 hours after
you get home.
Frosh should know that everyone buys the Chapar
ral and the entire campus is eagerly waiting for the
next issue, which will go on sale Dec. 9. Frosh
should also know that the large floating sheep at the
Big Game was the product of the twisted minds of the
people who work at the Chaparral.
Well, that's my list. I realize that this list is incom
plete. Who can list everything a frosh should know? I
don't know. So if you're an upperclassman and you
know something a freshman should know that I didn't
list, tell one â€” or two, for that matter. And if you're a
frosh, realize that you are still in for surprises.
