After meeting with an assis
tant tn Unlvfirtlfv Present
Donald Kennedy and doing some
preliminary research, a group of
seniors hoping to invite Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev to be
the 1986 commencement
speaker said they feel encour
aged.
Mark Fleischauer, Dave Icke,
Erin Olson and Charlie Cosovich
spoke to Marlene Wine, a special
assistant to Kennedy, Friday
after doing research into the
feasibility of inviting Gorbachev
to Stanford.
"We presented our case and
she was very receptive," Icke
said. Wine was unavailable for
comment last night.
As part of the research, the
group contacted the State De
partment and the Soviet Em
bassy in Washington about the
protocol involved in inviting Gor
bachev, and spoke to campus
police regarding the security that
would be required if Gorbachev
came.
According to Fleischauer, a
spokesperson from the embassy
said he thought Gorbachev
would consider a formal invita

tion, but suggested that the date
be left open in case Gorbachev
was unavailable for the com
mencement.
According to Fleischauer and
Icke, Stanford police said secur
ity would be handled by outside
agencies. Police also said they
thought the threat to Gorbachev
would be less than the threat to


Mikhail Gorbachev
Commencement speaker?
President Reagan, who is also
being considered to speak at com
mencement, Fleischauer added.
So far, 500 signatures have been
collected on a petition being circ
ulated among the senior class advo
cating the invitation of Gorbachev,
Icke said.
Fleischauer said he believes that
two students who are on the five
member Commencement Panel
also support the selection of Gorba
chev. The panel will make the final
recommendation of a speaker to
Kennedy, who must make a final
decision by Dec. 1.
In addition, the four have sent a
letter to Warren Christopher, the
president of Stanford's Board of
Trustees, to "inform him of (their)
efforts." The letter calls Gorbachev
"uniquely qualified to offer the Eas
tern Bloc's hopes for the future
leaders of the Western world," an
issue "appropriate for a speech
marking the commencement of our
lives in the real world."
Fleischauer said that after a Nov.
11 story on the petition in The
Daily, the story has been picked up
by both major wire services,
several major West Coast papers
and CBS and NBC News.
