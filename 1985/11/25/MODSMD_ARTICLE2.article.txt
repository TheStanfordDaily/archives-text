Mark Fleischauer, Dave Icke,

spoke to Marlene Wine, a special
assistant to Kennedy, Friday
after doing research into the
feasibility of inviting Gorbachev
to Stanford.
"We presented our case and
she was very receptive," Icke
said. Wine was unavailable for
comment last night.
As part of the research, the
group contacted the State De
partment and the Soviet Em
bassy in Washington about the
protocol involved in inviting Gor

police regarding the security that
would be required if Gorbachev
came.
According to Fleischauer, a
spokesperson from the embassy
said he thought Gorbachev
would consider a formal invita

tion, but suggested that the date
be left open in case Gorbachev
was unavailable for the com
mencement.
According to Fleischauer and
Icke, Stanford police said secur
ity would be handled by outside
agencies. Police also said they
thought the threat to Gorbachev
would be less than the threat to
