## 'Tis the Season for Movies 
### KEN SAWYER 
After being overwhelmed with a large number of
movies last Christmas, students on break this year
might feel that Santa forgot to pack new releases in
his Christmas knapsack. Between Thanksgiving and
New Year's Eve, studios will release only about 10
or 11 movies nationwide, compared to the 18
released last year.
Art Murphy, a professor at the University of
Southern California and a movie industry analyst,
explains that the movie industry has an economy of

its own. "Every four or five
years, the movie industry
has a big recession. It is
cyclical, but not preor
dained."
Murphy recalled that last
Christmas there was an
overload of bad films. "A lot
of the films we saw last
Christmas were authorized
by movie executives in 1983,
when there was a movie
boom." Big successes led

the movie moguls to produce a large number of films
without much scrutiny.
"The result," Murphy said," is that moviegoers
got fed up by the bad films and stopped going. As a
result, the films you will see this Christmas have
been more closely scrutinized."
Barbara Dixon of the Motion Picture Association
agrees. She foresees studios becoming more con
cerned with consumer preferences."The studios
realized that there ought to be more films out there
that people want to see," Dixon said, noting that the
majority of films to be released this Christmas are
rated PG and will cover a wide variety of subjects.
Nonetheless, despite the consumer-oriented
trend and the more careful selection of movies, in
dustry analysts predict lower revenues for the film
industry this Christmas. Murphy foresees a drop of
between 5 and 10 percent from last year's receipts;
and the Motion Picture Association's most recent
survey predicts revenues to be down between 5 and

6 percent from 1984.
Last Christmas and last summer, almost all the
big studios gambled that the science fiction and teen
science fiction movies would be the new "hit"
genre. "Dune," "2010" and "Starman" were popular
Christmas treats, while summer releases such as
"Back to the Future," "Real Genius," "Weird Sci
ence" and"The Man With the One Red Shoe" made
most viewers sick to their stomachs.
The only way the movie producer knows for sure
that a genre is dead is after a big failure. Unfortun
ately, for producer and viewer alike, there are
usually still some of those same genre movies in the

pipeline. Murphy explained
that every mass media busi
ness switches from genre to
genre. "It is the same with
records, Broadway plays,
books and fashion.
"What the experienced
companies will do is to diver
sify and try a wide variety of
different films looking for the
next genre," Murphy added.
This strategy seems to be
the one most studios will be

using this Christmas. The films to be released in
clude such diverse offerings as "Rocky IV," "Spies
Like Us," "Jewel of the Nile" (a sequel to "Romanc
ing the Stone"), "Santa Claus: The Movie," "The
Color Purple," "Clue" and "Young Sherlock
Holmes."
Columbia Pictures perhaps best exemplifies this
strategy. They put forth bullish predictions for their
holiday films. "We expect a better Christmas this
year than last," said John Flynn, a public relations
representative at Columbia. "We have "A Chorus
Line," "White Nights" (with Mikhail Baryshnikov)
and "Murphy's Romance" (with Sally Field and
James Garner)."
Except for Columbia's unrestrained optimism,
most studios are bracing themselves for a slow
Christmas, and taking a long term view. The booms
and busts of the movie industry come and go, and
the studios are prepared to make the best of the
current hard times.
