"Thanksgiving: An American Holiday, An American History"
Facts On File, New York, 1985.
Practically every elementary-school-aged kid in America knows the
story of Thanksgiving. In 1621, the New England settlers, grateful for a
plentiful harvest, thanked God and shared an autumn feast with the Indi
ans. They ate turkey with stuffing, corn, probably pumpkin pie, too. Since
that first day, Thanksgiving has been celebrated every year since. Some
where along the way, football games, parades and the first appearance of
Santa Claus were added to the holiday, but it is still basically the same now
as it always has been: a day of thanks.
Thanksgiving, as Diane Karter Appelbaum put it, is "a uniquely Ameri
can holiday." A Barnard graduate and an "avid researcher," Appelbaum is
the author of the recent book, "Thanksgiving: An American Holiday, An
American History." In this fascinating and well-thought-out book, she
shows that the difference between what one learns about Thanksgiving in
grade school and how Thanksgiving actually evolved is one between myth
and fact.
Appelbaum does a lot of myth-shattering in this book. At Plymouth in
1621, there may have been turkey, but there certainly wasn't any pumpkin
pie; the new colonists didn't have the flour or molasses necessary to make
it. Indians were present, but not because the pilgrims felt any special kin
ship with them; the feast was interrupted "by displays of the power of En
glish muskets for the benefit of suitably impressed Indian guests."
In fact, Appelbaum shows that Plymouthers in 1621 did not have the
"First Thanksgiving," as is commonly thought. There are more than half a
dozen towns in America which lay claim to hosting that occasion; from
Jamestown, Virginia to Canyon, Texas (that's right, Texas). Appelbaum
shows that there really was no such thing as the "First Thanksgiving."
Instead, she claims that the holiday "gradually grew up in the unique cul
ture of Puritan New England." Appelbaum convincingly argues that
Thanksgiving evolved from a lot of separate traditions: Harvest Home, a
feast in the fall to give thanks for a bountiful crop, Christmas and Civil and
Religious Proclamations, which were often issued in early colonial America
to commemorate some fortunate event.

Thanksgiving as we know it today is a combination of these different
traditions. Appelbaum explains it was "born out of a devout Puritan im
pulse to thank the Lord for His goodness once a year, (and) nurtured along
the banks of the Connecticut River by farmers who followed pious devo
tions with a wholesome celebration of crops harvested and families
reunited."
This book is full of amazing historical anecdotes. Once Appelbaum es
tablishes how Thanksgiving began — which takes the better part of three
chapters — she goes on to trace the holiday's history. More often than
not, her historical explanations are more interesting than the "myths"
learned in school; at the very least, they are more true.
Thanksgiving was used as a tool on many occasions. During the Revolu
tionary War, colonists celebrated the holiday simply to defy the British.

Yankee abolitionists in the 1850s used it as an forum for their anti-slavery
rhetoric. After the Civil War, the North forced the South to hold the feast
as an act of submission. More recently, President Franklin Roosevelt tried
to change its date to allow for more Christmas shopping days (he was
rebuked), and President Johnson used it to plug the Dernouatic Party (he
was criticized). Today, department stores use it to promote the beginning
of the Christmas shopping season and to boost sales.
Appelbaum also chronicles the westward spread of the holiday, Which
was more or less single-handedly achieved by displaced New Englanders.
Almost without fail, Thanksgiving began in new states or territories when
homesick Yankees petitioned the governor to declare the holiday. Espe
cially well-done are her accounts of "First Thanksgivings" in Hawaii and
Wisconsin, but she also gives a good description of the holiday as it was
celebrated in early lowa, California and Illinois.
It may come as a surprise to many that Thanksgiving did not actually
become an national holiday until 1942, when Congress passed a law estab
lishing it as the fourth Thursday in November. Before then, the only thing
requiring the president to declare the holiday was tradition. Appelbaum
does an excellent job of showing how Thanksgiving became official, cele
brated on the same day all across the United States.
Throughout all this history, Appelbaum continually displays a knack for
digging out the unusual detail or the amusing anecdote. She's at her best
describing an "outlaw" Thanksgiving with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid in late 19th-century Colorado, for example, or an 1885 New York City
Thanksgiving Day Parade. She's obviously done a huge amount of re
search, and utilized her sources well.
One wishes, though, that she would keep to the topic at hand. From
time to time she tries to synopsize complex historical events, and the
results are usually trite and simplistic. It is next to impossible to sum
marize the events of the Civil War in a few paragraphs, but Appelbaum at
tempts. Similarly, her four sentence explanation of why the United States
entered World War I is hopelessly condensed. These mini-history lessons
are not only foolish, but they really don't have much to do with the history
of Thanksgiving, the subject of the book.
This is, admittedly, a small fault. Overall, "Thanksgiving" is good to
bring along when one heads over the river and through the woods, in case
the real-life ceremony isn't as fascinating as Appelbaum's history makes it
sound.
