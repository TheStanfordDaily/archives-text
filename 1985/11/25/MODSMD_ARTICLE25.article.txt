## The
						Fun's Over Until Next Year 
### 
The luncheons were a memory.
The bonfire was ashes. Gaieties
had concluded its annual run. The
hangovers were reality, but the
rally in San Francisco was but a
memory. And, as the final tailgaters
dispersed, David Sweeney raised
his hand, approached the ball and
kicked off the 88th Big Game.

In three hours, Stanford fans
went through more mood swings
than the average manic-depressive
does in a week.
The first half saw happiness for
those in cardinal and white. Stan
ford rolled to that 21-0 lead and
seemed poised to make it the Big
Rout. Toi Cook was looking very
prophetic: "I want to go out with a
win, with a blowout. (A close
game) might be fun for the specta
tors, but I don't care about what's

fun for the spectators," he had said
Monday.
Stanford came out and played an
almost flawless first half. The offen
sive line dominated Cal, controlled
the line of scrimmage. They kept
John Paye from being sacked, or
even being pressured. And the
defense blanked the Bears while
coming up with four turnovers.
For those who were thinking, "I
want a close game, so it'll be more
fun," the second half provided that.
Everything that could go wrong did.
Two words were mentioned with a
sense of dread: Washington State
— memories of the 42-14 lead over
the Cougars last year that ended as
a 49-42 loss.
"It happened that they got the
kind of breaks that we got in the
first half," Coach Jack Elway said.
Breaks like a fumble that Walt Har
ris forced being called an incom
plete pass, like a pass interference
penalty being called on Brad
Humphreys after Jack Gilmete had
tipped the ball, and, of course, the
obligatory big play — a 45-yard
touchdown on a reverse by Vince
Delgado.
