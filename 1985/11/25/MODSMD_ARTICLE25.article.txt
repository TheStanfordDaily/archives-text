## The 						Fun's Over Until Next Year 
### 
The luncheons were a memory.
The bonfire was ashes. Gaieties
had concluded its annual run. The
hangovers were reality, but the
rally in San Francisco was but a
memory. And, as the final tailgaters
dispersed, David Sweeney raised
his hand, approached the ball and
kicked off the 88th Big Game.

In three hours, Stanford fans
went through more mood swings
than the average manic-depressive
does in a week.
The first half saw happiness for
those in cardinal and white. Stan
ford rolled to that 21-0 lead and
seemed poised to make it the Big
Rout. Toi Cook was looking very
prophetic: "I want to go out with a
win, with a blowout. (A close
game) might be fun for the specta
tors, but I don't care about what's

fun for the spectators," he had said
Monday.
Stanford came out and played an
almost flawless first half. The offen
sive line dominated Cal, controlled
the line of scrimmage. They kept
John Paye from being sacked, or
even being pressured. And the
defense blanked the Bears while
coming up with four turnovers.
For those who were thinking, "I
want a close game, so it'll be more
fun," the second half provided that.
Everything that could go wrong did.
Two words were mentioned with a
sense of dread: Washington State
— memories of the 42-14 lead over
the Cougars last year that ended as
a 49-42 loss.
"It happened that they got the
kind of breaks that we got in the
first half," Coach Jack Elway said.
Breaks like a fumble that Walt Har
ris forced being called an incom
plete pass, like a pass interference
penalty being called on Brad
Humphreys after Jack Gilmete had
tipped the ball, and, of course, the
obligatory big play — a 45-yard
touchdown on a reverse by Vince
Delgado.

But the Cardinal this time played
just well enough to win, coming up
with some big plays of its own.
Sean Scheller sacked Kevin Brown
on a two-point conversion, Doug
Robison rooted out a punt when
Stanford was deep in its own end,
and then John Paye found Jeff James
on a third-and-22 from the 8-yard

line for the first down. When Brad
Muster had broken a sweep for 11
yards and the final first down, the
Cardinal had retained the Stanford
Axe for another year.
"That's what makes good teams
good teams," Cook said. "They
make the big plays when they have
to."
Elway talked to his charges, led
them in the Stanford spell-out that
is becoming traditional, and let
them back onto the field to savor

the moment their effort had
brought about. When they
returned, the 4-7 season didn't
seem to matter — they had a one
game winning streak and next
season is less than 10 months
away.
"Beating Cal is big because it
helps our record, we go out on a
good note and now we're working
all year on a win. It makes spring
ball a little better," Cook said.
Then, as he and Cook waited to

be interviewed by KCBS, James
raised a subject that has not been
seriously talked about on the Farm
for some while. "Next year, we're
talking roses," he said confidently.
That wasn't typical, they agreed.
This year, a bowl game — any bowl
game — was the goal that was con
sidered achievable. The Cardinal
was a year away from a chance at
winning the conference.
Now, after the purgatory of this
4-7 season behind them, they

looked toward the paradise of
Pasadena. The losses — Barns,
center Kurt Josephson and
linebackers Gilmete and Matt
Soderlund — are serious, but mini
mal.
And the team will play a different
role. No longer will they be the
mediocre squad looking for an up
set. They will be a contender, a red
circle on other teams' schedules.
The "we're young and inexperi
enced" line that truly did account

for much of the disappointment of
1985 will not be used. The cry of
"Wait 'til next year," has new
meaning now.
Indeed, 1985 was a disappointing
season, yet talking after Saturday's
game, there was little disappoint
ment, little looking back. Attention
was focused ahead. Walking out into
the mist as the Band played its final
song of the season, you got the
feeling that soon things will be All
Right Now for Stanford football.
