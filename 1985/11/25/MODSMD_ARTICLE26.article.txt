# Clutch Plays Keep Stanford Going
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
You can't reduce a football game to two
plays, of course. But two plays in Stanford's
24-22 victory over UC-Berkeley on Saturday
are worth a long second look.
Stanford won the 88th Big Game because,
with a precarious 24-22 lead and all the mo
mentum going Cal's way, it kept its offense
on the field for the final 3:58 of the game.
Simple, or simplified, as that.
Cal Coach Joe Kapp had been so confident
of his defense's ability to stop the Cardinal
with four minutes to go that he had ordered a
punt on fourth and three. "I thought we could
get the ball back, the way our defense was
playing," he said.
And twice, it looked like he had made the

right call, like Stanford would have to punt
the ball away and give the Bears another shot
at a game-winning field goal. But on two
third-and-long plays, the Cardinal offense
proved him wrong, and in doing so, it proved
that this young team has within it the stuff of
a future contender, the stuff that it takes to
win football games when the clock is running
down.
Play No. 1. Third and 22 from the Stanford
8-yard line. Quarterback John Paye has just
been sacked on a play in which half the offen
sive line thought a screen had been called and
the other half blocked for a draw play,
opening a huge hole for the Bear defenders to
come roaring through.
Stanford Coach Jack Elway has noticed the
Cal safeties playing a two-deep zone, and he
sends in a play called "83 Z, Y read post." Z is
wide receiver Jeff James, who is to run a

down and out pattern on the right side. Y is
tight end Greg Baty, who will run a post pat
tern down the middle, while wide receiver
Spencer Cotten streaks down the left
sideline.
The idea is that the first safety will pick up
Baty on the post pattern and James will get
open on the sideline. And that's exactly what
happens, for 34 yards and a possibly game
saving first down.
"I got by the first guy and I was open in be
tween the zone," James said. "(Paye) made a
perfect pass. All I had to do was cradle it in
my arms."
"Baty influenced the safety on that side of
the field, toward the middle," Paye said.
"(The safety) had to respect that."
Elway was more eloquent. "As far as I'm
concerned, it's the best pass I've ever seen in
mv life."

Play No. 2. Third and eight from the Card
inal 44. Cal takes its final timeout, with 1:22
left in the game. Elway elects to keep the
clock moving with a running play to fullback
Brad Muster, a pitchout to the wide side of
the field.
"I liked our chances with that play," Paye
said. "It was a conservative play that could
get us a first down, and if it didn't work it
would at least run time off the clock."
But when Muster got the pitch and looked
at his blockers upfield — tackle Jeff Marchin,
guard Andy Sinclair, tailback Kevin Scott and
tight end Baty — he knew he didn't have to
be conservative.
"As soon as I started my way downhill, I
knew I had a crease," Muster said. "Kevin
Scott went one way and I went the other
