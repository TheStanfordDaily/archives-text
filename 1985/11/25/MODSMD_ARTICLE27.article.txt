# Cardinal Goes to NCAAs No. 1; Cal's Out
## 
### INGRID SEVER Staff writer 
The Stanford water polo team ac
complished everything it wanted to
on Saturday afternoon when it
defeated UC-Berkeley 6-5 in
overtime in the "Big Splash."
Before a crowd that filled the
DeGuerre Pool area, the Cardinal
was able not only to end its season
with a key victory, but it was also
able to keep Berkeley out of next
weekend's NCAA Championships.
At the same time, Stanford claimed
the top seed in the NCAAs.
"Knocking Cal out of the NCAA
competition was the major force of
motivation for winning the match,"
Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti
said. "The victory gave us the im
petus to start building up momen
tum for the championships and
ensured our No. 1 seed."
The top seed is crucial to the
Cardinal because it guarantees that
Stanford will play the tournament's
bottom seed in the first game of the
championships. As a result, the top
seed can virtually breeze through
its first match, resting up for the
next day's competition.
As in last weekend's 6-3 victory
over Cal, Stanford was able to
score the first goal and maintain its
lead through most of the match. Al
though the Bears were able to even
the score several times during the
match, they were never able to
take the lead away from the Card
inal.
"Because we were able to follow
our own game plan we took the lead
from the start and set the tempo for
the remainder of the game," Detta
manti said. "Although the scoring
kept going back and forth, we held a
subtle dominance throughout the
match."

With the score knotted at one
after the first quarter, both teams
came on strong in the second with
three goals apiece. Sparked by
Craig Klass' two goals and Jaime
Velez's one, the Cardinal moved
ahead to 4-3 late in the third. With
1:15 remaining in the second quar
ter, California scored to even the
total at four.
Reminiscent of last week's
match, very little scoring took place
in the second half, with David Im
bernino scoring once in the third for
the Cardinal and Matt Biondi putting
the match into overtime with his
surprise goal at 22 seconds left on
the clock.
"Our defense came on strong in
the second half and virtually shut
Cal out, with the exception of
Biondi's fluky goal," Dettamanti
said. "With 22 remaining, it was
really unusual for Biondi to take the
shot he did, as it was a very low
percentage shot, and the chances of
a more opportune shot probably
would have arisen. However, the
fact that he did make the shot,
lucky as it was, is all that matters."
Reacting in its typical manner,
the Cardinal took Biondi's goal in
stride and continued on with the
match. As Dettamanti said, "Our
guys were determined not to lose
another overtime game. They were
actually mad at themselves for
being in the overtime situation, and
they were sure there was no way
we were going to lose this one."
The first three-minute overtime
period was scoreless, but with 1:12
remaining in the second extra
stanza, Imbernino scored what
proved to be the winning goal. The
Cardinal stifled the Bears for the
rest of the overtime and held on for
the 6-5 win.
"It was really nice to see Imber

nino scoring again," Dettamanti
said. "It is very typical of Imber
nino, when he's determined, to
'make a shot' where there really
doesn't seem to be any real possi
bility for a goal.
"As with his shot in third quarter
that put us up (5-4), Imbernino
found a small opportunity and
created a goal out of it."

The Cardinal is usually able to
put big numbers up on the
scoreboard, maybe eight or nine
goals. But Saturday's game was
very different.
"The referees seemed to be in
timidated by the crowd, the teams
and the coaches. The seemed afraid
to make calls," Dettamanti said.
"Although the few calls they made

weren't in favor of one team of the
other, the fact that they called so
few made it very difficult to build up
any offensive momentum.
"Also, although the match was
very exciting, it wasn't one of our
better ones. Our counterattack
payed off for us, but we never
really got going. We weren't ready
for a physical game and that kind of

threw our offense for a while."
Stanford's defense, however,
was never thrown off. The Cardinal
held Berkeley to only two goals in
their six-on-five, man-up situations.
"Our defense was really to
gether, and I had no worries what
soever about its ability of hold off
Cal," Dettamanti said.


Jaime Velez's goal with 5:06 left in the second-quarter upped
Stanford's lead to 3-2. Velez's score was one of three notched

championships. As a result, the top
seed can virtually breeze through
its first match, resting up for the
next day's competition.
As in last weekend's 6-3 victory
over Cal, Stanford was able to
score the first goal and maintain its
lead through most of the match. Al
though the Bears were able to even
the score several times during the
match, they were never able to
take the lead away from the Card
inal.
"Because we were able to follow
our own game plan we took the lead
from the start and set the tempo for
the remainder of the game," Detta
manti said. "Although the scoring
kept going back and forth, we held a
subtle dominance throughout the
match."

With the score knotted at one
after the first quarter, both teams
came on strong in the second with
three goals apiece. Sparked by
Craig Klass' two goals and Jaime
Velez's one, the Cardinal moved
ahead to 4-3 late in the third. With
1:15 remaining in the second quar
ter, California scored to even the
total at four.
Reminiscent of last week's
match, very little scoring took place
in the second half, with David Im
bernino scoring once in the third for
the Cardinal and Matt Biondi putting
the match into overtime with his
surprise goal at 22 seconds left on
the clock.
"Our defense came on strong in
the second half and virtually shut
Cal out, with the exception of
Biondi's fluky goal," Dettamanti
said. "With 22 remaining, it was
really unusual for Biondi to take the
shot he did, as it was a very low
percentage shot, and the chances of
a more opportune shot probably
would have arisen. However, the
fact that he did make the shot,
lucky as it was, is all that matters."
Reacting in its typical manner,
the Cardinal took Biondi's goal in
stride and continued on with the
match. As Dettamanti said, "Our
guys were determined not to lose
another overtime game. They were
actually mad at themselves for
being in the overtime situation, and
they were sure there was no way
we were going to lose this one."
The first three-minute overtime
period was scoreless, but with 1:12
remaining in the second extra
stanza, Imbernino scored what
proved to be the winning goal. The
Cardinal stifled the Bears for the
rest of the overtime and held on for
the 6-5 win.
"It was really nice to see Imber

nino scoring again," Dettamanti
said. "It is very typical of Imber
nino, when he's determined, to
'make a shot' where there really
doesn't seem to be any real possi
bility for a goal.
"As with his shot in third quarter
that put us up (5-4), Imbernino
found a small opportunity and
created a goal out of it."

The Cardinal is usually able to
put big numbers up on the
scoreboard, maybe eight or nine
goals. But Saturday's game was
very different.
"The referees seemed to be in
timidated by the crowd, the teams
and the coaches. The seemed afraid
to make calls," Dettamanti said.
"Although the few calls they made

weren't in favor of one team of the
other, the fact that they called so
few made it very difficult to build up
any offensive momentum.
"Also, although the match was
very exciting, it wasn't one of our
better ones. Our counterattack
payed off for us, but we never
really got going. We weren't ready
for a physical game and that kind of

threw our offense for a while."
Stanford's defense, however,
was never thrown off. The Cardinal
held Berkeley to only two goals in
their six-on-five, man-up situations.
"Our defense was really to
gether, and I had no worries what
soever about its ability of hold off
Cal," Dettamanti said.


Jaime Velez's goal with 5:06 left in the second-quarter upped
Stanford's lead to 3-2. Velez's score was one of three notched

The Stanford water polo team ac
complished everything it wanted to
on Saturday afternoon when it
defeated UC-Berkeley 6-5 in
overtime in the "Big Splash."
Before a crowd that filled the
DeGuerre Pool area, the Cardinal
was able not only to end its season
with a key victory, but it was also
able to keep Berkeley out of next
weekend's NCAA Championships.
At the same time, Stanford claimed
the top seed in the NCAAs.
"Knocking Cal out of the NCAA
competition was the major force of
motivation for winning the match,"
Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti
said. "The victory gave us the im
petus to start building up momen
tum for the championships and
ensured our No. 1 seed."
The top seed is crucial to the
Cardinal because it guarantees that
Stanford will play the tournament's
bottom seed in the first game of the
championships. As a result, the top

its first match, resting up for the
