# Matmen Pin the Aggies

### PETER CASTILLO Staff writer 
After spotting UC-Davis 12 points in the first two
matches, Stanford's wrestling team rebounded to
destroy the Aggies 34-15. The Cardinal captured
seven of the final eight matches in Friday night's home
opener.
The key word for the meet was domination as the
Stanford wrestlers took control of the matches early
and did not allow the UC-Davis wrestlers to come
back. Team captain Jeff Bradley said that the team has
a new outlook this season in which domination of the
match is the key.
It did not look good for the Cardinal at the start when
Mason Gomez (118 pounds) was forced to forfeit due a
skin infection. In addition, Cardinal freshman Dave
Bischo (126 pounds) was beaten by a technical pin by
the Aggie's David Sereni 16-0, in his first varsity com
petition. A technical pin is awarded if a wrestler can
achieve a 15-point lead.
With his team down 12-0, Neil Wartnik (134 pounds)
started the Cardinal comeback by defeating Joe Rey
Valle 15-2. Wartnik dominated the match from the out
set, scoring a takedown in the first 15 seconds of the
match.
The momentum shifted to Stanford's side for good
when Bradley (142 pounds) scored a 13-2 triumph over
one of the Aggies best wrestlers, Anthony Foo.
"Even though he wrestled their star, I expected a

decisive victory by Bradley and he made Foo not look
good," Coach Chris Horpel said.
In the closest of the Cardinal's seven wins, Jeff Haz
ard defeated Steve Raizes 7-2. "Hazard has the ten
dency to be an up and down wrestler and we've
practiced to make him wrestle more evenly. I'm happy
to see him make no major mistakes," Horpel said.
In a high-scoring affair, Stanford's Pete Rogers (158
pounds) defeated Jose Flores by a technical pin, 23-8.
Rogers scored a takedown with two seconds left in the
match. On top of that, he was awarded a one-point
bonus for a minute of riding time. The extra point
boosted Rogers' lead to 15 points, good enough for a
technical pin.
Rogers' performance gave the Cardinal a 18-12 lead.
Cardinal sophomore Eric Harber (167 pounds) made
his first varsity match a success by beating Matt Gibbs
9-0. Harber sat on the bench last year behind David
Lee. Horpel believes Harber will improve throughout
the year with more playing time.
At 177 pounds, Lee wrestled a perfect match by pin
ning Dave Spurlock just over a minute into the first
period to clinch the Cardinal dual-meet victory.
Heavyweight Kurt Kassulke closed out the Stanford
victory by scoring a technical pin over David Helmuel
ler 16-1. Kassulke took control of the match early and
used his superior technique to run up the score.
The Cardinal next faces San Francisco State tomor
row in Maples Pavilion at 4 p.m. T-shirts will given to
the first 200 hundred fans. There will also be a shoe
give-away during the contest.
