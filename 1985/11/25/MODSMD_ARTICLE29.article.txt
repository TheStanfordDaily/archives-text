# Card Mauls Bears in Battle of Dailys
## 
### BUCK MONTANA Special to The Stanford Daily 
In the first of a parade of post
season classics, The Stanford Daily
opened the college football bowl
season with a 12-0 mauling of the
Daily Californian in Saturday's Ink
Bowl at Roble Field.
In claiming the coveted, but non
existent, Exacto Axe for the third
consecutive time, The Daily was
led by a Chicago Bear-like defen
sive effort which kept the helplessly
inept Daily Cal out of Stanford terri
tory all game.
The frenetic play of middle
linebacker John "Cousineau" Lis,

who intercepted two passes, and
cornerback Todd "Stone Hands"
Sitrin inspired demonic chants of
"Tatum" and "Lis" from their
teammates.
Stanford's pass rush, led by Mike
"Too Tall" Hale and Tom "Red
Dog" Senf, kept constant pressure
on Cal's quarterback.
When Cal's quarterback did get
his passes off, Stanford's coverage
was too much. Steve "Call Me As
sassin" Kasierski or Dave "Wiggin-
Top" Emerson, who also had two
interceptions, provided glue-like
coverage on Cal's receivers.
Stanford got all the points it
would need on the game's opening
play, when Jason "All-Electric

Kitchen" Cole hit Tom Gillespie on
a 50-yard bomb. Gillespie would
later score The Daily's second, in
surance touchdown on a 10-yard
fade pattern from Pete "Mr.
Touch" Haven.
Cal coaches professed to being
confused by the Stanford offensive
and defensive schemes. "We had
spies here all week. We thought
they were going to run the Washer
and Dryer (Cole and halfback Tim
Grieve) at us," one coach said.
But Stanford threw a wrench in
the works with its vaunted "Option
-0" offense, which successfully kept
the ball out of Cal's hands although
it gave up more yards than the
Stanford defense.
