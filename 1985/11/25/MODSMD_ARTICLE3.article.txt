# Garden Cultivates Rodin Lovers

### MARY MORTON 
Few Stanford students are aware
of the art treasures sitting in the
garden beyond the Quad, across
from the Oval, in the shadows of
the Old Chemistry Building.
Even Cal students seem to have
discovered the impressive collec
tion of Auguste Rodin sculptures in
the Rodin Sculpture Garden. Just
last week, one or more vandals fell
upon it, leaving spray-painted "Cs"
of approval on a few of the works.
However, experts were able to
delete the effects of this vandalism
by removing the paint and restoring
the works to their original condi
tion.
The fact is that the Rodin
Sculpture Garden, together with
works in the Stanford Museum,
form the second most important
collection in the world of this great
master's work. Only at the Musee
Rodin in Paris could one find as
many high quality examples of
Rodin's genius.
As Prof. Albert Elsen, curator of
the Rodin works, said, "There's a
lack of sophistication and interest

among the students. It's much
more convenient to go over to Half
Moon Bay, or to the Dutch Goose
(for entertainment). It's too far to
walk from the Quad. They simply
don't care.
"The least represented group
here in the gardens is students,
which is something we were aware
of when we were building," Elsen
said. "We didn't build this for the
students. It's for the community
and for those who come from far
away to see it."
In spite of his skepticism about
student interest, Elsen teaches a
seminar, "19th Century Art:
Rodin," and will offer a lecture class
in the spring simply called "Rodin."
According to Elsen, if these
more structured offerings don't fit
into students' schedules, it is possi
ble to get together a group of stu
dents from a residence, or just
friends with a common interest in
the sculptures, and approach him
about arranging a more per
sonalized tour.
He said that he provided this op
portunity to a group from Roble
