# Garden Cultivates Rodin Lovers

Few Stanford students are aware
of the art treasures sitting in the
garden beyond the Quad, across
from the Oval, in the shadows of
the Old Chemistry Building.
Even Cal students seem to have
discovered the impressive collec
tion of Auguste Rodin sculptures in
the Rodin Sculpture Garden. Just
last week, one or more vandals fell
upon it, leaving spray-painted "Cs"
of approval on a few of the works.
However, experts were able to
delete the effects of this vandalism
by removing the paint and restoring
the works to their original condi
tion.
The fact is that the Rodin
Sculpture Garden, together with
works in the Stanford Museum,
form the second most important
collection in the world of this great
master's work. Only at the Musee
Rodin in Paris could one find as
many high quality examples of
Rodin's genius.
As Prof. Albert Elsen, curator of
the Rodin works, said, "There's a
lack of sophistication and interest

among the students. It's much
more convenient to go over to Half
Moon Bay, or to the Dutch Goose
(for entertainment). It's too far to
walk from the Quad. They simply
don't care.
"The least represented group
here in the gardens is students,
which is something we were aware
of when we were building," Elsen
said. "We didn't build this for the
students. It's for the community
and for those who come from far
away to see it."
In spite of his skepticism about
student interest, Elsen teaches a
seminar, "19th Century Art:
Rodin," and will offer a lecture class
in the spring simply called "Rodin."
According to Elsen, if these
more structured offerings don't fit
into students' schedules, it is possi
ble to get together a group of stu
dents from a residence, or just
friends with a common interest in
the sculptures, and approach him
about arranging a more per
sonalized tour.
He said that he provided this op
portunity to a group from Roble

The "Meditation Without Arms' in the Rodin Garden provides
material for the musings of visitors to the outdoor sculpture
museum. This outdoor setting is not protected by any security
system, and is accessible to anyone at any hour of the day.
Hall this year, and that it is a com
mon occurrence with visiting
adults.
Elsen estimated that senior
citizens' groups and adults in gen
eral make up a much larger propor
tion of the garden's audience than
do students.
Included in the garden's collec
tion is Rodin's masterpiece "The
Gates of Hell." Twenty years in the
making, "The Gates" stand 20-feet
tall, representing in glossy bronze
Rodin's personal conception of
human suffering.
The theme was inspired
originally by Dante's "Inferno," but
Rodin preferred to draw instead
mostly from life and his own im
agination. The result is an intensely
expressive and emotional depiction
of the human tragedies of life as
seen through the artist's eyes. It in
cludes such well-known figures as
"The Thinker," "The Kiss" and
"The Three Shades."
Also in the garden are figures and
studies for "The Burghers of
Calais," another of Rodin's master
works. Figures for this work can
now be seen pacing and protesting
through the Quad.
Eventually, however, they will all
be gathered together into a single
tribute — the way Rodin intended
them to be. The "Burghers" repre
sent a noble group of citizens who
sacrificed their lives for the survival
of their city, according to a French
medieval account of the subject.
Each figure expresses a different
emotion, all in anguished response
to the cruel prospect with which
they are faced. Rodin was deeply
moved by the pain and beauty of

this dramatic act.
In addition to these pieces, one
may experience up to 12 other fas
cinating figures placed about the
one-acre garden. Other than
Rodin's, there are no gates; the

garden is fully open, 24 hours a day,
every day, free of charge.
One can view the sculptures in
the full light of day or experience
them at night, illuminated from
below, as Rodin loved to do.

Rodin's genius.
As Prof. Albert Elsen, curator of
the Rodin works, said, "There's a
lack of sophistication and interest

among the students. It's much
more convenient to go over to Half
Moon Bay, or to the Dutch Goose
(for entertainment). It's too far to
walk from the Quad. They simply
don't care.
"The least represented group
here in the gardens is students,
which is something we were aware
of when we were building," Elsen
said. "We didn't build this for the
students. It's for the community
and for those who come from far
away to see it."
In spite of his skepticism about
student interest, Elsen teaches a
seminar, "19th Century Art:
Rodin," and will offer a lecture class
in the spring simply called "Rodin."
According to Elsen, if these
more structured offerings don't fit
into students' schedules, it is possi
ble to get together a group of stu
dents from a residence, or just
friends with a common interest in
the sculptures, and approach him
about arranging a more per
sonalized tour.
He said that he provided this op
portunity to a group from Roble

The "Meditation Without Arms' in the Rodin Garden provides
material for the musings of visitors to the outdoor sculpture
museum. This outdoor setting is not protected by any security
system, and is accessible to anyone at any hour of the day.
Hall this year, and that it is a com
mon occurrence with visiting
adults.
Elsen estimated that senior
citizens' groups and adults in gen
eral make up a much larger propor
tion of the garden's audience than
do students.
Included in the garden's collec
tion is Rodin's masterpiece "The
Gates of Hell." Twenty years in the
making, "The Gates" stand 20-feet
tall, representing in glossy bronze
Rodin's personal conception of
human suffering.
The theme was inspired
originally by Dante's "Inferno," but
Rodin preferred to draw instead
mostly from life and his own im
agination. The result is an intensely
expressive and emotional depiction
of the human tragedies of life as
seen through the artist's eyes. It in
cludes such well-known figures as
"The Thinker," "The Kiss" and
"The Three Shades."
Also in the garden are figures and
studies for "The Burghers of
Calais," another of Rodin's master
works. Figures for this work can
now be seen pacing and protesting
through the Quad.
Eventually, however, they will all
be gathered together into a single
tribute — the way Rodin intended
them to be. The "Burghers" repre
sent a noble group of citizens who
sacrificed their lives for the survival
of their city, according to a French
medieval account of the subject.
Each figure expresses a different
emotion, all in anguished response
to the cruel prospect with which
they are faced. Rodin was deeply
moved by the pain and beauty of

this dramatic act.
In addition to these pieces, one
may experience up to 12 other fas
cinating figures placed about the
one-acre garden. Other than
Rodin's, there are no gates; the

garden is fully open, 24 hours a day,
every day, free of charge.
One can view the sculptures in
the full light of day or experience
them at night, illuminated from
