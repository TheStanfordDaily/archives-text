# Hoops 2nd in Tourney

### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
Last week, a few days before the in
augural weekend of the Stanford women's
1985-86 basketball season, Cardinal
Coach Tara VanDerveer mused that her
injury-ridden and relatively inexperienced
squad might be a "late-bloomer" this year.
Following the Cardinal's performance at
the Anheuser-Busch Tipoff Classic in San
Jose over the weekend, VanDerveer and
her coaching staff still doubt the delivery
of an early bouquet of roses.
"This weekend definitely answered
some questions concerning where we are
right now," said VanDerveer. "We're fur
ther behind than we thought. We have a
tremendous amount of work to do."
Sounds like a disastrous weekend,
doesn't it?
Actually, the Cardinal lost by one point
to the University of Arizona in the champi
onship game of the four-team tournament,
68-67. This might be a perfectly accep
table result for any college team, espe
cially for one that went 9-19 the year
before, but exceptional coaches believe
that the measure of performance extends
beyond the normal win-loss parameter.
"I don't think we played exceptionally

well either night. I said before that we
need to improve our rebounding and de
fensive play. They (the weaknesses) ab
solutely killed us," said Van Derveer.
It was a lapse on defense at the critical
juncture of the Arizona game that led to
the Cardinal loss. With seven seconds
remaining in the contest, and with Stan
ford leading 67-66, Wildcat point guard
Miroslava Acosta was able to drive the
lane past two Stanford defenders and lay
in the winning basket.
As in their 68-65 victory over the Uni
versity of Hawaii Friday night, the Card
inal jumped out to a comfortable, early
lead. But "inconsistent play" allowed
Arizona to remain in the contest.
Acosta, a Junior College All-America
last year, played confidently, especially
toward the end of the game, and hit bas
kets almost at will when Arizona needed it
most. Her 20-point effort in the final game
helped her garner the Most Valuable
Award for the tournament.
Six-foot-one junior forward Kim Mercer
was very instrumental in the Cardinal
scoring scheme. Her 14 points, including
clutch baskets and free throws at crucial
moments, led Stanford's attack against
the Wildcats.
In their first game against Hawaii, 5-10

junior swingman Sue Sebolt and the ever
steady, 5-3 senior guard Virginia Sourlis
helped Stanford end an 11-game losing
streak dating back to last year.
Sourlis gave Hawaii fits with seven
steals, and her seven assists led both
teams. Sebolt hit on eight-of-13 from the
field to lead the Cardinal offense.
Both Sebolt and Sourlis shot well from
outside and scored in double figures both
nights; the forward-guard tandem
received All-Tournament honors for their
efforts.
According to VanDerveer, the Card
inal's lack of depth had much to do with
the Arizona loss. That weakness is likely a
result of the recent wave of injuries that
have plagued Stanford this year.
"The loss was a painful one because we
know we could have won," VanDerveer
said. Then she optimistically added, "I
think, though, that a loss like this helps us
focus on the work we still have left to do.
If we had won a close game, we just might
have gone on our merry way.
"We play Arizona the last game of the
season. It should be a real measuring stick
for our improvement this season," the
coach added.
Hopefully, by then, the flowers will be
in season.
