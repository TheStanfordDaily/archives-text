# Cardinal Harriers Race in Wisconsin
## 
### BILL JACKSON Staff writer 
In as many years as Stanford has been
the Cardinal, the men's cross country team
has failed to make a national impression in
its rugged hill-and-dale sport. It was al
ways the Stanford women runners who
gathered the media's attention with their
brilliant recruits and top-notch perfor
mances.
However, today it will be the men's team
competing in the NCAA Championship meet
in Milwaukee, Wise., with the women's
team wishing them well. Though the
women did not qualify as a team, Stanford
managed to place two individuals, seniors
Regina Jacobs and Alison Wiley, into the
NCAA Championship meet. The two
women also compete today in Milwaukee.
Coach Brooks Johnson said that he feels
that his runners are "basically ready to
run." However, he added that they are
"less sharp than before the Pac-10 meet"
held two weeks ago.
"The kids have worked every step of the

way. It's been like swimming upstream.
They had to prove themselves this year and
the whole process took a lot out of them.
However, it should be easier next year,"
Johnson said.
"My biggest concern is to not let events
after the Pac-lOs diminish their hopes, ac
complishments and pride. In fact, the
NCAAs is almost anticlimatic after our con
ference victory. In effect, they don't have to
run out of their heads to be a good team,"
he said.
Even if the men feel any pressure, Wiley
and Jacobs have to feel as much if not more.
Both have their sights on individual cham
pionships, and without the support of their
team, the trail could be rocky.
For the men, Cardinal Marc Olesen
should vie for a NCAA victory to add to his
list of 1985 accomplishments. Oleson has
already swept to victory in the Pac-lOs and
the NCAA District-8 meet.
Pushing Olesen will be Stanford harriers
Jeff Atkinson, Ryan Stoll, Steve Schadler,
James Alborough, Brian Pettingill and Jeff
Kostoff.
