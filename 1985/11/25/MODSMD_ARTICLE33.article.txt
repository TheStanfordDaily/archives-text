CIA Officer Held as Peking Spy
WASHINGTON — A retired CIA employee was formally accused
Saturday of selling U.S. secrets to China over a span of more than
three decades — the latest case in a wave of espionage disclosures
rocking American intelligence operations in what has become known
as the "year of the spy."
Larry Wu-tai Chin, 63, who retired in 1981 as an intelligence offi
cer in the ClA's Foreign Broadcast Information Service, was ar
rested Friday night, and in a brief court appearance Saturday, was
ordered held without bail on espionage and conspiracy charges.
A government complaint and affidavit made public at the proceed
ing said that Chin had been paid more than $140,000 by the People's
Republic of China intelligence service since 1952, when he allegedly
began his spying by selling information on the location and interroga
tion of Chinese prisoners of war in Korea.
Chin's arrest came the day after a Naval Investigative Service
analyst, Jonathan Jay Pollard, was charged with supplying defense
secrets to a foreign government, identified by federal sources as Is
rael.
Protestants Stage Mass Protest
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Tens of thousands of Protestants
staged one of the biggest demonstrations in Northern Ireland's his
tory Saturday to protest an agreement that gives the mainly Catholic
Irish Republic a formal role in the province.
The agreement, signed nine days ago between Britain and Ireland,
is aimed at reducing the level of violence between Protestants and
the Catholic minority here, violence that has claimed 2,500 lives in
the past 16 years.
The huge crowd, variously estimated at between 5 percent and 10
percent of Northern Ireland's entire Protestant population of
900,000, pressed into Belfast's main downtown square and sur
rounding streets to hear their political leaders denounce the accord
and watch them sign an oath to resign their seats in the British Parli
ament to fight it.
The Anglo-Irish agreement gives the Irish Republic the right to
put forward views and proposals on issues affecting the British-ruled
north, but Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has insisted
that she relinquished no sovereignty.
Bomb Injures 23 at U.S. Base
FRANKFURT, West Germany — A car bomb exploded outside a
store for U.S. military personnel here yesterday afternoon, injuring
31 persons, at least 17 of them Americans, police said.
One of the injured, a U.S. military police officer, was in serious
condition, police said. A number of American children also were
injured.
Police said that the one-story administration building of the PX
store in central Frankfurt was so badly damaged that firefighters had
to erect special supports to prevent it from collapsing further.
The car with the bomb inside it was destroyed by the blast, which
tore a 20-inch deep crater in the road, and 40 vehicles parked nearby
were damaged. Many windows in the surrounding buildings were
shattered.
It was unclear how the car got into the area, which was guarded by
military police. Frankfurt police and U.S. military police have sealed
off the area to search for clues to the bombing.
No group has yet claimed responsibility for the blast, the second
car bomb explosion this year on an American installation in
Frankfurt.
Peking Warning Jars Hong Kong
HONG KONG — In recent days, Hong Kong has been jolted by a
warning that China will try to stop the development of a democratic
form of government in the British colony during the transition period
before it reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
China's senior representative in Hong Kong, Xu Jiatun, told a
Thursday press conference that his government does not want to
see any "radical changes" in this East Asian financial center over the
next 12 years. He indicated that current efforts to develop an elected
legislature in Hong Kong could have what he called "damaging ef
fects."
On Friday, when Xu's admonition about democracy appeared in
the local press, Hong Kong's stock market fell by 50 points, and
Hong Kong officials, including Sir Edward Youde, the British gover
nor, huddled for an emergency meeting.
Under an agreement signed by China and Britain last year, the
British agreed to return Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
In return, China agreed to let Hong Kong maintain its capitalist eco
nomic system, its civil liberties and "a high degree of autonomy" for
50 years after the changeover.
Mandela Rejects Freedom Offer
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa —With an ironic reluctance, the
South African government returned Nelson Mandela, the black
nationalist leader, to prison early Saturday, unable once again to per
suade him to accept its terms for his freedom.
Mandela, 67, former president of the outlawed African National
Congress, was taken at dawn Saturday from the Cape Town hospital
where he has been recovering from prostate surgery performed
Nov. 3 and returned to suburban Pollsmoor Prison.
The move ended nationwide speculation that Mandela was about
to be released after 23 years in prison, and left the government of
President Pieter Botha with the difficult task of explaining why he
was not freed, as so many had expected, and when he will be.
"Nelson Mandela is jailing himself now," a senior government offi
cial commented in Pretoria later Saturday. "We have done almost
everything we can to set him free except push him out the prison
gate.
Pontiff Opens Synod of Bishops
VATICAN CITY — In a colorful ceremony carefully designed to
recall the opening of the Second Vatican Council, Pope John Paul II
yesterday opened a world assembly of Roman Catholic bishops to re
assess the modernizing trends that the council set in motion 23 years
ago.
John Paul officially inaugurated the Extraordinary Synod of Bis
hops, which will be in session until Dec. 8, during a brief sermon
given before a throng of 10,000 delegates, dignitaries and faithful
who jammed the flood-lit basilica.
Details of the synod agenda were not made public yesterday, nor
was it known whether a formal document would be issued at its con
clusion.

see any "radical changes" in this East Asian financial center over the
next 12 years. He indicated that current efforts to develop an elected
legislature in Hong Kong could have what he called "damaging ef
fects."
On Friday, when Xu's admonition about democracy appeared in
the local press, Hong Kong's stock market fell by 50 points, and
Hong Kong officials, including Sir Edward Youde, the British gover
nor, huddled for an emergency meeting.
Under an agreement signed by China and Britain last year, the
British agreed to return Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
In return, China agreed to let Hong Kong maintain its capitalist eco
nomic system, its civil liberties and "a high degree of autonomy" for
50 years after the changeover.
Mandela Rejects Freedom Offer
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa —With an ironic reluctance, the
South African government returned Nelson Mandela, the black
nationalist leader, to prison early Saturday, unable once again to per
suade him to accept its terms for his freedom.
Mandela, 67, former president of the outlawed African National
Congress, was taken at dawn Saturday from the Cape Town hospital
where he has been recovering from prostate surgery performed
Nov. 3 and returned to suburban Pollsmoor Prison.
The move ended nationwide speculation that Mandela was about
to be released after 23 years in prison, and left the government of
President Pieter Botha with the difficult task of explaining why he
was not freed, as so many had expected, and when he will be.
"Nelson Mandela is jailing himself now," a senior government offi
cial commented in Pretoria later Saturday. "We have done almost
everything we can to set him free except push him out the prison
gate.
Pontiff Opens Synod of Bishops
VATICAN CITY — In a colorful ceremony carefully designed to
recall the opening of the Second Vatican Council, Pope John Paul II
yesterday opened a world assembly of Roman Catholic bishops to re
assess the modernizing trends that the council set in motion 23 years
ago.
John Paul officially inaugurated the Extraordinary Synod of Bis
hops, which will be in session until Dec. 8, during a brief sermon
given before a throng of 10,000 delegates, dignitaries and faithful
who jammed the flood-lit basilica.
Details of the synod agenda were not made public yesterday, nor
was it known whether a formal document would be issued at its con
clusion.
CIA Officer Held as Peking Spy
WASHINGTON — A retired CIA employee was formally accused
Saturday of selling U.S. secrets to China over a span of more than
three decades — the latest case in a wave of espionage disclosures
rocking American intelligence operations in what has become known
as the "year of the spy."
Larry Wu-tai Chin, 63, who retired in 1981 as an intelligence offi
cer in the ClA's Foreign Broadcast Information Service, was ar
rested Friday night, and in a brief court appearance Saturday, was
ordered held without bail on espionage and conspiracy charges.
A government complaint and affidavit made public at the proceed
ing said that Chin had been paid more than $140,000 by the People's
Republic of China intelligence service since 1952, when he allegedly
began his spying by selling information on the location and interroga
tion of Chinese prisoners of war in Korea.
Chin's arrest came the day after a Naval Investigative Service
analyst, Jonathan Jay Pollard, was charged with supplying defense
secrets to a foreign government, identified by federal sources as Is
rael.
Protestants Stage Mass Protest
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Tens of thousands of Protestants
staged one of the biggest demonstrations in Northern Ireland's his
tory Saturday to protest an agreement that gives the mainly Catholic
Irish Republic a formal role in the province.
The agreement, signed nine days ago between Britain and Ireland,
is aimed at reducing the level of violence between Protestants and
the Catholic minority here, violence that has claimed 2,500 lives in
the past 16 years.
The huge crowd, variously estimated at between 5 percent and 10
percent of Northern Ireland's entire Protestant population of
900,000, pressed into Belfast's main downtown square and sur
rounding streets to hear their political leaders denounce the accord
and watch them sign an oath to resign their seats in the British Parli
ament to fight it.
The Anglo-Irish agreement gives the Irish Republic the right to
put forward views and proposals on issues affecting the British-ruled
north, but Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has insisted
that she relinquished no sovereignty.
Bomb Injures 23 at U.S. Base
FRANKFURT, West Germany — A car bomb exploded outside a
store for U.S. military personnel here yesterday afternoon, injuring
31 persons, at least 17 of them Americans, police said.
One of the injured, a U.S. military police officer, was in serious
condition, police said. A number of American children also were
injured.
Police said that the one-story administration building of the PX
store in central Frankfurt was so badly damaged that firefighters had
to erect special supports to prevent it from collapsing further.
The car with the bomb inside it was destroyed by the blast, which
tore a 20-inch deep crater in the road, and 40 vehicles parked nearby
were damaged. Many windows in the surrounding buildings were
shattered.
It was unclear how the car got into the area, which was guarded by
military police. Frankfurt police and U.S. military police have sealed
off the area to search for clues to the bombing.
No group has yet claimed responsibility for the blast, the second
car bomb explosion this year on an American installation in
Frankfurt.
Peking Warning Jars Hong Kong
HONG KONG — In recent days, Hong Kong has been jolted by a
warning that China will try to stop the development of a democratic
form of government in the British colony during the transition period
before it reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
