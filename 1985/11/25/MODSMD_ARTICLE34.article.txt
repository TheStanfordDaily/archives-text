# Egyptian Commandos Storm Hijacked Jet
## Death toll at 57; Egyptian military put on alert against Libya 
### 
VALLETTA, Malta, and CAIRO, Egypt â€”
More than 50 people were killed yesterday when
Egyptian commandos stormed a hijacked Egyp
t Air jetliner with gunfire and explosives, and the
Arab terrorists on board detonated hand
grenades in the crowded passenger compart
ment.
The Boeing 737 jetliner was seized on a flight
Saturday from Athens to Cairo 10 minutes after
taking off from Athens airport.
The commando assault on the hijacked plane,
carried out in darkness by Egyptian army per
sonnel with Maltese government approval, set
off a fire that destroyed the interior of the plane.
Police officials said early today that the death
toll was 57. Among the dead were eight children.
Meanwhile, Egypt, apparently convinced that
Libya is behind the hijacking, put its armed
forces on heightened alert yesterday and sent
reinforcements toward the Libyan border, offi
cial sources said.
The military mobilization, not officially an
nounced but confirmed by government and
diplomatic sources, began before Egyptian com
mandos stormed the hijacked jetliner.
Although no figures were disclosed, there
were reports of large-scale troop movements

along the major desert roads leading southwest
from Cairo, in the direction of the Libyan border,
and also northward from the capital.
Casualties of the hijacking included an Ameri
can woman who was shot to death by the hijack
ers, and four others, two Americans and two Is
raelis, who were wounded in what were
decribed as "execution" attempts before the as
sault on the plane.
Joel Levy, deputy chief of the U.S. Embassy
in Malta, confirmed that three Americans were
aboard the Egypt Air plane and that one was
killed.
Coincidentally, the Egypt Air plane was the
same one that was forced down by U.S. Air
Force jets last month to the Sigonella Air Base in
Sicily after it left Egypt carrying the Arab hijack
ers of the Italian cruise liner Achille Lauro.
According to the plane's pilot, Hani Galal, and
three passengers, the hijackers, who appeared
to be speaking with Palestinian accents, threat
ened to begin executing their hostages unless
their demands were met, beginning with the Is
raeli captives and then the Americans.
When it left Athens, the plane carried 91 pas
sengers, including the hijackers, and six crew
members. There were at least four hijackers and

possibly a fifth, according to Maltese officials.
The gunmen demanded to be taken to Malta's
Luqa International Airport, where authorities at
first closed the facility, but then agreed to allow
the plane to land when the pilot said he was run
ning low on fuel.
After the plane landed, the hijackers' apparent
leader, who identified himself only as Nabil, ac
cording to the pilot, demanded that the plane be
refueled. He said he would begin killing pas
sengers every 15 minutes to enforce his
demands.
"Fifteen minutes later exactly, they shot an
Israeli girl at point-blank range in the face and
then threw her off the plane," Galal said.
Thirty minutes later, the hijackers shot their
second victim.
The assault on the aircraft began with the
Egyptians blowing a hole through the aircraft's
floor from the cargo hold and storming the over
wing doors. At the sound of the explosion, the
pilot said, the hijackers threw their grenades into
the passenger compartment.
The hijackers Saturday claimed to belong to a
group called Egypt Revolution, which last Au
gust assumed responsibility for the shooting of
an Israeli diplomat in Cairo.
