# Israel Indicates Involvement in Spy Case
## 
### 
JERUSALEM — In a statement
widely interpreted here as an ad
mission of lower-level involvement,
Israeli political leaders yesterday
expressed "shock and consterna
tion" over the case of a U.S. Navy
intelligence analyst accused of sel
ling defense secrets to Israel.
The statement, released by Is
rael's Foreign Ministry, pledged
that if there has been "a deviation"
from longstanding policy against
such intelligence-gathering in the
United States, "the necessary con
clusions will be drawn" — an Israeli
euphemism meaning that those
found responsible will be fired.

Yesterday's was the most sub
stantive official comment to emerge
here since Navy analyst Jonathan
Pollard was arrested Thursday
outside the Israeli Embassy in
Washington. U.S. authorities said
that Pollard admitted receiving
$50,000 in return for defense
secrets he sold to Israel and Pakis
tan.
The Israeli press yesterday
quoted U.S. media reports that Pol
lard had sold secret codes for inter
cepting U.S. Navy satellite trans
missions and other communica
tions.
In its only previous official com

ment, the Foreign Ministry said last
Friday that "we do not have the
slightest idea about this matter."
The new Israeli statement came
after a full day of intensive, top
level consultations that underlined
concern here that the affair could
damage Israel's U.S. ties.
Israel radio reported that Secre
tary of State George Shultz had ex
pressed irritation over the incident
in a weekend meeting with Israeli
Minister Without Portfolio Moshe
Arens.
Israel television said in its even
ing news broadcast last night that
"from the official statement, we see

for the first time an admission that
the Israeli intelligence services are
involved in the spy affair."
Asked by the independent news
paper Haaretz if it was conceivable
that such an action could take place
without high-level directives from
Jerusalem, Isser Harel, former
chief of theMossad, Israel's equiva
lent of the CIA, replied:
"Theoretically this is possible, even
though, as a rule, activity such as
this is not carried out without
directives from above. If this took
place with the government's knowl
edge, then this is a grave mistake
on the political level."
