Panel Passes Tax Bill
WASHINGTON — After months of delicaie
political manuevering, the House Ways and
Means Committee approved a comprehensive
tax-revision bill early Saturday that would
reduce the top personal income tax rate from
today's 50 percent to 38 percent and raise the
personal exemption to $2,000 for most tax
payers.
The measure, approved by voice vote,
bears a distinctly Democratic stamp that
makes it likely to win approval in the House
before Congress adjourns next month. But
major tax revision still faces an uphill struggle
next year in the Republican-controlled Senate,
despite indications that President Reagan will
not reject the package put together by Ways
and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D
-111.).
Although the package is designed to take ef
fect on Jan. 1, 1986, past delays by the White
House and continuing debate in Congress are
likely to postpone its implementation until
1987, even if a new tax law is enacted by the
middle of next year.
In the end, the committee accepted a final
plan that telescopes today's multiplicity of tax
rates into four individual tax brackets instead
of the three Reagan wanted. It provides for
personal exemptions of $2,000 and a standard
deduction for couples of $4,800 ($2,950 for
singles). Those figures would mean that a fam
ily of four would not pay any income tax on its
first $12,800 in income.

The package would reduce the personal tax
burden by about $137 billion over five years,
while raising corporate taxes by an equivalent
amount.
Regan Issues Apology
WASHINGTON — White House chief of
staff Donald Regan apologized on television
yesterday for his comment before last week's
summit meeting that most women would be in
terested only in the human side of the meeting
and did not understand arms control or other
issues discussed in Geneva.
"It was not intended as a put-down of any
woman, and if anyone feels offended by it, I
apologize," Regan said when interviewer Les
ley Stahl braced him with the question during
an appearance on CBS News' televised "Face
the Nation."
Conceding that the quotation as published in
a Washington Post interview left an
"implication . . . that I didn't think women un
derstood it," Regan said that on the contrary
"I know women understand — many women
understand — these things."
The quotation in question developed during
an interview that Regan said took place last
October and was dropped into a Post story
about First Lady Nancy Reagan's schedule at
the summit meeting. The words that drew
protests from women's groups from coast to
coast were:

"They're not going to understand (missile)
throw-weights or what is happening in Afghan
istan or what is happening in human rights.
Some women will, but most women — believe
me, your readers for the most part if you took
a poll — would rather read the human interest
stuff."
Senate OKs Farm Bill
WASHINGTON — The Republican
controlled Senate bowed to Democratic pres
sure Saturday night and passed a new four
year farm bill that critics said would do little to
improve the nation's battered agricultural eco
nomy.
The measure would mean reduced income
for farmers over the next four years, but it
also represented a setback for the Reagan Ad
ministration. Despite heavy White House pres
sure to cut farm program costs even further,
the compromise was estimated to be several
billion dollars above the $50 billion the Admin
istration had deemed acceptable.
Two key elements of the compromise in
cluded: A two-year freeze on income subsidies
paid to grain, rice and cotton farmers, instead
of the one-year freeze sought by the White
House. Democrats who wanted a four-year
freeze had blocked final action on an earlier
"multiple choice" version crafted by Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) that
contained both a one-year and a four-year
freeze.
