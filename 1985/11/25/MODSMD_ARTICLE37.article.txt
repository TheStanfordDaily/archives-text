Cutters Reject Offer
LOS ANGELES — Union negotiators

ment was submitted during a long session Sat

locked out the workers at their stores.
Gay Officials Meet
WEST HOLLYWOOD — Delegates to the
first national Conference of Lesbian and Gay
Officials Saturday called for a dramatic in
crease in the number of openly gay office
holders, saying they can no longer depend
solely on liberal allies to champion causes such
as the battle against AIDS.
The three-day conference is being spon
sored by gay and lesbian clubs and the
Municipal Elections Committee of Los An
geles. It is hosted by the City of West Holly
wood, which made international headlines last
year when gays captured the majority of the

City Council seats.
California accounts for nearly a fourth of the
country's openly gay elected officials, accord
ing to conference organizers. But there were
gay representatives from several other states.
Three gay officials from Minnesota, including a
state senator, attended. There also were gay
office holders from Massachusetts, Missouri,
New York, Wisconsin and Florida.
