# Kaplan Criticizes Committee as Illegitimate
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
In a Nov. 20 memo to the ASSU
Committee on Investigations, Law
Prof. John Kaplan questioned the
committee's "legitimacy as an in
vestigative body" iri response to ac
cusations by committee spokesmen
of a conflict of interest between
Kaplan and the University.
The committee decided Nov. 13
that a report prepared by Kaplan
regarding alleged police brutality
toward students at an Old Union
sit-in last month, "was not ade
quate" and warranted fufther inves
tigation.

"Not only do I question (the com
mittee's) legitimacy as an inves
tigatory body, but I feel that (the
committee's) pretensions to a lack
of bias are ridiculous," Kaplan said
in the memo.
In response to criticism by Biol
ogy Prof. Dow Woodward, a mem
ber of the committee, that Kaplan
"was developing a report for the
University in which he works,"
Kaplan said yesterday that
"(Woodward) also works for the
University."
"You don't have to be a law pro
fessor to recognize a kangaroo
court," Kaplan said. He also
criticized The Daily for "playing

along" with the committee's asser
tion.
Woodward said yesterday that
Kaplan's criticism was "irrelevant."
"The committee is not the inves
tigative (body)," Woodward said,
explaining that the actual investiga
tion will be carried out by an
"outside body" that the committee
will select.
"We're not pretending to have a
lack of bias," ASSU Senate Chair
Carey White said yesterday.
"Anybody inside of Stanford will
have a bias. That's why we're
trying to find someone outside of
the University."
He acknowledged that Kaplan did
a "thorough job" on the report and

"is extremely knowledgeable about
police procedure."
"The question is, 'Should you
have an inside person (carry out the
investigation)?' "White said.
"That's not what they said to
begin with," Kaplan said in
response to White's remarks.
"They were pretending to be un
biased. Now they're not."
Council of Presidents member
Mike Collins said last night that
while he didn't know if an ASSU in
vestigation would be more effective
than the Kaplan report, "the senti
ment exists that the report was in
complete. Students have told me
