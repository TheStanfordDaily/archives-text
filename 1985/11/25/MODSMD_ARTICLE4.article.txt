# Kaplan Criticizes Committee as Illegitimate
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
In a Nov. 20 memo to the ASSU
Committee on Investigations, Law
Prof. John Kaplan questioned the
committee's "legitimacy as an in
vestigative body" iri response to ac
cusations by committee spokesmen
of a conflict of interest between
Kaplan and the University.
The committee decided Nov. 13
that a report prepared by Kaplan
regarding alleged police brutality
toward students at an Old Union
sit-in last month, "was not ade
quate" and warranted fufther inves
tigation.

"Not only do I question (the com
mittee's) legitimacy as an inves
tigatory body, but I feel that (the
committee's) pretensions to a lack
of bias are ridiculous," Kaplan said
in the memo.
In response to criticism by Biol
ogy Prof. Dow Woodward, a mem
ber of the committee, that Kaplan
"was developing a report for the
University in which he works,"
Kaplan said yesterday that
"(Woodward) also works for the
University."
"You don't have to be a law pro
fessor to recognize a kangaroo
court," Kaplan said. He also
criticized The Daily for "playing

along" with the committee's asser
tion.
Woodward said yesterday that
Kaplan's criticism was "irrelevant."
"The committee is not the inves
tigative (body)," Woodward said,
explaining that the actual investiga
tion will be carried out by an
"outside body" that the committee
will select.
"We're not pretending to have a
lack of bias," ASSU Senate Chair
Carey White said yesterday.
"Anybody inside of Stanford will
have a bias. That's why we're
trying to find someone outside of
the University."
He acknowledged that Kaplan did
a "thorough job" on the report and

"is extremely knowledgeable about
police procedure."
"The question is, 'Should you
have an inside person (carry out the
investigation)?' "White said.
"That's not what they said to
begin with," Kaplan said in
response to White's remarks.
"They were pretending to be un
biased. Now they're not."
Council of Presidents member
Mike Collins said last night that
while he didn't know if an ASSU in
vestigation would be more effective
than the Kaplan report, "the senti
ment exists that the report was in
complete. Students have told me
that the report was like a
whitewash."
Woodward said that the commit
tee had found "a number of things
which seemed to be inadequate" in
the report, citing as one example
Kaplan's references to to the
"appropriate" amount of pain during
the Old Union arrests.
"The Kaplan report raised the
issue of how much (pain) is appro
priate. It's difficult for us to under
stand how any pain is appropriate,"
Woodward said.
White added that the committee's
intention was not to "start over
from the ground" again. "Our com
mittee is not set up to repudiate
everything Kaplan has done," he
said.
Kaplan's memo also complained
of the "imperious summons" he had
received to appear before the
ASSU council.
Kaplan said that his secretary
relayed a message to him from a
committee member "announcing
when I was to appear before the
ASSU."
White said the apparent lack of
diplomacy resulted from a misun
derstanding when the message was
left for Kaplan.
