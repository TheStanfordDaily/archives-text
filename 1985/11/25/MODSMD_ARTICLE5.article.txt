Equating research to speech as a fundamental
freedom of professors, University President
Donald Kennedy addressed the ethics of re
search Friday before nearly 100 people at
Memorial Church.
"Research is an intellect coping with an impor
tant problem and trying to analyze it and then
(saying) something about the result of that analy

five forums on "Social Responsibility of the
Modern University."
The tightly-managed operations of private

firms, which specialize in the high-risk process of
converting basic research to applied technolo
gies, present "an entire set of contrasts" to a
university setting, Kennedy said.
According to Kennedy, 90 percent of basic re
search is publicly funded.
Although the decisions on "what to work on
and how to work on it" are left to individual fac

search ventures because basic research con
stitutes 50 percent of University's business as
well as faculty time.
"The University asserts, then, an involve
ment with the research venture by saying it is
part of our work and it is part of what we corn

pensate faculty members to carry out," Kennedy
said.
"In return, we assert a degree of control of
the way faculty members spend that part of their
professional lives and what happens to the re
sulting intellectual property."
Unlike many universities, Stanford allows indi
vidual faculty members to "own" the products of
their research, Kennedy said. "The fundamental
concern is that the intellectual property belongs
to the individual."
This concern has Stanford battling the U.S.
Department of Energy on proposals that would
force universities to accept that department's
