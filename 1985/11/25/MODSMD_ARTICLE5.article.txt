# Kennedy Calls Research a Basic Right

Equating research to speech as a fundamental
freedom of professors, University President
Donald Kennedy addressed the ethics of re
search Friday before nearly 100 people at
Memorial Church.
"Research is an intellect coping with an impor
tant problem and trying to analyze it and then
(saying) something about the result of that analy
sis," Kennedy said during the last of a series of
five forums on "Social Responsibility of the
Modern University."
The tightly-managed operations of private

firms, which specialize in the high-risk process of
converting basic research to applied technolo
gies, present "an entire set of contrasts" to a
university setting, Kennedy said.
According to Kennedy, 90 percent of basic re
search is publicly funded.
Although the decisions on "what to work on
and how to work on it" are left to individual fac
ulty, Kennedy said Stanford is involved in re
search ventures because basic research con
stitutes 50 percent of University's business as
well as faculty time.
"The University asserts, then, an involve
ment with the research venture by saying it is
part of our work and it is part of what we corn

pensate faculty members to carry out," Kennedy
said.
"In return, we assert a degree of control of
the way faculty members spend that part of their
professional lives and what happens to the re
sulting intellectual property."
Unlike many universities, Stanford allows indi
vidual faculty members to "own" the products of
their research, Kennedy said. "The fundamental
concern is that the intellectual property belongs
to the individual."
This concern has Stanford battling the U.S.
Department of Energy on proposals that would
force universities to accept that department's
own classified research guidelines.
Stanford is actively lobbying against
this proposal, Kennedy said.
"We're very firm about not taking
classified research, and 1 don't ex
pect any change in (our)
policy. ... 1 certainly would not
urge any," he said.
Although Stanford controls the
research process, such as the use
of animal and human subjects and
open distribution of knowledge, it
leaves the formation of research
policies to faculty members and the
Faculty Senate, Kennedy said.
"The decision whether to permit
a certain kind of research is really a
faculty decision," Kennedy said.
"The Committee on Research is a
committee of the Academic Senate,
and the issue that they address is:
'Should the faculty decide that it
ought to regulate individual mem
bers of the faculty with respect to
denying certain kinds of re
search?' "
The possibility of "evil" end uses
of the research was dismissed by
the Faculty Senate as a compelling
reason to limit research because of
the difficulty of making a collective
judgment on the moral ramifications
of the end use, Kennedy said.
