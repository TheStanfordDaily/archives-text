# Survey Says Students Want Jobs
## 
### DAN De LUCE Staff writer 
A survey conducted by the Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC) this spring determined that
48 percent of Stanford's undergraduates receiving
degrees in 1984-85 intend to pursue full-time jobs
within the next year after graduation.
The survey said 52 percent of that group accepted
job offers prior to graduation.
The study was based upon 1,600 students who
received degrees in 1984-85 — 65 percent were un
dergraduates, 27 percent were master degree stu
dents and 8 percent were doctoral degree students.
A higher number of undergraduates in engineering
and earth sciences reported job acceptances than did
those in the humanities and sciences. The survey also
showed students in natural science, mathematics, so
cial science and humanities have a greater tendency to
go to graduate school.
Among undergraduates who had accepted a job, 36
percent listed business as the occupational field of their
employer, while 35 percent listed science and/or engi
neering.
Regarding "after graduation plans," students in
humanities (10.8 percent) and social science (13.9 per
cent) responded that they were undecided more often
than students in earth science (3.6 percent), engineer
ing (3.1 percent) and natural science and mathematics
(6.3 percent).
One conclusion made from the survey was:
"Perhaps more career planning and career decision
making programs should be directed toward this popu

lation (humanities and social science students)."
The survey was prepared by James Patterson, the
coordinator of engineering and science counseling at
the CPPC, who has previously conducted a similar sur
vey of engineering graduates.
Individual departments have conducted such sur
veys of their students, but the response rates have
been poor, Patterson said.
The idea for a campus-wide study grew out of a need
to know the plans of all graduates, not just those in en
gineering, he added.
Parents would often call the CPPC, Patterson said,
concerned over the job prospects of Stanford students.
During the last recession there developed a need to
know whether Stanford students' prospects would be
affected, he said.
"I wanted to show Stanford students do well irre
spective of economic conditions," Patterson said.
In the survey, on-campus interviews were identified
by 50 percent of undergraduates as a CPPC service
they had used, while 43 percent said they used the
career resource library and 40 percent had participated
in the annual Career Faire.
Students graduating with a masters degree in the
School of Education, and earth sciences and engineer
ing said they intended to pursue full-time employment
in higher numbers than those masters students in natu
ral scietfce, humanities and social science.
Among the doctoral degree students who responded
to the survey, 87 percent indicated they would pursue
full-time employment in the next year, and of these 63
percent had already secured a job.
Data for graduates in the schools of business, law or
medicine are excluded from the study.
