### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
The arraignment of John
Suppes, suspected of numerous
campus burglaries that have
occurred since August, was
postponed Friday to Dec. 2 at
the request of his attorney.
At next week's hearing at the
Palo Alto Municipal Court,
Suppes must enter a plea of
guilty, not guilty or no contest to
his alleged involvement in the
thefts.
Suppes, who told officials he is
a student at Foothill College and
lives at 678 Mirada, Stanford,
was charged with burglary, pos
session of stolen property and
attempting to evade arrest.
He has been detained at the
Santa Clara County Jail in San
Jose in lieu of $5,500 bail since
his Oct. 23 arrest for the theft of
a Walkman and cassette at
Columbae House.

Since then, at least four more
burglary charges have been filed
against Suppes for his involve
ment in alleged thefts at Lambda
Nu, Phi Sig House, Theta Chi
and Bldg. 520, according to
Stanford Police Detective Mike
Seamons.
Although $800 to $1,000
worth of property was stolen in
the three weeks after Suppes'
arrest, Stanford police officers
have said that the frequency of
campus burglaries has decreased
since since Oct. 23. There were
more than 60 campus thefts be
tween Sept. 1 and Suppes' ar
rest, according to police.
Suppes was caught after resi
dents of Columbae found him in
the house and called the police.
Suppes fled, but police found him
hiding on a porch at the corner of
Alvarado Row and Campus
Drive.
Suppes is a suspect in many
campus burglaries, said Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
