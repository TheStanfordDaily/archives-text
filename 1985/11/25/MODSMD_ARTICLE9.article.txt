# Palo Alto Weighs Divestment Plan
## 
### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
The Palo Alto City Council will consider a pro
posal today that could divest city funds from
companies that do business in South Africa.
Introduced by council members Ellen Fletcher
and Larry Klein, the resolution directs city staff
to prepare an ordinance prohibiting city invest
ments "directly or indirectly in the public or
private sector of South Africa or Namibia, as
long as apartheid is the official policy of those
countries."
Officially known as South-West Africa,
Namibia has been occupied by South Africa for
decades.
While Finance Director Mark Harris told the
San Jose Mercury News that the city's invest
ment portfolio is "clean â€” to the best of our
knowledge," Fletcher told The Daily yesterday
she believes an official city policy would be a
more effective political tool and a better
safeguard.
"Recent events have shown that economic
pressure against the abhorrent and immoral
apartheid policies of South Africa is effective in
moving an otherwise intransigent government
towards compromise," reads the letter from
Fletcher and Klein to the council.
According to the Mercury News, Klein ex
pects today's vote on the resolution to be a close
one.

"We're hoping for a lot of support," Fletcher
said yesterday. "It's questionable whether or not
the resolution will pass."
On Friday, only Fletcher, Klein and Council
woman Emily Renzel openly supported the pro
posal. However, Councilwoman Betsy Bechtel,
an employee of Citicorp Savings, may abstain,
and the support of the other five council mem
bers, all of whom expressed personal dislike of
apartheid, is uncertain, Fletcher said.
"The problem we face with an issue like this is
that it's not directly related to the city," Fletcher
said. "There's the argument that the city council
has no business interfering in national and inter
national issues."
Cities should recognize and exercise their in
fluence over global affairs or they will find them
selve in isolationist positions, according to Mi
chael Shuman, a 1982 graduate of Stanford Law
School who is scheduled to address the city
council tonight on the issue of Palo Alto's divest
ment.
"Cities cannot roll over and play dead" regard
ing international issues, said Shuman, the foun
der and director of Center for Innovative
Diplomacy (CID), a local peace research organi
zation that seeks to increase citizen participation
in foreign affairs.
Stanford Education Prof. Martin Carnoy and
junior Donna Anderson, a member of Stanford
Out of South Africa, are also scheduled to ad
dress the council tonight.
"Each city acting alone (on divestment) is not

decisive, but if enough do ... it would effect the
economy and send a clear message to the gov
ernment of South Africa," Fletcher said.
"Pressure like this does work. [South Africa]
cannot ignore worldwide public opinion," she
said.
If their resolution to direct city staff to prepare
a divestment ordinance does not pass, "it dies,"
Fletcher said. "It can be brought up again, but it
would go before the same council that voted it
down, so there wouldn't be much point."
The inclusion of the proposal on today's
agenda came as "something of a surprise for
local anti-apartheid activists," according to a
press release from the Mid-Peninsula Coalition
Against Apartheid (MPCAA).
The organization had proposed a divestment
ordinance similar to one adopted by Oakland
and had begun petitioning for it, the release
stated.
Such an ordinance would increase the pres
sure on Stanford to divest, according to the
MPCAA release.
If the city approves the divestment ordinance,
it would join Berkeley, Los Angeles, Oakland,
San Francisco, Santa Cruz and Santa Monica,
which have approved similar ordinances.
Also to be considered at today's meeting is a
recommendation from the council's legislation
committee that the city of Palo Alto support the
strongest possible resolution against apartheid at
the upcoming conference of the national League
of Cities.
