To many of the current and retired faculty mem
bers who live in the Pearce Mitchell condominiums,
dealing with termites is just part of the daily routine.
It is time for the University, which developed the
condominiums a decade ago and has been receiving
complaints that the buildings suffer from faulty con
struction ever since, to take steps to insure that
Pearce Mitchell residents receive the decent
housing to which every community member should
be entitled.
According to current Pearce Mitchell residents,
faulty construction in 82 of the condominiums has
resulted in termite infestation, dry rot and water
leaks. While the University has made a "good faith
attempt" to repair the units since then, it has been
unable to correct the problems, according to Mark
Scott Collins, attorney for the Pearce Mitchell
House Owner's Association.
Last month, the homeowners filed suit against
Stanford, architects Wong & Brocchini, consulting
engineers Brian-Kangas-Foulk & Associates and
the building contractor, Wheatley Associates, asking
for the full cost of repairing the homes, which in
cludes tearing down walls and fixing roofs.
Although Stanford was the developer, it is not
liable for the damage, according to Lee Thompson,
associate staff counsel for the University. There is

not enough information to determine responsibility,
he said.
As Thompson said, the fault may lie with the ma
terials, the contractors or anything else that contrib
uted to the planning and construction of the con
dominiums. But who was the developer? Who over
saw the operation?
As the developer, Stanford was "essentially the
party that puts the whole deal together," and was
responsible for choosing the building contractor, ac
cording to Hamell.
Even if Stanford is not completely at fault, the fact
remains that there are serious problems with the
condominiums it developed. Living with termites,
dry rot and water leaks cannot be a comfortable sit
uation, and the retired and current professors of this
University — indeed, all people — deserve better
living conditions.
Stanford does have responsibility for the housing
it developed and is at least partially responsible for
the damage. Instead of citing a lack of evidence and
denying any blame, it should simply accept the re
sponsibility and assist the residents in repairing the
units.
The faculty of this University deserve comforta
ble homes, not damaged condominiums.
