## Summit Was a 'Symbolic Carnival' 
### 
The newspaper headlines the day
after the summit were almost unan
imous in their approbation: "Even
Reagan's critics praise summit,"
"Summit praised as fresh start,"
"Russian people feel good about
summit," and "What the talks
achieved," they boldly proclaimed.
Congress was no less enthusiastic.
Administration critics and support
ers alike gave the president a
three-minute standing ovation upon
his return from Geneva, and his
speech to Congress was inter
rupted 21 times by applause.
From the hero's welcome given
Reagan and the broad enthusiasm
about the summit, one might have
thought that the event had occa
sioned a historic breakthrough in
arms control or human rights.
Surely there was a reason for all

VIEWPOINT

that excitement and praise. But in
fact, after the summit, nothing has
changed. No weapons systems
have been forfeited, and the two
sides are still building six nuclear
weapons each day. Both sides are
still pressing ahead with the
militarization of space. The future
of SALT II and the Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty is no less in doubt —
a victory for Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger, even if he
wasn't allowed to come to Geneva.
We are still no closer to a nuclear
test ban, despite the Soviet Union's
dramatic suspension of its own test
program. Finally, the Afghans,
Poles, Nicaraguans and Sal
vadorans are no closer to freedom
from foreign intervention, and the
dignity of Soviet Jewry is no more
secure.
The real and tragic story of the
summit is this: At a time when the
two superpowers have rough nu
clear parity and are perched on the
brink of a ruinously expensive arms
race in space, the Rev. Jesse Jack

son presented the two superpower
leaders with the signatures of one
and-a-half-million Americans,
hastily gathered by the Nuclear
Freeze Campaign, urging the two
men to end the arms race now. The
summit-makers on the Soviet side
sent Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev himself to make a warm
hearted speech to Jackson and the
"Women for a Meaningful Summit"
delegation, while the State Depart
ment sent a lower-echelon official.
And not a single one of the . 50,000
nuclear weapons the two leaders
control was given up. Meanwhile,
the media relegated this story to a
small corner of their reports,
choosing to elevate the intricacies
of Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorba
chev's "style wars" above the real
issue of the Summit: "Star Wars."
How, we might ask, did such a
monumental non-event as this sum
mit earn the president such admira
tion and enthusiam? There are
three reasons. First, in the five
years since Reagan took office, su
perpower relations have sunk to
such depths of rhetorical enmity,
and the superpowers' records on
arms control and human rights have
been so unremittingly abysmal that
our standards have become
debased. In the context of the
recent climate of accusation and
counter-accusation, it seemed like a
major achievement that the two
leaders could even talk in a civil
fashion to one another.
Second, the summit somehow
was redefined so that it was no
longer concerned with global prob
lems but with the personal
encounter, even combat, between
the two leaders. ("Did Reagan win
or did Gorbachev?" the KTVU
newscaster asked panel of
"experts.") Thus we were encour
aged to ask not whether the summit
solved any major problems, but
whether our player put up a good
performance.

Finally, the summit seemed suc
cessful because it was treated by
the politicians and the media as a
symbolic event — one where
words mattered more than deeds.
This is the transformation of politics
which Reagan and Gorbachev, with
their careful attention to style and
image, have brought about. Now,
to say that nuclear weapons must
be cut becomes as politically satis
fying as actually cutting them, and
we assume that the summit must
have been historic and important
because Reagan, using the magical
power of words, tells us it was.
As a symbolic carnival, the sum
mit was a great success: Both
leaders were seen to be able to
smile, to shake hands, to have good
manners and to be able to answer
questions (at least after they were
explained). As an attempt to solve
perilous global problems, the sum
mit was a tragic, but not unex
pected, failure.
Those of us who care about arms
control find ourselves in a strange
situation. We have long pushed for a
resumption of serious dialogue be
tween the two superpowers, and it
was the insistent strength of the
freeze movement which largely
caused the summit to occur. And
yet the very dialogue we pressed
for, even when it produces nothing
of substance, is celebrated as a suc
cess by the media and used by the
weapon-makers to lull the public
into a false sense of security. Until
we find a way of separating the
politics of symbolism from the
politics of substance in the public
debate, we will continue to be vul
nerable to the infuriating ability of
those in power to use our ideals to
legitimize the continuation of busi
ness as usual.

that excitement and praise. But in
fact, after the summit, nothing has
changed. No weapons systems
have been forfeited, and the two
sides are still building six nuclear
weapons each day. Both sides are
still pressing ahead with the
militarization of space. The future
of SALT II and the Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty is no less in doubt —
a victory for Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger, even if he
wasn't allowed to come to Geneva.
We are still no closer to a nuclear
test ban, despite the Soviet Union's
dramatic suspension of its own test
program. Finally, the Afghans,
Poles, Nicaraguans and Sal
vadorans are no closer to freedom
from foreign intervention, and the
dignity of Soviet Jewry is no more
secure.
The real and tragic story of the
summit is this: At a time when the
two superpowers have rough nu
clear parity and are perched on the
brink of a ruinously expensive arms
race in space, the Rev. Jesse Jack

son presented the two superpower
leaders with the signatures of one
and-a-half-million Americans,
hastily gathered by the Nuclear
Freeze Campaign, urging the two
men to end the arms race now. The
summit-makers on the Soviet side
sent Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev himself to make a warm
hearted speech to Jackson and the
"Women for a Meaningful Summit"
delegation, while the State Depart
ment sent a lower-echelon official.
And not a single one of the . 50,000
nuclear weapons the two leaders
control was given up. Meanwhile,
the media relegated this story to a
small corner of their reports,
choosing to elevate the intricacies
of Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorba
chev's "style wars" above the real
issue of the Summit: "Star Wars."
How, we might ask, did such a
monumental non-event as this sum
mit earn the president such admira
tion and enthusiam? There are
three reasons. First, in the five
years since Reagan took office, su
perpower relations have sunk to
such depths of rhetorical enmity,
and the superpowers' records on
arms control and human rights have
been so unremittingly abysmal that
our standards have become
debased. In the context of the
recent climate of accusation and
counter-accusation, it seemed like a
major achievement that the two
leaders could even talk in a civil
fashion to one another.
Second, the summit somehow
was redefined so that it was no
longer concerned with global prob
lems but with the personal
encounter, even combat, between
the two leaders. ("Did Reagan win
or did Gorbachev?" the KTVU
newscaster asked panel of
"experts.") Thus we were encour
aged to ask not whether the summit
solved any major problems, but
whether our player put up a good
performance.

Finally, the summit seemed suc
cessful because it was treated by
the politicians and the media as a
symbolic event — one where
words mattered more than deeds.
This is the transformation of politics
which Reagan and Gorbachev, with
their careful attention to style and
image, have brought about. Now,
to say that nuclear weapons must
be cut becomes as politically satis
fying as actually cutting them, and
we assume that the summit must
have been historic and important
because Reagan, using the magical
power of words, tells us it was.
As a symbolic carnival, the sum
mit was a great success: Both
leaders were seen to be able to
smile, to shake hands, to have good
manners and to be able to answer
questions (at least after they were
explained). As an attempt to solve
perilous global problems, the sum
mit was a tragic, but not unex
pected, failure.
Those of us who care about arms
control find ourselves in a strange
situation. We have long pushed for a
resumption of serious dialogue be
tween the two superpowers, and it
was the insistent strength of the
freeze movement which largely
caused the summit to occur. And
yet the very dialogue we pressed
for, even when it produces nothing
of substance, is celebrated as a suc
cess by the media and used by the
weapon-makers to lull the public
into a false sense of security. Until
we find a way of separating the
politics of symbolism from the
politics of substance in the public
debate, we will continue to be vul
nerable to the infuriating ability of
those in power to use our ideals to
legitimize the continuation of busi
ness as usual.
