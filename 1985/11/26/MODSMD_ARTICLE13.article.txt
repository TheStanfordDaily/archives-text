Bus Drivers
Threaten Safety
This letter is to serve as both a
complaint and a warning about the
dangerously aggressive way in
which the Marguerite buses are
driven. I have repeatedly observed
the buses traveling at speeds
which, if they did not exceed the
limit, were clearly unsafe under
the circumstances. Furthermore,
at intersections, I have seen the
buses either take off out of turn, or
assert their right to turn at the risk
of hurting others in the intersec
tion. The explanation seems to be
a structural one: In a seat that
places them above both bicycles
and cars and in an oversized van
that can pass over seven-inch-high
obstacles, the Marguerite drivers
are able to compensate for their
basic psychological insecurities.

This would all seem trivial, even
humorous, if it were not for the
very real dangers involved. The
view from high up in the seat of
the power bus may be quite differ
ent after a pedestrian or a bicyclist
has been killed or permanently
disabled. Similarities between the
attitudes of the drivers and the
attitudes of the Stanford police
toward the community they
"serve" are not hard to find.

Uncalled for
An explanation is merited from
the Stanford Axe Committee re
garding an incident that occurred
following Big Game. A committee

member chased and accosted a
UC-Berkeley rooter. He then
returned to where the Axe Com
mittee was standing, and he and
four other members sprinted after
the same Cal rooter, surrounded
him, picked him up, and then
dropped him on the ground. They
stood over him until several
bystanders were able to pull them
away. Later in the day, I asked an
Axe Committee member what
happened, and he answered that
the Cal rooter had spit on the axe.
In my mind, physical means are
hardly justified, especially in such a
trivial case as this. So, my ques
tion to the Axe Committee, an
organzation that is supposed to
promote "school spirit," is: Since
when is expectorating saliva
deserving of gratuitous physical
abuse?
