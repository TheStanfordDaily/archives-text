# It's Time To Give Thanks
## 
### 
In two days, it will be Thanksgiving. Thankgiving
brings a number of different thoughts to mind: the idea
of appreciating all that we have, the traditional turkey
dinner, vacation from school, the history of the early
settlers and even the grim prospect that all of the male
members of the family will be watching football games
all day on TV.
Here are some of my perspectives on Thanksgiving
and on giving thanks to others:
Throughout the ages, religions have grappled with
the question of whether the thought is more important
than the deed. Some religions emphasize action more
than others. To me, Thanksgiving is a great holiday (in
part) because it has become a secular tradition. There
is something very universal about giving thanks for our
good fortune. The fact that Thanksgiving transcends
religious differences reflects its importance.

The Career Planning and Placement Center (CPPC)
here at Stanford encourages students to write thank
you notes to prospective employers after job inter
views as a sign of both interest and appreciation. That
this is a good idea goes without saying.

What I fear, however, is that too many other thank
yous (in areas where self-interest is not of concern) go
without saying. For example, after professors offer
recommendations for jobs or graduate programs, they
have performed their service and it would be easy to
forget about writing them a thank you note. To sides
tep a thank you is not a sin, but it is not very con
siderate or polite, either.
Personally, I do not think it takes very much effort
to conceive of a nice thought. I am impressed when
people make an effort to express their appreciation
openly; I am less than impressed when they don't.
On a less formal level than the thank you note, it
seems to me that there is a lot of room for appreciation
to flow more freely in our daily affairs. People routinely
get served by library staff, post office employees and
food service personnel (to name a few) without hinting
in the slightest way that they are grateful for the ser
vice they receive. This is, to say the least, very disap
pointing.

The principle of showing appreciation extends to
every level of human interaction. Budweiser, the beer
with the largest share of the domestic market, uses the

advertising slogan, "This Bud's For You." In
commercials, they salute and applaud people irirall
walks of life. In a sense, they propose a toast of thinks
to hard-working individuals by saying, "For all you;ilo,
this Bud's for you." \
It comes as not surprise that this advertising cam
paign is so successful. Thank yous come back to yop.

Actions such as not wasting food or energy, recy
cling and picking up litter are all forms of expressing
appreciation, for they reflect the idea that commodities
such as food, glass and clean surroundings
valuable. It is a privilege to partake of the wealth of Hour
society, even in such a basic way as enjoying the 01# of
doors. On some level, others shoulder the of
our wasteful habits. Improving on wasteful habits a
way of showing consideration for others and gratitude
for our fortunate lot. *•

People often rationalize lazy behavior as they gfow
to expect service. To me, this is disrespectful and i&an
abuse of privilege. \

If a person's only impression of Stanford came from
the opinions page of The Daily, one might think that vil
lains and terrorists run this university. It is important
to keep criticisms in perspective. I am critical!of
several of Stanford's policies, but on balance I still am
awed by the quality of the education I have received
here, by the opportunities and facilities available to
use and by the beauty of the campus which we all get
to enjoy every day. :i*tuoi«-n " * «-s»
It seems to me that the overwhelming majority of
students have excellent experiences at Stanford. This
is truly a credit to the administrators, faculty and sup
port staff who dedicate their careers to our education.
In the heat of emotional debate, people who have
strong positions sometimes lose sight of the broader
picture.

Giving thanks for the quality of life and freedom we
enjoy is perhaps the most significant theme of the
Thanksgiving holiday. All of us here are very lucky to
have the opportunity to develop our individual talents
and to have a community filled with people who mean a
great deal to us. When the world is so troubled .by
famine, poverty and terrorism, and when we hear
about how a volcanic eruption so suddenly left over
20,000 people dead, we should feel particularly for
tunate for our well-being.

As a final thought, I would like to take the opportu
nity to thank all of you who read these columns, for
me, it is tremendously satisfying to share my ideas,
and I appreciate it a great deal when people take time
to reflect upon what I write.
Have a Happy Thanksgiving!
