### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
Public opinion of the American
media's credibility has fallen to an
all-time low because of the press'
tendency toward sensationalism,
arrogance and attacks on the gov
ernment, the U.S. ambassador to
Mexico told about 150 students in a
Communications 1 class here yes
terday.
John Gavin, a Stanford graduate,
said the popularity the U.S. press
enjoys with the American people
has plummeted, with journalists
now ranked alongside politicians at
the bottom of the public opinion
scale. He added that the press no
longer reflects the opinions of the
average citizen.
"By setting itself up against the
government, especially the presi

ferent its interests and values can
be from those of the public," Gavin
said.
"The overriding concern of the
(press) moralizers is that they must
serve as a check on government
abuse. This goal surely is admira

time, however, they argue that
journalists must maintain unham

pered access to official information,
autonomy in the selection and
protection of sources, and virtual
immunity from libel. Here we part
company."
Gavin read the First Amendment
to the U.S. Constitution, which
guarantees freedom of the press,
and then quoted Norman Isaacs,
chairman of the National News
Council, saying, "If the press fails
to make changes to remedy its
declining credibility, an open attack
on the First Amendment by the end
of the century wouldn't surprise me
at all."
He called the First Amendment
"a cornerstone of our free society,"
but added that the press has abused
its right to operate outside the
scrutiny of the government.
"Many defenders of press
freedoms insist that the press does
not maintain a professional level of
responsibility through its own
governance, but that whether it
does or not, it is not the role of the
government to judge that. In fact, it
is not even for the people to judge,"
Gavin said.
"This position has created
resentments in our society. It is
seen by many as rank and arrogant
