## BUG ME 
### ANDREW McCLUNG Staff writer 
As Thanksgiving draws near
and students everywhere
can frantically spend their
"leisure vacation time" trying
desperately to catch up in all
their classes, I think you all
should keep in mind the many
things for which you can be
thankful.
First on the list could well be
that this is the last of these
columns you will see until next
year.
The Stanford University logo
says that the University was
"Organized in 1891." Isn't that
false? Stanford was organized in
1885 with the Enabling Act and
the Founding Grant, and the
University opened in 1891. Why
does the logo say otherwise? Who
designed it? Will it be changed? -
Mary Yuh
Mary, you may be taken aback
to find that this response will an
swer none of those questions.
Why am I writing about it,
then, you ask? Because none of
the people I called to find out
about other questions this week
were ever in their offices, nor

did they return my calls.
There are quite a few dis
tinctly different Stanford seals in
existence, and certain of them
are used by certain offices, to
the exclusion of all others. Fur
thermore, these offices jealously
guard their respective seals as
the official Stanford seal, and are
constantly warring with the
petty fiefdoms of other adminis
trative offices to assert the
supremacy of the One True
Seal.

The latter mythical entity,
which is the Platonic ideal of a
Universtiy logo, periodically
visits the physical world in the
incarnation of an ordinary insig
nia, and vanquishes the infidel
logos while granting deliverance
to the pure of logo heart and
spirit.
The zealous University ar
chives staff, once again cour

teously bailing me out, can
deliver you from the foregoing
rhetoric. The staff found an arti
cle in the Stanford Alumni
Review of February 1947 dis
cussing the variety of extant
seals. You have noticed that,
despite minor differences in the
tree, the background and the use
of the Die Luft der Freiheit weht
motto, the word "organized" is
common to all but the Board of
Trustees' version.
You are perfectly correct in
characterizing the use of
"Organized 1891" as perfectly
incorrect. Roxanne Nilan, Uni
versity archives curator, des
cribed it as "meaningless,"
which it is. Obviously,
"organized" is too nebulous a
term to make any sense; better
to have said "Founded 1885" or •
"Opened 1891", which, as you
have astutely pointed out, are •
both true and accurate state-;!
ments.
But Mary, nobody on God's>
green Earth seems to know who*.;
bears the blame for initiating the; •
use of the inaccurate logo term,; I
and no one seems able to stop its;!
use, either. Perhaps your ques-';
tion will set the winds of change!;
a-blowing, and then again, per-!;
haps not.
