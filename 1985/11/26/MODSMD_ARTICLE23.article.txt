## 'Gaieties' Continues Big Game Tradition 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
What can you say about a show
that uses voice-overs of University
President Donald Kennedy for its
denouement, gleefully drops a
single-entendre sexual innuendo at
every opportunity it gets, and
whose main redeeming feature is a
deus ex machina?
Well, you can say a great deal of
things about a show like that and
get virtually nowhere, because
criticizing "Gaieties" is like letter
bombing Mister Rogers — it'll
crawl out of the ashes and go on its
merry way.
For those of you who are among

the uninitiated, "Gaieties" is sort of
a -satire dressed in a musical's cloth
ing put on every year by Ram's
Head as an incentive for spirit at the
Big Game. (We're not talking lofty
esthetic ambitions here.)
Whether this year's show
(entitled "Poltergaieties") had any
thing to do with the trouncing the
Cardinal gave the Golden Bears on
Saturday in Stanford Stadium is
open to debate, but it may as well
have. The writers of the show cer
tainly trounced every subject they
could get their hands on.
Director Jeff Schneider,
producer Hope Seligson and writ
ers John Fernandes and Bart Man
ning put together a story that was
at once hilarious and hokey, and
went something like the following:
It is the eve of Big Game, and a
troupe of Weenies from across the

Bay are trying to sabotage the
prospects of another Stanford win
by kidnapping the Band, and gener
ally doing whatever else they can
do to turn the Stanford campus into
a den of chaos. A denizen named
Jim, described as "a clueless frosh"
in the program (played in an appro
priately ordinary fashion by Vance
Cooney), falls in love with a "bitch"
from Berkeley named Karla
(Chanelle Schaffer), who has been
given the single-handed assignment
of doing the Band heist. Meanwhile,
a "nice girl" named Mary Ann (Lisa
Larragoite) who works as a tour
guide, a library page, a food service
hasher and a Daily reporter
("financial aid just doesn't go very
far") and who is desperately in love

with Jim, spends the entire play
trying to convince Jim of Karla's evil
designs.
While this love triangle is shaping
up, we find that the annual Hallo
ween party at the Mausoleum has
disinterred the ghosts of the Leland
Stanford family, which are now
strolling around the campus with all
the curiosity and amazement of
anybody transported a century into
the future. The rub is that the Stan
fords will bollix the victory of the
Cardinal in all future Big Games if
they aren't swept back into their
tombs by midnight on the eve of
this year's match.
This, then, is the plot, in all its
threadbare nakedness. But since
finding someone who makes a habit
of seeing "Gaieties" every year for
the intricacy of its plot or the
beauty of its artistry is next to

impossible, it is unfair to review the
production in those terms.
In terms of the commodity it sold
— fun — this year's production was
more than adequate and frequently
shone with moments of true com
edy. The plot was almost an adjunct
to the rest of the show, which was
mostly a series of musical and
satirical romps through fields that
get trampled over and over again
every year, but which, amazingly
enough, nobody ever seems to get
tired of seeing lampooned.
There was, for instance, the
obligatory dig at food service.
Strains of the type of music you are
used to seeing in a Pepto-Bismol
commercial welled up from the or
chestra. Gigantic signs hung from
the stage ceiling with captions
reading "Today's Special: Eggplant
Stackup, Chicken Chalupa."
Mary Ann and her cohorts dribbled
muddy strands of some concoction
or other onto plain paper plates. Jim
walked through the line, mooning
over Karla all the while, and even
tually got up enough nerve to sit
next to her and trade one-liners
with her about the food. Then the
entire stage burst into some sort of
bluesy number reminiscent of the
dance to Pete Seeger's "Old Time
Rock 'n' Roll" in "Risky Business."
The best moments in the show
were those that eschewed the
chronic need to take advantage of
the audience's captive good humor
by tossing in badly written jokes.
One point in the show that was
particularly satisfying was inserted
between satirical tableaus. A Bible
thumping evangelist (none other
than Brother Jim, played by Tim
Millet) had just zapped the Stanford
ghosts into another dimension. Out
of nowhere, a parade of characters
from our cultural grab bag of TV
and pop-fiction crime solvers came
onstage to offer conjectures about
where the ghosts might have been
whisked off to.
Ellery Queen tried his hand at it
first. Then came Charlie Chan.
Columbo. Charlie's Angels.
Ironsides. Sherlock Holmes and
Doctor Watson. There was even a
valley girl Nancy Drew ("The an
swer is soooooo obvious"). About
the only characters missing were
Mannix, Kojak, McCloud, Rockford
and Angie Dickinson as
"Policewoman."
These well-rehearsed character
bits afforded the actors the oppor
tunity to sink their teeth into what
were at least specific roles. Indeed,
it was for the most part these spe
cialized bits of characterization that
kept the production from turning
into a bloated ship of self
congratulatory fools.

On the other hand, the roles that
called for students to act like stu
dents turned out for the most part
to be enormously self-fulfilling. The
ghosts Qohn Nisbet, Margie Morse
and a hipsterized Leland Junior
played by Phil Cannon) gave the
show a well-needed sense of focus
and identity, because they were
playing characters, not ordinary
students. The actors playing
everyday students, unfortunately,
tended to drift in and out of charac
ter while tediously overacting to try
to endow their roles with a sense of
characterization they just didn't
have.
Cooney, when he wasn't singing
in a musical number, was nothing
more than a clueless frosh wander
ing in and out of various tentative
models of what that type of person
should be acted like. Schaffer and
Larragoite were too perfectly
molded into their roles of vixen and
princess prostrate before the phal
lus. The show probably wouldn't
have elicited the same number of
gratifyingly cathartic catcalls from
the audience that it did if it had left
its carpetbag of sexist innuendoes
offstage.
There is no denying that the
show succeeded in its own terms,
far beyond whatever the normal
level of success might be seen as. It
was funny, and several of its evoca
tions of Stanford life managed to

come together in wholes that were
far better than the sum of their
parts. The reconstructions of daily
meanderings in White Plaza, with
the Tutti Fiori woman absent
mindedly twiddling her thumbs and
her greens, the tourists snaking
around asking questions in annoy
ingly whiny tones, were effective,
as was the re-enactment of the
nightly countdown to closing time in
Meyer Library.
The musical numbers that con-

nected the skits together into a
coherent thread were not them
selves uniformly smooth. The
chorus, though lively and enthusias
tic, did not develop a tight reper
toire of technique to carry them
through the production, and thus
served up numbers that were occa
sionally satisfying (the rap number
by the Stanford ghosts and the
dance by the laundry room
prisoners were both particularly
charming) but generally unfocused.

What can you say about a show
that uses voice-overs of University
President Donald Kennedy for its
denouement, gleefully drops a
single-entendre sexual innuendo at
every opportunity it gets, and
whose main redeeming feature is a
deus ex machina?
Well, you can say a great deal of
things about a show like that and
get virtually nowhere, because
criticizing "Gaieties" is like letter
bombing Mister Rogers — it'll
crawl out of the ashes and go on its
merry way.
For those of you who are among

the uninitiated, "Gaieties" is sort of
a -satire dressed in a musical's cloth
ing put on every year by Ram's
Head as an incentive for spirit at the
Big Game. (We're not talking lofty
esthetic ambitions here.)
Whether this year's show
(entitled "Poltergaieties") had any
thing to do with the trouncing the
Cardinal gave the Golden Bears on
Saturday in Stanford Stadium is
open to debate, but it may as well
have. The writers of the show cer
tainly trounced every subject they
could get their hands on.
Director Jeff Schneider,
producer Hope Seligson and writ
ers John Fernandes and Bart Man
ning put together a story that was
at once hilarious and hokey, and
went something like the following:
It is the eve of Big Game, and a
troupe of Weenies from across the

Bay are trying to sabotage the
prospects of another Stanford win
by kidnapping the Band, and gener
ally doing whatever else they can
do to turn the Stanford campus into
a den of chaos. A denizen named
Jim, described as "a clueless frosh"
in the program (played in an appro
priately ordinary fashion by Vance
Cooney), falls in love with a "bitch"
from Berkeley named Karla
(Chanelle Schaffer), who has been
given the single-handed assignment
of doing the Band heist. Meanwhile,
a "nice girl" named Mary Ann (Lisa
Larragoite) who works as a tour
guide, a library page, a food service
hasher and a Daily reporter
("financial aid just doesn't go very
far") and who is desperately in love

with Jim, spends the entire play
trying to convince Jim of Karla's evil
designs.
While this love triangle is shaping
up, we find that the annual Hallo
ween party at the Mausoleum has
disinterred the ghosts of the Leland
Stanford family, which are now
strolling around the campus with all
the curiosity and amazement of
anybody transported a century into
the future. The rub is that the Stan
fords will bollix the victory of the
Cardinal in all future Big Games if
they aren't swept back into their
tombs by midnight on the eve of
this year's match.
This, then, is the plot, in all its
threadbare nakedness. But since
finding someone who makes a habit
of seeing "Gaieties" every year for
the intricacy of its plot or the
beauty of its artistry is next to

impossible, it is unfair to review the
production in those terms.
In terms of the commodity it sold
— fun — this year's production was
more than adequate and frequently
shone with moments of true com
edy. The plot was almost an adjunct
to the rest of the show, which was
mostly a series of musical and
satirical romps through fields that
get trampled over and over again
every year, but which, amazingly
enough, nobody ever seems to get
tired of seeing lampooned.
There was, for instance, the
obligatory dig at food service.
Strains of the type of music you are
used to seeing in a Pepto-Bismol
commercial welled up from the or
chestra. Gigantic signs hung from
the stage ceiling with captions
reading "Today's Special: Eggplant
Stackup, Chicken Chalupa."
Mary Ann and her cohorts dribbled
muddy strands of some concoction
or other onto plain paper plates. Jim
walked through the line, mooning
over Karla all the while, and even
tually got up enough nerve to sit
next to her and trade one-liners
with her about the food. Then the
entire stage burst into some sort of
bluesy number reminiscent of the
dance to Pete Seeger's "Old Time
Rock 'n' Roll" in "Risky Business."
The best moments in the show
were those that eschewed the
chronic need to take advantage of
the audience's captive good humor
by tossing in badly written jokes.
One point in the show that was
particularly satisfying was inserted
between satirical tableaus. A Bible
thumping evangelist (none other
than Brother Jim, played by Tim
Millet) had just zapped the Stanford
ghosts into another dimension. Out
of nowhere, a parade of characters
from our cultural grab bag of TV
and pop-fiction crime solvers came
onstage to offer conjectures about
where the ghosts might have been
whisked off to.
Ellery Queen tried his hand at it
first. Then came Charlie Chan.
Columbo. Charlie's Angels.
Ironsides. Sherlock Holmes and
Doctor Watson. There was even a
valley girl Nancy Drew ("The an
swer is soooooo obvious"). About
the only characters missing were
Mannix, Kojak, McCloud, Rockford
and Angie Dickinson as
"Policewoman."
These well-rehearsed character
bits afforded the actors the oppor
tunity to sink their teeth into what
were at least specific roles. Indeed,
it was for the most part these spe
cialized bits of characterization that
kept the production from turning
into a bloated ship of self
congratulatory fools.

On the other hand, the roles that
called for students to act like stu
dents turned out for the most part
to be enormously self-fulfilling. The
ghosts Qohn Nisbet, Margie Morse
and a hipsterized Leland Junior
played by Phil Cannon) gave the
show a well-needed sense of focus
and identity, because they were
playing characters, not ordinary
students. The actors playing
everyday students, unfortunately,
tended to drift in and out of charac
ter while tediously overacting to try
to endow their roles with a sense of
characterization they just didn't
have.
Cooney, when he wasn't singing
in a musical number, was nothing
more than a clueless frosh wander
ing in and out of various tentative
models of what that type of person
should be acted like. Schaffer and
Larragoite were too perfectly
molded into their roles of vixen and
princess prostrate before the phal
lus. The show probably wouldn't
have elicited the same number of
gratifyingly cathartic catcalls from
the audience that it did if it had left
its carpetbag of sexist innuendoes
offstage.
There is no denying that the
show succeeded in its own terms,
far beyond whatever the normal
level of success might be seen as. It
was funny, and several of its evoca
tions of Stanford life managed to

come together in wholes that were
far better than the sum of their
parts. The reconstructions of daily
meanderings in White Plaza, with
the Tutti Fiori woman absent
mindedly twiddling her thumbs and
her greens, the tourists snaking
around asking questions in annoy
ingly whiny tones, were effective,
as was the re-enactment of the
nightly countdown to closing time in
Meyer Library.
The musical numbers that con-

nected the skits together into a
coherent thread were not them
selves uniformly smooth. The
chorus, though lively and enthusias
tic, did not develop a tight reper
toire of technique to carry them
through the production, and thus
served up numbers that were occa
sionally satisfying (the rap number
by the Stanford ghosts and the
dance by the laundry room
prisoners were both particularly
charming) but generally unfocused.

mindedly twiddling her thumbs and
her greens, the tourists snaking
around asking questions in annoy
ingly whiny tones, were effective,
as was the re-enactment of the
nightly countdown to closing time in
Meyer Library.
The musical numbers that con-

nected the skits together into a
coherent thread were not them
selves uniformly smooth. The
chorus, though lively and enthusias
tic, did not develop a tight reper
toire of technique to carry them
through the production, and thus
served up numbers that were occa
sionally satisfying (the rap number
by the Stanford ghosts and the
dance by the laundry room
prisoners were both particularly
charming) but generally unfocused.


Tim Millet stars as the Bible-thumping Brother Jim, a familiar fig
ure on campus, in "Gaieties," which played to a sold-out
Memorial Auditorium on Friday.
