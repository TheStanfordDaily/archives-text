# 'Rare Area' Presents Rare Dramatic Experience
## 
### LISA LYNCH LEE CLINE 
We hate it when we ask people if they liked some
thing and they tell us we "have to see it." But after
seeing, "Rare Area," which opened on Nov. 15 at San
Fransisco's Theater Artaud, we envisioned ourselves
saying just that to a lot of irritated people. To use some
other trite metaphors, it's a "totally visual experience"
that "defies description." We can't tell you what
"Rare Area" is about; it's not supposed to be "about"
anything. And even though we're not sure whether we
liked it, we're glad we went.
"Rare Area" premiered this spring at the Kaai Fes
tival in Brussels, Belgium, where it had been commis
sioned for performance. It has since played in UC-
Berkeley's Zellerbach Hall and at the Marin Center.
The show is the brainchild of a most unusual theater
company called George Coates Performance Works.
George Coates has been directing peformance theatre
since 1976; his most well-known work prior to
"Rare Area" was "See Hear," which premiered in 1983.
: In "Rare Area," as in Coates' previous shows, opera
singers, actors, mimes and musicians collaborate in
elaborate, high-tech settings; the result is a collage of
light, sound and performance that some reviewers
have compared to a "modern-day Ring series."
! However,"RareArea,'' unlike the Ring, has no
coherent plot structure, and literal-minded viewers
would probably say it just doesn't make "sense.' It
isn't trying. Rather, it's more of a visual assualt.
■Coates barrages us with images and ideas that defy in
terpretation, but because of their provocative nature,
Jeave us feeling like we maybe didn't get the joke.
There are four "performers" on the stage: opera
singers John Duykers and Katya Roemer, movement
artist Hitomi Ikuma and actor Sean Kilcoyne. Duykers
and Roemer are continually on stage; when they aren t
acting roles, they provide a "commentary" on the ac
tion, singing uniformly undecipherable phrases.
Coates' idea of action is to heap scene upon uncon
nected scene — most of them beautiful, some of them
disturbing, some forgettable. Coates claims he
chooses his material to be "more evocative than
provacative," but there are unmistakable political illu
sions — flags, footballs and Vietnam references.
' A good word to describe the sequencing of events

and actions on Coates' stages is "non-linear;" though
the first and last scenes have overtones of opening and
closure, the stuff that goes on in the middle could prob
ably be jiggled and mixed up a bit without any palpable
effect on the overall experience. In one sense this is all
well and good; we started to think of "Rare Area" as a
free-form caberet experience, a troupe of performers
going through routines that were intended to interest
us separately. But then we got the feeling that there
should be some type of structure in "Rare Area;" either
the structure was there and we couldn't find it, or
something needed was lacking.
Of the two interacting elements in "Rare Area" —
sound and vision — we think we wanted the aural part
of the show to give it shape. For some reason the ran
dom events and scenes on the stages reminded us of
"Koyaanisqatsi;" in this movie, a "silent" visual experi
ence is coupled with a wordless soundtrack that gives
it a structure. We hoped that Marc Ream's "wordless"
opera singers in "Rare Area" could do the same thing
for Coates' production that Glass' soundtrack did for
"Koyaanisqatsi," but they came up short.

Their music, which has been described as
"minimalist and tonal," was monotonous in many places
and simply incorrect in others. They would build up a
climax where we didn't think a climax was needed,
return to the same "chants" when new themes should
have been brought in. Most importantly, there were a
lot of times when what you heard just didn't seem to
match up with what you saw, almost as if Coates forgot
to sync his slides with the music. These moments
were few, but they made us want to plug up our ears.
Even if our ears want to tune out, or feel out-of
tune, there are infinite visual puzzles to delight us,
redirect our attention and distract us from that
"search for meaning" that detracts from our enjoyment
of drearier moodern things. One of the repeated tricks
Coates uses is to allow tension to build while the mind
tries to figure out exactly what the eyes is seeing. As
the show begins, the performers are swaying in
"space," seeming to float and twirl in mid air while they
chant their ethereal music. Light — and the absence of
light — is the principle control Coates uses to create
his effects; it breaks down the solidity of his charac

ters, makes the visible invisible and continually dis
torts our perspective; there are "stairs" on the stage
that become a ramp, unlit platforms that allow
characters to float and shifting patterns of light that
animate inanimate bodies.
The "movement" is performed by mime Hitomi
Ikuma and is one of the most innovative, intriguing
aspects of the show. At one moment Ikuma literally
dangles above the stage by a thread; at another she is
involved in an impossible struggle to scale a towering
skyscraper. She is equally facile in her expression of
pain and of beauty, providing respectively wrenching
and eloquent metaphors for these emotions.
The "actor," Sean Kilcoyne, is a naturalistic contrast
to the three other ephemeral figures; he is the human
being, or, pushed further, he is Everyman. Coates
uses Kilcoyne to lash out blatantly against his pet
peeves: mindless patriotism and the influence of mass
media. In several scenes, where Kilcoyne gives verbal
(coherent) commmentary on "television" slides, his
rambling remarks are alternately humorous and galling;
we wonder if Coates' script is sporadically missing the
mark. Judging from the tightness of the rest of Coates'
direction, however, his ramblings are probably inten
tional; though his awkwardness makes us wince, it
also provides a contrast to the hairline manipulation of
the rest of the performance.
The scenic design, by Jerome Stirlin, is a dazzling
visual experience, the most immediately striking
aspect of the show. Against backdrops layered on the
stage, and a semi-transparent screen placed between
the stage and the audience, slides are projected to
make environments. Roman columns, modern
skyscrapers and formless "settings" all flash onto the
screens and are changed at any given moment, reflect
ing the transitory character of the performance. Slides
projected from the wings onto performers' bodies are
spectacular explorations in movement and expression.
There are occasional strange, unidentifiable props
floating around such as certain "globes" that move like
jelly and collide and bounce all over the stage. These
images take us out of the theater and into areas of im
agery that could only otherwise exist in the mind. This
is the magic of Coates' imagery — it transcends the
stage and makes a world of its own; what to make of
this new world, however, is up to the viewer.

Their music, which has been described as
"minimalist and tonal," was monotonous in many places
and simply incorrect in others. They would build up a
climax where we didn't think a climax was needed,
return to the same "chants" when new themes should
have been brought in. Most importantly, there were a
lot of times when what you heard just didn't seem to
match up with what you saw, almost as if Coates forgot
to sync his slides with the music. These moments
were few, but they made us want to plug up our ears.
Even if our ears want to tune out, or feel out-of
tune, there are infinite visual puzzles to delight us,
redirect our attention and distract us from that
"search for meaning" that detracts from our enjoyment
of drearier moodern things. One of the repeated tricks
Coates uses is to allow tension to build while the mind
tries to figure out exactly what the eyes is seeing. As
the show begins, the performers are swaying in
"space," seeming to float and twirl in mid air while they
chant their ethereal music. Light — and the absence of
light — is the principle control Coates uses to create
his effects; it breaks down the solidity of his charac

ters, makes the visible invisible and continually dis
torts our perspective; there are "stairs" on the stage
that become a ramp, unlit platforms that allow
characters to float and shifting patterns of light that
animate inanimate bodies.
The "movement" is performed by mime Hitomi
Ikuma and is one of the most innovative, intriguing
aspects of the show. At one moment Ikuma literally
dangles above the stage by a thread; at another she is
involved in an impossible struggle to scale a towering
skyscraper. She is equally facile in her expression of
pain and of beauty, providing respectively wrenching
and eloquent metaphors for these emotions.
The "actor," Sean Kilcoyne, is a naturalistic contrast
to the three other ephemeral figures; he is the human
being, or, pushed further, he is Everyman. Coates
uses Kilcoyne to lash out blatantly against his pet
peeves: mindless patriotism and the influence of mass
media. In several scenes, where Kilcoyne gives verbal
(coherent) commmentary on "television" slides, his
rambling remarks are alternately humorous and galling;
we wonder if Coates' script is sporadically missing the
mark. Judging from the tightness of the rest of Coates'
direction, however, his ramblings are probably inten
tional; though his awkwardness makes us wince, it
also provides a contrast to the hairline manipulation of
the rest of the performance.
The scenic design, by Jerome Stirlin, is a dazzling
visual experience, the most immediately striking
aspect of the show. Against backdrops layered on the
stage, and a semi-transparent screen placed between
the stage and the audience, slides are projected to
make environments. Roman columns, modern
skyscrapers and formless "settings" all flash onto the
screens and are changed at any given moment, reflect
ing the transitory character of the performance. Slides
projected from the wings onto performers' bodies are
spectacular explorations in movement and expression.
There are occasional strange, unidentifiable props
floating around such as certain "globes" that move like
jelly and collide and bounce all over the stage. These
images take us out of the theater and into areas of im
agery that could only otherwise exist in the mind. This
is the magic of Coates' imagery — it transcends the
stage and makes a world of its own; what to make of
this new world, however, is up to the viewer.


Sean Kilcoyne and John Duykers participate in "Rare Area," an experimental play presented by
the George Coates Performance Works at Theater Artaud.
We hate it when we ask people if they liked some
thing and they tell us we "have to see it." But after
seeing, "Rare Area," which opened on Nov. 15 at San
Fransisco's Theater Artaud, we envisioned ourselves
saying just that to a lot of irritated people. To use some
other trite metaphors, it's a "totally visual experience"
that "defies description." We can't tell you what
"Rare Area" is about; it's not supposed to be "about"
anything. And even though we're not sure whether we
liked it, we're glad we went.
"Rare Area" premiered this spring at the Kaai Fes
tival in Brussels, Belgium, where it had been commis
sioned for performance. It has since played in UC-
Berkeley's Zellerbach Hall and at the Marin Center.
The show is the brainchild of a most unusual theater
company called George Coates Performance Works.
George Coates has been directing peformance theatre
since 1976; his most well-known work prior to
"Rare Area" was "See Hear," which premiered in 1983.
: In "Rare Area," as in Coates' previous shows, opera
singers, actors, mimes and musicians collaborate in
elaborate, high-tech settings; the result is a collage of
light, sound and performance that some reviewers
have compared to a "modern-day Ring series."
! However,"RareArea,'' unlike the Ring, has no
coherent plot structure, and literal-minded viewers
would probably say it just doesn't make "sense.' It
isn't trying. Rather, it's more of a visual assualt.
■Coates barrages us with images and ideas that defy in
terpretation, but because of their provocative nature,
Jeave us feeling like we maybe didn't get the joke.
There are four "performers" on the stage: opera
singers John Duykers and Katya Roemer, movement
artist Hitomi Ikuma and actor Sean Kilcoyne. Duykers
and Roemer are continually on stage; when they aren t
acting roles, they provide a "commentary" on the ac
tion, singing uniformly undecipherable phrases.
Coates' idea of action is to heap scene upon uncon
nected scene — most of them beautiful, some of them
disturbing, some forgettable. Coates claims he
chooses his material to be "more evocative than
provacative," but there are unmistakable political illu
sions — flags, footballs and Vietnam references.
' A good word to describe the sequencing of events

and actions on Coates' stages is "non-linear;" though
the first and last scenes have overtones of opening and
closure, the stuff that goes on in the middle could prob
ably be jiggled and mixed up a bit without any palpable
effect on the overall experience. In one sense this is all
well and good; we started to think of "Rare Area" as a
free-form caberet experience, a troupe of performers
going through routines that were intended to interest
us separately. But then we got the feeling that there
should be some type of structure in "Rare Area;" either
the structure was there and we couldn't find it, or
something needed was lacking.
Of the two interacting elements in "Rare Area" —
sound and vision — we think we wanted the aural part
of the show to give it shape. For some reason the ran
dom events and scenes on the stages reminded us of
"Koyaanisqatsi;" in this movie, a "silent" visual experi
ence is coupled with a wordless soundtrack that gives
it a structure. We hoped that Marc Ream's "wordless"
opera singers in "Rare Area" could do the same thing
for Coates' production that Glass' soundtrack did for
"Koyaanisqatsi," but they came up short.
