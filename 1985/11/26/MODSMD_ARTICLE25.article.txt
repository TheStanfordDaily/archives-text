# Beckett and Shepard: A Winning Combination
## 
### MARK TOMPKINS Staff writer 
Theater repertories, like politics,
make for strange bedfellows. Con
sider the unlikely combination of
Samuel Beckett and Sam Shepard
currently on display in the Nitery.
Beckett is of course best known for
"Waiting For Godot," the play
which startled the world 30 years
ago with its radical innovations.
Shepard, meanwhile, is the rising
siar of modern American theater:
his powerful "True West" ethos
recently put him on the cover of
Newsweek, and his upcoming film
"Fool For Love" is likely to make
him even more famous.
The Stanford Drama Department
is offering Shepard's "Action" and
Beckett's "Theatre 2" together in
the Nitery. The Shepard play is
presented first, perhaps because it
is the more accessible of the two
dramas. For anyone unfamiliar with
Shepard's work, "Action" is an ex
cellent introduction: it is smart,
funny and original. As in many of his
other plays, Shepard here sets his

characters adrift in a sort of mythi
cal modern Midwest, where the
wide, empty spaces drive people to
the brink of insanity and violence.
(In this respect it's easy to see why
Bruce Springsteen's lyrics are often
compared to Shepard's dramas.)
The players in "Action" are dirt
poor farmers. The two men, Jeep
(Gregory Hoffman) and Shooter
(Tom Williams), are inarticulate and
angry; violent impulses seem to
motivate their every action. The
women, Liza (Leslie Darwin) and
Lupe (Mary Poindexter), are more
easygoing, if only because their
lives are submerged in the day-to
day routine of domestic tasks.
None of them have much education;
reading a book is a struggle for all
four of them, and all live in worlds
of their own, never really communi
cating with each other.
Although these characters might
be considered stupid, that does not
mean that they are uninteresting.
In fact, they create an absorbing
and weirdly compelling group.
Hoffman and Williams shine as Jeep
and Shooter: their strong stage

presences belie the anger lurking
beneath the surfaces of their char
acters. Williams in particular uses
his body to good effect both in his
hilarious "dancing bear" impression
and when standing on top of a chair.
Darwin and Poindexter are given
less to do as Liza and Lupe, but this
may be Shepard's point, that the
men in this tough society will
naturally overshadow the women.
The minimalist approach taken
by set designer John Wilson is par
ticularly effective in the Shepard
piece. The only adornment onstage
is a measly little Christmas tree,
the lights of which blink on and off
incessantly. At the end of the play,

Liza and Lupe start hanging up
clothes on a line which stretches off
into the darkness, and it's an ex
tremely effective part of the set.
The two women exit by hanging up
clothes on this line which seems to
stretch on forever, so one gets the
impression that Liza and Lupe will
never be finished with their dreary
chores.
And then there is Beckett's
cryptically titled "Theatre 2." The
play's scenario may sound absurd,
but this could well be Beckett's in
tention. A silent, unmoving man
(Gregory Hoffman again) stands by
the window in a darkened room,
seemingly about to commit suicide

by jumping out the window. Two
official looking figures (lan Cum
mings and Jeff Schwamberger) en
ter the room and discuss the life of
the Hoffman character, judging
whether or not he should kill him
self. Or more correctly, they sum
up the Hoffman character's life, and
they never really make any deci
sions about his suicide, but instead
try to finish their business as
quickly as possible.
Beckett is treading his favorite
territory here. The character
played by Hoffman finds the absur
dity and chaos of modern living too
much to bear. We learn that previ
ously he had reacted against his
surroundings by indulging in odd,
erratic behavior, but now, his con
sciousness of the fact that he is con
scious weighs him down. The two
officials who discuss his predica
ment may (and this is only a sug
gestion) be products of his own im
agination, for they are certainly em
blematic of the rational bureaucracy
he seems to dislike.
As the two officials, Jeff
Schwamberger and lan Cummings
play off one another with great skill.

Their roles are complementary, as
Schwamberger is relaxed and
assured as the more smooth-talking
of the two officials, while Cum
mings delivers a performance of
crazed anxiety as the panicky junior
member of the pair. Cummings'
entrance is an uproarious parody of
a jittery bureaucrat: carrying a
preposterous number of files and
papers, all his motions are so
speeded-up they seem more
cartoon-like than real. Director Jar
rett Walker's casting choices are
extremely shrewd, for the relation
ship struck between Schawm
berger and Cummings gives Beck
ett's work its humanity.
In the end the pairing of Shepard
and Beckett is not the unworkable
marriage it might first seem. Both
playwrights voice humane concerns
in a challenging manner, and under
the finely-honed direction of Jarrett
Walker, "Action" and "Theatre 2"
work well together. At least it
seems unlikely that any fans •of
Shepard will walk out on the Be
ckett play, and equally unlikely that
any Beckett admirers will object to
Shepard's work.

he seems to dislike.
As the two officials, Jeff
Schwamberger and lan Cummings
play off one another with great skill.

Their roles are complementary, as
Schwamberger is relaxed and
assured as the more smooth-talking
of the two officials, while Cum
mings delivers a performance of
crazed anxiety as the panicky junior
member of the pair. Cummings'
entrance is an uproarious parody of
a jittery bureaucrat: carrying a
preposterous number of files and
papers, all his motions are so
speeded-up they seem more
cartoon-like than real. Director Jar
rett Walker's casting choices are
extremely shrewd, for the relation
ship struck between Schawm
berger and Cummings gives Beck
ett's work its humanity.
In the end the pairing of Shepard
and Beckett is not the unworkable
marriage it might first seem. Both
playwrights voice humane concerns
in a challenging manner, and under
the finely-honed direction of Jarrett
Walker, "Action" and "Theatre 2"
work well together. At least it
seems unlikely that any fans •of
Shepard will walk out on the Be
ckett play, and equally unlikely that
any Beckett admirers will object to
Shepard's work.

Theater repertories, like politics,
make for strange bedfellows. Con
sider the unlikely combination of
Samuel Beckett and Sam Shepard
currently on display in the Nitery.
Beckett is of course best known for
"Waiting For Godot," the play
which startled the world 30 years
ago with its radical innovations.
Shepard, meanwhile, is the rising
siar of modern American theater:
his powerful "True West" ethos
recently put him on the cover of
Newsweek, and his upcoming film
"Fool For Love" is likely to make
him even more famous.
The Stanford Drama Department
is offering Shepard's "Action" and
Beckett's "Theatre 2" together in
the Nitery. The Shepard play is
presented first, perhaps because it
is the more accessible of the two
dramas. For anyone unfamiliar with
Shepard's work, "Action" is an ex
cellent introduction: it is smart,
funny and original. As in many of his
other plays, Shepard here sets his

characters adrift in a sort of mythi
cal modern Midwest, where the
wide, empty spaces drive people to
the brink of insanity and violence.
(In this respect it's easy to see why
Bruce Springsteen's lyrics are often
compared to Shepard's dramas.)
The players in "Action" are dirt
poor farmers. The two men, Jeep
(Gregory Hoffman) and Shooter
(Tom Williams), are inarticulate and
angry; violent impulses seem to
motivate their every action. The
women, Liza (Leslie Darwin) and
Lupe (Mary Poindexter), are more
easygoing, if only because their
lives are submerged in the day-to
day routine of domestic tasks.
None of them have much education;
reading a book is a struggle for all
four of them, and all live in worlds
of their own, never really communi
cating with each other.
Although these characters might
be considered stupid, that does not
mean that they are uninteresting.
In fact, they create an absorbing
and weirdly compelling group.
Hoffman and Williams shine as Jeep
and Shooter: their strong stage

presences belie the anger lurking
beneath the surfaces of their char
acters. Williams in particular uses
his body to good effect both in his
hilarious "dancing bear" impression
and when standing on top of a chair.
Darwin and Poindexter are given
less to do as Liza and Lupe, but this
may be Shepard's point, that the
men in this tough society will
naturally overshadow the women.
The minimalist approach taken
by set designer John Wilson is par
ticularly effective in the Shepard
piece. The only adornment onstage
is a measly little Christmas tree,
the lights of which blink on and off
incessantly. At the end of the play,

Liza and Lupe start hanging up
clothes on a line which stretches off
into the darkness, and it's an ex
tremely effective part of the set.
The two women exit by hanging up
clothes on this line which seems to
stretch on forever, so one gets the
impression that Liza and Lupe will
never be finished with their dreary
chores.
And then there is Beckett's
cryptically titled "Theatre 2." The
play's scenario may sound absurd,
but this could well be Beckett's in
tention. A silent, unmoving man
(Gregory Hoffman again) stands by
the window in a darkened room,
seemingly about to commit suicide

by jumping out the window. Two
official looking figures (lan Cum
mings and Jeff Schwamberger) en
ter the room and discuss the life of
the Hoffman character, judging
whether or not he should kill him
self. Or more correctly, they sum
up the Hoffman character's life, and
they never really make any deci
sions about his suicide, but instead
try to finish their business as
quickly as possible.
Beckett is treading his favorite
territory here. The character
played by Hoffman finds the absur
dity and chaos of modern living too
much to bear. We learn that previ
ously he had reacted against his
surroundings by indulging in odd,
erratic behavior, but now, his con
sciousness of the fact that he is con
scious weighs him down. The two
officials who discuss his predica
ment may (and this is only a sug
gestion) be products of his own im
agination, for they are certainly em
blematic of the rational bureaucracy
he seems to dislike.
