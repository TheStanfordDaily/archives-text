# 'Jeeves Takes Charge' of a Delightful Production
## 
### PETER MORGAN Staff writer 
If you want to have a hilariously enter
taining evening of British comedy, go and
see "Jeeves Takes Charge" at the Marines
Memorial Theatre. The one-man show,
which stars Edward Duke, is an adaptation
of several P.G. Wodehouse plays, and it is
just great. Wodehouse wrote a plethora of
zesty comedies before he died in 1975, and
is known, like Noel Coward and George
Bernard Shaw, for his witty portrayals of
English society during the '20s and '30s.
It is a tour de force for Duke, who plays a

dozen different characters. Duke slips from
personality to personality in telling highly
amusing stories about the two "main" char
acters: Bertie Wooster and his butler,
Jeeves. Wooster is a well-to-do British
er who is completely incapable of taking
care of himself, and Jeeves is the quintes
sential English butler who can, and does,
take care of everything.
The first of the three main stories is told
by Wooster and involves his dilemma when
his uncle decides to write a book containing
"embarrassing" moments in his nephew's
life. Faced with a threat from a prudish fian
cee of breaking off the engagement unless
the uncle is stopped, Bertie proceeds to go

through a hilarious series of ploys to save
himself from amorous discord. Suffice to
say that in the end Jeeves takes care of the
situation with dignity and honor.
For the second "story," Duke changes to
the character of Jeeves as the storyteller.
This adventure involves Bertie's encounter
with a girls school, and is the highlight of the
show. Duke's rapid transitions from Jeeves
to Bertie to the headmistress to one of the
students and back again to Jeeves are
remarkable, to say nothing of uproarious.
Thus ends the first half of the show. The
second half focuses on just one story, but a
real "shaggy dog" one that starts with
Bertie describing the ultimate bane of all

fun-loving youths: aunts. From here he is
corraled into a speech for his aunt's garden
party, which reminds him of another garden
party in which an introverted friend, Gussie
Fink-Nottle, gets drunk before a graduation
av urds speech. All this finally winds up with
Bertie performing a rousing "Sonny Boy"
and an absurdly funny tap dance routine.
The show has little "meat" for serious
minded people, but it is an exquisitely
crafted and performed piece of comic act
ing. Duke is not simply clowning at
caricatures, but "being" very funny people
in very funny situations (if such a distinction
is meaningful to you). His mastery of body
language and vocal range gives a depth to

his comic ability that separates him from
the "average" comedian. Duke has been
performing this show around the world for
the past few years, and the polish and style
of experience really shows. Nor is the piece
stale with old age, as Duke finds appropri
ate opportunities to address and improvise
with the audience.
"Jeeves Takes Charge" is a wonderful
evening's entertainment and a good way to
start off a night in the city. Particularly for
those who enjoy the wit, "gentlemanliness"
and social etiquette of Britain between the
wars, this is a well-bought ticket. What a
shame we all don't have an indefatigable
Jeeves.
