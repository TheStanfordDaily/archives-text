to UCLA in the Wendy's Classic.
However, Pacific was upset by
Cal-Poly San Luis Obispo last
weekend, giving the Tigers three
losses on the season. One of
those losses was at Stanford.

played since defeating California
Nov. 19, by a score of 15-0, 15-5,

15-11. Previously, Stanford beat

the Pac-West conference title
with a 7-1 record.

ponent tonight and tomorrow
night in Honolulu, is 25-9 on the
season and finished in third place
in the Pacific Coast Athletic Asso
ciation behind champion UOP.
The Wahines feature a young
team, with a trio of top hitters,
sophomores Suzanne Eagye and
Tita Ahuna and junior Debbie
Black. Freshman Melinda Beck
enhauer does the setting.
Eagye leads the team with a
.345 hitting percentage, averag
ing 3.2 kills per game. Black and
Ahuna have also recorded more

than three kills each game. Be
ckenhauer has an impressive .405
setting percentage, having
amassed 1,357 assists on the
season.
Ail-American Kim Oden has
paced the Cardinal attack. Oden
has 389 kills for a .386 hitting
percentage. Sophomore Wendi
Rush has set at a .408 clip.
Defensively, Stanford has been
led by Oden with 49 block solos
and 107 block assists. Junior
Barbra Fontana tops the team
with 266 digs.
Following the matches in
Hawaii, the Cardinal should
receive a bye in the first round
playoffs Dec. 6-8, and will wait to
see if it is selected to host the
West Regional Dec. 13-15.
