## New Year, New Hopes

In his first few years at Stanford, men's basketball
Coach Tom Davis has sometimes been criticized for
having his teams play an easy non-conference schedule
early in the season, loading up with small college teams
that were no match for a Pacific 10 Conference team
like the Cardinal.
This year's schedule has put much of that criticism
to rest, featuring teams like Maryland and North
Carolina. Tonight's opener against George Washington
at 7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion will be no pushover as
well.
"I'm a little worried this may be too tough a game for
us this early," Davis said yesterday evening after his
team's final preseason practice. "I think we'll be a
respectable scoring ballclub, but I'm a little concerned
about things at the other end."
Davis said that while the pressure defense Stanford
has been noted for has looked good so far, the half
court defense and the rebounding have been wor
risome.
George Washington handily won its first game this
season, an 87-59 decision Saturday over visiting
Montclair State, a Division 111 school. The Colonials
were 14-14 last year and 9-9 in the Atlantic 10 Confer
ence, good for a fourth-place tie.
The Colonials return 10 lettermen from that team,
including seven seniors. Guard Mike O'Reilly is ex
pected to be the team leader, having led the club in as
sists (4.0 per game), steals and scoring (7.7 points per
game).
Against Montclair State, senior guard Troy Webster
led the Colonials with 18 points. Three other players
were in double figures — junior forward Brian Butler
with 16, sophomore forward Kenny Barer with 13 and
freshman forward Moti Daniel with 10.
Davis said he plans to start guards Keith Ramee and
Steve Brown, forwards Andy Fischer and Earl Kober
lein, and center Greg Butler, though retaining the 10-
man rotation that has characterized his teams.
Coming off the bench will be guards Terry Taylor
and Novian Whitsitt, forward Todd Lichti and centers
Howard Wright and Eric Reveno. Butler is actually a
power forward, but Davis said he will start him with
Koberlein because "he and Earl have been our two
best rebounders in practice."
Davis will also have the services of guard John Paye
tonight. Paye's off-season lasted all of 27 hours.
