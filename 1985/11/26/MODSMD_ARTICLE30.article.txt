# Women Battle SCU, Boards
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
Establishing power underneath. Controling the
inside. Pulling down boards.
It doesn't matter what euphemistic tag you use to
describe the act of rebounding. What does matter is
how well you do it.
If you do it well, you'll win games. If you don't, in
variably, you'll lose.
Tonight, the Stanford women's basketball team
travels to Toso Pavilion to face the University of Santa
Clara Broncos in a non-league contest. Stanford Coach
lara VanDerveer holds that if the Cardinal doesn't start
pulling down some boards, it'll be in trouble.
Most of this burden will fall upon two freshmen, for
ward Evon Asforis and center Jill Yanke, who, due to a
recent spree of injuries, have had to assume starting
roles sooner than planned.
"We need Jill, Evon and Kim (Mercer, a 6-foot-1
junior forward) to establish themselves underneath,"
VanDerveer said. "Jill and Evon are going to have to
start playing like juniors."
This is a tall order for freshman to fill, but Asforis

and Yanke, 6-2 and 6-5 respectively, appear quite ca
pable of filling tall orders.
Yanke, named the Idaho Player of the Year in her
senior season at Borah High School, lettered nine
times in three different sports, volleyball, basketball
and track. It was in the latter that she set a school high
jump record at 5 feet 6 inches.
"Jill has good size, and she runs very well. She gets
up and down the court as well as any big person I've
seen. She's getting stronger each time she plays,"
VanDerveer said.
Asforis hails from August Martin High School in New
York, where, as team captain during her senior year,
she led her team to its second straight state title. She
was named to Parade Magazine's Fourth Team All-
America list for her efforts.
"Evon is strong. She plays intelligently and
aggressively. She's going to do some things against
people," VanDerveer said.
Hopefully, Stanford will "do some things" to the
Broncos, a team VanDerveer says matches up well
with the Cardinal.
The Meckenstock sisters, guard Suzy and forward
Cindy from Los Gatos, along with a quick, 5-3 point
guard, Michele Tahara, will lead the Bronco attack.
