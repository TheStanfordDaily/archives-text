### LISA MARTINEZ Staff writer 
XThe spirit of Big Game reigned
supreme as the Stanford fencing
t<ams whipped UC-Berkeley in the
Bears' home gym, the Cardinal men
Mnning 21-6, the women 15-1.
Stanford took control from the
start as the men's foil team beat Cal
5-'4. The epee and sabre teams
tJjen took over, each scoring at
l£ast six unanswered points before
Berkeley made a single touch.
•I"By the time the epee and sabre
tciams finished their first round,
there was very little doubt of the
outcome," men's and women's fen-
Cjng Coach Buzz Hurst said. Both
teams finished the meet with im
pCessive 8-1 victories.
i'Hurst said the Stanford women
Kept the ball rolling as they
"Stomped all over" the Bears with a
16-1 triumph. "Unlike the season
opener, the women looked very
strong," Hurst added. "They
fs*ited against an experienced team
'ipd had a very clear performance."
Coach Sherry Pos

thumus was also thrilled with the
meet. "The team was incredible.
Everyone was on and no one had to
be carried. It was a good group ef
fort. "
"(Women's team captain) Jennifer
Yu did her usual top-flight job,"
Hurst said. "She scored 20 touches
against her opponents and was hit
twice in return."
Hurst also commended the
performances of his No. 2 and No.
3 women, Allison Reid and Holly
Taylor. "Allison fenced very well
and was much more up to her game
than last week, and Holly was at the
top of her form, despite a slight
knee injury," he said.
"Cal had a strong team, commen
dably stronger than last year," he
said. Due to the fact that a number
of the Cal fencers were returning
from last year, "Berkeley had as
much, if not more, experience than
our team. From that standpoint it
was a close matchup," Hurst said.
Hurst pointed out several out
standing performances on the
men's side. Foil captain Elliot Cheu
showed his usual top-race style,
remaining undefeated with a score

of 3-0. A surprise came from the
No. 4 foil member, Mark Stout,
when he was substituted for
teammate Chris Gillen.
In his first year in on-strip com
petition, Hurst said Stout "really
came through" for the team, win
ning his first bout and coming ex
tremely close in the second.
The top men in sabre, captain
Andy Goorno and No. 2 Steve
Levitan, came through with their
usual exceptional performances,
remaining undefeated at 3-0.
In men's epee, according to
Hurst, Larry Murk "fenced ex
tremely well" against Cal's top man
John Theodorakis, coming away
with another 3-0 victory.
Overall, Hurst was very pleased
with the meet. "It was a solid and
satisfying victory against Cal. We
had a good attitude and took noth
ing for granted. I feel that the Stan
ford teams fenced up to their level."
The season looks promising for
the Cardinal teams. They will con
tinue to practice steadily through
the holidays for their upcoming
meet against UC-Santa Cruz Jan.
11.
