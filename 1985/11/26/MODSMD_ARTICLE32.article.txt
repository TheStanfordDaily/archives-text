# Grapplers Limp Into SF Meet
## 
### PETER CASTILLO Staff writer 
Reminiscent of 1984, the Stan
ford wrestling team heads into
today's dual meet against San
Francisco State facing the possi
bility that injuries may force it to
forfeit two matches.
The meet gets underway at 4
p.m. in Maples Pavilion. As a
promotional incentive, free shoes
will be handed out and the first
200 fans in attendance will get
Stanford wrestling T-shirts.
"Even with the problems we
have, we are still favored," wres
tling Coach Chris Horpel said.
"(San Francisco) would have to
pull an upset, (because) we have
momentum and the majority of
the team is ready and healthy."
c * n nford's Mason Gomez (118

pounds) is still questionable with a
skin infection, and Eric Harber
(167 pounds) might miss the meet
due to an illness. This may force
Horpel to juggle his lineup by
having Pete Rogers move from
158 pounds to 167 and having a
150-pound reserve wrestler com
pete at 158.
Horpel said the move will be
made only if Rogers decides to do
it. But if Gomez and Harber both
miss the meet and Rogers makes
his shift, Stanford will still have to
forfeit the 118-pound match.
Cardinal athletes to watch for
are 177-pound Dave Lee, who
destroyed his UC-Davis opponent
Friday night, and heavyweight
Kurt Kassulke, who has looked
extremely tough in his early
' season matches.
A key matchup in the meet is at
142 pounds, where Jeff Bradley

will meet San Francisco's Division
II Ail-American Rich Ellingsten.
And if the meet is tight, added
pressure will be on Stanford's
Terry Mclntyre (190 pounds),
who will face an experienced op
ponent, San Francisco senior Tim
Gleason.
Going into a meet like
tonight's, when the team might
already be down by 12 points at
the outset, Horpel feels there are
two ways for an athlete to ap
proach a match.
"One way is for the wrestlers
to try to do their best. They can
feel good based on their perfor
mance even if the team loses.
The team aspect is an extra form
of motivation beyond the personal
motivation," Horpel said.
The other way is just to come
out aggressively.
