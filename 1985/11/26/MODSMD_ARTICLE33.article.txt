U.S., Ghana Swap Alleged Spies
WASHINGTON — The United States and Ghana yesterday ex
changed a Ghanaian national accused of spying on CIA agents in his
homeland for a group of Ghanaians who allegedly worked with the
American intelligence agency in the West African country.
Michael Soussoudis, a first cousin of Ghana's leader, Flight Lt.
Jerry Rawlings, was released yesterday morning to the custody of
the Ghanaian ambassador to the United States, minutes after he was
whisked into a closed federal courtroom and sentenced to 20 years in
prison for receiving classified information from a CIA clerk who had
become his lover in Africa.
The sentence was suspended on condition that Soussoudis leave
the country within 24 hours, according to government sources.
A few hours later the former CIA employee, who has admitted
giving classified information to Soussoudis, was sentenced to five
years in prison in a dramatic hearing before another judge in the
same courtroom in Alexandria, Va.
Sharon Scranage, 30, was ordered by U.S. District Court Judge
Richard Williams to begin serving her sentence immediately.
In return for Soussoudis, said Justice Department spokesman John
Russell, "a number of Ghanaian citizens who have been in custody
and have special interest toward the U.S. have been released and
their families allowed to go to other African countries." Another indi
vidual familiar with the case said nine Ghanaians who had been in cus
tody were taken from Ghana yesterday to the neighboring country of
Togo.
Discord Marks East-West Forum
BUDAPEST, Hungary — A major East-West forum on culture
ended here yesterday without a concluding agreement and in a
barrage of angry rhetoric, as Soviet and U.S. delegates accused each
other of abusing the cooperative spirit of last week's Geneva summit
conference.
After a long weekend of negotiations, Western and Soviet Bloc
diplomats at the forum of the Conference on Security and Coopera
tion in Europe announced yesterday morning that they had been
unable to agree on a document summing up the six weeks of talks
here among government officials and cultural figures from 35 par
ticipating nations.
The Soviet delegation, which had refused to accept references to
free expression and dissemination of information in the document,
then held a press conference to attack the United States, Britain and
other Western governments for "torpedoing the document,
positively in cold blood."
G. Ivanov, a Soviet deputy minister of culture, read a prepared
statement yesterday charging the United States with "calumny" and
"attempts to introduce pornography and chaos" during the confer
ence. He went on to cite "glaring infringements of human rights,"
saying "it does not seem to bother anyone in the United States that
cultural and physical genocide is being practiced within their borders
and that there is racism and anti-Semitism."
U.S. officials responded that the Soviets had failed to address
Western concerns about censorship, jamming of radio broadcasts and
freedom of movement and expression and systematically had
blocked open discussions among artists at the forum.
Israel, Morocco Agree on Talks
JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and
Morocco's King Hassan each said publicly yesterday that he would be
willing to meet with the other and that there had been contacts be
tween them in an effort to set up a meeting.
Hassan, who enjoys greater than usual visibility in the Arab world
because he is current chairman of the Arab League, said in an inter
view with French journalists that he had told Peres, "If you have
something serious (to discuss about Middle East Peace), come and
see me."
Israeli officials said there had been a number of contacts between
Hassan and Israeli leaders over the years but thfit none had been
made public. Hassan's interview with the French journalists was
released by the official Moroccan news agency.
Mexico To Lower Trade Barriers
MEXICO CITY — The Mexican government, in a landmark deci
sion to lower trade barriers, has committed itself to accept the rules
set by the Western world's main international commercial pact.
President Miguel de la Madrid issued a statement late Sunday
saying that Mexico would enter the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, known as the GATT.
It will take months for Mexico to negotiate terms of its entry, and
the country probably will have 10 years or more to bring its customs
duties and other trade regulations into line with those of the GATT's
other members.
Mexico is the largest Western nation that is not a member of the
GATT.
Hondurans Re-Elect Coalition
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras — Opposition National Party candi
date Rafael Leonardo Callejas won the most votes in Honduras' pres
idential election but lost the presidency, according to returns
released yesterday.
Jose Azcona Hoyo, the leading candidate from the ruling Liberal
Party, came in second in the popular vote, but is expected to be
declared the winner of Sunday's election because his party earned
more votes than the National Party.
With more than half of the ballots counted, Callejas had 41.3 per
cent of the popular vote, compared to 24.4 percent for second-place
Azcona.
But Azcona's Liberal Party, which had four candidates on the bal
lot, won 51 percent of the vote. Callejas's National Party, with three
candidates on the ballot, won only 45 percent of the vote. Two other
parties had a candidate each on the ballot.
U.S. Offers Reward for Abbas
WASHINGTON — The U.S. government offered a $250,000
reward yesterday for information leading to the arrest, conviction
and punishment of Palestinian leader Abul Abbas and anyone else
who may have been involved in the hijacking of the cruise ship Achille
Lauro.
State Department spokesman Charles Redman, who announced
the offer, said that the U. S. government would protect the identity
of any informants.
Under a 1984 law, the Secretary of State can offer rewards of up
to $500,000 for the capture and conviction of terrorists.
