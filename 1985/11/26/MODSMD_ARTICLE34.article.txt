# Egypt Blames PLO Faction for Hijacking
## Cairo claims Libyan involvement; U.S. praises Egyptian Commando raid 
### 
CAIRO, Egypt, VALLETTA, Malta and
WASHINGTON — The Egyptian government
yesterday blamed members of a Palestine
Liberation Organization "dissident group,"
backed by Libya, for carrying out the grisly
Egypt Air hijacking that ultimately cost the lives
of nearly 60 persons in Malta Sunday.
An official statement yesterday afternoon said
only that the PLO dissidents were "working for
an Arab country known for its terrorist practices
and for sheltering terrorists."
But a commentary on the government
controlled Cairo radio late last night was more
blunt, claiming "Col. Moammar Khadafy's Libya"
provided "funding and incitement" for the hijack
ers.
In Washington, U.S. officials yesterday
welcomed Egypt's prompt attack on the hijacked
Egypt Air jetliner as evidence of a new and toug
her worldwide attitude toward terrorism despite
its bloody toll of 60 deaths.
White House, State Department and Depart
ment of Defense spokesmen joined in praising

the Egyptian action.
Meanwhile, the government of Malta, stunned
by the heavy loss of life in the storming of the
hijacked Egyptian airliner, said yesterday that it
bowed to pressure from Cairo to end the hijack
ing and now is "deeply disappointed" with the
outcome.
Maltese government spokesman Paul Mifsud
said that 60 of the 97 people aboard died in the
hijacking of the Egypt Air 737 jetliner and the as
sault by Egyptian commandos that ended the in
cident Sunday night on the apron at Malta's Laqa
International Airport.
The Maltese government also disclosed that a
man identified as one of five terrorists who
hijacked the Athens-to-Cairo flight had survived
the commando assault. He was hospitalized with
injuries and remained unconscious last night.
Mifsud said that it was still not clear who the
hijackers were. He added that the government
had not decided how to proceed with the
wounded hijacker, if he survives.
Egyptian troops remained on alert yesterday

along the Libyan border, and the communique
released through Egypt's official Middle East
News Agency vowed that "those who did
wrong" in this incident "will later know what
they brought upon themselves."
Egyptian officials declined to elaborate fur
ther, and a number of vital questions remain
open about the hijackers-including how much the
Egyptians actually know about them.
The official statements that have been made
here tend to distort the events in Malta, claiming
that the assault on the plane last night was
carried out "successfully" and "without any
losses in the lives of passengers or the Egyptian
commandos" as a result of the commandos' ac
tions.
Although the terrorists called themselves
"Egypt's Revolution" and a letter to a Kuwait
newspaper claimed the action in the name of a
hitherto unheard of "Egypt Liberation Organiza
tion," officials here have refused to so much as
consider publicly the possibility that the terror
ists could have been Egyptians.
