# Yurchenko Tip Leads to New Spy Arrest
## 
### 
BALTIMORE — Acting on a tip
from double defector Vitaly Yur
chenko, the FBI arrested a former
National Security Agency communi
cations specialist yesterday and
accused him of selling "extremely
sensitive" intelligence data to the
Soviet Union.
It was the fourth espionage ar
rest by the FBI in five days in the
Washington area, which is already
reeling from an unparalleled series
of spy scandals in recent months.
Administration officials said the
recent wave of arrests stemmed
from increased counterintelligence
measures and improved coopera
tion between federal agencies.
Ronald Pelton, 44, confessed to
selling secrets to the Soviets begin
ning in 1980, the year after he left
his job at the NSA, the super
secret agency assigned to intercept
and analyze communications of

foreign governments, the FBI said
in an affidavit filed here.
The affidavit said Pelton first
went to the Soviet Embassy in
Washington in January 1980, when
he was having "serious financial dif
ficulties," and sold "specific infor
mation relating to a U.S. intelli
gence collection project targeted at
the Soviet Union."
Later in 1980, again in 1983
and last spring, the affidavit said, he
traveled to Vienna, Austria, to
deliver more secrets, staying twice
at the Soviet ambassador's apart
ment.
The affadavit said the FBI identi
fied Pelton after receiving informa
tion from "a confidential source in a
position to have access to ex
tremely sensitive information about
Soviet intelligence activities di
rected against the United States."
Although the document did not

elaborate, Asst. FBI Director
William Baker said the tip came
from Yurchenko, the Soviet KGB

official who defected to the West
last summer, but redefected in Most
cow early this month.
The FBI did not divulge Pelton's
precise duties at the NSA or say
why he left the agency. But the af-i
fidavit said that he had "top secret
clearance for special compart
mented information relating to sig
nals intelligence."
Pelton was the fourth person
rested in five days on espionage
charges. Jonathan Pollard, a Naval
Investigative Service analyst, was
accused Thursday of passing mili
tary secrets to a foreign country
that sources identified as Israel,
and his wife, Anne, was charged
Friday with unauthorized posses
sion of classified documents. Larry
Wu-tai Chin, a retired CIA em
ployee, was charged Saturday with
spying for China for more than
three decades.
