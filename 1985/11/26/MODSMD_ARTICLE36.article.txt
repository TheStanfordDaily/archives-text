Report Raps Rackets
WASHINGTON — A draft report for the
President's Commission on Organized Crime
criticizes the federal government's drive
against labor racketeering as "fragmented and
ineffective" and cites ominous indications of in
creasing business cooperation with the mob,
the Los Angeles Times learned yesterday.
In a staff-written report circulating among
the commission's 19 members for their ap
proval, the panel calls for an industry-by
industry attack to loosen the underworld's
grip, for companies to stop doing business with
organized crime, and for unions to move ag
gressively to cleanse themselves of mob influ
ence.
Commission research director Nicholas
Chiarkas, outlining the staff's conclusions in an
interview, said labor racketeering resulted in
millions of Americans paying organized crime
"a surcharge on a wide range of goods and
services."
Many of the mob-connected local unions
have thousands of members and operate in cri
tical commercial sectors in large metropolitan
centers, Chiarkas said.
By dominating key labor unions, organized
crime controls construction, garbage
collecting, wholesale and retail meat
processing, trucking and waterfront trade in
some major metropolitan areas, Chiarkas said.
In those markets, organized crime
"determines who will do business and who will
not" by allocating territories, setting prices,
dictating wages and benefits and making a

sham of collective bargaining, Chiarkas said
the report concludes.
Letter Protests Aid
WASHINGTON — More than 100 members
of Congress have written President Reagan
opposing U.S. assistance to rebels fighting the
Marxist government in Angola.
The letter states that U.S. involvement in
the Angolan conflict, "whether direct or indi
rect, covert or overt, would damage our rela
tions with governments throughout Africa and
undermine fundamental U.S. policy objectives
in southern Africa."
Dated last Friday, it was initiated by Rep.
Matthew McHugh (D-N.Y.), a member of the
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelli
gence.
Reagan announced late last week that he
favors a covert-aid operation to the rebel
group, the National Union for the Total Inde
pendence of Angola (UNITA). He said it would
be "more useful" and "have more chance of
success" than various bills in Congress calling
for either open military or humanitarian assis
tance.
More than 100 members of Congress are
co-sponsoring a bill that was introduced by
Rep. Mark Siljander (R-Mich.) and authorizes
$27 million in overt military aid to UNITA.
Another bill, sponsored by House Rules
Committee Chairman C'aude Pepper, (D-Fla.)
and Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.) would provide
the same amount in humanitarian assistance.

Auto Sales Drop
DETROIT — Domestic car sales, still hur
ting as a result of the incentive-induced sales
boom of late summer, fell 27.2 percent in mid-
November, the seven U.S. auto makers re
ported yesterday.
The companies said they sold 184,327 new
cars in the Nov. 11-20 period, down from
225,196 in the comparable 1984 period. It was
the fifth consecutive period of declining sales
for the domestic manufacturers.
Auto analysts said the recent sales drought
is the result of record-setting sales in late Au
gust and September, when most companies of
fered cut-rate financing and other incentives to
sell leftover 1985 models.
Analysts expect the sales rate to continue to
fall below year-ago levels through the end of
the year unless another round of broad incen
tives is introduced.
Market Dips Slightly
NEW YORK — The stock market turned
downward yesterday, backing away from last
week's record highs in the lightest trading in
six weeks.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell
7.68 to 1,456.65.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
slowed to 91.71 million shares, down from
133.75 million Friday.
