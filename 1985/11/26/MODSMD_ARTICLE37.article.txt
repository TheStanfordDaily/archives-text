Smith To Be Tried
LOS ANGELES — Cathy Evelyn Smith, a
former backup vocalist, companion to rock
musicians and heroin addict, must stand trial
for second-degree murder in the 1982 drug
overdose death of comedian John Belushi, a
judge ruled yesterday.
"Surely Mr. Belushi issued the invitation to
this dance," Los Angeles Municipal Judge
James Nelson said of the comedian's last five
days of drug-taking with Smith.
"But it was an inherently dangerous dance,
and the legislature has provided that the price

for the piper in these instances is high," the
judge added.
In addition to the murder count, Smith, 38,
must also stand trial on 13 felony counts of fur
nishing or administering drugs. If convicted of
all charges, she could face a maximum prison
sentence of 17 years to life, said Deputy Dis
trict Attorney Michael Montagna,
Burglar Wins $50,000
HOLLYWOOD — A 20-year-old convicted
burglar who won $50,000 in the state lottery

yesterday said afterwards that he hopes his life
will "change drastically."
But Salvadore Valencia Rodriguez — who
has been arrested three times in the past
seven months for drug violations and other
petty crimes — may have to wait until he gets
out of jail to spend his new windfall.
The Irvine man, who said his problems
started when he became a gang member while
still in his teens, is due in court in Newport
Beach today to answer to charges of posses
sion of marijuana and stolen property.
Rodriguez, in fact, was released from Or
ange County Jail only last week.
