# Friends Recall Pollard
## Spy suspect earned degree here in 1976 
### JOYA WESLEY Senior staff writer 
Former acquaintances of Stanford alumnus
Jonathan Jay Pollard, currently being held on
suspicion of delivering U.S. secrets to the Is
raeli government, say the charges come as
no surprise.
In an interview yesterday, Steven
LaPointe, Pollard's roommate freshman
year, painted a picture of Pollard as a practi
cal joker who invented stories of his connec
tions to Israel. Pollard, a Navy counterintel
ligence officer, graduated from Stanford in
1976 with a degree in political science.
U. S. authorities have said Pollard admitted
receiving $50,000 in return for giving naval
and CIA codes to Israel. He was arrested
Thursday in Washington after attempting to
force his way into the Israeli Embassy.
LaPointe, who lived in Soto House with
Pollard for three years following freshman
year, said, "I think that had he (Pollard) been
properly screened, he would never have
been admitted to an intelligence agency."
Another of Pollard's acquaintances, Jonat
han Marshall, editorial page editor of the Oak
land Tribune and son of Stanford Political Sci
ence Prof. Hubert Marshall, said he sees no
reason to doubt Pollard's confession.
"I think there's a lot of credible evidence
that something was going on," he said.
Marshall concurred that Pollard had
claimed to have Israeli connections, adding
that Pollard said he was on the payroll of Mos

sad, Israel's equivalent of the CIA.
Beginning his studies at Stanford with a
pre-medical curriculum. Pollard switched to
political science because of his strong interest
in military history and the structure of Israel's
military and intelligence operations, accord
ing to LaPointe, who now lives in Washing
ton.
"Jay Pollard was definitely pro-Israel," he
said. "He used to boast that he had a dual
citizenship and that he was a colonel in the Is
raeli Army."
LaPointe said he did not believe the later
claim, pointing out that Pollard attempted to
join the Israeli Army during the 1973 Yom
Kippur War â€” something he would not have
needed to do had he already been a colonel.
Pollard was a habitual practical joker, ac
cording to LaPointe.
"He had a penchant for playing dirty jokes
on people," he said.
During his years at Stanford, LaPointe said
Pollard would wire room lights with fireworks
so they would explode when turned on, and
hide in people's closets and jump out at them
when they walked into their rooms.
"That's just scratching the surface of the
dirty tricks he used to do," LaPointe said.
LaPointe said Pollard spent much of his
time in Soto playing the games "Diplomacy"
and "Panzer Blitz," which concentrates on
German strategy during World War 11.
According to The Washington
Post, the United States and Israel
agreed during the Eisenhower Ad
ministration not to conduct covert
operations against each other. On
Monday, Israel issued a statement
that has been widely interpeted as
an admission of lower-level govern
ment involvement in the Pollard af
fair.
