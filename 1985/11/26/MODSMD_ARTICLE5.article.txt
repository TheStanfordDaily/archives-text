### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff With wire reports 
Calling himself a conservative, a
conservationist and a "cheap
hawk," Rep. Ed Zschau (R-
Sunnyvale) yesterday announced
his intention to run for the U.S.
Senate next year.
In a campaign kickoff speech at
the Palo Alto Hyatt yesterday
morning, Zschau, a former profes
sor at Stanford's Graduate School
of Business, told 500 supporters, "I
can seize the center of the political
spectrum from (democratic incum
bent Sen.) Alan Cranston."
"I have, been a hard-line, conser
vative on economic issues, but on
social issues I don't subscribe to the
Moral Majority agenda" that in
cludes compulsory school prayer
and a constitutional ban on abortion,
Zschau said.
Zschau, who has voted for Ad
ministration proposals fewer times
than any of California's 18 Republi
can members of Congress, has
bucked President Reagan on fund
ing for the MX missile system and
has generally opposed aid to the
contra rebels in Nicaragua.
"I believe the voters want people

who are willing to get out in front on
the issues and provide direction
even though that may mean going
against the prevailing opinions of
the time," he said.
Zschau, who received his
M.8.A., an M.S. and his Ph.l).

from Stanford, said that he is more
conservative on economic issues.
"I'm an economic conservative.
That puts me in stark contrast with
Alan Cranston's free-spending phil
osophy. . . . Cranston puts his faith

in government programs rather
than in the potential of the individual
endeavor," he said.
Zschau added that he supports
reasonable defense spending. "We
should be spending the money we
need on defense, but no more and
no less I'm a hawk, but I'm a cheap
hawk," he said.
On other issues, Zschau des
cribed himself as a "free-trader" on
foreign trade and as an environmen
talist.
"Being a conservative doesn't
mean being tight-fisted with
money. It also means conserving
our natural resources so future
generations can have the same op
portunities and quality of life we en
joy, " he said.
Joking about his unusual name,
Zschau announced the beginning of
his campaign by declaring, "Today
we begin a 344-day effort to teach
the voters of this great state how to
spell and pronounce my name and

also to share with them my vision
for America's future." His name
rhymes with "now."
The Republican primary will take
place June 3, 1986, with the general
election to be held in November.
Zschau joins state Sen. Ed Davis
of Valencia, economist Arthur Laf
fer and Assemblyman Bob Naylor
of Menlo Park as candidates for the
Republican nomination. Alan
Cranston, the minority whip of the
Senate, has already announced that
he will seek the Democratic nomin
ation for a fourth six-year term.
Five other Republicans have
formed exploratory committees but
have not yet made formal declara
tions of their candidacies.
In Nov. 1984, Zschau, 45, won a
second term in Congress by defeat
ing Democratic challenger Martin
Carnoy, a professor of education
here.
Zschau received about 64 per
cent of the overall vote in the 12th
Congressional district to Carnoy's
34 percent, but those figures were
reversed among Stanford voters.
