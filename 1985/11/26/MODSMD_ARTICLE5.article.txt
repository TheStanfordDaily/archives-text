### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff With wire reports 
Calling himself a conservative, a
conservationist and a "cheap
hawk," Rep. Ed Zschau (R-
Sunnyvale) yesterday announced
his intention to run for the U.S.
Senate next year.
In a campaign kickoff speech at
the Palo Alto Hyatt yesterday
morning, Zschau, a former profes
sor at Stanford's Graduate School
of Business, told 500 supporters, "I
can seize the center of the political
spectrum from (democratic incum
bent Sen.) Alan Cranston."
"I have, been a hard-line, conser
vative on economic issues, but on
social issues I don't subscribe to the
Moral Majority agenda" that in
cludes compulsory school prayer
and a constitutional ban on abortion,
Zschau said.
Zschau, who has voted for Ad
ministration proposals fewer times
than any of California's 18 Republi
can members of Congress, has
bucked President Reagan on fund
ing for the MX missile system and
has generally opposed aid to the
contra rebels in Nicaragua.
"I believe the voters want people

who are willing to get out in front on
the issues and provide direction
even though that may mean going
against the prevailing opinions of
the time," he said.
Zschau, who received his
M.8.A., an M.S. and his Ph.l).

from Stanford, said that he is more
conservative on economic issues.
"I'm an economic conservative.
That puts me in stark contrast with
Alan Cranston's free-spending phil
osophy. . . . Cranston puts his faith
