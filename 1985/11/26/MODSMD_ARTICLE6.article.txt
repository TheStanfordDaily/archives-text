WATSONVILLE — Current strikes against
two canning companies in Watsonville, about 60
miles south of Stanford, in many ways seem to
dwarf the trauma that swept over this campus
when members of United Stanford Workers
threatened to walk off their jobs last month.
On Sept. 9, 2,000 workers — mostly Chicano
women — of the the two largest canning com
panies in Watsonville, Watsonville Canning Co.
and Richard A. Shaw, Inc., went on strike tc
oppose the stipulations of a new contract pro
posal.
Watsonville Canning had pressed to cut entry
level wages for its workers from $6.66 to $4.2f
per hour, while Shaw hoped for a similar cut.
The companies also sought to reduce some
benefits, such as extended sick leaves and vaca
tion time, as well as to curb the automatic deduc
tion of union dues from workers' paychecks.
The latest proposal from the factory owners is
$5.05 per hour for entry-level work, with the
other brackets "basically the same," according

to the president of Watsonville Canning, Smiley
Verduzco, a 1972 graduate of Stanford's
Graduate School of Business.
He noted that in the Watsonville area, most
unskilled laborers are getting only $3.50 to $4.75
per hour with minimum benefits, whereas can
nery employees get sick leave, funeral leave and
jury leave.
Strikers counter by saying neither Watsonville
Canning nor Shaw offers maternity leave, while
women make up the majority of the area's
workforce.
The workers on strike — members of
Teamsters Local 912 — see the actions of the
companies leading up to and during the strike as
efforts to get rid of the union and to put pressure
on the growers who supply the canneries with
vegetables for packing.
Sergio Lopes, the business agent of Local
912, cited three reasons for the deep cuts in
wages.
"One, they (management) want to get rid of
the union," he said. "They did everything possi
ble to get people out on the street. There were
mass terminations. Two, they were well
prepared for the strike with a huge inventory.
Three, they want to put it to the grower. In the
contract with the growers, there is a clause that
stipulates that in case of a labor dispute, they
don't have to buy."

As a strike against Watsonville's two larg
est canning companies enters its third
month, workers say their spirits remain
high despite management's pledge to cut
pay and job benefits.
This latest proposal of $5.05 per hour wage was
voted down by union membership 800 to 1.
Verduzco characterized his company as under in
tense competition from other canneries in Mexico,
Guatemala, Texas and other regions that are not re
quired to pay wages as high as those required by Cali
fornia law.
"The essential question is not the standard of living.
The essential question is losing money," Verduzco
said. "It is not a question of paying wages we would
like to pay, it is a question of staying in business and
providing jobs."

He added, "Our case is absolutely not unique. Other
California packers are in deep water, too."
Lopes acknowledged that canneries have competi
tion, but denied the severity of the situation. "There is
no state in the nation, no region in the world, that can
match California's growing season," he said.
"J.J. Crosetti Frozen Foods (another Watsonville
company) is paying union wages. If the little guy can
pay, why not the giants?" Lopes said.
Some workers have expressed suspicions of the
union leadership itself and its behavior about the strike.
"The union has money invested in the canneries, so a
strike is not in their interest," commented one worker

who spoke at Stanford on Thursday.
Speaking on the condition he not be identified by
name, the worker, who is member of Local 912, added
that union officials cooperated with management to
compel workers to strike. By fostering a walkout but
not offer any leadership, union officials thought the
strike would immediately fail, the worker said.
Workers are never more likely to accept an unfair
contract than immediately after a failed strike, the
worker said.
"They (the union leadership) gave no advice how to
do a strike, how to negotiate. They only allowed two
workers in to negotiate, and they (the workers) don't
know how to express themselves," the worker added.
Some workers have vowed that they will replace the
current union management in upcoming union elec
tions.
As the strike has unfolded, the issue of racism has
often attracted considerable attention. Seventy-five to
80 percent of the union's membership is from Mexico,
and many workers believe the moves by the cannery
are racist.
Owners have stressed that race is not an issue.
"Seventy-five to 80 percent of the workers are of
Mexican heritage, 75 percent of the managers are of
Mexican heritage, and I myself am of Mexican heritage.
It (the issue of wage cuts) is simply a case of econom
ics," Verduzco said.
Federal mediation has been requested to break the
deadlock, but the first mediator was not acceptable to
both parties. The second mediator was scheduled to
meet with the cannery owners and union officials yes
terday.

80 percent of the union's membership is from Mexico,
and many workers believe the moves by the cannery
are racist.
Owners have stressed that race is not an issue.
"Seventy-five to 80 percent of the workers are of
Mexican heritage, 75 percent of the managers are of
Mexican heritage, and I myself am of Mexican heritage.
It (the issue of wage cuts) is simply a case of econom

Federal mediation has been requested to break the
deadlock, but the first mediator was not acceptable to
both parties. The second mediator was scheduled to

WATSONVILLE — Current strikes against
two canning companies in Watsonville, about 60
miles south of Stanford, in many ways seem to
dwarf the trauma that swept over this campus
when members of United Stanford Workers
threatened to walk off their jobs last month.
On Sept. 9, 2,000 workers — mostly Chicano
women — of the the two largest canning com
panies in Watsonville, Watsonville Canning Co.
and Richard A. Shaw, Inc., went on strike tc
oppose the stipulations of a new contract pro
posal.
Watsonville Canning had pressed to cut entry
level wages for its workers from $6.66 to $4.2f
per hour, while Shaw hoped for a similar cut.
The companies also sought to reduce some
benefits, such as extended sick leaves and vaca
tion time, as well as to curb the automatic deduc
tion of union dues from workers' paychecks.
The latest proposal from the factory owners is
$5.05 per hour for entry-level work, with the
other brackets "basically the same," according

to the president of Watsonville Canning, Smiley
Verduzco, a 1972 graduate of Stanford's
Graduate School of Business.
He noted that in the Watsonville area, most
unskilled laborers are getting only $3.50 to $4.75
per hour with minimum benefits, whereas can
nery employees get sick leave, funeral leave and
jury leave.
Strikers counter by saying neither Watsonville
Canning nor Shaw offers maternity leave, while
women make up the majority of the area's
workforce.
The workers on strike — members of
Teamsters Local 912 — see the actions of the
companies leading up to and during the strike as
efforts to get rid of the union and to put pressure
on the growers who supply the canneries with
vegetables for packing.
Sergio Lopes, the business agent of Local
912, cited three reasons for the deep cuts in
wages.
"One, they (management) want to get rid of
the union," he said. "They did everything possi
ble to get people out on the street. There were
mass terminations. Two, they were well
prepared for the strike with a huge inventory.
Three, they want to put it to the grower. In the
contract with the growers, there is a clause that
stipulates that in case of a labor dispute, they
don't have to buy."

As a strike against Watsonville's two larg
est canning companies enters its third
month, workers say their spirits remain
high despite management's pledge to cut
pay and job benefits.
This latest proposal of $5.05 per hour wage was
voted down by union membership 800 to 1.
Verduzco characterized his company as under in
tense competition from other canneries in Mexico,
Guatemala, Texas and other regions that are not re
quired to pay wages as high as those required by Cali
fornia law.
"The essential question is not the standard of living.
The essential question is losing money," Verduzco
said. "It is not a question of paying wages we would
like to pay, it is a question of staying in business and
providing jobs."

He added, "Our case is absolutely not unique. Other
California packers are in deep water, too."
Lopes acknowledged that canneries have competi
tion, but denied the severity of the situation. "There is
no state in the nation, no region in the world, that can
match California's growing season," he said.
"J.J. Crosetti Frozen Foods (another Watsonville
company) is paying union wages. If the little guy can
pay, why not the giants?" Lopes said.
Some workers have expressed suspicions of the
union leadership itself and its behavior about the strike.
"The union has money invested in the canneries, so a
strike is not in their interest," commented one worker

who spoke at Stanford on Thursday.
Speaking on the condition he not be identified by
name, the worker, who is member of Local 912, added
that union officials cooperated with management to
compel workers to strike. By fostering a walkout but
not offer any leadership, union officials thought the
strike would immediately fail, the worker said.
Workers are never more likely to accept an unfair
contract than immediately after a failed strike, the
worker said.
"They (the union leadership) gave no advice how to
do a strike, how to negotiate. They only allowed two
workers in to negotiate, and they (the workers) don't
know how to express themselves," the worker added.
Some workers have vowed that they will replace the
current union management in upcoming union elec
tions.
