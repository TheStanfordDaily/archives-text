WATSONVILLE — Current strikes against
two canning companies in Watsonville, about 60
miles south of Stanford, in many ways seem to
dwarf the trauma that swept over this campus
when members of United Stanford Workers
threatened to walk off their jobs last month.
On Sept. 9, 2,000 workers — mostly Chicano
women — of the the two largest canning com
panies in Watsonville, Watsonville Canning Co.
and Richard A. Shaw, Inc., went on strike tc
oppose the stipulations of a new contract pro
posal.
Watsonville Canning had pressed to cut entry
level wages for its workers from $6.66 to $4.2f
per hour, while Shaw hoped for a similar cut.
The companies also sought to reduce some
benefits, such as extended sick leaves and vaca
tion time, as well as to curb the automatic deduc
tion of union dues from workers' paychecks.
The latest proposal from the factory owners is
$5.05 per hour for entry-level work, with the
other brackets "basically the same," according

to the president of Watsonville Canning, Smiley
Verduzco, a 1972 graduate of Stanford's
Graduate School of Business.
He noted that in the Watsonville area, most
unskilled laborers are getting only $3.50 to $4.75
per hour with minimum benefits, whereas can
nery employees get sick leave, funeral leave and
jury leave.
Strikers counter by saying neither Watsonville
Canning nor Shaw offers maternity leave, while
women make up the majority of the area's
workforce.
The workers on strike — members of
Teamsters Local 912 — see the actions of the
companies leading up to and during the strike as
efforts to get rid of the union and to put pressure
on the growers who supply the canneries with
vegetables for packing.
Sergio Lopes, the business agent of Local
912, cited three reasons for the deep cuts in
wages.
"One, they (management) want to get rid of
the union," he said. "They did everything possi
ble to get people out on the street. There were
mass terminations. Two, they were well
prepared for the strike with a huge inventory.
Three, they want to put it to the grower. In the
contract with the growers, there is a clause that
stipulates that in case of a labor dispute, they
don't have to buy."
