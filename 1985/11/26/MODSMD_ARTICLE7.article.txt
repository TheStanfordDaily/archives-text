# Council Delays Consideration of South African Investments
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
The Palo Alto City Council last night postponed a
decision on an ordinance that would prohibit invest
ment of city funds in financial institutions doing busi
ness in South Africa, saying its members need time to
decide whether they have a conflict of interest on the
issue.
The council was scheduled to hear testimony and
vote on the ordinance at last night's meeting in the Palo
Alto City Hall, but when several members said they
were unsure whether personal investments con
stituted conflict of interest, the decision was postponed
until the council's meeting on Monday.
Sponsored by council members Ellen Fletcher and
Larry Klein, the proposal seeks to prohibit "the
deposit, investment or use of city funds with banks,
financial institutions, investment firms or others who
do business with either the public or private sector of
South Africa or Namibia so long as apartheid is the offi
cial position of those countries," according to the
meeting's agenda.
Namibia, officially called South-West Africa, is cur
rently occupied by South African troops.
Palo Alto has an "unwritten policy" prohibiting the
South Africa-related investments, but the ordinance
proposal would make the policy official, according to
Ted Howland, a member of the Mid-Peninsula Coalition
Against Apartheid.
Several community members and Stanford students

were scheduled to address the council but were denied
when the issue was postponed. They are expected to
be invited to speak at Monday's council meeting.
Howland, one of about 40 supporters of the proposal
who attended the meeting, said he believes the
postponement will have no effect on the chances of the
ordinance being passed.
Even if fewer people concerned with the issue at
tend Monday's meeting, "The council people know that
we were able to turn out about 40 people" in support of
the proposal, Howland said.
Donna Anderson, a Stanford senior who waited her
turn to speak for almost four hours while the council
debated other topics, said, "It distresses me that,
knowing that this issue was coming up on the agenda,
only one council member had gone to the bother of in
vestigating her financial interests" before the session.
Council Member Betsy Bechtel, an employee of
Citicorp Savings, began the consideration of the or
dinance by declaring herself ineligible. Mayor Leland
Levy then decided that he was also ineligible because
he is employed by a financial firm that acts as a broker
for companies doing business in South Africa.
Bechtel and Leland's decisions prompted other
council members to consider their eligibility. After
lengthy discussion, Vice-Mayor Mike Cobb postponed
the consideration.
This week, those serving on the nine-member coun
cil who believe they have conflicts of interest will sub
mit the details of their investments to a city attorney,
who will then decide on their eligibility for the vote.
