# Palo Alto Investment Verdict Won't Affect Stanford Policy, Officials Say
## 
### JOHN CALLON 
The Palo Alto City Council's
consideration of a "non
investment policy" toward com
panies operating in South Africa is
not likely to have an effect on any
Stanford decision on the divest
ment issue, according to Univer
sity officials.
Although such a move "would
send a message," Andy Doty,
Stanford's director of Community
relations, said, "I don't see (the
policy) as having any weight."
Assistant to the President Bob
Hamrdla agreed, alluding to Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy's position that "it is not the
necessary case that Stanford
should follow what others do. Our
decision should be made on the
merits of the case."
In discussing the relationship
between Palo Alto and Stanford,
Doty emphasized that the Univer
sity is in no way bound to the
council's decision.

"I don't see a direct correlation
between the resolution and Stan
ford," he said.
He explained that a portion of
University lands, including the in
dustrial park and Stanford Medical
Center, is within Palo Alto's juris
diction, but the University itself is
independent of the city.
Most of Stanford is an unincor
porated territory regulated by
Santa Clara County.
Palo Alto City Councilman
Larry Klein, one of the proposal's
two sponsors, agreed that the
policy would in not be legally bin
ding on the University. He said
that any other possible impact on
Stanford "was certainly not in
tended" by the policy sponsors.
But Ellen Fletcher, the other
sponsor of the motion, said she
saw some possibility of influenc
ing a wider range of institutions,
including Stanford, saying, "The
more cities that adopt these
measures, the more pressure on
those who don't."
Michael Schumann, a graduate

of Stanford Law School and foun
der of the Center for Innovative
Diplomacy, was more specific in
describing the possible influence
of a Palo Alto commitment to non
investment in South Africa
involved companies.
"Clearly there are some kind of
impacts it could have," he said,
citing two possibilities.
In adopting such a policy, the
city council would demonstrate to
Stanford its belief that the coun
cil's fiduciary responsibility could
be maintained while paying atten
tion to the social implications of a
particular investment.
Schumann said a decision for
non-investment might help dispel
an "incredibly naive" view of
global politics held by Kennedy.
According to Schumann, Ken
nedy acts under the premise that
foreign affairs do not belong in the
hands of private institutions, but
in the hands of policy-making
bodies such as the Congress;
Schumann believes that an institu
tion such as Stanford "votes with its
money" and thus can have an influ
ence.
The proposal will not have much
economic meaning for Palo Alto,
because the city owns little stock,
and believes its portfolio to be clean
of investments in companies with
business in South Africa, Schumann
said.
