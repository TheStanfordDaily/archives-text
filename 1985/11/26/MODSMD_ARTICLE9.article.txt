"You and I must make a pact..."
Everyone s best wishes to Tim Grieve for a speedy
recovery from the liposuction surgery that kept him
from copy editing last night.
"Won't get fooled again ..."
Or, "She ain't heavy, she's my little sister." Hey, we
understand, it's a long walk from the Deke house to
Santa Barbara. Especially for blondes.

"Who's sorry now ..."
VATICAN CITY — Baie Netzer, hounded by cur
rent and former Daily news editors, arrived here today
and was taken in by the Sisters of Perpetual Mercy.
"So let the sideshow begin, hurry, hurry, step right
on in... "
Stay tuned for the continuing misadventures of the
catfish, the crappie, the flounder, the Maine lobster
and the Sausalito singing fish as they race for the hook.
Here's hoping someone will be brave enough to say,
"Fish or cut bait."
