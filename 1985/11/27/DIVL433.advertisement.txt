"Go see 'My Other Husband.'
A wonderful movie . . . funny, romantic and finally
quite moving. — Peter Stack, S.F/ Chronicle
"My Other Husband' is a breezy,
easy-to-take comedy, acted with
uncommon style.
At the center of the film is Miou-Miou's lovely,
confident performance. The actress plays Alice
with as much intensity as she did the troubled wife
and mother in Diane
