# Cheating: 10 Penalized, 2 Cases Pending
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Twelve students involved in what is pos
sibly the largest cheating scandal in Stan
ford's history have been formally charged
with violating the University's Honor Code
and 10 of them have received penalties, ac
cording to a report released yesterday by
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole.
Six students enrolled in this spring's Psy
chology 1 class received three-quarter
suspensions and no credit, and one non
enrolled student also received a three
quarter suspension. Two other students
received one-quarter suspensions and no
credit.
Another student, "who got credit for a
quiz that was completed in her name by two
other students in the course," received
"the lightest penalty" — a letter of censure
from University President Donald Ken
nedy, no credit for the course and a two
year probation, the report states.
The student "had no advance knowledge
of their behavior (which was, apparently,
unplanned); she did learn about it after the

fact, however, and did nothing to correct
her having received unearned credit," ac
cording to the report.
The cases of two other students are
pending hearings or final decisions.
Cole said she was initially requested to
investigate 24 students in the class, but de
termined that only 12 should be charged
with Honor Code violations.
The report states that the standard
penalty for first-time violations of the
Honor Code is "a one-quarter suspension
and a no credit in the course. A typical
recipient of this set of penalties would be a
freshman who plagarizes a portion of a term
paper in a Western Culture course."
The current case differs from the stan
dard because the cheating included
"unpermitted collaboration . . . and receiv
ing and giving unpermitted aid," according
to Cole's report.
The University has not released the
names of the students charged with Honor
Code violations.
The incidents occurred this spring during
Prof. Philip Zimbardo's introductory psy
chology class, which had an enrollment of
744 students. Twenty-three students were

initially identified in the case through com
parisons of their computer-graded Scantron
answer sheets.
Cole told The Daily that the case is
"possibly the largest instance of violation of
the Honor Code in a single class, at least as
far as I'm aware of."
More than 40 people met with Cole
during the investigation, including "a hand
writing expert; two statisticians who pro
vided probability estimates for quiz
outcomes based upon different assump
tions; students able to provide information
relevant to the behavior of those under
suspicion; and students, faculty and staff
members able to provide more subjective
but equally valuable character assessments
of some of those being scrutinized," the
report said.
Initial suspicion that cheating might have
taken place occurred when Mary Parpal, a
graduate teaching assistant for the class,
received about six anonymous complaints
regarding possible Honor Code violations.
Zimbardo read the class a letter from one
student who was upset about getting a B
in the class while others were cheating and
doing as well or better.

At that point, Zimbardo told that class
that cheating would be dealt with "as
harshly as we know how" and assumed the
problem would end, he said.
During the class' final make-up session,
however, Parpal received two answer
sheets from a single student, each signed
by a different student. A check of the tests
revealed identical answers, and along with
teaching assistant Rose McDermott, Parpal
decided over the summer to check the'
7,000 Scantrons used in the class.
The check showed that tests supposedly
taken by the same student varied signifi
cantly in handwriting, and Parpal turned
over the case and a list of 23 suspects to
Cole. The 24th student was not enrolled.
A problem with the class appears to have
been its large size, which may have
facilitated cheating.
According to Tony James, a Psychology
1 teaching assistant, "there just wasn't
enough space" in Kresge Auditorium for
every student to take the course's weekly
quizzes, and students often left the building
to take the tests on the grass outside the
auditorium.
James, however, noted that students can

take tests outside of lecture halls in any
class, defending the structure of the
course.
"Any test allows for cheating to take
place. It's up to the individual to choose
whether or not to cheat," James said. "I
don't think it was easier to cheat in that
class than any other."
Senior Dawn Curlee, who took Zim
bardo's class this spring, said that although
she was unaware of any cheating taking
place, "it seems feasible that kind of cheat
ing could have gone on given the testing
structure."
Zimbardo told The Daily last night that
"the University has handled the matter
very effectively and dealt with the matter in
a very personal way."
He added, however, that he resented the
"hundreds and hundreds of hours" he and
others involved in the investigation had to
spend on the case because of cheating that
may have saved the accused students "a
few hours of work" in the class.
"We hope that this will be a
consciousness-raising experience for stu
dent and faculty alike with regard to cheat
ing," he said.

of their behavior (which was, apparently,
unplanned); she did learn about it after the

fact, however, and did nothing to correct
her having received unearned credit," ac
cording to the report.
The cases of two other students are
pending hearings or final decisions.
Cole said she was initially requested to
investigate 24 students in the class, but de
termined that only 12 should be charged
with Honor Code violations.
The report states that the standard
penalty for first-time violations of the
Honor Code is "a one-quarter suspension
and a no credit in the course. A typical
recipient of this set of penalties would be a
freshman who plagarizes a portion of a term
paper in a Western Culture course."
The current case differs from the stan
dard because the cheating included
"unpermitted collaboration . . . and receiv
ing and giving unpermitted aid," according
to Cole's report.
The University has not released the
names of the students charged with Honor
Code violations.
The incidents occurred this spring during
Prof. Philip Zimbardo's introductory psy
chology class, which had an enrollment of
744 students. Twenty-three students were

initially identified in the case through com
parisons of their computer-graded Scantron
answer sheets.
Cole told The Daily that the case is
"possibly the largest instance of violation of
the Honor Code in a single class, at least as
far as I'm aware of."
More than 40 people met with Cole
during the investigation, including "a hand
writing expert; two statisticians who pro
vided probability estimates for quiz
outcomes based upon different assump
tions; students able to provide information
relevant to the behavior of those under
suspicion; and students, faculty and staff
members able to provide more subjective
but equally valuable character assessments
of some of those being scrutinized," the
report said.
Initial suspicion that cheating might have
taken place occurred when Mary Parpal, a
graduate teaching assistant for the class,
received about six anonymous complaints
regarding possible Honor Code violations.
Zimbardo read the class a letter from one
student who was upset about getting a B
in the class while others were cheating and
doing as well or better.

At that point, Zimbardo told that class
that cheating would be dealt with "as
harshly as we know how" and assumed the
problem would end, he said.
During the class' final make-up session,
however, Parpal received two answer
sheets from a single student, each signed
by a different student. A check of the tests
revealed identical answers, and along with
teaching assistant Rose McDermott, Parpal
decided over the summer to check the'
7,000 Scantrons used in the class.
The check showed that tests supposedly
taken by the same student varied signifi
cantly in handwriting, and Parpal turned
over the case and a list of 23 suspects to
Cole. The 24th student was not enrolled.
A problem with the class appears to have
been its large size, which may have
facilitated cheating.
According to Tony James, a Psychology
1 teaching assistant, "there just wasn't
enough space" in Kresge Auditorium for
every student to take the course's weekly
quizzes, and students often left the building
to take the tests on the grass outside the
auditorium.
James, however, noted that students can

take tests outside of lecture halls in any
class, defending the structure of the
course.
"Any test allows for cheating to take
place. It's up to the individual to choose
whether or not to cheat," James said. "I
don't think it was easier to cheat in that
class than any other."
Senior Dawn Curlee, who took Zim
bardo's class this spring, said that although
she was unaware of any cheating taking
place, "it seems feasible that kind of cheat
ing could have gone on given the testing
structure."
Zimbardo told The Daily last night that
"the University has handled the matter
very effectively and dealt with the matter in
a very personal way."
He added, however, that he resented the
"hundreds and hundreds of hours" he and
others involved in the investigation had to
spend on the case because of cheating that
may have saved the accused students "a
few hours of work" in the class.
"We hope that this will be a
consciousness-raising experience for stu
dent and faculty alike with regard to cheat
ing," he said.
Twelve students involved in what is pos
sibly the largest cheating scandal in Stan
ford's history have been formally charged
with violating the University's Honor Code
and 10 of them have received penalties, ac
cording to a report released yesterday by
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole.
Six students enrolled in this spring's Psy
chology 1 class received three-quarter
suspensions and no credit, and one non
enrolled student also received a three
quarter suspension. Two other students
received one-quarter suspensions and no
credit.
Another student, "who got credit for a
quiz that was completed in her name by two
other students in the course," received
"the lightest penalty" — a letter of censure
from University President Donald Ken
nedy, no credit for the course and a two
year probation, the report states.
The student "had no advance knowledge
of their behavior (which was, apparently,
unplanned); she did learn about it after the

fact, however, and did nothing to correct
her having received unearned credit," ac
