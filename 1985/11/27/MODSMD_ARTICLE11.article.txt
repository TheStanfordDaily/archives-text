						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Falwell Strikes Again 
### 
On a recent two-day trip to the Philippines, the
Rev. Jerry Falwell displayed, once again, his talent
for embarrassing his country and undermining U.S.
policy — all in the name of awakening "American
people and particularly conservative Christians in
America to the serious threat of Communist expan
sion in the free world."
Following his trip, the leader of the Christian
evangelical group known as the Moral Majority
called the strife-torn Philippines "a paradise" and
"one of the best friends the United States has in the
world." He also hailed President Ferdinand Marcos
and his family saying, "I don't think any fair person
can deny the fact that had it not been for the Marcos
family, the chances are that the freedoms you
[Filipinos] enjoy now would not be here."
His comments in the Philippines echoed his
remarks during his visit to South Africa this summer
when he urged support for the white government of
South African president Pieter Botha and
pronounced the foremost black Anglican bishop,
Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu, a phony.
Fine. One could argue that Falwell, like anyone
else, is entitled to his own nnininn. Rut unlike mo<st

tounsts, Falwell goes abroad with a specific purpose
— to heighten mutual support between the United
States and countries he sees in danger of falling into
communist hands — and with invitations to the
homes of top government officials. This, coupled
with his well-known ties to the Reagan Administra
tion, places him in the position of being regarded as
an unofficial spokesman for the United States.
Whether or not Falwell actually represents the
United States becomes less important than whether
foreign leaders believe that he does. Thus he has a
responsibility first to take the time to become in
formed about the political and social situation in the
countries he visits, to ascertain U.S. foreign policy,
and most important — to assert carefully that he
represents only the Moral Majority and not the U.S.
government.
Clearly, he must be curbed before his single
minded desire to halt the perceived spread of com
munism jeopardizes efforts at achieving peace in
politically unstable regions. Falwell's off-the-cuff
pronouncements cause public embarrassment to the
very Administration he seeks to support.
