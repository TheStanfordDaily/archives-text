# The 						'Balance of Terror' Works

Non-persistent chemical weapons. Low yield
tactical nuclear weapons. Nerve gas. Enhanced
radiation bombs. Ground-launched cruise
missiles. Binary chemical rounds. Biological
warfare.
These are frightening terms. They evoke
powerful images in an age dominated by strong
images of war. These are the intermediate
weapons of the modern battlefield â€” the middle
ground between conventional warfare and global
nuclear exchange. They are the weapons that
may be used if conventional deterrence fails.
For all of their destructive capability, there is
not a lot of discussion about these weapons. The
usual topics of discussion concentrate on the all
powerful, strategic thermonuclear weapons or
conventional weapon inventories. Once in a
while these "intermediate" weapons expose
themselves briefly on the front pages of national
newspapers, but they quickly vanish. However,
this situation is changing.
First, there is the intermediate range nuclear
weapons problem. The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) alliance has expressed
grave concern about the build-up of nuclear force
in their home territories. The Pershing II
missiles and the ground-launched cruise missiles
(GLCMs) have produced a host of debate, and
even slight cracks, in the alliance. Massive peace
rallies have raised questions about whether
these weapons should be deployed in Europe.
Many argue that these weapons are destabilizing
and unnecessary. The Soviet Union charges that
they only contribute to world tensions and help
fuel a new arms race. Some members of
Congress oppose these kind of "battlefield"
weapons and wish to stop funding them. Nothing
could be more wrong.
The Europeans have more to lose in a third
world war in Europe than both the Soviet Union
and the United States. They realize that if deter
rence fails, they will probably have to fight a con
ventional war in West Germany, and will prob
ably lose to the Warsaw Pact countries' greater
numbers. To stave off defeat, NATO would
probably have to resort to using low-yield nu
clear weapons. From there, escalation would un

doubtedly begin. Why then, have the NATO gov
ernments agreed to deployment? The answer is
as simple as it is paradoxical.
The removal of these weapons would in truth
remove the main deterrent that would keep the
Soviet Union at bay during a crisis. If the alliance
had an inferior conventional capability and few if
any nuclear weapons, the Warsaw Pact would
have greater incentive to attack and succeed
than if faced with the possibility of nuclear
response and its grave consequences.

The whole issue rests on deterrence
credibility. The Pershing 2 missile and the
GLCMs, based on European soil by the NATO
allies, can send an unmistakable signal to the So
viet Union that the weapons are ready for use,
and would be used if necessary. This is not to
say that the weapons should be used, but this
thinking can only help in preventing an attack.
Thus, removal of nuclear weapons while main
taining conventional inferiority only invites ag
gression. It is true that if the weapons were
gone there probably would be a "nuclear free"
zone in Europe, but if the Warsaw Pact ever did
attack, the region would become a nuclear-free
zone under Soviet domination.
The same argument applies to the other
categories of weapons: chemical and biological.
During recent appropriations in Congress,
several of our senators tried to halt funding for
chemical weapons research and production. The
terms "nerve gas" and "biological warfare"
frighten our congressional leaders. It seems that
they don't wish to be seen as warmongers fund
ing these incredibly dirty weapons. Yet, if you

ask any arms expert, he or she would tell you
that the greatest producer of these kinds of
weapons by far is the Soviet Union. Unlike our
NATO allies, the Soviets are very well-equipped
to deal with weapons of contamination and main
tain enormous stocks of them. There is also
evidence that these weapons have been used by
the Soviet Union and its allies in Southeast Asia
and Afghanistan.
NATO cannot ignore such a threat. If we have
no capability for retaliation in a like manner, what
would deter their use against our own forces?
Again, deterrence logic would prevail. No com
mander in his right mind would use these weap
ons against an enemy that possessed them.
The logic of proponents of "West German
Greens" or the "nuclear-free Europe" is un
deniably flawed. How can they seriously believe
that if their countries do not possess a certain
weapon capability, it will not be used against
them? The exact opposite is true in military
strategy. If one side is defenseless and incapable
of like retaliation in a certain category, that
weakness will be exploited to the fullest.
The same logic of deterrence must be applied
to tactical and theater nuclear weapons in
Europe. In possessing them we assure the War
saw Pact of our intention to use them if we
needed to do so. The cost of the weapons may
be high, and they may portray the countries that
have them as bellicose and against peace. But
again, the opposite is true. It is only in the desire
for peace that these weapons are built and
deployed, so that they may never be used.
This reminds one of the old "Peacemaker"
bomber deployed in the '50s. People scoffed at
the name of this nuclear bomber, the most
destructive aircraft ever made. Yet during its
service lifetime, it was never used for its pri
mary nuclear role. It lived up to its name in
preserving peace. Hopefully, the production and
deployment of nuclear and chemical weapons in
Europe will serve the same role. The balance of
terror is often hard to accept, but it works.
