## Remember Harvey Milk's Legacy 
### 
Seven years ago today, San
Francisco Superviser Harvey Milk
and Mayor George Moscone were
assassinated. Throughout these
past seven years our mourning has
subsided, but our memories have
not faded.

VIEWPOINT

Harvey Milk's life as an openly
gay superviser inspires in us a
diginity and courage to continue
living our lives as openly and as
sensitively as possible. We ask
people in the Stanford community
to honor the continuing presence of
Milk in our lives by laying flowers at
George Segal's "Gay Liberation"
sculpture today. (The sculpture is
located on the lawn adjacent to the
northeast corner of the Quad.)
As an openly gay leader, Milk left
a lasting message for lesbian and
gay people — that they must come
out of the closet, not just for their
own peace of mind, but also to end
the sense of isolation that so many
other gay and lesbian people exper
ience. At a time when when the
cause of gay and lesbian rights is as

embattled as ever, lesbian and gay
people must be willing to take the
risks that Harvey Milk was willing
to take. We must be openly gay and
lesbian, accessible and willing to
help educate our communities.
Only when more lesbian and gay
people come out can we end the
myth that someone like Harvey
Milk was an oddball, and that his as
sassin, Dan White, was just a regu
lar guy who got himself into a bad
fix.
Today it is important for every
one to remember and be thankful
for the many lesbian and gay people
at Stanford who have courageously
stepped out of the closet and
worked to shatter oppressive
stereotypes and prejudices. It is
also important that we remember
the friends and colleagues whom
we do not yet know as gay and les
bian people. All of us must strive to
make Stanford a place where these
people can come out to us. We
could pay no greater tribute to Har
vey Milk.
