Protester's Photo
Getting Around?
I was arrested for committing
civil disobedience on Oct. 16. A
photograph of me sitting in Old
Union appeared in The Daily the
next day. Last week, I went to
Student Accounting to clear up a
hold on my registration. The per
son helping me opened my file, and
to my amazement there was that
same photograph stapled to my
financial records!
This scares me. Can someone in
the administration please explain
why this photograph is stapled to
my financial records at Student
Accounting? Is it anywhere else?

Pick New Prof.
If Necessary
Many have questioned the ap
parent conflict of interest in having
Law Prof. John Kaplan investigate
the alleged police brutality in the
arrests of anti-apartheid demon
strators. Critics of the report have
noted that Kaplan is a close friend
of University President Donald
Kennedy, and has ties with Chief
of Police Marvin Herrington. While
neither implying that these factors
actually biased Kaplan's report, nor
questioning his integrity, we wish
to point out that several other law

professors are equally qualified,
and their findings would not have
been subject to similar criticism.
We urge Kennedy to consider
asking one of these professors to
undertake any further investiga
tions that may be necessary on this
matter.

Ask RAs About
Their Schedules
Response to my viewpoint on
busy RAs (Nov. 25) was swift and
varied. Some RAs loved it. Others
found my comments "whiny" and
thought the article quite unneces
sary. Like any opinions writer, I
wholly respect and admire the
varied reactions of my peers. I
would like to clarify that my im
petus for writing the piece did not
come from inside myself, but
rather from some other RAs who
felt a bit swamped and helpless,
and who weren't sure how to let
people know how they felt.
I encourage on-campus resi
dents to talk to their RAs â€” ask
them what it is that RAs do that
keep them busy. Ask your RA how
he or she feels juggling his or her
own various responsibilities. Don't
assume that your RA fits my previ
ous description. Ask him or her
personally!
