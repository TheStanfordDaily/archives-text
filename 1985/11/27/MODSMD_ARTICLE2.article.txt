# All 46 Protesters Plead Not Guilty
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
Eight anti-apartheid protesters
arrested at Old Union last month
pleaded not guilty yesterday to mis
demeanor charges at a pre-trial
hearing in the Palo Alto Municipal
Court. All 46 protesters arrested
this fall have now pleaded not
g Appealing before Judge Sfe'pfrcn"
Manley, all the protesters also
waived their right to a speedy trial.
Defendants have the right to a
trial within 45 days of being ar
raigned, but it is not unusual for
defendants released from custody
to waive that right, according to
Deputy Public Defender Gregg
Shores.
Although charges filed against

the protesters vary slightly, all
have been charged with trespass
ing. The 42 protesters arrested on
Oct. 11 and 16 were also charged
with participating in an unlawful as
sembly and refusal to disperse from
an unlawful assembly. The six ar
rests on Oct. 14 were on charges of
refusal to disperse from an unlawful
assembly and refusal to disperse
upon lawful command. Two people
were arrestejd twice.
" TfiiTcEarges are slnuTar "enough
that all defendants could be tried to
gether, according to Shores.
. While many of the protesters
originally were booked with resist
ing arrest, those charges were
never officially pressed, he said.
The defendants were charged
after staging Old Union sit-ins pro
testing the University's invest
ments in companies that do busi
ness in South Africa. The last two
sit-ins also protested the alleged
police brutality of senior Robby
Perkins, who was arrested Oct. 11.
Had the protesters kept their
nght to a speedy trial, they would
have been tried in December. Now,
however, those who decide against
plea bargaining with the district at
torney's office will be tried next
year.
Shores said he recommended
waiving the right to a speedy trial
because it would give the
protesters' attorneys more time to
prepare for the trial.
About a dozen of the protesters
who are financially eligible for a
public defender are currently being
represented by Shores, he said.
Some of the defendants are plan
ning to be represented by two

private attorneys who are donating
their services to the protesters.
Before the trial, Perkins said that
he expected the district attorney's
office to drop all the charges.
But junior Mike Collins said he
had not expected any of the charges
to be dropped. "The last time I
talked to (University President)
Donald Kennedy he seemed to indi
cate they wouldn't," said Collins,
one of three Council of Presidents
members arrested Oct. 16.
"I would love it if the administra
tion surprised me and dropped the
charges," he added.
Manley suggested that the
protesters and the University come
to an agreement on the form that
student protest may take.
Senior David Romo, arrested
Oct. 11, said that if the University
would allow the protesters to at
tend the meetings of Stanford's
Board of Trustees, he would
change his plea to guilty.
Not all the protesters agree with
Romo. Junior Jim Costain, arrested

Oct. 16, said he would welcome
open board meetings and an agree
ment regarding the forms protest
may take in the future, but that he
would not change his plea to guilty if
such an agreement is reached.
Collins said he would have to
carefully consider any agreement
made with the University before
coming to a decision regarding his
plea.
One of the protesters suggested
that the University might be willing
to withdraw its complaint if an
agreement between the two sides
were made.
The district attorney's office
would not necessarily drop all
charges against the protesters if
the University withdrew its com
plaint, according to Shores.
University policy on arrests and
prosecutions, however, states that
"the institution neither 'presses'
nor 'withdraws' charges; nor does it
attempt to persuade or influence
the prosecuting authorities in one
way or another."

week by a federal appeals court — challenging the con
