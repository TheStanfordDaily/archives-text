## A 						Writer's Personal Discovery Of His Primary Fascinations 
### LARRY WEBER Staff writer 
Staff writer Larry Weber attended
a workshop on fascination here over
the weekend and recorded his per
sonal reactions to the program.
What do dogs, writing, baseball,
sex and music have in common,
other than that being some of my
interests?
Upon quick inspection, they
seem unrelated avenues for the
speculations of an individual.
However, each represents
something I find to be wholly en
gaging. Humming a tune with my
sister and ripping a baseball up the
power alley both charge my being.
According to a student in the School
of Education's counseling psychol
ogy doctoral program, an underly
ing want or need might connect the
two.
Nick Nichols claims there are
unique and identifiable reasons
motivating an individual's pursuit of
his or her interests. He calls them
fascinations.
In one of two workshops that he
and colleague Mary Brouillard con
ducted last week to help people de
termine their fascinations, Nichols
said that flying and skiing are two of
his interests, and self-investigation
has shown a feeling of weightless
ness to be what he likes most about
each. Feeling weightless,
therefore, is one of his fascinations.
"If you can get to these fascina
tions, you can determine what is
important to you," Nichols said.
The two, three-hour workshops
tested an exercise that Nichols and
Brouillard developed, as a
"guideline to facilitate people's in
trospection and definitions of what
fascinates them," according to
Nichols.
The exercise was divided into a
written part, in which each partici
pant tried to focus upon the most
satisfying aspects of his or her in
terests, and a group discussion, in
which two or three members
analyze a person's data about his in
terests and help him or her draw
relationships between them.
"We are really trying to do two
things, which are to help people at
one level to understand them
selves and to help them become
proactive so they can predict how
they will feel and react in certain
situations, and then be able to pick
situations that they will find more
purposeful and motivating," Nichols
said.
Like the 11 others who showed
up in Cubberley's room 114 on
Saturday morning, I had a prepared
list in my pocket of activities, topics
and places that have especially in
trigued me in my life. Along with
dogs, music, writing, baseball and
sex, I listed mountains, movies,
photography and cars.
The initial part of the exercise in
volved writing about one's interests
one at a time, given a six-step
framework for focusing on the most

pleasing parts of that interest.
Step one simply identified the in
terest, like writing.
Step two asked the subject to re
member himself or herself in a sit
uation in which the performance of
that interest was "particularly en
joyable." As Brouillard told the
group, being as specific as possible
would spark thoughts and feelings
about the interest and would be vi
tal to an eventual understanding of
its unique importance to an individ
ual.
I remembered a time I wrote a
poem to a girlfriend.
These thoughts and feelings,
"the most enjoyable and interesting
parts of the situation," were re
corded in step three. Brouillard en
couraged workshop participants to
close their eyes and imagine them
selves in their chosen situations.
This would help them focus upon
the immediately important ele
ments of their interests.

I carried a list in
my pocket â€”
mountains, movies,
photography and
cars.

I closed my eyes and imagined I
was back at my cluttered desk,
grinding away at some verse at an
early morning hour. Back in Cub
berley, I wrote on my worksheet,
"Seizing a feeling and trying to
translate this feeling." "Confidence
that it will be understood,"
"difficulty inherent in task," "feeling
of accomplishment and satisfaction
once done" and "desire to share my
poem" soon followed.
Step four asked everyone to take
one element from the step three
lists that might be the "single best
part of the situation." I pared my
list down to the entry, "desire to
share my poem."
Step five was designed to further
focus an interest's most enjoyable
quality by requiring one to choose
an action verb, such as know, feel,
understand or achieve, to describe
the sensation of doing the best part
of the activity.
I decided that sharing my poem
was best described by "to ex
press" something, probably the
emotion that I was trying to
translate in a unique way.
The final step called for the use
of the verb in a sentence, to
"improve your description of the
best part." This was my sentence
to describe the best part of writing:
"To express a feeling, which my
writing has given a unique status, to
others."
In this manner, workshop mem
bers defined their sundry interests,
eventually whittling down potential

reasons for their enjoyment to a
governing one which was reflected
in a single descriptive statement.
When everyone had several in
terests so defined, Nichols told
each person to try and find relation
ships between his interests and to
group them accordingly.
"We will see if we start finding
some commonality," Nichols said.
He said these relationships, for
the analytical person, might be ap
parent results of the six-step
worksheets, such as recurrences in
certain step five verbs. In contrast,
he said, more intuitive people might
discern relationships that they
simply feel exist.
The workshop then broke into
groups of three and four people for
discussions. Each individual pre
sented to others his grouped inter
ests and the information that led up
to his final descriptive statement
about each interest. The group
then tried to assess and further
clarify possible relationships be
tween the interests.
Nichols and members of my
group helped me clarify connections
between music, for which my situa
tion was singing with my sister;
mountains, for which I recalled
camping with friends; and writing.
All of these activities reflected
the importance for me of sharing
feelings and moments with others.
The outline of an "intimate sharing
of feelings" fascination began to
become clear.
Others in the group were more
successful. Bob Hummer had a fas
cination for teamwork in the crea
tive process, in which individual tal
ents perfectly mesh toward a com
mon goal, explicitly defined.
Toward the workshop's end,
Nichols suggested three possible
ways in which the newfound self
knowledge of a fascination can be
applied.
"You can use these fascinations
as a criteria for making decisions,"
he said.
He urged participants to consider
whether certain choices foster or
hinder their opportunities to pursue
what is fascinating to them.
A second application, Nichols
said, is to generate possibilities in
which one might be able to follow a
fascination.
Nichols said that by identifying a
fascination, one's communication
and research skills can improve.
The third way to use this in
creased self-awareness is to im
prove one's current situation, for
example, one's job, Nichols said.
"You can use it (knowledge of
fascinations) to fine-tune situations
to what is more fascinating and less
fascinating," he said. "If you can
identify fascinations, you can see
things you would have missed or
dinarily. "
The limited-enrollment fascina
tion workshops will return in ex
panded six-hour sessions this Janu
ary, with Nichols, Brouillard, and a
third counseling psychology doc
toral student facilitating.
