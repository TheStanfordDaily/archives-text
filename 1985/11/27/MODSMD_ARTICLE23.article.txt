# Feminist Aura Fills Paper

"Aurora is first and foremost a place for women and
women's ideas."
This statement, made by junior Karie Youngdahl, a
contributor to Stanford's feminist publication, explains
what the newspaper Aurora is to its creators and the
message that its creators want to convey to the Stan
ford campus.
Since it was founded during the 1976-77 school year,
Aurora has had a mixed following. Devoted primarily to
voicing women's thoughts on particular issues, the
paper serves to enlighten some readers while it angers
others.
"Aurora has a strong core of women who are sup
porters," said Youngdahl. "While others who pick up
the paper are curious observers who don't know if
feminism is for them. Still others just want to see how
much the paper offends them when they pick it up."
The paper, which is a quarterly, is a com
posite of articles on pertinent issues to women, such as
pornography and rape, and also short stories, poetry
and summaries of current events in the area.
There are certain topics, such as the representation
of women in society, and violence toward women,
that are usually stressed in each issue. "Certain issues
need to be written about a lot, and need to be ex
pressed from a woman's point of view," said senior
Kirsten Swinth, a writer for Aurora.
The paper was much more "radical" in its early
years. Feminism was a new issue to be explored, and
many women were thrilled to be able to express their
opinions on the subject.
"It was a really big deal," said Youngdahl. "There
were about 30 people in the collective who were very
excited to get a chance to voice their opinions. There
was a huge feminist community."

"Then, women were more comfortable about
being separatists," said Swinth. She added that in the
beginning, this isolation was necessary, for feminism
was treated scornfully on the Stanford campus.
To many people, feminism is generally associated
with militant attitudes.
"Militancy is a way in which feminists are des
cribed," Swinth said. "I feel committed to my
feminism, but I choose to go about it in ways that are
not militant."
The tone of-Aurora changes every quarter, and runs
the gamut from mainstream to controversial. This is
the result of the collective process which creates the
newspaper.
The entire group contributes to the writing of
Aurora, and all parts of the production are accom
plished by group effort. The editorial policy is also
created by the collective, with all members voicing
their opinions.
The collective process which produces Aurora is the
result of a conscious decision not to have the paper
produced in a hierarchical manner. It is important that
women are free to say what they please in the paper,
for it is their outlet.
"Aurora is a very personal thing," said Youngdahl.
"The paper is the people, and the people are the paper.
You can't separate the two."
Aurora is the product of a group of women who ex
pressed strong feelings about the importance of learn
ing and growing in this group.
"It is the feeling of support that you get — the build
ing of your awareness of being a woman," said
Youngdahl. She went on to say that many Aurora mem
bers go on to write for other feminist newspapers.
Feminism is not something that they pursue only
during their college years, but it is something that
stays with them, she said.
