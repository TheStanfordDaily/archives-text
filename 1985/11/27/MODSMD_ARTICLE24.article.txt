# Apprentice Archaeologists Dig Into Classics

### SHARI BRADFORD 
Interested in archaeology?
Majoring in classics? Taking West
ern Culture and wondering where
all that mythology stuff took place?
You might be interested in the
Stanford-in-Greece program. It's
an archaeological study program in
Greece offered by the Classics De
partment every summer. The pro
gram, led by Classics Prof. Mark
Munn and his wife, Mary Lou
Munn, gives up to eight Stanford
students an opportunity to become
acquainted first hand with the his
tory and monuments of Greece,
from prehistoric to modern times.
The Stanford-in-Greece program
is not like most Stanford overseas
programs. According to Mark
Munn, "The program differs from
the other Stanford programs over
seas because of the simple Greek
lifestyle which is rarely found in
America, or even in other parts of
Europe."
The structure of the program is
also different in that Stanford-in-
Greece is geared toward a travel
ing study tour with a fieldwork proj
ect. "Whenever possible, we do try

to get students involved in ar
chaeological field research," he
said.
The small size of the group, only
eight students, allows the partici
pants to get to know each other in
timately, and "to have somewhat of
a variety without dividing into
cliques," Munn said.
The Stanford-in-Greece program
visits such sites as the monuments
of ancient Athens, Bronze Age
fortresses of Mycenae and Tyryns
and the classical sanctuaries of
Delphi and Olympia. In addition to
well-known sites on the main
tourist circuit, sites off the beaten
path on the back roads of Greece
are also visited; students might also
find themselves enjoying a sunrise
or sunset from a mountain top
shared only by goats, or an after
noon swim on a secluded Aegean
bay.
Although Stanford-in-Greece
may sound like that relaxing sum
mer vacation you've been waiting
for, it's not all fun and games. The
Stanford-in-Greece program is a
serious educational venture, with a
competitive admissions process and
considerable physical exertion in
very hot weather.

The five-week program is open
to Stanford undergraduates of all
majors. However, some introduc
tion to modern Greek and Greek
topography is necessary, and pre
liminary Stanford classics courses
are required.

While in Greece, students attend
lectures given by the Munns and,
whenever possible, by guest lectur
ers at the sites of their excavations.
Past Stanford-in-Greece ar
chaeological projects have included
the Argoloid Exploration Project

under the direction of Prof. Michael
Jameson and Prof. Tjeerd Van An
del in 1979-82, and the Stanford
Skourta Plain Project in 1985.
The Skourta plain, a mountain
basin near Attica, was disputed
throughout much of antiquity be
tween the Athenians and the
Boiotians. Little has been known
archaeologically of this pivotal fron
tier region, which is still remote and
undeveloped.
The Stanford Skourta Plain Proj
ect undertook to study the surface
remains of prehistoric through
medieval times in order to recover
evidence of the nature of settle
ments of this region and to clarify
its changing relationship to Athens
and Boiotia.
During three weeks of fieldwork,
the 1985 Stanford-in-Greece group
studied 20 sites including digs from
the Bronze Age, the Dark Age,
settlements from the Classical and
Early Hellenistic periods, late
Roman settlements and the late
Medieval period.
The results of this summer's
work will enable the group to begin
formulating a history of the area;
future seasons will yield much more
data, particularly on the chang

ing life of the ancient Athenians and
their relationships with neighboring
states.
Past participants in the program
agreed that Stanford-in-Greece was
a rewarding experience. Senior
Ben Vaughan, a classics major and a
participant in 1984 said, "I found
out about it on a flier. My adviser
told me that it was something that
all classics majors should try to do.
"The program helped to substan
tiate all that I'd been reading about
and looking at in books. It added a
lot to my learning experience to
study that in Western Culture and
then actually see it in person. It
helped me out a lot," he said.
Penny Weingarten, a graduate
student in anthropology, was a par
ticipant last summer. She acted as a
liaison between the villagers near
the excavation site and the partici
pants.
"For me, it was a real first hand
look and feel of archaeology and cul
tural anthropology," she said.
Bret Larimer, another classics
major, said, "It was a chance to see
where all the classical history
you've read about actually took
place. If you're interested in Greek
history, it's well worth going."

also different in that Stanford-in-
Greece is geared toward a travel
ing study tour with a fieldwork proj
ect. "Whenever possible, we do try

to get students involved in ar
chaeological field research," he
said.
The small size of the group, only
eight students, allows the partici
pants to get to know each other in
timately, and "to have somewhat of
a variety without dividing into
cliques," Munn said.
The Stanford-in-Greece program
visits such sites as the monuments
of ancient Athens, Bronze Age
fortresses of Mycenae and Tyryns
and the classical sanctuaries of
Delphi and Olympia. In addition to
well-known sites on the main
tourist circuit, sites off the beaten
path on the back roads of Greece
are also visited; students might also
find themselves enjoying a sunrise
or sunset from a mountain top
shared only by goats, or an after
noon swim on a secluded Aegean
bay.
Although Stanford-in-Greece
may sound like that relaxing sum
mer vacation you've been waiting
for, it's not all fun and games. The
Stanford-in-Greece program is a
serious educational venture, with a
competitive admissions process and
considerable physical exertion in
very hot weather.

The five-week program is open
to Stanford undergraduates of all
majors. However, some introduc
tion to modern Greek and Greek
topography is necessary, and pre
liminary Stanford classics courses
are required.

While in Greece, students attend
lectures given by the Munns and,
whenever possible, by guest lectur
ers at the sites of their excavations.
Past Stanford-in-Greece ar
chaeological projects have included
the Argoloid Exploration Project

under the direction of Prof. Michael
Jameson and Prof. Tjeerd Van An
del in 1979-82, and the Stanford
Skourta Plain Project in 1985.
The Skourta plain, a mountain
basin near Attica, was disputed
throughout much of antiquity be
tween the Athenians and the
Boiotians. Little has been known
archaeologically of this pivotal fron
tier region, which is still remote and
undeveloped.
The Stanford Skourta Plain Proj
ect undertook to study the surface
remains of prehistoric through
medieval times in order to recover
evidence of the nature of settle
ments of this region and to clarify
its changing relationship to Athens
and Boiotia.
During three weeks of fieldwork,
the 1985 Stanford-in-Greece group
studied 20 sites including digs from
the Bronze Age, the Dark Age,
settlements from the Classical and
Early Hellenistic periods, late
Roman settlements and the late
Medieval period.
The results of this summer's
work will enable the group to begin
formulating a history of the area;
future seasons will yield much more
data, particularly on the chang

ing life of the ancient Athenians and
their relationships with neighboring
states.
Past participants in the program
agreed that Stanford-in-Greece was
a rewarding experience. Senior
Ben Vaughan, a classics major and a
participant in 1984 said, "I found
out about it on a flier. My adviser
told me that it was something that
all classics majors should try to do.
"The program helped to substan
tiate all that I'd been reading about
and looking at in books. It added a
lot to my learning experience to
study that in Western Culture and
then actually see it in person. It
helped me out a lot," he said.
Penny Weingarten, a graduate
student in anthropology, was a par
ticipant last summer. She acted as a
liaison between the villagers near
the excavation site and the partici
pants.
"For me, it was a real first hand
look and feel of archaeology and cul
tural anthropology," she said.
Bret Larimer, another classics
major, said, "It was a chance to see
where all the classical history
you've read about actually took
place. If you're interested in Greek
history, it's well worth going."

Interested in archaeology?
Majoring in classics? Taking West
ern Culture and wondering where
all that mythology stuff took place?
You might be interested in the
Stanford-in-Greece program. It's
an archaeological study program in
Greece offered by the Classics De
partment every summer. The pro
gram, led by Classics Prof. Mark
Munn and his wife, Mary Lou
Munn, gives up to eight Stanford
students an opportunity to become
acquainted first hand with the his
tory and monuments of Greece,
from prehistoric to modern times.
The Stanford-in-Greece program
is not like most Stanford overseas
programs. According to Mark
Munn, "The program differs from
the other Stanford programs over
seas because of the simple Greek
lifestyle which is rarely found in
America, or even in other parts of
Europe."
The structure of the program is
also different in that Stanford-in-
Greece is geared toward a travel
ing study tour with a fieldwork proj
ect. "Whenever possible, we do try
