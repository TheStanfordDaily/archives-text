## Eyes Open Window On Brain Disorders 
### DAVID LIPPEATT Editorial staff 
The eyes of schizophrenics may
hold a key to detecting and under
standing biochemical problems un
derlying many disorders in the
human body, including possibly
schizophrenia itself.
A new study, which is part of a
larger project funded by a grant
recently awarded to Dr. Michael
Marmor, head of the division of op
thamology at the Stanford Medical
Center, seeks to obtain clues about
biochemical imbalances in the body.
This will be done by looking at pat
terns of change in the electrical sig
nals produced by the light-sensing
cells of the retina and its supporting
tissue.
In collaboration with psychia
trists at Stanford and the Palo Alto
Veterans Administration Medical
Center, Marmor is using an
Electroretinogram (ERG) to mea
sure the electrical signals in the
retinas of both normal volunteers
and psychiatrically diagnosed

schizophrenics.
The readings obtained are
analyzed in an effort to detect dif
ferences in the dopamine level.
Dopamine is one of the chemical
messengers of the brain; it is also
found in retinal tissue.
Marmor is looking specifically at
the oscillatory potential, a signal
which is directly related to
dopaminergic function. The actual
process involves placing a contact
lens carrying an electrode directly
onto the eye. This can detect the
oscillatory potential, which is
produced as retinal cells convert
light into signals they then relay to
the brain.
This technique could prove
highly revealing. "We are trying to
pick up a dopaminergic or synaptic
abnormality in the retina on the hy
pothesis that the defect may not be
limited to the brain itself," Marmor
said. Synapses are the gaps be
tween nerve cells across which
electrical impulses must pass.
These "defects" indicated by
dopamine imbalances could stem
from a number of disorders. Ac

cording to Dr. Gail Schechter, a
member of the research team
working with Marmor, "There is
some evidence suggesting a
dopaminergic dysfunction in schizo
phrenic disorders."
Thus the ERGs, when correlated
with other factors, may help deter
mine the presence of schizophre
nia.
Marmor and his team, which in
cludes Dr. Philip Berger, director
of the Norris Mental Health Clinical
Research Center, Dr. Adolf Pfef
ferbaum, Dr. Peggy Hook and
Schechter, are also investigating
the possibility that an effective
treatment or drug used on a schizo
phrenic patient would cause the os
cillatory potential, as measured by
the ERG, to return to normal. This
would aid doctors tremendously
during patient treatment.
The pigment epithelium of the
eye, which is a layer of dark
colored supportive tissue lining the
retina, is also a major focus of Mar
mor's studies. Many eye diseases
cause the pigment epithelium to

break down, thus impairing visual
function. Marmor is attempting to
use a technique similar to the ERG
to measure the responses of cells in
the pigment epithelium. Eventually,
he will try to develop specific tests
which would indicate if this tissue is
functioning properly.
A grant totalling $206,847 has
been given to Marmor by the Na

tional Eye Institute for his studies
of electrical impulses in the eye.
Out of this, $69,141 has been ear
marked for the first year of work
A separate grant from the Vet
eran's Administration Hospital has
been given to the Schizophrenic
Biologic Research Center in Palo
Alto, under the direction of Berger,
for this and other research associ

ated with schizophrenia.
Marmor stressed the importance
of his studies. "For a long time
mental disease was (thought to be)
just mental. Now we're looking for
the biological basis for these
diseases," he said.
With this knowledge, he added,
"we can then look for biochemical
problems in the body as a whole."
