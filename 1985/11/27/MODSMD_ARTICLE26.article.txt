## It's Thanksgiving as Card Gobbles GWU 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
It may not have been the pret
tiest win, but for the Stanford
men's basketball team, it was a
good way to start the 1985-86
season. The Cardinal got a balanced
scoring attack and forced 22 turn
overs with its pressure defense to
defeat George Washington 87-72 in
its opener as 5,225 looked on at
Maples Pavilion.
"You're never sure how good an
opponent is coming in, and then
you're not sure how good a win it
is," Stanford Coach Tom Davis
said. "You don't want to put too
much emphasis on it if the opponent
wasn't that good, but then again
you don't want to underestimate
them."
The Colonials, now 1-1, were
picked by Sports Illustrated to
finish fifth in the Atlantic 10 Confer
ence and returned 10 lettermen, in
cluding seven seniors, but they had
a hard time getting untracked
against the full-court pressure that
Stanford uses on defense.
"I think they played well," Stan
ford guard Keith Ramee said. "I
just think our pressure defense got
to them. They've probably never
seen something like it before."
"I think it flustered them a little
bit," said Cardinal forward Todd
Lichti, who led Stanford with 15
points in his first collegiate game.
"We didn't have a lot of steals, but
we had a lot of deflections, and so
we were that close to that many
more steals."
Meanwhile, the Stanford offense
had its own problems, turning the
ball over 24 times itself, but got into
fast-break situations often enough
to stay comfortably ahead of
George Washington.
"Our break got a lot of those
points," forward Earl Koberlein
said. "One of our weaknesses was
that when we got into our set of
fense, we tended to turn it over
some."

The Cardinal never trailed,
taking a 16-14 lead on a Koberlein
layup with 10:27 left in the first half
en route to a 34-28 halftime lead.
The Colonials never got closer than
four, and Stanford, as Ramee put it,
"nickeled and dimed them" to open
a 20-point lead at 63-43 and coast
home.
The big lead gave Davis the
chance to play guard John Paye,
who had only two practices under
his belt since joining the team the
day after football ended. Paye,
wearing No. 15 instead of his usual
No. 14 — "They didn't make up a
14 for me," he explained — came in
with three minutes left to an ova
tion and left with five points.
For George Washington, it was
not a total waste of a 3,000-mile
road trip from the nation's capital.
"They showed us some areas
we've got to work on," Coach John
Kuester said after his first game at
the helm of the Colonials. "We've
got a difficult conference, and we
want to play teams like that."
Kuester was disappointed with
his team's inconsistency. "We were
right there at the beginning," he
said. "The kids played well, but we
gave them too many easy shots,
and that'll kill you. For 25, maybe
30 minutes max, we played good
basketball. You can't turn the ball
over against a team like Stanford —
they'll take advantage of it."
Lichti was one of four Cardinal
players in double figures. Guard
Novian Whitsitt had 12 points, cen
ter Howard Wright had 11 and cen
ter Eric Reveno had 10.
"There wasn't a whole lot of
pressure," Lichti said of his first
game in the cardinal and white, "but
I felt some. I'm pretty confident I
can play Division I basketball. If you
back down to those guys, they'll
take it to you. You can't let them
know you're intimidated or they'll
take advantage of you."

Kenny Barer, Moti Daniel and Chester Wood all had 10
for the Colonials, who shot only 42 percent from the
field on the night.
Davis had worried about the Cardinal's rebounding
coming into the game, but Stanford ended up even with
George Washington, with both sides pulling down 38
boards. Koberlein had seven rebounds and center
Greg Butler had six for Stanford.
The new 45-second clock didn't prove to be much of
a factor in its first trial at Stanford. "It only becomes a
factor when the ball is knocked out of bounds," Davis
said. "It's really not going to affect a team like us." The
only times Stanford was forced to hurry a shot were

when the clock was reset to five seconds after a deflec
tion out of bounds.
The Cardinal travels today to Toronto to face Water
loo and Toronto on Friday and Saturday in a pair of
games against Canadian foes.
"I think the situation's pretty good," Davis said.
"Now we get to go up to Canada and play two teams
with little different officiating and different rules.
"They would be good Division I clubs in this country,
but maybe not as deep. It should be a great experience
for the kids. I'm not taking them lightly. It's important
to get the two wins, and the other thing is to learn and
grow as a team."
The Cardinal's next home game is Monday against
UC-San Diego, a Division 111 team that has an easy tri
umph in the past. The Apple Invitational is next Friday
and Saturday, with Richmond, Yale and St. Mary's
rounding out the field this year.

Lichti, who led Stanford with 15
points in his first collegiate game.
"We didn't have a lot of steals, but
we had a lot of deflections, and so
we were that close to that many
more steals."
Meanwhile, the Stanford offense
had its own problems, turning the
ball over 24 times itself, but got into
fast-break situations often enough
to stay comfortably ahead of
George Washington.
"Our break got a lot of those
points," forward Earl Koberlein
said. "One of our weaknesses was
that when we got into our set of
fense, we tended to turn it over
some."

The Cardinal never trailed,
taking a 16-14 lead on a Koberlein
layup with 10:27 left in the first half
en route to a 34-28 halftime lead.
The Colonials never got closer than
four, and Stanford, as Ramee put it,
"nickeled and dimed them" to open
a 20-point lead at 63-43 and coast
home.
The big lead gave Davis the
chance to play guard John Paye,
who had only two practices under
his belt since joining the team the
day after football ended. Paye,
wearing No. 15 instead of his usual
No. 14 — "They didn't make up a
14 for me," he explained — came in
with three minutes left to an ova
tion and left with five points.
For George Washington, it was
not a total waste of a 3,000-mile
road trip from the nation's capital.
"They showed us some areas
we've got to work on," Coach John
Kuester said after his first game at
the helm of the Colonials. "We've
got a difficult conference, and we
want to play teams like that."
Kuester was disappointed with
his team's inconsistency. "We were
right there at the beginning," he
said. "The kids played well, but we
gave them too many easy shots,
and that'll kill you. For 25, maybe
30 minutes max, we played good
basketball. You can't turn the ball
over against a team like Stanford —
they'll take advantage of it."
Lichti was one of four Cardinal
players in double figures. Guard
Novian Whitsitt had 12 points, cen
ter Howard Wright had 11 and cen
ter Eric Reveno had 10.
"There wasn't a whole lot of
pressure," Lichti said of his first
game in the cardinal and white, "but
I felt some. I'm pretty confident I
can play Division I basketball. If you
back down to those guys, they'll
take it to you. You can't let them
know you're intimidated or they'll
take advantage of you."

lead all scorers. Guard Troy Webster added 15, and

for the Colonials, who shot only 42 percent from the
field on the night.
Davis had worried about the Cardinal's rebounding
coming into the game, but Stanford ended up even with
George Washington, with both sides pulling down 38
boards. Koberlein had seven rebounds and center
Greg Butler had six for Stanford.
The new 45-second clock didn't prove to be much of
a factor in its first trial at Stanford. "It only becomes a
factor when the ball is knocked out of bounds," Davis
said. "It's really not going to affect a team like us." The
only times Stanford was forced to hurry a shot were

when the clock was reset to five seconds after a deflec
tion out of bounds.
The Cardinal travels today to Toronto to face Water
loo and Toronto on Friday and Saturday in a pair of
games against Canadian foes.
"I think the situation's pretty good," Davis said.
"Now we get to go up to Canada and play two teams
with little different officiating and different rules.
"They would be good Division I clubs in this country,
but maybe not as deep. It should be a great experience
for the kids. I'm not taking them lightly. It's important
to get the two wins, and the other thing is to learn and
grow as a team."
The Cardinal's next home game is Monday against
UC-San Diego, a Division 111 team that has an easy tri
umph in the past. The Apple Invitational is next Friday
and Saturday, with Richmond, Yale and St. Mary's
rounding out the field this year.
It may not have been the pret
tiest win, but for the Stanford
men's basketball team, it was a
good way to start the 1985-86
season. The Cardinal got a balanced
scoring attack and forced 22 turn
overs with its pressure defense to
defeat George Washington 87-72 in
its opener as 5,225 looked on at
Maples Pavilion.
"You're never sure how good an
opponent is coming in, and then
you're not sure how good a win it
is," Stanford Coach Tom Davis
said. "You don't want to put too
much emphasis on it if the opponent
wasn't that good, but then again
you don't want to underestimate
them."
The Colonials, now 1-1, were
picked by Sports Illustrated to
finish fifth in the Atlantic 10 Confer
ence and returned 10 lettermen, in
cluding seven seniors, but they had
a hard time getting untracked
against the full-court pressure that
Stanford uses on defense.
"I think they played well," Stan
ford guard Keith Ramee said. "I
just think our pressure defense got
to them. They've probably never
seen something like it before."
"I think it flustered them a little
bit," said Cardinal forward Todd
Lichti, who led Stanford with 15
points in his first collegiate game.
"We didn't have a lot of steals, but
