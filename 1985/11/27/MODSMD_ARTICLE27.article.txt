# Cagers Fall 60-56 To Santa Clara

SANTA CLARA — Point-guard Michele
Tahara is the Virginia Sourlis of the Santa
Clara Broncos.
"She's an excellent ball-handler and a great
leader," said Bronco Coach Ken Thompson.
"She possesses all the abilities that a point
guard should have."
And then some.
Like her counterpart from Stanford, she
runs the offense, scores baskets and makes
steals. She's small (5-foot-3), quick and ag
gressive. But most importantly, she's a
leader.
Tahara's leadership was very apparent last
night at Toso Pavilion as she helped push the
Broncos past the Stanford Cardinal 60-56.
The Broncos, shooting a measly 25 per
cent (8-of-31) from the field during the first
half, could have let Stanford run away with
the contest. However, Tahara's nine first
half points on aggressive drives to the hoop
kept the Broncos within reach 29-26.
Stanford fared a little better from the field
at 40 percent, but the play of Tahara and the
Bronco's edge in rebounding, 22-to-15,
negated any Cardinal shooting advantage.
Sourlis led all scorers with 10 points.
A balanced Bronco scoring attack emerged
in the second stanza as standouts Suzy and
Cindy Meckenstock, along with 6-1 forward
Dorinda Lindstrom, asserted themselves of
fensively.
Suzy Meckenstock, a 5-10 guard, started
the second half with three quick baskets. Her
sister Cindy, a 6-0 forward, broke her first
half scoring slump with a three-point play.
After a nice move underneath the basket by
Lindstrom, Santa Clara had a comfortable 42-
34 lead with 11:20 left to play.

Led by Sourlis, Stanford struggled back to
a 50-48 lead with 5:20 to go, but a few Meck
enstock hoops and a small Stanford scoring
drought gave the Broncos a commanding 59-
52 lead with a minute left to play.
But the Cardinal didn't relent as a pair of
Kim Mercer free throws and a swarming full
court press put the Cardinal within striking
distance with 38 seconds left to play 59-56.
Stanford appeared to be on its way to an
other scoring opportunity as a shot by Bronco
captain Regina Reilly deflected off the rim
toward the sideline, but well within reach of
Stanford's Mercer. But as the 6-0 forward
scampered after the apparent rebound,
Tahara slipped through and took the ball away
from Mercer's grasp and dribbled out the rest
of the clock.
Throughout the entire game, Stanford
seemed troubled by an aggressive man-on
man defense which, at critical junctures,
prevented any semblance of offensive conti
nuity.
"Unless we get JiU (Yanke), Evon (Asforis)
and Kim scoring one-on-one in the post, the
offense is going to suffer," said Stanford
Coach Tara VanDerveer. "We'll continue to
lack any offensive continuity. Virginia
(Sourlis) does a lot on her own. Just think
how good things would be if the team was a
little more balanced."
"We've used it (the man-on-man defense)
exclusively during our first two games,"
Thompson said. "We feel our players are ag
gressive and hard-working, so I think this
kind of defense works best for us."
Suzy Meckenstock, Lindstrom, and Tahara
led the now 1-1 Broncos with 14, 13, and 12
points, respectively. Sourlis contributed a
game-high 20 points for Stanford.
Next for the 1-2 Cardinal will be a Friday
night contest with the University of San Fran
cisco Dons on the road.
