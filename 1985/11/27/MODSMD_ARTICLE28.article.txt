# Polo Poised for NCAAs
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff writer 
This could be the year for the Stanford water
polo team.
Entering the NCAA Championships with the No.
1 seed and more NCAA experience than any other
competing team, the Cardinal has a very good
chance of walking away from Long Beach this
weekend with a national title.
Add in the fact that last year's champion, UC-
Berkeley, did not qualify for the event, and the
Cardinal's future seems even brighter.
The championships, to be held Nov. 29-31
in Long Beach, feature five California teams and
three out-of-state teams competing in a single
elimination tournament.
Going in, Stanford tops the rankings with a 22-4
record, followed by UC-Irvine (21-7), UCLA (21-5),
Long Beach State (21-9), UC-Santa Barbara (20-9),
Loyola of Chicago (8-7), Brown (19-5) and Bucknell
(20-5).
Reaping the rewards of the top seed, Stanford
will play the bottom seed, Bucknell, in its first match
of the tournament on Friday at 3 p.m. at the Bel
monte Pool Plaza.
"Our first match will basically give us a chance to
get used to the (indoor pool) conditions, sharpen our
game up and start our momentum going," Stanford
Coach Dante Dettamanti said.
"We won't be taking it easy by any means, but we
shouldn't have too much of a problem as Bucknell
has had virtually no experience this season in
playing California teams. The West Coast teams
play with much more intensity and at a faster tempo,
so it will take Bucknell a few games to adjust," he
said.
Although Bucknell has had little West Coast ex
perience, the team did capture the Mid-Atlantic
League title and finished second in the Eastern
Championships. Bucknell is led by co-captains Jeff
Hilk, the team's leading scorer with 97 goals, and

manti hopes his team will have against Bucknell Saturday.
"We won't take it easy by any means," Dettamanti said.
Paul Duffy. Freshman Garrin
Kapecki is Bucknell's second
leading scorer with 61 goals.
If Stanford survives its first
game, it will compete Saturday at 6
p.m. against the winner of the Long
Beach-Santa Barbara match.
According to Dettamanti, it is al
most impossible to predict which
team the Cardinal will face on Sat
urday because Long Beach and
Santa Barbara match up well.
"Both teams have good fast
breaks, depth and quick players,
and both are fairly decent in the
hole," Dettamanti said. "Because
the style and personality of the two
teams is identical, it really doesn't
make any difference which team we
play."
Stanford has played both Long
Beach and Santa Barbara twice this
year, compiling 1-1 records against
each. Both losses were overtime
matches decided by one goal.
"The second match is the most
important one of the tournament,"
Dettamanti said. "Once you get
past that one, the final takes care of
itself. If you don't win the second
game, you can't even think about

the final."
Despite the fact that Dettamanti
tries not to look past the second
game to the finals, the fact remains
that the Cardinal is highly favored
to play in the 7:30 final on Sunday
night.
Stanford will start freshman
goalie Todd Kemp throughout the
tournament. Although he is a new
comer to NCAA action, Dettamanti
has few worries about Kemp's abil
ity to hold up under the pressure.
"Todd has no tendency what
soever to break under pressure,"
Dettamanti said. "He just hates to
let the ball go in the goal; he doesn't
care if it's in practice or in the
NCAA final, he'll play the same."
Dettamanti has confidence in his
defense, but he is concerned about
the Cardinal's recent offensive
woes.
"I'm not at all worried about
stopping the other teams, I'm
worried about them stopping us,"
Dettamanti said. "It hasn't been a
real problem, but we have been
scoring fewer goals in the last few
games than is normal for us.
"If we play our own game and
take over offensively, I know we
can take the NCAA title. We have
the talent, the experience and the
motivation. This is our year."


Stanford's defense has been the least of Coach Dante Detta
manti's concerns. "I'm not worried at all about stopping the

other teams," Dettamanti said. "I'm worried about them stop
ping us."

tournament. Although he is a new
comer to NCAA action, Dettamanti
has few worries about Kemp's abil
ity to hold up under the pressure.
"Todd has no tendency what
soever to break under pressure,"
Dettamanti said. "He just hates to
let the ball go in the goal; he doesn't
care if it's in practice or in the
NCAA final, he'll play the same."
Dettamanti has confidence in his
defense, but he is concerned about
the Cardinal's recent offensive
woes.
"I'm not at all worried about
stopping the other teams, I'm
worried about them stopping us,"
Dettamanti said. "It hasn't been a
real problem, but we have been
scoring fewer goals in the last few
games than is normal for us.
"If we play our own game and
take over offensively, I know we
can take the NCAA title. We have
the talent, the experience and the
motivation. This is our year."


Stanford's defense has been the least of Coach Dante Detta
manti's concerns. "I'm not worried at all about stopping the

This could be the year for the Stanford water
polo team.
Entering the NCAA Championships with the No.
1 seed and more NCAA experience than any other
competing team, the Cardinal has a very good
chance of walking away from Long Beach this
weekend with a national title.
Add in the fact that last year's champion, UC-
Berkeley, did not qualify for the event, and the
Cardinal's future seems even brighter.
The championships, to be held Nov. 29-31
in Long Beach, feature five California teams and
three out-of-state teams competing in a single
elimination tournament.
Going in, Stanford tops the rankings with a 22-4
record, followed by UC-Irvine (21-7), UCLA (21-5),
Long Beach State (21-9), UC-Santa Barbara (20-9),
Loyola of Chicago (8-7), Brown (19-5) and Bucknell
(20-5).
Reaping the rewards of the top seed, Stanford
will play the bottom seed, Bucknell, in its first match
of the tournament on Friday at 3 p.m. at the Bel
monte Pool Plaza.
"Our first match will basically give us a chance to
get used to the (indoor pool) conditions, sharpen our
game up and start our momentum going," Stanford
Coach Dante Dettamanti said.
"We won't be taking it easy by any means, but we
shouldn't have too much of a problem as Bucknell
has had virtually no experience this season in
playing California teams. The West Coast teams
play with much more intensity and at a faster tempo,
so it will take Bucknell a few games to adjust," he
said.
Although Bucknell has had little West Coast ex
perience, the team did capture the Mid-Atlantic
League title and finished second in the Eastern
Championships. Bucknell is led by co-captains Jeff
Hilk, the team's leading scorer with 97 goals, and

Paul Duffy. Freshman Garrin
Kapecki is Bucknell's second
leading scorer with 61 goals.
If Stanford survives its first
game, it will compete Saturday at 6
p.m. against the winner of the Long
Beach-Santa Barbara match.
According to Dettamanti, it is al
most impossible to predict which
team the Cardinal will face on Sat
urday because Long Beach and
Santa Barbara match up well.
"Both teams have good fast
breaks, depth and quick players,
and both are fairly decent in the
hole," Dettamanti said. "Because
the style and personality of the two
teams is identical, it really doesn't
make any difference which team we
play."
Stanford has played both Long
Beach and Santa Barbara twice this
year, compiling 1-1 records against
each. Both losses were overtime
matches decided by one goal.
"The second match is the most
important one of the tournament,"
Dettamanti said. "Once you get
past that one, the final takes care of
itself. If you don't win the second
game, you can't even think about

the final."
Despite the fact that Dettamanti
tries not to look past the second
game to the finals, the fact remains
that the Cardinal is highly favored
to play in the 7:30 final on Sunday
night.
Stanford will start freshman
goalie Todd Kemp throughout the
tournament. Although he is a new
comer to NCAA action, Dettamanti
has few worries about Kemp's abil
ity to hold up under the pressure.
"Todd has no tendency what
soever to break under pressure,"
Dettamanti said. "He just hates to
let the ball go in the goal; he doesn't
care if it's in practice or in the
NCAA final, he'll play the same."
