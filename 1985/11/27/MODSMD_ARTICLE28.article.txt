# Polo Poised for NCAAs

### INGRID SEYER Staff writer 
This could be the year for the Stanford water
polo team.
Entering the NCAA Championships with the No.
1 seed and more NCAA experience than any other
competing team, the Cardinal has a very good
chance of walking away from Long Beach this
weekend with a national title.
Add in the fact that last year's champion, UC-
Berkeley, did not qualify for the event, and the
Cardinal's future seems even brighter.
The championships, to be held Nov. 29-31
in Long Beach, feature five California teams and
three out-of-state teams competing in a single
elimination tournament.
Going in, Stanford tops the rankings with a 22-4
record, followed by UC-Irvine (21-7), UCLA (21-5),
Long Beach State (21-9), UC-Santa Barbara (20-9),
Loyola of Chicago (8-7), Brown (19-5) and Bucknell
(20-5).
Reaping the rewards of the top seed, Stanford
will play the bottom seed, Bucknell, in its first match
of the tournament on Friday at 3 p.m. at the Bel
monte Pool Plaza.
"Our first match will basically give us a chance to
get used to the (indoor pool) conditions, sharpen our
game up and start our momentum going," Stanford
Coach Dante Dettamanti said.
"We won't be taking it easy by any means, but we
shouldn't have too much of a problem as Bucknell
has had virtually no experience this season in
playing California teams. The West Coast teams
play with much more intensity and at a faster tempo,
so it will take Bucknell a few games to adjust," he
said.
Although Bucknell has had little West Coast ex
perience, the team did capture the Mid-Atlantic
League title and finished second in the Eastern
Championships. Bucknell is led by co-captains Jeff
Hilk, the team's leading scorer with 97 goals, and

Greg Gamble displays the intensity that Coach Dante Detta
manti hopes his team will have against Bucknell Saturday.
"We won't take it easy by any means," Dettamanti said.
