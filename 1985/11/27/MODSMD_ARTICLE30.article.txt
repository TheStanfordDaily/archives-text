# Swimmers To Compete in LA
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Staff writer 
The University of Southern California nearly
cooked itself a turkey of a swim meet by switch
ing its Western States Invite to Thanksgiving
weekend, but several Stanford swimmers are
nevertheless expected to work off holiday meals
in the two-day event.
Last year the meet was known as the Pac-10
Invite and was held after Thanksgiving. The
post-holiday timing gave Stanford's large fresh

man contigent a chance to get a taste of major
college competition during the fall quarter.
"Last year the meet was a week later and was
actually the first real meet for the freshmen to
compete in," Asst. Coach Ted Knapp said.
"Now al! the sophomores want to do it again, ba
sically because it was so much fun.
"All the freshmen got to know each other
without the pressure of the head coach being
there or the pressure of dual meet competition.
This year it would have been another great meet
because we have such a large freshman team

again. But with this being Thanksgiving all the
freshman are going home," he said.
However, neither Knapp or Coach Skip Ken
ney will accompany their swimmers this
weekend, and the Cardinal representatives will
primarily be those who live in the Los Angeles
area.
Those who do compete will get a sneak
preview of their West Coast competition. Both
USC and UCLA are expected to field large
squads, and UC-Berkeley may send
some athletes after participating in
last year's meet.
"It's my first main competition
with a lot of the better West Coast
schools," freshman Kurt Kroesche
from San Marino said. "I'll get a
good idea of where I stand with
some of the swimmers there."
"It's a really good meet," junior
Sam McAdam said. "It was a good
meet for the freshmen to get ac
quainted with the conference."
Knapp noted some of the meet's

other benefits. "It was held in the
Olympic pool, which is a nice
facility," he said. "The format of the
meet is NCAA (meet) order. They
have the opportunity to see how
their events fit into the NCAA for
mat, which is important because
the NCAA format is a lot different
from the dual meet format."
The meet is nevertheless ex
pected to be rather relaxed and
more of a "fun" event.
"It's so low-key, I can't even tell
you who's even going," Kenney
said. "This is the time of year when
the workouts are more important
than anything."
"You always want to swim fast,

but you want to have fun too,"
Kroesche said. "Family and friends
will be there, and that will be nice."
"I think it will be a fun meet,"
freshman John Hodge said.
Hodge, and seniors John Moffett
and Mike Reynolds are also ex
pected to compete.
The men's and women's divers
are taking an entirely different ap
proach to the meet, however, and
will be sending a nine-person con
tingent to Los Angeles.
"We've been gearing up for it,"
freshman Matt Frawley said. "It's a
big meet. We're taking this thing
wholeheartedly. We're going all out
for it."
