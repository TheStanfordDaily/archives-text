# Kassulke KO's Koehler for Grappler Win
## 
### PETER CASTILLO Staff writer 
Fans last night were treated to an excit
ing wrestling dual meet between host
Stanford and San Francisco State.
The contest was not decided until the
last match when heavyweight Kurt Kas
sulke defeated the Dons' Alex Koehler 6-
0 to complete a 23-22 come-from-behind
Cardinal victory.
Just as it did in Friday night's match
against UC-Davis, the Cardinal dropped
the 118-pound class. The San Francisco
Gator's Jose Nunez thoroughly out
wrestled Steven Bishco for a 16-3 win. He
never let Bishco into the match.
In the 134-pound division, Stanford's
Neil Warnik scored a takedown on Cliff
Lentz with time running out. Warnick's pin
tied the match 6-6. Warnick was awarded
one point for having more than a minute of
riding time, giving him a 7-6 victory.
Jeff Bradley (142 pounds) defeated San
Francisco's Division II Ail-American, Rich
Ellingsen, 10-2. Coach Chris Horpel was

pleased with Bradley's performance,
saying he made a good wrestler look bad.
In a pivotal match, a lapse by Stanford's
Jeff Hazard (150 pounds) allowed Craig
Penrose to score a with scarcely a minute
left in the match. The takedown staked
Penrose to a 5-4 lead. Afterward, Hazard
was awarded one point for riding time to
tie the score 5-5.
"The fact that Hazard ended up tying
changed the outlook of the meet," Horpel
said. "With the tie we now had to win
matches decisively."
Because of the illness of Stanford's Eric
Harber, Pete Rogers was forced to move
up to 167 pounds and 150-pound reserve
Mark Alex filled in at 158.
Wrestling out of his weight class, Alex
lost by a technical pin to Craig Settles at
the 5:45 mark. The score ended with
Settles on top, 19-2.
The move in weights did not seem to
bother Rogers, however, as he beat
Donald Moseman 17-3.
Dave Lee (177 pounds) showed no
mercy to the Gators' Armand Walker,
recording a technical pin at 4:45 into the

match with the score 16-1. This gave
Stanford a slim 20-19 lead.
San Francisco's Tim Gleason (190
pounds) defeated Terry Mclntyre 9-4 to
give the Gators a 22-20 lead with one
match left: the heavyweight competition.
Stanford's Kurt Kassulke started ag
gressively and continued to wear down
Alex Koehler as the match progressed.
Koehler remained in striking distance
after two periods, however. Entering the
third and final stanza, Kassulke main
tained a slim 2-0 advantage.
Kassulke started the third period with a
reversal for one point, and after jockeying
for position scored a takedown to give him
the win.
The Cardinal raises its dual meet
record to 2-0.
Stanford goes to Humboldt State for a
meet Friday and the next day faces north
ern power Southern Oregon.
Horpel may have to juggle his lineup
again, because Bradley might not com
pete. Bradley may decide to redshirt if his
neck injury worsens during the Caesar's
Palace Invitational Dec. 7-8.
