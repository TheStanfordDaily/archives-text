# Tar Heels Top Poll
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — With Geor
gia Tech idle over the weekend,
North Carolina Coach Dean Smith
says it was easy for his team to slip
past the Yellow Jackets into the No.
1 spot in this week's college basket
ball poll.
"That's nice to hear after watch
ing our team look like the 270 th
best in the country in practice
today," Smith said Monday night.
"But since Georgia Tech did not
play, I guess we did perform better
than they did over the weekend."
The Tar Heels, who handed
UCLA their worst beating ever
with a 107-70 drubbing Sunday
night, received 22 first-place votes
— two less than Georgia Tech —
and 1,158 points in the nationwide

balloting of 61 writers and
broadcasters. Georgia Tech
finished 10 points behind in second.
"This reminds me of December
1977 when our greatly overrated
team was No. 1 in the preseason
and opened the year by beating
Oregon State twice by 31 and 26
points," Smith said. "We dropped to
second behind Kentucky in the first
regular season poll after those two
games.
"The polls are fun, but at this
point of the season they really don't
mean a lot."
The third through ninth spots in
the poll remained unchanged from
the preseason Top Twenty.
Michigan, which won two games
during the opening week of the

season, had nine first-place votes
and 1,030 points, followed by
Syracuse, 947 points; Kansas, two
first-place votes and 933; Duke,
one first-place and 917; Illinois, one
first-place and 809; Georgetown,
one first-place and 791 and Louis
ville, 786 points.
Kentucky, which led the Second
Ten in the preseason poll, im
proved one spot with 526 points,
while Notre Dame, 12th last week,
leads the Second Ten this week
with the remaining first-place vote.
Following Notre Dame are
Louisiana State, Oklahoma,
Memphis State, North Carolina
State, Nevada-Las Vegas,
Maryland, St. John's, Auburn and
Alabama-Rirrninaharn.
