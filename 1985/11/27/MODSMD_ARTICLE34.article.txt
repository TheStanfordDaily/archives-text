SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) — Gerry Faust took
the blame yesterday evening for Notre Dame's lack
luster football performance and said his decision to
resign as coach will allow the university to move
quickly to find a successor.
Faust announced his resignation earlier yesterday
after five years of criticism and frustration.
"If you're going to put the blame somewhere, put
it on the coach. That's where it ought to be," Faust
told reporters at a news conference. "We got
started on the wrong foot five years ago and never
did bail out of the thing," he said later.
Faust, 50, owns a 30-25-1 record at Notre Dame,
including a 5-5 mark this season after consecutive
defeats by top-ranked Penn State and No. 13
Louisiana State the last two weeks.
Those two defeats made him the losingest coach

in Irish history. Before Faust, Joe Kuharich had the
most losses, going 17-23-0 from 1959 to 1962.
Faust's resignation Monday came as a shock.
"It's best for me to resign now and give the uni
versity an opportunity to get another coach before
recruiting starts next week," Faust said. "It's best
for the university, best for me, best for my family."
Faust said he would consider a coaching offer
from another Division I school, but has received
none thus far. "I'm going to sit back for a couple of
weeks and hope I get some calls, maybe in the busi
ness world, the coaching world, and evaluate things
and go from there," he said.
Athletic Director Gene Corrigan denied a rumor
that Minnesota Coach Lou Holtz had already been
offered the job.
