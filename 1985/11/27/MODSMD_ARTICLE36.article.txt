Bonner Ready To Leave USSR
MOSCOW — Yelena Bonner, wife of dissident Soviet scientist and
Nobel Peace Prize-winner Andrei Sakharov, has arrived here to
prepare for her trip to the West, it was reported yesterday.
Two policemen guarding Bonner's Moscow apartment toid West
ern reporters that she had arrived from internal exile in Gorky but
was not allowed to receive any visitors. She is preparing to fly to
Rome on Dec. 2 and will travel to the United States later.
Bonner will be treated in Italy for an eye illness and is expected to
undergo a heart by-pass operation in the United States. Sakharov,
who went on an extended hunger strike to support his wife's applica
tion for an exit visa, was reported to be recovering from the hunger
strike's effects.
Bonner told her daughter, who is living in the United States, that
she had signed a statement for the KGB, the Soviet secret service,
promising not to have any contacts with the media while she is in the
West. If she had not signed, she said, she would have been afraid of
not being permitted to re-enter the Soviet Union.
Soviet Economy Misses Goals
MOSCOW — The Soviet oil, steel, chemical and building materials
industries failed to achieve their production targets in 1985, but the
economy as a whole met its goals, the director of the Kremlin's
central planning agency said yesterday.
Nikolai Talyzin, the new head of Gosplan, projected a modest 3.8
percent increase in economic growth for next year in a report to the
Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament.
The economy, held back by a hard winter in the year's opening
months, is expected to grow by 3.5 percent in 1985, Talyzin said.
He blamed "bad organization" for the shortfall in output of oil,
steel, chemical and construction materials. Production of fruit and
vegetables also lagged, and retail stores in many of the Soviet
Union's 15 republics will fall short of their sales targets, he added.
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who has made a re-invigorated
economy one of his major goals, stressed the importance of science
and technological progress in spurring growth.
In a speech to the Supreme Soviet, Gorbachev also called for bet
ter planning, stronger central planning and measures to enhance in
dependence of plant managers and local bodies from government
ministries.
U.S. Seeks Talks With Angola
WASHINGTON — A senior official of the Reagan Administration,
which is considering the resumption of secret aid to guerrillas in An
gola, is to meet with a high-level Angolan delegation today and to
morrow in an effort to determine whether that country's Marxist
government is willing to negotiate with the insurgents.
U.S. officials said yesterday that Chester Crocker, assistant sec
retary of state for African affairs, will investigate the chances for a
political settlement of the Angolan civil war when he meets Angolan
Interior Minister Manuel Duarte "Kito" Rodrigues in Lusaka, Zam
bia.
The officials, who asked not to be identified, said Crocker also will
explore Angola's willingness to cooperate with U.S. proposals, made
in March, for withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola as part of a
settlement of regional tensions that would include independence for
the South African-controlled territory of Namibia.
The State Department, in announcing the meeting yesterday,
sought publicly to emphasize that the talks will stress the Angola-
Namibia link.
However, the Lusaka meeting has potentially major implications
for the internal Angolan conflict. It comes as the Administration is de
ciding whether to resume covert aid to the countiy's UNITA insur
gents, led by Jonas Savimbi, who have been fighting for years against
the Marxist government supported by Cuba and the Soviet Union.
The officials, while declining to give specifics of what Crocker will
say hinted that he might tell Rodrigues that the United States is
prepared to hold off any new aid to UNITA i.' t»u Angoian govern
ment shcw> si:-Tts of willingness to negotiate with Savimbi about
forming a national reconciliation government with a role for UNITA.
Synod Studies Church Reform
VATICAN CITY — U.S. and Scandinavian prelates proposed at
an extraordinary synod yesterday that local bishops and their na
tional organizations share with the pope responsibility for running the
Roman Catholic Church.
Bishops from the Third World, addressing issues of their own
region, called for increased church support of clerics working for the
poor and oppressed.
The proposals came in speeches on the second day of a two-week
synod assessing the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, also
known as Vatican 11. Vatican 11, held in four sessions between
1962 and 1965, made reforms in Catholic liturgy, ecumenism, semi
nary education, religious life and church government.
Bishop James Malone of Youngstown, Ohio, president of the U. S.
Bishops Conference, said he believes there are "good grounds" in
the Vatican II reforms to justify "some extension of collegiality to the
direction of bishops."
In church parlance, collegiality refers to the collaborative relation
ship between the pope and bishops in Christian teaching and in
governing the church.
Hostage Negotiator Sees Hope
WASHINGTON — British hostage negotiator Terry Waite held a
hastily arranged White House meeting with Vice President George
Bush yesterday and emerged insisting that he saw "a way forward"
in his efforts to gain the release of four of the six Americans held
captive by Moslem extremists in Beirut.
Waite, a representative of the Rev. Robert Runcie, the Arch
bishop of Canterbury, said that while "progress has been made"
toward ending the plight of the hostages, their situation remained
"highly dangerous." He said that he did not convey to Bush any se
cret message from the kidnappers and declined to elaborate on
specifics of his meeting the vice president.
A State Department official cautioned against reading too much
optimism into the hour-long meeting. "From what I understand ... I
couldn't point you in the direction that fantastic progress has been
made," said the official, who spoke on the condition he not be identi
fied. "I wouldn't take the fact that he's talking to the vice president
as evidence of any progress."
Waite has said that he met twice this month in Beirut with the kid
nappers, believed to be members of the shadowy Islamic Jihad, an
extremist Shia faction. The kidnappers have demanded the release
of 17 Arab guerrillas jailed by Kuwait on terrorism charges as ran
som for the freedom of the Americans.

He blamed "bad organization" for the shortfall in output of oil,
steel, chemical and construction materials. Production of fruit and
vegetables also lagged, and retail stores in many of the Soviet
Union's 15 republics will fall short of their sales targets, he added.
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who has made a re-invigorated
economy one of his major goals, stressed the importance of science
and technological progress in spurring growth.
In a speech to the Supreme Soviet, Gorbachev also called for bet
ter planning, stronger central planning and measures to enhance in
dependence of plant managers and local bodies from government
ministries.
U.S. Seeks Talks With Angola
WASHINGTON — A senior official of the Reagan Administration,
which is considering the resumption of secret aid to guerrillas in An
gola, is to meet with a high-level Angolan delegation today and to
morrow in an effort to determine whether that country's Marxist
government is willing to negotiate with the insurgents.
U.S. officials said yesterday that Chester Crocker, assistant sec
retary of state for African affairs, will investigate the chances for a
political settlement of the Angolan civil war when he meets Angolan
Interior Minister Manuel Duarte "Kito" Rodrigues in Lusaka, Zam
bia.
The officials, who asked not to be identified, said Crocker also will
explore Angola's willingness to cooperate with U.S. proposals, made
in March, for withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola as part of a
settlement of regional tensions that would include independence for
the South African-controlled territory of Namibia.
The State Department, in announcing the meeting yesterday,
sought publicly to emphasize that the talks will stress the Angola-
Namibia link.
However, the Lusaka meeting has potentially major implications
for the internal Angolan conflict. It comes as the Administration is de
ciding whether to resume covert aid to the countiy's UNITA insur
gents, led by Jonas Savimbi, who have been fighting for years against
the Marxist government supported by Cuba and the Soviet Union.
The officials, while declining to give specifics of what Crocker will
say hinted that he might tell Rodrigues that the United States is
prepared to hold off any new aid to UNITA i.' t»u Angoian govern

forming a national reconciliation government with a role for UNITA.
Synod Studies Church Reform
VATICAN CITY — U.S. and Scandinavian prelates proposed at
an extraordinary synod yesterday that local bishops and their na
tional organizations share with the pope responsibility for running the
Roman Catholic Church.
Bishops from the Third World, addressing issues of their own
region, called for increased church support of clerics working for the
poor and oppressed.
The proposals came in speeches on the second day of a two-week
synod assessing the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, also
known as Vatican 11. Vatican 11, held in four sessions between
1962 and 1965, made reforms in Catholic liturgy, ecumenism, semi
nary education, religious life and church government.
Bishop James Malone of Youngstown, Ohio, president of the U. S.
Bishops Conference, said he believes there are "good grounds" in
the Vatican II reforms to justify "some extension of collegiality to the
direction of bishops."
In church parlance, collegiality refers to the collaborative relation
ship between the pope and bishops in Christian teaching and in
governing the church.
Hostage Negotiator Sees Hope
WASHINGTON — British hostage negotiator Terry Waite held a
hastily arranged White House meeting with Vice President George
Bush yesterday and emerged insisting that he saw "a way forward"
in his efforts to gain the release of four of the six Americans held
captive by Moslem extremists in Beirut.
Waite, a representative of the Rev. Robert Runcie, the Arch
bishop of Canterbury, said that while "progress has been made"
toward ending the plight of the hostages, their situation remained
"highly dangerous." He said that he did not convey to Bush any se
cret message from the kidnappers and declined to elaborate on
specifics of his meeting the vice president.
A State Department official cautioned against reading too much
optimism into the hour-long meeting. "From what I understand ... I
couldn't point you in the direction that fantastic progress has been
made," said the official, who spoke on the condition he not be identi
fied. "I wouldn't take the fact that he's talking to the vice president
as evidence of any progress."
Waite has said that he met twice this month in Beirut with the kid
nappers, believed to be members of the shadowy Islamic Jihad, an
extremist Shia faction. The kidnappers have demanded the release
of 17 Arab guerrillas jailed by Kuwait on terrorism charges as ran
som for the freedom of the Americans.
Bonner Ready To Leave USSR
MOSCOW — Yelena Bonner, wife of dissident Soviet scientist and
Nobel Peace Prize-winner Andrei Sakharov, has arrived here to
prepare for her trip to the West, it was reported yesterday.
Two policemen guarding Bonner's Moscow apartment toid West
ern reporters that she had arrived from internal exile in Gorky but
was not allowed to receive any visitors. She is preparing to fly to
Rome on Dec. 2 and will travel to the United States later.
Bonner will be treated in Italy for an eye illness and is expected to
undergo a heart by-pass operation in the United States. Sakharov,
who went on an extended hunger strike to support his wife's applica
tion for an exit visa, was reported to be recovering from the hunger
strike's effects.
Bonner told her daughter, who is living in the United States, that
she had signed a statement for the KGB, the Soviet secret service,
promising not to have any contacts with the media while she is in the
West. If she had not signed, she said, she would have been afraid of
not being permitted to re-enter the Soviet Union.
Soviet Economy Misses Goals
MOSCOW — The Soviet oil, steel, chemical and building materials
industries failed to achieve their production targets in 1985, but the
economy as a whole met its goals, the director of the Kremlin's
central planning agency said yesterday.
Nikolai Talyzin, the new head of Gosplan, projected a modest 3.8
percent increase in economic growth for next year in a report to the
Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament.
The economy, held back by a hard winter in the year's opening
months, is expected to grow by 3.5 percent in 1985, Talyzin said.
He blamed "bad organization" for the shortfall in output of oil,
