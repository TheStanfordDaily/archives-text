# Mubarak says he will not retaliate militarily
## Egypt Claims Libya Instigated Hijacking 
### 
CAIRO, Egypt — Egypt directly accused
Libya yesterday of instigating the hijacking of an
Egypt Air jetliner, but President Hosni Mubarak
suggested that he will not retaliate militarily at
this time despite the fact that Egyptian troops
have been mobilized near the Libyan border.
"We do not call for war. We call for peace,"
Mubarak told reporters when asked if Egypt
planned to launch a military strike against Libya.
"War is not a simple thing," he added. "We can
not take that decision simply."
In other developments:
• The government of Malta said the only terror
ist to survive the storming of the airliner by
Egyptian troops at the Valletta airport, a 20-
year-old Tunisian, had been identified by some of
the passengers as the leader of the hijackers.
• In Beirut, a renegade Palestinian guerrilla
group led by veteran terrorist Abu Nidal claimed
responsibility for the seizure of the plane.
• Libya denounced the assault by Egyptian com
mandos as a "reckless action" and accused
Egypt of trying to cover up the facts surrounding
the incident.

Mubarak talked briefly with reporters after
meeting separately with his defense minister and
with the Soviet ambassador to Egypt, Alexander
Belongov. Belongov said he briefed Mubarak on
the results of last week's U.S.-Soviet summit
meeting in Geneva, but the two men were also
believed to have discussed Egypt's deepening
crisis with Libya.
A two-day-old military alert along the 800-mile
Libyan frontier remained in effect. Asked
repeatedly if a military strike against Libya was
likely, Mubarak refused to rule it out, saying,
"This is not the place to tell you what is going to
happen."
However, he appeared to play down the
prospects of an armed confrontation. In an ap
parent allusion to Libya's leader, Col. Moammar
Khadafy, Mubarak said, "One does not punish
one person by punishing a whole people."
Egyptian officials have said that the reason be
hind the military mobilization was Egypt's belief
that Libya was involved in the weekend hijacking
of the Egypt Air Boeing 737 to Malta.
The hijacking ended Sunday in a bloodbath
that claimed 58 lives when Egyptian commandos

stormed the plane. One hostage passenger,
Scarlett Marie Rogenkamp, 38, of Oceanside,
Calif., and an Egyptian security guard were
killed earlier by the hijackers.
Cairo radio, in an official commentary, said the
hijackers were members of an extremist Pales
tinian group "funded and instigated by Khadafy's
Libya, which is a well-known supporter and
haven for terrorists."
However, Egypt has so far offered no proof of
Khadafy's involvement, which Libya has denied.
Declaring that "the connection is clear,"
Mubarak told reporters that one of the terrorist
group's leaders "is in Libya at the moment,
staying in Room 401 of the Grand Hotel" in
Tripoli.
Reporters who called the hotel from Rome
were told that the occupant of Room 401 was
"out for the evening."
Observers said Mubarak appeared to be refer
ring to Abu Nidal, a veteran of years of terrorist
actions against Israel and against Palestinian fac
tions that he considered too moderate in their
politics. His real name is Sabri Banna, but he is
better known by his guerrilla nom de guerre.
