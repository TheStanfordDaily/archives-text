# Weinberger Orders Tighter Security
## 
### 
WASHINGTON and JERUS
ALEM — Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger ordered new
security curbs yesterday on up to
60,000 military and civilian
employees with access to secret
codes and cryptographic equip
ment. The curbs also apply to
workers at the National Security
Agency, where accused Soviet spy
Ronald Pelton had a top-secret
clearance.
Meanwhile, Israeli government
officials refused to comment on
published reports that a famous in
telligence agent acted as the control
officer for Jonathan Pollard.

The restrictions, proposed last
week in a Pentagon report on mili
tary security, were the first public
countermeasures to a rash of
spying arrests involving intelligence
and military employees.
Pentagon officials admitted yes
terday that Pelton caused "serious"
damage during nearly six years of
spying that began after he resigned
from the NSA in 1979 and ended
with his arrest in Annapolis, Md.,
Monday morning.
In a second case, a federal indict
ment charged yesterday that Larry
Wu-tai Chin, a retired CIA worker

still under contract to the agency,
became the Chinese intelligence
agency's deputy bureau chief for
Washington spying operations
during a 33-year espionage career
for the People's Republic of China.
Chin, Pelton and an accused
husband-and-wife espionage team
— Jonathan Jay Pollard and Anne
Henderson-Pollard — are to appear
at bond hearings today in federal
courts in Washington, Baltimore
and Alexandria, Va. The Pollards
were arrested last week on charges
of spying for an unnamed foreign
power, reported to be Israel.

Weinberger's order for restric
tions on cryptographic material fol
lows calls by Reagan Administration
and congressional officials for
stronger counterintelligence
measures to combat a wave of
foreign espionage in the United
States.
Speculation first surfaced in
Jerusalem over the weekend that
Rafael Eitan, a close associate of
leading right-wing Israeli
politicians, had acted as the control
officer for Jonathan Pollard, the
American arrested for espionage
last Thursday in front of the Israeli
Embassy in Washington.
