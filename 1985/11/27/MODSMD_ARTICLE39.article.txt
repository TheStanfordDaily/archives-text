Bankruptcy Possible
Texaco Inc. raised the possibility yesterday
that it might have to file for bankruptcy as a
result of last week's $10.53 billion jury award
against it, setting off a selling spree on Wall
Street that forced a temporary suspension of
trading in the stock of the nation's third largest
oil company.
Hoping to dispel fears that it was on the
verge of seeking bankruptcy protection,
Texaco quickly issued a statement saying that
such a filing "would be a very extreme step
that would only arise as a possibility after all
other legal remedies had been exhausted."
Hut Texaco left the door open for such a
step if Texas stale Judge Solomon Casseb
does not set aside or lower the $10.53 billion
award to Pennzoil, which is by far the highest
verdict ever in U.S. civil litigation. The com
pany said that it was "not at this time ruling out
any legal course of action" to protect its stock
holders, employees, customers and creditors.
Wall Street analysts said yesterday that the
prospect of bankruptcy by the $48.1 billion-a
year oil conglomerate was still somewhat
remote, but not as far-fetched as some initially
assumed. Meanwhile, the chief trial lawyer for
Pennzoil Corp. angrily attacked Texaco's com
ments as part of a "propaganda" campaign by
the company aimed at pressuring the judge
into setting aside the verdict.
After a 59-minute suspension in trading yes
terday morning, Texaco closed at $31.37 per
share, down $2.37 in unusually heavy trading.
The company's stock has now dropped more
than $7 since the Nov. 19 verdict.

Bill Corners Reagan
WASHINGTON — President Reagan has
little choice but to support the House Ways and
Means Committee's tax bill despite White
House reservations about it, political analysts
said yesterday, because he cannot afford to
hand the Democrats a potential issue for next
year's congressional elections.
"Reagan has put himself into a box," said
conservative political strategist Kevin Phillips.
"The Democrats have put together a package
that would be more popular with the middle
class (than the Administration's original plan),
so the White House just doesn't have enough
justification to get away with rejecting the bill."
As a result, in the face of strong opposition
from most business groups and misgivings
among some White House officials about the
economic effects of the House package,
Reagan is expected to try to keep the bill alive
in hopes of improving upon it next year when it
goes to the Republican-controlled Senate.
"We won't have another chance at tax
reform this term," one Administration official
said. "We can't afford to drown our own baby,
even if he's turned into a bit of a freak."
The bill, which the Ways and Means Com
mittee approved in the early morning hours
on Saturday, is expected to go to the House
floor early next month.
Although the Ways and Means plan conforms
in many ways to Reagan's approach, there are
significant differences between the two ver
sions that have led such White House officials
as economics adviser Beryl Sprinkel and com
munications director Patrick Buchanan to urge
Reagan to reject it.

Shuttle Liftoff Perfect
KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. —
Driven by a 700-foot shower of flame, the
space shuttle Atlantis lit the skies of at least
four southern states yesterday as it made a
perfect liftoff on a week-long mission that will
include a Thanksgiving dinner in space.
In a perfectly clear sky, against the back
ground of a hovering full moon, shuttle mission
61-B used its 4.25 million pounds of propellant
to stage a fireworks show that rivaled those of
the nation's Bicentennial.
It was the 23rd shuttle mission, the second
flight of the orbiter Atlantis, and only the
second night launch in the shuttle program's
history. Atlantis, which carried a crew of six
men and one woman, had been prepared "in
record time" after its premiere flight in Octo
ber, according to Kennedy's shuttle chief
Robert Sieck.
NASA officials hope that the payload and
mission specialists will be able to take advan
tage of this orbit to photograph drought
stricken areas of Africa to search for evidence
of hidden water sources. The crew may also
have a chance to photograph the Colombian
volcano, Nevado del Ruiz, that erupted two
weeks ago.
Market Ends Even
NEW YORK — The stock market finished
about even yesterday after a bout of selling
late in the day thwarted a rally attempt.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
rose .12 to 1,456.77.
