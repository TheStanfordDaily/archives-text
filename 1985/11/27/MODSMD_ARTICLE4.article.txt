# Johnson Intends To Refile Rejected Suit
## 
### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
Stanford staff member Clifford
Johnson said yesterday he plans to refile
a lawsuit — rejected last week by a
federal appeais court — that seeks to
prohibit computer-controlled launching
of nuclear weapons by the United
States.
The suit contended that use of
launch-on-warning capability (LOWC)
— a computer system that would auto
matically launch nuclear missiles if
electronic sensors indicate that the na
tion is under attack — violates the con
stitutional authority of Congress and the
president to declare war because it es

sentially relegates that authority to a
computer.
According to the three-member panel
of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
that dismissed the case on Nov. 19, the
issue of constitutionality cannot be ad
dressed because Johnson "has not al
leged that launch-on-warning capability
is even technically feasible, much less
that its use has been adopted as official
policy or implemented."
Although the suit claimed that the
deployment of Pershing 2 missiles in
Europe indicates the use of such a sys
tem, it did not allege that the system
was an official government policy.
The new lawsuit will "allege that
LOWC does exist as an official policy,"
said Johnson, a computer expert at In

formation Technology Services. "There
is Senate testimony to that effect," he
said. "It's really clear cut that [a policy]
exists."
The Department of Defense,
however, has denied that LOWC is an
official policy and has refused to say
whether the technology for it is being
developed.
Johnson said he plans to refile the suit
within several months with the U.S. Dis
trict Court in San Francisco, the same
court in which he filed his first suit last
year.
"It will take me a month or two to or
ganize" funding for the case as well as
support from legal groups, he said.
The suit was originally filed in 1984
against Secretary of Defense Caspar

Weinberger, but a district court judge
ruled that it raised military and political
issues outside the court's jurisdiction.
Johnson said he believes that the most
recent decision was not based on a
desire to avoid political issues, but sug
gested that the potential for danger in
herent in LOWC might have warranted a
stand by the judges on the con
stitutionality issue.
Calling the court's rejection of his suit
"an honest decision," Johnson said last
week. "It isn't really a setback."
The rejected suit may have concen
trated too much on the future of defense
and the Strategic Defense Initiative, ac
cording to Johnson, who said yesterday
he plans to discuss the current uses
of LOWC and inter-continental bal
listic missiles in the new lawsuit.
"I think the court was kindly let
ting me know what changes to
make (in the suit). It gave me a
chance to refile," he said.
Although the case "is nearly two
years old, it's not dead by any
means," Johnson said.
Johnson has said he considers the
greatest danger of LOWC to be the
possibility of an erroneous detec
tion triggering a nuclear strike that
is not retaliatory, citing an 1980 in
cident in which "a hundred nuclear
bomber crews scrambled to start
their engines and nuclear missiles
were readied for launch because a
single 46-cent chip occasionally
generated the digit '2' instead of
'o.' "
