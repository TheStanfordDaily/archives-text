LA Accused of Bias
LOS ANGELES — The Justice Department
yesterday accused the city of discriminating
against Hispanics in drawing district lines for
the City Council, saying it violated the rights of
Spanish-speaking residents "to register, vote
and participate in the political process."
City officials immediately denounced the
lawsuit.
The lawsuit alleges that the council's
redistricting plan, approved unanimously in
September 1982, violates the Voting Rights
Act of 1965 and the U.S. Constitution's 14th
and 15th Amendments.
The civil suit says the plan was designed to
avoid "the higher Hispanic percentages in cer
tain districts that would be the logical result of

drawing district boundaries on a non-racial
basis."
It notes that the Hispanic population in Los
Angeles, according to the 1980 census, had
risen to 27 percent from 18 percent a decade
earlier, but that no Hispanics sit on the City
Council.
In fact, the suit adds, only one Hispanic has
been elected to the council since 1900, and
that was Edward Roybal, elected in 1960 and
now a member of Congress.
Pair Gets Probation
LOS ANGELES — An Indonesian business
man and his sister accused of using illegal
aliens as slaves and servants were sentenced
yesterday to probation and fined.
Nasim Mussry, 57, and his sister, Elsa

Singman, 54, were minor players among 10
people initially indicted by a federal grand jury
in 1982, said U.S. District Judge Richard Gad
bois, who passed sentence on the two.
At the sentencing, Mussry said slavery was
never his intention, that he only secured
housekeeping duties for people.
"I am not a criminal," he told Gadbois. "I am
not a crook." His sister made no statement.
Five others previously pleaded guilty to
reduced charges and two are fugitives, pos
sibly in Indonesia. Charges against another
defendant were dropped.
The group was accused of bringing workers
to the United States and selling them for as
much as $3,000 each. The indictment followed
raids in Beverly Hills and West Los Angeles by
federal agents who rounded up 30 Indonesians
who had been working as domestics.
