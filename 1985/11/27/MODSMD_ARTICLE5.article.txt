# Two Members Question C-IR Confidentiality
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Two student members of Stanford's Commission on
Investment Responsibility (C-IR) strongly questioned
yesterday the committee's ongoing decision to keep its
meetings confidential, responding to a letter from C-IR
Chairman Richard Brody that admonishes the two stu
dents for "inappropriate discussion" concerning com
mittee affairs.
Seniors Joel Bellenson and Jonathan Turk, the two
student representatives on the commission, expressed
"deep concern" yesterday over C-IR's policy of
witholding its proceedings from the public.
The commission's aim is to reach a proposal, to be
submitted to Stanford's Board of Trustees, concern
ing a selective divestment policy for the University.
In a Nov. 12 letter to members of the C-IR, Brody, a
political science professor, said he "thought we had. . .
agreed not to discuss in any detail matters that were
still under consideration by the commission." Included
with the letter was a Nov. 8 Daily article in which Bel
lenson and Turk discussed the results of the previous
day's C-IR meeting. Brody, in the letter, referred to
the students' comments as "innapropriate discussion of
details."
"Details should come from one source (the chair)
. . . (and members should) avoid characterizing the
work of the commission before it is completed," the
letter stated.
"Brody was not happy with the fact that Jonathan
Turk and I talked to The Daily," Bellenson said yester
day.
C-IR's decision was "absolutely not" contrary to
Stanford's policy regarding on-campus committees, ac
cording to University President Donald Kennedy.
"(The confidentiality) is standard procedure for com
mittees discussing difficult subjects," Kennedy said.
"It's just a sensible way of proceeding. It's not a matter
of wanting to keep it in the dark. The real issue is how
to reach a consensus most effectively."
