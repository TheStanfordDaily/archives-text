# Two Members Question C-IR Confidentiality
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Two student members of Stanford's Commission on
Investment Responsibility (C-IR) strongly questioned
yesterday the committee's ongoing decision to keep its
meetings confidential, responding to a letter from C-IR
Chairman Richard Brody that admonishes the two stu
dents for "inappropriate discussion" concerning com
mittee affairs.
Seniors Joel Bellenson and Jonathan Turk, the two
student representatives on the commission, expressed
"deep concern" yesterday over C-IR's policy of
witholding its proceedings from the public.
The commission's aim is to reach a proposal, to be
submitted to Stanford's Board of Trustees, concern
ing a selective divestment policy for the University.
In a Nov. 12 letter to members of the C-IR, Brody, a
political science professor, said he "thought we had. . .
agreed not to discuss in any detail matters that were
still under consideration by the commission." Included
with the letter was a Nov. 8 Daily article in which Bel
lenson and Turk discussed the results of the previous
day's C-IR meeting. Brody, in the letter, referred to
the students' comments as "innapropriate discussion of
details."
"Details should come from one source (the chair)
. . . (and members should) avoid characterizing the
work of the commission before it is completed," the
letter stated.
"Brody was not happy with the fact that Jonathan
Turk and I talked to The Daily," Bellenson said yester
day.
C-IR's decision was "absolutely not" contrary to
Stanford's policy regarding on-campus committees, ac
cording to University President Donald Kennedy.
"(The confidentiality) is standard procedure for com
mittees discussing difficult subjects," Kennedy said.
"It's just a sensible way of proceeding. It's not a matter
of wanting to keep it in the dark. The real issue is how
to reach a consensus most effectively."
â€¢ Brody said yesterday the policy
of keeping commission proceedings
confidential had been practiced
before he became chairman.
Bellenson, however, said he is
"completely at odds with that con
cept (of keeping the meetings con
fidential). I feel it's imperative to
have community involvement, that
the community be aware and able to
comment and sway the outcome."
Adding that although he is gener
ally pleased with the progress of
the committee, Bellenson said he is
"deeply concerned about Brody's
distaste for public discussion on the
committee work before it is com
pleted."
._"I can understand how you might
not want to let out preliminary
recommendations," Turk said yes
terday, affirming, however, that
"everything should be made
available" to the Stanford commu
nity.

"Individuals should exercise dis
cretion in not making the commit
tee appear in a bad light," he said,
adding that he had "definitely" been
discreet in his dealings with The
Daily.
"It should be contrary to with
hold (the proceedings), unless it's a
really sticky situation. If letting in
formation out will cause unneces
sary hoopla, then why not wait?
Otherwise, (the information) should
be available to the public," Turk
said.
"We're a (University) presiden
tial commission," Brody said, em
phasizing that C-IR's practice is
not against University policy.
"We make our recommendation
directly to the Board of Trustees,"
Brody said. "It's courteous to them
to allow them to have their say
(first)."
Explaining that the committee is
"open to petitions from the commu
nity," Brody said, "Of course," the
public has input into the commis
sion.
