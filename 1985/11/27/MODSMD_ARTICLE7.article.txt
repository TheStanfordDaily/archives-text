# Cannery Strike Hits Trying Times

### RICHARD WALTER Staff writer 
This is the second part of a two-part se
ries on the strike of Watsonville workers against
the city's two largest cannery companies.

WATSONVILLE â€” Amid the tension of the
complex strike maneuvers against Watsonville
Canning Co. and Richard A. Shaw Inc., violence
has broken out here on numerous occasions, and
both the canneries and the workers of have been
blamed for the outbursts.
"We don't condone it (violence). But you must
try to understand the frustration and the anger,"
said Sergio Lopes, the business agent of
Teamsters Local 912, the union of the striking
workers.
"It is difficult to express. There is a lot on both
sides. The violence now, though, is no more vi
olent than the act of trying to strip employees,
and for 33 years the company has committed this
violent act," he said.
Smiley Verduzco, president of Watsonville
Canning, cited a long list of violent incidents in
cluding firebombings, arson, threats, attempted
kidnappings, overturned cars, attempts at shoot
ings and beatings of employees who did try to go
to work.
"They (the violent acts) are coming from

Teamsters Local 912, and planned from the
union," he said.
Strikers themselves often mentioned the
police in connection with the violence. "When
people in the cannery accuse strikers of vio
lence, the police pick them up. But when
strikers accuse those at the cannery of violence,
nothing is done," said a worker who refused to
be identified.
The strike places burdens on both sides to
make extra efforts to survive. In the case of the
cannery it is an issue of trying to keep deliveries
coming and going, and to continue production.
This hardship has forced the cannery to em
ploy outside workers to fill the empty spaces.
Importing these workers from cities like Gilroy
and Salinas has caused problems, including the
firebombing of one bus.
The workers are also under economic stress
as their last paychecks run out. At first, many
did not receive strike pay due to some disagree
ments within the union, but now they can get up
to $55 per week. Some strikers have not been
able to keep up their rent payments and have
been evicted, and the group as a whole is
seeking a city council moratorium on such ac
tions for the duration of the strike.
Strikers have sought other assistance, but in
some cases they encounter difficulties. "People
from town support us, but don't want to come
out openly," cannery worker Lupe Mares said.

"The Watsonville press has been bought off
and don't want to report accurately," she said.
Yet many labor organizations have rallied
around the Watsonville strikers. "The entire
house of labor is behind us," Lopes said.
The leader of United Farm Workers, Cesar
Chavez, spoke at one Watsonville rally. Leaders
of another union, Local 2 from San Francisco,
also came to speak. Local 2, a small union of
hotel and restaurant employees, has been out on
strike for 15 months, yet was able to donate
money to the Watsonville strikers.
United Stanford Workers (USW) has also pro
vided support. According to Linda Crouse, a
USW steward, union officials have gone to rally
meetings, collected canned goods and donated
funds totaling $550.
"One bargaining unit worker donated $140 to
the Watsonville strikers from money he had
saved up in the event of a USW strike," said
Jesusita Semides, an electrician at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center.
Some students at local universities and col
leges are gathering turkeys, sponsoring canned
food drives and bringing strikers to the
campuses to speak. A group 0 f Stanford stu
dents has been been planning a benefit to gather
money for the strikers.
