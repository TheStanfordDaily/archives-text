# Study Finds Easier Job Quest for Grads

### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
While calling reports that college graduates
nationwide should have a relatively easy time fin
ding employment "good news," the director of
the Career Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC) cautioned yesterday that the indicated
rise in jobs might not apply to all Stanford stu
dents.
A national survey by Michigan State Univer
sity found that employers are predicting they will
be hiring about 1 percent more graduates in the
coming year, while a similar report from the Col
lege Placement Council in Bethlehem, Pa.,
predicted a 2 percent increase, according to an
article in Monday's New York Times.

"The (College Placement Council) survey is
based on questions asked of organizations that
recruit," said Chris Shinkman, director of the
CPPC. The results "only mean that those who
interview (for future jobs) have a better chance."
Shinkman added that, "as usual," there is a
wide discrepancy between the attention paid to
students in different fields, with recruitment of
science-oriented students three to four times
higher than that of liberal arts students.
"As is true in previous years, people with non
technical degrees will have to be more aggres
sive and energetic," Shinkman said, adding,
however, that the outlook for all students is
"promisingly optimistic."
The two national studies also predicted that
the "strongest prospects" overall would be for

students with technical skills and that demand for
students with liberal aits degrees would either
remain steady or decline.
The center is "much busier than last year,"
said CPPC counselor Kathy Campbell, explain
ing that Stanford students this year are starting
earlier in researching future job prospects.
"But it's very early to make predictions about
job prospects," Campbell said.
"People are planning a little better," Shinkman
said. "That's good, as long as it doesn't lead to
stress problems."
The Michigan State report also predicted that
although the average salary for students earning
bachelor degrees would rise almost 2 percent to
$21,601, the increase would not keep up with
cost-of-living increases.
