AStore Will Go
ALL MACINTOSH
Beginning Dec 9th!!!
That's Right! On 11/9/85 our second Palo Alto store will begin carrying only Mac products. As
many of you know, our original Palo Alto store (508 Waverley) has become very popular. While
we very much appreciate your business, this has caused our showroom to become more
crowded than we would like. And with the addition of the Amiga this past fall, the situation is
only going to get worse. We have always wanted to devote more shelf space to the Mac — now
we can devote an entire store to it! So, starting this Friday our store at 125 University will go all
Mac with hundreds of Mac products at ridiculously low prices. Our original store at 508
Waverley will expand it's line of IBM and AT&T products along wtih all the Amiga products as
they become available.
Macintosh Only For either Store Call: Amiga, IBM, AT&TI
