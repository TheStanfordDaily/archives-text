More Convenient
A built-in intercom makes it easy for you to call the base
station from the handset or vice versa. The 1,000-ft. range*
over the 46/49 MHz frequencies makes the reception
excellent. A digital-coded security system keeps your
calls and your line private. And you don't have to worry
about safety-the external ringer is located on the back
of the handset. Volume control, automatic redialing and
other features add up to convenience.
