# Committee Requests Outside Inquiry
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
Members of a special ASSU in
vestigative committee will deliver a
letter today to University President
Donald Kennedy requesting that
the University follow the example
set by UC-Berkeley and hire an in
dependent investigator to look into
alleged police brutality.
The independent report would
supplement Law Prof. John
Kaplan's report on the police ac
tions in question, which occurred
during an Oct. 13 Old Union protest
held to protest Stanford's invest
ment policy. In his Nov. 4 report,
Kaplan criticized police actions at
Old Union, but recommended no
disciplinary measures against Stan
ford police officers involved in the
incident.
The main purpose of an indepen
dent investigation would be to alle
viate concerns that the Kaplan
report was "inadequate," the letter
stated.
According to the letter, the
reasons for concern include "the
exclusion of relevant data, the
thoroughness of the consideration
of included information, the nature
of (Kaplan's) recommendations . . .
and the common denominator —
the conflict of interest of Prof.
Kaplan."
The committee's letter cites the
UC-Berkeley administration's com
missioning of an outside inves
tigator, Alan Kalmanoff, to investi
gate charges of police brutality at
anti-apartheid protests at the uni
versity's Moffitt Library.
According to Howard Levine,
opinions page editor of The Daily
Californian, Kalmanoff's report
criticized the initial reports submit
ted by both the Berkeley police and
the university's ombudsman.
The Kalmanoff report prompted
students to call for an additional
review of police procedures, with
Kalmanoff retained as the inves
tigator, Levine said.
The new report, released last
week, was considered
"disappointing" by many because it

called only for a "civilian review','.
rather than actually placing blame
on appropriate officers, Levine.
said, despite the fact that Kalmanoff
interviewed officers and others in
volved in the incident.
Y Although he,called t% t
report "less than perfect," Senator
Joel Bellenson said the hiring of air
outside investigator would alleviate
bias as well as insure fairness.
In addition to calling for an
outside investigator, the committee
letter also calls for Kennedy to
make "all relevant data, especially
police tapes and reports" available
to the independent investigator, as
well as financial resources to cover
the costs of the investigation.
The letter was signed by four
ASSU senators and two faculty
members, French Prof. Ray Giraud
and Biology Prof. Dow Woodward.
