# Hoover Overseers Provoke Discussion
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
The Hoover Institution, founded in 1919 as a
center devoted to the study of economic, politi
cal and social change, has long been a source of
controversy at Stanford.
The institution found itself in the news again
three weeks ago when the University Board of
Trustees approved seven nominees to Hoover's
Board of Overseers.
An identical slate was proposed this May, but
was put off when the trustees called for a more
diverse group to join the overseers, according to
Mike Collins, a member of the ASSU Council of
Presidents. Collins was present at the Nov. 11
meeting of the Committee on Academic Affairs
and Development, which recommended to the
trustees the next day that the seven individuals
be approved.
According to Bob Freelen, University vice
president for Public Affairs, the slate was previ
ously tabled by the committee in the spring in an
effort to make the board of overseers "diversify
itself, mainly and particularly for minorities and
women."
The overseers are a group of about 70 individ
uals who serve as the advisory board to Hoover,
according to Richard Burress, an assistant direc
tor and senior fellow at Hoover. The group

meets twice a year — once on each coast — to
discuss policy decisions and the fund-raising ac
tivities of the institution, he said.
Included in the group are some of the most
powerful and well-known individuals in the
country.
Among the overseers listed in a 1984 Hoover
report are Shirley Temple Black, president of
the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco;
Willard Butcher, chairman of the board of Chase
Manhattan; Joseph Coors, president of the
Adolph Coors Co.; David Packard, chairman of
the board of Hewlett-Packard; and Stender
Sweeney, vice president and treasurer of the
Times Mirror Co.
Of the 68 overseers from that year, seven —
slightly more than 10 percent — are women.
The seven-member slate approved last month
includes Alf Brandin, William Coberly Jr., John :
Grey, Kenneth Khachigian and Jack Parker. In
addition, Roger Milliken and C. H. Tung were
re-appointed to a second term.
An individual may serve two consecutive
three-year terms as an overseer and is eligible to
serve again after leaving the board for at least
one year, Burress said. Brandin, 73; Coberly,
77; Grey, 63; and Parker, 67; are all past mem
bers of the group, and Parker served as chair
man of the overseers from 1973-1976.
University President Donald Kennedy

defended the appointment of the most recent
nominees at the Nov. 21 Faculty Senate
meeting, stating that continued deferral of the
slate would have led to a shortage of active over
seers.
The trustees decided to "seek improvements
we regularly seek with the next round of ap
pointments," Kennedy said, adding that increas
ing the number of women and minority over
seers is something toward which the trustees
will work in the future.
Stanford Board of Trustees President Warren
Christopher said that there are "seven or eight
outstanding women" now on the overseers.
"I don't think that you can expect to achieve
diversity in any given set of nominations," Chis
topher said, adding that diversity is something
"you have to work toward."
According to Burress, the overseers are
"selected from all walks of life," noting that
"they're selected because of their interest in the
Hoover Institution" as well as because of their
"prestige and prominence."
"We reach out for the very best people we can
find who are interested in serving," Burress
said. "We have some outstanding ladies on our
board of overseers, and I'm sure there will be
some additional ones in the future," he said.
