# Five Win Dean's Award For Superior Teaching
## 
### MICHAEL GOFF Staff writer 
Five winners of the 1984-85
Dean's Awards for Teaching were
announced last week by Prof. Nor
man Wessells, dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences. Past win
ners of the award came together
Nov. 25 at the Faculty Club to join a
ceremony in their honor on the 10th
anniversary of the award.
To many, it seems that Stanford
emphasizes research more than
teaching. But to receive tenure, ac
cording to Jane Edsell, assistant to
the dean of Humanities and
Sciences, there must be a balance
between all aspects of a professor's
performance. "You can't go over
board on research and expect to get
tenure. ... I think that the empha
sis is on keeping a certain balance."
She said that Wessels "wants to
emphasize teaching" and that
honoring those who have won
awards for teaching "can bring it to
the attention of others."
Quoting a 1976 issue of Campus
Report, she said the criteria for the
award include peer evaluations,

course planning, organization and
development, student responses to
faculty members' classroom teach
ing, kinds of teaching activities and
contact outside the classroom and
effectiveness in directing disserta
tions and other special projects.
This year's winners are Nancy
Kollman, assistant professor of his
tory; Debraj Ray, assistant profes
sor of economics; J. Dirk Walecka,
professor of physics; Robert
Osserman, professor of mathema
tics; and Nancy Packer, professor
of English.
Osserman received the award for
"encouraging good teaching" while
chairman of the Mathematics De
partment and for helping in the
creation and teaching of Values,
Technology, Science, and Society
(VTSS) 51,52, and 53. Wessells
called this "probably the most im
aginative course sequence taught at
Stanford."
Osserman said the inception of
the program came when he was at
tempting to address the "problems
of presenting mathematics in a way
that is more exciting and interesting
than it is in the standard courses."
Osserman also addressed the

balance between teaching and re
search. "To a certain extent they
reinforce each other. On the other
hand, to a certain extent they com
pete with each other for time and
energy."
However, he said that stu
dent expectations are not always
what they should be in terms of a
professor's style of teaching. "In a
general way, I feel that students'
perception of teaching is sometimes
superficial. Sometimes students
can get a lot out of a class where
the teacher is not a showman.
Packer, who received the award
for being "one of the best leaders of
freshman writing in the history of
Stanford, an outstanding teacher of
the novel and the short story, and a
brilliant contributor to the graduate
writing workshop," said she was
"delighted with the award, of
course."
Packer said she sees it as a step
in the right direction in terms of the
balance between research and
teaching. The awards "help to
redress the imbalance between re
search and teaching by telling the
University community that teaching
is important," she said.

Each award recipient will receive
a $750 salary increase, and non
tenured recipients will also be given
a special $3,000 research award.
The other three recipients of the
award were unavailable for com
ment yesterday afternoon.
According to Wessells' descrip
tions of his work, Ray received the

award for his "great knowledge,
clarity of exposition, organization
and enthusiasm for the subject mat
ter."
Kollman was "singled out for
careful planning and great knowl
edge of subject matter; she is a
masterful leader of colloquia, where
<shp skillfullv inserts her learnincr

the situation requires to keep dis
cussions flowing and to evoke par
ticipation by all students."
Walecka, Wessells says, is "welf<
known for his meticulous care in
preparing for every course and
class. His innovations in method
have been most effective in a vari
ety of courses."
