He remains in custody at the
Santa Clara County Jail with bail

charged with first-degree bur

Police have said they will file
four additional charges against
Suppes. The charges involve
thefts committed at Lambda Nu,
Phi Sig, Theta Chi and Bldg.

The cumulative $22,000 bail is
related to a number of charges
pending against Suppes in addi

to the charge on Nov. 15, and he

that charge is $1,000, according

Felony charges were also filed
in April against Suppes. The bail
for those charges is set at
$10,000, according to records at
