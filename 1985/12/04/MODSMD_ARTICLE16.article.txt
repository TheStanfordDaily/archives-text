Within a few days, the Music Department will
conclude negotiations with a confidential donor
which should lead to the creation of a new series
of courses in jazz, according to Music Depart
ment Director John Planting.
A key feature of this program will be retaining
Stan Getz, a well-known jazz saxophonist, as a
visiting artist for a full year starting winter quar
ter.

A "substantial" gift is anticipated from the
unnamed donor, said Planting. It will be comple
mented by fund-raising efforts spearheaded by
the Friends of Jazz, a local support group that in
cludes such members as Athletic Director Andy
Geiger and Psychiatry Prof. William De
ment, according to Planting.
Among the new courses will be a winter quar
ter course in jazz history. Although arrange
ments for an instructor have not yet been
finalized, candidates have been interviewed, and
a teacher should be hired shortly, said Planting.
Further courses in the series will include a

program in jazz theory during spring quarter and
an advanced jazz course next fall.
All of these programs will benefit from the
presence of Getz, who will "come in and talk
about jazz when he is here in between touring,"
said Planting.
The only jazz program currently available at'
Stanford is the jazz band, which is an ensemble
group concentrating on performance. According
to Planting, the new series of courses will sup
port the band by exposing people to the theory
and history behind the music.
