# Talbott Posts Predictions For U.S.-Soviet Relations
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
President Reagan would like to
negotiate an arms control agreement
before he leaves office, but will never
back a treaty that prohibits research on
weapons of defense.
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev will
continue to shun all U.S. proposals for
cuts in offensive weapons that are not ac
companied by "meaningful restrictions on
strategic defenses."
These are the predictions of Strobe
Talbott, Washington bureau chief of Time
magazine and an expert on U.S.-Soviet
relations and arms control.
Talbott, on campus to attend a seminar
at Stanford's Center for International Se
curity and Arms Control and to deliver
two speeches today, offered his views in

an interview with The Daily yesterday af
ternoon.
He said that on matters of substance at
last month's Geneva summit — referring
to arms control — "nothing was accom
plished."
But he called the summit "useful and
salutary," explaining that a face-to-face
meeting of the leaders improves the
climate of U.S.-Soviet relations and
changes the balance of forces in the two
governments, most notably by strength
ing the voice of moderates in the United
States.
In addition, he said the summits sched
uled for 1986 and '87 will be helpful both
to superpower relations and to arms con
trol. The summits not only will allow the
leaders to meet again but also will serve
as deadlines that may aid the negotiations
process, he said.
Talbott said it's "too early to tell"

whether Reagan, who has shown
flexibility in proposals on offensive arsen
als but remained firmly behind his Strate
gic Defense Initiative, will eventually use
SDI as a bargaining chip, but noted that
"keeping SDI alive is more important (to
Reagan) than getting an agreement." ;
"I don't think he will go for an agree
ment that means cancellation of [SDI],"
Talbott said.
He emphasized that Reagan, a good
negotiator who "knows how long to
stonewall and when to relent," is making
his own policy decisions.
By contrast, he called Gorbachev "a
vigorous, slick salesman for the Soviet po
sition," which is determined by a col
lective leadership.
Talbott will speak on "Views from the
Summit" at 7:30 tonight in Kresge
Auditorium. Admission is free.
