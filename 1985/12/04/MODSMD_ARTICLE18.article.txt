# Power Failure Wreaks Little Havoc
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
Power outages are always
nuisances, but the one that hit
campus early Monday morning
proved to have few serious
ramifications.
Wilbur Hall, Meyer Library,
parts of Encina Hall, Encina Gym,
the Athletic Department adminis
tration building, the Storke Stu
dent Publications Building and
Terra House were among the
"spotty" locations throughout
campus to phone in a loss of
power, according to Jeff Sultan,
manager of the power distribution
system. The outage was the
result of a "failure of connection

on a high voltage cable" in the
vicinity of the stadium, Sultan
said.
The outage started around
8:30 a.m. and lasted approxi
mately one hour. The stadium, in
late afternoon, was the last
edifice to regain electricity.
Fortunately, no major com
puter or critical research facilities
were affected, Sultan added. The
medical center also was not hit.
Inconveniences were minimal
to the affected buildings. At
Meyer, all except the emergency
power went out, but because it
was early morning, few if any
people lost material on the com
puters, according to Bob Kieft,
acting chief of Meyer library.
Socrates was also down for the

duration of the outage, Kieft said.
The only students incon
venienced at Wilbur were those
who slept through their morning
classes when their alarms failed
to go off. The only real disruption
was that the carburetor used to
operate the meal card machine
did not work.
Also, any Wilbur students wish
ing to do their laundry Monday
morning were stuck with dirty
clothes a little while longer.
According to Spyros Andre
opoulos, directer of the Medical
Center News Bureau, had the
power failure included medical
center facilities, an emergency
system would have taken over
immediately.
