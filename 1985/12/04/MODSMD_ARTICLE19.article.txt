# New Edifice To Augment Parking
## 
### MARY K. McDEVITT Staff writer 
Builders near Stanford Medical
Center broke ground for the Uni
versity's first multi-level parking
structure last week, and the con
struction may reflect early steps
toward urbanization of the campus.
Construction of the five-level
building "represents a transition
away from the notion of Stanford as
a Farm into one more of a city,"
said Jonathan Ryan, project
manager from the facilities project
management office.
The $9.4 million structure will be
built in the area now occupied by
the "A" and "C" permit parking lot
that is surrounded by the Anatomy
Building, Roth Way and Capmpus

Drive. It will hold up to 1,050 cars,
quadrupling the number of parking
spaces previously available on the
land.
The concrete structure should be
completed in the spring of 1987, al
though a severe winter this year or
next could delay the construction,
Ryan said.
A Parking Pro-rata Fund,
generated by taxing all new Univer
sity building projects at a rate of 3
percent, will fund the multi-million
dollar construction.
The architectural design, which
was selected over eight others in
August by a jury of nine University
faculty and staff and one UC-
Berkeley professor of architecture,
consists of "step-back" levels with
each floor receding from the one
below.

"It mitigates the feeling of
massiveness" of the 40,000 square
foot structure, Ryan said.
The design was also chosen for
its overall "crisp, modern quality"
which is akin to the medical center,
making the parking structure
"friendly" to the area around it, he
said.
Land foi parking is becoming in
creasingly limited as the University
continues putting up new buildings.
"The campus is expanding in terms
of numbers of departments and
numbers of faculty and students, in
particular at the medical center in
the last 10 years — and it will be
even more so in the next five,"
Ryan said.
Additional multi-level parking
structures will be built in the next
15 years, according to Ryan.
