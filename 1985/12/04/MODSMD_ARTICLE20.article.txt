Stanford's largest cheating scandal demands that
both students and the University reassess their re
sponsibilities to maintain academic honesty.
The 10 students found guilty of Honor Code viola
tions in Prof. Philip Zimbardo's Psychology 1 class
this spring were appropriately penalized. Although
most penalties were harsher than usual, the extent
of the violations was greater than usual: Some stu
dents collaborated on six or seven out of nine
quizzes, according to the report from Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole.
We expect that the two remaining students, if
found guilty, also will be penalized accordingly.
Penalizing the cheaters, however, is not enough.
Although the students are primarily to blame for
their behavior, the professor and the University
must also bear some of the responsibility for failing
to minimize temptations to cheat.
Both the class size — 744 students in an
auditorium incapable of seating that many people —
and the use of multiple-choice quizzes — adminis
tered with fill-in-the-bubble Scantron answer sheets
— seem to have contributed to a generally lax at

mosphere in the course. Students were disrespect
ful of their classmates, chatting during test ses
sions. Despite complaints and some efforts by
teaching assistants to quiet the disruptive students,
the situation did not improve.
The University must take steps to ensure that
such situations conducive to cheating do not occur
again.
Class size should be limited to available space and
resources. In-class tests should be given in quiet
rooms, and disruptive students should be dealt with
harshly. The format of the tests themselves should
discourage cheating: Multiple-choice tests are ex
tremely easy to copy.
Students, however, must be aware of their own
responsibilities.
No matter how strong the temptation to cheat, no
matter how easy it is to cheat, students are bourd
by both the Honor Code and simple ethics not to
cheat.
The University can make cheating more difficult,
but it is the student who makes the ultimate decision
to cheat or not to cheat.
