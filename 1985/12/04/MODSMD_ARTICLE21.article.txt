# Palo Alto's Example
## 
### 
The meeting lasted more than three hours, as
discussion focused on ways to contribute to the dis
mantling of apartheid, on how black South Africans
feel about disinvestment, on the legitimacy of trying
to make national policy in a local body and on
fiduciary responsibility.
What sounded suspiciously like a meeting of the
Stanford Board of Trustees discussing divestment
actually was a Palo Alto City Council meeting.
Unlike the Board of Trustees, however, Palo Alto
took a responsible stand by voting three to zero,
with two abstentions, to divest from all banks, finan
cial institutions and investment firms doing business
in South Africa.
Palo Alto thus joined a nationwide movement of
cities and states that have chosen divestment as a
means to express opposition to apartheid. The
American Committee on Africa, a national anti
apartheid organization, reports that 16 states, half a
dozen counties and at least 50 cities have passed
legislation banning or limiting investment in corpora
tions that operate in South Africa.
Such local initiatives weaken apartheid by pres
suring companies to pull out of South Africa and the

U. S. government to take a tougher stand on South
Africa. Though Palo Alto's investments are already
minimal, the city council's action should be com
mended as a contribution to such efforts. Stanford's
Board of Trustees should learn from the example.
The primary reason to divest, as was pointed out
both in the public hearing and by city council mem
bers, is to support self-determination for the black
people of South Africa.
Virtually every liberation organization and leader
in South Africa supports divestment. This weekend
the Congress of South African Trade Unions,
composed of 450,000 members (including
employees of U.S. corporations) joined this call.
Studies show the same: A recent Gallup Poll done in
conjunction with the London Sun Times showed that
72 percent of South African blacks support divest
ment. This, in a country where advocating divest
ment carries a penalty of imprisonment.
It is not for Palo Alto or Stanford to decide what is
best for the majority of people in South Africa. The
only reasonable response is to listen to and act upon
their demands for immediate and total divestment.
