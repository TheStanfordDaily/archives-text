# Fight Spies Carefully
## 
### 
1985 is rapidly becoming The Year of the Spy.
The most recent in a series of espionage scandals
involved Jonathon Jay Pollard, a 1976 Stanford
graduate who was arrested Nov. 21 for selling naval
and CIA codes to Israel.
The natural reaction to such security breaches is
tightening security and toughening clearance criteria,
but a nation that values freedom, individual liberty
and human rights must be careful in enacting restric
tions.
To that effect, Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger recently ordered new security
clearance tests for 60,000 military and civilian
employees with access to secret codes and cryp
tographic equipment at the Department of Defense
and the National Security Agency.
But tightened security inevitably infringes on indi
vidual rights and personal privacy. Already, security
clearances often involve polygraph examinations,
urine testing, credit checks and biographical inves
tigations. Homosexuals and alcoholics are denied
top secret clearances. Close friends are queried
concerning drug usage, personal relationships and
moral character. While this year has shown that se
curity improvements are clearly needed, we must
maintain the delicate balance between preserving in
dividual liberty and protecting vital nformation.
Non-threatening reforms might start with in

creased biographical investigation of those with
access to classified information and better coordina
tion between the various security agencies. An in
vestigation should go beyond merely contacting a
list of references provided by the subject of the in
quiry. The press has experienced no difficulty in
tracing Pollard's past questionable activities, and,
had Pollard's background been researched more
diligently, the recent incident could likely have been
averted.
Pollard's freshman roommate, Stephen LaPointe,
told The Daily, "I think had he been properly
screened, he would never have been admitted to an
intelligence agency." In his college days, Pollard
was known as a practical joker and for boasting that
he was a colonel in the Israeli army, LaPointe
added. Clearly, Pollard should not have been
allowed access to sensitive information.
As long as the United States possesses secrets
that other nations want to steal, protection from
spying will remain a legitimate national concern.
However, the recent rash of incidents and arrests
should not stampede the United States into enacting
rash changes that discriminate against entire groups
of people and that blatantly infringe on individual
privacy rights. The challenge for our free society is
protecting individual freedom while fighting for na
tional security.
