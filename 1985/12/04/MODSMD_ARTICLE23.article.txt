# Forceful Decisions
## 
### 
When terrorists began assassinating passengers
aboard a hijacked Egypt Air 737 last Sunday in Val
letta, Malta, Maltese and Egyptian authorities were
faced with a difficult decision: whether to storm the
plane and risk the lives of those aboard or to stand
by and allow the executions to continue.
After what must have been a painful debate, the
Egyptian army chose what it hoped would be the
lesser of two evils. As Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak said, there was "no other solution," given
the fact that the hijackers were planning to kill a pas
senger every half hour. Despite the ensuing
shootout in which 57 people were killed, the deci
sion was the right one.
Although force is rarely the responsible decision,
in this case the hijackers, apparently members of a
renegade Palestinian group, showed no willingness
to negotiate the release of the hostages and gave
every indication that they planned to systematically
slaughter the plane's 98 passengers and crew mem
bers.
The plane's captain, Hani Galal, who was
wounded after killing one of the hijackers with an
axe, said that the terrorist leader "was not touched
by the killings" and "was making small jokes" after
the executions of two Israeli women. Clearly, these

ten ousts were not even on the level of those who
hijacked a TWA plane in Beirut this summer and
negotiated their demands in a more reasonable man
ner.
The problem with last week's incident was not
the decision to go ahead with the raid, but the man
ner in which it was conducted. Although exactly
what happened during the 10-minute shoot-out be
tween 25 Egyptian troops and the band of hijackers
remains unclear, most witnesses agree that the
Egyptian force exploded a hole in the plane's
baggage compartment, entered the plane and began
shooting in a somewhat disorganized way. The
hijackers responded to the assault by exploding
three hand grenades in the passenger cabin and ig
niting a fire which choked more than 40 passengers
to death. Minutes later, 57 passengers and all but
one of the hijackers lay dead either because of bullet
wounds or asphyxiation. Forces designed to counter
hijacking must learn from this incident and improve
their tactics.
But the nations most frequently victimized by ter
rorism must realize that using force to counter
hijackings will almost always lead to similar bloody
results. Force must be used only when all chances
of peaceful negotiation are exhausted and the lives
ot innocent victims are immediately at stake.
