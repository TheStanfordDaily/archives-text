# Sit Down With Your Principles
## 
### 
Have you ever been to a rock concert? At every
concert the same thing happens. Everyone in the
crowd wants to see the musicians and how they experi
ence their music, and everyone wants to hear the
music before it bounces off the stadium walls. So the
crowd pushes forward to get close to the stage.
Everybody is pushing and shoving, but nobody gets
anywhere; most everyone is pretty happy to be where
they are, and it occurs to every individual in the crowd
that he would be better off if everyone just sat down.
But nobody dares sit down because they're all afraid
that if they do, they'll get trampled by the others and
not be able to see and hear the concert that was so ex
pensive. Nobody trusts the others enough to sit down.

Well, in the three days before Thanksgiving, I atten
ded a very important, trend-setting concert, and I'm
happy to report the news. We no longer have to stand
up and push each other to get what we want. We can all
sit down.
A little explanation is necessary. It wasn't really a
concert — it was a conference. But I call it a concert
because it was exciting and entertaining. The concert
was titled "Business Tomorrow XI: American Innova
tion in a Changing World" and was put on by Business
Today magazine and the Foundation for Student Com
munication, both of Princeton University. The concert
brought together over 150 leaders of the American
business community and an equal number of American
student leaders to discuss the future economic produc
tivity of our nation. It was held in Houston, Texas, and
— yes — they did pay our way.
I consider myself a person of principle, and I am
confident enough about those principles to subject
them to popular scrutiny in this column. I also know a
great deal about the process of innovation in a changing
world, thanks to my Stanford education. I went to the
conference with a skeptical edge. I was expecting my
principles and ideas to be attacked by the dogs of the
business world.

At the conference, I found myself frequently at the
microphone questioning these leaders about principles
and ideas. Instead of being swarmed with disagree
ment, however, I found most everyone else had prin
ciples, too. The other conference participants wanted
to talk about principles, learn and listen, just as I did.
Most importantly, the other participants felt that they
were in their positions in the business community not
in spite of their principles, but because of their prin
ciples.
These people agreed that the key to a successful
future is not denying the needs of the individual, but al
lowing the individual to express himself. Most of the
business executives agreed that a liberal arts major is
more valuable than a major that gives job-specific train
ing. Well-rounded graduates who can communicate
with others are essential. They agreed the world
needs more creative people who can think of new
ideas. They want personnel who like their work, not
people who look at their work as a means to some
other end. They want happy employees, not ones who
would forsake their happiness.
I've been writing in this column that we must not
sacrifice our principles, or we'll end up unhappy in the
end. Now my message is a little different. We can get
what we want by not sacrificing our principles. It is
possible to get the best of both worlds. It may take
time to do that, but the opportunity is there.
So many of us in college believe we will have to
sacrifice principles to get ahead. We see the situation
as a trade-off. Far too often, we abandon our principles
before we even try to see if they're accepted. We fight
and climb over each other for jobs and grades, afraid
that if we don't suspend our principles and push and
shove, we will end up far behind, out of reach of our
goals.
In so many ways, we act like the crowd at a rock
concert. We all know we'd be better off if we quit push
ing and shoving and just sat down. If we sat down,
there would be room to breathe, even to lie down and
relax at times. Yet we're all afraid to do it because we
run the risk of ending up behind in the race and out of
sight of the musicians. Too few of us sit down with our
principles and trust our neighbors. We're still at that
concert, pushing forward and back, stepping on each
other to get ahead.
The message that came from the conference in
Houston was clear and refreshing. Originality and sin
cerity will be respected. The people with the prin
ciples, people who follow their desires, are most happy
and sure of themselves. We don't need to stand and
push any more. We can all sit down.

crowd wants to see the musicians and how they experi
ence their music, and everyone wants to hear the
music before it bounces off the stadium walls. So the
crowd pushes forward to get close to the stage.
Everybody is pushing and shoving, but nobody gets
anywhere; most everyone is pretty happy to be where
they are, and it occurs to every individual in the crowd
that he would be better off if everyone just sat down.
But nobody dares sit down because they're all afraid
that if they do, they'll get trampled by the others and
not be able to see and hear the concert that was so ex
pensive. Nobody trusts the others enough to sit down.

Well, in the three days before Thanksgiving, I atten
ded a very important, trend-setting concert, and I'm
happy to report the news. We no longer have to stand
up and push each other to get what we want. We can all
sit down.
A little explanation is necessary. It wasn't really a
concert — it was a conference. But I call it a concert
because it was exciting and entertaining. The concert
was titled "Business Tomorrow XI: American Innova
tion in a Changing World" and was put on by Business
Today magazine and the Foundation for Student Com
munication, both of Princeton University. The concert
brought together over 150 leaders of the American
business community and an equal number of American
student leaders to discuss the future economic produc
tivity of our nation. It was held in Houston, Texas, and
— yes — they did pay our way.
I consider myself a person of principle, and I am
confident enough about those principles to subject
them to popular scrutiny in this column. I also know a
great deal about the process of innovation in a changing
world, thanks to my Stanford education. I went to the
conference with a skeptical edge. I was expecting my
principles and ideas to be attacked by the dogs of the
business world.

At the conference, I found myself frequently at the
microphone questioning these leaders about principles
and ideas. Instead of being swarmed with disagree
ment, however, I found most everyone else had prin
ciples, too. The other conference participants wanted
to talk about principles, learn and listen, just as I did.
Most importantly, the other participants felt that they
were in their positions in the business community not
in spite of their principles, but because of their prin
ciples.
These people agreed that the key to a successful
future is not denying the needs of the individual, but al
lowing the individual to express himself. Most of the
business executives agreed that a liberal arts major is
more valuable than a major that gives job-specific train
ing. Well-rounded graduates who can communicate
with others are essential. They agreed the world
needs more creative people who can think of new
ideas. They want personnel who like their work, not
people who look at their work as a means to some
other end. They want happy employees, not ones who
would forsake their happiness.
I've been writing in this column that we must not
sacrifice our principles, or we'll end up unhappy in the
end. Now my message is a little different. We can get
what we want by not sacrificing our principles. It is
possible to get the best of both worlds. It may take
time to do that, but the opportunity is there.
So many of us in college believe we will have to
sacrifice principles to get ahead. We see the situation
as a trade-off. Far too often, we abandon our principles
before we even try to see if they're accepted. We fight
and climb over each other for jobs and grades, afraid
that if we don't suspend our principles and push and
shove, we will end up far behind, out of reach of our
goals.
In so many ways, we act like the crowd at a rock
concert. We all know we'd be better off if we quit push
ing and shoving and just sat down. If we sat down,
there would be room to breathe, even to lie down and
relax at times. Yet we're all afraid to do it because we
run the risk of ending up behind in the race and out of
sight of the musicians. Too few of us sit down with our
principles and trust our neighbors. We're still at that
concert, pushing forward and back, stepping on each
other to get ahead.
The message that came from the conference in
Houston was clear and refreshing. Originality and sin
cerity will be respected. The people with the prin
ciples, people who follow their desires, are most happy
and sure of themselves. We don't need to stand and
push any more. We can all sit down.
