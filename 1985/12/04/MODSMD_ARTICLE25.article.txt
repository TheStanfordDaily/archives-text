Black Enrollment
Figure Incorrect
My letter regarding the Univer
sity of Cape Town in South Africa
(The Daily, Nov. 25) requires a
correction. The figure of 18 per
cent was apparently given to me as
an approximately correct estimate
of non-white enrollment at the
university, not black enrollment.
The latter, though growing, is
much smaller. My main point was
that the university, though techni
cally white by government designa
tion, is deliberately becoming inte
grated through the courageous
policies of its vice-chancellor; that
is unaffected by the correction.
