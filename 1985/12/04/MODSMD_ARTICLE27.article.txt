# Stanford Makes a List for Santa
## 
### 
Just in case you haven't peeked at your advent
calendar yet, the Christmas holiday season has
officially begun. This week hundreds of Stanford
"Secret Santas" are scurrying about, wanning
the stomachs and papering the doors of "Secret
Santees." The Christmas department in Macys
has been up for nearly a month now, and Santa
has just recently resumed his position as a de
partment store liaison. This year's Neiman-
Marcus Christmas Catalog is already in the mail
too: For $37,500 Neiman's can have Santa stuff
your stocking with matching polo ponies. (That's
nothing, of course, compared to the set of "his
and hers" live ostriches offered a few years ago.)
Those with a true eye for fashion might appreci
ate the less expensive "doggie Santa suit." Yet,
as good Santees know, the holiday season means
more than gift -giving. It means So
last week I spent a few days asking the good
boys and girls on campus what they were wish
ing the most for on Christmas. Here's what I
found:
Having such an important question in mind,
my first visit was, of course, to the information
window at Old Union. There I met Richard Mal
donado, a former Stanford student who answers
all sorts of questions every day and certainly
deserves a quiet rest from time to time. "I need
a Hawaiian vacation," he said, "write that." Rich
ard said he'd like a new place to live too, al
though I suspect a new house might be a bit
much to fit down a chimney.
I gave Michael Collins, a member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents, a call next. We play poker
together on Tuesday nights; he wins a lot, but
sometimes he's still amusing. This year Mike
said he is wishing for "a boxed set of the new,
digitally re-mastered copies of every album the
Bay City Rollers ever produced." According to
him, "That would just be the best Christmas
ever."
The best Christmas for Lorie Keim, a sales
woman at the flower stand in White Plaza, seems
just a bit more practical. "I'd like to win the Cali
fornia State Lottery," she said, " — the $10,000
instant prize. I play the lottery every week."
When I asked Heidi Molbak, a cashier at The
Store, about the top wish on her Christmas list,
she said, "a new wool coat for my corporate mis
sion to New York this January."
During my rounds as Santa's temporary elf, I
also found a few individuals who preferred
making wishes for other people. Irene Servern,
head of circulation at Meyer Library, told me the
best present she can imagine is the "perfect job"
for her daughter, who is graduating from UC-
Davis this month. Gary Andrews, owner of the
Campus Shell service station, says it is impor

tant for Stanford to have a good football team.
"We need it for our personal image and happi
ness."
In the Stanford Bookstore, Dean Seldom
ridge, working behind the calculator counter,
took a more philosophical approach. "I know this
will sound altruistic, but I wish for . . . peace. I
really do. I know it sounds corny, but I do."
Prof. Lucio Ruotolo, of the English Department,
voiced concern over a more specific aspect of in
ternational relations. "I wish that Ronald Reagan
would be more flexible on the issue of SDI (the
Strategic Defense Initiative), and that he would
be more affected by the arguments against it."

Hoping to get a scientific perspective on the
holiday seasons, I next phoned Asst. Geology
Prof. David Larue. Unfortunately, our conversa
tion was just a little strange.
"Hi, Professor Larue," I said, "I'm writing a
column for The Daily and ..."
"The Daily! Well, I wish you'd stop bothering
me. I was not in San Francisco on Nov. 21. I was
not in that bar, and I don't even know his sister
— at least not very well."
"But I just want to know what you're wishing
for Christmas."
"A fanny-lift!" Click.
Just to be fair, Larue did call me back a day
later and said his real Christmas wish was the

"end of the world's cellulite problem."
Not everyone, of course, can be as subtle as
David Larue. John, the man who delivered a
Domino's pizza to me a few nights ago, explained
he's asking Santa for a "lover." "I need one
serious," he said. Two women working behind
the counter at Tresidder's Baker Street declined
to answer my question, saying I probably
couldn't put their wishes in print anyway.
If anyone deserves more than one request
from Santa this year, it's probably Dean of Ad
missions Jean Fetter, who may soon be caught in
a blizzard of Stanford applications this winter.
Her wish requires first limbering up your voice
and thfen taking a deep breath. Here goes:
"Twelve readers reading, eleven extra mailmen,
ten typists typing, nine helpers helping, eight
hours sleeping, seven stampers stamping, six
swimmers signing, five . . . filers . . . filing, four
phoners phoning, three months of reading, two
weeks of waiting, and one great class coming!"
This season, even a university president
doesn't have everything — University President
Donald Kennedy offered this modest wish: "All I
want for Christmas is the Near West campus,
600 units of faculty housing, 20 professorial
chairs in the humanities, a Rose Bowl victory
and a hospital that every patient can love."
You can learn a lot about people just by asking
what they're wishing for on Christmas. And this
year the people at Stanford are spiking their
holiday season with healthy doses of altruism,
sincere thought and inventive fun. It sounds
corny — as Dean Seldomridge would say — but
it's true. As for me, I'm thinking I would like a
couple of those "doggie Santa suits" from
Neiman-Marcus. They'd look great on my twin
ostriches from last year.
