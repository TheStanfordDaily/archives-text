## Clear Policy Needed 
### 
Each time a new article or
viewpoint about the University's
policy on behavior related to al
cohol appears in The Daily, I
have questions such as those
Steve Zahm reflected quite well
in his viewpoint, "No More Res
EcJ Games" (The Daily, Nov.
20).

VIEWPOINT

A viewpoint written by Sally
Cole, University judicial affairs
officer, appeared two days later
in response to Zahm, but unfor
tunately was not very helpful.
While Cole made clear the fact
that University President Donald
Kennedy was responsible for
this spring's application of the
Fundamental Standard against a
student accused of driving under
the influence of alcohol, she
failed to clarify Stanford's
vague and confusing policy
toward student behavior in gen
eral and drunk driving in partic
ular.
On the issue of driving under
the influence of alcohol, Cole
claims that a precedent now
exists as a result of the Ander
son case this spring. In fact, she
writes that Anderson's suspen
sion was stayed "because — and
only because — the decision es
tablished a precedent about
which there was no advance
notice to the community."
I disagree with this method of
making University policy known,
but, more importantly, I ques
tion whether a policy was set.
The only precedent I can gather
is that being arrested by the
police — whether convicted
later or not — may be sufficient
to be found guilty of violating the
Fundamental Standard. Cole
points to four vague criteria the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
specified, such as "time and
place the vehicle was driven," as
though these might provide
some guidance for future action.

Yet even Assoc. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Norm Robinson ob
served (The Daily, Nov. 13) that
it is "awfully hard to draw any
vast generalizations" about Uni
versity policy toward students
guilty of driving drunk. So, what
is the precedent?
In addition to this issue, Cole
mentioned the existence of other
areas where "irresponsible be
havior may be viewed as a viola
tion of the Fundamental Stan
dard." I find myself wondering
what behavior might be consid
ered irresponsible enough to
deserve a "precedent"-setting,
stayed suspension. Before this
year, I would not have thought of
drinking games as a possible can
didate. Now, however, RAs are
supposed to break up such
games. Codes of student con
duct, I agree with Cole, are
meant "to guide and encourage
thoughtful choice among behav
ioral options." However, I do not
understand how Cole expects
students "to accept responsibil
ity for poor choices" when the
"poor choices" are redefined at
the will of University officials and
the level of responsibility is un
defined.
Beyond questions regarding
University policy (Res Ed, SJC,
or other) on specific issues, the
real question is what student re
sponsibility is for "poor" behav
ioral options. I can easily under
stand Stanford holding students
responsible for behavior related
to academia, such as cheating or
plagiarism.
If, however, the University
wants to impose an extra burden
beyond what I accept as personal
and legal responsibility for my
"poor" behavior in areas not in
herently related to Stanford, I
would like to have the specific
areas and burdens stated openly
and explicitly.
