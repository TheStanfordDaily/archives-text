# COP To Finalize New Constitution
## 
### DAVID EMERSON Staff writer 
As the Dec. 13 deadline draws
near, members of the ASSU Coun
cil of Presidents and collaborating
ASSU senators are scrambling to
ready the final version of their pro
posal for a new ASSU constitution.
Six hundred and fifty valid
signatures (5 percent of the student
body) are needed by midnight, Dec.
13, in order to qualify the document
for a special election scheduled for
Jan. 28 and 29. The backers of the
new constitution plan to have a final
version of it completed by tomor
row and to begin gathering
signatures during lunch tomorrow
or Friday, according to Senate
Chair Carey White.
The authors hope to have at least
1,000 signatures by the deadline,
White said.
COP members Mike Collins,
Andy Frisch, Leslie Leland and Tim
Quirk have been working with

senators Jim DeLaHunt, Mary
Thurber, White and Deputy Chair
Ed Renwick in order to put the
document in final form.
As set out in the most recent
draft, the proposal would divide the
senate into two separate bodies,
the Policy Board and the Funds
Board. Each would consist of eight
members (four undergraduates and
four graduates) and a chair.
Students would be able to vote
for only two candidates on each
board, compared with the current
system which allows them to vote
for up to 10 senatorial candidates.
The Policy Board would oversee
the ASSU operating budget, help
initiate new student projects and
set general policy.
The Funds Board would deal
with student group funding.
The document also creates the
position of an administrative
manager, who would be directed to
help develop new student services
and assist the COP and the boards.
The Council of Presidents would
be reduced from four to three
members, and each member would
be assigned specific tasks. The
council would still be elected as a
slate.
Also changed would be the pro
cedure for putting initiatives and
referendums on the ballot. Under
the current constitution, any
proposition can be placed on the
ballot for the next available election
through a petition by 5 percent of
the students. The number of
signatures necessary to call a spe
cial election, however, has been in
creased from 5 to 15 percent.
A special election to overturn an
act of the Policy Board would re
quire only the signatures of 10 per
cent of the student body.
Yet to be finalized are the selec
tion and duties of the board chairs,
the exact duties of the Policy Board
and certain names and titles.
The completion of the new con
stitution culminates months of work
by the COP members to make good
on their promise to radically alter
the senate. The old system, ac
cording to COP member Collins,
has become too large and un
responsive. He expects the new
streamlined system to better serve
student needs.
White agrees. "Under the old
system, when people had to vote
for 10 senators, they ended up
picking people at random. The new
constitution is better because can
didates run for specific jobs, and
students can vote for people they
know. It should ultimately make the
senate more . . . efficient."
