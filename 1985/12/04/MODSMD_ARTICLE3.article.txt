# COP To Finalize New Constitution
## 
### DAVID EMERSON Staff writer 
As the Dec. 13 deadline draws
near, members of the ASSU Coun
cil of Presidents and collaborating
ASSU senators are scrambling to
ready the final version of their pro
posal for a new ASSU constitution.
Six hundred and fifty valid
signatures (5 percent of the student
body) are needed by midnight, Dec.
13, in order to qualify the document
for a special election scheduled for
Jan. 28 and 29. The backers of the
new constitution plan to have a final
version of it completed by tomor
row and to begin gathering
signatures during lunch tomorrow
or Friday, according to Senate
Chair Carey White.
The authors hope to have at least
1,000 signatures by the deadline,
White said.
COP members Mike Collins,
Andy Frisch, Leslie Leland and Tim
Quirk have been working with

senators Jim DeLaHunt, Mary
Thurber, White and Deputy Chair
Ed Renwick in order to put the
document in final form.
As set out in the most recent
draft, the proposal would divide the
senate into two separate bodies,
the Policy Board and the Funds
Board. Each would consist of eight
members (four undergraduates and
four graduates) and a chair.
Students would be able to vote
for only two candidates on each
board, compared with the current
system which allows them to vote
for up to 10 senatorial candidates.
The Policy Board would oversee
the ASSU operating budget, help
initiate new student projects and
set general policy.
The Funds Board would deal
with student group funding.
The document also creates the
position of an administrative
manager, who would be directed to
help develop new student services
