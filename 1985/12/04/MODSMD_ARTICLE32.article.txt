# 1970 — A Timely Perspective on Activism
## 
### WILMA LEE 
The protesters of 1970 and those of today
make for a strange comparison, yet a look
back at that year offers a new perspective
and a reference from which to better
comprehend the student activism 0f1985,
during which 54 protesters were arrested
in anti-apartheid demonstrations.

In 1970, violent activism among
Stanford students began at a Feb.
16 torchlight parade — when 350 to
500 students and community mem
bers marched down El Camino
Real, throwing rocks and bricks and
shattering windows of banks and
other buildings.
The protesters, campaigning
against the sentencing of two
defense attorneys for contempt in
the Chicago 7 Conspiracy trial,
began the evening at Memorial
Auditorium with a Huey P. Newton
birthday rally.
Newton was a jailed member of
the Black Panther party.
The crowd smashed more win
dows at Hoover Tower and shouted
such slogans as "Free Huey, Smash
the State" and "Free the Conspir
acy 7."
"The rampaging violence stems
in no small way from a rage born of
recognition that the Chicago Con
spiracy trial was an onslaught on
the subculture of which radical stu
dents were a part," according to a
Daily editorial that appeared on
April 3, 1970.
The Chicago 7 was a group of
seven radical protesters tried for
charges of conspiring to incite riots
at the Chicago Democratic conven
tion in August 1968.
After an emotional and contro
versial five-month trial, the seven
were found innocent of inciting a
riot — while five of the defendants
were found guilty of lesser charges,
three for contempt of court.
In reaction, the two defense at
torneys called the judge's rulings
"outrageous" and "unfair." One at
torney said at another time that the
defendants were going to jail "in a
legal lynching."
The judge held the lawyers in
contempt of court for those com
ments and sentenced one to 48
months and the other to 20 months
in jail.
"I recognize the obligation of a
lawyer to defend a client with vigor
for his client's full benefit of law,"
acknowledged the trial's judge,
Julius Hoffman.
He added that the conduct of the
two attorneys exceeded "the
bounds of legal propriety" and that
the court was obligated to deal ap
propriately with that conduct.
The American Civil Liberties

Union attacked the summary cita
tions against the two lawyers as an
"unconstitional use of judicial
power."
One of the sentenced attorneys,
in response, said, "I am not sorry
for any acts in the conduct of
defending my clients. I only hope
my fate does not deter other
lawyers who will be asked to defend
clients against the encroaching
federal government."
This protest reflected a change in
the basis for student protests in
1970: Whereas protesters in 1969
were focusing attention on Stan
ford's involvement in chemical and
biological war research, by 1970,
anger about racism in this country
and sentiment against all U.S. in
volvement in the second Indo
chinese war were running high
throughout the nation.
When faculty approval for a lim
ited academic credit option for the
Army Reserve Officer's Training
Corps (ROTC) was announced
March 30, 1970, students reacted
violently.
In 1970, ROTC represented, in
the minds of many, "a part of the
war machine responsible for
slaughtering hundreds of thousands
of Southeast Asians so that Thieu
and Ky and the military-industrial
complex could all go on functioning
very nicely," activist Larry Dia
mond said in that year.
The presence of ROTC on
campus, much less with credit,
rekindled student anger and cul
minated in five consecutive nights
of violence and destruction.
Student demonstrators led police
on what The Daily termed "merry
go-round chases" throughout the
campus, and the rock-throwing,
window-smashing mobs caused
thousands of dollars in damage.
Demonstrators hoped that these
nightly "trashings" of the campus
would make it too costly for ROTC
to remain here, and a continuous
program of terrorism was envi
sioned.
Other students, such as ASSU
Senator Doug McHenry, took a line
against this method of protest
saying, "We want to politicize
people, not alienate them. The
negative actions now outweigh the
issue."
Warnings were issued by police
that rock-throwing protesters could
be charged with assault with a
deadly weapon, a felony punishable

by up to 10 years in prison and a
$5,000 fine. The rock-throwing
continued.
On April 2, a senior physics
major was arrested in White Plaza
for possessing a Molotov cocktail
and apparently attempting to ignite
his car, which had the word
"BURN" written in foot-high letters
on both sides of it.
Even KZSU was evacuated due
to bomb threats, and it had to
broadcast from a remote unit to
stay on the air.
Antagonism toward the Univer
sity's stance on academic credit for
ROTC fell upon then-University
President Kenneth Pitzer.
One student threw red paint all
over Pitzer's back and shoulders as
he was leaving a function. Pitzer's
office was a frequent target of rock
hurling protesters, and his home
was a repeated target of vandals
and phone calls.
On April 15, 8,000 people filled
Frost Amphitheater at dawn to join
Americans across the country in an
April Moratorium to protest the
Vietnam War. 60,000 gathered on
the Boston Common, and 20,000
gathered at New York's Bryant
Park to participate in the first major
anti-war protest since the Novem
ber 15, 1969 rallies in San Fran
cisco and Washington D.C.
For Prof. M.N. Srinivas, consid
ered to be India's leading social

scientist, the violence of 1970 left
its marks on what he may have
considered the worst year of his
life. He was completing research at
the Center for Advanced Study in
the Behavioral Sciences when it
became the target of an arsonist's
firebombs. Srinivas' life work on
caste systems in South India,
compiled over 22 years, was com
pletely destroyed.
"What is lost is the irreplaceable
product of a great scientist from In
dia where his science is sorely
needed," said one colleague of
Srinivas.
Srinivas, whose mother had died
the week before, left the smoulder
ing ruins of his office in tears.
April ended with an explosion of
intense fighting when police tried to
break up a non-violent, anti-ROTC
sit-in at Old Union. The most in
tense fighting took place in White
Plaza after police were showered
with an intense barrage of rocks.
More than 200 sherriff's
deputies, armed with riot equip
ment and tear gas, battled more
than 800 students throughout the
campus. During this violent night of
fires, bombs and rock-throwing,
two incidents of allegedly racist
police brutality took place. '
Burnell Mack, a black junior
majoring in political science, was al
legedly standing among a group of
white protesters, singled out and

beaten so badly by police that he
could barely walk.
In a related incident, Bijay
Sharma, an Indian graduate student
of dark complexion, alleged
that he was beaten by police be
cause they thought he was black.
Sharma suffered a fractured
cheekbone, but was not given
treatment until two days after his
beating when he and Mack entered
Cowell Student Health Center.

On April 30, another evening
rampage of extreme violence
resulted in unprecedented damage
to buildings, repeated use of tear
gas by police, and injuries to a
policeman, whose leg was broken
by a rock hurled by a protester.

"Should the University determine that continuation of some or
all academic and other campus activities . . . involves a high
degree of physical danger to persons or property, activities may
be curtailed and students requested or required to leave the
campus."
