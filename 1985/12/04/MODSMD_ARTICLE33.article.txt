# Chapel Dean Remembers South African Home
## 
### THOMAS HAYS 
When it is hot and dry on Highway 5 or
points farther inland, I think of Graaff-
Reinet, the "Gem of Karroo" as the Chamber
of Commerce hopefully calls it. ... A village
in the desert, it is locus of the Union High
School, where I was a boarder from the age of
eight. Heat, the song of cicadas, the pop of the
cricket ball on the bat, the sparkling green of
the sports fields in the shadow of barren
Mount Spandau, the thud of bodies, includ
ing one's own, in the rugby game, and the
willingness to die for the honor of the team -
these things come back with the smell of the
desert.
- Rev. Robert Hamerton-Kelly
The Stanford Magazine, Fall 1985
Robert Hamerton-Kelly's South Africa is
a world free of racial strife.
There are no black rebels hurling stones
at riot police, only white students bowling
cricket balls at the wicket.
There are no blacks losing their lives in
anti-apartheid protests, only zealous rugby
players sacrificing their bodies in a push
toward the goal line.
The economy is robust. The living is
easy. The servants are black and, by all ap
pearances, content.
Of course, this world no longer exists. It
was the South Africa Hamerton-Kelly knew
while he was growing up in the 1940s and '50s.
Yet when asked to write about his
"homeland," he could not help indulging in
sentimental reflection.
A native of Capetown, Hamerton-Kelly,
46, is dean of the chapel at Stanford
Memorial Church.
As a teacher, counselor and preacher, he
is a prominent figure on a campus increas
ingly disturbed by unrest in his native
country. But unlike some of his clerical col
leagues, he has kept silent on the issue.
"I become more and more successful at
simply deflecting questions," he said
recently.
It's not that he's indifferent. When finally
drawn out, he gets to the point.
"Apartheid," he said, "is stupid."
These days, with South Africa on the
brink of a race war, he said he's all too
aware of how far behind reality has left his
childhood memories. With his mother and
two brothers still living in South Africa, bad
news has become a daily burden.
"Every time I read a newspaper, I think
of them," he said.

His reluctance to make a public stand,
"has to do with feelings," he said in a slow
and thoughtful drawl with traces of a South
African accent that sounds English to the
American ear.
"It has to do with feelings — feelings of
dismay at the impending collapse of an or
derly society in which my own past is im
bedded.
"I know I should be more rationally just,
but I have to admit I experience a great am
bivalence. I can't view dispassionately the
threats to my family and to people I grew
up with. On the other hand, they seemed to
have earned it through their stupidity."
For the first 19 years of his life,
Hamerton-Kelly was blind to that stupidity.
The son of a Dutch Afrikaaner mother
and an Irish father who inherited his wealth
from the British shipping trade, the young
South African enjoyed the life of the
privileged class.

That meant black servants, boarding
school and rugby.
"Every white male in South Africa plays
rugby," he said, his wide jaw breaking into
a knowing grin.
Like many whites, he was oblivious to the
injustices of absolute racial segregation.
Today, he makes no apologies.
"I was a young person enthusiastically in
volved in life as it was presented to me," he
said. "It never occurred to me that anything
should be different.
"If you never see a black person in a role
other than servile, you can't imagine any
thing being different. I had black servants.
They seemed to be happy. Why should one
question?"
Finally, thanks to the Methodist Church,
he did question.
"I puzzled over what I saw as an incon
gruity between race relations and what I

heard preached in the chuches," he said.
Encouraged by a minister in his boarding
school, he turned toward a life in the clergy
and at age 19 left his country to attend
Cambridge University. Later, he attended
theological school in Chicago and New York
City.
"As my studies progressed, I became
less and less convinced South Africa was
the place to be," he said.
He found just one way to deal with the
hypocrisy of white supremacy in a Christian
society — he never went back.
He has been at Stanford since 1973, and
today the South African transplant appears
comfortable.
In a climate that mirrors South Africa's,
he walks five minutes to school every day.
He has three children, two of them Stan
ford students.
For lack of rugby, he has adopted profes
sional football as his favorite spectator

sport. He said he is a 49er fan.
Hamerton-Kelly has made the adjust
ment. He's American.
But in an environment where .South
Africa is the hot issue, he can't forgfct. He
believes his employer should adopt a policy
of "selective divestment," selling its\stock
in companies that embrace racist polices.
Many students would support that j>osi
tion. Though "delighted they're alive fb the
issue," he questions the priorities of stu
dents who have joined campus protests.
"There are other issues like Central
America that should be addressed," he
said. "Why so gentle on the United States
and so hard on South Africa when the
United States is acting like a state
vis-a-vis Nicaragua?" he asked while sitting
in his office that offers a partial view of the
Quad, a popular protest site.
Students who direct protests against a
distant society "vent their moral indignation
at the lowest possible personal cost,"he
said.
Student protest, university divestment,
economic sanctions, even concessions from
South Africa President Pieter Botha — in
Hamerton-Kelly's eyes, nothing will make a
difference.
South Africa's future? At first, he only
can tilt back his full head of silver hair and
sigh.
He said his ideal is the emergence of a
"multi-racial society in which all races par
ticipate in government and elect leaders
based on merit alone."
This is a "fantasy," he said, one not even
realized in the United States.
For South Africa, it's too late, Hamerton-
Kelly said. Apartheid came at a high cost,
now it's time to pay up, he said.
"I can't remember a time when I was
ever hopeful," he said. "I have a feeling that
for the last 30 years, whites have not been
facing the real issue, but pursuing a fantasy.
If you want to live peacefully, you have to
share power honestly.
"The whites have power and wealth. No
one in their right mind would give that up,
at least not for moral reasons. I know that's
a cynical thing to say, but it's true. I think
things are moving toward some type of
war."
Hamerton-Kelly said he plans to travel to
South Africa in December, his third trip in
26 years.
He looks forward to visiting family, but
he knows he can never go home again.
"It's a very sad business for me," he
said.

As a teacher, counselor and preacher, he
is a prominent figure on a campus increas
ingly disturbed by unrest in his native
country. But unlike some of his clerical col
leagues, he has kept silent on the issue.
"I become more and more successful at
simply deflecting questions," he said
recently.
It's not that he's indifferent. When finally
drawn out, he gets to the point.
"Apartheid," he said, "is stupid."
These days, with South Africa on the
brink of a race war, he said he's all too
aware of how far behind reality has left his
childhood memories. With his mother and
two brothers still living in South Africa, bad
news has become a daily burden.
"Every time I read a newspaper, I think
of them," he said.

His reluctance to make a public stand,
"has to do with feelings," he said in a slow
and thoughtful drawl with traces of a South
African accent that sounds English to the
American ear.
"It has to do with feelings — feelings of
dismay at the impending collapse of an or
derly society in which my own past is im
bedded.
"I know I should be more rationally just,
but I have to admit I experience a great am
bivalence. I can't view dispassionately the
threats to my family and to people I grew
up with. On the other hand, they seemed to
have earned it through their stupidity."
For the first 19 years of his life,
Hamerton-Kelly was blind to that stupidity.
The son of a Dutch Afrikaaner mother
and an Irish father who inherited his wealth
from the British shipping trade, the young
South African enjoyed the life of the
privileged class.

That meant black servants, boarding
school and rugby.
"Every white male in South Africa plays
rugby," he said, his wide jaw breaking into
a knowing grin.
Like many whites, he was oblivious to the
injustices of absolute racial segregation.
Today, he makes no apologies.
"I was a young person enthusiastically in
volved in life as it was presented to me," he
said. "It never occurred to me that anything
should be different.
"If you never see a black person in a role
other than servile, you can't imagine any
thing being different. I had black servants.
They seemed to be happy. Why should one
question?"
Finally, thanks to the Methodist Church,
he did question.
"I puzzled over what I saw as an incon
gruity between race relations and what I

heard preached in the chuches," he said.
Encouraged by a minister in his boarding
school, he turned toward a life in the clergy
and at age 19 left his country to attend
Cambridge University. Later, he attended
theological school in Chicago and New York
City.
"As my studies progressed, I became
less and less convinced South Africa was
the place to be," he said.
He found just one way to deal with the
hypocrisy of white supremacy in a Christian
society — he never went back.
He has been at Stanford since 1973, and
today the South African transplant appears
comfortable.
In a climate that mirrors South Africa's,
he walks five minutes to school every day.
He has three children, two of them Stan
ford students.
For lack of rugby, he has adopted profes
sional football as his favorite spectator

sport. He said he is a 49er fan.
Hamerton-Kelly has made the adjust
ment. He's American.
But in an environment where .South
Africa is the hot issue, he can't forgfct. He
believes his employer should adopt a policy
of "selective divestment," selling its\stock
in companies that embrace racist polices.
Many students would support that j>osi
tion. Though "delighted they're alive fb the
issue," he questions the priorities of stu
dents who have joined campus protests.
"There are other issues like Central
America that should be addressed," he
said. "Why so gentle on the United States
and so hard on South Africa when the
United States is acting like a state
vis-a-vis Nicaragua?" he asked while sitting
in his office that offers a partial view of the
Quad, a popular protest site.
Students who direct protests against a
distant society "vent their moral indignation
at the lowest possible personal cost,"he
said.
Student protest, university divestment,
economic sanctions, even concessions from
South Africa President Pieter Botha — in
Hamerton-Kelly's eyes, nothing will make a
difference.
South Africa's future? At first, he only
can tilt back his full head of silver hair and
sigh.
He said his ideal is the emergence of a
"multi-racial society in which all races par
ticipate in government and elect leaders
based on merit alone."
This is a "fantasy," he said, one not even
realized in the United States.
For South Africa, it's too late, Hamerton-
Kelly said. Apartheid came at a high cost,
now it's time to pay up, he said.
"I can't remember a time when I was
ever hopeful," he said. "I have a feeling that
for the last 30 years, whites have not been
facing the real issue, but pursuing a fantasy.
If you want to live peacefully, you have to
share power honestly.
"The whites have power and wealth. No
one in their right mind would give that up,
at least not for moral reasons. I know that's
a cynical thing to say, but it's true. I think
things are moving toward some type of
war."
Hamerton-Kelly said he plans to travel to
South Africa in December, his third trip in
26 years.
He looks forward to visiting family, but
he knows he can never go home again.
"It's a very sad business for me," he
said.

Robert Hamerton-Kelly's South Africa is
a world free of racial strife.
There are no black rebels hurling stones
at riot police, only white students bowling
cricket balls at the wicket.
There are no blacks losing their lives in
anti-apartheid protests, only zealous rugby
players sacrificing their bodies in a push
toward the goal line.
The economy is robust. The living is
easy. The servants are black and, by all ap

Of course, this world no longer exists. It
