# CAMPUS COMPENDIUM
## 
### 
Quick, The Hotline
A meat company had a Thanks
giving hotline for housewives who
didn't know how to cook their
turkeys. Commissioner Gordon had
a hotline to call Batman and Robin.
Even President Reagan has a
hotline to get old Mikhail on the
horn and give him a holler.
UC-Santa Barbara didn't want to
be left out.
The UCSB Environmental
Health and Safety Department set
up an odor hotline that students can
use to report nasty smells on the
beach-side campus. It seems that
strong, sulfurous-smelling odors
occasionally drift across campus,
forcing classes to be canceled as
students and professors run for air
tight cover.
By setting up the hotline, Envi
ronmental Health and Safety folks
hope to track down the source of
the smells. Possibilities include the
Atlantic Richfield offshore drilling
platform near Coal Oil Point and
Exxon's gas-desulfurization plant at
nearby Las Flores.
By Nov. 25, the hotline had
received 14 bad-smell reports.
Many of the reports came at one
time, leading administrators to
believe that there might have been
a sudden release of sulfurous gas
from some plant that deals with pe
troleum.
A more definitive answer may
come later, as the number of
repoirts become statistically signifi
cant. !
Harvard 1
In two separate incidents at Har
vard a few weekends ago, students
had to be hospitalized after drinking
games.
After a three-hour drinking con
test at Hurlbut Hall, an intoxicated
freshman became so "out of his
skull" that he fell and split open his
head. "We found him on the first
floor landing with an inch-and-a-half
laceration on his forehead," a police
spokesman told The Harvard Crim
son. After the student was treated
at a nearby hospital, he allegedly
struck a nurse and had to be
restrained by police.
Later, an Adams House student
bet friends that he could down 15
shots of whiskey in 15 minutes. He
did. Then he drank a six-pack of
beer. Then he went to the hospital,

where he "awoke in a wild state and
had to be restrained."
Harvard 2
Harvard freshman Carl Rosin
carved a Halloween pumpkin in his
Wigglesworth House bathroom and
washed the carving tools in the
sink. A few days later, freshman
John Bible, Rosin's roommate, "had
a feeling something was watching
one of Rosin's roommates, John

Bible, was brushing his teeth when
it happened.
"I had this feeling that something
was watching me," he said. "I went
to spit, and there it was."
After Bible got over the shock,
he realized what had happened. A
pumpkin seed had lodged itself in
the drain and then sprouted. The
little pumpkin plant was peeking
through.
The roommates named the plant
"Richard," but Harvard Biology
Prof. Carroll Wood told The Har
vard Crimson that "Old Dick" may
not be long in this world.
Richard probably is surviving on
the food stored in the pumpkin
seed, which won't last much longer,
and his fertilizer — toothpaste and
spit — probably won't help much
either.
Harvard 3
The Lampoon is threatening to
sue the Lampoon.

It seems the Harvard Lampoon,
a semi-secret social club that
publishes parodies — is angry that
the Kennedy School of Government
Lampoon — a newly formed group
that has published a parody of the
Kennedy's School's official program
— has taken its name.
"The name 'Lampoon' is a prop
erty a lot of people have worked
very hard to build up," said the Har
vard Lampoon's lawyer.

But Kennedy School lampooners
say they are "nothing more than a
group of graduate students with a
vision and a serious debt."
The Kennedy School group says
that it may try to strike a deal with
the Harvard Lampoon, just as Na
tional Lampoon did some years
back.
"The National Lampoon gets to
use the name by paying the Har
vard Lampoon 2 percent of their
profit," said one Kennedy com
edian. "We'd be willing to let them
pick up 2 percent of our debt any
time they wanted."
But the Harvard Lampoon folks,
or " 'Poonies," as The Harvard
Crimson calls them, say no dice.
"Our fancy-pants lawyer from
New York will sue them for lunch
money," one 'Poonie explained.
Harvard 4
Harvard students who run an
advising program that matches up

perclassmen with groups of fresh
men are defending their program
despite recent revelations that two
advisers became romantically in
volved with their freshman
charges.
One of the advisers resigned
from the program, and another was
transferred to a different group of
students when it was learned that
the two had had affairs with the
freshmen they were supposed to be
advising.
Tough at Texas
The University of Texas is get
ting tough on hazing.
"Forgive me," Texas President
William Cunningham told a meeting
of campus leaders last month, "I
just don't understand the concept of
hazing. It's just foreign to me. That
in the name of brotherhood, sister
hood and friendship to beat up on
someone is just hard for me to un
derstand."
Cunningham has sent a letter to
all campus groups that participate in
initiation activities. The letter is ac
companied by an anti-hazing vow,
which all groups must either sign or
they will face disciplinary action.
The letter says that no hazing will
be tolerated
There will be no additional warn
ings, officials said. The first individ
uals found guilty of hazing will be
expelled. "This is the warning.
Consider yourselves all on proba
tion. The next complaint will be a
violation," one administrator said.
Although two of Texas' most
notorious groups, the Texas
Wranglers and the Silver Spurs,
said they will sign the no-hazing
pledge, some fraternities said they
will refuse.
"I wouldn't sign that letter under
any circumstances," said the Alpha
Epsilon Phi president, adding that
his fraternity does not haze its
pledges.
The director of Texas' Inter
fraternity Council said he does not
think the measure is aimed at
Greek-letter fraternities.
"Certainly there are groups
outside of IFC who participate in
hazing. IFC groups are just the
most visible," he said.

pledge, some fraternities said they

"I wouldn't sign that letter under

Quick, The Hotline
A meat company had a Thanks
giving hotline for housewives who
didn't know how to cook their
turkeys. Commissioner Gordon had
a hotline to call Batman and Robin.
Even President Reagan has a
hotline to get old Mikhail on the
horn and give him a holler.
UC-Santa Barbara didn't want to
be left out.
The UCSB Environmental
Health and Safety Department set
up an odor hotline that students can
use to report nasty smells on the
beach-side campus. It seems that
strong, sulfurous-smelling odors
occasionally drift across campus,
forcing classes to be canceled as
students and professors run for air
tight cover.
By setting up the hotline, Envi
ronmental Health and Safety folks
hope to track down the source of
the smells. Possibilities include the
Atlantic Richfield offshore drilling
platform near Coal Oil Point and
Exxon's gas-desulfurization plant at
nearby Las Flores.
By Nov. 25, the hotline had
received 14 bad-smell reports.
Many of the reports came at one
time, leading administrators to
believe that there might have been
a sudden release of sulfurous gas
from some plant that deals with pe
troleum.
A more definitive answer may
come later, as the number of
repoirts become statistically signifi
cant. !
Harvard 1
In two separate incidents at Har
vard a few weekends ago, students
had to be hospitalized after drinking
games.
After a three-hour drinking con
test at Hurlbut Hall, an intoxicated
freshman became so "out of his
skull" that he fell and split open his
head. "We found him on the first
floor landing with an inch-and-a-half
laceration on his forehead," a police
spokesman told The Harvard Crim
son. After the student was treated
at a nearby hospital, he allegedly
struck a nurse and had to be
restrained by police.
Later, an Adams House student
bet friends that he could down 15
shots of whiskey in 15 minutes. He
did. Then he drank a six-pack of
beer. Then he went to the hospital,

where he "awoke in a wild state and
had to be restrained."
Harvard 2
Harvard freshman Carl Rosin
carved a Halloween pumpkin in his
Wigglesworth House bathroom and
washed the carving tools in the
sink. A few days later, freshman
John Bible, Rosin's roommate, "had
a feeling something was watching
one of Rosin's roommates, John

Bible, was brushing his teeth when
it happened.
"I had this feeling that something
was watching me," he said. "I went
to spit, and there it was."
After Bible got over the shock,
he realized what had happened. A
pumpkin seed had lodged itself in
the drain and then sprouted. The
little pumpkin plant was peeking
through.
The roommates named the plant
"Richard," but Harvard Biology
Prof. Carroll Wood told The Har
vard Crimson that "Old Dick" may
not be long in this world.
Richard probably is surviving on
the food stored in the pumpkin
seed, which won't last much longer,
and his fertilizer — toothpaste and
spit — probably won't help much
either.
Harvard 3
The Lampoon is threatening to
sue the Lampoon.

It seems the Harvard Lampoon,
a semi-secret social club that
publishes parodies — is angry that
the Kennedy School of Government
Lampoon — a newly formed group
that has published a parody of the
Kennedy's School's official program
— has taken its name.
"The name 'Lampoon' is a prop
erty a lot of people have worked
very hard to build up," said the Har
vard Lampoon's lawyer.

But Kennedy School lampooners
say they are "nothing more than a
group of graduate students with a
vision and a serious debt."
The Kennedy School group says
that it may try to strike a deal with
the Harvard Lampoon, just as Na
tional Lampoon did some years
back.
"The National Lampoon gets to
use the name by paying the Har
vard Lampoon 2 percent of their
profit," said one Kennedy com
edian. "We'd be willing to let them
pick up 2 percent of our debt any
time they wanted."
But the Harvard Lampoon folks,
or " 'Poonies," as The Harvard
Crimson calls them, say no dice.
"Our fancy-pants lawyer from
New York will sue them for lunch
money," one 'Poonie explained.

Harvard students who run an
advising program that matches up

perclassmen with groups of fresh
men are defending their program
despite recent revelations that two
advisers became romantically in
volved with their freshman
charges.
One of the advisers resigned
from the program, and another was
transferred to a different group of
students when it was learned that
the two had had affairs with the
freshmen they were supposed to be
advising.
Tough at Texas
The University of Texas is get
ting tough on hazing.
"Forgive me," Texas President
William Cunningham told a meeting
of campus leaders last month, "I
just don't understand the concept of
hazing. It's just foreign to me. That
in the name of brotherhood, sister
hood and friendship to beat up on
someone is just hard for me to un
derstand."
Cunningham has sent a letter to
all campus groups that participate in
initiation activities. The letter is ac
companied by an anti-hazing vow,
which all groups must either sign or
they will face disciplinary action.
The letter says that no hazing will
be tolerated
There will be no additional warn
ings, officials said. The first individ
uals found guilty of hazing will be
expelled. "This is the warning.
Consider yourselves all on proba
tion. The next complaint will be a
violation," one administrator said.
Although two of Texas' most
notorious groups, the Texas
Wranglers and the Silver Spurs,
said they will sign the no-hazing
pledge, some fraternities said they
will refuse.
"I wouldn't sign that letter under
any circumstances," said the Alpha
