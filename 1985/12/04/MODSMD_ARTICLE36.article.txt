# Daily Cal Cries Snob on Stanford
## 
### MICHAEL SILVER 
In the interest of equal time for
opposing viewpoints, The Daily
brings you this column from the
Daily Californian, the student
newspaper across the Bay. The
column, called "In the Crowd,"
originally appeared in the Nov. 26
issue of the Daily Cal, three days
after Stanford won Big Game,
24-20.

On Saturday morning, I had
the illustrious honor of playing in
the Ink Bowl. Three hours later,
huddling in my seat across
campus at Stanford Stadium, I
was witnessing the Stink Bowl.
There had been better days.
In the morning, myself and six
other Daily Cal reporters and
our pickup-style operation
headed to Roble Field to take on
The Stanford Daily — complete
with offensive and defensive
units, a playbook and a polished
look that was distinctively red.
Well, the rag-tag Daily Cal
team lost to the Daily, as we had
the two previous years. This
time, the score was 12-0, al
though we did get in some good
licks on Stanford Daily
sportswriter Jason "The
Refrigerator" Cole.
But at Stanford Stadium, early
in the second half of the spec
tacle that makes all this hoopla
possible, I hit the lowest of the
low. The Cardinal, with the help
of four Cal turnovers, was em
barrassing the Bad News Bears,
24-0.
It didn't figure to get much
worse, but whoever said the Big
Game was predictable? The en
suing course of e vents was em
barrassing, but I'll try to recount
them as objectively as possible.
A group of students stood up
and tried to rally the battered
Bears. One obviously intox
icated fan, no toothpick himself,
screamed at them to sit down. I
told him he should support the
cause, and before I knew it, he
and his 250-plus pounds were
upon me, ranting and raving.
"Twenty four nothing! You're
gonna support that?\"

It wasn't this fat fan that I was
mad at (ridiculous as he may
have been), it was the whole
damn scene.
Let me clarify. Most of the
people I have met at Stanford
are good people who just happen
to go to the wrong school. My
best friend plays tennis there,
and I think the rivalry is a healthy
one. But there is an attitude I've
sometimes noticed there that
brings out the worst in me.
Some call it snobbishness,
others call it arrogance. But I
think it was best captured by a
quote found in Friday's edition of
The Stanford Daily itself.
The article was on a
preseason women's swim meet.
Second-ranked Stanford had
defeated No. 7 Cal. In the third
paragraph, Cardinal senior
Kathy Smith submitted a quote.
"We solidly put them in their
place."
This was the attitude dis
played by The Stanford Daily in
the Ink Bowl. They clapped at
missed passes; they laughed at
dropped catches; and they
whined at insignificant rule viola
tions. They even tried to run up
the score — by throwing to The
Fridge, no less — but we did
shut the door on that drive, v
After the initial celebration,
Stanford fans were melancholy
and withdrawn. Cal fans would
have been jubilant, dancing all
over the Farm, but the Cardinal
showed no more excitement
than a Soviet chess champion.
Perhaps it was that old Stan
ford attitude again, I thought.
Maybe the red-clad fans really
believed their team had solidy
put Cal in its place.
That could have been part of
it, but I think Stanford realized
something else, too. When all is
said and done, it's all part of the
Big Game. These two schools
are old friends. So, Stanford gets
to keep the Axe another year.
The Cardinal now holds a 36-
point edge in the 88-game
rivalry. And The Stanford Daily
has won three in a row.
Big Deal.
