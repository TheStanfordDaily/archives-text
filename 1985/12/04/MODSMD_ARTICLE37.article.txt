Aquino Widow Intends To Run
MANILA, Philippines — Corazon Aquino, the widow of slain oppo
sition leader Benigno Aquino Jr., declared her candidacy for presi
dent yesterday, challenging Ferdinand Marcos, the man she blames
for her husband's assassination. Her announcement came as the
United States criticized the verdict acquitting 26 men of killing
Aquino and covering up the crime.
Answering reporters' questions, Aquino said that if elected, she
will end suspension of habeas corpus "to release political prisoners"
and work on a new democratic constitution. She also said she will ask
communist insurgents to "come back to the field of law" and ask
them to "pledge allegiance to the new government."
The 52-year-old widow announced her decision to run a day after
Marcos signed a bill calling for a Feb. 7 "snap" election. It was also a
day after a trial court acquitted armed forces Chief of Staff Fabian
Ver and 25 other men of all charges in the August 1983 slaying of
Aquino and Rolando Galman at Manila International Airport. Aquino
said Monday, "I hold Marcos responsible for the assassination."
In Washington, Charles Redman, deputy State Department
spokesman, said it was "very difficult" to reconcile the trial's
outcome with conclusions by a fact-finding commission last year that
the military was responsible for the killing and cover-up. He said the
commission's work was "exemplary and thorough."
He was implicitly critical of Marcos' decision to reinstate Ver,
saying that "thoroughgoing military reform" is required to deal effec
tively with the Marxist insurgency.
Winnie Mandela Defies Ban
MAMELODI, South Africa — Black nationalist leader Winnie Man
dela yesterday defied the South African government orders banning
her from all political activities to tell mourners at a funeral for 12 per
sons killed in an anti-government protest, "The blood of our heroes
will be avenged."
"The day is not far when we shall lead you to freedom," declared
Mandela, the wife of imprisoned African National Congress president
Nelson Mandela and an increasingly important black leader in her
own right. Her remarks came amid chants of "Amandla ngawetu —
Power to the people" with the black, green and gold flag of the
outlawed African National Congress held high in the crowd.
"We are here today as testimony to the failure of this government
to rule our country and to the fact that the solution to this country's
problems lies in these black hands," she said. "This is our country."
Her appearance at the funeral, the first time she has addressed
such a public rally in 25 years because of government restrictions on
her, not only showed a greater political daring on her part but also a
growing determination by blacks to confront the government.
Speakers at the day-long funeral, attended by about 30,000,
denounced the government and the police action two weeks ago in
which the 12 people buried yesterday and three others had died.
They also called for greater organization and concerted actions, such
as consumer boycotts and general strikes, to overturn the country's
apartheid system of racial separation and white minority rule.
Bonners Allege KGB Deception
ROME — Relatives of Soviet dissident Yelena Bonner disclosed
yesterday that the KGB forged cables and released misleading
videotapes to prevent the world from learning that Bonner had suf
fered a heart attack and her husband, Nobel laureate Andrei Sak
harov, had had a debilitating stroke brought on by forced feeding.
Bonner, 62, arrived in Rome Monday, breaking 19 months of in
ternal exile in the closed Soviet city of Gorky, after she received
permission to visit the West for treatment of eye and heart prob
lems. She refused to talk with reporters, citing an agreement with
Soviet authorities to avoid contact with the press as a condition of
her return to Gorky, where Sakharov remains in internal exile.
But Bonner's son, Alexei Semyonov, and a son-in-law, Yefrem
Yankelevich, called a press conference at which they reviewed what
they knew of their parents' treatment in Gorky and added details
they said came from "clarifications" by their mother after she arrived
here. Both Semyonov and Yankelevich live in Newton, Mass.
While Sakharov, 64, conducted an almost nonstop hunger strike
over the past six months to force the authorities to let his wife go to
the West for medical treatment, the KGB forged cables in Bonner's
name to deceive friends and others into believing that the two were
living together and that both were in good health, they said.
"My mother tried to contact friends by sending cables," Semyonov
said, adding that these cables were facsimile transmissions of what
purportedly was her handwriting. "Each of them was forged in such a
way as to create the impression that everything was normal."
Official Says U.S. Aided Assault
CAIRO, Egypt — American jet fighters based on the USS Coral
Sea escorted the transport plane carrying Egyptian commandos en
route to and from Malta for the assault on a hijacked Egypt Air flight
that ultimately cost 57 lives, according to a Western diplomat here.
Three senior American military officers who accompanied the
Egyptian commandos on the transport plane were meant to com
municate with the U.S. Navy jets if necessary, and in case the
Libyan Air Force attempted any sort of interception, this source
said.
Diplomats here said the presence of the three Americans also had
an important symbolic role for the Egyptians in the operation, for
which Cairo sought more extensive and direct U.S. participation than
previously had been reported.
The cited Western diplomat said that when the hijacking began,
Egypt "invited" assistance from the United States and other
countries with highly trained anti-terrorist units, inquiring specifically
into the whereabouts of the U.S. Delta Force.
Strike, Protests Paralyze Bhopal
BHOPAL, India — A general strike paralyzed this central Indian
city yesterday and thousands of angry protesters filled the streets on
the second day of demonstrations marking the first anniversary of
the Union Carbide gas leak that killed more than 2,000 people.
Hundreds of effigies of the American chemical company's chair
man were set ablaze last night.
Marches and rallies were conducted in at least five other Indian
cities, including New Delhi and Calcutta, commemorating the leak of
methyl isocyanate gas that killed more than 2,000 people in Bhopa!
— most of them slum dwellers — and injured 300,000 others.
About 4,000 demonstrators swarmed outside the Union Carbide
pesticide plant in Bhopal, demanding that the plant be permanently
closed before another disaster occurs. More than 1,000 riot police
guarded the plant.
