# Sources cite conflict with Regan
## McFarlane Quits Security Post 
### 
WASHINGTON — Robert
McFarlane, apparently weary of
friction with President Reagan's top
policy advisers, has resigned as the
president's assistant for national se
curity affairs, Administration
sources said yesterday.
McFarlane, a key figure in Ad
ministration foreign policy for the
last four years, has had strained re
lations with White House Chief of
Staff Donald Regan and also
reportedly is tired of refereeing
foreign policy disputes between
Secretary of State George Shultz
and Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger.
The president, White House
spokesmen and McFarlane himself
refused to comment on the resigna
tion. But a longtime Reagan adviser
said that McFarlane definitely is
leaving his post and indicated that
an announcement is imminent.

When asked about published
speculation that McFarlane would
resign, White House spokesman
Larry Speakes responded: "I don't
have anything on Bud. ... I can't
confirm or deny."
The Administration may be
delaying any announcement in
hopes of being able to name a suc
cessor at the same time the resig
nation is announced, some officials
said.
"I don't think they want to get
caught in a cross-fire between
Shultz and the conservatives," said
a former Reagan aide with close
White House contacts. "They'd like
to get it resolved before saying
Bud's leaving."
Names of possible successors
circulating in Washington include
McFarlane's deputy, John Poindex
ter; former Undersecretary of
State Lawrence Eagleburger;

Brent Scowcroft, who served as
President Gerald Ford's national
security adviser; David Abshire,
U.S. ambassador to NATO; and

former U.N. Ambassador Jeanne
Kirkpatrick.
Some sources suggested that
Abshire would be a likely compro
mise choice because he has conser
vative credentials and probably
would be acceptable to Shultz, who
undoubtedly would oppose any
move to name Kirkpatrick, a favor
ite of Reagan's more conservative
followers.
McFarlane has been a key figure
in Reagan's foreign policy apparatus
for almost four years, first as the
president's deputy assistant, and
since 1983 as the assistant for na
tional security affairs.
Although he played a major role
at last month's Geneva summit be
tween Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, he reportedly
was irritated by the prominent role
played by Regan, who has little
background in foreign policy.
