# Indicted NASA chief steps down
## Navy Bars General Dynamics Contracts 
### 
WASHINGTON — One day after three exec
utives and a former top official of General
Dynamics Corp. were indicted for alleged con
tract fraud, the Navy barred the giant defense
supplier yesterday from obtaining new contracts
from the entire federal government.
A Reagan Administration official said the
former General Dynamics executive — James
Beggs, now head of the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration — had decided to take
a leave of absence as director of the nation's
space program. NASA initially said he would not
leave his post, but the White House pressured
him to step aside at least temporarily.
Under the Navy's decision, General Dynamics
will not be allowed to sign new contracts or
renew or extend existing ones with any federal
agency until the indictment is disposed of. A
Navy spokesman said the suspension could last

only a short time if the indictment ends in a
prompt dismissal or plea-bargaining arrangement
— or for several years if a trial is followed by ap
peals.
Peter Connolly, a spokesman at the General
Dynamics headquarters in St. Louis, read a com
pany statement that said: "We believe the
Navy's action against the company is inappropri
ate since the issues in the case should not have
resulted in indictment against the company or its
people.
"The company's actions challenged in the in
dictment involve highly sophisticated regulatory
and accounting matters. Any differing interpreta
tion of these matters should have been resolved
in a civil forum such as the Armed Services
Board of Contract Appeals. Had this been done,
we doubt that the government's position should
have prevailed."

He refused to respond to questions.
A Navy spokesman said the suspension could
delay production of some Los Angeles-class nu
clear submarines, one of the major weapon sys
tems produced by General Dynamics.
But the official, speaking on condition that he
not be named, made it clear that the Navy would
delay final decisions on the contracts until the
company was back in the running rather than au
tomatically awarding them to the nation's only
other major submarine builder, Newport News
Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co.
The seven-count indictment, issued by a
federal grand jury in Los Angeles Monday,
charged that Beggs took part in the alleged con
spiracy while he was an executive vice president
of the company before joining the administration
in 1981.
