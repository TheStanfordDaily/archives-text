# 26 Misconduct Charges Filed During '84-'B5
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
The Judicial Affairs Office filed 26 charges
of misconduct against 24 students in the
1984-85 school year, according to a report
released Monday. The report also includes
the previously unreleased penalty of David
Keane for assault while intoxicated.
Keane, now a junior, admitted to multiple
acts of physical assault while in a state of ex
treme intoxication. Keane was suspended for
three quarters with -the possibility of petition
ing for reinstatement after one quarter — on

the condition that he seek alcohol abuse coun
seling. In addition, he must abstain from alco
hol while at Stanford once reinstated and
complete a 50-hour work fine in each of the
two quarters following his return to campus.
Keane currently resides on campus.
Two female students initially accused
Keane of assaulting them ori Nov. 8 of last
year during a party at the Beta Theta Pi fra
ternity house.
Although six more charges were filed last
year than in the previous year, Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole said the increase was slight
and not significant.
"These statistics and examples are compa

rable to those seen in recent years," said the
report issued by Cole.
Of the 24 students charged, 20 were un
dergraduate students and four were graduate
students. Eighteen men and six women were
implicated in the cases. University policy
keeps students involved in judicial proceed
ings anonymous in all but special cases, and a
student's disciplinary record is not released
unless a student requests it. Cole said law
schools often demand that a student release
his disciplinary record. This report, in accor
dance with University policy, included no
names.
The 1984-85 misconduct charges, four of

which were later dropped, do not include the
cheating case in a Psychology 1 class this
spring because two of the decisions in that
case are still pending, Cole said.
Cole added that she will complete a report
on that case next quarter. It will include
commments and suggestions by the faculty
and students involved, she said.
Eight of the misconduct charges mentioned
in Monday's 1984-85 report were Fundamen
tal Standard violations. The Fundamental
Standard, first introduced to the University in
1906, is a "very broad statement of expected
conduct," Cole said. It stipulates,
for instance, that students must
maintain order and behave in a
morally acceptable fashion, she
said.
Fourteen of the 18 Honor Code
violations were plagiarism —
making it the most common charge
of misconduct. The rest of the
Honor Code cases involved unper
mitted collaboration and receiving
unpermitted aid, the report said.
Besides the Keane case, the
Fundamental Standard Cases were:
Two students were charged by
the University with violating the
terms of the Microdisc Purchase
Plan. Student A bought computer
equipment through the discount

plan with the intention of selling it
to Student B, who had already pur
chased a system through the plan
and was ineligible to purchase an
other one so soon. The students
were fined and put on probation for
the remainder of their Stanford
careers.
Junior Joseph Anderson was
charged by the University with
damaging a bicycle when he drove
his car into a pack of bicycles
parked on the sidewalk. The Uni
versity concluded he drove his car
while drunk, damaged the property
of a fellow student and posed a risk
to himself and his passengers. He
was suspended for one quarter on
the condition that he neither drive
nor store a motor vehicle on
campus for one quarter. In addition,
he was given a choice between a
work fine and a monetary fine.
