House Cuts Imports
WASHINGTON — The House gave final
congressional approval yesterday to a bill to
slash textile, shoe and copper imports, but the
margin indicated that Congress will be unable
to override an all-but-certain veto from Presi
dent Reagan.
The final 255-161 vote in favor of the bill fell
23 votes short of the two-thirds majority that
would be necessary to pass the bill over the
veto that Clayton Yeutter, President Reagan's
special trade representative, warned was im
minent.
The bill would reduce textile and apparel im
ports from Brazil and Taiwan by 30 percent
next year and from Hong Kong by 14 percent.
Textile and apparel imports from nine other
countries would be frozen at this year's levels.
The bill would also impose quotas on imported
shoes and copper.
Jackson Looks to '88
WASHINGTON — In the first indication
that he will run for president in 1988, Jesse
Jackson says that he is contemplating the
formation of a political action committee to
carry out the "progressive thrust of the Rain
bow Coalition."
The committee's immediate function would
be to assist local candidates in next year's
House and Senate races, particularly in the
South, Jackson said in an interview. Aides con

firmed the plan yesterday. But Jackson made
clear that the committee also could provide a
foundation for his own candidacy.
Still smarting at the Democratic Party's
refusal to change its delegate selection rules in
1984, Jackson said that if he seeks the 1988
Democratic nomination, "either the party will
be fair or we will open up the process" by
forming a third party.
U.S. Cuts Arms Aid
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administra
tion, in order to avoid virtually certain defeat
today of its $54 million military and police aid
proposal for Central America, has agreed to
cut the request in half by eliminating all military
aid, according to Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.),
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
In a letter to committee members made
public yesterday, Lugar said he would offer a
compromise at the committee markup session
today that would authorize $24 million to help
police in El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica
and Guatemala deal with terrorist threats. It
also would authorize $1 million for a witness
protection fund.
The proposal would ban Central Intelligence
Agency funding and handling of aid in the pro
gram, but would lift restrictions on
"intelligence sharing and the provision of
intelligence-related equipment," according to
Lugar's description. It would restrict "lethal"

arms aid to 10 percent of the funding, and all
aid would stop if any were used for torture.
Tax Reform Advances
WASHINGTON — The House Ways and
Means Committee gave its official blessing
yesterday to its version of sweeping tax over
haul legislation, after President Reagan indi
cated that he would not oppose the package
but delayed a decision on whether to provide a
crucial endorsement.
"I think he wants to keep the process alive.
That's the message I received, which would
indicate he's not going to reject the House
Ways and Means package," the option with ap
parently the best chance of passing the
Democratic-controlled House, Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said after an hour
long meeting between Reagan and congres
sional GOP leaders.
At the session, House Republicans tried to
persuade Reagan — whom Democrats hope
will be their plan's most powerful ally — to en
dorse a GOP alternative that Republicans con
tend is closer to Reagan's own.
Stocks Rise Slightly
NEW YORK — Stock prices arrested their
slide yesterday, fluctuating within a narrow
range before rising slightly in the final hour.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
