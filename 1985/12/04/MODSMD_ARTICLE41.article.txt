LA Regulates Baths
LOS ANGELES — Strict bathhouse regula
tions that officials say will reduce the incidence
of AIDS were adopted yesterday by the Los
Angeles County Board of Supervisors.
The regulations, effective immediately, re
quire owners of gay bathhouses to police their
establishments and kick out anyone engaging
in high-risk sexual activity. County officials
warn that they will move to shut down any
bathhouse found to be in violation of the new
requirements.
Specifically, the new standards require bath
house owners to:
• Provide employees to observe activity
within the bathhouses at a ratio of one monitor
for every 20 patrons.

• Expel all patrons observed to be engaged in
high-risk sexual activities.
• Maintain a daily log of expulsions that would
be available to health inspectors on demand.
• Prominently display warnings of high-risk
sexual activities.
Sea Search Suspended
SAN FRANCISCO — After saving 10 other
men, the Coast Guard suspended its search
yesterday for a crew member of a classic yacht
that ran into savage seas during the last leg of
a trip to Northern California.
A helicopter search for James Vivian of San
Rafael was suspended because of dense fog,

said Coast Guard Petty Officer Kathleen Pot
ter.
Paul Stevenson, 41, of Sausalito, said the
crews on the Girlfriend 111 and trawler Wynn D
11, accompanying it on its journey from South
ern California, encountered weather much
milder than forecast until they neared the
Golden Gate Bridge Monday evening.
"We saw the damned lights, but we just
couldn't make any headway," said Stevenson.
"So we decided to head back out to sea."
"We got the hell knocked out of us," said
Stevenson. "I'd say we were airborne maybe
10 times for several seconds."
The Coast Guard Cutter Morgenthau
rescued the yacht survivors as they clung to a
life raft at 4:20 a.m. yesterday about four miles
southwest of the Golden Gate.
