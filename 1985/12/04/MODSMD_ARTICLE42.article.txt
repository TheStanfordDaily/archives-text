## 'Rocky IV' Offers Blood, Guts and Stallone 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
We've been seeing the ads for nearly half a year.
(Camera sweeps across the ground.) "My name is Ivan
Drago. I am fighter from the Soviet Union. (Camera
sweeps up a seemingly endless expanse of physique.) I
fight all my life and I never lose. Soon I fight Rocky Bal
boa, and the world will see his (dramatic pause) deee
feat." The audience hoots as the "Rocky" theme
pounds us back into the seats, and the announcer
grimly intones, "Get ready for the next world war."
Judging from "Rocky IV," Sylvester Stallone's
penchant for psycho-patriotic narcissism wasn't ex
hausted with last summer's "Rambo." This latest, and
probably final, "Rocky" remake begins with the fight at
the end of number three, and gets wilder and crazier in
every way; it's calculated to jangle the nervous system
of a slug, and it trashes every human emotional
response.
"Rocky IV" is like a nightmare funhouse, without the
fun. By now Stallone probably recognizes the hollow
ness and repetitiveness of most of what he's doing; he
speeds by, in six or seven montages set to rock music,
all of the material we've seen before, and he even in
cludes shots from past "Rocky" movies. We get at
least two training videos; we get rock video soul
searching; we get two endless rock video fights.
Stallone must have MTV going in his head 24 hours a
day. But all of this doesn't mean there's no room for
ideas.
You can tell when the film is about to deliver one of
Stallone's ideas, because the music stops and Stallone
gets solemn and directs as if he'd just discovered the
close-up. The early scenes have conversations among
the principles — Rocky's wife Adrian (Talia Shire), his
trainer Paulie (Burt Young) and former opponent
Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) — and Stallone cuts
from face to face and embalms each expression. This is
his own personal collection of icons, and they do noth
ing in "Rocky IV" that they haven't done in every
"Rocky" movie.
In the original "Rocky," Stallone (who wrote that
one too) showed some interest in human beings. Now,
nine years later, he's running the whole show, and he's

fixated on demi-god warriors and longer, more violent
fight scenes.
I wish I could say that Stallone screwed up, and that
the incessantly jumping camera, pounding fists and ex
ploding faces nauseated everyone else as much as they
did me. But it seemed as if the members of the audi
ence got as hopped up at "Rocky IV" as they did at
"Rambo" — maybe more so, because the fights in
"Rocky IV' are so much more personal. The sweat and
blood fly from the faces and bodies of the fighters in

stylized waves, and each blow sounds like a cannon
going off in an echo chamber.
This time around Rocky goes up against a Herculean
master race Russian named Ivan Drago (played by
Dolph Lundgren, a former kick-boxer with a nasty lip
curl) and he towers over Rocky, who has to reach up to
land a punch. Every time Drago appears before a fight
the soundtrack hisses and rumbles, as if a chorus of
dragons were seething behind the screen.
Since Drago is a blond-haired super-Slav and is al

ways surrounded by his sneering Soviet trainers,
there's racial and ethnic nastiness going on in his pre
fight press conferences with Rocky and Apollo. And
Drago is also a Frankenstein's monster of sports sci
ence (just so we get the message that Rocky is the un
derdog here). But he's our underdog, and we know
that it's going to be a clash of the titans when they face
off in the ring. They're both gigantic combatants, and
the pathetic human officials scurry around them like
ants.
Stallone's stint as Rambo has introduced him to poli
tical iconography, and it is in its politics that "Rocky
IV" wanders more than a little off course. Apollo Creed
agrees to fight Drago in Las Vegas, and Apollo turns
their match into a star-spangled, show-biz floor show.
The scene is set with Apollo dressed up as a funky,
dancing Uncle Sam and James Bown singing "Living in
America." But in the actual fight, Apollo is brutally
killed by Drago, and Stallone (the filmmaker) suddenly
seems to be indicting the craziness of a sport in which
two guys smash each other in the head — a sport in
which bloodlust is the driving force in the opponents.
This idea, of course, is not followed through (there
would be no movie if it were). Instead, to prepare for
his fight, Rocky is off to Siberia to live like a peasant
and absorb the moral and physical strength of the op
pressed Russian people. It is only in this way that he
can defeat the state-tooled murder machine. Stallone
loses control of his symbolism in these scenes, but it's
all he has; no real athlete in his right mind would train
for a fight by running through the snow and chopping
wood in freezing weather. You can bet Stallone didn't
do this to get into shape for his movie.
Is Stallone saying that the United States should
abandon its technology and live like Russian peasant
farmers if it wants to beat the commies? It doesn't
seem like such a great idea, especially when we see
Rocky taking more blows to the head in the big fight
than any boxer has taken in his entire career.
This is the travesty the film has been building up to,
and Stallone lets Rocky's martydom go on for rounds
and rounds before he finally strikes back. The audience
whoops it up during the is final bloodbath, but there's
something strange about cheering a guy who can't have
a brain left after this amount of punishment.


In "Rocky IV," Sylvester Stallone meets his toughest opponent yet, the Russian Ivan Drago
(Dolph Lundgren).
