# 'Dreamchild' Discovers Lewis Carroll's Real-Life Alice
## 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
At a time when we desperately need a
reaffirmation that movies are. really worth,
going to, ",j ,min<*
miracle. Writer Dennis Potter ana director
Gavin Millar have taken a quirky idea and
developed it with a magical understanding;
the movie is a fairy tale with an adult sen
sibility, and it's both beguiling and intelli
gent.
The story centers on Alice Hargreave's
(Coral Browne) trip to New York in 1932 to
help with the centenary celebration of the
birth of the Rev. Charles Dodgson (lan
Holm). Hargreave was the real-life Alice of
Lewis Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland"
books. (Carroll was Dodgson's pen name.)
Now approaching her 80s, Hargreave is
just coming to an understanding of her rela
tionship with Dodgson, and what he means
in her life. The old Hargreave finds
herself in the "wonderland" of New York,
working through Dodgson's tremendous
and fixating love for her as a little girl. She
remembers herself as the young Alice
(Amelia Shankley) at Christ Church in Ox
ford where Dodgson taught, and, in the
movie's most inspired moments, she im
agines herself with the fanciful creatures of
his stories. In Carroll's style, they obliquely
and satirically espouse life and love and un
derstanding, and help work out the elderly
Alice's peculiar and undefined sense of guilt

and confusion about her life.
What keeps "Dreamchild" from wallow
ing in the psychological muck of Alice's past
is the purity of her vision of that past, and
the film's conviction that a pure love is at
the core of her relationship with Dodgson.
At the end of her life the old AJjce is trying
to comprehend that love, trying to find her
self worthy of it, and she begins to under
stand it in a dreamy rehashing of her youth.
The movie is about the magical wisdom
of old age, which may smack of sugar
coated Stephen Spielberg, but it's also
about the insulated ignorance of youth,
which is refreshingly anti-Spielberg. The
young Alice is enchanting and precocious
and manipulative, and she doesn't question
or even begin to comprehend why Dodgson
dotes on her.
The shock for the old Alice is the world's
celebration of Dodgson's genius, and her
realization that, despite being so close to
him, she never understood him. Alice,
Dodgson and to a lesser degree all of the
characters in this film (including the Won
derland creatures), live in their own en
capsulated versions of reality, which don't
give them a very complete understanding of
one another or the world. In "Dreamchild,"
the craziness of New York shakes up Alice
Hargreave's view of herself.
Writer Potter specializes in ideas that
make a strange kind of sense, but seem
completely unworkable. Potter gets lucky
with director Millar, who puts us right
inside Alice's head in much of the movie and

presents a life that might truly be envi
sioned by a dreamchild. We only see Alice
at around age 10 and then again in her 80s,
when she is trying to recapture and expl
icate her childhood that is now hailed by the
American press she encounters.

The young Alice is
enchanting and preco
cious and manipulative,
and she doesn't ques
tion or even begin to
comprehend why
Dodgson dotes on her.

This structure leaves out so much of her
life that we might feel the filmmakers are
cheating by putting us so far inside Alice's
thought processes, but the movie has its
own dream logic. The old and young Alice
are so clearly connected that nothing seems
left out, and we can believe that nothing in
her life has happened to really shake her up
until now.

Millar's confidence with Potter's
definitely skewed narrative is astonishing,
and seems to grow in direct relation to the
difficulty of the scene he's presenting. A su
perfluous romance between Mrs.
Hargreave's ward (Nicola Cowper) and a
reporter (Peter Gallagher) is perfunctorily
tossed off, but the Alice/Dodgson and Won
derland creatuie scenes are beautifully
done.
Coral Browne (she does a very funny
Citibank credit card commercial with her
husband, Vincent Price) brings a wonder
fully sly authority to her role of Alice
Hargreave; she suggests a female John
Gielgud. She has the radiant confidence of a
great performer, though she's not one of
the big name actresses competing for this
year's Oscar. Here, Browne is made up to
appear much older and more frail than she
actually is, and her achievement is in
reflecting the emotional awakening of an
80-year-old woman intelligently, without
once going for the easy sympathy of a dying
grandmother figure.
At the end of "Dreamchild" Browne has
one of the greatest moments of any actor
this year, when she does nothing but read a
speech at a Columbia University celebra
tion in Dodgson's honor. She earns our
emotional response by Alice's final under
standing, in this scene, of his gift. Browne's
performance builds toward this moment.
Lan Holm has a terribly difficult role in
Dodgson, because he's playing Alice's view
of him, and he exists in her mind as a dear,

befuddled human toy. He yearns for this
self-centered Alice, and his witticisms and
yarn-spinning are for her; when she finds
him silly she laughs, or when he's boring
she trots off to play with her friends. Holm
suggests a very apprehensive wit (he only
practices it on little girls), and though his
role consists of little more than mooning
over Alice, Amelia Shankley helps make his
fixation believable. Her piquant intelligence
is straight from Dodgson's books, but her
self-centeredness grounds her in reality.
Both Dodgson's and the young Alice's epi
phany comes after she embarrasses him at a
lawn party, and, realizing that his foolish
love and humiliation are intertwined, she
crosses over to lie in his arms.
Potter and Millar misfire in the 1932
romance subplot; it may represent a lack of
confidence with the admittedly eccentric
material of their central story. Its conven
tionality seems out of place, and I would
rather have seen more of both the young
and old Alice. Jim Henson's marvelous
creatures could have used more exposure
too; they appear to be taken from original il
lustrations in the books, and are intricately
detailed and slightly malevolant. Best are
the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle, who sit
by a magical sea with shimmering curtains
of waves, and open and close the movie. At
the end, they too seem much wiser and a
little more mellow, and, when they share a
laugh with young Alice and Dodgson, the
Gryphon's wings fan out and shake mag
nificently.
