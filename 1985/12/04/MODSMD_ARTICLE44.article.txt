# Disney's Christmas Film Lacks Magic
## 
### DAVID WILLATS Staff writer 
The new Walt Disney film "One
Magic Christmas" takes elements
of the Christmas classics ("A
Christmas Carol," "Miracle on 34th
Street" and "It's a Wonderful Life")
and combines them to show just
how effective those early movies
were compared to anything made
today.
The film is entertaining only
when the heroine, a cute little girl
named Abbie (played by Elizabeth
Harnois), is on the screen. Cute
kids are Disney's trademark. But
cute kids are everyone's
trademark, so unfortunately Abbie
just isn't enough to save this film
from unbelievable monotony.
Here, in a nutshell, is the plot:
Abbie's mother, Ginnie Grainger
(played by Academy A ward-winner
Mary Steenburgen), doesn't believe
in Christmas, so lots of bad things
happen to her. Then she changes
her mind, and lots of good things
happen to her.
To fill up the plot, the filmmakers
added an angel named Gideon
(disappointingly portrayed by Harry
Dean Stanton), who performs lots
of miracles and sits up in a tree

playing the harmonica. Occasionally
he shows up in Abbie's bedroom,
which would leave most kids
screaming in terror. But for Abbie,
it is perfectly natural to have a
strange man in an overcoat sud
denly appear in her bedroom.

Because it is Christmas, we might have
been able to excuse all the rotten
dialogue, plot incongruities and lousy
music — if only there had been an
inspiring message, some sort of testa
ment to the human spirit.

Also, Abbie goes to visit Santa
Claus at the North Pole, Ginnie
loses her job, a bank is robbed,
people die and are resurrected,
poor neighbors don't have enough
money for food . . . the list goes on
and on. All of this occurs at about
the same emotional intensity as a
tax audit. The music is like a Hall-

mark card, sickeningly sweet and
never inspiring.
OK, there are a couple of good
things in the movie. Gary Basaraba,
as Ginnie's husband Jack, is endear
ing and believable. The kids are
cute and the North Pole sequence is

well done (this is probably the first
Santa's workshop scene where the
elves actually work fast enough to
make the millions of toys needed
for the world's population).
But the rest of the movie is ter
rible. Because it is Christmas, we
might have been able to excuse all
the rotten dialogue, plot incon

gruities and lousy music — if only
there had been an inspiring
message, some sort of testament
to the human spirit.
For instance, in Frank Capra's
"It's a Wonderful Life," Jimmy
Stewart realizes his own self-worth
when an angel shows him what life
would have been like without him.
In "A Christmas Carol," Scrooge's
good nature, dormant for many
years, re-emerges when he sees
the effects of his ways. Each of
these characters is fundamentally
good, his transformation a result
from prophetic visions that emanate
metaphorically from his own uncon
sciousness.
It's a different matter with Ginny
Grainger. Is she fundamentally
good? Maybe, but there is nothing
to indicate that she is any better
now than she used to be. Does her
transformation come from within
herself? Definitely not. She is
practically blackmailed by the angel
Gideon into believing in Christmas.
Who cares about a middle-aged cry
baby who is forced to enjoy
Christmas? I certainly didn't, and
neither did most of the children in
the audience.
Some final words on "One Magic
Christmas": Magic, no. Boring,
yes.


Elizabeth Harnois stars as six-year-old Abbie, woo tries to per
suade other people that Santa Claus (Jan Rubes) really exists
in Walt Disney's "One Magic Christmas."
