# SF Opera's 'Billy Budd' Pits Good Against Evil
## 
### ELAINE WANG 
In the Prologue of Benjamin Brit
ten's "Billy Budd," the captain la
ments the fact that what appears
perfect on the surface is always
flawed — that good and evil inter
twine to weave history. On a spe
cific level, this can be applied to the
San Francisco Opera's final offering
this season, "Billy Budd," adapted
by Britten from Herman Melville's
novella of the same title. The pro
duction has uninspired, dull parts,
as well as remarkably coherent and
magnificent ones.
Britten's work is layered and
complex musically, and the libretto
by E.M. Forster and Eric Crozier
lends added depths. The music is
full of erratic rhythms and inter
woven musical themes, often
composed of dissonant chords. It is
performed in English, a language in
which consonants prevail (and
vowels carry the tune).
As such, "Billy Budd" is difficult
to perform as well as listen to.
(Although the more you listen to
Britten, the more his music grows
on you — if you don't wholeheart
edly embrace his work, at least you
come to appreciate its subtlety and
variation.)
• Moreover, "Billy Budd" is un

relieved by the flamboyance and lilt
of a soprano, since there are no
women aboard the man-o'-war.
Considering these factors of the
work, the San Francisco Opera is
ambitious in presenting this produc
tion.
The opera begins in 1797, on an
English ship during the war against
France. Captain Vere heads the
H.M.S. Indomitable, which has just
impressed several sailors from the
merchant ship, The Rights of Man.
Among them Is Billy Budd (played
by Dale Duesing), a handsome,
young, simple and good recruit with
but one defect — he stammers
when stressed. The master-at
arms, Claggert, despises his beauty
and goodness, and swears to
destroy him.
Claggert wickedly frames Billy
and both come before the captain,
where the master-at-arms accuses
the sailor of conspiring to mutiny.
Billy's frank manner with Vere con
vinces him that the boy is innocent,
but Claggert's accusations enrage
Billy so much that he is unable to
speak his defense. In frustration,
Billy lunges at Claggert and kills
him. For this Billy must hang,
despite Vere's anguish at good suc
cumbing to evil.
The voices are solid in this pro
duction, but not distinctive, except

for James Morris as Claggert. Clag
gert, the master-at-arms respon
sible for keeping the men in line, is
a slimy creature of single-minded
malice. Each time he appears, the
music contains dark trombone
chords. Echoing this mood, Morris'
tone is threatening and ominously
slow (as if Billy's destruction were
inevitable and he could take his
time).
Duesing's Billy Budd is enthusi
astic and convincing, full of purity,
his only flaw the frustration arising
from his stammering.
The performance of Vere Games
King) is solid throughout the pro
duction, until the vital moment in
which he must condemn Billy to
death. The tension when Vere
refuses to save the young seaman
does not reach a point where we
can feel how torn the captain is
about ordering Billy's execution. In
answer to Billy's plea, "Save me,
my captain," King's manner is
merely implacable. There is no
hesitation, and King's gestures
seem empty — as when he bows
his head after the others leave the
room.
Given that the work is taxing
(albeit magnificent) for an audience,
the San Francisco Opera's sets
aren't always helpful. To create the

look of a foggy and eerie shipboard,
there is a thin, mottled sort of
screen that separates the artists
from the audience throughout the
entire performance. It solves the
problem of raising and lowering
frontdrops, or of blowing dry ice
onstage, but it also distances the
audience in a work that demands
close attention to follow its
wonders.
In some cases, though, the

screen works marvelously, such as
when Vere disappears into the mist
from the top deck. The lights glare
on the screen and then subside to
make it look as if the fog closed in
after him.
The lighting in the hanging scene
is spectacular also. Billy is hanged
offstage left, as the sun comes up.
At the moment of his death the
most brilliant light in the production
falls on the faces of those watching

from the deck, while the mast of
the ship fades into a ghostly outline.
Though the production does not
overuse Melville's symbolism, this
scene references the crucifixion.
(Earlier, Captain Vere expresses
his agony with the conclusion that
"the angel must die," and then
refuses to save Billy at the trial.)
It is, on the whole, a fine perfor
mance and definitely worth seeing
and hearing.

work, the San Francisco Opera is
ambitious in presenting this produc
tion.
The opera begins in 1797, on an
English ship during the war against
France. Captain Vere heads the
H.M.S. Indomitable, which has just
impressed several sailors from the
merchant ship, The Rights of Man.
Among them Is Billy Budd (played
by Dale Duesing), a handsome,
young, simple and good recruit with
but one defect — he stammers
when stressed. The master-at
arms, Claggert, despises his beauty
and goodness, and swears to
destroy him.
Claggert wickedly frames Billy
and both come before the captain,
where the master-at-arms accuses
the sailor of conspiring to mutiny.
Billy's frank manner with Vere con
vinces him that the boy is innocent,
but Claggert's accusations enrage
Billy so much that he is unable to
speak his defense. In frustration,
Billy lunges at Claggert and kills
him. For this Billy must hang,
despite Vere's anguish at good suc
cumbing to evil.
The voices are solid in this pro
duction, but not distinctive, except

for James Morris as Claggert. Clag
gert, the master-at-arms respon
sible for keeping the men in line, is
a slimy creature of single-minded
malice. Each time he appears, the
music contains dark trombone
chords. Echoing this mood, Morris'
tone is threatening and ominously
slow (as if Billy's destruction were
inevitable and he could take his
time).
Duesing's Billy Budd is enthusi
astic and convincing, full of purity,
his only flaw the frustration arising
from his stammering.
The performance of Vere Games
King) is solid throughout the pro
duction, until the vital moment in
which he must condemn Billy to
death. The tension when Vere
refuses to save the young seaman
does not reach a point where we
can feel how torn the captain is
about ordering Billy's execution. In
answer to Billy's plea, "Save me,
my captain," King's manner is
merely implacable. There is no
hesitation, and King's gestures
seem empty — as when he bows
his head after the others leave the
room.
Given that the work is taxing
(albeit magnificent) for an audience,
the San Francisco Opera's sets
aren't always helpful. To create the

look of a foggy and eerie shipboard,
there is a thin, mottled sort of
screen that separates the artists
from the audience throughout the
entire performance. It solves the
problem of raising and lowering
frontdrops, or of blowing dry ice
onstage, but it also distances the
audience in a work that demands
close attention to follow its
wonders.
In some cases, though, the

screen works marvelously, such as
when Vere disappears into the mist
from the top deck. The lights glare
on the screen and then subside to
make it look as if the fog closed in
after him.
The lighting in the hanging scene
is spectacular also. Billy is hanged
offstage left, as the sun comes up.
At the moment of his death the
most brilliant light in the production
falls on the faces of those watching

from the deck, while the mast of
the ship fades into a ghostly outline.
Though the production does not
overuse Melville's symbolism, this
scene references the crucifixion.
(Earlier, Captain Vere expresses
his agony with the conclusion that
"the angel must die," and then
refuses to save Billy at the trial.)
It is, on the whole, a fine perfor
mance and definitely worth seeing
and hearing.

In the Prologue of Benjamin Brit
ten's "Billy Budd," the captain la
ments the fact that what appears
perfect on the surface is always
flawed — that good and evil inter
twine to weave history. On a spe
cific level, this can be applied to the
San Francisco Opera's final offering
this season, "Billy Budd," adapted
by Britten from Herman Melville's
novella of the same title. The pro
duction has uninspired, dull parts,
as well as remarkably coherent and
magnificent ones.
Britten's work is layered and
complex musically, and the libretto
by E.M. Forster and Eric Crozier
lends added depths. The music is
full of erratic rhythms and inter
woven musical themes, often
composed of dissonant chords. It is
performed in English, a language in
which consonants prevail (and
vowels carry the tune).
As such, "Billy Budd" is difficult
to perform as well as listen to.
(Although the more you listen to
Britten, the more his music grows
on you — if you don't wholeheart
edly embrace his work, at least you
come to appreciate its subtlety and
variation.)
• Moreover, "Billy Budd" is un

relieved by the flamboyance and lilt
of a soprano, since there are no
women aboard the man-o'-war.
