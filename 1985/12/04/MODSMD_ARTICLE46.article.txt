# Autograph Plays Rock With Mass Appeal

### LIZ GOODMAN 
Imagine yourself driving down Campus
Drive when your favorite song comes on
the radio. You will probably proceed to turn
it up, way up. For the five members of the
rock band Autograph, capturing this basic
instinct with their song "Turn Up the
Radio" was the clinching factor in gaining
national attention.
"I think it's something everyone can
relate to," said lead vocalist and guitarist
Steve Plunkett during a phone interview
earlier this week. "When you're in your car
and a good song comes on, I think everybody
turns it up. It's just a natural thing, and to
me that is the appeal of the song."
This attempt to produce something that
"everyone can relate to" typifies Auto
graph's musical approach. Its sound is very

mainstream melodic hard-rock which has a
wide general appeal, and even while coming
up with its name, Autograph considered
this idea of "mass appeal." Said Plunkett,
"We wanted a generic label that didn't imply
anything."
However, don't mistake this musical ap
proach for a conservative game plan. Auto
graph was willing to try anything to gain
recognition. Case in point is the band's ac
tual genesis.
The collective members of Autograph
(including Randy Rand on bass, Keni Ric
hards on drums, Steve Lynch on lead guitar
and Steven Isham on keyboards) had been
together for only a few months when Keni
Richard's jogging partner, David Lee Roth,
offered the band the chance to open up for
Van Halen on their 1984 tour.
Two weeks later Autograph found itself
playing in front of 15,000 people. The band

did not even have an album out, and it
wasn't until midway through the tour that
the members signed a recording contract.
However, Plunkett insists, "It was
definitely not an overnight success. We did
spend a long time. I think everyone has to."
All members of Autograph were veteran
members of the rock scene, having individ
ually played in their share of small, relatively
unknown bands as well as touring as back
up members for the likes of Lita Ford and
Holly Penfield.
Another unique aspect of their image oc
curred when they were approached by
Papermate. Papermate agreed to finance
Autograph's first video if a Papermate pen
appeared in the video. Papermate thought
it would be appropriate since Autographs
first album was entitled "Sign in Please."
"To us it was an endorsement that made
sense," said Plunkett."Without a video

nowadays it is hard for a band to break.
With a video you can be everywhere at
once. Without it you are very limited."
This video for "Turn Up the Radio"
recieved repeated airplay on MTV and
helped their first album sell over three —
quarters of a million copies, a rarity for a
debut album. Autograph members hope
that their latest release, "That's the Stuff,"
will be equally as well received. " That's
the Stuff' sounds a lot better," said
Plunkett. "I think the band has really
matured as a unit. You can also hear the dif
ference in the individual performances. I
think everyone is playing with much more
confidence and I think it definitely estab
lishes the style — which you can't do in just
one album."
Autograph has also taken part in several
movie soundtracks including the films
"Secret Admirer,'l "Fright Night" and the

soon to be released "Youngblood" starring
Rob Lowe.
"It's a whole different audience," said
Plunkett, "I think it gives us credibility
mainly."
Autograph is currently in the midst of a
tour as a supporting act for Motley Crue
(with whom they appeared at the Cow
Palace last Sunday). They find it easier to
tour as with with an album out. "By the
second album people start to see who you
are and recognize you."
Though both of the bands that they have
opened for are renowned for their party
ing expertise, Plunkett confides, "Touring
with the Crue is more fun because when we
were touring with Van Halen we were to
tally unknown. Our live show wasn't really
happening at that point. Now that we're
more of a band were having a great time on
and offthe stage."
