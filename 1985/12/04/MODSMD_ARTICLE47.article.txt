# 'Opera Comique' Flawed but Funny
## 
### PETER MORGAN Staff writer 
American Conservatory
Theatre's "Opera Comique," writ
ten and directed by Nagle Jackson,
is a good laugh and fairly stimulat
ing, but like any new play, it has its
problems.
The play alternates between two
plots occurring simultaneously at
the Opera Comique in Paris during
the opening night performance of
Bizet's "Carmen" in 1875. The first
concerns a middle-class couple, the
Corniches, who are trying to marry
their beautiful daughter Viviane off
to the son of their friend, Monsieur
Vigneron. The opera has been des
ignated as the proper social occa
sion to "introduce" Viviane to Hec
tor, the son — who is sex-crazed.
The arranged marriage, however,
is simply a ploy for Madame Cor
niche and Vigneron to continue
their secret love affair. Unfortun
ately Viviane falls for Vigneron in
stead of his son, and things get
pretty farcical pretty fast. All this
occurs in the corridor outside the
private boxes the two families are
occupying.
In between their boxes is Bizet's
box, and he also comes out during
intermissions, agonizing over the
opening night of his opera. Bizet's
plight is comic too, but has very
serious "artistic" moments in addi
tion. He and his friend Ernest dis
cuss art, audiences and critics with
fervor and anguish. The play con
cludes with a tying together of
these two plots when Viviane con
fronts Bizet about his work and its
portrayal of love and romance.
Generally this play works. Jack
son is a careful craftsman, which is
essential in writing "extreme"
forms like farce. With the Bizet plot
he equally avoids the common trap
of writing about disillusioned and
alienated artists, that of one-sided
sympathy and self-pity. My only
problem with the play is that it was
inspired by one emotional germ and
was written with another. Jackson
states in the program notes that he
was inspired by the thought of Bizet
dying in despair and solitude shortly

after 1875, believing that "Carmen"
was an artistic failure. This was his
inspiration and the heart of the play,
but not exactly what he ended up
writing. The addition of the sex
comedy serves a good purpose, but
it undercuts rather than supports
the point of the play. Although the
ending scene portrays the Cor
niches as a bourgeois contrast to
Bizet's artistic philosophy of love
and romance, and gives Bizet
someone to openly argue with, all
the previous scenes with the Cor
niches have had a different tone:
pure entertainment.
Looking back on the play, I can
see Jackson the craftsman setting

up the final scene by placing in ear
lier scenes complaints and dissatis
factions in Viviane and Vigneron's
mouth but when I was watching
the play these foreshadowings
seemed simply incongruous to the
farcical tone. To be fair, I never
thought I would hear from an in
genue in a sex comedy set in 1875
declaring her passionate desire for
an "older man" to take care of her,
and yet I fully believed the truth of
it. This, though, was the exception
to the rule.
This is simply to say that "Opera
Comique" is more than a funny
farce, but obviously so. Jackson is
experimenting with established

genres (bedroom farce and sympa
thetic tragedy) and is only partially
successful. There are wonderful
moments and there are slow,
heavy-handed ones.
One of the wonderful things is
Henry Woronicz's Bizet. Jackson ob
viously played favorites in his
writing, but even Bizet has some
textual flaws that Woronicz handles
admirably. He is funny and serious
at the same time in capturing the
zeal of the artist, which is both
awesome and admirable to exper
ience, and at the same alien and
narrow-minded. His lengthy
monologue about writing "Carmen"
is both serious and comic in its ar
tistic earnestness.
In general the cast is adequate.
There are no stars but there are no
glaring failures either. The worst I
can say about the acting is that Mar
cia Pizzo's Viviane has a jaw that
works overtime in attaining
"correct" diction. This was a fairly
obvious case of technical acting
overemphasized to the point one
wondered if Viviane cared about her
lover or was taking a quiz in
pronouncing every word sweetly
and demurely. This is just a little
thing, but it repeated itself enough
that I was very suspicious of this
person at the big finale. The experi
enced cast headed up by Peter
Donat, Dakin Matthews, Joan
Stuart-Morris and Maria Walters
knows how to do comedy with a
second-nature smoothness, and
this confidence is something ACT
should pride itself on. The setting
and costumes are all well done and
support the play without over
powering it, again a merited charac
teristic of ACT's production values.
"Opera Comique" entertains
nicely and also makes you think
about attitudes toward art and ar
tists. It is a bit heavy-handed and
slow at points, but the intention is
good and comes through nonethe
less. I suppose critics always have a
hard time with new plays that ex
periment with old, traditional
forms. In any case "Opera
Comique" is not great drama, but
certainly it is good drama and a
credit to the writing and directing
abilities of Jackson.

can say about the acting is that Mar
cia Pizzo's Viviane has a jaw that
works overtime in attaining
"correct" diction. This was a fairly
obvious case of technical acting
overemphasized to the point one
wondered if Viviane cared about her
lover or was taking a quiz in
pronouncing every word sweetly
and demurely. This is just a little
thing, but it repeated itself enough
that I was very suspicious of this
person at the big finale. The experi
enced cast headed up by Peter
Donat, Dakin Matthews, Joan
Stuart-Morris and Maria Walters
knows how to do comedy with a
second-nature smoothness, and
this confidence is something ACT
should pride itself on. The setting
and costumes are all well done and
support the play without over
powering it, again a merited charac
teristic of ACT's production values.
"Opera Comique" entertains
nicely and also makes you think
about attitudes toward art and ar
tists. It is a bit heavy-handed and
slow at points, but the intention is
good and comes through nonethe
less. I suppose critics always have a
hard time with new plays that ex
periment with old, traditional
forms. In any case "Opera
Comique" is not great drama, but
certainly it is good drama and a
credit to the writing and directing
abilities of Jackson.

American Conservatory
Theatre's "Opera Comique," writ
ten and directed by Nagle Jackson,
is a good laugh and fairly stimulat
ing, but like any new play, it has its
problems.
The play alternates between two
plots occurring simultaneously at
the Opera Comique in Paris during
the opening night performance of
Bizet's "Carmen" in 1875. The first
concerns a middle-class couple, the
Corniches, who are trying to marry
their beautiful daughter Viviane off
to the son of their friend, Monsieur
Vigneron. The opera has been des
ignated as the proper social occa
sion to "introduce" Viviane to Hec
tor, the son — who is sex-crazed.
The arranged marriage, however,
is simply a ploy for Madame Cor
niche and Vigneron to continue
their secret love affair. Unfortun
ately Viviane falls for Vigneron in
stead of his son, and things get
pretty farcical pretty fast. All this
occurs in the corridor outside the
private boxes the two families are
occupying.
In between their boxes is Bizet's
box, and he also comes out during
intermissions, agonizing over the
opening night of his opera. Bizet's
plight is comic too, but has very
serious "artistic" moments in addi
tion. He and his friend Ernest dis
cuss art, audiences and critics with
fervor and anguish. The play con
cludes with a tying together of
these two plots when Viviane con
fronts Bizet about his work and its
portrayal of love and romance.
Generally this play works. Jack
son is a careful craftsman, which is
essential in writing "extreme"
forms like farce. With the Bizet plot
he equally avoids the common trap
of writing about disillusioned and
alienated artists, that of one-sided
sympathy and self-pity. My only
problem with the play is that it was
inspired by one emotional germ and
was written with another. Jackson
states in the program notes that he
was inspired by the thought of Bizet
dying in despair and solitude shortly

after 1875, believing that "Carmen"
was an artistic failure. This was his
inspiration and the heart of the play,
but not exactly what he ended up
writing. The addition of the sex
comedy serves a good purpose, but
it undercuts rather than supports
the point of the play. Although the
ending scene portrays the Cor
niches as a bourgeois contrast to
Bizet's artistic philosophy of love
and romance, and gives Bizet
someone to openly argue with, all
the previous scenes with the Cor
niches have had a different tone:
pure entertainment.
Looking back on the play, I can
see Jackson the craftsman setting

up the final scene by placing in ear
lier scenes complaints and dissatis
factions in Viviane and Vigneron's
mouth but when I was watching
the play these foreshadowings
seemed simply incongruous to the
farcical tone. To be fair, I never
thought I would hear from an in
genue in a sex comedy set in 1875
declaring her passionate desire for
an "older man" to take care of her,
and yet I fully believed the truth of
it. This, though, was the exception
to the rule.
This is simply to say that "Opera
Comique" is more than a funny
farce, but obviously so. Jackson is
experimenting with established

genres (bedroom farce and sympa
thetic tragedy) and is only partially
successful. There are wonderful
moments and there are slow,
heavy-handed ones.
One of the wonderful things is
Henry Woronicz's Bizet. Jackson ob
viously played favorites in his
writing, but even Bizet has some
textual flaws that Woronicz handles
admirably. He is funny and serious
at the same time in capturing the
zeal of the artist, which is both
awesome and admirable to exper
ience, and at the same alien and
narrow-minded. His lengthy
monologue about writing "Carmen"
is both serious and comic in its ar
tistic earnestness.
In general the cast is adequate.

glaring failures either. The worst I
