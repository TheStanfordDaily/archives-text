# Lowe Hits Keystone With Powerful Rock
## 
### TRACY FURUTANI 
Perhaps the incident which best encapsulated the tone of Nick
Lowe and his Cowboy Outfit's show at the Keystone Big Game week
came during the first encore, when Lowe accepted a "Fuck Cal" but
ton from some Stanford students in the first row and laughingly
pinned it on the breast of his Yale T-shirt.
Lowe and backup group have been described as the best English
bar band. They certainly lived up to that reputation. The perfor
mance was lively and engaging, but most of all, it was fun. In other
words, if you went to this show, missing "Gaieties" was no big loss.
The evening appeared to be headed for the opposite conclusion,
however, when the first opening band took the stage. Grey Matter is
a local group with a self-proclaimed large following on KZSU. Their
set was a new experience at the Keystone: clean instrumentals and
crisp vocals that could be heard above the music. Unfortunately,
Grey Matter's self-touted "political" songs had the compelling
message that maybe everyone should take a stand on something.
Heavy.
The second opening act, a North Carolina group called Ac
celerator, returned to the traditional Keystone act: heavily distorted
guitars with incomprehensible frantic singing. Accelerator's lead
singer, who bears a striking resemblance to Husker Du's lead
singer, interspersing frenzied shouting of lyrics and Southern
accented explaining of the same. They were less pretentious than
the first group and thus a lot better. Their amphetamine-laced cover
of "Be-Bop-A-Lula" helped matters along.
So by the time Lowe took the stage, the crowd was primed for an
awesome show, something that Lowe is particularly adept at giving.
Cigarette-smoking, gum-chewing and grinning like a madman, he
appeared with his bass guitar and chatted with the audience before
his band broke into the first song.
Ostensibly promoting his recent "Rose of England" album, he did
only four songs from it, with the balance of the show including a
healthy amount of old material, including a Brinsley Schwartz song,
and — talk about obscure — a tune from his Rockpile days.
Paul Carrack, the Cowboy Outfit's keyboardist, shared vocal
chores with Lowe. Among others, Carrack sang "Tempted" —
Squeeze's American chartbuster — and "How Long Has This Been
Going On?" — a hit off his own album.
Not to be outdone, Lowe had a few hits of his own to perform, in
cluding "Marie Provost" ("She was a winner that became the
doggie's dinner") and his current Top 40 tune, the foot-stomping "I
Knew the Bride (When She Used to Rock 'n' Roll)." With Bobby Ir
win's steady skin-bashing and Martin Belmont's live-wire guitar,
even the older and more obscure material had a life of its own, cap
tivating the audience as much as the hits did.
The show was extremely fast-paced: in the space of an hour and
15 minutes, Lowe and his band rollicked through 18 songs, with time,
enough for Lowe's own stage antics.
After nearly every song, Lowe would turn to the audience and
give a double thumbs-up sign — an appropriate sign for the whole
performance. !
