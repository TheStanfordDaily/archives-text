## 'Immodest Acts' Deserves a Better Title 
### JENNIFER WILSON 
"Immodest Acts: The Life of a
Lesbian Nun in Renaissance
Italy"
Dr. Judith Brown
Oxford University Press, 1986
I was fascinated by Rosemary
Curb and Nancy Manahan's recent
book, "Lesbian Nuns," writings by
and interviews with lesbians who
are or were nuns, and was eager to
read Dr. Judith Brown's latest
book, "Immodest Acts: The Life of
a Lesbian Nun In Renaissance
Italy." I expected it to be the his
torical counterpart to "Lesbian
Nuns."
Brown's book, however, is quite
different. She does give as much in
formation as can be discerned about
about an Italian nun who had a
homosexual relationship with a fel
low nun. "Immodest Acts,"
however, is more the story of this
nun's bid for sainthood and of the
political, religious and social context
in which she tried and failed to
achieve this status.
Benedetta Carletta was born in
1590 in a small town in the moun
tains of Italy. After surviving a diffi
cult birth, she was named "blessed"
in Italian and dedicated to God.
During her childhood, Benedetta
received signs from God that she
Was precious to him. Birds sang at
her command, and at nine, having
joined the Theatine nuns, she saw a
statue of the Virgin Mary nod at

her. Another time, the entire
statue leaned over the railing of its
enclosure toward her.
At age 23, Benedetta began
having visions that offered her spiri
tual guidance. At first, her mother
superior and father confessor at the
Theatine home were concerned
with whether or not Benedetta's vi
sions came from God or the devil.
Visions in general were beginning
to be looked at dubiously; despite
their theological grounding and
pedagogical value, they remained
outside the sacramental structure
of the Catholic church.
Her father confessor urged
Benedetta to try to stop or avoid
her visions and to pray for
"travails." Benedetta did, and was
rewarded with "such intense pains
. . . that she was often paralyzed
by them," and for which her doc
tors could find no cause. This was
the sign Benedetta needed to cer
tify that her visions were divine.
Two years later her visions
began again. This time, however,
"instead of encounters with Jesus
and with benevolent angles, she
now was pursued at night by
handsome young men who wanted
to kill her and who beat her all over
with iron chains. . . . The attacks
took place several times a week
after going to bed and lasted for six
to eight hours." As she was in great
pain during these attacks, another
nun, Batholomea Crivelli, was as
signed to watch her at night.
During these nightly sessions,
Bartholomea witnessed Benedetta

receiving stigmata. The blessing of
stigmata on Benedetta brought
status to her order and to the nun
herself. Shortly thereafter she was
elected abbess. While in trance she
was allowed to preach to her
sisters, something usually ab
solutely forbidden to women; she

was allowed to do so only because
God spoke through her.
Her next vision involved an ex
change of hearts with Jesus; like
many of her contemporary female
saints, Benedetta was the recipient
of Jesus's "sacred heart." Soon af
terward Jesus instructed Benedetta

to go on a restricted diet, assigned
a guardian angel to her named
Splenditello and commanded
Benedetta to make ready for their
marriage, which was to occur "a
week later, on the day of the Holy
Trinity." Jesus gave Benedetta
detailed instructins for the prepara
tions for the wedding and a list of all
the public figures he wanted pres
ent. During the ceremony Jesus
spoke to the assembled through
Benedetta, praising her greatly and
exhorting the other nuns to obey
her.
Benedetta's praise of herself
during this ceremony, her threats
of damnation for those who did not
believe in her mystical powers, her
request that public officials be pres
ent, and the lack of any tangible
evidence that a "ceremony" oc
curred, aroused suspicion in her su
periors, and an investigation was
begun by local officials. The first
stage of this investigation revealed
nothing not already known about
Benedetta. She was questioned on
several occasions about her stig
mata, her visions and the mar
riage. Her wounds were examined
at each visit. Again, of most con
cern to her examiners was whether
or not her visions were divine or
evil.
At that time, the church had cer
tain "criteria" to which visionaries
had to conform. The visionary was
supposed to be humble, not seeking
to have visions; the visions had to
be real visions, rather than dreams
or "ecstasies"; her visions had to

conform to orthodox Catholic
doctrine; and visions had to "give
rise to greater humility and the
realization that the gifts God be
stowed on the soul were not the
result of its own merits but a free
gift of God." Benedetta's inves
tigators concluded that she met all
these requirements, although on
the last item she barely squeaked
by.
Her examiners also spoke with
the acting abbess during Benedet
ta's investigation, Bartholomea and
several other nuns. These women
confirmed Benedetta's claims about
her visions. Following this investi
gation, Benedetta was reinstated as
abbess.
It is unclear what prompted the
second investigation of Benedetta's
claims, which occurred three or
four years after the first. This time
her examiners were church offi
cials, and they decided Benedetta
did not in fact meet the criteria for
an authentic visionary or saint.
Indeed, it became apparent that she
was a fraud, that she had faked the
stigmata. The ring she claimed she
received from Jesus at their
"wedding" was also false.
While Benedetta might simply
have been excused as "misguided"
for faking her visions, her ex
aminers uncovered something else
they found damning â€” she was
having sex with her Bartholomea,
or rather her "guardian angel"
Splenditello acted through
