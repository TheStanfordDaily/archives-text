## 'Immodest Acts' Deserves a Better Title 
### JENNIFER WILSON 
"Immodest Acts: The Life of a
Lesbian Nun in Renaissance
Italy"
Dr. Judith Brown
Oxford University Press, 1986
I was fascinated by Rosemary
Curb and Nancy Manahan's recent
book, "Lesbian Nuns," writings by
and interviews with lesbians who
are or were nuns, and was eager to
read Dr. Judith Brown's latest
book, "Immodest Acts: The Life of
a Lesbian Nun In Renaissance
Italy." I expected it to be the his
torical counterpart to "Lesbian
Nuns."
Brown's book, however, is quite
different. She does give as much in
formation as can be discerned about
about an Italian nun who had a
homosexual relationship with a fel
low nun. "Immodest Acts,"
however, is more the story of this
nun's bid for sainthood and of the
political, religious and social context
in which she tried and failed to
achieve this status.
Benedetta Carletta was born in
1590 in a small town in the moun
tains of Italy. After surviving a diffi
cult birth, she was named "blessed"
in Italian and dedicated to God.
During her childhood, Benedetta
received signs from God that she
Was precious to him. Birds sang at
her command, and at nine, having
joined the Theatine nuns, she saw a
statue of the Virgin Mary nod at

her. Another time, the entire
statue leaned over the railing of its
enclosure toward her.
At age 23, Benedetta began
having visions that offered her spiri
tual guidance. At first, her mother
superior and father confessor at the
Theatine home were concerned
with whether or not Benedetta's vi
sions came from God or the devil.
Visions in general were beginning
to be looked at dubiously; despite
their theological grounding and
pedagogical value, they remained
outside the sacramental structure
of the Catholic church.
Her father confessor urged
Benedetta to try to stop or avoid
her visions and to pray for
"travails." Benedetta did, and was
rewarded with "such intense pains
. . . that she was often paralyzed
by them," and for which her doc
tors could find no cause. This was
the sign Benedetta needed to cer
tify that her visions were divine.
Two years later her visions
began again. This time, however,
"instead of encounters with Jesus
and with benevolent angles, she
now was pursued at night by
handsome young men who wanted
to kill her and who beat her all over
with iron chains. . . . The attacks
took place several times a week
after going to bed and lasted for six
to eight hours." As she was in great
pain during these attacks, another
nun, Batholomea Crivelli, was as
signed to watch her at night.
During these nightly sessions,
Bartholomea witnessed Benedetta

receiving stigmata. The blessing of
stigmata on Benedetta brought
status to her order and to the nun
herself. Shortly thereafter she was
elected abbess. While in trance she
was allowed to preach to her
sisters, something usually ab
solutely forbidden to women; she

was allowed to do so only because
God spoke through her.
Her next vision involved an ex
change of hearts with Jesus; like
many of her contemporary female
saints, Benedetta was the recipient
of Jesus's "sacred heart." Soon af
terward Jesus instructed Benedetta

to go on a restricted diet, assigned
a guardian angel to her named
Splenditello and commanded
Benedetta to make ready for their
marriage, which was to occur "a
week later, on the day of the Holy
Trinity." Jesus gave Benedetta
detailed instructins for the prepara
tions for the wedding and a list of all
the public figures he wanted pres
ent. During the ceremony Jesus
spoke to the assembled through
Benedetta, praising her greatly and
exhorting the other nuns to obey
her.
Benedetta's praise of herself
during this ceremony, her threats
of damnation for those who did not
believe in her mystical powers, her
request that public officials be pres
ent, and the lack of any tangible
evidence that a "ceremony" oc
curred, aroused suspicion in her su
periors, and an investigation was
begun by local officials. The first
stage of this investigation revealed
nothing not already known about
Benedetta. She was questioned on
several occasions about her stig
mata, her visions and the mar
riage. Her wounds were examined
at each visit. Again, of most con
cern to her examiners was whether
or not her visions were divine or
evil.
At that time, the church had cer
tain "criteria" to which visionaries
had to conform. The visionary was
supposed to be humble, not seeking
to have visions; the visions had to
be real visions, rather than dreams
or "ecstasies"; her visions had to

conform to orthodox Catholic
doctrine; and visions had to "give
rise to greater humility and the
realization that the gifts God be
stowed on the soul were not the
result of its own merits but a free
gift of God." Benedetta's inves
tigators concluded that she met all
these requirements, although on
the last item she barely squeaked
by.
Her examiners also spoke with
the acting abbess during Benedet
ta's investigation, Bartholomea and
several other nuns. These women
confirmed Benedetta's claims about
her visions. Following this investi
gation, Benedetta was reinstated as
abbess.
It is unclear what prompted the
second investigation of Benedetta's
claims, which occurred three or
four years after the first. This time
her examiners were church offi
cials, and they decided Benedetta
did not in fact meet the criteria for
an authentic visionary or saint.
Indeed, it became apparent that she
was a fraud, that she had faked the
stigmata. The ring she claimed she
received from Jesus at their
"wedding" was also false.
While Benedetta might simply
have been excused as "misguided"
for faking her visions, her ex
aminers uncovered something else
they found damning — she was
having sex with her Bartholomea,
or rather her "guardian angel"
Splenditello acted through

Benedetta and forced Bartholomea
into sexual encounters with him.
Benedetta was removed from
her position as abbess and im
prisoned within the convent until
her death 35 years later. According
to Brown, it appears this harsh
punishment was served mostly be
cause she presented fraudulent
claims of mysticism and sainthood,
and only in part because of her
homosexual relationship.
For those readers who are not
familiar with the Renaissance or
with gay and lesbian history, Brown
provides 15 pages of introduction to
the history of lay and religious laws
and beliefs about homosexual male
and lesbian acts. While this discus
sion is necessary in order to under
stand the story as it unfolds, the
narrative would have run more
smoothly had this information been
incorporated into the text. Brown
also provides the reader with other
fairly lengthy historical information
within the text, such as information
regarding mysticism within the
Catholic church, the Theatine order
and prohibitions against women
preaching.
Brown attempts to give the

reader a psychological analysis of
Benedetta's behavior. I found this
analysis frequently simplistic and al
ways unsatisfying in that it left out
her homosexuality. Brown con
structed the narrative so that it told
Benedetta's story chronologically
as facts were recorded or discov
ered about her, not as they oc
curred. This choice of approach
prohibits Brown from fully discuss
ing the reasons for Benedetta's
trauma. This is a regrettable error
in construction.
After recounting Benedetta's
first vision, Brown states that "the
content of mystical experiences,
whether we view them as psycho
logical or divine revelations, or as
physiological responses to fasting,
disclose the mystic's deepest spiri
tual concerns. To understand the
messages revealed in Benedetta's
visions is therefore to understand
what was foremost in her mind." If
her visions are creations of the
mystic herself, then this is probably
true; if however, they are divine
revelations, then this may not be
the case. Disregarding the latter
possibility, the author sets herself
the task of understanding "the
messages revealed in Benedetta's
visions" and behavior.
Father Ricordati, Benedetta's
father confessor, advised her to

"repress the onset of visions and to
'pray to god that he send her
travails instead of ecstasies and
revelation.' " Commenting on
Benedetta's illness, during which
she was paralyzed by intense pains
over her entire body, especially at
night, Brown states that "the deep

was experiencing." While it is clear
she was suffering conflict, it seems
to me more probable that this
stemmed more from the conflict be
tween her nightly liasions with Bar
tolomea and her professed beliefs
and commitments, reinforced by
societal beliefs and censure.

in Bendetta's visions is therefore to
understand what was foremost in her
mind.'
— Judith Brown

sense of conflict between her nat
ural inclination to give in to her ec
static experiences and her desire to
follow the advice of her confessor
weighed heavily on her mind. . . .
Benedetta's malady was a physical
manifestation of the internal suffer
ing and the unresolved conflict she

In one of her visions, Benedetta
was ordered by Jesus "not to eat
meat, eggs and milk products and
not to drink anything but water."
This left her with a very restricted
diet, akin to fasting. Brown main
tains that Benedetta's fasting
"reflected a deeply seated am

bivalence towards the physical
aspect of her feminine self. By fas
ting she not only rejected the whole
realm of food preparation and con
sumption traditionally associated
with women, but she cleansed her
body of the impurities of the female
sex ... it had been observed by
physicians and theologians that fas
ting curtailed menustration." While
this may be one of the reasons that
Benedetta fasted, I find this analy
sis too general.
If her fasting was "a troubled and
negative act," as Brown claims,
then the trouble it reflected is more
likely the aforementioned conflict
between her homosexuality and her
professed values. She was already
not behaving as a feminine woman
(according to society's standards)
by virtue of her relationship with
Bartolomea. Her visions of beauti
ful young men who tried to seduce
her and then beat her, her claim
that she was "in love with" and par
ticipated in a marriage with Jesus,
and that she was punished by
Splenditello for her misdeeds, point
to the intense difficulty she had in
resolving the issue of her sexuality.
Bartolomea claimed it was Splen
ditello, speaking through
Benedetta, who forced her to com
mit sexual acts with the body of
Benedetta. And Benedetta never

admitted to engaging in homosexual
acts; it was only in the guise of a
male angel that she did so, never
simply as herself.
Brown does place Benedetta
Carlini's story in a firm historical
context, providing ample back
ground information about the per
iod. However, although the book's
subtitle is "The Life of a Lesbian
Nun in Renaisance Italy,"
Benedetta's homosexual feelings
and relationship — and their conse
quences in emotional terms — are
hardly discussed, even when
"Immodest Acts" looks at
Benedetta's expressions of conflict
and emotional pain. Indeed,
Brown's discussion of the discovery
of Benedetta and Bartolomea's re
lationship is surprisingly brief. In
stead, Brown's work (as well as
Benedetta's contemporaries'), em
phasizes the nun's failed bid for im
mortality. While "Immodest Acts"
is important to gay and lesbian his
tory, it is more important for its
portrayal of a confused and troubled
nun's attempt at sainthood.
Brown's book is certainly well
researched and well-written, and if
one is not looking for just what the
book advertises, it could be a sat
sifying read. "Immodest Acts"
merely needs another title and a
little more insight.

trauma. This is a regrettable error
in construction.
After recounting Benedetta's
first vision, Brown states that "the
content of mystical experiences,
whether we view them as psycho
logical or divine revelations, or as
physiological responses to fasting,
disclose the mystic's deepest spiri

her visions are creations of the

the task of understanding "the

Father Ricordati, Benedetta's
father confessor, advised her to

"repress the onset of visions and to
'pray to god that he send her
travails instead of ecstasies and

Benedetta's illness, during which
she was paralyzed by intense pains
over her entire body, especially at
night, Brown states that "the deep

she was suffering conflict, it seems
to me more probable that this
stemmed more from the conflict be

sense of conflict between her nat
ural inclination to give in to her ec
static experiences and her desire to
follow the advice of her confessor
weighed heavily on her mind. . . .
Benedetta's malady was a physical
manifestation of the internal suffer
ing and the unresolved conflict she

In one of her visions, Benedetta
was ordered by Jesus "not to eat
meat, eggs and milk products and
not to drink anything but water."
This left her with a very restricted
diet, akin to fasting. Brown main
tains that Benedetta's fasting
"reflected a deeply seated am

bivalence towards the physical
aspect of her feminine self. By fas
ting she not only rejected the whole
realm of food preparation and con
sumption traditionally associated
with women, but she cleansed her
body of the impurities of the female
sex ... it had been observed by
physicians and theologians that fas
ting curtailed menustration." While
this may be one of the reasons that
Benedetta fasted, I find this analy
sis too general.
If her fasting was "a troubled and
negative act," as Brown claims,
then the trouble it reflected is more
likely the aforementioned conflict
between her homosexuality and her
professed values. She was already
not behaving as a feminine woman
(according to society's standards)
by virtue of her relationship with
Bartolomea. Her visions of beauti
ful young men who tried to seduce
her and then beat her, her claim
that she was "in love with" and par
ticipated in a marriage with Jesus,
and that she was punished by
Splenditello for her misdeeds, point
to the intense difficulty she had in
resolving the issue of her sexuality.
Bartolomea claimed it was Splen
ditello, speaking through
Benedetta, who forced her to com
mit sexual acts with the body of
Benedetta. And Benedetta never

admitted to engaging in homosexual
acts; it was only in the guise of a
male angel that she did so, never
simply as herself.
Brown does place Benedetta
Carlini's story in a firm historical
context, providing ample back
ground information about the per
iod. However, although the book's
subtitle is "The Life of a Lesbian
Nun in Renaisance Italy,"
Benedetta's homosexual feelings
and relationship — and their conse
quences in emotional terms — are
hardly discussed, even when
"Immodest Acts" looks at
Benedetta's expressions of conflict
and emotional pain. Indeed,
Brown's discussion of the discovery
of Benedetta and Bartolomea's re
lationship is surprisingly brief. In
stead, Brown's work (as well as
Benedetta's contemporaries'), em
phasizes the nun's failed bid for im
mortality. While "Immodest Acts"
is important to gay and lesbian his
tory, it is more important for its
portrayal of a confused and troubled
nun's attempt at sainthood.
Brown's book is certainly well
researched and well-written, and if
one is not looking for just what the
book advertises, it could be a sat
sifying read. "Immodest Acts"
merely needs another title and a
little more insight.
"Immodest Acts: The Life of a
Lesbian Nun in Renaissance
Italy"
Dr. Judith Brown
Oxford University Press, 1986
I was fascinated by Rosemary
Curb and Nancy Manahan's recent
book, "Lesbian Nuns," writings by
and interviews with lesbians who
are or were nuns, and was eager to
read Dr. Judith Brown's latest
book, "Immodest Acts: The Life of
a Lesbian Nun In Renaissance
Italy." I expected it to be the his
torical counterpart to "Lesbian
Nuns."
Brown's book, however, is quite
different. She does give as much in
formation as can be discerned about
about an Italian nun who had a
homosexual relationship with a fel
low nun. "Immodest Acts,"
however, is more the story of this
nun's bid for sainthood and of the
political, religious and social context
in which she tried and failed to
achieve this status.
Benedetta Carletta was born in
1590 in a small town in the moun
tains of Italy. After surviving a diffi
cult birth, she was named "blessed"
in Italian and dedicated to God.
During her childhood, Benedetta
received signs from God that she
Was precious to him. Birds sang at
her command, and at nine, having
joined the Theatine nuns, she saw a
statue of the Virgin Mary nod at

her. Another time, the entire
statue leaned over the railing of its
enclosure toward her.
At age 23, Benedetta began
having visions that offered her spiri
tual guidance. At first, her mother
superior and father confessor at the
Theatine home were concerned
with whether or not Benedetta's vi
sions came from God or the devil.
Visions in general were beginning
to be looked at dubiously; despite
their theological grounding and
pedagogical value, they remained
outside the sacramental structure
of the Catholic church.
Her father confessor urged
Benedetta to try to stop or avoid
her visions and to pray for
"travails." Benedetta did, and was
rewarded with "such intense pains
. . . that she was often paralyzed
by them," and for which her doc
tors could find no cause. This was
the sign Benedetta needed to cer
tify that her visions were divine.
Two years later her visions
began again. This time, however,
"instead of encounters with Jesus
and with benevolent angles, she
now was pursued at night by
handsome young men who wanted
to kill her and who beat her all over
with iron chains. . . . The attacks
took place several times a week
after going to bed and lasted for six
to eight hours." As she was in great
pain during these attacks, another
nun, Batholomea Crivelli, was as
signed to watch her at night.
During these nightly sessions,
Bartholomea witnessed Benedetta

receiving stigmata. The blessing of
stigmata on Benedetta brought
status to her order and to the nun
herself. Shortly thereafter she was
elected abbess. While in trance she
was allowed to preach to her
sisters, something usually ab
solutely forbidden to women; she

was allowed to do so only because
God spoke through her.
Her next vision involved an ex
change of hearts with Jesus; like
many of her contemporary female
saints, Benedetta was the recipient
of Jesus's "sacred heart." Soon af
terward Jesus instructed Benedetta

to go on a restricted diet, assigned
a guardian angel to her named
Splenditello and commanded
Benedetta to make ready for their
marriage, which was to occur "a
week later, on the day of the Holy
Trinity." Jesus gave Benedetta
detailed instructins for the prepara
tions for the wedding and a list of all
the public figures he wanted pres
ent. During the ceremony Jesus
spoke to the assembled through
Benedetta, praising her greatly and
exhorting the other nuns to obey
her.
Benedetta's praise of herself
during this ceremony, her threats
of damnation for those who did not
believe in her mystical powers, her
request that public officials be pres
ent, and the lack of any tangible
evidence that a "ceremony" oc
curred, aroused suspicion in her su
periors, and an investigation was
begun by local officials. The first
stage of this investigation revealed
nothing not already known about
Benedetta. She was questioned on
several occasions about her stig
mata, her visions and the mar
riage. Her wounds were examined
at each visit. Again, of most con
cern to her examiners was whether
or not her visions were divine or
evil.
At that time, the church had cer
tain "criteria" to which visionaries
had to conform. The visionary was
supposed to be humble, not seeking
to have visions; the visions had to
be real visions, rather than dreams
or "ecstasies"; her visions had to

conform to orthodox Catholic
doctrine; and visions had to "give
rise to greater humility and the
realization that the gifts God be
stowed on the soul were not the
result of its own merits but a free
gift of God." Benedetta's inves
tigators concluded that she met all
these requirements, although on
the last item she barely squeaked
by.
Her examiners also spoke with
the acting abbess during Benedet
ta's investigation, Bartholomea and
several other nuns. These women
confirmed Benedetta's claims about
her visions. Following this investi
gation, Benedetta was reinstated as
abbess.
It is unclear what prompted the
second investigation of Benedetta's
claims, which occurred three or
four years after the first. This time
her examiners were church offi
cials, and they decided Benedetta
did not in fact meet the criteria for
an authentic visionary or saint.
Indeed, it became apparent that she
was a fraud, that she had faked the
stigmata. The ring she claimed she
received from Jesus at their
"wedding" was also false.
While Benedetta might simply
have been excused as "misguided"
for faking her visions, her ex
aminers uncovered something else
they found damning — she was
having sex with her Bartholomea,
or rather her "guardian angel"
Splenditello acted through

Benedetta and forced Bartholomea
into sexual encounters with him.
Benedetta was removed from
her position as abbess and im
prisoned within the convent until
her death 35 years later. According
to Brown, it appears this harsh
punishment was served mostly be
cause she presented fraudulent
claims of mysticism and sainthood,
and only in part because of her
homosexual relationship.
For those readers who are not
familiar with the Renaissance or
with gay and lesbian history, Brown
provides 15 pages of introduction to
the history of lay and religious laws
and beliefs about homosexual male
and lesbian acts. While this discus
sion is necessary in order to under
stand the story as it unfolds, the
narrative would have run more
smoothly had this information been
incorporated into the text. Brown
also provides the reader with other
fairly lengthy historical information
within the text, such as information
regarding mysticism within the
Catholic church, the Theatine order
and prohibitions against women
preaching.
Brown attempts to give the

reader a psychological analysis of
Benedetta's behavior. I found this
analysis frequently simplistic and al
ways unsatisfying in that it left out
her homosexuality. Brown con
structed the narrative so that it told
Benedetta's story chronologically
as facts were recorded or discov
ered about her, not as they oc
curred. This choice of approach
prohibits Brown from fully discuss
ing the reasons for Benedetta's
trauma. This is a regrettable error
in construction.
After recounting Benedetta's
first vision, Brown states that "the
content of mystical experiences,
whether we view them as psycho
logical or divine revelations, or as
physiological responses to fasting,

tual concerns. To understand the
messages revealed in Benedetta's

status to her order and to the nun
herself. Shortly thereafter she was
elected abbess. While in trance she
was allowed to preach to her
sisters, something usually ab
solutely forbidden to women; she

was allowed to do so only because
God spoke through her.
Her next vision involved an ex
change of hearts with Jesus; like
many of her contemporary female
saints, Benedetta was the recipient
of Jesus's "sacred heart." Soon af
terward Jesus instructed Benedetta

to go on a restricted diet, assigned
a guardian angel to her named
Splenditello and commanded
Benedetta to make ready for their
marriage, which was to occur "a
week later, on the day of the Holy
Trinity." Jesus gave Benedetta
detailed instructins for the prepara
tions for the wedding and a list of all
the public figures he wanted pres
ent. During the ceremony Jesus
spoke to the assembled through
Benedetta, praising her greatly and
exhorting the other nuns to obey
her.
Benedetta's praise of herself
during this ceremony, her threats
of damnation for those who did not
believe in her mystical powers, her
request that public officials be pres
ent, and the lack of any tangible
evidence that a "ceremony" oc
curred, aroused suspicion in her su
periors, and an investigation was
begun by local officials. The first
stage of this investigation revealed
nothing not already known about
Benedetta. She was questioned on
several occasions about her stig
mata, her visions and the mar
riage. Her wounds were examined
at each visit. Again, of most con
cern to her examiners was whether
or not her visions were divine or
evil.
At that time, the church had cer
tain "criteria" to which visionaries
had to conform. The visionary was
supposed to be humble, not seeking
to have visions; the visions had to
be real visions, rather than dreams
or "ecstasies"; her visions had to

conform to orthodox Catholic
doctrine; and visions had to "give
rise to greater humility and the
realization that the gifts God be
stowed on the soul were not the
result of its own merits but a free
gift of God." Benedetta's inves
tigators concluded that she met all
these requirements, although on
the last item she barely squeaked
by.
Her examiners also spoke with
the acting abbess during Benedet
ta's investigation, Bartholomea and
several other nuns. These women
confirmed Benedetta's claims about
her visions. Following this investi
gation, Benedetta was reinstated as
abbess.
It is unclear what prompted the
second investigation of Benedetta's
claims, which occurred three or
four years after the first. This time
her examiners were church offi
cials, and they decided Benedetta
did not in fact meet the criteria for
an authentic visionary or saint.
Indeed, it became apparent that she
was a fraud, that she had faked the
stigmata. The ring she claimed she
received from Jesus at their
"wedding" was also false.
While Benedetta might simply
have been excused as "misguided"
for faking her visions, her ex
aminers uncovered something else
they found damning — she was
having sex with her Bartholomea,
or rather her "guardian angel"
Splenditello acted through

Benedetta and forced Bartholomea
into sexual encounters with him.
Benedetta was removed from
her position as abbess and im
prisoned within the convent until
her death 35 years later. According
to Brown, it appears this harsh
punishment was served mostly be
cause she presented fraudulent
claims of mysticism and sainthood,
and only in part because of her
homosexual relationship.
For those readers who are not
familiar with the Renaissance or
with gay and lesbian history, Brown
provides 15 pages of introduction to
the history of lay and religious laws
and beliefs about homosexual male
and lesbian acts. While this discus
sion is necessary in order to under
stand the story as it unfolds, the
narrative would have run more
smoothly had this information been
incorporated into the text. Brown
also provides the reader with other
fairly lengthy historical information
within the text, such as information
regarding mysticism within the
Catholic church, the Theatine order
and prohibitions against women
preaching.
Brown attempts to give the

reader a psychological analysis of
Benedetta's behavior. I found this
analysis frequently simplistic and al
ways unsatisfying in that it left out
her homosexuality. Brown con
structed the narrative so that it told
Benedetta's story chronologically
as facts were recorded or discov
ered about her, not as they oc
curred. This choice of approach
prohibits Brown from fully discuss
ing the reasons for Benedetta's
trauma. This is a regrettable error
in construction.
After recounting Benedetta's
first vision, Brown states that "the
content of mystical experiences,
whether we view them as psycho
logical or divine revelations, or as
physiological responses to fasting,
disclose the mystic's deepest spiri
tual concerns. To understand the
messages revealed in Benedetta's
visions is therefore to understand
what was foremost in her mind." If
her visions are creations of the
mystic herself, then this is probably
true; if however, they are divine
revelations, then this may not be
the case. Disregarding the latter
possibility, the author sets herself
the task of understanding "the
messages revealed in Benedetta's
visions" and behavior.
Father Ricordati, Benedetta's
father confessor, advised her to

"repress the onset of visions and to
'pray to god that he send her
travails instead of ecstasies and
revelation.' " Commenting on
Benedetta's illness, during which
she was paralyzed by intense pains
over her entire body, especially at
night, Brown states that "the deep

was experiencing." While it is clear
she was suffering conflict, it seems
to me more probable that this
stemmed more from the conflict be
tween her nightly liasions with Bar
tolomea and her professed beliefs
and commitments, reinforced by
societal beliefs and censure.

sense of conflict between her nat
ural inclination to give in to her ec
static experiences and her desire to
follow the advice of her confessor
weighed heavily on her mind. . . .
Benedetta's malady was a physical
manifestation of the internal suffer
ing and the unresolved conflict she

In one of her visions, Benedetta
was ordered by Jesus "not to eat
meat, eggs and milk products and
not to drink anything but water."
This left her with a very restricted
diet, akin to fasting. Brown main
tains that Benedetta's fasting
"reflected a deeply seated am

bivalence towards the physical
aspect of her feminine self. By fas
ting she not only rejected the whole
realm of food preparation and con
sumption traditionally associated
with women, but she cleansed her
body of the impurities of the female
sex ... it had been observed by
physicians and theologians that fas
ting curtailed menustration." While
this may be one of the reasons that
Benedetta fasted, I find this analy
sis too general.
If her fasting was "a troubled and
negative act," as Brown claims,
then the trouble it reflected is more
likely the aforementioned conflict
between her homosexuality and her
professed values. She was already
not behaving as a feminine woman
(according to society's standards)
by virtue of her relationship with
Bartolomea. Her visions of beauti
ful young men who tried to seduce
her and then beat her, her claim
that she was "in love with" and par
ticipated in a marriage with Jesus,
and that she was punished by
Splenditello for her misdeeds, point
to the intense difficulty she had in
resolving the issue of her sexuality.
Bartolomea claimed it was Splen
ditello, speaking through
Benedetta, who forced her to com
mit sexual acts with the body of
Benedetta. And Benedetta never

admitted to engaging in homosexual
acts; it was only in the guise of a
male angel that she did so, never
simply as herself.
Brown does place Benedetta
Carlini's story in a firm historical
context, providing ample back
ground information about the per
iod. However, although the book's
subtitle is "The Life of a Lesbian
Nun in Renaisance Italy,"
Benedetta's homosexual feelings
and relationship — and their conse
quences in emotional terms — are
hardly discussed, even when
"Immodest Acts" looks at
Benedetta's expressions of conflict
and emotional pain. Indeed,
Brown's discussion of the discovery
of Benedetta and Bartolomea's re
lationship is surprisingly brief. In
stead, Brown's work (as well as
Benedetta's contemporaries'), em
phasizes the nun's failed bid for im
mortality. While "Immodest Acts"
is important to gay and lesbian his
tory, it is more important for its
portrayal of a confused and troubled
nun's attempt at sainthood.
Brown's book is certainly well
researched and well-written, and if
one is not looking for just what the
book advertises, it could be a sat
sifying read. "Immodest Acts"
merely needs another title and a
little more insight.
"Immodest Acts: The Life of a
Lesbian Nun in Renaissance
Italy"
Dr. Judith Brown
Oxford University Press, 1986
I was fascinated by Rosemary
Curb and Nancy Manahan's recent
book, "Lesbian Nuns," writings by
and interviews with lesbians who
are or were nuns, and was eager to
read Dr. Judith Brown's latest
book, "Immodest Acts: The Life of
a Lesbian Nun In Renaissance
Italy." I expected it to be the his
torical counterpart to "Lesbian
Nuns."
Brown's book, however, is quite
different. She does give as much in
formation as can be discerned about
about an Italian nun who had a
homosexual relationship with a fel
low nun. "Immodest Acts,"
however, is more the story of this
nun's bid for sainthood and of the
political, religious and social context
in which she tried and failed to
achieve this status.
Benedetta Carletta was born in
1590 in a small town in the moun
tains of Italy. After surviving a diffi
cult birth, she was named "blessed"
in Italian and dedicated to God.
During her childhood, Benedetta
received signs from God that she
Was precious to him. Birds sang at
her command, and at nine, having
joined the Theatine nuns, she saw a
statue of the Virgin Mary nod at

her. Another time, the entire
statue leaned over the railing of its
enclosure toward her.
At age 23, Benedetta began
having visions that offered her spiri
tual guidance. At first, her mother
superior and father confessor at the
Theatine home were concerned
with whether or not Benedetta's vi
sions came from God or the devil.
Visions in general were beginning
to be looked at dubiously; despite
their theological grounding and
pedagogical value, they remained
outside the sacramental structure
of the Catholic church.
Her father confessor urged
Benedetta to try to stop or avoid
her visions and to pray for
"travails." Benedetta did, and was
rewarded with "such intense pains
. . . that she was often paralyzed
by them," and for which her doc
tors could find no cause. This was
the sign Benedetta needed to cer
tify that her visions were divine.
Two years later her visions
began again. This time, however,
"instead of encounters with Jesus
and with benevolent angles, she
now was pursued at night by
handsome young men who wanted
to kill her and who beat her all over
with iron chains. . . . The attacks
took place several times a week
after going to bed and lasted for six
to eight hours." As she was in great
pain during these attacks, another
nun, Batholomea Crivelli, was as
signed to watch her at night.
During these nightly sessions,
Bartholomea witnessed Benedetta

receiving stigmata. The blessing of
stigmata on Benedetta brought
status to her order and to the nun
herself. Shortly thereafter she was
elected abbess. While in trance she
was allowed to preach to her
sisters, something usually ab
solutely forbidden to women; she

was allowed to do so only because
God spoke through her.
Her next vision involved an ex

tions for the wedding and a list of all
the public figures he wanted pres

of damnation for those who did not

that she was "in love with" and par
ticipated in a marriage with Jesus,
and that she was punished by
Splenditello for her misdeeds, point
to the intense difficulty she had in
resolving the issue of her sexuality.
Bartolomea claimed it was Splen
ditello, speaking through
Benedetta, who forced her to com
mit sexual acts with the body of
Benedetta. And Benedetta never

admitted to engaging in homosexual
acts; it was only in the guise of a
male angel that she did so, never
simply as herself.
Brown does place Benedetta
Carlini's story in a firm historical
context, providing ample back
ground information about the per
iod. However, although the book's
subtitle is "The Life of a Lesbian
Nun in Renaisance Italy,"
Benedetta's homosexual feelings
and relationship — and their conse
quences in emotional terms — are
hardly discussed, even when
"Immodest Acts" looks at
Benedetta's expressions of conflict
and emotional pain. Indeed,
Brown's discussion of the discovery
of Benedetta and Bartolomea's re
lationship is surprisingly brief. In
stead, Brown's work (as well as
Benedetta's contemporaries'), em
phasizes the nun's failed bid for im
mortality. While "Immodest Acts"
is important to gay and lesbian his
tory, it is more important for its
portrayal of a confused and troubled
nun's attempt at sainthood.
Brown's book is certainly well
researched and well-written, and if
one is not looking for just what the
book advertises, it could be a sat
sifying read. "Immodest Acts"
merely needs another title and a
little more insight.
