After failing an earlier inspection, the Stan
ford Hospital won approval from a county
review committee Monday to become one of
three trauma centers for Santa Clara County.
County and hospital officials will now begin
contract negotiations. The center is expected
to open next year.
Stanford joins San Jose Hospital and Santa
Clara County Medical Center as sites ap
proved for the treatment of an estimated
1,300 severe-injury victims a year.

equipment for the treatment of extreme
trauma are not always available. County Su
pervisor Diane McKenna has said the es

county."
Dr. Michael Eliastam, associate professor

of medicine and surgery at Stanford and co
ordinator of Stanford's trauma program, said

officials laid to rest perceptions about the sys

in September. Particularly, officials clarified
to the four inspectors that the trauma service
is to be a part of the Surgery Department,
Eliastam said. He said the September visit
had left the committee with the erroneous
impression that an injured victim would first
be seen by a non-surgical emergency
physician.
Eliastam said the establishment of a Stan
ford trauma center orients the hospital more
toward patients and demonstrates the hospi
tal's commitment to the local and regional
communities.
Each of the new centers will be staffed 24
hours a day by a surgeon, an anes
thesiologist, an emergency room physician, a
radiology technician, a blood bank represen
