Jane and I decided to meet at the
Oval Friday at noon. We were going
to celebrate her birthday by indulg
ing ourselves in mounds of pasta
and other deli delights, which is ex
actly what we did.
Just a quick bike ride to down
town Palo Alto, the Fratelli Deli is
one of the better delis I've been to
while at Stanford. I love Italian
food, and consider myself some
what of an expert on pasta and Ital
ian food in general. Also, Jane is

one of the best cooks I know. Be
tween the two of us, the Cirimele
brothers, who own the Fratelli
Deli, had a difficult duo of dis
criminating palates to please.
As we walked into the Fratelli
Deli, all tables were full of busily
munching Palo Altans. One was
eating a meatball sandwich, which
looked mighty tasty. Another was
taking advantage of the all-you-can
eat salad bar. Right away, we
noticed that the atmosphere was
pleasant and had a surprisingly spa
cious feel for a rather small es
tablishment. There was even a
stack of magazines and newspapers
to browse over for those eating
alone. All the tables had fresh
flowers. These and the non
fumare (no-smoking) sign, along
with the patrons who obeyed this
message, made the atmosphere all
the more pleasant for what it did not

contain.
We noticed a wide selection of
gourmet items for takeout orders.
Everything from fine Progresso
soups and sauces to Nutella, a sin
fully delicious chocolate-hazelnut
spread that Italian mothers give to
their bambini on special occasions.
Also, the Fratelli Deli carries a wide
variety of imported Italian wines at
reasonable prices, many of which
are difficult to find in this area. Fi
nally, the Fratelli Deli offers cater
ing services. A pre-prepared
sample tray of hors d'oeuvres
looked good. If you need a special
cheese, like mushroom brie, or
gourmet meat, they probably have
it. I was amazed at their selection.
Jane and I proceeded to the
counter and selected our beverages
out of the refrigerated showcase. I
was happy to see Birra Raffo, an
Italian beer for those of you who

like to try something new. The case
also contained several types of wine
to choose from, which was tempt
ing indeed. However, we had
decided to keep a clear head (for
once), so we selected a bottle of
fresh orange juice for me and a
Calistoga for Jane.
The sandwich counter was very
busy. We grabbed a number and
were promptly assisted by an eager
employee. We asked for sugges
tions and decided to try many
items. The Fratelli Deli serves all
sorts of vegetarian meat
specialty sandwiches (such as the
Italian combo, the Fratelli forte,
etc.), which are all about $3. They
also have chicken and ribs, an all
you-can-eat salad bar, soup, chili
and specialty salads. Personally, I
was impressed with the prices: one
can easily have a filling lunch or
late-afternoon snack for under $5.

(How much is McDonald's these
days?)
Jane and I tasted the vegetarian
lasagne first. The lasagna comes
with garlic bread for $3.99, or $2
for a half order. It was so good that
when I go back to Fratelli Deli,
that's what I'm going to have. The
lasagne was a perfect blend of fresh
pasta, cheeses, cream sauce and

vegetables (bits of broccoli, spinach
and julienne carrots for visual aes
thetics). I'd never had lasagna quite
like it before.
Next, we sampled some ravioli
alfredo. They were good, but not
quite hot enough. The ravioli was
made with fresh pasta and stuffed

with ricotta cheese. It had just the
right amount of delicious cream
sauce. The ravioli did not come
with any bread and was $3.99 or $2
for a half order.
We tasted two specialty salads
that day: the regular pasta salad and
the pesto pasta salad. We both
preferred the regular pasta salad. It
was tangy with a spicy vinagrette
Italian dressing. The pesto salad
was a bit bland; the basil didn't
seem to come through the way it
should have. Still, this milder taste
may appeal to some. Both salads
were prepared with curly pasta
noodles, peas, carrots and broccoli.
As I mentioned before, the prices
for the salads were extremely
reasonable.

Finally, we nibbled on a spinach
cheese piroshki. This was terribly
tasty. It was a bit salty, though.
Jane speculated that perhaps
canned spinach, which is often
salty, had been used. We did notice
that the piroshki had plenty of
spinach and just the right amount of
cheese — not too much. It was
good and priced at around $2.
We were really stuffed at this
point, so we avoided dessert. Of
course, the Fratelli Deli has a wide
dessert selection: cookies, cakes,
brownies, blondies and Italian
cookies. While we were eating, one
of the Crimele brothers brought
Jane and me some Amarettini,
which are little amaretto cookies. If
you get these, save the paper they
come in because if you smooth it
out and roll it up tightly like some
people roll those illegal little

cigarettes — into a tight cylinder —
then stand it on one end and light
the top with a match, being careful
that it doesn't fall over, something
amazing happens. I won't tell you
what, but, whatever you do, don't
do this in the deli. Wait until you get
home, because no smoking is
allowed inside, and that includes
cookie papers!
Overall, I would give the Fratelli
Deli a rating of "very good." Try it
next time you are downtown. The
place would be on the verge of ex
cellence if the Cirimele brothers
served espresso coffee. A good cup
of steaming espresso would have
been the perfect topper for a relax
ing lunch with great company. So
Gary, Rickey and Jim: Keep up the
good work and consider adding
some Italian cafe to your Italian
cafe.
