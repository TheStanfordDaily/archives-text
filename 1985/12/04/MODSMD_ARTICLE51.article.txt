# Jan's Deli Falls Short of NYC

### BARBARA SAUNDERS 
Jan's Manhatten West
2420 Bryant
Palo Alto
325-2300
When I walked into Jan's Man
hatten West with my friend
Laurie, I saw some resemblance
to a New York City delicatessen.
The hanging meats, the over
whelming desserts displayed near
the door, all reminded me of the
Manhatten delis I grew up with.
However, the red, white and
black sparkling-clean decor was a
dead giveaway that Jan's is indeed
in Palo Alto.
Laurie and I were seated by a
friendly hostess and served water
and dishes of coleslaw that were
light and appetizing. The food se
lection at Jan's is extremely
varied: sandwiches, including a
New York-style Reuben, soups,
salads, bagel platters and
burgers.
We began our meal with ap
petizers. The stuffed cabbage
was excellent, filled with beef and
barley and served with a tomato
and w/ne sauce.
Fcr entrees, I chose the bris
ket of beef (recommended by the
waitress), and Laurie had South

ern-fried chicken. Each entree
was served with potato pancakes,
apple sauce and sour cream. Our
entrees were somewhat disap
pointing. The beef, although
served in a very good mushroom
gravy, was fatty, and the chicken
was dry. The potato pancakes,
however, were wonderful.
Dessert was the high point of
our meal. It was difficult to
choose between the dozens of
pastries and cakes available, but
we finally chose the cheesecake
and the mocha torte, with the
cappuccino to accompany. The
desserts were both rich and the
cheesecake was especially

creamy. The cappuccino was
quite good.
Overall, Jan's Manhatten West
is a good restaurant. The service
and atmosphere are both excel
lent. I would not recommend
Jan's for students, however, as it
is quite expensive. Our check
was not exhorbitant: $42
(including appetizers, entrees,
wines, dessert and coffee) for the
two of us. But for the same price
one could get a "formal" or
"elegant" meal somewhere else.
However, I do recommend Jan,'s
as a good place for an after-dinner
espresso in a very cheery atmos
phere.
