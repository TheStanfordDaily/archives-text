## Water Polo Nets a National Title 
### INGRID SEYER Staff writer 
The Stanford water polo team was not to
be denied in this year's NCAA Champion
ships.
No matter that the Cardinal trailed 6-2 in
the second half of the championship final or
that UC-Irvine scored with 13 seconds
remaining in regulation play to stake a com
manding 10-9 lead.
No, nothing was going to stop the Cardinal
from winning the NCAA title this year. Noth
ing was going to and nothing did.
Sunday night Stanford defeated UC-Irvine
12-11 in double overtime to capture the Card
inal's fifth NCAA title. En route to the final of
the single-elimination tournament, Stanford
defeated Bucknell 18-4 and UC-Santa Bar
bara 7-6. Irvine (23-8) captured victories
over Loyola-Chicago and UCLA before
placing second to the Cardinal (25-4).
As the score indicates, the final match be
tween the Cardinal and the Anteaters was ex
tremely close. According to Stanford Coach
Dante Dettamanti, the game wasn't just
close, it was exciting, challenging and nerve
racking.
"You couldn't have written a better script
for a championship final — this match had
everything," Dettamanti said. "The come
from-behind victory, the double overtimes,
the back-hand shots, the fastbreaks, the 6-
on-ss. . . every facet of water polo that there
is was seen in this final."
When Dettamanti said a "coine-from
behind victory" he was right on the mark.
Trailing by four goals at one point, Stanford
evened the score with a five-goal third quar
ter. That spurt put the Cardinal back into the
match.
Irvine started off strong, scoring the first
goal of the match. Stanford's Greg Gamble
evened the score later in the quarter with a
goal on a 6-5 Stanford advantage, but the An
teaters came back 18 seconds later to take
the lead.
The second quarter followed much the
same sequence as two Irvine scores
sandwiched a Stanford tally.
Entering the second half two goals behind,
Dettamanti was still pleased with his team's

performance.
"We were really outplaying Irvine, and we
were still in the game," Dettamanti said. "We
weren't able to get the ball in the goal like we
should have, but we got our offense set for
the second half."
Unfortunately, Irvine's offense proved to
more set than Stanford's. The Anteaters
began the third quarter with two quick goals,
putting them up by four.
"When Irvine opened up 6-2 lead we knew
we were in trouble," Dettamanti said. "It is
one thing to trail by four in the first quarter,
but in the tliird quarter you don't have that
much time left to work with."
For the Cardinal, the third quarter proved
to be time enough. Stanford rallied for a five
goal quarter with goals by Gamble, Craig
Klass, Jaime Velez and David Imbernino (2).
Imbernino's 6-5 goal with 1:54 remaining
evened the score at seven.
"When Irvine came out into the third quar
ter and scored the next two goals, things
were looking pretty bleak," Junior Craig
Klass said. "Luckily, seven-minute quarters
give you a lot of chances to score and we
were able to take advantage of that."
Irvine once again took the lead late in the
fourth quarter, but Imbernino quickly replied
with a goal, followed by another Irvine goal,
putting the score at 9-8.
"Irvine's 9-8 lead was a very critical point
for us," Dettamanti said. "With only 2:19
remaining, we didn't have too much time to
take over the match."
As it turned out, the two minutes remain
ing proved to be enough time for three goals,
two of them Stanford's. With 33 seconds
remaining, Klass scored on a 6-5 with an as
sist from Matt Tingler to even the score at
nine. But Irvine came right down and scored
as All-America National Team member Jeff
Campbell shot with 13 seconds remaining
eluded Stanford goalie Todd Kemp.
Both teams then lined up at half-court, and
the clock started. Stanford's Gamble was able
to draw a quick foul to stop the clock, allow
ing the Cardinal to set up its front-court of
fense. While Imbernino and Velez ran a
screen on one side, drawing the defense to
their side, Tingler was able to take advantage

of his position and scored with five
seconds remaining with a left-side
lob.
"With five seconds remaining
most players would go for a hard
drive shot, but Tingler had the
presence of mind to take a look at
the goalie and play off of him," Det
tamanti said. "To take a lob shot
like that in a championship game is
really gutsy, but Matt has the guts
to do it."
Once the game went into
overtime, Stanford really put on the
power. As Dettamanti said, "the
overtimes were to our advantage
because we were in better shape
and had more depth to pull from the
bench."
Although both teams had chances
to score, the first overtime went
scoreless. Stanford took the lead
for the first time during the match
23 seconds into the second
overtime period with a shot out of
the hole by Klass. Irvine rebounded
15 seconds later with a goal of their
own, evening the score at 11.
Tingler scored the winning goal
for the Cardinal with a little under a
minute remaining, assisted by
Klass.
Although Irvine's J.R. Salvatore
was able to put a shot in the goal
with 13 seconds remaining, an of
fensive foul was called and the goal
was disallowed, handing Stanford
the victory it had long been waiting
for.

"This title is my fourth but if is by
far the most satisfying for me,"
Dettamanti said. "The guys on the
team won this title not only on tal
ent, but on teamwork, per
severance and hard work. It was
basically this team, with the excep
tion of the freshmen and sopho
mores, that as freshmen had
Stanford's first losing season. To
come up from that to a second
place finish last year and a champi
onship this year is quite a feat.
"As I've said all season, this is
our year," Dettamanti said. "Our
team wanted the title, we worked
for it and we won it. Even when we
were down by four in the final, we
remained positive. I couldn't be
happier for our team, they deserve
it more than any team I've had."
Although the team isn't one to
blow its own horn, the players were
happier after their victory than
most of them have ever been.
"Winning the championship has
got to be the definition of the word
happiness," Klass said. "The final
was by far the most exciting game I
have ever played. Even though we
were behind several times, we just
kept coming after it."
"You can't really say in words
what it means to win an NCAA
title," senior Velez said. "The final
was my last game and I really
wanted to win it, for myself and for
the team. I was able to finish my
career the way I wanted to — with
a victory.
"I think the way we won the championship
shows what kind of team we are. We were
behind 6-2 at one point, but we never gave
up. We came back and won it all. We just kept
fighting. We lost it last year by one goal, and
we knew we didn't want to do it again."
Velez wasn't the only one with last year's
loss on his mind.
"Before the game we all said there was no
way we were going to lose the final two years

in a row," Klass said. "We were definitely set
on victory."
Kemp was named to the All-Tournament
second team, along with Velez. Imbernino
shared Co-MVP honors with Irvine's Jeff
Campbell. Klass was named to the first team,
along with Irvine's Salvatore and Mark Maizel
(goalie), UCLA's Fernando Carasalada, Long
Beach's Phil Castillo and Santa Barbara's John
Anderson.
In the battle for third place, UCLA
defeated Santa Barbara 10-9, while Long
Beach defeated Brown 13-9 to capture fifth
place.

the victory it had long been waiting
for.

"This title is my fourth but if is by
far the most satisfying for me,"
Dettamanti said. "The guys on the
team won this title not only on tal
ent, but on teamwork, per
severance and hard work. It was
basically this team, with the excep
tion of the freshmen and sopho
mores, that as freshmen had
Stanford's first losing season. To
come up from that to a second
place finish last year and a champi
onship this year is quite a feat.
"As I've said all season, this is
our year," Dettamanti said. "Our
team wanted the title, we worked
for it and we won it. Even when we
were down by four in the final, we
remained positive. I couldn't be
happier for our team, they deserve
it more than any team I've had."
Although the team isn't one to
blow its own horn, the players were
happier after their victory than
most of them have ever been.
"Winning the championship has
got to be the definition of the word
happiness," Klass said. "The final
was by far the most exciting game I
have ever played. Even though we
were behind several times, we just
kept coming after it."
"You can't really say in words
what it means to win an NCAA
title," senior Velez said. "The final
was my last game and I really
wanted to win it, for myself and for
the team. I was able to finish my
career the way I wanted to — with
a victory.
"I think the way we won the championship
shows what kind of team we are. We were
behind 6-2 at one point, but we never gave
up. We came back and won it all. We just kept
fighting. We lost it last year by one goal, and
we knew we didn't want to do it again."
Velez wasn't the only one with last year's
loss on his mind.
"Before the game we all said there was no
way we were going to lose the final two years

in a row," Klass said. "We were definitely set
on victory."
Kemp was named to the All-Tournament
second team, along with Velez. Imbernino
shared Co-MVP honors with Irvine's Jeff
Campbell. Klass was named to the first team,
along with Irvine's Salvatore and Mark Maizel
(goalie), UCLA's Fernando Carasalada, Long
Beach's Phil Castillo and Santa Barbara's John
Anderson.
In the battle for third place, UCLA
defeated Santa Barbara 10-9, while Long
Beach defeated Brown 13-9 to capture fifth
place.
The Stanford water polo team was not to
be denied in this year's NCAA Champion
ships.
No matter that the Cardinal trailed 6-2 in
the second half of the championship final or
that UC-Irvine scored with 13 seconds
remaining in regulation play to stake a com
manding 10-9 lead.
No, nothing was going to stop the Cardinal
from winning the NCAA title this year. Noth
ing was going to and nothing did.
Sunday night Stanford defeated UC-Irvine
12-11 in double overtime to capture the Card
inal's fifth NCAA title. En route to the final of
the single-elimination tournament, Stanford
defeated Bucknell 18-4 and UC-Santa Bar
bara 7-6. Irvine (23-8) captured victories
over Loyola-Chicago and UCLA before
placing second to the Cardinal (25-4).
As the score indicates, the final match be
tween the Cardinal and the Anteaters was ex
tremely close. According to Stanford Coach
Dante Dettamanti, the game wasn't just
close, it was exciting, challenging and nerve
racking.
"You couldn't have written a better script
for a championship final — this match had
everything," Dettamanti said. "The come
from-behind victory, the double overtimes,
the back-hand shots, the fastbreaks, the 6-
on-ss. . . every facet of water polo that there
is was seen in this final."
When Dettamanti said a "coine-from
behind victory" he was right on the mark.
Trailing by four goals at one point, Stanford
evened the score with a five-goal third quar
ter. That spurt put the Cardinal back into the
match.
Irvine started off strong, scoring the first
goal of the match. Stanford's Greg Gamble
evened the score later in the quarter with a
goal on a 6-5 Stanford advantage, but the An
teaters came back 18 seconds later to take
the lead.
The second quarter followed much the
same sequence as two Irvine scores
sandwiched a Stanford tally.
Entering the second half two goals behind,
Dettamanti was still pleased with his team's

performance.
"We were really outplaying Irvine, and we
were still in the game," Dettamanti said. "We
weren't able to get the ball in the goal like we
should have, but we got our offense set for
the second half."
Unfortunately, Irvine's offense proved to
more set than Stanford's. The Anteaters
began the third quarter with two quick goals,
putting them up by four.
"When Irvine opened up 6-2 lead we knew
we were in trouble," Dettamanti said. "It is
one thing to trail by four in the first quarter,
but in the tliird quarter you don't have that
much time left to work with."
For the Cardinal, the third quarter proved
to be time enough. Stanford rallied for a five
goal quarter with goals by Gamble, Craig
Klass, Jaime Velez and David Imbernino (2).
Imbernino's 6-5 goal with 1:54 remaining
evened the score at seven.
"When Irvine came out into the third quar
ter and scored the next two goals, things
were looking pretty bleak," Junior Craig
Klass said. "Luckily, seven-minute quarters
give you a lot of chances to score and we
were able to take advantage of that."
Irvine once again took the lead late in the
fourth quarter, but Imbernino quickly replied
with a goal, followed by another Irvine goal,
putting the score at 9-8.
"Irvine's 9-8 lead was a very critical point
for us," Dettamanti said. "With only 2:19
remaining, we didn't have too much time to
take over the match."
As it turned out, the two minutes remain
ing proved to be enough time for three goals,
two of them Stanford's. With 33 seconds
remaining, Klass scored on a 6-5 with an as
sist from Matt Tingler to even the score at
nine. But Irvine came right down and scored
as All-America National Team member Jeff
Campbell shot with 13 seconds remaining
eluded Stanford goalie Todd Kemp.
Both teams then lined up at half-court, and
the clock started. Stanford's Gamble was able
to draw a quick foul to stop the clock, allow
ing the Cardinal to set up its front-court of
fense. While Imbernino and Velez ran a
screen on one side, drawing the defense to
their side, Tingler was able to take advantage

of his position and scored with five
seconds remaining with a left-side
lob.
"With five seconds remaining
most players would go for a hard
drive shot, but Tingler had the
presence of mind to take a look at
the goalie and play off of him," Det
tamanti said. "To take a lob shot
like that in a championship game is
really gutsy, but Matt has the guts
to do it."
Once the game went into
overtime, Stanford really put on the
power. As Dettamanti said, "the
overtimes were to our advantage
because we were in better shape
and had more depth to pull from the
bench."
Although both teams had chances
to score, the first overtime went
scoreless. Stanford took the lead
for the first time during the match
23 seconds into the second
overtime period with a shot out of
the hole by Klass. Irvine rebounded
15 seconds later with a goal of their
own, evening the score at 11.
Tingler scored the winning goal
for the Cardinal with a little under a
minute remaining, assisted by
Klass.
Although Irvine's J.R. Salvatore
was able to put a shot in the goal
with 13 seconds remaining, an of
fensive foul was called and the goal
was disallowed, handing Stanford
the victory it had long been waiting
for.

Klass said. "Luckily, seven-minute quarters
give you a lot of chances to score and we
were able to take advantage of that."
Irvine once again took the lead late in the
fourth quarter, but Imbernino quickly replied
with a goal, followed by another Irvine goal,
putting the score at 9-8.
"Irvine's 9-8 lead was a very critical point
for us," Dettamanti said. "With only 2:19
remaining, we didn't have too much time to
take over the match."
As it turned out, the two minutes remain
ing proved to be enough time for three goals,
two of them Stanford's. With 33 seconds
remaining, Klass scored on a 6-5 with an as
sist from Matt Tingler to even the score at
nine. But Irvine came right down and scored
as All-America National Team member Jeff
Campbell shot with 13 seconds remaining
eluded Stanford goalie Todd Kemp.
Both teams then lined up at half-court, and
the clock started. Stanford's Gamble was able
to draw a quick foul to stop the clock, allow

of his position and scored with five
seconds remaining with a left-side
lob.
"With five seconds remaining
most players would go for a hard
drive shot, but Tingler had the
presence of mind to take a look at
the goalie and play off of him," Det
tamanti said. "To take a lob shot
like that in a championship game is
really gutsy, but Matt has the guts
to do it."
Once the game went into
overtime, Stanford really put on the
power. As Dettamanti said, "the
overtimes were to our advantage
because we were in better shape
and had more depth to pull from the
bench."
Although both teams had chances
to score, the first overtime went
scoreless. Stanford took the lead
for the first time during the match
23 seconds into the second
overtime period with a shot out of
the hole by Klass. Irvine rebounded
15 seconds later with a goal of their
own, evening the score at 11.
Tingler scored the winning goal
for the Cardinal with a little under a
minute remaining, assisted by
Klass.
Although Irvine's J.R. Salvatore
was able to put a shot in the goal
with 13 seconds remaining, an of
fensive foul was called and the goal
was disallowed, handing Stanford
the victory it had long been waiting
for.

"This title is my fourth but if is by
far the most satisfying for me,"
Dettamanti said. "The guys on the
team won this title not only on tal
ent, but on teamwork, per
severance and hard work. It was
basically this team, with the excep
tion of the freshmen and sopho
mores, that as freshmen had
Stanford's first losing season. To
come up from that to a second
place finish last year and a champi
onship this year is quite a feat.
"As I've said all season, this is
our year," Dettamanti said. "Our
team wanted the title, we worked
for it and we won it. Even when we
were down by four in the final, we
remained positive. I couldn't be
happier for our team, they deserve
it more than any team I've had."
Although the team isn't one to
blow its own horn, the players were
happier after their victory than
most of them have ever been.
"Winning the championship has
got to be the definition of the word
happiness," Klass said. "The final
was by far the most exciting game I
have ever played. Even though we
were behind several times, we just
kept coming after it."
"You can't really say in words
what it means to win an NCAA
title," senior Velez said. "The final
was my last game and I really
wanted to win it, for myself and for
the team. I was able to finish my
career the way I wanted to — with
a victory.
"I think the way we won the championship
shows what kind of team we are. We were
behind 6-2 at one point, but we never gave
up. We came back and won it all. We just kept
fighting. We lost it last year by one goal, and
we knew we didn't want to do it again."
Velez wasn't the only one with last year's
loss on his mind.
"Before the game we all said there was no
way we were going to lose the final two years

in a row," Klass said. "We were definitely set
on victory."
Kemp was named to the All-Tournament
second team, along with Velez. Imbernino
shared Co-MVP honors with Irvine's Jeff
Campbell. Klass was named to the first team,
along with Irvine's Salvatore and Mark Maizel
(goalie), UCLA's Fernando Carasalada, Long
Beach's Phil Castillo and Santa Barbara's John
Anderson.
In the battle for third place, UCLA
defeated Santa Barbara 10-9, while Long
Beach defeated Brown 13-9 to capture fifth
place.
