## Water Polo Nets a National Title 
### INGRID SEYER Staff writer 
The Stanford water polo team was not to
be denied in this year's NCAA Champion
ships.
No matter that the Cardinal trailed 6-2 in
the second half of the championship final or
that UC-Irvine scored with 13 seconds
remaining in regulation play to stake a com
manding 10-9 lead.
No, nothing was going to stop the Cardinal
from winning the NCAA title this year. Noth
ing was going to and nothing did.
Sunday night Stanford defeated UC-Irvine
12-11 in double overtime to capture the Card
inal's fifth NCAA title. En route to the final of
the single-elimination tournament, Stanford
defeated Bucknell 18-4 and UC-Santa Bar
bara 7-6. Irvine (23-8) captured victories
over Loyola-Chicago and UCLA before
placing second to the Cardinal (25-4).
As the score indicates, the final match be
tween the Cardinal and the Anteaters was ex
tremely close. According to Stanford Coach
Dante Dettamanti, the game wasn't just
close, it was exciting, challenging and nerve
racking.
"You couldn't have written a better script
for a championship final â€” this match had
everything," Dettamanti said. "The come
from-behind victory, the double overtimes,
the back-hand shots, the fastbreaks, the 6-
on-ss. . . every facet of water polo that there
is was seen in this final."
When Dettamanti said a "coine-from
behind victory" he was right on the mark.
Trailing by four goals at one point, Stanford
evened the score with a five-goal third quar
ter. That spurt put the Cardinal back into the
match.
Irvine started off strong, scoring the first
goal of the match. Stanford's Greg Gamble
evened the score later in the quarter with a
goal on a 6-5 Stanford advantage, but the An
teaters came back 18 seconds later to take
the lead.
The second quarter followed much the
same sequence as two Irvine scores
sandwiched a Stanford tally.
Entering the second half two goals behind,
Dettamanti was still pleased with his team's

performance.
"We were really outplaying Irvine, and we
were still in the game," Dettamanti said. "We
weren't able to get the ball in the goal like we
should have, but we got our offense set for
the second half."
Unfortunately, Irvine's offense proved to
more set than Stanford's. The Anteaters
began the third quarter with two quick goals,
putting them up by four.
"When Irvine opened up 6-2 lead we knew
we were in trouble," Dettamanti said. "It is
one thing to trail by four in the first quarter,
but in the tliird quarter you don't have that
much time left to work with."
For the Cardinal, the third quarter proved
to be time enough. Stanford rallied for a five
goal quarter with goals by Gamble, Craig
Klass, Jaime Velez and David Imbernino (2).
Imbernino's 6-5 goal with 1:54 remaining
evened the score at seven.
"When Irvine came out into the third quar
ter and scored the next two goals, things
were looking pretty bleak," Junior Craig
Klass said. "Luckily, seven-minute quarters
give you a lot of chances to score and we
were able to take advantage of that."
Irvine once again took the lead late in the
fourth quarter, but Imbernino quickly replied
with a goal, followed by another Irvine goal,
putting the score at 9-8.
"Irvine's 9-8 lead was a very critical point
for us," Dettamanti said. "With only 2:19
remaining, we didn't have too much time to
take over the match."
As it turned out, the two minutes remain
ing proved to be enough time for three goals,
two of them Stanford's. With 33 seconds
remaining, Klass scored on a 6-5 with an as
sist from Matt Tingler to even the score at
nine. But Irvine came right down and scored
as All-America National Team member Jeff
Campbell shot with 13 seconds remaining
eluded Stanford goalie Todd Kemp.
Both teams then lined up at half-court, and
the clock started. Stanford's Gamble was able
to draw a quick foul to stop the clock, allow
ing the Cardinal to set up its front-court of
fense. While Imbernino and Velez ran a
screen on one side, drawing the defense to
their side, Tingler was able to take advantage

Freshman goalie Obi Greenman saw action in Friday's tough matches against UC-Santa Barbara and UC
-18-4 thrashing of Bucknell, but when it came time for Irvine, Todd Kemp was in the Cardinal net.
