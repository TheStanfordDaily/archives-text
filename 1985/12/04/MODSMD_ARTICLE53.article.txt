Having completed its most
successful regular season last

women's volleyball team has
been selected to host the West
Regional of the NCAA playoffs
Dec. 14 and 15.
The Cardinal knocked off
Hawaii twice in Honolulu Nov.
26 and 27 to finish the regular
season at 25-2. The victories en
abled Stanford to move past the
University of the Pacific in the
final national rankings. Pacific
had been No. 1 prior to its loss
to Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo.
The Cardinal struggled at

Hawaii but played well enough to
defeat the Wahines for the first
two times ever on the Pacific is
lands.
"We didn't play great, but we
played well when we had to,"
Cardinal Co-coach Don Shaw
said. "It's good to come home
with two victories. We've never
been able to win in Hawaii."
Stanford was on the verge of
sweeping Hawaii in the first
match, having won the first two
games, 15-6 and 15-13. But the
Cardinal lost a lead in game three
and was forced to go to a fourth
game for the victory.
"The third game we had a lead
and should have closed them
