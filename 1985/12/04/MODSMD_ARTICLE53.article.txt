# Card Sweeps Pair on Island
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
Having completed its most
successful regular season last
week, the No. 1-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team has
been selected to host the West
Regional of the NCAA playoffs
Dec. 14 and 15.
The Cardinal knocked off
Hawaii twice in Honolulu Nov.
26 and 27 to finish the regular
season at 25-2. The victories en
abled Stanford to move past the
University of the Pacific in the
final national rankings. Pacific
had been No. 1 prior to its loss
to Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo.
The Cardinal struggled at

Hawaii but played well enough to
defeat the Wahines for the first
two times ever on the Pacific is
lands.
"We didn't play great, but we
played well when we had to,"
Cardinal Co-coach Don Shaw
said. "It's good to come home
with two victories. We've never
been able to win in Hawaii."
Stanford was on the verge of
sweeping Hawaii in the first
match, having won the first two
games, 15-6 and 15-13. But the
Cardinal lost a lead in game three
and was forced to go to a fourth
game for the victory.
"The third game we had a lead
and should have closed them
out, but we didn't," Shaw said. "The
fourth game was a blowout (15-4),
though."
The following night Stanford proved
one of the reasons why it is the top
ranked college team. Trailing two games
to one, the Cardinal rallied to capture the
season finale.
Hawaii held leads of 6-1 and 9-4 in the
fourth game, but Stanford battled back to
knot the match with a 15-12 win. Game
five was a 15-5 cakewalk for the Cardinal.
Senior Kim Oden played well in Hawaii,
according to Shaw. But, in general, the
Cardinal lacked strong individual perfor
mances.
"It's tough to play over there (in
Hawaii) with the weather and travel,"
Shaw explained. "And the players were
not 100 percent physically."
Stanford will be tested early in the
playoffs at Maples Pavilion. The Cardinal
will open Dec. 14 at 3:30 p.m. against the
winner of the Arizona State-Arizona
match to be played this Saturday in Tuc
son.
The Sun Devils handed the Cardinal
one of its two losses this season, upset
ting the top-ranked team on Oct. 18 in
Tempe with the support of a standing
room-only crowd. The next afternoon,
Arizona made a bid for another upset of
the Cardinal before bowing in five games.
Stanford handled both the Sun Devils
and Wildcats easily in the second round of
the Pac-West season, however. The
Cardinal evened the series with ASU by
sweeping the Sun Devils — 15-4, 15-12,
15-7 — on Nov. 2 at Maples. Two weeks
later, Stanford knocked off Arizona in an
other three-game match.
Shaw indicated that either ASU or
Arizona would be a difficult first match for

Stanford. "It will be tough," Shaw said.
"But last year we had pretty solid teams
to play, also. It's never easy once you're
in the playoffs. There are 16 good teams
in the country."
The West Regional semi-final prior to
Stanford's match will feature the winners
of the Colorado State-Rhode Island and
Providence-Brigham Young matches
being played Dec. 6.
The Regional final will be played Sunday
at 5 p.m. Should BYU win its first match,
however, the final will be moved to Mon
day night at 7:30 to convenience the
Cougars, who prefer not to play on Sun
days for religious reasons.
The possibility of the final being played
on Monday worries Shaw, because the
NCAA Final Four is scheduled to begin
just four days later, on Dec. 20. "I wish
there was some way we could move it
(the Regional) up to Friday and Saturday,"
Shaw said.
Pacific, UCLA and USC are seeded
second, third and fourth, respectively, in
the championship tournament and will be
top seeds in the three other regionals.
Pacific, 31-3 overall this season, will
host the Northwest Regional and will open
against either Hawaii or San Diego State.
Should no upsets occur, the Tigers will
play Cal-Poly SLO for a Final Four berth.
The Mustangs upset Pacific just over a
week ago.
Defending champion UCLA will be the
top seed in the South Regional, hosted by
Texas. The Bruins were one of only two
teams to beat the Cardinal this season,
winning in four games in the semi-finals of
the Wendy's Classic Nov. 16 and 17.
The site of the Mideast Regional will
not be determined until the first round
playoffs conclude. USC, the top seed in
that region, finished the season at 23-8.
Despite the eight losses, though, the

Trojans are considered to be one of the
most talented teams in the country.
The winners of the respective regions
will gather in Kalamazoo, Mich., for the
Final Four Dec. 20-22. Should each of the
top seeds advance to Kalamazoo, the
Cardinal should be the favorite to win the
title, having compiled a 5-1 record this
season against Pacific, UCLA and USC.
A definite factor in the Cardinal's suc
cess this season has been the tremendous
support of the student body. Large
crowds cheered Stanford to its second
successive undefeated season at Maples.
Due to the timing of the West Regional,
however, many students will be on
airplanes flying home for the Christmas
break instead of packing the stands at
Maples to watch the playoffs.
"It will definitely hurt us," Shaw said.
"We're hoping that a few students stick
around — people (who) have followed us.
"I'd hate to see the students miss the
regional," he added. "They've been so
supportive all year. I wish I could put
them all up at my house."
With the conclusion of the regular
season, the Pac-West conference honored
its coaches and its best players. The
Cardinal's Oden received the confer
ence MVP, marking the third consecutive
year she had been so honored.
"I'm real happy that it worked out that
way," Shaw said. "I was afraid that after
being the MVP two years in a row, that if
she did not win it this year people would
think that she did not play as well."
Also recognized for the Cardinal were
Barbra Fontana and Wendi Rush on the
Pac-West second team and Nancy Reno
and Theresa Smith on the conference
honorable mention team.
Shaw and Fred Sturm were named Co
coaches of the Year for the second con
secutive season.
