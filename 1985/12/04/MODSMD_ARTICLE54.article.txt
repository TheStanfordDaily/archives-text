# Jackie Joseph: A Second Chance
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
In sports, many triumphs do not
come on the playing field, but are
more personal. Such is the case
with Jackie Joseph of the Stanford
women's tennis team.
Joseph, a senior from Philadel
phia, has almost completely
recovered from severe injuries suf
fered in 1984 that kept her on the
sidelines and off the tennis court for
a year.
After a protracted and often
frustrating rehabilitation program.
Joseph is now practicing with an
eye toward participating in col
legiate dual matches in February.
"I'm not quite 1(X) percent, but
I'm very close," Joseph said. "I feel
very good."
Joseph made an immediate im
pact when she first arrived at Stan
ford, starting most of her freshman
year. However, fierce competition
the next year and a curiosity about
life on the pro tour led to her deci
sion to stop out following fall quar
ter of her sonhomore vear.

"She wasn't going to play much
that year," Coach Frank Brennan
said, "so while she was feeling good
she decided to try her hand."
"I wanted to try the pro circuit
for an extended period of time,"
Joseph said, "and then come back
the next fall."
