# Jackie Joseph: A Second Chance
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
In sports, many triumphs do not
come on the playing field, but are
more personal. Such is the case
with Jackie Joseph of the Stanford
women's tennis team.
Joseph, a senior from Philadel
phia, has almost completely
recovered from severe injuries suf
fered in 1984 that kept her on the
sidelines and off the tennis court for
a year.
After a protracted and often
frustrating rehabilitation program.
Joseph is now practicing with an
eye toward participating in col
legiate dual matches in February.
"I'm not quite 1(X) percent, but
I'm very close," Joseph said. "I feel
very good."
Joseph made an immediate im
pact when she first arrived at Stan
ford, starting most of her freshman
year. However, fierce competition
the next year and a curiosity about
life on the pro tour led to her deci
sion to stop out following fall quar
ter of her sonhomore vear.

"She wasn't going to play much
that year," Coach Frank Brennan
said, "so while she was feeling good
she decided to try her hand."
"I wanted to try the pro circuit
for an extended period of time,"
Joseph said, "and then come back
the next fall."

Jackie Joseph had to rethink
her future after back injuries.
Right before her scheduled
return to the Farm, however,
Joseph suffered a herniated disk,
severe nerve damage and paralysis
of the right leg.
"The doctors are not really sure
why it happened," Joseph said. "I
had an operation — I was in the
hospital for a week. Then I was
home in bed for several months."
While she was at home, Joseph,
an economics major, tried to keep
up with her studies and maintain a
positive attitude.
"I arranged through my adviser
to work independently with my pro
fessors," she said. "I'm not sure if
I'll graduate in June — I may need
to go another quarter.
"It was a very tough experi
ence," she continued. "I had to look
at the good things to come out of it,
and hope that it would all work out
— which it has.
"I think the experience made me
appreciate everything a lot more,"
Joseph said. "It made me want to
take advantage of everything Stan
ford has to offer, and I hope to give
something back. I'm an advising as
sociate for freshmen."
"She's learned a lot for it besides
tennis," teammate Leigh Anne
Eldredge said. "She's enjoying
school a lot more than she did."
Joseph returned to school for the
spring quarter of 1984, and doctors
gave her the word to practice that
summer.

"(The injury) affected the mental
side of her game — this or that shot
hurting your back," Brennan said.
"It affects your concentration and
strategy.
"She's a good solid player," he
added. "The injury stunted her de
velopment as a tennis player, but
she's a great athlete and a solid
stroker."
"It's a great setback, but she
works hard," Eldredge said. "She
seems pretty determined to play
again. Even from last spring there's
a big improvement in her mobility."
The backing of her teammates
has played an important role in her
comeback, and Joseph values them
tremendously.
"They've all been very suppor
tive," she said. "Tennis is an indi
vidual sport, but there's a special
camaraderie among the girls."
"She definitely really cares about
the team," teammate Cari Hagey
said. "She does things other people
don't do. She goes out of her way
for team spirit even though she
hasn't been playing. That really
show's a lot."
Joseph is not only looking toward
playing again in February, but also
"hopes to play on the pro circuit
after graduation." Graduate school
is also a definite possibility.
"She loves the pro circuit,"
Brennan said. "She loves to travel;
she loves tennis. She'll probably try
to play more."
"The injury made me appreciate
being able to play a lot more,"
Joseph said. "I appreciate having
the second chance."
