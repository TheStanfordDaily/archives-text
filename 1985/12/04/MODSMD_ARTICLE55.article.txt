# Cagers Overmatch Tritons
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Put this one in with other great
mismatches in history. The Red
Army rolling through Lithuania.
Ronald Reagan over Walter
Mondale. William Perry against a
170-pound cornerback. And, to
beat an overused metaphor to a
well-deserved death, the Lions
over the Christians (before they
beat the Jets Thursday).
It was Stanford, a Division I team
on the upswing, against UC-San
Diego, a Division 111 team flounder
ing in mediocrity among the small
schools of this land. And when it
was over, the Cardinal strolled
away with a 108-69 victory Monday
night to raise its record to 2-0
against American collegiate teams
this season.
For the first 12 minutes it looked
as if the Soviets had knocked back a
couple of cases of vodka and
knocked off on the outskirts of
Kaunas. As if the Great Com
municator's teleprompter had
stopped scrolling in mid-sentence.
As if the Refrigerator had done a
hook-slide at the Green Bay 1.
And, yes Jim Murray, as if the Lions
had munched out on a few Domino's
pizzas before the Coliseum gates
opened.
The Cardinal was scoring points,
but giving them up almost as
quickly. With 7:52 left in the first
half, the Tritons trailed only 32-26.
Then reality set in. The Cardinal
ran off eight unanswered points and
outscored UCSD 26-7 in the final
eight minutes to take a 58-33
halftime lead.
"We showed we were playing our
fourth game in six days, and the
way we were going you could see
we weren't as crisp and sharp as we
wanted to be," Stanford Coach
Tom Davis said. "We looked a little
sluggish, had a little trouble getting
going, but I'm not sure if we were
tired or not."
The Cardinal had played two
games in a Thanksgiving weekend
tournament in Toronto two days
earlier — defeating Toronto 97-59
Friday and Waterloo 112-72 Satur
day — and had opened against
George Washington only six days
before. The games against the two
Canadian teams do not count in offi
cial NCAA statistics.

Stanford's Andy Fischer had the inside track on UC-San Diego throughout last night's game in
Maples Pavilion. Fischer poured in 12 points on five-for-eight shooting from the floor.
