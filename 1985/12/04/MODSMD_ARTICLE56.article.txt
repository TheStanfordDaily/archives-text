# Grapplers Split Over Holiday
## 
### PETER CASTILLO Staff writer 
While much of the Stanford com
munity was home for the long
Thanksgiving weekend, the Card
inal wrestling team was to the north
competing. Some of the Stanford
contingent may have preferred to
be home feasting on turkey.
While Stanford defeated Hum
boldt Friday 30-20, the next night
the Cardinal was whipped by South
ern Oregon, a small school power
house, 39-11.
With the weekend split, the
Cardinal's record now stands at 3-
1.
"As a team we had a mediocre
performance both nights," Coach
Chris Horpel said. "We forfeited
two classes each night so everyone
knew that they had to go 100 per
cent. Southern Oregon was
psyched up for us and were tough in
every weight class."
Stanford's bright spot on the
weekend was Dave Lee (177
pounds). He routed his opponents
both nights. On Friday Lee
defeated Anthony Califano by a
technical pin 17-1 and the next day
pinned Vince Dawson in the first
period.
Senior Pete Rogers (167 pounds)
did not wrestle at his best due to a
cold, but he overcame his illness
long enough to defeat Humboldt's
Steve Blickenstaff 4-1 and Southern
Oregon's Lonnie Wolfe 7-5.
Heavyweight Kurt Kassulke
gave up 30 pounds as he faced Rand
Valley of Humboldt. Despite the
disadvantage, Kassulke scored a 6-
1 victory. He then faced the
defending NAIA champion Steve
Tekander and gave him a good bat
tle before falling in 11-6 decision.
Jeff Bradley (142 pounds) had a
mixed weekend as he first defeated
Humboldt's state's wrestler Jeff
Plucey 12-1. The next night,
however, was another story for
Bradley.
Inexplicably, the referee for the
meet used last year's rulebook and
overlooked some of this year's rule
changes. Although both wrestlers
were at the same disadvantage,
Horpel said that Bradley let the
calls bother him in a 6-6 tie with
Barry Abrams.
Neil Wartnik, Rogers, Lee, Kas
sulke and Bradley travel to the Las
Vegas Invitation this weekend to
face some of the top wrestlers in

the nation. Athletes from lowa
State, Oklahoma and Oklahoma
State are expected to be on hand.
Horpel believes that these
wrestlers have a good shoot at
qualifying for the NCAA Champion
ships and that this tournament will

give them the chance compete
against the country's elite.
Stanford next goes to the Mid
land Invitational at Northwestern
University Dec. 28-29. Rogers,
Lee, Bradley, Lee and Scott Wig
gen will grapple with wrestlers

from this country's wrestling
powerhouse, lowa.
After the first of the year, Stan
ford again goes north for three
tough dual meets. The Cardinal
first faces Portland State and Pac
-10 power Oregon State.

Stanford Eric Harber was felled by an illness over the holiday. His absence forced Coach Chris
Horpel to forfeit a weight class in each of this weekend's matches.
