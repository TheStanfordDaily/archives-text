# LA 						Competition A Warmup for Swimmer, Divers
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Staff writer 
One could say the Stanford
divers lived in L.A. while the
swimmers died in L.A.
Actually the swimmers did not
die in Los Angeles, but due to a
mix-up, senior Mike Reynolds
was the only Stanford competi
tor in the swimming portion of
the Western States Invite held at
USC over Thanksgiving
weekend. Reynolds and 12 USC
swimmers were the only
entrants in the meet.
The divers, however, were
there in full force, and the Stan
ford contingent of four men and
five women finished off its fall
schedule with a strong showing
in the two-day event that also in
cluded divers from USC and
UCLA.
"The meet was excellent for
us," Stanford Coach Rick
Shavone said. "My kids dove
very well. I'm very pleased."
The Cardinal was particularly
dominant on the women's one
meter low board as Stanford
sophomore Leslie Kleinheksel
topped the field, and was followed
by junior teammate Sharon Daly
in second. Senior Kim Jones
copped third place for the Card
inal.
Stanford was not so over
powering on the three-meter
high board as UCLA teammates
Andy Littlefield and Britt Wil
liams notched first and second
for the Bruins. The Cardinal was
well represented in the top five,
though, as Jones, Daly and
Kleinheksel nabbed third,
fourth and fifth respectively.
"I know we had a good meet,"
Kleinheksel said. "I was pretty
happy with one-meter. Three
meter is something our team has
to work hard at."
"I was very pleased with the
girls' one-meter," Shavone said.
"I'm concerned about their
three-meter performance. We
don't have the best diver, but we

have the best program by far."
Cardinal depth also came to
the fore in the men's events. It
was a case of deja vu as the indi
vidual standings in the high and
low boards were identical.
UCLA senior Doug Shaffer
won both boards and was
seconded by USC freshman
Hung Chen Li. Junior Thor
Johnson led the Stanford squad
with two third-place finishes, and
senior Tom Rothenbucher ended
up with a pair of fourths. Fresh
man Matt Frawley and senior
Bernie Zaia rounded out the
Cardinal contingent in sixth and
seventh.
Shavone was pleased with his
team's performance as Shaffer,
one of the top American divers,
and Li, a silver medalist in the
10-meter platform for China in
the 1984 Olympics, are two of
the best collegiate divers.
"We needed a meet to evalu
ate ourselves," Shavone said.
"The men are diving very well
right now. Both Shaffer and Li
will be picked to finish in the top
three in both boards in the
NCAAs."
"It was a good meet for pre
season," Johnson said. "It gives
us an indication of where we
stand so far. We were diving
against the cream of the crop."
"It was a good meet for the
team," Zaia said. "We basically
went down there to show that
we're still a power to be
reckoned with."
The men's swimming and
diving teams will get back into
action with a home dual meet
against University of the Pacific
Dec. 6, and travel to Austin,
Texas, for the U.S. Open Invita
tional, Dec. 6-8.
The Stanford Invitational will
round out the pre-Christmas
schedule on Dec. 13-15, and
both teams will resume on Janu
ary 11 in a triangular meet
against UC-Davis and the Uni
versity of Hawaii.
The women swimmers will
also compete in the U.S. Open.
