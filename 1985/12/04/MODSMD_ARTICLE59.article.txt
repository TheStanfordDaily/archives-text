# The
						Fridge's Fame Spreads to Farm

Monday's game in the Orange Bowl,
which saw the Chicago Bears lose their first
game of the season to the Miami Dolphins
38-24, wasn't a total loss for Bear fans. It
was obvious from all of ABC's refrigerator
graphics and the No. 72 paraphernalia in the
stands that Bear rookie William "the
Refrigerator" Perry is a big winner in the
NFL.
On Oct. 21, when Perry and his well
publicized 308 pounds bulldozed for a
touchdown against the Green Bay Packers,
the legend of the Refrigerator was born.
By the time Perry caught a touchdown
pass two weeks later against the Packers,
he had become the darling of the American
sports world. Perry's fame has triggered
strong reaction all over the country, includ
ing right here on the Farm.
"I think Perry is great for the game of
football," said freshman Bart Houlahan, a

Bear fan from Evanston, 111. "Nobody has
ever seen a 310-pound ballplayer in the
backfield, let alone running and catching the
ball. It's such a bizarre concept, but it has
added a much-needed aspect of amusement
to the game."
Houlahan's sentiments were echoed by
Coco Patel, another Perry fan. "I think
the attention Fridge has gotten is good for
the NFL. It hits the lighter side of football,
and it has people everywhere talking about
the game."
Not everyone on the Stanford campus
has reacted favorably to Perry, however. "I
think that it is really pathetic that this fat
guy is considered some kind of an American
hero," freshman Richard Stanley said. "To
me, that says something about the football
industry in America as a whole. It's a
media-run business and not a sport, and the
players are not sports heroes; they are
overpaid businessmen. However, I do think
that Perry is probably the most versatile
player in pro football history."

The Refrigerator certainly did not
receive all this acclaim the minute he en
tered the NFL. In fact, when Chicago
Coach Mike Ditka made Perry, a Clemson
defensive lineman, the club's No. 1 pick last
spring, many football critics labeled Perry
the bust of the NFL draft. They said he was
overweight, out of shape and unprepared to
play a complicated NFL defense.
Chicago Defensive Coordinator Buddy
Ryan even went so far as to call Perry "a
wasted draft choice and a total waste of
money."
Although the Fridge is gradually improv
ing as a defensive player (he has started the
Bears' last four games on defense), his real
acclaim has come on offense.
When asked how he would prepare a
short yardage defense to counteract Perry,
Stanford Coach Jack Elway shrugged and
said, "I would just try to stay away from my
own goal line. Perry is so big and active that
he is almost impossible to stop.
"However, I still think I would be more

concerned about the Bears' other running
back (Payton). He's not too bad either," El
way said.
Cardinal linebacker Darron Bennett
seems to be a little less intimidated by
Perry than his coach. "If the force of my
presence alone didn't stop him in his tracks,
I would hit him so quick and so hard, driving
him flat over on his back, that he'd be wish
ing he had kept his fat body on the defen
sive side of the ball."
No matter where Perry's body is these
days, he is finding himself in hot demand.
The Fridge has been receiving a steady
stream of endorsement offers (many from
refrigerator manufacturers), and his phone
lines have been jammed with interview
seeking reporters. On Monday his new
McDonalds commercial was unveiled.
Stanford Psychology Prof. George Quat
trone reduced Perry's new-found fame to
something called the Pratfall Effect.
"Perry's size is seen as endearing because
he is doing some good things. If his perfor

mance on the field were just mediocre, his
size would make him look worse.
"The juxtaposition of his good play and
his size has made him so popular. I wonder
now if there is incentive for him not to lose
weight as the Bears would like him to do,"
Quattrone added.
Prof. A 1 Bandura, also from the Psychol
ogy Department, underscores the role of
the media in creating the Refrigerator fad.
"The media is very powerful in creating
heroes and destroying them. In this case,
there is a combination of events, a team
doing very well and a great copy item."
Regardless of whether or not Perry's
fame lasts much longer, the impact he has
had on the game of football cannot be
diminished. One can only wonder if there is
any danger in the possibility of young foot
ball players trying to emulate the Fridge.
Neither Quattrone nor Bandura per
ceived of any danger of aspiring football
