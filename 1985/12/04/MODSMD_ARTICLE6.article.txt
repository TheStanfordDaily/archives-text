# Palo Alto Council OKs Divestment
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
The Palo Alto City Council voted
Monday night to ban investment of city
funds in companies that do business in
South Africa, joining 50 other American
cities that have approved similar
measures in protest of South Africa's
racist system of apartheid.
Council member Larry Klein, a spon
sor of the resolution, told the council
that Palo Alto "should not allow . . .
money to be used in a criminal enter
prise."
The resolution, which prohibits the
city from investing "directly or indirectly
in the public or private sector of South
Africa or Namibia (South-West Africa),"
passed by a vote of 3-0, with two
abstentions. Four members were dis
qualified from the proceedings because
they hold jobs or investments with ties
to business dealings in South Africa.

Klein, while acknowledging that coun
cil members who abstained from voting
questioned the propriety of debating
foreign affairs, said yesterday that Palo
Alto's "responsibility is unavoidable."
Council member Ellen Fletcher, who
cosponsored the divestment measure,
said yesterday that Palo Alto is
"justified" in taking a stance against
apartheid.
"It's important that we join in when
there's a national movement to support a
worthy cause," Fletcher said. "If city
after city speaks out, it will have consid
erable influence." She drew an analogy
to the city council's support of the na
tional nuclear freeze in 1982, "which
sent Reagan to the bargaining table."
The council also voted to support "the
strongest possible" resolution against
apartheid in an upcoming conference
with the national League of Cities.
Klein said that he doubted whether
the decision would influence Stanford's
policy of selective divestment.
"(The city council's ban on invest

ments) is not the same thing as at Stan
ford," Klein said. "The city doesn't actu
ally own any stock (in South Africa). My
motion simply talks about what banks to
invest in."
Several members of the Stanford
community spoke at the Monday
meeting, including Education Prof. Joel
Samoff, statistics graduate student Eric
Diesel and junior Marvin Jackson.
Samoff charged that the United States
implicitly condones apartheid through its
support of U.S. companies in South
Africa.
"The myth that U.S. companies have
better records (than other companies in
South Africa) is not true," Samoff told
the council. He refuted a popular view
that continued U.S. presence in South
Africa could benefit blacks there, saying
that blacks are "not sufficiently sup
ported by U.S. investments."
Jackson echoed Klein's remarks,
saying that "to ignore the role that cor
porations play in South Africa is close to
a criminal act."
