# Hoopsters Dump USF 77-66
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
Throughout the first half of Friday's
game against the University of San Fran
cisco Dons, the pace of the Stanford
women's basketball team was anything
but lively.
Stanford forward Sue Sebolt offered a
succinct, though perhaps more accurate,
diagnosis of the general Cardinal condi
tion.
"Everyone was really dead," the 5-
foot-10 junior said.
Fortunately, after an invigorating half
time speech by Coach Tara VanDerveer,
Stanford was able to shake off the
postmortem effects of rigor mortis just in
time to outscore the Dons 53-34 in the
second half, turning an eight-point deficit
at the halfway mark into a 77-66 Cardinal
victory.
"She (VanDerveer) had some things to
say at the half," Sebolt said. "Everyone

got it going in the second half — we just
played with more intensity."
Intensity was undoubtedly the corner
stone of the Cardinal's second-half resur
gence. Kim Mercer, a 6-1 sophomore, led
an aggressive inside game that helped the
Cardinal take a decisive edge in free
throw attempts.
The nemesis in their game against the
Santa Clara Broncos last week, the free
throw line, was much more agreeable to
Stanford against the Dons. The Cardinal
converted 23 free throws on 29 attempts;
San Francisco earned a mere three at
tempts, converting on two.
As a further testimony to its increased
intensity, Stanford was able to out
rebound the Dons 44-40, something the
Cardinal has been unable to do in recent
outings.
"I think our rebounding is definitely bet
ter," Mercer said. "We still have a lot a
room for improvement though. We need
to improve our attitude. We have the abil
ity to rebound — we just have to go for it.

Our goal is to grab 12 more rebounds than
the other team."
Mercer grabbed six rebounds for Stan
ford, and 6-2 freshman Evon Asforis,
playing an exceptional game underneath,
tallied nine boards to lead the Cardinal.
Asforis, in her most solid performance
to date, also hit on four of five shots from
the field. A pair of free throws brought
her total to 10 points.
Stanford's scoring catalyst Virginia
Sourlis, although not exactly hot against
the Dons (4-for-17 from the field), created
havoc for opposing defenders with
penetrating drives that resulted in 12 free
throws out of 13 attempts. Her second
consecutive 20-point contribution led the
Stanford scorers. Mercer added a season
high 16 points for the Cardinal.
USF guard Margaret Walsh shot a blis
tering 11-of-15 from the field which, along
with a pair of free throws, gave her a
game-high total of 24 points. Junior stan
dout Teri Hunt added 16 points for San
Francisco.
