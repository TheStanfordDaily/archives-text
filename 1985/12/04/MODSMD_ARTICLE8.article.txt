# Yes, You Can Get What You Want
## Deliveries to each dorm room according to its need 
### MICHAEL NEWMAN Staff writer 
It is late at night. You are hungry. Food ser
vice has been closed for hours, the dorm
kitchenette is a long walk away and undoubtedly
full of month-old oddities, and those six-packs of
beer stockpiled in your refrigerator don't do
much for your appetite.
There is only one solution: Domino's.
As Ã¼biquitous as those people in the red,
white and blue shirts are, though, they are not
the only solution. Pizza may be the most
delivered commodity on campus, but it's not the
only thing that will come to your dorm room if
you want it to. Not by a longshot.
Indeed, pizzas are only the beginning. Feeling
melodic? Order a piano. Too lazy to clean your
room? Have a maid do it for you. Want to be en
tertained? Hire your own private belly dancer.
And the list goes on.
Portable Edibles
Domino's and Ramona's Too deliver just about
all the pizza on campus. Combined, the two res
taurants send about 150 pizzas to the Farm
every night.
Predictably, Chris Curran, a manager at

Ramona's Too, claimed that "we have better
pizza." Curran also pointed out that Ramona's
Too delivers salads, calzones and sandwiches,
too.
But Domino's Asst. Manager Jeff Davis is
not concerned about competition from Ramona's
Too. "Hey, our business is still going up," he
claimed. "We've got more business than we can

handle."
So secure, in fact, is Domino's place in the
pizza-delivery business that it no longer guaran
tees delivery within half an hour for orders after
10 p.m. "It's just too hard to get into the
dorms," Davis explained.
Ramona's Too delivers seven nights a week
from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. and Domino's delivery
hours are Sunday through Thursday 4:30 p.m. to
1 a.m., and Fridays and Saturdays until 2 a.m.
Haagen-Dazs in the Stanford Barn will deliver
ice cream to your room. Understandably, the
demand for ice cream is low during the rainy win
ter, but "business usually picks up in the spring,"
according to Roberta Kowalski, who works
there. Kowalski also noted that Haagen Dazs will
deliver cookies, brownies and "just about any
thing else we sell."
Deliveries leave Haagen-Dazs at 8:30, 9:30,
and 10:30 nightly.
If pizza or ice cream sound unappetizing, Mer
lin's Magic Kitchen can deliver a more traditional
meal. The kitchen has a rotating menu, with beef
stew, barbecued chicken and fish among the
choices for entrees. Included in the meal are a
vegetable and dessert.
