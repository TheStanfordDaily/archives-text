# Yes, You Can Get What You Want
## Deliveries to each dorm room according to its need 
### MICHAEL NEWMAN Staff writer 
It is late at night. You are hungry. Food ser
vice has been closed for hours, the dorm
kitchenette is a long walk away and undoubtedly
full of month-old oddities, and those six-packs of
beer stockpiled in your refrigerator don't do
much for your appetite.
There is only one solution: Domino's.
As übiquitous as those people in the red,
white and blue shirts are, though, they are not
the only solution. Pizza may be the most
delivered commodity on campus, but it's not the
only thing that will come to your dorm room if
you want it to. Not by a longshot.
Indeed, pizzas are only the beginning. Feeling
melodic? Order a piano. Too lazy to clean your
room? Have a maid do it for you. Want to be en
tertained? Hire your own private belly dancer.
And the list goes on.
Portable Edibles
Domino's and Ramona's Too deliver just about
all the pizza on campus. Combined, the two res
taurants send about 150 pizzas to the Farm
every night.
Predictably, Chris Curran, a manager at

Ramona's Too, claimed that "we have better
pizza." Curran also pointed out that Ramona's
Too delivers salads, calzones and sandwiches,
too.
But Domino's Asst. Manager Jeff Davis is
not concerned about competition from Ramona's
Too. "Hey, our business is still going up," he
claimed. "We've got more business than we can

handle."
So secure, in fact, is Domino's place in the
pizza-delivery business that it no longer guaran
tees delivery within half an hour for orders after
10 p.m. "It's just too hard to get into the
dorms," Davis explained.
Ramona's Too delivers seven nights a week
from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. and Domino's delivery
hours are Sunday through Thursday 4:30 p.m. to
1 a.m., and Fridays and Saturdays until 2 a.m.
Haagen-Dazs in the Stanford Barn will deliver
ice cream to your room. Understandably, the
demand for ice cream is low during the rainy win
ter, but "business usually picks up in the spring,"
according to Roberta Kowalski, who works
there. Kowalski also noted that Haagen Dazs will
deliver cookies, brownies and "just about any
thing else we sell."
Deliveries leave Haagen-Dazs at 8:30, 9:30,
and 10:30 nightly.
If pizza or ice cream sound unappetizing, Mer
lin's Magic Kitchen can deliver a more traditional
meal. The kitchen has a rotating menu, with beef
stew, barbecued chicken and fish among the
choices for entrees. Included in the meal are a
vegetable and dessert.

"We deliver to Stanford off and
on," said manager Rob Riley, who
explained that most of his custom
ers are elderly people. "Stanford
students aren't the majority of our
tjusiness." A possible reason, ac
cording to Riley, is that most of the
dinners arrive chilled and have to be
heated up.
I The Magic Kitchen does deliver
to students, although you might
need a microwave if you want hot
■ beef stew.
Some sort of alcoholic beverage
may be just the thing to wash that
J dinner down — and a six-pack of
beer, a bottle of wine or a nip of
whiskey is only a phone call away.
Although they'd prefer to have your
' order several days in advance, and
there is a charge for delivery,
| Berrone's Liquors of East Palo Alto
j can and will deliver.
"I'd just recommend that you call
• ahead," said a clerk in the store."A
lot of the time our drivers are
! booked solid."
\ Delivery hours are 9 a.m. to 6
; p.m. weekdays, so a late-night,
* alcohol-induced euphoria is, alas,
J undeliverable.
An early morning doughnut-fest,
J though, is not. According to Karen
Johnson of the Golden Crescent
> Bakery in Palo Alto, all of the
»bakery's items are deliverable.
I "We'll deliver anything you
J want," Johnson said. Most of the
\ bakery's delivery business, Johnson
noted, comes from out-of-state par
- ents calling in orders for their Stan
i ford sons and daughters.
Dorm Flora
Flowers are perhaps the most
'popular delivery item of all time.
' And there is no shortage of florists
in the Stanford area either. The
* student directory lists five of them.
There are a few dozen in the Palo
Alto Yellow Pages, and any self
f respecting florist will deliver.
[ Around this time of year, though,
• you'd think that a florist shop could
(deliver a Christmas tree. A few
florists could deliver an artificial
tree, but none could deliver a real
one.
None, that is, except the Tree
in Los Altos. "Sure we can,"
exclaimed Asst. Manager Ed Some
rfield when asked if the Tree Farm
could deliver a real, living, honest
to-goodness pine Christmas tree.
"Do you want it potted or cut?"
was his only concern.
Prices for different trees vary,
and there is a delivery charge. But,
as Somerfield put it, "there's noth
ing like a real Christmas tree."

The Personal Touch
Most things are, of course,
delivered by human beings, but
from time to time the people them
selves are the delivery.
Take, for instance, Fantasy-
Grams of San Mateo, which sends
out an array of singing telegrams,
belly dancers, strippers, clowns and
magicians each day. "We get a lot of

business in the Stanford area," said
an unidentified worker.
People in the "personal escort"
business were even more mysteri
ous than the employee of Fantasy-
Grams. Regrettably, "Sinsuals" es
cort service lists a discontinued
telephone number, as does
"Valentines Unlimited." Only a rep
resentative from "Creative Com
panions" answered the phone
during daylight hours.
According to this person, there is
no interesting story behind the ser
vice's unusual name. "I don't want
to be involved in any kind of story,"
she said.
On a more wholesome note,
Homer the Clown of Sunnyvale can
come to your dorm room and enter
tain you. Homer, who can also
come dressed as an animal and can
perform magic tricks, has won
several national awards. Around
this time of year, he can even come
as Santa Claus.
To clean up after your party with
Homer, you might want to call
Mighty Maids, Inc. of Palo Alto.
The company regularly sends out
housemaids to clean homes, and
these maids can come to your dorm
room, too.
Bill Jeffrey, who dispatches
maids for the operation, says that
for a set fee the maids will clean for
three hours. "There might be some
rooms that take that long," he
noted. And the maids, he said, will
clean "whatever's necessary."
Finally, if you can't even get into

yor room, a locksmith from the
Certified Lock and Safe Co. of Palo
Alto can come to your room —
door, actually — and open it for you
if you are locked out and your R.A.
and roommate are A.W.O.L. "I
don't see why we can't," said one of
the company's traveling locksmiths.
Inanimate Objects
A variety of inanimate objects
can be delivered to a dorm room.
Some of them are quite useful, and
some of them, well, aren't.
Topping the useless category are
tires. You can have a tire — radial,
steel-belted, whatever — delivered
right to your room. If nothing else,
it would be a unique paperweight.
However, Len Simon of
Lawrence Tire Service in Palo Alto
has a few stipulations. "It'd have to
be during regular business hours,"
he said, "and you'd have to pay cash
or check." Surely a small price to
pay.
More conventional are balloons.
Balloons are favorites with Stanford
students. Marsha Laris, who has
been the "Balloon Lady" for three
years, said that more than half of
her business is Stanford-related.
Although this year has been
slower than past years, the balloon
lady said, business always picks up
around the holidays. Among some
of her more popular arrangements
are the "gumball" (a lot of little bal
loons inside one big one) and a new

package that includes a small teddy
bear.
Fred Grant, the owner of Grant's
Furniture in Redwood City, says
that his store will deliver anything it
sells. "You gotta come down to the
store and pick it out first, though,"
he said.
However, Grant conceded that if
you knew exactly what you wanted,
Grant's could deliver it without you
having to leave your room.

If you order a new sofa, say,
from Grant's, but don't have any
place to put it, you might want to
build a loft. However, you don't
have any lumber. No problem —
Palo Alto Lumber will deliver all the
necessary materials.
"We have only big trucks," said a
Palo Alto Lumber employee, "so
we really discourage orders of less
than $150." So you might want to
build a few lofts for your Secret
Santa recipient, too.
And a vacuum from A-l Vacuum
Specialists in Redwood City may be
just the thing to clean up the mess
afterwards. A-l rents on a daily or
weekly basis.
"Basically, for the rugs (in the
dorm room), you'd want one of our
upright models," explained owner
Don Horton. Horton should know
— he's been in the vacuum cleaner
business since 1951.
Perhaps you'd like to capture the
whole process of building that loft
on film. Again, this is easily done.
The Audio-Visual Center in Palo
Alto can rent you a projector, a
video camera, a slide projector, a
megaphone. "We rent just about
every piece of audio-visual equip
ment imaginable," claims rental
manager Frank Flynn.
Finally, when you have finally
finished renovating and redecorat
ing your room, you may want to tell
the world. This, too, is easily done
by placing a phone call to D-Sign of
Belmont.
"We do a lot of stuff down there
(at Stanford)," said worker Jim
Todd. Like Grant's Furniture, D-
Sign usually only delivers after a
customer has visited the shop, but,
according to Todd, they will deliver
a sign sight unseen if a customer
"knows exactly what he wants" or
is "pretty casual about it."
Bob Lee, the keyboard manager
at Swain's Music in Palo Alto, says
that his store rents out many musi
cal instruments, but the only instru
ment it delivers is a piano.
"We have about seven or eight
pianos at Stanford now, mostly in
Escondido Village," Lee said. "We
rent virtually every musical instru
ment known to man, but we only
deliver pianos."
If your heart is set on that brass
plated krumhorn, however, why
not get it delivered along with a
piano and then give the piano to
your Secret Santa person to put
with his lofts, once they're
delivered?
And pool supplies finish a close
second to tires in the useless cate
gory. "We've got chlorine, patio
furniture, you name it," said Ed
Somerfield of the Tree Farm.

Despite these deliverable
treasures, the Tree Farm has yet
to deliver a single plastic chair or
bottle of chlorine to the Stanford
campus. "I don't recall ever going
up there (with pool supplies),"
Somerfield said.
Miscellaneous Mess
Most services are just a phone
call away. Don't call Bay Area Tele
phone Service in Los Altos, though
— they'll call you.
"We do wake-up calls, provide
answering service, things like
that," said Diane, a senior operator
there. Although the service can
count no Stanford students among
its customers now, they're
welcome to try the service, Diane
said.
As if answering your telephone
wasn't enough, one company can
rent you something that will answer
your door for you. This is, after all,
Silicon Valley.
Robot Marketing Concepts in
Los Altos has robots available for
rent by the hour or the day. What
will a robot do, you ask, besides an
swer my door? Plenty.

"I have large robots that can
blow up balloons, play music, cut a
cake or perform other simple
tasks," said owner Mavis McQues
ten. "And there are smaller ones
that can carry things, and you can
dress them up."
All of the robots are program
mable, and while none of them will
finish that physics problem set or
decipher a computer problem for
you, they are, according to
McQuesten, "lots of fun."
It won't be lots of fun, though, if
you become ill and are bed ridden.
But don't despair — Town and
Country Pharmacy will deliver all
the necessary prescription drugs to

help you recover.
Town and Country Pharmacy has
been providing this service to Stan
ford students for years, said one
clerk at the store. "All we require
are good directions." She also rec
ommended calling during regular
business hours for best results.

Hall of Fame
Some rental companies, like A-
Abco Rents in Redwood City, just
don't know when to quit.
According to Mary Kear, a secre
tary there, A-Abco has exercise
bicycles, tables, chairs, rollaway
beds, blankets, screens, dishes, sil
verware and coffee makers
available for delivery. "We get a lot
of business from the University,"
Kear said.
Similarly, the Grand Avenue
Rental Company of Redwood City
will deliver just about everything
but the kitchen sink. And they
might even have that.
"What do we deliver? Well, I'd be
here for a month if I had to list
everything," explained clerk Rose
Dillard. Nevertheless, Dillard did
give a quick sample of some of the
things the Grand Ave. Rental Co.
would deliver.
A partial listing: trucks, vans,
vacuum cleaners, jackhammers,
wallpaper steamers, lawnmowers,
ladders, plumbing rods, auto tools,
rug shampooers and tractors.
"And all of our forklifts are
drivable on the highway," Dillard
noted proudly.
There are, of course, many more
items which can be delivered to
your room than are listed here.
This list is necessarily short.
But the next time you get the
urge to pick up the phone and dial
that same old Domino's number,
resist. Why not have a roast beef
dinner served to you by a robot in
stead?




It is late at night. You are hungry. Food ser

Haagen-Dazs in the Stanford Barn will deliver
ice cream to your room. Understandably, the
demand for ice cream is low during the rainy win
ter, but "business usually picks up in the spring,"
according to Roberta Kowalski, who works
there. Kowalski also noted that Haagen Dazs will
deliver cookies, brownies and "just about any
thing else we sell."
Deliveries leave Haagen-Dazs at 8:30, 9:30,
and 10:30 nightly.
If pizza or ice cream sound unappetizing, Mer
lin's Magic Kitchen can deliver a more traditional
meal. The kitchen has a rotating menu, with beef
stew, barbecued chicken and fish among the
choices for entrees. Included in the meal are a
vegetable and dessert.

"We deliver to Stanford off and
on," said manager Rob Riley, who
explained that most of his custom
ers are elderly people. "Stanford
students aren't the majority of our
tjusiness." A possible reason, ac
cording to Riley, is that most of the
dinners arrive chilled and have to be
heated up.
I The Magic Kitchen does deliver
to students, although you might
need a microwave if you want hot
■ beef stew.
Some sort of alcoholic beverage
may be just the thing to wash that
J dinner down — and a six-pack of
beer, a bottle of wine or a nip of
whiskey is only a phone call away.
Although they'd prefer to have your
' order several days in advance, and
there is a charge for delivery,
| Berrone's Liquors of East Palo Alto
j can and will deliver.
"I'd just recommend that you call
• ahead," said a clerk in the store."A
lot of the time our drivers are
! booked solid."
\ Delivery hours are 9 a.m. to 6
; p.m. weekdays, so a late-night,
* alcohol-induced euphoria is, alas,
J undeliverable.
An early morning doughnut-fest,
J though, is not. According to Karen
Johnson of the Golden Crescent
> Bakery in Palo Alto, all of the
»bakery's items are deliverable.
I "We'll deliver anything you
J want," Johnson said. Most of the
\ bakery's delivery business, Johnson
noted, comes from out-of-state par
- ents calling in orders for their Stan
i ford sons and daughters.
Dorm Flora
Flowers are perhaps the most
'popular delivery item of all time.
' And there is no shortage of florists
in the Stanford area either. The
* student directory lists five of them.
There are a few dozen in the Palo
Alto Yellow Pages, and any self
f respecting florist will deliver.
[ Around this time of year, though,
• you'd think that a florist shop could
(deliver a Christmas tree. A few
florists could deliver an artificial
tree, but none could deliver a real
one.
None, that is, except the Tree
in Los Altos. "Sure we can,"
exclaimed Asst. Manager Ed Some
rfield when asked if the Tree Farm
could deliver a real, living, honest
to-goodness pine Christmas tree.
"Do you want it potted or cut?"
was his only concern.
Prices for different trees vary,
and there is a delivery charge. But,
as Somerfield put it, "there's noth
ing like a real Christmas tree."

The Personal Touch
Most things are, of course,
delivered by human beings, but
from time to time the people them
selves are the delivery.
Take, for instance, Fantasy-
Grams of San Mateo, which sends
out an array of singing telegrams,
belly dancers, strippers, clowns and
magicians each day. "We get a lot of

business in the Stanford area," said
an unidentified worker.
People in the "personal escort"
business were even more mysteri
ous than the employee of Fantasy-
Grams. Regrettably, "Sinsuals" es
cort service lists a discontinued
telephone number, as does
"Valentines Unlimited." Only a rep
resentative from "Creative Com
panions" answered the phone
during daylight hours.
According to this person, there is
no interesting story behind the ser
vice's unusual name. "I don't want
to be involved in any kind of story,"
she said.
On a more wholesome note,
Homer the Clown of Sunnyvale can
come to your dorm room and enter
tain you. Homer, who can also
come dressed as an animal and can
perform magic tricks, has won
several national awards. Around
this time of year, he can even come
as Santa Claus.
To clean up after your party with
Homer, you might want to call
Mighty Maids, Inc. of Palo Alto.
The company regularly sends out
housemaids to clean homes, and
these maids can come to your dorm
room, too.
Bill Jeffrey, who dispatches
maids for the operation, says that
for a set fee the maids will clean for
three hours. "There might be some
rooms that take that long," he
noted. And the maids, he said, will
clean "whatever's necessary."
Finally, if you can't even get into

yor room, a locksmith from the
Certified Lock and Safe Co. of Palo
Alto can come to your room —
door, actually — and open it for you
if you are locked out and your R.A.
and roommate are A.W.O.L. "I
don't see why we can't," said one of
the company's traveling locksmiths.
Inanimate Objects
A variety of inanimate objects
can be delivered to a dorm room.
Some of them are quite useful, and
some of them, well, aren't.
Topping the useless category are
tires. You can have a tire — radial,
steel-belted, whatever — delivered
right to your room. If nothing else,
it would be a unique paperweight.
However, Len Simon of
Lawrence Tire Service in Palo Alto
has a few stipulations. "It'd have to
be during regular business hours,"
he said, "and you'd have to pay cash
or check." Surely a small price to
pay.
More conventional are balloons.
Balloons are favorites with Stanford
students. Marsha Laris, who has
been the "Balloon Lady" for three
years, said that more than half of
her business is Stanford-related.
Although this year has been
slower than past years, the balloon
lady said, business always picks up
around the holidays. Among some
of her more popular arrangements
are the "gumball" (a lot of little bal
loons inside one big one) and a new

package that includes a small teddy
bear.
Fred Grant, the owner of Grant's
Furniture in Redwood City, says
that his store will deliver anything it
sells. "You gotta come down to the
store and pick it out first, though,"
he said.
However, Grant conceded that if
you knew exactly what you wanted,
Grant's could deliver it without you
having to leave your room.

If you order a new sofa, say,
from Grant's, but don't have any
place to put it, you might want to
build a loft. However, you don't
have any lumber. No problem —
Palo Alto Lumber will deliver all the
necessary materials.
"We have only big trucks," said a
Palo Alto Lumber employee, "so
we really discourage orders of less
than $150." So you might want to
build a few lofts for your Secret
Santa recipient, too.
And a vacuum from A-l Vacuum
Specialists in Redwood City may be
just the thing to clean up the mess
afterwards. A-l rents on a daily or
weekly basis.
"Basically, for the rugs (in the
dorm room), you'd want one of our
upright models," explained owner
Don Horton. Horton should know
— he's been in the vacuum cleaner
business since 1951.
Perhaps you'd like to capture the
whole process of building that loft
on film. Again, this is easily done.
The Audio-Visual Center in Palo
Alto can rent you a projector, a
video camera, a slide projector, a
megaphone. "We rent just about
every piece of audio-visual equip
ment imaginable," claims rental
manager Frank Flynn.
Finally, when you have finally
finished renovating and redecorat
ing your room, you may want to tell
the world. This, too, is easily done
by placing a phone call to D-Sign of
Belmont.
"We do a lot of stuff down there
(at Stanford)," said worker Jim
Todd. Like Grant's Furniture, D-
Sign usually only delivers after a
customer has visited the shop, but,
according to Todd, they will deliver
a sign sight unseen if a customer
"knows exactly what he wants" or
is "pretty casual about it."
Bob Lee, the keyboard manager
at Swain's Music in Palo Alto, says
that his store rents out many musi
cal instruments, but the only instru
ment it delivers is a piano.
"We have about seven or eight
pianos at Stanford now, mostly in
Escondido Village," Lee said. "We
rent virtually every musical instru
ment known to man, but we only
deliver pianos."
If your heart is set on that brass
plated krumhorn, however, why
not get it delivered along with a
piano and then give the piano to
your Secret Santa person to put
with his lofts, once they're
delivered?
And pool supplies finish a close
second to tires in the useless cate
gory. "We've got chlorine, patio
furniture, you name it," said Ed
Somerfield of the Tree Farm.

Despite these deliverable
treasures, the Tree Farm has yet
to deliver a single plastic chair or
bottle of chlorine to the Stanford
campus. "I don't recall ever going
up there (with pool supplies),"
Somerfield said.
Miscellaneous Mess
Most services are just a phone
call away. Don't call Bay Area Tele
phone Service in Los Altos, though
— they'll call you.
"We do wake-up calls, provide
answering service, things like
that," said Diane, a senior operator
there. Although the service can
count no Stanford students among
its customers now, they're
welcome to try the service, Diane
said.
As if answering your telephone
wasn't enough, one company can
rent you something that will answer
your door for you. This is, after all,
Silicon Valley.
Robot Marketing Concepts in
Los Altos has robots available for
rent by the hour or the day. What
will a robot do, you ask, besides an
swer my door? Plenty.

"I have large robots that can
blow up balloons, play music, cut a
cake or perform other simple
tasks," said owner Mavis McQues
ten. "And there are smaller ones
that can carry things, and you can
dress them up."
All of the robots are program
mable, and while none of them will
finish that physics problem set or
decipher a computer problem for
you, they are, according to
McQuesten, "lots of fun."
It won't be lots of fun, though, if
you become ill and are bed ridden.
But don't despair — Town and
Country Pharmacy will deliver all
the necessary prescription drugs to

help you recover.
Town and Country Pharmacy has
been providing this service to Stan
ford students for years, said one
clerk at the store. "All we require
are good directions." She also rec
ommended calling during regular
business hours for best results.

Hall of Fame
Some rental companies, like A-
Abco Rents in Redwood City, just
don't know when to quit.
According to Mary Kear, a secre
tary there, A-Abco has exercise
bicycles, tables, chairs, rollaway
beds, blankets, screens, dishes, sil
verware and coffee makers
available for delivery. "We get a lot
of business from the University,"
Kear said.
Similarly, the Grand Avenue
Rental Company of Redwood City
will deliver just about everything
but the kitchen sink. And they
might even have that.
"What do we deliver? Well, I'd be
here for a month if I had to list
everything," explained clerk Rose
Dillard. Nevertheless, Dillard did
give a quick sample of some of the
things the Grand Ave. Rental Co.
would deliver.
A partial listing: trucks, vans,
vacuum cleaners, jackhammers,
wallpaper steamers, lawnmowers,
ladders, plumbing rods, auto tools,
rug shampooers and tractors.
"And all of our forklifts are
drivable on the highway," Dillard
noted proudly.
There are, of course, many more
items which can be delivered to
your room than are listed here.
This list is necessarily short.
But the next time you get the
urge to pick up the phone and dial
that same old Domino's number,
resist. Why not have a roast beef
dinner served to you by a robot in
stead?




It is late at night. You are hungry. Food ser
vice has been closed for hours, the dorm
kitchenette is a long walk away and undoubtedly
full of month-old oddities, and those six-packs of
beer stockpiled in your refrigerator don't do
much for your appetite.
There is only one solution: Domino's.
As übiquitous as those people in the red,
white and blue shirts are, though, they are not
the only solution. Pizza may be the most
delivered commodity on campus, but it's not the
only thing that will come to your dorm room if
you want it to. Not by a longshot.
Indeed, pizzas are only the beginning. Feeling
melodic? Order a piano. Too lazy to clean your
room? Have a maid do it for you. Want to be en
tertained? Hire your own private belly dancer.
And the list goes on.
Portable Edibles
Domino's and Ramona's Too deliver just about
all the pizza on campus. Combined, the two res
taurants send about 150 pizzas to the Farm
every night.
Predictably, Chris Curran, a manager at

Ramona's Too, claimed that "we have better
pizza." Curran also pointed out that Ramona's
Too delivers salads, calzones and sandwiches,
too.
But Domino's Asst. Manager Jeff Davis is
not concerned about competition from Ramona's
Too. "Hey, our business is still going up," he
claimed. "We've got more business than we can

handle."
So secure, in fact, is Domino's place in the
pizza-delivery business that it no longer guaran
tees delivery within half an hour for orders after
10 p.m. "It's just too hard to get into the
dorms," Davis explained.
Ramona's Too delivers seven nights a week
from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. and Domino's delivery
hours are Sunday through Thursday 4:30 p.m. to
1 a.m., and Fridays and Saturdays until 2 a.m.
Haagen-Dazs in the Stanford Barn will deliver

J though, is not. According to Karen
Johnson of the Golden Crescent
> Bakery in Palo Alto, all of the
»bakery's items are deliverable.
I "We'll deliver anything you
J want," Johnson said. Most of the
\ bakery's delivery business, Johnson
noted, comes from out-of-state par
- ents calling in orders for their Stan
i ford sons and daughters.
Dorm Flora
Flowers are perhaps the most
'popular delivery item of all time.
' And there is no shortage of florists
in the Stanford area either. The
* student directory lists five of them.
There are a few dozen in the Palo
Alto Yellow Pages, and any self
f respecting florist will deliver.
[ Around this time of year, though,
• you'd think that a florist shop could
(deliver a Christmas tree. A few
florists could deliver an artificial
tree, but none could deliver a real
one.
None, that is, except the Tree
in Los Altos. "Sure we can,"
exclaimed Asst. Manager Ed Some
rfield when asked if the Tree Farm
could deliver a real, living, honest
to-goodness pine Christmas tree.
"Do you want it potted or cut?"
was his only concern.
Prices for different trees vary,
and there is a delivery charge. But,
as Somerfield put it, "there's noth
ing like a real Christmas tree."

The Personal Touch
Most things are, of course,
delivered by human beings, but
from time to time the people them
selves are the delivery.
Take, for instance, Fantasy-
Grams of San Mateo, which sends
out an array of singing telegrams,
belly dancers, strippers, clowns and
magicians each day. "We get a lot of

business in the Stanford area," said
an unidentified worker.
People in the "personal escort"
business were even more mysteri
ous than the employee of Fantasy-
Grams. Regrettably, "Sinsuals" es
cort service lists a discontinued
telephone number, as does
"Valentines Unlimited." Only a rep
resentative from "Creative Com
panions" answered the phone
during daylight hours.
According to this person, there is
no interesting story behind the ser
vice's unusual name. "I don't want
to be involved in any kind of story,"
she said.
On a more wholesome note,
Homer the Clown of Sunnyvale can
come to your dorm room and enter
tain you. Homer, who can also
come dressed as an animal and can
perform magic tricks, has won
several national awards. Around
this time of year, he can even come
as Santa Claus.
To clean up after your party with
Homer, you might want to call
Mighty Maids, Inc. of Palo Alto.
The company regularly sends out
housemaids to clean homes, and
these maids can come to your dorm
room, too.
Bill Jeffrey, who dispatches
maids for the operation, says that
for a set fee the maids will clean for
three hours. "There might be some
rooms that take that long," he
noted. And the maids, he said, will
clean "whatever's necessary."
Finally, if you can't even get into

yor room, a locksmith from the
Certified Lock and Safe Co. of Palo
Alto can come to your room —
door, actually — and open it for you
if you are locked out and your R.A.
and roommate are A.W.O.L. "I
don't see why we can't," said one of
the company's traveling locksmiths.
Inanimate Objects
A variety of inanimate objects
can be delivered to a dorm room.
Some of them are quite useful, and
some of them, well, aren't.
Topping the useless category are
tires. You can have a tire — radial,
steel-belted, whatever — delivered
right to your room. If nothing else,
it would be a unique paperweight.
However, Len Simon of
Lawrence Tire Service in Palo Alto
has a few stipulations. "It'd have to
be during regular business hours,"
he said, "and you'd have to pay cash
or check." Surely a small price to
pay.
More conventional are balloons.
Balloons are favorites with Stanford
students. Marsha Laris, who has
been the "Balloon Lady" for three
years, said that more than half of
her business is Stanford-related.
Although this year has been
slower than past years, the balloon
lady said, business always picks up
around the holidays. Among some
of her more popular arrangements
are the "gumball" (a lot of little bal
loons inside one big one) and a new

package that includes a small teddy
bear.
Fred Grant, the owner of Grant's
Furniture in Redwood City, says
that his store will deliver anything it
sells. "You gotta come down to the
store and pick it out first, though,"
he said.
However, Grant conceded that if
you knew exactly what you wanted,
Grant's could deliver it without you
having to leave your room.

If you order a new sofa, say,
from Grant's, but don't have any
place to put it, you might want to
build a loft. However, you don't
have any lumber. No problem —
Palo Alto Lumber will deliver all the
necessary materials.
"We have only big trucks," said a
Palo Alto Lumber employee, "so
we really discourage orders of less
than $150." So you might want to
build a few lofts for your Secret
Santa recipient, too.
And a vacuum from A-l Vacuum
Specialists in Redwood City may be
just the thing to clean up the mess
afterwards. A-l rents on a daily or
weekly basis.
"Basically, for the rugs (in the
dorm room), you'd want one of our
upright models," explained owner
Don Horton. Horton should know
— he's been in the vacuum cleaner
business since 1951.
Perhaps you'd like to capture the
whole process of building that loft
on film. Again, this is easily done.
The Audio-Visual Center in Palo
Alto can rent you a projector, a
video camera, a slide projector, a
megaphone. "We rent just about
every piece of audio-visual equip
ment imaginable," claims rental
manager Frank Flynn.
Finally, when you have finally
finished renovating and redecorat
ing your room, you may want to tell
the world. This, too, is easily done
by placing a phone call to D-Sign of
Belmont.
"We do a lot of stuff down there
(at Stanford)," said worker Jim
Todd. Like Grant's Furniture, D-
Sign usually only delivers after a
customer has visited the shop, but,
according to Todd, they will deliver
a sign sight unseen if a customer
"knows exactly what he wants" or
is "pretty casual about it."
Bob Lee, the keyboard manager
at Swain's Music in Palo Alto, says
that his store rents out many musi
cal instruments, but the only instru
ment it delivers is a piano.
"We have about seven or eight
pianos at Stanford now, mostly in
Escondido Village," Lee said. "We
rent virtually every musical instru
ment known to man, but we only
deliver pianos."
If your heart is set on that brass
plated krumhorn, however, why
not get it delivered along with a
piano and then give the piano to
your Secret Santa person to put
with his lofts, once they're
delivered?
And pool supplies finish a close
second to tires in the useless cate
gory. "We've got chlorine, patio
furniture, you name it," said Ed
Somerfield of the Tree Farm.

Despite these deliverable
treasures, the Tree Farm has yet
to deliver a single plastic chair or
bottle of chlorine to the Stanford
campus. "I don't recall ever going
up there (with pool supplies),"
Somerfield said.
Miscellaneous Mess
Most services are just a phone
call away. Don't call Bay Area Tele
phone Service in Los Altos, though
— they'll call you.
"We do wake-up calls, provide
answering service, things like
that," said Diane, a senior operator
there. Although the service can
count no Stanford students among
its customers now, they're
welcome to try the service, Diane
said.
As if answering your telephone
wasn't enough, one company can
rent you something that will answer
your door for you. This is, after all,
Silicon Valley.
Robot Marketing Concepts in
Los Altos has robots available for
rent by the hour or the day. What
will a robot do, you ask, besides an
swer my door? Plenty.

"I have large robots that can
blow up balloons, play music, cut a
cake or perform other simple
tasks," said owner Mavis McQues
ten. "And there are smaller ones
that can carry things, and you can
dress them up."
All of the robots are program
mable, and while none of them will
finish that physics problem set or
decipher a computer problem for
you, they are, according to
McQuesten, "lots of fun."
It won't be lots of fun, though, if
you become ill and are bed ridden.
But don't despair — Town and
Country Pharmacy will deliver all
the necessary prescription drugs to

help you recover.
Town and Country Pharmacy has
been providing this service to Stan
ford students for years, said one
clerk at the store. "All we require
are good directions." She also rec
ommended calling during regular
business hours for best results.

Hall of Fame
Some rental companies, like A-
Abco Rents in Redwood City, just
don't know when to quit.
According to Mary Kear, a secre
tary there, A-Abco has exercise
bicycles, tables, chairs, rollaway
beds, blankets, screens, dishes, sil
verware and coffee makers
available for delivery. "We get a lot
of business from the University,"
Kear said.
Similarly, the Grand Avenue
Rental Company of Redwood City
will deliver just about everything
but the kitchen sink. And they
might even have that.
"What do we deliver? Well, I'd be
here for a month if I had to list
everything," explained clerk Rose
Dillard. Nevertheless, Dillard did
give a quick sample of some of the
things the Grand Ave. Rental Co.
would deliver.
A partial listing: trucks, vans,
vacuum cleaners, jackhammers,
wallpaper steamers, lawnmowers,
ladders, plumbing rods, auto tools,
rug shampooers and tractors.
"And all of our forklifts are
drivable on the highway," Dillard
noted proudly.
There are, of course, many more
items which can be delivered to
your room than are listed here.
This list is necessarily short.
But the next time you get the
urge to pick up the phone and dial
that same old Domino's number,
resist. Why not have a roast beef
dinner served to you by a robot in
stead?




It is late at night. You are hungry. Food ser
vice has been closed for hours, the dorm
kitchenette is a long walk away and undoubtedly
full of month-old oddities, and those six-packs of
beer stockpiled in your refrigerator don't do
much for your appetite.
There is only one solution: Domino's.
As übiquitous as those people in the red,
white and blue shirts are, though, they are not
the only solution. Pizza may be the most
delivered commodity on campus, but it's not the
only thing that will come to your dorm room if
you want it to. Not by a longshot.
Indeed, pizzas are only the beginning. Feeling
melodic? Order a piano. Too lazy to clean your
room? Have a maid do it for you. Want to be en
tertained? Hire your own private belly dancer.
And the list goes on.
Portable Edibles
Domino's and Ramona's Too deliver just about
all the pizza on campus. Combined, the two res
taurants send about 150 pizzas to the Farm
every night.
Predictably, Chris Curran, a manager at

Ramona's Too, claimed that "we have better
pizza." Curran also pointed out that Ramona's
Too delivers salads, calzones and sandwiches,
too.
But Domino's Asst. Manager Jeff Davis is
not concerned about competition from Ramona's
Too. "Hey, our business is still going up," he
claimed. "We've got more business than we can

handle."
So secure, in fact, is Domino's place in the
pizza-delivery business that it no longer guaran
tees delivery within half an hour for orders after
10 p.m. "It's just too hard to get into the
dorms," Davis explained.
Ramona's Too delivers seven nights a week
from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. and Domino's delivery
hours are Sunday through Thursday 4:30 p.m. to
1 a.m., and Fridays and Saturdays until 2 a.m.
Haagen-Dazs in the Stanford Barn will deliver
ice cream to your room. Understandably, the
demand for ice cream is low during the rainy win
ter, but "business usually picks up in the spring,"
according to Roberta Kowalski, who works
there. Kowalski also noted that Haagen Dazs will
deliver cookies, brownies and "just about any
thing else we sell."
Deliveries leave Haagen-Dazs at 8:30, 9:30,
and 10:30 nightly.
If pizza or ice cream sound unappetizing, Mer
lin's Magic Kitchen can deliver a more traditional
meal. The kitchen has a rotating menu, with beef
stew, barbecued chicken and fish among the
choices for entrees. Included in the meal are a
vegetable and dessert.

"We deliver to Stanford off and
on," said manager Rob Riley, who
explained that most of his custom
ers are elderly people. "Stanford
students aren't the majority of our
tjusiness." A possible reason, ac
cording to Riley, is that most of the
dinners arrive chilled and have to be
heated up.
I The Magic Kitchen does deliver
to students, although you might
need a microwave if you want hot
■ beef stew.
Some sort of alcoholic beverage
may be just the thing to wash that
J dinner down — and a six-pack of
beer, a bottle of wine or a nip of
whiskey is only a phone call away.
Although they'd prefer to have your
' order several days in advance, and
there is a charge for delivery,
| Berrone's Liquors of East Palo Alto
j can and will deliver.
"I'd just recommend that you call
• ahead," said a clerk in the store."A
lot of the time our drivers are
! booked solid."
\ Delivery hours are 9 a.m. to 6
; p.m. weekdays, so a late-night,

panions" answered the phone
during daylight hours.
According to this person, there is
no interesting story behind the ser
vice's unusual name. "I don't want
to be involved in any kind of story,"
she said.
On a more wholesome note,
Homer the Clown of Sunnyvale can
come to your dorm room and enter
tain you. Homer, who can also
come dressed as an animal and can
perform magic tricks, has won
several national awards. Around
this time of year, he can even come
as Santa Claus.
To clean up after your party with
Homer, you might want to call
Mighty Maids, Inc. of Palo Alto.
The company regularly sends out
housemaids to clean homes, and
these maids can come to your dorm
room, too.
Bill Jeffrey, who dispatches
maids for the operation, says that
for a set fee the maids will clean for
three hours. "There might be some
rooms that take that long," he
noted. And the maids, he said, will
clean "whatever's necessary."
Finally, if you can't even get into

yor room, a locksmith from the
Certified Lock and Safe Co. of Palo
Alto can come to your room —
door, actually — and open it for you
if you are locked out and your R.A.
and roommate are A.W.O.L. "I
don't see why we can't," said one of
the company's traveling locksmiths.
Inanimate Objects
A variety of inanimate objects
can be delivered to a dorm room.
Some of them are quite useful, and
some of them, well, aren't.
Topping the useless category are
tires. You can have a tire — radial,
steel-belted, whatever — delivered
right to your room. If nothing else,
it would be a unique paperweight.
However, Len Simon of
Lawrence Tire Service in Palo Alto
has a few stipulations. "It'd have to
be during regular business hours,"
he said, "and you'd have to pay cash
or check." Surely a small price to
pay.
More conventional are balloons.
Balloons are favorites with Stanford
students. Marsha Laris, who has
been the "Balloon Lady" for three
years, said that more than half of
her business is Stanford-related.
Although this year has been
slower than past years, the balloon
lady said, business always picks up
around the holidays. Among some
of her more popular arrangements
are the "gumball" (a lot of little bal
loons inside one big one) and a new

package that includes a small teddy
bear.
Fred Grant, the owner of Grant's
Furniture in Redwood City, says
that his store will deliver anything it
sells. "You gotta come down to the
store and pick it out first, though,"
he said.
However, Grant conceded that if
you knew exactly what you wanted,
Grant's could deliver it without you
having to leave your room.

If you order a new sofa, say,
from Grant's, but don't have any
place to put it, you might want to
build a loft. However, you don't
have any lumber. No problem —
Palo Alto Lumber will deliver all the
necessary materials.
"We have only big trucks," said a
Palo Alto Lumber employee, "so
we really discourage orders of less
than $150." So you might want to
build a few lofts for your Secret
Santa recipient, too.
And a vacuum from A-l Vacuum
Specialists in Redwood City may be
just the thing to clean up the mess
afterwards. A-l rents on a daily or
weekly basis.
"Basically, for the rugs (in the
dorm room), you'd want one of our
upright models," explained owner
Don Horton. Horton should know
— he's been in the vacuum cleaner
business since 1951.
Perhaps you'd like to capture the
whole process of building that loft
on film. Again, this is easily done.
The Audio-Visual Center in Palo
Alto can rent you a projector, a
video camera, a slide projector, a
megaphone. "We rent just about
every piece of audio-visual equip
ment imaginable," claims rental
manager Frank Flynn.
Finally, when you have finally
finished renovating and redecorat
ing your room, you may want to tell
the world. This, too, is easily done
by placing a phone call to D-Sign of
Belmont.
"We do a lot of stuff down there
(at Stanford)," said worker Jim
Todd. Like Grant's Furniture, D-
Sign usually only delivers after a
customer has visited the shop, but,
according to Todd, they will deliver
a sign sight unseen if a customer
"knows exactly what he wants" or
is "pretty casual about it."
Bob Lee, the keyboard manager
at Swain's Music in Palo Alto, says
that his store rents out many musi
cal instruments, but the only instru
ment it delivers is a piano.
"We have about seven or eight
pianos at Stanford now, mostly in
Escondido Village," Lee said. "We
rent virtually every musical instru
ment known to man, but we only
deliver pianos."
If your heart is set on that brass
plated krumhorn, however, why
not get it delivered along with a
piano and then give the piano to
your Secret Santa person to put
with his lofts, once they're
delivered?
And pool supplies finish a close
second to tires in the useless cate
gory. "We've got chlorine, patio
furniture, you name it," said Ed
Somerfield of the Tree Farm.

Despite these deliverable
treasures, the Tree Farm has yet
to deliver a single plastic chair or
bottle of chlorine to the Stanford
campus. "I don't recall ever going
up there (with pool supplies),"
Somerfield said.
Miscellaneous Mess
Most services are just a phone
call away. Don't call Bay Area Tele
phone Service in Los Altos, though
— they'll call you.
"We do wake-up calls, provide
answering service, things like
that," said Diane, a senior operator
there. Although the service can
count no Stanford students among
its customers now, they're
welcome to try the service, Diane
said.
As if answering your telephone
wasn't enough, one company can
rent you something that will answer
your door for you. This is, after all,
Silicon Valley.
Robot Marketing Concepts in
Los Altos has robots available for
rent by the hour or the day. What
will a robot do, you ask, besides an
swer my door? Plenty.

"I have large robots that can
blow up balloons, play music, cut a
cake or perform other simple
tasks," said owner Mavis McQues
ten. "And there are smaller ones
that can carry things, and you can
dress them up."
All of the robots are program
mable, and while none of them will
finish that physics problem set or
decipher a computer problem for
you, they are, according to
McQuesten, "lots of fun."
It won't be lots of fun, though, if
you become ill and are bed ridden.
But don't despair — Town and
Country Pharmacy will deliver all
the necessary prescription drugs to

help you recover.
Town and Country Pharmacy has
been providing this service to Stan
ford students for years, said one
clerk at the store. "All we require
are good directions." She also rec
ommended calling during regular
business hours for best results.

Hall of Fame
Some rental companies, like A-
Abco Rents in Redwood City, just
don't know when to quit.
According to Mary Kear, a secre
tary there, A-Abco has exercise
bicycles, tables, chairs, rollaway
beds, blankets, screens, dishes, sil
verware and coffee makers
available for delivery. "We get a lot
of business from the University,"
Kear said.
Similarly, the Grand Avenue
Rental Company of Redwood City
will deliver just about everything
but the kitchen sink. And they
might even have that.
"What do we deliver? Well, I'd be
here for a month if I had to list
everything," explained clerk Rose
Dillard. Nevertheless, Dillard did
give a quick sample of some of the
things the Grand Ave. Rental Co.
would deliver.
A partial listing: trucks, vans,
vacuum cleaners, jackhammers,
wallpaper steamers, lawnmowers,
ladders, plumbing rods, auto tools,
rug shampooers and tractors.
"And all of our forklifts are
drivable on the highway," Dillard
noted proudly.
There are, of course, many more
items which can be delivered to
your room than are listed here.
This list is necessarily short.
But the next time you get the
urge to pick up the phone and dial
that same old Domino's number,
resist. Why not have a roast beef
dinner served to you by a robot in
stead?




It is late at night. You are hungry. Food ser
vice has been closed for hours, the dorm
kitchenette is a long walk away and undoubtedly
full of month-old oddities, and those six-packs of
beer stockpiled in your refrigerator don't do
much for your appetite.
There is only one solution: Domino's.
As übiquitous as those people in the red,
white and blue shirts are, though, they are not
the only solution. Pizza may be the most
delivered commodity on campus, but it's not the
only thing that will come to your dorm room if
you want it to. Not by a longshot.
Indeed, pizzas are only the beginning. Feeling
melodic? Order a piano. Too lazy to clean your
room? Have a maid do it for you. Want to be en
tertained? Hire your own private belly dancer.
And the list goes on.
Portable Edibles
Domino's and Ramona's Too deliver just about
all the pizza on campus. Combined, the two res
taurants send about 150 pizzas to the Farm
every night.
Predictably, Chris Curran, a manager at

Ramona's Too, claimed that "we have better
pizza." Curran also pointed out that Ramona's
Too delivers salads, calzones and sandwiches,
too.
But Domino's Asst. Manager Jeff Davis is
not concerned about competition from Ramona's
Too. "Hey, our business is still going up," he
claimed. "We've got more business than we can

handle."
So secure, in fact, is Domino's place in the
pizza-delivery business that it no longer guaran
tees delivery within half an hour for orders after
10 p.m. "It's just too hard to get into the
dorms," Davis explained.
Ramona's Too delivers seven nights a week
from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. and Domino's delivery
hours are Sunday through Thursday 4:30 p.m. to
1 a.m., and Fridays and Saturdays until 2 a.m.
Haagen-Dazs in the Stanford Barn will deliver
ice cream to your room. Understandably, the
demand for ice cream is low during the rainy win
ter, but "business usually picks up in the spring,"
according to Roberta Kowalski, who works
there. Kowalski also noted that Haagen Dazs will
deliver cookies, brownies and "just about any
thing else we sell."
Deliveries leave Haagen-Dazs at 8:30, 9:30,
and 10:30 nightly.
If pizza or ice cream sound unappetizing, Mer
lin's Magic Kitchen can deliver a more traditional
meal. The kitchen has a rotating menu, with beef
stew, barbecued chicken and fish among the
choices for entrees. Included in the meal are a
vegetable and dessert.

"We deliver to Stanford off and
on," said manager Rob Riley, who
explained that most of his custom
ers are elderly people. "Stanford
students aren't the majority of our
tjusiness." A possible reason, ac
cording to Riley, is that most of the
dinners arrive chilled and have to be
heated up.
I The Magic Kitchen does deliver
to students, although you might
need a microwave if you want hot
■ beef stew.
Some sort of alcoholic beverage
may be just the thing to wash that
J dinner down — and a six-pack of
beer, a bottle of wine or a nip of
whiskey is only a phone call away.
Although they'd prefer to have your
' order several days in advance, and
there is a charge for delivery,
| Berrone's Liquors of East Palo Alto
j can and will deliver.
"I'd just recommend that you call
• ahead," said a clerk in the store."A
lot of the time our drivers are
! booked solid."
\ Delivery hours are 9 a.m. to 6
; p.m. weekdays, so a late-night,
* alcohol-induced euphoria is, alas,
J undeliverable.
An early morning doughnut-fest,
J though, is not. According to Karen
Johnson of the Golden Crescent
> Bakery in Palo Alto, all of the
»bakery's items are deliverable.
I "We'll deliver anything you
J want," Johnson said. Most of the
\ bakery's delivery business, Johnson
noted, comes from out-of-state par
- ents calling in orders for their Stan
i ford sons and daughters.
Dorm Flora
Flowers are perhaps the most
'popular delivery item of all time.
' And there is no shortage of florists
in the Stanford area either. The
* student directory lists five of them.
There are a few dozen in the Palo
Alto Yellow Pages, and any self
f respecting florist will deliver.
[ Around this time of year, though,
• you'd think that a florist shop could
(deliver a Christmas tree. A few
florists could deliver an artificial
tree, but none could deliver a real
one.
None, that is, except the Tree
in Los Altos. "Sure we can,"
exclaimed Asst. Manager Ed Some
rfield when asked if the Tree Farm
could deliver a real, living, honest
to-goodness pine Christmas tree.
"Do you want it potted or cut?"
was his only concern.
Prices for different trees vary,
and there is a delivery charge. But,
as Somerfield put it, "there's noth
ing like a real Christmas tree."

The Personal Touch
Most things are, of course,
delivered by human beings, but
from time to time the people them
selves are the delivery.
Take, for instance, Fantasy-
Grams of San Mateo, which sends
out an array of singing telegrams,
belly dancers, strippers, clowns and
magicians each day. "We get a lot of

business in the Stanford area," said
an unidentified worker.
People in the "personal escort"
business were even more mysteri
ous than the employee of Fantasy-
Grams. Regrettably, "Sinsuals" es
cort service lists a discontinued
telephone number, as does
"Valentines Unlimited." Only a rep
resentative from "Creative Com
panions" answered the phone
during daylight hours.
According to this person, there is
no interesting story behind the ser
vice's unusual name. "I don't want
to be involved in any kind of story,"
she said.
On a more wholesome note,
Homer the Clown of Sunnyvale can
come to your dorm room and enter
tain you. Homer, who can also
come dressed as an animal and can

several national awards. Around
