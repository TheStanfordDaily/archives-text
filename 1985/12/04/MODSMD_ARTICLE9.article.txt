# Shakespeare Didn't Write New Poem, Says Rebholz

### KELLY SUND Staff writer 
William Shakespeare did not
write the recently discovered poem
attributed to him, says Ronald Reb
holz, a professor in Stanford's En
glish Department.
Rebholz bases his argument on
the facts presented in a Nov. 25
San Francisco Chronicle article that
described the poem, which was dis
covered by Shakespeare scholar
Gary Taylor.
The nine-stanza love poem was
discovered on Nov. 5 in a collection
of poetry that was handwritten in
the 16305. The collection belongs
to the Bodleian Library at Oxford
University. Taylor's argument that
the poem should be credited to

Shakespeare appears in the
Chronicle article.
Rebholz divides Taylor's argu
ment into three parts. First, the
anonymous 17th-century compiler
of the volume attributed the poem
to Shakespeare. Second, the poem
contains imagery also found in
"Romeo and Juliet." Third, the poet
used many words that appear in
other works of Shakespeare's.
Rebholz refutes the first point by
saying that the word of an unknown
person from the 1630s cannot be
used as conclusive evidence.
The two images found both in the
poem and in "Romeo and Juliet,"
namely a woman's eyes twinkling
like stars and cheeks displaying
"beauty's banner," were cliches of
the time period, says Rebholz.

finally, Rebholz calls the argu
ment about words in the poem ap
pearing in other Shakespearean
works "pure nonsense," as any
thing written by any author will con
tain some words also used by
Shakespeare.
Besides these counter
arguments, Rebholz sees additional
evidence in the poem which sug
gests it was written by someone
other than Shakespeare. Most im
portant to Rebholz, the poem is
"dreadfully written." The form of
the poem is complicated and full of
syntactical inversions, neither of
which is characteristic of Shake
speare, Rebholz said.
Also, the poem praises a beauti
ful woman, and none of Shake
speare's other numerous poems do
this.
