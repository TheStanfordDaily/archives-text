I A big pizza, a big pitcher, a small price I
It's the best-tasting pizza anywhere—generously topped with
the freshest vegetables, fine natural cheeses and the leanest
meats, baked on a fresh-rolled crust. And a cold, frosty pitcher
of your favorite soft drink. Now, how does that sound against
one more night in the cafeteria line?
