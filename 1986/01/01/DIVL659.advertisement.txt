INTRODUCTORY
DECISION ANALYSIS
EES 31
/
This course is intended to transform the way participants conceive of
decision making and to empower them to make important decisions in their
personal and professional lives. Decision analysis has grown over the last
two decades from a mathematical theory to a powerful professional
discipline used by virtually every industry and profession. Formerly available
only to graduate students, the course content has been redesigned to
eliminate the need for a calculus or probability prerequisite by reformulating
rather than watering down the methods of analysis.
• This course meets the undergraduate distribution requirement in Area 8,
Technology and Applied Science.
• 3 units, T Th 11:00-12:15, McCullough 134, Professor R. Howard
