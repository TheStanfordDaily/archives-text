Why does it seem like roommates are always around — playing your stereo — but never when you need to use their car? Why not use our car:
the CalTVain Peninsula Commuter. With 46 trains every weekday, CalTVain can take you where you want to go — whether it's tea dancing up in
the City or the flea market down in San Jose. Without parking hassles. Without paying for gas. And with (or without) your roommate.
You don't need
your roomate's keys
to take the car.
