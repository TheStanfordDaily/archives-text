Take out a box of ribs. And not just any ribs.The best
ribs in the Bay Area, as voted by San Francisco Focus
magazine reaaers.Tne leanest, juiciest baby back ribs,
marinated for 24 hours, oakwood smoked, and sizzled
over a hot mesquite fire. So drop by or call ahead. Well
even supply the extra napkins.
