LISTEN
TO THE MUSIC . . .
and more every Thursday evening at 7:15 in
the Student Union Aspen Room. There's
something different about this music. It's not
polished, or stuffy, but fresh and inviting. ITS
WORSHIP. Lively, joyous, intimate praise!
And there's more. THE WORD.
Meaningful, challenging, uplifting teaching —
not lifeless old cliches.
Come and rediscover something your
professors said couldn't be: JESUS IS ALIVE
AND INHABITS OUR PRAISE!
C- But be forewarned. You will want to
BE FART OF THE SONG.
