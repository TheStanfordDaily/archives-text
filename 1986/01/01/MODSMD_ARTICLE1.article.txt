Stanford University owes its
existence to the death of a
15-year-old hoy. But the
institution founded by
Senator Stanford and his wife
Jane in remembrance of their
son has always been a vibrant
one, centered on life and the
possibilities for the future.
And perhaps that is why the
Stanfords chose to lay the
cornerstone of the University
on the anniversary of their
only son*s birth, rather than
that of his death.
