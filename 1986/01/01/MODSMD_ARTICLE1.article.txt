Stanford University owes its
existence to the death of a
15-year-old hoy. But the
institution founded by
Senator Stanford and his wife
Jane in remembrance of their
son has always been a vibrant
one, centered on life and the
possibilities for the future.
And perhaps that is why the
Stanfords chose to lay the
cornerstone of the University
on the anniversary of their
only son*s birth, rather than
that of his death.

Through all these years I have kept
a mental picture before me. I could see
a hundred years ahead when all the
present trials were forgotten, and all of
the present active parties gone, and
nothing remaining but the institution. I
could see beyond all this the children's
children's children coming here from
tie East, the West, the North, and the
South," Jane Stanford remarked in
1904.
This spring, the University will
celebrate the centennial of the laying
of the cornerstone, which now forms
pan of Building 60, next to Memorial
Church in the inner quadrangle.
Hiring the prominent landscape ar
chitect Frederick Law Olmsted in 1886,
the Stanfords and Olmsted initially
gave serious thought to locating the
campus in the foothills of the ranch, so
as to take advantage of the magnificent
view of the bay, but they finally de
cided to drive in a stake in the grain
fields below, at a point that marks one
corner of the Inner Quadrangle. The
senator felt the flat site was more prac
tical for later expansion.
Olmsted worked out the general
concept for the grounds and the build
ings, but it remained u - ihe young
Boston architect, Charles Allerton
Coolidge, to develop this concept in
the style of his late mentor, Henry
Hobbs Richardson, considered the
most eminent architect of his time.
The style is called Richardsonian
Romanesque, and it follows the Euro
pean Romanesque, which is charac
terized by rectilinear stone buildings
joined by covered arcades formed of
successive half-circle arches supported
by short columns with decorated capi
tals.
The inner quad of 12 classroom
buildings — with the central place re
served for the future Memorial Church
— and three engineering buildings,
Encina Hall for men and Roble Hall for
women were ready for the University's

opening on Oct. 1,1891.
"These long corridors with their
stately pillars," Dr. Jordan said at the
dedication, "will have their part In the
students' training. Each stone in the
quadrangle shall teach its lesson of
grace and genuineness."
President Andrew White of Cornell
pronounced the Stanford buildings the
most beautiful college architecture in
America.
But just before five on the morning
of April 18, 1906, the ground beneath
Stanford's new buildings shook for 45
seconds. The great earthquake killed
two men on campus and caused mill
ions of dollars of damage.
The ponderous church tower, with
its clocks, chimes and spire, crashed
into the chancel of Memorial Church,
and the concussion blew out the front
wall. The rose window and the huge
Venetian mosaic of the Sermon on the
Mount that had graced the facade lay as
rubble in the inner quad.
Memorial Arch, the central structure
of the outer quad — 100 feet high and
decorated with a frieze depicting the'
march of civilization — was damaged
beyond repair. So were a library and
gymnasium that were just short of
completion. None of these was re
placed.
Reconstruction cost more than $2
million. Classes were dismissed until
the fall. Seniors, in what has come to be
known as "The Earthquake Class,"
were voted their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a tempor
ary one, for the young university
quickly rebuilt, pursuing a construc
tion project that was begun in 1886 and
that has been intermittently continued
up to the present.
The construction has taken place on
approximately 5,000 acres reserved by
the Board of Trustees for educational
uses. This is the heartland of the Stan
ford land, comprised for the most part
of the central portion running from El

Camino Real to the hack boundary in
the foothills.
The areas designated for light lie in
open land, including the arboretum,
golf course and the foothill lands used
for space-probing antennae and re
search in nuclear physics and biologi
cal sciences.
The inner and outer quads occupy
17 acres at the heart of the academic
area. The inner quad's 12 classroom
buildings, two of which are now used
by the president and his staff, date from
the time the University opened in 1891,
whiie the outer quad was completed in
1903, the same year that Memorial
Church was dedicated.
Buildings in the outer quad have re
cently been brought up to
earthquake-proof standards by an
"inside-out" process of construction to
preserve the sandstone exterior.
The church represents the Stanfords'
deep religious faith, though they were
followers of no particular denomina
tion. In the Founding Grant, they di
rected the trustees "to have taught in
the University the immortality of the
soul, the existence of an all-wise and

benevolent Creator, and that obedi
ence to His laws is the highest duty of
man."
To serve the widest needs of the
campus community, they decreed that
the church and the University were to
be nonsectarian and at no time tied to
any particular denomination.
In the original plans, the central site
now occupied by the church was re
served for it, though construction was

deferred. When Senator Stanford died
in 1893, his widow determined that the
church would be built as a memorial to
him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final designs
for windows and mosaics, traveling to
Italy to approve the mosaic sketches
and obtaining papal permission to
copy the Roselli fresco of the "Last
Supper" in the Sistine Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics which cover

the interior walls are largely Old Tes
tament, depicting the history of re
demption. The largest mosaic, however,
occupies most of the facade of the
church and, with 4" 7 figures, depicts the
Sermon on the Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906. the
structure was completely dismantled
and rebuilt around a steel framework.
Another set of mosaics was brought
from Venice, but the 80-foot spire,
housing clocks and chimes, was never
rebuilt.
The campus landmark, 285-foot
Hoover Tower, was dedicated at the
University's 50th anniversary in 19-* 1.
The tower and the adjoining Lou Henry
Hoover Building (opened in 1967)
house the vast documentary collec
tions of the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace — millions of
items that include books, documents,
files, manuscripts, diaries, pamphlets,
posters, maps and photos. The Herbert
Hoover Memorial Building, completed
in 1978, honors the former president's
humanitarian works.
Herbert Hoover started the library
collection during World War I when he
headed the Commission for Relief in
Belgium. Struck with the thought that
his relief work placed him in a position

for the Quad.
to document the war, Hoover shipped
crates of material to the library at Stan
ford, his alma mater, and laid the liter
ary foundation of the Hoover Institu
tion.
At the 1941 ceremony, Hoover said:
The purpose of this institution is to
promote peace. Its records stand as a
challenge to those who promote war.
They should attract those who search
for peace."
The Institution has more material on
communism than can be found any
where outside Russia. It has more data
on Mussolini than can be found in Italy.
It also probably has the most complete
record on Hitler and the Nazi move
ment extant.
With these resources, the institution

serves as a center for advanced study
and research on problems of social,
political and economic change in the
20th century.
Across from Hoover Tower sits
Memorial Hall (Auditorium), dedicated
in in 1937. Built primarily through stu
dent contributions as a memorial to
Stanford students and faculty slain in
World War I, the auditorium also con
tains in the foyer plaques honoring the
Stanford dead of World War 11. The
main auditorium seats 1,700 and the
Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200,000-square
foot landscaped area donated to the
University by Mr. and Mrs. Raymond
White in memory of their sons. The
focal point of the plaza is a tall, free
form fountain executed in bronze by
San Francisco sculptor Aristides De
met rios.

As the 1970s ended, the University
drew to a close its so called "Second
Great Stone Age," a building boom
launched in the early '60s in which the
University attempted to meet its big
post-war expansion in students and fa
culty.
In the last 25 years, the University
has raised some $325 million to pay for
new campus facilities and improve
ments, including campus landmarks
such as Maples Pavilion, Meyer Library,
the Green Library annex, the Terman
Engineering Center and the Mudd
chemistry building.
Now, however, as the University
stabilizes its population, it plans fewer
major building projects for the next 10
years. It does, however, plan a major
renovation of the science and en
gineering buildings that comprise the
Near West Campus, the area west of
the Quad.
