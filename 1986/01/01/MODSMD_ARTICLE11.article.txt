# GSB kicks off year under construction

### BARBARA METZLER 
Stanford s Graduate School of Business enters the 1986-
87 year in the midst of construction projects totalling
$18.1 million.
Construction is expected to begin within a week on the
Littlefield Center, which will contain faculty offices, support
services, classrooms and seminar rooms. Plans call for the
building to be shared by groups under the University's
provost office and to contain meeting space for Stanford's
Board of Trustees.
Associate Dean Paul Johnson said the $18.1 million con
struction package includes the new building, renovation of
the existing building and upgrading of the student lounge.
The student lounge project is expected to be completed
by the time students return this week, Johnson said. The
summer-long renovation upgraded carpeting and furniture
and brought the kitchen mechanical and electrical systems
up to standards.
The lounge, referred to by students as "Fast Gas," will be
formally named the Ernest and Katherine Arbuckle Student
Center in honor of the former dean of the business school
and his wife. The couple was killed in an automobile acci
dent in January.
Gifts from individuals and corporations funded the
various constructions projects, Johnson said. Once the new
building is completed — in about 14 months — the vacant

space in the existing GSB building will be occupied by 40
Ph.D. candidates and the school's Career Management Cen
ter. The students and the center currently have office space
in trailers adjacent to the building.
Three hundred seventy-seven new students in the MBA,
Ph.D. and Sloan Executive programs will begin classes next
week. Seventeen students will embark on Ph.D. programs
while 42 executives will take part in the one-year Sloan pro
gram.
Wayne Forester, assistant director of MBA admissions,
said 3,837 applicants sought space in the business school's
Class of 1988. Three hundred and eighteen students are ex
pected to enroll.
Forester, who has been acting director of admissions
during the past year, said the trademark of each entering
class is diversity. "Last year's class may have had a profes
sional basketball player, but this year's class has a profes
sional hockey player."
One trend the admissions office observed in recent years
is the increasing number of applicants who are currently in
medical school or who already have medical degrees.
Forester said this may be reflective of the current environ
ment in the health care industry.
Forester will be leaving the admissions office in Novem
ber, he said. Incoming director uf admissions Bruce Paton is
already on board in that office.
Students entering the MBA program this year will use per

sonal computers exclusively in the core teaching curricu
lum, a change from previous curriculums that included ex
posure to multi-user "mainframe" computers.
Associate Dean Chuck Holloway said the school has used
microcomputers for a number of years, but is now in a posi
tion to accommodate all students who need to use one.
Therefore the curriculum has been changed to include their
use entirely.
Bill Elbring, GSB director of computing, said the business
school "is still striving to strike the appropriate balance be

tween dependence on personal computers and depen
dence on the multi-user system."
A new curriculum in business and the environment will
be available this year, Holloway said. The school has offered
a core course in this field, but has not had the faculty to offer
an entire curriculum in the area. Additionally, a new Ph.D.
curriculum is available in political economics, and is offered
jointly with Stanford's Political Science and Economics de
partments and the Hoover Institution. Another new program
offers international studies with an emphasis on the Pacific
Basin, Holloway added.


Ground is expected to be broken this week on an addition to the Graduate School of Business. The new building will
include new faculty offices, support services, classrooms and seminar rooms.
