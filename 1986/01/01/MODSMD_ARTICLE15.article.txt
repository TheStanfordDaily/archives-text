# Galleries abound if you look for them
## A
						haven for art 
### 
Keeping track of Bay Area art — what is being done
and what is being exhibited — is the hardest job of
all for the culture hound. Outside of a few major
museums, art is the least publicized aspect of the local cul
tural life. Adding to the problem is the number of small
galleries, especially in San Francisco, many of which stage
consistendy important exhibits that last a month or less and
that you won't know about unless you seek them out. Be
cause of the vast number of places in the area that exhibit
art, the following account is destined to be highly arbitrary,
covering but a few of the most important venues.
The Stanford Art Department maintains both the
Stanford Museum of Art and the Stanford Art Gallery
The museum's permanent collection is a marvelous
resource for students; all periods of European art are
represented, and there are rooms devoted to Greek and
Roman, Asian and Oceanic art as well. There is a large
gallery devoted to Stanford family memorabilia. The
museum's main claim to fame is its renowned Rodin collec
tion, which is housed in a special rotunda within the
museum and newly constructed outdoor garden west of the
building; the centerpiece of the garden is a full-sized casting
of "The Gates of Hell." The museum's upstairs balconies,

and the Meidel Room, hold special exhibits.
The Stanford Gallery, amid the Graduate School of Busi
ness, Hoover Tower and the Art and History buildings,
holds rotating exhibits throughout the year, including the
annual show of work by candidates for the Master of Fine
Arts degree. The Gallery building also houses the Gallery
Bookshop, which sells art books, cards and posters.
A number of other places on campus hang exhibits more
or less regularly. STARTS (Student Arts at Stanford) puts on
monthly exhibits in the Coffee House, mainly of student
photography, and in the upstairs lobby of Tresidder Union.
The Bechtel International Center puts on exhibits with in
ternational, often Third World, themes.
San Francisco is home to four major museums, three of
which are under common management. These three, the
"Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco," are the M.H. de
Young Memorial Museum, the Asian Art Museum
(both in the same building in Golden Gate Park) and the
California Palace of the Legion of Honor (Lincoln
Park). The de Young's collection, which encompasses West
ern art from the Greeks and Romans to early 20th-century
European and American, isn't particularly noteworthy (i.e.,
one visit is enough), but the museum plays host to many of

the top national traveling shows — in recent years, San
Francisco money has brought Tut, Alexander, Shanghai, etc.
— to the de Young. The Asian Art Museum has one of the
best permanent col lea ions in its field in the country; unfor
tunately, there isn't enough room on the walls for more
than a fraction of it. The collection is constantly rotated. The
Palace of the Legion of Honor collection is composed en
tirely of French art, from medieval tapestries to a room of
impressionists and post-impressionists. In the basement of
the Legion is the museum's graphic arts department, which
puts up rotating exhibits of prints and drawings. The Legion
also draws big-name temporary exhibits — the Phillips col
lection and the Dresden exhibit have been there in recent
years.
The fourth of San Francisco's big museums is the rather
small Museum of Modern Art (Van Ness and McAllister, in
the Civic Center). The MOMA can't pretend to be a
catalogue of 20th-century art, like its namesake in New York;
In fact, its permanent collection is surprisingly meager. It
has its strengths, however, especially its vast photography
holdings (too little of which are ever hung) and a room of
monumental paintings by local abstract expressionist Clyf
ford Still. MOMA, like the fine Arts Museums, draws big

traveling exhibits all the time (San Francisco probably
draws more of these than any American city outside New
York).
Across the bay, the Oakland Museum (1000 Oak St.,
near Lake Merritt and the Lake Merritt BART station) is
worth a visit if only for the building itself, an award-winning
concrete pile with roof-top gardens, designed by Kevin
Roche. The museum is officially The Museum of California
and has galleries devoted to California art, history and natu
ral sciences.
Also worth seeing is the University Art Museum at the
University of California at Berkeley (2626 Bancroft Way).
The museum owes its existence, and a large part of its col
lection and initial funding, to German painter Hans Hoff
man. Hoffman spent the Second World War as a refugee at
the Berkeley campus, and as a show of gratitude gave a
group of his canvases and a large sum of money to the uni
versity so that it could build a museum.
By far the liveliest part of San Francisco's art world is the
scads of galleries scattered around town. The good ones
may be hard to find (if you can tell from the street that
something is a gallery, it probably isn't worth a visit), but a
little searching pays off.
