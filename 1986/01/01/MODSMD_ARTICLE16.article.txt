# San Francisco's theaters make the City culturally supreme
## 
### 
What museums are to Florence,
the theater is to San Fran
cisco.
No matter how much people talk
about San Francisco opera, or the
City's nightclubs, it is the area's
hundreds of theater groups that
validate San Francisco's claim to West
Coast cultural supremacy.
The most important activity takes
place in the many small theater groups
scattered around San Francisco and
Berkeley; the following account starts
closer to home, covering the campus
and area theater first, then moving to
the City's major groups, and finally ar
riving at the smaller venues.
The Stanford Drama Department
presents a major play each quarter,
with productions usually taking place
in the Little Theatre behind Memorial
Auditorium. The productions are di
rected and designed by members of
the department, but cast auditions are
open to the public and students from
fields other than drama are often cast.
In addition to the major produc
tions, the department sponsors
Graduate Directing Workshops, "no
frills" productions directed by the
deparment's graduate students. These
are held at The Nitery, in the Old Un
ion, and there is no admission charge.
There are several successful, on
going, student-run producing compan
ies on campus. Chief among these is
Rams Head, which produces
"Gaieties," a comedy revue, during the
Big Game week in the fall, and a major
musical production each spring. Both
"Gaieties" and the musical are put on
in Memorial Auditorium. The group
also produces a program of one-act
plays written by students. The Com
pany is a smaller group, with a pro
duction schedule less cut-and-dried
than Rams Head's; individual initiative
counts for more in determining what
plays are produced and when. The
Company's productions vary greatly in
scope, ranging in recent years from the
elaborate stagings of "Hair" and "Jesus
Christ Superstar" to a travling troupe
that went from dorm to dorm doing
"The Fantasticks" in lounges.

The Black Performing Arts
Group and the Asian American
Theatre Project also do plays, usually
concentrating their efforts on spring
quarter. Several years ago, the AATP
put on the first performance anywhere
of David Henry Hwang's FOB, a play
which was later produced by Joseph
Papp in New York to critical acclaim.
All of the student production com
panies rely, of course, on student abil
ity in all areas: performance, direction,
set and lighting, costume work and
promotion. Announcements regarding
auditions and support positions appear
in The Daily and in flyers posted
around campus.
Spring quarter is the great season
for dorm productions. Most of the
larger dorms, and even some of the
smaller ones, put on plays in the

spring. The repertoire is drawn mainly
from Broadway, either comedies
("You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown";
"The Best Little Whorehouse in
Texas") or musicals ("Oklahoma";
"Grease"). Occasionally something a
bit more cerebral is attempted. Over
the years, some dorms have gained a
reputation for the lavishness of their
productions; Toyon, Lagunita and
Branner are famous in this regard.
In San Francisco, the American
Conservatory Theater, or ACT ranks
with the Guthries Theatre in Min
neapolis as one of the country's best
regional theaters. Its presence in the
Geary Theatre, at 450 Geary in the City,
makes Geary Street the heart of the
theater district. No company in the Bay
Area, or even on the East Coast
(outside of Shakespearean festival

groups) can rival the ACT in perfor
mance, facilities or reputation. The
ACT is an arch-conservative company;
they go heavy on the classics, and the
modern (meaning 1920) plays they do
perform tend to be of the sparkling
British wit (Noel Coward) or the
folksy-Anferican ("I Remember
Mama," "Ah! Wilderness") kind. But
they are nearly always a joy to watch,
because no one puts polish on a pro
duction these days like the ACT.
The big money in San Francisco
theater is tied up in Carole
Shorenstein's two "Best, of Broadway"
series. "Best of Broadway" plays in
three different theatres: the Golden
Gate, 25 Taylor St.; the Orpheum,
1192 Market St.; and the Currant, 445
Geary St. (next door to the ACT). All
three host traveling productions of

Broadway hits. Smaller-scale New York
successes, such as Caryl Churchill's
"Cloud 9 or Harvey Freistain's "Torch
Song Trilogy," will sometimes he
brought to Theatre on the Square or
the Marine's Memorial Theatre,
both located in the Geary district near
Union Square
Although it does not often receive
much publicity, the bulk of the theatri
cal activity in San Fransico is centered
around the smaller, semi-professional
theaters. It is here that most of the local
actors work, where the local authors
often have their plays first performed
and where the local technicians get to
try out their ideas. They are often
referred to as the "99-seat" theaters
since, by limiting themselves to fewer
than 100 seats, they may avoid Equity
(i.e., union) pay scales and thus mount
new productions at relatively low cost.
The size of these theaters also brings
benefits to the audience. Spaces this
small offer an intimacy' and intensity
that is almost never attained in a large
theater. There is often no extravagant
stage; sometimes just a space on the
floor surrounded by seats. The tradi
tional distance between audience and
performer can be almost completely
wiped out, emphasizing the "live"
aspects that give theater its unique
excitement.
Another advantage of the small size
is that writers and directors are offered
a great deal of flexibility. The risks of
mounting a production are not so
great, and experimentation is com
mon. Another important feature is that
the theaters may specialize â€” only
producing plays with certain themes,
or plays connected with some social or
political group.
Trying to describe this aspect of San
Francisco theater can be difficult since
companies can surface and then
quickly disappear. There are a number
of theaters, however, which have
become an established part of the
City's cultural life. Even if it omits the
more volatile companies, a description
of their work should given an impres
sion of the vitality of small theater in
the Bay Area.

The Magic Theatre is the best
known of the small theaters in San
Francisco, thanks in part to its resident
playwright, Sam Shepard. Shepard has
premiered many of his more recent
plays at the Magic, including "True
West" and "Buried Child" (which won
the Pulitzer Prize in 19~ T 9).
The Magic specializes in new plays
by contemporary playwrights, and of
ten stages experimental theater pieces
by performance artists. It has strong
ties to contemporary German and
Austrian theater via its dramaturg, Stan
ford Drama Prof. Martin Esslin.
The Julian Theatre specializes in
plays dealing with current events and
contemporary social issues. In addi
tion, its productions are usually multi
racial and multi-cultural, thus giving an
implicit social consciousness to any
play it performs. The Julian is located
at 953 DeHaro Street, on Potrero Hill.
It shares its space in a residential
neighborhood with another group, the
Nabe Theatre.
Because of the many ethnic and so
cial groups in the City, playwrights and
performers from these groups have
come together to form theaters which
concentrate on the special interests of
these communities. Two of the best
known groups of this type are Theatre
Rhinoceros and the Asian-
American Theatre Project. Theatre
Rhinoceros produces plays about
homosexuals, several years ago
premiering Fierstain's'"Torch Song
Triolgy."
Because of its heavy reliance on im
provisation and its often transitory na
ture, it is difficult to give much con
crete information about performance
art in the City. It is almost completely
unpublicized, with information being
spread by word of mouth among the
artist's friends and colleagues. Another
problem is that the works are often
performed in such unusual settings as
empty lots, warehouses or parking lots.
The small theaters in San Francisco
often put on plays with brief runs and
do not have much money to spend on
publicity. As a result, just finding out
what is going on can be a challenge.
