# Finding music on the Farm
## 
### 
usic is the hardest entertain
ment category to pin down
because it encompasses every
thing from the San Francisco Opera to
San Francisco's 1-Beam night club, with
room in between for Bach societies
and Rolling Stones concerts in
Candlestick Park. At the same time, the
local music scene is less monolithic
than the theater; in any given genre of
music, it is possible to keep track of
what's happening, and even to attend a
good proportion of the relevant events.
Most musical performers spend
their time traveling; the best way to de
scribe local musical offerings is in
terms of organizers, who tend to stay in
one place. On campus, the most visible
of these organizers is the Lively Arts
at Stanford. While the Lively Arts pro
gram contains a variety of events, in
cluding dance companies, films and
lectures and (occasionally) drama, the
bulk of the schedule is made up of
musical acts. All Lively Arts concerts
take place either in Memorial Au
ditorium or Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
depending on their drawing power.
For the big acts, it may be hard to find
good seats, or any seats; the Lively Arts
conducts an aggressive season ticket
sales campaign each spring. For tickets
to individual events, go to the Tresid
der Ticket Office. Ticket prices are
high, for campus events, but less than
you'd pay to see the same performers
elsewhere. Don't worry about missing
out on the events; it's hard not to hear
about them. The Lively Arts advertising
campaigns, like their ticket sales, are
aggressive.
The Stanford Music Department
sponsors a full season of performances
throughout the school year, featuring
campus groups and performers. Many
of the department's students give reci
tals in the upstairs lounges at Tresidder
which are open to the public. Orchest
ral ensembles, including the Stanford
Symphony and Chamber Orchestras
and the Stanford Baroque Ensemble,
and the University's vocal grops, the
Chorus and Chorale, give perfor
mances in Dinkelspiel and the Church.
The Tresidder recitals are free; the en
semble performances cost $l-$3 for
students. Other groups sponsored by
the department include the Dunstable
Singers, performers of older choral
music, and Alea 11, the department's
contemporary music ensemble. One of
the nicer Stanford traditions is the
yearly Messiah Sing, held at the end of

each winter quarrer in Memorial
Church.
The Bay Area is known as a hotbed
of "new" music. Stanford's contribu
tion to this is the Center for Computer
Research in Music and Acoustics, lo
cated at 1600 Arastradero Rd. between
Page Mill and Alpine Roads. The
CCRMA gives periodic performances of
its latest compositions in the evening
under the open sky. They suggest you
bring a blanket.
The Music Deptartment publishes a
quarterly calendar of events, which can
be obtained from them or at the Tre
sidder Information Desk. If you wish to
buy tickets for an event in advance, you
may order them from the department
or purchase them at the Tresidder Tic
ket Office.
STARTS (Student Arts st Stanford) is
a student group, headquartered in Tre
sidder, which works to involve stu
dents in the arts. It sponsors a truly
wide variety of things: lectures, art
exhibits, excursions around the Bay
Area, classes in calligraphy, dancing,
music, etc., and large-scale events such
as the Stanford Christmas Faire and the
Plant and Poster Sale (which is going
on right now). And, of course, music:
noon concerts on the Tresidder patio,
featuring local rock and jazz groups,
"Classical Cafe" and other programs in
the Coffee House and live music sev
eral nights a week at Encina Station.
At an institution that doesn't have
many "institutions" of its own, the
Stanford Savoyards stand out. For the
past several years, they have performed
Gilbert & Sullivan operettas in Din
kelspiel Auditorium. The
Savoyards'membership is drawn from
all parts of the University: Students, fa
culty, staff and community members
work together to put on the shows.
This year's productions will begin with
"The Sorcerer."
This only covers the more formal,
institutionalized, instances of music on
campus. Other sorts of events happen
all the time. Big-name rock concerts
recently made their comeback in Frost
Amphitheatre. Another musical possi
bility is dorm and frat parties; they
often feature live music, especially
spring quarter.
The best-known Bay Area purveyor
of classical music is also the one least
popular among students â€” the San
Francisco Opera. The opera, on the
basis of its numerous big-name guest
stars, is world-renowned. This season's

lineup includes such all-time favorites
as Puccini's "La Boheme and Mozart's
"The Marriage of Figaro All perfor
mances are in the War Memorial
Opera House (Civic Center, San Fran
cisco, Van Ness Avenue and Grove
Street).

The Bay Area pro
vides something for
every musical taste.

Closer to home is the West Bay
Opera. In the city, the Pocket Opera
presents opera on a small scale at the
On Broadway Theatre, 433 Broad
way, and the Lamplighters performs
operattas (Sigmund Romberg, etc.) at
the Presentation Theater, Turk near
Masonic.
The San Francisco Symphony,
while certainly respectable, does not

quite have the world-class status ac
corded the Opera. But critical opinion
has improved every year to the point
where now the symphony is ranked
among the best in the country. Under
the direction of Herbert Blomstedt, the
symphony keeps garnering better and
better reviews and more and more
honors. "Going to the symphony" is a
very popular "cultural thing to do"
with students. This is largely due to the
symphony's student outreach program;
many dorms own season tickets to the
symphony, for use by students. Pro
grams at the symphony run one to two
weeks, Wednesday through Sunday;
student tickets are generally for Wed
nesday night performances. Wednes
day night programs are also broadcast
on KQED radio.
The San Jose Symphony, con
ducted by George Cleve, is mainly
known for its extensive Mostly Mozart
series, given every summer. All perfor
mances are in the San Jose Performing
Arts Center (one of the area's best
auditoriums) in downtown San Jose.
Both the San Francisco and San Jose
symphonies put on series at Flint Cen
ter, on the De Anza College campus in
Cupertino (a short drive south from
Stanford).
