## Eating out 
### 
Let them eat coffee cake
Morning eaters are lucky here —
Palo Alto and Menlo Park have a ple
thora of good restaurants that spe
cialize in breakfast and lunch.
First among equals is Late for the
Train (150 Middlefield Rd., Menlo
Park), a folksy place that makes great
omelets, divine blintzes and fruit
pancakes and the usual salads and
sandwiches, plus ever-changing
desserts. If you go on a weekend, par
ticularly a Sunday, expect at least a 45-
minute wait; it's best, if you can, to go
for an early or late weekday lunch,
when you can often be seated immedi
ately.
Modeled along much the same lines
is Hobee's (two locations in Palo Alto:
4224 El Camino Real and Town and
Country Village, across from the
stadium), a family operation with more
branches around the peninsula.
Hobee's follows a more traditional

American breakfast lines — sausage,
e BB s > ham — but isn't lacking for fresh
squeezed juices, fruit and other Cali
fornia trimmings, and it has a truly ad
dictive coffee cake that comes with
most of the breakfasts. Both Hobee's
and Late for the Train provide free cof
fee for waiting crowds.
The Farmer's Market (448 Califor
nia Ave., Palo Alto) has a small menu,
spotty service (semi-cafeteria style)
and the ambience of a butcher shop,
but it serves great breakfasts (try the
apple pancakes or a ham/swiss/apple
omelet) at relatively low prices.
Finally, there's the favorite morning
meeting spot of Stanford sororities —
Dinah's Poolside Coffee Shop (4269 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto, not to be
confused with Dinah's Shack, a restau
rant next door), which has delicious
omelets.
Where the Cardinal flocks
Stanford hangouts change from year
to year, of course, but there are such
things as old standards.
Half the people in Ramona's (541
Ramona St., Palo Alto) on any given
weekend night will be from Stanford;
the crush is particularly intense before
and after basketball games. Most of
them will be eating the second-best
pizza in the area, while those who want
to be different chew on calzone or
decent hamburgers. The once-great
Ramona's salad bar retains only a
shade of its former glory.
Down the street at the Good Earth
Restaurant (185 University Ave., Palo
Alto), you'll find a different, slightly
older Stanford crowd eating chic
health food. The iced tea at this time of
year is particularly refreshing.
Of course, "hangouts" in the true
Stanford sense of the word are places
you go to swill beer, and there are a
few of those, too.
The Dutch Goose (3567 Alameda
de las Pulgas, Menlo Park), a functional
sort of place where it's SRO on Senior
Pub Nights, and The Oasis (241 El
Camino Real, Menlo Park), a downright
ugly place that has been witness to un
told decades of Stanford history, are
the two that come to mind in this
catagory. One thing to know: Refer to
the two establishments as "The Goose"
and"The O," respectively.
If you'd like your nightlife a bit row
dier, try St. James Infirmary (390
Moffett Blvd., Mountain View) or
Antonio's Nut House (321 California
Ave., Palo Alto), places where you can
get into a fight if you try hard enough
or look enough like a Stanford student.
In recent years, an attempt has been
made to turn The Lancashire Tavern
(547 Emerson St., Palo Alto) into a
Stanford hangout of the Pub Night vari
ety, but it doesn't seem to have fully
caught on. A morning alternative: the
weekend brunch crowd at Hobee's.
And don't forget The New Varsity
(456 University Ave., Palo Alto), espe
cially when the theater is showing
Woody Allen movies.

With chopsticks and a sombrero
It's the familiar refrain: How about
Chinese? Why don't we try Mexican?
And around here, it's easy to fall into,
because there are more ethnic restau
rants than you can shake a burrito or a
potsticker at. Most of them are as bad
as you'd expect; here are a few good
ones:
Generations of Stanfordites have fal
len in love with the mushu pork at
Chef Chu's (1067 North San Antonio
Road at El Camino Real, Los Altos). This
always-crowded Mandarin restaurant
prepares perfectly solid, unexciting
dishes — it's the ideal place for large
groups with diverse tastes. The food's
more exciting at China First (675 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto), another place
with a big reputation. The cuisine here
is Szechuan/Hunan, albeit not too
spicy, and there are great dishes on the
menu.

On a more modest scale, there uu
two worthwhile Chinese places in
Menlo Park: Yuen Yung (639 Santa
Cruz Ave.) and Su Hong (1039 El
Camino Real). Both are eclectic but
primarily Cantonese/Mandarin Su
Hong has better food; Yuen Yung more
interesting decor — it looks like a
cross between a Chinese restaurant
and a fern bar.
Palo Alto lost its only really good
Mexican restaurant when the Andes
Mexican Restaurant, a Whiskey Gulch
anomaly, folded a few years back. Now
a trip to Menlo Park or Los Altos is re
quired.
Estrellita (971 North San Antonio
Rd., Los Altos) isn't what it used to be,
but it still has great chimichangas.
There are two passable family-style
Mexican joints in Menlo Park, La Luna
Mexican Cafe (1137 Chestnut St.) and
Caleta (1143 D Crane St.). If you don't
mind a drive, the best Latin restaurant
around is probably El Calderon (699
El Calderon Ave., Mountain View),
which is hidden away in a small shop
ping center and has a
Mexican/Salvadoran menu.
Vive La France!
Without going into too much detail,
there's one local French restaurant that
comes close to meeting the bistro ideal
(good food, relatively low prices): Le
Pot au Feu (1149 El Camino Real,
Menlo Park). Somewhat more formal,
but still affordable, are Pear Williams
Restaurant Francais (150 Mid
dlefield Rd., Menlo Park), which is
named for its dessert specialty, and
Chez Louis (4170 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto), virtually an institution. Most
of the other French restaurants nearby
suffer from some combination of
pretentiousness, over-pricing, bad ser
vice or just plain bad food.
Das food
The only real German restaurant
anywhere near campus is the Black
Forest Inn (376 First St., Los Altos).
Meals are prepared rather indif
ferently, but if you just have to have
some weinerschnitzel with red
cabbage and potato pancakes, this is
the place to go.

Slices of life
Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi, Too
(939 El Camino Real, Mountain View)
has no peer in pizza; what it does have
are 45 to 75-minute waits on
weekends, which can fly by if a large
group of people go and drink while
waiting (if you look 21, you'll be ac
costed by a roving cocktail waitress the
minute you sign in). Try the fresh
tomato and garlic pizza, a house
specialty, or the ever-popular strorn
boli or Hawaiian. Avoid the Italian din
ners, which are often dreadful. A dis
tant second to FJ&L is Ramona's, which
has decent New York style (i.e., heavy
and spicy) pizza and slightly shorter
waits, and is closer to campus.
Honorable mention goes to the pizza
with barbecue sauce (ladled on in
place of tomato sauce) at Jose's (2275
El Camino Real, Palo Alto), and the
pizza with almost anything on it at
Applewood Inn (1001 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park).
Midnight munchies
There used to be a wealth of places
where you could go at 2 a.m. — or 4
a.m. or 6 a.m. — with the gang and be
obnoxious, or with a loved one to for
tify' yourself in an emotional crisis, or
by yourself to study and mainline some
caffeine.
Then Stickney's cut back to midnight
and then became a trendy yuppie
hangout and Luv's went to 24 hours on
weekends only and eventually l">ecame
a singles pickup joint. In the old days,
going to Denny's or Lyon's didn't even
cross your mind; now they're all that's
left.
Closer by about 100 yards and
friendlier is Denny's (426 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto). Denny's is also
cheaper than Lyons, has food that's at
least as good or better, tackier vinyl
and that all-star late-night waitress,
Ova.
So why go to Lyons (4298 El
Camino Real, Los Altos) at all? Because
sometimes you need a change. Lyons is
darker, the waitresses are younger.
And if you're determined to eat a lot of
food at 4 a.m. and get really sick,
there's nothing like a Mighty Lion
Burger. The patty melt is also pretty
neat.
The only competition left for these
corporate monsters is the University
Creamery (209 University Ave , Palo
Alto), which sensed the vacuum and
went to 24 hour service about two
\ears ago. The Creamer) has pretty
mediocre greasy-spoon food, but the

milkshakes are (they use Buds
ice cream) and it's a lot closer to
campus — within biking range, even.
Plus you can call your friends and
loved ones on the phones supplied to
each h(H>th.
Meltdown
Everyone loves ice cream, to he
sure, but no one can deny that the
Stanford area is practically drowning in
the stuff. Within a quick drive of
campus are a Haagen-Dazs (Stanford
Barn, 700 Welch Rd.), two Swenson's
(440 University Ave., Palo Alto and
1350 El Camino Real, Menlo Park),
Blatz Folded Ice Cream (101 Califor
nia Ave., Palo Alto), Double Rainbow
(1083 El Camino Real, Menlo Park), the
Peninsula Creamery (566 Emerson
St., Palo Alto), Rick's Rather Rich Ice
Cream (Charleston at Middlefield,
Palo Alto), Edy's (73 Town and
Country Village, Palo Alto) and the Uni
versity Creamery.
Then there are these Italian ice
cream shops: Gelato La Romanina
(1700 El Camino Real, Menlo Park),
Tempo Gelato (2245 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto, Gelato Classico (437 Emer
son St., Palo Alto) and Bravo Fono (99
Stanford Shopping Center). Two or
three more have probably opened up
since you've started reading this.
With such a wide variety to choose
from, you might sample everything
and then decide. Two things to keep in
mind: The ice cream at the Peninsula
Creamery is smooth, rich and deli
cious, and the homemade waffle cones
at Blatz are not too be missed.
Spirits in a material world
There are as many different kinds of
bars as there are drinkers, and the
most popular ones — the Goose and
the O — are treated elsewhere in this
article. We're concerned here with the
bar as a comfortable environment in
which to drink, as opposed to a sup
portive environment in which to get
drunk.
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton Ave.,
Palo Alto) is a snitzy restaurant by day
and a snitzy bar by night and one of the
nicest places in which to sit around in
Palo Alto. The bar at Mama's (379 Stan
ford Shopping Center) is a bit out of
the way, but it has a certain hushed
elegance that makes it attractive.
Henry's (482 University Ave., Palo
Alto) is hot and crowded once the din
ner customers clear out, but there's no
one on the make; just lots of successful
young Palo Altans enjoying their suc
cess in one of their favorite bars.
Another bar that has a "scene," but
isn't a singles bar, is that of the New
Varsity. Videos play above the bar,
musicians play in the courtyard and
lots of Paly and Gunn High punks and
assorted young people play out in the
street in front and the alley behind. It's
noisy and crowded and uncomfortable
on the weekends, but the people
watching is great. If you're looking for
something a little more staid, try the
bar at the rear of the London House
(630 Ramona St., Palo Alto), a loving re
creation of an English pub where you
can get most any British beer you want,
pub snacks and a game of darts.
Yuppie-dog eyes
Style is everything in a Yuppie hang
out, and Mac Arthur Park (27 Univer
sity Ave., Palo Alto) is in one of the ap
proved styles: big, open, white-paneled
spaces, wood floor, brass railings
everywhere. The food ranges from
mediocre to bad (except for the barbe
cued meats; be sure to order some
thing from the grill, especially the
ribs), but what does it matter when you
can get potato skins and eight wines by
the glass? Another style is represented
by Waverley Place (560 Waverley St.,
Palo Alto), which is all glass and
bleached wood and offers expensive
(but surprisingly good) pastas and
seafood dishes.
Along with these younger restau
rants, a couple of established Palo Alto
restaurants have swung with the times:
The Gatehouse, one of Palo Alto's

prettiest places to eat and drink, is
taken over by the young come dinner
hour, and Henry's is a favorite with
the local advertising/design commu
nity that lives off Silicon Valley.
Thanks but no thanks
Sometime while you're here some
one will suggest going to one of these
restaurants. Politely tell him/her you'd
rather undergo root canal work.
Dinah's Shack (4629 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto) is one of those inex
plicably popular restaurants — I can
see why little old ladies go there, but
why in God's name would anyone else
want to spend upwards of $10 for a
lousy buffet and the chance to hear
"Feelings played on the harp? Ecco
Ristorante (4290 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto, right across the street in the Hyatt
Palo Alto) may be the worst Italian res
taurant in the world, and the green car
pet doesnt help (Beware restaurants
with idiosyncratic spelling in their
names) King Chuan (75 Town and
Country Village, Palo Alto) had at last
count three laudator, Stanford Daily
reviews posted in its window. Don't
believe a word of them.
