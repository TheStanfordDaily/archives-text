# Nightlife:
## When the sun sets, the Bay Area wakes up 
### 
C an Francisco's nightclubs, even more
than Herb Caen and the Zodiac Kil
ler, distinguish this city from every in
habited community outside of New York
state lines. The City has more nightclubs
than Los Angeles — a city with eight
times as many inhabitants.

Of course, it is difficult to find your
way around when you don't always
know where to go. Here, then, is a
guide to local hot spots worth fre
quenting.
If you enjoy hazards and want to go
out of your way to create them, then the
Mabuhay Gardens is waiting for you
with open safety pins. Five or six years
after the fact, punk music seems to
have settled its feud with (and ac
knowledged its debt to) heavy metal.
Perhaps in deference to this newly dis
covered patrimony (or perhaps to the
sacred cash cow of the concert-going
public), punk clubs often have "metal
nights" and everyday audiences these
days have more of an axle-grease aura
around them, which is actually perfect
for the Mabuhay Gardens. The Fab Mab
is like a slightly oversized garage, with
brick walls and a self-consciously dan
gerous air about it.
The bands have the best names in
the Bay Area, though certainly not top
tonal quality. Still thriving as a
Polynesian restaurant by
day/leatherette cave by night, the club
is best for those who understand the
colossal joke taking place six or seven
nights a week. That's entertainment.
Roosting at the mouth of Broadway,
the Fab Mab also serves as an introduc
tion to the North Beach area of the
City, where most of the real nightclubs
reside. Right across the street from the
Mab is The Stone.
The Stone is sort of a hybrid; it has
the physical qualities of its immediate
neighbor, but the music selection of a
decidedly pop flavor.
If you go down Broadway a few
blocks (negotiating your way past the
massage parlors and Carol Doda) and
turn onto Columbus, you'll eventually
pass Wolfgang's, the physical succes
sor to the Boarding House (901 Co
lumbus) and the spiritual heir to the

Old Waldorf as Bill Graham's Home
for Acts That Can't Sell Out the
Coliseum. Amazingly enough, few of
the many sins of the father are visited
upon the latest offspring; the sound is
decent, the stage and lighting very
good, and there's even a balcony for
those who really don't go to clubs to
see the band. The only caveats to the
clubber are well-known to Waldorf
denizens: Beware the chairs (bicycle
seats with legs), the drink minimum
(the "Calistoga with Orage Flavor"
tastes like it should have the word
"agent" in its title somewhere) and the
food (Chicken Lollipops? McPutrid).
Better chairs and bigger shows can
be found at the other Graham venue,
the Kabuki Nightclub at the Japan
Center near Geary Street. Located sig
nificantly west of North Beach, the
Kabuki nonetheless has even more
traditional nightclub aesthetics; it's big
and flashy, like the nightclubs in 1930s
musicals, with lots of tables for the
Nicholas Brothers to dance across. It's
a bit odd to see Greg Kihn play a place
that should have Billie Holliday, but it's
still a roomy, nice club. The videos in
the lobby help as well, as does the
Japantown Bowling Alley across the
street (open until 4 a.m. on Wednes
days and Thursdays and 24 hours a day
weekends).
If you accept the above three ele
ments — music, rock video and
bowling — as a sort of a holy trinity of
night-on-the-town experiences, then
the Park Bowl on Haight Street was
designed with you in mind. Located a
couple of blocks away from the I-
Beam, one of the more elaborate
dance clubs on the scene (forget the
bands — the stage is a show in itself),
the Park Bowl is your basic, well
mannered direct-from-Muncie, Ind.,
bowling alley during the week.
But on Friday and Saturday nights,

the lights go down, the volume goes
up and a 12-foot video screen des
cends and hovers over the center
lanes. It and satellite TV sets around
the alley show rock videos and the like
while the paying customers ($6 cover
charge for admission and about two
hours of tenpinning) take their turns at
the line and dance hack to their seats.
There's a bar, too, for the athletically
inclined. As a concept, the Park Bowl is
fascinating; it inspires the kind of
never-there-but-nostalgic-anyway sight
that you only hear outside old drive-in
hamburger stands and Broadway
revivals. Moreover, the darn thing
works; it's a lot of fun, and you very
rarely get a chance to think what a
stupid game bowling is. If nightclub
bing is the art of distraction, the Park
Bowl on Friday and Saturday nights
should be bronzed.
Don't think of this nightclubbing
guide as more than a series of press
box tracer shells, however; you're
going to have to make the rounds
yourself. In your search, you'll prob
ably find clubs off the beaten path, and
certainly ones not mentioned here.
The North Beach area has most of the
big clubs, for example, but there's a
better variety of acts south of Market
Street around the China Basin (where
the Giants want to insert a new domed
baseball stadium). The only problem
with this area is that most of the
"clubs" are converted warehouses,
with few comforts and even fewer ways
of finding out about performances. If
you can learn your way around there,
you'll be in an "in crowd" that's so in,
no one knows it's there.
In any case, there are some relatively
hard-and-fast (as opposed to soft-and
slow) rules about finding a particular
roost for your night-owl habits.
Rule No. 1 of nightclub choosery
specifically prohibits parties of the first
part from following only high-fame
quotient stars. High-fame quotient
stars usually end up in stadiums, with
high-boredom quotient warm-up acts

— you must remember that nightclubs
depend on medium-small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally has to do
only with album sales, however, as
does the "high-fame quotient" — the
point is that you ought not wait all year
for your favorite group. They'll sell out
anyway, if they play in a nightclub, so
what true clubbers ought to do is ex
periment with their ears.
And you should know in advance
that Rule No. 2 is not for a great many
people. It requires that you admit the
existence of a flaw. Yet it is important,
and we should shed our misconcep
tions eventually. So remember this —
despite the popularity of component
stereo systems with multi-colored dials
and switches, most of humanity is
unable to tell a good sound system
from a Dixie cup on a string. It follows
from this fact that although sound sys
tems vary in nightclubs, to most people
it doesn't really matter.
Consider an example. The Great
American Music Hall on O'Farrell
Street has definite acoustic drawbacks,
despite its habit of featuring high
quality acoustic musicians. But did you
ever year anyone complain about it?
The beautiful gold-leaf interior at the
Hall can sometimes send a trumpet
solo into an ear at a disconcerting mo
ment. But it simply doesn't need per
fect acoustics, because there are very
few perfect ears.
Those so blessed can find what they
need at nearly every jazz club. (One of
the best, the Keystone Korner, on
Vallejo in North Beach, closed a while
back due to some disagreements with
the IRS. Its successor seems to be
Kimball's, on Grove Street, which
generally books Bay Area jazz types
like Jessica Williams and Joe Hender
son, along with national figures.) Jazz
places are frequented by people who
demand near-perfect acoustics — they
have it because they need it, but other
places don't.
So that's Rule 2, to be noted espe
cially by rock fans.
