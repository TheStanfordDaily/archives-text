# Now playing at a theater near you
## 
### 
here are enough moviehouses
within biking distance of cam
pus to enable you to see a diffe
rent movie every night of the week,
week after week. (And I should know
— I've done just about that for the last
four years.) Our moviegoing experi
ence is invariably affected by the condi
tions in which we view the movie: how
big is the screen? Is the sound system
worth listening to? Do the people who
work at the concession stand have
body odor? What follows is a review
not of movies but of the theaters that
show them.
As good a place to start as any is right
here on campus. Many Stanford or
ganizations sponsor weekly film series.
Admission prices— usually $1 or $1.50
— are virtually unbeatable. Campus
film series advertise via flyers posted
around campus and advertisements in
the Daily..
The ASSU Sunday Flicks, which
are scheduled — surprise! — every
Sunday night in Memorial Auditorium
during the quarter, feature new or
nearly new releases. Memorial Au
ditorium has a good sound system and
a fairly large screen. One disadvantage
to the Flicks (and to other campus
series) is that they sometimes show,
without giving advance warning, 16
millimeter prints of widescreen films
— giving the movie a crop job that, at
best, is ugly. The Flicks' concessions
stand offers the basic popcorn/candy/
diet 7-Up stuff, so bring your quarters.
The Stanford Film Society's
Monday Night Movie Masterpieces
screen in Kresge Auditorium. Kresge,
which is in the Law School Building,
has comfortable seats, a smallish sc
reen, and an acceptable sound system.
The movie masterpieces include film
classics from the last 80 years — this is
a good place to catch up on those
movies you ve always heard about but
have never been able to see. Program
notes telling about the movie are usu
ally handed out at the door.
The French and Italian Film
Series is scheduled for either Tuesday
or Wednesday night during the quarter
and screens in Bishop Auditorium in
the Graduate School of Business. The
series schedules subtitled foreign films
which usually include a good mix of
better and lesser-known films and di
rectors. The audience at this series
often laughs at jokes that haven't been
included in the subtitles, which is

sometimes a little intimidating (or, if
you like, irritating) to those of us who
are fluent in neither French nor Italian.
Bishop auditorium is quite small, the
j»ound system is OK, and, unless
they've repaired it, the screen has a
nasty-looking gash in it.
The Law School Film Series is
presented on Friday nights in Kresge
Auditorium. This is the most eclectic of
campus film series, screening "The
Philadelphia Story" one week and
"Dirty Harry meets the Kung Fu Kil
lers" the next. The announcements
made prior to the movies — the part
where they tell you not to eat or smoke
and to come next week — are almost
always worth the price of admission.
The Chaparral Saturday Night
Movies appear in Cubberlev Au

ditorium, which is quite possibly the
worst place to see a movie at Stanford.
The screen is small and dingy, and the
sound system has a self-censorship cir
cuit which allows only one out of three
words to reach your ears intelligibly.
This is unfortunate, for the Chaparral
series shows current and not-so
current movies that are usually more
adventuresome and interesting (if you
forget about things like "Knute Rockne,
All American," which is nobody's idea
of a good joke) than the ones shown at
the Sunday Flicks.
Other film series on campus may
appear on a one-quarter basis. One
year, for example, the Stanford
Cinematheque, sponsored by
STARTS, scheduled a well-attended
Hitchcock film series and several ani

mation and experimental film series.
The Bechtel International Center usu
ally presents the Third World Film
Series on Thursday evenings.
Watch for flyers around campus
and read The Daily's "Once Around
the Quad" section for information
about these programs.
Theaters in Palo Alto, Menlo
Park, and Mountain View are all
within biking distance of the
Stanford campus. Admission
prices hover in the $4 to $5 range,
and many theaters offer discounts
for the first show of the day or on
one evening a week.
Palo Alto has one repertory
movie house, which shows good
movies from a range of eras, styles,

and languages. The New Varsity
Theater, on University Avenue, might
have been what God was thinking
about when he nvented movies. It has
a huge screen, a fine sound system, and
conscientious projectionists who al
most always manage to keep most of
the image in focus. The concessions
stand boasts popcorn and ice cream,
and the New Varsity's espresso bar can
get you wired all night. Movies gener
ally screen for one or two evenings be
fore being replaced by another double
bill.
The Aquarius Twin Theaters, on
Emerson, program first-run Hollywood
and foreign films. Both theaters are
shaped like shoeboxes, the shoebox
on the left being a little larger than the
shoebox on the right. The theaters
have a problem with sound leaking
through the wall they share — it often
happens that the mood music from the
Aquarius 1 mingles promiscuously
with the mood music from the
Aquarius 2.
The Bijou Theater, also on Emer
son, might remind you of an au
ditorium in an Appalachian high
school (never having been in an Ap
palachian high school, I can't be en
tirely certain). The walls and ceiling
are bare plywood, the house lighting is
aggressively institutional, and the seats,
when you lean back in them, let out a
short sigh of pain. During slow parts in
movies these noises waft through the
theater like moans from the spirit of
the lower back.
The Palo Alto Square Theaters,
on El Camino, are newer, very nice,
and a little boring, which describes
many of the movies which play there.
The screens are large (the left screen,
like the Aquarius', is bigger than the
one on the right: I think I see a trend
developing here), and the sound sys
tem entirely adequate. The shared wall
is thick enough to exclude all but the
most violent sound from leaking from
one theater into the other. The conces
sion stand is well-stocked and conser
vative (very heavy on Coca Cola and
M&M's) but features frozen bon-bons,
which true devotees will claim are
more than enough to make up for the
Square's stale popcorn.
The Fine Arts Theater, on Califor
nia Avenue, often shows pretty good
movies. It often shows these pretty
good movies for a very long time —
"La Cage Aux Folles," for example

played for over a year, and "Autumn
Sonata" saw some warm summer even
ings before it departed. The Fine Arts
ticket takers tend to be surly, and be
fore each movie they project slides of
what appear to be anatomical drawings
of worms (honest!).
There are two first-run moviehouses
in Menlo Park, about 20 minutes away
by bike. The Park and the Guild are
both on El Camino. The Park, with its
curved roof, is like a reconditioned
aircraft hanger, which makes it a great
place to see high-tech cinema. The nice
folks at the Park have placed an illumi
nated clock at the left of the au
ditorium, which is great for people
who schedule dental appointments in
the middle of movies and not so great
for everyone else.
The Guild is smaller than the Park,
but of late has tended to be nicer (for a
long time it was permeated by a faintly
urinous odor, as if a contaminated
popcorn shipment had been stashed in
the restroom. Whatever the problem
was, I'm happy to report that it's now
been arrested).
Moving south down El Camino, one
eventually encounters Mountain view,
the home of the Old Mill 6 multi
cinema entertainment fun complex.
The Old Mill is steeped in the Howard
Johnson's school of design. The seats
in each of the six multi-cinemas are co
vered in orange plastic; they're as un
pleasant to sit in as they are to look at.
If you're tempted to put your feet upon
the seat in front of you, the Old Mill's
helpful staff of well-scrubbed teena
gers will come and politely ask you to
leave. The screens at the Old Mill, un
like those at other theaters, do not have
adjustable ratios for different wide
screen formats, which means that
when you see a cinemascope ratio film
at the Old Mill ("Star Wars," for exam
ple) you're missing both edges of the
action. The Old Mill also shows some
very good movies — but it might be
worth it to find a friend with a car so
you can see them at more humane
theaters elsewhere.
The San Francisco Chronicle pub
lishes a weekly datebook (known affec
tionately as "The Pink Section") which
gives rundowns on movies playing
around the Bay Area. The Daily pub
lishes the "CinemaScope" movie list
ing every Friday which give highly
opinionated reviews of movies playing
in the area.
