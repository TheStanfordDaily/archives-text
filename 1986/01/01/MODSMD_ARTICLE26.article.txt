Student bibliophiles (even bib
liomaniacs) are faced with an un
usual problem at Stanford. Find
ing a good bookstore near campus is
no challenge; choosing is the hard part.
Between California Avenue, in Palo
Alto, and Santa Cruz Avenue, in Menlo
Park, there are nearly 30 different
stores which sell only, or primarily,
books; and a number of other estab
lishments — thrift shops, consignment
shops, outdoor stores, etc — which
keep books on hand. Any attempt to
cover them all would be overwhelm
ing; the following account will only try
to hit the highlights.
The place to start, of course, is on
campus. The Stanford Bookstore is
both more than, and less than, a good
bookstore. More, because half of its
floor space is given over to office, art
and engineering supplies, clothing,
candy and cookies, stationery, cards,
and hundreds of useless items that say
"Stanford." The Bookstore also stocks
textbooks (upstairs), orders art prints
and does a lot of other things most
bookstores won't. It is less than a good
bookstore, however, because it isn't a
very nice place to browse for books. If
you're looking for something specific,
the selection is very good in most areas
(particularly art history and literary
criticism), but the atmosphere in the
front of the store, where the books are
shelved, is such as to force vou to find

the book you want quickly and leave.
The lighting is unpleasant, and there is
no seating of any kind; the rows of
often-crowded check-out lines make
the store resemble nothing so much as
a supermarket. It's a good place to find
a book (they will also order anything in
print), but it ranks low as a place for
looking at books.
The campus is bracketed by the
area's two best "new book''
bookstores. To the southeast, and
slightly closer, is Printers Inc. (310
California Ave.). Printers Inc. is rela
tively new (it was started by five former
Kepler's employees), and has quickly
become one of the most popular place
around, largely on the strength of its
espresso bar and artsy/literary am
biance. Printers Inc. calls itself "the
literary bookstore," and most nights
the store is full of professors of En-

glish, local artist types, a few real writ
ers and a lot of people trying hard to
look like they belong. This, to my
mind, is one of the store's drawbacks;
the other is lack of ventilation. Printers
Inc. is a hot place if you're more than
10 feet from the door. Atmospheric
conditions aside, however, Printers
Inc. is a good store, well-stocked in
most areas (hard and softcover), and
especially strong in fiction and chil
dren's books, with lots of chairs scat
tered around and nice carpeting (a rar
ity). The store has occasional Wednes
day night readings. Last, and best, is the
magazine selection. Scattered around
the front of the store are hundreds of
periodicals; they carry everything from
Arizona Highways to Die Zeit, and have
the area's best selection of scholarly
and literary journals.
Northwest of campus, along El
Camino Real in Menlo Park, lies
Kepler's. Kepler's is a local landmark,
having been a focus for "radical" activ
ity in the 19605. The store has moved
with the times; its image is now com

posed of equal parts of environmental
awareness, small-scale technology ad
vocacy and championship of small and
avant-garde presses.
The main bragging point at Kepler's,
as far as books go, is its claim to be the
biggest paperback bookstore around.
Most people don't find the whole store
their first visit; eventually, on their sec
ond or third trip, they stumble into the
back stacks and the other half of the
store's books.
Kepler's has a magazine selection
second only to Printers Inc. among
local bookstores, and a section devoted
to small press publications. Both stores
are open late, Printers Inc. until 11 p.m.
every night and Kepler's until 11 p.m.
weeknights and midnight weekends.

Several other "new book" stores
deserve mention. Stacy's (219 Univer
sity Ave.) has grown into a good place
to browse through a wide variety of
books.
Stacey's began as strictly a medical/
technical store, but has expanded into
most of the general areas. The techni
cal areas still seem to be the store's
strength (it has one of those ludicrous
fiction/literature splits you usually see
only in chain stores), but the photo
graphy section is worth a look.
Behind Macy's, in the Stanford
Shopping Center, you'll find Books
Inc., a hardcover/softcover store nota
ble for its paperback mystery and sci
ence fiction stocks and its remainder
tables and shelves. In the Old Mill
Shopping Center, off San Antonio Road
in Mountain View, is Upstart Crow &
Co. This bookstore/cafe has little in
the way of books, but if you have to be
in the Old Mill it's not a bad place to
get a cup of coffee.
There are chain stores in the area;
one should shun them as a matter of
principle, but occasionally a bargain
can be found on their bargain tables.
Closest to campus are B. Dalton's, in
the Stanford Shopping Center, and
Waldenbooks on California Ave.
A number of stores cater to particu
lar needs. The most common of this

type is the religious bookstore. The
One Way Bookstore (320 California
Ave.) is Christian, The Angelus (779
Santa Cruz Ave., Menlo Park) is gen
eral, and East-West Bookshop (1170
El Camino, Menlo Park) is about what
the name implies. The most interesting
store of this type that I've found is
Minerva Books (1027 Alma, Palo
Alto), a small but very attractive store
with interesting selections in mythol
ogy and all religions and without the
self-conscious "mysticism" of other
stores like itself.
A distant relative of the religious
bookstores is the science fiction and
fantasy bookstore. Comics &
Comix (405 California Ave.) has lots of
comic books, SF paperbacks, posters
and magazines; its stock runs toward
sadistic porn, and the clientele appears
to be mostly high-school age. Future
Fantasy (2 .33 El Camino, Palo Alto) is
smaller, but more serious.
All the backpacking stores (Sierra
Designs, Ski Hut, North Face) carry
books related to their specialties: hik
ing and climbing guides, nature books,
camping directories. Two places with
more extensive stocks in these areas
are the Nature Company (Stanford
Shopping Center), and the Peninsula
Conservation Center (2253 Park
Blvd., behind the Co-op). The Conser
vation Center also has a library, a gift
shop and a walk-through water-saving
garden. A few doors down from the
Center, at 2185 Park Blvd., is Penin
sula Scientific, which carries books
along with its telescopes, microscopes
and freeze-dried bacteria.
Finally, here are three miscellaneous
special-interest stores. The American
Opinion Bookstore (2656 Broadway,
Redwood City) is "the peninsula's only
conservative bookstore." Szwede
Slavic Books (2233 El Camino, Palo
Alto) is self-explanatory. And the
closest adult bookstore to campus is
the H & R Bookstore (4163 El
Camino Way, Palo Alto, a block from
Togo's), where you can also watch
movies for a quarter and buy
magazines in plastic bags for $12.50.
