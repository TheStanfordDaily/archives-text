# Safety & security
## The Stanford Farm Almanac
### 
Thefts, assaults and burglaries can
become an unfortunate pan of
your Stanford experience â€” if
you're not careful.
But a recent publication from the
Special Services Unit of Stanford's De
partment of Public Safety aims to
change all that.
The Stanford Farm Almanac is a
compilation of previous publications
concerning safety and security.
Compiled by the students who make
up the Special Services Unit, the Alma
nac contains information on dialing
911 in emergencies, using safety
services like SURE escorts, engraving
your valuables in order to deter theft,
dealing with peeping Toms and intrud
ers in the bathroom and securing your
room before heading home for vaca
tion. The booklet also contains the
Suggested Travel Routes map, which
recommends paths to take on campus.
Designed to be kept near the tele
phone for quick reference, the Alma

nac is available at Old Union, Meyer
and Green libraries and the Tresidder
information desk.
Bicycle safety
Soon after becoming familiar with
the Quad and the bookstore, Stanford
students cannot help but meet up with
the knot of on-the-hour bike traffic at
the clock tower and the nightly mess of
parked bikes at Green Library.
Bike thefts and bike accidents are
also part of the Stanford experience for
many.
For these reasons, the University
Bicycle Safety Committee and the De
partment of Public Safety's Special

Services Unit have produced a new
publication entitled Better Bicycling at
Stanford.
Better Bicycling contains practical
information of which every Stanford
student should be aware, including
tips for dealing with safety hazards on
campus, what to do if you have an acci
dent and where to park your bike (and
where not to). The book also includes
pointers on how to protect your bike
from theft, as well as very useful infor
mation such as a listing of local bike
shops and instructions on how to fix a
flat tire.

publications, contact the Special
Services Unit, 723-9633.
