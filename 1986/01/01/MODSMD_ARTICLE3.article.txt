# 200 volunteers make orientation week work
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Senior staff writer 
You're here. Orientation 1986 begins
with a blur of activity. Roommate. Food
Service. A million little errands. And
through it all, you keep noticing a bunch of
upperclassmen running around in red T
shirts Who are these people and what do they
want?
They re the almost 200 Orientation Volun
teers who will paint signs, haul garbage, pack
lunches, sing songs, explain directions and
everything else that will make your Orienta
tion fun.
And they all answer to Alison Cormack.
Alison, a junior in history and economics, is
the 1986 Freshman Orientation Coordinator.
For the last six months, she has been working
with 11 other coordinators planning this
year's Orientation.
"When I was a freshman, 1 thought that
there was an adult somewhere, organizing
things,'' Alison remembers. "But the students
do everything."
This job involves everything from planning

the tremendously popular Field Day to
dealing with guest speakers who don't like
what's for lunch. It includes designing the
» new Orientation calendar and filling out
1 "thousands' of forms. Why would anyone
I want to do it?
112 When 1 first got here, I wondered how I
■ could make a difference at this school. Now
' I've made a difference.
"I'm a leader,'' Alison said. "I can be organ
ized, and this is the biggest organizational
> nightmare that they'll let students get near at
I Stanford!
It's great that Stanford trusts the students
enough to let us do even-thing. There's a team
spirit among the volunteers ... and they don't
get paid so it's definitely for the freshmen."
"0.V." positions, as they're called, are
popular among students. Over 450 applied
last spring, and the coordinators spent up to
six hours a day for two weeks reviewing the
applications until they narrowed the accep-
Stances down to 180 students. The volunteers
have been on campus since Sept. 22, prepar
ing for the freshmen and transfers' arrivals.
Alison was an O.V. last year and loved it. "A

red T-shirt gives you a license to do things that
are crazy, because you're supposed to. You
can pull a freshman into a dance, and encour
age others to get involved.
"Other,schools ... have programs where
you go away for a few days. The purpose of
Stanford's orientation is to make you feel
welcome and at home at Stanford, and to
meet people.
Aside from planning big events like Satur
day's "Fiesta on the Farm" dance, the Orienta
tion Coordinator's position includes answer
ing countless phone calls from nervous fresh
men during the summer.
And where will Alison be during the six
days of Orientation 1986? "Who knows?" she
laughed. "My father asked if I'll have a walkie
talkie — but I'd need 70 to talk to everyone.
"I'll try to stop by all of the events. Theoreti
cally I'll just be trouble-shooting — if any
thing goes wrong, I'll hear about it!"
Alison is running through some of the
details. "We're going to have twice as much
Pepsi to drink as last year, and two times the
balloons." She smiles. "I'm so ready for them
to get here!"


Orientation volunteers have been known to welcome freshmen to the Farm by throwing them
into DeGuerre Pool at Field Day.
