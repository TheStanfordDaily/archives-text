# Stanford's blue laws
## 
### 
Puzzling over that row of bronze
numbered plaques in front of
Memorial Church? Those plaques,
set in the tiles of the Quad since 1892,
conceal one of the few remaining Stan
ford traditions.
Each graduating class over the years
has interred a time capsule containing
memorabilia of its short era at Stanford
— everything from armbands to the
"Saturday Night Fever" soundtrack,
from Lacoste shirts to punk rock parap
hernalia. The capsules are to be
reopened, one per year, starting with
the 1992 centennial of the first gradua
tion.
Another surviving tradition is one
that can be heard three times a year —
during the week before finals — Dead
Week. Groups of students, usually
dormmates gather every evening at

midnight to let the University know
how they feel by letting loose
theraputic "primal screams" that echo
eerily across campus.
The Big Game bonfire, a long-time
tradition of Big Game week, was resur
rected last year after a long absence.
But other Stanford traditions have
not stood the test of time so well and,
like many collegiate whims, have gone
the way of panty raids and streaking.
Some conventions out of the Stan
ford archives that freshmen need not
learn, but may enjoy reading about, in
clude:
• Only seniors may wear corduroy
pants.
• No freshmen men are allowed on the
Row.
• No smoking in the Quad.
• No women on the steps of the law

building (which is now the Political
Science Department).
• No corsages at Stanford dances ex
cept at the Senior Ball.
• Candy or flowers are a must for
women subjected to the indignity of
being locked out after dormitory
closing hours.
• No men allowed in women's dorms
except in social rooms.
• No women allowed alone in men's
dorms, fraternities or off campus.
• An annual Hello Day in the fall when
everyone must say hello to everyone
else.
The demise of many of these tradi
tions came with women's liberation
and the sexual revolution of the '60s.
Others just faded into a past that held
such scriptures more dearly.
However, freshmen must still be on

their guard for one tradition that is
going strong. As legend has it, in fact,
one cannot be truly called a Stanford
man or woman until one has been
kissed in the middle of the Quad at
midnight during a full moon by a
senior. Bring a bottle of champagne
and do it up right — you'll be in good
company.

Many tried, and a few true,
Stanford traditions.
