# San Francisco
## A 						guide to The City 
### 
A Stanford education is
incomplete without visiting
some of the more popular
tourist spots in the City. Just
remember: No matter how
hot it gets here, it's probably
considerably cooler in San
Francisco, so dress warmly.
And take a camera.

Alcatraz — Known as "The Rock,"
Alcatraz claims most of its fame from
the time that it was a Devil Island-style
federal penitentiary that housed such
notable criminals as The Bird Man and
Al Capone. The island also has been
used as a fortification, a U.S. miltary
prison, an Army disciplinary barracks
and a Native American stronghold. The
National Park Service conducts two
hour tours from the waterfront, but be
warned that this is one of the City's
most popular attractions and reserva
tions are hard to secure.
Cable Cars — Back in operation
after an 18-month hiatus two years ago.
To many San Franciscans, the cars are
more than a means of transportation:
They're a way of life.
Bank of America World
Headquarters — The Bank of
America complex, completed in 1969,
occupies an entire downtown block,
complete with a formal plaza
dominated by a black granite sculpture
known locally as "The Banker's Heart.''
Thousands of movie-goers witnessed
an early demise of the Bank of America
building in the movie, "The Towering
Inferno."
California Palace of the Legion
of Honor — The Palace, perched
close to Land's End in the western part
of the City, houses an extensive collec
tion of Rodin bronzes including "The
Thinker."
The Cannery — A defunct Del
Monte cannery transformed into a
galleria of shops and restaurants, The
Cannery continues the Ghirardelli
tradition of urban redevelopment.
Mimes and musicians perform regu
larly in the complex's square.
Chinatown — A long-time resident
of Hong Kong once said that San Fran
cisco's Chinatown reminded him of
home — the rush-hour traffic jams on
the main thoroughfare, Grant Avenue,
rivaled any bicycle or automobile tie
up a Chinese city* could muster. But
Grant Avenue also offers a kaleido
scope of Asian delights — dim sum
bars, restaurants, pharmacies display
ing pickled snake, people inspecting
the Chinese cabbage in front of
grocery stores while pressed ducks
hang in the windows. The streets
radiating out from Grant Avenue house

one of the largest Chinese populations
outside of China and afford plenty of
opportunity for exploring.
Civic Center — After the 1906
earthquake and fire, the city planners
wanted to remake the town into a
modern Athens. The Civic Center is
only a small part of the elaborate com
plex planned. San Franciscans boast
that City Hall, with its ornamented
dome, gargoyled finials and marble
balustrade, is the finest example of
French Romanesque architecture
outside of Europe. The elaborate
federal and state office buildings, Civic
Auditorium, Brooks Exhibit Hall,
Public Library and Performing Art Cen
ter echo this traditional theme. The
glass and concrete Louise M. Davies
Symphony Hall is a modern departure.
Coit Tower/Telegraph Hill
—The Bohemian section of San Fran
cisco, the circuitous streets and cliff
hanging houses of Telegraph Hill, has
been inhabited by successive genera
tions of flower children, artists and
literati. The upper area around Coit
Tower, a monument to the city's early
volunteer firefighters, has developed
into a patchwork of posh apartments.
Ferry building — In the days
before rush-hour traffic clogged the
Bay and Golden Gate Bridges, the ferry
building annually processed more
than 50 million commuters from the
East Bay and Marin County. Today, a
Bay Bridge approach obscures this
monument at the foot of Market Street.
Although the Golden Gate Ferry
operates out of its south side, most of
the building is now used as office
space,
Fisherman's Wharf — Salty fisher
men, seagulls and the pungent smell of

freshly cleaned fish once dominated
San Francisco's wharf. Although the
nearby slips still berth trawlers, the
surrounding wharf area has been taken
over by wax museums, carnival-type
rides and tourist shops. Yet the 19th
century museum ship Balclutha harks
back to old days, and some of the City's
best restaruants are still to be found
along The Wharf.
Fort Point — This three-tiered
brick fort at one time held vigil over
the Golden Gate against invaders. Now
dwarfed by the Golden Gate Bridge,
the building has been made a national
historic site. Tours are conducted be
tween 10 a.m. and 5 p.m.
49 Mile Drive — This half-day tour
is a planned drive through the most fa
mous landmarks of the City. An excel
lent introduction to San Francisco, the
route starts on Van Ness Avenue at the
Civic Center and is clearly marked by
blue and white seagull signs.
George R. Moscone Convention
Center — A $126 million affirmation
that San Francisco is indeed a tourist
town. The site for the 1984 Democratic
National Convention, Moscone Center
houses an exhibit hall, 41 meeting
rooms, a ballroom and a special events
theater. The facility is named after the
late mayor of San Francisco, who was
assassinated by then San Francisco Su
pervisor Dan White.
Ghirardelli Square — Here is
where 19th-century laborers once
made chocolate, packaged spices and
wove fine woolens. Twentieth-century
visitors to Ghirardelli Square now
browse in the Mustard Building, watch
street performers in the plaza next to
the Woolen Building and buy Ghirar
delli (pronounced Gear-ar-dely) choc
olate in the old Chocolate Building.
The brick buildings of the old factory
were restored in 1962, setting an ex
ample for urban reclamation all over
the world.
Golden Gate Bridge — Visitors are
often disappointed to discover the
bridge is not so-named because it is
painted gold but because the sun sets
in the Golden Gate ... but not always.
The Gate is often "socked in" by fog, to
the dismay of tourists dressed for Cali
fornia sun.
Japan Town/Center — Japan
Center and the revitalized Japan Town
join to create a Mecca for the
thousands of Japanese businessmen
and tourists who visit San Francisco
each year. The complex of hotels,
theaters, shops and restaurants offer
some of the best saimen noodles and
electronic goods this side of the
Pacific.
Lombard Street — This twister
descends Russian Hill from Hyde
Street, with 10 hairpin turns in a single
block. Constructed, some say by a mis
chievous city planner, the street now
terrifies student drivers all over the
city.
Mission Dolores —Junipero Serra
founded this in 1776 as part of Spain's
colonization effort in the New World.
During his lifetime, this Franciscan
missionary started a whole chain of
missions stretching along El Camino
Real — "The King's Highway" — all
the way to Baja, California.
Nob Hill — The exclusive Com
monwealth Club, the lavish Fairmont
Hotel, the Huntington Hotel, four-star
restaurant Alexis and apartments with
rents as spectacular as their views. All
these attract San Francisco's glitterati to
Nob Hill, one of the City's most elegant
spots.

Old Mint — Though it was phased
out of operation in 1937, the Old Mint
was revamped and reopened as a
museum in 1973. Its exhibits include
period rooms, a pyramid of gold bars,
Old West artifacts, the mint's Special
Coins and Metals Division and mone
tary treasures of all kinds.
The Palace of Fine Arts —
Created as the diadem of the 1915
Pacific Exposition, a central rotunda
embracing a Corinthian colonnade
ornamented with freizes and statuary
constitute the Palace. By the 19405,
these original plaster structures had
been reduced to ruins by the winds
sweeping through the Golden Gate.
During the '60s, a sentimental move
ment mobilized to have the monument
restored in pre-cast concrete. The sup
porting buildings now house the Ex
ploratorium, a "hands-on" science
museum.
Pier 39 — Pier 39 surrounds its
mall of shops and restaurants with the
trappings of a turn-of-the-century
street scene. Built on a 1,000-foot-long
pier, the mall offers sweeping views of
the Bay and the City.
Polk Street — In the pre
supermarket era, this avenue once sup
ported a posh shopping district cater
ing to the well-to-do residents of Rus
sian Hill and Nob Hill. Bath houses and
gay activists have since supplanted the
fur-coated housewives and chic shops.
Though the shops have changed with
the local tastes and demands, many fas
hionable boutiques and gourmet res
taurants still line Polk Street.
Transamerica Pyramid — The tal
lest building in the San Francisco
skyline, the 48 stories of the Pyramid
slant skyward to form an unusual
"skysaving" wedge. This design, a com
pany symbol for the Transamerica Cor
poration, and the building's juxtaposi
tion with the low-rise Jackson Square,
caused considerable controversy.
Twin Peaks — A cliche necking
and drinking hangout Friday and Satur
day nights, Twin Peaks offers an in
toxicating vista of the Bay Area from
the Marin headlands to the Santa Clara
Valley. During the day, a drive around
the figure-eight road that collars the
peaks is an excellent way to get your
bearings on a first trip.
Union Square — This is San Fran
cisco's Fifth Avenue. Some of the City's
most swank shops and hotels — I Mag
nin's (complete with a marble
paneled, gold-fixtured bathroom),
Saks Fifth Avenue, the Hotel St. Francis,
Elizabeth Arden's — front the square
of the nearby streets.
Washington Square — Schoolgirls
coming out of confession in the adja
cent Church of Saints Peter and Paul,
grandfathers feeding the pigeons and
hucksters from the red-light district on
the nearby Broadway all circulate
through the piazza of San Francisco's
"Little Italy," the North Beach District.
After gorging on pasta in one of the ex
cellent area cafes, visit Washington
Square to digest your meal and soak
up some of the local color.
