# At party's end, don't miss these 10

Your academic advisor may tell you to fill your eight
area requirements quickly, and you may decide in
stead to delve immediately into your own particular
area of study. v
But whatever classes you opt to take, do not overlook the
10 courses on the following list. Most are universally
popular. All are unique and memorable.
Psychology 001: Genera! Psychology. Philip Zim
bardo. Traditionally, one of the most popular courses on
campus, this class is particularly known for the professor's
charisma, unusual lectures and use of demonstrations. There
is never a dull moment.
Art 001: Introduction to Art. Lorenz Eitner. This topi
cal introductory course is a popular fall quarter class. His
tory and appreciation of architecture, sculpture and painting
are stressed. Students planning to enroll in any other art his
tory courses should plan to take this one first.
History 172 A: America Since 1945. Barton Bernstein.
Prof. Bernstein is loved and hated, but is always admired.
The revisionist historian is one of the best organized and
most dynamic lecturers on campus. Just about everyone
who has taken this class agrees that this is one of their
favorites. Arrogant or not, Bernstein certainly gets you think
ing. Beware: Reading is formidable and the grading even
tougher. And don't schedule a class right afterwards.
Bernstein has been know to lecture overtime frequently.
Political Science 35: How Nations Deal With Each
Other. Stephen Krasner. For the ambitious student new
to Stanford, this political science course in an excellent
choice. The subject of world politics is examined through a
variety of approaches, including realism, idealism, Marxism
and bureaucratic politics. Krasner is bold and provocative
with his comments, making this a not-to-be-missed class —
albeit with a good deal of work.
Civil Engineering 170: Environment, Science and
Technology. Gil Masters. A tremendously popular, non
technical introduction to the causes and effects of environ
mental pollution. The course covers issues such as over
population and food distribution that prospective interna
tional relations and political science majors might enjoy
studying from a scientific perspective.

Political Science 138 A: Arms Control and Disarma
ment. Coit Blacker and John Lewis. This course, taught
by interdisciplinary faculty and enlivened by guest lecturers
with negotiating and scientific experience, is comprehen
sive and thought-provoking, although you will probably
spend not a few hours memorizing military facts and
acronyms.
English 173: Shakespeare. Ronald Rebholz. Even if you
took Shakespeare in highschool, this class is worth a repeat
performance. Rebholz has earned a reputation as a colorful
and opinionated lecturer who brings new insight to your
understanding of the Bard. Shakespeare courses covering
different plays are offered each quarter, with Rebholz teach
ing only one of them. Reading of selected scenes are sched
uled at the end of each week. Take this class even if you've
read some of the plays before.
Political Science 001: Major Issues of American
Public Policy. Hubert MarshalL Marshall's dynamic lec
turing style, his insights on the Vietnam War and his acces
sibility combine to make this a "must" class. Be prepared to
do lots of reading, including a large amount of Alexis de To
queville. But also be prepared to learn a great deal about
poverty, monopolies, foreign policy and the distribution of
power in American politics and the economy.
Values, Technology and Society 101: Contemporary
Technological Society. Robert McGinn. This course is
an interdisciplinary survey of social, cultural and value is
sues concerning society of the '80s. The section discussions
about issues — ones you might not have realized were
worth discussing — such as test tube babies, the Concorde
jet and snowmobiles — are particularly enlightening. The
reading load is average, but more time-consuming is the
preparation for a 10-minute speech as past of a debate that
the class holds annually.
Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation 56:
Windsurfing. Joseph Petrucci. Spring quarter at Stan
ford is the time to get outside and experience afternoons on
Lake Lag. What better way to do it than California style? Many
students here would tell you not to leave the Farm without
learning how to windsurf. The only problem is that there
are more than 5,000 undergraduates here, and lots of them
want to learn to sail on a surfboard, so sign up early if you
want to become part of a Stanford cliche.
