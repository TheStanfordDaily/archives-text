# That other school across the Bay: UC-Berkeley
## 
### 
By almost any
measure,
Berkeley's
reputation is
well-known —

and well
deserved.

The streets, including Telegraph,
the city's central thoroughfare,
are painted with a certain amount
of "human color," some of it psyche
delic. For starters, the "Red Man" can
be seen virtually any day parading
through the Berkeley streets, dressed
from head to toe in a vibrant shade of
scarlet, carrying on his back a stuffed
puppet the size of an infant.
"Crazy William" is rumored to have
been a philosophy graduate student
who "went over the edge." He painted
his clothes and face with dollar-size
red polka dots and now camps out on
Telegraph, making faces at people and
drawing attention to himself any way
he can.
"You have to be normal to stand out

at Berkeley," many University of Cali
fornia freshman are told, and despite
the large student population, some un
doubtedly find this the case.
Berkeley is still a Mecca for political
demonstrators and activists. Few
causes seem to go unnoticed. Support
ers of everything — from the nuclear
freeze to complete divestment of UC
investments from companies that do
business in South Africa — establish
themselves in Sproul Plaza, the focal
point of the Cal campus. During the
late morning and early afternoon, it is
difficult to cross this stretch of pave
ment without being asked to sign any
number of political petitions.
Although many of those new to the
area may find this process intimidating,
the majority of students tend to
develop "defense tactics" to ward of
the more adamant demonstrators.
Clutching textbooks and notepads, stu
dents can be seen with heads bent and
eyes focused firmly on the ground in
front of them as they stride quickly
through a crowd of petition-bearing
activitists.
The majority of those people often
considered "unusual" are probably
harmless, provided they are not
provoked. Just to make sure, residents
offer visiting outsiders a safety tip:
Whatever you do or see, always
avoid eye contact!
Eat the Weenies
For all their faults, there is at least
one thing Berkeley residents do right:
make good food. Since the arrival of

Alice Waters, the owner of the word
famous Chez Pannisse, Berkeley has
blossomed with quality eateries of
every shape and ethnic origin.
Some claim Berkeley's good eats can
be traced to all those '60s radical who
realized at some point that they had to
make a living, years of preparing or
ganic food finally came in handy.
Whether or not this is actually the
source of the local cuisine revolution,
fresh ingredients and an innovative at
titude are common to every respected
restaurant in the area.
Even if you only stay in Berkeley
long enough to want to go home, you
are going to have to eat at some time.
If you want to risk going to one of
the student hangouts, try Kip's or Larry
Blakes, both within a few blocks of
Sproul Plaza. For a student bar, check
into Henry's or Spatz.
From morning 'til evening
Going out to breakfast has become
an art in the land of the Golden Bear.
Places like Bette's Ocean View Diner
and the Buttercup Bakery serve com
plete breakfasts with various omelettes
and high-quality pastries. And, if you
have the time too sit down, you might
try Ramona's, but remember that this
restaurant has no connections to its
Palo Alto namesake. The brunch menu
includes egg specialties, including
Eggs Benedict ($6.50). Less expensive
are omelettes, which start at $3.75 and
are served with homefires and your
choice of bread or pastry. If you want
authentic Chicago-style pizza and it's

after 11:30 a.m., you're in luck.
Ramona's has an original recipe that is
the restaurant's claim to fame.
Lunch and dinner open up a whole
range of possibilities. If you like
Mexican food and places with atmos
phere, Carlos Murphy's is conveniently
located right off the freeway at the
Emeryville exit, just as you approach
Berkeley. Carlos Murphy's has a beauti
ful view of the Bay and San Francisco
and takes its name from its theme; it's
an Irish-Mexican cafe. The decor and
menu reflect this zany idea. About one
third of the restaurant is devoted to an
extremely active bar.
King Tsin is possibly the oldest and
most successful of Berkeley's Chinese
restaurants. Don't be fooled by the
snazzy facade; that just went up about
three years ago. The same man has
stood at the register for years, and yes,
he really does use the abacus on the
counter to check his addition. King
Tsin is on Solano Avenue, among many
other Eastern restaurants; if you can't
get a table right away, you have plenty
of other choices within walking dis
tance.
Coffee Break
In the home city of Peets Coffee,
cafes abound. Cafe Roma, the old
standby on College and Durant, is
being challenged by the up-and
coming Old Blue Cafe, which also
features dessert. There are outdoor
tables at both places, so you're never
too far from Red Man and Crazy
William.
