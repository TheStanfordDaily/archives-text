# Building your own LOFT
## 
### 
For the love of lofts and for those
of you who passed woodshop (do
they still have that in high
school?): With the side benefit of
making maximum use of your un
doubtedly too-small University
housing quarters, here's a diversion of
sorts for craftsmen and homebodies.
In case you're not familiar with the
term, lofts are beds on stilts so to
speak; they may be very simple struc
tures designed to enhance storage
space or finely crafted pieces of furni
ture adding a touch of class to your
modest accomadations.
It shouldn't take too long to build
one, really, and then you'll have more
space for other diversions like yoga or
a stereo system.

By far the dorm which has the most
lofts is Toyon, due to its cathedrales
que ceilings which tend to give loftless
residents the "closing in walls" feeling.
They're actually a fairly recent inven
tion — only becoming popular in the
past 10 years or so.
Lofts come in all shapes and sizes:
single lofts for one bed, double lofts
for two, "L-shaped" lofts with a mez
zanine for studying and reading, split
level lofts, and lofts with built-in bars,
staircases and even waterbeds.
If you don't want to spend the
money to buy a ready-made loft, it's not
that difficult to build one yourself.
Lumber and tools are available from
local merchants, and tools like power
saws and drills can be rented.

"So how do I build a loft?" The basic
ingredients of a one-story, single bed
loft are:
• a 4xB sheet of plywood 3/8-inch thick
or thicker (fibre board is heavy and
cumbersome)
• 4x4 posts cut to the desired height
• 2x4 or 2x6 boards to support the
plywood, Ix 4 or 2x4 boards to use as
cross-bracing to prevent sway
• joist hangers
• nails (or wood screws) and lag bolts
• carpet to finish off the platform.
The first thing to build is the frame
to support the platform.
There are two basic frames to
choose from: (A) a frame.of 2x4s with
outside dimensions of 4xB ft. or (B) a
2x6 or 2xB outer frame with inside di

mensior.s 4xB ft.
The advantage to B is that the
plywood may be set inside the outer
frame, leaving a rim around the plat
form which not only keeps the mat
tress from sliding off but precludes the
use of nails to anchor the plywood to
the frame. This saves set-up and tear
down time.
For both frames (A and B), cut the
corners so the shorter 2x4s fit inside
the long ones. The nicest and easiest
way to secure the outside corners,
though slightly more expensive, is to
use lag bolts.
At the end of the long boards, drill
two holes into the face. Make the
diameter of the holes smaller than that
of the bolt. Make sure the lag bolts are

long enough to extend into the end of
the shorter boards and provide a
strong joint.
The next step for both A and B is to
install joists at 20-inch intervals to sup
port the platform. Be sure to leave at
least four inches clear at each end for
the loft legs.
Joists are usually 2x4s supported by
joist hangers anchored to the long
boards of the frame. The joists must
provide a level surface for the plywood
platform.
For a 2x4 outer frame (A), make sure
the joist hangers are nailed in so that
the inner 2x4 joists will fit flush with
the top of the frame. First, measure and
mark position of the joist hangers with
a small 2x4 block.
Now cut the 2x4 joists to fit snugly
within the outer frame, resting on the
joist hangers. As long as the corners are
secure, the joists need not be nailed.
On frames with top-flush joists (A),
plywood platforms must be nailed or
screwed down. For a loft with a wide
outer frame (B), the plywood platform
may be set on top of the joists inside
the frame.

Next, the legs must be in
stalled and braced. Use 4x4
posts. Set them inside the
frame at the corners, with
the top of the posts on the
same level as the joists.
Drill holes for at least
two lag bolts per leg, or use
at least four 16-inch penny
nails.
Braces should run
diagonally from the top of
one leg to the bottom of the
opposite leg. From the long
side, use a 2x4 for the
diagonal brace; on the
ends, a Ix 4 is fine.

If you want built-in shelves, cut a 2x4
or 2x6 to fit between the legs and nail
or bolt it in. This will also give added
support.
For a ladder, cut several blocks of
equal length for stairs (wider stairs are
nicer). Cut two more 2x4's for ladder
uprights (avoid splintery wood) and
mark off steps at regular intervals. The
ladder can be nailed together since it's
small enough to store.

small enough to store.

For the love of lofts and for those
of you who passed woodshop (do
they still have that in high
school?): With the side benefit of
making maximum use of your un
doubtedly too-small University
housing quarters, here's a diversion of
sorts for craftsmen and homebodies.
In case you're not familiar with the
term, lofts are beds on stilts so to
speak; they may be very simple struc
tures designed to enhance storage
space or finely crafted pieces of furni
ture adding a touch of class to your
modest accomadations.
It shouldn't take too long to build
one, really, and then you'll have more
space for other diversions like yoga or
a stereo system.

By far the dorm which has the most
lofts is Toyon, due to its cathedrales
que ceilings which tend to give loftless
residents the "closing in walls" feeling.
They're actually a fairly recent inven
tion — only becoming popular in the
past 10 years or so.
Lofts come in all shapes and sizes:
single lofts for one bed, double lofts
for two, "L-shaped" lofts with a mez
zanine for studying and reading, split
level lofts, and lofts with built-in bars,
staircases and even waterbeds.
If you don't want to spend the
money to buy a ready-made loft, it's not
that difficult to build one yourself.
Lumber and tools are available from
local merchants, and tools like power
saws and drills can be rented.

"So how do I build a loft?" The basic
ingredients of a one-story, single bed
loft are:
• a 4xB sheet of plywood 3/8-inch thick
or thicker (fibre board is heavy and
cumbersome)
• 4x4 posts cut to the desired height
• 2x4 or 2x6 boards to support the
plywood, Ix 4 or 2x4 boards to use as
cross-bracing to prevent sway
• joist hangers
• nails (or wood screws) and lag bolts
• carpet to finish off the platform.
The first thing to build is the frame
to support the platform.
There are two basic frames to
choose from: (A) a frame.of 2x4s with
outside dimensions of 4xB ft. or (B) a
2x6 or 2xB outer frame with inside di

mensior.s 4xB ft.
The advantage to B is that the
plywood may be set inside the outer
frame, leaving a rim around the plat
form which not only keeps the mat
tress from sliding off but precludes the
use of nails to anchor the plywood to
the frame. This saves set-up and tear
down time.
For both frames (A and B), cut the
corners so the shorter 2x4s fit inside
the long ones. The nicest and easiest
way to secure the outside corners,
though slightly more expensive, is to
use lag bolts.
At the end of the long boards, drill
two holes into the face. Make the
diameter of the holes smaller than that
of the bolt. Make sure the lag bolts are

long enough to extend into the end of
the shorter boards and provide a
strong joint.
The next step for both A and B is to
install joists at 20-inch intervals to sup
port the platform. Be sure to leave at
least four inches clear at each end for
the loft legs.
Joists are usually 2x4s supported by
joist hangers anchored to the long
boards of the frame. The joists must
provide a level surface for the plywood
platform.
For a 2x4 outer frame (A), make sure
the joist hangers are nailed in so that
the inner 2x4 joists will fit flush with
the top of the frame. First, measure and
mark position of the joist hangers with
a small 2x4 block.
Now cut the 2x4 joists to fit snugly
within the outer frame, resting on the
joist hangers. As long as the corners are
secure, the joists need not be nailed.
On frames with top-flush joists (A),
plywood platforms must be nailed or
screwed down. For a loft with a wide
outer frame (B), the plywood platform
may be set on top of the joists inside
the frame.

Next, the legs must be in
stalled and braced. Use 4x4
posts. Set them inside the
frame at the corners, with
the top of the posts on the
same level as the joists.
Drill holes for at least
two lag bolts per leg, or use
at least four 16-inch penny
nails.
Braces should run
diagonally from the top of
one leg to the bottom of the
opposite leg. From the long
side, use a 2x4 for the
diagonal brace; on the
ends, a Ix 4 is fine.

If you want built-in shelves, cut a 2x4
or 2x6 to fit between the legs and nail
or bolt it in. This will also give added
support.
For a ladder, cut several blocks of
equal length for stairs (wider stairs are
nicer). Cut two more 2x4's for ladder
uprights (avoid splintery wood) and
mark off steps at regular intervals. The
ladder can be nailed together since it's
small enough to store.
