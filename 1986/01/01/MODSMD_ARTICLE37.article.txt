# Card football promises best in years
## 
### 
Coming off of a stunning upset
over the Texas Longhorns, the
Stanford Cardinal football team
looks the best it has in years.
Now the only real questions are: Can
Stanford be consistent this year? And
can the team remain relatively injury
free? If the answer to both of these
questions is yes, then the Cardinal
could conceivably go to its first bowl

game since 1978 â€” that is, other than
the already scheduled Mirage Bowl
against Arizona to wrap up the 19H6
regular season.
The Stanford offense is usually never
a question, and this year is no excep
tion. Highly regarded quarterback
John Pave is back for his final season
and will in) doubt pass a few illustrious
names in the Stanford record book if

he remains healthy.
Pave has been injury-prone in the
past, but this season he has a dramati
cally improved offensive line to protect
him. Only one 19HS starter is gone, and
the rest of the unit all have a year of ex
perience under their belts. Tom Nye,
Andy Sinclair, Andy Papathanassiou
and Jeff Marchin all stand out.
The line certainly performed well
against the Texas defense last week,
giving Pave time to throw to his favor
ite target, junior receiver Jeff James,
who was named Pac 10 Offensive
Player of the Week following the Texas
upset. James caught nine passes lor 162
yards and three spectacular touch
downs.
The Stanford offense boasts
numerous other weapons, notably an
extremely strong backfield led by all
conference fullback Brad Muster, the
team's leading rusher and receiver last
season. Speedster Kevin Scott, who
gained 75 yards against the Longhorns,
will be at tailback, while Brian Morris
and Marshall Dillard will also get a lot
of playing time.
Thomas Henley has successfully
made the transition from tailback to
wide receiver, making two nice catches
at Texas. The senior will help take
pressure off of James (who was
double-covered much of last year ) and
also serve as kick-off returner. Henley
was second in kick-off returns in the
Pac 10 last year.
The real key to this years squad,
however, is on the other side of the
ball. Led by senior linebacker Dave
Wvman, the defense looks tough and

much more physical than in the past.
Nine starters are back, including
Wvman, who sat out 198S with a
serious knee injury.
The defensive line had a good
showing at Austin, particularly tackle
Tony Leiker and redshirt freshman
Lester Archambeau. The secondary , a
cause for concern last season,

eliminated The Big Play that haunted
them all last year, intercepted three
passes and recovered two tumbles.
Toi Cook picked off two passes. Brad
Humphreys had another. Walt Harris
(moved to tree safetv where he played
admirably) grabbed one Texas tumble
and redsliirt freshman Alan Grant the
other Grant is already being described

.is a future star and possibh the best
defensive hack in Stanford history
(Asked win Grant was redshirted last
season, Head Coach Jack El way
replied. "That's a hell of a good ques
tion. Why did we redshirt him last
year?")


Cardinal quarterback John Paye passed for more than 200 yards in the
team's opener at Texas, but the offense is relying on the senior's tender right
shoulder to carry it through the season.
But the most impressive unit has to
be the linebacking corps, especially
with the return of All-America candi
date Wyman, who led the squad in
tackles against the Longhorns with 14.
Chris Weber, Kurt Colehower, and
Barry McKeever are the other starters,
with Mike Noble, Darron Bennett and
Kevin Richardson providing excellent
depth.
David Sweeney is a competent
kicker, with a 30 yard field goal at
Texas and four extra points. Doug
Robison led the Pac 10 in punting for
the first half of 1985 before tailing off,

and has looked good so far this fail.
Jack Elway has a vastly improved
football team, and it will be his job to
make sure that the Cardinal remains
consistent. Stanford could start off the
season with a 4-0 mark if all goes as it
should against non-conference oppo
nents and weak Oregon State.
If the squad has a winning season,
which it is certainly capable of doing,
there could be a bowl game in the of
fing on the strength of the Texas win.
An opening day win on the road
against a non-conference football
powerhouse will look good to bowl
committees. Now if only the Cardinal
wins all the games it should....


Jeff James
Pac 10 player of the week


Senior linebacker Dave Wyman, who missed the entire 1985 season with a serious knee injury, will lead a more physi
cal defensive squad this year. He is not the only one with experience, however. Nine starters are back.
