Things could be very interesting in the Pacific 10
conference this year. After only two weeks of play,
there are already indications of the relative
strength of the teams in the league.
At the time this issue went to print, the big story in the
Pac 10 is, of course, Stanford Two weekends ago, the

Huskies pounded nationally ranked Ohio State 40-7 in
their opening game, as Chris Chandler had two touch
down passes, both to receiver Lonzell "Thrill" Hill.
The defense looks tough, led by senior tackle Reggie
Rogers and last year's leading tackier David Hill. Fullback
