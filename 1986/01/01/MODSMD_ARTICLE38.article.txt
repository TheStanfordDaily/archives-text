# A 						look at the Pac-10
## The 						hunt for the roses 
### 
Things could be very interesting in the Pacific 10
conference this year. After only two weeks of play,
there are already indications of the relative
strength of the teams in the league.
At the time this issue went to print, the big story in the
Pac 10 is, of course, Stanford Two weekends ago, the
Cardinal pulled off a big opening day road win over the
University of Texas, a traditional football powerhouse.
Stanford head coach Jack Elway s squad looked sharp
in the 31-20 victory, as quarterback John Pave and
receiver Jeff James (the Pac 10 Player of the Week)
starred offensively. Equally impressive was the defensive
unit, which effectively shut down the Longhorn attack
and forced five turnovers.
There have been other developments in the league.
Preseason favorite UCLA suffered a terrible defeat at the
hands of No. 1 ranked Oaklahoma, as the defending na
tional champions crushed the third ranked Bruins 38-3.
UClj\ quarterback Matt Stevens threw five interceptions
and last year's Rose Bowl team made it past midfieldonly
once — bv three yards. Following the game, Sooner

linebacker Brian Bosworth commented that lICIA played
"girl's football."
But don't count the Bruins out yet. Terry Donahue's
teams have been notoriously slow starters in the past, yet
somehow always seem to be right up at the top by the
end of the season.
This year UCIA has an extremely strong backfield, with
runners like Gaston Green, Eric Ball. Mel Fair and James
Primus. The defense is also solid. The only real questions
seem to be the offensive line and the special teams, espe
cially with the graduation of All American placekicker
John Lee.
Washington is another highly regarded team. The
Huskies pounded nationally ranked Ohio State 40-7 in
their opening game, as Chris Chandler had two touch
down passes, both to receiver Lonzell "Thrill" Hill.
The defense looks tough, led by senior tackle Reggie
Rogers and last year's leading tackier David Hill. Fullback
Kick Fenney is healthy again . Washington boasts the
top kicker in the conference in Jeff Jaeger.
Arizona State opened the season with a 20-17 up
set of tough Michigan State. A blocked field goal with
12 seconds to play gave the Sun Devils the win over
the 20th ranked team in the country. Last season, ASU
nearly made the Rose Bowl with an 8-4 record, and
15 starters are back from that squad.
Senior quarterback Jeff Van Raaphorst runs the of
fense, and he has a good target in all-conference
split-end Aaron Cox. The only big loss for the Sun
Devils was All-American safety David Fulcher, who
was declared academically ineligible and headed for
the pros. Even so, the defense will be strong.
Arizona may be the team to beat in the confer
ence. The Wildcats won their first two games and
scored 74 points in the process — and this is a squad
usually known for its defense.
The primary weapons in the new-found offense
are senior quarterback Alfred Jenkins, tailback David
Adams and split-end Jon Horton. The defense is again
outstanding, with a solid line and tough linebackers
such as Byron Evans. Seventeen starters are back
from a 1985 unit that went 8-3 on the year.
USC has been somewhat of a question, but the
Trojans opened up with a 31-16 win over Illinois.
Quarterback Rodney Peete was one of the biggest
question marks following a severe injury in USC's
Aloha Bowl loss last season. Peete seems fully
recovered from a torn achilles heel, throwing a 26-
yard touchdown pass and scoring another touch
down himself on a 32 yard run.
The Trojan tailbacks are youngsters Ryan Knight
and Aaron Emmanuel. The offensive line is headed
by All-American guard Jeff Bregel. The defensive line
is inexperienced, but the rest of the defense looks
good, particualrly All-American safety Tim Mac-
Donald.
This season is crucial for Southern Cal; if the
Trojans fail to have a winning record, head coach Ted
Tollner will probably lose his job.
Many people considered California to be the

surprise team of the Pac 10, but an opening day upset
by Boston College indicates that the Golden Bears
may have a number of weaknesses, especially on spe
cial teams. Leland Rix (of Big Game fame) missed
two extra points, and punter Scott Tabc was trapped
in the end zone for a safety.
Still, California has a chance to improve on last
year's 4-7 record with talented players such as Hicks
and senior linebacker Hardy Nickerson, if the team
gets good coaching.
Oregon is off to a 2-0 start after victories over San
Jose State and Colorado — the Ducks scored 10
points in the final 44 seconds to defeat Colorado (a
bowl team last year) 32-30. The squad has a
legitimate star in quarterback Chris Miller, who
threw 18 touchdown passes last year.
The rest of the offense is inexperienced, however,
and the defense is not much better. The Ducks now
must face four more bowl teams in a row, and
chances are that Oregon won't finish much better

than last season's 5-6 mark despite their good start.
The Air Express is back at Oregon State, as sopho
more quarterback Eric Wilhelm returns from a knee
injury. The Beaver passing attack never got underway
against Fresno State in the opener, however, as OSU
felj 27-0 to the defending PCAA champions.
The Oregon State defense returns eight starters,
including senior linebacker Lavance Northington,
but that won't be enough to keep OSU from finishing
near the bottom of the league.
Washington State also will be near the bottom of
the conference. The Cougars won their first game
against the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, as quar
terback Ed Blount tossed two touchdowns and ran
for another, but the team was upset by San Jose State
the following week, losing 20-13 after leading 13-0 at
the half.
Fullback Kerry Porter is the only returning mem
ber of the Cougar backfield, and the defense, not
good last year, lost six down-linemen.

hands of No. 1 ranked Oaklahoma, as the defending na
tional champions crushed the third ranked Bruins 38-3.
UClj\ quarterback Matt Stevens threw five interceptions
and last year's Rose Bowl team made it past midfieldonly
once — bv three yards. Following the game, Sooner

linebacker Brian Bosworth commented that lICIA played
"girl's football."
But don't count the Bruins out yet. Terry Donahue's
teams have been notoriously slow starters in the past, yet
somehow always seem to be right up at the top by the
end of the season.
This year UCIA has an extremely strong backfield, with
runners like Gaston Green, Eric Ball. Mel Fair and James
Primus. The defense is also solid. The only real questions
seem to be the offensive line and the special teams, espe
cially with the graduation of All American placekicker
John Lee.
Washington is another highly regarded team. The
Huskies pounded nationally ranked Ohio State 40-7 in
their opening game, as Chris Chandler had two touch
down passes, both to receiver Lonzell "Thrill" Hill.
The defense looks tough, led by senior tackle Reggie
Rogers and last year's leading tackier David Hill. Fullback
Kick Fenney is healthy again . Washington boasts the
top kicker in the conference in Jeff Jaeger.
Arizona State opened the season with a 20-17 up
set of tough Michigan State. A blocked field goal with
12 seconds to play gave the Sun Devils the win over
the 20th ranked team in the country. Last season, ASU
nearly made the Rose Bowl with an 8-4 record, and
15 starters are back from that squad.
Senior quarterback Jeff Van Raaphorst runs the of
fense, and he has a good target in all-conference
split-end Aaron Cox. The only big loss for the Sun
Devils was All-American safety David Fulcher, who
was declared academically ineligible and headed for
the pros. Even so, the defense will be strong.
Arizona may be the team to beat in the confer
ence. The Wildcats won their first two games and
scored 74 points in the process — and this is a squad
usually known for its defense.
The primary weapons in the new-found offense
are senior quarterback Alfred Jenkins, tailback David
Adams and split-end Jon Horton. The defense is again
outstanding, with a solid line and tough linebackers
such as Byron Evans. Seventeen starters are back
from a 1985 unit that went 8-3 on the year.
USC has been somewhat of a question, but the
Trojans opened up with a 31-16 win over Illinois.
Quarterback Rodney Peete was one of the biggest
question marks following a severe injury in USC's
Aloha Bowl loss last season. Peete seems fully
recovered from a torn achilles heel, throwing a 26-
yard touchdown pass and scoring another touch
down himself on a 32 yard run.
The Trojan tailbacks are youngsters Ryan Knight
and Aaron Emmanuel. The offensive line is headed
by All-American guard Jeff Bregel. The defensive line
is inexperienced, but the rest of the defense looks
good, particualrly All-American safety Tim Mac-
Donald.
This season is crucial for Southern Cal; if the
Trojans fail to have a winning record, head coach Ted
Tollner will probably lose his job.
Many people considered California to be the

surprise team of the Pac 10, but an opening day upset
by Boston College indicates that the Golden Bears
may have a number of weaknesses, especially on spe
cial teams. Leland Rix (of Big Game fame) missed
two extra points, and punter Scott Tabc was trapped
in the end zone for a safety.
Still, California has a chance to improve on last
year's 4-7 record with talented players such as Hicks
and senior linebacker Hardy Nickerson, if the team
gets good coaching.
Oregon is off to a 2-0 start after victories over San
Jose State and Colorado — the Ducks scored 10
points in the final 44 seconds to defeat Colorado (a
bowl team last year) 32-30. The squad has a
legitimate star in quarterback Chris Miller, who
threw 18 touchdown passes last year.
The rest of the offense is inexperienced, however,
and the defense is not much better. The Ducks now
must face four more bowl teams in a row, and
chances are that Oregon won't finish much better

than last season's 5-6 mark despite their good start.
The Air Express is back at Oregon State, as sopho
more quarterback Eric Wilhelm returns from a knee
injury. The Beaver passing attack never got underway
against Fresno State in the opener, however, as OSU
felj 27-0 to the defending PCAA champions.
The Oregon State defense returns eight starters,
including senior linebacker Lavance Northington,
but that won't be enough to keep OSU from finishing
near the bottom of the league.
Washington State also will be near the bottom of
the conference. The Cougars won their first game
against the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, as quar
terback Ed Blount tossed two touchdowns and ran
for another, but the team was upset by San Jose State
the following week, losing 20-13 after leading 13-0 at
the half.
Fullback Kerry Porter is the only returning mem
ber of the Cougar backfield, and the defense, not
good last year, lost six down-linemen.


Washington head coach Don James (left) hopes an opening day 40-7 win over nationally-ranked Ohio
State will send his team on to another Rose Bowl. Oregon State sophomore quarterback Eric Wilhelm
is back from a serious injury to lead his team's "Air Express."
Things could be very interesting in the Pacific 10
conference this year. After only two weeks of play,
there are already indications of the relative
strength of the teams in the league.
At the time this issue went to print, the big story in the
Pac 10 is, of course, Stanford Two weekends ago, the
Cardinal pulled off a big opening day road win over the
University of Texas, a traditional football powerhouse.
Stanford head coach Jack Elway s squad looked sharp
in the 31-20 victory, as quarterback John Pave and
receiver Jeff James (the Pac 10 Player of the Week)
starred offensively. Equally impressive was the defensive
unit, which effectively shut down the Longhorn attack
and forced five turnovers.
There have been other developments in the league.
Preseason favorite UCLA suffered a terrible defeat at the
hands of No. 1 ranked Oaklahoma, as the defending na
tional champions crushed the third ranked Bruins 38-3.
