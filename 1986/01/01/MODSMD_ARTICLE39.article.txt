# High expectations for Card teams
## 
### 
The fall sports season at Stanford looks bright, and it's
not just football. This autumn the defending NCAA
champion water polo team swings back into action
along with the NCAA runner-up women's volleyball team.
The men's and women's soccer teams, the cross country
team and women's field hockey will all be competing as
well. In fact, every fall sport has already gone into action
well before the start of school.
Water polo

Men's water polo opened 1986 the same way it finished
1985: winning. The Cardinal has won three in a row and is
again ranked number one in the country, following victories
over Cal State Los Angeles (17-3), Fordham (18-3) and Cali
fornia (11-8).
The win over the Bears took place at Berkeley's Spieker
Pool, in the first night game ever at Cal. The Cardinal started
out 4-1 in the first period and never lost the lead.
Top scorers were Craig Klass and Greg Gamble with
three goals each, while David Imbernino and Greg Ocasek
both added two. This coming week, Stanford faces UC-Santa
Barbara and then plays in the UC-Irvine Tournament.
Led by Head Coach Dante Dettamanti, the men's water
polo team boasts four Ail-Americans: Pac 10 Player of the
Year Klass, three-time honoree Imbernino, Gamble and
goalie Todd Kemp. Matt Tingler, Erich Fischer, Chris
Thompson and Greg Ocasek all return as well from last
years 25-4 squad (6-0 in the Pac 10).
Water polo should be even stronger than last year, if pos
sible. Klass led the squad in scoring in 1985 with 56 goals
while Imbernino, who played with the U.S. national team
over the winter, was second with 44.
Volleyball
Women's volleyball has not fared so well. Ranked number
one nearly all last season, the heavily favored Cardinal fell in
the NCAA title game to University of the Pacific. The squad
wound up 1985 with a 28-3 record, best in Stanford history,
and became the first team in the country to go to the NCAA
Final Four four years in a row. It was Stanford's second
straight second-place finish.
This year the Cardinal, again ranked first in the nation, is
2-2 after losing twice in Austin (unlike the football team) to
the Texas Longhorns. Number six Texas is now 5-0 on the
season. It was the first time Stanford has lost two matches in
a row since 1984. Junior Wendi Rush also suffered an ankle
injury on the trip.
Under Head Coach Don Shaw, Stanford is led by Ail-
American setter Rush and senior hitter Barbara Fontana
along with juniors Teresa Smith and Nancy Reno. The Card
inal lost four-time All-American Kim Oden to graduation, but
Stanford will remain a top force in women's volleyball. This
week, the team faces San Jose State, Oregon, Portland State,
Pacific and Washington in an attempt to hang on to the top
spot in the country.
Field hockey

» Women's field hockey had its best season ever last year,
Xvinding up 10-4-1 overall and going to the NCAA playoffs.
Stanford has lost Five players from that squad, but led by-
Head Coach Sheryl Johnson, the 1986 team may be even
better.
I So far the Cardinal is 1-0-1, defeating Ohio 1-0 and tying
.California 1-1 in a thrilling double overtime match.
• AlI-NorPac players Andi Wolpert, Maree Chung (last
season's leading scorer), and sophomore goalie Karen
Jones all return. Senior Mary Goodman adds experience to
the forward line, where she is joined by sophomore Kathv
.Thomas, who was second on the team in goals last year and
scored the lone Cardinal goal against Cal.
Top defenders will be Ami Chitwood and Wanda Key —
)he rest of the spots may go to freshmen.
• Field hockey is yet another Stanford team heading back
east this week The Cardinal will take on Springfield, Massa
thusetts and Boston College.

Men's soccer
Men's soccer has already played five games and emerged
with a 2-2-1 record, winning the first two matches of the
season against Sacramento State and Western Washington.
The Cardinal then lost to Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo, tied Cal
State Fullerton and fell to San Diego State.
Leading scorers for Stanford so far are Ross Torres and
Kevin Woodhouse with four point apiece. Numerous injur
ies have hampered the soccer squad of late, as the Cardinal
goes into action against Fresno Pacific and Portland. Senior
captains Pat Sheehy and Neal Stephens have both missed at
least two contests and sophomore Tim Westergren may have
a stress fracture in his right leg.
Last year the soccer team, coached by Sam Koch, won 10
of its last 13 matches, finishing second in league play and
just missing the NCAA playoffs. This season, however, the
Cardinal has lost six of its top seven scorers to graduation
and only eight lettermen return. Among these is standout
goalie Tom Austin, an Ail-American candidate. Austin re
corded 12 shutouts last year.
Women's soccer

The women's soccer team starts things off with a trip back
east this week, meeting Harvard, Brown and Rhode Island.
The young team (primarily sophomores') is coached by
Helen Keohane, who hopes to improve on last season's 5-
12-1 mark.
The goalie will be sophomore Vija Brookshire, who re
corded 19 saves last year, and top scorers should include
Carolyn Denney, Kelly McDevitt and junior Jen Hill follow
ing the loss of last year's top point leader Sara MacPherson.
There is a lot of talent and experience among the
midfielders with senior Amy Geisse, top recruit Tonya An
tonucci and Beth Egan. Junior Hilary Lauer returns at full
back after a year off.
Men's X-country

The Meet of the Minds is the first event of the year for the
men's cross country team, which travels to Harvard this
week to run against the host, Rice and Northwestern.
Former Olympic coach Brooks Johnson may have one of
the best teams on the west coast, particularly with senior
Marc Oleson, the top returning runner in the NCAA. Oleson
was fourth in the 1985 NCAA championships and was named
the Pac 10 Cross Country Athlete of the Year.
Senior Ryan Stoll is another top runner for the Cardinal,
along with sophomore James Alborough, seniors Charles Al
exander and Jeff Kostoff and junior Steve Schadler. Two top
recruits, Eric and Mark Mastalir, will add depth.
Women's XC
The women's cross country team failed to qualify - for the
NCAA Championships for the first time in four years in 1985.
Furthermore, the squad lost two top performers, four-time
All-American Regina Jacobs and three-time honoree Alison
Wiley. Junior Cory Schubert and sophomores Christa Curtin
and Kim Stevens will lie the Cardinal hopefuls this year if
they can successfully avoid injury-.
This has been a major concern for Johnson, as both
Schubert and Curtin have been plagued by injuries through
out their college careers and missed competition in 1985.
Stanford Finished in the top three nationally every year from
1981-1984, and if the Cardinal runners can remain healthy,
they will finish near the top once again.

better.
I So far the Cardinal is 1-0-1, defeating Ohio 1-0 and tying

• AlI-NorPac players Andi Wolpert, Maree Chung (last
season's leading scorer), and sophomore goalie Karen

Men's soccer
Men's soccer has already played five games and emerged
with a 2-2-1 record, winning the first two matches of the
season against Sacramento State and Western Washington.
The Cardinal then lost to Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo, tied Cal
State Fullerton and fell to San Diego State.
Leading scorers for Stanford so far are Ross Torres and
Kevin Woodhouse with four point apiece. Numerous injur
ies have hampered the soccer squad of late, as the Cardinal
goes into action against Fresno Pacific and Portland. Senior
captains Pat Sheehy and Neal Stephens have both missed at
least two contests and sophomore Tim Westergren may have
a stress fracture in his right leg.
Last year the soccer team, coached by Sam Koch, won 10
of its last 13 matches, finishing second in league play and
just missing the NCAA playoffs. This season, however, the
Cardinal has lost six of its top seven scorers to graduation
and only eight lettermen return. Among these is standout
goalie Tom Austin, an Ail-American candidate. Austin re
corded 12 shutouts last year.
Women's soccer

The women's soccer team starts things off with a trip back
east this week, meeting Harvard, Brown and Rhode Island.
The young team (primarily sophomores') is coached by
Helen Keohane, who hopes to improve on last season's 5-
12-1 mark.
The goalie will be sophomore Vija Brookshire, who re
corded 19 saves last year, and top scorers should include
Carolyn Denney, Kelly McDevitt and junior Jen Hill follow
ing the loss of last year's top point leader Sara MacPherson.
There is a lot of talent and experience among the
midfielders with senior Amy Geisse, top recruit Tonya An
tonucci and Beth Egan. Junior Hilary Lauer returns at full
back after a year off.
Men's X-country

The Meet of the Minds is the first event of the year for the
men's cross country team, which travels to Harvard this
week to run against the host, Rice and Northwestern.
Former Olympic coach Brooks Johnson may have one of
the best teams on the west coast, particularly with senior
Marc Oleson, the top returning runner in the NCAA. Oleson
was fourth in the 1985 NCAA championships and was named
the Pac 10 Cross Country Athlete of the Year.
Senior Ryan Stoll is another top runner for the Cardinal,
along with sophomore James Alborough, seniors Charles Al
exander and Jeff Kostoff and junior Steve Schadler. Two top
recruits, Eric and Mark Mastalir, will add depth.
Women's XC
The women's cross country team failed to qualify - for the
NCAA Championships for the first time in four years in 1985.
Furthermore, the squad lost two top performers, four-time
All-American Regina Jacobs and three-time honoree Alison
Wiley. Junior Cory Schubert and sophomores Christa Curtin
and Kim Stevens will lie the Cardinal hopefuls this year if
they can successfully avoid injury-.
This has been a major concern for Johnson, as both
Schubert and Curtin have been plagued by injuries through
out their college careers and missed competition in 1985.
Stanford Finished in the top three nationally every year from
1981-1984, and if the Cardinal runners can remain healthy,
they will finish near the top once again.




The fall sports season at Stanford looks bright, and it's
not just football. This autumn the defending NCAA
champion water polo team swings back into action
along with the NCAA runner-up women's volleyball team.
The men's and women's soccer teams, the cross country
team and women's field hockey will all be competing as
well. In fact, every fall sport has already gone into action
well before the start of school.
Water polo

Men's water polo opened 1986 the same way it finished
1985: winning. The Cardinal has won three in a row and is
again ranked number one in the country, following victories
over Cal State Los Angeles (17-3), Fordham (18-3) and Cali
fornia (11-8).
The win over the Bears took place at Berkeley's Spieker
Pool, in the first night game ever at Cal. The Cardinal started
out 4-1 in the first period and never lost the lead.
Top scorers were Craig Klass and Greg Gamble with
three goals each, while David Imbernino and Greg Ocasek
both added two. This coming week, Stanford faces UC-Santa
Barbara and then plays in the UC-Irvine Tournament.
Led by Head Coach Dante Dettamanti, the men's water
polo team boasts four Ail-Americans: Pac 10 Player of the
Year Klass, three-time honoree Imbernino, Gamble and
goalie Todd Kemp. Matt Tingler, Erich Fischer, Chris
Thompson and Greg Ocasek all return as well from last
years 25-4 squad (6-0 in the Pac 10).
Water polo should be even stronger than last year, if pos
sible. Klass led the squad in scoring in 1985 with 56 goals
while Imbernino, who played with the U.S. national team
over the winter, was second with 44.
Volleyball
Women's volleyball has not fared so well. Ranked number
one nearly all last season, the heavily favored Cardinal fell in
the NCAA title game to University of the Pacific. The squad
wound up 1985 with a 28-3 record, best in Stanford history,
and became the first team in the country to go to the NCAA
Final Four four years in a row. It was Stanford's second
straight second-place finish.
This year the Cardinal, again ranked first in the nation, is
2-2 after losing twice in Austin (unlike the football team) to
the Texas Longhorns. Number six Texas is now 5-0 on the
season. It was the first time Stanford has lost two matches in
a row since 1984. Junior Wendi Rush also suffered an ankle
injury on the trip.
Under Head Coach Don Shaw, Stanford is led by Ail-
American setter Rush and senior hitter Barbara Fontana
along with juniors Teresa Smith and Nancy Reno. The Card
inal lost four-time All-American Kim Oden to graduation, but
Stanford will remain a top force in women's volleyball. This
week, the team faces San Jose State, Oregon, Portland State,
Pacific and Washington in an attempt to hang on to the top
spot in the country.
