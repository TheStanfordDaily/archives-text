# Diverse is the word for this year's frosh

If you could spend a day with
anyone, chances are you'd like to
see Grandpa. Or Jesus. Or your
self.
Those are the top three choices in a
•sample of 2,000 application essays for
ithe class of 1990.
Sound like a strange group?
"Diverse'' would be a better descrip
tion, according to Dean of Undergrad
uate Admissioas Jean Fetter, who says
•that's the watchword for this year's
freshmen.
First, you, the Class of 1990, were
chosen out of a large group. A total of
1,575 freshmen are beginning life on
the Farm today out of 16,138 hopefuls
who applied last fall. You are among
the 16 percent rewarded with a thick
envelope after camping out by the
mailbox last spring.
* The transfer students' statistics aren't
any easier. Out of 1,409 applicants,
only 8 percent were accepted, and 89
enrolled here.
But you knew the competition was
tough. What's new? The class of 1990
represents a landmark in minority en
rollment. Almost one-third of this
year's freshmen are black, Chicano,
Asian-American or Native American. Of
,the 32 percent minority enrollment,
about half are Asian-Americans. This is
nearly double last year's figure of 9
. percent Asian-Americans.
* Fetter described the minority enroll
ment figures as "a significant achieve
ment," noting "very few students come
from a high school graduating class
with that kind of diversity."
* The male-female ratio also shifted
■this year. The class of 1990 is made up
of 58 percent men and 42 percent
women Last year's division was 54 per
cent men and 46 percent women.
I That may look like a downward
trend for women's enrollment, but as
Fetter pointed out last year's freshman
class had the highest percentage of
women ever. And this year's percent
ages exactly reflect the percentages for
;the applicants.
There was some speculation among
students last spring that the Under
graduate Admissions Office was target
ing applicants with exceptional math
.abilities. In fact, the drive was only one
•part of a larger effort to attract
•."students of extreme talent" in several
fields, explained Fetter, who says she
has no idea how the rumour about a
mathematics-oriented search gained
such popularity.
"The math drive is part of a special
talent outreach," Fetter said. "We are
looking for students who have talent in
art, drama, music and dance."
Last year, for the first time, Stanford
held auditions in Chicago, Los Angeles
and New York. Drama Prof. Charles
Lyons auditioned 60 students in those
cities.
The math drive was the idea of Prof.
Bradley Efron, who heads the program
in Mathematical and Computational
Sciences. He noted that Stanford is un
derrepresented in National Science
Foundation fellowships, according to
Fetter.

"All you have to do is look at our
number of math majors — 12 last year
— to see the problem," said Fetter,
who emphasized "we're talking about
handfuls of students."
And where are you from? California
has the largest state representation,
with claim to 38 percent of the enter
ing freshmen. New York, Texas, Wash
ington and Illinois follow. Every state is
represented except West Virginia.
Also entering are 49 freshmen from
foreign countries including Argentina,
Ireland, Israel, Kenya, the People's
Republic of China, Poland, Sweden and
Yugoslav ii

Diversity. You aren't convinced yet?
Some of the other top personality
choices for the essays might change
your mind.
The top three were followed in or
der by Dad, a friend, Einstein, God,
grandma and Leonardo da Vinci.
Then came a typical Russian, Reagan,
Gorbachev, great-grandparents and
Mom.
And then there's number 15 Ahead
of the Pope, way before Socrates or
Mozart, you wanted to spend the day
with ... Stanford admission directors
or the Dean.
Surprise.

The class of 1990 represents a landmark
in minority enrollment. Almost one
third. of this year's freshmen are black,
Chicano, Asian-American or Native
American. Of the 32 percent minority
enrollment, about half are Asian-
Americans. This is nearly double last
year's figure of 9 percent Asian-
Americans.


Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter says the watchword for the Class of 1990 is
"diverse." International students represent nine countries, including Argen
tina, the Peoples' Republic of China and Poland.
