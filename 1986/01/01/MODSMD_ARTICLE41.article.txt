# IMs: a sport of every sort
## 
### 
Watching a Cardinal football game on
a Saturday afternoon or a basket
ball victory over a Pacific 10 power
definitely is an exciting part of life at Stan
ford. And something inside each of us
watching a game from the stands, especially
those who played on a high school team,
makes one want to jump up and join in
Well, take heart, fellow, frustrated high
school jocks. Intramural sports at Stanford
are big. Very big. And it's quite likely that the
sport you played in high school is offered
on the Farm. You can also try your hand at
something new, perhaps ultimate frisbee or
inner : tube water polo, both offered in the
spring.
Intramurals are fun, but they're also
serious business. Sometimes you feel as
though you're in one of those Michelob

Light commercials where you play like you
never have before because you can taste that
cool, refreshing brew as you sweat your guts
out.
More than 6,000 students participle in in
tramurals at some point in the school year,
either in individual sports such as tennis or
in a team activity like football. Nearly all
freshman teams are dorm-oriented, as RAs
organize sign-ups for the' various sports at
house meetings. Most of the fraternities ap
proach IMs with a zeal surpassed only by the
fervor exerted in their partying.
To determine the overall champion,
points are awarded based on a team's finish
in each sport. The captain of the winning
team is presented with a trophy symbolic of
the accomplishment in the first home foot
ball game of the season the following fall.

During fall, the big IM sport at Stanford is
seven-man, two-hand touch football. There
are approximately 25 football leagues, each
containing six teams. The sport, played at
both an A and B level, also includes coed
and women's teams, with the coed version
being particularly popular among freshmen.
Four-player volleyball is another popular
fall activity on the Farm. Even if you're not
from the beaches of Southern California or
have never seen a volleyball game other
than those during the Olympics, give this
sport a try. Your roommates just might think
you some kind of athletic deity if you
sacrifice your body while diving for a ball.
Other fall sports include pingpong, bil
liards and three-on-three basketball.
During the winter, men's and women's
five-on-five basektball dominates the IM

scene. Not only does this sport offer the
greatest number of leagues, but it is also one
of the most competitive games at the Uni
veristy. This is your oppotunity to play on
the hardwood of Maples Pavilion, present
ing a chance to emulate your favorite NBA
players. Games take place in the evening, al
lowing you to take out your aggressions in a
controlled environment after a frustrating
day.
For those of you looking for something
relaxing to play in the spring, try softball.
This really is for you beer-leaguers out there
who like to replace the bodily fluids you lost
during the game with a six-pack of Henry's.
Don't take the sport too lightly, however, as
many teams are out for blood.
For those of you who don't like team
sports, try something fairly indiviudal, such
as IM tennis. The 1M tournaments really do
provide a taste of competitiveness some
where other than the classroom. There are
singles, doubles and mixed doubles at A and
B levels. Just playing on the courts where
McEnroe once stroked kind of inspires you
to play well.
