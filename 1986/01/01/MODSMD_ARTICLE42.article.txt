## Oarsmen searching for new talent 
### TRACY FURUTANI Staff writer 
If you've only thought of the word "crew in con
junction with the word "motley", umlauts and
heavy metal groups, then perhaps it's time to
reassess your vocabulary.
Crew is the term applied to the sport of rowing.
A crew race consists of two (called a "duel') or
more ("regatta") boats rowing against each other on
a straight 2000-meter course.
A crew team consists of "boats" which contain
either four or eight rowers and a coxswain.
The Stanford men's and women's crew team con
sist of varsity level members (people who were on
the crew team the year before) and freshman/novice
members, whom they are actively recruiting.
There are usually 60 to 80 men and 30 to 50
women involved in crew, according to figures
supplied by senior John Latting, men's crew co
captain.
Oh, yes; members of the crew team tend to be ex
citable.
"I'm excited to be involved with crew at this time,"
enthused Andy Winden, a sophomore who was on a
freshman boat last year. "The team is taking leaps for
ward."
"We're very excited as a whole," said Latting.
"Things are going to be very good this year; it's im
portant to let incoming freshmen know that.
The "things" to which he was referring were some
benificial changes the crew team had undergone
over the summer.
Chief among these changes are the new coaches:
Jiri Zapetal, the freshman/novice team coach, and his
assistant coach, Christopher Oechsle.
The acquisition of Zapetal from the University of
Washington, where he was the assistant varsity
rowing coach, was considered a minor miracle by
the team. "We're very fortunate to get him," said
Coach Ken Dreyfuss.
Zapetal and Oechsle, who rowed with professional
teams in Zurich, are expected to bring experienced
hands to the helm of the team.
Though crew attained varsity sporthood just two
years ago, it has already turned out some of the more
popular and successful varsity teams.
Last year, for instance, the varsity men's team came
in second in the Pacific Coast Rowing Champion
ships, beating Cal and narrowly losing to perennial
powerhouse Washington. As a result of this showing,
Drevfuss was named the Pac 10 Conference men's

crew coach of the year.
The men's freshman and novice teams, as well as
the women's varsity team, also finished second in
their respective races.
"I wouldn't be surprised if we beat Washington
this year," said Winden.
What sort of person should go out for crew team?
"The same kind of qualities that make a student
successful at Stanford will make them successful at
rowing," said Dreyfuss. "That is, you should be able
to work hard and see all of the rewards to be able to
get through the first steps."
"I was a swimmer in high school," explained
senior Lynn Gothrup, captain of the women's team.
"But 1 thought no way can I do it at the college var
sity level ." She decided to join crew because she
wanted to be involved in a sport and she had heard

"The same kind of
qualities that make a stu
dent successful at Stan
ford will make them suc
cessful at rowing," said
Dreyfuss. "That is, you
should be able to work
hard and see all the
rewards to be able to get
through the first steps."

that no previous rowing experience was necessary to
join the team.
Winden told a similar story. "I'd done some sports
in high school," he said. "I heard a little about
rowing and thought it was interesting, so I tried out

for it. Not a lot of people had done it before so
everybody started off about equal (in their rowing
abilities)."
In terms of physical attributes, the general consen
sus is that height was a definite advantage. "Rowing
is a leverage sport, so men should be at least 6 feet
tall and weigh 170 pounds and have had some kind
of athletic experience, while women should be at
least 5-feet-B,' - said Dreyfuss.
"Any able-bodied human being can row," added
Winden. "It's difficult if you're short, but determina
tion can let you do well. The best thing to have is a lot
of curiousity and desire."
"Rowing is open to anybody," concluded Dreyfuss.
"Even if you haven't rowed in high school, even if
you've never rowed even if you've never seen
a boat in your life."
The team holds practices five afternoons a week in
the fall, adding Saturday mornings in the winter.
During the spring, when wind conditions make after
noon rowing infeasible, the practices move to five
mornings a week.
"Expect to put in 15 to 20 hours a week," said Win
den.
The team practices at Redwood Shores, a develop
ment in Foster City, 15 miles north of Stanford,
where they also maintain a boathouse.
"We have a nice relationship with the developer,"
said Latting. "The developer uses Stanford's partici
pation as a promotional device and we get to use the
facilities; the developer even sponsors a regatta
there."
The advantages of joining crew?
"The team is like a family, very supportive," said
Gothrup.
"To go from sitting in a boat in Roble Pool in Octo
ber to racing for a freshman Pac 10 Championship in
May is an amazing, satisfying experience," said
Dreyfus.
"Rowing is the best exercise," said Winden.
"There's a free trip to San Diego at the beginning
of spring quarter (to compete in the San Diego Crew
Classic)," continued Winden, after a pause. "You
can't call it anything but a party. That's where 1 expe
rienced my first California party."
Men's and women's crew teams will be having a
joint orientation meeting on Monday night in History
Corner, Room 2 at 7:30 p.m. If you miss that one,
there will be another Tuesday night at 7:30 in the
same place.
Dreyfuss summed up the reason for the meetings:
"We need to have freshmen come out."
