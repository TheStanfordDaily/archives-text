# Band continues to delight and shock
## 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
Students hail its entrance into
Stanford Stadium. Alumni either
love them or are disgusted with
its Saturday afternoon presentations.
The Athletic Department holds its
breath each time it takes to the field.
Not the Stanford Cardinal football
squad, but something even more un
predictable ... the "truly incom
parable" Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity Marching Band.
"Any new idea that doesn't threaten
something isn't worth its salt," reads
the Carl Sagan passage that is displayed
on band manager Jeff Stevens' office
wall in the Band Shak.
As the saying goes, the Band holds
no punches. It mocks heads of state
(Reagan, Mao), rival schools (USC and
California in particular) and anything
else that is timely.
The LSJUMB halftime shows never
fail to draw laughter from the Stanford
crowds, but in the opinions of some
people the Stanford Band is merely
playing a game, trying to stretch to the
limit the definition of acceptable
humor and good taste.
Sometimes, too far.
The Band has had to be
reprimanded for a halftime show
which featured the LSJUMB dropping
its trousers on the field. At one point in
the early 1980's, Athletic Director Andy
Geiger formed a committee to censor
the halftime shows, but after two years
it was disbanded.
The now-infamous conclusion to the
1982 Big Game when the band ran
onto the field in a premature victory
celebration before the final play had
ended gained the LSJUMB notoriety
but also outraged several alumni who
thought the Band cost the Cardinal the
game.
So it is that controversy seems to fol
low the Stanford band. But does the
band seek controversy? "Instead of
saying we seek controversy, we don't
avoid it," Stevens said. "We're not
afraid to face public scrutiny."
While there may always be claims
that the Band sticks out like a sore
thumb on the Farm, it remains im
mensely popular with the student body
and the football team (which has on
several occasions joined the Band for
post-game celebrations).
And, yes, the LSJUMB has even
begun to see eye-to-eye with the Ath

letic Deptartment. "Relations are as
good as they've been in a long time,"
Stevens said. "For the first time, we're
trying to work with the AD to make the
Band as good as it can possibly be."
This year, the band will meet some
new challenges. Hal Mickelson, the
voice of LSJUMB since 1969, has
handed the microphone over to stu
dents Hob Snyder and John "Sparky"
Wallin.
And, while in Japan with the football
team for the Mirage Bowl against
Arizona on Nov. 30, the Band will be

expected to do two things that don't
come naturally: march in formation
and be on its best behavior.
Contrary to what is implied in its
name, the LSJUMB is not a marching
band. The Band will, however, be ex
pected to march with the Arizona band
in a show.
As for whether the Band will cause
any international scenes while in
Japan, Stevens said, "I hope that the
Band understands the responsibility."
Things have started smoothly with
regards ro Japan trip. The Band

made a good first impression as the
Japanese people liked the LSJUMB uni
forms (if they can be called uniforms)
so much that they have ordered similar
uniforms for the Arizona band.
"The Japanese obviously have great
taste," Stevens said. "They appreciate
everything we're going to wear from
our uniforms to the Dollies' short
skirts."
Ah, yes, the Dollies. The Female Five
who are at the forefront of each
LSJUMB performance. The job looks
glamorous enough, dancing in front of

huge crowds. But off the field, the
Dollies become the targets of most of
the abuse being dished out by the
band members. And you think some of
the halftime shows are in poor
taste.... This year's lucky girls are
Katie Genshlea, Dineen Johnson, Lisa
Larragoite, Julie Nasif and Vicky Takat
suka.
Leading the show this year will be
Brian Pike, the latest in the long line of
off-the-wall LSJUMB drum majors. In
the past, drum major costumes have
ranged from wedding dresses to

Gumby outfits, and batons have been
replaced by javelins and giant, wooden
salad spoons, among other things. Pike
likely spent the summer scouring the
basements of thrift stores for appropri
ate fall atire to be modeled in front of
50,000 people on Saturday afternoons.
The 1986-87 LSJUMB may or may not
make national headlines, but it will
certainly be heard from. Jim McMahon
may just as well have been speaking
about the Stanford Band when he
coined his popular phrase.
"Outrageousness."

pected to march with the Arizona band
in a show.
As for whether the Band will cause
any international scenes while in
Japan, Stevens said, "I hope that the
Band understands the responsibility."
Things have started smoothly with
regards ro Japan trip. The Band

made a good first impression as the
Japanese people liked the LSJUMB uni
forms (if they can be called uniforms)
so much that they have ordered similar
uniforms for the Arizona band.
"The Japanese obviously have great
taste," Stevens said. "They appreciate
everything we're going to wear from
our uniforms to the Dollies' short
skirts."
Ah, yes, the Dollies. The Female Five
who are at the forefront of each
LSJUMB performance. The job looks
glamorous enough, dancing in front of

huge crowds. But off the field, the
Dollies become the targets of most of
the abuse being dished out by the
band members. And you think some of
the halftime shows are in poor
taste.... This year's lucky girls are
Katie Genshlea, Dineen Johnson, Lisa
Larragoite, Julie Nasif and Vicky Takat
suka.
Leading the show this year will be
Brian Pike, the latest in the long line of
off-the-wall LSJUMB drum majors. In
the past, drum major costumes have
ranged from wedding dresses to

Gumby outfits, and batons have been
replaced by javelins and giant, wooden
salad spoons, among other things. Pike
likely spent the summer scouring the
basements of thrift stores for appropri
ate fall atire to be modeled in front of
50,000 people on Saturday afternoons.
The 1986-87 LSJUMB may or may not
make national headlines, but it will
certainly be heard from. Jim McMahon
may just as well have been speaking
about the Stanford Band when he
coined his popular phrase.
"Outrageousness."

Students hail its entrance into
Stanford Stadium. Alumni either
love them or are disgusted with
its Saturday afternoon presentations.
The Athletic Department holds its
breath each time it takes to the field.
Not the Stanford Cardinal football
squad, but something even more un
predictable ... the "truly incom
parable" Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity Marching Band.
"Any new idea that doesn't threaten
something isn't worth its salt," reads
the Carl Sagan passage that is displayed
on band manager Jeff Stevens' office
wall in the Band Shak.
As the saying goes, the Band holds
no punches. It mocks heads of state
(Reagan, Mao), rival schools (USC and
California in particular) and anything
else that is timely.
The LSJUMB halftime shows never
fail to draw laughter from the Stanford
crowds, but in the opinions of some
people the Stanford Band is merely
playing a game, trying to stretch to the
limit the definition of acceptable
humor and good taste.
Sometimes, too far.
The Band has had to be
reprimanded for a halftime show
which featured the LSJUMB dropping
its trousers on the field. At one point in
the early 1980's, Athletic Director Andy
Geiger formed a committee to censor
the halftime shows, but after two years
it was disbanded.
The now-infamous conclusion to the
1982 Big Game when the band ran
onto the field in a premature victory
celebration before the final play had
ended gained the LSJUMB notoriety
but also outraged several alumni who
thought the Band cost the Cardinal the
game.
So it is that controversy seems to fol
low the Stanford band. But does the
band seek controversy? "Instead of
saying we seek controversy, we don't
avoid it," Stevens said. "We're not
afraid to face public scrutiny."
While there may always be claims
that the Band sticks out like a sore
thumb on the Farm, it remains im
mensely popular with the student body
and the football team (which has on
several occasions joined the Band for
post-game celebrations).
And, yes, the LSJUMB has even
begun to see eye-to-eye with the Ath

letic Deptartment. "Relations are as
good as they've been in a long time,"
Stevens said. "For the first time, we're
trying to work with the AD to make the
Band as good as it can possibly be."
This year, the band will meet some
new challenges. Hal Mickelson, the
voice of LSJUMB since 1969, has
handed the microphone over to stu
dents Hob Snyder and John "Sparky"
Wallin.
And, while in Japan with the football
team for the Mirage Bowl against
Arizona on Nov. 30, the Band will be

expected to do two things that don't
come naturally: march in formation
and be on its best behavior.
Contrary to what is implied in its
name, the LSJUMB is not a marching
band. The Band will, however, be ex
pected to march with the Arizona band
in a show.
