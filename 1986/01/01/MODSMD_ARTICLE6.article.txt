# Hoover offers more than a good view
## 
### MONIQUE SCHEER 
Visually, Hoover Tower is the single most easily
identifiable building on the Stanford campus.
The ivory tower standing alone above the
trees, surrounded by bright blue sky and puffy white
clouds is a sight already familiar to you, no doubt.
For the incoming freshman, the tower is an indis
pensible resource. It's a great vantage point from
which to find yoru way around, and it provides a
breathtaking view of the campus and the surround
ing foothills from the observation platform on the
fourteenth floor.
What is not easily identifiable is exactly why the
tower is there. Actually, it's one of three buildings
that make up the Hoover Institution on War, Revolu
tion and Peace, a research center founded in 1919 by
Standord's most illustrious alumnus, President Her
bert Hoover. The Institution is the home of over 70
resident scholars and the largest collection of library
and archival materials on social, political and eco
nomic change since World War I.
The conservative institution, its fellows and the
controversy they generate get a lot of attention not
only in this area but nation-wide. If you hadn't
already heard of the Institution, perhaps you had
heard of some of the fellows: economists Milton
Friedman and Martin Anderson, sociologist Thomas
Sowell or physicist Edward Teller, not to mention
honorary fellows Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Ronald
Reagan.
As one of the nation's leading "think tanks" — in
the same league as the Brookings Institution, the
American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foun

elation, to name a few others — the Hoover Institu
tion provides a broad range of public policy analysis.
The scholars study everything from Social Security
to Sovietology, and the outflow of written material is
constant. Keep your eyes open next time you read
the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal or, more
locally, the San Francisco Chronicle and San Jose
Mercury News. Chances are, you'll read an editorial
piece by a Hoover staff member. Or, if you're inter
ested in more in-depth analysis, check out the Stan
ford Bookstore's stock of books from the Hoover
Press.
What distinguishes Hoover from most other public
policy think tanks, however, is its massive library and
archival collections. The 1.6 million volumes in the
Hoover Library fill the first nine floors of the tower
(that's why there aren't any windows), and the books
are organized into six major collections: Africa, the
Americas, East Asia, the Middle East, Western Europe
and the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. All these
books are included in the computerized SOCRATES
card catalog network that includes Green, Meyer and
the other libraries on campus.
The archives contain over 32 million items, some
of which can be found nowhere else. The very first
issue of Pravda is there, as is the diary of Hitler aide
Joseph Goebbels. The library and archives are open
to all students and faculty at Stanford, and they also
attract hundreds of visito r s each year.
Not only do the library facilities make Hoover spe
cial, but also unusual is the fact that it is technically
"an independent entity wihin the frame of Stanford
University." This structure has been a source of con

flict between the Institution and those who believe
the think tank's conservative approach compromises
Stanford's academic freedom. Some protesters, who
include faculty and students alike, have suggested
that the institution either be brought entirely under
the control of the University or else be severed en
tirely from association with Stanford.
Several scholars hold joint appointments with
Hoover and the Stanford faculty . Junior scholars are
frequently involved in the visiting programs for a
year or two.
The latest project on which Hoover and Stanford
are collaborating is the Reagan Presidential Library,
which will be located in the foothills off Junipero
Serra, scheduled to open in 1989.
Hoover is also unique in that it is one of very tew
think tanks not found on the East Coast. Despite the
distance, however, Hoover exerts a considerable in
fluence on policy-makers in Washington.
Nonetheless, the institution remains above all else
a scholarly institution. Its political impact has often
been a source of controversy among the Stanford
population, but its national prestige has also been a
source of pride.
You will undoubtedly encounter Hoover many
times during your years at Stanford, and you will
probably continue to hear about it after you've left
here. Take advantage of the library when you have
the opportunity. It's a fantastic resource if you're in
terested in what's been happening in the world
during this century.

already heard of the Institution, perhaps you had
heard of some of the fellows: economists Milton
Friedman and Martin Anderson, sociologist Thomas
Sowell or physicist Edward Teller, not to mention
honorary fellows Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Ronald
Reagan.
As one of the nation's leading "think tanks" — in
the same league as the Brookings Institution, the
American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foun

elation, to name a few others — the Hoover Institu
tion provides a broad range of public policy analysis.
The scholars study everything from Social Security
to Sovietology, and the outflow of written material is
constant. Keep your eyes open next time you read
the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal or, more
locally, the San Francisco Chronicle and San Jose
Mercury News. Chances are, you'll read an editorial
piece by a Hoover staff member. Or, if you're inter
ested in more in-depth analysis, check out the Stan
ford Bookstore's stock of books from the Hoover
Press.
What distinguishes Hoover from most other public
policy think tanks, however, is its massive library and
archival collections. The 1.6 million volumes in the
Hoover Library fill the first nine floors of the tower
(that's why there aren't any windows), and the books
are organized into six major collections: Africa, the
Americas, East Asia, the Middle East, Western Europe
and the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. All these
books are included in the computerized SOCRATES
card catalog network that includes Green, Meyer and
the other libraries on campus.
The archives contain over 32 million items, some
of which can be found nowhere else. The very first
issue of Pravda is there, as is the diary of Hitler aide
Joseph Goebbels. The library and archives are open
to all students and faculty at Stanford, and they also
attract hundreds of visito r s each year.
Not only do the library facilities make Hoover spe
cial, but also unusual is the fact that it is technically
"an independent entity wihin the frame of Stanford
University." This structure has been a source of con

flict between the Institution and those who believe
the think tank's conservative approach compromises
Stanford's academic freedom. Some protesters, who
include faculty and students alike, have suggested
that the institution either be brought entirely under
the control of the University or else be severed en
tirely from association with Stanford.
Several scholars hold joint appointments with
Hoover and the Stanford faculty . Junior scholars are
frequently involved in the visiting programs for a
year or two.
The latest project on which Hoover and Stanford
are collaborating is the Reagan Presidential Library,
which will be located in the foothills off Junipero
Serra, scheduled to open in 1989.
Hoover is also unique in that it is one of very tew
think tanks not found on the East Coast. Despite the
distance, however, Hoover exerts a considerable in
fluence on policy-makers in Washington.
Nonetheless, the institution remains above all else
a scholarly institution. Its political impact has often
been a source of controversy among the Stanford
population, but its national prestige has also been a
source of pride.
You will undoubtedly encounter Hoover many
times during your years at Stanford, and you will
probably continue to hear about it after you've left
here. Take advantage of the library when you have
the opportunity. It's a fantastic resource if you're in
terested in what's been happening in the world
during this century.
There's a lot more to Hoover Tower than a nice
view.
