# A library for everybody
## 
### 
Most new students are so busy
during their first week at Stan
ford, meeting their room
mates, going to orientation activities,
buying books, and worrying about
classes, that they just never get around
to taking the 20-minute guided tour
of Meyer Undergraduate Library.
Students who have taken the tour
can vouch for the fact that a lot goes on
and lives in Stanford's libraries that
most people never know about.
The 11 University libraries and six
coordinate libraries here present stu
dents with a vast store of information
including manuscripts, maps, sound
recordings, periodicals, microtexts,
photographs, government documents
and over 4.5 million books.
About half of all library staffers here
work at Green Library. Green contains
a general reference service, the Uni
versity Archives, the current periodi
cals and microtexts room, the govern
ment documents collection, the central
map collection, special collections and
the main research collection of the
University libraries.

Green also is one of the more mod
ern libraries here (the East Wing was
completed in 1980), and students must
show their student identification to
gain admittance to the library.
Meyer Undergraduate Library, affec
tionately known as UGLY, contains lan
guage laboratories, audio-visual ser
vices, a periodicals room, an exam file
(copies of mid-term and final exams
for various classes) lockers and carrells
and is where one obtains any materials
placed on reserve for class reading.
Meyer also houses the Learning Assis
tance Center.
Meyer has several Copicard copying
machines, electric and manual type
writers and calculators. Because it
houses the reserve reading materials,
Meyer Library is not as quiet or un
crowded as Green. The "observation
deck" arrangement of the lobby and
the third and fourth floors lend them
selves to scoping and socializing,
hence another nickname of Meyer Lib
rary, "the zoo."
The Art and Architecture Library, in
the Nathan Cummings Art Building,

contains books on art and architectural
history, paintings, a special collection
on Chinese art, sculpture and graphic
art.
The Frederic M. Falconer Biology
Library, on the third floor of Herrin
Hall in the Biological Sciences Center,
holds various materials in botany,
zoology and experimental fields of
biology.
The Swain Library of Chemistry, in
Room 1 of the Chemistry building, has
books on chemistry and materials
about chemical and petroleum indus
tries. The Cubberly Library of Educa
tion, on the second floor of the Educa
tion building, offers books, documents,
periodicals, pamphlets, microforms,
dissertations and other materials on
education.
The Branner Earth Sciences Library,
on the second floor of the Mitchell
Earth Sciences building, has materials
in geology, geophysics, mineral en
gineering and petroleum engineering,
geological maps, U.S. Geological Sur
vey topographical sheets and a stun
ning mineral collection.

The Engineering Library, in the
Terman Engineering building, has
books on engineering, and the;
Guggenheim Space Sciences Library,-
containing collections in aeronautics
and astronautics, radio science and;
electrical engineering.
The Mathematical and Computer.
Science Library, in Room 384 of the
Quad, has books on math, statistics and
computer theory and application.
Tne Physics Library, in Room 300 of
the Varian building, has the Hansei>
Microwave Laboratory Library, whicK
contains materials on microwave 4
physics and engineering and the
Plasma Physics Institute.
The six coordinate libraries offer de
tailed information on their field of
study, and though intended for use by
their specific staffs, several are open to
students. These libraries include the
Food Research Institute Library, the
Hoover Institution on War, Revolution
and Peace, the J. Hugh Jackson Library
of Business, the Lane Medical Library*
the School of Law Library and the Stan-'
ford Linear Accelerator Center Library.!
