# Bechtel: a center of activity
## 
### 
It may be easy for new students to
cycle past the ivy-covered white
stucco walls and French windows
of the Bechtel International Center
without realizing the wealth of infor
mation inside. The I-Center, located at
the intersection of Lomita Drive and
Mayfield Avenue, is well worth a visit.
New foreign graduate students are
especially encouraged to visit the 1-
center during orientation week. The
center has planned an elaborate
schedule of events including lectures,
tours and dinners tor foreign students
and their spouses. The orientation will
help the foreign student become
familiar with daily life on the Farm —
and life in America in general.
Aside from social programs, the cen
ter serves an important educational
role. A full-time staff, with the help of
volunteers, provides counseling
services to foreign students, helping

them with all immediate needs such as
buying a bicycle or used car or getting
the proper license and insurance.
Programs offered during this year's
orientation include lectures and dis
cussions entitled: "The Reagan World
View and U.S. Foreign Policy," "Staying
Healthy at Stanford" and "Stanford As
We See It," a panel dsicussion on what
to expect from life at Stanford beyond
the classroom.
While the center enables foreign stu
dents and scholars to receive the most
from their stay in the United States, the
I-Center is also valuable for U.S. stu
dents. "It is important to encourage
American students who have an inter
est in international activities to get ac
quainted with the I-Center and
become involved, whether to make
travel plans, to practice another lan
guage or to form friendships with
people from other countries," center

Director Lee Zeigler says.
The center has an Overseas
Resource Center (ORC) on the second
floor which houses information on]
study abroad programs, international'
travel, employment abroad and inter-!
national scholarships.
Zeigler said working at the center
has its rewards because the visiting stu:
dents are so bright. "They are the
future leaders in their fields. Those
foreign students who decide to stay in
the United States contribute to our
country."
The I-Center is open daily to stu
dents and the Stanford community.
There are informal English classes, dis
cussion groups on topics of interna
tional interest, lectures and forums,
monthly art exhibitions and excur
sions. Specific schedules of events are
often listed in The Daily's "Once
Around the Quad."
