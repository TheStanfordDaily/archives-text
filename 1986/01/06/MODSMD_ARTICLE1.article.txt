An external investigation into al
leged police brutality toward stu
dents arrested at an anti-apartheid
demonstration is "unnecessary and
inappropriate," said University
President Donald Kennedy in a
Dec. 11 letter to the members of a
special ASSU investigative commit
tee.
"The idea that the University
cannot be trusted to investigate its
own actions, but must always
resort to outsiders to provide
either justice or the appearance of
justice is a pernicious one. In the
long run, that view cannot fail to
corrode the responsibility the insti
tution must exercise with respect
to its own affairs," states the letter.
Biology Prof. Dow Woodward, a
member of the ASSU investigative
committee, said of Kennedy's let
ter, "I just don't agree with it."
The committee had requested in
a Dec. 4 letter to Kennedy that the
University follow the example of
UC-Berkeley and hire an indepen
dent investigator to look into the
police actions in question, which oc
curred during the Oct. 11 Old
Union arrests of nine students pro
testing Stanford's investment
policy.
Berkeley commissioned an
outside investigator, Alan Kal
manoff, to investigate charges of
police brutality in connection with
anti-apartheid protests at the uni
versity's Moffitt Library.
The independent report was sug
gested to supplement Law Prof.
John Kaplan's investigation. In his
Nov. 4 report, Kaplan recom
mended no disciplinary actions
against the Stanford police officers
involved in the incident.
The decision not to discipline the
officers "was based on my own con
clusions that there was no illegal ac
tion by Stanford police," said Ken
nedy in his letter.
Kennedy defended both Kaplan
and the report, saying it "is clearly
characterized by independence and
open-mindedness, and by sympathy
for the situation for the protesters.
His credentials, as a . . . leading
expert in the fields of criminal pro
cedure and evidence, could not be
improved upon.
"I also reject, most emphatically,
the suggestion that Professor
Kaplan had a conflict of interest,"
said Kennedy, citing the lack of a
"line of authority or other connec
tion between a member of the fac
ulty and our Department of Police
Services."
Because a tenured professor —
such as Kaplan — is protected from
administrative reprisals, "a faculty
member is an 'outside' investigator
in exactly the sense in which that
term is used in connection with in
vestigations of police conduct else
where," Kennedy said.
But ASSU Senate Chair Carey
White disagreed, saying, "There
