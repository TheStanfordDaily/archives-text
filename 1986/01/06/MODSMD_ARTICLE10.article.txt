# New Law Requires Seatbelt Use
## 
### DAVID RISSER Editorial staff 
Stanford student drivers returning to
campus and anxious for that first-of-the-year trip to
Mac Arthur Park must take heed: While you were
vacationing in exotic lands, California's mandatory seat
belt law went into effect.
The seat belt law became effective Jan. 1 and re
quires drivers and passengers to wear seat belts when
they ride in a passenger vehicle in California.
The legislation, authored by Assembly Speaker
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and signed by Gov.
George Deukmejian in October, was one of many laws
to take effect with the new year. It is now also illegal to
ride a bicycle while intoxicated or while wearing head
phones.
Drivers who don't comply with the seat belt law can
be fined $20 for a first offense and up to $50 for addi
tional violations. The law applies to both automobiles
and trucks, and citations can be issued to passengers.

Citations can only be issued, however, if the driver
is stopped for another type of offense. Police officials
have conceded that the law will be difficult to enforce,
but are generally in favor of legislation designed to
reduce carnage on the highways.
The law was enacted to "protect Californians from
needless death and injury, and to reduce taxpayer
costs resulting from traffic collisions," according to a
statement by the California Office of Traffic Safety.
The chances of being killed in an auto accident can be
reduced by 60 to 70 percent when seat belts are worn,
according to the Southern California Automobile Asso
ciation. Vehicle accidents cost the nation more than
$50 billion each year, according to the Department of
Transportation.
California becomes the 16th state to enact a manda
tory seat belt law. The law does not apply to older cars
without seat belts, and there are other, more obscure
restrictions.
