# SCIR Passes Investment Guidelines
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Board of Trustees' Special Committee
on Investment Responsibility (SCIR) last month ap
proved recommendations proposed by the Commission
on Investment Responsibility (C-IR) intended to
strengthen the University's monitoring and evaluation
process of its South African investments.
The SCIR agreed Dec. 9 to modify existing Univer
sity policies regarding investment responsibility, unani
mously accepting the guidelines proposed by C-IR.
The C-IR's proposal includes a list of conditions by
which the University can determine whether compan
ies carrying Stanford investments cause "substantial
social injury" through their activities in South Africa.
Evaluations of the companies will be carried out by the
C-IR.
Plans to examine specific companies will commence
at a C-IR meeting Thursday, according to C-IR Chair
man Richard Brody.
Included in the list of considerations are such posi
tive factors as adherence to the Sullivan Principles,
membership in the U.S. Corporate Council on South
Africa, and "appropriate recognition and support of
groups currently excluded from the political process
which actively work against apartheid."
The Board of Trustees, which declared in June 1985
that "the lack of progress in the past years (in South
Africa)" necessitates "more effective monitoring . . .

of companies in which Stanford holds equity," must ap
prove the C-IK's recommendations before the Univer
sity will take steps to divest or disinvest from specific
companies.
Brody acknowledged yesterday that although "some
important statements had been made," the new
guidelines did not represent a major change from the
existing policy.
"We're not out for a confrontation with the trus
tees," Brody said, but added, "we've spelled out
guidelines that were not explicit in the past."
C-IR student member Joel Bellenson said yesterday
that while he acknowledges the acceptance of the com
mission's proposal as "a step in the right direction," he
was disappointed that the C-IR will be evaluating only a
few companies.
"It's a pretty weak step," Bellenson said. "The pres
ence of all companies (in South Africa) is damaging."
Bellenson, a senior, said that the C-IR has operated
on the assumption that Stanford trustees need to be
"led along gently" and thus "(the C-IR) won't propose
anything that won't pass."
Bellenson added he was not convinced that a poor
rating given to a company by the C-IR would actually
induce the University to withdraw its investments from
the company.
Brody said, however, that the trustees will probably
accept the recommendations of the C-IR concerning
the impending evaluations.
"The burden is on us to make our arguments as
sound as possible," Brody said.
