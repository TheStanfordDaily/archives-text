## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Trends To Support 
### 
As 1986 brings Stanford students to make new
year's resolutions, The Daily recommends that we
all resolve to continue one of the most positive
trends of 1985: We must continue to look beyond
ourselves and fight to help others.
Throughout the '80s, we have been barraged with
media attention to the career-oriented, self
centered yuppie. Last year proved such doom
sayers wrong. Nineteen eighty-five brought a
strengthened commitment to public service and an
upsurge in student political activism not seen since
the 19605.
Of course, the biggest story at Stanford in the
spring was the activity in opposition to apartheid and
Stanford's investments in companies that do busi
ness in South Africa. Students slept outside Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy's office, were ar
rested and argued their case in court, held rallies
with more than 1,000 people and put forth respon
sible proposals calling for Stanford to divest totally
in order to weaken the apartheid regime.
This activity has continued this past quarter, with
more protests and the arrests of more than 40 stu
dents. Activists continue to sacrifice their studies
for the benefit of people who often seem very far
removed from our reality.
Support for labor proved that Stanford students
can and do identify with workers, as efforts
abounded to support United Stanford Workers in
their fight for job security during contract negotia
tions last fall. Even a strike in Watsonville was not
too far away to capture Stanford's attention. Stu
dents held a benefit that raised hundreds of dollars
so striking cannery workers could feed their families
over the holidays.
Student government even got into the act, led by
the ASSU Council of Presidents' philosophy: If you
don't like something, change it. The COP proposed
a drastic change in the ASSU's structure to trans
form it from a bureaucratic organization into a repre
sentative voice of the student body. The ASSU fol
lowed that philosophy by setting up a commission to
investigate police brutality after the University in
vestigation proved inadequate.
Many different campaigns were waged: Women

protested Playboy's use of Stanford students for
models; seniors demonstrated their concern for the
fate of the earth by petitioning to invite Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev to Commencement; and
students upset with losing control over the Coffee
House set up an alternative espresso bar. The end
of the year even saw the beginnings of a movement
to make Stanford a sanctuary for Central American
refugees.
Minority student organizations continued their
commitment to their communities: The Black Stu
dent Union fought for theme dorms and against
apartheid and alleged police harassment of black stu
dents, organizing a rally of hundreds to protest the
alleged brutality against senior Robby Perkins.
Asian-Americans fought for the right to learn about
their own heritage and won a class on Asian-
American history. Chicano students formed a new
political organization to accompany their already
strong aid to their community.
Public service also found friends at Stanford. Stu
dents organized drives to raise funds for relief after
the Mexico earthquake and the Colombian volcanic
eruption. Stanford joined a nationwide university
public service drive, and the spring quarter hunger
conference set a positive example for future in
itiatives.
This upsurge in concern for others was not lim
ited to students. Statistics Prof. Charles Stein
became the first faculty member to be arrested in
several years for his protest against the alleged
police brutality. Former English Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin and former graduate student Stephen
Mosher continued their fights against what they
believe to be unfair treatment by the University,
and Clifford Johnson pursued, using his own time
and money, his suit against Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger, challenging that "launch on
warning" of U. S. nuclear forces violates the Consti
tution.
Of course, the work is not finished â€” injustice
and suffering remain commonplace in today's world.
For this reason, the Stanford community must
resolve to sustain and expand its commitment to
others.
