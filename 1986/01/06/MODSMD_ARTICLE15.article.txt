## Crisis in Central Asia 
### 
We have little accurate reporting
on developments in the Soviet oc
cupation of Afghanistan. We depend
largely on diplomatic sources in
Delhi, India, from which we leam of
Soviet brutalities and attacks by the
Afghan rebels.
The Soviet media paints a differ
ent picture. For a long time it
avoided the issue by simply refer
ring to "the limited contingent of
Soviet troops (or volunteers!) in Af-

ghanistan at the request of the Af
ghan government." Then casualties
made it clear that the Soviet troops
were engaged in bitter fighting, and
the press began running stories
from the battle areas, giving little
precise information and always
reporting the defeat of the rebels.
The Afghans are depicted as
fanatics supported by the United
States, Pakistan, China and the
reactionary Arab states. Occasion
ally Iran is mentioned too, but the
Soviet media avoids criticism of
Khomeini lest he step up his activ
ity in the Moslem areas of the So
viet Union.
The summit meeting between
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
and President Reagan in Geneva
produced headlines in the U.S.
press about Reagan's challenge to
Gorbachev to set a timetable for
withdrawal from Afghanistan. None
of this has appeared in the Soviet
press, which repeatedly accused
Reagan of bringing up "regional is
sues" in order to avoid the main
ones, namely nuclear disarmament
and the Stategic Defense Initiative.
It would be nice if Gorbachev
said uncle to Reagan, but there is
no indication that he will. The eu
phoria about the planned second and
third summits should be tempered
with the realization that three even
tualities are possible.
The first is that the fighting in Af
ghanistan will go on and on, making
the summits look like futile theater.
The second is that Afghanistan's
Babrak Karmal regime will be con
solidated and that the Soviet in
volvement miy be lessened. This
move would be a setback for the
United States. The third possibility
is that the Afghan rebels will have
more successes in their resistance
to the Soviet occupation. Success
ful resistance would be a setback to
the Soviet Union, but such an even

tuality would not lead the Soviets to
withdraw from Afghanistan as the
United States withdrew from Viet
nam. That is not the way the Soviet
Union operates in a region so close
to Soviet Central Asia. Reagan's
timetable for Soviet withdrawal is
even more unrealistic than our
demands that Cuban troops be
removed from Africa.
The Soviet Union regards its role
in Afghanistan as the continuation of
its conquests in Central Asia in the
last century and the first decades of
this one. The very words it uses to
describe the rebels are those that
were used to describe the Moslems
the Russians defeated in Central
Asia.
In the West there has been much
talk of the Soviet empire
"exploding," the primary reference
being to violent outbreaks among
the Moslem population. Little solid
evidence has been adduced. The Is-

lamic population of the Soviet Union
rs largely Sunni, except in Azer
baidzhan, where objective reports
suggest that the Soviet atheistic
campaign has had considerable suc
cess. A similar campaign among the
populations of Central Asia has had
a comparable impact. However
such calm may be an illusion.
While the Soviet media never
mentions unrest among the Moslem
populations, there is evidence that
it is growing. Striking in this regard
is a 17-part television series made
in Uzbek and then dubbed in Rus
sian. Pravda (Oct. 24, 1985)
devoted an unusually long review to
it. The hero of the program is a
poet, Hamza Khakimzade Niyazi,
whom Soviet propaganda has built
up into the Uzbek revolutionary
hero. His name has been given to
schools, streets and libraries. He
was the first Uzbek proletarian
poet. Born in 1889, he was killed by
nationalists in 1929. He died with
his head high and became "more
than a poet; he was the soul of the

Uzbek people."
The film describes a people suf
fering under harsh feudalism and a
dogmatic faith used by the Islamic
priests for their selfish ends. A
hero of the film is Mikhail Funze,
who commanded Soviet troops in
Central Asia and is the symbol of
the Soviet army as Lenin is the
symbol of the Communists Party.
The Pravda review makes this re
vealing statement: "The lessons of
that war do not belong just to his
tory. Today religious fanatics and
nationalist landlords who have lost
their estates are burning villages."
The poet was condemned to death
by stoning, in the Moslem fashion.
Pravda does not refer to Afghani
stan or Soviet Central Asia, but the
fact that this television epic was
made in Uzbek by leading Uzbek
actors is evidence that the Kremlin
thinks the population needs a heavy
dose of ideological indoctrination.

Coming in the wake of the Iran
crisis, a Soviet reversal in Afghani
stan would be a devastating blow
for Soviet prestige in Central Asia.
We have no evidence that the So
viet Army would accept a loss of
face. In fact, it seems that the army
blames the party for the mess in Af
ghanistan. Gorbachev has
responded with a series of state
ments indicating a harder line.
Reagan's congenital optimism
may have gotten the better of him,
and the American public will have
fooled itself once more. But, if we
enjoy the thought of a Soviet
debacle in Afghanistan, the Consti
tution gives us the right to the pur
suit of happiness. However, at last
we have some evidence of the
Kremlin's serious concern about
the Moslem population of Central
Asia. Perhaps the explosion theory
will not explode in our faces.
