Gorbachev Visit
Is Inappropriate
I am writing to voice my opposi
tion to any invitation to Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev to speak
at Stanford Commencement exer
cises, however unlikely his accep
tance of an invitation might be.
While I am not averse to Gorba
chev visiting the campus and
speaking at another time, I feel
that the graduation ceremony is a
particularly inappropriate forum for
the views of a Soviet leader.
Stanford University, however
imperfect in the eyes of some, is
an institution dedicated to the
search for truth. This is accom
plished through the presence of
many distinguished and learned
men and women blessed with the
right to teach a wide range of com
peting ideas. Students are pro
vided with an atmosphere con
ducive to questioning and are regu
larly encouraged to exercise their
intellects in their own search for
truth. Teachers and students may
discuss and profess views
diametrically opposed to those of
the University administration and
the national government and may
even work effectively to change
the policies of either leadership —
within the bounds of very liberal
laws, without fear of arbitrary
arrest, blacklisting or other forms
of persecution.
Students in the Soviet Union, as
should be well known, are not
granted this kind of freedom.
Marxism-Leninism is taught as
gospel, so to speak, and competing
ideologies are rejected with little
study. Students who question the
stance of the Soviet government
on issues, much less demonstrate
or "sit in" — should they even
have access to opposing positions

or develop such positions on their
own — can face expulsion from the
university, exclusion from profes
sional training or jobs of their
choice, and arrest. This
"educational" system is repugnant
to any beneficiary of a liberal edu
cation.
Our university, flawed though it
occasionally may be, is one of
which I am proud, and the Com
mencement ceremonies in which I
will take part this June ought to
reflect its great, free tradition. The
presence of Gorbachev, who
represents a system in which
these traditions of political and
academic freedom are actively
opposed, would be most un
welcome to me. If students and
staff would like to hear him speak,
let him come. I would go to hear
him and question the repressive
policies of his government. Indeed,
if some here truly believe that he
could raise important issues to aid
in the University's search for
truth, it is their responsibility to
see that he comes. But there must
be a better forum than Stanford's
graduation ceremonies for the
views of an anti-freedom, anti
liberal, anti-democratic Soviet
ruler.

wishes to express its gratitude to
those who made it possible for the
Palo Alto City Council to pass a
motion on Dec. 2 that calls for
divestment of city funds from fin
ancial institutions that do business
in South Africa.

We particularly wish to thank the
three council members who intro
duced and took clear, unequivocal
positions in favor of the motion:
Councilors Larry Klein, Ellen .
Fletcher and Emily Renzel. But
thanks are also due to the
hundreds of local residents who
signed petitions and to those who
joined us in sitting through two
long council meetings to demon
strate and voice support for the
measure. Four councilors were
excused from the vote because of
possible conflict of interest, al
though they had the opportunity to
participate in the discussion, and
the motion passed with three in
favor and two abstentions.
The sad part is that such an
expenditure of energy was neces- " t
sary on a clear-cut moral issue and
that many councilors still appear to
lack the heart and the sense of
leadership to join in effective action
against apartheid. The main excuse
they used in attempting to avoid
this burning issue was to suppose
that local politics can and should be
isolated from global questions that
affect all of us. But the real ques
tion is whether councilors who
evade such issues are capable of
judging local issues as well. These
excuses are all the more reprehen
sible because there is little financial
impact on the city whose invest
ments are said to be practically
"clean." Palo Alto should be proud
that the city staff has already
shown this kind of social responsi
bility, and there should have been
no hesitation in joining over 50
cities in their economic condemna
tion of apartheid.
Racism and peace are local is
sues, and they are linked together.
As the slogan goes, "If you want
peace, work for justice."

isolated from global questions that
affect all of us. But the real ques
tion is whether councilors who
evade such issues are capable of
judging local issues as well. These
excuses are all the more reprehen
sible because there is little financial
impact on the city whose invest
ments are said to be practically
"clean." Palo Alto should be proud
that the city staff has already
shown this kind of social responsi
bility, and there should have been
no hesitation in joining over 50
cities in their economic condemna
tion of apartheid.
Racism and peace are local is
sues, and they are linked together.
As the slogan goes, "If you want
peace, work for justice."

Gorbachev Visit
Is Inappropriate
I am writing to voice my opposi
tion to any invitation to Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev to speak
at Stanford Commencement exer
cises, however unlikely his accep
tance of an invitation might be.
While I am not averse to Gorba
chev visiting the campus and
speaking at another time, I feel
that the graduation ceremony is a
particularly inappropriate forum for
the views of a Soviet leader.
Stanford University, however
imperfect in the eyes of some, is
an institution dedicated to the
search for truth. This is accom
plished through the presence of
many distinguished and learned
men and women blessed with the
right to teach a wide range of com
peting ideas. Students are pro
vided with an atmosphere con
ducive to questioning and are regu
larly encouraged to exercise their
intellects in their own search for
truth. Teachers and students may
discuss and profess views
diametrically opposed to those of
the University administration and
the national government and may
even work effectively to change
the policies of either leadership —
within the bounds of very liberal
laws, without fear of arbitrary
arrest, blacklisting or other forms
of persecution.
Students in the Soviet Union, as
should be well known, are not
granted this kind of freedom.
Marxism-Leninism is taught as
gospel, so to speak, and competing
ideologies are rejected with little
study. Students who question the
stance of the Soviet government
on issues, much less demonstrate
or "sit in" — should they even
have access to opposing positions

or develop such positions on their
own — can face expulsion from the
university, exclusion from profes
sional training or jobs of their
choice, and arrest. This
"educational" system is repugnant
to any beneficiary of a liberal edu
cation.
Our university, flawed though it
occasionally may be, is one of
which I am proud, and the Com
mencement ceremonies in which I
will take part this June ought to
reflect its great, free tradition. The
presence of Gorbachev, who
represents a system in which
these traditions of political and
academic freedom are actively
opposed, would be most un
welcome to me. If students and
staff would like to hear him speak,
let him come. I would go to hear
him and question the repressive
policies of his government. Indeed,
if some here truly believe that he
could raise important issues to aid
in the University's search for
truth, it is their responsibility to
see that he comes. But there must
be a better forum than Stanford's
graduation ceremonies for the
views of an anti-freedom, anti
liberal, anti-democratic Soviet
ruler.

City Council
Deserves Thanks
The Mid-Peninsula Coalition
Against Apartheid (MPCAA)
wishes to express its gratitude to
those who made it possible for the
Palo Alto City Council to pass a
motion on Dec. 2 that calls for
divestment of city funds from fin
ancial institutions that do business
in South Africa.

We particularly wish to thank the
three council members who intro
duced and took clear, unequivocal
positions in favor of the motion:
Councilors Larry Klein, Ellen .
Fletcher and Emily Renzel. But
thanks are also due to the
hundreds of local residents who
signed petitions and to those who
joined us in sitting through two
long council meetings to demon
strate and voice support for the
measure. Four councilors were
excused from the vote because of
possible conflict of interest, al
though they had the opportunity to
participate in the discussion, and
the motion passed with three in
favor and two abstentions.
The sad part is that such an
expenditure of energy was neces- " t
sary on a clear-cut moral issue and
that many councilors still appear to
lack the heart and the sense of
leadership to join in effective action
against apartheid. The main excuse
they used in attempting to avoid
this burning issue was to suppose
that local politics can and should be
isolated from global questions that
affect all of us. But the real ques
tion is whether councilors who
evade such issues are capable of
judging local issues as well. These
excuses are all the more reprehen
sible because there is little financial
impact on the city whose invest
ments are said to be practically
"clean." Palo Alto should be proud
that the city staff has already
shown this kind of social responsi
bility, and there should have been
no hesitation in joining over 50
cities in their economic condemna
tion of apartheid.
Racism and peace are local is
sues, and they are linked together.

peace, work for justice."
