## It Wasn't Meant To Be in 1985 Spikers Upset In the Final 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
KALAMAZOO, Mich. — The
script could not have been written
any better. The Stanford women's
volleyball team had finished fourth,
third and second in the nation,
respectively, in the past three
years. This was to be the year to
win the championship.
The Cardinal was ranked No. 1
and claimed the country's top
player in Kim Oden. A national title
would be a fitting conclusion to the
team's magnificent season and
Oden's celebrated career.
But on Dec. 22, before a record
crowd at the Read Fieldhouse here,
the University of the Pacific Tigers
halted the presses and rewrote the
ending to the story, defeating Stan
ford in the national championship
game by scores of 15-17, 15-7, 15-
12 and 15-13.
Some observers might say it was
the Ghost of Christmas Past that
tormented the Cardinal after it had
taken an 11-2 lead in the fourth
game. It was only last Christmas
♦.hat Stanford had failed to hold a
similar 11-2 advantage against
UCLA in game five of the champi
onship.
However, in reality it was a
group of red-hot UOP hitters who
denied the Cardinal its first title.
"We had some career efforts out
there tonight," Tiger Coach John
Dunning said after the match.
Stanford, which had played in a
lackluster fashion while defeating
Colorado State and Brigham Young
to capture the West Regional Dec.
13-16 at Maples Pavilion, drew a
talented, but puzzling, USC team in
the semi-finals Dec. 20 here.
The Cardinal played a solid, if not
exciting match, while the Trojans,
slowed in part by the flu bug,
seemed to play with little energy.
The result was a convincing 15-9,

7-15, 15-10, 15-6 Stanford victory.
Oden, who was named the na
tion's Player of the Year prior to the
final, was superb against USC,
nailing 15 kills while not committing
any hitting errors. Junior Barbra
Fontana added 13 kills for a .366
hitting percentage and led the team
defensively with 14 kills. •
UOP, which disposed of
defending-champion UCLA in the
semi-finals, figured to put up a
much tougher challenge than USC
and proved to be too much for the
Cardinal in the championship. The
Tigers had more weapons than
Stanford in a championship victory
that was arguably more one-sided
than the score indicated.
"Basically we got beat by the
better team," Cardinal Co-coach
Don Shaw said. "Obviously we're
disappointed. We don't feel like we
played as well as we could have.
"I think we didn't have a real
deep team," he added. "We didn't
have people we could throw in if
someone wasn't going right. It's
hard to get going in a rhythm when
one player is off. It's a team game."
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
UOP had all too many players. The
Tigers had been seeded No. 2 in
the tournament because of the likes
of freshman sensation Elaina Oden,
who is ready to assume the title of
the nation's top player now that her
sister Kim has graduated.
Elaina had her heart set on going
to Stanford, but she was not ac
cepted. Her decision to attend
Pacific was a last-second one and,
needless to say, one that people in
the Stockton community will always
remember.
While the match-up of the Oden
sisters was nearly a draw (Kim had
27 kills for a .404 percentage, and
Elaina hit at a .400 clip with 24
kills.), the supporting cast for
Pacific was simply sensational.


With heip from freshmen Nancy Reno, above, the Cardinal
defeated BYU in the Western Regionals here over the break.
