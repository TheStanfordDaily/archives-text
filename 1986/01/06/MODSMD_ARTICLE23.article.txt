# Fresno Snaps Card Streak
## Women's basketball falls 64-50 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
Despite a 64-50 loss to the Fresno State Bulldogs
in the championship game of the Nevada-Reno
Tournament Dec. 28, one can't help but feel opti
mistic about the rest of the season for the Stanford
women's basketball team.
Spoilsports should consider the following:
The two-point loss to an exceptional Bulldog
squad (11-1) broke an impressive six-game Cardinal
winning streak. Included in that six game span was a
62-59 victory over the University of Nevada-Las
Vegas, a team which was, at the time, ranked
seventh in the nation .
Last year's freshman All-American and leading
Stanford scorer, 6-foot forward Kami Anderson, has
returned from a stress fracture and is once again
providing the Cardinal with a much-needed offensive
weapon. Her 16 points against Fresno led the team.
According to women's basketball Coach Tara
VanDerveer, two other freshmen, Jill Yanke and
Evon Asforis, have improved a great deal and have
established themselves as mainstays in Stanford's
scoring and rebounding departments.
These recent developments are sources of en
couragement for the 8-4 Cardinal, but VanDerveer

tempers such waves of optimism with caution and a
critical coach's eye.
"We've come a long way, but we need to work
more on our defensive pressure. We just have to
prepare ourselves against better competition," Van-
Derveer said.
This was evident against the Bulldogs.
"We failed to adjust to a higher level of play," the
coach said. "We had no inside defense, and we didn't
shoot very well, especially in the second half. Our
press didn't bother them like it has other teams."
After bothering Portland and San Francisco State
by scores of 79-52 and 110-57, the Cardinal had to
prepare itself against better competition in the form
of the Runnin' Rebels from UNLV. And Stanford did
just that.
"It was a great team victory," VanDerveer said.
"Everyone showed more concentration, which is
what we'll need to do against better competition."
Yanke, a 6-5 center, concentrated enough to sink
nine of 10 shots. Her 20 points were a career-high.
After handing UC-Santa Barbara a 61-59 loss at
Maples Pavilion, Stanford dumped Washington
State, 61-50, and Montana State, 83-65, during the
first two rounds of the Nevada-Reno Tournament,
setting up the championship showdown against the
Bulldogs.
