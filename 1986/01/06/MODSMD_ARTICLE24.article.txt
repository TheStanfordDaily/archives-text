# One of 25 to get NCAA scholarship
## Soderlund Earns Award 
### PETER HAVEN Editorial staff 
Matt Soderlund, the Stanford
linebacker who led the team in 1985
with 139 stops, was named the win
ner of a $2,000 post-graduate
scholarship by the NCAA today.
Soderlund is one of 25 collegiate
football players across the country
to be awarded the NCAA honor. A
fifth-year student with a 3.3 GPA
here, Soderlund plans to earn his
masters degree in the Food Re
search Institute this June after
graduating last year with a major in
human biology.
"1 was pretty surprised." Soder
lund said yesterday about the news
of his award. "It's quite an honor."
Soderlund said the NCAA post
graduate scholarship was based on

an application process that included
a nomination from the dean of his
academic department as well as the
athletic department.
A four-year letter winner, Soder
lund has been a starter since his
freshman year on the Farm, and he
started 44 straight games for the
Cardinal squad before his final game
in November against UC-Berkeley.
Following the 1985 campaign,
Soderlund earned First Team Aca
demic All-American and First Team
Pac-10 All Academic Team honors.
In addition to serving as a re
search assistant in Stanford's
Graduate School of Business,
Soderlund spent one summer
working as a congressional intern
for his home-state senator, Steve
Symms (R-Idaho).
When asked about how he'll use

the scholarship, Soderlund said,
"I'll probably defer it for at least a
year. I'm not ready for another year
of school. I've been going to school
for awhile, and I'd just like to take a
break."
Though his plans "aren't con
crete," Soderlund said he would
probably use the -scholarship
toward business school in the event
he decides to use it at all.
Soderlund said he would like to
get a job in the Bay Area next year
and "see how things work out."
This is the third straight year a
Stanford football player has been
awarded an NCAA post-graduate
scholarship. Last year offensive
guard Scott Carpenter won the
award, and he was preceded by de
fensive lineman John Bergren in
1983.
