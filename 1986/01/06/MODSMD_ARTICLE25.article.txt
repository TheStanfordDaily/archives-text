# The 						Pack Catches Up, In 70-69 Husky win
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Stanford's hopes of opening the
Pacific 10 Conference season 2-0
were shot down Thursday when
guard A 1 Moscatel hit a 20-foot
jumper from left of the circle with
six seconds left, leading Washington
to a 70-69 victory over the Cardinal
in front of 6,483 fans at Maples
Pavilion.
An 84-67 victory at home against
Washington State two days earlier
had put the Cardinal in a tie for first
place for a mere two days. The win
was the first in a conference opener
for Stanford since 1972.
Stanford is now 1-1 in the Pac-10
and 7-7 overall, as is Washington.
Stanford had a chance at the end
against the Huskies, but forward
Todd Lichti's 20-footer from the
right wing bounced off the rim as
the buzzer sounded.
"It felt a little long, and then it
was long," said Lichti, who finished
with 14 points. "I probably should
have made a dribble or two, but I
wouldn't say that's why we lost the
game."
"With six seconds to go, you
can't ask for a better shot — an 18-
to 20-footer and in the hands of
your best shooter," Stanford Coach
Tom Davis said.
The Cardinal had taken a 69-68
lead with 20 seconds left when cen
ter Howard Wright hit a pair of free
throws, but Moscatel found himself
open and hit the game-winner.
"He's a good one to take that
last-second shot," Washington
Coach Andy Russo said of Mos
catel. "He's a winner. He took one
like that last week against McNeese
State when we were tied, he
missed it, and we lost in overtime.
That shows how much confidence
he has in himself. He saw the shot
and took it."
The win was the first in the Pac
-10 for Russo, who replaced Marv
Harshman this season at Washing
ton. "Putting things in perspective,
you always look at a league win on
the road as gravy. We're 1-1 in the
league with two teams coming in
next week. Things are looking real
good."

Washington was the preseason
pick to win the conference, but a
62-60 loss at California on Thursday
left them in danger of going 0-2 to
open. The victory Saturday left
them tied with Stanford, UCLA and
USC in fourth place at 1-1, behind
Cal and Oregon State at 2-0 and

Arizona at 1-0.
Things looked good for Stanford
when Husky center Christian Welp,
who finished with 12 points, fouled
out with 2:29 left and the game tied
at 65-65. Greg Butler missed the

during the break, pacing the Cardinal to big wins over Yale,
Seattle and Harvard.
front end of the one-and-one, but
Lichti scored off the rebound for a
67-65 Cardinal lead.
Paul Fortier, who scored 14 of
his 15 points in the second half to
keep Washington in the game,
missed a free throw after Wright
fouled him to keep Stanford ahead

by one, but Keith Ramee lost the
ball out of bounds attempting to
drive. Phil Zevenbergen hit a layup
to put Washington up 68-67, with 54
seconds left, but missed a possible
three-point play.
Moscatel fouled Wright, who hit
his two shots, but then came back
to be the hero. He finished with 15
points to tie Fortier for the team
lead.
Stanford had held a slim 31-30
lead at halftime, but came out

quickly in the second half to take a
46-38 lead five minutes into the
half, its biggest of the night. The
Huskies fought back to force a 57-
57 tie at the 7:33 mark, but didn't
lead until the final minute.
Novian Whitsitt had 19 points
starting in place of Steve Brown,
who is again suffering from a stress
fracture in his right leg, the same
injury that caused him to miss all of
last season. Brown will have a bone
scan tomorrow that will determine

the extent of the injury.
"I don't feel any need to pick up
the slack," Whitsitt said. "The only
thing that has changed is that I'm
getting more minutes."
Wright finished with 11 points,
and Earl Koberlein had 10 for Stan
ford.
Against Washington State, the
Cardinal played what Davis called
"probably our best game of the
year. We've played better stretches
against UNLV and Maryland, but

riever 40 minutes like that."
The Cardinal led only 41-37 at
halftime, but steadily wore down
the Cougars in the second half,
committing only two turnovers in
the final 20 minutes.
"There weren't any holes," said
Whitsitt, who finished with 16
points. "I felt the whole team had a
solid effort."
With the 45-second clock this
season, Stanford went into "The
Roll" — its slowdown offense —

with two-and-one-half minutes to
go, a little later than in previous
years. Ramee, though, executed it
as well as ever, hitting a layup and
six straight free throws in the final
two minutes to finish with 14 points
in addition to his seven assists.
Lichti had 17 points to lead Stan
ford, and Koberlein added 15.
Wright pulled down 12 rebounds.
All-Conference guard Keith Mor
rison scored 17 to pace the
Cougars.
