# The
						Pack Catches Up, In 70-69 Husky win

### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Stanford's hopes of opening the
Pacific 10 Conference season 2-0
were shot down Thursday when
guard A 1 Moscatel hit a 20-foot
jumper from left of the circle with
six seconds left, leading Washington
to a 70-69 victory over the Cardinal
in front of 6,483 fans at Maples
Pavilion.
An 84-67 victory at home against
Washington State two days earlier
had put the Cardinal in a tie for first
place for a mere two days. The win
was the first in a conference opener
for Stanford since 1972.
Stanford is now 1-1 in the Pac-10
and 7-7 overall, as is Washington.
Stanford had a chance at the end
against the Huskies, but forward
Todd Lichti's 20-footer from the
right wing bounced off the rim as
the buzzer sounded.
"It felt a little long, and then it
was long," said Lichti, who finished
with 14 points. "I probably should
have made a dribble or two, but I
wouldn't say that's why we lost the
game."
"With six seconds to go, you
can't ask for a better shot â€” an 18-
to 20-footer and in the hands of
your best shooter," Stanford Coach
Tom Davis said.
The Cardinal had taken a 69-68
lead with 20 seconds left when cen
ter Howard Wright hit a pair of free
throws, but Moscatel found himself
open and hit the game-winner.
"He's a good one to take that
last-second shot," Washington
Coach Andy Russo said of Mos
catel. "He's a winner. He took one
like that last week against McNeese
State when we were tied, he
missed it, and we lost in overtime.
That shows how much confidence
he has in himself. He saw the shot
and took it."
The win was the first in the Pac
-10 for Russo, who replaced Marv
Harshman this season at Washing
ton. "Putting things in perspective,
you always look at a league win on
the road as gravy. We're 1-1 in the
league with two teams coming in
next week. Things are looking real
good."

Washington was the preseason
pick to win the conference, but a
62-60 loss at California on Thursday
left them in danger of going 0-2 to
open. The victory Saturday left
them tied with Stanford, UCLA and
USC in fourth place at 1-1, behind
Cal and Oregon State at 2-0 and

Arizona at 1-0.
Things looked good for Stanford
when Husky center Christian Welp,
who finished with 12 points, fouled
out with 2:29 left and the game tied
at 65-65. Greg Butler missed the

Though freshman forward Todd Lichti missed a 20-footer at the
buzzer against Washington, he was Stanford's hottest shooter
during the break, pacing the Cardinal to big wins over Yale,
Seattle and Harvard.
