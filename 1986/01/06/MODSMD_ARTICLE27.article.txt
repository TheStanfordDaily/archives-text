### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
From Dec. 6-29, the Cardinal played 10
games, winning four and losing six. Here's a
recap of the action:
Stanford 129, Yale 108
The Cardinal scored a school-record 70
points in the first half and went on to shatter
the single-game scoring record in the first
round of the Apple Invitational at Maples
Pavilion on Dec. 6.
Todd Lichti scored 23 points to lead seven
Stanford players who were in double figures.
Stanford's previous single-game record of 115
points, set two years ago against Hawaii
Pacific, fell with 4:59 remaining on a pair of
free throws by Earl Koberlein. The Maples
Pavilion record of 120, set by UCLA in 1965,
fell when Neil Johnson hit a baseline jumper
with 2:04 remaining in the game.
Richmond 57, Stanford 53
John Newman scored 16 points to lead the
No. 24 Spiders past Stanford in the champion
ship game of the Apple Invitational at Maples
Dec. 7. Newman, the unanimous choice for
tournament MVP, had scored 38 the night
before against St. Mary's.
Stanford's defense forced several Spider
turnovers down the stretch, but couldn't con
vert at the offensive end. The Cardinal shot
only 34 percent in the game, and Brown, with
11 points, was the only player in double fig
ures.
Stanford 105, Seattle 54
The Cardinal opened a 52-22 lead at halftime
and cruised past the Chieftains Dec. 13 at

Maples. Stanford used a 48-24 edge in
rebounding and 35 Seattle turnovers to break
100 points for the third time in four games.
Stanford 78, Harvard 62
Lichti scored 20 points to lead the Cardinal
to the win Dec. 17 in Cambridge, Mass. The
Cardinal defense forced 28 Crimson turn
overs. Brown scored 15 and Howard Wright
had 14 for Stanford, which led 39-30 at
halftime. BillMohler had 16 for Harvard.
North Carolina 89, Stanford 55
The Cardinal shot a miserable 27 percent
from the field as the No. 1 Tar Heels rolled to
victory in front of 10,000 fans in Chapel Hill,
N.C., on Dec. 20. UNC led 45-25 at halftime
and had 12 players in the scoring column.
Greg Butler scored 12 points, and Lichti had

halftime deficit to edge the Cardinal in
overtime Dec. 22 at Maples Pavilion. The
game was tied 67-67 at the end of regulation,
but Seton Hall, of the Big East Conference,
outscored Stanford 9-8 in overtime for the
win.
Novian Whitsitt had 12 points and Wright
added 11. Andre McCloud had 17 to lead the
Pirates.

to lead the Cardinal effort. Whitsitt scored 15,
and Lichti had 10.
Stanford 77, Chaminade 59

high 20 points and pace the Cardinal. Lichti and
Whitsitt added 12 each, and Koberlein had 11.
Maryland 67, Stanford 65, 20T
John Johnson hit a 20-footer with four
seconds remaining in the second overtime as
the No. 22 Terrapins edged the Cardinal Dec.
28 in the opener of the Hawaii Pacific Invita
tional.
Stanford led for the first 19 minutes of the
second half, but Keith Gatlin scored with 30
seconds remaining to tie the game at 55-55 and
send it into overtime. Maryland held a pair of
two-point leads in the first overtime, but the
Cardinal rallied to even things at 59-59. Stan
ford led three times in the second extra per
iod, but it was Johnson's jumper that put the
Terps up for good.
Fordham 69, Stanford 66
The Rams took control in the final two
minutes to down the Cardinal in the consola
tion game of the Hawaii Pacific Invitational in
Honolulu on Dec. 29. Lichti had 21 points and
