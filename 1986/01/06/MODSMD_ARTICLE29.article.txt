# Raiders Upset, Bears Roll
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The
New England Patriots, scoring on
a fumbled kickoff for the third
time in four games, scored 10
points within 14 seconds late in
the third quarter to upset the Los
Angeles Raiders 27-20 yesterday
and set up a showdown with the
Miami Dolphins for the AFC title.
It was the 11th win in the last
13 games for the Patriots, who
took advantage of six turnovers
by the Raiders to overcome a 10-
point second-quarter deficit to
create their third meeting of the
year with Miami next Sunday in
the Orange Bowl, where they
haven't won in their last 18 tries.
It was a victory forged by the
running of Craig James, who ran
for 104 yards on 23 carries, the
first 100-yard game against the
Raiders this year, and a defense

that held the Raiders scoreless in
the second half and forced six
turnovers — three fumbles, two
interceptions by cornerback
Ronnie Lippett and a third by
safety Fred Marion.
The turning point in the
mistake-filled game came after
Tony Franklin's 32-yard field goal
had tied the game at 20-20 with
1:11 remaining in the period.
On the ensuing kickoff, the
Raiders' Sam Seale fielded the
ball at his own nine, dropped the
ball, picked it up, then fiimbled
again when he was hit by Mosi
Tatupu. The ball rolled toward
the goal line with a covey of
players chasing it until Jim Bow
man, a rookie safety, fell on the
ball for what proved to be the
winning score.
Meanwhile, in Chicago, Jim

McMahon threw touchdown
passes of 23 and 20 yards to Den
nis McKinnon, and a brutal
defense led by Richard Dent
powered the Chicago Bears to a
21-0 victory over the New York
Giants.
The Bears' defense, ranked
No. 1 in the league during the
season, throttled the Giants vir
tually all day. New York quarter
back Phil Simms was sacked six
times for 60 yards in losses. Dent
had three of the sacks, col
laborated with Otis Wilson for an
other, and Mike Singletary and
Gary Fencik added the others.
The closest the Giants came to
scoring occurred on their final
play of the first half when Eric
Schubert's 19-yard field-goal at
tempt hit the left upright and
bounced back.
