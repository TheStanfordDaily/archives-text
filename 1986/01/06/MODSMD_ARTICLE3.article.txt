The University announced Tues

varsity football players who were
arrested by the Palo Alto police last
month on various felony charges,
including forgery, burglary and re
ceiving or possessing stolen prop
erty.
Freshman Sam Sutherland, soph
omore Ken Richardson and junior

Stanford Shopping Center after at
tempting to use checks and credit
cards stolen from sophomore David
Sweeney to purchase $470 worth of
clothing, according to police.
Sweeney is the starting kicker for
the football team.
Andrew Parnes, an attorney with
Nolan and Parnes, said all three are
planning to plead innocent in Palo
Alto Municipal Court Jan. 14, ac

Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole
said the three are being inves
tigated for violating the Fundamen
tal Standard. If found guilty by the
University, she said, the penalties
could range from censure to expul

other instances of students stealing

from other students, but none that
could be regarded as a precedent.
None of the three charged could
be reached for comment last night.
Sweeney declined to comment until
the incident is resolved.
Police records also show that the
three used a Visa card stolen from
junior Dan Brumbaugh to charge
$1,700 of merchandise. Sutherland
also cashed checks stolen from
Brumbaugh for another $800, ac
cording to the police.
Brumbaugh lives in Loro house in
Florence Moore Hall, the same hall
as Sutherland. Brumbaugh said he
had placed his backpack outside his
room and gone into a friend's room
to talk after returning from Green
Library just after midnight on the
morning of Dec. 3. When he
returned, the backpack had been
stolen.
Brumbaugh said the backpack
was later found in the bushes
outside the dorm with his wallet and
checkbook missing, but the loss
forced him to take an incomplete in
a biology class, the notes for which
were in the backpack. He said his
only financial loss will be charges
for replacing his driver's license
and possibly a $50 deduct
ible from Visa, but the incident was
"a major hassle during Dead Week
