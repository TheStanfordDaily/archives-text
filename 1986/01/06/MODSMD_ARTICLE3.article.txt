# Football Players Arrested for Theft
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
The University announced Tues
day that it is investigating three
varsity football players who were
arrested by the Palo Alto police last
month on various felony charges,
including forgery, burglary and re
ceiving or possessing stolen prop
erty.
Freshman Sam Sutherland, soph
omore Ken Richardson and junior
Wendell Brown were arrested Dec.
3 in the Emporium-Capwell store at
Stanford Shopping Center after at
tempting to use checks and credit
cards stolen from sophomore David
Sweeney to purchase $470 worth of
clothing, according to police.
Sweeney is the starting kicker for
the football team.
Andrew Parnes, an attorney with
Nolan and Parnes, said all three are
planning to plead innocent in Palo
Alto Municipal Court Jan. 14, ac
cording to University News Ser
vice.
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole
said the three are being inves
tigated for violating the Fundamen
tal Standard. If found guilty by the
University, she said, the penalties
could range from censure to expul
sion. She said there have been
other instances of students stealing

from other students, but none that
could be regarded as a precedent.
None of the three charged could
be reached for comment last night.
Sweeney declined to comment until
the incident is resolved.
Police records also show that the
three used a Visa card stolen from
junior Dan Brumbaugh to charge
$1,700 of merchandise. Sutherland
also cashed checks stolen from
Brumbaugh for another $800, ac
cording to the police.
Brumbaugh lives in Loro house in
Florence Moore Hall, the same hall
as Sutherland. Brumbaugh said he
had placed his backpack outside his
room and gone into a friend's room
to talk after returning from Green
Library just after midnight on the
morning of Dec. 3. When he
returned, the backpack had been
stolen.
Brumbaugh said the backpack
was later found in the bushes
outside the dorm with his wallet and
checkbook missing, but the loss
forced him to take an incomplete in
a biology class, the notes for which
were in the backpack. He said his
only financial loss will be charges
for replacing his driver's license
and possibly a $50 deduct
ible from Visa, but the incident was
"a major hassle during Dead Week
and finals week."
Brumbaugh said he learned more
details about the incident from Cole
over break. He said that few people
in Loro last night had heard that
Sutherland was charged in the inci
dent.
"I was shocked," Brumbaugh
said. "I knew him probably as well
as anyone in the dorm knew him.
He was never around that much be
cause of football. I considered him a
casual friend. I always thought he
was a nice guy."
Sutherland was charged with one
count each of burglary and forgery.
Richardson was charged with one
count each of burglary, forgery, al

tering a driver's license and receiv
ing or possessing stolen property.
Brown was charged with one count
each of forgery, altering a driver's
license and receiving or possessing
stolen property.
Sutherland moved into the start
ing strong safety spot for the Card
inal football team midway through
this past season. Richardson and
Brown were reserve wide
receivers.
Football Coach Jack Elway, in a
statement released Tuesday by the
University, said, "I've had private
conversations with all three stu
dents and several of their parents. I
plan to meet with the students per
sonally when they return and will
discuss the charges and their status
on the football team at that time.
There is no indication that any

other players are involved."
Elway declined further comment.
Director of Athletics Andy
Geiger said, "We're just going to
wait and see what happens with all
the processes involved." He said
this was the first such incident in his
seven years at Stanford.
According to the statement
released by the University, results
of its investigation are not expected
for several weeks. The students
charged are expected to remain in
school pending the outcome of the
investigation.
At the time of the arrests last
month, Brown was also wanted on
a bench warrant issued by a Palo
Alto Municipal Court judge July 11
after Brown failed to appear on a
charge of petty theft, a mis
demeanor.
