Nicaragua Denies Role in Attack
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Nicaragua's Sandinista government
yesterday rejected Colombian charges that it supplied weapons used
by leftist guerrillas in a November assault on the Palace of Justice in
Bogota that killed 95 people.
"We reiterate in the clearest and most categorical way that
Nicaragua has not, absolutely, interfered in the internal affairs of
Colombia and much less in the tragic eventsrof the Palace of Justice,"
Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto said in a letter to Augusto Ramirez
Ocampo, Colombia's foreign minister.
"We are respectful of international rights," said the letter, pub
lished in the official daily Barricada and the pro-government newspa
per El Nuevo Diario. The letter was dated Friday.
The Colombian government Saturday released a letter to
D'Escoto demanding a "prompt and satisfactory explanation" of how
rifles belonging to the leftist Sandinista regime wound up in the hands
of rebels who assaulted the Palace of Justice in downtown Bogota,
Colombia's capital. That letter was dated Thursday.
The guerrillas of the April 19 Movement, or M-19, seized the
palace Nov. 6. Among those killed were 11 Supreme Court justices.
Soldiers stormed the building to end the 28-hour occupation.
South Africa Vows To Retaliate
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — South Africa's white-led gov
ernment said yesterday that it would retaliate against black guerrillas
for the weekend land mine explosion which killed two whites.
In the Zulu tribal homeland in Natal province, police said six blacks
died in fighting between two prominent families, the Sitholes and
Mbathas. It was not known what started the fight near Okhukho, a
mountain village about 130 miles north of Durban, said police Major
S. Dube.
Police also reported that one person was killed Saturday and an
other yesterday in rioting against apartheid, the nation's system of
racial segregation under which 5 million whites rule 24 million blacks.
"After deliberation, the government will act in order to fight this
evil," Defense Minister Magnus Malan said of the land mine explosion
Saturday near the Stockpoort border crossing with Botswana.
Far-right conservatives called for "immediate military" action.
The "clumsy" government "can simply no longer secure the safety
of the people of South Africa," said a statement from the Conserva
tive Party, which broke from the governing National Party almost
four years ago.
No one claimed responsibility for the explosion, which killed a man
and his daughter-in-law and wounded two other whites on a truck
viewing game on a bush trail. The outlawed African National
Congress, the main guerrilla group fighting apartheid, has said in the
past that it planted other land mines.
About 1,000 people have been killed in anti-apartheid violence in
the last 16 months, mostly blacks killed by police and troops. Most of
the other victims were blacks killed by other blacks who regarded
them as collaborators.
Arab Ministers To Discuss Libya
FEZ, Morocco — The declaration of solidarity for Libya by the
Arab League has prompted the Islamic Conference Organization to
place the topic of mounting tension between Libya and the United
States on the agenda for its foreign ministers conference due to
begin here today.
This became clear in the ancient Moroccan royal city yesterday,
where the foreign ministers and their representatives assembled for
the six-day meeting.
A nominal 45 countries belong to the Islamic Conference Organi
zation, founded in 1972. Members include the Palestine Liberation
Organization, and there is speculation here that its leader, Yasser
Arafat, may attend.
Other major topics to be discussed at the conference include the
Iran-Iraq war, the Arab-Israeli conflict, Afghanistan and aid
measures for the starving in the Sahel region of Africa.
On Saturday, the Arab League, meeting in Tunis, Tunisia, con
demned the recent terrorist attacks at airports in Rome and Vienna
and warned of U.S. and Israeli threats against Libya.
Marcos Sees Aquino-Rebel Link
TAYTAY, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos said yester
day that armed communist rebels were campaigning for his rival,
Corazon Aquino, and threatening to wipe out rural villages if resi
dents voted for him Feb. 7.
Marcos did not identify his sources or say where the rebels' pur
ported voter harassment was taking place.
In a campaign speech to a fishing community on the shores of
Laguna de Bay Lake just outside Manila, Marcos repeatedly charged
that "our opponents helped organize the communists and enjoy the
support of the New People's Army," who were allegedly threatening
voters in unspecified villages.
"They say in the villages, *We will be watching you and if we see
that you have voted for Marcos (in the Feb. 7 special presidential
election), we will kill you all,' " said Marcos, speaking in Tagalog.
There was no immediate comment available from Aquino.
However, on Saturday, while campaigning on Leyte Island 300 miles
southeast of Manila, she denied Marcos' accusations that she has
been seeking communist support.
Rumbling Volcano Prompts Alert
BOGOTA, Colombia — Nevado del Ruiz volcano trembled again
yesterday and blocks of ice drifted down rivers encircling the Ar
mero Valley, prompting the government to keep a state of
"maximum alert" for fear of another disaster.
Thousands of people, mostly farmers, spent the night on higher
ground, huddled in mountain caves as torrential rains poured down
the valley's slopes.
The government ordered settlers to evacuate Saturday after the
snow-capped volcano rained sulfuric ash at dawn for the first time
since a devastating Nov. 13 eruption buried the town of Armero un
der mud and destroyed 13 villages.
That eruption melted part of the volcano's cone of ice and snow,
sending a 150-foot-high wall of mud down the Lagunilla River. Mud
and debris destroyed Armero, once a prosperous coffee-growing
town about 105 miles northwest of the capital of Bogota in the state
of Tolima.
About 23,000 of Armero's 28,000 residents were killed or mis
sing, and 2,000 people died in Chinchina, 22 miles west of the
17,700-foot-high Andean volcano.

Marcos Sees Aquino-Rebel Link
TAYTAY, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos said yester
day that armed communist rebels were campaigning for his rival,
Corazon Aquino, and threatening to wipe out rural villages if resi
dents voted for him Feb. 7.
Marcos did not identify his sources or say where the rebels' pur
ported voter harassment was taking place.
In a campaign speech to a fishing community on the shores of
Laguna de Bay Lake just outside Manila, Marcos repeatedly charged
that "our opponents helped organize the communists and enjoy the
support of the New People's Army," who were allegedly threatening
voters in unspecified villages.
"They say in the villages, *We will be watching you and if we see
that you have voted for Marcos (in the Feb. 7 special presidential
election), we will kill you all,' " said Marcos, speaking in Tagalog.
There was no immediate comment available from Aquino.
However, on Saturday, while campaigning on Leyte Island 300 miles
southeast of Manila, she denied Marcos' accusations that she has
been seeking communist support.
Rumbling Volcano Prompts Alert
BOGOTA, Colombia — Nevado del Ruiz volcano trembled again
yesterday and blocks of ice drifted down rivers encircling the Ar
mero Valley, prompting the government to keep a state of
"maximum alert" for fear of another disaster.
Thousands of people, mostly farmers, spent the night on higher
ground, huddled in mountain caves as torrential rains poured down
the valley's slopes.
The government ordered settlers to evacuate Saturday after the
snow-capped volcano rained sulfuric ash at dawn for the first time
since a devastating Nov. 13 eruption buried the town of Armero un
der mud and destroyed 13 villages.
That eruption melted part of the volcano's cone of ice and snow,
sending a 150-foot-high wall of mud down the Lagunilla River. Mud
and debris destroyed Armero, once a prosperous coffee-growing
town about 105 miles northwest of the capital of Bogota in the state
of Tolima.
About 23,000 of Armero's 28,000 residents were killed or mis
sing, and 2,000 people died in Chinchina, 22 miles west of the
17,700-foot-high Andean volcano.
Nicaragua Denies Role in Attack
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Nicaragua's Sandinista government
yesterday rejected Colombian charges that it supplied weapons used
by leftist guerrillas in a November assault on the Palace of Justice in
Bogota that killed 95 people.
"We reiterate in the clearest and most categorical way that
Nicaragua has not, absolutely, interfered in the internal affairs of
Colombia and much less in the tragic eventsrof the Palace of Justice,"
Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto said in a letter to Augusto Ramirez
Ocampo, Colombia's foreign minister.
"We are respectful of international rights," said the letter, pub
lished in the official daily Barricada and the pro-government newspa
per El Nuevo Diario. The letter was dated Friday.
The Colombian government Saturday released a letter to
D'Escoto demanding a "prompt and satisfactory explanation" of how
rifles belonging to the leftist Sandinista regime wound up in the hands
of rebels who assaulted the Palace of Justice in downtown Bogota,
Colombia's capital. That letter was dated Thursday.
The guerrillas of the April 19 Movement, or M-19, seized the
palace Nov. 6. Among those killed were 11 Supreme Court justices.
Soldiers stormed the building to end the 28-hour occupation.
South Africa Vows To Retaliate
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — South Africa's white-led gov
ernment said yesterday that it would retaliate against black guerrillas
for the weekend land mine explosion which killed two whites.
In the Zulu tribal homeland in Natal province, police said six blacks
died in fighting between two prominent families, the Sitholes and
Mbathas. It was not known what started the fight near Okhukho, a
mountain village about 130 miles north of Durban, said police Major
S. Dube.
Police also reported that one person was killed Saturday and an
other yesterday in rioting against apartheid, the nation's system of
racial segregation under which 5 million whites rule 24 million blacks.
"After deliberation, the government will act in order to fight this
evil," Defense Minister Magnus Malan said of the land mine explosion
Saturday near the Stockpoort border crossing with Botswana.
Far-right conservatives called for "immediate military" action.
The "clumsy" government "can simply no longer secure the safety
of the people of South Africa," said a statement from the Conserva
tive Party, which broke from the governing National Party almost
four years ago.
No one claimed responsibility for the explosion, which killed a man
and his daughter-in-law and wounded two other whites on a truck
viewing game on a bush trail. The outlawed African National
Congress, the main guerrilla group fighting apartheid, has said in the
past that it planted other land mines.
About 1,000 people have been killed in anti-apartheid violence in
the last 16 months, mostly blacks killed by police and troops. Most of
the other victims were blacks killed by other blacks who regarded
them as collaborators.
