# UPDATE
## Khadafy Denies Having Trained Terrorists 
### 
WASHINGTON — Libyan leader Moammar
Khadafy denied yesterday there are Palestinian
terrorist training camps in his country and said
that he did not believe the bloody Palestinian at
tacks that killed 19 people at airports in Rome
and Vienna were "legal."
Khadafy, who earlier had called the airport as
saults justified, said that "for me, it is not legal.
But for them (the terrorists), they may be so."
Another Khadafy remark, that contacts with
an unnamed U.S. envoy had helped defuse the
possibility of a military confrontation with the
United States over the attacks, was denied
quickly by the Reagan Administration.
A senior Administration official said, "We're
not aware of any American ambassador contact
ing him. No such contacts have been author
ized." The official also said he was unaware of
any effort by Khadafy to approach U.S. officials.
"He knows what he can do to defuse the situa
tion," the official added.
Khadafy's tone in an interview on NBC News'
"Meet the Press" contrasted with the tougher
line he had taken after the Dec. 27 airport at
tacks, and it coincided with a similar softer ap
proach by Libya's foreign affairs secretary, who
on Saturday condemned the terrorist actions and
disclaimed any Libyan role in them.
Sens. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) and Patrick

Leahy (D-Vt.) and former White House national
security adviser Robert McFarlane said in
televised interviews Sunday that they doubted
the United States would take military action
against Libya in retaliation for the airport as
saults.
Although the Administration has refused to
comment on the possibility of U.S. reprisals,
some naval forces have been deployed to the
Mediterranean Sea and others have been alerted
to stand by in case they are needed to help the
United States in dealing with Khadafy's govern
ment.
Lugar, chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, said on "Meet the Press" that he
believed the Administration had not established a
connection between Libya and the attacks.
Leahy, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said on the same program that he
doubted the U.S. would retaliate because "the
Administration seems to be so torn apart at
what's going to happen here."
But they and McFarlane, appearing on ABC
News' "This Week with David Brinkley," said
they believe Khadafy's regime has close ties to
terrorist elements of the Palestine Liberation
Organization. Leahy, vice chairman of the Sen
ate Intelligence Committee, said he did not ac
cept Khadafy's assertion that the PLO has no

training camps in Libya.
And McFarlane, who left the Administration
last month, said, "I don't believe that. I believe
there are indeed training camps in Libya." He
also said he believed Khadafy was behind the
December airport attacks, although he said, "I
don't have any evidence."
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, also ap
pearing on the Brinkley show, accused Libya of
helping the terrorist group led by Abu Nidal that
has been blamed for the airport attacks.
"I think it was really carried out by Abu
Nidal," Peres said. "I think it was supported by
the Libyans. I think the Libyans are providing
with money, support, training, and even
diplomatic mail. Today, Libya is a center of kil
ling, of interferences, of violence without any in
ternational norm."
Khadafy said that if the Palestinians "demand"
training sites in his country, "This I will give
them because they are freedom fighters, but
they have no need to establish camps in Libya,
which is far from their field of battle in
Palestine. ... We support the freedom fighters
. . . particularly our brothers, the Palestinians,
and we are not responsible for their attacks."
He also said that Nidal, who heads a faction of
the PLO, does not live in Libya although "he
comes to visit us." He said his last visit with
Nidal was "less than" a year ago.
