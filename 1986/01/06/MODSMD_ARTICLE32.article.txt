# Legislators Foresee Heavy Defense Cuts
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Gramm-
Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing
law will dramatically reverse Presi
dent Reagan's military buildup and
lead to "the greatest defense cut
back in peacetime history," military
and budget committee leaders in
Congress have concluded.
In separate analyses, Senate Re
publican and House Democratic
leaders predict that the landmark
budget law will force cuts of $65 bil
lion to $90 billion in defense
spending authority in fiscal 1987,
after an estimated cut of $10 billion
to $13 billion for the current fiscal
year.
Instead of growing at a rate of 3
percent after inflation, as planned
last vear in a White House

congressional compromise, new
spending authority for defense
would decline from its current level
of almost $300 billion to about $260
billion, or perhaps less, the legisla
tors said.
In a study released yesterday,
House Armed Services Committee
Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) said a
cut of $65 billion from inflation
adjusted current programs would
be required for fiscal 1987, result
ing in a 20 percent shortfall from
Reagan's defense-spending target.
"This isn't just tinkering at the
edges of the defense budget. It
means we are reversing the
defense buildup of the last few
vears. We are marching down the

mountain we have been marching
up," Aspin said.
Senate Budget Committee Chair
man Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) in an
interview last week, predicted even
deeper cuts in defense spending au
thority — about $90 billion.
"It is not liveable, but it is likely,"
he said.
The disparity in the projections
by Aspin and Domenici arises
largely from different assumptions
about what size cut in long-term
spending authority will be required
to achieve specific spending reduc
tions for a particular year.
But the message was the same
from both: a decline for defense at
the end of the 1980s that is as

precipitous as the increase at the
start of the decade, when Reagan
came into office vowing to improve
the nation's defenses.
The budget-balancing legislation,
named for its chief sponsors, Sens.
Phil Gramm (R-Texas), Warren
Rudman (R-N.H.), and Ernest Hol
lings (D-S.C.), sets mandatory tar
gets for spending reductions that
would cut deficits by roughly equal
installments from $200 billion to
zero by fiscal 1991.
If Congress does not achieve the
goals, the president would be re
quired to cut spending under a for
mula established in the law that
splits the cuts equally between
defense and domestic outlays.
