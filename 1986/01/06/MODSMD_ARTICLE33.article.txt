Shuttle Launch Today
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — The Space
Shuttle Columbia, which made the maiden
shuttle flight in 1981, is scheduled to roar back
into service today after a two-year layoff, car
rying with it a payload that includes a commu
nications satellite, a blood experiment and a
congressman.
Liftoff was set for 7:05 a.m. EST. An Air
Force weather expert predicted that the rain
squalls which socked Florida's Eastern coast
yesterday should clear and not affect the
launch.
Rep. William Nelson (D-Fla.), 43, chairman
of the House subcommitee on space science
that oversees federal space spending, was set
to become the second sitting lawmaker to ride
the shuttle. The first, Sen. Jake Gam (R-Utah)
who heads a similar panel in the Senate, flew
last April. The seven-man crew also includes
the first Latino American to fly in space,
Franklin Chang-Diaz, a 35-year-old Costa
Rican-born physicist who joined the astronaut
program in 1980.
The five-day mission was rescheduled after
a faulty computer part erroneously signaled a
malfunction in a turbine Dec. 19 and stopped

the countdown only 14 seconds before the
shuttle's huge booster rockets would have
ignited.
Poll Praises President
NEW YORK — A record number of women
and blacks say they support President Reagan,
according to a poll released yesterday which
found 68 percent of the American people now
approve of Reagan's job performance.
Twenty-four percent disapproved, and the
rest had no opinion, according to the New
York Times poll.
The overall approval figure is slightly higher
than in any previous poll conducted by the
Times or by the Times and CBS News, the
newspaper reported. Sixty-seven percent of
Americans approved of the president's perfor
mance in April 1981, just after an attempt on
Reagan's life. In January, July and November
1985, 65 percent approved.
The poll found that 67 percent of women and
56 percent of blacks approved of how Reagan
was handling his job.
The rise in black support was sharp. The
similar poll in November measured black ap

proval at 38 percent, which was then the high
est level of support for Reagan ever measured
among blacks. Black approval, which early in
Reagan's first term sometimes fell below 10
percent, increased steadily in 1985, the Times
said.
For women, approval increased from 60
percent in the November poll, which was
taken shortly before the Geneva summit
meeting between Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev.
Isherwood Dies
Author and dramatist Christopher Isher
wood, who chronicled his own life with unspar
ing detachment and whose tales of expatriates
scrabbling amid the artistic and political chaos
of 1930s Berlin were later the basis for the
musical film "Cabaret," died Saturday at his
Santa Monica home. He was 81.
A British expatriate who became a
naturalized U.S. citizen after settling in Cali
fornia during World War 11, Isherwood was
among a close circle of Cambridge-educated
writers and critics that included the poets
W.H. Auden and Stephen Spender.
