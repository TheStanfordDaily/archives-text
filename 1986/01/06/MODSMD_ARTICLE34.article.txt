Teachers To Strike
OAKLAND — After nearly 10 months of
unproductive contract talks, Oakland public
school teachers voted yesterday to strike the
51,000-pupil district today.
School officials said schools would be open
as usual. They held an emergency meeting late
yesterday to discuss the situation. Details
were not immediately available on their plans
for keeping schools open.
The strike vote came after a four-hour ses
sion at the Oakland Convention Center. Union
officials said the vote was nearly 2-1 in favor of
a strike. Details of the tally were not immedi
ately available.
Last week, the district offered a 1 percent
salary increase this year in response to the
union's demand for a 14 percent pay hike this
year followed by a 16 percent increase next
year.
Oakland teachers are paid annual salaries of
$16,400 to $29,981.

Bradley Alters Stance
LOS ANGELES — Los Angeles mayor
Tom Bradley, reversing a position he contends
helped cripple his gubernatorial bid four years
ago, said yesterday he will oppose state gun
control laws.
But the head of the nation's second-largest
city stopped short of saying he is personally
against laws such as Prop. 15, the handgun
control initiative that was defeated in the No
vember 1982 election.
"People have spoken on that issue, and I'll
tell you now that if it is on the ballot again I'll be
the first one to oppose it," Bradley said in an
interview on KNBC-TV's "News Confer
ence."
Bradley in 1982 supported Prop. 15, which
would have banned most new handgun sales,
required registration of all existing handguns
with the attorney general and set mandatory
jail sentences for carrying or selling an un
registered handgun.

Bradley's Republican opponent in the 1982
election, George Deukmejian, opposed the
gun control initiative, arguing the proposition
would fail to alleviate crime and would require
a massive bureaucracy to enforce.
Crews Battle LA Spill
LOS ANGELES — Cleanup crews using
huge vacuum pumps said it would take another
24 hours to suck up 12,000 gallons of crude oil
dumped into Los Angeles Harbor, the Coast
Guard said yesterday.
A faulty drain valve was blamed for Satur
day's spill at the Mobil Oil Co. dock, MacPher
son said.
Ten thousand feet of floating booms were
erected in the harbor Saturday to absorb the
oil and contain the spill that had coated the
water with a black film from two miles south
and threated Cabrillo Beach marina to the
west.
