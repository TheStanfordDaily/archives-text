## 
### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
Three of 31 Stanford applicants have been
named Rhodes scholars for 1986, it was an
nounced in December.
They are:
• William Handley of Westport, Conn., a
double major in political science and English;
• Michael McFaul of Bozeman, Mont., a co
terminal student in Russian and East
European studies and international relations;
• Susan Rice of Washington, D.C., a Truman

scholar planning a history honors thesis on
black migrant workers in the Bay Area during
World War 11.
All three have been involved in community
service, studied abroad and held summer in
ternships.
They were among 32 candidates
nationwide who were chosen from 1,238 ap
plicants for the scholarship, which provides
fees and living expenses for two years of
study at Oxford.
Handley, who intends to study 20th cen
tury English literature, said he wants to "get
the British perspective, understand British

criticism." He is writing a humanities honors
thesis on Virginia Woolf and said he is inves
tigating "the political implications of her art."
McFaul said he is planning to study interna
tional relations. Rice, who was in Canada and
unavailable for comment, also intends to
study international relations, according to the
University News Service.
Surprise and pleasure were the initial reac
tions for both Handley and McFaul when they
learned of their scholarships.
"I was pleased, excited and relieved," said
Handley. "Immediately when they announced
[the scholarship winners], I also felt kind of

awkward around the others who had lost."
"Surprised, that was my first reaction,"
McFaul said. "There were many very
qualified applicants, and I did not expect to be
chosen."
McFaul said he entered the competition at
the encouragement of a professor.
He studied at the Pushkin Institute in Mos
cow and at Leningrad State University in
1983. He has also worked as a volunteer
teacher at St. Anthony's school in Mpam,
Nigeria and has planned and taught a SWOPSI
course on "The United Nations in Crisis."
McFaul said he plans to obtain a doctorate and ex
plore a combination of government and academic work
on foreign policy.
A resident assistant at Florence Moore, Handley is a
tutor in Stanford's Structured Liberal Education pro
gram (SLE) and has worked on arms control as an in
tern with Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.). He also
studied in East Germany during 1984.
As an intern with the Black Student Fund in Wash
ington, D.C. in 1984, Rice wrote a guide for secondary
school teachers on "A History Deferred" and has
worked as a volunteer with the Mid-Peninsula Support
Network for Battered Women. She has been a tutor,
advising associate and peer advisor for the History De
partment and studied at the Stanford campus in Oxford
last year.
Ihe total number of Stanford recipients of the

Rhodes scholarships is now 56, including three stu
dents nominated elsewhere. Ten have been chosen in
the past four years.
Harvard had six Rhodes scholars this year, Prince
ton four and Notre Dame two.
Stanford had 31 Rhodes applicants this year, 13 of
whom received interviews at the state level. There
were 26 applicants last year. The high was set two
years ago, when 36 students applied, 19 won state in
terviews and three won scholarships.
The application process has a reputation for being
tough. The first step is the application itself, which in
cludes an essay and five to eight recommendations.
Students apply through the state of residence or
through the state of their school. Stanford has an op
tional pre-interview.
Some of the applicants are then chosen for an inter
view at the state level. Two from each state are then
picked for a second interview at the district level. Four
from each of the eight districts are awarded the schol
arship.
