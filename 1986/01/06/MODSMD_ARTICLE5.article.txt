The latest long-range financial forecast by
University administrators indicates substan
tial budget cuts will be needed to help close
multi-million dollar deficits in the next two
budget years, said Provost James Rosse at a
Dec. 5 meeting of the Faculty Senate.
Rosse said some of the additional funds to
pay the deficit may come from tuition in
creases, but said the University would main

gave projections that indicated tuition would
rise 7 percent next year.
According to Rosse, the "gap" between
University income and expenditures will be
$5.2 million in fiscal year 1986-87 and $6.5
million in the 1987-88 fiscal year.

Preliminary budget planning calls for
"relatively small cuts" the first year, followed
by "substantial" reductions the following
year, Rosse said. Most units of the Univer
sity will be asked to absorb 2.5 percent cuts
over the two-year period, with most of the
cuts taking effect in the second year, he said.
Nearly half of the deficit for 1986-87 will
have to be met by one-time "bridging funds"
which, according to Rosse, would come from
a conditional budget that serves to protect
against large or unanticipated increases in ex
penses.
Covering the gap will also require transfer
ing $700,000 from the conditional budget, as
well as an additional $700,000 of undecided
income increases or expenditure reductions.
Income increases could involve increasing
