# Faculty Predicts Cuts In University Budget
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
The latest long-range financial forecast by
University administrators indicates substan
tial budget cuts will be needed to help close
multi-million dollar deficits in the next two
budget years, said Provost James Rosse at a
Dec. 5 meeting of the Faculty Senate.
Rosse said some of the additional funds to
pay the deficit may come from tuition in
creases, but said the University would main
tain its need-blind admissions policy. He also
gave projections that indicated tuition would
rise 7 percent next year.
According to Rosse, the "gap" between
University income and expenditures will be
$5.2 million in fiscal year 1986-87 and $6.5
million in the 1987-88 fiscal year.

Preliminary budget planning calls for
"relatively small cuts" the first year, followed
by "substantial" reductions the following
year, Rosse said. Most units of the Univer
sity will be asked to absorb 2.5 percent cuts
over the two-year period, with most of the
cuts taking effect in the second year, he said.
Nearly half of the deficit for 1986-87 will
have to be met by one-time "bridging funds"
which, according to Rosse, would come from
a conditional budget that serves to protect
against large or unanticipated increases in ex
penses.
Covering the gap will also require transfer
ing $700,000 from the conditional budget, as
well as an additional $700,000 of undecided
income increases or expenditure reductions.
Income increases could involve increasing
tuition while continuing to meet
demonstrated financial need, ac
cording to Rosse. Alternatives for
reducing expenditures include re
ducing the rate of faculty salary in
creases and delaying the funding
and implementation of the new aca
demic and administrative computing
systems.
According to Rosse, the Univer
sity is forced to consider the $270.2
million operating budget for reduc
tions. Although the operating
budget is only 38 percent of the
University's $705 million con
solidated budget, Rosse said the
University has little control over
sponsored research, restricted
funds and the cost of auxilaries such
as food and dormitory services that
comprise much of the consolidated
budget.
The operating budget is also im
portant because of the concentra
tion of overhead services it
provides, Rosse said. The operat
ing budget includes almost all Uni

versity operations, maintenance
and administrative costs, as well as
44 percent of total instructional ex
penditures.
"The operating budget is the
base which makes possible all of the
activities that take place in the con
ditional budget," Rosse said. "The
operating budget then really has to
be the focus of our attention and is
indeed the part we worry about
most."
The long-range financial forecast
concentrates on the non-formula
portion of the operating budget,
Rosse said. Over $50 million of the
$270 million operating budget is
"formula" and not controlled by the
central University administration.
Included in the formula budget is
funding for the medical center,
business school and Hoover Institu
tion, Rosse said.
Inflation is a key assumption in
forecasting the University's long
range financial outlook, Rosse said.
A meeting of University economics
faculty concluded with predictions
of slight rises in inflation in the next
several years, Rosse said. The Uni
versity based its forecast on rates

of 4.5, 5.0 and 5.5 percent for the
next three fiscal years.
The inflation assumption greatly
affects the changes in the Univer
sity's net income and expenses,
particularly tuition, which accounts
for 50 percept of the total operating
budget income, according to Rosse.
Tuition is expected to rise by the
rate of inflation plus an additional
2.5 percent, and the increases are a
"fact of life," Rosse said.
"The fact is that we are a very
labor-intensive institution," Rosse
said. "The economics of the (labor)
markets are forcing our costs to
rise faster tham the general infla
tion levels."
Tuition for the next academic
year will not be formally set until
the February meeting of the Board
of Trustees, he said.
Despite the projected rise in tui-i
tion, the forecast allows for the
growth of financial aid to maintain
the University's need-blind
sions policy, according to RosseJ
Financial aid currently accounts for
8 percent, or $9 million, of the
operating budget, he said.
