# No Maples Registration
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Staff writer 
Instead of registering and signing class
lists in Maples Pavilion today, students will
simply be paying their University bills.
Those who have not yet paid for tuition
and fees must either do so or take out a
deferment loan today, according to Uni
versity Bursar Jon Erickson.
Students can settle their accounts at the
Oak Lounge on the second floor of Tresid
der Union, where there will be 20 cashier
windows, he said. "Twelve will handle the
deferments, and four will handle the cash
payments. Then there will be four for 'No
Bills' — the classic Well, I lost it'. . . the
clueless end," Erickson said.
Drop boxes will be available for students
who have their payments ready but have
not mailed them in. These "artistically

painted garbage cans" will also be at
Tresidder Union, Erickson said.
"We really don't know what to expect,"
he said of the situation students will con
front at Tresidder. "We're encouraging
everyone to get there early. If people
want to avoid lines, they shouldn't wait un
til the afternoon."
Many students have already paid their
bills. By Jan. 3, 4,065 students had paid or
arranged to pay their bills, according to
Erickson. "We had received cash and
checks totalling just over $6 million,"he
said.
"Five hundred students had used the
deferment loan program," he continued,
"to the tune of a little over $900,000." The
loan must be repaid by Feb. 20.
By the end of today, "over 5,000 people
will have paid . . . about $7.5 to 8
million," Erickson said. "The gen
eral response (to the new payment
procedure) has been really good."
Students who have not settled
their accounts by this evening will
be in jeopardy of having their
registration cancelled, Erickson
said.
The new accounting system is
part of the new register-by-mail
procedure that began in November,
when students were mailed
registration commitments. Stu
dents could register for winter

quarter, spring quarter, or both
with that document.
The response toward the
registration commitments was
"better than we had anticipated,"
said Asst. Registrar Robert
Thompson. Most students sent in
their commitments, according to
registration and information officer
Cecilia Corey.
"We got about 60 percent of the
students who registered for winter
quarter to also register for spring
quarter," Thompson said. "Next
year we hope people will commit
themselves for the entire year and
have nearly 100 percent."
On past registration days, a stu

dent activities fair greeted the stu
dents as they entered Maples
Pavilion. "There will be tables in
Tresidder. But a lot of people won't
even go on Jan. 6," Erickson said.
The familiar registration packs
may also receive less attention due
to the new system, although the in
formation will be available at Old
Union and Tresidder, according to
Corey.
Asked if the new registration
system costs more than the former
one, Thompson said, "We're trying
to make the postage equal to the
old costs of setting up in Maples.
We're hoping that in the long run
the new system will be no more ex
pensive than the old one."
