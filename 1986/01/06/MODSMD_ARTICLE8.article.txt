# Doing a Snowjob on Your Weekend
## FEATURES 
### SCOTT ROTH Staff writer 
A chill is in the air. The rains
have come. And the freshmen from
the Midwest are wondering why it's
not sunny. Winter has set in on the
Farm, and so has ski season.
Just a few hours' drive east of
campus, near Lake Tahoe, lies
some of the West's best skiing.
With a little bit of planning and some
cooperation from Mother Nature,
you can plan one of the most enjoy
able weekends imaginable.
How To Get There
The first thing that you'll need is
transportation. The most economi
cal way to get to Lake Tahoe is
driving. The Tahoe basin is served
by two major highways. Interstate
80 serves the North Shore of the
lake and most major ski areas. U.S.
50 goes to the South Shore and the
casinos.

If you or your friends don't have
a car, your best bet may be renting
one. Most rental agencies have
"skier-ized" cars with snow tires,
ski racks and good antifreeze
available. The price of these cars
varies with the company, the size
you rent and, of course, how many
people will be splitting the Cost.
Shop around. Some agencies, like
National, offer discounts to Stan
ford students.
Lake Tahoe is also accessible by
the air, but doing so is very expen
sive. Many airlines fly into Reno or
South Lake Tahoe. If time is impor
tant and money no object, this may
be your solution.
A typical ticket from San Fran
cisco to South Lake Tahoe will cost
approximately $70. Although you
will find yourself in Tahoe in less
than one hour, you will find yourself
there without any means of trans-


Permits like the one shown above are the ticket to great skiing
near Stanford, but may run upwards of $25 for a single day.
portation. The lifts are not within walking
distance of the ski cabins.
A second, more economical option,
might be the bus. Greyhound offers trans
portation from the San Francisco airport
terminal to the one in South Lake Tahoe for
$24. But again, you will find yourself
dropped in Lake Tahoe without further
transportation.
How To Ski There
If you don't have your own equipment,
rent it down here. Not only will you find a
better selection in the Palo Alto area, you
won't have to waste time once you get up
to the mountains. Prices for rentals vary
depending on the type of equipment you
rent. Local ski shops like Stanford Sport
Shop in Palo Alto, Shreve's in Menlo Park,
and B&D or Any Mountain in Redwood City
have good rental departments.
Where To Stay There
Finding shelter in Lake Tahoe can
sometimes be a problem. The basin is filled
with many hotels and motels, ranging from
the palatial to the disgusting. If you wish to
stay in a motel, your best bet is to check a
AAA travel guide book or go to a library and
find a Lake Tahoe phone book.
More often than not, finding a house at
which to stay makes the most sense. Huge
houses complete with color televisions,
stereos and hot tubs can hold a horde of ski
minded students and are generally much
hicer than motels. Though renting a house

can cost a pretty penny, if you have a large
group to split the cost, it's really quite
economical.
To find a house to rent, check the want
ads of the local papers or check a Lake
Tahoe phone book for realtors specializing
in vacation rentals.

Where To Ski There
The car is packed, and you're ready to hit
the road, but where are you going? That's
the least of your worries. The Lake Tahoe
area is home to more than 15 major ski
areas. Among the most popular are Squaw
Valley, home of the 1960 Olympics, Alpine
Meadows and Heavenly Valley.
Squaw and Alpine are the closest to
Tahoe City and offer the biggest variety of

terrain. Heavenly, the largest ski area in
the United States, is at South Lake Tahoe.
It's close to the major casinos, and it has
the most spectacular views of the lake
anywhere.
There are many other smaller areas.
Some of them are worth a special trip. Ski
shops often have brochures about these
areas. They provide lots of information and
directions.
Be advised that skiing at Tahoe is any
thing but cheap. Be prepared to fork out at
least $25 for a lift ticket. All major credit
cards are accepted.
After Skiing There
After punishing yourself for a whole day
on the slopes, why not punish yourself all
night? If you're up to it, there are a million
things to do at night.
If gourmet meals are your penchant, you
won't have any trouble satisfying your ap
petite. On the North Shore, try the Tahoe
House or the Swiss Lakewood Lodge. Both
of these places are guaranteed to lighten
your wallet and ruin your waistline.
If you like the bar-dancing scene, there
are also many places to drop in. Stop in at
Jake's on the Lake (known to the locals as
Fakes on the Make). Most restaurants have
bars or lounges, so finding a place to party
is no problem.
Gambling is not far away either. Reno
and all the big stars are only a 30-mile drive
from Tahoe City. There are some smaller
casinos on the North Shore, too. If you are
at South Shore, you need only drive down
the street.
