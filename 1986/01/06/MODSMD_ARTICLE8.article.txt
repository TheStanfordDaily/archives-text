# Doing a Snowjob on Your Weekend
## FEATURES 
### SCOTT ROTH Staff writer 
A chill is in the air. The rains
have come. And the freshmen from
the Midwest are wondering why it's
not sunny. Winter has set in on the
Farm, and so has ski season.
Just a few hours' drive east of
campus, near Lake Tahoe, lies
some of the West's best skiing.
With a little bit of planning and some
cooperation from Mother Nature,
you can plan one of the most enjoy
able weekends imaginable.
How To Get There
The first thing that you'll need is
transportation. The most economi
cal way to get to Lake Tahoe is
driving. The Tahoe basin is served
by two major highways. Interstate
80 serves the North Shore of the
lake and most major ski areas. U.S.
50 goes to the South Shore and the
casinos.

If you or your friends don't have
a car, your best bet may be renting
one. Most rental agencies have
"skier-ized" cars with snow tires,
ski racks and good antifreeze
available. The price of these cars
varies with the company, the size
you rent and, of course, how many
people will be splitting the Cost.
Shop around. Some agencies, like
National, offer discounts to Stan
ford students.
Lake Tahoe is also accessible by
the air, but doing so is very expen
sive. Many airlines fly into Reno or
South Lake Tahoe. If time is impor
tant and money no object, this may
be your solution.
A typical ticket from San Fran
cisco to South Lake Tahoe will cost
approximately $70. Although you
will find yourself in Tahoe in less
than one hour, you will find yourself
there without any means of trans-


Permits like the one shown above are the ticket to great skiing
near Stanford, but may run upwards of $25 for a single day.
