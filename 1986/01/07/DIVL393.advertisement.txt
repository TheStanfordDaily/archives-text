picture (MP) film now adapted for still use in 35mm cameras by
Seattle Film Works. Its micro-fine grain and rich color saturation

exposure latitude, you don't have to be a pro to get great everyday
shots or capture special effects. Shoot in low light or bright light
from 200 ASA up to 1200 ASA (with our high speed 5294® film).
And get prints or slides, or both, from the same roll. Enjoy the very
latest in photographic technology... plus quick, convenient mail
order service at substantial savings. Why not see what this quality
film can do for your photography. Send in today!
