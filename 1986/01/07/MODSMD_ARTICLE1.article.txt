# Franklin Dismissal Upheld
## 
### DAVID RISSER Editorial staff With wire reports 
The California Supreme Court
yesterday upheld the University's
1972 firing of Assoc. Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin for his involvement
in campus protests against the Viet
nam War.
The court voted unanimously to
deny a hearing on Franklin's appeal
of a lower-court ruling in Septem
ber that also upheld the firing.
Franklin, now a tenured English
professor at Rutgers University in
New Jersey, has not yet decided
whether he will appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court, according to Jean
Hum, a spokesperson for the
American Civil Liberties Union.
ACLU lawyers represent Franklin.
Stanford fired Franklin in 1972,
alleging that on Feb. 10, 1971, he
urged students to occupy a campus
building and disobey police.
At a Feb. 10 White Plaza rally
protesting the U.S. invasion of
Laos, Franklin urged students to
"shut down" the University Com
putation Center, where the Stan
ford Research Institute was testing
a plan for an amphibious invasion of
Indochina.
More than 100 demonstrators
marched to the center and forced
their way into the building. The
computer power system was cut,
causing $800 in damage, according
to the University. Franklin did not
enter the building, but urged stu
dents to defy police orders.
University charges against
Franklin led to the convening of a
Faculty Advisory Board to evaluate
Franklin's actions. After 33 days of
hearings, the committee recom
mended Franklin's dismissal in a 5-2
vote. The Board of Trustees and
then-President Richard Lyman
agreed.
Franklin first filed charges
against the University in 1972.
University officials expressed
pleasure with the most recent court
decision. "We are certainly
gratified," said David Heilbron, an
attorney who represented the Uni
versity. "The University's position
has been vindicated all along," he
told the University News Service.
John Schwartz, University vice
president and general counsel, said
the University has "always been
convinced that Professor Franklin
was afforded every element of con
stitutional protection."
Franklin continues to disagree,
however. He told The Daily in July
that he was dismissed despite the
fact no laws were broken.
"The University actually ad
mitted that no rules or regulations
had been broken. So, in effect, I
was dismissed for 'inciting' what
couldn't be prosecuted," he said.
