# 13 Student Protesters Sentenced
## To serve year's probation and 40 hours volunteer service 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Thirteen of 31 Stanford students arrested for pro
testing University investments in South Africa last
quarter were each sentenced Dec. 6 to one-year
probation after pleading no contest to misdemeanor
charges stemming from sit-ins at Old Union.
The students, who opted to plea bargain in ex
change for reduced charges, were also ordered by
Judge Stephen Manley of the Palo Alto Municipal
Court to perform 40 hours of community service.
The remaining defendants, most of whom were
charged with trespassing, unlawful assembly and
refusal to disperse, have opted for a jury trial to be
held later this month.
Sophomore Stacy Ley ton, who pleaded no con
test, said yesterday that Asst. District Attorney
John Schon had told the defendants that the Univer
sity had refused an offer to drop charges and handle
the matter internally.
"The judge and the D.A. were upset at Stanford
for not handling the matter themselves," Leyton
said.
Schon was at court yesterday and unavailable for
comment.
Mirhap] Schmitz, who also pleaded no contest,

said yesterday, "Stanford had decided to remain
neutral," although the offer to drop charges "had
our hopes up."
Schmitz, a co-terminal student in biology, ex
plained that he had decided to forgo a jury trial be
cause of the amount of time required. "It's time bet
ter spent," he said. "It's no fun being in court."
Both Schmitz and Leyton predicted the students
awaiting a jury trial would base a major portion of
their defense on the view that the Old Union sit-ins
occurred because the University left student
protesters without any other available course of ac
tion.
"Access to the administration was denied,"
Leyton said, citing as evidence the administration's
distribution of a booklet concerning divestment
from South Africa last October. She also expressed
displeasure with the University's handling of the al
leged beating of senior Robby Perkins the same
month.
Perkins, who joined statistics Prof. Charles Stein,
three of the members of the Council of Presidents
and others in opting for a jury trial, charged Santa
Clara County Sheriff s officers and Stanford police in
October with employing excessive force following
his arrest at an anti-apartheid protest.
Perkins was unavailable for comment last night.
