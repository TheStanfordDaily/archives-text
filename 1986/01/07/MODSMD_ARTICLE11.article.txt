The University's leadership in making students
more "public service-conscious" has garnered a lot
of respect, and rightly so. But while few would
dispute the value of working in the public sector,
service for the common good has its price. Students
looking for jobs and internships in government can
usually count on earning next to nothing. And volun
teer work is just that â€” volunteer.
To meet the challenge, Stanford has consolidated
a network of internship and volunteer programs into
an exciting Public Service Center, while pressing for
expanded internship and volunteer opportunities in
California and beyond. These initiatives have neces
sarily focused on securing the financial support ne
cessary to finance public service work.
But to maintain its growing commitment to the
public sector, Stanford must continue to explore
new and different approaches to financing public ser
vice. Alumni must be tapped, but they can only give
so much. Educational programs funded by the
federal government are currently among the most
prominent targets for Capitol Hill budget cutting.
The private sector is one source of funding that
has yet to be tapped to the full extent possible. In
particular, scores of graduates from a handful of pro
fessional schools are hired by some of America's
most prominent corporations every year.
As a case in point, legal and investment firms on
New York's Wall Street typically focus on graduates
from Stanford and Ivy League professional schools
when recruiting new employees. It is not uncom
mon for attorneys from law schools like Stanford to
start at upwards of $40,000 or 45,000 a year at top
law firms; the work these new attorneys generate
for the firm may exceed $250,000 or $300,000 an
nually.
A consortium of the top-ranked colleges and uni
versities responsible for training the rising genera
tion of attorneys and business leaders should, con
sider a new initiative to solicit contributions from
America's top business firms. These contributions

could be used to help finance public service opportu
nities, both at the undergraduate and graduate level.
A consortium might begin by a meeting of college
and university presidents, with the intent to appoint
a small staff and soliciting contributions for a public
service fund. Every time a firm hired a graduate
from one of the member schools, the firm would be
asked to contribute to a public service fund main
tained by that graduate's professional school.
For example, a San Francisco investment firm
that hired a graduate of Stanford Business School
would be required to contribute money in that
graduate's name to a public service fund at Stanford.
The funds could be awarded to current Stanford un
dergraduates and graduates who could not other
wise afford to work in internship and volunteer pro
grams.
With such a fund-raising initiative in place, firms
would in effect "compete" in their contributions to
colleges and universities, and graduates would have
a chance to do their own part for public service by
donating money to their professional school.
Publicity of this arrangement would benefit both
beneficiary and recipient.
Stanford has done its students and the community
a great service by seeking employment and educa
tional opportunities in the public sector. But oppor
tunities alone are not enough. The University must
see to it that public service is an affordable option
for all.
Stanford students have sometimes been accused
of being "too career-oriented" because they do not
donate enough time to public service. But Stanford
is an expensive place, and all too often students are
compelled to forgo the public sector simply because
they must secure higher-paying jobs elsewhere.
The stage is set for Stanford to take a leading role
in public service consortia. University President
Donald Kennedy has made the public sector a high
priority. His administration might just be the one to
make a consortium a reality.
