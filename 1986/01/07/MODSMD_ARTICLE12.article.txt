Report Unsafe'
Bus Drivers
I would like to respond to a
recent letter (The Daily, Nov. 26,
1985) regarding the safety of Mar
guerite drivers. Any inappropriate
behavior, including poor driving,
should be reported to my office at
105 Encina Hall. The contract
between Stanford and the Mar
guerite vendor provides for the
removal of drivers who do not
drive safely. All you need to do is
note the bus number or license
number if you are outside the bus,
or the driver's name if you are a
passenger, and the date, time and
location.
The Marguerite buses try to
stay on schedule in the face of
varying passenger loads, construc
tion detours and traffic congestion.
However, unsafe driving will not
be tolerated under any circum
stances.
Reporting an incident will allow
us to take whatever action is ap
propriate. Glib speculations on the

"basic psychological insecurities"
of the drivers will not. I urge all
members of the Stanford commu
nity to report any inappropriate or
unsafe behavior, by any of the
Marguerite drivers, directly to me.

Invite Botha,
Not Gorbachev
I should like to express my
amazement at the suggestion that
Stanford should invite Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev to be a
commencement speaker. Gorba
chev does not lack facilities, either
in his own country or abroad, for
spreading propaganda and disin
formation. There is no reason why
Stanford should assist him in his
endeavor. Gorbachev, moreover,
is no "white knight." He willingly
joined the Communist Party of the
Soviet Union at a time when Stalin
still held sway and Stalin's terror
was at its height.

If Stanford wants to invite a
truly unpopular speaker, I suggest
South African President P.W.
Botha. Botha has at any rate
managed to steer his party into
making some reforms — however
inadequate. Gorbachev's reform
proposals as yet remain on paper.
As regards wider issues, South
Africa — for all its many
deficiencies — does not rival the
Soviet Union in regard to the num
ber of people jailed, tortured and
killed. South Africa — unlike the
Soviet Union — has independent
trade unions, legal strikes, inde
pendent churches, independent
universities and an opposition
press. South Africa neither per
secutes on the basis of religion nor
places barriers on emigration.
South Africa does not regard its
own social system as a model for
the world at large. Above all,
South Africa does not pose a mor
tal military threat both to this
country and its allies.
