## Stop U.S. Meddling in Angola 
### 
Because of a government-imposed news
blackout in South Africa, we no longer see on
television the clubbing and killing of black mourn
ers who dare to attend a funeral, or the mass ar
rest of school children or the demolition of black
settlements by government bulldozers. Al
though we no longer can witness their suffering,
enough Americans are outraged by the plight of
black South Africans to make open support of the
apartheid regime politically unacceptable.

VIEWPOINT

Nevertheless, the ultra-right in this country is
not about to abandon its natural allies. The
Reagan Administration now plans to make the
United States an active partner in South Africa's
effort to bolster its own economy and bring a
neighboring African country to its knees.
Spurred on by a well-financed right-wing lobby,
President Reagan has endorsed $15 million in
cover aid to UNITA, a rebel group fighting to
overthrow the government of Angola. In addi
tion, Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.) and Rep. Claude
Pepper (D-Fl.) have called for $27 million in
"humanitarian aid" to the rebels.
UNITA guerrillas, augmented by white mer
cenaries, are armed and equipped by South
Africa. Reagan calls them "freedom fighters,"
but their function is to destabilize the Angolan
government by preying on civilian villagers,
destroying food supplies and transportation lines
and causing widespread starvation.

Angola's government, recognized as
legitimate by every major nation except the
United States and South Africa, is admittedly
Marxist, but it has adopted free market policies,
encouraged private agriculture and actively
sought better relations with the United States.
American businesses have invested hundreds of
millions of dollars in Angola since its indepen
dence from Portugal; U.S. trade with Angola
now totals $1 billion a year. The only destruction
of American property and lives in Angola has
been carried out by South Africa and UNITA.
Ironically, Cuban troops in Angola guard U.S.
oil company installations from attacks by South
Africans. Most of the Cubans were invited to An
gola in 1975, just after South Africa launched an
invasion that almost reached the capitol city of
Luanda. The Angolan government has pledged
that the Cubans will leave when South Africa
gives up its illegal occupation of neighboring
Namibia, which it uses as a base for devastating
raids against Angola. In early December, 4,000
South African troops invaded Angola to help
UNITA battle Angolan forces. Since U.S. aid to
UNITA will have to be funneled through
Namibia, South Africa and the United States will
essentially become military allies in a dirty little
war.
UNITA's efforts to overthrow the Angolan
government serve South Africa in two ways. An
independent Angola, free to develop its re
sources for the benefit of its own people, would
provide what white South Africans see as a dan

gerous example for Namibians and black South
Africans, and would serve as a strong ally in their
struggle for independence. Angola also pos
sesses rich oil deposits needed desperately by
South Africa's limping economy. A UNITA vic
tory in Angola would give South Africa free
access to these resources.
At present, Angola sells most of its oil through
a joint venture with the Gulf Oil Company that
enables Angola to keep 51 percent of the profits.
Gulf officials, not notably pro-communist, praise
the Angolan government's dependability and
have lobbied Congress against U.S. aid to
UNITA. As a consequence, the right-wing
American Republic Foundation is calling for a
boycott of Gulf products. But is far more likely
that U.S. backing for the guerrillas will only force
Angola into closer ties with the Soviet Union and
arouse resentment of the United States through
out black Africa.
Providing aid to UNITA will do nothing but
keep the people of Angola in a state of endless
war. Since a clear-cut victory for UNITA is
unlikely, the chances are that the United States
will eventually find itself in another quagmire, as
costly, as humiliating and as totally senseless as
our involvment in Vietnam. Ten years ago, wise
congressional leadership and strong public pres
sure were able to end U.S. meddling in Angola.
Those who oppose strengthening South Africa
and its apartheid system must make the same ef
fort once again.
