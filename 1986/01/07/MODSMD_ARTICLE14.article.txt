# Cut Coverage and Threats
## 
### 
Terrorists have struck again. Their targets this time
were the Rome and Vienna airports. On Dec. 27,
1985, 19 people died in the assaults believed to have
been carried out by the Palestinian group Abu Nidal.
And, as usual, the United States has done little more
than bluster. The only U.S. action was to move the
Sixth Fleet near Libya and drop hints of a possible
retaliatory attack in response to supposed Libyan back
ing of the airport massacres. This threat had the grand
effect of forcing the Libyan leader and international bad
guy Colonel Moammar el-Khadafy to tone down his
lavish praise for the terrorists actions. More needs to
be done.

There have been many methods proposed to coun
teract terrorism. Many of the suggested options, espe
cially those which include the use of military force, are
risky and potentially explosive. One relatively low-cost
policy the United States can institute to take some of
the edge off terrorism is simply stop making so much
noise. Terrorists attempt to focus attention on their
cause and, therefore, thrive on publicity. If the amount
of attention thrown their way were reduced, a primary
reason for terrorists picking up the sword would be
removed.
The media, especially television, must put an end to
their overkill coverage of terrorist activities. A classic
example of media overindulgence was the highjacking
of a TWA plane to Beruit last summer. Hour after
hour, the networks provided a stage from which the
terrorists proclaimed their cause and denounced their
enemies. There is a difference between allowing the
glorification of the terrorist cause and covering an im
portant news story. While it is not permitable to
impose censorship on the media, they could show
much more restraint in their coverage.
The government must also do its part. While endless
and empty threats of U.S. military retaliation the Ad
ministration spews out might play well in the press and

on television, they serve little purpose but to focus
even more attention on the terrorists. Khadafy particu
larly thrives on the attention he receives from the U.S.
diatribes. Harvard Prof. Lisa Anderson comments that
"making a big issue of [Khadafy] since the beginning of
the Reagan Administration has played into his hands,
making him more important than he is. It has encour
aged him to try to affect policy through terrorism be
cause he gets so much attention for it."
Secretary of State George Shultz can pound his fist
in anger until his hand breaks, but what is needed is
cool, calculated and decisive action. For example, let's
say Libya was found to be behind some political assas
sination or embassy bombing. Retaliation is in order,
but, instead of all the blustering and talk, the United
States should neither comment on the terrorist inci
dent nor make threats. Then, the United States should
order a strike of a military target, avoiding highly con
centrated urban centers. Again, after the attack, talk
should be kept to a minimum. With no publicity and
feeling only the sting of defeat, the United States
would deprive the terrorist states of much of their
prestige and would provide them with a powerful in
centive to moderate their behavior.
A much more difficult menace is the Abu Nidal
group. Besides being exceptionally well-trained, the
Abu Nidal, unlike many of the terrorist groups operat
ing in the Middle East, has no political end to its ac
tions. Violence directed against Israel is its sole mis
sion. There are few retaliatory actions that will quell
such a movement. Even the establishment of a Pales
tinian homeland would not put an end to the Abu Nidal's
desire to "kill Israelis." Yet, the group still is attempt
ing to force attention to its grievances. A policy of
silence by the government and restraint by the media
would, therefore, weaken the Abu Nidal.
To counteract the Abu Nidal and other such groups,
the United States should establish a group of its own
which would assume the guise of the terrorists and em
ploy the tactics of the terrorists. Israel used such
methods with success in crushing the Black September
movement in the 19705. Secretly and without warning,
such an American-backed group would strike at the
terrorists, picking them off one by one. While the ter
rorists might not stop flouting international law, if the
Abu Nidal were forced to pay a high price for its ac
tions, the group would lose much of the attractiveness
it holds for young Palestinians.
