## Resurfacing the Potholes and Pans 
### ANDREW McCLUNG Staff writer 
Hello, friends. I'm glad to have
you all back after what I hope was a
restful and enjoyable break for all of
you. Now please quit reading this
and get to work.
If you have nicks in your DuPont
Silver Stone pot/pan, are car
cinogens leaching into every meal? -
First-Year Grad Student
Most certainly not, according to a
man at DuPont who insisted that I
conceal his name from the reading
public.
Silver Stone is a coating that is
really just an improved version of
Teflon. The polymer has been
worked over a little, to improve its
durability and non-stick properties,
but it is derived from the same fam
ily of resins as Teflon. Presumably,
therefore, it is every bit as safe to
cook with as ol' Teflon is.
Now, if you have nicked your
coating, or if some miscreant,
rapscallion, scalawag or ne'er-do
well made them for you, the only
risk you take in using the pan again
and again is eating little bits of the
Silver Stone coating or eating little
traces of the metal from which the
pan is formed.
The coating should be safe, as
mentioned, since Teflon-type
resins are very stable and inert, but
the quality of the pan itself is deter
mined by the pan's manufacturer.
See, DuPont sells only the
coatings and the rights to use their
names; it is up to the pan manufac
turers to use their purchases as
DuPont recommends. (Otherwise
DuPont will probably refute liability
for people who become ill from
cooking with pans made from, say,
arsenic). The pan maker usually
employs our friends: copper, alumi
num, cast iron or some more exotic
alloy to form the actual cooking ves
sel. None of the above metals

should affect you adversely in any
way, certainly not in the tiny
amounts you might receive from
cooking food on their still-mostly-
Silver-Stone-coated interior.
Copper pans are usually not
coated; they cook quite well with
out any coating. Furthermore, your
body needs trace amounts of cop
per, and the pans look prettier in
their natural state (assuming you
scrub away any corrosion with a
near-religious fervor). Many cast
iron pans are enamel-coated, but as
for those that are not, well, you
need iron to be healthy, too.
Thus it is for the most part alumi
num and its alloys that make up the
pans that are vehicles for DuPont
coatings. These metals, too, are
safe, and unless the manufacturer
throws some francium or plutonium
(detectable with the Geiger counter
that you of course keep about the
house) into the alloy to spice up
your life, your worries about car
cinogens should cease.
Otherwise you risk a stress
induced heart attack.
Why does Stern Hall look like a
bomb shelter? Are there any immedi
ate plans to improve the general ap
pearance of it (or, equally impor

tantly, the food served therein), or
are students doomed to reside in
Stalag 13 forever? - JP, BSME2B
Ed Scoles, the director of
Housing and Food Service, was
gracious enough to dispense
voluminous amounts of detailed in
formation concerning these impor
tant questions.
Consider first that Stern was
built about 35 years ago, when
bomb-shelter styling was all the
rage. Also, construction funds were
tight and an atmosphere of architec
tural austerity stultified the
campus.
Since then, the fact that Stern
sticks out like a healthy thumb amid
sore ones because it lacks a red-tile
roof has come to the attention of
administrators. But only if some
alumnus donated the millions of dol
lars necessary to buy all those tiles,
and insisted that they be bought and
installed, would the University do it.
They have other things on which
they'd rather spend their vast sums
of money.
One of those things is interior
renovation. Stern's lounges have
undergone quite a bit of that, ac
cording to Scoles, and Larkin has
been supplied with clusters of com

puters for student use.
This summer should see some
amelioration of the Stern exterior.
Big plans for improving- the
cafeteria and outdoor landscaping
are on the boards. Expect to find
the cafeteria bristling with new
equipment and a "fresher" appear
ance, as well as more space inside
to facilitate better traffic flow at
mealtimes.
But besides getting new shrub
bery on the outside, the residence
buildings themselves will not be ex
tensively overhauled. Such work is
simply too expensive given that the
buildings are still structurally
sound.
Recently, Serra Street between
Campus Drive and Galvez Street
was resurfaced. However, several
holes about six to eight inches in
diameter were left in the new asphalt.
Will these holes become the potholes
of the future? And if so, why weren't
they filled? - Lara Felker
If you talk to Michael McKnight,
the manager of General Plant Im
provements, you will find (as I did)
that those holes exist only tempo
rarily.
What are they? Typically they are
either sewer manholes, water
valves or surveying markers that
are uncovered when the old paving
is scraped away so that the resur
facing can be done. As the new
pavement is laid down, space is left
around the valves and holes so that
their elevation can be adusted to
make them flush with the new road
surface. Then more asphalt is
added in to fill any remaining gaps.
This "whole" (sorry) process
takes a few weeks, and that is why
the holes seem to be just left there.
If you look now, they are filled in
(save for the manhole covers and
valve plates).
So don't worry. Even Stanford
hasn't yet sunk to the level of
actively planning its potholes in ad
vance.

Why does Stern Hall look like a
bomb shelter? Are there any immedi
ate plans to improve the general ap
pearance of it (or, equally impor

tantly, the food served therein), or
are students doomed to reside in
Stalag 13 forever? - JP, BSME2B
Ed Scoles, the director of
Housing and Food Service, was
gracious enough to dispense
voluminous amounts of detailed in
formation concerning these impor
tant questions.
Consider first that Stern was
built about 35 years ago, when
bomb-shelter styling was all the
rage. Also, construction funds were
tight and an atmosphere of architec
tural austerity stultified the
campus.
Since then, the fact that Stern
sticks out like a healthy thumb amid
sore ones because it lacks a red-tile
roof has come to the attention of
administrators. But only if some
alumnus donated the millions of dol
lars necessary to buy all those tiles,
and insisted that they be bought and
installed, would the University do it.
They have other things on which
they'd rather spend their vast sums
of money.
One of those things is interior
renovation. Stern's lounges have
undergone quite a bit of that, ac
cording to Scoles, and Larkin has
been supplied with clusters of com

puters for student use.
This summer should see some
amelioration of the Stern exterior.
Big plans for improving- the
cafeteria and outdoor landscaping
are on the boards. Expect to find
the cafeteria bristling with new
equipment and a "fresher" appear
ance, as well as more space inside
to facilitate better traffic flow at
mealtimes.
But besides getting new shrub
bery on the outside, the residence
buildings themselves will not be ex
tensively overhauled. Such work is
simply too expensive given that the
buildings are still structurally
sound.
Recently, Serra Street between
Campus Drive and Galvez Street
was resurfaced. However, several
holes about six to eight inches in
diameter were left in the new asphalt.
Will these holes become the potholes
of the future? And if so, why weren't
they filled? - Lara Felker
If you talk to Michael McKnight,
the manager of General Plant Im
provements, you will find (as I did)
that those holes exist only tempo
rarily.
What are they? Typically they are
either sewer manholes, water
valves or surveying markers that
are uncovered when the old paving
is scraped away so that the resur
facing can be done. As the new
pavement is laid down, space is left
around the valves and holes so that
their elevation can be adusted to
make them flush with the new road
surface. Then more asphalt is
added in to fill any remaining gaps.
This "whole" (sorry) process
takes a few weeks, and that is why
the holes seem to be just left there.
If you look now, they are filled in
(save for the manhole covers and
valve plates).
So don't worry. Even Stanford
hasn't yet sunk to the level of
actively planning its potholes in ad
vance.

Hello, friends. I'm glad to have
you all back after what I hope was a
restful and enjoyable break for all of
you. Now please quit reading this
and get to work.
If you have nicks in your DuPont
Silver Stone pot/pan, are car
cinogens leaching into every meal? -
First-Year Grad Student
Most certainly not, according to a
man at DuPont who insisted that I
conceal his name from the reading
public.
Silver Stone is a coating that is
really just an improved version of
Teflon. The polymer has been
worked over a little, to improve its
durability and non-stick properties,
but it is derived from the same fam
ily of resins as Teflon. Presumably,
therefore, it is every bit as safe to
cook with as ol' Teflon is.
Now, if you have nicked your
coating, or if some miscreant,
rapscallion, scalawag or ne'er-do
well made them for you, the only
risk you take in using the pan again
and again is eating little bits of the
Silver Stone coating or eating little
traces of the metal from which the
pan is formed.
The coating should be safe, as
mentioned, since Teflon-type
resins are very stable and inert, but
the quality of the pan itself is deter
mined by the pan's manufacturer.
See, DuPont sells only the
coatings and the rights to use their
names; it is up to the pan manufac
turers to use their purchases as
DuPont recommends. (Otherwise
DuPont will probably refute liability
for people who become ill from
cooking with pans made from, say,
arsenic). The pan maker usually
employs our friends: copper, alumi
num, cast iron or some more exotic
alloy to form the actual cooking ves
sel. None of the above metals

should affect you adversely in any
way, certainly not in the tiny
amounts you might receive from
cooking food on their still-mostly-
Silver-Stone-coated interior.
Copper pans are usually not
coated; they cook quite well with
out any coating. Furthermore, your
body needs trace amounts of cop
per, and the pans look prettier in
their natural state (assuming you
scrub away any corrosion with a
near-religious fervor). Many cast
iron pans are enamel-coated, but as
for those that are not, well, you
need iron to be healthy, too.
Thus it is for the most part alumi
num and its alloys that make up the
pans that are vehicles for DuPont
coatings. These metals, too, are
safe, and unless the manufacturer
throws some francium or plutonium
(detectable with the Geiger counter
that you of course keep about the
house) into the alloy to spice up
your life, your worries about car
cinogens should cease.
Otherwise you risk a stress
induced heart attack.
