# Library Grinch Smurfs Santa
## 
### MARILYN WANN Editorial staff 
Although University policy
prohibits large social gatherings
during Dead Week, six uniden
tified cohorts in collegiate crime
masterminded a Secret Santa
surprise for about 150 of their
peers in Meyer Library's second
floor lobby last quarter.
Taking advantage of the tradi
tion of swapping gifts
anonymously in the dorms, the
pranksters invited 300 students
campuswide to go on a mysteri
ous mission.
A Macintosh-printed letter in
structed them to arrive at Meyer
wearing a Stanford sweatshirt,
the funniest hat they could find
and the enclosed water-soluble
smurf tatoo on their right cheek.
Maintaining complete silence,
they located others who sported
the same smurf character and
then banded together by 11:45
p.m. in preparation for their per
formances.
Each group was directed to ut
ter a designated word, cued in by
the word preceding theirs.
Theoretically, the members of
each smurf group would only
know their word and one other,
but when the series was as
sembled it would form the sen
tence, "We have really been
smurfed."
However, freshman Peter
Commons and his fellow Donner
residents who received the let
ters under their doors had
compiled enough different ver
sions to piece together this
message.
He typed up a small sheet of
new instructions, throwing the

pranksters' message back at
them by writing, "We have really
smurfed you."
The prank was almost foiled
before it had a chance to com
mence when the circulation desk
librarian threatened to call the
police to disperse the large, if
silent, crowd.
One of the original six, who
already knew of the counterplot,
promised to have the lobby
cleared by one minute after mid
night if he could use the building's
public address system.

Seven seconds after the Meyer
clock's hands pointed straight up,
the sentence, "We have really
smurfed you" was recited in uni
son to the confused reaction of
onlookers at the third and fourth
floor inner windows.
Then the pseudo Secret Santas
struck back. A disembodied voice
declared, "This is Santa Claus. So
you think you've smurfed Santa. I
guess the Grinch really has stolen
Christmas after all. Well, merry
Christmas. Now go home."
"We turned it around when we
got on the P.A.," said one of the
cohorts who asked to remain
anonymous to insure the success
of any prankish plans he may con
coct in the future. "Who had the
last word? The smurfers or Santa
Claus?" he challenged.
