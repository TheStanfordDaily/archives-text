## Color Purple' Dims Under Spielberg's Direction 
### GEOFFREY MINTER Staff writer 
Steven Spielberg's film version of
"The Color Purple" isn't as bad as
one might expect it would be. It
fails to achieve greatness,
however, because Spielberg, in his
desire to make the film more accep
table and accessible, has com
promised many of the novel's spe
cial, unique qualities — even to the
point of re-working some of its
ideology. (It is difficult to believe
that author Alice Walker was as
gung-ho about the project as the
recent "The Color Purple" media
blitz has indicated).
The film also suffers from a clash
of styles: Walker's blunt realism vs.
Spielberg's rose-colored sentimen
tality. Auteur Spielberg, opting for
his style over the author's, has
brought some bizarre effects to
"The Color Purple" that seem
strangely out of place: cute domes
tic scenes, funny animals and
frolicking children. Spielberg
wanted to make sure no one would
be turned off by the film, so he
made it as unoffensive as possible,
but someone should have told him
that the same tricks he employed
so skillfully in "Close Encounters"
and "E.T." would be out of place in
a story about as far removed from
suburban living as a story can be.
"The Color Purple" chronicles
the life of Celie (Whoopi Goldberg),
a black woman living in the South
during the early part of this cen
tury. Celie lives an oppressed life:
she's separated from her sister
Nettie (whom she loves more than
anyone else) at an early age, and is
mistreated by all the men in her life.
Celie gains confidence in herself
when she meets Shug Avery, a
female blues singer, who comforts
her and shows her how to stand up
for herself. Celie's self-confidence
and rediscovery of love lead to a
new appreciation of life and a
heightened sense of spirit.
Spielberg conveys the central
subject of love's ability to heal
wounds well enough, but fudges on
the rest of the story.
Alice Walker's novel has feminist
overtones that are all but missing
from the movie. If you go out to buy
some popcorn, you might miss
Celie and Shug's affair: it's hinted at
once and never mentioned again.

Spielberg seems content to keep
Celie and Shug at the level of "just
good friends," perhaps missing the
point that their lesbianism is more
than a deepening of their com
panionship, it's a rejection of the
male-dominated world. Late in the
film, Shug gets married to a man
named Grady and that's that. We
never see the husband again and
get no clue that Shug has left him as
she does in the book. His disap
pearance in the film is shrouded in
ambiguity; we're probably
supposed to assume Grady has
stepped out to go on a business
trip. Shug and Celie are alone to
gether at the end of the film, but we
get the impression that when worse
comes to worse, Shug will be
Grady's wife and not Celie's lover.
To add further insult to the char
acter, Spielberg has given Shug a
father, one she spends much of her
time in the film trying to please.
Shug fell out of favor with her father
(who, of all things, is pastor at the
local church) when she decided to
become a singer; blues singing,
after all, isn't something God
fearing people participate in. Shug

finally decides she can't take the
separation any longer: while singing
late night at the Juke Joint, she
hears gospel music coming from
her father's church and joins in.
Shug leaves the Joint singing the
spiritual and heads over to the
church with everyone following
her. When Shug arrives, her father
sees she's renounced her sinful
ways of living and has come back to
join the flock. The two hug and
everyone sings happily.
Spielberg seems to be saying
that the most satisfying thing Shug
can do for herself is love her father
and try to make him love her. This
idea takes the "power of love"
theme one step too far and seems
somewhat out of kilter with the
novel's point of view. The scene
also mutates the religious attitude
Shug expresses in the book — that
God is not necessarily tied to the
church and It will be happy if people
take note of Its creations.
The story's title comes from a
scene where Shug remarks to Celie
in a field of purple flowers that God
must be pissed off when people
don't notice all the beautiful things

It has brought the world, like the
color purple. That this scene and
the later church scene exist in the
same movie is something of a
curiosity.
Albert, as Celie's husband, is
also toned down in the film. In the
book, Albert's a virtual monster; in
the movie, he's a moderately bad
guy who just happens to beat his
wife. When Celie says late in the
film that she intends to kill Albert
for all the wrong he's done to her,
the announcement comes off as an
over-reaction. It seems unjustified
because the violence is portrayed in
the film in a "nice" way: it's vio
lence without real consequence not
tied to any real, consistent
framework. Albert beats Celie in
one scene and in the next, some
thing comical happens. No tension
exists because the comedy diffuses
the bad feelings that might be lin
gering in the air. The comedy also
serves to make Albert more en
dearing to us. He's not the monster
he should be; he's Ralph Kramden
finally following through with his
threat to send his wife to the moon.
In one ridiculous scene, Albert

tries to get on Shug's good side by
making her breakfast. The joke is
he's never been in a kitchen before,
and he nearly succeeds in blowing
up the house while cooking. The
food, as you might expect, is burnt
beyond recognition. This kind of
sitcom slapstick just doesn't belong
in a film that in other scenes
professes to be serious and realis
tic. The humor represents an at
tempt to make the film's harshness
easier to digest, but violence
shouldn't be made easier to digest.
We should be appalled by what we
see, not simply accept it.
The film is also "cleaner" than it
should be. The houses are too big
and too well-organized. One of
Celie's first duties as Albert's wife
is to clean the house's cluttered
kitchen, but things don't really look
that disheveled. It's pre-planned
chaos; someone must have spent
hours trying to give the kitchen that
perfect, messy look. The worst
side effect of the clean-up job,
however, is the loss of the book's
dialect. In Menno Meyjes'
screenplay, the characters sound
and talk more like people from Cul

ver City than people from the
South.
Spielberg has also removed much
of the novel's realistic plainness in
favor of something more emotion
ally hyped-up. When we first see
Celie and Nettie, they are playing a
clapping game, and when Albert
separates the two, they play the
same game again from a distance as
the loudest violins in the history of
film swell up over the soundtrack to
remind us that what we're watching
is a poignant scene. A master of
emotional subtlety Spielberg is not.
His hyped sentiment only serves to
cheapen what might have otherwise
been a truly touching scene.
For all its faults, "The Color
Purple" has moments of goodness.
Oprah Winfrey takes charge of the
film as Sofia, the wife of Albert's
son Harpo, a high-tempered woman
not afraid to show people she dis
agrees with them by using her fists.
Winfrey struts across the screen
brandishing her mean disposition
and threatening fists, and all eyes in
the theater look to see what she
does whenever she's in a scene
with other people. Her presence is
powerful in the way Shug's should
be. Winfrey is without question the
liveliest actor in the whole movie.
Sofia eventually hits the wrong
person and is punished. When she
gets out of jail, she's a new woman;
her former rebelliousness has been
broken and she limps around doing
what people tell her to do without
question. Sofia's spirit seems to
die; she's just a dried-up shell of her
former self. The transformation is
the most emotional in the movie,
and Winfrey's face fully expresses
her character's anguish when she
comes home for Christmas to a
house that's become as much a
stranger to her as she has become
to it. It's a truly inspired perfor
mance.
Winfrey resembles her character
more closely than the other actors
in the movie do theirs, and the
Spielberg presentation of Sofia is
nearly totally faithful to the charac
ter in the book. Had he not
decided to re-make "The Color
Purple" in his own style, removing
the things he believed might not be
well-received, Spielberg might
have had a great film on his hands.
As it stands, his version of "The
Color Purple" is merely good.

become a singer; blues singing,
after all, isn't something God
fearing people participate in. Shug

finally decides she can't take the
separation any longer: while singing
late night at the Juke Joint, she
hears gospel music coming from
her father's church and joins in.
Shug leaves the Joint singing the
spiritual and heads over to the
church with everyone following
her. When Shug arrives, her father
sees she's renounced her sinful
ways of living and has come back to
join the flock. The two hug and
everyone sings happily.
Spielberg seems to be saying
that the most satisfying thing Shug
can do for herself is love her father
and try to make him love her. This
idea takes the "power of love"
theme one step too far and seems
somewhat out of kilter with the
novel's point of view. The scene
also mutates the religious attitude
Shug expresses in the book — that
God is not necessarily tied to the
church and It will be happy if people
take note of Its creations.
The story's title comes from a
scene where Shug remarks to Celie
in a field of purple flowers that God
must be pissed off when people
don't notice all the beautiful things

It has brought the world, like the
color purple. That this scene and
the later church scene exist in the
same movie is something of a
curiosity.
Albert, as Celie's husband, is
also toned down in the film. In the
book, Albert's a virtual monster; in
the movie, he's a moderately bad
guy who just happens to beat his
wife. When Celie says late in the
film that she intends to kill Albert
for all the wrong he's done to her,
the announcement comes off as an
over-reaction. It seems unjustified
because the violence is portrayed in
the film in a "nice" way: it's vio
lence without real consequence not
tied to any real, consistent
framework. Albert beats Celie in
one scene and in the next, some
thing comical happens. No tension
exists because the comedy diffuses
the bad feelings that might be lin
gering in the air. The comedy also
serves to make Albert more en
dearing to us. He's not the monster
he should be; he's Ralph Kramden
finally following through with his
threat to send his wife to the moon.
In one ridiculous scene, Albert

tries to get on Shug's good side by
making her breakfast. The joke is
he's never been in a kitchen before,
and he nearly succeeds in blowing
up the house while cooking. The
food, as you might expect, is burnt
beyond recognition. This kind of
sitcom slapstick just doesn't belong
in a film that in other scenes
professes to be serious and realis
tic. The humor represents an at
tempt to make the film's harshness
easier to digest, but violence
shouldn't be made easier to digest.
We should be appalled by what we
see, not simply accept it.
The film is also "cleaner" than it
should be. The houses are too big
and too well-organized. One of
Celie's first duties as Albert's wife
is to clean the house's cluttered
kitchen, but things don't really look
that disheveled. It's pre-planned
chaos; someone must have spent
hours trying to give the kitchen that
perfect, messy look. The worst
side effect of the clean-up job,
however, is the loss of the book's
dialect. In Menno Meyjes'
screenplay, the characters sound
and talk more like people from Cul

ver City than people from the
South.
Spielberg has also removed much
of the novel's realistic plainness in
favor of something more emotion
ally hyped-up. When we first see
Celie and Nettie, they are playing a
clapping game, and when Albert
separates the two, they play the
same game again from a distance as
the loudest violins in the history of
film swell up over the soundtrack to
remind us that what we're watching
is a poignant scene. A master of
emotional subtlety Spielberg is not.
His hyped sentiment only serves to
cheapen what might have otherwise
been a truly touching scene.
For all its faults, "The Color
Purple" has moments of goodness.
Oprah Winfrey takes charge of the
film as Sofia, the wife of Albert's
son Harpo, a high-tempered woman
not afraid to show people she dis
agrees with them by using her fists.
Winfrey struts across the screen
brandishing her mean disposition
and threatening fists, and all eyes in
the theater look to see what she
does whenever she's in a scene
with other people. Her presence is
powerful in the way Shug's should
be. Winfrey is without question the
liveliest actor in the whole movie.
Sofia eventually hits the wrong
person and is punished. When she
gets out of jail, she's a new woman;
her former rebelliousness has been
broken and she limps around doing
what people tell her to do without
question. Sofia's spirit seems to
die; she's just a dried-up shell of her
former self. The transformation is
the most emotional in the movie,
and Winfrey's face fully expresses
her character's anguish when she
comes home for Christmas to a
house that's become as much a
stranger to her as she has become
to it. It's a truly inspired perfor
mance.
Winfrey resembles her character
more closely than the other actors
in the movie do theirs, and the
Spielberg presentation of Sofia is
nearly totally faithful to the charac
ter in the book. Had he not
decided to re-make "The Color
Purple" in his own style, removing
the things he believed might not be
well-received, Spielberg might
have had a great film on his hands.
As it stands, his version of "The
Color Purple" is merely good.


Whoopi Goldberg, who makes her screen debut in "The Color
Purple," consults with producer/director Steven Spielberg on

the set of the film. "The Color Purple" is an adaptation of the
Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same title by Alice Walker.
Steven Spielberg's film version of
"The Color Purple" isn't as bad as
one might expect it would be. It
fails to achieve greatness,
however, because Spielberg, in his
desire to make the film more accep
table and accessible, has com
promised many of the novel's spe
cial, unique qualities — even to the
point of re-working some of its
ideology. (It is difficult to believe
that author Alice Walker was as
gung-ho about the project as the
recent "The Color Purple" media
blitz has indicated).
The film also suffers from a clash
of styles: Walker's blunt realism vs.
Spielberg's rose-colored sentimen
tality. Auteur Spielberg, opting for
his style over the author's, has
brought some bizarre effects to
"The Color Purple" that seem
strangely out of place: cute domes
tic scenes, funny animals and
frolicking children. Spielberg
wanted to make sure no one would
be turned off by the film, so he
made it as unoffensive as possible,
but someone should have told him
that the same tricks he employed
so skillfully in "Close Encounters"
and "E.T." would be out of place in
a story about as far removed from
suburban living as a story can be.
"The Color Purple" chronicles
the life of Celie (Whoopi Goldberg),
a black woman living in the South
during the early part of this cen
tury. Celie lives an oppressed life:
she's separated from her sister
Nettie (whom she loves more than
anyone else) at an early age, and is
mistreated by all the men in her life.
Celie gains confidence in herself
when she meets Shug Avery, a
female blues singer, who comforts
her and shows her how to stand up
for herself. Celie's self-confidence
and rediscovery of love lead to a
new appreciation of life and a
heightened sense of spirit.
Spielberg conveys the central
subject of love's ability to heal
wounds well enough, but fudges on
the rest of the story.
Alice Walker's novel has feminist
overtones that are all but missing
from the movie. If you go out to buy
some popcorn, you might miss
Celie and Shug's affair: it's hinted at
once and never mentioned again.

Spielberg seems content to keep
Celie and Shug at the level of "just
good friends," perhaps missing the
point that their lesbianism is more
than a deepening of their com
panionship, it's a rejection of the
male-dominated world. Late in the
film, Shug gets married to a man
named Grady and that's that. We
never see the husband again and
get no clue that Shug has left him as
she does in the book. His disap
pearance in the film is shrouded in
ambiguity; we're probably
supposed to assume Grady has
stepped out to go on a business
trip. Shug and Celie are alone to
gether at the end of the film, but we
get the impression that when worse
comes to worse, Shug will be
Grady's wife and not Celie's lover.
To add further insult to the char
acter, Spielberg has given Shug a
father, one she spends much of her
time in the film trying to please.
Shug fell out of favor with her father
(who, of all things, is pastor at the
local church) when she decided to
become a singer; blues singing,
after all, isn't something God
fearing people participate in. Shug

finally decides she can't take the
separation any longer: while singing
late night at the Juke Joint, she
hears gospel music coming from
her father's church and joins in.

side effect of the clean-up job,
however, is the loss of the book's
dialect. In Menno Meyjes'
screenplay, the characters sound
and talk more like people from Cul

ver City than people from the
South.
Spielberg has also removed much
of the novel's realistic plainness in
favor of something more emotion
ally hyped-up. When we first see
Celie and Nettie, they are playing a
clapping game, and when Albert
separates the two, they play the
same game again from a distance as
the loudest violins in the history of
film swell up over the soundtrack to
remind us that what we're watching
is a poignant scene. A master of
emotional subtlety Spielberg is not.
His hyped sentiment only serves to
cheapen what might have otherwise
been a truly touching scene.
For all its faults, "The Color
Purple" has moments of goodness.
Oprah Winfrey takes charge of the
film as Sofia, the wife of Albert's
son Harpo, a high-tempered woman
not afraid to show people she dis
agrees with them by using her fists.
Winfrey struts across the screen
brandishing her mean disposition
and threatening fists, and all eyes in
the theater look to see what she
does whenever she's in a scene
with other people. Her presence is
powerful in the way Shug's should
be. Winfrey is without question the
liveliest actor in the whole movie.
Sofia eventually hits the wrong
person and is punished. When she
gets out of jail, she's a new woman;
her former rebelliousness has been
broken and she limps around doing
what people tell her to do without
question. Sofia's spirit seems to
die; she's just a dried-up shell of her
former self. The transformation is
the most emotional in the movie,
and Winfrey's face fully expresses
her character's anguish when she
comes home for Christmas to a
house that's become as much a
stranger to her as she has become
to it. It's a truly inspired perfor
mance.
Winfrey resembles her character
more closely than the other actors
in the movie do theirs, and the
Spielberg presentation of Sofia is
nearly totally faithful to the charac
ter in the book. Had he not
decided to re-make "The Color
Purple" in his own style, removing
the things he believed might not be
well-received, Spielberg might
have had a great film on his hands.
As it stands, his version of "The
Color Purple" is merely good.


Whoopi Goldberg, who makes her screen debut in "The Color
Purple," consults with producer/director Steven Spielberg on

the set of the film. "The Color Purple" is an adaptation of the
Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same title by Alice Walker.
Steven Spielberg's film version of
"The Color Purple" isn't as bad as
one might expect it would be. It
fails to achieve greatness,
however, because Spielberg, in his
desire to make the film more accep
table and accessible, has com
promised many of the novel's spe
cial, unique qualities — even to the
point of re-working some of its
ideology. (It is difficult to believe
that author Alice Walker was as
gung-ho about the project as the
recent "The Color Purple" media
blitz has indicated).
The film also suffers from a clash
of styles: Walker's blunt realism vs.
Spielberg's rose-colored sentimen
tality. Auteur Spielberg, opting for
his style over the author's, has
brought some bizarre effects to
"The Color Purple" that seem
strangely out of place: cute domes
tic scenes, funny animals and
frolicking children. Spielberg
wanted to make sure no one would
be turned off by the film, so he
made it as unoffensive as possible,
but someone should have told him
that the same tricks he employed
so skillfully in "Close Encounters"
and "E.T." would be out of place in
a story about as far removed from
suburban living as a story can be.
"The Color Purple" chronicles
the life of Celie (Whoopi Goldberg),
a black woman living in the South
during the early part of this cen
tury. Celie lives an oppressed life:
she's separated from her sister
Nettie (whom she loves more than
anyone else) at an early age, and is
mistreated by all the men in her life.
Celie gains confidence in herself
when she meets Shug Avery, a
female blues singer, who comforts
her and shows her how to stand up
for herself. Celie's self-confidence
and rediscovery of love lead to a
new appreciation of life and a
heightened sense of spirit.
Spielberg conveys the central
subject of love's ability to heal
wounds well enough, but fudges on
the rest of the story.
Alice Walker's novel has feminist
overtones that are all but missing
from the movie. If you go out to buy
some popcorn, you might miss
Celie and Shug's affair: it's hinted at
once and never mentioned again.

Spielberg seems content to keep
Celie and Shug at the level of "just
good friends," perhaps missing the
point that their lesbianism is more
than a deepening of their com
panionship, it's a rejection of the
male-dominated world. Late in the
film, Shug gets married to a man
named Grady and that's that. We
never see the husband again and
get no clue that Shug has left him as
she does in the book. His disap
pearance in the film is shrouded in
ambiguity; we're probably
supposed to assume Grady has
stepped out to go on a business
trip. Shug and Celie are alone to
gether at the end of the film, but we
get the impression that when worse
comes to worse, Shug will be
Grady's wife and not Celie's lover.
To add further insult to the char
acter, Spielberg has given Shug a
father, one she spends much of her
time in the film trying to please.
Shug fell out of favor with her father
(who, of all things, is pastor at the
local church) when she decided to
become a singer; blues singing,
after all, isn't something God
fearing people participate in. Shug

finally decides she can't take the
separation any longer: while singing
late night at the Juke Joint, she
hears gospel music coming from
her father's church and joins in.
Shug leaves the Joint singing the
spiritual and heads over to the
church with everyone following
her. When Shug arrives, her father
sees she's renounced her sinful
ways of living and has come back to
join the flock. The two hug and
everyone sings happily.
Spielberg seems to be saying
that the most satisfying thing Shug
can do for herself is love her father
and try to make him love her. This
idea takes the "power of love"
theme one step too far and seems
somewhat out of kilter with the
novel's point of view. The scene
also mutates the religious attitude
Shug expresses in the book — that
God is not necessarily tied to the
church and It will be happy if people
take note of Its creations.
The story's title comes from a
scene where Shug remarks to Celie
in a field of purple flowers that God
must be pissed off when people
don't notice all the beautiful things

It has brought the world, like the
color purple. That this scene and
the later church scene exist in the
same movie is something of a
curiosity.
Albert, as Celie's husband, is
also toned down in the film. In the
book, Albert's a virtual monster; in
the movie, he's a moderately bad
guy who just happens to beat his
wife. When Celie says late in the
film that she intends to kill Albert
for all the wrong he's done to her,
the announcement comes off as an
over-reaction. It seems unjustified
because the violence is portrayed in
the film in a "nice" way: it's vio
lence without real consequence not
tied to any real, consistent
framework. Albert beats Celie in
one scene and in the next, some
thing comical happens. No tension
exists because the comedy diffuses
the bad feelings that might be lin
gering in the air. The comedy also
serves to make Albert more en
dearing to us. He's not the monster
he should be; he's Ralph Kramden
finally following through with his
threat to send his wife to the moon.
In one ridiculous scene, Albert

tries to get on Shug's good side by
making her breakfast. The joke is
he's never been in a kitchen before,
and he nearly succeeds in blowing
up the house while cooking. The
food, as you might expect, is burnt
beyond recognition. This kind of
sitcom slapstick just doesn't belong
in a film that in other scenes
professes to be serious and realis
tic. The humor represents an at
tempt to make the film's harshness
easier to digest, but violence
shouldn't be made easier to digest.
We should be appalled by what we
see, not simply accept it.
The film is also "cleaner" than it
should be. The houses are too big
and too well-organized. One of
Celie's first duties as Albert's wife
is to clean the house's cluttered
kitchen, but things don't really look
that disheveled. It's pre-planned
chaos; someone must have spent
hours trying to give the kitchen that
perfect, messy look. The worst
side effect of the clean-up job,
however, is the loss of the book's
dialect. In Menno Meyjes'
screenplay, the characters sound
and talk more like people from Cul

ver City than people from the
South.
