## No Good Cheer Grapplers' break is no fun 
### PETER CASTILLO Staff writer 
Santa was not particularly kind to
the Stanford Cardinal wrestling
team over the winter recess.
With disappointing tournament
performances over the break, the
squad dropped all three of its dual
meets and saw its dual meet record
fall to 3-4.
Stanford traveled to Las Vegas
Dec. 6 to compete in the Las Vegas
Invitational, the biggest and tough
est tournament in the nation other
than NCAA Championships. The
Cardinal finished 15th out of 43
teams with Jeff Bradley (134
pounds) taking third, while Dave
Lee (167) and Pete Rogers (158)
both captured sixth.
While registering the quickest pin
in the tournament, Lee won his first
four matches by pins. But he acci
dently pinned himself in his fifth
match, which took the steam out of
his attack, and he lost his next two
matches.
Bradley, Lee, Rogers and Scott
Wiggen, listed as an unattached
wrestler while he is red-shirting
this year, all competed in the Mid
land Open at Northwestern Univer
sity Dec. 30, but none of them
placed in the tournament.
"We got beaten handily in our
dual meets," wrestling Coach Chris
Horpel said. "We could have given

them a better fight if our wrestlers
were better prepared, but they did
not train well on their own over the
vacation. The guys who went to the
Midland tournament were a little
flat (after) they peaked in Las
Vegas."
By the time the Cardinal traveled
back to the West Coast for a match
in Corvallis, Ore., on Dec. 31, the
team was pretty weary. Stanford
took on Oregon State and Portland
State and was thoroughly trounced
by both teams. The Cardinal
opened by losing to Oregon State
44-10 and then followed that perfor
mance with a 37-14 loss to Portland
State.
The only Stanford wrestlers to
win against the OSU Beavers were
Bradley and Rogers, who were
both singled out by Horpel as bright
spots during the otherwise dismal
week. Bradley defeated Carlton
Hester 14-3 and Rogers scored a
technical pin, 17-2, over Eric
Hengler.
Against Portland State, Stanford
could only muster three victories
on the mat. Lee won by forfeit,
heavyweight Kurt Kassulke nar
rowly beat John Kehrli 6-5 and
Rogers won 16-4 over Wayne
Trosino.
"I had to let these guys know
that these teams are better, but
that we shouldn't be walked over,"

Horpel said of the talk he gave the
wrestlers after the two losses.
"Still, I didn't coddle them and told
them if they did not wrestle well
against Oregon they would not
wrestle in the (next meet)."
The team did improve, but was
still beaten by Oregon 33-11 on Jan.

2. Rogers scored his third straight
victory by defeating Brian Jackson
9-8, while Kassulke bested James
Terry 9-2. Lee managed a 3-3 tie
against Mike Harter, who is one of
the top 10 wrestlers in the nation in
his weight class.
Bradley showed signs of tiring

from his hard training and all the
travel during his 8-7 come-from
behind win over Oregon's Danny
White. And in Stanford's next meet
— the Doc Peterson Open at Chico
State Jan. 4 — Horpel pulled Brad
ley out in order to give him a rest.
In the Doc Peterson Open, Lee

captured second, losing in the finals
15-9 to Cal State-Bakersfield's Dar
ryl Pope, one of the top six in the
nation. Wiggen, again wrestling un
attached at 142 pounds, took third
and Rogers finished fourth.
The Cardinal faces Bakersfield
this Saturday on the road.
