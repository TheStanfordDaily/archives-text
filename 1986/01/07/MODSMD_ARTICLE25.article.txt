# Cardinal Swimmers Faced Some Tough Tests in Texas
## 
### MARY K. McDEVITT Staff writer 
After the Dec. 8 morning preliminary competition,
most of the swimmers at the U.S. Open Swimming
Championships in Austin, Texas, lied around in their
hotel rooms, planning their race strategies and psych
ing themselves for the evening's final races.
Unlike the swimmers from East Germany, Holland
and Great Britain who came to the international meet
with only winning on their minds, the Stanford women
had other finals to worry about. Some of them had to
study for end-of-quarter exams that they would take
the morning after the meet ended and they arrived
back on the Farm.
Some Cardinal swimmers decided to forego the
meet to study. The seven freshmen, one sophomore
and one senior who did compete were no match
teamwise for the Texas and Florida full-house squads.
But a couple of the Cardinal were surprised with
how well they performed.
"I was really happy with my swims," freshman Mi
chelle Donahue said. She placed fourth in the 100-
meter backstroke and sixth in the 200-meter back

stroke, the only two women's races in which American
records were set.
Donahue finished the 100-meter backstroke with a
personal record of 1:03.69. Texas swimmer Betsy
Mitchell raced to American and pool records in the 100-
and 200-meter races with times of 1:01.79 and 2:11.82
respectively.
In spite of being kept out of the 200-meter
breastroke by an old groin injury that she aggravated in
a relay, senior Kathy Smith, a co-captain, was pleased
with her performance in the 100-meter race. She
placed eighth in the 100-meter event with a time of
1:13.59.
"I felt really good," Smith said. "I surprised myself
because I wasn't completely rested like I was for na
tionals last year, and I swam faster than I did at nation
als."
Freshman sprinter Jenna Johnson was the only Card
inal to place in the finals of three individual events.
Johnson scored sth in the 100-meter freestyle, 6th in
the 50-meter freestyle and 7th in the 100-meter
butterfly.

meter breast stoke at the U.S. Open Swimming Championships in Texas, but she was still able to
finish eighth in the 100-meter event.
