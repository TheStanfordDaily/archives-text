## Pats Look To Squish the Fish 
### 
BOSTON (AP) â€” A "new" New Eng
land Patriots football team returned
home yesterday after having gone fur
ther in the playoffs than at any time since
joining the National Football League and,
in the process, putting to rest some bit
ter postseason memories.
With its 27-20 triumph over the AFC
West Division champion Los Angeles
Raiders, New England settled a 10-year
old grudge and began thinking positively
about a return to the Orange Bowl to bat
tle Miami for the conference crown.
The Patriots had seemed headed for a
victory in the 1976 playoffs over the
then-Oakland Raiders when a roughing
the passer penalty late in the game
allowed the Raiders to sustain a drive
that led to the winning score. The
Raiders ultimately defeated the Minne
sota Vikings in the Super Bowl.
Those associated with the team have
long talked about that call against defen
sive lineman Ray Hamilton, now an assis
tant coach with the team. Hamilton has
charged that because of the penalty, he
was "cheated out of a Super Bowl ring."
But yesterday, Patriot fans and former
players were looking toward the future.
Jim Nance, who carried the ball for the
Patriots when they were based in Boston
and played in the American Football
League, said he is not worried about the
Patriots' AFC championship game
against the Dolphins Sunday in Miami,
where the Pats have lost 18 consecutive
times.
"The younger guys are coming along.
They are not going for the superstition of
being unable to win in Miami. It's a new
team, a new attitude," said the former

fullback. "They are saying, Why should
we go to Miami and let a superstition that
we had nothing to do with upset our
desire to win?'
"I would really like to see them beat
the Dolphins in Miami. And I definitely
think they can."
That feeling was shared by more than
1,000 fans who turned out at T.F. Green
State Airport in Warwick, R. 1., early yes
terday to greet the team as it returned
from the West Coast.
Players walked through the packed
terminal, slapping hands with fans who
were chanting "Bring on Miami" and car
rying banners, including one that said
"Squish the Fish."
In Miami, no one is worried about the
Dolphins ability to put points on the
board, but there is concern about how
many the Patriots will put there.
For those who say four teams, but
only three defenses, still are alive in the
NFL playoffs, Miami Dolphins defensive
coordinator Chuck Studley has no quick
retort.
He doesn't appreciate that slight of the
Miami defense, and he might have argued
the assertion a week ago. But yesterday,
he agreed that the Dolphins still have a
lot of work to do on the defensive side of
the ball.
Asked to discuss his run defense
which gave up 251 yards in the Dolphins'
24-21 victory over the Cleveland Browns
Saturday, he replied "What run
defense?" and laughed.
That he still can joke about his prob
lems indicates that Studley doesn't think
they are as severe as some statistics in
dicate.

"The game against the Browns was
particularly disappointing because for the
past five weeks we've been improving,"
Studley said. "We really thought we were
getting better. Then, gee, we give up
200 and something yards and a six-yard
average and a 66-yard run.
"And now we've got to be concerned
because of New England's ability to run."
The Patriots will bring a 13-5 record
and an impressive three-game winning
streak into the Orange Bowl for Sunday's
AFC Championship game against the 13-
4 Dolphins.
The New England defense is
recognized as one of the best young units
in the league, led by All-Pro linebacker
Andre Tippett. Over in the NFC Champi
onship game, the punishing Chicago
Bears defense is the best in the game,
and the Los Angeles Rams' defense
carried a lackluster offense much of the
season.
Then, there's the Miami defense,
ranked 23rd in the league, giving up 360
yards per game. Tampa Bay victimized
the Dolphins for 38 points and Detroit
got 31.
On the NFC side of the race for foot
ball's greatest crown, the Lombardi
Trophy, the Chicago Bears will meet the
Los Angeles Rams for the NFC title in
Chicago next Sunday. They'll not only be
trying to win a trip to the Super Bowl,
but they will be trying to assert an un
precedented dominance over the rest of
their conference.
