# Cyclones Hit Maples Tonight
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
The Stanford women's basketball team is
looking for some good competition to help
prepare it for the upcoming Pac-West season.
Stanford need not look further than tonight
when the lowa State Cyclones visit Maples
Pavilion at 7:30 to provide the Cardinal with an
adequate amount of competition, and then some.
The Cyclones, currently in the midst of an
eight-game winning streak, come to the Farm
fresh from a successful stint at the Holiday Clas
sic Tournament held last weekend in Santa Clara.
lowa State captured the tournament by defeat
ing UC-Irvine 64-59 in the championship finale.
Before that, the Cyclones humbled the Santa
Clara Broncos, 73-59, a team that defeated Stan
ford earlier in the season.
In only her second year as head coach of the
Cyclones, Pam Wettig has rebuilt a team that
went 4-24 in 1984 to a 10-1 squad this year. The
only blemish was a 63-57 loss to 16th-ranked
lowa in December.
A big reason why lowa State is no longer the
doormat of the the Big Eight Conference is 6-
foot-1 center/forward Stephanie Smith, a junior
transfer from St. Ambrose in lowa.
MVP at the Holiday Classic, Smith poured in
14 points and grabbed 19 rebounds against the
Anteaters in the championship contest.
But the Cyclones are by no means a one-
woman show. Wettig used the
entire roster against Santa Clara
and most of it against Irvine. The
result was a well-balanced offensive
attack that prevented the opposi
tion from isolating solely on Smith.
Against the Broncos, Rhonda
Thacker came off the bench to
score 16 points for the Cyclones.
Even though lowa State actually
sports a three-forward lineup minus
a tall center (Smith is the tallest),
the Cyclones are an outstanding
rebounding team. The Cyclones
dominated under the boards against
the Broncos, a decent rebounding
team. lowa State out-rebounded
Santa Clara 56-29.
"They box-out very well," Stan
ford Asst. Coach Julie Plank -said.
"They also run a tough man-to-man
defense.
"But they're not really that fast,"
she continued. "I think we can run
on them. We're also bigger. We
should try to work the ball inside."
The contest underneath the
boards will indeed be crucial for
both sides. The Cyclones aren't un
beatable, but Stanford will have to
excel in this area if it hopes to win.
