EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) â€” Bud Grant has decided to step
down as head coach of the Minnesota Vikings and assistant coach
Jerry Bums will succeed him, General Manager Mike Lynn an

Grant led the Vikings to a 7-9 record this season, his first since
replacing rookie Coach Les Steckel. Steckel was fired as Vikings
coach last year after the National Football League team posted a 3-

"There are other things I want to do, " said Grant, 58. He said he
was resigning "for the same reasons I had given earlier."

more time hunting and fishing.

after working two years as the defensive backfield coach with the
Green Bay Packers. Prior to that, he coached at the Universtiy of
lowa for 12 years, five as head coach, and he also coached at the Uni

"Obviously I'm very elated, very excited," said Burns. He said
Lynn contacted him last Saturday in Jamaica about becoming the
Vikings head coach.
Grant said he was leaving the team with "a good taste in his
mouth." He said the team was only a block or a pass away from
making the playoffs.
Grant coached the Vikings for 18 years including this season and
led them to four Super Bowl berths. As head coach of the Vikings his
teams compiled a regular season record of 158-96-5. Under his guid
