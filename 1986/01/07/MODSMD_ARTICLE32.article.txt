U.S., Hanoi Hold Talks on MIAs
HANOI, Vietnam — The highest-level U.S. delegation to visit
Vietnam since the war ended in 1975 met officials here for three
hours yesterday to discuss ways to speed up the search for
Americans still listed as missing in action.
Neither side disclosed details of the session.
Vietnam has promised to resolve the MIA issue within two years.
It is believed that details of steps to be taken are a major item on the
agenda.
Washington lists about 2,400 Americans as missing in action in
communist Indochina, 1,797 of them in Vietnam. The rest are listed
as missing in Cambodia and Laos.
After the meeting, the head of the U.S. delegation, Asst. Defense
Secretary Richard Armitage, told reporters: "I'll just say that both
sides engaged in an in-depth discussion of all aspects of the American
prisoner of war-missing in action issue, to include how we might ac
celerate progress toward the resolution of this issue."
Deputy Foreign Minister Hoang Bich Son, who headed the Viet
namese team, said: "I agree with Mr. Armitage. Neither side wants
to say more now."
Vietnamese officials insist that they regard the whereabouts of the
MIAs as a humanitarian issue, but they also seek normalization of
diplomatic ties with the United States, which Washington says is not
possible while Hanoi's troops remain in Cambodia.
Vietnam ousted the communist Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia
in January 1979 and set up a pro-Hanoi government.
20,000 S. African Miners Fired
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Twenty thousand black
miners were fired yesterday at three of South Africa's largest
platinum mines, and 10,000 more were threatened with dismissal
today if they continued a strike begun a week ago.
Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd., the West's second-largest
platinum producer, said that it had come to a virtual halt over the
weekend at all four of its mines and its processing plant in Bophut
hatswana, one of South Africa's nominally independent tribal
homelands, with only a few hundred miners continuing to work.
The firings constitute the largest mass dismissal of black workers
here in recent years and represent a direct challenge to the emerg
ing political ambitions of the National Union of Mineworkers and
other black labor unions.
Gary Maude, Impala's acting chief executive officer, told reporters
that the company had decided to fire the strikers because it found
their demands for pay increases "far too high" and their calls for im
proved working conditions and stricter safety standards "expensive
and unreasonable in current circumstances."
But Maude and other Impala officials did not hide the company's in
tention of preventing the unionization of the platinum miners and
dealing a major blow to the National Union of Mineworkers, whose
Bophuthatswana affiliate claims to represent most of the 30,000
miners involved. The company has refused to recognize the union,
although the miners' support of the strike is beyond dispute.
Britain Names New Ambassador
LONDON — Britain is sending its senior professional diplomat as
its new ambassador to Washington, Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's government announced yesterday.
Antony Acland, currently serving as permanent undersecretary of
state and chief of the diplomatic service, will replace outgoing Am
bassador Oliver Wright in early September. Wright, whom Thatcher
called out of retirement to take over the Washington embassy four
and-a-half years ago, is expected to leave in July and will not take an
other diplomatic post.
The office of permanent undersecretary is the highest in the
British foreign service and traditionally is followed by retirement.
According to Foreign Office officials, the Washington embassy —
Britain's largest and most important — is the only posting that can be
considered a step up for someone in Acland's position.
"It is the one job that, if anybody asked me throughout my career,
I unquestionably would have said I'd like to go be ambassador to
Washington," Acland said Monday in a briefing for American cor
respondents here.
His appointment, which he said already has been approved by the
Reagan Administration, comes at a time when Thatcher is under
sharp domestic questioning for the current close alignment between
U.S. and British policy in a number of areas.
He said that relations between Britain and the Reagan Administra
tion had been greatly improved by continuing indications that "the
U.S. administration does value dialogue" with its allies, and said that
such consultation was "particularly intense at the moment on secur
ity issues and East-West relations . . . which this year will probably
be the most important issue."
Aquino Vows Economic Reform
MANILA, Philippines — Presidential candidate Corazon Aquino
unveiled yesterday a broad economic program calling for the disman
tling of industrial monopolies held by what she called "cronies" of
President Ferdinand Marcos.
Pledging a regime "that will always be open to correction," the 52-
year-old widow of slain opposition leader Benigno Aquino, Jr., com
forted local and foreign businessmen with the declaration that the
private sector would remain the engine for economic development.
Aquino outlined six economic measures to reinvigorate the
Philippine economy, which has fallen with unprecdented speed since
her husband was assassinated at Manila Airport in August 1983.
"My first concern," she said, "Is to eliminate mass poverty, un
employment and underemployment. My government will move to al
leviate these problems.
"My government will not pamper the private sector. There will be
less government and the government will not be in direct competi
tion with the private sector," she said.
Iraq Claims Renewed Offensive
BAGHDAD, Iraq — Iraq said its forces launched a ground offen
sive early yesterday in the southern oil-rich Majnoon Islands.
Iraq said it had liberated certain positions "extending along several
kilometers" in the southern part of the oilfield after killing hundreds
of Iranian soldiers and capturing large numbers of others. It said its
forces sustained no casualties.
There was no immediate Iranian comment on the reported action
in Majnoon, partly occupied by Iran in previous offensives.
But Iran said its warplanes had caused extensive casualties and da
mages at an Iraqi military camp near the northern town of Rwanduz.
It said all its aircraft had returned safely to base.
