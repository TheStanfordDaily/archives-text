## Reagan To Seek Reprisals Against Libya 
### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan is expected to announce
that the United States will impose
new non-military measures on
Libya as a reprisal for the Dec. 27
airport terrorist attacks in Vienna
and Rome.
U.S. officials said the announce
ment, to be made today at the pres
ident's first press conference since
Sept. 17, does not mean that the
U.S. might not take military action
against Libya as well. But they said
that the non-military steps are of a
long-term nature to "ratchet up the
pressures" on Libyan leader Moam
mar Khadafy.
The officials, speaking while U.S.
warships backed by jets prowled
the Mediterranean, said that the
non-military options included:
• Eliminating all U.S. trade with
Libya.
• Virtual elimination of visas to
Libyans who want to study in this
country.
• Efforts to get the Western allies

to join in imposing the sanctions.
Last year, the U.S. sold about
$390 million worth of goods to
Libya — down from $525 million in
1981.
Yesterday, the president, des
cribed as "increasingly disturbed"
by the airport terrorist attacks, met
with his national security advisers
with an eye to striking back at the
country he has accused of support
ing terrorism.
White House spokesman Larry
Speakes talked of asking reluctant
allies to go along with economic
boycotts to isolate Libya. "We will
be consulting with the European
allies and others regarding the pos
sibility of a concerted effort on the
part of governments against
Libya," he said.
Speakes also denounced the
barley-field press conference
Khadafy held Sunday and denied
that a U. S. task force is threatening
Libya. "The United States fleet in
the Mediterranean is on routine pa

trol," Speakes said. The Pentagon
said that about 24 ships, backed by
planes equipped with radar jamming
devices, were on duty in the
Mediterranean, awaiting orders.
One possible target could be ter
rorist training camps in Libya.
Khadafy, speaking in the barley
field, denied the existence of such

camps. Speakes, speaking in the
White House press room, said "We
have firm evidence of training
camps in Libya that train terror
ists."
But Speakes indicated that a mili
tary strike against those camps is
unlikely, at least for the present.
Asked why they had not been
bombed, he answered: "We want to
be certain as to what we're doing
and where we're striking. We sub
scribe to the norms of behavior that
many other countries do not, par
ticularly those that export ter
rorism. "
An aide to Khadafy said in Tripoli
yesterday that Libya expects "to be
attacked this week" by Israel with
logistical support being provided by
the United States. Libya has denied
it was responsible for the actions of
the terrorists.
Speakes again urged that the
more than 1,000 U.S. citizens living
in Libya leave that country.
