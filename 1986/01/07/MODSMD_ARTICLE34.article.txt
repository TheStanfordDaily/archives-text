# Inefficiency Spurs Firing of Postmaster
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Postmaster General Paul
Carlin, a career Postal Service worker who rose
to that agency's top job only a year ago, was
removed yesterday by the Postal Service Board
of Governors and replaced as postmaster gen
eral by former American Airlines Chairman Al
bert Casey.
In a closed meeting, the 11-member board ap
parently acted out of displeasure over slow and
costly shifts to automated mail handling and a
controversial ZIP-plus-4 coding system, among
other woes, several experts said.
After three years of surpluses, the post office
lost more than $250 million in the fiscal year end
ing Sept. 30, but is expected to be profitable in
1986.
The Postal Service refused to comment on the
management change until a news conference
today. Spokesman Ralph Stewart would not say
whether Carlin, 54, a postal employee since

1969, womd remain with the agency.
On taking charge at the post office on New
Year's Day, 1985, Carlin purchased and sent to
his top employees nearly 13,000 copies of "In
Search of Excellence," the best-selling book on
how to run a profitable and happy company. But
in the year that followed, outside experts say,
Carlin repeatedly clashed with the Postal Service
board over key management issues.
Carlin resisted pressure to decentralize and
slash staffs at the agency's headquarters and its
five regional offices, saying that the changes
would be disruptive. Failure to cut such costs',
critics say, helped feed last fiscal year's $251.5
million deficit and forced Carlin to order a wave
of drastic cost-cutting last summer to avoid a
half-billion-dollar loss.
Carlin has said that the deficit was caused by
delays in approving an increase in first-class pos
tal rates, before he took office.

Other critics say Carlin also wavered over
whether to make an expensive change from
computerized mail sorters that can read only an
envelope's ZIP code to sorters that can also read
addresses.
Carlin stuck with the old sorters, hoping that
customers would begin to use new nine-digit ZIP
codes that would route the mail more efficiently.
But the "ZIP-plus-4" has been a stunning failure
with consumers, and several studies have urged
the purchase of address-reading sorters that
would eliminate the need for the extra four digits
altogether.
"Carlin was faulted by the governors for failing
to master key issues — for not making deci
sions," said Van Seagraves, publisher of Busi
ness Mailers Review, a Washington newsletter
that follows postal issues. "The bureaucracy
there has often favored the status quo, and . . .
in some ways he was a captive of the bureau
cracy. "
