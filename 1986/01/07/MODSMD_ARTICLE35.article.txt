Shuttle Start Delayed
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — For the
second time in 17 days, the launch of the
remodeled space shuttle Columbia was
scrubbed yesterday at the last minute, delay
ing for at least a day its return to space after
more than two years.
A bad switch that blocked closure of a fuel
valve halted the countdown 31 seconds before
liftoff. On Dec. 19, it was even closer, 14
seconds, before a computer stopped the clock
because of a faulty electronic part.
The launch was rescheduled for 7:05 a.m.
EST today.
The crew includes Rep. Bill Nelson, a
Florida Democrat, who will fly as a congres
sional observer in his role as chairman of the
House subcommittee on space science and ap
plications.
Donovan Trial Set
NEW YORK — After more than a year of
pre-trial maneuvering, former Secretary of
Labor Raymond Donovan and nine other men

were ordered yesterday to stand trial Feb. 18
on charges of fraud and grand larceny.
New York State Supreme Court Judge John
Collins set the date yesterday morning follow
ing an 85-minute chambers conference that
defense lawyers had asked be kept under seal.
Collins said that he would also hold a final set
of hearings starting Feb. 10 to assess the
audibility of a key series of FBI tapes that
Bronx prosecutors used in securing the 1984
indictment and that they plan to introduce as
evidence at the trial.
Donovan and nine other men, along with the
two corporations they headed, have been
accused of defrauding the New York City
Transit Authority of $7.4 million on a Manhat
tan subway project that Donovan's company
started in 1978, two years before he was
named to President Reagan's Cabinet.
Judges Walk out
Some of the nation's senior federal judges
— the more than 200 retired judges who main
tain active caseloads to assist an overburdened
federal judiciary — quit working yesterday be

cause Congress failed to act on a bill that would
have kept them exempt from participation in
the Social Security system.
The Administrative Office of the U.S.
Courts in Washington had no immediate count
of the number of judges who declined to hear
cases yesterday, but warned that an extended
work slowdown could disrupt federal appeals
courts nationwide and seriously impede the
work of smaller district courts heavily depen
dent on work by senior judges. Court officials
estimated that senior judges account for 20
percent to 30 percent of the 1,000-member
federal bench.
Stocks Move Lower
NEW YORK — Stock prices posted a small
loss yesterday as hopes for an early resump
tion of the market's 1985 rally went unfulfilled.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
slipped 1.61 to 1,547.59.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
came to 99.61 million shares, against 105.03
million Friday.
