Legislature Convenes
SACRAMENTO — The California
Legislature, returning to the Capitol after a
three-month recess, opened the 1986 session
yesterday with handshakes, a machine failure
and a renewed fight over toxics.
The Assembly met for two hours, half of
which time consisted of closed-door Republi
can and Democratic caucuses.
The state Senate, by contrast, met for less
than 10 minutes and conducted only a few
items of routine business.
To the surprise of Assembly Republicans,
the toxics issue emerged.
The Assembly's final fight before its recess
Sept. 14 was over a bill to reorganize Gov.
George Deukmejian's toxic waste agencies
into one Department of Waste Management.
The bill's sponsor, Sally Tanner (D-El
Monte), rose yesterday and asked for the
defeat of the bill, without identifying it.
Republicans voted no before they realized
what it was, but then the Assembly's vote
recording computer malfunctioned.

Another vote was taken and Republicans
voted for the bill, with GOP leader Patrick
Nolan of Glendale denouncing Democrats for
attempting to avoid a debate on the sensitive
issue.

LOS ANGELES — Condemning Democrat
Alan Cranston as "a rhetorical Rambo" who
talks tough on foreign policy but votes against
defense spending, Rep. Bobbi Fiedler yester
day formally entered the crowded contest for
the Republican nomination for Cranston's U.S.
Senate seat.
Although Fiedler said "very substantial dif
ferences in views" separate hei from some of
her six declared and four still-unofficial oppo
nents in the June 3 GOP primary, she refused
to cite specifics or even mention any Republi
can foe by name, saying the top priority for all
Republicans is to focus on defeating Cranston.
"He's an ultra-liberal who doesn't even rep

resent the Democrat (sic) Party, much less
California," Fiedler said.
But while Fiedler, 48, stressed her differ
ences with Cranston's liberal stands, she also
tried to place herself among the more
moderate Republicans who can attract Demo
cratic votes in a general election.
A year ago, she said one reason she was
considering running for the Senate nomination
was to prevent the Republican Party from
nominating "someone who is too conservative
for the state."
She enters a crowded field of Republicans
hoping to challenge Cranston in November,
joining Los Angeles Supervisor Mike An
tonovich, Rep. Bill Dannemeyer, state Sen.
Ed Davis, economist Art Laffer, state As
semblyman Bob Naylor and Rep. Ed Zschau of
Sunnyvale.
Another four Republicans — Rep. Dan
Lungren, television commentator Bruce
Herschensohn, actor Fess Parker and state
Sen. William Campbell — are also prospective
candidates for the GOP nomination.
