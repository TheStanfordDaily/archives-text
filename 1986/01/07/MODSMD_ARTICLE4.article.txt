# Constitution Placed on Ballot
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Staff writer 
Backers of a new ASSU constitution have gathered
enough signatures to qualify the document for a special
election to be held Jan. 28 and 29.
"We got a total of about 970 signatures," Senate
Chair Carey White said. "Enough of them are valid for
the election to be held." Six hundred and fifty valid
signatures — 5 percent of the student body — were
needed by midnight, Dec. 13.
Also on the ballot for the special election is an
amendment that would allow students to set the ASSU
fees. Under the current constitution, the Senate must
decide the amount of the fees before the annual spring
quarter general election.
The new constitution is designed to make the ASSU
"more efficient," White said. It would divide the senate
into two separate boards, the Policy Board and the
Funds Board. Each would consist of eight members
and a chair.
The division "gives senators job specificity. It allows
people to know who and what they're voting for,"
White said.
The Policy Board would set general policy, focusing
on creating new student services and appointing stu
dents to University committees, while the Funds
Board would control student-group funding, according
to White.
Students would be able to vote for only two candi
dates on each board, compared with the current sys
tem that allows them to vote for up to 10 senatorial
candidates.
The new constitution also will add the position of an

administrative manager, who would help develop stu
dent services and assist the Council of Presidents
(COP) and the boards.
Also, the COP would be reduced from four to three
members. The senatorial board "talked with the COP
and they felt that three could do the job just as well,"
White said. Each member would be assigned specific
tasks. The COP would still be elected as a slate.
COP members Mike Collins, Andy Frisch, Leslie
Leland and Tim Quirk have been working with
senators Jim DeLaHunt, Mary Thurber, White and
Deputy Chair Ed Renwick in order to put the new con
stitution in final form.
"I expect the constitution to pass," White said.
The amendment that would allow students to set
fees states that the ASSU may levy one or more gen
eral fees on students. Each general fee would have an
"explicit statement of purpose" about what the funds
must be used for, according to the amendment.
The amount of each general fee would be set in the
annual spring quarter general election. For each fee,
there would be a list of specific dollar figures and the
voter would select one of the figures. The new fee
amount would be set to the median of the voters' selec
tions.
The amendment will pass or fail independent of what
happens in the constitution election, according to
White.'
The senate board "felt that the (fee) amendment
should be a separate issue," White said. "It has become
pretty controversial."
Also on the ballot will be a constitutional amendment
to change the term of the Nominations Commission,
and an advisory referendum on ASSU divestment.
