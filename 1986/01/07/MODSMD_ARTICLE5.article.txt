# Prof. Weighs Charges Against Card Athletes
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
The University's faculty ath
letic representative said yester
day that the arrests of three var
sity football players on various
felony charges should not soil
the reputation of the Stanford
football program or the athletic
program as a whole.
"It has nothing to do with a
clean athletic program; it has
nothing to do with the athletic
program," Law Prof. Jack
Friedenthal said. "They did it as
individuals. If they're guilty, it's
an unfortunate thing for them as
individuals. I don't think it
changes the fact that the pro
gram is clean."
The three, freshman Sam Sut
herland, sophomore Ken Rich
ardson and junior Wendell
Brown, are accused of stealing a
wallet and checks belonging to
sophomore David Sweeney, a

teammate, and junior Dan Brum
baugh, a dormmate of Suther
land's.
Friedenthal said there is no
relationship between the case
and National Collegiate Athletic
Association rules. "There's ab
solutely zero. It's not an NCAA
violation," he said.
Friedenthal said the fact that
the three are athletes should not
have any effect on the outcome
of University judicial proceed
ings. "I don't think they should
come down any harder on them
than anyone else, whether
they're guilty or innocent," he
said.
Police say the three at
tempted to charge $470 worth of
clothing on Sweeney's credit
card. Brumbaugh said $1,700
was charged on his Visa card and
Sutherland allegedly cashed
$800 worth of his checks.
Brown yesterday declined to
comment until next week, after a
Jan. 14 arraignment in Palo Alto
Municipal Court. He said Richard
son, his roommate, also did not
want to comment.
Sutherland's phone was discon
nected yesterday, and he was not
at home during a visit to his room in
Florence Moore Hall.
Their lawyer, Andrew Parnes,
said yesterday that the three still
planned to plead innocent at Tues
day's hearing. Asked about future
developments in the proceedings,
he said, "It's too early for me to
say. We're going to enter the not
guilty pleas, examine the evidence
and hopefully resolve the matter,
and let the students continue with
their studies."
The students were arrested
Dec. 3 at the Emporium-Capwell
store at the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter.
Sutherland was charged with one
count each of burglary and forgery.
Richardson was charged with one
count each of burglary, forgery, al
tering a driver's license and receiv
ing or possessing stolen property.
Brown was charged with one count
each of forgery, altering a driver's
license and receiving or possessing
stolen property. All are felonies.
Parnes said the burglary charges
were for allegedly entering the
store with intent to commit theft or
another felony, in this case forgery.
. The three also face an investiga
tion by the University on having
violated the Fundamental Standard.
All three face penalties that range
from censure to expulsion, accord
ing to Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole.
.Asst. District Attorney Ron
Rico, who is handling the case, is on
vacation. Deputy District Attorney
Robin Wakshull said that if con

victed of all charges Richardson
faces a maximum of five years in a
state prison, Brown a maximum of
four years, four months, and Sut
herland a maximum of three years,
eight months.
Possible sentences in state
prison for each felony charge are 16
months, two years or three years.
If convicted of more than one, a
suspect would be sentenced on one
count and one-third the middle term
— eight months in this case —
would be added on to that sentence
for each additional conviction, Wak
shull said. •
Wakshull said that lesser
penalties could include restitution,
probation and up to one year in
county jail. She said she was not
familiar enough with the details of
the case to comment specifically.
Bob Beyers, director of the Uni

versity News Service, said three
different processes are involved in
this case — the legal proceedings,
the University judicial investigation
and whatever action the football
program chooses to take.
Beyers emphasized that all three
processes are separate. He said
Cole is responsible for the investi
gation into violation of the Funda
mental Standard.
Football Coach Jack Elway is re
sponsible for determining the
players' standing on the football
team, Beyers said. Sutherland and
Richardson are on football scholar
ships, while Brown is a walk-on.
Elway had said in an earlier state
ment that he would meet with the
players when they arrived back on
campus after winter break. Elway
could not be reached for comment
yesterday.
