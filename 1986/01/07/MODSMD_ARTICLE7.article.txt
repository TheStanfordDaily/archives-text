# Balanced Budget Hits Student Aid
## 
### LAIE CAINDEC 
Due to recent measures by Congress and
President Reagan to balance the federal budget,
students who currently depend on financial aid
may soon find modifications in the eligibility re
quirements for future federal loans or grants.

During the December break, Congress
passed a bill whose effects have financial aid ad
ministrators and federally funded students
worried about the future of higher education.
Soon after Congress approved the bill, President
Reagan signed it into law, confirming many of the
fears preceding its legislation.
The Chronicle of Higher Education reported
that reductions could affect federally funded pro
grams in two ways. The first could occur as early
as March of this year by reducing financial aid
programs by 5 percent, while the second phase
of the bill could lead to cuts as high as 30 percent
by October. These cutbacks could threaten pro
grams from student loans and grants to campus
based research, the Chronicle said.
The effects look somewhat more hopeful,
however, than some of the feared measures
which projected elimination of all federally
funded programs. In fact, students may see in

creases in the size of grants and loans.
The Senate recently passed a measure which
would increase the spending ceiling for
Guaranteed Student Loans to $3.1 billion, adding
a total of $500 million to the authorized limit of
the Housfe bill for the 1987-88 academic year. As
generous as the increase seems, it is still $110
million less than the allotment for the current
year.
The Senate subcommittee also set a standard
for federal funding recipients that would require

loan-receiving students to hnve a "C" average or
better during the years ff r which they would
receive aid. The Senate would only allow excep
tions under abnormal circumstances. The bill
would also disallow Pell Giants to any sti \ nts
whose families earn incomes greater than
$30,000.
The effects of the bill upon both public and
private universities, such as Stanford, will be
seen in March when students may be frustrated
by more than the simple burden of long lines.
