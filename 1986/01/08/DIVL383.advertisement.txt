ISOLVAY AMERICA
Solvay & Cie of Brussels, Belgium, is
one of Europe's oldest and most
prestigious chemical companies with
extensive operations in the U.S. With
sales of approximately $4 billion, it
ranks among the top 25 chemical
companies in the world. SOLVAY
AMERICA will be on campus Jan. 13
& 14 to recruit for a special chemical
engineering training program. The
program entails a brief orientation
period in Houston followed by 3 to 5
years at one or more manufacturing
facilities in Belgium, France, Germany,
or Italy. These engineers will be
returned to the U.S. to work for a
SOLVAY AMERICA company at job
levels consistent with their individual
growth and performance abroad. This
progam is viewed very highly by both
SOLVAY Europe and SOLVAY
AMERICA executives and is designed
to be the beginning of a fast-tracked
career in management. For further
information, check with the Career
Planning and Placement Office.
