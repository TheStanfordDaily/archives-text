# Tenure Suit: Trial in June
## 
### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
The case of Diana Paul, a former Stanford professor
who filed suit in 1984 charging the University with ra
cial and sexual discrimination in denying her tenure, is
expected to go to trial in mid-June, according to Mari
Mayeda, Paul's attorney.
In February 1983, a Religious Studies Department
committee, composed of five tenured men, unani
mously denied tenure to Paul, who is part Japanese.
That decision was upheld nearly two years later by
University President Donald Kennedy, ending Paul's
appeals within Stanford.
Paul's suit asks for tenure or review of her tenure
candidacy. Filed at both the federal and state levels, it
claims there were procedural irregularities in her ten
ure review based on racial and sexual discrimination
and that she was unjustifiably denied access to her
complete tenure file.
Three other faculty members who were denied ten
ure had been granted access to their files, including Es
telle Freedman, who is now a tenured professor of his
tory here.
The files include letters from experts appointed to
review the scholarly work of the person up for tenure.
Paul received only summaries of the letters.
According to English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, Paul's
faculty adviser during her grievance proceedings
against the University, then-Provost Albert Hastorf
said he was following and clarifying a previous policy
when he refused Paul access to her file. No one else
seemed to be aware of that policy, Reb
holz said.
Hastorf could not be reached yesterday
for comment.
The full file is necessary to evaluate the
tenure denial, according to Rebholz.
"We're in no position to judge the fairness
or unfairness of the decision because we
don't have the letters,"he said.
The summaries given to Paul quoted
the letters of the 11 outside evaluators,
but "it was impossible to tell the context
of any of these remarks," said Rebholz.
There is reason, however, to believe
that the summaries are biased, Rebholz
said. One evaluator gave Paul his letter,
and it was found that while some of the
criticism he made in the context of favor
able remarks was included in the sum
maries, the favorable remarks were not,
according to Rebholz.
Efforts to acquire Paul's tenure file are
continuing, according toMayeda.
While at Stanford, Paul "was subjected
to a lot of racist and sexist remarks" and
criticized for focusing her work on
women, Mayeda said.
The Religious Studies Department has

never tenured a women. Two women
who were on the tenure track resigned
before they could be evaluated, according
to Rebholz. Their resignations "indicate
to me that there is a perceived hostility
toward women in that department," he
said.
Paul, hired in 1975, left Stanford when
her contract terminated in August 1984.
The University has not hired a replace
ment for Paul.
"We have reason to believe that one of
the evaluators was being considered to
replace Paul and that hints were dropped
to him before he wrote the evaluation,"
Rebholz said.
Van Harvey, chairman of the Religious
Studies Department, yesterday refused
comment on the grounds that it would be
inappropriate. "This case is in the middle
of litigation," he said. "As chairman, I
really cannot talk about it."
The tenure process begins with a de
partment committee that asks top experts
in the tenure candidate's field to review
his or her scholarly work and submit let
ters of evaluation. All graduate students
Paul had taught, plus all undergraduates
who had taken two or more classes from
her, were asked for teaching evaluations.
Paul was not rated as "outstanding" in
either research or teaching, although she

received a "very good" in the latter. An
"outstanding" ranking is required in at
least one of the categories to receive ten
ure.
Paul appealed to the dean of Humanities
and Science, then to the provost and then
to Kennedy. Her appeal was denied each
time.
Paul's grievance procedure was "a
farce," said Rebholz, explaining that
"everyone in the institution supports the
institution."
The American Association of Univer
sity Women (AAUW) adopted Paul's case
in October 1985, according to Amy
Swauger, the AAUW's assistant director
of program development.
The AAUW is a legal advocacy fund for
women involved in discrimination cases. It
provides direct financial assistance, indi
rect fund-raising assistance and publicity.
"We are unable to provide funds for
I Paul] because we lack the money right
now, but we are helping with fund raising
and publicity," Swauger said.
The National Women's Studies Associa
tion is also sponsoring her case, according
to Paul.
Paul has published three books, includ
ing "Philosophy of Mind in Sixth Century
China" and a book on women and Bud
dhism.

who had taken two or more classes from
her, were asked for teaching evaluations.
Paul was not rated as "outstanding" in
either research or teaching, although she

received a "very good" in the latter. An
"outstanding" ranking is required in at
least one of the categories to receive ten
ure.
Paul appealed to the dean of Humanities
and Science, then to the provost and then
to Kennedy. Her appeal was denied each
time.
Paul's grievance procedure was "a
farce," said Rebholz, explaining that
"everyone in the institution supports the
institution."
The American Association of Univer
sity Women (AAUW) adopted Paul's case
in October 1985, according to Amy
Swauger, the AAUW's assistant director
of program development.
The AAUW is a legal advocacy fund for
women involved in discrimination cases. It
provides direct financial assistance, indi
rect fund-raising assistance and publicity.
"We are unable to provide funds for
I Paul] because we lack the money right
now, but we are helping with fund raising
and publicity," Swauger said.
The National Women's Studies Associa
tion is also sponsoring her case, according
to Paul.
Paul has published three books, includ
ing "Philosophy of Mind in Sixth Century
China" and a book on women and Bud
dhism.
The case of Diana Paul, a former Stanford professor
who filed suit in 1984 charging the University with ra
cial and sexual discrimination in denying her tenure, is
expected to go to trial in mid-June, according to Mari
Mayeda, Paul's attorney.
In February 1983, a Religious Studies Department
committee, composed of five tenured men, unani
mously denied tenure to Paul, who is part Japanese.
That decision was upheld nearly two years later by
University President Donald Kennedy, ending Paul's
appeals within Stanford.
Paul's suit asks for tenure or review of her tenure
candidacy. Filed at both the federal and state levels, it
claims there were procedural irregularities in her ten
ure review based on racial and sexual discrimination
and that she was unjustifiably denied access to her
complete tenure file.
Three other faculty members who were denied ten
ure had been granted access to their files, including Es
telle Freedman, who is now a tenured professor of his
tory here.
The files include letters from experts appointed to
review the scholarly work of the person up for tenure.
Paul received only summaries of the letters.
According to English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, Paul's
faculty adviser during her grievance proceedings
against the University, then-Provost Albert Hastorf
said he was following and clarifying a previous policy
when he refused Paul access to her file. No one else
seemed to be aware of that policy, Reb
holz said.
Hastorf could not be reached yesterday
for comment.
The full file is necessary to evaluate the
tenure denial, according to Rebholz.
"We're in no position to judge the fairness
or unfairness of the decision because we
don't have the letters,"he said.
The summaries given to Paul quoted
the letters of the 11 outside evaluators,
but "it was impossible to tell the context
of any of these remarks," said Rebholz.
There is reason, however, to believe
that the summaries are biased, Rebholz
said. One evaluator gave Paul his letter,
and it was found that while some of the
criticism he made in the context of favor
able remarks was included in the sum
maries, the favorable remarks were not,
according to Rebholz.
Efforts to acquire Paul's tenure file are
continuing, according toMayeda.
While at Stanford, Paul "was subjected
to a lot of racist and sexist remarks" and
criticized for focusing her work on
women, Mayeda said.
The Religious Studies Department has

never tenured a women. Two women
who were on the tenure track resigned
before they could be evaluated, according
to Rebholz. Their resignations "indicate
to me that there is a perceived hostility
toward women in that department," he
said.
Paul, hired in 1975, left Stanford when
her contract terminated in August 1984.
The University has not hired a replace
ment for Paul.
"We have reason to believe that one of
the evaluators was being considered to
replace Paul and that hints were dropped
to him before he wrote the evaluation,"
Rebholz said.
Van Harvey, chairman of the Religious
Studies Department, yesterday refused
comment on the grounds that it would be
inappropriate. "This case is in the middle
of litigation," he said. "As chairman, I
really cannot talk about it."
The tenure process begins with a de
partment committee that asks top experts
in the tenure candidate's field to review
his or her scholarly work and submit let
ters of evaluation. All graduate students
Paul had taught, plus all undergraduates
who had taken two or more classes from
her, were asked for teaching evaluations.
