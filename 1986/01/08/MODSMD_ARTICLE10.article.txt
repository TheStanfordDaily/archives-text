# Earth Sciences Professor Dies
## 
### 
A. Myra Keen, professor emerita
of paleontology and malacology at
Stanford and one of the world's
foremost experts on seashells, died
of cancer Saturday in Santa Rosa,
California. She was 80.
Keen studied worm gastropods
and heart cockles for nearly 40
years as the longtime curator of
nationally recognized
fossil and seashell collections.
The first woman instructor in the
School of Earth Sciences, she pub
lished numerous articles and books,
including "Seashells of Tropical
West America" which covered
3,325 species from Baja California
to Peru.
Because of Keen's international
reputation, the Japanese Emperor
Hirohito arranged to meet her and
discuss his hobby of shell collecting
when he came to San Francisco in
1975.
Keen was born in 1905 in
Colorado Springs, Colorado, and
was reared on a cattle ranch â€” she
never saw the ocean until she was
an adult. She received her bach
elor's degree from Colorado Col
lege and a master's degree from
Stanford before earning her doc
torate in psychology from UC-
Berkeley in 1934.
In 1954, Keen became an assis
tant professor in the Stanford De
partment of Paleontolgy, teaching
popular courses in biological
oceanography and current methods

in paleontology. She became an as
sociate professor in 1960 and was
finally granted full professorship in
1965, at the age of 60.
Her greatest research ac
complishment was the 1960 dis
covery in the Gulf of California of a
tiny green snail known as a bivalve
gastropod, which had been found in
Japan and Australia but never in the
Americas.
Keen received many awards
throughout her career, including a
Guggenheim fellowship for study
abroad in 1964-65 and the pres
tigious Fellows Medal of the Califor

nia Academy of Sciences in 1979.
She also held high positions in a
number of scholarly associations,
including the Society for Sys
temiatic Zoology, the American
Malacological Union, the Pacific
Coast Section of the Paleontological
Society and the Western Society of
Malacologists.
Keen leaves no immediate fam
ily.
A memorial service will be held 4
p.m. Monday at Friends House,
684 Benecia Drive, Santa Rosa.
Memorial services in the Stanford
area are pending.
