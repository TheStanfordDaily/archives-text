# Peace Studies Book Compiled
## 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
In hopes that "Stanford will take
a position of leadership" in the
multi-disciplinary field known as
peace studies, a group of faculty,
staff and students have published a
booklet containing materials gath
ered over a two-year period.
A part of the efforts begun at
Stanford in 1981 to promote
courses, interships and research on
issues related to peace, the 36-
page publication discusses the
emergence in the '80s of peace
studies as a field in universities all
over the country.
"I think we have an enormous in
tellectual deficit in the area of useful
contributions to the literature of
war, peace, conflict resolution and
education," said Lincoln Moses, as
sociate dean in Humanities and
Sciences, in an interview in the
booklet, "Ain't Gonna Study War
No More: On Peace Studies."
The booklet includes interviews
with Stanford faculty, articles on
the nature of peace studies
nationwide and at Stanford, and a
list of Stanford courses considered
to be applicable to the discipline.
The materials were compiled by the
former Student Center for Innova
tion in Research and Education
(SCIRE), a student/community
group called Peace Studies at Stan-
United Campus

Christian Ministry (UCCM) and a
SCIRE task force.
An interdisciplinary course in
peace studies is being offered this
winter for the third time. The
course includes lectures by profes
sors in history, psychology, educa
tion, political science and engineer
ing.
Members of the 1984-85 SCIRE
Task Force on Peace Studies,
members of PEAS and others said
they wish to promote further study
in the field.
"We hope that students and fac
ulty will use our resources (in the
booklet) to plan research, do com
munity internships, develop
courses and design independent
majors incorporating a peace
studies focus, and possibly estab
lish a peace studies major, program
or center on campus," said Judy
Adams, former co-director of
SCIRE and a member of PEAS.
"We hope Stanford will take a posi
tion of leadership in this field."
The faculty group that plans the
peace studies class has been
meeting regularly for informal
peace studies seminars since April
1985, and has recently discussed
the possibility of using their re
search and resources to write a
book.
"At this point, we are moving
into a more research-oriented
phase," said UCCM minister Byron
Bland, a key promoter of peace
studies at Stanford since 1981, in an

interview in the booklet. "There is
a desire to reach out to other fac
ulty and to do some serious re
search. . . . This is an important
step towards entering a real aca
demic arena."
The publication includes a discus
sion of the goals and criticisms of
peace studies programs. Among
the latter are accusations that the
programs are unfocused, un
academic and biased.
In the booklet, Peter Frank,
former Stanford professor of Ger
man studies and current curator of
the Germanic collections at Stan
ford libraries, discusses his own
awakening to the importance of in
terdisciplinary peace studies after
serving with the Nazis in World War
11.
According to Frank, any program
in peace studies at Stanford "should
not only alert students to the im
minent danger of our situation. It
should . . . discuss its causes and
viable alternatives and changes.
This should appeal to the students'
idealism as well as sharpen their
critical sense."
Copies of the publication are
available to academic advisers. Ref
erence copies are available at some
undergraduate departments and the
Academic Information Center. The
booklet may be purchased at the
UCCM office in the Old Union Club
house.
