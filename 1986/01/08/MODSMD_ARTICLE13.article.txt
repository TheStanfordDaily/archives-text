The blood baths in the Middle East have recently
spread to Western Europe. The Palestinian attacks
at the Rome and Vienna airports, which left 19 dead
and over 100 wounded, conjure up visions of Ar
mageddon. Although multilateral economic sanc
tions against Libya may appear appropriate and ef
fective as an immediate response, the ultimate
resolution of the Middle East chaos must involve
direct negotiations involving the United States and
the Soviet Union.
The extent of Libyan involvement in the airport at
tacks has yet to be fully determined. The official
Libyan press agency JANA initially termed the raids
as "heroic," but now Libya has tried to distance it
self from Abu Nidal, head of the Fatah Revolution
ary Council and most likely responsible for the at
tacks. Libyan Foreign Minister Ali Treiki has stated
Libya was "not involved either directly or indirectly
in those regrettable actions, which it vigorously con
demns." Even former national security adviser
Robert McFarlane, who supports U.S. military ac
tion against Libya, admitted that he did not have any
evidence of terrorist training camps there.
However, most would agree that Libyan leader
Moammar Khadafy is a violent extremist who is not
to be taken lightly. He has claimed that his country
is "not responsible" for the "tactics" used by Pales
tinian groups and that it does not harbor terrorists,
though it would shelter Palestinian "freedom
fighters" if the request were made. Moreover, he
has promised to bring the battles to American
streets if his country is attacked.
Such a scenario would be nothing short of disas

trous. Libya and its ally Syria are directly backed
by Moscow and recently received SAM-5 anti
aircraft missiles and other Soviet-made weapons.
The Soviet Union has not been overtly involved in
the Middle East conflict, but Soviet weapons are ap
pearing in the area at an alarming rate.
These factors demand that the path now advoca
ted by Israel's Prime Minister Shimon Peres be fol
lowed. He calls for multilateral actions against the
terrorists without compromising Israeli security or
appropriate punishment for the perpetrators of ter
rorism. Peres stated: "I don't want to declare war
against anybody, against any country. On the other
hand, I say clearly that we are not going to guaran
tee the security of any terrorist, no matter where
he is .... I would rather prefer to start with politi
cal and economic sanctions before turning to arms
directly."
A concerted effort by Western nations to isolate
Libya economically would be a painful strike to that
country because of its dependence on Western
trade. If substantial evidence of Libya's support for
terrorists is found, the West could obtain oil supplies
easily enough from other sources. This opportunity
is particularly viable due to the current decline in the
price and excess supply of oil.
Unfortunately, economic embargos do not affect
the underlying causes of the Middle East conflict.
Only negotiations among the involved entities — in
cluding the Soviet Union — will lead to a lasting
peace agreement mutually satisfying to the Pales
tinians, the Arab nations, Isreal and the United
States.
