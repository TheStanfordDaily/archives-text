# Covert Action Necessary
## 
### 
Covert action. It seems to be a very unpopular term
in the United States — especially on college campuses.
There have been numerous protests in the past of U. S.
involvement in Nicaragua and Angola. In fact, in yes
terday's Daily was a letter denouncing U.S. involve
ment in Angola. We constantly hear impassioned cries
that the United States should not involve itself in the
destabilization of other sovereign countries, Marxist or
otherwise. 1 ( '
The U.S.-supported guerrillas are accused of being
paid mercenaries, committing heinous crimes against
innocent civilians. They are frequently described as
shameful opportunists or the lackeys of some former
"generalissimo" bent on restoring his authoritarian
regime.
One always hears the generic left-wing rhetoric
deploring U.S. involvement in unconventional warfare
abroad. They wish the United States to pursue more
conciliatory policies toward revolutionary governments
and work with Marxist regimes rather than antagoniz
ing them. They strive for a world of mutual cooperation
that will eventually provide us with world peace.
Reality, however, forces us to recognize these
hopes as purely illusory.
First of all, those who are fighting against our
ideological opponents are doing so by choice. These
people would not be fighting if the social and economic
conditions in their countries were worth living under.
They are willing to die fighting rather than live under
militant, oppressive regimes.

The rebels in Afghanistan represent the simplest
case. The Soviets blatantly invaded their country in
1980 and have committed atrocities too brutal to
describe. Nearly everyone involved there agrees that
the United States should assist the guerrillas in Af
ghanistan as best we can. We should, however, make
more of an effort. In the Afghanistan crisis lies an op
portunity to impose a serious blow to Soviet foreign
policy and its world prestige. Dollar for dollar, money
spent aiding the Afghan rebels would be much more
productive than the build-up of our conventional forces.
Then there is Cambodia. That country's communist
government murdered entire cities. The democratic
rebels fighting the Vietnamese puppet regime deserve
anything they want from the United States.
In Nicaragua, most of the guerrillas fighting the San
dinistas were Sandinistas themselves until the ideals of
the revolution were betrayed and a quasi-military junta
was established. Now, Nicaragua has the largest
standing army in Central America, supported by Cuban
and Soviet military advisers. Such a massive military
build-up is destabilizing to an incredible degree and
only worsens Nicaragua's economic troubles. Only
through externalizing their domestic misery can the
current government there maintain its grip on the pop
ulation. Conclusive evidence has also shown that
Nicaragua actively supports the armed rebellion in El
Salvador by supplying arms to the guerrillas there.
This kind of activity cannot be ignored by the United
States. The simplest solution is to remove the cancer
causing trouble. Why shouldn't we assist those who are
fighting the Nicaraguan government?
Angola is a little harder to analyze. The country is a
mess. Guerrilla armies from Namibia and Zaire camp
out in the outlying regions. Guerrillas of the anti
government UNITA force have staked out their own
"liberated zone" in the southeast and have held it

against numerous bloody assaults. The Marxist gov
ernment maintains its control by virtue of thousands of
Cuban mercenaries.
For the first time, the United States is in a position
to support guerrillas fighting Marxist regimes through
out the Third World. Most, if not all, of the Marxist
governments have failed to fulfil even the most funda
mental goals they preached during their revolutions.
In recent years, many Marxist governments have
adopted — if not exceeded — the faults of their former
rulers. Repression is brutal, freedom of speech is often
non-existent and military matters take first priority
over any domestic needs. It would be easy to blame
antagonism by the West for the ills of these countries,
but it simply cannot account for all the misery.
Nations such as Cuba, Cambodia, Nicaragua and An
gola have become heavily armed prison camps. Their
economies would be in shambles were it not for
massive economic assistance from the Eastern Bloc.
Anti-government guerrillas in these countries are fight
ing against the same kind of oppression that Americans
loathe so much. The very least we can do is provide
these people with the means with which to fight their
battle. This means lethal as well as humanitarian aid.
Others say that these battles are not our own and
that we should leave the fighting to those involved. We
are involved. Countries such as Cuba, Angola and
Nicaragua that actively support violent revolution else
where are a direct threat to the strategic security of
the United States.
The United States should use and will use whatever
means necessary — moral or amoral — to deal with
the threat of hostile encirclement. Covert action is
merely a subtle, if amoral, tool to use in the pursuit of
our foreign policy goals. Clandestine activities are
simply too useful to abandon for the sake of a pious,
moral pose. International law and "fair play" are,
simply put, non-considerations in the international
arena that governs the life and death of nations.
As a powerful nation, the United States can afford to
be moralistic at times and to denounce "dirty" means of
achieving foreign policy goals. Yet, if the United States
was faced with a serious threat to its existence, we
would not care by what means our survival were
guaranteed. Clandestine operations and support for
guerrillas fighting our enemies are integral, effective
parts of our nation's diplomacy. In the choice between
survival or morals, nations choose survival. The
United States should be no different.
