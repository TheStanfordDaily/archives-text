## Divestment Requires Pressure 
### 
University President Donald
Kennedy, speaking recently on the
history of student activism at Stan
ford, observed that various ad
vocacy groups have "used" the Uni
versity's susceptibility to pressure
to achieve certain goals. This is a
profound and honest analysis.
Gone is the masquerade that the
Board of Trustees can be per
suaded of the merits of divestment
only by a "rational discourse," and
that civil disobedience and other
such protests will make no differ
ence. So one hopes that the Uni
versity is beginning to admit that
the call for divestment is a political
struggle.
Unfortunately, Kennedy's con
clusions in the speech noted do not
live up to his own analysis. In fact,
he merely replaces one

VIEWPOINT

smoke screen with another. He said
in the speech that because univer
sities must remain sanctuaries for
all opinions, they cannot take any
one political action. This statement
implies that debate cannot prog
ress, but must always discuss the
same issue. Our sense of integrity,
however, should require that we
follow through with action if a con
sensus is reached on this campus.
Moreover, in other matters, the
University itself has taken positions
as a matter of principle. For exam
ple, once the conclusion was
reached that classified research
should not be done on campus, the
University followed through with
action. Furthermore, while the ad
ministration speaks much of the
ability of corporations to play a
"progressive role" in South Africa,
it denies itself that same opportu
nity.
Fortunately, we can pressure the
University to seize this opportu
nity. It is a reality that the Univer

sity will not divest until sufficient
mass pressure is brought upon it to
do so.
First and foremost, the Board of
Trustees largely represents the
corporate community. It is hard for
trustees to divest from themselves.
Furthermore, the political inclina
tions of the board are also not in fa
vor of divestment at this time, as
we have heard from some board
members. We also have to recog
nize that individuals often have little
choice in the matter. Decent people
are commonly instruments of in
decent policies. The president of
this university, for example, is ap
pointed by the board to implement
its policies. It is ironic that individ
uals from the community are more
powerful in the divestment struggle
than many individuals working in
the administration. Community
members have more freedom —
freedom to think and act outside the
margins that others define for them
— than do members of the adminis
tration. This is especially true in the
case of members of the academic
community.
Finally, from the board's actions,
we see that it only responds to
pressure. When the students were
protesting and sitting in front of
trustees' cars last spring, the board
at least felt compelled to issue
statements about the need to con
sider some action against apartheid.
But when direct pressure was
gone, the board no longer con
cerned itself with this matter,
relying on the administration to
convey a passive message that
everything possible was being done
and nothing more was required.
At the same time that we are
trying to change the policy of the in
stitution, however, we can play a
more active role in the struggle
against apartheid ourselves. While
the University is still pursuing a
marginally "constructive engage

ment" policy toward South Africa
by investing in corporations that
invest into apartheid, establishing
closer ties with educational institu
tions of apartheid and even actively
recruiting South African athletes in
spite of international sports
boycotts, we could pursue a con
structive disengagement policy
away from apartheid. This means
supporting the future of South
Africa — the liberation movements
that represent the majority of South
Africans and which will no doubt be
in power within a number of years.
We should work outside the
parameters set by the administra
tion for itself.
In fact, SOSA and other groups
have been doing just this. About a
dozen official representatives of
liberatvvi movements and others
who play a prominent role in the'
anti-apartheid movement have,
visited Stanford in the past few
months. Hopefully more contacts
will be established that will open
new avenues of cooperation, and
the image of Stanford as one of the
pillars of the status quo in South
Africa will be changed. This is
where we should show the adminis
tration the way as well.
There is still a chance for Stan
ford to come out on the correct side
of this issue. The message from
Stanford should be loud and clear:
We will not support apartheid, and
we are looking toward change in
South Africa. This includes divest
ing ourselves from South Africa
related businesses. But whether
the University actually divests will
depend on the ability of students
and other community members to
organize a coherent movement in
order to place pressure on the
Board of Trustees. If the commu
nity leads, the University can be
expected to follow.
