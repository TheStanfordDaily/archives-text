## Visiting Prof. Puts Terrorism in Perspective 
### SCOTT ROTH Staff writer 
Terrorists in the Middle East do
not pose a direct threat to the West
and the United States, according to
Gerhard Botz, a visiting professor
of history, political science and Ger
man studies.
During this quarter, Botz, an ex
pert in fascism who teaches history
at the University of Salzburg, is
teaching History 134, "The Evolu -
tion of Modern European Fascist
Movements," and a seminar,
"Austria in the First Half of the
Twentieth Century." He came to
Stanford as part of an endowed
chair provided by the Austrian gov
ernment.
"It is a chair that the Austrian
government started 10 years ago as
a gift to the American government
for their help in post-war Austria,
especially under the Marshall plan,"
Botz said.
According to Botz, terrorists
operating today have the power to
offend and shock the world, but in
no way can they themselves di
rectly harm the West.
Drawing from his background as
a history professor, he compared
the situation in the Middle East to
the situation in the Balkan states
prior to World War I.
Before World War I, he said,
there were two countries with little
about which to fight. When the heir
to the Hapsburg throne was fchot, it
served as a catalyst to incite many
nations to fight each other.
"The terrorists do not have the
means to destroy any of today's
societies. The danger arises when
the world powers, like the United
States and the Soviet Union,
become adversaries because of
one's actions towards the other,"
he said.
"The danger is that one will act
on behalf of a Third World nation.
The only worry we should concern

ourselves with is the possibility that
a radical faction could get atomic
bombs."
hie added that the West should
not .give in to the terrorists — there
are other ways besides violence to
deal with the problem.
"T he United States is a great
count ry that I admire very much. It
has m '.any great resources. I think it
would be best if they (the U.S. gov
ernme nt) could use them without
going to their last resort. Also, if
the Americans were to act against
Libya, for example, it might solve
the problem there. But what about
the others who will come next, like
Iran? You can't keep attacking
countries," he said.
Botz taught at the University of
Minnesota last spring. Of his con
tact with American students, he

said that he finds them very differ
ent from those of the Au stria/i and
German universities.
"In America, the students are
very inquisitive. They ask many
more questions and voice their
opinions. In Europe, the professors
are viewed as more of an author
ity," he said.
"People in Europe are much
more afraid to ask questions.
Americans are interested in im
proving their knowledge through
their own interest. Also, in America l ,
students are much more active on
campus. I am impressed how they
organize groups themselves."
Not only does Botz enjoy the
American students, but the nature
of teaching and academic life in
America appeals to him. He said he
is aware that American schools put

a greater emphasis on academic
freedom and research than their
European counterparts.
"Stanford, by comparison to
other schools, both in America and
abroad, is a very rich and well
equipped place," he said. "I notice
that since the students pay much
money to attend classes, they
demand a lot from their teachers.
As a consequence, we as teachers
are forced to work harder. This is
good for all."
Botz made the observation that
American universities are some
what more removed from "special
interests" and other outside factors,
which gives teachers more of a
chance to pursue the facts freely.
With the recent rise of neo-Nazi
groups like The Order in America
and the Red Brigades in Italy, one

would think that fascism is on the
rise in the world. Botz does not
agree.
"If you define fascism to be a sys
tem of government run by violence,
propaganda, fear and mass control,
then I don't see any fascist govern
ments on the horizon. In countries
like the Netherlands, Belgium,
France, and even England, where
there was no fascism in the inter
war period, you see more Neo-Nazi
groups.
"One might not like them, but
they shouldn't pose the threat of
bringing down a government. What
one need worry about is that their
ideas will spread and grow in the
same elements that fascism grew in
the inter-war period," he said. "We
should try to keep those situations
from happening again."

Botz said that the freedom of the
press in America can keep a fascist
organization from gaining power.
He noted that the constant infusion
of ideas and publicity makes it hard
for a group that relies on ignorance
to rise to power.
Although Botz conceded that ter
rorism might be the modern equiva
lent of fascism, he doesn't think
that the two are the same. Accord
ing to Botz, the religious dictator
and Libya do not fit the description
of fascist governments.
"The people of these countries
are driven by a combination of reli
gious fanaticism and terrorism. To
me this is not classic fascism. It is
possible, though, that we might
have to consider this a 'new fas
cism.

to rise to power.
Although Botz conceded that ter
rorism might be the modern equiva
lent of fascism, he doesn't think
that the two are the same. Accord
ing to Botz, the religious dictator
and Libya do not fit the description
of fascist governments.
"The people of these countries
are driven by a combination of reli
gious fanaticism and terrorism. To
me this is not classic fascism. It is
possible, though, that we might
have to consider this a 'new fas
cism.

Terrorists in the Middle East do
not pose a direct threat to the West
and the United States, according to
Gerhard Botz, a visiting professor
of history, political science and Ger
man studies.
During this quarter, Botz, an ex
pert in fascism who teaches history
at the University of Salzburg, is
teaching History 134, "The Evolu -
tion of Modern European Fascist
Movements," and a seminar,
"Austria in the First Half of the
Twentieth Century." He came to
Stanford as part of an endowed
chair provided by the Austrian gov
ernment.
"It is a chair that the Austrian
government started 10 years ago as
a gift to the American government
for their help in post-war Austria,
especially under the Marshall plan,"
Botz said.
According to Botz, terrorists
operating today have the power to
offend and shock the world, but in
no way can they themselves di
rectly harm the West.
Drawing from his background as
a history professor, he compared
the situation in the Middle East to
the situation in the Balkan states
prior to World War I.
Before World War I, he said,
there were two countries with little
about which to fight. When the heir
to the Hapsburg throne was fchot, it
served as a catalyst to incite many
nations to fight each other.
"The terrorists do not have the
means to destroy any of today's
societies. The danger arises when
the world powers, like the United
States and the Soviet Union,
become adversaries because of
one's actions towards the other,"
he said.
"The danger is that one will act
on behalf of a Third World nation.
The only worry we should concern

ourselves with is the possibility that
a radical faction could get atomic
bombs."
hie added that the West should
not .give in to the terrorists — there
are other ways besides violence to
deal with the problem.
"T he United States is a great
count ry that I admire very much. It
has m '.any great resources. I think it
would be best if they (the U.S. gov
ernme nt) could use them without
going to their last resort. Also, if
the Americans were to act against
Libya, for example, it might solve
the problem there. But what about
the others who will come next, like
Iran? You can't keep attacking
countries," he said.
Botz taught at the University of
Minnesota last spring. Of his con
tact with American students, he

said that he finds them very differ
ent from those of the Au stria/i and
German universities.
"In America, the students are
very inquisitive. They ask many
more questions and voice their
opinions. In Europe, the professors
are viewed as more of an author
ity," he said.
"People in Europe are much
more afraid to ask questions.
Americans are interested in im
proving their knowledge through
their own interest. Also, in America l ,
students are much more active on
campus. I am impressed how they
organize groups themselves."
Not only does Botz enjoy the
American students, but the nature
of teaching and academic life in
America appeals to him. He said he
is aware that American schools put

a greater emphasis on academic
freedom and research than their
European counterparts.
"Stanford, by comparison to
other schools, both in America and
abroad, is a very rich and well
equipped place," he said. "I notice
that since the students pay much
money to attend classes, they
demand a lot from their teachers.
As a consequence, we as teachers
are forced to work harder. This is
good for all."
Botz made the observation that
American universities are some
what more removed from "special
interests" and other outside factors,
which gives teachers more of a
chance to pursue the facts freely.
With the recent rise of neo-Nazi
groups like The Order in America
and the Red Brigades in Italy, one

would think that fascism is on the
rise in the world. Botz does not
agree.
"If you define fascism to be a sys
tem of government run by violence,
propaganda, fear and mass control,
then I don't see any fascist govern
ments on the horizon. In countries
like the Netherlands, Belgium,
France, and even England, where
there was no fascism in the inter
war period, you see more Neo-Nazi
groups.
"One might not like them, but
they shouldn't pose the threat of
bringing down a government. What
one need worry about is that their
ideas will spread and grow in the
same elements that fascism grew in
the inter-war period," he said. "We
should try to keep those situations
from happening again."

Botz said that the freedom of the
press in America can keep a fascist
organization from gaining power.
He noted that the constant infusion
of ideas and publicity makes it hard
for a group that relies on ignorance
to rise to power.
