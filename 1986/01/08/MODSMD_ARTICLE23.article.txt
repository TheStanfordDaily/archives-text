# Students With AIDS Would Cause No Campus Risk
## 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
Victims of AIDS "do not pose a
health risk to other students or to
employees in the academic set
ting," according to a statement
issued last month by a task force
consisting of members of the Amer
ican College Health Association.
The statement also emphasized
that "the organization and comple
tion of effective educational pro
grams about AIDS" should be "an
activity of the highest priority" for
America's universities and colleges,
observing that such education is of
"paramount importance" in pre
venting the transmission of the
disease.
Among other recommendations,
the task force said that students
with AIDS or AIDS-related
syndromes, and students who have
evidence in their blood of having
been exposed to the illness, should
be permitted to pursue their
studies "in an unrestricted manner
as long as they are physically able

to attend" classes.
The task force based its recom
mendations on available scientific
evidence, which suggests that the
HTLV-111 virus is "fragile" and can
not be spread except through inti
mate sexual contact or exposure to
contaminated blood or blood prod
ucts.
The HTLV-111 virus, which has
thus far killed more than half of the
patients in the United States

diagnosed as having contracted it,
invades the body, neutralizes an
tibodies that try to fight it and
imbeds itself in the nucleus of the
cell. It survives and reproduces it
self by entwining itself in the cell's
genetic structure â€” in effect,
transforming the cell into a HTLV
III factory.
The virus cripples the body's
immune system, drastically reduc
ing its capability to fight normally in

nocuous infections and leaving the
body prone to destruction by op
portunistic organisms to which it
would otherwise be immune. There
is currently no known cure for
AIDS.
The task force emphasized the
narrowness of the possibility for the
transmission of the virus in its
statement, however. "There is no
risk created by living in the same
as an infected person; caring

for an AIDS patient; eating food
handled by an infected person;
being coughed on or sneezed upon
by an infected person; casuai kis
sing or swimming in a pool with an
infected person," according to the
statement.
The task force also issued a pre
liminary statement in October
which said the virus "will not
survive on environmental surfaces,
in the atmosphere, on personal arti

cles or on eating utensils."
The statement, therefore, con
cluded that there is no justification
for separating AIDS patients from
the rest of the student body. It said
that institutions of higher learning
should not require students and
employees to undergo blood tests
for the AIDS virus, ask them to dis
close whether they have been
exposed to the disease or tell dor
mitory residents that someone
living among them has the disease.
The statement also emphasized
the institutional responsibility to
protect the privacy of the AIDS vic
tim, saying that colleges and uni
versities should refuse to provide
medical information about a per
son's condition to anyone without
that person's "prior, specific, writ
ten consent."
The American College Health
Association's Task Force on AIDS,
a group composed of student health
service physicians, university admi
nistrators and representatives of
health care organizations for
homosexuals, spent two months
preparing the statement.
