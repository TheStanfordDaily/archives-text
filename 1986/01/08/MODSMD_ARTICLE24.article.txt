Tumors To Get Heat Treatment
A new technique to measure body temperature,
which would allow doctors to non-invasively treat
tumors with heat, has been suggested by Stanford Uni
versity scientists.
This technique, called microwave radiometry, has
been used by radioastronomers to record tempera
tures of stars. Now engineers want to use it to detect
the small amount of microwaves emitted by warm,
living bodies.
Precise readings of the temperatures within a tumor
would aid the success of a new therapy, called hyper
thermia, which is designed to kill cancers with heat.
The Stanford Medical Center is currently testing hy
perthermia in combination with radiation treatments.
The key to hyperthermia is keeping the tumor
tissues evenly warmed to a temperature a few degrees
above body heat. Present methods using heat are in
vasive, however, hence the need for alternatives.
Dr. Stavros Prionas, research associate in radiology
here, and Dr. George Hahn of the Medical School out
lined the requirements for microwave radiometry in a
recent issue of the journal Bioelectromagnetics.
The Stanford hyperthermia group, of which the doc
tors are a part, intends to develop a microwave ap
plicator that can double as a sensor. The applicator, a
palm-sixed plate with an embedded spiral antenna, will
intermittently scan the temperature of the tumor and
nearby tissue as it delivers warming microwaves.
Electronic circuits will adjust the amount of
microwaves applied, to correct any deviations from the
desired temperature and thus keep the tumor evenly
heated.
Cost of the instrument as yet is prohibitive for

routine clinical use, Prionas said. But he expects the
price to come down, he added, as many of the compo
nents required to detect microwaves within the human
body "are already cheaper than they were a few
decades ago."
Computers Offer Doctors Advice
Artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine — computer
programs that attempt to act as medical experts or
consultants — is likely to begin appearing in clinics
soon.
Stanford, as one of the world's leading centers for AI
research, is spearheading this process.
At the Medical Center's outpatient oncology clinic,
patients with Hodgkin's disease, some lymphomas and
breast cancer, have been treated with the help of a
program called ONCOCIN. The program keeps track
of the patient's progress, advises on laboratory tests
and recommends drug therapies. Since almost no two
cases of these diseases are exactly alike, and since
many of the therapeutic drugs are toxic, physicians in
the clinic generally accept the help.
The researchers are now adapting the program for
the small computers that doctors' offices can afford.
ONCOCIN is perhaps the largest of the medical AI
projects going on at Stanford. However, there are
several other related projects.
A program called PUFF, derived from another Stan
ford AI program, has been actually interpreting physio
logical tests of lung patients at the Pacific Medical Cen
ter in San Francisco. A program to help physicians
evaluate professional journal reports is under develop
ment.

Another program, called PATHFINDER, is an at
tempt to advise pathologists on the proper classifica
tion of lymph node abnormalities viewed under the mi
croscope. This program is being built in collaboration
with the University of Southern California.
REFEREE, a program being written by Bruce Bu
chanan of the Knowledge Systems Laboratory (KSL)
and William Brown and Daniel Feldman of the Medical
Center, is an attempt to try to build an adviser for in
terpreting papers from the medical literature. REF
EREE will give the physician a feel for the reliability of
the data in the reported study.
PROTEAN, developed by Buchanan and Barbara
Hayes-Roth of KSL, along with about 10 students and
nuclear magnetic resonance expert Oleg Jardetzky,
will help researchers determine the structures of
protein molecules.
Student Experiment on Shuttle
An experiment to study plant growth in space de
signed by Chia-Lien Wang, a Stanford undergraduate,
is scheduled to be aboard today's long-delayed space
shuttle flight.
The experiment will examine how plants grow in a
gravity-free environment. The results could help sci
entists better understand how terrestrial plant roots
"know" to grow downward.
One hypothesis is that the plant hormone auxin
becomes concentrated in the downward direction by
the earth's gravity. Somehow, this high concentration
may cause the plant to grow in this direction, explained
Wang.
The experiment involves placing corn seeds, some

that have been germinated before launching and some
that will be germinated in space, in a plastic bag with a
fixative in an adjoining, separate bag. Breaking the seal
on the fixative will arrest all of the plants' growth at the
same time. The behavior of the roots in zero gravity
may help confirm Wang's hypothesis.
Wang's experiment is the result of a contest called
the Student Shuttle Involvement Project (SSIP). She
entered the contest in the fall of 1981 as a senior in
high school.
She was contacted last spring when a sponsor,
Randy Moore, a biology professor at Baylor Univer
sity, was found to help her turn her idea into a practical
experiment.
Miniaturized Page Wins Prize
Tom Newman, a Stanford electrical engineering stu
dent, has reduced a page of text to a size so small that
an area the size of a postage stamp could contain the
text of 1,000 Bibles. He created the technology capa
ble of reducing an entire encyclopedia onto the head of
a pin.
With his accomplishment, Newman met a challenge
with a cash prize of $1,000 posed in a 1960 article en
titled "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom" by
physicist Richard Feynman of the California Institute of
Technology, a 1965 Nobel laureate.
The challenge was "to the first guy who can take the
information on the page of a book and put it on an area
1/25,000 smaller in linear scale in such a manner that it
can be read by an electron microscope," Feynman
wrote.
