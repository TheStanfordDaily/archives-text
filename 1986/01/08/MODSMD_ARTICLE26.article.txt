## Sporting Forecasts For 1986 
### 
As we roll into 1986, many people are looking
ahead, wondering what the new year will hold for
Stanford sports. Some things are a given â€” the ten
nis teams and water sports will challenge for na
tional championships, the crew teams will labor in
obscurity, the football team will play in front of
miserable crowds (except for a sellout at Big
Game). Others we can only guess at. Here goes:
January
Men's basketball team wins five straight Pac-10
games, all by one point, all on last-second shots by
freshman Todd Lichti. Asked about the first-place
Cardinal, UCLA Coach Walt Hazzard says, "There's
no way those guys are smart and can play basket
ball. Something's up." Hazzard later fires the entire
UCLA recruiting staff.

Women's basketball team defeats USC for the
first time since Cheryl Miller learned where the
L.A. Sports Arena is. "I don't get it," Miller says.
"Before, Stanford came out like they didn't expect
to win, like someone told them they couldn't win."
New Coach Tara Van Derveer is named Coach of
the Month.
February
Maples Pavilion sells out for the first time ever for
a wrestling match. Unfortunately, 7,000 leave when
they learn the match is an actual intercollegiate ath
letic event and not a bogus entertainment sham.
One freshman suffers fractures over 90 percent of
his body when he goes down to the mat to yell at
Asst. Coach Dave Schultz. "The kid was screaming
at me that he came to see Hulk Hogan," Schultz
says. The freshman, from the Stanford Hospital,
says, "Dude, this is California. That kind of stuff
probably goes over big in places like lowa and Okla
homa."
Both fencing teams finish undefeated, but their
final home match draws only 11 fans. Sports Infor
mation Director Bob Vazquez resigns in protest
over poor media coverage to become publicity
director for the professional National Fencing
League. "I've always wanted to work for the NFL,"
Vazquez explains.
March
Men's basketball team gets NCAA playoff berth,
but draws Georgia Tech in the first round.
San Francisco Giants owner Bob Lurie announces
that his team will play its home games at Sunken
Diamond. Lurie calls a press conference, and the
announcement is reported across the country.
Asked if the reports are true, Athletic Director
Andy Geiger replies, "No." Lurie cannot be
reached; his secretary mutters something about
Denver.
Men's basketball team upsets Georgia Tech, 121-
120 on last-second shot by Lichti. Card then loses to
Penn as Quakers use slowdown game to run down
the 45-second clock, 38-36, in double overtime.
April
Lurie reaches agreement with Geiger, and the
Giants open the season in front of 1,846 fans at
Sunken Diamond. Lurie says he's pleased with the
attendance increase and not at all bothered by
playing doubleheaders with the Stanford varsity
starting at 6:30 a.m. "It's still warmer than Candle
stick," he says.
Tennis star John McEnroe expresses interest in
returning to play at Stanford, where he left after
winning the NCAA title as a freshman. The NCAA
tells McEnroe he must give them all his earnings as
a professional to have his eligibility restored.
