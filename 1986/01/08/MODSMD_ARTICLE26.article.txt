## Sporting Forecasts For 1986 
### 
As we roll into 1986, many people are looking
ahead, wondering what the new year will hold for
Stanford sports. Some things are a given â€” the ten
nis teams and water sports will challenge for na
tional championships, the crew teams will labor in
obscurity, the football team will play in front of
miserable crowds (except for a sellout at Big
Game). Others we can only guess at. Here goes:
January
Men's basketball team wins five straight Pac-10
games, all by one point, all on last-second shots by
freshman Todd Lichti. Asked about the first-place
Cardinal, UCLA Coach Walt Hazzard says, "There's
no way those guys are smart and can play basket
ball. Something's up." Hazzard later fires the entire
UCLA recruiting staff.

Women's basketball team defeats USC for the
first time since Cheryl Miller learned where the
L.A. Sports Arena is. "I don't get it," Miller says.
"Before, Stanford came out like they didn't expect
to win, like someone told them they couldn't win."
New Coach Tara Van Derveer is named Coach of
the Month.
February
Maples Pavilion sells out for the first time ever for
a wrestling match. Unfortunately, 7,000 leave when
they learn the match is an actual intercollegiate ath
letic event and not a bogus entertainment sham.
One freshman suffers fractures over 90 percent of
his body when he goes down to the mat to yell at
Asst. Coach Dave Schultz. "The kid was screaming
at me that he came to see Hulk Hogan," Schultz
says. The freshman, from the Stanford Hospital,
says, "Dude, this is California. That kind of stuff
probably goes over big in places like lowa and Okla
homa."
Both fencing teams finish undefeated, but their
final home match draws only 11 fans. Sports Infor
mation Director Bob Vazquez resigns in protest
over poor media coverage to become publicity
director for the professional National Fencing
League. "I've always wanted to work for the NFL,"
Vazquez explains.
March
Men's basketball team gets NCAA playoff berth,
but draws Georgia Tech in the first round.
San Francisco Giants owner Bob Lurie announces
that his team will play its home games at Sunken
Diamond. Lurie calls a press conference, and the
announcement is reported across the country.
Asked if the reports are true, Athletic Director
Andy Geiger replies, "No." Lurie cannot be
reached; his secretary mutters something about
Denver.
Men's basketball team upsets Georgia Tech, 121-
120 on last-second shot by Lichti. Card then loses to
Penn as Quakers use slowdown game to run down
the 45-second clock, 38-36, in double overtime.
April
Lurie reaches agreement with Geiger, and the
Giants open the season in front of 1,846 fans at
Sunken Diamond. Lurie says he's pleased with the
attendance increase and not at all bothered by
playing doubleheaders with the Stanford varsity
starting at 6:30 a.m. "It's still warmer than Candle
stick," he says.
Tennis star John McEnroe expresses interest in
returning to play at Stanford, where he left after
winning the NCAA title as a freshman. The NCAA
tells McEnroe he must give them all his earnings as
a professional to have his eligibility restored.

Jill Yanke, a six-foot-five freshman from Boise, Idaho, stabilized Stanford's middle last night,
pouring in 12 points from her center position.
Federal obscenity laws prevent McEnroe's
response from being published.
Lurie threatens to move the Giants to Milpitas
High School after a 6:30 a.m. doubleheader draws
79 fans, while a Stanford game later that day at
tracts a sellout crowd of 3,500. No one carries the
story.
May
Baseball team wins College World Series, scoring
73 runs in four games, including a 23-1 triumph over
Miami (Fla.) in the championship.
Both tennis teams win national championships
after going undefeated. In an effort to restore parity
to college tennis, Stanford is prevented from
recruiting new players for the next two years.
Runner-up USC, which lost both championships 9-0,
denies it is behind the ruling.
June
A major mishap occurs when a Giants game is

scheduled at the same time as Commencement.
Outfielder Jeff Leonard mistakenly appears as the
keynote speaker, despite the fact he has not said a
word in public since 1982. Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev finds himself playing left field for the
Giants for three innings. No one notices.
July
The Los Angeles Times, in a copyrighted article,
publishes allegations that Tom Beckett, assistant
director of athletics for football operations, gave a
dime to a player attending the Stanford football
camp. The player says he was 10 cents short and
wanted to buy a Cherry Coke. The story runs under
the headline "Stanford Coach Buys Coke for 16-
Year-Old Player."
The Times retracts the story when it learns the
player paid back Beckett later the same day. When
contacted about possible punitive action, the NCAA
says it has revoked all credentials for the Times for
the upcoming season.
August
Football Coach Jack Elway announces that he has
redesigned the Cardinal defense for the upcoming
season. The change includes eliminating the position

of strong safety and replacing it with the "studious
clean-cut honest All-American guy back."
September
Football team wins its first three non-conference
games, including a win over Texas where John Paye
completes an NCAA record 43 of 45 passes for 197
yards. Brad Muster scores four touchdowns and
runs for 217 yards on eight carries. Toi Cook,
moved from cornerback to studious clean-cut
honest All-American guy back, intercepts three
passes and is beat for three touchdowns in the 29-28
win.
October
The Stanford-Washington game is moved to a
Thursday night at 8 p.m. in order to accomadate the
Puyallup, Wash., cable system, which wants to
carry the game for subscribers to its sports channel.
"It's really no inconvenience at all," Geiger says.
"Besides, we can use the $5,000 to fund one-third
of a wrestling scholarship."
November
The Bend, Ore., cable network offers $2,500 to
move the Stanford-Oregon State game to a Wednes-
Hav niaht at 11-30 p m. The game is plaved in

Sunken Diamond as 3,600 brave a freezing rain to
see the Cardinal go to 10-0 with an 84-3 rout.
Despite the 0-10 record of his team, California
Coach Joe Kapp says that winning Big Game would
give Cal a winning season at 1-10. It is found that
Kapp actually did graduate with a math major from
Cal. Speaking at a luncheon picketed by a Cuban-
American group, Kapp denies that he will be fired if
he loses Big Game. Cal Athletic Director DaveMag
gard does not deny those rumors.
Stanford rolls into the Rose Bowl with a 105-0
crushing of Cal in Big Game. Kapp accepts assistant
coaching job at Berkeley Junior High School.
December
An incredible recruiting year seems assured for
the men's basketball team as all of the top five high
school players in the nation announce that they plan
to attend Stanford. Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter,
however, admits none of the five. "The athletic
teams will just have to learn that a 3.0 and 1,000 on
the SATs is not good enough, just because a person
is the best basketball player in the country, Fetter
says. Asst. Coach Bruce Pearl's response cannot be
printed.
