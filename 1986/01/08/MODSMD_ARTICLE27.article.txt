# Asforis' 19 Leads Card Past ISU
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
Coach Tara VanDerveer's face was beaming as she
reclined in an empty bleacher.
Only moments earlier, those same seats held a
couple of hundred cheering spectators who witnessed
the Stanford women's basketball team squeeze by the
lowa State Cyclones, 83-82, in a thriller last night at
Maples Pavilion.
"Boy, that was fun! Wasn't it?" she said.
It certainly was.
It was fun watching the furious pace of both teams,
each pushing the ball up the floor whenever it had the
opportunity to do so.
It was fun watching Stanford come from six points
down in the second half to capture its ninth win, match
ing the total victories of last year's team with no less
than half the season remaining.
It was fun watching a tenacious three-two zone
Cardinal defense neutralize Cyclone standout Steph
annie Smith.
But it was especially fun watching Evon Asforis raise
Stanford's inside game to a higher level, something
that Asst. Coach Julie Plank felt the Cardinal needed to
do to be competitive with lowa State.
Only a freshman, the six-foot-two forward played
with the savvy and assertiveness of a seasoned vet
eran. On defense, she dominated the boards and
blocked shots. On offense, she fought to hold her post
position, demanded the ball and hit some crucial inside
shots in the second half when the Cyclones threatened
to pull away from Stanford.
And if that wasn't enough, she heaved perfect touch
down passes in the first half to a streaking Sue Sebolt
who bolted toward the Stanford net whenever the
Cyclones threw up a shot.
Sebolt and her nine first-half points, along with six
five center Jill Yanke, who also produced points from
the posts (eight in the first half), helped Stanford cling
to a 46-43 halftime lead.
From the opening tipoff, lowa State featured a tough
man-to-man defense, but the Cardinal was able to ex
ploit it by feeding the ball to the inside post players,
Asforis, Yanke and six-one forward Kim Mercer.
With the rest of the Stanford lineup shooting a blis
tering 60 percent from the field, the Cardinal might
very well have run away with the contest in the first
half, especially after the 3-2 zone
restricted Smith, the Cyclones'
leading scorer at 18 points a game,
to just three attempts.
This defense forced lowa State's

normal offense out of synch, so it
had to try to shoot over the zone.
Enter five-seven guard Etta
Burns.
Burns ripped down the nets with
some brilliant outside shooting. She
single-handedly kept lowa State
close when no one else could
produce, burying 15 of her 26

points in the opening stanza.
But when five-nine forward
Rhonda Thacker hit soft jumper for
the Cyclones at the five-minute
mark, lowa State held a comforta
ble five-point, 78-73 lead.
Senior Virginia Sourlis led Stan
