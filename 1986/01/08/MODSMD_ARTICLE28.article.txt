# Bird's a Yardstick for Card Hoops
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Staff writer 
This is the first installment of a weekly series devoted to
remembering Stanford athletes of the past. George
Yardley, a student at Stanford from 1946-1950, is the
first Stanford sports alumnus to be featured.
"The boy was so awkward that he had trouble
staying on his feet and sometimes fell down without
anyone being near him. The crowd loved the 'Bird' and
begged (Coach Everett) Dean to put him in just for
good-natured laughs." So wrote Don Liebendorfer of
former Stanford basketball player George Yardley's
freshman year in his book "The Color of Life is Red."
Yardley, however, matured quickly in his years at
Stanford and went on to become a standout profes
sional player in the National Basketball Association.
John Hall, a classmate of Yardley's at Stanford who
now works as a sports columnist for the Orange
County Register, said he feels accounts of the star for
ward's clumsiness are exaggerated.
"He was a little awkward but not that clumsy," Hall
said. "He was sort of a 'Doctor J' type in the way he
would go to the basket."
Hall also said that 6-foot-5 Yardley acquired the
nickname the Bird "because he could soar so high."

Yardley entered Stanford in 1946 along with
numerous World War II veterans, and was unable to
gain a spot on the varsity his freshman year. He made
the team as a sophomore and cracked the starting
lineup the next year, although his season was curtailed
by a knee injury.
Yardley blossomed as a senior and broke Hank
Luisetti's 12-year-old West Coast Conference scoring
record with 237 points in 12 conference games.
Yardley's record, set in the last game of his college
career against Berkeley, was more short-lived than
Luisetti's, though.
The same night Yardley was netting 26 points
against the Berkeley Bears to set the standard, USC
star Bill Sharman was playing against UCLA.
According to Yardley, Sharman heard of the new
mark, and"he went back into the game and scored a
few more baskets. I held it (the record) for about an
hour."
Sharman ended up with 238 points on the season to
edge Yardley by one point.
Yardley, nonetheless, looks back on his Stanford
days fondly.
"I don't think the quality of friendship I had at Stan
ford will ever be repeated," Yardley said. "It was a real
good bunch of guys. It was a very, very uplifting exper
ience. I was fortunate to have a super bunch of people
to be involved with."

Yardley also built a strong basis for his professional
career under the tutelage of Dean.
"Everett Dean had had a number of prior players go
to the pros," Yardley said. "He was a very sound fun
damental coach."
The Korean War temporarily blocked Yardley's path
to the NBA, though. But he was still able to win the na
tional AAU basketball championship with Stuart's
Chevrolet of San Francisco and also cop an interservice
basketball title during a two-year stint in the army.
Yardley finally broke into the professional ranks with
the Fort Wayne Pistons in 1953 and soon earned a
starting berth.
The forward was a prodigious scorer during his
seven-year career and became the first professional
player to score over 2,000 points in a year while break
ing George Mikan's NBA single-season scoring record.
"Breaking Mikan's record was much more important
to me (than breaking Luisetti's college record) at the
time," Yardley said. "I did get my 2,001 point with a
dunk."
After finishing out the 1960 season with the
Syracuse Nationals, Yardley stepped into the business
world.
"It (pro basketball) wears on you psychologically,"
Yardley said. "There is a very fine line between an
emotional peak and an emotional
valley as far as a basketball game is
concerned. It can be very drain
ing."
Armed with an engineering
degree from Stanford, Yardley
bought a small engineering-sales
company and has since turned it
into a business that annually brings
in $25 million.
"I never miss it (basketball), be
cause I enjoy my business so
much," he said. "I was totally
consumed with trying to get my
company off the ground."
Yardley has not strayed far from
the world of competitive athletics,
though, as he plays tennis and golf
in his spare time and is currently
ranked in the top-five nationally in
age-group doubles with his partner,

former UCLA basketball player
Ron Livingstone.
Yardley called Diana, his wife of
33 years, "still my best friend," and
they have two daughters aged 30
and 24 and twin 29 year-old boys.
They reside in Newport Beach.
Despite his success both on and
off the court, Yardley still has not
received the recognition many feel
he deserves for his basketball ex
ploits.
"I still think he's probably the
best basketball player to come out
of Stanford," Hall said. "In my
newspaper career he's one of the
more memorable athletes I've
seen. I would rank him up with
Jerry West and Elgin Baylor in the
way he helped the game."
The gawky Stanford freshman
whom Hall said looked like "he was
6-2 and weighed about 80 pounds,"
has certainly come a long way.

newspaper career he's one of the
more memorable athletes I've
seen. I would rank him up with
Jerry West and Elgin Baylor in the
way he helped the game."
The gawky Stanford freshman
whom Hall said looked like "he was
6-2 and weighed about 80 pounds,"
has certainly come a long way.
This is the first installment of a weekly series devoted to
remembering Stanford athletes of the past. George
Yardley, a student at Stanford from 1946-1950, is the
first Stanford sports alumnus to be featured.
"The boy was so awkward that he had trouble
staying on his feet and sometimes fell down without
anyone being near him. The crowd loved the 'Bird' and
begged (Coach Everett) Dean to put him in just for
good-natured laughs." So wrote Don Liebendorfer of
former Stanford basketball player George Yardley's
freshman year in his book "The Color of Life is Red."
Yardley, however, matured quickly in his years at
Stanford and went on to become a standout profes
sional player in the National Basketball Association.
John Hall, a classmate of Yardley's at Stanford who
now works as a sports columnist for the Orange
County Register, said he feels accounts of the star for
ward's clumsiness are exaggerated.
"He was a little awkward but not that clumsy," Hall
said. "He was sort of a 'Doctor J' type in the way he
would go to the basket."
Hall also said that 6-foot-5 Yardley acquired the
nickname the Bird "because he could soar so high."

Yardley entered Stanford in 1946 along with
numerous World War II veterans, and was unable to
gain a spot on the varsity his freshman year. He made
the team as a sophomore and cracked the starting
lineup the next year, although his season was curtailed
by a knee injury.
Yardley blossomed as a senior and broke Hank
Luisetti's 12-year-old West Coast Conference scoring
record with 237 points in 12 conference games.
Yardley's record, set in the last game of his college
career against Berkeley, was more short-lived than
Luisetti's, though.
The same night Yardley was netting 26 points
against the Berkeley Bears to set the standard, USC
star Bill Sharman was playing against UCLA.
According to Yardley, Sharman heard of the new
mark, and"he went back into the game and scored a
few more baskets. I held it (the record) for about an
hour."
Sharman ended up with 238 points on the season to
edge Yardley by one point.
Yardley, nonetheless, looks back on his Stanford
days fondly.
"I don't think the quality of friendship I had at Stan
ford will ever be repeated," Yardley said. "It was a real
good bunch of guys. It was a very, very uplifting exper
ience. I was fortunate to have a super bunch of people
to be involved with."

Yardley also built a strong basis for his professional
career under the tutelage of Dean.
"Everett Dean had had a number of prior players go
to the pros," Yardley said. "He was a very sound fun
damental coach."
The Korean War temporarily blocked Yardley's path
to the NBA, though. But he was still able to win the na
tional AAU basketball championship with Stuart's
Chevrolet of San Francisco and also cop an interservice
basketball title during a two-year stint in the army.
Yardley finally broke into the professional ranks with
the Fort Wayne Pistons in 1953 and soon earned a
starting berth.
The forward was a prodigious scorer during his
seven-year career and became the first professional
player to score over 2,000 points in a year while break
ing George Mikan's NBA single-season scoring record.
"Breaking Mikan's record was much more important
to me (than breaking Luisetti's college record) at the
time," Yardley said. "I did get my 2,001 point with a
dunk."
After finishing out the 1960 season with the
Syracuse Nationals, Yardley stepped into the business
world.
"It (pro basketball) wears on you psychologically,"
Yardley said. "There is a very fine line between an
emotional peak and an emotional
valley as far as a basketball game is
concerned. It can be very drain
ing."
Armed with an engineering
degree from Stanford, Yardley
bought a small engineering-sales
company and has since turned it
into a business that annually brings
in $25 million.
"I never miss it (basketball), be
cause I enjoy my business so
much," he said. "I was totally
consumed with trying to get my
company off the ground."
Yardley has not strayed far from
the world of competitive athletics,
though, as he plays tennis and golf
in his spare time and is currently
ranked in the top-five nationally in
age-group doubles with his partner,

former UCLA basketball player
Ron Livingstone.
Yardley called Diana, his wife of
33 years, "still my best friend," and
they have two daughters aged 30
and 24 and twin 29 year-old boys.
They reside in Newport Beach.
Despite his success both on and
off the court, Yardley still has not
received the recognition many feel
he deserves for his basketball ex
ploits.
"I still think he's probably the
best basketball player to come out
of Stanford," Hall said. "In my
newspaper career he's one of the
more memorable athletes I've
seen. I would rank him up with
Jerry West and Elgin Baylor in the
way he helped the game."
