# Miami Won't Run Away From Pats
## 
### 
MIAMI (AP) — Some numbers
indicate the New England Patriots
will run into trouble against the
Miami Dolphins. Others indicate
they will run into some wide-open
spaces.
The Patriots have lost their last
18 games in the Orange Bowl,
where they will face the Dolphins in
the American Football Conference
championship game Sunday. The
average deficit was almost 17
points a game.
But the Patriots rushed for more
than 100 yards 12 times during this
season, while the Dolphins gave up
that much on the ground 14 times
and didn't allow fewer than 94 yards
in any game.
"We've been working on our run
ning game all year. I believe we can
run against anybody," said substi
tute fullback Mosi Tatupu.
"Cleveland did a heck of a job taking

the Dolphins apart on the run."
Miami edged the Browns 24-21
Saturday to reach the AFC final but
had its worst day of the National
Football League season against the
run. Earnest Byner led Cleveland's
251-yard ground attack with 161
yards and two touchdowns on 16
carries.
The next day, New England's
Craig James became the first player
to rush for more than 100 yards
against the Los Angeles Raiders
this season when he picked up 104
yards and a touchdown in the
Patriots' 27-20 upset victory. Only
one team during the regular season
gained more against the Raiders
than New England's 156 rushing
yards.
"We knew that if we gained
respect at the line of scrimmage in
running the ball, we could control it
and keep it away from Marcus

(Allen) and have a much better
chance," James said.
New England had the ball for a
season-best 36 minutes, 59
seconds.
The Patriots are bidding to
become the first team to reach the
Super Bowl by winning three road
playoff games. They won their wild

card game ovei UIC i>Cy> ibiU JWM
26-14 Dec. 28 and, after beating
the Raiders at Los Angeles, are
confident they can win in Miami for
the first time since 1966.
"We've won two games on the
road now against playoff teams,"
said linebacker Steve Nelson.
"There's nothing we can't do as a
team."
