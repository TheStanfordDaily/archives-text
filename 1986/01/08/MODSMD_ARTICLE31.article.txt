Todd Lichti, above, has already made his impression on Stan
ford basketball. The freshman leads the team in scoring, with
16.2 points per game, field goal percentage with .559, and in
free throw percentage with .827. Lichti may represent the future
of basketball on the Farm, but the play of seniors Earl Koberlein
and Steve Brown, at right, could determine the team's destiny
this year. Koberlein is second on the team in rebounding, pull
ing down 5.2 per game. Brown, however, has been sidelined
since Dec. 23 with a recurring stress fracture injury. He
averaged 11.3 points per contest in the seven games he
played.
