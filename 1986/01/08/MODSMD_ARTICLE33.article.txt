U.S., Vietnam Vow MIA Search
BANGKOK, Thailand — The United States and Vietnam agreed
yesterday to intensify efforts to resolve within two years the issue of
missing American servicemen and investigate reports that living
Americans have remained in the country since the Vietnam war,
U. S. officials said.
The agreement was reached during a 24-hour visit to Hanoi by the
highest-ranking American delegation to go to Vietnam since the war
ended in 1975. The seven-member delegation, led by Asst. Secre
tary of Defense Richard Armitage and Asst. Secretary of State Paul
Wolfowitz, conferred yesterday with Vietnamese Foreign Minister
Nguyen Co Thach before returning to Bangkok.
"Thach expressed the hope that this question could be resolved in
the shortest possible time frame, even sooner than Vietnam's goal of
two years," Armitage told a news conference here. He said the two
sides had agreed on holding a technical meeting in Hanoi next month,
when the Vietnamese would produce information on 50 Americans
whose bodies have not been recovered. The U.S. side would pro
vide the Vietnamese with further information on crash sites of Amer
ican warplanes, Armitage said.
He said Thach agreed that "multiple crash site excavations" would
be carried out in the future as part of U.S.-Vietnamese cooperation
on the MIA issue. Hanoi reversed a longstanding policy and allowed
American specialists to participate in a joint excavation of a U.S. B
-52 bomber crash site on Vietnamese soil in November. Pieces of
airplane wreckage and some bone fragments were found, but ex
perts doubted whether they were sufficient to produce positive iden
tifications of missing servicemen.
Armitage said the two sides discussed the possibility of establish
ing a U. S. technical office in Hanoi to promote the search for missing
Americans, but that they agreed it was unnecessary at this point.
He said there was no discussion of establishing diplomatic rela
tions between the two countries or of other issues unrelated to the
MIA question.
"The United States welcomes these further commitments to
move forward much more rapidly than in the past to resolve the
status of Americans still missing and end the uncertainty of their
families," Armitage said.
Report Urges Acid Rain Action
WASHINGTON — President Reagan and Canadian Prime Mini
ster Brian Mulroney will be presented with reports today that call for
the U.S. government and industry to undertake a five-year, $5 billion
program to test technology for controlling acid rain, government offi
cials said yesterday.
The report also includes a strong statement describing acid rain as
an increasingly serious problem in Canada and the United States,
without the caveats offered by the Administration in the past that
"more research is necessary" into its cause and effects, officials said.
Moreover, the report reflects a concession from Canada in that it
does not call for specific and immediate reductions in sulfur emis
sions, which Canada has long sought. Officials said the technology
that would be developed in the proposal would, as a byproduct,
reduce the emissions, although the exact amount cannot be
predicted. Canada may seek more specific reductions later, officials
added.
Mulroney's government, which has urged the United States to
take stronger actions to fight acid rain, is expected to welcome the
report. But at a time when deep cuts are envisioned in U.S. govern
ment spending, the $5 billion recommendation could put Reagan in an
awkward position. Reagan is expected to give the report a low-key
response likely to disappoint Canada.
The money would be spent for a commercial project to demon
strate cleaner methods of burning coal in U.S. factories and power
plants.
The sulfur dioxide emissions from such plants, concentrated in the
industrial Midwest, undergo changes in the atmosphere and fall to
Earth as acidic snow and rain, damaging lakes, streams and forests in
the northeastern U.S. and Canada, according to many scientists.
Congressmen Tour S. Africa
PRETORIA, South Africa — Six U.S. congressmen, led by Penn
sylvania Democrat William Gray 111, began an intensive tour of South
Africa yesterday to assess the effects of limited American sanctions
on the country's apartheid system of segregation.
"We must see if the sanctions are working or if they should be
toughened," said Rep. Peter Kostmayer (D-Pa.) when the group
landed at Johannesburg airport Monday night. "We are also here to
express our solidarity with the (black) majority in South Africa and
our sympathy with their aspirations," he added.
The group suffered an early rebuff when their request to meet im
prisoned black nationalist Nelson Mandela was refused. Gray indi
cated that he would renew the request when the group meets Presi
dent Pieter Botha today.
Government officials and businessmen, including many white
liberals, are likely to tell the congressmen that the pressure has
caused attitudes to harden, and that the best way to encourage
change in South Africa, as the Reagan Administration has long advo
cated with its policy called "constructive engagement," is to try to
coax rather than force South Africa toward change.
Most black community leaders, on the other hand, are expected to
argue that the government's response to pressure is bravado and
that only increased pressure could induce white South Africa to aban
don its system of minority rule.
Libyan Missiles Near Readiness
WASHINGTON — Soviet-made SA-5 anti-aircraft missiles being
deployed in Libya are likely to be operational this month, far sooner
than U.S. officials first believed, and another shipment of the long
range missiles may recently have reached the North African country,
U.S. officials said yesterday.
Twelve SA-5 missile launchers are being erected at a fighter air
base on the Gulf of Sidra, which Libya claims as territorial waters but
the United States considers international territory.
From their location at the Ghurdabiyah base, the missiles could
reach targets over most of the Gulf, where U.S. and Libyan forces
have tangled in the past.
When the missiles were first spotted late last year, U.S. officials
said they would probably not be operational for at least a year. Syria,
the only other nation outside the East bloc to have received SA-ss,
spent about 20 months putting them in place.
The Libyans have been working hurriedly to get the anti-aircraft
missiles at least marginally operational and have protected the site
with shorter-range anti-aircraft missiles, officials said.
Deployment of the missiles has increased tension between Tripoli
and Washington, which has accused the Libyans of complicity in
recent terrorist attacks at the Rome and Vienna airports.

He said there was no discussion of establishing diplomatic rela

families," Armitage said.
Report Urges Acid Rain Action
WASHINGTON — President Reagan and Canadian Prime Mini
ster Brian Mulroney will be presented with reports today that call for
the U.S. government and industry to undertake a five-year, $5 billion
program to test technology for controlling acid rain, government offi
cials said yesterday.
The report also includes a strong statement describing acid rain as
an increasingly serious problem in Canada and the United States,
without the caveats offered by the Administration in the past that
"more research is necessary" into its cause and effects, officials said.
Moreover, the report reflects a concession from Canada in that it
does not call for specific and immediate reductions in sulfur emis
sions, which Canada has long sought. Officials said the technology
that would be developed in the proposal would, as a byproduct,
reduce the emissions, although the exact amount cannot be
predicted. Canada may seek more specific reductions later, officials
added.
Mulroney's government, which has urged the United States to
take stronger actions to fight acid rain, is expected to welcome the
report. But at a time when deep cuts are envisioned in U.S. govern
ment spending, the $5 billion recommendation could put Reagan in an
awkward position. Reagan is expected to give the report a low-key
response likely to disappoint Canada.
The money would be spent for a commercial project to demon
strate cleaner methods of burning coal in U.S. factories and power
plants.
The sulfur dioxide emissions from such plants, concentrated in the
industrial Midwest, undergo changes in the atmosphere and fall to
Earth as acidic snow and rain, damaging lakes, streams and forests in
the northeastern U.S. and Canada, according to many scientists.
Congressmen Tour S. Africa
PRETORIA, South Africa — Six U.S. congressmen, led by Penn
sylvania Democrat William Gray 111, began an intensive tour of South
Africa yesterday to assess the effects of limited American sanctions
on the country's apartheid system of segregation.
"We must see if the sanctions are working or if they should be
toughened," said Rep. Peter Kostmayer (D-Pa.) when the group
landed at Johannesburg airport Monday night. "We are also here to
express our solidarity with the (black) majority in South Africa and
our sympathy with their aspirations," he added.
The group suffered an early rebuff when their request to meet im
prisoned black nationalist Nelson Mandela was refused. Gray indi
cated that he would renew the request when the group meets Presi
dent Pieter Botha today.
Government officials and businessmen, including many white
liberals, are likely to tell the congressmen that the pressure has
caused attitudes to harden, and that the best way to encourage
change in South Africa, as the Reagan Administration has long advo
cated with its policy called "constructive engagement," is to try to
coax rather than force South Africa toward change.
Most black community leaders, on the other hand, are expected to
argue that the government's response to pressure is bravado and
that only increased pressure could induce white South Africa to aban
don its system of minority rule.
Libyan Missiles Near Readiness
WASHINGTON — Soviet-made SA-5 anti-aircraft missiles being
deployed in Libya are likely to be operational this month, far sooner
than U.S. officials first believed, and another shipment of the long
range missiles may recently have reached the North African country,
U.S. officials said yesterday.
Twelve SA-5 missile launchers are being erected at a fighter air
base on the Gulf of Sidra, which Libya claims as territorial waters but
the United States considers international territory.
From their location at the Ghurdabiyah base, the missiles could
reach targets over most of the Gulf, where U.S. and Libyan forces
have tangled in the past.
When the missiles were first spotted late last year, U.S. officials
said they would probably not be operational for at least a year. Syria,
the only other nation outside the East bloc to have received SA-ss,
spent about 20 months putting them in place.
The Libyans have been working hurriedly to get the anti-aircraft
missiles at least marginally operational and have protected the site
with shorter-range anti-aircraft missiles, officials said.
Deployment of the missiles has increased tension between Tripoli
and Washington, which has accused the Libyans of complicity in
recent terrorist attacks at the Rome and Vienna airports.
U.S., Vietnam Vow MIA Search
BANGKOK, Thailand — The United States and Vietnam agreed
yesterday to intensify efforts to resolve within two years the issue of
missing American servicemen and investigate reports that living
Americans have remained in the country since the Vietnam war,
U. S. officials said.
The agreement was reached during a 24-hour visit to Hanoi by the
highest-ranking American delegation to go to Vietnam since the war
ended in 1975. The seven-member delegation, led by Asst. Secre
tary of Defense Richard Armitage and Asst. Secretary of State Paul
Wolfowitz, conferred yesterday with Vietnamese Foreign Minister
Nguyen Co Thach before returning to Bangkok.
"Thach expressed the hope that this question could be resolved in
the shortest possible time frame, even sooner than Vietnam's goal of
two years," Armitage told a news conference here. He said the two
sides had agreed on holding a technical meeting in Hanoi next month,
when the Vietnamese would produce information on 50 Americans
whose bodies have not been recovered. The U.S. side would pro
vide the Vietnamese with further information on crash sites of Amer
ican warplanes, Armitage said.
He said Thach agreed that "multiple crash site excavations" would
be carried out in the future as part of U.S.-Vietnamese cooperation
on the MIA issue. Hanoi reversed a longstanding policy and allowed
American specialists to participate in a joint excavation of a U.S. B
-52 bomber crash site on Vietnamese soil in November. Pieces of
airplane wreckage and some bone fragments were found, but ex
perts doubted whether they were sufficient to produce positive iden
tifications of missing servicemen.
Armitage said the two sides discussed the possibility of establish
ing a U. S. technical office in Hanoi to promote the search for missing
Americans, but that they agreed it was unnecessary at this point.
He said there was no discussion of establishing diplomatic rela
tions between the two countries or of other issues unrelated to the
MIA question.
"The United States welcomes these further commitments to
move forward much more rapidly than in the past to resolve the
status of Americans still missing and end the uncertainty of their
families," Armitage said.
