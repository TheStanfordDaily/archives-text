## Reagan Declares Sanctions Against Libya 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan,
denouncing Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy as
"a pariah in the world community" for his sup
port of terrorism, yesterday directed U.S. com
panies to break off all economic dealings with it
or face criminal prosecution by the United
States. Reagan also ordered all Americans to
leave the North African country.
Reagan urged Western allies to join this
country in imposing economic sanctions against
Libya. However, other countries so far have
refused to do so, and the president acknowl
edged that economic realities in some allied na
tions may make it impractical for them to act.
The president said that his order imposing
sanctions, some of which take place immediately
and others no later than Feb. 1, will create a
total ban on direct import and export trade with
Libya, except for humanitarian purposes. Com
mercial contracts and other transactions with
Libya including travel-related activities other
than those needed for journalism or to carry out
the president's order, are prohibited.
In a toughly worded statement at the outset of
a nationally televised news conference, the pres
ident declared a "national emergency" to deal
with what he called a threat to U.S. security

posed by Libya's actions. He also cited what he
termed "irrefutable evidence" of Khadafy's in
volvement in the Dec. 27 terrorist attacks on air
ports in Rome and Vienna in which 15 travelers,
including five Americans, were killed.
Reagan declared that direct responsibility for
the terrorist acts "lies squarely" with the radical
Palestinian leader Abu Nidal and his organiza
tion.
"We shall make every effort to bring Abu Nidal
and other terrorists to justice," said Reagan.
"But these murderers could not carry out their
crimes without the sanctuary and support pro
vided by regimes such as Col. Khadafy's in
Libya."
Khadafy has conceded that Abu Nidal has been
in Libya, but has denied supporting any terrorist
acts by the Palestinian and has denied any per
sonal involvement in the attacks in Rome and
Vienna.
When reporters pressed Reagan on what he
called "irrefutable evidence," he said, "I can
assure you we have the evidence." But he
declined to discuss the matter in detail, implying
that to do so might compromise U. S. intelligence
sources and methods.
Ordering Americans to leave a foreign country

is considered highly unusual action for a presi
dent and underscores the depth of the Adminis
tration's feelings. A senior Administration official
said that Reagan's executive order carrying out
the new sanctions effectively prevents
Americans from living in Libya legally because it
bans such routine commercial transactions as
paying rent or buying groceries.
In his statement, Reagan warned that
Americans living in Libya who violate his orders
barring economic activities "should know that
they will be subject to appropriate penalties upon
their return to the United States."
Reagan, noting that Khadafy had called the
Rome and Vienna terrorist attacks "heroic acts,"
declared, "I call them criminal outrages by an
outlaw regime. By providing material support to
terrorist groups which attack U.S. citizens,
Libya has engaged in armed aggression against
the U. S. under established principles of interna
tional law, just as if it had used its own armed
forces."
Meanwhile, the recent movement of U.S.
ships off the Libyan coast has fed speculation
that this country might be considering launching
an attack on Libya in retaliation for the Rome and
Vienna attacks.
