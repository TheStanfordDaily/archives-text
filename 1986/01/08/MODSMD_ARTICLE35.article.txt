# Leaves optimistic about farmers' future
## Block Resigns as Agriculture Secretary 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Agriculture
Secretary John Block, the lightning
rod for criticism of Reagan Adminis
tration farm policies during the
worst economic crisis to hit rural
America since the Depression, an
nounced yesterday that he will
resign in mid-February.
Citing the recently enacted five
year farm program as the last major
goal that he had hoped to ac
complish, the Illinois hog farmer

said that he wanted to pursue
"new, exciting possibilities," which
he declined to discuss.
Speculation on a successor im
mediately centered on Deputy Sec
retary John Norton, a wealthy
Arizona farmer close to President
Reagan's inner circle, and Richard
Lyng, a former deputy secretary
who served as state agriculture
director when Reagan was gover
nor of California.

Lyng, reportedly Reagan's
original choice for secretary of
agriculture in 1981, is now a private
agricultural consultant here.
Block, 50, "thinks the farm bill
achieved some of the reforms he
sought, and he feels he is leaving on
the crest of a wave instead of the
trough," he said.
Block is widely regarded as a
personable, solid team player who
strongly supported White House ef

forts to phase out 50 years of gov
ernment crop subsidies and farm
production controls.
At his news conference, Block
predicted that agriculture was
"starting to turn the corner" but he
acknowledged there still were
"stressful times ahead of us."
Block said that he did not think
that his resignation is "going to
have any impact at all on the 1986
elections."
