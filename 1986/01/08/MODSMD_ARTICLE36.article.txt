U.S. Arms to Saudis?
WASHINGTON — Despite strong opposi
tion by pro-Israeli lawmakers, President
Reagan will ask Congress later this month to
approve the sale of more than $1 billion in arms
to Saudi Arabia, Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.)
said yesterday. Cranston, who vowed to
lead the opposition to the Saudi sale, said that
the Administration was erring by requesting it
at the same time that Congress is poised to
deny a similar sale of $1.9 billion in advanced
arms to Jordan.
But congressional sources predicted that
the Administration would soon withdraw the
Jordanian proposal rather than suffer an em
barrassing defeat.
In the Saudi deal, Cranston said, the Admin
istration will seek permission to sell the Riyadh
government 1,600 Sidewinder missiles at a
cost of $160 million; 800 Stinger missiles, $85
million; 12 Blackhawk helicopters, $250 mil
lion; 90 harpoon ship-to-ship missiles, $100
million; and advanced equipment for F-15 and
F-5 aircraft, $450 million.
Administration officials acknowledged yes
terday that a Saudi proposal is being drafted
but declined to confirm the specifics of the pro
posal as outlined by Cranston, who said that he
expected notification of the intended sale to
reach Congress when it reconvenes Jan. 21.
"I'm going to be leading the fight against this
sale," Cranston said. "Saudi Arabia is still

bankrolling the PLO and Syria — the protec
tors of terrorists who have murdered
Americans and torn Lebanon asunder. Saudi
Arabia has frustrated the fitful efforts of King
Hussein to move forward in the peace process
with Israel."
Cranston noted that in 1981, when Reagan
won congressional approval to sell the Saudis
an AWACS spy plane, the president said that
future deliveries would take place only "if in
itiatives of the peaceful resolution of disputes
in the region have either been successfully
completed or significant progress toward that
goal has been accomplished with the substan
tial assistance of Saudi Arabia."
"Clearly," the senator added, "none of
these conditions have been met. The Saudis
maintain a state of war with Israel, push the
boycott and do not recognize Israel's right to
exist."
Court Protest Spreads
A work stoppage by senior federal 'judges,
protesting Congress' failure to re-enact their
exemption from the Social Security system,
spread across the nation yesterday, delaying
proceedings and forcing a scramble by court
administrators to keep calendars from collaps
ing.
In the U.S. District Court in Albany, N.Y.,
all proceedings halted as two senior judges —
who were handling the court's full caseload be

cause two active judgeships are vacant —
declined to work.
"The only thing they could do is blow up the
courthouse to put it in worse shape," said Dis
trict Court Clerk Joseph Scully.
Shuttle Still Stalled
Bad weather at emergency-landing sites in
Spain and Senegal yesterday scrubbed the
launch of the space shuttle Columbia for the
fourth time in the last 20 days, a record num
ber of postponements for a shuttle flight and
one that casts doubt about the space agency's
ability to launch the 15 shuttle flights now
scheduled for 1986.
Columbia's launch from Florida's Kennedy
Space Center was rescheduled for tomorrow
morning but the four delays in getting off the
ground appeared to be getting on the crew's
nerves.
Stock Market Climbs
NEW YORK — The stock market charged
upward yesterday, with stock prices reaching
record levels on several Wall Street
barometers as the market's historic 1985 rally
continued into the new year with vigor.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
rose 18.12 to a record 1,565.71, shattering
the old high of 1,553.10 set on Dec. 16.
