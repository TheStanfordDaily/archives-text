Tanker Wreck on 101
SAN FRANCISCO — A gasoline truck
driver told authorities he blacked out moments
before his tanker hit a guardrail in a fiery
wreck that stalled thousands of commuters,
delayed flights at San Francisco International
Airport and spewed acrid black smoke into the
sky yesterday morning.
The blazing tide of gasoline melted
guardrails and a wide strip of pavement across
six lanes of Highway 101, said California High
way Patrol spokesman Gary Loo. There were
no injuries.
The flames were allowed to burn unchecked
in the southbound lanes for almost four hours
until an airport fire truck extinguished the fire
with foam. The truck was destroyed and
blackened chunks of metal were strewn
around the scene.
Two northbound lanes were reopened about
five hours after the crash, and two southbound
transition lanes from onramps were opened a
short time later, officials said.
The Arco tanker, loaded with 8,800 gallons

of three grades of gasoline, jacknifed and
caught fire at 5:55 a.m. ..Hours later, traffic
remained snarled around the busy airport and
motorists stewed in a bumper-to-bumper
mess extending almost 15 miles south on
nearby Interstate 280.
Driver Stephen Michael Raigle, 31, of South
San Francisco, said he got dizzy and blacked
out seconds before the accident, said Loo.
Raigle had picked up a load at Brisbane and
was headed for Foster City.
Strike Snarls Schools
OAKLAND — The school day was shor
tened in the Oakland Unified School District
yesterday, the second day of a teachers' strike
that has kept at least two-thirds of the stu
dents away from class.
All but 500 of the Oakland Education Associ
ation's 3,500 teacher members honored picket
lines in California's fifth-largest school district
on Monday.
Student attendance dropped from the regu
lar 51,000 to 16,000 on Monday.

The strike crippled the district's 91 schools,
leaving substitute teachers and administrators
manning classes ending by 2 p.m.
Both sides predicted a lengthy walkout —
the third since 1977 — in the dispute over
teachers' salaries. Union leaders want pay
boosted to the average paid in the state's 20th
biggest school districts.
Police Chief Retires
SAN FRANCISCO — Police Chief Cor
nelius Murphy will retire Jan. 16 after six years
in office, Mayor Dianne Feinstein announced

would start his new job when Murphy leaves.
Murphy, 56, began his career with the police
department in 1952 as a patrolman. He served
