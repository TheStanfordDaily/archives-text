# Senior Perkins Files Claim Against University, Police
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
Senior Robby Perkins, who has alleged he
was beaten by police after being arrested at
an October anti-apartheid protest in Old
Union, said yesterday he has filed a $600,100
claim against the University, the Stanford
Police Department, the County of Santa
Clara and the Santa Clara County Sheriffs
Department.
Two other students arrested at the
protest, Kaylen Worth and David Potter, are
also planning to file claims. Peter Heslin said
he is considering filing.
Worth is one of eight students who pleaded
no contest yesterday to a single mis
demeanor in a hearing before Judge Stephen
Manley for the protesters arrested at the Oc
tober sit-ins. Twelve others, including ASSU
Council of Presidents (COP) member Tim
Quirk and Statistics Prof. Charles Stein will
undergo a jury trial beginning Jan. 27.
Perkins charges in his claim that the ar
resting officer's use of the compliance-pain
hold "constituted excessive, unreasonable,
unnecessary and unlawful force by the Stan
ford campus police." He also claims that he
was "placed in isolation, strip searched and
beaten" after being transferred to a San Jose
jail facilitv
Should the parties mentioned in the claim
refuse to pay the damages sought by Perkins,
he would have the option of filing a law suit.
Both Worth and Potter will seek $100,000

in total damages, according to Worth. Heslin
has said he probably would seek $1 in dama
ges if he does file. "If Kennedy would just
apologize that would be enough," he said.
Perkins and Worth agreed with Heslin that
money is not the issue, adding that they will
donate any money they receive to the Coali
tion against Police Brutality, peaceful protest
groups in South Africa or some other
charitable organization.
"I don't want this blood money," Perkins
said.
Among the individuals listed in Perkins'
claim as responsible for "causing injuries" are
University President Donald Kennedy, Stan
ford Police Chief Marvin Herrington and Sgt.
Nick Brunot. Perkins said Kennedy is re
sponsible for the actions of University
employees.
Stanford has not received notice of the
claim, and any future action will depend on the
nature of the charges, according to the Office
of the Vice President and General Counsel.
The four protesters consulted the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in San
Francisco about the situation before taking
action, according to Worth. ACLU lawyer Ed
Chen helped them draft the claims and
advised them on the standard amount of da
mages sought in cases of brutality.
The ACLU has not decided whether or not
it will take the case in the event the damages
are not paid, Worth said.
If the parties named in the claim refuse to
pay and the ACLU decides not to take the
case, the next step is uncertain, he said.
The decision to continue with the cases
would depend in part on their ability to pay
a private lawyer, according to Worth. "It
may prove impossible," he added.
Worth and the other protesters knew
what their sentences would be before
they agreed to plead no contest at yester
day's hearing.

The district attorney's office had said
that if the defendants pleaded no contest
to one charge, the others would be
dropped. The charges, all misdemeanors,
included trespassing and failure to dis
perse from an unlawful assembly.
Seven of the eight students who ac
cepted the district attorney's offer
yesterday were sentenced to one year of
probation and 40 hours of community ser
vice, to be completed by May 30. The
eighth defendant, who received the same
sentence, requested that he be allowed to
perform his community service over the

summer. That request was granted.
The twelve who chose not to accept the
offer will take their cases to a jury trial in
San Jose on Jan. 27.
Three students in the group — Eric
Diesel, Brad Hightower and David Romo
— have decided to represent themselves.
COP member Andy Frisch, who only
recently was found financially eligible for a
public defender, will appear with his new
defender at another hearing on Jan. 15.
The trial is scheduled for a San Jose
court because the Palo Alto courts are
overloaded, according to Manley.

perse from an unlawful assembly.
Seven of the eight students who ac
cepted the district attorney's offer
yesterday were sentenced to one year of
probation and 40 hours of community ser
vice, to be completed by May 30. The
eighth defendant, who received the same
sentence, requested that he be allowed to
perform his community service over the

summer. That request was granted.
The twelve who chose not to accept the
offer will take their cases to a jury trial in
San Jose on Jan. 27.
Three students in the group — Eric
Diesel, Brad Hightower and David Romo
— have decided to represent themselves.
COP member Andy Frisch, who only
recently was found financially eligible for a
public defender, will appear with his new
defender at another hearing on Jan. 15.
The trial is scheduled for a San Jose
court because the Palo Alto courts are
overloaded, according to Manley.
