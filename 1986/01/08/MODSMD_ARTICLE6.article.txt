# Comp. Sci. Dept. Approves New Major
## 
### KELLY SUND Staff writer 
The faculty of the Computer Science
Department yesterday afternoon unani
mously approved a motion to create an
undergraduate major in computer sci
ence.
The motion called for the department
to "adopt an experimental undergradu
ate major" and suggested that "to assure

the high quality of the program, enroll
ment should be limited by the resources
available."
The proposed major has already been
accepted by the School of Engineering,
but still must be approved by the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies and
the Faculty Senate.
The major is expected to receive the
committee's approval, according to
Stuart Reges, assistant chairman of the
Computpr Science Department. Reges

said he hopes the major will be offered
next fall.
Students who completed the pro
posed major would receive a bachelor of
science degree in computer science.
According to Reges, the tentative
form of the new major calls for the com
pletion of 94 units: 12 units of science,
28 units of math, 10 units of engineering
basics and 44 units of computer science.
The core of the program will be the

C.S. 108 sequence, which can be started
in the fall or spring.
New computer science classes are
being created, and some old ones are
being revised to fit the undergraduate
major, since the current computer sci
ence classes were designed primarily for
graduate students.
Students interested in more informa
tion should stop by the Computer Sci
ence Department and sign a mailing list,
according to Reges.
