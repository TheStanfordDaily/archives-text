### MORTY POSNER 
The Hoover Institution Library and Archives, in
cooperation with the School of Humanities and
Sciences, has acquired the extensive manuscript col
lection and library of Glen Struve, an internationally
recognized authority on 20th-century Russian
literature.
Struve, who was a professor of Slavic languages and
literatures at UC-Berkeley, corresponded with many
literary and revolutionary figures following the 1917
Bolshevik Revolution. He emigrated from Russia in
1918 and died last year at the age of 88.
According to Hoover Institution Senior Research
Fellow John Dunlop, an expert on Soviet affairs, the
collection is made up of two parts. Struve's
manuscripts and letters will be available for study at
the Hoover Archives, and his extensive collection of

signed works of poetry will be housed at Green Li
brary.
"Because Struve carried on a voluminous and daily
correspondence with major Soviet dissidents and
emigre leaders in the past half century, his papers will
support research on a wide range of subjects," Dunlop
said.
Included in the more than 100 linear feet of archival
material are correspondence with Nobel laureates Al
exander Solzhenitsyn and Ivan Bunin, novelist Vladimir
Nabokov, revolutionary leader Alexander Kerensky
and English writer George Orwell.
Lazar Fleishman, a professor of Slavic languages and
literature here, told the University News Service the
collection includes documents "pertaining to behind
the-scenes literary activity in the post-war Soviet soci
ety and the dissident movement in the U.S.S.R."
Struve authored texts on the emigre literary move
ment and the history of Soviet literature that are still
considered standard works in the literary field.
