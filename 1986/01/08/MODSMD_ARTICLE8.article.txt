# Bowl Games Score Budget Points

Most college football fans took advantage of
the past month's abundance of holiday bowl
games to sit back, quaff a beer and cheer for
their favorite team.
But for athletic directors around the country,
the bowl season was a time to lick their col-

lective chops in anticipation of the revenues
coming to their team, or conference, as a / suit of
bowl participation.
The 36 teams which played in the 18 bowl
games between Dec. 14 and Jan. 1 earned ap
proximately $41 million, according to an article in
The Chronicle of Higher Education.
However, the 36 teams that actually played in
the games aren't the only ones that will share the
bounty. Most athletic conferences have systems
for dividing bowl receipts among all the members
of the conference, so the post-bowl trickle-down
reaches even teams in the conference cellar.
In the Pac-10 Conference, of which Stanford is
a member, that trickle-down becomes a flood.
The size of bowl-game purses varies widely,
and the Rose Bowl, pitting the champions of the
Pac-10 and Big-10, is by far the richest bowl.

This bowl pays each participating team an esti
mated $6 million.
As a result, the 20 schools in the Pac-10 and
Big-10 should each receive $600,000 from the
Rose Bowl alone. Both conferences also fielded
participants in several other bowls, guaranteeing
even more income to their member schools.
Purses in the other bowls ranged from the
$100,000 awarded each team in the California
Bowl to the $2.25 million given to Orange Bowl
participants.
Independent bowl teams — that is, teams that
don't belong to any conference at all — usually
receive the biggest bowl stipends.

Pennsylvania State University, for example,
will receive more than $2 million for its New
Year's Day play in the Orange Bowl, and the
University of Miami will garner a comparable
amount for its appearance in the Sugar Bowl.
Bowling Green State University in Bowling
Green, Ohio, was not so lucky. As the team
traveled to Fresno, California to play in the Cali
fornia Bowl, officials were hoping that the puny
$100,000 stipend they expected to receive
would cover the team's travel expenses.
There was some fear that the team would not
break even in its bowl appearance.
