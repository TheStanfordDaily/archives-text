Stanford alumni will be booking
passage on the first charter flight
into space, scheduled for 1992.
The trip promises to be "nothing
short of the ultimate travel experi
ence," according to Peter Voll,
director of travel/study programs
for the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion.
The price tag for this travel ex
clusive will be $50,000 per person.
The trip will include a three- to
four-day training period, the 8- to
12-hour low earth orbit flight, and a
rest period and debriefing at the
conclusion of the trip.
The 20-member charter group
will consist of 18 paying passengers
and two invited guides to enrich the
educational experience for the
group.
"We would be honored if Sally
Ride would be one of our guides,"
Voll said. Ride, a Stanford alumna,
was the first woman astronaut in
the United States' space progam.
The craft to be used is called the
PHOENIX E and is being
developed by Pacific American
Launch Systems of Redwood City.
The chief creator in the project is
Maxwell Hunter 11, a veteran aero
space designer who worked on the
first NASA shuttle.
The $280 million program, called
Project Space Voyage, has been
promoted by Society Expeditions of
Seattle rmd » iwh> it»
first voyage on Oct. 12, 1992, the
500 th year anniversary of the dis
covery of the New World by Chris
topher Columbus.
Because the first charter flight
will be filled with alumni, Voll, a
1965 Stanford graduate, favors a
March 9 liftoff to commemorate
Founders Day at Stanford.
The alumni association does not
plan to make more than a marginal
profit from the charter trip. The
travel/study trips are created "to
take the superstars of the Stanford
faculty and put them in areas where
they have expertise, so they can
enrich the experience of the
alumni," according to Voli.
Because the demand for seats on
the charter flight vastly outweighs
the availability, the competition for
the program promises to be in
tense. The opportunity will be of
fered first to lifetime members of
the alumni association who have
traveled regularly with the
travel/study programs. Major
donors and outstanding volunteers
will be given secondary considera
tions, according to Voll.
Lifetime members of the alumni
association (including students) can
get in the running for a spot on the
charter flight simply by putting
down a refundable deposit.
Society Expeditions is planning
25 trips in the first year of the
shuttle's operation and an increas
ing number in the following years.
The shuttle will stand 57 feet tall.
The 20-foot cabin will be wider than
that of a jumbo jet. Seats will be ar
ranged so that each passenger is
facing a window.
Drawings of the shuttle as well as
the cabin design appear in the color
brochure distributed by Society Ex
peditions. The travel folder con
tains information on the orientation
and briefing period as well as the
itinerary and the cost of Project
Space Voyage. It details other in
formation such as meals, flight and
ground accomodations and special
clothing requirements.
The Stanford Alumni Association
offers other innovative travels.
Next December, the group will
sponsor an expedition to the An
tarctic led by University President
Donald Kennedy. In April, a South
Seas trip is planned.
