## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper ASSU Inquiry Needed 
### 
We are disturbed by University President Donald
Kennedy's recent policy flip-flop regarding an ASSU
inquiry into alleged police brutality on campus.
In a Nov. 11 KZSU program, Kennedy pledged to
"cooperate in any way we can" with the ASSU Sen
ate's independent investigation of the events sur
rounding the Oct. 11 sit-in arrests.
Then, in a letter dated Dec. 11, Kennedy
rejected the investigating committee's idea of ap
pointing an external investigator to look into the
matter, calling it unnecessary and inappropriate fol
lowing an inquiry directed by Law Prof. John
Kaplan.
Kennedy said Kaplan's report included no per
sonal bias, was conducted independently of the Uni
versity administration and excluded no relevant in
formation.
But even a perceived bias is enough to lessen the
usefulness of the Kaplan report. Many members of
the Stanford community still wonder if the police of
ficers involved should be punished, and it seems
reasonable to conclude that only an investigator

completely unattached to this institution could pro
vide a satisfactory answer.
If one leaves aside the issue of potential bias, at
least one major issue remains uninvestigated: Stan
ford senior Robby Perkins claims he was strip
searched and beaten during his stay in the North
County Jail and, to date, no one has looked into the
matter.
Kaplan's own report states that Perkins
"emerged with a considerable number of (bruises)
. . . certainly consistent with his having received an
unlawful beating," and Kaplan admits that he was
"unable to find precisely what happened in the jail."
Even Kennedy, in a Nov. 13 letter to Santa Clara
County Sheriff Robert Winter, called for a "full and
open account" of the events of Oct. 11.
This is a serious matter, and until the facts on it
are ascertained, the University cannot claim to have
completely looked into the events of Oct. 11.
For these reasons, we urge the ASSU to appoint
an outsider to conduct an inquiry.
