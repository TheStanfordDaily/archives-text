# On Self-Determination
## 
### 
Events in South Africa, the Philippines, South Korea
and El Salvador bring to attention urgent situations
reaching various levels of crisis throughout the world.
Naturally, interest of this sort is going to evoke discus
sion and thought on what is to be done. That has cer
tainly been the case at Stanford, where a series of
viewpoints ran last quarter regarding the situation in
the Philippines as well as the continuing debate sur
rounding apartheid.
What much of the debate has lacked is the concept of
self-determination — that the people living in the
countries concerned have a right to determine their
own destinies. This omission is no surprise. After all,
most of us have grown up in the United States under a
government that has consistently upheld a paternalistic
and interventionist foreign policy, always claiming to
know how a particular country should be run, from
Vietnam and El Salvador to South Africa and the
Philippines.

Kenneth Fenyo, in his Nov. 5 column, put forth
several different methods of dealing with the crisis in
the Philippines, none of which involved respecting the
will of the Filipino people. He pointed out that Marcos'
regime has been severely repressive and authoritarian
in nature and that something had to be done. What he
calls for is nothing less than having the United States
intervene and dictate what the U. S. government feels
is a proper way to conduct a "democracy." But with his
call and reasoning he is asking for a foreign power to in
tervene, even if it is against the will of the vast majority
of the Philippines' population.
The underlying notion is that the people of the
Philippines cannot be trusted to deal with their own in
ternal affairs. Regardless of the U.S. view of the politi
cal direction of the Philippines, Filipinos have the right
to decide what is best for their country. The best thing
the United States can do is withdraw its support for
Marcos — which is what has enabled him to stay in
power for so long — and enable the people to deter
mine what they will do.
The Reagan Administration has no problem with the
concept of self-determination when discussing that of
the white residents of the 13 colonies — the question
was moot for blacks. The right of the white residents
of the original American colonies to take control of their
own destiny with a political and economic system of
their choice, not one determined by the imperialist
British government, is never questioned. The Reagan
Administration certainly stops marching to this tune
when applied to other countries fighting for the same
right.
Nicaragua is a particularly good example. The 1979
insurrection in that country overthrew the extremely
repressive Somoza regime and set up a popular,
people's government. It was of no concern to the
Reagan Administration that the actions of the people of
Nicaragua set up a popular government; the will of the
people was not a factor in dictating foreign policy in that
situation (or in many others). Instead, Reagan has
backed a small group of terrorists, the contras, and
carries on a destabilizing campaign of terror against the
people of Nicaragua. The result of this effective cam
paign is that the development of Nicaragua has been
severely hindered, and impositions on civil liberties
have been enforced to deal with the all-out attack on
that country.
The situation in the Philippines is like that in
Nicaragua under the Somoza regime — only the most
reactionary men back the Marcos government, while
most acknowledge the authoritarian qualities of his
rule. However, with the Marcos-governed islands
being a virtual U.S. colony — including two very
strategically important military bases, Clark Air Force
Base and Subic Bay Naval Base — the Reagan Admin
istration and its allies desperately want to maintain firm
control of the Philippines.
As Asst. Defense Secretary Richard Armitage
pointed out on Nov. 12, the current pace of growth in
the "insurgency" in the Philippines is very rapid and

threatens the Marcos government. This statement
implies that the growth of the struggle of the people of
the Philippines against the ruling regime is not to be
supported, but should be opposed in a more sophisti
cated way, such as finding a new, pro-United States
leader to combat the popular struggle. But the fact of
the matter remains that the New People's Army (NPA)
enjoys widespread support and is growing, despite the
fact that supplies, arms and resources are severely
limited.
The relevant point here is that the legitimacy of the
NPA and its allies is based on it being a popular move
ment, and it is the right of the people in that country to
decide their own future, be it socialist or capitalist. Un
fortunately, this is not the belief held by the Reagan
Administration, nor has it been the belief held by many
previous U.S. administrations.
Another relevant example is the blatant denial of the
rights of the Afghan people by the Soviet Union. The
bare-fisted terrorism of the Soviet invasion in 1979
exposed once again their imperialistic nature. The, con
tinued genocide which occurs in Afghanistan is one of
the more blatant examples of the bankruptcy of Soviet
foreign policy. The point is that no country, under any
pretense, has the right to go into a foreign country and
uphold its own self-interest against the popular will of
the people.
A final example, which is particularly relevant to the
interests of the Stanford community, is the situation in
South Africa. There is widespread agreement that
apartheid is a crime against humanity, and that such
measures as divestment can be successful ways of
helping to bring about its end. What is much more am
biguous, and less understood in the United States, is
how self-determination comes into play.
The vast majority of South Africans, however, are
quite sure of how majority rule will come about. From
the African National Congress, the United Democratic
Front and the other major liberation organizations, as
well as the masses of oppressed black South Africans,

The struggle of the people in
South Africa is not for reform
of a system that excludes the
majority of the population, but
rather for the abolition of that
particular system and its re
placement by majority rule.

comes a call to foreign countries for support of their
struggle. The call is for a large variety of support, a
chieving a number of different things, all of which are
aimed at one final goal — self-determination through
black majority rule. Economic sanctions and disinvest
ment, for example, concretely aid the vast majority of
the South African population in their struggle to attain
freedom, justice and equality.
The struggle of the South African people is not for
the reform of a system that excludes the majority of
the population, but rather for the abolition of that par
ticular system and its replacement by majority rule.
This goal is not a popular one in either Washington or
Bldg. 1 of the Quad because U.S. and Stanford
corporate interests enjoy tremendous profits from the
cheap black labor in South Africa. But once again, this
is to be expected from administrations that look to
profits first and humanity second.
What all of the above situations make clear is that the
majority of the population in the nations discussed have
achieved, or are trying to achieve, self-determination.
Equally clear is the role that the U.S. government has
consistently taken against these efforts. These policies
arise from a desire to protect our political and eco
nomic strategic interests.
We have a history of fighting for freedom in this
country, from Nathan Hale's cry for liberty or death, to
Malcolm X's call for human rights by any means neces
sary. Now we must fight equally hard to respect and
support those who carry out similar struggles around
the world for the right to control and determine their
own destinies.

Reagan Administration that the actions of the people of
Nicaragua set up a popular government; the will of the
people was not a factor in dictating foreign policy in that
situation (or in many others). Instead, Reagan has
backed a small group of terrorists, the contras, and
carries on a destabilizing campaign of terror against the
people of Nicaragua. The result of this effective cam
paign is that the development of Nicaragua has been
severely hindered, and impositions on civil liberties
have been enforced to deal with the all-out attack on
that country.
The situation in the Philippines is like that in
Nicaragua under the Somoza regime — only the most
reactionary men back the Marcos government, while
most acknowledge the authoritarian qualities of his
rule. However, with the Marcos-governed islands
being a virtual U.S. colony — including two very
strategically important military bases, Clark Air Force
Base and Subic Bay Naval Base — the Reagan Admin
istration and its allies desperately want to maintain firm
control of the Philippines.
As Asst. Defense Secretary Richard Armitage
pointed out on Nov. 12, the current pace of growth in
the "insurgency" in the Philippines is very rapid and

threatens the Marcos government. This statement
implies that the growth of the struggle of the people of
the Philippines against the ruling regime is not to be
supported, but should be opposed in a more sophisti
cated way, such as finding a new, pro-United States
leader to combat the popular struggle. But the fact of
the matter remains that the New People's Army (NPA)
enjoys widespread support and is growing, despite the
fact that supplies, arms and resources are severely
limited.
The relevant point here is that the legitimacy of the
NPA and its allies is based on it being a popular move
ment, and it is the right of the people in that country to
decide their own future, be it socialist or capitalist. Un
fortunately, this is not the belief held by the Reagan
Administration, nor has it been the belief held by many
previous U.S. administrations.
Another relevant example is the blatant denial of the
rights of the Afghan people by the Soviet Union. The
bare-fisted terrorism of the Soviet invasion in 1979
exposed once again their imperialistic nature. The, con
tinued genocide which occurs in Afghanistan is one of
the more blatant examples of the bankruptcy of Soviet
foreign policy. The point is that no country, under any
pretense, has the right to go into a foreign country and
uphold its own self-interest against the popular will of
the people.
A final example, which is particularly relevant to the
interests of the Stanford community, is the situation in
South Africa. There is widespread agreement that
apartheid is a crime against humanity, and that such
measures as divestment can be successful ways of
helping to bring about its end. What is much more am
biguous, and less understood in the United States, is
how self-determination comes into play.
The vast majority of South Africans, however, are
quite sure of how majority rule will come about. From
the African National Congress, the United Democratic
Front and the other major liberation organizations, as
well as the masses of oppressed black South Africans,

The struggle of the people in
South Africa is not for reform
of a system that excludes the
majority of the population, but
rather for the abolition of that
particular system and its re
placement by majority rule.

comes a call to foreign countries for support of their
struggle. The call is for a large variety of support, a
chieving a number of different things, all of which are
aimed at one final goal — self-determination through
black majority rule. Economic sanctions and disinvest
ment, for example, concretely aid the vast majority of
the South African population in their struggle to attain
freedom, justice and equality.
The struggle of the South African people is not for
the reform of a system that excludes the majority of
the population, but rather for the abolition of that par
ticular system and its replacement by majority rule.
This goal is not a popular one in either Washington or
Bldg. 1 of the Quad because U.S. and Stanford
corporate interests enjoy tremendous profits from the
cheap black labor in South Africa. But once again, this
is to be expected from administrations that look to
profits first and humanity second.
What all of the above situations make clear is that the
majority of the population in the nations discussed have
achieved, or are trying to achieve, self-determination.
Equally clear is the role that the U.S. government has
consistently taken against these efforts. These policies
arise from a desire to protect our political and eco
nomic strategic interests.
We have a history of fighting for freedom in this
country, from Nathan Hale's cry for liberty or death, to
Malcolm X's call for human rights by any means neces
sary. Now we must fight equally hard to respect and
support those who carry out similar struggles around
the world for the right to control and determine their
own destinies.

Events in South Africa, the Philippines, South Korea
and El Salvador bring to attention urgent situations
reaching various levels of crisis throughout the world.
Naturally, interest of this sort is going to evoke discus
sion and thought on what is to be done. That has cer
tainly been the case at Stanford, where a series of
viewpoints ran last quarter regarding the situation in
the Philippines as well as the continuing debate sur
rounding apartheid.
What much of the debate has lacked is the concept of
self-determination — that the people living in the
countries concerned have a right to determine their
own destinies. This omission is no surprise. After all,
most of us have grown up in the United States under a
government that has consistently upheld a paternalistic
and interventionist foreign policy, always claiming to
know how a particular country should be run, from
Vietnam and El Salvador to South Africa and the
Philippines.

Kenneth Fenyo, in his Nov. 5 column, put forth
several different methods of dealing with the crisis in
the Philippines, none of which involved respecting the
will of the Filipino people. He pointed out that Marcos'
regime has been severely repressive and authoritarian
in nature and that something had to be done. What he
calls for is nothing less than having the United States
intervene and dictate what the U. S. government feels
is a proper way to conduct a "democracy." But with his
call and reasoning he is asking for a foreign power to in
tervene, even if it is against the will of the vast majority
of the Philippines' population.
The underlying notion is that the people of the
Philippines cannot be trusted to deal with their own in
ternal affairs. Regardless of the U.S. view of the politi
cal direction of the Philippines, Filipinos have the right
to decide what is best for their country. The best thing
the United States can do is withdraw its support for
Marcos — which is what has enabled him to stay in
power for so long — and enable the people to deter
mine what they will do.
The Reagan Administration has no problem with the
concept of self-determination when discussing that of
the white residents of the 13 colonies — the question
was moot for blacks. The right of the white residents
of the original American colonies to take control of their
own destiny with a political and economic system of
their choice, not one determined by the imperialist
British government, is never questioned. The Reagan
Administration certainly stops marching to this tune
when applied to other countries fighting for the same
right.
Nicaragua is a particularly good example. The 1979
insurrection in that country overthrew the extremely
repressive Somoza regime and set up a popular,
people's government. It was of no concern to the
Reagan Administration that the actions of the people of
Nicaragua set up a popular government; the will of the
people was not a factor in dictating foreign policy in that
