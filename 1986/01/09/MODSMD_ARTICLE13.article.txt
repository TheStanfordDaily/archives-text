## Castro Supports Narcotics Traffic 
### 
The Cuban revolution has
gradually lost most of the interna
tional support it once enjoyed.
People throughout the free world
feel deeply disappointed because
Fidel Castro, the architect of the in
surrection against General Fulgen
cio Batista, neglected the promises
he made as a young guerrilla leader
and became a dictator as despotic
as the one overthrown in 1958.
Castro's critics have plenty of
complaints, since under his rule the
standard of living of Cubans has
dramatically declined while the
number of political prisoners has
geometrically increased. Further
more, most of Castro's opponents
hail him as the main promoter of
terrorism in Latin America, and in
particular, the United States gov-

VIEWPOINT

ernment accuses Castro of spon
soring the largest narcotics-traffic
network in the American continent.
In 1983, the Senate Drug En
forcement Caucus concluded that
Castro uses the illegal profits of
narcotics traffic to finance sub
versive activities throughout the
Third World. After an extensive in
vestigation, the caucus issued a
special report in which Sen. Paula
Hawkins (R-Fla.), chairman of the
caucus, stated the following:
"This special report is the first
comprehensive documentation of
Castro's extensive use of narcotics
as a weapon against the United
States and a means to finance and
promote terrorism. .. . The
Castro government is financing ter
rorism by crippling America's
children through narcotics traffick
ing. The findings of this special
report must serve as a basis for im
mediate and appropriate action
against this threat to the United
States and our democratic neigh
bors. ... As chairman of the Sen-

ate Drug Enforcement Caucus, I in
tend to join with my Senate col
leagues and the international com
munity to seek condemnation and
action against the Cuban dictator."
The evidence collected by the
caucus shows that Castro has
protected Colombian drug boats in
return for substantial payments.
The testimony given by federal
drug agents indicates the
mid-1970s Colombian smugglers
shipped marijuana and cocaine to
the United States without Castro's
backing. The smugglers' ships
departed from South America and
usually headed toward the Windway
passage, a narrow strait between
the eastern tip of Cuba and Haiti, to
meet the smaller vessels that would
reach the coast of Florida. The
smugglers lost millions of dollars
every time Cuban authorities con
fiscated their cargos. But since
Castro discovered the potential of
the narcotics business, Cuba per
mits drug boats to navigate in its
territorial waters and provides
protection to those vessels.
The Jaime Guillot Lara case il
lustrates Castro's participation in
the narcotics trafficking operations.
Ever since 1980, Guillot Lara, a
major Colombian smuggler, became
Havana's main client. Cuban auth
orities charged Lara a lower fee,
and in exchange his ships carried
arms to the M-19, a powerful
Colombian terrorist movement. As
soon as the Colombian army found

evidence of Cuba's links to the M
-19, the president of that Southern
American nation decided to break
diplomatic relations with the island.
Lara's arrest in Mexico City in No
vember 1982 gave U.S. officials an
opportunity to obtain detailed infor
mation on Castro's complicity. Lara
later escaped from a Mexican
prison, presumably assisted by
OaSfro,- whd 'hails him as "a
friend of Cuba." But his testimony
helped U. S. agents to dismantle the
network the smuggler had organ
ized.
Castro's behavior has detrimen
tal effects on American society.
Every year the United States loses
important human and material re
sources due to the drug abuse that
the dictator and his partners
promote. Castro's conduct should
not surprise us, because he has dis
played an absolute lack of human
sensitivity ever since he became
Cuba's strongman. Castro has had
enough time to engage his nation in
constructive activities. Unfortun
ately, he has used his position to
transform the island into a
totalitarian state and a haven for
narcotics traffickers, terrorists and
all kinds of fugitives from justice.
The Cuban people deserve some
thing better. The time has come to
hold Castro accountable for his
crimes.
