# Soviet To Speak?
## Hopes still alive for Gorbachev visit 
### MORTY POSNER Staff writer 
Seniors working to invite Mikhail Gorbachev
as this year's Commencement speaker remain
hopeful that Stanford will extend an invitation
despite the likelihood that the ceremony will
not coincide with the upcoming summit be
tween the Soviet leader and President
Reagan.
According to Marlene Wine, special assis
tant to University President Donald Kennedy,
the Commencement Speaker Advisory Panel
has delayed a final decision until it can ascer
tain exactly when the summit will take place.
Originally scheduled to occur in June in the
United States, the summit would have
coincided with Commencement. There are in
dications now, however, that the summit will
be delayed until September.
Composed of Kennedy, two members of
the Senior Class and members of the faculty
and staff, the panel is charged with recom
mending to Kennedy its choice for a Com
mencement speaker, taking into account the

desire of the Senior Class.
Among those currently being considered to
speak at Commencement are Bill Cosby,
President Reagan, South African Bishop Des
mond Tutu, Soviet President Andrei
Gromyko, and Linus Pauling, former winner of
Nobel prizes in chemistry and peace.
Mark Fleischauer, who heads a group of
seniors seeking to bring Gorbachev to Stan
ford as Commencement speaker, said he feels
the University has been "cordial" and
"encouraging," but is maintaining a "low
profile" about the possibility of inviting Gorba
chev.
Should the summit take place in September,
Fleischauer hopes the University will issue an
open invitation to Gorbachev to speak at Stan
ford that month. Wine said that an open invita
tion would be the prerogative of Kennedy, but
did not discount the possibility.

cisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein's office in the
