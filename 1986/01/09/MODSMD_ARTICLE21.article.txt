## Class Studies Uses of Education 
### FIONA ADAMSON Staff writer 
"We will be looking at education
as the double-edged sword that can
cut both ways," said Robert
Amove, a visiting professor from
Indiana University, about a course
he is teaching this quarter entitled
"Education and Colonialism."
The course, which is sponsored
by the School of Education as Edu
cation 2375, will look at education
as a force that can be used both to
oppress and assimilate people and
to liberate them, according to
Amove.
A Stanford graduate holding a
PhD in International Development
in Education, Amove has been a
professor at Indiana University
since 1972. He has made two films
himself, one dealing with alterna
tive public schools in the United
States during the 19705. The
second, which is due out this
February, is about the 1984 elec
tions in Nicaragua.
Amove was a candidate for the
U.S. Congress in 1982, running as
a member of the Citizen's party in
order to "raise issues and present
new ways of looking at problems,"
he said.
Amove described his class this
quarter as "consciousness raising"
and as an aid in seeing the

"relationship between education
and society in broader and more
complex ways."
"The course uses films, but it is
not a course in film criticism, rather
a course using film as a didactic
medium," Amove said.
Amove described the class as
focusing "on education and the
colonial experience in different geo
graphical regions, but particularly
the Americas and Africa."
Some of the award-winning films
to be presented include "Bum,"
starring Marlon Brando, and
"Praise," a 1983 movie from South
Africa.
The course, which meets Mon
day and Wednesday evenings at 7
p.m. for approximately three hours
each session, will use books and
guest speakers in addition to films.
Books which will be used in class
include both works of fiction and
non-fiction, among them Alice
Walker's "The Color Purple."
According to Amove, "resource
people will be brought in" to speak,
but the discussions will rely heavily
on student participation.
Amove said, "We will be distin
guishing three types of colonialism:
classical, internal, and neo."
Amove defined classical
colonialism as "the political and eco
nomic exploitation of one nation
over others. More specifically,

colonialism generally meant over
seas imperialism of Western nations
over non-Western nations."
Speaking further on internal
colonialism, Amove explained,
"Whether or not the concept of in
ternal colonialism also applies to
ethnic groups such as blacks and
Hispanics, to gender groups, such
as women, and to regional groups
such as Appalachian poor whites is
debatable, but we will be looking at
the literature that attempts to draw
parallels between these various
groups and more clear cut cases."
In exploring neocolonialism, the
course will also "deal with problems
of decolonization and the continuing
patterns of domination and depen
dency," focusing on countries
which are politically independent
but are still economically and
militarily dominated by "the
metropolitan nations," Amove said.
The course, sponsored also by
the Center for Latin American
Studies, the Center for African
Studies, the Chicano Culture Cen
ter, SWOPSI and the African and
Afro-American Studies Program, is
open to both upper division under
graduate and graduate students.
The general public is invited to
attend the films presented during
the quarter. "Burn" will be the first
film screened and is slated for Jan.
13 at 7 p.m. in Cubberley
Auditorium.
