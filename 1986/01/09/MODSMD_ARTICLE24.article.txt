Zasu Pitts Memorial Orchestra
— "The Pitts Bear Down"
★★★★
Arguably the Pitts are currently
San Francisco's premier party
band. This 15-plus person organiza
tion strives to recreate the glory
and pride of the Motown and soul
era of the '60s and early '70s. This
LP is the first full-length effort, al
though the group released a
promising six-song EP last year.
Zasu Pitts was originally formed to
ensure that the contributions of the
artists of the soul/Motown era were
not forgotten. This is not a mind
less cover band, but a group of
professionals dedicated to keeping
the torch of the roots of American
music lit.
This album, recorded at their fa
vorite venue, the Great American
Music Hall in San Francisco, is a live
record with a purpose. Zasu Pitts
(in memory of the famed silent film
star) is a band that cannot ade
quately represent its experience in
the studio. To be appreciated the
Pitts must be experienced in a
dark, smoke-filled club. The

recording is very accurate, the
sound is clear and crisp throughout,
the drums are tight, and the excel
lent vocals are ably showcased.
The band plays with its customary
verve and fire, igniting the classics
of yesteryear. With a four-person
horn section, two keyboardists, a
glockenspiel and eight singers, it is
relatively easy for the band to adopt
a multitude of styles and attitudes.

They can move from covering
Aretha to James Brown to the Ras
cals and Sly Stone. In an era of
overpriced shows and short sets,
one certainly gets his money's
worth from a Zasu show.

The Dream Academy — "The
Dream Academy"
ifirifi
The Dream Academy is some
thing of a cross between Aztec
Camera and Prefab Sprout with a
sprinkling of Waterboys, if that
means anything to you. This is the
latest in serious pop. You get syn
thesizers, pianos, oboes and a
generous heap of acoustic guitars
and kettle drums. Quite impres
sive, really. The band has all kinds
of pretty images in their songs, al
though it's hard to tell what they're
getting at in most of them. Never
theless, it's pleasant to be listening
to songs called "Life in a Northern
Town," "The Love Parade" and
"The Edge of Forever." R.E.M.'s
Peter Buck and David Gilmour of
Pink Floyd each play a bit of guitar
every once in a while, and Gilmour
produced the album. This here
Dream Academy got good connec
tions. There isn't a bad song, but
then again there are no classics
either. If you've heard their strong
single, "Northern Town," there are
even better songs on the record.
This is not a reviewer's dream al
bum — but it is a very welcome
return to progressive and original
pop music.

The rating scale: from one to five stars, with five being the best
Selected cuts from these albums will be played tomorrow on KZSU at 6 p.m.

Trouble Funk — "Saturday
Night Live! From Washington,
D.C."
Trouble Funk are labeled the
"enforcers" in Washington, D.C.'s
Go-Go scene, and on this album
they demonstrate why no one could
possibly hope to take the title from
them. From the opening moment of
"A Groove" until the final cowbells
of "Sleep On It,"the group throws
down hardcore urban funk. The se
cret to the Trouble Funk sonic at
tack is the wall of sound driven by
the blitzkrieg assault of the massed
combination of drums, vocals and
synthesizers that raze everything in
their path. This is not for the weak
of heart: The boys are playing for
keeps and are not to be messed
with. They rock so hard one has to
wonder why the building does not
collapse around their feet.
"Saturday Night" is just a
routinely incredible performance
from the crew. Every track is a
winner, and the band moves seam
lessly from one song to another.
Particularly outstanding are

"Double Trouble/4th Gear," "Take
It to the Bridge" and "Give Me a
Quick One."
Be forewarned about the com
plaints you are sure to receive from
your neighbors as you are forced to
crank up the stereo to maximal
volume and hang out with the crew.

John Wallin and Telford Work
