# 'Ran' Races to Success
## 
### MARK TOMPKINS Staff writer 
Japanese director Akira Kurosawa spent a decade
planning his film "Ran" before he actually began film
ing, and for once here is a movie that is actually
deserving of all the time spent on it. Forgive the hy
perbole, but "Ran" is a masterpiece.
Most film epics are described by critics in terms
like "stately" or "classical," and these terms have
come to be bywords for long, slow-moving movies
which leave the viewer utterly exhausted. But while
"Ran" is a film epic if ever there was one, it doesn't
have a single wasted shot or moment that isn't cru
cial to the storyline.
Although it is based on a true piece of Japanese
history, the film can easily be described as "King
Lear" set in the feudal Japan of the 16th century. An
exhausted warlord named Hidetora (Tatsuya
Nakadai) decides to turn over his vast domain to his
three sons. Hidetora is through with fighting: He
now plans to let his sons take care of him. But he
does not realize the extent of his heirs' competitive
ness, and they soon turn on him and each other,
each son hoping to become sole ruler of Hidetora's
domain.
Hidetora has also failed to recognize the true na
ture of his daughter-in-law, Lady Kaede (Mieko
Harada), who is married to his eldest son. Lady
Kaede is the principal instigator of the film's tragic
events: It's she who urges her husband to humiliate
Hidetora and take over the kingdom for himself. Ul
timately, Hidetora goes mad when he loses his
power, and he wanders through the ruins of the
lands he once conquered, attended only by his fool,
Kyoami. Kyomi is played by Peter, an androgynous
Japanese actor and singer.
It's not important that these performers are un
familiar to Western audiences, for each cast member
makes a strong impression on the film. Tatsuya

Nakadai is splendid as Hidetora, the clan leader
weighted down by the burden of tragedy. By the
film's end his every gesture expresses pain. Peter is
also fine as Kyoami, for he lets us see that a deep af
fection always lies behind Kyoami's mockery of
Hidetora. But the most memorable presence in the
film is Mieko Harada's Lady Kaede. Her shaved
eyebrows give her a weirdly beautiful, unhuman
look, just as her cold, calculating intelligence makes
her a fascinating character.
In every scene Akira Kurosawa shows why he
has long been regarded as one of the world's most
brilliant directors. At times his compositions look
two-dimensional, like the unreal stage design in
Kabuki Theater, and at other times he achieves a
startling depth of focus. In the battle scenes each
army wears distinctively colored armor, so when
the fighting begins, colored waves merge into each
other in an almost abstract fashion.
In this director's hands the camera becomes an
eloquent means of storytelling. One of the film's vis
ual motifs is the movement of clouds. Each time
Kurosawa cuts to them, the cloud formations grow
more ominous; when Hidetora comes to doubt the
benevolence of his gods, the clouds finally break out
into a storm. Nature's primal force is suited to this
film's grandeur, and Kurosawa utilizes it perfectly.
"Ran" is big in every possible way — its length,
its scope and its themes. Kurosawa handles his ma
terial with consummate skill, and more importantly,
a great depth of feeling. Some reviewers have des
cribed "Ran" as being icily detached in tone, but
nothing could be further from the truth. Kurosawa
takes a humane view of his characters: Their's is a
dignified suffering. The audience never forgets that
it is watching a tragedy. And mention must be made
of the film's very last shot, which depicts a blind man
tapping his cane along the edge of a cliff. It's a beau
tiful, haunting image, and, like "Ran" as a whole, it's
certain to be regarded as a classic in the years to
come.
