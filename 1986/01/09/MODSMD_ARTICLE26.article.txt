## Card Cagers Play in Tucson Tonight But Co-Captain Steve Brown's Out for the Rest of the Season 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
The Stanford men's basketball
team received a devastating piece
of news late yesterday when it was
learned that senior guard Steve
Brown will miss the rest of the
season with a stress fracture to the
tibia bone in his right leg.
The injury will be a painful one
for the Cardinal, which travels to
the desert Southwest without its
top upperclassman for games
tonight against Arizona and Satur
day against Arizona State.
The injury is the same one that
caused Brown to redshirt last
season. The injury did not heal suf
ficiently, though, and by continuing
to play, Brown could have suffered
a complete fracture with inherently
serious complications.
Brown started the first seven
games of this season for Stanford.
He was second on the team in
scoring averaging 11.3 points per
game. He played just over 22
minutes a game. His best game was
a 20-point effort in the 108-69 vic
tory, here over UC-San Diego.
Novian Whitsitt, who has filled
Brown's starting role for the past
seven games, will continue as the
starter at the No. 2 guard spot.
Whitsitt scored 19 points in the loss
to Washington last Saturday.
The stiffness of the competition
Stanford will face is unclear: This
year's Pacific 10 Conference race
appears to be predictable only in its

unpredictablity. Washington, the
preseason favorite, lost its opener
to a surprising California team last
weekend and then needed a last
second shot to edge Stanford by
one point and avoid opening 0-2 on
the road.
Meanwhile, in the southern
reaches of the conference, Arizona,

picked to finish eighth this season,
got rival Arizona State at McKale
Center in Tucson. The Wildcats
came away with a 62-53 victory in
the league lidlifter for both teams.
ASU had been the preseason choice
to finish second.
It would seem that winning away
from home will be the difficult task
in the Pac-10 this year. On the
year, Stanford has had its problems
away from the confines of Maples
Pavilion, going 2-4. Those wins
came against Ivy League foe Har
vard and NAIA spoiler Chaminade.

Neither school is Pac-10 material.
So, Coach Tom Davis doesn't ex
pect to walk away with a couple of
easy wins. "ItH be typical of any
Pac-10 road game â€” it's going to
take an outstanding effort. It's clear
that for us to win on the road, we
have to play one of our better
games.

"Our goal is to go in and put it all
together. We've done it at times;
we've played well at times. We
have to play 40 minutes."
Arizona is 9-4 this season and un
defeated in conference play after
the win over the Sun Devils. The
Wildcats are coming off a 21-10
season that saw them tie for third in
the Pac-10 and lose in the first
round of the NCAA West Regional
to Alabama, 50-41.

After X-rays revealed yesterday the severity of Steve Brown's stress fracture, the senior from San
Diego was told by doctors that he wouldn't suit up for Stanford again this year.
has stepped into a starting role to
lead the Wildcats in scoring, averag
ing 14 points per game. He had a
game-high 17 against Arizona
State.
Junior guard Steve Kerr, the top
returnee, is averaging 13.5 points
per game, and sophomore forward
Craig McMillan is scoring 11 points
each contest. Senior John Edgar

and freshman Anthony Cook round
out the starting five.
"Arizona has a balanced scoring
attack," Davis said. "There's not
one person to key on. They've got
the two outside kids, Kerr and
McMillan, who we have to identify,
and we can't let Elliot and the inside
guys hurt us.
"They're not unlike us. When we
play well, we're pretty balanced."
Tonight's game begins at 6:35
PST and will be broadcast on KCBS
(740 AM) and KZSU (90.1 FM).
