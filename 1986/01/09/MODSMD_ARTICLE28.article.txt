# Bears eye title
## Pac-10 in Full Swing 
### 
BERKELEY (AP) â€” The California
Golden Bears, fresh from their latest last
second victory, will be chasing their third
straight Pacific-10 Conference triumph
tonight when they meet the Arizona State
Sun Devils in Tempe, Ariz.
There are three other Pac-10 matchups
scheduled tonight: Stanford at Arizona,
UCLA at Washington and Southern California
at Washington State.
In the Pacific Coast Athletic Association,
there are four conference matchups on tap:
12th-ranked Nevada-Las Vegas at Pacific;
UC-Irvine at Fresno State; UC-Santa Bar
bara at San Jose State; and Fullerton State at
Utah State.

In their last game, the Golden Bears rallied
from a three-point deficit in the final five
seconds Tuesday night to defeat the Univer
sity of San Francisco 59-58.
With USF ahead 58-55, Cal guard Chris
Washington scored on a layup with five
seconds left. He was fouled, but missed the
free throw. Forward Leonard Taylor got the
rebound and scored the winning basket with
two seconds left.
Last week, Cal defeated Washington and

Washington State to open its Pac-10
schedule.

The Bears, 10-2 overall, are in pursuit of
their first conference title in 26 years. The
Bears last garnered the Athletic Association
of Western Universities championship in
1959-1960. The AAWU was a forerunner to
the present-day Pac-10.
Arizona State is 0-1 in conference, 6-5
overall, and comes off a 62-53 defeat against
the Arizona Wildcats. The Sun Devils lost
guard Ron Singleton since that defeat when
the senior was declared academically in
eligible this week and disqualified from
school.
And all of the Bears' success comes as
something of a surprise. The school dis
missed its coach, Dick Kuchen, after the con
clusion of last year's Pac-10 play and hired
Lou Campanelli.
Campenelli came to Cal after 13 years with
James Madison University in Virginia where
he compiled a record of 238-118. A pre
season coaches poll picked the Bears to finish
fifth in the conference.
Campenelli hopes to turn around a
Berkeley basketball program that has long
been mediocre. "People are hungry around
here, they're tired of losing," Campanelli
said. "I didn't take this job to be mediocre."
The UCLA Bruins, who lost to Oregon
State on Saturday, try to regain their momen
tum when they meet the Washington
Huskies, 1-1 and 7-7, in Seattle. The Bruins,
1-1 and 6-3, had won six of seven prior to the
lost to the Beavers.
Southern Cal, 1-1 and 6-5, comes off an im
pressive 75-60 victory over Oregon, in which
the Trojans were without their leading
scorer, freshman Tom Lewis.
Lewis is expected to be in the lineup
Thursday night against Washington State, 0-2
and 7-8.
