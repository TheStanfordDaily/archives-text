# Dickerson's Confident Going Against Bears
## 
### 
ANAHEIM (AP) â€” Running back
Eric Dickerson of the Los Angeles
Rams didn't hesitate to predict the
outcome of Sunday's game against the
Bears in Chicago.
"It may be 7-0 .. . or 7-3 .. . or
maybe 30-0 in favor of them ... or in
favor of us," the Rams' record-breaking
runner said with a smile yesterday.
The Rams, 12-5, are un
derdogs against the Bears, 16-1, in the
battle for the National Football Confer
ence title and a berth in the Super Bowl
at New Orleans on Jan. 26.
"Everybody's saying we don't have a
chance," Dickerson said. "Maybe we
don't, but we're going to go out there
and give it a shot.
"I've played against the Bears two
years (Rams victories at Anaheim
Stadium in 1983 and 1984), and they
played good to a point. But we kept
their defense on the field and finally
tired them out.
"This game depends on a lot of
things," added Dickerson. "It depends
on our passing game; it depends on
turnovers by both teams."
Dickerson, who holds the NFL's all
time rookie rushing record (1,808
yards) and single-season rushing record
(2,105 yards in 1984), set a playoff
record by running for 248 yards Satur
day in Los Angeles' 20-0 victory over
Dallas.

He scored two touchdowns to carry
the Rams offense, as their passing game
faltered.
"I had a great game last week, but
that's history; hopefully well all have a
good game this week," he said. "I feel
like our chances of going to the Super
Bowl are just as good as the Bears, the
Dolphins and the Patriots."
Dickerson was asked about a com
ment attributed to Bears' defensive co
ordinator Buddy Ryan that Dickerson
would fumble at least three times in
Sunday's game.
"Maybe Buddy Ryan knows some
thing I don't," Dickerson said. "I know
I'll be in their game plan.
"But the more you try to strip the
ball, the more you miss tackles. If they
strip and miss, I'm going to be in their
secondary, and they could be in for a

long afternoon."
The Rams-Bears matchup also pits
two of the NFL's premiere runners in
Dickerson and Chicago's Walter Payton,
who holds the NFL record for career
rushing yards.
Dickerson called Payton the
"greatest of the great" as a football
player but not much as a driver.
"At the Pro Bowl, I was riding back
from practice with Walter, who's a
practical joker. He was going across the
center line and weaving in and out, and I
was screaming," Dickerson related.
"Finally I put on my helmet. He
thought the whole thing was real funny.
Nope, I'll never get in a car with Walter
Payton again."
The Rams, who are leaving this even
ing for Chicago, have been practicing in
70-degree temperatures this week.
