# A 						Calamity in the Kitchen Might Cook Fryar's Goose

FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) â€” Irving
Fryar of the New England Patriots, the
National Football League's top punt
returner, missed the team's flight south
yesterday after slicing two fingers on his
right hand in a kitchen accident.
Fryar cut his hand with a kitchen
knife, injuring his ring finger and little
finger, and he injured the flexor tendon
on the smallest finger, said Dr. Daniel
Sigman, a plastic surgeon, who treated
Fryar.
He described the ring finger injury as
a minor laceration.
Sigman said the cuts were repaired,
as was the tendon, and the wound was
stitched. Both fingers were placed in a
splint to keep them immobile.
"Any decision on whether Fryar will
play Sunday and whether the splints can

be removed for the game will have to be
made by team physician Bert Zarins,"
the surgeon said.
"A tendon injury usually involves a
healing process of approximately three
weeks," Sigman said in a prepared
statement.
The injury to Fryar, a major force in
New England's offense, came on a day
when the main sound of the NFL
playoffs was the sound of airplane
engines.
While temperatures in the Midwest
hovered around the zero mark, the
Chicago Bears, preparing for Sunday's
NFC title game with the Los Angeles
Rams, headed for the second straight
week to Suwanee, Ga. The Rams
practiced again in Anaheim and will head
to Chicago on Thursday night, beating

the Bears to town.
And while the Dolphins practiced in a
steady rain at their camp, the Patriots
headed south from New England for
their AFC title meeting at the Orange
Bowl minus Fryar, who averaged 14.1
yards and scored two touchdowns on
returns this year. He was also the
team's second leading receiver.
A spokesman for the Patriots said
Fryar would make his own travel plans.
Fryar wasn't present at a rally in Boston
to send the Patriots off.
The Dolphins, who lost in the Super
Bowl to the 49ers last season, are ap
proaching Sunday's game as a form of
redemption. They're also very much
aware of the scare they were handed
last week by the 8-8 Cleveland Browns.
