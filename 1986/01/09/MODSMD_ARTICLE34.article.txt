# Gibson Ends Holdout
## 
### 
DETROIT (AP) — The Detroit
Tigers reached contract terms with
free agent outfielder Kirk Gibson
last night just moments before a
midnight deadline that would have
prevented the American League
team from re-signing him before
May 1, a club spokesman said.
Team spokesman Dan Ewald
said shortly after midnight today
that he knew of few contract
details, adding that the Tigers'
long-standing offer to Gibson of
$3.9 million over three years was
"in the ballpark."
"It's not precise, but it's close,"
Ewald said of the money offered the

28-year-old right fielder.
Gibson's agent, Doug Baldwin,
"has the contract before him now in
Seattle," Ewald said. "All he has to
do is sign it and return it."
Baldwin did not return telephone
messages left earlier yesterday at
his office.
Gibson, 28, led the Tigers in
1985 with a .287 batting average
and contributed 29 home runs and
97 RBI.
The deadline for free-agent sign
ing was part of a contract agree
ment reached last summer, ending
a brief strike by major league
players.
