Mandela Requests End of Ban
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Black nationalist leader
Winnie Mandela, in a new challenge to South Africa's white minority
ruled government, asked the Supreme Court here yesterday to
declare invalid an order banning her from Johannesburg and restrict
ing her political activities.
Mandela, 49, is asking not only to be allowed to live in her home in
Soweto, Johannesburg's black satellite city from which she has been
dragged twice recently by security police, but for the first time in
nearly a decade to be permitted to resume her full political activities.
The wife of imprisoned African National Congress leader Nelson
Mandela, who is serving a life sentence for sabotage and subversion,
Winnie Mandela has emerged increasingly as a major figure in her
own right among activists opposing South Africa's apartheid system
of racial separation and minority white rule. A court victory for her
would greatly strengthen the anti-apartheid movement here.
Her popularity was clear yesterday afternoon as several hundred
blacks crowded around her, shouting, "Viva Mandela, viva!" and
raised clenched fists in salute as she left the courthouse in downtown
Johannesburg.
Weinberger Urges Treaty Break
WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, as ex
pected, has recommended to President Reagan that the United
States take three actions that would violate the unratified strategic
arms limitation treaty in retaliation for apparent arms control
breaches by the Soviet Union, Administration officials confirmed
yesterday.
But officials predicted that despite Weinberger's recommen
dations, Reagan would continue to adhere to the language of SALT II
— at least until after the next U.S.-Soviet summit, expected later
this year. An interagency group currently is considering the
proposals.
Weinberger's recommendations are contained in a Pentagon study
conducted after a November analysis of apparent Soviet arms control
violations. Officials confirmed the proposals include:
• Placing two ballistic missile-carrying submarines in drydock,
rather than dismantling them, to permit a new, larger missile sub
marine to go into service. A similar recommendation last summer
was rejected by Reagan.
• Replacing some single-warhead Minuteman II missiles with triple
warhead Minuteman 111 missiles.
• Encoding telemetry information from the test flights of new
missiles.
The failure to dismantle the two Poseidon subs, each with 16
missiles, when the next Trident sub goes to sea, carrying 24
missiles, would break the ceiling of 1,200 multiple-warhead missiles
allowed under SALT 11. The change to Minuteman 111 missiles would
further exceed the pact's limit.
The telemetry encryption, meanwhile, would be a response to
what officials said was the Soviets' encoding of up to 95 percent of
the data radioed back from their missile tests. The SALT II agree
ment forbids encoding that interferes with monitoring of the pact.
In addition, Weinberger urged increased research on chemical and
biological warfare in response to alleged Soviet stockpiling of biologi
cal agents and use of nerve gas in Afghanistan.
Botha and Congressmen Argue
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — A delegation of six U.S. con
gressmen exchanged angry words yesterday with South African
President Pieter Botha over apartheid and prospects for its abolition,
and the Americans emerged from the meeting deeply pessimistic.
Although Botha sketched the reforms he intends to announce
when Parliament opens Jan. 31, Rep. William Gray 111 (D-Pa.) chair
man of the House Budget Committee and leader of the delegation,
said later, "Listening to the specifics, I was not given much to hope
for in terms of the question of major reform of apartheid."
After discussions with Botha and two of his ministers at the presi
dent's vacation home at the coastal resort of George, Gray said, the
delegation was not convinced that South Africa has any plans for
"meaningful change." Botha had told them that the government was
"considering various things," Gray said, "but when we asked for
specifics, there were no specifics."
Company Compensates Jews
BONN, West Germany — The successor to the huge Flick com
pany announced yesterday that it has paid five million German marks
(nearly $2 million) in compensation to Jews for its use of slave labor
during World War 11.
The company, Feldmuehle Nobel AG, said the payment to the
Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany was for the
outstanding claims for forced labor. Feldmuehle is the new name for
the remnants of the Flick industries empire, some of whose subdivi
sions used forced Jewish labor during the war, investigators have
said. Its late founder, Friedrich Flick, was sentenced to seven years
in prison by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal in 1947 but served
only three years.
Karl Friedrich Flick, son of the founder and owner of Feldmuehle,
decided last year to sell the conglomerate to Deutsche Bank for
about $2 billion. However, Jewish leaders in Frankfurt demanded
that the Flick company pay damages — although there was no out
standing legal judgment against the giant company — before the
bank followed through on its plans to sell public shares in
Feldmuehle.
Acid Rain Spending Urged
TORONTO — American and Canadian officials yesterday recom
mended that the U.S. government and American industries spend
$5.5 billion over the next five years to develop acid raid control tech
nology. But the report failed to set any deadlines for actually reduc
ing the lake- and forest-killing pollution.
Calling acid rain an urgent problem that causes serious social and
economic losses on both sides of the border, a binational committee
nonetheless said that there is still no mutually acceptable way for re
ducing the pollution in a cost-efficient manner.
The report, which dealt as much with politics as pollution, was
written by former Ontario Premier Bill Davis and former U.S. Secre
tary of Transportation Drew Lewis. It said that more time and re
search is still necessary to reach realistic and workable solutions and
called for spending the $5.5 billion in U.S. dollars to conduct addi
tional studies and build experimental treatment facilities particularly
aimed at controlling pollution from coal burning, the prime source for
acid rain.
