# Hundreds of millions on hold
## Reagan Freezes Libyan Assets 
### 
WASHINGTON and TRIPOLI, Libya — Pres
ident Reagan ordered a freeze on hundreds of
millions of dollars in Libyan assets in American
banks and their subsidiaries yesterday, further
tightening U.S. economic sanctions against
Libya for the recent terrorist attacks in Rome
and Vienna. Meanwhile, the Libyan government
accused the U.S. of attempting to topple Col.
Moammar Khadafy's regime.
Reagan signed an executive order freezing the
assets after U.S. officials discovered that Libyan
money was beginning to drain away from Ameri
can banks in the wake of the president's an
nouncement Tuesday night of an economic
boycott against Libya.
A senior Administration official told reporters
that the frozen Libyan assets amounted to
"hundreds of millions of dollars," but could not
be more precise. The official said Reagan moved
as a "precaution" in case Libya seized the prop
erty of U.S. companies and citizens there.
But other sources said there is no evidence
yet that Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy has
threatened U. S. property in his country. Rather,
the sources said, Libya apparently was trying to
move its assets out of the reach of the United
States, which also froze Iran's assets in 1979 in
respond to the U.S. FmH»<ssv hostage crisis.

Experts familiar with the use of economic
sanctions as a tool of diplomacy said yesterday
that Reagan's announced measures against Libya
are likely to have only a limited effect on
Khadafy. Meanwhile, the Treasury Department
followed up on the president's economic sanc
tions with regulations warning American citizens
to leave Libya promptly or face up to 10 years in
prison. And U. S. firms doing business with Libya
said they would comply with his order but were
uncertain of its impact on them.
As Reagan signed the new order on Libyan as
sets yesterday, U.S. ambassadors in Western
Europe and the Middle East made renewed ap
peals to allied governments to join the economic
boycott in retaliation for the Dec. 27 airport at
tacks in Rome and Vienna that killed 19 people,
including five Americans.
Administration officials said they were consid
ering a mission by Deputy Secretary of State
John Whitehead to Western Europe and Japan to
urge cooperation in the boycott, but a decision
had not yet been made to send him.
Richard Murphy, assistant secretary of state
for Mideast affairs, met yesterday with ambas
sadors of Arab countries in what U.S. officials
said was an effort to persuade them that the
campaign against Khadafy is in their interest.

Meanwhile in Tripoli, the Libyan government
charged yesterday that President Reagan's im
position of economic sanctions appeared aimed
at toppling the regime of Col. Moammar
Khadafy.
Reagan's call for an international boycott of
Libya was "tantamount politically to a declaration
of war," the official Tripoli radio declared.
"The American president has treated the
Libyan people with a barbarism which exceeds
anything we had become accustomed to from
past American administrations," the broadcast
said.
Reaction was muted among the 1,500 or so
Americans living in Libya, who were ordered by
Reagan to leave the country by the end of the
month.
Several American workers contacted by West
ern journalists here reacted negatively to
Reagan's executive order, announced Tuesday,
directing U.S. companies to break off all eco
nomic dealings with Libya and ordering all
Americans out of this North African country.
Some of them said they had gone from un
employment in the United States to high-paying
jobs in Libya's oil industry and would be sad if
forced to leave.
