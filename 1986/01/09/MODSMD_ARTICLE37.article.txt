# Stock Prices Take Record Plunge
## Dow Jones index drops 39 points, the most ever in one day 
### 
Stock prices yesterday took their
biggest single-day plunge in his
tory.
Analysts said the 39-point fall in
the widely followed Dow Jones In
dustrial Average was sparked by in
vestor fears that the decline in in
terest rates was over.
The decline was exacerbated,
analysts said, because some
computer-directed programs that
call for the sale of large blocks of
stock by brokerage houses and
other well-heeled investors were
triggered in the last hour of trading
on the New York Stock Exchange.
Nearly 40 million shares of stock
changed hands in the last 60
minutes before the final bell rang to

end trading for the day.
The Dow Jones Industrial
Average closed down 39.10 points
at 1526.61. Yesterday's absolute
decline was bigger than the 38.33-
point tumble the Dow Jones
average took on Oct. 28, 1929,
during the collapse of stock prices
that ushered in the Great Depres
sion.
But the 1929 decline represented
a 12.8 percent loss in the Dow
average, compared with 2.5 per
cent yesterday. The Dow average
would have had to fall about 200
points yesterday to approximate
the scale of the 1929 drop.
The sharpest rise in the Dow in
dex occurred on Nov. 3, 1982,

when it jumped 43.41 points.
Yesterday's decline in stock
prices was not confined to the tradi
tional "blue chips" that make up the
Dow average. Standard & Poor's
index of 500 stocks fell 5.83 points
to 207.97, a record one-day decline
for that gauge as well. The index of
all stocks traded on the New York
Stock Exchange, the most impor
tant securities trading floor in the
world, fell 2.94 points to 120.2.
About 180 million shares of stock
were traded on the New York
Stock Exchange between 9:30 a.m.
and 4 p.m., with about 22 percent
of that coming in the last hour.
Analysts said it was unclear
whether yesterday's steep decline

was a temporary setback to the
latest surge in stock prices that
began four months ago or was a
prelude to a sustained decline in the
price of securities. But most agreed
that stock prices have risen so high
that speculative investors — those
seeking quick gains and more skit
tish during inevitable price declines
than buyers in search of long-term
investments — are becoming a
major factor in the stock market.
Despite yesterday's steep
plunge, the Dow Jones average of
30 big industrial companies remains
closer to the record high that it set
Tuesday than to its level in early
December, before it closed above
1,500 for the first time.
