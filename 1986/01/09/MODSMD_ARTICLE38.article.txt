Implants Restricted
WASHINGTON — Artificial heart implants
must comply with new monitoring and report
ing restrictions that allow them to continue
only with case-by-case approval from the gov
ernment, the Food and Drug Administration
announced yesterday.
Adopting the recommendations of a govern
ment advisory panel, the FDA imposed the re
strictions because of a history of strokes and
other complications among patients who have
received the controversial Jarvik-7 artificial
heart.
The new requirements include the filing of
detailed reports every three months on the
condition of each patient in whom the device is
implanted permanently.
The FDA also banned emergency use of a
small version of the Jarvik-7 until its safety can
be reviewed.
Three of the six persons who have received
artificial hearts have died after serious compli
cations, and two of the survivors are suffering
similar problems, leading critics to question

the quality of life for those who receive the
hearts permanently.
Spray Could Stop Cold
BOSTON — In a major advance against the
common cold, scientists reported today that an
experimental anti-viral nasal spray, if used
daily for a week, can often prevent the spread
of colds among household members.
In clinical trials involving more than 150
families, the powerful drug, called alpha-2-
interferon, was effective nearly 80 percent of
the time against the most common group of
viruses that cause these infections, according
to researchers at the University of Virginia
Medical Center and the University of Adelaide
in Australia. They published their studies sep
arately in the new issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine.
Schering-Plough, Inc. of Madison, N.J.,
which manufactures the drug and sponsored
the studies, has asked the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to approve the nasal spray for

sale by prescription. It is not known when such
approval might come. The review process
could take up to several years.
Jobless Rate Drops
WASHINGTON — The nation's civilian un
employment rate dropped from 7 to 6.9 per
cent in December, its lowest level in nearly six
years, the Labor Department reported yester
day.
The unemployment rate, which was 7.4 per
cent at the start of 1985, averaged 7.2 percent
over the year, the lowest average during the
Reagan Administration. The rate was 7.5 per
cent when President Reagan took office and
rose to a post-war high of 10.7 percent exactly
three years ago.
During 1985, the unemployment picture im
proved for women, men and whites, but it did
not improve for blacks, teens and Hispanics,
the Labor Department said.
