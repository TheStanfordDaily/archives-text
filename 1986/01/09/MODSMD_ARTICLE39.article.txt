Uranus' Sixth Moon
PASADENA — A sixth moon orbiting
Uranus has been discovered by the
Voyager 2 spacecraft, and up to 18 more might
be found as the probe speeds toward its close
encounter with the gaseous planet, NASA said
yesterday.
"We expect to see up to 18 tiny moons shep
herding the nine known rings" that circle the
solar system's third-largest planet, said Ellis
Miner, deputy Voyager project scientist at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administra
tion's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
Hints of the tiny, newly discovered moon,
temporarily designated as 1985 U1 until it is
formally named, were detected in long
exposure photographs taken in late December
by Voyager's supertelephoto television
camera, NASA said in a prepared statement.
The moon is only about 45 miles in diameter
and orbits about 37,500 miles from the top of
Uranus' atmosphere, making it"the innermost

moon and certainly the smallest," said JPL
spokeswoman Mary Beth Murrill.
Senator Reregisters
SACRAMENTO — State Sen. Milton Marks
of San Francisco — for three decades the most
liberal voting Republican in the California
Legislature — formally reregistered as a Dem
ocrat yesterday.
Senate Democrats greeted Marks with a 10-
foot-long "Welcome Uncle Miltie" banner and
immediately elected him as their caucus chair
man, the third-ranking party post in the Sen
ate, while Republicans shrugged that they
were merely getting rid of a headache.
"You can't lose something you never had,"
added Senate Republican Caucus Chairman
John Seymour of Anaheim. "He's always been
a Democrat. His voting record shows that. His
(district) registration shows that. He's just
come out of the closet."
Marks' switch boosts the Democratic

majority in the Senate to 26-14 over
Republicans, just one short of the two-thirds
majority needed for veto overrides and enact
ment of the budget and many major bills.
Insurance Reform
SACRAMENTO — Assembly Speaker
Willie Brown, in a televised address yesterday,
proposed creating a board to review insurance
rates and a state fund to insure cities and
counties that can't find liability coverage.
The San Francisco Democrat, whose post is
second in power only to that of Republican
Gov. George Deukmejian, said he would per
sonally ask representatives of the insurance in
dustry, lawyer groups and all other parties in
volved in the insurance crisis to negotiate
reforms.
He said later that he and other Democrats
will introduce 15 to 20 bills on insurance, in
cluding one to prohibit insurance firms from
cancelling policies and one to require reduced
insurance rates whenever benefits are cut.
