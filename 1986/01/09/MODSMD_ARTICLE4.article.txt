# Psych Course Changes Consummated
## Smaller size, more TAs for class affected by cheating scandal last spring 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
"Of course, there will be no cheating because
our honor code will be in operation."
— Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo,
winter '86 syllabus for Psychology 1
A class size reduced from 744 to 300 stu
dents is one of several changes Zimbardo, in
conjunction with Carolyn Lougee, associate
dean of Humanities and Sciences, has imple
mented in an effort to avoid duplicating the ex
tensive cheating that occurred in his Psychol
ogy 1 class during spring quarter.
Zimbardo yesterday described two addi
tional changes in his course, effective this
quarter.
"The exam format has changed," he said,
explaining that there will be no more weekly

quizzes on assigned material. "This will help
to take the pressure off."
The class, which in spring quarter
employed only one graduate teaching assis
tant, now has four, according to Zimbardo.
The modified ratio of TAs to students
will allow "smaller sections, with more per
sonal interactions," Zimbardo said.
The University Judicial Council suspended
nine students in November for unpermitted
collaboration on quizzes and exams during the
spring quarter class. The incident
represented the largest disciplinary action at
Stanford in at least 10 years.
Dane Lavin, head TA of this quarter's
class, said yesterday that although the
smaller class size should help reduce the risk
of cheating, it could not hope to eliminate the
problem.
"Opportunities will still exist to cheat," she

said. "But students should feel more involved
in the class."
Lavin added that one disadvantage stem
ming from smaller enrollment will be fewer
students available for experiments conducted
by psychology graduate students. Each stu
dent in Psychology 1 is required to volunteer
for five hours of such experiments.
Some students, in addition, feel it is unfair
to limit the class size and thus make it
impossible for many to take the course.
"I'm pretty disgruntled," said senior Dave
Konuch yesterday, one of those unable to en
roll in the class. "3ecause of the cheaters, I
didn't get to take the class."
Senior Tom Wilder, who is registered in
the course, was sympathetic.
"They ought to offer two sections," Wilder
said yesterday. "They've done it with cal
culus. Why not psych.?"

Wilder admitted, however, that the smaller
class size would probably discourage cheat
ing, as did freshman Julie Whidman, also en
rolled in the class.
"It's still crowded, but managable," Whid
man said. "And Zimbardo is dynamic enough
so that people don't feel overwhelmed."
Whidman added that the publicity given the
cheating scandal will also discourage dis
honest students.
"People will be looking for cheaters," she
said.
Zimbardo emphasized that although the
new modifications will help combat cheating,
the key to its elimination lies within the seg
ment of the Honor Code which mandates the
reporting of dishonest students.
"No students will admit to cheating," Zim
bardo said, "But will they be willing to turn in
other students?"
"Of course, there will be no cheating because
our honor code will be in operation."
