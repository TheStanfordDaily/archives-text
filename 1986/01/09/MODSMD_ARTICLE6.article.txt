# Comp Sci Appeal Wanes Nationally

Stanford's computer science faculty approved
a motion on Tuesday to create an undergraduate
major in the discipline, a move that contrasts
with a national trend toward fewer students
majoring in computer science.
"Students have a better understanding of what
computer science is, and, more importantly,
what it is not," according to Robert Aiken, a pro
fessor of computer and information sciences at
Temple University.

That heightened understanding appears to be
making a lot of college officials happy. Computer
science, the fastest-growing major nationwide in
recent years, has created problems for univer
sities, which have been faced with the difficulties
of a burgeoning field attracting students for what
Aiken called the "wrong reasons," as reported
by The Chronicle of Higher Education.
Evidence that computer science is an attrac
tive major comes from figures that show that un
dergraduate computer science majors awarded
across the country spurted from less than 1 per
cent in 1977-78 to 2.5 percent in 1982-83, the
last year for which numbers are available. Com

puter science degrees were awarded to nearly
25,000 graduating seniors that year.
The popularity of the major has proven to be
more of a bane than a blessing to many college
officials. Institutions frequently have had to start
up their computer science departments out of
the blue, molding them from mathematics and
electrical engineering departments.
The newness of the major has trapped many
colleges in a financial bind. Faced with the heavy

expenses of purchasing new equipment and at
tracting computer science graduates away from
the lucrative industry, many institutions were
ambivalent about the growth in the major.
The trend toward slower growth is a result of
changes in the student population as well as
deliberate institutional strategies to divert stu
dents away from a major they fear is dampening
intellectual diversity, according to college offi
cials.
The slowdown in the growth of computer sci
ence will result in a gradual plateau in the num
ber of students taking the major, according to
John Hamblen, a professor of computer science
at the University of Missouri at Rolla who tracks
enrollment and employment trends in the field.
Hamblen said the number of undergraduate
degrees awarded in the field should peak at
around 50,000 in 1986-87.
The computer industry has both slowed down
and diversified in recent years, and that has sig
nalled a change in the attitudes of students and
universities toward the major.
Students are learning as early as high school
that the industry is a challenging and difficult in
which to get involved, according to officials.
Statistics from the Cooperative Institutional
Research Program's annual survey of freshmen
show that the number of students who said they
