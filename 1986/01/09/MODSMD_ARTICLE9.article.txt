The Red Hot Chili Peppers, a power-funk
band, will rock Memorial Auditorium on Friday,
Jan. 17 for the first time since 1978, when Tom
Petty and the Heartbreakers played there.
Warm-up band for the 8 p.m. show will be The
Uptones. The Stanford Concert Network is or
ganizing the performance.
"It promises to shake the foundations of an
otherwise placid Stanford campus," said Jim
Durkin, promotions manager for the Concert
Network.
Durkin said the network is currently negotiat
ing with other artists for the remainder of this
school year, but would not disclose their names
until the deals are finalized.
Concert Network Director Patrick O'Hara
said the student-run group is trying to get the
Grateful Dead to play at Stanford again.
"We would like them to play Stanford. We
have been in contact with them, but nothing is
definite, yet," O'Hara said.
Also in the works is a benefit concert to be
held here, according to Rhonda Trotter of the
Stanford Volunteer Network. If such a concert
were to take place, it would be a joint venture
between the Volunteeer Network and the Con
cert Network, she said.

Obstacles have plagued the network from its
inception, including problems in getting venues
and dates that coincide with the availibility of
performers, according to Suzanne Becker, advi
ser to the network and program coordinator at
Tresidder Union.
Contemporary groups tend to give notice of
their schedule about six weeks to two months in
advance, long after the University and many
other campus organizations have booked all the
auditoriums on campus, Becker said..
"We were very lucky to get Mem Aud," she
said.
A lack of flexibility in University rules
prevents the network from obtaining big-name
groups, and the network's lack of credibility
prevents it from working around these rules,
O'Hara told The Daily in November.
Becker yesterday agreed, saying that "getting
more established and gaining credibility only
helps."
Becker added that it is hard to tell whether the
history of the previous organization that coor
dinated concerts at Stanford has plagued the net
work.
That group established a large deficit and was
eventually prohibited from organizing shows.
Its history is "certainly" in the minds of people
both inside and outside the University, according
to Becker.
A positive step for the network has been its

recent ability to communicate with Frost Amphi
theatre for the use of its facilities. The network
has a "hold" on a series of dates this spring for
the use of Frost.
Another step is the increase in communication
between O'Hara and Lois Wagner, director of
Events and Services, according to Becker. Wag
ner has increased the network's flexibility of
available dates, Becker said.
The Red Hot Chili Peppers, according to
Durkin, claim their style "breaks the barriers be
tween punk and pop, rap and rock, funk and
fun."
Rolling Stone described the band as "actually
irreverent, punky rockers with a jones for
rhythm-and-blues vernacular (lyrical and musi
cal) and a commitment to humor, variety and un
bridled stylistic independence."
Lindy Goetz, manager of the Red Hot Chili
Peppers, warns all ticket holders to get ready for
"the wildest show they've ever seen in their
life."
He described the band as a "visual act, full of
non-stop madness. ... It is powerful, entertain
ing, wild."
"Be prepared," he said, noting that a motto of
the Red Hot Chili Peppers is to "rock out with
your cock out." The band sometimes comes out
on stage "stark naked" with a sock over one part
of their anatomy, according to Goetz.
