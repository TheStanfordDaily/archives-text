# Black Activist Praises King, Blasts Reagan
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Black activist Julian Bond said here last night that the
civil rights movement spearheaded by Martin Luther
King, Jr. in the 1950s and 1960s is now "in some dan
ger of being destroyed."
Bond's speech, delivered to more than 250 people at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, marked the beginning of a se
ries of campus events this month commemorating the
Jan. 15 birthday of the civil rights leader, who was slain
by James Earl Ray in 1968.
Bond, a Georgia state senator, praised King for
giving "an eloquent voice to the aspirations of black
Americans," stating that because of his efforts, "we
live in a world that is better today, a world with a little
less hate."
Bond, however, stopped far short of calling the work
of King complete.
Criticizing the policies of the Reagan Administration,
Bond called the president "an amiable incompetent
who clearly intends to take the federal government out
of the business of equal opportunity."
"We've seen human rights traded for mineral
rights," Bond said, stating that there has been a
"nullification of the needs of the needy" in the United
States.
Although Bond cited an increasing number of black
politicians now holding office, he said the "relative con
dition (of blacks) has actually managed to get worse."
