# Black Activist Praises King, Blasts Reagan
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Black activist Julian Bond said here last night that the
civil rights movement spearheaded by Martin Luther
King, Jr. in the 1950s and 1960s is now "in some dan
ger of being destroyed."
Bond's speech, delivered to more than 250 people at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, marked the beginning of a se
ries of campus events this month commemorating the
Jan. 15 birthday of the civil rights leader, who was slain
by James Earl Ray in 1968.
Bond, a Georgia state senator, praised King for
giving "an eloquent voice to the aspirations of black
Americans," stating that because of his efforts, "we
live in a world that is better today, a world with a little
less hate."
Bond, however, stopped far short of calling the work
of King complete.
Criticizing the policies of the Reagan Administration,
Bond called the president "an amiable incompetent
who clearly intends to take the federal government out
of the business of equal opportunity."
"We've seen human rights traded for mineral
rights," Bond said, stating that there has been a
"nullification of the needs of the needy" in the United
States.
Although Bond cited an increasing number of black
politicians now holding office, he said the "relative con
dition (of blacks) has actually managed to get worse."

Civil rights activist Julian Bond, a state senator from Georgia, speaks to an audi
ence of more than 200 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium last night.
Bond cited inadequate health care
for the poor and an increase in in
fant mortality as symptoms of Ad
ministration policies.
"There are more black people
poor today than at anytime in the
last 20 years," Bond said.
The Reagan Administration has
"abused, disregarded and ignored
the civil rights records that protect
our people. . . . They have been
the violators of civil rights instead
of its enforcers," he said.
Bond fielded several questions
after his 40-minute speech, includ
ing ones on the rising crime rate
and the increasing number of
single-parent households headed by
black women.
At a rally in White Plaza earlier in
the day, Bond told a crowd of more
than 200 to continue to fight the
"injustices that were with us when
(King) was alive and are with us as
we reflect on his life today."
He urged Stanford students to
"make King proud that he spoke
twice on this campus" and make
sure that the federal observance of
the slain civil rights activist's
birthday doesn't "become just some
man's birthday."
Recalling the civil rights move
ments of the 19605, Bond said the
effort of the time "was a mass
movement that did not depend on
leadership figures ... a mass
movement moving in unison against
the targets of the day."
The Black Student Union (BSU),
which sponsored the rally, selected
Bond for the annual event because
of "his role with the civil rights
movement in the past and his con
tinued presence in the movement,"
said BSU secretary Amanda Kemp.
