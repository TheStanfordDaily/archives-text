# University Removes Protester's Photo
## 
### ERIC HEALY Staff writer 
When Ron Nissimov discovered
that a Daily photograph of his Octo
ber arrest at an Old Union anti
apartheid demostration was in his
loan collection file at Student Ac
counting, the Bursar's Office took
prompt action to correct what it
calls "a mistake," according to Bur
sar Jon Erickson.
In a Nov. 27 letter to The Daily,
Nissimov wrote: "I was arrested
for committing civil disobedience
Oct. 16. A photograph of me sitting
in Old Union appeared in The Daily

the next day. Last week, I went to
Student Accounting to clear up a
hold on my registration. ... To my
amazement, there was that same
photograph stapled to my financial
records."
Immediately after reading the
letter, Erickson phoned Nissimov
to apologize and assure him that the
photo would be removed from his
file. Why or by whom the photo ap
peared in the Bursar's Office
remains a mystery, Erickson said.
"I'm really glad that the Univer
sity responded to the letter and
removed (the picture)," Nissimov
said yesterday. "I'd like to know
how it got there, but I'm not sure

whether that can be found out."
He claimed the picture was put in
the file to discredit him and said,
"There was no reason for it to be
there."
Noting that the clipping's pres
ence in Nissimov's file was "not ap
propriate," Erickson said, "Any
news items about civil disobedience
and political activity have no place in
the collection file. ... It was news
to me that my people were collect
ing these types of articles."
Loan collectors save articles as a
method of keeping track of those
who are in default and leave the
Stanford area, according to Erick
son. This system has helped to

bring many University loan defaul
ters to justice. Nissimov, however,
was neither out of the area nor in
default.
To prevent future such incidents,
any "improper" items will be
removed from files "as we come
across them," Erickson said. This
practice is more reasonable than
combing through the thousands of
files in the Bursar's Office, he said.
Since Nissimov's letter to The
Daily, several students have gone
to the Student Accounting Office to
inspect their files, according to both
Erickson and Nissimov. To date,
none have reported finding any ob
jectionable items.
