### BRYAN WALSER Staff writer 
Seven students will receive
Dean's Awards for Service at a
ceremony on Wednesday.
The awards, administered by
the Office of Student Affairs, are
given each quarter to students
who have performed extraordi
nary service for the Stanford
community.
The recipients of the awards
for fall quarter 1985 are Carlos
Montoya, Scott Reisch, Nicola-
Jane McNeill, Kim Card and the
group of Daniel A. Coles, R.
Richard Banks and Kim Thomas.
They received the awards for
activities as diverse as Reisch's
work in "rescuing Stanford-in-
Government from bankruptcy"
and the implementation of a cul
tural enrichment program for
youth in East Palo Alto by Coles,
Banks and Thomas, according to
the offical citations that will ap
pear, along with photographs of
the winners, in the lobby of Old
Union.
Surprise was the primary reac
tion of the award's recipients.
McNeill, who received the
award for her work as an officer

and fund-raiser for the last year's
national champion Stanford Bad
minton Team, said that she
learned of her nomination through
a letter asking her to contact
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons.
"Since I am an RA (in the
Suites), I thought it was just Res
Ed stuff. When I found out I had
been given the award ... I was
tickled pink,"McNeill said.
Card, who received the award
for working with the Minority
Outreach Program at the Career
Planning and Placement Center
and the Theme Associate and RA
program at Casa Zapata, said that
she was pleased but humble at
the news of her selection.
"It's a nice award to get, espe
cially since I didn't even know I
had been nominated," Card said.
"I'm honored, but there are lots
of students who deserve the
award, who run these (minority)
student organizations all by them
selves, but get no recognition."
Montoya, co-chair of the 1985
Chicano Orientation and RA in
Casa Zapata, was unavailable for
comment.
Selections for winter quarter
recipients of the award will be
made at the end of this month.
