Grill
All Daily staffers are cordially re
quested to attend Monday's noon
grill session, where the candidates
for editor in chief, Clint HighfilJ and
Beth Kleid, will be the main course.
Rumor has it that the Senator
will wear a tie and the female con
tender will wear a skirt.

Just rake them over the coals for
crisply burned editors a la Daily.
Vote
Voting for the next editor in chief
of The Daily will take place after the
grill session, from 1 p.m. to 10 p.m.
on Monday.
All Daily staffers are urged to
vote.
Results will be announced that
night.
