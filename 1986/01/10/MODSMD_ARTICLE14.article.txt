## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper To a Sober New Year 
### 
This holiday season, friends didn't let friends
drive drunk.
The results are in, and it is clear the nation saw
the lowest number of drunk-driving related acci
dents and deaths in years. This fact in itself is just
cause for a New Year's celebration.
The all-time low in drunk-driving cases received
the celebration it deserved from newspapers in
major cities across the country.
"No alcohol-tied highway deaths in area for New
Year's," read a banner headline in the San Diego
Union on Jan. 2. In San Diego, only six people were
arrested for drunk driving on New Year's Eve.
The Bay Area had similar success. The San Fran
cisco Chronicle called this New Year's the "quietest,
soberest on record." There were only two serious
drunk-driving related accidents in the Bay Area
during the 24-hour New Year's period beginning at 6
p.m. on New Year's Eve.
In the Chicago Tribune, this New Year's Eve was
described as "relatively calm, like a heavy Saturday
night." And The Denver Post reported that
Colorado experienced the lowest number of drunk
driving fatalities in two decades.
The cheerful statistics were a welcome replace
ment to newspaper reports of accidents or deaths.
This New Year's was a memorable holiday — in
stead of a holiday of memorials.
Certainly, the low number of drunk driving acci
dents and H#»qths were related to a low number of

drunk drivers. Why the lower number of drunk
drivers this year? There were increased law en
forcement deterrents, such as sobriety checkpoints
set-up across the country, and these tests were
backed by Supreme Court support.
And states, such as Illinois, have adopted tougher
drunk driving penalties, which also serve as power
ful deterrents.
But it seems that new public attitudes about
drunk driving have had the greatest impact. Highly
publicized finger-wagging has worked. The efforts
of Department of Transportation ad campaigns and
groups such as MADD (Mothers Against Drunk
Drivers) have been successful. Social disapproval
and social programs against drunk driving have
made the difference.
This New Year's there was an abundance of proof
of the increased social concern. From cab compan
ies offering free rides home to intoxicated people, to
7-11 stores offering free sobering-up cups of coffee,
to bartenders wearing "I'm Responsible" buttons,
people were trying to keep drunk drivers off the na
tion's streets. These efforts must be congratulated.
The new year is a time to make fresh new starts,
and develop new trends. The sizable decrease in
nationwide drunk driving on New Year's Eve is a
trend that can set the tone for 1986. After all, a
drunk-driving related death is tragic all the time —
not just during a holiday.
