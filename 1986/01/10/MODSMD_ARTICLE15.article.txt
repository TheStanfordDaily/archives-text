Kermit the Frog
Rings In 1986
To celebrate the New Year, my
wife and I opened a bottled of
Martinelli's cider, while Kermit
counted down in Time's Square.
The heady phenomenon of that
little, insecure, adolescent front
leading a nation — and for all I
kjiow the world by international
hookup — through this ritual Mo
ment, stirred a few reflections:
Among the few truly impressive
artists in our time, one must count
the creators of comic universes,
like Groucho Marx, Walt Disney,
Charles Schulz and the fellow who
dreamed up the Muppets, including
prominently Kermit.
The humble insiginificance, the
near-nothingness of their central
creations, is to the micro-macro
point of that drunken totality. Ker
mit is not only a frog, he is child
like and, as I noted, insecure, with
a wavering pathos in his voice (the
same that makes Jack Lemon an
other of our Salingeresque
heroes). Or think of Groucho
opening his mouth cosmically — a
sort of Black Hole of distress —
and wailing "Waaagon wheels."
One could embrace a great deal
of Western art and literature in this
funny idea, and indeed an overall
pattern of reality.
; Today, in the San Francisco
Chronicle, I read about the exciting
new theory that the world is
formed out of bubbles (caused by
chain reactions of novas).
So what else is new? The
visionary artists have always
known that was the essential shape
of things, e.g. Shakespeare at the
beginning of "Macbeth" or the end
of "The Tempest." It suffices to
open a bottle of Martinelli's. . . .

Pursue Alleged
Torture of Cat
I got a call some weeks back
from a friend of mine. There was
hesitation in his voice and he
apologized for what he was about
to relate. He stammered and stut
tered but he finally told me his
fellow graduate students at Stan
ford had abused an animal.
A six-month-old kitten was
found by her owner at 2 a.m. in a
design loft on campus. She had
been spray-painted, then dipped in
paint and left to die. She was still
alive, but semi-conscious, unable
to move becuase the paint had
dried. The vet who treated her
said that if she survived she may
have cerebral dysfunction, skin
ailments, respiratory problems and
visual complications. She has lost
her fur. My friend wanted to know
what protection could be afforded
the kitten and what action could be
taken against those responsible.

I plugged into the area animal
resource services and was stunned
at the history behind their
responses. "Oh no, not another
animal prank at Stanford." I was to
learn that this sort of sadism oc
curs regularly at this leading uni
versity. My return calls to my
friend went unanswered. When I
did get through to him two days
later, however, he no longer
wanted to pursue the issue. Nor
did the woman who owned the
animal. They felt that the students
involved, whose identities were
known, had been sufficiently
annoyed and embarrassed already.
I am deeply concerned for the
welfare of this animal, whose
owner will not stand up for its
(her?) rights.
I am disgusted at the indif
ference of other students who
likewise don't want to be bothered.
I am horrified that the two per
petrators are out there feeling no
consequence and carrying on with
impunity.
It is hard to comprehend such
cruelty, such slaughter of noble
sensibility. But the evidence is
there; it is in the logbooks of the
animal resource offices. To
tolerate base and unnatural behav
ior is to condone it, is to devalue
society. The question is not of
language or technological capability
or tissue, the question is: Can they
suffer?
Morality extends beyond mere
humaneness — the prevention of
pain and terror in a living being —
to a consideration of that being's
right to live freely and carry on its
ancestral bloodline.

Facts Missing
From Obituary
It seems to me that you omitted
two rather important facts from
your brief obituary of Christopher
Isherwood (The Daily, Jan. 6).
Isherwood was openly gay in
both his life and work. As he put it
in 1972, "I have written about
homosexuals in my novels and in
taking up the cause of one
minority, that of homosexuals
against the dictatorship of
heterosexuals, I have spoken out
for all minorities."
I believe it is also customary to
mention immediate survivors in
obituaries. Isherwood is survived
by his lover, (not his "companion,"
as the San Francisco Chronicle put
it, nor his "friend," as per the
Peninsula Times-Tribune) of 33
years, the portrait painter Don
Bachardy.
The truth of gay peoples' experi
ence is so often denied in life. Is it
not time we at least admit it in
death?

opening his mouth cosmically — a
sort of Black Hole of distress —

Professor of French
Pursue Alleged
Torture of Cat
I got a call some weeks back
from a friend of mine. There was
hesitation in his voice and he
apologized for what he was about
to relate. He stammered and stut
tered but he finally told me his
fellow graduate students at Stan
ford had abused an animal.
A six-month-old kitten was
found by her owner at 2 a.m. in a
design loft on campus. She had
been spray-painted, then dipped in
paint and left to die. She was still
alive, but semi-conscious, unable
to move becuase the paint had
dried. The vet who treated her
said that if she survived she may
have cerebral dysfunction, skin
ailments, respiratory problems and
visual complications. She has lost
her fur. My friend wanted to know
what protection could be afforded
the kitten and what action could be
taken against those responsible.

I plugged into the area animal
resource services and was stunned
at the history behind their
responses. "Oh no, not another
animal prank at Stanford." I was to
learn that this sort of sadism oc
curs regularly at this leading uni
versity. My return calls to my
friend went unanswered. When I
did get through to him two days
later, however, he no longer
wanted to pursue the issue. Nor
did the woman who owned the
animal. They felt that the students
involved, whose identities were
known, had been sufficiently
annoyed and embarrassed already.
I am deeply concerned for the
welfare of this animal, whose
owner will not stand up for its
(her?) rights.
I am disgusted at the indif
ference of other students who
likewise don't want to be bothered.
I am horrified that the two per
petrators are out there feeling no
consequence and carrying on with
impunity.
It is hard to comprehend such
cruelty, such slaughter of noble
sensibility. But the evidence is
there; it is in the logbooks of the
animal resource offices. To
tolerate base and unnatural behav
ior is to condone it, is to devalue
society. The question is not of
language or technological capability
or tissue, the question is: Can they
suffer?
Morality extends beyond mere
humaneness — the prevention of
pain and terror in a living being —
to a consideration of that being's
right to live freely and carry on its
ancestral bloodline.

Facts Missing
From Obituary
It seems to me that you omitted
two rather important facts from
your brief obituary of Christopher
Isherwood (The Daily, Jan. 6).
Isherwood was openly gay in
both his life and work. As he put it
in 1972, "I have written about
homosexuals in my novels and in
taking up the cause of one
minority, that of homosexuals
against the dictatorship of
heterosexuals, I have spoken out
for all minorities."
I believe it is also customary to
mention immediate survivors in
obituaries. Isherwood is survived
by his lover, (not his "companion,"
as the San Francisco Chronicle put
it, nor his "friend," as per the
Peninsula Times-Tribune) of 33
years, the portrait painter Don
Bachardy.
The truth of gay peoples' experi
ence is so often denied in life. Is it
not time we at least admit it in
death?

Kermit the Frog
Rings In 1986
To celebrate the New Year, my
wife and I opened a bottled of
Martinelli's cider, while Kermit
counted down in Time's Square.
The heady phenomenon of that
little, insecure, adolescent front
leading a nation — and for all I
kjiow the world by international
hookup — through this ritual Mo
ment, stirred a few reflections:
Among the few truly impressive
artists in our time, one must count
the creators of comic universes,
like Groucho Marx, Walt Disney,
Charles Schulz and the fellow who
dreamed up the Muppets, including
prominently Kermit.
The humble insiginificance, the
near-nothingness of their central
creations, is to the micro-macro
point of that drunken totality. Ker
mit is not only a frog, he is child
like and, as I noted, insecure, with
a wavering pathos in his voice (the
same that makes Jack Lemon an
other of our Salingeresque
heroes). Or think of Groucho
opening his mouth cosmically — a
sort of Black Hole of distress —
and wailing "Waaagon wheels."
