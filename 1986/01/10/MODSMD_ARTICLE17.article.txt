# The
						Challenge of Realizing King's Dream

He said, "We as a people will get to the promised
land." Nelson Mandela says,"The struggle is my
life." Tome the meaning, tradition and legacy of
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 's life are not those of
a conservative who is insensitive or a liberal with a
seasonal or part-time commitment, but those of a
liberator whose total life and soul and essence are
committed to the freedom and dignity of all God's
children. Neither race nor color qualifies or dis
qualifies one from identifying with and following
in that tradition.
- Rev. Jesse Jackson
The above words succinctly summarize the
essence of King's legacy and pose a challenge to
each and every one of us today. King was great

because he dedicated his life to the struggle for
freedom. His life stands as a reminder of the
commitment that the struggle for justice
demands. In the final analysis, the greatness of
King the man is inextricably bound to the efforts
of the masses of the people to create a more just
and democratic society.
Too often, history books focus on individuals
as the shapers of history. In reality, it is the
struggle of the majority of the people that moves
history forward. King, as an individual, did not
end legal desegregation in the South. It took the
courage of Rosa Parks and the sacrifice of the
entire black community of Montgomery to win

the bus boycott and eliminate the back-of-the
bus seating policy.
King's greatness lay in his ability to articulate
the sentiments of the people. It was not simply
his eloquence, but the power of the message and
the intensity of the spirit of the people for whom
King spoke that moved America. And ultimately
it was the use of "creative tension" such as
demonstrations and civil disobedience that
forced this country to deal with its own injustice.
The mass struggle from which King arose
continues to this day. In many ways, things are
just as bad — if not worse — than they were 20
years ago. The poverty rate today is the highest
since 1965. Unemployment is almost twice the
rate of '65, and many of the gains that were won
in the '60s are being challenged by the Reagan
Administration and the country's move to the
right.
The struggle for a better society continues at
Stanford as well. In the past year that struggle
has intensified and escalated. If we wish to honor
the memory of King, then we should join in the
struggle on campus. Efforts to develop the
theme houses, establish an endowed chair of
Asian-American history, build up MEChA,
replace the Western Culture program with a
World Cultures program, win divestment and
make Stanford a sanctuary for Central American
refugees are all evidence that the Stanford com
munity continues to fight injustice, oppression
and racism.
All of us can play a role in these struggles. We
must recognize, however, that the impact of in
dividuals is limited. As King said, "To produce
change, people must be organized to work to
gether in units of power." Only through organ
ized, co-ordinated, well-planned activity will we
be able to bring about the desired changes.
Those changes that we seek must be far

reaching. King said, "There is a need for a radi
cal restructuring of the architecture of American
society." In thinking about how to carry on the
legacy of King, we should re-examine his vision.
King declared, "I am bold enough to dream of
a world where each person has three meals a day
for the body, culture and education for the mind,
and freedom, dignity and equality for the spirit."
The creation of that world is the challenge of our
generation.
