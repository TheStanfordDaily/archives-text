# Tax Bill Threatens Exempt Status

Federal tax changes that cancel the tax
exempt status of stipends for teaching and re
search assistants could cost 700 Stanford
graduate students as much as $460 a quarter,
the dean of graduate studies told the Faculty
Senate yesterday.
Elizabeth Traugott told the senate that Uni
versity administrators expected Congress to ex
tend the tax-exempt status for the stipends as it
had in previous years. However, that extension
was lost in the "chaos" of Congress's final 1985
session, she said.
University officials hope Congress will

reinstate the exemption, but contingency plans
are being made to withold taxes from students if
necessary, and possibly to increase the amount
of stipends to what they would be if they were
not taxed, Traugott said.
If Congress does not reinstate the exemption,
graduate research and teaching assistants whose
positions are not required for them to receive
their degrees would have to pay taxes on their
stipends, Traugott told the senate.
"For example, (the School of) Engineering
does not require students to be (TAs), and
therefore engineering students working as TAs
are for the most part not working for the
degree," Traugott said. "Similarly, many
master's students are not required to be TAs or

(residential assistants), and therefore their
stipends are taxable, too."
Because of the difficulty in developing payroll
programs to calculate proper withholdings,
Traugott said the University does not anticipate
any payroll withholding until at least the Feb. 21
checks, and may wait longer if it appears the ex
emption will fye reinstated.
Although she called the situation a "very dis
turbing" one, Traugott said it is only "the tip of
the iceberg for student financial aid," with the
pending tax bill in the House of Representatives
posing "a much tougher problem."
"The tax reform bill that will be considered
later this year calls for taxation of all stipends and
