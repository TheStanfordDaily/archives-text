## Jazz Jams in a New Music History Class 
### LESLIE WELLS 
Braun Music Center is displaying
a bright yellow poster that ad
vertises a class entitled "History of
Jazz."
You won't find it in "Courses and
Degrees." Nor does it appear in the
Winter Time Schedule, which was
already released last month when
the Music Department was working
out the funds and other administra
tive details.
Thanks to cooperative efforts
made by the Program Pilot in Jazz
and the Stanford Music Department
over the past two months, Music
Prof. Ted Gioia will teach the his
tory of jazz class this quarter.
• The "History of Jazz" is a prelimi
nary course with no prerequisite for
a two-part course entitled "Jazz
Theory" that will take place this
spring and fall.
Music Prof. Jim Nadel, director
of the Stanford Summer Jazz
Workshop, will teach "Jazz The
ory."
Since the Program Pilot in Jazz
and the Music Department began
working together last spring to in
stitute an academic jazz program,
progress has been made toward
their common goal. Together they
have sought to provide opportunity
for Stanford jazz musicians to play
in groups.

Nadel, also a member of the Pro
gram Pilot in Jazz, has organized
five groups for chamber music that
will begin this quarter and continue
in future quarters.
The program will bring in jazz ar
tists each year to the Stanford com
munity to give concerts.
This quarter the artist-in
residence will be Stan Getz, a
prominent jazz saxophonist from
New York City. His first perfor
mance will take place March 3.
The Program Pilot in Jazz bills it
self as a committee dedicated to
promoting jazz in the Stanford com
munity. Other members included are
Psychology Prof. William Dement ,
Art Prof. Nathan Oliveira, Director
of Athletics Andy Geiger and Stan
ford alumnus Ryland Kelly.
Having received his undergradu
ate education at Stanford and
having taught the past three years
in the Summer Jazz Workshop,
Gioia is familiar with the Stanford
community.
Gioia said of his class this quarter
that there is an "interest and a place
for a class like this at Stanford."
Gioia is a jazz pianist and has
written many articles on jazz for

music journals. He is currently in
the process of writing a book on the
aesthetics of jazz.
His goals for the class include to
give the student "a firm under
standing of what has happened in
music, who has been responsible
and what musical tools they used to
accomplish what has been done."
In teaching the "History of Jazz,"
Gioia said he intends to take "a
straightforward historical
chronological approach." The class
will study the social and cultural
contexts of jazz and the musicologi
cal area will be dwelled on as well to
give a preliminary understanding of
what makes the music work.
The course will begin at the roots
of jazz and move up to the present
day covering such prominent artists
as Louis Armstrong, Lester Young,
Charlie Parker, Bud Powell and
Miles Davis, among others.
Gioia's lectures will be supple

mented by reading from the
textbook, "The Making of Jazz,"
and listening to 30 to 40 recordings
inside and outside the classroom.
Getz will visit the class from time
to time to meet the class and an
swer questions.
Gioia said he will offer a choice
between a midterm exam and a
paper as well as a final exam, which
will consist of identification ques
tions and essays.
Gina Balestracci of the Music De
partment said, "the class will not be
a mick by any means."
Non-musicians need not fear,
however, for Gioia said he is

prepared equally for students with
and without musical background
and feels the class could be even
more stimulating to someone who
just loves the sound of jazz and is
curious about the major elements of
jazz music and history.
The class meets Monday, Wed
nesday and Friday at 11 a.m. in
Campbell Recital Hall and is worth
three units.
