## Kenya and Streep Save Flawed 'Out of Africa' Grand Scenery Enriches Plot 
### MARK TOMPKINS Staff writer 
The life of writer Isak Dinesen (1885-1962) has long
tempted filmmakers. Although Dinesen is known for
the enigmatic and enchanting short stories she wrote
from 1934 to her death, it is her personal life that
Hollywood has been sniffing at for years now, in the
belief that a good movie lurked underneath the cool
Nordic prose of Dinesen's memoir, "Out of Africa."
Born in Denmark, Karen Dinesen (Isak was her pen
name) married Baron Bror Blixen in 1913. That same
year the couple moved to British East Africa, modern
day Kenya, to start a coffee plantation. The marriage
was not a success, as the baron was a compulsive
philanderer. Dinesen eventually demanded that he
move out of the plantation after he gave her syphilis.
She then applied herself to running the plantation, but
into her life strode Denys Finch Hatton, a wealthy
British hunter and safari leader. Hatton became the
grand passion of Dinesen's life, although he himself
avoided making any definite commitment to her. In
1931 the romance came to a sad end when Hatton died
in a plane crash, at the same time that Dinesen's
plantation came to financial ruin. Deprived of both her
livelihood and her lover, Dinesen left Africa, never to
return. She had loved the continent, and returned to
Denmark with nothing, save the gift for storytelling
which was to be her one consolation in later years.
This is the story director Sydney Pollack and
screenwriter Kurt Luedtke use to fashion their movie
"Out of Africa." In addition to Dinesen's memoirs and
letters, Pollack and Luedtke have taken as source ma
terial Judith Thurman's biography "Isak Dinesen: The
Life of a Storyteller," and Errol Trzebinski's "Silence
Will Speak," a biography of Finch Hatton. For the most
part, Pollack and Luedtke are successful: they have
brought a challenging literary work to the screen with
great care and taste. In fact, the filmmakers' good in

tentions nearly doom the movie. This "Out of Africa" is
so tasteful and formal that there are few moments of
real passion, especially for a movie that runs two hours
and 35 minutes.
But fortunately this is more than an arid monument
to Sydney Pollack's technical proficiency. The film's
biggest assets are Meryl Streep as Karen Dinesen and
Klaus Maria Brandauer as Baron Bror Blixen. Bran
dauer attracted international attention in "Mephisto"
and went on to play the villain in Sean Connery's most
recent outing as James Bond, "Never Say Never
Again." It was Brandauer's charming villanry in the 007

film that persuaded Pollack to cast him as the adul
terous Bror Blixen, and the same charm is on display
here. Brandauer's baron is an amiable rogue,
impossible not to like; he and Karen remain friendly
even after she contracts syphilis from him.
Streep is at her luminous best as the fiercely intelli
gent Karen. She is required to be more physi
cally active here than in any of her previous roles, and
it's an interesting change. Certainly no one will be able
to accuse her of simply drawing upon the same old
stock of flighty mannerisms with which she's come to
be associated.

And then there is Redford. The actor's Finch Hatton
is not at all bad, except as a character. In real life,
Finch Hatton was somewhat eccentric, given to playing
pranks and reciting English poetry at odd moments.
But the movie's Finch Hatton is the strong, silent type
to the point of being wooden. In fairness to Redford,
the script is partly to blame here. For about the first
hour, Finch Hatton is given nothing interesting to say.
Screenwriter Kurt Luedtke seems to have decided
that good dialogue wasn't necessary, since he could
just rely on Redford's cheekbones to do all the work for
him. . •,
But Redford wakes up later on in the movie. His
Finch Hatton character is intended to be more at home
on the African plains than in civilized society. And Red->
ford's taciturn strength does serve him well out in the
grasslands, especially in one memorably tense safari
scene where Karen and Finch Hatton are menaced
by lions. Ultimately Finch Hatton is the character who
voices the film's most important lines, when he tells
the possessive Karen, "We're not owners herp,
Karen. We're just passing through." He is speaking of
Africa, but he is also describing his approach to
relationships.
Late in the film, signs of modernization and Wester
nization abound: Karen's African workers wear tail
ored jackets and railroad tracks are laid across the
plains. Finch Hatton is upset by the new technology,
fearing that the land's unique natural beauty will be
lost. But as this movie tells it, one can't help but
wonder if his concern is so noble. This is because there
are too many scenes of the two lovers romping through
beautiful landscapes, as if Africa was their personal
playground. Time and time again we see them picnick;-
ing on scenic hillsides while exotic animals look on
placidly. The viewer may wonder if he hasn't stumbled
into an episode of "Wild Kingdom" gone amok with sen
timentality.
In the end, Karen's affection for her lover and her
adopted land is moving. The filmmakers shamelessly
try to wring every dollop of sadness out of their ma
terial, so it's hard not to feel wistful when Karen leaves
her Eden. But then, Africa is photographed so gor
geously here that anyone would be sorry to leave. By
the time the credits roll on screen, one feels, if only for
a minute, Karen's sense of loss at leaving paradise
forever.

it's an interesting change. Certainly no one will be able
to accuse her of simply drawing upon the same old
stock of flighty mannerisms with which she's come to
be associated.

And then there is Redford. The actor's Finch Hatton
is not at all bad, except as a character. In real life,
Finch Hatton was somewhat eccentric, given to playing
pranks and reciting English poetry at odd moments.
But the movie's Finch Hatton is the strong, silent type
to the point of being wooden. In fairness to Redford,
the script is partly to blame here. For about the first
hour, Finch Hatton is given nothing interesting to say.
Screenwriter Kurt Luedtke seems to have decided
that good dialogue wasn't necessary, since he could
just rely on Redford's cheekbones to do all the work for
him. . •,
But Redford wakes up later on in the movie. His
Finch Hatton character is intended to be more at home
on the African plains than in civilized society. And Red->
ford's taciturn strength does serve him well out in the
grasslands, especially in one memorably tense safari
scene where Karen and Finch Hatton are menaced
by lions. Ultimately Finch Hatton is the character who
voices the film's most important lines, when he tells
the possessive Karen, "We're not owners herp,
Karen. We're just passing through." He is speaking of
Africa, but he is also describing his approach to
relationships.
Late in the film, signs of modernization and Wester
nization abound: Karen's African workers wear tail
ored jackets and railroad tracks are laid across the
plains. Finch Hatton is upset by the new technology,
fearing that the land's unique natural beauty will be
lost. But as this movie tells it, one can't help but
wonder if his concern is so noble. This is because there
are too many scenes of the two lovers romping through
beautiful landscapes, as if Africa was their personal
playground. Time and time again we see them picnick;-
ing on scenic hillsides while exotic animals look on
placidly. The viewer may wonder if he hasn't stumbled
into an episode of "Wild Kingdom" gone amok with sen
timentality.
In the end, Karen's affection for her lover and her
adopted land is moving. The filmmakers shamelessly
try to wring every dollop of sadness out of their ma
terial, so it's hard not to feel wistful when Karen leaves
her Eden. But then, Africa is photographed so gor
geously here that anyone would be sorry to leave. By
the time the credits roll on screen, one feels, if only for
a minute, Karen's sense of loss at leaving paradise
forever.


Meryl Streep stars as Karen Blixen, a wealthy Dane who starts life over as the owner of a coffee
plantation in Kenya in "Out of Africa."
The life of writer Isak Dinesen (1885-1962) has long
tempted filmmakers. Although Dinesen is known for
the enigmatic and enchanting short stories she wrote
from 1934 to her death, it is her personal life that
Hollywood has been sniffing at for years now, in the
belief that a good movie lurked underneath the cool
Nordic prose of Dinesen's memoir, "Out of Africa."
Born in Denmark, Karen Dinesen (Isak was her pen
name) married Baron Bror Blixen in 1913. That same
year the couple moved to British East Africa, modern
day Kenya, to start a coffee plantation. The marriage
was not a success, as the baron was a compulsive
philanderer. Dinesen eventually demanded that he
move out of the plantation after he gave her syphilis.
She then applied herself to running the plantation, but
into her life strode Denys Finch Hatton, a wealthy
British hunter and safari leader. Hatton became the
grand passion of Dinesen's life, although he himself
avoided making any definite commitment to her. In
1931 the romance came to a sad end when Hatton died
in a plane crash, at the same time that Dinesen's
plantation came to financial ruin. Deprived of both her
livelihood and her lover, Dinesen left Africa, never to
return. She had loved the continent, and returned to
Denmark with nothing, save the gift for storytelling
which was to be her one consolation in later years.
This is the story director Sydney Pollack and
screenwriter Kurt Luedtke use to fashion their movie
"Out of Africa." In addition to Dinesen's memoirs and
letters, Pollack and Luedtke have taken as source ma
terial Judith Thurman's biography "Isak Dinesen: The
Life of a Storyteller," and Errol Trzebinski's "Silence
Will Speak," a biography of Finch Hatton. For the most
part, Pollack and Luedtke are successful: they have
brought a challenging literary work to the screen with
great care and taste. In fact, the filmmakers' good in

tentions nearly doom the movie. This "Out of Africa" is
so tasteful and formal that there are few moments of
real passion, especially for a movie that runs two hours
and 35 minutes.
But fortunately this is more than an arid monument
to Sydney Pollack's technical proficiency. The film's
biggest assets are Meryl Streep as Karen Dinesen and
Klaus Maria Brandauer as Baron Bror Blixen. Bran
dauer attracted international attention in "Mephisto"
and went on to play the villain in Sean Connery's most
recent outing as James Bond, "Never Say Never
Again." It was Brandauer's charming villanry in the 007

film that persuaded Pollack to cast him as the adul
terous Bror Blixen, and the same charm is on display
here. Brandauer's baron is an amiable rogue,
impossible not to like; he and Karen remain friendly
even after she contracts syphilis from him.
Streep is at her luminous best as the fiercely intelli
gent Karen. She is required to be more physi
cally active here than in any of her previous roles, and
it's an interesting change. Certainly no one will be able
to accuse her of simply drawing upon the same old
stock of flighty mannerisms with which she's come to
