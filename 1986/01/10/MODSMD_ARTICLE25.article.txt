# Weak Story, Characters Are Film's Ruin

The poster art for "Out of Africa"
shows Robert Redford and Meryl
Streep sitting on a picturesque hil
lock overlooking an African plain.
They're not looking at each other;
they're staring obliquely past each
other, contemplating with polite in
terest the grass at their knees. A
while into this movie, I was staring
at the grass too; it was much more
interesting than watching Streep
and Redford's romance stagnate on
the screen. In this movie, these
two stars don't display a single
romantic impulse. They gaze at
each other with unfocused eyes,
and, as the poster suggests, never
connect with each other (or the au
dience) emotionally.
Director Sydney Pollack and
screenwriter Kurt Luedtke's
adaptation of Isak Dineson's book

"Out of Africa" culls information
from a variety of sources, notably
Dinesen's writings and Judith Thur
man's biography, "Isak Dinesen:
The Life of a Storyteller." The
filmmakers attempt to present a
more accurate account of Dinesen's
period in Africa than the author her
self apparently was interested in,
for her book doesn't even mention
her husband, or her reasons for
starting a coffee plantation in
British East Africa in 1914. In the
movie, Streep plays Karen Dinesen
(Isak was her "nom de plume"),
who marries the Baron Bror von
Blixen-Finecke (Klaus Maria Bran
dauer) — she seemingly for the
title, he expressly for the money —
with the intention of going to Kenya
to begin a dairy operation. When
Karen arrives, she finds that the
baron has already begun a coffee
plantation (with her money) on land
only marginally suitable for coffee
trees.

The movie is about her dropping
this adulterous playboy husband
and becoming involved with hunter
and guide Denys Finch Hatton
(Redford). In her book, Dinesen
romanticizes and idolizes Finch
Hatton; in the movie, director Pol
lack romanticizes and idolizes Red
ford, which is something quite dif
ferent. Karen was a skilled
enough writer to engage one emo
tionally, at the same time she was
turning her experiences in an un
abashed romantic idyll. Pollack
doesn't display a comparable skill.
He admits, "It's never been an
easy picture to solve; there's not
much narrative drive." No director
has more succinctly summed up the
problem with his film.
The movie suffers from an
excess of tastefulness, and Pollack
sidesteps the moments in the
movie where he can possibly whip
up some excitement or tension.

Scenes in which Karen and Finch
Hatton are lion hunting cry out for
dramatic flourish, but Pollack films
these episodes as smoothly and im
personally as his panoramic ariel
shots of the grasslands. A scene in
which Karen is fighting off flood
waters with the natives comes out
of the blue and has no follow up; the
dam they build bursts and we don't
see the consequences. And when
Karen and Finch Hatton finally
consummate their affair, after
having saved each other's life that
day, it's an unbelievably passionless
coupling. (The discrete fade-out on
this scene is almost redundant.)
Pollack is so fearful of grabbing us
in a crude way in these scenes that
he fails to grab us at all. His taste
fulness is stultifying, partly because
it dulls the relationships among the
characters, which lie at the heart of
Dinesen's memoir.


Robert Redford is Denys Finch Hatton, a British hunter who
prefers the wilds of Africa to European society.
The movie "Out of Africa"
soft-pedals the rather imperial
attitude Karen takes to the
Kikuyu and Somali natives on
her land. But we also don't get a
sense of the fondness she dis
plays for them in her book; the
personalities she describes are
more engaging than Pollack's en
nobling shots of stoic native
faces might suggest. Pollack
uses the natives solely for their
fatalistic attitude toward life, and
this attitude is what they have to
teach Karen. The movie is
really about Karen trying to take
charge of her life in Africa, trying
to "make the plantation work,"
trying to help and school the
natives, and trying to tie down
Finch Hatton to some kind of
home life. Her attempts to direct
her destiny in Africa are pre
sented as naive and impossible;
she's trying to tame the wild, un
conquerable spirit of the con
tinent itself.
The movie runs into its big
gest problems when it tries to
pass Redford off as the wild, un
conquerable spirit of Africa. In
the book, Finch Hatton is British
and entertainingly human, but
Redford apparently doesn't play
human beings anymore; he plays
ideals. In this film and in "The
Natural," Redford floats above
the other actors, swathed in a
gauzy aura that lets no human
emotions filter through. His
pretty boy looks are getting
more wrinkled, and those
wrinkles are supposed to sug
gest experience, and a slight
world-weariness. The director
seems perfectly happy to let
Redford get by with this kind of
convictionless non-acting, be
cause Pollack and Luedtke have
conceived the role of Finch Hat
ton along the lines of Redford,
the American movie star. He's
the Hollywood great white
hunter who can only grow more
romantic with age. But Red
ford's immaculate self
absorption doesn't allow him to

carry a romance with anyone
other than himself, which is why
he doesn't connect with Streep's
character.
Streep herself gives another
perfectly polished, technically
accomplished performance that
fails to suggest any inner life to
her character. She is flawlessly
correct in every nuance of her
impersonation, but there is no
depth, no drive to her Karen.
Perhaps if Streep were less of an
"actress" she might convey
something beyond simple acting;
if she were to bring something of
herself to this role, her character
might come alive.

The movie is
really about
Karen trying to
take charge of
her life in
Africa.

Part of the reason the last
hour of the movie is so slow is
we get less of Klaus Maria Bran
dauer; this wily actor, who al
ways seems to be thinking dirty
thoughts, boosts the film's en
ergy level whenever he's on
screen. The movie also gets a
boost from the wide screen
landscapes we get near the end,
but they don't make up for the
studied ambiguity of the final
scenes. Pollack layers static pas
toral compositions of African
scenery with cryptic native
songs, but this only underlines
the filmmakers' vague, un
resolved feelings toward their
subject. Pollack and Luedtke
have nowhere to go with the
Karen/Finch Hatton relation
ship, and they fall back on the
"mystery and majesty of Africa"
to answer all motivational ques
tions; they leave one hungry for
a real storyline.

sense of the fondness she dis
plays for them in her book; the
personalities she describes are
more engaging than Pollack's en
nobling shots of stoic native
faces might suggest. Pollack
uses the natives solely for their
fatalistic attitude toward life, and
this attitude is what they have to
teach Karen. The movie is
really about Karen trying to take
charge of her life in Africa, trying
to "make the plantation work,"
trying to help and school the
natives, and trying to tie down
Finch Hatton to some kind of
home life. Her attempts to direct
her destiny in Africa are pre
sented as naive and impossible;
she's trying to tame the wild, un
conquerable spirit of the con
tinent itself.
The movie runs into its big
gest problems when it tries to
pass Redford off as the wild, un
conquerable spirit of Africa. In
the book, Finch Hatton is British
and entertainingly human, but
Redford apparently doesn't play
human beings anymore; he plays
ideals. In this film and in "The
Natural," Redford floats above
the other actors, swathed in a
gauzy aura that lets no human
emotions filter through. His
pretty boy looks are getting
more wrinkled, and those
wrinkles are supposed to sug
gest experience, and a slight
world-weariness. The director
seems perfectly happy to let
Redford get by with this kind of
convictionless non-acting, be
cause Pollack and Luedtke have
conceived the role of Finch Hat
ton along the lines of Redford,
the American movie star. He's
the Hollywood great white
hunter who can only grow more
romantic with age. But Red
ford's immaculate self
absorption doesn't allow him to

carry a romance with anyone
other than himself, which is why
he doesn't connect with Streep's
character.
Streep herself gives another
perfectly polished, technically
accomplished performance that
fails to suggest any inner life to
her character. She is flawlessly
correct in every nuance of her
impersonation, but there is no
depth, no drive to her Karen.
Perhaps if Streep were less of an
"actress" she might convey
something beyond simple acting;
if she were to bring something of
herself to this role, her character
might come alive.

The movie is
really about
Karen trying to
take charge of
her life in
Africa.

Part of the reason the last
hour of the movie is so slow is
we get less of Klaus Maria Bran
dauer; this wily actor, who al
ways seems to be thinking dirty
thoughts, boosts the film's en
ergy level whenever he's on
screen. The movie also gets a
boost from the wide screen
landscapes we get near the end,
but they don't make up for the
studied ambiguity of the final
scenes. Pollack layers static pas
toral compositions of African
scenery with cryptic native
songs, but this only underlines
the filmmakers' vague, un
resolved feelings toward their
subject. Pollack and Luedtke
have nowhere to go with the
Karen/Finch Hatton relation
ship, and they fall back on the
"mystery and majesty of Africa"
to answer all motivational ques
tions; they leave one hungry for
a real storyline.
The poster art for "Out of Africa"
shows Robert Redford and Meryl
Streep sitting on a picturesque hil
lock overlooking an African plain.
They're not looking at each other;
they're staring obliquely past each
other, contemplating with polite in
terest the grass at their knees. A
while into this movie, I was staring
at the grass too; it was much more
interesting than watching Streep
and Redford's romance stagnate on
the screen. In this movie, these
two stars don't display a single
romantic impulse. They gaze at
each other with unfocused eyes,
and, as the poster suggests, never
connect with each other (or the au
dience) emotionally.
Director Sydney Pollack and
screenwriter Kurt Luedtke's
adaptation of Isak Dineson's book

"Out of Africa" culls information
from a variety of sources, notably
Dinesen's writings and Judith Thur
man's biography, "Isak Dinesen:
The Life of a Storyteller." The
filmmakers attempt to present a
more accurate account of Dinesen's
period in Africa than the author her
self apparently was interested in,
for her book doesn't even mention
her husband, or her reasons for
starting a coffee plantation in
British East Africa in 1914. In the
movie, Streep plays Karen Dinesen
(Isak was her "nom de plume"),
who marries the Baron Bror von
Blixen-Finecke (Klaus Maria Bran
dauer) — she seemingly for the
title, he expressly for the money —
with the intention of going to Kenya
to begin a dairy operation. When
Karen arrives, she finds that the
baron has already begun a coffee
plantation (with her money) on land
only marginally suitable for coffee
trees.

The movie is about her dropping
this adulterous playboy husband
and becoming involved with hunter
and guide Denys Finch Hatton
(Redford). In her book, Dinesen
romanticizes and idolizes Finch
Hatton; in the movie, director Pol
lack romanticizes and idolizes Red
ford, which is something quite dif
ferent. Karen was a skilled
enough writer to engage one emo
tionally, at the same time she was
turning her experiences in an un
abashed romantic idyll. Pollack
doesn't display a comparable skill.
He admits, "It's never been an
easy picture to solve; there's not
much narrative drive." No director
has more succinctly summed up the
problem with his film.
The movie suffers from an
excess of tastefulness, and Pollack
sidesteps the moments in the
movie where he can possibly whip
up some excitement or tension.

Scenes in which Karen and Finch
Hatton are lion hunting cry out for
dramatic flourish, but Pollack films
these episodes as smoothly and im
personally as his panoramic ariel
shots of the grasslands. A scene in
which Karen is fighting off flood
waters with the natives comes out
of the blue and has no follow up; the
dam they build bursts and we don't
see the consequences. And when
Karen and Finch Hatton finally
consummate their affair, after
having saved each other's life that
day, it's an unbelievably passionless
coupling. (The discrete fade-out on
this scene is almost redundant.)
Pollack is so fearful of grabbing us
in a crude way in these scenes that
he fails to grab us at all. His taste
fulness is stultifying, partly because
it dulls the relationships among the
characters, which lie at the heart of
Dinesen's memoir.


Robert Redford is Denys Finch Hatton, a British hunter who
prefers the wilds of Africa to European society.
The movie "Out of Africa"
