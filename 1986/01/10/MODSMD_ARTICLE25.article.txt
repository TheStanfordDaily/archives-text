# Weak Story, Characters Are Film's Ruin

The poster art for "Out of Africa"
shows Robert Redford and Meryl
Streep sitting on a picturesque hil
lock overlooking an African plain.
They're not looking at each other;
they're staring obliquely past each
other, contemplating with polite in
terest the grass at their knees. A
while into this movie, I was staring
at the grass too; it was much more
interesting than watching Streep
and Redford's romance stagnate on
the screen. In this movie, these
two stars don't display a single
romantic impulse. They gaze at
each other with unfocused eyes,
and, as the poster suggests, never
connect with each other (or the au
dience) emotionally.
Director Sydney Pollack and
screenwriter Kurt Luedtke's
adaptation of Isak Dineson's book

"Out of Africa" culls information
from a variety of sources, notably
Dinesen's writings and Judith Thur
man's biography, "Isak Dinesen:
The Life of a Storyteller." The
filmmakers attempt to present a
more accurate account of Dinesen's
period in Africa than the author her
self apparently was interested in,
for her book doesn't even mention
her husband, or her reasons for
starting a coffee plantation in
British East Africa in 1914. In the
movie, Streep plays Karen Dinesen
(Isak was her "nom de plume"),
who marries the Baron Bror von
Blixen-Finecke (Klaus Maria Bran
dauer) — she seemingly for the
title, he expressly for the money —
with the intention of going to Kenya
to begin a dairy operation. When
Karen arrives, she finds that the
baron has already begun a coffee
plantation (with her money) on land
only marginally suitable for coffee
trees.

The movie is about her dropping
this adulterous playboy husband
and becoming involved with hunter
and guide Denys Finch Hatton
(Redford). In her book, Dinesen
romanticizes and idolizes Finch
Hatton; in the movie, director Pol
lack romanticizes and idolizes Red
ford, which is something quite dif
ferent. Karen was a skilled
enough writer to engage one emo
tionally, at the same time she was
turning her experiences in an un
abashed romantic idyll. Pollack
doesn't display a comparable skill.
He admits, "It's never been an
easy picture to solve; there's not
much narrative drive." No director
has more succinctly summed up the
problem with his film.
The movie suffers from an
excess of tastefulness, and Pollack
sidesteps the moments in the
movie where he can possibly whip
up some excitement or tension.

Scenes in which Karen and Finch
Hatton are lion hunting cry out for
dramatic flourish, but Pollack films
these episodes as smoothly and im
personally as his panoramic ariel
shots of the grasslands. A scene in
which Karen is fighting off flood
waters with the natives comes out
of the blue and has no follow up; the
dam they build bursts and we don't
see the consequences. And when
Karen and Finch Hatton finally
consummate their affair, after
having saved each other's life that
day, it's an unbelievably passionless
coupling. (The discrete fade-out on
this scene is almost redundant.)
Pollack is so fearful of grabbing us
in a crude way in these scenes that
he fails to grab us at all. His taste
fulness is stultifying, partly because
it dulls the relationships among the
characters, which lie at the heart of
Dinesen's memoir.


Robert Redford is Denys Finch Hatton, a British hunter who
prefers the wilds of Africa to European society.
