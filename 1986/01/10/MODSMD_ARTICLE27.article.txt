# 'Chorus Line' Flops in Film Version
## 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
Those kids from "Fame" have all
grown up; now they're in "A
Chorus Line: The Movie," and yes,
they have all the same hang-ups and
foibles. These are people I never
particularly wanted to see or hear
from again. I had my fill of their
stagey "angst" when they were still
in the High School of Performing
Arts, and their teenage problems
were so much more important than
every other teenager's problems.
Now their career goals are so much
more challenging and enobling than
everyone else's that they fill up a
vast theater with their wrenching,
heartening stories. They've been
through hell and back to get where
they are; they're the 17 chosen
ones, and, of course, they did it
their way.
The theater version of "A
Chorus Line," I'm told, is an effec
tive piece of staging. Each chosen
dancer has his or her own neatly
encapsulated psychodrama — one
humorous, another touching, etc.
— and at the end they all bond to
gether, strengthened by love and
understanding, to form one singular
sensation. The movie version,
adapted by Arnold Schulman and di
rected by Richard Attenborough,
ran the risk of exposing all that was
phony about the material, and it hits
most of the major pitfalls. The life
stories have been, in most cases,
truncated in the screenplay, with
many of the chorus line given just a
few minutes to make a dent on the
screen. The"truth" of what they're
saying may be revealed in a per
fectly placed catch in the voice, an
undercurrent of bitterness behind a
veneer of stage cheer, a quivering
lip on an otherwise confidently
smiling face. The performers are
each set up to make an immediate
impression, and they each manage
to achieve almost instant inauthen
ticity. I never thought anyone
would dredge up the nervous young
thing from Missouri (Kristine,
played by Nicole Fosse), pigeon

toed and squeaky voiced, blurting
out, "I can't do this. I wanna go."
Of course there's the abused child
(Paul, played by Cameron English)
who breaks down and reveals all —
the twist is he's been abused by
queer theater folk who lure him into
a drag revue. The script plays it
both ways: we're meant to be
shocked at how he was seduced
into drag, yet we're supposed to
applaud his "understanding" par
ents who let him continue with what
he loves. The material is ruthlessly
designed to pull heartstrings cross
generationally and cross-culturally.
One character worries about
growing old, another worries about
staying young, one's had too much
sex, one not enough, another just
the right amount. It's an integrated
'40s bomber crew of emotional
traumas and triumphs.
There was much talk about
fidelity to the stage material in the
making of the movie, but by now
everyone's pointed out that the
ultra-dull and pointless romance be
tween director Zach (Michael
Douglas) and Cassie (Alyson Reed)
has been expanded for the film ver
sion. In the movie, she gets the
song "What I Did For Love." Not
much of a song to begin with, but
hopelessly diminished because it
now refers to her former affair with
Zach (seen in dreary flashbacks).
Michael Douglas rings false in every
scene; he gives what is probably
the most terrible performance from
a major actor I've seen all year. His
glowering intensity is all wrong for
Zach's commanding moments
(Douglas always looks like he's
ready to hit someone), and he sug
gests no human warmth when he
breaks into his "relaxed" smiles.
The two best numbers come
early, and are given to two men.
Charles McGowan does a pleasantly
lively "I Can Do That," and Gregg
Burge is entertainingly aggressive
in a new number for the movie,
"Surprise, Surprise." But no one
else has a comparably distinctive
song and dance. The songs in the
play (by Marvin Hamlisch and Ed
ward Kelban) are not the best

Broadway has to offer, and hiring
the choreographer of "Flashdance,"
Jeffrey Hornaday, was one of the
more dismal ideas of this produc
tion. Oiie doesn't go to Hornaday
for inspired choreography; his "Let
Me Dance For You" staging for
Alyson Reed is flashdancing played
at half speed. Attenborough's
camera jumps around too much to
keep the individual performers in
the frame, and it keeps busy hun

ting down the faces of the select 17
in the big opening and closing pro
duction numbers. The movie also
flubs the final number; it's staged
with all of the hundreds of dancers
that the opening try-outs had, and
the 17 chorus line members are just
part of the mob again. It gives the
impression that they (and we)
haven't gotten anywhere in the
course of the movie, which is ex
actly right.


Gregg Burge is one of the many performers who experience the
competition and trauma of show business in "A Chorus Line."
