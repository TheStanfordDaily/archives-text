## Expand Your Hangout Horizons At South Bay Area 'Hot Spots' 
### SYDNEY SMITH Editorial staff 
It's the beginning of the quarter,
the work load isn't unbearable (yet)
and you're looking for something to
do. Palo Alto seems like old hash by
now, but you don't want to go to
that harrying den of tourists called
San Francisco. Now's the time for
you to be let in on one of the Bay
Area's best-kept secrets â€” at least
kept from the Stanford student pop
ulation: the Cupertino-Saratoga
area.
In one amazing night I visited
three of the nicest drinking places
I've ever been to, two of which also
had great dancing. All within a 20-
minute ride from the Stanford
campus. Officially, of course, you

have to be 21 years old to partici
pate in this kind of activity, but if
you can get away with it (I did and
I'm only 19), or if you really are le
gal, bar-hopping in Cupertino and
Saratoga is great fun.
We started out going down High
way 101 South to Mathilda Road
East in Sunnyvale. On Mathilda, we
stopped at Pacific Fresh, a nice,
quiet (on a Wednesday) and yup
pified restaurant-bar. The interior
at the bar was nice but a little
sterile, with light wood furniture
and green plants on a raised plat
form. Three very strong gin and
tonics and one coffee (for the
driver) came to $7.50, perhaps a
little expensive for a student. For a
really special evening out,
however, drinks at the bar could
make a nice beginning to a meal at

Pacific Fresh, which serves
(appropriately enough) seafood. It
seemed hard to believe at the time,
but I was assured that Happy Hour
at Pacific Fresh is "wild."
Right through the parking lot,
about 30 seconds from Pacific
Fresh by car, is Rodeo, a lounge
disco place. In the words of my
cousin, Rodeo is a "meat-market,"
but with a group of friends it could
be lots of fun. Ignoring the leers
from the Silicon Valley bachelor
types, we wandered through
Rodeo, "just looking." Rodeo was
brightly-lit but comfortable-looking,
with soft chairs and sofas, and a
large dance floor. Two video
screens showed Pat Benatar sing
ing some typical song, while
colored lights flashed onto the few
dancers who had ventured out on

the floor so early. Though we did
not dance then, we thought it would
be fun to return later when the
crowd got a little more . . . active.
From Rodeo we went West on
Mathilda, which turns into
Saratoga-Sunnyvale. Just across
Highway 280 on Saratoga-
Sunnyvale is the Peppermill, which
is the favorite hangout of our
driver. The Peppermill is an eatery
with an interior bar and lounge,
which is where we spent the next
half-hour. We sat at the bar on plush

chairs that were uncomfortably low
compared to the bar itself. The
drinks were weak; in fact, I thought
the bartender had guessed my age
and given me a "virgin" Whiskey
Sour, instead of the real thing.
However, the gin and tonics that
my companions drank were equally
weak. The Peppermill does have a
nice selection of the more expen
sive drinks, such as Grand Marnier.
Directly across the street from
the Peppermill is Ely McFlie's, a
very interesting dancing place. Ely

McFlie's does have a cover-charge,
but just seeing the interior is worth
the money. Above the bar is a huge
metal fly, with bizarre statues and
lightning bolts around it. Upstairs
you can see the lighting techniques
used to create the avante-garde ef
fect, but downstairs you can dance
to some good tunes while watching
the "show." The chairs are com
fortable and the drinks are good and
strong, although the service is very

slow and confused. Again we had
gin and tonics, although one person
in the group switched to Canadian
Club and Soda, which was sup
posedly good, and apparently
strong, judging from the effect it
had on the drinker.
From Ely McFlie's we went
south on Highway 280, turned right
on Woolf Road, and went a block
and a half to the Rusty Pelican, yet
another dancing place. The Rusty
Pelican (affectionately called the
Rusty Pecker by our driver) is not
as nice as Ely McFlie's, in my
opinion. Although the live band was
not bad, the dance floor was so
crowded that my dance partner
compared it to Vietnam. The drinks
were good (I had a strong rum and
coke) although again the service
was slow because the place was so
crowded. The decor was not as in
teresting as at Ely McFlies, al
though there were some bizarre
fans on the ceiling that lended some
interest to the brightly-lit interior.
The highlight of the evening
came after midnight when we
returned north on 280 to Saratoga-
Sunnyvale Road, where we headed
west past Stevens Creek
Boulevard. In an innocuous shop

ping center on the right is The
Britannia Arms, an English/Irish
pub, which would be a great place
to just sit and talk for an entire
evening. The atmosphere is casual
and homey. People of all ages come
to Brittania Arms to be with
friends, play some darts and per
haps gather around the piano to
sing a few of the best traditional
Irish and English folk songs, as well
as some of the best protest songs
from America. The selection of
beers at Britannia Arms is amazing.
Imports from Germany, Ireland,
England and Australia are among
the best. I had a Beck's from the
bottle, but Miller was on tap, and
big beer mugs are available to feel
more comfortable and down-home
with the beer.
We stayed at Britannia Arms until
it closed at 2 a.m., and left with the
feeling that we'd discovered a new
hang-out for all walks of life. All in
all our evening was fantastically en
joyable, and a nice break from the
usual Palo Alto scene. My personal
favorites from among the various
places we visited that night are Ely
McFlie's and Britannia Arms.
However, it is fun to explore the
different hangouts in the Cupertino-
Saratoga area, so all possibilities
should be considered.
Drink and be merry, for tomor
row ... we may study!
