## Expand Your Hangout Horizons At South Bay Area 'Hot Spots' 
### SYDNEY SMITH Editorial staff 
It's the beginning of the quarter,
the work load isn't unbearable (yet)
and you're looking for something to
do. Palo Alto seems like old hash by
now, but you don't want to go to
that harrying den of tourists called
San Francisco. Now's the time for
you to be let in on one of the Bay
Area's best-kept secrets â€” at least
kept from the Stanford student pop
ulation: the Cupertino-Saratoga
area.
In one amazing night I visited
three of the nicest drinking places
I've ever been to, two of which also
had great dancing. All within a 20-
minute ride from the Stanford
campus. Officially, of course, you

have to be 21 years old to partici
pate in this kind of activity, but if
you can get away with it (I did and
I'm only 19), or if you really are le
gal, bar-hopping in Cupertino and
Saratoga is great fun.
We started out going down High
way 101 South to Mathilda Road
East in Sunnyvale. On Mathilda, we
stopped at Pacific Fresh, a nice,
quiet (on a Wednesday) and yup
pified restaurant-bar. The interior
at the bar was nice but a little
sterile, with light wood furniture
and green plants on a raised plat
form. Three very strong gin and
tonics and one coffee (for the
driver) came to $7.50, perhaps a
little expensive for a student. For a
really special evening out,
however, drinks at the bar could
make a nice beginning to a meal at

Pacific Fresh, which serves
(appropriately enough) seafood. It
seemed hard to believe at the time,
but I was assured that Happy Hour
at Pacific Fresh is "wild."
Right through the parking lot,
about 30 seconds from Pacific
Fresh by car, is Rodeo, a lounge
disco place. In the words of my
cousin, Rodeo is a "meat-market,"
but with a group of friends it could
be lots of fun. Ignoring the leers
from the Silicon Valley bachelor
types, we wandered through
Rodeo, "just looking." Rodeo was
brightly-lit but comfortable-looking,
with soft chairs and sofas, and a
large dance floor. Two video
screens showed Pat Benatar sing
ing some typical song, while
colored lights flashed onto the few
dancers who had ventured out on

the floor so early. Though we did
not dance then, we thought it would
be fun to return later when the
crowd got a little more . . . active.
From Rodeo we went West on
Mathilda, which turns into
Saratoga-Sunnyvale. Just across
Highway 280 on Saratoga-
Sunnyvale is the Peppermill, which
is the favorite hangout of our
driver. The Peppermill is an eatery
with an interior bar and lounge,
which is where we spent the next
half-hour. We sat at the bar on plush

chairs that were uncomfortably low
compared to the bar itself. The
drinks were weak; in fact, I thought
the bartender had guessed my age
and given me a "virgin" Whiskey
Sour, instead of the real thing.
However, the gin and tonics that
my companions drank were equally
weak. The Peppermill does have a
nice selection of the more expen
sive drinks, such as Grand Marnier.
Directly across the street from
the Peppermill is Ely McFlie's, a
very interesting dancing place. Ely

McFlie's does have a cover-charge,
but just seeing the interior is worth
the money. Above the bar is a huge
metal fly, with bizarre statues and
lightning bolts around it. Upstairs
you can see the lighting techniques
used to create the avante-garde ef
fect, but downstairs you can dance
to some good tunes while watching
the "show." The chairs are com
fortable and the drinks are good and
strong, although the service is very
