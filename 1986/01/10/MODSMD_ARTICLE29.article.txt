# Stick to the Pizza at Ramona's

### JAMISON SMELTZ 
Ramona's Restaurant

Just a quick scooter-ride away on
Ramona Avenue, between Univer
sity and Hamilton, sits Ramona's
Restaurant, a student favorite
known for its hearty pies and
relaxed atmosphere. When one
gets that unique craving for real
pizza, a quick trip to Ramona's
usually beats those Domino's blues.
Friends can sit and people-watch
over a pitcher or a carafe without
having to worry about drawing un
approving glances from families out
with their 2.3 children. Whether
Ramona's intended to have a
primarily college-to-yuppie age
demography, it is a comforting
place to eat, drink and be merry,
and to forget about reality for a few
hours.

Although Ramona's was not very
crowded for a Saturday night, my
friend Syd and I had to take a table
in the smoking section. Both the
host and the waiter were in jovial
spirits, and established a good and
easy rapport. One of the pleasures
of being served by someone your
own age is that the role-playing
guises of server-servee can be set
aside, and communication can then
take place between equals. Our
waiter joked with us all evening
abou* trivial but interesting things
that typically happen at restaurants.
It was a nice change from "Hi
howaya, hope it doesn't rain, what
lya have?"
As we weren't in a pizza mood,
we decided to check out the altern
ative cuisine. I ordered a roast beef
deli sandwich, while Syd decided on
the vegetarian calzone (kind of an
inside-out pizza) and the salad bar.
As we waited for our main course,
we got a bottle of the house wine,
which was a standard table red
wine. It was a good complement to

our meal but would probably have
been an insult to a connoisseur.
The salad bar was nicely varied in
its choices, ranging from fresh
spinach to several fruits to pasta
salad, but slightly understocked and
a bit unkempt. It was toward the
end of the evening, however, and it
seemed that everyone was letting
down their guards a bit. The salad
was good on all counts, although
the cantaloupe was a tad crunchy.
The garlic bread we ordered on
the side was plentiful (one order
was more than enough for the two
of us), made with a thick French
bread that was slightly hard but
tasty. I have yet to find a restaurant
that can achieve that delicate tex
tural balance in garlic bread, with
enough butter and garlic on top to
make it almost soggy without losing
the crisp crunchiness underneath.
With a half-bottle of wine remain
ing, our entrees arrived. My sand
wich was small and unexciting, and
I would have preferred another

pickle spear. The mayo was sparse,
and the beef, although lean, simply
wasn't very tasty. For the price, I
a more generous portion.
The calzone was reportedly very
appetizing and very hot, with plenty
of cheese as well as mushrooms,
onions and bell pepper. Syd had no
complaints, but I felt the crust was
hard, possibly cooked too long. I
have been weaned, however, on
the best Italian food the Philadel
phia area has to offer, which could
possibly be why I wasn't satisfied
with my sandwich, either; with
delis on every corner back home,
my criteria may be a bit unrealistic
for this area.
Despite the inadequate sand
wich, however, the evening was
very humorous and enjoyable. As
the wine bottle grew emptier and
the waiter pluckier, I realized that
Ramona's isn't just a place to get
great pizza. It's a fun place to let
your hair down and rap with friends
and waiters. I'll stick to the pizza.
