In a move that planners hope will
put Stanford at the forefront of the
study of international affairs, Uni
versity Provost James Rosse ap
proved a recommendation Nov. 27
for the establishment of an interdis
ciplinary organization designed to
coordinate what are now indepen

international study.
The new center, the Institute of
International Studies (IIS), will
enable scholars from the various

existing programs to collaborate "in
the fields of international relations,
international and development eco

foreign societies, cultures, institu

In a letter responding to the com

that we will see significant progress
during the current academic year."
The lIS was proposed in large

ternational affairs, Ward said.
"The committee concluded that
no development has been of more
fundamental importance to the
recent past or the forseeable future
of the United States and the world

than the vast increase in the impact
of international forces on what have
heretofore been predominantly in
dividual, local or national patterns of
human thought and behavior," ac
cording to the report, which ap
peared in the Dec. 11 Campus
Report.
"So fundamental and permanent
a change should have profound im
plications for America's system of
secondary and higher education in
