# New International Center Approved
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
In a move that planners hope will
put Stanford at the forefront of the
study of international affairs, Uni
versity Provost James Rosse ap
proved a recommendation Nov. 27
for the establishment of an interdis
ciplinary organization designed to
coordinate what are now indepen
dent campus programs emphasizing
international study.
The new center, the Institute of
International Studies (IIS), will
enable scholars from the various

existing programs to collaborate "in
the fields of international relations,
international and development eco
nomics, international security and
foreign societies, cultures, institu
tions, behavior and languages," ac
cording to a report by a faculty
committee that recently finished in
vestigating the need for and the
feasibility of the lIS.
Another committee is currently
being formed by Robert Street,
vice-provost and dean of research
and academic systems, to begin
making definite plans and to find a
director, according to Political Sci
ence Prof. Robert Ward, chairman

of the Center for Research in Inter
national Studies.
In a letter responding to the com
mittee's report, Rosse did not men
tion a specific date on which the in
stitute would open but said, "I hope
that we will see significant progress
during the current academic year."
The lIS was proposed in large
part because of the growing na
tional need for understanding of in
ternational affairs, Ward said.
"The committee concluded that
no development has been of more
fundamental importance to the
recent past or the forseeable future
of the United States and the world

than the vast increase in the impact
of international forces on what have
heretofore been predominantly in
dividual, local or national patterns of
human thought and behavior," ac
cording to the report, which ap
peared in the Dec. 11 Campus
Report.
"So fundamental and permanent
a change should have profound im
plications for America's system of
secondary and higher education in
general and for our leading univer
sities in particular. In fact, this has
not been the case — at Stanford or
elsewhere," the report continued.
"A particular interest will be in
the incorporation into this group of
scholars in the fields of engineering,
science and high-technology," ac
cording to Ward.
The plan approved by Rosse stip
ulates that the various research and
teaching organizations will be
governed by the institute while the
involved academic departments will
remain under the administration of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences, although they will have a
close relationship with the institute.
The committee's report states
the need for a building for the in
stitute, and Rosse said in a letter in
response, "it is anticipated . . . suf
ficient permanent space for the lIS
will be developed in the next three
to five years."
"Once we get [a building], we'll
begin to build in ways that are quite
exciting," Ward said.
The lIS will include such Univer
sity programs as the Center for In
ternational Security and Arms Con
trol, the Northeast Asia-United
States Forum on International
Policy, the United States-Mexico
Relations Program, the Program on
Soviet International Behavior, the
Brazil Project, the Stanford Pro
gram on International and Cross-
Cultural Education, the Center for
Research on International Studies
and the International Strategic In
stitute at Stanford, according to the
report.
The institute will also involve
several area studies programs in
cluding African, East Asian, Latin
American and Russian and East
European Studies, the report said.
