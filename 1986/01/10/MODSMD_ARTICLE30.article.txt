There are times when all you
want is a nice, big, juicy ham
burger. Not the institutionalized
kind like you get at McDonald's, but
a real barbecued hamburger, like
you get at Fourth of July picnics.
Sound good? Then Kirk's is the
place to go. Located right off
campus on California Avenue
(before Printer's Inc.), Kirk's offers
several grilled goodies for the car
nivorous palate.
On a Wednesday night, Kirk's
was pretty empty. Three other
groups were in the restaurant when
we got there, four were there when
we left. The interior of Kirk's looks
like something out of the set of
"Diner." Plastic booths and chairs,
sparse decoration and a red
linoleum floor all help create an ef
fect of the ultimate college hangout.
The quality of the burgers,
however, outweigh by far any
negative aspect that the restau

rant's appearance may give to
Kirk's. The selection is simple, but
then again, how much can you do
with a hamburger? My date opted
for the double hamburger, and I
chose the pineapple burger. My
date was too busy eating to say
much about how his tasted, but I
guess that kind of speaks for itself.
The pineapple burger was great.
The meat was cooked exactly the
way I like it: dark on the outside
and pink on the inside. Those who
don't like their meat that rare can
tell the cook as they order their
burgers. The slice of pineapple
didn't take up enough space inside
the hamburger for me to taste it all
the time, but that allowed me more
variety of flavor in my simple meal.
Each patron dresses his or her
own burger at the bar, which has
the usual mayo and mustard,
ketchup, pickles and onions. I was
impressed with the pepperincini
that was offered at the bar, but dis
appointed that there was no leaf
lettuce. All in all, however, the
burger was great. Our meal was in
expensive, too: with chips and
drinks we spent only $7.
To drink there is the usual as
sortment of sodas, and some great

looking shakes. Kirk's also offers
hot dogs and salads for those who
don't care for hamburgers. But for
those who do want an "all-
American" meal at a very good

price, Kirk's is the place to go.
Kirk's is open Monday through
Saturday from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.,
and on Sundays from 11:30 a.m. to
10 p.m. \
