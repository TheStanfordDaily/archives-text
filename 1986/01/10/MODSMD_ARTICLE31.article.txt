## More Injury Woes Plague Card The
						Team Limps Into ASU Next 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
TUCSON, Ariz. — Going into
tomorrow's game at Arizona State,
the Stanford men's basketball team
has had time to adjust to the loss of
senior guard Steve Brown. Yet,
losing the man — for the second
year in a row — who is expected to
be your top scorer isn't an easy
thing to take.
"We knew there was a chance
he'd be out," basketball Coach Tom
Davis said yesterday."It still hurt
us a lot. The team found out about
it at the meeting Wednesday after
noon. There were tears in every
one's eyes. It was a crushing emo
tional moment.
"I think up to that point we
pretty much hoped and were confi
dent that he'd be back," Davis
added.
The stress fracture in the tibia
bone of his right leg that caused
Brown to miss all of last season was
determined Wednesday to be
serious enough to force him to sit
out all the rest of this year.
That means the end of Brown's
collegiate career, since he used his
redshirt year last season.
Davis said he planned to use John
Paye and Terry Taylor to back up
Novian Whitsitt, who was moved
into the starting position at the
number two guard spot. But even
those plans will have to be altered
depending on the severity of the
muscle pull in Whitsitt's shoulder
that caused him to sit out last
night's contest against Arizona.
Davis said with Brown gone, "John
is probably our best defensive and
rebounding guard. He'll probably
see a lot more playing time."

Stanford guard Novian Whitsitt was slated to start in place of the injured Steve Brown last night in
Tucson, Ariz. But he never even saw action, as a muscle pull in his shoulder caused him to get
scratched from the lineup. Later, center Howard Wright went out with a sprained ankle.
