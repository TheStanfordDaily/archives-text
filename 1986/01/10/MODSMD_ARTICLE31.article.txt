## More Injury Woes Plague Card The 						Team Limps Into ASU Next 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
TUCSON, Ariz. — Going into
tomorrow's game at Arizona State,
the Stanford men's basketball team
has had time to adjust to the loss of
senior guard Steve Brown. Yet,
losing the man — for the second
year in a row — who is expected to
be your top scorer isn't an easy
thing to take.
"We knew there was a chance
he'd be out," basketball Coach Tom
Davis said yesterday."It still hurt
us a lot. The team found out about
it at the meeting Wednesday after
noon. There were tears in every
one's eyes. It was a crushing emo
tional moment.
"I think up to that point we
pretty much hoped and were confi
dent that he'd be back," Davis
added.
The stress fracture in the tibia
bone of his right leg that caused
Brown to miss all of last season was
determined Wednesday to be
serious enough to force him to sit
out all the rest of this year.
That means the end of Brown's
collegiate career, since he used his
redshirt year last season.
Davis said he planned to use John
Paye and Terry Taylor to back up
Novian Whitsitt, who was moved
into the starting position at the
number two guard spot. But even
those plans will have to be altered
depending on the severity of the
muscle pull in Whitsitt's shoulder
that caused him to sit out last
night's contest against Arizona.
Davis said with Brown gone, "John
is probably our best defensive and
rebounding guard. He'll probably
see a lot more playing time."

Stanford guard Novian Whitsitt was slated to start in place of the injured Steve Brown last night in
Tucson, Ariz. But he never even saw action, as a muscle pull in his shoulder caused him to get
scratched from the lineup. Later, center Howard Wright went out with a sprained ankle.
Arizona State suffered its own
shake up this summer when coach
Bob Weinhauer was fired. A series
of recruiting violations and illegal
extras to players led to Wein
hauser's dismissal.
Former assistant Steve Pat
terson took over as the head
coach this season. The search for a
permanent coach begins next
week.
Whoever gets the job will have to
operate with a one-year ban on
recruiting, which was imposed on
the Sun Devils by the Pacific 10 Con
ference. The prohibition on all ac
tive recruiting, brought on by the
excesses of the Weinhauer era, is
expected to be sanctioned by the
NCAA late this month. The ban
began Jan. 1.
While Stanford was hobbling
along in a 77-69 loss to Arizona last
night, the Sun Devils got 15 points
from forward Chris Sandle, includ
ing a pivotal jumper with 1:10
remaining, to beat California 69-67.
Arthur Thomas' free throw with
12 seconds to play gave the Sun
Devils a 67-65 lead, and Cal's Jeff
Huling blew a chance to tie it when
he missed the front end of a one
and-one with 11 seconds to go.
Thomas' two fouls shots with
seven seconds left offset a jumper
by Cal's Kevin Johnson with two
seconds remaining.
The win snapped the Sun Devils'
four-game losing streak and im
proved their record to 7-5 overall.
They are 7-0 at home and 1-1 in
Pac-10 play.
Meanwhile, Stanford's loss
dropped them to 1-2 in the confer
ence and 7-8 overall as the two
prepare to meet tomorrow.
Arizona State, the preseason
pick to finish second in the Pac-10,
has seen its top player, senior
guard Steve Beck, suffer through a
scoring slump through the first half
of the season. Beck is shooting 45
percent from the field and averag
ing 9.1 points per game so far.
Sandle has stepped in and
become the Sun Devils' top scorer.
He was averaging 14.6 points per
game before yesterday's perfor
mance against Cal.

Davis, who this summer coached
Beck on the Pac-10 All-Stars' Tour
of Australia and Sandle at the
National Sport Festival, considers
both to be among the top 20 players
in the Pac-10.
"They've got two of the best
overall players in the league in
Sandle and Beck, " he said. "They
don't have some of the experience
dimensions of an Arizona, though."
Davis doesn't see Beck's slump
lasting. "He's too good of a player

to be down for long. He's really an
outstanding player," he said.
Patterson, a collegiate star at
UCLA who started at center be
tween the Lew Alcindor (Kareem
Abdul Jabbar) and Bill Walton eras,
has patterned the Sun Devils after
John Wooden's Bruin teams, ac
cording to Davis.
Tomorrow's game begins at 6:30
p.m. PST and will be broadcast on
KCBS (740 AM) and KZSU (90.1
FM).

Without Steve Brown (above), and minus the services of his
backup, Novian Whitsitt, the Stanford offense had trouble
scoring many points in last night's 77-69 loss to Arizona. The
Cardinal will try again tomorrow in Tempe against Arizona
State.
TUCSON, Ariz. — Going into
tomorrow's game at Arizona State,
the Stanford men's basketball team
has had time to adjust to the loss of
senior guard Steve Brown. Yet,
losing the man — for the second
year in a row — who is expected to
be your top scorer isn't an easy
thing to take.
"We knew there was a chance
he'd be out," basketball Coach Tom
Davis said yesterday."It still hurt
us a lot. The team found out about
it at the meeting Wednesday after
noon. There were tears in every
one's eyes. It was a crushing emo
tional moment.
"I think up to that point we
pretty much hoped and were confi
dent that he'd be back," Davis
added.
The stress fracture in the tibia
bone of his right leg that caused
Brown to miss all of last season was
determined Wednesday to be
serious enough to force him to sit
out all the rest of this year.
That means the end of Brown's
collegiate career, since he used his
redshirt year last season.
Davis said he planned to use John
Paye and Terry Taylor to back up
Novian Whitsitt, who was moved
into the starting position at the
number two guard spot. But even
those plans will have to be altered
depending on the severity of the
muscle pull in Whitsitt's shoulder
that caused him to sit out last
night's contest against Arizona.
Davis said with Brown gone, "John
is probably our best defensive and
rebounding guard. He'll probably
see a lot more playing time."

Stanford guard Novian Whitsitt was slated to start in place of the injured Steve Brown last night in
Tucson, Ariz. But he never even saw action, as a muscle pull in his shoulder caused him to get
scratched from the lineup. Later, center Howard Wright went out with a sprained ankle.
Arizona State suffered its own
shake up this summer when coach
Bob Weinhauer was fired. A series
of recruiting violations and illegal
extras to players led to Wein
hauser's dismissal.
Former assistant Steve Pat
terson took over as the head
coach this season. The search for a
permanent coach begins next
week.
Whoever gets the job will have to
operate with a one-year ban on
recruiting, which was imposed on
the Sun Devils by the Pacific 10 Con
ference. The prohibition on all ac
tive recruiting, brought on by the
excesses of the Weinhauer era, is
expected to be sanctioned by the
NCAA late this month. The ban
began Jan. 1.
While Stanford was hobbling
along in a 77-69 loss to Arizona last
night, the Sun Devils got 15 points
from forward Chris Sandle, includ
ing a pivotal jumper with 1:10
remaining, to beat California 69-67.
Arthur Thomas' free throw with
12 seconds to play gave the Sun
Devils a 67-65 lead, and Cal's Jeff
Huling blew a chance to tie it when
he missed the front end of a one
and-one with 11 seconds to go.
Thomas' two fouls shots with
seven seconds left offset a jumper
by Cal's Kevin Johnson with two
seconds remaining.
The win snapped the Sun Devils'
four-game losing streak and im
proved their record to 7-5 overall.
They are 7-0 at home and 1-1 in
Pac-10 play.
Meanwhile, Stanford's loss
dropped them to 1-2 in the confer
ence and 7-8 overall as the two
prepare to meet tomorrow.
Arizona State, the preseason
pick to finish second in the Pac-10,
has seen its top player, senior
guard Steve Beck, suffer through a
scoring slump through the first half
of the season. Beck is shooting 45
percent from the field and averag
ing 9.1 points per game so far.
Sandle has stepped in and
become the Sun Devils' top scorer.
He was averaging 14.6 points per
game before yesterday's perfor
mance against Cal.

Davis, who this summer coached
Beck on the Pac-10 All-Stars' Tour
of Australia and Sandle at the
National Sport Festival, considers
both to be among the top 20 players
in the Pac-10.
"They've got two of the best
overall players in the league in
Sandle and Beck, " he said. "They
don't have some of the experience
dimensions of an Arizona, though."
Davis doesn't see Beck's slump
lasting. "He's too good of a player

to be down for long. He's really an
outstanding player," he said.
Patterson, a collegiate star at
UCLA who started at center be
tween the Lew Alcindor (Kareem
Abdul Jabbar) and Bill Walton eras,
has patterned the Sun Devils after
John Wooden's Bruin teams, ac
cording to Davis.
Tomorrow's game begins at 6:30
p.m. PST and will be broadcast on
