# Women's Hoops Aims at NCAAs
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
Last year, the Stanford
women's basketball team played
with a modest goal in mind — to
win 10 games.
As a result, the Cardinal posted
a modest 9-19 record and a
modest 7th place finish in the
Western Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation.
Tuesday, after an impressive
83-82 win over a fine lowa State
squad, Stanford's ninth win in 13
contests this year, Stanford cap
tain Virginia Sourlis didn't need to
ponder the Cardinal's goal for this
season.

"NCAAs," she said without
hesitation. "We can get in. All
we'll have to do is win 20 games
and finish second in our confer
ence."
What a difference a year
makes.
With essentially the same
players, plus a couple of freshman
phenoms thrown in for seasoning,
Stanford is winning consistently
and beating some very good pro
grams in the process — in addi
tion to lowa State, a nationally
ranked University of Nevada-Las
Vegas squad fell to the Cardinal
earlier. And they are making
people take statements like
Sourlis' more seriously .
After a slow start, Stanford
features a much more balanced of
fensive attack, one that no longer
has to rely too heavily on Sourlis for
points, and one that is responsible
for the recent wave of Cardinal vic
tories.
"If you look at the stat sheet,"
basketball Coach Tara VanDerveer
said, "you'll find different people
leading the scoring practically every
game. Virginia is looking more to
feed the ball. It's working well."
Another reason for Stanford's
resurgence is an improving inside
game headed by freshmen Evon
Asforis and Jill Yanke and junior
Kim Mercer.
"Jill and Evon have definitely
come a long way," VanDerveer
said. "I see spurts of brilliance (like
Asforis' 19-point performance
against lowa State) but sometimes
they don't do so well. I would like to
see them play better.
The Cardinal will get an opportu
nity to take another step toward 20
wins Saturday night when it faces
the 2-9 Titans from Fullerton State
in a non-league matchup.
