# Volleyball begins in '85
## Men Set for Opener 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
Tomorrow night at Maples Pavilion the Stanford men's volleyball team
opens its season against the Cardinal alumni in what will be much more
than a reunion.
"We're anxious to see what we can do," volleyball Co-coach Don Shaw
said. "It's a fun thing, but it is our first competition of the year and we treat
it that way."
The alumni team was victorious two years ago in its last confrontation
with the varsity. Last year's alumni match had to be cancelled.
This year's match, scheduled to start at 7:30 p.m., was organized by-
John McColl and Dave Saeta, Cardinal alums currently living in Southern
California. And, according to Shaw, the two organizers have brought to
gether a team that will be talent-laden once again.
Craig Lauchner, an All-American setter for Stanford last season, has in
dicated that he will play tomorrow night. Lauchner, who played on the
U.S. team in the World University Games last summer, was the quarter
back of the Cardinal squad that qualified for the NCAA playoffs last year.
Also penciled in to play for the alumni is Tom Duralde, a U.S. Volleyball
Association All-American for Stanford in 1977. Following his college
career, Duralde played on the U.S.
national team.
Shaw expressed optimism as the
Cardinal commences the 1986
season. "We've been practicing
well," he said. "It's been probably
our best pre-season. The concen
tration level has been good, and the
players have been working really
hard."
As the season progresses, all
eyes will be focused on Steve
Modory, the junior setter who has
the difficult task of replacing Lauch
ner. Shaw indicated that Modory
has been practicing well.
The remainder of the squad
features All-American Jon Root and
returning starters Chris Braun,
Scott Fortune and Brett Monello.
The Cardinal's regular season
opener will be one week from to
morrow night against Chico State at
Maples.
