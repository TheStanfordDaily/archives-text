# Whitsitt, Wright Go Down; So Does Stanford 77-69
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
TUCSON, Ariz. â€” There is
something about Stanford that
brings about the best in Steve
Kerr.
Last year, the Arizona point
guard scored a career high 23
points to beat the Cardinal here.
Last night, he did that one better,
pouring in 24 points to lead the
Wildcats to a 77-69 victory over
Stanford in front of 10,471 in
McKale Center.
"Other than the bad shooting
night, I thought he played well,"
Wildcat Coach Lute Olson quipped.
Kerr shot 11 of 16 from the field.
"You got to take into account the
way he runs the team," Olson con
tinued. "He never loses concentra
tion, the kids respect him, and if
you give him an inch, he'll knock
your eyeballs out."
Arizona effectively took Stanford
out of its inside game and forced the
Cardinal to shoot from the
perimeter.
"They handled us inside," Stan
ford Coach Tom Davis said. "They
completely dominated the inside
and controlled the inside, and they
distracted the guards on the
perimeter enough to prevent them
from getting the ball inside. They're
much quicker and more aggressive
than our guys inside."
Olson had praise for John Edgar,
his 6-foot-6 senior center. "John
Edgar did an outstanding job inside.
He did the things the middle man
must do to play an outstanding
game."
Stanford was also suffering from
injuries. Having lost Steve Brown
for the season, the Cardinal saw
his replacement, Novian Whitsitt,
miss the entire game with a muscle
pull in the back of his shoulder.
Whitsitt sustained the injury in
practice a couple of days ago, but it
had been expected to heal. Davis
scratched him from the lineup just

before game time.
To top things off, 6-8 center
Howard Wright, Stanford's best
inside player so far this season,
sprained his ankle early in the
second half and missed the final 17
minutes.
The injury to Whitsitt forced John
Paye into a starting role and left
only Terry Taylor as the reserve at
guard.
"You're not only losing a great
shooter, when you have the guys
on the bench playing, you don't
have the guys to come off the bench
when you're tired," Olson said.
"I think they got more tired than
us. If you look at the last five
minutes, I think you'll see them
holding their pants, not us," he
added.
The loses also hurt the Cardinal
defensively against Kerr. "We had
to identify him with guys who aren't
our best defensive guards, " Davis
said. "Steve Brown is our best de
fensive guard, and next is Whitsitt
or Paye."
Arizona dealt cooly with the
Stanford press, commiting only
eight turnovers. "I'm not too sure
that press is going to be effective if
it only forces eight turnovers," Ol
son said.
Not only did the Wildcat guards
break the press, they found open
people when they did. Kerr had 10
assists, and Craig McMillan had six.
Forward Sean Elliott was the big
recipient, finishing with 20 points.
For Stanford, freshman forward
Todd Lichti continued to lead the
way, scoring 19. Forwards Earl
Koberlein and Greg Butler finished
with 15 and 12, but most of those
came on perimeter jumpers.
Taylor tried to pick up the slack
at guard, going 7-of-ll from the
field for 14 points, but it wasn't
enough.
Stanford stayed close for most of
the first half, but Arizona scored six
unanswered points in the final three
