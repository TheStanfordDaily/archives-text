# College Stars Descend on Farm
## East-West Shriners square off tomorrow 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
If the holiday orgy of college foot
ball games on television left you
hungry for more, you belong in
Stanford Stadium tomorrow after
noon.
That's where 68 of the nation's
best collegiate football players will
take the field for the East-West
Shrine Game, the annual all-star af
fair that benefits the Shriner's
Hospital. There's no title at stake,
and no one will remember who wins
the game, but it's a good chance to
see some future pros in action and
satisfy those football cravings.
The game, which begins at noon,
is the first Shrine Game in a number
of years that will be played while
Stanford is in session.
The local interest will be pro
vided by offensive tackle John
Barns, the only Stanford player se
lected to the West team. Barns has
been chosen as a starter by West
Coach LaVell Edwards of Brigham
Young, and he will get a serious
look from the National Football
League scouts in the pressbox.
Tight end Greg Baty, the other
Cardinal player who has strongly at
tracted the NFL's interest, is in
Japan preparing for the Japan Bowl.
The Pacific 10 Conference is well
represented on the West roster —
in all, 14 players from the league
will suit up tomorrow. Running
backs Tony Cherry of Oregon and
Rueben Mayes of Washington State
— a pair of Cardinal killers in recent
years — should start in the back
field, and wide receivers Reggie
Bynum of Oregon State and Lew
Barnes of Oregon will see plenty of
action.
The biggest name player in the
game is West quarterback Robbie
Bosco of BYU, a Heisman Trophy
vote-getter who is slated as a first
round draft pick. He will match
arms with Brian McClure of

Oregon running back Tony Cherry, who had a big day against the Cardinal in Eugene earlier this
year, will be one of many college stars who will suit up for tomorrow s East-West Shrine All-Star
Game at Stanford Stadium.
