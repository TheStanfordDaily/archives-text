# Wrestlers Try a Reverse
## Horpel's squad must rebound in Bakersfield 
### PETER CASTILLO Staff writer 
Intent on rebounding from a disappointing winter
break, the Stanford wrestling team is hoping that when
it travels to Cal-State Bakersfield tomorrow it can pull
off a repeat performance of last year's 26-23 upset
over the Roadrunners, a perennial NCAA Division II
powerhouse.
It was the first time in 15 years that Stanford has
beaten Bakersfield, and the odds are even slimmer that
the Cardinal can pull it off this time.
"We are definitely the underdogs here," wrestling
Coach Chris Horpel said. "Jeff Bradley (142 pounds),
maybe, is the only one favored to win. He is the only
wrestler to have beaten a Bakersfield wrestler this
year.
"We beat them last year, but they are fired up to
avenge that loss," Horpel said.
Dave Lee will go up against Bakersfield's Darryl
Pope, one of the nation's top wrestlers in the 177-
pound class. The two met in last Saturday's Doc Peter
son Open, with Pope winning 15-9. Horpel feels it
would be an upset if Lee beat Pope tomorrow, but he
said the task is not impossible.
The Cardinal will start immediately at a disadvantage
because as the team will forfeit at 118 pounds, because
Mason Gomez is not yet prepared to wrestle in Hor
pel's opinion. Stanford did have some good news as
freshman Josh Lyle returned to the team after having

to take the fall quarter off due to an ear operation. Lyle
is also not ready to perform, but when he is healthy, he
will wrestle at 118.
To prepare for Bakersfield, Horpel scheduled two
soft practices earlier this week in order to allow the
athletes to recover from last week's rigorous road trip.
An important part of this week's trainning was a talk on
how the wrestlers should put the rest of the season in
perspective.
"I am not making too big of a deal of this meet, for
we are onto the trail leading to the Pac-10 Champion
ships," Horpel said. "We are just going to do the best
we can, and the pressure is off of us for they are heav
ily favored."
For the Cardinal wrestlers, the whole season is
geared toward the Pac-10 Championship so they can
qualify for the NCAA Championship March 13 in lowa
City, lowa. So while a winning dual meet season is
desirable, most of the emphasis in trainning and com
petition is for continual improvement so the wrestlers
will peak at the end of the season.
Because of the size of the NCAA Championship, and
the high level of competition, it is possible for a school
to have only four or five really good wrestlers and still
place high in the final NCAA standings if they earn Ail-
American honors.
A team may have a losing dual meet season, yet the
season maybe called a success if the team finishes high
in the final standings at the NCAA Championship.
