# Men Get Back Into the Swim
## 
### AMY FRANCETIC Staff writer 
The Stanford men's swim team,
anticipating a weekend of stiff com
petition after a week and a half of in
tense training over the winter
break, will travel to Berkeley to
participate in the Cal Invitational
today, tomorrow and Sunday.
Because the Cal Invite is organ
ized like the NCAA Championships,
"It will be excellent preparation,"
for the NCAAs, which will be held
the first week of April, Asst. Coach
Ted Knapp said, "A good dozen
USS teams will be there, along with
familiar college teams like San Jose
State, Chico State and Hayward."
Knapp predicts that Stanford will
swim strongly, saying he believes
the rival Bears will be the Cardinal's
best competition.
Stanford met Berkeley earlier
this year at a home dual meet, and
easily defeated them, but Knapp
predicts that this weekend will be a
"truer test" of the Cardinal's skill
due to the winter break training.
The Invitation preliminary races
will begin at 9 a.m., and the finals
will commence at 1 p.m. each day.

While most of the squad will be in
Berkeley, the Cardinal freshmen
swimmers and a couple upperclass
men will compete against UC-Davis
at 1 p.m. Saturday at DeGuerre
pool.
"We need to get the freshmen
racing, and dual meets are good
practice. We try to set up as many
local races as possible."
Head Coach Skip Kenney had his
swimmers return to campus the
day after Christmas to train in
tensely. They swam double ses
sions nearly everyday, piling up 21
workouts in 12 days. "Except for
Jeff Garr, it was one of our health
iest breaks ever, and we swam
harder and faster than last year,"
Knapp said.
Knapp said frosh freestyler Garr
suffered a blood clot on his lung — a
rare and complicated health disorder
for someone his age — and under
went an operation over vacation.
Garr is doing well and recovering
steadily.
This weekend's Cal Invitational
and the UC-Davis meet kick off the
month of January for the Stanford
men's swim team, and Knapp hopes
it will be the beginning of a "real
good championship season."
