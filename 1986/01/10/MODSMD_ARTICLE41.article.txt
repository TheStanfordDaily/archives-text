# Women Swim at Cal
## Last meet before season opener 
### MARY K. McDEVITT Staff writer 
In the Cardinal's last meet before
the dual-meet season begins, the
Stanford women travel to Spieker
Aquatic Complex in UC-Berkeley
tomorrow for the Cal Invitational.
The meet, which will include
teams from UC-Santa Barbara, San
Jose State, Hayward State, San
Francisco State and the University
of the Pacific, as well as Stanford
and Cal, precedes the dual-meet
season that opens for most univer
sities next weekend.
The three-day invitational is de
signed to give the swimmers "a

chance to swim in a meet that has
trials and finals before conference
(championships). All the rest of the
meets from here on out are dual
meets," Cal Coach Karen Moe
Thornton said. In dual meet compe
tition, the swimmers race only once
in each event.
The early season meet, which
will not be scored, will allow swim
mers to race in a variety of events
instead of just those in which they
specialize during the dual meet
season, Thornton said.
The meet will serve as physical
conditioning and race experience
for the Cardinal. "We want to be

able to race from the gun and to get
the heart rates up," Stanford Coach
George Haines said.
Cardinal swimmers will race in
three individual events plus relays
tomorrow, but they will not com
pete today so they can train in
stead, Haines said.
Distance swimmers will compete
on Sunday in the 1,650-yard
freestyle. The mile-long race is un
common to dual meets and some
Cardinal swimmers will use the op
portunity at the Cal Invitational to
get qualifying times for the Confer
ence Championships in late
EVÂ»hrm*;)ry.
