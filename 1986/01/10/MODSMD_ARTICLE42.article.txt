## Hurst Confident of Win 
### LISA MARTINEZ Staff writer 
For an excited Coach Buzz Hurst and the Stan
ford fencing team, the action begins once again as
the Cardinal fencers meet UC-Santa Cruz Saturday at
1 p.m. in Roble Gym.
With renewed confidence after the winter recess,
Hurst said he expects a good performance from his
fencers on Saturday. "Team spirit seems outstanding,
and we are in excellent condition after the break," he
said.
Led by Bryn Kanar, foil, Santa Cruz (3-0) presents a
formidable challenge for the Cardinal. "Santa Cruz has
snuck up on us two seasons in a row and has given us
fits, so we will not take them for granted in any fash
ion," Hurst said.

However, the Cardinal coach is confident of his
team's performance. "I suspect a close matchup in
epee, but we are considerably stronger in sabre and
somewhat stronger in foil," he said.
With a 2-0 record, the Stanford fencing program got
a big boost last month when the Fencing News ranked
the men as the No. 7 team in the nation, while the
women were listed at No. 6.
"Morale was raised a great deal as a result of the na
tional poll," Hurst said. "This is a particularly good sign
because most voters were from the Midwest and East,
so the fact that their perception of Stanford as one of
the major fencing powers in the country is
remarkable."
Also over the break, several Cardinal fencers placed
in national competition. Jennifer Yu, women's foil cap
tian, took 14th in the nationals and Eliot Chu, her
cousin and the men's foil captain, placed 21st.
