British Defense Secretary Quits
LONDON — Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine resigned yes
terday, charging Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher with perverting
Britain's system of collective Cabinet government and willfully ma
nipulating a defense decision of "profound" importance.
Heseltine's surprise resignation was viewed here as the most
serious political crisis of Thatcher's six-and-a-half years in office, and
provided an unusually open look at dissension within a government
that has been fiercely protective of the secrecy of its decision
making process.
The immediate cause of Heseltine's departure was a dispute over
rival bids to take over a major share of Britain's ailing Westland
Helicopters by the U.S. manufacturer Sikorsky Aircraft and a con
sortium of Western European companies.
Underlying yesterday's events are larger issues involving long
circulating reports of dissatisfaction among some Cabinet members
who object to Thatcher's style of leadership, which they have des
cribed as autocratic and authoritarian.
Among other things, Heseltine accused Thatcher of "ill-temper,"
cancellation of scheduled Cabinet meetings once it was clear that she
would be disagreed with, approving the censorship of minutes from
Cabinet meetings in which dissension had arisen and seeking to pres
ent a public image of policy that was belied by actions taken in
private.
The government made no public response to the specifics of
Heseltine's bitter attack, except to say that its version of events was
"at variance" in some areas with that of Heseltine. In a letter accept
ing his resignation, Thatcher said it was "a matter for regret."
The new defense chief is George Younger, promoted from his
former post as Cabinet secretary in charge of Scotland. During the
mid-19705, when Thatcher's Conservative Party was out of govern
ment, Younger served as its defense spokesman.
Japan Agrees To Open Markets
WASHINGTON — After a year of tough negotiations, Japan has
made major concessions in agreeing to open its markets to American
telecommunications and electronics products, government and in
dustry officials said yesterday.
"From a legal and regulatory perspective, I think we'd have to say
everything is done," U.S. negotiator Clyde Prestowitz said in
Tokyo.
Agreed an electronics industry executive, who asked not to be
identified: "We really feel our government negotiators have done a
good, aggressive job of pursuing the issues we were interested in."
The progress in opening Japanese markets will be emphasized
today in a meeting here between Secretary of State George Shultz
and Japanese Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe, officials in Washington
indicated.
For the Reagan Administration, success in efforts to open Japan's
markets is vital politically. A failure to get more American goods into
the hands of Japanese consumers, while Americans buy ever
growing volumes of Japanese products, could prompt punitive
protectionist action by Congress, the Administration believes.
Japan enjoyed a trade surplus estimated at $50 billion last year in
its commerce with the United States, making American companies
and government officials anxious to remove Tokyo's barriers to
American goods. Talks during the past year have focused on four
types of merchandise: electronics, telecommunications, phar
maceuticals and forest products.
ANC Escalates Military Activity
LUSAKA, Zambia — The African National Congress, the main
guerrilla group fighting to overthrow South Africa's minority white
government, disclosed plans here yesterday for the sharp escalation
of its attacks throughout the country as a step toward a full "people's
war."
Oliver Tambo, the president of the ANC, said that many more
guerrillas will be recruited, trained and armed to expand the
Congress' military wing, "drawing miUions of our people into com
bat," and that their attacks would be extended well beyond South
Africa's black townships into white areas of the country.
Tambo made clear the ANC's determination not only to increase
the pressure on President Pieter Botha's government, already badly
shaken by a year and a half of unremitting civil unrest, but to force
white South Africans to choose between the dismantling of the apart
heid system of racial segregation and minority white rule and a
bloody civil war with the country's black majority.
In other news, an anti-apartheid group joined with the United Mine
Workers and the AFL-CIO yesterday in launching a nationwide
boycott against Shell Oil Co., calling on Americans to tear up their
Shell credit cards and picket the corporation's businesses.
Through its subsidiaries, Shell Oil's parent company, Royal Dutch-
Shell Group, has a variety of petroleum and mining interests in South
Africa "which both enhance the repressive capabilities of the
Pretoria government and contribute to its economic vitality,"
declared a spokesman for the Free South Africa Movement, an anti
apartheid coalition.
Jack Doherty, a spokeman for Shell Oil, called the boycott "clearly
misplaced and very unfair."
War Widens in El Salvador
JUAYUA, El Salvador — Leftist guerrillas launched their first
major attack in the economically important western province of Son
sonate early yesterday, destroying four coffee processing plants,
burning a bank and battling a civil defense patrol and government
troops for several hours.
Sonsonate and neighboring Ahuachapan, on the Guatemalan bor
der, were the only two of El Salvador's 14 provinces that had not
previously been scenes of conflict during this country's six-year-old
civil war. After the new year, guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti Na
tional Liberation Front vowed to bring the war into those western
provinces which, together with the province of Santa Ana, produce
about 80 percent of the country's coffee crop, which is El Salvador's
biggest source of export income.
Economic sabotage is a key tactic of the Farabundo Marti front, an
alliance of five rebel groups battling the U.S.-backed government of
President Jose Napoleon Duarte. Sonsonate province is part of the
country's economic backbone, with El Salvador's most important
port, as well as coffee farms, processing plants and sugar refineries.
