# Reagan Seeks Support for Sanctions
## Khadafy hopes to force a rift between the United States and its allies 
### 
WASHINGTON and TRIPOLI, Libya — Pres
ident Reagan has asked allied leaders in personal
letters not to undercut U.S. sanctions against
Libya by replacing American oil companies and
workers being ordered out of that country, Ad
ministration officials said yesterday. Meanwhile,
Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy said he hopes
to drive a wedge between the U.S. and its
European allies.
Reagan's appeal to leaders in Western Europe
and Japan was confirmed by the White House as
Secretary of State George Shultz told a news
conference that "to date we haven't made much
headway" in persuading other nations to join the
U.S. sanctions, aimed at Libyan support of inter
national terrorism.
Indications that the Administration has
lowered its sights to a "don't undercut" posture
came from several official sources.
In just about his only optimistic remark about
allied reactions, Shultz said that "I think that
there will be a reluctance to move into the roles
(in Libya) that the United States is leaving." An
other senior official said "the main thing" the Ad
ministration is seeking right now is for the allies

not to undercut the U.S. sanctions ordered by
Reagan Tuesday.
Four American oil companies, with an un
known number of American workers, are re
ported to be responsible for 70 to 80 percent of
Libya's production of crude oil and an important
share of the marketing of Libyan oil in Europe
and elsewhere. If U.S. workers leave and are
not replaced, an official said, "our sanctions
would stick."
Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead will
travel to European capitals next week to
"explain our point of view," Shultz announced.
Holding out little hope for an immediate change
in European reluctance to move against Libya,
Shultz said that "just because others are not
prepared to do the right thing is not any reason
why the United States shouldn't do the right
thing." Meanwhile, in Tripoli, Khadafy last
night publicly proclaimed his hopes of forcing a
rift between the United States and its Western
European allies.
Khadafy said at a press conference here that
he will attemDt to build on the Arab and interna

tional support shown him in the face of the
Reagan Administration's boycott to force the
U.S. military out of its bases in Europe and drive
its fleet from the Mediterranean.
In a bid resembling Soviet efforts to pull West
ern Europe away from the United States,
Khadafy repeatedly suggested that Washington
is sacrificing Europe's interests for its own.
Without giving specifics, he also said he would
"support" peace movements in Europe to un
dermine the American position there.
Apparently interpreting the Europeans'
refusal to go along with Washington's proposed
economic sanctions as a sign that America's
allies already are sympathetic to his regime,
Khadafy proposed to "shoulder the responsibil
ity" of creating "a new international zone that
will consist of Europe, the Mediterranean and
the Arab and African countries to preserve
peace and human civilization."
The Libyan leader said his nation has long
been prepared for the U.S. boycott and would
not be not hurt by the freezing of its assets an
nounced Wednesday in Washington.
