# Tutu Calls Prospects for S. Africa 'Horrendous'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Bishop Des
mond Tutu, South Africa's Nobel
Peace Prize winner, said yesterday
that prospects for his racially
troubled nation were "quite horren
dous" and suggested that the
country's white rulers might use
nuclear weapons to carry out "their
own version of a scorched-earth
policy."
"I myself actually fear that in the
end, because they are so irrational,
they seem to have a Samson com
plex. . . . They are going to pull
down the pillars and everybody
must go under with them," Tutu
said in an interview with editors and

reporters at The Washington Post.
"If, as most of us believe, they
do have nuclear capability, I don't
put it past them to have their own
version of a scorched-earth policy,"
he said of the white minority regime
in Pretoria.
Tutu is here on a three-week
tour to rally American support for
additional U.S. sanctions against
South Africa for its apartheid
policies. He painted a bleak — and
at times apocalyptic — picture of
his nation's future as well as that of
black moderates like himself, who
he said were increasingly shunted
aside by blacks as "ineffectual

leaders."
The 54-year-old Anglican Bishop
of Johannesburg somberly sugges
ted that his own patience is wearing
thin in the search for non-violent
ways to overthrow apartheid.
"You may find," Tutu remarked,
"that even placid, quiet people like
us have suddenly picked up stones
and we are fighting."
Tutu predicted the onset of "an
ugly phase which has the potential
for being horrible" in South Africa,
a time of "naked terrorism, really."
He warned that militant black at
tacks on "soft targets," such as
school buses, were now possible.

He also conjured the image of black
servants poisoning their white
masters.
Tutu also disclosed that he and
other moderate blacks met secretly
with a ranking member of the South
African Cabinet, but said the ses
sion produced few results because
the minister had insisted that the
discussion be conducted "in the
parameters of apartheid."
Tutu chided the South African
government for its "inept" relations
with the nation's black majority,
calling the country's white rulers "a
centipede determined to shoot
themselves in every foot."
