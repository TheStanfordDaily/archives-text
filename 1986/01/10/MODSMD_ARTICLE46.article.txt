Market Plunge Slows
NEW YORK — The stock market's record
setting fall slowed yesterday, but Wall Street
analysts were unwilling to predict a resump
tion of the vigorous rally of the last four
months.
The widely watched Dow Jones industrial
average fell 8.38 points yesterday to close at
1,518.23. With Wednesday's historic 39.10-
point drop, the index has fallen more than 47
points from Tuesday's record high of
1,565.71. Yesterday's volume on the New
York Stock Exchange was a very heavy 176.46
million shares, down only slightly from Wed
nesday's 180.33 million.
The dizzying rise and fall of the Dow and
other market indices left government and
private financial analysts groping for explana
tions. Some cited arcane technical theories for
the so-called "correction," some looked to
Federal Reserve Board policies and
pronouncements and others pointed to political
events, such as the recently announced eco
nomic sanctions against Libya.
If there was one point of agreement, it was
that the 270-point rise in the Dow industrial
average since September had to stop some
where.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said
that President Reagan is "taking bets" that on
July 1 stocks will be selling at higher prices
than today.
The conventional wisdom on Wall Street and

in Washington is that the nation's financial
markets will experience a brief period of
relatively frantic activity, with wide stock price
swings. Eventually, perhaps in a month or six
weeks, the markets will settle into a moderate
upward trend, according to this view.
Budget Reforms
WASHINGTON — President Reagan is
planning to urge Congress to enact further
budget reforms that could produce a deal this
year on spending priorities and thus avoid the
automatic budget cuts triggered under the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law, officials said
yesterday.
The budget reforms are to be one feature of
the Jan. 28 State of the Union speech in which
Reagan is also planning to demand that
Congress not approve any tax increase this
year, officials said.
One budget-reform proposal Reagan is ex
pected to offer in the address is that Congress
allow the president to sign the yearly budget
resolution, which now is an agreement on
spending between the houses of Congress.
While Reagan seeks to influence the resolu
tion, he is not now required to sign it.
Including a presidential signature might turn
the budget resolution into a "compact" be
tween Reagan and Capitol Hill, and perhaps
avert the automatic cuts that would come in
the absence of such an agreement, officials
said. The idea has been advocated internally

by Office of Management and Budget director
James Miller 111. However, some officials point
out that Reagan and Congress start the year
far from any common ground on the key issues
of defense spending and taxes.
Farm Population Dips
WASHINGTON — The nation's hard
pressed farm population declined significantly
last year, Census Bureau analysts and a De
partment of Agriculture expert agreed yester
day, saying that a substantial part of the drop
was due to the current financial crisis in rural
America.
The number of Americans' living on farms
plunged by 399,000 last year, from 5,754,000
in 1984 to 5,355,000 — a 7 percent falloff that
would be the sharpest in eight years, census
analyst Diana DeAre said in an interview.
"This is the first significant change we've
seen in the number of farmers since the early
1980s," DeAre said.
While agreeing that the decline in farm popu
lation last year was consequential, Calvin
Beale, head of population studies at the
Agriculture Department, pegged it at about
3.5 percent and contended the census esti
mate was overstated because of sampling
problems.
In the 19605, annual farm population losses
averaged 4.6 percent, while in the 1970s they
stood at 2.9 percent.
