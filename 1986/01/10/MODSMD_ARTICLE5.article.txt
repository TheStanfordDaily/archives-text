# Group To Investigate Water Contamination
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
Tests will begin today to deter
mine if possibly cancer-causing pol
lutants found in groundwater under
the Stanford Research Park have
seeped into wells in Barron Park, a
small residential neighborhood in
Palo Alto.
The University has commis
sioned a consultant group to comply
with a state Department of Health
Services request that Stanford in
vestigate whether the contamina
tion from the research park has
spread downhill to the bordering
Barron Park neighborhood, accord
ing to University Property Manager
Lisa Burnett.
The University itself does not
perform research in the Stanford
Research Park, but it leases land in
the industrial park to private com
panies.
"Stanford is not a generator and
would not be a source (of the con
tamination), but we do have a re
sponsibility as a land owner," Bur
nett said.
The consultant group called in by
the University will know by Jan. 30
if the toxins have spread to the Bar
ron Park wells, which are used for
gardening and irrigation but not as
drinking water, Burnett said.
"We're concerned about the
quality of the water in the Barron
Park wells," she added.
The groundwater contamination
of the Stanford Research Park was
first discovered by a tenant, the
Watkins-Johnson Co., in June 1984.
While testing subsurface water
near an underground gas tank on its
lot, Watkins-Johnson discovered
unsafe concentrations of three
chemicals used as solvents in the
manufacturing of electronics.
The toxic pollutants are:
trichloroethylene (TCE),
trichloroethane (TCA) and
dichloroethylene. Freon 113 was
also found but, unlike the other
three, it is not currently considered
a possible carcinogen.
Because the pollutants can
evaporate, the well water, if con
taminated, would be dangerous
only if used for drinking water and
would not pose health risks if used
for irrigation, said Jenifer Gates,
environmental specialist for the
University.
The Department of Health
Services, which is overseeing the
testing, said there are several steps
to solving the problem: identify the
extent of contamination, determine
if any contaminated water is being
used for drinking purposes, and
develop a plan to clean up all the
contaminated sites, including the
Watkins-Johnson property.
The University said the investi
gation is "precautionary" and does
not imply that the contamination
has spread to the groundwater
beneath the nearby residental area.

Gates emphasized the fact that
the wells are 1.8 miles from the site
where Watkins-Johnson discovered
the toxins, making it unlikely that
the wells have been contaminated.
"This is not a big deal," she said.
But even if today's tests reveal
that the Barron Park wells are un
contaminated, the Watkins-Johnson
site will have to be cleaned up.
There have been other toxic
spills in the Stanford Research Park
but this is only the second time that
a spill has been close enough to
pose a threat to the surrounding
area, according to Gates.
The last time the neighboring
area was threatened, levels on the
border were found to be safe —
one part per billion, Gates said.
This case also is unlike those in
the past because no one knows for
certain who is responsible for the
spill. Nor is there any guarantee
that today's testing will indicate
who caused the spill.
"We're hoping it will, but it may
not be possible to identify who did
it," said Howard Hatayama, super
visor of site mitigation for the De
partment of Health Services.
If the guilty party is not found,
the University, as the landowner,
and some combination of its tenants
may be forced to pay the clean-up
costs as a group, Gates said.
Although the toxins, which are
commonly used in the industrial
park, were discovered on the prop
erty that Watkins-Johnson rents
from the University, it is not clear if
that company is actually respon
sible.
Watkins-Johnson has said it is not
responsible and cites several
reasons: the toxins have not been
found in the soil above the con
taminated subsurface water, subse
quent testing shows that the high
est concentrations are on the west
ern border of its property, and con
centration levels decrease to the
east (toward Barron Park).
This evidence indicates the spill
occurred west of Watkins-Johnson
and is traveling downhill (east) in
the groundwater, said Steve Wit
mer, manager of communications
for Watkins-Johnson.
Witmer said the Regional Water
Control Board sent Watkins-
Johnson a written statement in
which the board agreed that
Watkins-Johnson was not respon
sible.
The Regional Water Control
Board then referred the matter to
the Department of Health Services
because no party was clearly «e
-sponsible for introducing the con
taminants to the ground water, ac
cording to Gates.
The Department of Health
Services, however, has not ruled
out Watkins-Johnson, and officials
believe that there may be more
than one party responsible.
"At this point, we are assuming
Watkins-Johnson is one of the
sources," said Hatayama.
