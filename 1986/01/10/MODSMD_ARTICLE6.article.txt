# Students Are Up Before Sun for Tickets

Passers-by may have thought
that the 200 students gathered
around Braun Music Center yester
day afternoon were waiting in a
daily Stanford Post Office line, but
the crowd had bigger plans.
The first 150 tickets for Stan
ford's annual Viennese Ball went on
sale at 4 p.m., and the wait began at
5:15 yesterday morning. With lawn
chairs, blankets, books, tape
decks, cards and the Ã¼biquitous
Trivial Pursuit game boards, stu
dents drifted into White Plaza all
morning, prepared to fight off rival
lines, cold weather and boredom.
"We've been generally treated
like refugees," said sophomore
Bruce Brown, who arrived at White
Plaza before 6 a.m. and boasted
that he saw Dean of Admissions
Jean Fetter giving to work.
Organizers of the ball decided to
sell tickets in the afternoon instead
of the morning so that students
would not have to camp out to get a

place in line, as they have in
previous years. The strategy
worked.
"It's a better system this
year," said junior Nori Juba,
who was able to purchase a
pair of tickets yesterday even
though he didn't get in line un
til noon.
Juba was the second to last
person to buy tickets, but,
thanks to a new system in
which everyone in line was
given numbers early in the
day, he knew as soon as he
arrived that he would be able
to obtain a pair of tickets.
The ninth annual Viennese
Ball, scheduled for Jan. 25 in
Roble Athletic Complex, will
feature Viennese waltzing,
polka and swing dancing, to
the tunes of George Frideric
Handel and Richard Strauss,
according to graduate student
Klaus See-Tho, co
coordinator of music and
choreography for the ball.
About 650 people will at
tend the black tie affair, in
cluding an array of
distinguished guests,
rumored to include a senior
official from Washington,
D.C.
Free waltzing, polka and
swing dancing lessons will be
offered at the Elliot Program
Center beginning Sunday, and
several activities have been
scheduled for Austria Week,
which culminates in the Satur
day night ball, according to
senior Libby Osborne.
Osborne, co-coordinator of
music and choreography, said
that more than 80 people are
involved in the planning of the
week's events.
