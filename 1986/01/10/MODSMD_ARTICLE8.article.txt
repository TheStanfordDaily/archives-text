# Med School Receives Grant

Stanford Medical School has received a $12.6 million
grant from the Lucille P. Markey Charitable Trust to
support the establishment of a Department of Develop
mental Biology, the trust announced Wednesday.
The funds will be used to support additional faculty
members, staff and initial research, as well as to pro
vide laboratory equipment, and will enable Stanford to
begin recruitment of eight faculty members for the new
department.
"Our grant recognizes the existing strength in
biomedical research at Stanford, and the opportunity
now to build on that strength and ensure further signifi
cant advances in the understanding of the complex
process of development," said Louis Hector, chairman
of the Miami-based trust.
The new department is one of four academic units
that comprise the $50 million Center for Molecular and
Genetic Medicine directed by Dr. Paul Berg, a 1980
Nobel prize winner in chemistry. The other units will
be biochemistry, molecular and cell physiology and the
Hughe* laboratory in molecular and genetic medicine.

Construction of the center will begin this summer.
Developmental biology is a funddamental science
likely to have an impact on genetic medicine. Its focus
is understanding how the multicellular structures of the
adult organism result from the fertilized egg.
"One benefit of an enhanced basic understanding of
development is the more effective transfer of dis
coveries from basic research to the study of human
disease," Berg said.
The goal is to create a principal center of research
and teaching by developing a focal point of communica
tion and collaboratin among scientists throughout the
University whose research impinges on problems of
development, according to Berg.
Other funding for the center has been provided by
the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation of Corona
Del Mar and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.
Fundraising efforts are continuing for the remaining
$12 million needed for the project, said Stephen Peeps,
associate director of medical center development.
