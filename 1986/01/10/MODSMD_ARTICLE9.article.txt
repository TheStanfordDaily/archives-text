# Franklin Contends Breach of Rights
## Former Stanford prof. condemns his dismissal 
### LARRY WEBER Staff writer 
Despite the California Supreme Court's
refusal, announced Monday, to review a lawsuit
by former Assoc. English Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin against the University, Franklin main
tains the faculty Advisory Board that fired him
overstepped the First Amendment.
I he Dec. 31 state supreme court decision af
firms a previous Santa Clara County Court of Ap
peals judgment that upheld the Advisory Board's
dismissal, which was prompted by a 1972 anti
war speech in which Franklin urged student
protesters to shut down a campus computer
facility.
The only legal option now remaining for
Franklin and his American Civil Liberties Union
attorney, Margaret Crosby, is an appeal to the
United States Supreme Court. The two have yet
to discuss this option.
"I think (the state supreme court decision) is
an extremely serious blow to freedom of expres
sion, not just for professors but for everybody,"
said Franklin, now a tenured English professor

Joel Kurland, a member of the American As
sociation of University Professors committee
that reviewed the case, does not agree with
Franklin.
The decision will not have any significant ef
fect on individual rights, according to Kurland.
"We looked at this case in terms of academic
freedom, which is not synonymous with free
speech," he said.
"In terms of what he said and did and what is
protected by academic freedom, the courts have
found clearly that some things were not covered
ncndemic freedom," Kurland said.
The University's case against Franklin has
been strong from the beginning, according to
David Heilbron, the attorney with the San Fran
cisco firm McCutcheon, Doyle, Brown and Ener
son who represented Stanford.
"Certainly there was no violation of First
Amendment rights, insofar as in this case there
was an incitement to cause people to achieve
goals by force and not by persuasion," Heilbron
said.
Franklin, however, remains adamant that be
cause his words were the instruments of incite
ment, his case is a violation of free speech.

"It never really occurred to me that those
words I was speaking would be grounds for firing
that would be sustained in a court of law,"
Franklin said.
Crosby warned that the Santa Clara County
Court of Appeals decision is a precedent for
future related cases, which implies that faculty
members might lose their jobs for participating in
campus demonstrations.
"If many people c?nc together in support of a
cause and some acts of civil disobedience oc
curred, professors would be in trouble if they
participated in the civil disobedience," Crosby
said.
Franklin echoed her concern.
"People are going to have to consider very
carefully when they're speaking their minds
whether or not their opinions will come back and
be potentially damaging to them," Franklin said.
Heilbron, however, cited Franklin's plea for
students to use force as the distinguishing mark
of the case and the determining factor of the
court decision.
"In my view, there is no way this decision
should deter in any way peaceful speech
making," Heilbron said.
