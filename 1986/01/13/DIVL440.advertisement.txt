Professor Leon Litwack
A Pulitzer Prize winning historian from
U.C. Berkeley presenting a multi-media presentation
"TO LOOK FOR AMERICA:
FROM HIROSHIMA TO WOODSTOCK"
Professor Litwack utilizes contemporary
photographs, music, film, radio and
television to examine American society in a
highly selective and impressionistic way. The
materials themselves provide the narration.
Professor Litwack won the Pulitzer Prize in history for
his book Been In the Storm So Long, and is currently the
president-elect of the Organization of American
Historians. He will answer questions after the
