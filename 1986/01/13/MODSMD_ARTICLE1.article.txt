# Owners Mixed On Well Tests

### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
lests commissioned by Stanford to determine
whether toxic chemicals found in groundwater under
the Stanford Research Park have spread to wells in
Barron Park have elicited mixed reactions from the
residents of the Palo Alto neighborhood.
"We value our privacy," Barron Park resident Ken
Arutunian said yesterday. Arutunian, who owns one of
the seven private wells in the neighborhood currently
being tested, has been approached by the press many
times since Watkins-Johnson Co., a tenant of the re
search park, raised the question of possible
groundwater contamination in June 1984.
Some Barron Park residents, however, appear un
happy about the publicity accompanying the testing.
One well-owning resident, according to the San Jose
Mercury News, refused to have her well tested at all.
"There's a limit to how much press and publicity
(Barron Park residents) want," Arutunian said. "But
the bottom line is, we want to make sure our water is
safe."
The University, which leases land in the research
park to private industrial companies, is complying with
a State Department of Health Services request that
Stanford investigate whether contamination from the
park has seeped downhill to the bordering neighbor-
hood, University Property Manager
Lisa Burnett said.
Results of testing for the toxic
pollutants, which include trichloro
ethylene (TCE), trichloroethane
(TCA) and dichloroethy'ene, will be
released Jan. 30.
Jennifer Gates, environmental
specialist for the University, said
Friday that the well water, if con
taminated, could be dangerous if
used for drinking water.
Arutunian said the investigation
"points out the relations between
the industrial park to the surround
ing neighborhood."
Residents may be forced to take

their complaints to the Palo Alto
City Council, Arutunian predicted.
"The whole community is very
concerned," Arutunian said. "Is this
an appropriate place for (the indus
trial park)?"
Barron Park resident Douglas
Graham, who has researched the
neighborhood's history, said well
contamination is an "absolute dan
ger," due to the geography of the
valley. A connective underground
layer connects the ground water of
the research park to the lower-lying
residential area, Graham said.
"Since we're below, we're con
cerned," Graham said.
Gates said yesterday that she
had no current knowledge of any
testing results.
