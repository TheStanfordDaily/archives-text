# Halley's Comet Disappears
## Famed visitor blocked by sun; will reappear in March 
### DOUG POST 
While it is clearly not the spectacle it was in
1910, Halley s Comet will be visible to Stanford
students again after it takes a three-month hiatus
behind the sun, said Ronald Bracewell, a radio
astonomer and professor of electrical engineer
ing.
When the comet reappears in March it will be
at its brightest and gradually dim as it heads off
to complete another 76-year orbit to Neptune
and back. According to Bracewell, who was
speaking as part of an exhibit at Green Library
called, "Starry Messengers: Comets in Science
and Society, the comet should appear in the
southern skies about 20 degrees above the
horizon at Stanford's latitude.
In December the comet crossed the earth's
path as it sped toward the sun only to disappear
behind the sun, where it will be blocked from
view for the next three months. In 1910, when
the comet last appeared, the earth was in a dif
ferent phase of its orbit giving astronomers a
much better view of the comet, Bracewell said.
To get the best view of the comet when it
returns, comet-watchers should head to South
America, Australia or even Mexico, where a con
siderably better view will be available, Bracewell
said.
But if heading south is out of the question, a
pair of binoculars will be one of the best ways to
watch the comet.
Commenting on the history of the comet,
Bracewell said images of comets have been
found among ancient Chinese, Babylonian and
Aztec artifacts. Imagery of Halley's comet is also
prominent in records of the Norman Conquest in
1066.
But it was not until the time of Sir Edmund
Halley and his contemporary Sir Isaac Newton

that the orbit of the comet was deduced and
people finally understood it was the same comet
that returned every 76 years.
While in the past the comet had been inter
preted as an omen of evil, more recently it has
been an object of popular amusement. In 1910 it
was celebrated with the Halley's Comet Rag, a

dance tune, and was greeted by the press with
numerous caricatures.
When can we expect to see Halley's famous
comet again? Unless it is knocked off its path by
some interplanetary intruder, as sometimes hap
pens to comets, Bracewell guessed the comet
ought to approach earth sometime around 2061.
