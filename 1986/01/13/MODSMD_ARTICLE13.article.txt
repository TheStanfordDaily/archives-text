While the University has finally combined the mail
system and the computer to eliminate wasteful
queues and ease the registration/tuition procedures,
our intramurals program continues to live in the
Stone Age. The perennial sign of a new quarter is
the endless line of students attempting to sign up for
an intramural team.
Intramurals are supposed to be a fun and spirited
diversion from the rigors of academics. Participation
is encouraged, and the competition and camaraderie
form an integral part of campus life. Is it a deliberate
plot or an inadvertent coincidence that these intra
mural team registration procedures are so cum
bersome and inconsiderate of student time?
The long line determines which teams will partici
pate and in which time slot a team will play. In the
case of basketball, your position in line may be criti
cal to playing before midnight. The fact remains that

those students most willing to skip class and wait in
line the longest get their first choice.
The inconvenience and frustration could be
eliminated by signing up through LOTS or by com
pleting a registration form prior to a drawing. A des
ignated priority system or a random lottery could
determine the playing schedule. The savings in
wasted student time would be immense.
Money is not the obstacle to a better system. The
stylish golf carts driven by officials attest to the
wealth and opulence of the intramurals program. Is
it then a need for power, a fondness for tradition, a
lack of foresight or the appealing presence of
hundreds of bodies standing in a row that allows this
archaic and ridiculous system to perpetuate itself?
For less than the price of a golf cart, reform is
possible. With minimal time and effort, the sign-up
procedure could be drastically improved. The entire
student body would applaud this humanitarian effort.
