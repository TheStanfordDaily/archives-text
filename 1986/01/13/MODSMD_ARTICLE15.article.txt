# Imaginary Terrorism, or How To Alleviate Airport Boredom
## 
### 
Well we all are back from the holiday
break. I imagine many people flew home as
I did. So to make a long introduction short,
let me tell you about my plane ride home.
Right after the Poli Sci 35 final, a friend
drove me to the San Francisco airport.
Paranoid as I am about missing flights I
arrived there much too early — even after
checking in and getting something to eat, I
still had an hour and a half to sit and wait
and contemplate. As other passengers
started to arrive at the waiting area, I
scrutinized them and made up stories about
each, explaining why they were the one
carrying the bomb.
A man in a business suit with greasy hair
and awful gold-colored glasses sat down.
He obviously was a failure in business and a
poor provider for his family. He had just
taken out a life insurance policy on himself
and was going to blow himself and the plane
up j^l}jrt hje had his
briefcase. The man was even a failure at his
own death, I thought. I mean, he was
copying the story of "Airport," a 1970
movie starring Dean Martin. This man
couldn't even think of an original way to die.
Next I saw an old woman I estimated to
be in her mid-80s who was carrying a large
knitting bag. Old Granny was senile and
thought that America had gone down the
tubes and she wasn't going to stand for it. It
was unnatural for people to fly, and the
airlines and airports were run by commu
nists. So she was going to blow up the plane
and kill all the communists riding on it.
A man with a beard walked by. "Hmm,
facial hair," I thought to myself, "this man is
a terrorist." This man had comrades in
bondage or something like that — it didn't
matter. What did matter was that he was
carrying a bomb and was going to detonate
a on the plane.
A military man in his 50s sat three seats
to my left. He carried his coat over his arm
so I couldn't tell what rank he was (he
looked like a colonel, but I imagined he was
a general). On the floor beside him he put
his briefcase and a bag of poorly wrapped
Christmas presents. Ha, what a way to dis
guise not a bomb, but the secret docu

ments. And then it all hit me. The terrorist
was here not to blow up the plane, but to
hijack it, take the general and the rest of us
hostage and steal the secret documents. I
then started to think about all the media
coverage this would get. They might
interview my parents, the failed business
man's family, Granny's children. ... An
outside voice brought me back to reality.
"Excuse me, are you going to be sitting
here a while?" It was the general — speak
ing to me. And although my mind was going
wild trying to figure out why the general
was talking to me, I calmly replied, "Yes,
until the plane leaves."
"Would you watch my bags?" he asked.
"I'm going to buy a paperback book."
"Sure," I said.
"What can I get you?" he asked.
"Oh nothing," I replied. I did not want to
appear like I kneyr th£ general because
when we would be hijacked I might be sin
gled out by the terrorist-.
"I asked what can I get you?" he
repeated very forcefully.
Well, I thought I better say something. I
mean, a general was demanding that he buy
me something. What I really wanted was a
Cherry Coke, but a voice inside me said,
"No, try to impress him and ask for some
thing mature. Make him pleased with
American youth and thus less likely to take
Granny's view of America, and thus less
likely to press the button and nuke us all.
Ask for a newspaper or magazine." I almost
requested the Stanford Chaparral, the
world's greatest magazine, but I realized
that it wasn't on sale in the airport. I almost
requested The Daily, but the voice inside
me said, "Remember, impress him." So I
asked for Time magazine. I didn't really
want it, but I thought it might save us from
nuclear destruction.
Upon hearing my answer the general
replied, "Fine," and proceeded to put on his
coat and leave. His coat had many decora
tions (more than I expected), and on his
collar were stars! Holy coincidental
seahorses — this man was a general! And if
he really was a general, then the poorly
wrapped Christmas presents really were

secret documents. Well I don't need to tell
you that I really watched his stuff, I mean, I
glued my eyes to it and looked at nothing
else.
The general was away for quite a long
time and I started to get scared. Maybe the
general was a spy and was leaving the infor
mation for a Russian agent to pick up. The
general might now be making his getaway.
Maybe I'm just a stooge that the general
randomly picked to play some key role in
this international intrigue. But before I
could build on this scenario any further, the
general returned and gave me my maga
zine, and thanked me for watching his stuff.

Boy was that a relief. The general was
not a spy. Now all I had to worry about was
the terrorist. And soon after that I didn't
have to worry about anything, for I and the
other passengers boarded the plane, calling
an end to my boredom (and thus my creat
ing stories about people). The plane took
off for Cincinnati.
Well, as it turned out, the guy that I
imagined was a terrorist sat right next to
me on the plane. We hadn't been in the air
very long when he started a conversation
with me. "Boy I thought this plane would
never leave," he said. "Waiting for this
plane just seemed like the longest time."
"Yes," I said, "I waited a long time too,
but it wasn't so bad for me. I've found ways
that pass the time for me."
"Oh? What do you do?" he asked.
I wondered if I should say what I did. It
was kind of weird but this man seemed
friendly enough, and it was kind of a funny
story so I said, "Well, I know it's weird, but
I make up stories about people and why
they are the ones carrying the bomb. Isn't
that strange?"

"Yeah," he said with a nervous laugh. He
started sweating and becoming very un
easy, but I was talking too much to notice.
"I, ha ha, even had a story about you, ha
ha. I said you were a terrorist and were
going to hijack the plane and steal the se
cret documents that the general was carry
ing," I said. But by this time I noticed how
uneasy the man was getting and I realized
what was really going on. "He thinks your
playing mind games with him," the voice
inside myself said. "He saw you talking to
the general and now you're talking to him
about how you imagined that he was carry
ing a bomb, which is, in fact, what he is ac
tually doing." Then, the terrorist cracked.
"It's all true, you swine. But you can't do
anything to stop me. I have my finger on
the detonator right now. Prepare to die,
because I'm going to blow up this plane and
kill you, the general and the rest of you in
fidel 'j he said.
"But wait,"! Said, "Aren't you going to
use your bomb to hijack the plane, kidnap
the general, and get the secret documents
in the poorly wrapped Christmas
presents?"
"Secret documents?" he asked.
"In the Christmas presents," I said.
"What else could they be? You'd help your
cause so much more by getting them in
stead of just blowing up the plane."
"You're right. What a good plan," he said.
At this he started smiling and looked very
pleased with himself. But then the failed
businessman stood up. "I'm going to blow
up this plane!" he announced to us. "I'm
committing suicide and you're all jcoming
with me!"
"No!" yelled the terrorist. "You're
ruining every thing!" The terrorist sprang
forward out of his seat, grabbed the
businessman and wrestled him to the
ground. I alertly grabbed the terrorist's
bomb.
"This man is a terrorist and he was going
to hijack this plane," I announced. "But I
have his bomb now."
The other passengers breathed a sigh of
relief. Then the terrorist grabbed the
businessman's bomb and said, "But I have

his bomb now, and since my plan was
screwed up I'm just going to blow up this
plane like I originally intended to do!" But
when he detonated it, all it did was make a
loud'click.'
"I'm such a failure — even my bombs
don't explode," the businessman lamented.
Well, all seemed quiet now. Some other
passengers grabbed the terrorist and tied
him up, the businessman was also
restrained. I held the bomb and would give
it to the authorities when we landed.
But then Granny stood up and said,
"America has gone down the tubes.
Today's youth have no morals and no sense
of duty. I'm going to kill us all so none of us
have to live in a country that will soon be
run by these heathens."
"But wait!" I yelled. "What about me?
I'm a youth, and I helped capture a terror
ist."
"Yea," she said, "but you probably read
some kind of perverted nudie magazines."
"No," I said, "I read Time magazine,"
and I held it up for all to see.
"Well OK," she said, "I won't blow up the
plane for your sake."
Well, believe it or not, the plane landed
without any more ordeals. In the Cincinnati
airport the terrorist, businessman and
Granny, along with their bombs, were
handed over to the authorities. The general
then came up to me and said, "I want to
thank you for saving the plane, and I want
to tell you this: I know what you told that
grandma was bull. You don't read Time,
you really wanted a Chaparral or a Cherry
Coke. Grandma was right, the youth of
today are messed up — and when I get
senile I am going to nuke us all. Now that
you know that, give me the Time back."
"Why?" I asked.
"Well first, you're not going to read it.
And second, I concealed the secret docu
ments in between the pages of it,"he said.
"Of course. How could I have been so
stupid?" I asked myself. But it didn't matter
— I was going to go home and sleep.
