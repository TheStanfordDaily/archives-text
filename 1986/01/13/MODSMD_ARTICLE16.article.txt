## Time To Assess Hiring Practices 
### 
We are approaching an historic date: the first
celebration of the birthdate of Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. as a national holiday. It will be difficult,
as it has been each year, to keep one's focus on
his life, rather than the circumstances surround
ing his death. It is difficult because his murder
probably had the support of a large segment of
this society, and with his death the interests of a
large segment of society also perished, or were
seriously deferred.
Coincidentally, many of this year's freshmen

VIEWPOINT

in universities around the country were born the
year of King's death, therefore it should be
recalled to them as well that he was murdered
while on a mission to improve employment con
ditions for black workers in Memphis. It is appro
priate in subject and time to ask what employ
ment gains blacks have made, if any, at Stanford
since his death.
If one compares the list of executive and aca
demic executive officers (non-faculty) in the
front of the Faculty and Staff Directory for 1967-
68 against that of this academic year, one would
find that there is still only a handful of blacks in
well over a hundred positions. The vice
presidential areas, where most staff positions
exist, have rarely had blacks in positions at the
level of director and above. (For example, there
has been only one director from a racial minority
in the history of the Office of Development, and
he was removed from office unceremoniously.)

Indeed, the profile on staff in middle and upper
echelons is that of "the beautiful people," the
yuppies — which blacks are not.
On this score, there is one practice at Stan
ford that has been popularized and is clearly in
consistent with the University's proclamation of
diversity in its workforce. This practice is one of
selecting and promoting individuals who "fit in,"
or the desire for "affinity" groups. Affinity
groupings and affirmative action are obvious con
tradictions, and one or the other must be ter
minated.
There is one other related aspect of affirma
tive action at Stanford that is bewildering. There
has d r v»loped over the years an appreciable
number of racial minorities and women in
personnel-related positions of the University,
moreso than any other major job classification.
One would think that this high personnel repre
sentation would have resulted in more racial
minorities being employed and promoted
throughout the University in non-personnel, line
positions, but such is not the case.
This certainly raises the question of what is
truly gained by communities of color if racial
minorities placed in these positions by the ad
ministration adopt and implement the same value
systems and biases that have existed all along,
and if they allow and encourage the same injus
tices to continue. Personally, I cannot say that
my employment at Stanford has been eased or
greased by their presence.
In addition, as late beneficiaries of affirmative
action, majority women must also examine their

roles as they advance into middle and upper
management of the University. If their advance
ment only results in more of the same, then ra
cial minorities have only seen Jim Crow being
replaced by Jane Doe.
With such an overall institutional record on af
firmative action, how can an office established al
legedly for its promotion be justified? Could the
University do worse without such an office;
could it be that the University might do better
without it? Should that office be allowed to proj
ect itself falsely to the hopeful as being some
thing it is not; should not the office be dismantled
and relegated to one of merely collecting and
reporting data to federal agencies?
The real question in retrospect might be:
Would the affirmative action office have been
allowed to continue if it had been effective? Most
assuredly, under the University's "sunset rule,"
an office and program as ineffective as this one
would have been dissolved long ago, or its lead
ership replaced.
The University is approaching the first
celebration of Dr. King's birthday, and its own
first centennial. I believe it should take these op
portunities to assess what it has done in this sec
tor, and what its future courses of action will be,
for not only are the present courses of (in)action
unproductive for racial minorities, they also
reflect poorly on the integrity of the University. I
pledge my support toward these endeavors.
