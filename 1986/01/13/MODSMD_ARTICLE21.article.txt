# Glee Club Gets Jazzed on Music
## 
### MARK ROGOWSKY 
New Director Michael West
plans to jazz up the Stanford
Glee Club in more ways than
one.
â–  Although the group once in
cluded about 60 or 70 voices,
there are only 16 members now,
about half of them freshmen.
West; however, hopes to move
back toward that peak level.
West's background before this
first year of teaching at Stanford
was jazz-oriented. He started
out doing studio work and
nightclub acts in the '60s. Later,
he did some work in musical
theater.
Now, in perhaps his steadiest
job yet, he works in the vocal
jazz program at San Jose State
in addition to his work with the
Glee Club here.
West uses his artistic side to
do more work in composing and
arranging. He said it is, "really
super to get paid for teaching
people to sing. I love it." He
added that it also "supports his
writing habit, for which he
doesn't get paid."
According to West, the Glee
Club has three functions: to be a
musical outlet for singers, to
teach concepts of good singing
and to represent the University
to the public.
The last of these functions
was demonstrated by the
Christmas caroling the Glee Club
did this year at places such as
nursing homes.
The club performs folk, pop
and jazz, which is a significant
departure from the distant past.
Historically, a glee club sang
Old English folk songs, known as
"glees" for fun and entertain
ment. The groups got their start
at Oxford and Cambridge, and
Harvard's group is one of the
oldest in the United States.
West went on to say that other
than the ability to sing in tune
and read choral music, no special
abilities are required to join the
Glee Club. "Motivation and
desire are as important as tal
ent," he said.
He said he believes that en
semble performing requires in
teraction, trust and support to
make better music. To that end
the group has tried to schedule
picnics and a retreat in hopes of

bringing the group closer to
gether.
Though West said that experi
ence varied greatly among mem
bers, many of them do have ex
tensive musical backgrounds.
Freshman Tim Wood played
clarinet for six years before sing
ing in choral groups during high
school. He said he wanted to find
an upbeat, all-student group to in
which to participate. He has
made a few close friends among
club members and was very pos
itive about the experience and
about West.

Wood said the new director
has, "a strong desire to see the
group improve and be success
ful."
Another freshman in the club,
Jennifer Huffman, has been sing
ing in choirs for nine years. She
described West as "really enthu
siastic, really good," at what he
does. She said, "What's unique
about the Glee Club is that we're
trying to do jazz, unlike the big
University Choir."
As a matter of fact the Glee
Club will be singing with the jazz
band March 8. They will do a
concert outside Tresidder April
11.
Their big concert of the year
is scheduled for May 17 and
should feature a well-known
guest artist. The artist's identity
is being kept secret until his or
her presence is assured.
West said he would like to see
the group expand. There are
openings in all but one section
and anyone interested in joining
should contact him at the Music
Department.
