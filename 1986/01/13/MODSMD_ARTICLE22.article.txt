"The State of the Art"
By Pauline Kael
Dutton, 1985
Pauline Kael chose the title of
her latest collection of reviews,
"State of the Art," because she
hoped that this "ominous and
sweeping and just slightly clinical"
phrase would best express her atti
tude toward moviemaking in the
1980s, when the technological so
phistication of films has far outdis
tanced their sensibility. And
indeed, the only unsatisfying ele
ment this book, which compiles her
New Yorker pieces from June 1983
to July 1985 — all that prevents it
from being as exciting to read as
her best anthologies, "Deeper into
Movies" and "Reeling" — is the dis
piriting state of the art itself.
Looking at the morass of movies
Kael wades through here —
"Flashdance," "Trading Places."
"Staying Alive," "Risky Business,"
"The Moon in the Gutter," "Star
80," "Terms of Endearment" and
"Scarface" are all in the first quar
ter of the book — you wonder how

it is that her enthusiasm for the
medium itself remains undaunted,
how her prose style never loses its
sharp edge and dead-on aim. On
page after page she transforms the
latest sow's ears miraculously into
silk purses. "He appears to believe
that by giving us this gimcrackery
he's turning pop art into high art.
All he actually does in this movie is
take the pleasure out of pop," she
writes of Hugh Hudson and
"Greystoke." Francis Coppola, she
says in her review of "The Cotton
Club," "seems to have skimmed
the top off every '20s-'3os picture
he has seen, added seltzer, stirred
it up with a swizzlestick, and called
it a movie." And in her witty analy
sis, a turkey like the De Niro-
Streep "Falling in Love," which
asks the question, "Can a vacuum
love another vacuum?" becomes an
example of what is wrong with
(especially American) movies
today: "Peter Suschitzsky's
cinematography has a vibrancy that
makes you feel hopeful, and Michael
Kahn's editing has an elating preci
sion, but after a while the pleasures
of technical proficiency shrivel."
By now it is a platitude that
Pauline Kael has written the most
consistently fresh, provocative and
multi-leveled film criticism of the
past two decades. She began
writing for The New Yorker in the
late '60s, when American

filmmakers in particular had grown
looser and more experimental for
the first time since World War 11.
Many of us can date our maturity as
moviegoers from our discovery of
Kael's column, and thus of the po
tential richness and complexity of
the reviewing process when it is
practiced by someone with a com
prehension of the relationship of
movies to the other arts, to the
sociopolitical landscape of their era
and to personal experience. When I
first read Kael as an undergraduate,
American movies were on the
verge of a rennaissance — Altman,
Coppola and Fosse made their ini
tial impact before I was out of col
lege, with Scorsese and De Palma
on deck — and her response to the
best (and some of the worst) crop
of those remarkable years demon
strated, by the depth of her under
standing and the variety of her ap
proach, just how creative and fulfill
ing criticism could be.
What "State of the Art" proves
— aside from the fact that its au
thor, now in her late 60s, has lost
none of her vigor and thoroughness
as a critic, none of her tautness and
vibrancy as a stylist — is that
Pauline Kael is as valuable in an
arid, retrogressive movie era as
she was in a burgeoning one. If
you've endured an experience like
"Entre Nous" or "The Natural" or
"The Breakfast Club," you find her

commentary bracing, resuscitating.
She keeps her readers in constant
touch with the movement of the
medium, the position of the
Zeitgeist. She identifies the distinc
tive qualities of each movie with ap
parently effortless precision — the
"catatonic, shoofly humor" of
"Repo Man," the "neo-Andy Har
dyism" of "Footloose," the imagery
of "The Killing Fields" that
"suggests a documentary made by
a macabre lyric poet." And amid so
much mediocrity and so much out
right garbage, she salvages the
gems that other critics have passed
by, such as "Under Fire," "Moscow
on the Hudson," "Iceman," "The
4th Man," "Dreamscape," "Utu,"
"Comfort and Joy," "Choose Me,"
"Mrs. Soffel" and"The Makioka"
Sisters."
Even her praise, which her
detractors have called immoderate
and disproportionate to the merits
of certain films and directors, is in
truth balanced and measured. In a
long rave review of Barbra
Streisand's "Yentl,' for example,
she isolates the film's shortcomings
— its tendency toward a gloopy sis
terhood feeling in less inspired mo
ments, and the finale, which
"violates the whole musical scheme
of the movie. It also has Streisand
wearing immigrant chic and playing
the Streisand image." The empha
sis in this piece, however, is on the

virtues of a wonderful musical too
few people have seen and appreci
ated. As always, Kael is a priceless
divining rod.
It's difficult to choose a favorite
review in "State of the Art," but I
do have a favorite kind of review:
No one in the short history of movie
criticism has written so beautifully
and with such extraordinary ac
curacy about acting. Here is Kael
on Steve Martin in"The Man with
Two Brains":
"The Steve Martin we see is a
marionette, like the Devo punks;
what holds the strings is the pop
culture he has processed. But he's
not protesting the overload of his
nervous system. His core is burned
out, and he's a happy idiot, all
spasms and twitches, and videotape
for nerve endings."

And, rapturously, on James
Mason and John Gielgud in"The
Shooting Party":
"Mason and Gielgud are like soft
shoe artists; they bring suavity to
their teamwork, with Mason match
ing his melancholy warble to Giel
gud's melodious whine ... the two
can tease each other from inside
the characters they're playing.
They're so amused they're almost
laughing — they're in actors'
heaven."
In a parched movie epoch like
ours, Pauline Kael's criticism is not
merely a supplement to the filmgo
ing experience but a component of
it. We read her as theatergoers
must once have read Hazlitt or
Shaw, or as lovers of literature still
read Bradley or F.R.Leavis or lan
Watt. In her field, Kael is the state
of the art.

late '60s, when American

filmmakers in particular had grown
looser and more experimental for
the first time since World War 11.
Many of us can date our maturity as
moviegoers from our discovery of
Kael's column, and thus of the po
tential richness and complexity of
the reviewing process when it is
practiced by someone with a com
prehension of the relationship of
movies to the other arts, to the
sociopolitical landscape of their era
and to personal experience. When I
first read Kael as an undergraduate,
American movies were on the
verge of a rennaissance — Altman,
Coppola and Fosse made their ini
tial impact before I was out of col
lege, with Scorsese and De Palma
on deck — and her response to the
best (and some of the worst) crop
of those remarkable years demon
strated, by the depth of her under
standing and the variety of her ap
proach, just how creative and fulfill
ing criticism could be.
What "State of the Art" proves
— aside from the fact that its au
thor, now in her late 60s, has lost
none of her vigor and thoroughness
as a critic, none of her tautness and
vibrancy as a stylist — is that
Pauline Kael is as valuable in an
arid, retrogressive movie era as
she was in a burgeoning one. If
you've endured an experience like
"Entre Nous" or "The Natural" or
"The Breakfast Club," you find her

commentary bracing, resuscitating.
She keeps her readers in constant
touch with the movement of the
medium, the position of the
Zeitgeist. She identifies the distinc
tive qualities of each movie with ap
parently effortless precision — the
"catatonic, shoofly humor" of
"Repo Man," the "neo-Andy Har
dyism" of "Footloose," the imagery
of "The Killing Fields" that
"suggests a documentary made by
a macabre lyric poet." And amid so
much mediocrity and so much out
right garbage, she salvages the
gems that other critics have passed
by, such as "Under Fire," "Moscow
on the Hudson," "Iceman," "The
4th Man," "Dreamscape," "Utu,"
"Comfort and Joy," "Choose Me,"
"Mrs. Soffel" and"The Makioka"
Sisters."
Even her praise, which her
detractors have called immoderate
and disproportionate to the merits
of certain films and directors, is in
truth balanced and measured. In a
long rave review of Barbra
Streisand's "Yentl,' for example,
she isolates the film's shortcomings
— its tendency toward a gloopy sis
terhood feeling in less inspired mo
ments, and the finale, which
"violates the whole musical scheme
of the movie. It also has Streisand
wearing immigrant chic and playing
the Streisand image." The empha
sis in this piece, however, is on the

virtues of a wonderful musical too
few people have seen and appreci
ated. As always, Kael is a priceless
divining rod.
It's difficult to choose a favorite
review in "State of the Art," but I
do have a favorite kind of review:
No one in the short history of movie
criticism has written so beautifully
and with such extraordinary ac
curacy about acting. Here is Kael
on Steve Martin in"The Man with
Two Brains":
"The Steve Martin we see is a
marionette, like the Devo punks;
what holds the strings is the pop
culture he has processed. But he's
not protesting the overload of his
nervous system. His core is burned
out, and he's a happy idiot, all
spasms and twitches, and videotape
for nerve endings."

And, rapturously, on James
Mason and John Gielgud in"The
Shooting Party":
"Mason and Gielgud are like soft
shoe artists; they bring suavity to
their teamwork, with Mason match
ing his melancholy warble to Giel
gud's melodious whine ... the two
can tease each other from inside
the characters they're playing.
They're so amused they're almost
laughing — they're in actors'
heaven."
In a parched movie epoch like
ours, Pauline Kael's criticism is not
merely a supplement to the filmgo
ing experience but a component of
it. We read her as theatergoers
must once have read Hazlitt or
Shaw, or as lovers of literature still
read Bradley or F.R.Leavis or lan
Watt. In her field, Kael is the state
of the art.

"The State of the Art"
By Pauline Kael
Dutton, 1985
Pauline Kael chose the title of
her latest collection of reviews,
"State of the Art," because she
hoped that this "ominous and
sweeping and just slightly clinical"
phrase would best express her atti
tude toward moviemaking in the
1980s, when the technological so
phistication of films has far outdis
tanced their sensibility. And
indeed, the only unsatisfying ele
ment this book, which compiles her
New Yorker pieces from June 1983
to July 1985 — all that prevents it
from being as exciting to read as
her best anthologies, "Deeper into
Movies" and "Reeling" — is the dis
piriting state of the art itself.
Looking at the morass of movies
Kael wades through here —
"Flashdance," "Trading Places."
"Staying Alive," "Risky Business,"
"The Moon in the Gutter," "Star
80," "Terms of Endearment" and
"Scarface" are all in the first quar
ter of the book — you wonder how

it is that her enthusiasm for the
medium itself remains undaunted,
how her prose style never loses its
sharp edge and dead-on aim. On
page after page she transforms the
latest sow's ears miraculously into
silk purses. "He appears to believe
that by giving us this gimcrackery
he's turning pop art into high art.
All he actually does in this movie is
take the pleasure out of pop," she
writes of Hugh Hudson and
"Greystoke." Francis Coppola, she
says in her review of "The Cotton
Club," "seems to have skimmed
the top off every '20s-'3os picture
he has seen, added seltzer, stirred
it up with a swizzlestick, and called
it a movie." And in her witty analy
sis, a turkey like the De Niro-
Streep "Falling in Love," which
asks the question, "Can a vacuum
love another vacuum?" becomes an
example of what is wrong with
(especially American) movies
today: "Peter Suschitzsky's
cinematography has a vibrancy that
makes you feel hopeful, and Michael
Kahn's editing has an elating preci
sion, but after a while the pleasures
of technical proficiency shrivel."
By now it is a platitude that
Pauline Kael has written the most
consistently fresh, provocative and
multi-leveled film criticism of the
past two decades. She began
writing for The New Yorker in the
late '60s, when American

filmmakers in particular had grown
looser and more experimental for
the first time since World War 11.
