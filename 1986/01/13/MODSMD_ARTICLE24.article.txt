"Hoppers Places"
By Gail Levin
Alfred A Knopf, 1985
Painters and photographers, and
those who like to think about paint
ing and photography, have
variously interpreted the relation
ship between the two media. The
are some who still insist that paint
ing and photography are largely un
connected — a rather brave thing
to insist in this day of multi-media
work. Most recognize the relation
ship between the two, either insist
ing that photography has destroyed
the need for pictorial (realistic)
painting, or that photography has
enhanced the art of the pictorial
painter by giving him an invaluable
tool.
Art historian Gail Levin has
combined painting and photography
in a interesting, novel way; in her
book "Hopper's Places" she uses
photographs of the sites of Edward
Hopper watercolors to discuss the
painter's vision. Levin is an art his
torian and photographer who has al
ways been particularly interested in
Hopper; until recently she was the
curator of the Hopper collection at
the Whitney Museum of American
Art. This is her fifth Hopper book.
As I flipped through the 150 or so

beautiful pages of Hopper's
pictures, my first question was,
why bother? Not that I ever
thought the book was a futile effort
— it does do what it sets out to do,
and quite well — but I wasn't ini
tially convinced that spending a lot
of time hunting down an artist's
worksites and photographing them
was at all a good thing. Something
that has filtered down to me in the
name of "modern" art education is
that what we are given by the artist
is essentially what we should

mentary and clinical. . .

regard as his work; I feel it's more
important to, for example, look
really hard at a Jasper Johns flag
painting than to investigate what
newspaper lies underneath all that
oil paint and gesso.
But the more I looked at Levin's
book, the more I was convinced she
had managed to use photography
effectively to help readers interpret
Hopper's work. I say she helps to
interpret, rather than does the in
terpreting herself; I think the best

thing about this book is that it
places together painting and pho
tography in a way that allows us to
draw conclusions ourselves. The
book is at its best when it's docu
mentary and clinical, giving us a cat
alog of information about Hopper's
lifestyle, his work habits and his
method.
In an introduction to the book,
Levin explains that the idea to pho
tograph Hopper's work sites
originated while she was studying
art history in Paris. "One spring

vacation," she tells us, "I had taken
an overnight train south to Aix-en-
Provence to meet a friend. This
was my first visit to the south of
France, and although I was quite
familiar with the great paintings that
had been produced there, I did not
expect the actual landscape to so
closely resemble those icons of
modern art. Rather, I had imagined
that artists such as Van Gogh and
Cezanne had created their images
more from their imaginations."

Levin says that she became fasci
nated by "how these artists had
responded to the world around
them and captured it on their
canvases."
Levin implies that photographs of
Hopper's sites are more valuable to
Hopper students than photographs
of France would be to students of
impressionism. Hopper is a realist,
and because of this it's important to
know "just how faithful to his obser
vation he was." According to Levin,
"One accurate way to assess the
accuracy of his work is to compare
paintings with their actual subjects
— where the subjects survive."
This is what led Levin to a search
for the "surviving" Hopper sites, a
search that led her through the
back roads and to the local in
habitants of New England towns.
After a long tour that was both
rewarding and frustrating, she
coupled about two dozen of Hop
per's watercolors with actual site
photographs.
Looking at the paint
ing/photographs, I was struck by
the proof that they offered for the in
validity of the argument that pho
tography has destroyed the need
for realist painting. Levin, though
an accomplished photographer,
cannot seem to make her
photographs of the Hopper sites
very aesthetically interesting.
(Admittedly she might not be trying

to.) The paintings, on the other
hand, are vintage Hopper;
melancholy, isolated, dignified.
Levin states the obvious when she
says, "Hoppers realism is not
merely a literal or photographic
copying of what he saw but an in
terpretive rendering of each setting

he depicted. Seeing the settings —
and Hoppers interpretations — did,
finally, help me understand more
about Hopper's paintings.
"Hopper's Pictures" isn't, as I had
feared, a "Cliffs Notes" approach
to the artist, but a valuable study
tool.

tography in a way that allows us to
draw conclusions ourselves. The
book is at its best when it's docu
mentary and clinical, giving us a cat
alog of information about Hopper's
lifestyle, his work habits and his
method.
In an introduction to the book,
Levin explains that the idea to pho
tograph Hopper's work sites
originated while she was studying
art history in Paris. "One spring

vacation," she tells us, "I had taken
an overnight train south to Aix-en-
Provence to meet a friend. This
was my first visit to the south of
France, and although I was quite
familiar with the great paintings that
had been produced there, I did not
expect the actual landscape to so
closely resemble those icons of
modern art. Rather, I had imagined
that artists such as Van Gogh and
Cezanne had created their images
more from their imaginations."

Levin says that she became fasci
nated by "how these artists had
responded to the world around
them and captured it on their
canvases."
Levin implies that photographs of
Hopper's sites are more valuable to
Hopper students than photographs
of France would be to students of
impressionism. Hopper is a realist,
and because of this it's important to
know "just how faithful to his obser
vation he was." According to Levin,
"One accurate way to assess the
accuracy of his work is to compare
paintings with their actual subjects
— where the subjects survive."
This is what led Levin to a search
for the "surviving" Hopper sites, a
search that led her through the
back roads and to the local in
habitants of New England towns.
After a long tour that was both
rewarding and frustrating, she
coupled about two dozen of Hop
per's watercolors with actual site
photographs.
Looking at the paint
ing/photographs, I was struck by
the proof that they offered for the in
validity of the argument that pho
tography has destroyed the need
for realist painting. Levin, though
an accomplished photographer,
cannot seem to make her
photographs of the Hopper sites
very aesthetically interesting.
(Admittedly she might not be trying

to.) The paintings, on the other
hand, are vintage Hopper;
melancholy, isolated, dignified.
Levin states the obvious when she
says, "Hoppers realism is not
merely a literal or photographic
copying of what he saw but an in
terpretive rendering of each setting

he depicted. Seeing the settings —
and Hoppers interpretations — did,
finally, help me understand more
about Hopper's paintings.
"Hopper's Pictures" isn't, as I had
feared, a "Cliffs Notes" approach
to the artist, but a valuable study
tool.

"Hoppers Places"
By Gail Levin
Alfred A Knopf, 1985
Painters and photographers, and
those who like to think about paint
ing and photography, have
variously interpreted the relation
ship between the two media. The
are some who still insist that paint
ing and photography are largely un
connected — a rather brave thing
to insist in this day of multi-media
work. Most recognize the relation
ship between the two, either insist
ing that photography has destroyed
the need for pictorial (realistic)
painting, or that photography has
enhanced the art of the pictorial
painter by giving him an invaluable
tool.
Art historian Gail Levin has
combined painting and photography
in a interesting, novel way; in her
book "Hopper's Places" she uses
photographs of the sites of Edward
Hopper watercolors to discuss the
painter's vision. Levin is an art his
torian and photographer who has al
ways been particularly interested in
Hopper; until recently she was the
curator of the Hopper collection at
the Whitney Museum of American
Art. This is her fifth Hopper book.
As I flipped through the 150 or so

beautiful pages of Hopper's
pictures, my first question was,
why bother? Not that I ever
thought the book was a futile effort
— it does do what it sets out to do,
and quite well — but I wasn't ini
tially convinced that spending a lot
of time hunting down an artist's
worksites and photographing them
was at all a good thing. Something
that has filtered down to me in the
name of "modern" art education is
that what we are given by the artist
is essentially what we should

regard as his work; I feel it's more
important to, for example, look
really hard at a Jasper Johns flag
painting than to investigate what
newspaper lies underneath all that
oil paint and gesso.
But the more I looked at Levin's
book, the more I was convinced she
had managed to use photography
effectively to help readers interpret
Hopper's work. I say she helps to
interpret, rather than does the in
terpreting herself; I think the best

thing about this book is that it
places together painting and pho
tography in a way that allows us to
draw conclusions ourselves. The
book is at its best when it's docu
mentary and clinical, giving us a cat
