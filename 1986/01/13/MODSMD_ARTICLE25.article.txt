## Cagers Rebound for Win at Tempe Even Pac-10 Mark at 2-2; Will Host Oregon Tonight 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
TEMPE, Ariz. — Give the Stan
ford men's basketball team credit
for solving its problems quickly.
In a loss Thursday at Arizona,
the Cardinal was dominated inside
by the Wildcats. Saturday, the
Cardinal controlled the boards, con
trolled the paint and walked out of
here with a 66-59 victory over
Arizona State before a gathering of
4,561 in the vacuous University Ac
tivity Center.
The win left Stanford at 2-2 in the
Pacific 10 Conference, tied with
California and UCLA for fourth
place. Arizona State is alone in
seventh at 1-2. Stanford is 8-8
overall, while ASU fell to 7-6.
A look at the shot chart showed
only three Stanford baskets from
outside the lane — one by Andy
Fischer to end the first half and a
pair by Todd Lichti in the second
half. In fact, the Cardinal shot only
36 percent for the whole game.
But that doesn't matter when
you own the rebounds and get 28
points from the foul line. There
were 29 fouls called on the Sun
Devils, and Stanford hit 28 of 39
from the line to provide the margin
of victory. Earl Koberlein led the
foul shooting show, hitting 13 of 16
en route to 19 points to pace the
Cardinal.

And the boards were Cardinal
territory. Stanford outrebounded
Arizona State by a 43-27 margin.
The Sun Devils had only two
missed shots carom off to a player
in white all night. Howard Wright,
recovered from a sprained ankle
that kept him out of the second half
of Thursday's game, grabbed 13 for
Stanford. Koberlein picked off six at
the offensive end.

"I was worried about us being
overwhelmed ourselves," Stanford
Coach Tom Davis said. "Howard
Wright and Earl Koberlein were the
dominant factors. In fact, if any guy
has been consistent all season long
for us, it's Earl Koberlein."

with his team's performance. The

Stanford got help from old as well as young blood in Saturday's
win at ASU. Earl Koberlein, a senior shown above, led the Card
inal's attack with 19 points while freshman Howard Wright led
all rebounders with 13.

only 3,718 so far this season at
home — but Saturday night they
had problems with player interest.
It looked like a psychology experi
ment: Imagine yourself somewhere
else — anywhere but here.
"We were spectators when the
shot went up," Patterson said.
"When a team shoots 35 percent,
you've got to beat them. They shot
20 more free throws than us. Our
performance inside was just really
bad."
Prime example of how to define
the term "mental error": With Stan
ford leading 61-57, 1:23 left in the

game, and Arizona State with pos
session after a held ball, Sun Devil
forward Alex Austin tossed an un
contested inbound pass over the
head of Arthur Thomas and into the
scorer's table.
Keith Ramee was fouled on the
Stanford inbound, hit the front end
of the one-and-one, and followed a
Sun Devil basketball by Eric Hol
loway by hitting both ends of the
next one-and-one to give Stanford a
64-59 lead with 58 seconds to go.
Example No. 2: ASU forward
Chris Sandle, who finished with 21
points, missed two shots inside of
two feet on the next possession as
the Sun Devils last gasp expired.
Terry Taylor and Ramee both hit
free throws to round out the

scoring.
Stanford trailed 34-30 at
halftime, largely thanks to a 31 per
cent shooting effort, including mis
sing its first 11 outside shots. "I felt
lucky to go in within four," Davis
said. "We made too many offensive
mistakes."
Trailing 40-33 with 18 minutes
left in the second half, Stanford out
scored Arizona State 17-2 over the
next eight minutes to take a 50-42
lead and control of the ballgame.
Arizona State closed the lead to
three on three occasions, but could
come no closer.
ASU guard Steve Beck, in a
slump all season, led the first half
effort for the Sun Devils with 16
points. Beck finished with a season
high 22.
"They made an adjustment and
were more conscious of him," Pat
terson said. "When he got the ball,
they shadowed him. They took
away the passing lanes and let him
get the ball out of scoring range.
Also, I think we weren't looking for
him. We need more patience on of
fense, we need to find guys who are
shooting."
With Novian Whitsitt back at the
hotel with muscle spasms in his up
per back and Eric Reveno playing
erratically this season, Davis' usual
10-man substitution pattern was
down to eight. When Greg Butler
fouled out with nine minutes
remaining, Davis was down to
seven players that he used.
Davis didn't seem disturbed by
the number situation, though. "I
think in the early season, you play
more guys," he said.

inal's attack with 19 points while freshman Howard Wright led
all rebounders with 13.

only 3,718 so far this season at
home — but Saturday night they
had problems with player interest.
It looked like a psychology experi
ment: Imagine yourself somewhere
else — anywhere but here.
"We were spectators when the
shot went up," Patterson said.
"When a team shoots 35 percent,
you've got to beat them. They shot
20 more free throws than us. Our
performance inside was just really
bad."
Prime example of how to define
the term "mental error": With Stan
ford leading 61-57, 1:23 left in the

game, and Arizona State with pos
session after a held ball, Sun Devil
forward Alex Austin tossed an un
contested inbound pass over the
head of Arthur Thomas and into the
scorer's table.
Keith Ramee was fouled on the
Stanford inbound, hit the front end
of the one-and-one, and followed a
Sun Devil basketball by Eric Hol
loway by hitting both ends of the
next one-and-one to give Stanford a
64-59 lead with 58 seconds to go.
Example No. 2: ASU forward
Chris Sandle, who finished with 21
points, missed two shots inside of
two feet on the next possession as
the Sun Devils last gasp expired.
Terry Taylor and Ramee both hit
free throws to round out the

scoring.
Stanford trailed 34-30 at
halftime, largely thanks to a 31 per
cent shooting effort, including mis
sing its first 11 outside shots. "I felt
lucky to go in within four," Davis
said. "We made too many offensive
mistakes."
Trailing 40-33 with 18 minutes
left in the second half, Stanford out
scored Arizona State 17-2 over the
next eight minutes to take a 50-42
lead and control of the ballgame.
Arizona State closed the lead to
three on three occasions, but could
come no closer.
ASU guard Steve Beck, in a
slump all season, led the first half
effort for the Sun Devils with 16
points. Beck finished with a season
high 22.
"They made an adjustment and
were more conscious of him," Pat
terson said. "When he got the ball,
they shadowed him. They took
away the passing lanes and let him
get the ball out of scoring range.
Also, I think we weren't looking for
him. We need more patience on of
fense, we need to find guys who are
shooting."
With Novian Whitsitt back at the
hotel with muscle spasms in his up
per back and Eric Reveno playing
erratically this season, Davis' usual
10-man substitution pattern was
down to eight. When Greg Butler
fouled out with nine minutes
remaining, Davis was down to
seven players that he used.
Davis didn't seem disturbed by
the number situation, though. "I
think in the early season, you play
more guys," he said.

In a loss Thursday at Arizona,
the Cardinal was dominated inside
by the Wildcats. Saturday, the
Cardinal controlled the boards, con
trolled the paint and walked out of
here with a 66-59 victory over
Arizona State before a gathering of
4,561 in the vacuous University Ac
tivity Center.
The win left Stanford at 2-2 in the
Pacific 10 Conference, tied with
California and UCLA for fourth
place. Arizona State is alone in
seventh at 1-2. Stanford is 8-8
overall, while ASU fell to 7-6.
A look at the shot chart showed
only three Stanford baskets from
outside the lane — one by Andy
Fischer to end the first half and a
pair by Todd Lichti in the second
half. In fact, the Cardinal shot only
36 percent for the whole game.
But that doesn't matter when
you own the rebounds and get 28
points from the foul line. There
were 29 fouls called on the Sun
Devils, and Stanford hit 28 of 39
from the line to provide the margin
of victory. Earl Koberlein led the
foul shooting show, hitting 13 of 16
en route to 19 points to pace the
Cardinal.

And the boards were Cardinal
territory. Stanford outrebounded
Arizona State by a 43-27 margin.
The Sun Devils had only two
missed shots carom off to a player
in white all night. Howard Wright,
recovered from a sprained ankle
that kept him out of the second half
of Thursday's game, grabbed 13 for
Stanford. Koberlein picked off six at
the offensive end.

Stanford
Koberlein 3-10, 13-16, 19, Lichti 6-12, 3-4, 15,
Wright 4-14. 2-2, 10, Rainee 0-3, 7-11, 7, Paye 3

Thompson 1-7, 2-2, 4, Isiah 1-1, 0-2, 2. Totals:
23-46, 13-19, 59.

"I was worried about us being
overwhelmed ourselves," Stanford
Coach Tom Davis said. "Howard
Wright and Earl Koberlein were the
dominant factors. In fact, if any guy
has been consistent all season long
for us, it's Earl Koberlein."
Arizona State Coach Steve Pat
terson was not particularly happy
with his team's performance. The
Sun Devils have had problems with
fan interest — they're averaging
