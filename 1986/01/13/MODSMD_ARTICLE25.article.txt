## Cagers Rebound for Win at Tempe Even Pac-10 Mark at 2-2; Will Host Oregon Tonight 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
TEMPE, Ariz. — Give the Stan
ford men's basketball team credit
for solving its problems quickly.
In a loss Thursday at Arizona,
the Cardinal was dominated inside
by the Wildcats. Saturday, the
Cardinal controlled the boards, con
trolled the paint and walked out of
here with a 66-59 victory over
Arizona State before a gathering of
4,561 in the vacuous University Ac
tivity Center.
The win left Stanford at 2-2 in the
Pacific 10 Conference, tied with
California and UCLA for fourth
place. Arizona State is alone in
seventh at 1-2. Stanford is 8-8
overall, while ASU fell to 7-6.
A look at the shot chart showed
only three Stanford baskets from
outside the lane — one by Andy
Fischer to end the first half and a
pair by Todd Lichti in the second
half. In fact, the Cardinal shot only
36 percent for the whole game.
But that doesn't matter when
you own the rebounds and get 28
points from the foul line. There
were 29 fouls called on the Sun
Devils, and Stanford hit 28 of 39
from the line to provide the margin
of victory. Earl Koberlein led the
foul shooting show, hitting 13 of 16
en route to 19 points to pace the
Cardinal.

And the boards were Cardinal
territory. Stanford outrebounded
Arizona State by a 43-27 margin.
The Sun Devils had only two
missed shots carom off to a player
in white all night. Howard Wright,
recovered from a sprained ankle
that kept him out of the second half
of Thursday's game, grabbed 13 for
Stanford. Koberlein picked off six at
the offensive end.

Koberlein 3-10, 13-16, 19, Lichti 6-12, 3-4, 15,

"I was worried about us being
overwhelmed ourselves," Stanford
Coach Tom Davis said. "Howard
Wright and Earl Koberlein were the
dominant factors. In fact, if any guy
has been consistent all season long
for us, it's Earl Koberlein."
Arizona State Coach Steve Pat
terson was not particularly happy
with his team's performance. The
Sun Devils have had problems with
fan interest — they're averaging

play for a West team that fell to the East 18-7.
