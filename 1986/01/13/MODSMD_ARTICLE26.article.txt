New England's 255 Yards Rushing
Squish Miami's Championship Hopes

MIAMI (AP) — The New
England Patriots turned their
"team of destiny" label into
reality yesterday, getting 24
points from four fumble
recoveries and three short

Orange Bowl and was the first
defeat in AFC title games for the
Dolphins, who were hoping to
qualify for a record sixth Super
Bowl appearance.
In beating Miami in the Orange
Bowl for the first time since
1966, the Patriots became the
first team ever to qualify for the
Super Bowl by winning three
playoff games on the road. They
will be the third wild-card team
— Oakland in the 1980 season
and Dallas in 1975 were the
others — to qualify for the Na
tional Football League's title
game.
In ensuring that Miami would
not make a return trip to the
Super Bowl, the Patriots contin
ued the opportunistic play that
had produced three touchdowns
on fumble returns in their last

touchdown passes from Tony
Eason to qualify for the Super
Bowl by beating the Miami Dol
phins 31-14 in the American
Football Conference champion
ship game.
The victory ended an 18-game
New England losing streak in the

four games. True to predictions by both coaches that
the team that got more turnovers would win, the
Patriots recovered Miami fumbles on the first play of
each half to set up 10 points. They picked up another
fumble in the second quarter to set up another score
and clinched the game on a 45-yard drive following a
fourth fumble.
They also got a key interception by Fred Marion to
end a third-quarter drive that could have put the Dol
phins back in the game. Raymond Clayborn also picked
off a pass in the final period.
New England led 17-7 at halftime, then got a quick
touchdown after Greg Hawthorne recovered Lorenzo
Hampton's fumble on the first play of the second half.
The Patriots took advantage of the same weakness
that the Cleveland Browns exploited last week in their
near-upset of the Dolphins — Miami's inability to stop
the running game.
The Pats ran for 255 yards as James, Tony Collins
and Robert Weathers kept ripping off large chunks of
yardage right up the middle of the Miami defense.
James wound up with 105 yards on 22 carries.

That made Eason's job easier. His three scoring
passes covered a total of seven yards — four to Col
lins, two to Weathers and one to Derrick Ramsey. The
passes to Ramsey and Collins were on obvious running
situations.
New England passed only three times in the second
half. Eason finished with 10 completions in just 12 at
tempts for 71 yards. By contrast, Miami's Dan Marino
threw 48 times, completing 20 for 248 yards.
Miami blew three scoring opportunities in losing at
home for the first time in 10 games this season. One
came when Dan Johnson dropped a Marino pass in the
end zone that could have cut the deficit to 17-14 at
halftime. The other two came on interceptions by
Marion and Clayborn.
They lost another when Julius Adams recovered a
Joe Carter fumble after the Dolphins had closed to 24-
14 early in the fourth quarter. That led to the final
score of the game, a one-yard run by Mosi Tatupu after
a drive on the ground that consumed five minutes.
The victory was the 12th in the last 14 games for the
Patriots, who-began the season with three losses in
their first five games, including a 20-7 defeat in Chicago
in the second week. The only losses since the fifth
week were a 16-13 overtime defeat to the Jets in New
VnrV and a 30-27 loss to the' Dolphins,
