CHICAGO (AP) — Defiant
Jim McMahon ran and passed for
a pair of touchdowns and the
Chicago defense pounded out an
NFL-record second straight
playoff shutout yesterday as the
Bears thundered into their first
Super Bowl with a 24-0 victory
over the Los Angeles Hams.
The Bears, the National Foot

season at 15-1, will face New
England, a 31-14 winner over
Miami in the AFC championship
game, at New Orleans Jan. 26.
The victory over the Rams in
the National Conference champi
onship game came one week
after the Bears had throttled the
New York Giants 21-0 — and
one year after their ignominious
23-0 loss to San Francisco in the
NFC title game.
Never before had a team re

corded consecutive playoff
shutouts en route to the Super
Bowl. Now the Bears can shoot
for three in a row and another
record. No Super Bowl has
ended in a shutout.
"If our defense plays like that
in the Super Bowl, we won't
lose," said McMahon.
"We did it this year, all year,
as a team, and we played hard."
Coach Mike Ditka said. "I give
the Rams all the credit in the
world. . . we had our work cut
out. we made some breaks early
and they held up."
With Sunday's victory, started
in a near-balmy (for Chicago) 39
degrees and concluded in unex
pected snow, the Bears earned
the inaugural George Halas
Trophy, a fitting tribute to the
