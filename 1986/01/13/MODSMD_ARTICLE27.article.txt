# Chicago Shuts Down Dickerson For Defense's 2nd Playoff Shutout
## 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) — Defiant
Jim McMahon ran and passed for
a pair of touchdowns and the
Chicago defense pounded out an
NFL-record second straight
playoff shutout yesterday as the
Bears thundered into their first
Super Bowl with a 24-0 victory
over the Los Angeles Hams.
The Bears, the National Foot
ball League's best team this
season at 15-1, will face New
England, a 31-14 winner over
Miami in the AFC championship
game, at New Orleans Jan. 26.
The victory over the Rams in
the National Conference champi
onship game came one week
after the Bears had throttled the
New York Giants 21-0 — and
one year after their ignominious
23-0 loss to San Francisco in the
NFC title game.
Never before had a team re

corded consecutive playoff
shutouts en route to the Super
Bowl. Now the Bears can shoot
for three in a row and another
record. No Super Bowl has
ended in a shutout.
"If our defense plays like that
in the Super Bowl, we won't
lose," said McMahon.
"We did it this year, all year,
as a team, and we played hard."
Coach Mike Ditka said. "I give
the Rams all the credit in the
world. . . we had our work cut
out. we made some breaks early
and they held up."
With Sunday's victory, started
in a near-balmy (for Chicago) 39
degrees and concluded in unex
pected snow, the Bears earned
the inaugural George Halas
Trophy, a fitting tribute to the
team Papa Bear built more than a
half-century ago.
The Bears' defense put its own
imprimatur on this game when,
with less than three minutes to
play, defensive end Richard Dent
led a charge of linemen and
linebackers that buried Rams quar
terback Dieter Brock and stripped
him of the ball. Linebacker Wilber
Marshall picked it up and rumbled
52 yards into the end zone, break
ing an Eric Dickerson tackle along
the way for the final, emphatic
touchdown.
McMahon, the cult-figure quar
terback with the punk-rock hairdo
and wraparound sunglasses, added
to his ensemble a headband with
"ROZELLE" hand-lettered across
the front, his response to a fine
levied against him by NFL Commis
sioner Pete Rozelle for having worn
a headband last week with a

prominent brand name visible.
The first time the Bears got the
ball, McMahon blasted them 56
yards across the Soldier Field turf
in just five plays, taking barely
three minutes. He started with
passes of 20 yards to tight end
Emery Moorehead and 19 to wide
receiver Willie Gault and finished
with his own 16-yard touchdown
sprint 5:25 into the game.
On the Bears' second possession
of the second half, and already
owning a 10-0 lead built on Kevin
Butler's 34-yard field goal,
McMahon fashioned an eight-play,
52-yard march. It was climaxed by
his 22-yard pass to the wide-open
Gault in the left corner of the end
zone with 8:04 gone in the third
period.
Along the way, on a fourth-and-6
at the Rams' 35-yard line, McMahon
passed 13 yards to Walter Payton
for a first down.
As a runner, Payton wasn't much
of a factor in the game. The NFL's
all-time leading rusher gained just

32 yards on 18 carries. But he
caught seven passes for 48 yards.
"These guys believe in them
selves," said Payton. "They rallied
around all year, everybody dedi
cated themselves to go further than
the championship game. . . There
was no way we would be denied
after the San Francisco game last
year (for the conference title)."
Dickerson, who trampled Dallas
with an NFL playoff-record 248
yards eight days ago, likewise was
held in check, gaining 46 yards on
17 carries, catching three passes
for a meaningless 10 yards and fum
bling twice, losing one of them.
The much-maligned Brock was
even less of a factor. The Bears
were in his face all day, sacking him
three times, hurrying him far more
often and holding him to comple
tions on 10 of 31 passes for 66
yards. McMahon, despite similar
pressure and three sacks, com
pleted 16 of 25 passes for 164
yards.

Dickerson, who trampled Dallas
with an NFL playoff-record 248
yards eight days ago, likewise was
held in check, gaining 46 yards on
17 carries, catching three passes
for a meaningless 10 yards and fum
bling twice, losing one of them.
The much-maligned Brock was
even less of a factor. The Bears
were in his face all day, sacking him
three times, hurrying him far more
often and holding him to comple
tions on 10 of 31 passes for 66
yards. McMahon, despite similar
pressure and three sacks, com

yards.
CHICAGO (AP) — Defiant
Jim McMahon ran and passed for
a pair of touchdowns and the
Chicago defense pounded out an
NFL-record second straight
playoff shutout yesterday as the
Bears thundered into their first
Super Bowl with a 24-0 victory
over the Los Angeles Hams.
The Bears, the National Foot
ball League's best team this
season at 15-1, will face New
England, a 31-14 winner over
Miami in the AFC championship
game, at New Orleans Jan. 26.
The victory over the Rams in
the National Conference champi
onship game came one week
after the Bears had throttled the
New York Giants 21-0 — and
one year after their ignominious
23-0 loss to San Francisco in the
NFC title game.
Never before had a team re

corded consecutive playoff
shutouts en route to the Super
Bowl. Now the Bears can shoot
for three in a row and another
record. No Super Bowl has
ended in a shutout.
"If our defense plays like that
in the Super Bowl, we won't
lose," said McMahon.
"We did it this year, all year,
as a team, and we played hard."
Coach Mike Ditka said. "I give
the Rams all the credit in the
world. . . we had our work cut
out. we made some breaks early
and they held up."
With Sunday's victory, started
in a near-balmy (for Chicago) 39
degrees and concluded in unex
pected snow, the Bears earned
the inaugural George Halas
Trophy, a fitting tribute to the
team Papa Bear built more than a
half-century ago.
The Bears' defense put its own
imprimatur on this game when,
with less than three minutes to
play, defensive end Richard Dent
led a charge of linemen and
linebackers that buried Rams quar
terback Dieter Brock and stripped
him of the ball. Linebacker Wilber
Marshall picked it up and rumbled
52 yards into the end zone, break
ing an Eric Dickerson tackle along
the way for the final, emphatic
touchdown.
McMahon, the cult-figure quar
terback with the punk-rock hairdo
and wraparound sunglasses, added
to his ensemble a headband with
"ROZELLE" hand-lettered across
the front, his response to a fine
levied against him by NFL Commis
sioner Pete Rozelle for having worn
a headband last week with a

prominent brand name visible.
The first time the Bears got the
ball, McMahon blasted them 56
yards across the Soldier Field turf
in just five plays, taking barely
three minutes. He started with
passes of 20 yards to tight end
Emery Moorehead and 19 to wide
receiver Willie Gault and finished
with his own 16-yard touchdown
sprint 5:25 into the game.
On the Bears' second possession
of the second half, and already
owning a 10-0 lead built on Kevin
Butler's 34-yard field goal,
McMahon fashioned an eight-play,
52-yard march. It was climaxed by
his 22-yard pass to the wide-open
Gault in the left corner of the end
zone with 8:04 gone in the third
period.
Along the way, on a fourth-and-6
at the Rams' 35-yard line, McMahon
passed 13 yards to Walter Payton
for a first down.
As a runner, Payton wasn't much
of a factor in the game. The NFL's
all-time leading rusher gained just

32 yards on 18 carries. But he
caught seven passes for 48 yards.
"These guys believe in them
selves," said Payton. "They rallied
around all year, everybody dedi
cated themselves to go further than
the championship game. . . There
was no way we would be denied
after the San Francisco game last
year (for the conference title)."
Dickerson, who trampled Dallas
with an NFL playoff-record 248
yards eight days ago, likewise was
held in check, gaining 46 yards on
17 carries, catching three passes
for a meaningless 10 yards and fum
bling twice, losing one of them.
The much-maligned Brock was
even less of a factor. The Bears
were in his face all day, sacking him
three times, hurrying him far more
often and holding him to comple
tions on 10 of 31 passes for 66
yards. McMahon, despite similar
pressure and three sacks, com
pleted 16 of 25 passes for 164
yards.
