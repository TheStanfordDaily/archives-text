## Barns Shows Scouts Stuff 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
The Cincinnati Bengals' scout
nudged the man next to him, a
Stanford fan who has just asked his
opinion of Cardinal offensive tackle
John Barns. I he scout pointed
down to the Stanford Stadium field,
where Barns was working on Ala
bama s big Jon Hand in the second
half of the East-West Shrine Game
on Saturday.
"See that?" he asked. The play
was a strong-side screen, and
Barns was holding the 6-foot-7,
275-pound Hand at arms' length and
pushing him away from the play.
'He's moving him backward." The
fan nodded expectantly and sat for
ward. The scout sat back. "He's a
player, a strong plaver." the

scout said.
"So what round do you think he'll
go in?" the fan asked after a few
seconds of silence.
Ihe scout looked down at the
table in front of him, at the sheets
of paper covered with scribbled


John Barns
'A good player."
