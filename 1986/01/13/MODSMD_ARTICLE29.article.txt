# Stanford Hosts Its 61st Shrine
## Barns Shows Scouts Stuff 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
The Cincinnati Bengals' scout
nudged the man next to him, a
Stanford fan who has just asked his
opinion of Cardinal offensive tackle
John Barns. I he scout pointed
down to the Stanford Stadium field,
where Barns was working on Ala
bama s big Jon Hand in the second
half of the East-West Shrine Game
on Saturday.
"See that?" he asked. The play
was a strong-side screen, and
Barns was holding the 6-foot-7,
275-pound Hand at arms' length and
pushing him away from the play.
'He's moving him backward." The
fan nodded expectantly and sat for
ward. The scout sat back. "He's a
player, a strong plaver." the

scout said.
"So what round do you think he'll
go in?" the fan asked after a few
seconds of silence.
Ihe scout looked down at the
table in front of him, at the sheets
of paper covered with scribbled


John Barns
'A good player."
notes, and smiled to himself.
"That's what the Cincinnati Bengals
pay me to tell them. And they pay
me a lot of money, too. I can't really
tell you that."
Then, as if in consolation, he
leaned toward the fan and said, "I
watched him all week in practice.
He looks good."
That should make Barns, the 6-
7, 285-pound Texan who has held
down the right side of the Stanford
offensive line for the last three
years, feel even better about his ef
fort on Saturday. Barns, the only
Cardinal who played in the Shrine
game this year, got the game's
toughest assignment — containing
Hand, the game's defensive MVP
and a sure first-round NFL pick.
The two faced each other for a little
over two quarters, and while Hand
got by Barns several times, Barns
did well enough to earn more than

one scout's approval.
"I thought I held my own," Barns
said. "I kept him out of there for
most of the time I was on him. He's
a real good player, he's got a vari
ety of moves, but the better
players you get to play against, the
better you get."
And, needless to say, the more
attention you get from scouts.
"It'll be good for me, when they
get around to looking at films,"
Bams said. "They're all going to be
looking at him, so naturally they'll
have to see me."
Hand came away from the con
frontation with a favorable impres
sion of Barns.
"He's a good pass blocker," he
said. "They (the West) didn't rush
that much, at least not while I was
in there, so I don't know much
about that. In the second half, he
turned off my outside moves and
moved me inside, doubled on me
with the guard." He waved his
hand. "Hey, everyone out here is
good."

Barns, an All-Pacific 10 Confer
ence selection in 1985, is unques
tionably good enough to be drafted,
and he has as good a shot as anyone
to make it past the final cut. The
only other Stanford senior getting a
similarly serious look from the pros
is tight end Greg Baty, who im
proved his stock with his perfor
mances in the Blue-Gray Game and
Saturday's Japan Bowl.
Barns said he enjoyed the seven
days before the game — his last on
the turf of Stanford Stadium — as
much as the actual contest.
"The whole week was fun," he
said. "I'm really glad I had the
chance to be here. (The trip to the
San Francisco Shriner's Hospital)
was kind of special. It makes you
feel fortunate for what you have,
and it makes you glad that you're
playing for a good cause.
"And there were hundreds of
scouts out here all week," he
added. "Being here can't hurt you,
unless you play terrible."
Which he didn't.
