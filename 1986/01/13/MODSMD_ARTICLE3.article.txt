### ERIC HEALY Staff writer 
A four-day conference discussing the impact
of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome from
medical, clinical, economic and political
perspectives will be held at Stanford next week.
The conference, entitled "AIDS Challenge:
The Cost of Not Caring," is being sponsored by
the Stanford program in human biology and "is
well-balanced in covering all the aspects of the
issue," said Paul Walters, director of Student
Health Services. The conference will be held
Jan. 21-24 at Kresge Auditorium beginning at 7
p.m. each night.

Meg Richman, the coordinator of the confer
ence, said, "The major purpose of the confer
ence is to present a range of views or opinions
and, by utilizing an intelligent informed panel,
clarify the perspectives for the audience."
Walters said other programs around the
campus this fall dealt with AIDS "primarily from
the medical standpoint."
"I hope it will reach most people," Walters
said. "The first night it will be competing with
the Bishop Desmond Tutu speech; however,
after that it should be well-attended. It's some
thing that everyone should see.
"I think (the conference) is splendidly put to
gether in that it represents both sides," Walters
said. "It is one of the best conferences of its kind

that I've seen."
Each night's program will consist of discus
sions presenting a different approach to the
AIDS question.
At the first panel discussion, "An AIDS Over
view: Where the Danger Lies," University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy will introduce the partici
pants, who will include, in addition to Walters,
Peter Drotman, director of the AIDS Branch of
the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, Edgar
Edelman, director of the Stanford University
Blood Bank and Clark Taylor of meTnstlrawrtftr
the Advanced Study of Human Sexuality. The
discussion will be moderated by Craig Heller,
