# East Squad Beats West 18-7
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
All right, here's the score of the
61st annual East-West Shrine
Game, played in Stanford Stadium
on Saturday. Read it and forget it.
East 18, West 7.
From a fan's perspective, this
game, like every other college foot
ball all-star game, was no more than
the sum of its extremely talented
parts. Unless you cling to some
strange belief that the result of the
game decides once and for all which
side of the country is a better place
to live, there is no reason to spend
any time on the edge of your seat
rooting for one team or the other.
The best way to watch these
games is to sit back and enjoy the
individual performances of the

players. And if there weren't
enough of those to please some of
the 77,000 fans — an all-time
Shrine Game record — they could
take comfort in the knowledge that
their ticket money was going to
help the crippled and burned
children in Shriner's hospitals
around the country.
There were so few outstanding
offensive efforts, in fact, that the
game's biggest star was a defensive
end. Jon Hand, the 6-foot-7, 275-
pound Alabama senior whom the
scouts have been drooling over all
season long, made the fans sit up
and take notice with three deflected
passes, a blocked field goal, four
unassisted tackles and a sack. He
wound up with the Spaulding Award
as the game's outstanding defen-
sive player — the award won last year by Garin Veris
of Stanford and the Super Bowl-bound New England
Patriots — and dramatically improved his NFL stock.
After the game, however, the draft was the farthest
thing from Hand's mind.
"I never look at it like I'm improving my draft posi
tion," he said. "I just enjoy playing football with good
guys, and let me tell you, this is a great group of guys."
The offensive MVP was Louisiana State running
back Garry James, a Walter Payton lookalike who
gained 83 yards on 19 carries and scored two touch
downs. He got the East on the board early in the game
with a one-yard run, and padded the lead with a 15-
yard jaunt around right end in the second quarter.
He had received an invitation from the Hula Bowl,
but on his mother's advice, he turned it down to attend
the Shiner's charity game.
"I believe in helping people, and I wanted to be part
of something special like this," said James, the Tigers'
No. 2 running back this year. "God's been leading my
life and he led me here, and look what happened."
James' running mate on Saturday was almost as

notable for his school as he was for his rushing ability.
Charles Sanders, the pride of Slippery Rock, picked up
71 yards on 19 carries on bucks straight into the line,
and earned the respect of the scouts who hadn't made
it to the tiny state school in Pennsylvania.
Most of the other memorable performances, unfor
tunately, were the bad ones. The West's starting quar
terback, Robbie Bosco of BYU, looked nothing like the
cool-headed thrower who led his team to the national
championship in 1984 and finished third in the Heisman
voting this year. He connected on nine of 21 passes for
a miserable 72 yards, was intercepted once and gen
erally lowered his status as a projected third-round
pick. *
His substitute, Washington State's Mark Rypien,
was worse. The "R" in the Cougars' touted RPM of
fense threw four interceptions, most of them on long
floaters that looked like they were intended to impress
the scouts with his rifle ability. If that was the idea, it
didn't work.
The East didn't actually put the game away until
Brendan Toibin nailed a 23-yard field goal with 3:37
left, but the West never mounted a serious second half
threat to the East's 15-7 halftime lead.
But that's just the scoring. And on Saturday at least,
that wasn't what mattered.
