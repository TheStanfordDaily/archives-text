# Card Looks To Pummel Hapless Oregon Here
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Pete Rozelle would love the Pacific 10 Conference
basketball race. A place where parity is more than a
word, it's our way of playing basketball.
The season is only two weeks old, but already you
can see that no one is going to run away with this one.
A Stanford Sports Information Director has come up
with a new definition of upset in the Pac-10 — a loss at
home.
Stanford is currently tied for fourth place with Cali
fornia and UCLA. No typo. The perennial powerhouse
Bruins have already lost to Oregon State and Washing
ton, and had to come back from an eight-point deficit in
the second overtime to edge Washington State by one
in Pullman, Wash.
Meanwhile, the perennial doormat Bears took both
Washington schools at home before dropping a pair of

games in Arizona this weekend.
USC, the defending champion, was blasted on
regional television Saturday by Washington, in Seattle.
So road wins won't be easy to come by, and a few
may be all it takes to win this thing. "You've got to win
some on the road, and they're not easy to get," Stan
ford Coach Tom Davis said after the Cardinal picked up
its first Pac-10 win away from home at Arizona State.
"I think you'll see the home teams with more blowouts
than visiting teams have wins."
Conversely, a loss at home can be devastating.
Tonight, when Oregon visits Maples Pavilion for a 7:30
game, it could be even more so. The Ducks are the
only winless team in the Pac-10 at 0-3 and were picked
to finish last in the preseason coaches' poll.
Davis sees the inside game, the deciding factor in
Thursday's loss at Arizona and Saturday's win at
Arizona State, as the key again tonight. "In our two
wins, we outrebounded our oppo
nents decisively," he said. "In the
two we lost, we were out
rebounded by our opponents.
"Other than that, it's a pretty
close match. We both have some
returning players from last year and
some new players."
In Saturday's 63-56 loss to
upstate rival Oregon State, guard
Anthony Taylor scored 16 points to
lead the Ducks. Forward Kenny
Sprague added 13, forward Jerry
Adams had 12 and guard Rick Os
born had 10 for Oregon.
"Adams has been on and off, but
he may be the Pac-10's best
rebounder," Davis said. "He's right
up there."
Tonight's game was originally
scheduled for March 1, but was res
cheduled when USC scheduled a
nationally televised contest with
Arkansas on Jan. 25, the original
date of the USC game at Stanford.
USC will now visit on March 1, an J

the Cardinal is off on Jan. 25.
Playing three games in five days
may take its toll on Stanford, but
Davis is trying not to think about it.
"It's a factor, but we prefer not to
think about it,"he said. "When
we've got a job to do, we've got to
just go out and do it."
Going into the first conference
game with students on campus,
both Davis and Assoc. Head Coach
Bruce Pearl pointed to the over
whelming support Arizona got in
Tucson from over 10,000 fanatics in
McKale Center.
"They wouldn't let Arizona fal
ter," Davis said. "I'm not sure
Arizona's more talented than us,
but the crowd is a big variable in
Arizona's favor. We're in the
middle, we're not as good as
Arizona. They're one of the best in
the country. The more we get sup
port, the more it's going to help
us."
About 500 student season tickets
still remain for the rest of the
season, and individual game tickets
are also available.
