Even though the Stanford
wrestling team was soundly
defeated by the Cal-State
Bakersfield Roadrunners 41-8
Saturday, Coach Chris Horpel did
see some positive signs in the in
dividual matches. With the loss,
the Cardinal's dual meet record
fell to 3-5.
As the team passes the half
way point in the season, many of
the Cardinal wrestlers still have
to make a lot of improvement if
they plan to fare well at the
Pacific 10 Championships.
"We did not win the dual meet,

but we did not get completely pul
verized either. There were posi
tive aspects in each match. I
would not say that our wrestlers
were entirely dominated, but
they did not wrestle as well as
they should have," Horpel said.
"We have a lot of ground to
cover, but our three to four con
sistent wrestlers will do OK at
the Pac-10 Championship and
have a chance to qualify for
NCAA Championship. The
others, though, have a lot of
wrestling to learn."
Jeff Bradley (142 pounds)
spotted the Roadrunner's Jay
Sander four points as he was
trying out new techniques learned
in practice. Bradley then returned

to his stand-by stuff and immedi
ately took control of the match on
his way to a 10-5 victory.

techniques in competition in order

has encountered problems trying
to extend what he learns in
practice to real match conditions.
Pete Rogers (158 pounds) had
the other Stanford victory with a
3-0 win over Matt Olejnik. Rogers
wrestled his usual basic, conser
vative style which allows him to
stay close with the better
wrestlers. On the other hand,
Rogers' matches are sometimes
close against wrestlers who he
should beat easily because of his
style.
In a mild upset Dave Lee (177
pounds) tied the number three
wrestler in the nation, Darryl

Pope, 3-3. After a scoreless first
period, Lee scored an escape and
then a two-point takedown for a
3-0 lead at the end of the second
period. With a minute left in the
final period Pope scored an
escape to narrow Lee's lead to 3-
1.
Since both wrestlers were
warned for stalling Lee had to

continue to attack. Lee shot for a
takedown, but Pope got control
and scored a two-point takedown
with 15 seconds remaining in the
match. Satisfied with the tie,
Pope did not try to score any
more points and let the clock run
out.
