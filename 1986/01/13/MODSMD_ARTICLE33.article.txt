### LISA MARTINEZ Staff writer 
Stanford's fencing team roared into 1986 at Roble
Gym Saturday with a 31-12 team victory over UC-
Santa Cruz. The Cardinal men triumphed 18-9, while
the women prevailed 13-3.
Even without their top man, foilist Bryn Kanar, the
Sea Lions offered a challenge to the Cardinal with
strong teams in foil and epee. "Santa Cruz is a respec
table team," Coach Buzz Hurst said. "Overall, they are
the strongest team we have fenced so far."
The sixth-ranked Stanford women trounced Santa
Cr t uz resoundingly. "As usual, team captain Jennifer Yu
fenced extremely well," Hurst said.
"Other notable performances came from Holly
Taylor and Alison Reid. Holly fenced beautifully, as she
has done before, but I was particularly pleased with
Alison's fencing," he said. "This was her best perfor

mance of the season."
The women's team also tested new talent as fresh
man Vicki Levin fenced her first collegiate bout. "She
did excellently," Hurst said. "She acquitted herself
quite well, winning her bout for the women's team."
Overall, the coaches were pleased with the women's
performance. "Everyone did very well," Asst. Coach
Sherry Posthumus said excitedly, "they were
'fantabulous.' "
In the men's foil, the Cardinal missed the talents of
its No. 2 man, Chris Gillen, and suffered a 4-5 loss. Foil
captain Elliott Cheu gave his usual top-notch perfor
mance with the team of David Finklestein and Mark
Stout backing him up. "They did fairly well, given the
circumstances," Hurst said.
The men's epee team dumped Santa Cruz en route
to a 7-2 victory. "Epee did a very good job," Hurst
said.
Hurst said he was extremely pleased with his sabre
team, which beat the Sea Lions 7-0. '
