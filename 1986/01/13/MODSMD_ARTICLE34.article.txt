# Titans Dump Card
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
If the game against the Fullerton State
Titans this weekend proved anything, it
proved that overall records have no bearing
on final outcomes; teams that shouldn't win
don't always roll over and play dead.
The 2-9 Titans shouldn't have beaten the
9-4 Stanford women's basketball team, but
they did.
In fact, a lot happened Saturday in Fuller
ton that shouldn't have.
Despite out-shooting and out-rebounding
the Titans, the Cardinal still lost, 68-57.
Five-foot-9 senior Robin Holmes, Fuller
ton State's main offensive weapon for the
last three years, converted only two-of-15
shots from the floor, while forward Laura
Satorius, averaging a mere three points an
outing, took control of the offensive reins
and scored 16 points for the Titans.
Fullerton State scored just four points
during the opening 10 minutes of the game,
trailing by as much as eleven, but still tallied
68 points, and won by 11.
Most importantly, the Cardinal should
have been sky-high after an exciting, crucial
83-82 win over lowa State Tuesday, but
they weren't.
"We weren't ready to play," Stanford for
ward Sue Sebolt said. "They didn't present
us with any problems. I think we presented
our own problems."
Sebolt felt that a general lethargy affected
Stanford's play, offsetting the normal Card
inal offensive rhythm.
"We didn't execute well," the 5-10
junior said. "We got some shots from the
outside, but they weren't the ones we
wanted. It wasn't anything that resulted
from the natural flow of the offense."
The Cardinal didn't exactly shoot poorly,

but at slightly under 50 percent from the
field (24-for-52), it wasn't one of Stanford's
better efforts.
The Titans shot even worse, converting
barely a third of their attempts (22-of-62)
from the floor.
But, unlike the Cardinal, the Titans, ac
cording to Sebolt, succeeded in running an
inside game.
Although it didn't produce a great deal of
points, it did stick Stanford's inside person
nel, namely, center JiH Yanke and forward
Evon Asforis, in foul trouble.
"Our big people got in foul trouble early,"
Sebolt said. "So they had to sit out a lot of
the game."
Asforis, who figured quite prominently in
Stanford's win over lowa State, was slowed
by foul trouble and could only contribute a
quiet three points. Yanke, averaging 13
points in her last four outings, produced
eight for the Cardinal.
Early fouls in both stanzas, particularly
the second, allowed the Titans to reach the
bonus free-throw situation.
The Titans undoubtedly won the game
from the free-throw line where they con
verted a stirring 24-of-32 attempts. Stan
ford, on the other hand, only got 15 oppor
tunities from the line and was successful on
nine of those efforts.
Senior guard Virginia Sourlis led Stanford
with 14 points. Sophomore forward Kami
Anderson tossed in 11 points, and cen
ter/forward Kim Mercer shot well, three
for-four from the field and the free-throw
line, for a total of nine points.
Along with Satorius, Wendy Anae and 6-
4 center Amy Torczon led the
Titans (3-9), scoring 13 and 10 points,
respectively.
The Cardinal will try to rebound tonight
at 5:15 in Maples Pavilion against Utah
State.
