# Men Swimmers Use Cal's Invite To Prepare for Its League Opener
## 
### AMY FRANCETIC Staff writer 
The Stanford men's swim team,
looking to peak for its conference
opener against Arizona State Jan. 31,
completed a high-quality workout at the
Cal-Invitational in Berkeley this
weekend.
"The team takes this meet fairly
lightly," said senior Mike Reynolds, the
team's co-captain.
"It's a good measure of how our train
ing's going and we participate to
practice racing."
Although California, the school that
promised to be Stanford's top competi
tion, scratched out on two of the three
day weekend meet, Stanford still
managed to turn in some good times.
Freshman Robert Gene swam the
1,650-meter freestyle yesterday against
seven other teammates and won with a
lifetime best time of 15:47. Later, Jay
Mortenson, another freshman, raced
the 500-meter freestyle on Friday and

took more than seven seconds off of his
personal best, finishing in 4:42.6.
"This meet was good for two
purposes," Mortenson said. "It was an
excellent chance for the freshman to see
what the Berkeley pool is like, and it
was good to swim twice a day." The
swimmers swam preliminary races in
the morning and then competed in the
finals in the afternoon.
"The meet wasn't scored, since it
was basically 'Stanford vs. Stanford,'
and the guys didn't swim out of their
heads," Coach Skip Kenney said, "But it
was a rewarding weekend."
While most of the Stanford swimmers
were across the bay, the freshmen
stayed home Saturday to crush UC-
Davis in a dual meet 69-26. "It's good to
get the freshmen racing as much as pos
sible, and today they swam well," Asst.
Coach Ted Knapp said.
John Hodge "showed great racing
ability," according to Knapp, while cap
turing both the 100- and 200-meter
freestyle and anchoring the Stanford's
victorious 400-meter medley crew.

Teammate Robert Gene also dominated
both of his races — the 500- and 1000-
meter freestyle.
Stanford displayed a "pretty relaxed
attitude," Knapp said. "Our team goal
was to win every event, and we won all
but one — the 50-meter freestyle."
Freshman Jeff Garr usually swims the
50-meter freestyle for the Cardinal, but
he is not competing because while he
recovers from an operation to remove a
blood clot from his lung. He will likely
miss the rest of the season, according to
Knapp. "Stanford really misses Jeff," he
said.
UC-Davis coach Jerry Hinsdale saw
reason for optimism but also cause for
concern Saturday: "We swam both good
and bad. Like most teams now, we're
right in the middle of hard training, and
it looks like we're making progress."
Next weekend, the Cardinal swim
mers travel to Chico State for a dual
meet that should help to prepare the
team for competition with ASU in less
than three weeks.
