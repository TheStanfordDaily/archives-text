# Women Cruise to an Easy Victory

Stanford swimmers dominated the
preliminary races of the Cal Invitational
at UC-Berkeley Saturday, finishing first
in all five individual events and sweeping
first, second and third in two races.
The Cardinal did not compete in the

evening's finals because the meet lasted
longer than expected and because some
of the top swimmers from Cal, which is
still in-between semesters, were at
their homes training instead of at the
meet.
Without the competition of Mary T.
Meagher, last year's winner of the
Broderick Award as the top college
swimmer, and some of her teammates,

winning seemed to come easy for Stan
ford.
The 100-yard backstroke was all
Cardinal. Stanford swimmers fought for
the top three places, all finishing with
times under one minute. Freshmen Mi
chelle Donahue and Jenny Shannon
raced to first and second, respectively.
