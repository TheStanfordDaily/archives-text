# Women Cruise to an Easy Victory

Stanford swimmers dominated the
preliminary races of the Cal Invitational
at UC-Berkeley Saturday, finishing first
in all five individual events and sweeping
first, second and third in two races.
The Cardinal did not compete in the

evening's finals because the meet lasted
longer than expected and because some
of the top swimmers from Cal, which is
still in-between semesters, were at
their homes training instead of at the
meet.
Without the competition of Mary T.
Meagher, last year's winner of the
Broderick Award as the top college
swimmer, and some of her teammates,

winning seemed to come easy for Stan
ford.
The 100-yard backstroke was all
Cardinal. Stanford swimmers fought for
the top three places, all finishing with
times under one minute. Freshmen Mi
chelle Donahue and Jenny Shannon
raced to first and second, respectively.
Sophomore Jennifer Pokluda was third.
Before the final and fastest heat of the event, Pok
luda checked out of the competition, even though
seven of eight swimmers entered were her
teammates. "I looked down the pool and saw all these
black Stanford caps with red 'S's' on them â€” all in a
row. And I thought 'Oh, wow, this is cool.' "
In a sweep of the 400 individual medley, freshmen
Monica Neilebeck and Dana Anderson raced to first and
second places with times of 4:28.3 and 4:28.8,
respectively. Senior Kathy Smith completed the Card
inal sweep.
Freshman stand-out Jenna Johnson finished first in

both the 200-yard freestyle and the 100-yard butterfly,
with impressive times of 1:51 in the freestyle event
and 56 in the butterfly.
"My fly turns were slow and the splits in my 200 free
weren't even, but I was pretty happy with my times,"
Johnson said.
San Jose State senior Angie Wester finished close
behind Johnson in the 100 butterfly with a time of 56.4.
Senior Kathy Smith handily won the 100-yard
breaststroke with a time of 1:05.9. Smith and senior
sprinter Diana Zock are co-captains. Neilebeck finished
second with a time of 1:08.3.
Yesterday, distance swimmers Stacy Shupe and
Dana Anderson captured first and second places in the
1,650-yard freestyle. Shupe's time of 16:44.4 was
good enough to qualify her for the NCAA championship
meet in March.
