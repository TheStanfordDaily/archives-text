U.S. Strategy To Isolate Libya
NEW YORK — The Reagan Administration has developed a six
point strategy to isolate Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy politically,
militarily and economically, according to a published report.
The goal of the program is to clear the way for a U.S. military
strike should Khadafy provide cause for attack, Newsweek reported
in its Jan. 20 issue.
According to Newsweek, White House officials said the most likely
outcome is that Khadafy will be goaded into an assault on Americans,
giving the Administration an opportunity to retaliate militarily.
Some officials are keen for a fight but fear the Libyan leader will
lay low for a while, the magazine said. The strategists believe that if
they do not strike within the next six to nine months, they will miss
the tide of public outrage against Libya for its purported backing of
terrorism, according to the report.
These are the points that Newsweek said National Security Coun
cil official Donald Fortier put together to thwart Khadafy:
• Put Khadafy on the spot internationally by creating a consensus at
home and abroad that would allow implementation of the Administra
tion plan.
• Keep pressing allies to take action against Libya. This could in
clude interrupting military deals with France and Belgium if they con
tinue the sales.
• Use economic sanctions outlined by the president to complicate
Libya's problems of selling its oil in a weak market.
• Press ahead with a four-year-old CIA program to identify, finance
and encourage Khadafy's enemies, including those in his own mili
tary.
• Curb alleged Libyan hit squads by calling on allies to be more
vigilant in monitoriing Libyan diplomats, agents and diplomatic
pouches.
• Prepare for military action.
Peres Moves To End Dispute
JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Shimon Peres announced early
today that he had won approval during a stormy 12-hour meeting of
senior Cabinet members to submit a border dispute with Egypt to in
ternational arbitration.
Peres had threatened to resign, bringing down the politically
divided government, unless the 10-member inner Cabinet agreed to
arbitration to settle ownership of Taba, a strip of sand on the Red
Sea.
He had warned that further delays in settling rival claims to the
beach would jeopardize the 7-year-old peace agreement between the
two countries.
"This will enhance the relations between Israel and Egypt, who
are at peace. It will make peace stronger, more promising and more
stable," Peres told journalists who maintained an all-night vigil
outside the Cabinet session.
The agreement stipulates that in return for Israeli agreement to
arbitration, Egypt will improve trade and tourism ties and send back
its ambassador to Tel Aviv. The ambassador was recalled to protest
Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
There was no immediate word on who would arbitrate between
the two sides, or how the arbitor would be chosen.
Libya Accused of Downing Jet
KUWAIT — Kuwait's official KUNA news agency on Saturday
quoted a diplomat as saying Libyan anti-aircraft missile batteries shot
down a U. S. jet fighter over the Mediterranean last week.
It did not identify the diplomat but said the warplane was downed
Wednesday by a Soviet-made SAM-7 missile as it flew over the Gulf
of Sirte.
KUNA noted that a U.S. Navy spokesman in Rome had announced
that a Marine F-18 Hornet was missing Wednesday after taking off
from the aircraft carrier Coral Sea and was and believed lost at sea
off France's southern coast.
The Coral Sea had departed from Naples, Italy, on Jan. 3 with
about eight other vessels from the 6th Fleet and Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Khadafy claimed that America was massing warships off
the Libyan coast to prepare for an attack.
Washington denied that assertion and said the task force was on a
routihe mission in the western Mediterranean and far off the Libyan
coast.
A Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Gene Sands, was asked about
the Kuwaiti report and he said, "I have nothing to substantiate that."
He referred all further queries to the Navy, and Navy spokesman
Lt. Cmdr. Bill Sonntag said the missing plane was on a training exer
cise in the vicinity of Nice, France, when it disappeared.
"The status of the plane is missing and believed lost," he said,
adding that an investigation "is being conducted."
U.S. Official Tours Townships
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The State Department's top
African expert toured Johannesburg's trash-ridden black townships
yesterday, hours after a black activist who was to be one of his hosts
was hacked to death by political rivals.
Ampie Mayisa, 58, was chased from his home in Leandra township
74 miles east of Johannesburg, and killed by about 10 blacks ranging
in age from 16 to 30 about two hours after sundown Saturday, ac
cording to his son, Joshua Mayisa, and other Leandra residents.
Yesterday, Chester Crocker, assistant secretary of state for
African affairs, arrived for talks on independence for South-West
Africa, also known as Namibia, and on the civil war in Angola, which
is related to Namibian issues. Crocker was in Luanda, the Angolan
capital, on Friday.
Of Mayisa's death, Crocker said only, "It was terrible."
Holland Expands Terrorist Alert
THE HAGUE, Netherlands — A high alert to guard against possi
ble Palestinian terrorist attacks was expanded yesterday to include
U.S. diplomatic and commercial offices in the Netherlands, the
Dutch Justice Ministry said.
The access road to the front of the U.S. Embassy in The Hague
was blocked by sand-filled dumpsters at each end last night, and
police converged within minutes to investigate the flash of a photog
rapher's camera.
Police presence was increased at the U.S. consulate in Amster
dam, and police spokesman Klaas Wilting said other U.S. facilities
were being guarded.
The alert began Thursday in the Netherlands and Scandinavia,
when Interpol, the international police organization, warned that Abu
Nidal terrorist commandos might strike at any time against Jewish or
Israeli targets.
