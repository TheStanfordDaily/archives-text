WASHINGTON — Armed Iranian navy sailors
searching for war goods bound for Iraq yester
day boarded an American merchant ship sailing
in international waters just outside the Persian
Gulf, the State Department said.
There were no injuries or loss of property
during the two-hour search of the President
Taylor, the first U.S. flag ship to be stopped by
Iran, which has been fighting a five-year war
with neighboring Iraq, said department spokes
man Bruce Ammerman.
After the search, the bulk cargo ship owned
by the American President Lines, Ltd.,
proceeded to the port of Fujaira, located on the
Gulf of Oman in the United Arab Emirates, Am
merman said.
The ship was boarded yesterday at 11 a.m.
local time (11 p.m. PST), Ammerman said.
"Although this incident is obviously of serious
concern, we have not yet met with the ship's
J full fact's of tbp
case," he said.

The boarding party consisted of seven
Iranians who inspected the ship's manifest, said
Richard Tavrow, senior vice president and gen
eral counsel of the Oakland, Calif.-based ship
ping company.
Tavrow said the President Taylor, a bulk
cargo ship that usually carries grain between
West Asian ports, was stopped by a single
Iranian navy ship. The ship, which normally has a
crew of 40 to 45 seamen, was carrying bags of
grain when it was stopped, he said.
"We're certainly concerned because we serve
Fujaira and we are a major U.S. line company,"
Tavrow said. "To that extent we have to be very
concerned about anything" that interferes with
shipping traffic, he said.
None of the 23 ships operated by American
President Lines serves Iran or Iraq, Tavrow
said.
The search marked "the first time that a U.S.
flag vessel has been stopped by Iran," Ammer
man said.

"Iran ... for the past approximately five
months been conducting numerous visits and
searches of several neutral nations' merchant
ships in the gulf area looking for war supplies
destined for Iraq, its enemy in the five-year-old
war," he said.
"The Jan. 12 boarding under threat of arms of
the President Taylor is part of this practice by
Iran," Ammerman said.
The United States declared its neutrality after
the Iran-Iraq war broke out. But the Reagan Ad
ministration, while accusing Iraq of using chemi
cal weapons against Iran, has since resumed
diplomatic relations with Baghdad and organized
a campaign to urge other countries not to pro
vide arms to Iran.
Ammerman said the ship's crew radioed
American President Lines officials to report the
incident. The captain was being contacted by
American diplomats in the United Arab
Emirates, he said.
