# Official Syrian role remains unclear
## Shultz: Terrorists Trained on Syrian-held Land 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Secretary of
State George Shultz said yesterday
that intelligence reports indicate
the terrorists who attacked the
Rome and Vienna airports last
month were trained in Syrian
controlled territory of Lebanon.
But "to what extent, of course
. . . that involved the Syrian auth
orities, we're not able to say,"
Shultz said.
Appearing on the CBS program
"Face the Nation," Shultz acknowl
edged that U.S. and other intelli
gence agencies had determined the
terrorists had "been in the Bekaa
Valley (of eastern Lebanon) and
gone through Damascus."
Despite the new intelligence in
formation, "there is no plan or
thought about" imposing similar
sanctions on Syria, Shultz said.
"I hope Syria will not do things

that will make that necessary, and
my guess is that they won't," the
secretary said.
Shultz said that while Syria is on
the State Department's list of
countries supporting terrorism,
"Syria's picture is a rather different
one . . . Syria's behavior toward all
these things is rather different from
Libya's."
"And beyond that, of course, we
are working with Syria on a number
of fronts in a constructive way,"
Shultz added.
Shultz was apparently respond
ing to Syrian officials, quoted in
yesterday's editions of The New
York Times, who expressed irrita
tion over remarks last week by a
top U.S. official that sanctions
might be imposed against Syria.
Robert Oaklay, head of the State
Department's counterterrorism

unit, was asked by reporters
Thursday if sanctions might be
imposed against Syria. "It could

possibly come to that," he replied.
Oakley also charged that Syria
supports Abu Nidal, the renegade
Palestinian faction U.S. officials
believe was responsible for the
Dec. 27 attacks on the Rome and
Vienna airports that killed five
people and 19 wounded.
The Times quoted one Syrian
foreign ministry official in
Damascus as saying: "Our reaction
is beyond anger. We don't want in
creased tension between our two
countries but the Americans are
pushing us to it. Sometimes when
you put a cat in the corner, it turns
into a tiger."
Shultz said the sanctions were
imposed against Libya because that
nation "was clearly supporting ter
rorism in general," and was provid
ing financial support to Abu Nidal.
