# ASSU Inquiry
## Police review commission recommended 
### DAVID EMERSON Staff writer 
The ASSU Special Investigative
Committee last night called for the
establishment of a permanent com
mission to review campus police ac
tion and for the hiring of a profes
sional outside investigator to in
quire further into the allegations of
police brutality during arrests at an
October Old Union sit-in.
In a report scheduled to be be
presented to the full senate Tues
day, the committee proposed to
send an open letter to the local
media and "leaders in the Stanford
community" calling for a "long-term
approach towards the monitoring of
police behavior" through the crea
tion of a police review commission.
The proposal would also author
ize the Investigative Committee to
"do any fundraising necessary" in
order to hire an outside investigator
to continue the inquiry, the report
said.
The report states that an outside
investigation could cost from
$3,000 to $5,000.
The committee, consisting of
French Prof. Ray Giraud, Biology
Prof. Dow Woodward, ASSU Sen
ate Chair Carey White and Senators
John van Loben Sels, Joel Bellenson
and Frances Pordes, was created
Nov. 5 to "deliver a fair and un
biased invesitgation" into charges
of police misconduct.
The charges stem from an Oct.
11 incident at which nine students
were arrested at an Old Union sit-in
while protesting Stanford's invest
ments in companies that do busi
ness in South Africa.
The strtdemty-ctaimgd BtantorcL
police used excessive force in
removing them from the building,
and senior Robby Perkins has since
filed a $600,100 claim against the

University, the Stanford Police De
partment and the Santa Clara
County Sheriff s Department for al
leged beatings received while in
North County Jail.
In summarizing its activities, the
report states the committee viewed

a student-made videotape of the
events at Old Union, reviewed
Perkins' medical reports, and met
with Police Chief Marvin Her
rington to discuss police proce
dures in dealing with protestors.
The report also relates how at
tempts to obtain the police
videotape of the Old Union incident
were frustrated by University offi
cials.
In studying Law Prof. John
Kaplan's report on the actions at
Old Union, the committee reported
that "all of the relevant data was not
avaiinteAep to tfapinn tuni "conflicts
of interest mar the objectivity of
(Kaplan's) report. Kaplan's


Marvin Herrington
Stanford police chief
response toward overt police mis
conduct ... is not acceptable as an
unbiased and exhaustive analy
sis. . . . Further investigation must
be done."
Citing its own lack of expertise
and resources and the fact that its
findings could be challenged on
grounds of lack of impartiality, the
committee recommended that any
futher investigation "should be
done by an attorney or group of at
torneys not connected with the
University."
In order to defray the cost, the
committee suggested raising funds
by holding speaking events with ad
mission fees, selling T-shirts
related to the issue, soliciting
money from dorms and concerned
people outside the University, and
asking for donations from the

pooled salaries of the Council of
Presidents and other executive offi
cers of the ASSU.
The committee also suggests
that the senate offer matching
funds for what is raised elsewhere.
University President Donald
Kennedy declined to comment on
the committee's proposals last
night, saying he had not yet seen a
copy of the report.
In a Dec. 11 letter to the commit
tee, Kennedy said that an external
investigation into alleged police
brutality would be "unnecessary
and inappropriate."
Of the nine students arrested on
Oct. 11, three have since pleaded
no contest to charges of trespass
ing and have been sentenced to a
year's probation and 40 hours of
community service.
The other six, including Perkins,
have opted for a jury trial and will
face charges on Jan. 27 of trespass
ing and refusal to disperse.
