# ASSU Inquiry
## Police review commission recommended 
### DAVID EMERSON Staff writer 
The ASSU Special Investigative
Committee last night called for the
establishment of a permanent com
mission to review campus police ac
tion and for the hiring of a profes
sional outside investigator to in
quire further into the allegations of
police brutality during arrests at an
October Old Union sit-in.
In a report scheduled to be be
presented to the full senate Tues
day, the committee proposed to
send an open letter to the local
media and "leaders in the Stanford
community" calling for a "long-term
approach towards the monitoring of
police behavior" through the crea
tion of a police review commission.
The proposal would also author
ize the Investigative Committee to
"do any fundraising necessary" in
order to hire an outside investigator
to continue the inquiry, the report
said.
The report states that an outside
investigation could cost from
$3,000 to $5,000.
The committee, consisting of
French Prof. Ray Giraud, Biology
Prof. Dow Woodward, ASSU Sen
ate Chair Carey White and Senators
John van Loben Sels, Joel Bellenson
and Frances Pordes, was created
Nov. 5 to "deliver a fair and un
biased invesitgation" into charges
of police misconduct.
The charges stem from an Oct.
11 incident at which nine students
were arrested at an Old Union sit-in
while protesting Stanford's invest
ments in companies that do busi
ness in South Africa.
The strtdemty-ctaimgd BtantorcL
police used excessive force in
removing them from the building,
and senior Robby Perkins has since
filed a $600,100 claim against the

University, the Stanford Police De
partment and the Santa Clara
County Sheriff s Department for al
leged beatings received while in
North County Jail.
In summarizing its activities, the
report states the committee viewed

a student-made videotape of the
events at Old Union, reviewed
Perkins' medical reports, and met
with Police Chief Marvin Her
rington to discuss police proce
dures in dealing with protestors.
The report also relates how at
tempts to obtain the police
videotape of the Old Union incident
were frustrated by University offi
cials.
In studying Law Prof. John
Kaplan's report on the actions at
Old Union, the committee reported
that "all of the relevant data was not
avaiinteAep to tfapinn tuni "conflicts
of interest mar the objectivity of
(Kaplan's) report. Kaplan's
