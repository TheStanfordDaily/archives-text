Reagan Blasts Mafia
WASHINGTON — President Reagan was in
print as usual yesterday, but this time under
his own byline, declaring in a magazine article
on organized crime that "for the first time in
our history, we finally have the mob on the
run."
In the article in The New York Times Maga
zine, the president said that "like all too many
Americans, I've seen the mob at work." He
said his concern with organized crime
stemmed from his days a? an actor when
mobsters "moved in on the motion picture in
dustry."
Reagan said he was advised by police to
carry a pistol in the wake of violence and per
sonal threats while he was president of the
Screen Actors Guild.
Moving on to his presidency of the United
States, Reagan wrote, "There will be no
detente with the mob. It's war to the end. We
mean to cripple their organization."
House Criticizes FDA
WASHINGTON — The Food and Drug Ad
ministration hasn't protected consumers from
exposure to dangerous drugs given to animals
that could turn up in meat, milk and poultry, a
House committee charged yesterday in a new
report.
The House Government Operations Com
mittee said the FDA has lost sight of its mis
sion to protect the public from the residues of
veterinary drugs.

"FDA has consistently disregarded its re
sponsibility for assuring the safety of drugs
used in food-producing animals," said Rep.
Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.) chairman of the panel's
subcommittee on human resources, in releas
ing the report.
"FDA has repeatedly put what it perceives
are interests of veterinarians and the livestock
industry in the availability of additional animal
drugs ahead of its legal obligation to protect
consumers from the potentially hazardous
residues they may leave in meat, milk and
eggs," Weiss said.
The committee's report was based on two
days of congressional hearings last summer at
which FDA officials conceded that only a small
percentage of the estimated 20,000 animal
drugs on the market have been approved by
the agency.
Columbia Launched
SPACE CENTER, Houston — Shuttle Co
lumbia and its seven-man crew soared
smoothly into orbit yesterday, overcoming a
record number of false starts, and then sent
the world's most powerful commercial commu
nications satellite spinning off into space.
Columbia, kept earthbound through seven
launch delays since Dec. 18, climbed flawlessly
through a blue Florida sky from the Kennedy
Space Center and left a smoke trail tinged
crimson and white by the rising sun.
It was the first of 15 shuttle launches sched
uled in 1986, expected to be the nation's

busiest year in space.
Nine-and-a-half hours later, the astronauts
sent signals to eject the $50 million RCA Sat
com KU-1 satellite from Columbia's cargo bay.
The crew reported the satellite seemed to
spring out on its own two seconds earlier than
expected, but space officials said this would
present no problem.
RCA officials said the Satcom will be capable
of providing video and audio communications
for all of the United States except Alaska,
delivering a signal powerful enough to be
received by dish antennas as small as three
feet.
The countdown to launch proceeded without
a flaw, and Columbia blasted off on schedule at
6:55 a.m. EST, carrying seven astronauts, in
cluding Rep. Bill Nelson, a Democrat whose
district includes Cape Canaveral.
Bonner Heart Surgery
BOSTON — Soviet dissident Yelena Bon
ner entered a hospital yesterday for heart sur
gery, worried because she has received no
word in more than two weeks from her hus
band, Nobel Peace Prke winner Andrei Sak
harov, her family said.
She was scheduled to undergo heart bypass
surgery today.
Bonner, 62, who suffers severe heart pain,
waved to reporters, smiled and said goodbye,
but had no comment as she entered Massachu
setts General Hospital with her mother, Ruth
Bonner, and her son, Alexei Semyonov.
