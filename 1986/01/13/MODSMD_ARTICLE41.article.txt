GOP Hopefuls Clash
IRVINE — Five prospective Republican
candidates for a U.S. Senate seat disagreed on
whether religious views should sway laws pre
venting job discrimination against
homosexuals.
In a debate at the University of California at
Irvine over the weekend, the question
revolved around Assembly Bill 1, which would
have prohibited biased hiring practices against
homosexuals.
The measure was approved by the
Legislature in 1984, but vetoed by Gov.
George Deukmejian.
State Sen. Ed Davis, who voted for the bill,
said religious values should not be applied to
such matters.

"On the issue of ABI, I don't think you're
talking about religion. You're talking about in
dividual rights, an innate right to employ
ment," he said.
But state Assemblyman William Dan
nemeyer of Fullerton said: "God's plan for man
is Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve."
Assemblyman Dan Lungren argued that
lawmakers have a duty to apply their religious
leanings to all political decisions.
Election Reform Issue
SACRAMENTO — Campaign reform, a po
litical issue that won't go away, surfaces again
this week in the Legislature with some big
names leading the way.
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San

Francisco), his Ways and Committee chair
man, John VasconcelJos (D-San Jose) and the
No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, Majority
Leader Barry Keene, are teaming up to intro
duce legislation today that's modeled after the
recommendations of a prestigious bipartisan
commission.
The proposals of the privately funded Cali
fornia Commission on Campaign Financing in
clude limits on contributions to legislative can
didates, a ban on non-election-year fund
raising by those candidates, and spending
ceilings for candidates who accept limited
public financing for their races.
Concerns about sharply increasing campaign
budgets and the legislative influence of wealthy
special-interest contributors have made such
proposals perennial issues in Sacramento.
