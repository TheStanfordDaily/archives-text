# Heart Defects Film Debuted at the Med Center
## 
### MARY K. McDEVITT Staff writer 
"A Different Heart," a documentary
about children with congenital heart
defects and how their families cope with
them, premiered Saturday at Stanford
Medical Center before an audience of
about 250.
The 20-minute film, produced, edited
and directed by Itaka Schlubach-Hicks in
1985 for her master's thesis in communi
cation and film, features three Stanford
Hospital heart patients and their families.
Schlubach-Hicks began research on the
project in April 1984 after a friend bore a
child with multiple heart defects.
"People would come up to the baby car
riage and leave," Schlubach-Hicks said.
"They didn't know how to react. I realized
that medicine is advancing so fast that
more and more kids are surviving the
defects. And more parents are having to

cope with it.
Schlubach-Hicks is working to dis
tribute the film to the American Heart As
sociation and medical centers throughout
the nation.
"We think the film will make it easier for
parents who have the same problem,"
said Jeff Ross, father of four-year-old
Julianna, one of the heart patients
featured in the film.
"If we could have seen this film sitting
in the waiting room at the hospital, we
could have known we'd be bringing her
home," Ross said.
"My role (in making the film) was just
taking into my hands what they gave me
and squeezing it gently and giving it
back," Schlubach-Hicks said.
The afternoon showing was the second
film premiere at the medical center in the
past two years, according to Jeanne Ken
nedy, director of the office of community
and patient relations. Kirby Walker pre-

sented a film on high-risk pregnancy in
1984.
Several film students seemed im
pressed with the quality of Schlubach-
Hicks' documentary, a $14,000 project
funded by the Louis B. Mayer Foundation,
the Kohl-Solovy Foundation and private
donors.
"She used music very effectively," said
Lynn Mueller, a master's candidate in
communication. "And she selected very
appropriate and emotional statements that
came spontaneously from the people she
interviewed."
Thirteen-year-old Jason Heppler said
he hopes his film debut will lead to a movie
career.
At age 11, Heppler was the star of
"Jason," a preliminary version of "A Dif
ferent Heart" that won honorary mention
at the Palo Alto Film Festival in May 1985.
"I don't want to be an astronaut
anymore," Heppler said. "I want to be an
actor."
