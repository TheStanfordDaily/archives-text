# The 						Dorm Walls Have Personality
## FEATURES 
### AMY EINHORN 
When Meg Walsh, the poster buyer for the
Stanford Bookstore, says she is not at liberty to
reveal the number of posters sold or which ones
sold the best, I realized that posters are taken
very seriously by the Stanford community.
"What could she be hiding?" you might ask,
just like I did.
Looking into rooms on campus reveals what
Malsh would not — namely, the most popular
posters, the clues they give about the poster
hanger's personality and even the workings of an
anti-communist plot.
"All this from posters?" you may be snicker
ing. But it's true. Posters are serious buisiness
at Stanford.
Ask freshman Mark Smoyer. His favorite pos
ter is a French painting by Jim Dine hanging over
his bed entitled "Cardinal." He insists that since
he bought the poster before college it was a sign
of divine inspiration that subsequently led him to
Stanford.
Smoyer is not alone — posters play key roles
in other people's lives too. I walked into lots of
rooms and saw four soccer posters fighting for
wall space over one bed. "By any chance you
wouldn't happen to be a soccer player, would
you?"

Posters reassure their frequent onlookers of
their identities. Hy having soccer posters up, an
amateur goalie is reminded that he's a soccer
player every time he looks at them.
Every morning that pseudo-Pele wakes up to
a grinning line of fellow athletes and immediately
knows that he too is one of them.
Posters of native cities are very common, for

it seems to be a popular way to decorate a room
and ease homesickness at the same time.
Posters of these type come in two varieties.
First, the idyllic, picture postcardish poster with
the city in bright lights, and second, the realistic
ones.

A poster entitled "And I Love NY
..." had, among other things
pictured, a couple making love in a
taxi in the middle of a traffic jam and
a "woman" with an erection staring
at a streaker.
If the above sounds rather ex
plicit, you really haven't been in
many Stanford dorm rooms. One
elongated poster pictures a bare
Nastassia Kinski wrapped by a
snake, which is also elongated.
Stanford students are very fit
ness conscious and their posters
exhibit a preference for aestheti
cally pleasing bodies. "Soloflex" ad
vertisements, depicting a well-built
man in the process of taking off his
shirt, seem to be a favorite among
Stanford women.
But the Soloflex popularity
seems paltry compared to the cor
responding popularity that the"St.
Pauli Girl" beer advertisements
have among the men. The poster
depicts a woman in a revealing
neckline, serving beer. How "You
always remember your first girl"
when you're drunk and passed out
on St. Pauli beer remains to be an
swered, but this doesn't seem to
bother anyone.
Freshmen Paul Isherwood and
Joe Boyt not only have 34 beer
posters in their room (Paul's par
ents went to a beer festival), but Is
herwood also has an autographed
St. Pauli poster from the St. Pauli
Girl of 1985.
One St. Pauli poster owner,
sophomore Dusan Djordjevich, was
asked if it bothered him that peole
might get a typecast impression
about him since he had the poster
up on his wall. "What kind of im
pression?" he asked, and his
roonmate answered, "You know,
the kind of guy who pulls wings off
of flies." Even this branding didn't
seem to bother Djordjevich.
Students put whatever pleases
them on their walls, regardless of
social acceptability. "Anything
goes" seems to be the attitude
many students have toward
decorating their walls.
Freshman Cheri Dennison, a res
ident of Trancos, has three maps of
the world because she "likes the
blue of the water." She later added
that she was bad in geography and
she thought it might help.
There are posters of Albert
Einstein sticking out his tongue,
riding a bicycle or just standing life
size in a trench coat; a full-length
Darth Vader; a wall covered with
airplane safety instructions; and a
poster that told the story of
children with names from A to Z

and how they met their deaths: " 'A'
is for AMY who fell down the stairs,
'B' is for BASIL assaulted by bears."
Certain people have specific
reasons for putting up their
posters. Alexandra Lutch, a fresh
man in Trancos, put up a Bryan
Adams poster because "she wanted
something mildly trendy."
Sophomore Charlie Hamori, a
pre-med, has a periodic table up on
his wall. "You're not really a pre
med without one," he says.
Some of the"in" art work stu
dents have lining their walls were
created by Nagel and M. C. Escher.
Andrew Myers, a sophomore from
Stern, says he likes his Escher
drawing because it "represents
something confusing and interest
ing and cannot exist."
Another popular poster series is
Gary Larson's "Far Side" and of
course "Bloom County" by Berke
Breathed.
What posters tell about people is

hard to say. Yes, the person who
had an Escher was a physics major,
but it seems that generalizations,
when posters and personalities are
concerned, don't work.
As Dennison (the one Aith the
maps) says, "People have neat stuff
up on their walls who y< u wouldn't
think have such art' tic taste."
People who appear to >e simple can
appear much "deeper" when you
look at their posters, and vice
versa.
Posters of cars are not sure in
dications of an empty materialist,
just as posters of Einstein by no
way mean an intellect is nearby.
If posters are not always in
dicative of overt personality, then
what do they mean?
Many people say posters allevi
ate the "prison-like" atmosphere of
the dorm rooms. When students
arrive at their dorm rooms in Sep
tember, their empty rooms look
like shoe boxes, but by the time
they have unpacked and put up

their posters more home-like envi
ronments are created.
"That's all very interesting but
what about the anti-communist
plot?" you may ask.
Well, here it is. Sophomore
Charlie Hamori has a special rela
tionship with his posters. When
Hamori was in Budapest visiting
relatives he bought a poster of
former Soviet leader Yuri Andropov
for 12 cents. Then, six months
later, "the cat (Andropov) kicks
off."
Last year, Hamori stole a poster
of Andropov's successor, Konstan
tin Chernenko, at a fraternity party.
Chernenko died two months later,
which led the pre-med to believe he
had a curse on Soviet leaders.
He has since tried to get a poster
of Mikhail Gorbachev, but his at
tempts have been futile — he in
sists that the Soviets have gotten
wind of his power. He has had to be
content with two posters of Lenin
and one of the Kremlin.
