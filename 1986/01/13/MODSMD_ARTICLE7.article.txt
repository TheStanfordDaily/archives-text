# The
						Dorm Walls Have Personality

When Meg Walsh, the poster buyer for the
Stanford Bookstore, says she is not at liberty to
reveal the number of posters sold or which ones
sold the best, I realized that posters are taken
very seriously by the Stanford community.
"What could she be hiding?" you might ask,
just like I did.
Looking into rooms on campus reveals what
Malsh would not — namely, the most popular
posters, the clues they give about the poster
hanger's personality and even the workings of an
anti-communist plot.
"All this from posters?" you may be snicker
ing. But it's true. Posters are serious buisiness
at Stanford.
Ask freshman Mark Smoyer. His favorite pos
ter is a French painting by Jim Dine hanging over
his bed entitled "Cardinal." He insists that since
he bought the poster before college it was a sign
of divine inspiration that subsequently led him to
Stanford.
Smoyer is not alone — posters play key roles
in other people's lives too. I walked into lots of
rooms and saw four soccer posters fighting for
wall space over one bed. "By any chance you
wouldn't happen to be a soccer player, would
you?"

Posters reassure their frequent onlookers of
their identities. Hy having soccer posters up, an
amateur goalie is reminded that he's a soccer
player every time he looks at them.
Every morning that pseudo-Pele wakes up to
a grinning line of fellow athletes and immediately
knows that he too is one of them.
Posters of native cities are very common, for

it seems to be a popular way to decorate a room
and ease homesickness at the same time.
Posters of these type come in two varieties.
First, the idyllic, picture postcardish poster with
the city in bright lights, and second, the realistic
ones.
