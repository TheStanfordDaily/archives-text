# Funding Amendment Receives Criticism
## 
### STEVE STREED 
An amendment to the ASSU con
stitution that could affect the fund
ing of student groups stirred up
controversy over the weekend
when a campus activist complained
that a pre-election booklet would
not include a statement of opposi
tion to the proposal.
The amendment, to be voted on
in the Jan. 28 and 29 special elec
tion, would allow students to set
the amount of money the ASSU
gives to small groups in the annual
spring quarter election. If the
amendment passes there would be
a list of different dollar figures on
the ballot for each general fee, and
the students could vote on the fee
they would like to set.
Student groups were not notified
and given time to prepare opposing
statements to appear in the election
booklet, according to Eric Diesel,
treasurer of the Coalition Against
Apartheid.
Diesel complained to several
senators about the ASSU's failure
to notify groups of the printing of
the election booklet, and ASSU
Elections Commissioner Lori
Abert agreed to allow him to submit
an opposition statement. Diesel
wrote statements in opposition to
the funding amendment and to an
amendment regarding the term of
members of the nominations com
mittee. His statements are to be
printed in the elections pamphlet.
"Not one of the student groups
affected was officially notified (that
opposing statements could be
made)," Diesel said.
Senate Chair Carey White agreed
the ASSU "should have put out
a flier." The senate "simply did not
have enough time to print a flier and
send it to all the student groups,"
he said.
ASSU senator Jim DeLaHunt
agreed. "There was just no time to
notify anyone. We were too busy
trying to put (the election) on," he
said. White said students would be
given ample opportunity to voice
opposition to items in the spring
election.
DeLaHunt, the author of the
amendment, said the main purpose
of the second constitutional amend
ment is to encourage the student
community to "take more interest"
in the amounts student groups
receive from the ASSU.
"In the past," DeLaHunt
said, the senate tried to
guess what the students wanted (in
programming); now, by voting on
the general fees the students can
do that themselves."
White said the amendment
would give the student community
a chance to decide on the level of
programming it wants at Stanford.
"If the students themselves directly
decide on the amount of funding
they want to give small groups,"
White reasoned, the groups "will
have to do a better job with pro
gramming. They will have to come
up with programming appeal."
Diesel said the new amend
ment will have two adverse effects
on student programming. Provided
that students would vote for less
funds in the general fee assess
ments, student groups would be
forced to cut programming in order
to stay within budget, he said.
In addition, new and innovative

groups would "never get off the
ground" if they did not receive any
funding, he said.
Leaders of some other student
groups, however, do not view the
amendment as a cause for alarm.
Tony James, program director
for KZSU, said he did not think the
upcoming elections would pose a
threat to the student-run radio sta
tion. He said, "the number of votes
we got in the fee assessment has al
ways been very high; one would
like to think that the trend would
continue (whether or not students
vote directly on the general fees.)"
James said he did not think that
having students vote on the sum of
a general fee for all student groups
would hurt any one group. "The
trend has been for the votes to help
out everyone."

Rick Motamedi, treasurer of
Stanford Out of South Africa,
agreed with James. "In the past
year there has been a lot of student
activism and I think that the stu
dents would vote 100 percent of
past funds or more," he said.
Two constitutional amendments
and a new constitution will be voted
on in the special election.
The first amendment would
remove specifications on the length
of a term for a member of the nom
ination committee. That amend
ment was conceived of before back
ers of the new constitution had
begun work on it.
If the new constitution passes in
the Jan. 28, 29 special election, the
length of the terms for the nomina
tion committee would be specified
in the bylaws.
