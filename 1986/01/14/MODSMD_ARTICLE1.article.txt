# Funding Amendment Receives Criticism
## 
### STEVE STREED 
An amendment to the ASSU con
stitution that could affect the fund
ing of student groups stirred up
controversy over the weekend
when a campus activist complained
that a pre-election booklet would
not include a statement of opposi
tion to the proposal.
The amendment, to be voted on
in the Jan. 28 and 29 special elec
tion, would allow students to set
the amount of money the ASSU
gives to small groups in the annual
spring quarter election. If the
amendment passes there would be
a list of different dollar figures on
the ballot for each general fee, and
the students could vote on the fee
they would like to set.
Student groups were not notified
and given time to prepare opposing
statements to appear in the election
booklet, according to Eric Diesel,
treasurer of the Coalition Against
Apartheid.
Diesel complained to several
senators about the ASSU's failure
to notify groups of the printing of
the election booklet, and ASSU
Elections Commissioner Lori
Abert agreed to allow him to submit
an opposition statement. Diesel
wrote statements in opposition to
the funding amendment and to an
amendment regarding the term of
members of the nominations com
mittee. His statements are to be
printed in the elections pamphlet.
"Not one of the student groups
affected was officially notified (that
opposing statements could be
made)," Diesel said.
Senate Chair Carey White agreed
the ASSU "should have put out
a flier." The senate "simply did not
have enough time to print a flier and
send it to all the student groups,"
he said.
ASSU senator Jim DeLaHunt
agreed. "There was just no time to
notify anyone. We were too busy
trying to put (the election) on," he
said. White said students would be
given ample opportunity to voice
opposition to items in the spring
election.
DeLaHunt, the author of the
amendment, said the main purpose
of the second constitutional amend
ment is to encourage the student
community to "take more interest"
in the amounts student groups
receive from the ASSU.
"In the past," DeLaHunt
said, the senate tried to
guess what the students wanted (in
programming); now, by voting on
the general fees the students can
do that themselves."
White said the amendment
