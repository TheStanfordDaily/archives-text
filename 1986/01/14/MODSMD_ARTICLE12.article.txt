With the filing of a claim against the University,
the Stanford Police and the Santa Clara County
Sheriff s Office last week, investigation into allega
tions of police brutality is likely to begin from an
other source.
Senior Robby Perkins' claim asking for damages
of $600,100 is unlikely to be met by the University
because such an action would be a tacit admission
that Perkins' charge of being beaten by police has a
basis in truth.
We assume, therefore, that the claim will be
denied and Perkins will file a lawsuit.
The lawsuit will become, in effect, a separate in
quiry by opening up further investigation into the
matter. The weight of the courts should facilitate
the procurement of evidence and provide increased
access to information about the events at North
County Jail, where Perkins claims he was strip
searched and beaten.

Both students and University President Donald
Kennedy have called for a full and open disclosure of
the disputed events, and attempts have been — and
are being — made.
Law Prof. John Kaplan, at the behest of Kennedy,
tried and failed to answer the allegations of police
brutality. Kaplan's report suffers from the stigma of
bias and the inability to discover precisely what hap
pened to Perkins at the jail.
Dissatisfied with Kaplan's internal report, the
ASSU set up a special committee. Its task: to organ
ize an external, unbiased inquiry into the matter.
Although hampered by Kennedy's disapproval
and lack of cooperation, the committee is continuing
its efforts to appoint an outside investigator.
Somehow, the issue of police brutality must be
resolved. We believe that an investigation spurred
by a lawsuit and the ASSU-sponsored inquiry will go
a long way toward achieving this goal.
