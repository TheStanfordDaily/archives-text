## Act With Soviets Against Libya 
### 
Now is the time for decisive ac
tion against Moammar Khadafy.
There is no reason a civilized world
should stand by while this path
ological hater uses tyranny over
his own people as a platform for ter
rorism.
Obviously, it would be a terrible
mistake to carry out a "retalia
tory strike" aimed at punish
ing but not containing Libyan and
Libyan-sponsored terrorists. You

VIEWPOINT

don't whack a hornet's nest with a
stick — you put it in a bag. If we are
not prepared to overthrow Khadafy
and immediately take the fullest
possible control of the Libyan bor
ders, we should not do anything.
In addition to the dangers of so
large a military operation, many
people question the propriety of
overthrowing even Moammar
Khadafy. How are we different
from the Soviets in Afghanistan if
we go into Libya and install a
regime more to our liking?
If the United States could be
trusted to let Libya determine its
future democratically, many qualms
would be stilled. The problem is
that the Reagan Administration
shows almost a disdain for
democracy whenever it might not
elect who the United Stated likes.
Remember one fine month in 1981
when Reagan warned the French
about electing the socialist Francois
Mitterrand, and then Vice Presi

dent George Bush declared love for
the Philippines' great democracy?
Succeeding years have only shown
how deeply rooted the Reagan Ad
ministration's taste for autocracy
really is.
There is a way, though, to guar
antee to the world that we are not
out to install and maintain a client
regime. We can bring the Soviet
Union on board and together su
pervise a constitutional democracy
in Libya. Some of the other Arabs
should be included, and Libya would
be demilitarized, of course.
The case is compelling. There
are about 14,000 Soviet personnel
in Libya. Many are operating the
advanced SAM-5 anti-aircraft
missile batteries that are sure to be
central to any conflict. Also, the
Soviets have some 600 combat
aircraft in Libya, including many of
their best, along with plenty of
other conventional weaponry. Much
of this is not ready for use but is
simply stored in Libya for the day
when the Soviets see an opportu
nity to take over North Africa or
the Mediterranean or whatever
other fun they prepare for.
Suppose we tell the Soviets that
we want to avoid superpower con
flict, but we are going to knock
off Khadafy. To prove it is the crim
inal Khadafy that we are after and
not military advantage, we offer to
return all military booty to the So
viet Union without even examining
it. In addition, we make the offer
that the Soviet Union join us in

making Libya an internationally su
pervised democracy in which both
superpowers can see to it that nei
ther their allies nor anyone in Libya
is deprived of political or other
rights.
It would be an offer the Soviets
could not refuse, since we would
knock off Khadafy in any case, and
it would demonstrate the United
States' true colors — that our goals
are peace and self-determination,
not hegemony.
Even if the Soviets insisted on
aiding the Libyans and using their
SAM-ss, we should persist in ask
ing for their input and joint supervi
sion of the new constitutional
democracy. We might even still of
fer them their planes back, minus a
couple for each of ours they shoot
down. The principle that countries
are for their own people first and
not to be used as pawns by tyrants
or superpowers is one we must
assert. It would be a great loss of
opportunity if the United States
succeeded in using Khadafy as a
means to transform Libya from a
Soviet military base to a U.S. mili
tary base.
I cheered when we invaded
Grenada. I would have gone after
Phillipine President Ferdinand
Marcos first, then Chilean Presi
dent Augusto Pinochet, but Austin
and Coard were obvious candidates
too. Like many people, though, I
did not trust this country to be true
to its democratic principles in
Grenada. Who would when the

norm in U. S. client states is to mur
der not only Marxist opponents but
Christian Democrats in El Salvador,
Benigno Aquino in the Philippines,
etc.?
How is it any different to stand
by and watch a government mug its
own people than to watch a person
mugged on the street? Yet the
United States regularly sponsors
such thuggery. Every honest per
son should welcome a role for other
countries and organizations that
want to see the great principles of
liberty upheld in the world, espe
cially where it is against our own
resistance.
And why should such a role stick
in the Soviet craw? They would be
offered real influence and a chance
to learn about real democracy.
Maybe they might even find that it
is possible for a communist system
to win popular support in a free so
ciety when totalitarianism is denied
to them.
Who doesn't believe that the
United States and the Soviet Union
will one day love each other and feel
immeasurable gladness for the size
of this globe?
We have a responsibility to take
the square held by the Soviet's de
mented ally, Moammar Khadafy.
Let's take that square, and not
keep it, but in the service of peace
and justice, return it to whom it
belongs.

son should welcome a role for other
countries and organizations that
want to see the great principles of
liberty upheld in the world, espe
cially where it is against our own
resistance.
And why should such a role stick
in the Soviet craw? They would be
offered real influence and a chance
to learn about real democracy.
Maybe they might even find that it
is possible for a communist system
to win popular support in a free so
ciety when totalitarianism is denied
to them.
Who doesn't believe that the
United States and the Soviet Union
will one day love each other and feel
immeasurable gladness for the size
of this globe?
We have a responsibility to take
the square held by the Soviet's de
mented ally, Moammar Khadafy.
Let's take that square, and not
keep it, but in the service of peace
and justice, return it to whom it
belongs.

dent in economics.)
Now is the time for decisive ac
tion against Moammar Khadafy.
There is no reason a civilized world
should stand by while this path
ological hater uses tyranny over
his own people as a platform for ter
rorism.
Obviously, it would be a terrible
mistake to carry out a "retalia
tory strike" aimed at punish
ing but not containing Libyan and
Libyan-sponsored terrorists. You

VIEWPOINT

don't whack a hornet's nest with a
stick — you put it in a bag. If we are
not prepared to overthrow Khadafy
and immediately take the fullest
possible control of the Libyan bor
ders, we should not do anything.
In addition to the dangers of so
large a military operation, many
people question the propriety of
overthrowing even Moammar
Khadafy. How are we different
from the Soviets in Afghanistan if
we go into Libya and install a
regime more to our liking?
If the United States could be
trusted to let Libya determine its
future democratically, many qualms
would be stilled. The problem is
that the Reagan Administration
shows almost a disdain for
democracy whenever it might not
elect who the United Stated likes.
Remember one fine month in 1981
when Reagan warned the French
about electing the socialist Francois
Mitterrand, and then Vice Presi

dent George Bush declared love for
the Philippines' great democracy?
Succeeding years have only shown
how deeply rooted the Reagan Ad
ministration's taste for autocracy
really is.
There is a way, though, to guar
antee to the world that we are not
out to install and maintain a client
regime. We can bring the Soviet
Union on board and together su
pervise a constitutional democracy
in Libya. Some of the other Arabs
should be included, and Libya would
be demilitarized, of course.
The case is compelling. There
are about 14,000 Soviet personnel
in Libya. Many are operating the
advanced SAM-5 anti-aircraft
missile batteries that are sure to be
central to any conflict. Also, the
Soviets have some 600 combat
aircraft in Libya, including many of
their best, along with plenty of
other conventional weaponry. Much
of this is not ready for use but is
simply stored in Libya for the day
when the Soviets see an opportu
nity to take over North Africa or
the Mediterranean or whatever
other fun they prepare for.
Suppose we tell the Soviets that
we want to avoid superpower con
flict, but we are going to knock
off Khadafy. To prove it is the crim
inal Khadafy that we are after and
not military advantage, we offer to
return all military booty to the So
viet Union without even examining
it. In addition, we make the offer
that the Soviet Union join us in

making Libya an internationally su
pervised democracy in which both
superpowers can see to it that nei
ther their allies nor anyone in Libya
is deprived of political or other
rights.
It would be an offer the Soviets
could not refuse, since we would
knock off Khadafy in any case, and
it would demonstrate the United
States' true colors — that our goals
are peace and self-determination,
not hegemony.
Even if the Soviets insisted on
aiding the Libyans and using their
SAM-ss, we should persist in ask
ing for their input and joint supervi
sion of the new constitutional
democracy. We might even still of
fer them their planes back, minus a
couple for each of ours they shoot
down. The principle that countries
are for their own people first and
not to be used as pawns by tyrants
or superpowers is one we must
assert. It would be a great loss of
opportunity if the United States
succeeded in using Khadafy as a
means to transform Libya from a
Soviet military base to a U.S. mili
tary base.
I cheered when we invaded
Grenada. I would have gone after
Phillipine President Ferdinand
Marcos first, then Chilean Presi
dent Augusto Pinochet, but Austin
and Coard were obvious candidates
too. Like many people, though, I
did not trust this country to be true
to its democratic principles in
Grenada. Who would when the

norm in U. S. client states is to mur
der not only Marxist opponents but
Christian Democrats in El Salvador,
Benigno Aquino in the Philippines,
etc.?
How is it any different to stand
by and watch a government mug its
own people than to watch a person
mugged on the street? Yet the
United States regularly sponsors
such thuggery. Every honest per
son should welcome a role for other
countries and organizations that
