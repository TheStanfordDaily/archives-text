# Reach Out and Touch Someone
## 
### 
How many times do people go through an
entire day — or an entire week or month —
without so much as even touching another per
son?
I'm not exactly sure, but my best guess is that
it happens much too often. People need physical
contact just as they need other forms of support
in their personal interactions. Despite all of
the health awareness here at Stanford, it seems
as though large numbers of people live with the
unhealthy practice of not having enough regular
physical contact.

Sometimes, people will go to great lengths to
enjoy the company of a companion. In White
Plaza last week, one could not help but notice
the crowd waiting for tickets to the Viennese
Ball. Students are willing to pay $40 for tickets,
not to mention the cost of dinner, flowers and
attire, all for one evening of being close to an
other person. Although the Viennese Ball is
truly a smashing event, it actually serves a small
number of students, and it is only one night.
Obviously, romantic relationships are impor
tant to a lot of people. Yet all things considered,
it is difficult to escape the conclusion that when it
comes to dating and relationships, Stanford is a
Division II school.
Here is my assessment of some of the prob
lems at hand:
• Overestimation of negative consequences.
People fear the end of relationships before they

get started. The scenario of a person worrying
about going out with someone else in their
residence for fear that it would be uncomfortable
to live near one another if the relationship breaks
up is all too familiar.
To me, this is like dropping a class the first
day because you don't know the material and you
are worried about the final. It sounds ridiculous,
and it is, but people make decisions like this all of
the time to avoid taking chances.
• Hang-ups on appearance. A standard cop-out
which fills the air is that there are no "good
looking" girls or guys here. I think that men
more frequently advance this criticism. If beauty
is in the eyes of the beholder, then a lot of people
need corrective lenses.
This is a particularly pernicious problem, for it
fans the flames of insecurity by making people
more self-conscious about their appearance.
Personally, I think that the reason people set
standards for attractiveness that are arbitrarily
high is to avoid the vulnerability of going out with
someone whom others might perceive as inade
quate. In any event, it is disappointing that so
many students dwell on skin-deep physical ap
pearances.
• Importance of image over actions. For some
reason, in the world of surface impressions, it is
often more attractive to another person to show
less interest toward them. Conversely, people
who show genuine affection often bite the
proverbial dust. Not only do nice guys and nice
girls finish last, they often don't even get started
in the first place.
Social outlooks evolve as individuals get more
sophisticated and develop more seasoned
values. I think that the image/status-oriented at
titudes that are prevalent here are at
a rather immature stage of the evolutionary
process.
• Wishful thinking. People sometimes simply ex
pect too much. I am reminded of the Woody Al

len joke that we are all looking for a tailor-made
suit in an off-the-rack world.
Also, people misjudge their own actions when
hopes and dreams cloud their reality. Accord
ingly, this can lead to poor situational judgment
and devastating consequences for relationships,
which generally require at least some degree of
spontaneity. In other words, if your heart is on
fire, don't let the smoke get in your eyes.
• Fear of sex. Much of this campus is extremely
risk-averse when it comes to sex. Further,
years of being overly cautious have manifested
themselves in a lack of experience for many.
Of course, college is a time when people should
follow through on opportunities to explore their
interests — sexual and otherwise. But all of the
oysters in the world cannot overcome deeply
held fears and risk-averse attitudes.
When there is a consistent pattern of a large
proportion of students failing to find close
relationships, it is a sign to me that there is a
considerable amount of insecurity among individ
uals here and this insecurity is playing far
too large a role in social interactions. As in our
current federal government, it is as if defense
mechanisms get priority over an active social
agenda. This is indeed lamentable; allowing fears
to dictate one's decisions, in any facet of life, is
not a very good strategy for the pursuit of happi
ness.
I am not suggesting that there be a ninth dis
tribution requirement of at least one quarter
long relationship during a person's four years.
(Can you imagine Psych 499 — Independent
Study: Romantic Involvement, staff, 3-5 units,
dhr?) The point is that people should bring it
upon themselves to make things happen. The
time is right as we begin this new term. Take a
chance — give another person a break. Winter
quarter does not have to be cold and grey.
