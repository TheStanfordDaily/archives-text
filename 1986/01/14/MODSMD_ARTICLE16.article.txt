Get Gorbachev,
Botha, KKK
Unlike senior Joel Brick (The
Daily, Jan. 6), I have no strong
moral objections to inviting Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev to speak
at Commencement. What I do
object to is merely the frivolity of
what is clearly no more than a silly
provocation. But, assuming it was
serious — no problem at all. All
kinds of bandits speak in public
forums in the United States all the
time, and Stanford is not so
morally pure in its pursuit of truth
that Gorbachev would be wholly
out of place here.
I would just ask one thing: If
Gorbachev is invited one year, you
must ask South African President
Pieter Botha the next and perhaps
the Imperial Wizard of the Klu Klux
Klan the year after. They may not
be as powerful as Gorbachev, but
they are generally in the same line
of political business, which is fight
ing democracy.

Institution

Immoral Tactics
Contrary to the column by Vic
tor Vescovo (The Daily, Jan. 8),
the United States already uses
immoral means to shore up its
global empire. Supplementing its
economic stranglehold on Third
World nations with war, subversion

and systematic state terrorism that
dwarfs the past year's series of
terrorist incidents, the United
States faces absolutely no threat to
its survival. The idea that the
United States is encircled, as put .
forth by Vescovo, is nonsense. Mr,
Vescovo should get his facts
straight or put his money where
his mouth is and join a CIA terror
unit so he can act out his paranoid
fantasies of "amoral" covert vio
lence.

Clarification
Of Tax Issue
The article in Friday's Daily on
the tax bill needs clarification. We
would appreciate the following
information as soon as possible.
To clarify The Daily's coverage
of the U.S. Senate, the only stu
dents affected will be those holding
taxable TAs and RAs — about 700
of the 4,000 TAs and RAs. These
students will now be required to
include their tuition credits from
the University as part of their
taxable income.
An open forum will be held on
Jan. 29th from 5-7 p.m. in Crown
Quad, rm. 180, Stanford Law
School. Representatives from the
Controller's Office, the Office of
Public Affairs and the Graduate
Division will be there to discuss
the issue.
