## How High the Dew With Sprinklers On? BUG ME 
### 
Coming back from Green Library
- I'm getting drenched by one of our
wintery downpours - and the
sprinklers are on in front of Storey
House!!! I have noticed that this is
always occurring - the sprinklers go
on in various places no matter what
the weather or condition of the grass
and shrubs. Even when it's not
raining, the University seems to in
sist on watering already green grass
- just to be sure everything is greener
than green. Who is responsible for this
irrational, unnecessary and extrava
gant practice? And what can I, as an
individual, do to put pressure on the
University to stop this annoying
practice? Would petitions or a sit-in
in the Quad (no doubt to watch the
sprinklers there) help end these en
vironmentally irresponsible
atrocities? - Too Wet Behind the

First of all, you rely too much on
the dash for offsetting parenthetical
phrases and connecting related but
conceptually distinct clauses. Use
parentheses where they are obvi
ously justified, and let the semi
colon be your friend. The dash is
being overworked these days; it
needs a break.
Also: Don't you think you should
quit moaning and whining about
waste this and environment that? If
I were you, Mr. Smart Guy, I would
be counting my blessings that I live
in a country that is self-confident
and assertive enough to allow
people the luxury of wasting their
own water, freely, without being
hamstrung by knee-jerk goverment
interference.
Well, OK, now to answer your
question.
Herbert Fong, who is actually in
charge of the sprinkler system
here, says the lawn ir
rigation is minimized during the
rainy season. If the University
seems to be, like Pippi Longstock
ing, constantly watering the grass
during cloudbursts, that is a mis
taken impression.
This is not to deny that it hap
pens, but one should not conclude

Stanford is shipping water over
from Ethiopia during vicious
droughts to pour it on already
soggy lawns. Because, in fact,
sprinkler systems, like most engi
neering structures, fall prey to the
ravages of time; specifically, the
valves get clogged with dirt and
rocks and bugs if they are not fre
quently flushed.
It is more cost-effective, then, to
run the sprinklers occasionally
during the rainy season and thereby
avoid having to do major overhauls
and repair work each year when the
whole campus dries up like parch
ment.

Fong says the sprinklers are
set to gush for only a few minutes
per week in any given location
during the winter. Even during the
summer, they do not run more than
thrice weekly unless special cir
cumstances (such as newly seeded
lawns) mandate daily deluges.
If these assertions are not well
corroborated by your own observa--
tions, I can only offer my apologies
and suggest that you undertake to
keep scrupulously accurate records
of the activities of the sprinklers
you find interesting. Then you
might confront the University over
lords, who apparently are univer
sally understood to be evil, with
your incontrovertible evidence that
they waste water. Perhaps they
will be shamefaced, and repent.
On the other hand, they might
have their henchmen rough you up
a bit to keep you quiet.
