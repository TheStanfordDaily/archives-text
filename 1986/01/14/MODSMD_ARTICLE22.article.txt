## ''night Mother' Portrays Complexity of Suicide 
### NANCY HENRY Editorial Staff 
There is but one truly serious philosophical problem,
and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth
living amounts to answering the fundamental question of
philosophy. - Albert Camus

No less than the fundamental question of philosophy
is what playwright Marsha Norman raises in her
" 'night Mother," the 1983 Pulitzer Prize-winning play
showing now at San Francisco's American Conser
vatory Theatre. What Norman accomplishes is the
treatment of the philosophical question in an emotional,
poignantly human manner that brings to life the com
plicating personal element of the abstract problem,
without belittling the philosophical implications. The
current production at ACT illuminates the strengths
and the weaknesses of her play, as well as the
strengths and the weaknesses of an argument for
suicide.
The structure of " 'night Mother" is dramatically
solid, well suited to create an identity between actors
and audience, maintaining a tension in which the viewer
is unrelentlessly involved. Jessie Cates, played by
Elizabeth Huddle, is a woman in her late 30s who is
sick of the failures and the lack of control in her life.
After her divorce she moves back in with her mother,
Thelma, played by Marrian Walters, and into a situation
where she needn't talk to anyone or see anyone, a life
of routine, habit and lists interrupted only by her oc
casional epileptic seizures. A few minutes into the play,
we learn that Jessie has decided to commit suicide.
The remainder of the hour and 30-minute production
consists of Jessie's calm preparation for her death, a
preparation that includes a final confessional conversa
tion between mother and daughter in which both
women try to gain a perspective on their lives and in
which Jessie trys to justify her decision.
This scenerio of a private and intimate evening be
tween two people who love each other but hold radi
cally different views forces a dichotomy between our
intellectual opinions about suicide and our capacity for
sympathy and feeling. The emotional intensity is the
play's major triumph. The ironic weakness, however,
seems to be that this intensity, heightened by two very
strong performances by Huddle and Walters, is so
great — and the evocation of love and responsibility so
successful — that it undermines our sympathy with
Jessie's case for suicide, creating a rather uneven sit

uation that leaves Jessie seeming more cruel and self
pitying than hopelessly unhappy.
One reason for this is that Norman has Jessie ap
proach death with almost inhuman calm, reducing this
momentous decision to one of any number of things to
do — the last item to be checked off the metaphorical
list of life. Before "the act," she faces all of the trivial
responsibilities that compose her life, allowing her to
neglect the most profound — her reponsibility to those

whose life she touches and to society in general. She
feels compelled to provide only for her mother's physi
cal needs: order groceries, fill prescriptions, do the
laundry, write down phone numbers, leave a list of her
last requests. She performs these petty chores with
the greatest detail throughout the play, while simulta
neously trying to convey to her mother that it is
precisely the drudgery of such an existence that has
led her to renounce it. Thelma, a simple woman who

we eventually learn has led a mundane, unfulfilling life,
has resolved "not to think about it." She likes life,
though she's not sure why, and she is willing to do any
thing to keep her daughter alive. It is in the wrenching
sorrow and desperation of Thelma's protests and the
image of her after Jessie is gone, that the emotional
side of the suicide question — that of what our individ
ual responsibility is to those who love us as opposed to
our responsibility to ourselves — emerges stronger on
stage than the rational explanation Jessie offers for why
things have always gone wrong with her.
On the one hand, we can understand Jessie. Life for
her is meaningless. Her husband gone, her child turned
delinquent, the father she loved dead, the ever
present insecurity and humiliation of epilepsy — her
pleas to her mother for the right to determine her fate
are at times convincing. As Camus states in "The Myth
of Sisyphus," "Dying voluntarily implies that you have
recognized, even instinctively, the ridiculous character
of that habit, the Absence of any profound reason for
living, the insane character of that daily agitation, and
the uselessness of suffering."
In her own way, Jessie has come to this conclusion:
"I can't do anything either, about my life, to change it,
make it better, make me feel better about it. Like it
better, make it work. But I can stop it. Shut it down,
turn it off like the radio when there's nothing on I want
to listen to." Jessie's argument, philosophically speak
ing, has more intellectual content than her mother's.
She has reflected on her life, and in revolt against what
she has seen, decided to end it. This is the main differ
ence between Jessie and Thelma. Thelma's arguments
however, though simple ones, are compelling, and be
cause of the intimate moments on stage, her saying,
"I'm not like you, Jessie. I hate the quiet and I don't
want to die and I don't want you to go, Jessie," is more
moving than the strongest, most logical rationalization.
As Thelma, Walters effectively plays a strangely
comic-tragic figure. She is plain, her life is unexciting,
she never loved her husband and she has kept power
fully disturbing secrets within herself — for the sake of
her family — for years. Yet she is content. She does
not ask much of life, and she makes the most of what
she has. Walters is touchingly humorous in her honesty
and incomprehension of her daughter; she is appropri
ately extreme when the awful realization that Jessie is
serious hits. She and Huddle work well together,
though it is undoubtedly Huddle who has the more com
plex role. To make an argument for suicide sound con-

a tight and well-written play.

present insecurity and humiliation of epilepsy — her
pleas to her mother for the right to determine her fate
are at times convincing. As Camus states in "The Myth
of Sisyphus," "Dying voluntarily implies that you have
recognized, even instinctively, the ridiculous character
of that habit, the Absence of any profound reason for
living, the insane character of that daily agitation, and
the uselessness of suffering."
In her own way, Jessie has come to this conclusion:
"I can't do anything either, about my life, to change it,
make it better, make me feel better about it. Like it
better, make it work. But I can stop it. Shut it down,
turn it off like the radio when there's nothing on I want
to listen to." Jessie's argument, philosophically speak
ing, has more intellectual content than her mother's.
She has reflected on her life, and in revolt against what
she has seen, decided to end it. This is the main differ
ence between Jessie and Thelma. Thelma's arguments
however, though simple ones, are compelling, and be
cause of the intimate moments on stage, her saying,
"I'm not like you, Jessie. I hate the quiet and I don't
want to die and I don't want you to go, Jessie," is more
moving than the strongest, most logical rationalization.
As Thelma, Walters effectively plays a strangely
comic-tragic figure. She is plain, her life is unexciting,
she never loved her husband and she has kept power
fully disturbing secrets within herself — for the sake of
her family — for years. Yet she is content. She does
not ask much of life, and she makes the most of what
she has. Walters is touchingly humorous in her honesty
and incomprehension of her daughter; she is appropri
ately extreme when the awful realization that Jessie is
serious hits. She and Huddle work well together,

There is but one truly serious philosophical problem,
and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth
living amounts to answering the fundamental question of
philosophy. - Albert Camus

No less than the fundamental question of philosophy
is what playwright Marsha Norman raises in her
" 'night Mother," the 1983 Pulitzer Prize-winning play
showing now at San Francisco's American Conser
vatory Theatre. What Norman accomplishes is the
treatment of the philosophical question in an emotional,
poignantly human manner that brings to life the com
plicating personal element of the abstract problem,
without belittling the philosophical implications. The
current production at ACT illuminates the strengths
and the weaknesses of her play, as well as the
strengths and the weaknesses of an argument for
suicide.
The structure of " 'night Mother" is dramatically
solid, well suited to create an identity between actors
and audience, maintaining a tension in which the viewer
is unrelentlessly involved. Jessie Cates, played by
Elizabeth Huddle, is a woman in her late 30s who is
sick of the failures and the lack of control in her life.
After her divorce she moves back in with her mother,
Thelma, played by Marrian Walters, and into a situation
where she needn't talk to anyone or see anyone, a life
of routine, habit and lists interrupted only by her oc
casional epileptic seizures. A few minutes into the play,
we learn that Jessie has decided to commit suicide.
The remainder of the hour and 30-minute production
consists of Jessie's calm preparation for her death, a
preparation that includes a final confessional conversa
tion between mother and daughter in which both
women try to gain a perspective on their lives and in
which Jessie trys to justify her decision.
This scenerio of a private and intimate evening be
tween two people who love each other but hold radi
cally different views forces a dichotomy between our
intellectual opinions about suicide and our capacity for
sympathy and feeling. The emotional intensity is the
play's major triumph. The ironic weakness, however,
seems to be that this intensity, heightened by two very
strong performances by Huddle and Walters, is so
great — and the evocation of love and responsibility so
successful — that it undermines our sympathy with
Jessie's case for suicide, creating a rather uneven sit

uation that leaves Jessie seeming more cruel and self
pitying than hopelessly unhappy.
One reason for this is that Norman has Jessie ap
proach death with almost inhuman calm, reducing this
momentous decision to one of any number of things to
do — the last item to be checked off the metaphorical
list of life. Before "the act," she faces all of the trivial
responsibilities that compose her life, allowing her to
neglect the most profound — her reponsibility to those

whose life she touches and to society in general. She
feels compelled to provide only for her mother's physi
cal needs: order groceries, fill prescriptions, do the
laundry, write down phone numbers, leave a list of her
last requests. She performs these petty chores with
the greatest detail throughout the play, while simulta
neously trying to convey to her mother that it is
precisely the drudgery of such an existence that has
led her to renounce it. Thelma, a simple woman who

we eventually learn has led a mundane, unfulfilling life,
has resolved "not to think about it." She likes life,
though she's not sure why, and she is willing to do any
thing to keep her daughter alive. It is in the wrenching
sorrow and desperation of Thelma's protests and the
image of her after Jessie is gone, that the emotional
side of the suicide question — that of what our individ
ual responsibility is to those who love us as opposed to
our responsibility to ourselves — emerges stronger on
stage than the rational explanation Jessie offers for why
things have always gone wrong with her.
On the one hand, we can understand Jessie. Life for
her is meaningless. Her husband gone, her child turned
delinquent, the father she loved dead, the ever
present insecurity and humiliation of epilepsy — her
pleas to her mother for the right to determine her fate
are at times convincing. As Camus states in "The Myth
of Sisyphus," "Dying voluntarily implies that you have
recognized, even instinctively, the ridiculous character
of that habit, the Absence of any profound reason for
living, the insane character of that daily agitation, and
the uselessness of suffering."
