# Argentine Film Gives Disturbing 'Official Story'
## 
### DAVID WILLATS Staff writer 
Nineteen-eighty-five was a year marked
by a plethora of mediocre films, with a few
notable exceptions. Several of the best
films were movies with a message, from
the cold reality of abandoned children in
Streetwise," to Celie's self-assertion in
The Color Purple," to a recent Argentine
release, "The Official Story."
"The Official Story" chronicles the emer
gence of politcal awareness and social ac
tivism in a middle-aged Argentine woman.
Alicia (played with striking realism by
Norma Aleandro) teaches a prep-school
history class, is married to a wealthy
Buenos Aires executive and has a 5-
year-old adopted daughter. If she spoke
English, she could fit comfortably in Ameri
can suburbia. But she is not American
(North American, that is), and her sur

roundings do not insulate he* from the
harsh social reality of a country in turmoil.
The year is 1983, and all around her the
terrible injustices inflicted by the military
"junta," the ruling power since 1976, are
apparent. While in the past she might have
been able to protect herself through politi
cal ignorance, Alicia is now torn between her
leftist students' accounts of political vio
lence and her husband's staunch right-wing
stand. Her initial reaction to the students'
allegations is denial. If it is not documented
in the history books, then it must be fiction.
Her husband (Roberto, played by Hector
Alterio) suppresses her political question
ing with a kind of fatherly condescension.
What she doesn't know, he reasons, won't
hurt her.
Alicia's quest for social awareness begins
in ernest when an old friend, Ana
(Chunchuna Villatane) recounts her experi
ences in a military prison. In a particularly
moving scene, Ana describes her capture

(motivated by her association with a left
wing guerilla), and the subsequent years of
accusation and torture for crimes she didn't
commit. She also describes the common
practice of taking the very young children of
those tortured or killed and offering them
for adoption to Argentina's wealthy con
servatives. This sets the ball rolling for
Alicia. The possibility that the adoption of
her daughter could have been the result of
such a terrible inquisition forces her to ex
amine her own situation, and with a quiet
determination she begins to search for the
truth.
The central theme of this film is not one
of vindication or retribution, but of personal
responsibility. It is easy to place the blame
for Alicia's ignorance on Roberto, or for the
thousands of political deaths on the current
government, but the larger issue of self
control, on an individual, national or global
scale, is much more complex. Alicia's tur
moil is a metaphor for a nation in conflict, on

the verge of collapse because of a sudden
and somewhat unwanted self-awareness.
Where specifically does the conflict lie?
Throughout the film there is a dichotomy of
philosophies and ideals which grows as the
story develops. Roberto's insistence on the
need for progress ("The world moves
ahead and crushes those who watch the
clouds") contrasts sharply with Alicia's
movement toward more traditional human
values. Male-oriented, militaristic aggres
sion appears to be the cause of the national
strife, but Alicia's inaction is no less damag
ing than her husband's actions. Her quiet
support of her husband's activities (of which
she has little knowledge) implicates her
nearly as much as her husband. Although
Alicia's self-empowerment does not bring
her immediate happiness or solutions, it
does give her knowledge and the ability to
choose her own path through morality and
compassion.
There are some problems with "The Of

ficial Story." At times the division between
the masculine and feminine elements of so
ciety is over-simplified and unrealistic. For
those of you who don't speak the language,
there are scenes where you have to keep
your eyes glued to the subtitles at the bot
tom of the screen because the characters
are speaking so rapidly. But all in all this is a
very coherent and thoughful film. Norma
Leandro's performance is inspired, com
plex and subtle, and she never allows her
character the melodramatic concessions
that mar many "serious" movies. Director
Luis Puenzo affords us a very personal
view of Alicia's life. She is the main character
(she's in nearly every scene) and Puenzo
uses the camera to provide the audience a
subjective view of her experience. Her
early ignorance and confusion are ex
pressed in close, often claustrophobic
shots; later the shots are more open, but
the tone of the picture darkens, reflecting
her awareness of the tragedy.
