# 'Murphy's' is Simple Country Romance

### GEOFFREY MINTER Staff writer 
In "Murphy's Romance," Sally
Field plays Emma Moriarty, a
divorced woman who moves to
Arizona with her son to start life
over again. Soon after arriving,
Emma strikes up a relationship with
Murphy Jones (James Garner),
owner of the local drugstore. Trou
ble arises when Emma's ex
husband discovers where his wife is
living and tries to weed his way
back into her life.
The film, directed by Martin
Ritt, is a thematically vacuous but
pleasant piece of filmmaking that
looks like a better-than-average TV
inovie. "Murphy's Romance" is
about nothing, but it doesn't
pretend to be about anything. The
film is happy enough being a likable
love story. It's "Out of Africa" with
out the pretty scenery and without
delusions of making a grand state
ment.
The film begins slowly, and indi
cation is given early on that it will
turn into the type of farm picture
that was so popular a year ago. With
gritty determination on her face,
Emma drives her car through the
Arizona sunrise while, over the
soundtrack, we hear Carole King
singing about the essence of "What
It Means to be a Woman Living on
Her Own." Emma, son Jake (Corey

Haim) and car arrive on the new
property and, of course, the place
is a mess.
We get the obligatory scenes:
Emma and Jake refurbishing the
misshapen home, Emma telling Jake
to stop buying magazines because
the family budget can't support
such things, Emma being denied a
loan at the local bank because she's
a woman, and we soon think that

the film will become a sequel to
Field's "Places in the Heart."
Emma, because she's gritty, deter
mined and strong, will make her
horse-breeding farm a success, the
bank will be ashamed for underes
timating Emma's unique talents
and Jake will be allowed to buy all
the Sport's Illustrated's he wants to
for the rest of his life.
Fortunately, our expectations

are not met. Emma complains to
Murphy about the bank denying her
loan, and Murphy rattles off exam
ples of several other people in town
who are in worse condition. The
topic of Emma's battle against the
system is dropped here, and
Emma's horse-breeding farm
succeeds very soon afterwards.
The farm angle is just a red herring.
"Murphy's Romance" is really about

the relationship that develops be
tween Emma and Murphy and how
that relationship is threatened by
the appearance of Emma's ex
spouse Bobby Jack (Brian Kerwin).
There's nothing really new in this
love triangle, but the film holds our
attention because Field and Garner
make a good couple and because
Kerwin's character is such a lech
that we want the satisfaction of
seeing Field dump him again.
We're introduced to Bobby Jack
by a shot of his cowboy boots, and
we know instantly from the way the
boots are positioned that the guy's
a schmuck. When we finally see his
face (which has a perfect villian's
moustache) and hear his
drawl, we expect some kind
of slime to ooze from his pores.
When Emma indicates that she's
going to leave Bobby Jack alone
with their son, one gets the tempta
tion to yell "Don't do it!" Leaving a
young person alone with this guy is
tantamount to letting the
Boogeyman babysit your kids. Ritt
did a fine job of casting in this
role. Kerwin looks like a man with
no redeeming qualities whatsoever.
Garner gives a warm and wry
performance. He's at ease with his
wizened character, and we trust him.
It's kind of hard to imagine Field
in this laid back romantic role, espe
cially after her somewhat frenzied
performance in "Places in the
Heart," but she tries.


James Garner and Sally Field star in "Murphy's Romance," a simple, humorous love story.
