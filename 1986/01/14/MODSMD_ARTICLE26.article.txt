## Ducks Cook Cards' Goose 83-69 Hoopsters Surprised At Home 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Winning on the road in the Pacific
10 has proven to be verging on the
unthinkable, and playing Oregon,
the only winless team in the confer
ence and the preseason pick to
finish 10th, at home seemed about
as close to a breather as one's going
to get in this league.
Enter the fatigue factor. After
playing the usual Thursday-
Saturday series against Arizona and
Arizona State, the almighty Pac-10
schedule maker put a Monday game
against the Ducks on the Cardinal
slate. So, Stanford went out to play
its third game in five days, and
Stanford played like it, losing an 83-
69 decision to Oregon before 5,545
at Maples.
Stanford fell to 2-3 in Pac-10
play, good for 6th place in the con
ference. Oregon is now 1-3, tied for
Bth. Stanford is 8-9 overall,
while Oregon is 6-8.
"We were flat, tired, exhausted,"
Head Coach Tom Davis said. "I
have no idea why, but we were off
our game."
Let's look at why Oregon visited
Stanford on a Monday night. CBS
offered to televise a USC game

ticuffs.
with Arkansas on Jan. 25. USC was
to visit Stanford that day. So, in
stead of forcing USC to visit Maples
tonight after having also played two
games on the road, the Pac-10
brought Oregon south. The Ducks
only had one game this weekend —
Oregon State in Eugene.
The Stanford-USC game was
moved to March 1, when the
Stanford-Oregon game was to have
been played.
"There's no question it's tough to
play this game tonight," Davis said.
"To play this game tonight is
ridiculous. It was done to accom
modate TV. It's just ridiculous to
have to play tonight.
"When USC plays here, we've
got Oregon State here Thursday,
then USC Saturday afternoon.
They've got all week to get ready
for us. I think it was a mistake that
slipped by them. I think everyone's
aware of it. It put us at a tremen
dous disadvantage. We didn't need
it — we've got enough problems."
And they all caught up to the
Cardinal. Oregon ran off to a 22-9
lead en route to a 36-25 halftime
lead.
The Cardinal tried to come back,

making an 11-point run in a three
minute stretch to pull within seven
at 52-45 with 10:41 left. That run
followed an altercation between
Oregon's Jerry Adams and Stan
ford's Greg Butler that was quickly
broken up.
Then the Cardinal's foul shooting
went bad. Butler's second shot was
disqualified when Koberlein
stepped into the lane early. John
Paye missed a pair of underhand
tosses. Lichti missed the front end
of a one-and-one, as did Andy Fis
cher. With 3:36 left, an Oregon lead
that could have been cut to one was
still 66-58.
From there, the Cardinal could
come no closer. "At three this after
noon I knew they were flat," Davis
said. "I tried not to believe it, I
tried to talk them through it, but I
W knew when we were walking
through things that we were flat."
And the Ducks took full advan
tage. Guard Anthony Taylor — like
Stanford guard Terry Taylor,
wearing No. 21 — followed in the
footsteps of Arizona's Steve Kerr
and Arizona State's Steve Beck by
scoring 24 points to lead the
Oregon attack.
"Obviously we're elated to finally
get a Pac-10 win," said Oregon
Coach Don Monson, who is 5-0
against Stanford since he arrived in

Eugene. "We missed a few frecf
throws. For a minute it was begin
ning to look like Saturday night
(when the Ducks missed five front
ends of one-and-ones and went on
to lose to Oregon State), but then
we nailed them at the end. It's
probably a good thing to have this
game this early — we had some
things we needed to get out of our
system."
Shooting 65 percent from the
field and outrebounding Stanford
32-29 didn't hurt the Ducks either.
Lichti led Stanford with 15
points. Koberlein added 13 points
and eight rebounds. Terry Taylor
had 11 points and Keith Ramee
finished with 10.
The players weren't using the;
fatigue as an excuse, though. "We
were looking ahead to Cal and
UCLA, we came out flat," said cen
ter Howard Wright, who finished
with nine points. "Now I know why
coaches lose their hair and lose
their minds. The people in the
stands probably looked at us and
thought the games we won were
flukes."
"I wouldn't blame it on the trip,"
Koberlein said. "They came to
play. We might have taken them
lightly." :•

lightly." :•
Winning on the road in the Pacific
10 has proven to be verging on the
unthinkable, and playing Oregon,
the only winless team in the confer
ence and the preseason pick to
finish 10th, at home seemed about
as close to a breather as one's going
to get in this league.
Enter the fatigue factor. After
playing the usual Thursday-
Saturday series against Arizona and
Arizona State, the almighty Pac-10
schedule maker put a Monday game
against the Ducks on the Cardinal
slate. So, Stanford went out to play
its third game in five days, and
Stanford played like it, losing an 83-
69 decision to Oregon before 5,545
at Maples.
Stanford fell to 2-3 in Pac-10
play, good for 6th place in the con
ference. Oregon is now 1-3, tied for
Bth. Stanford is 8-9 overall,
while Oregon is 6-8.
"We were flat, tired, exhausted,"
Head Coach Tom Davis said. "I
have no idea why, but we were off
our game."
Let's look at why Oregon visited
Stanford on a Monday night. CBS
offered to televise a USC game

ticuffs.
with Arkansas on Jan. 25. USC was
to visit Stanford that day. So, in
stead of forcing USC to visit Maples
tonight after having also played two
games on the road, the Pac-10
brought Oregon south. The Ducks
only had one game this weekend —
Oregon State in Eugene.
The Stanford-USC game was
moved to March 1, when the
Stanford-Oregon game was to have
been played.
"There's no question it's tough to
play this game tonight," Davis said.
"To play this game tonight is
ridiculous. It was done to accom
modate TV. It's just ridiculous to
have to play tonight.
"When USC plays here, we've
got Oregon State here Thursday,
then USC Saturday afternoon.
They've got all week to get ready
for us. I think it was a mistake that
slipped by them. I think everyone's
aware of it. It put us at a tremen
dous disadvantage. We didn't need
it — we've got enough problems."
And they all caught up to the
Cardinal. Oregon ran off to a 22-9
lead en route to a 36-25 halftime
lead.
The Cardinal tried to come back,

making an 11-point run in a three
minute stretch to pull within seven
at 52-45 with 10:41 left. That run
followed an altercation between
Oregon's Jerry Adams and Stan
ford's Greg Butler that was quickly
broken up.
Then the Cardinal's foul shooting
went bad. Butler's second shot was
disqualified when Koberlein
stepped into the lane early. John
Paye missed a pair of underhand
tosses. Lichti missed the front end
of a one-and-one, as did Andy Fis
cher. With 3:36 left, an Oregon lead
that could have been cut to one was
still 66-58.
From there, the Cardinal could
come no closer. "At three this after
noon I knew they were flat," Davis
said. "I tried not to believe it, I
tried to talk them through it, but I
W knew when we were walking
through things that we were flat."
And the Ducks took full advan
tage. Guard Anthony Taylor — like
Stanford guard Terry Taylor,
wearing No. 21 — followed in the
footsteps of Arizona's Steve Kerr
and Arizona State's Steve Beck by
scoring 24 points to lead the
Oregon attack.
"Obviously we're elated to finally
get a Pac-10 win," said Oregon
Coach Don Monson, who is 5-0
against Stanford since he arrived in

Eugene. "We missed a few frecf
throws. For a minute it was begin
ning to look like Saturday night
(when the Ducks missed five front
ends of one-and-ones and went on
to lose to Oregon State), but then
we nailed them at the end. It's
probably a good thing to have this
game this early — we had some
things we needed to get out of our
system."
Shooting 65 percent from the
field and outrebounding Stanford
32-29 didn't hurt the Ducks either.
Lichti led Stanford with 15
points. Koberlein added 13 points
and eight rebounds. Terry Taylor
had 11 points and Keith Ramee
finished with 10.
The players weren't using the;
fatigue as an excuse, though. "We
were looking ahead to Cal and
UCLA, we came out flat," said cen
ter Howard Wright, who finished
with nine points. "Now I know why
coaches lose their hair and lose
their minds. The people in the
stands probably looked at us and
thought the games we won were
flukes."
"I wouldn't blame it on the trip,"
Koberlein said. "They came to
play. We might have taken them
lightly." :•
