## Ducks Cook Cards' Goose 83-69 Hoopsters Surprised At Home 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Winning on the road in the Pacific
10 has proven to be verging on the
unthinkable, and playing Oregon,
the only winless team in the confer
ence and the preseason pick to
finish 10th, at home seemed about
as close to a breather as one's going
to get in this league.
Enter the fatigue factor. After
playing the usual Thursday-
Saturday series against Arizona and
Arizona State, the almighty Pac-10
schedule maker put a Monday game
against the Ducks on the Cardinal
slate. So, Stanford went out to play
its third game in five days, and
Stanford played like it, losing an 83-
69 decision to Oregon before 5,545
at Maples.
Stanford fell to 2-3 in Pac-10
play, good for 6th place in the con
ference. Oregon is now 1-3, tied for
Bth. Stanford is 8-9 overall,
while Oregon is 6-8.
"We were flat, tired, exhausted,"
Head Coach Tom Davis said. "I
have no idea why, but we were off
our game."
Let's look at why Oregon visited
Stanford on a Monday night. CBS
offered to televise a USC game
