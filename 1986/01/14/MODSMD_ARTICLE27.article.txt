### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
As Sue Sebolt and Evon Asforis go, so goes the
Stanford women's basketball team.
Or so it seems.
Saturday night, both Sebolt and Asforis, account
ing only for three of Stanford's 57 points, pleaded
lethargy in the Cardinal's lethargic 11-point loss to
the Fullerton State Titans.
Last night at Maples Pavilion, the rejuvenated for
ward duo combined for a total of 27 points in Stan
ford's spirited 77-65 win over the 10-5 University of
Utah Utes.
Asforis helped the Cardinal settle the issue early
in the first half.
Behind 6-4 in the opening minutes, Stanford
scored nine unanswered points to take a comforta
ble 13-6 advantage, a lead that they would never
relinquish. Asforis scored seven of her 11 points
during this scoring barrage.

By halftime, Stanford had extended its lead to 41-
30 behind Sebolt's eight points and a scrambling
pressure defense that forced 11 Utah miscues.
"We wanted to pressure their guards in order to
create turnovers," Head Coach Tara VanDerveer
said. "We were hoping to cut off passing lanes to
their inside people."
In the second half, the Lady Utes were able to cut
the deficit to five at 51-46 with 12:30 remaining, but
after a pair of Sebolt baseline jumpers and Kami An
derson high-arching rainbow jumpers, the Cardinal
again led comfortably, 59-46.
Sebolt came off the bench to lead all scorers with
16 points. Anderson finished with 14 points for the
Cardinal (10-5).
Coming off a lifeless effort against Fullerton
State, VanDerveer was pleased with Stanford's ag
gressiveness.
"Our intensity was good," she said. "But we're
capable of being much more aggressive. We wanted
to run on them a lot and, for the most part, I think
we did."
