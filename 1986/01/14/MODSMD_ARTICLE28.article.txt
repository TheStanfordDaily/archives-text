# NCAA Votes To Stiffen Standards for Athletes
## 
### 
NEW ORLEANS — The Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion approved its most sweeping
set of academic rules for new col
lege athletes yesterday, but only
after temporarily lowering the
standards slightly in hopes that
more than half of all black athletes
will not be excluded from playing.
The college presidents who
sponsored the new rules say they
will prevent colleges from recruit
ing athletes who have almost no
chance of earning a degree. But the
opponents, led by the heads of the
predominantly black colleges, say
the standards will create
"apartheid" in American higher
education by barring many black
students who go to college on
sports scholarships.
As first approved by the NCAA
in 1983, students entering school
next fall would have needed a 700

out of 1,600 on the Scholastic Apti
tude Test or a 15 out of 36 on the
American College Test to be eligi
ble for intercollegiate athletics. In
addition, a student would need a 2.0
grade average in 11 academic
courses. Previously, a student
needed only a 2.0 high school grade
average, in any set of courses, to
be eligible for an athletic scholar
ship.
Though viewed as a minimal
standard, NCAA studies showed
the new requirement would elimi
nate more than half of black athletes
and about one-fourth of whites.
Yesterday, the college presidents
modified the plan. This fall, an en
tering student could have a score as
low as 660 on the SAT and have a
grade average as low as 1.8 on a
4.0 scale. Next year, the min
imums would rise to 680 and 1.9,
before returning to the original rule

in 1988.
"This will provide us with a little
time for the core curriculum to be
effective," said NCAA President
John Davis of Oregon State Univer
sity, after the compromise was ap
proved by a 2-1 margin.
College board scores, especially
for black students, have been
inching upward, Heyman said, so
more students will likely meet the
standard than is now believed.
Neverthless, based on
transcripts of college athletes who
entered school in 1982, the NCAA
says only 59 percent of black male
athletes and 93 percent of white
males would have qualified with
SAT scores above 660.
Before yesterrday's final vote,
black college leaders threatened to
file suit against the rules if ap
proved.
