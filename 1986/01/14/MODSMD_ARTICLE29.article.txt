# Big Crowd Let Down by a Flat Team
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
Stanford Basketball Coach Tom
Davis' first concern after last
nights embarrassing 83-69 loss to
Pacific 10 Conference doormat
Oregon was the reaction of the

Maples Pavilion fans.
"It's a crying shame that we
could play so well in our two games
in Arizona (on Thursday and Satur
day) and then come here in front of
a really good crowd and play like
this, .said; "{The players) wete
flat, tired, exhausted. I have no
idea myself how we could be so far

off our game.
"Oregon played a great, great
game. I wish we had played as well,
for the sake of the crowd."
The game was the first confer
ence matchup in Maples since the
students -returned for winter quar-
ter, and the crowd of 5,545
stomped and clapped and shouted
lustily as the Cardinal mounted a
second-half rally that moved it from
a 19-point deficit to within six. But
just when the Ducks were playing
scared and the noise was at its high
est, Stanford gave the game away
on the foul line.
From the 6:39 mark of the
second half, when the score was
62-55, to the 2:31 mark, when
Oregon had increased the margin to
70-60, the Cardinal made only one
of seven foul shots. And three of
those misses were the front end of
one-on-ones.
Davis put part of the blame on
Stanford's tough schedule, which
forced it to play three games in five
days.
"We just hit the wall tonight," he
said. "You get exhausted when you
go through a period like that, and it
affects your free throw shooting,

your outside shooting and every
thing else."
Cardinal guard Keith Ramee,
who finished with 10 points and six
assists, promised that the poor foul
line performance was not a charac
teristic of this team.
"Never again, if you pick three or
four guys on our team, no matter
how late in the game, they're not
going to miss those foul shots,"
Ramee said.
Davis sensed there was some
thing wrong with his team long
before the start of the game.
"I knew at three this afternoon
that we were flat," he said. "I tried
not to believe it, and I tried talking
to them, but they were flat. They
were slow coming into a huddle out
on the floor, and when we were sit
ting in the video room watching
films it was like everyone was
asleep.
"And then out on the floor
tonight we were dropping the ball,
fumbling it, and it would take us
forever to make three or four
passes," he continued. "I think

sometimes they forget they don't
have Steve Brown, they don't have
Novian Whitsitt."
Both the players and the crowd
woke up after a scuffle under the
basket with 15:00 left in the second
half, when Stanford trailed by 16.
The crowd began to have an effect
on the game from that point on,
particularly when Oregon players
stepped to the foul line. The stu
dents sitting in the front row dis
rupted the Duck shots by jumping
up and down, literally rocking the
Maples Pavilion floor.
"I told one official, if you think
this is bad, there are other arenas
in the Pac-10 where the fans are
dumping things on you, swearing at
you," Davis said. "I think those
things (foul shot distractions) are in
the head of the opponent, and if that
affects them, well. . . .
"Our crowd can really help us,"
he concluded. "I don't think there's
any question there's a correlation
between our performance and the
student body getting into the
game."
