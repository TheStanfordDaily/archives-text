## Some Consider Chicago To Be Shoe-in, But Patriots Haven't Surrendered Yet 
### 
NEW ORLEANS (AP) — It's
starting out as the Why Bother
Super Bowl. As in, why bother to
play it when the National Football
League could just as easily declare
the Chicago Bears the champion?
No sooner had the New England
Patriots followed Chicago's 24-0
shutout of the Los Angeles Rams
by upsetting the Miami Dolphins 31-
14 Sunday than the predictions
about the Jan. 26 title game in New
Orleans started rolling in.
Sixteen-three Bears, "in a very
boring game," predicted a Miami
television analyst. Twenty-four
seven Bears predicted a respected
national football writer.
That may be a bit premature,
particularly since for only the third
time in 20 years, both teams are
playing in their first Super Bowls, a
particularly disorienting experience
for a lot of players.
The Bears, 15-1 in the regular
season, have long since been
anointed as the NFL's best team.
They solidified that position by be
coming the first team ever to regis
ter two straight shutouts in the
playoffs — 21-0 over the New York
Giants, then Sunday's whitewash of
the Rams.
But while everyone's been
eyeing the Bears, the Patriots have
quietly snuck up on people, winning
12 of their last 14, including three
road victories in the playoffs.
Their only losses in the last three
months were by 16-13 to the New
York Jets in overtime and 30-27 in
Miami, losses they avenged in the
playoffs.
They beat the Raiders at the Los
Angeles Coliseum a week ago, then
ended an eight-game Miami winning
streak and their own 18-game

losing streak at the Orange Bowl —
giving them quality road victories
over quality teams in games in
which their season was on the line.
"Jimmy The Greek will give us
no chance," New England running

back Craig James said after Sun
day's game, talking about the tele
vision pundit. "Last week, when we
played the Raiders, Lester Hayes
said 'two chances, slim and none.' I
hope Jimmy the Greek picks us to
lose by 15."

For Super Bowl betting, see page 10.

In fact, with a few exceptions,
the Pats match up pretty well with
the Bears, who beat them 20-7 in
Chicago the second week of the
season. But that game came when
New England Coach Raymond
Berry was still experimenting with
his lineup.
Even if they don't play a flashy
defense like the Bears' "46;" even
if they don't have Refrigerators and
punk quarterbacks; even if they
have no rock videos, they still do a
lot of the same things — like force
turnovers. New England is one of
the few NFL teams that practice
recovering fumbles and it shows.
In their three playoff wins, the
Pats took the ball away from three
good teams 16 times and coughed it

up just five, a ratio that if projected
over a full season would be an as
tounding plus-60. The Bears led the
NFL this year with a plus-23 ratio.
"I think in order to beat the
Bears, New England has got to
keep doing what it's been doing and
that's causing a lot of turnovers,"
says Miami Coach Don Shula,
whose team handed Chicago its
only loss because Dan Marino was
able to beat the pass rush and pick
apart their secondary.
"The Bears are an outstanding
defensive team. They're not going
to let a team run on them like New
England ran on us."
True enough.
The Patriots, who ran for 255
yards on the Dolphins Sunday,
were held to just 27 in their Sep
tember game in Chicago and the
Bears limited Eric Dickerson and

the Rams to 86. In fact, Los An
geles was held to just nine first
downs and 130 yards overall.
But the Patriots also have one of
the NFL's best offensive lines,
anchored on the left side by guard
John Hannah, an all-time All-Pro
and tackle Brian Holloway, a
Stanford alumnus who's been se
lected for three Pro Bowls in five
seasons. If they protect Tony
Eason as well as the Los Angeles
line protected Dieter Brock Sunday
(three sacks), Eason should be able
to do more than Brock's 10 of 31 for
66 yards, particularly in the wind
less New Orleans Superdome.
The New England defense,

anchored by outside linebackers
Andre Tippett and Don Blackmon,

conerback Raymond Claybom and
free safety Fred Marion, isn't as in
timidating as the Bears. But it
compares well to the solid defenses
of the Giants and Rams.

This is not to say New England
will win or even keep it close.
While Eason throws better than
Brock, his lack of experience could
well be the difference.

hope Jimmy the Greek picks us to
lose by 15."

In fact, with a few exceptions,
the Pats match up pretty well with
the Bears, who beat them 20-7 in
Chicago the second week of the
season. But that game came when
New England Coach Raymond
Berry was still experimenting with
his lineup.
Even if they don't play a flashy
defense like the Bears' "46;" even
if they don't have Refrigerators and
punk quarterbacks; even if they
have no rock videos, they still do a
lot of the same things — like force
turnovers. New England is one of
the few NFL teams that practice
recovering fumbles and it shows.
In their three playoff wins, the
Pats took the ball away from three
good teams 16 times and coughed it

up just five, a ratio that if projected
over a full season would be an as
tounding plus-60. The Bears led the
NFL this year with a plus-23 ratio.
"I think in order to beat the
Bears, New England has got to
keep doing what it's been doing and
that's causing a lot of turnovers,"
says Miami Coach Don Shula,
whose team handed Chicago its
only loss because Dan Marino was
able to beat the pass rush and pick
apart their secondary.
"The Bears are an outstanding
defensive team. They're not going
to let a team run on them like New
England ran on us."
True enough.
The Patriots, who ran for 255
yards on the Dolphins Sunday,
were held to just 27 in their Sep
tember game in Chicago and the
Bears limited Eric Dickerson and

the Rams to 86. In fact, Los An
geles was held to just nine first
downs and 130 yards overall.
But the Patriots also have one of
the NFL's best offensive lines,
anchored on the left side by guard
John Hannah, an all-time All-Pro
and tackle Brian Holloway, a
Stanford alumnus who's been se
lected for three Pro Bowls in five
seasons. If they protect Tony
Eason as well as the Los Angeles
line protected Dieter Brock Sunday
(three sacks), Eason should be able
to do more than Brock's 10 of 31 for
66 yards, particularly in the wind
less New Orleans Superdome.
The New England defense,

anchored by outside linebackers
Andre Tippett and Don Blackmon,

conerback Raymond Claybom and
free safety Fred Marion, isn't as in
timidating as the Bears. But it
compares well to the solid defenses
of the Giants and Rams.

This is not to say New England
will win or even keep it close.
While Eason throws better than
Brock, his lack of experience could
well be the difference.
NEW ORLEANS (AP) — It's
starting out as the Why Bother
Super Bowl. As in, why bother to
play it when the National Football
League could just as easily declare
the Chicago Bears the champion?
No sooner had the New England
Patriots followed Chicago's 24-0
shutout of the Los Angeles Rams
by upsetting the Miami Dolphins 31-
14 Sunday than the predictions
about the Jan. 26 title game in New
Orleans started rolling in.
Sixteen-three Bears, "in a very
boring game," predicted a Miami
television analyst. Twenty-four
seven Bears predicted a respected
national football writer.
That may be a bit premature,
particularly since for only the third
time in 20 years, both teams are
playing in their first Super Bowls, a
particularly disorienting experience
for a lot of players.
The Bears, 15-1 in the regular
season, have long since been
anointed as the NFL's best team.
They solidified that position by be
coming the first team ever to regis
ter two straight shutouts in the
playoffs — 21-0 over the New York
Giants, then Sunday's whitewash of
the Rams.
But while everyone's been
eyeing the Bears, the Patriots have
quietly snuck up on people, winning
12 of their last 14, including three
road victories in the playoffs.
Their only losses in the last three
months were by 16-13 to the New
York Jets in overtime and 30-27 in
Miami, losses they avenged in the
playoffs.
They beat the Raiders at the Los
Angeles Coliseum a week ago, then
ended an eight-game Miami winning
streak and their own 18-game

losing streak at the Orange Bowl —
giving them quality road victories
over quality teams in games in
which their season was on the line.
"Jimmy The Greek will give us
no chance," New England running

back Craig James said after Sun
day's game, talking about the tele
vision pundit. "Last week, when we
played the Raiders, Lester Hayes
said 'two chances, slim and none.' I
hope Jimmy the Greek picks us to
lose by 15."
