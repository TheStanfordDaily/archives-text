# Super Bowl Betting: A Bonanza or a Bust?
## 
### 
LAS VEGAS (AP) — There is disagreement among
oddsmakers at Nevada's sports books about the Super
Bowl Game.
Not about the point-spread — the Chicago Bears
were a solid 10-point favorite yesterday — but rather
on the impact the New England Patriots would have on
betting action.
"I think we will be in the vicinity of $45 million,"
Sonny Reizner predicted of betting totals at the state's
34 legal sports books. Should his prediction be fulfilled,
it will be the heaviest-bet Super Bowl of all time.
"It looks like a dud," countered Jimmy Vaccaro of
the MGM Grand Hotel Sports Book, who predicted a
bet total under $30 million."I venture to guess there'll
be a 25 percent cut in our share of the Super Bowl
_ ' 99
pie.
Last year's Super Bowl between the San Francisco
49ers and the Miami Dolphins drew nearly $40 million
at Nevada books, the only place in the country where
sports betting is legal. That handle was a record.

Oddsmakers said two weeks ago a Chicago-Miami
matchup would have been a winner while a Chicago-
New England game would cut substantially into the
betting action.
Reizner, the long-time oddsmaker at the Castaways
Sports Book, repeated that view, saying a Dolphin win
Sunday would have meant an additional $5 million in
betting action.
"Chicago people are much more geared toward big
betting than people from New England," Reizner said,
noting heavy early action on the Bears. "The Patriots
don't figure to draw much money from their area."
One thing that may attract Patriots money is that
"they've covered the spread the last 13 or 14 times
this season," Reizner said. "If you had bet on the
Patriots the last 13 times, you would have won every
bet. And they seem to be a Cinderella team."
Art Manteris, oddsmaker at the Caesars Palace
Sports Book, predicted the point spread would remain
between 10 and 11 until the game.
