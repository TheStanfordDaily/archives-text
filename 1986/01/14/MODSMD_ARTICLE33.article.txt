After jumping out to an early
2-1 lead behind a pair of goals by
senior forward John Zierk, the
Stanford ice hockey team was
victimized by three unanswered
second-period goals from UC-
Berkeley. The Cardinal fell to
the Bears by a final score of 5-3
in Berkeley Sunday night.
With the loss, the Cardinal's
record dropped to 3-6-1. In an
earlier meeting with its Pacific
Intercollegiate Hockey Confer
ence rival, Stanford fell to Cal by
a score of 6-3.
The momentum shifted late in
the second period when Stanford
failed to capitalize on a two-man
advantage. Berkeley then
scored twice in the last four
minutes of the period to pull
ahead bv two goals. Stanford's

senior forward Danny Ammon
tightened the game up 10
seconds into the third period
when he outskated a Cal defen
seman and slipped the puck into
the net. But the Cardinal could
not close the gap further.
"All in all I'm satisfied with the
results," Player-Coach Burke
Thornton said. "We're coming
closer and we've got three more
shots at them in the next three
weekends."
Stanford takes to the ice in
two home games this weekend,
the first against Reno at the Ice
Capades Chalet in Cupertino
Saturday at 5:15 p.m. That
matchup will be followed by a
crucial contest Sunday against
the Bears at 8:30 p.m. at the
Belmont Iceland.
