Judge Bars Mandela From Home
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — A justice of the South African
Supreme Court yesterday upheld a government order that bars black
nationalist leader Winnie Mandela from living in her Soweto home
outside Johannesburg and prohibits her from taking part in any politi
cal activity.
Justice L.J. le Grange sidestepped the major legal issues raised in
Mandela's lawsuit objecting to the Dec. 21 order evicting her from
her home and instead passed the case to the full tribunal by giving
her permission to appeal his decision, acknowledging that "the per
sonal freedom of an individual is an important principle."
The decision raises the important political question of what tactics
Mandela, wife of the imprisoned African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, will adopt next in her challenge to the minority
white government of President Pieter Botha.
She has tentatively ruled out a defiant return to Soweto — she
was arrested twice for doing so and could be jailed for up to six years
if convicted of these violations of her "banning" order — but accord
ing to friends she is considering other ways to flout the government's
authority.
In Cape Town, meanwhile, Chester Crocker, the assistant U.S.
secretary of state for African affairs, gave Botha a letter from Presi
dent Reagan on the situation in South Africa and developments in the
southern African region as a whole in what many diplomats took as
the final U.S. attempt to salvage the Reagan Administration's policy
of "constructive engagement" with the minority white regime here.
MIAs May Be Alive in Indochina
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administration presumes that
American soldiers still may be alive in Indochina as long as it cannot
disprove all the reports it has received from refugees, mercenaries
and others claiming that GIs have been spotted under communist
control, a top Pentagon official said yesterday.
Asst. Defense Secretary Richard Armitage said that intelligence
officials had investigated more than 800 reports of live Americans in
Vietnam, Laos or Cambodia over the last 10 years and have been
unable to turn up information that would dismiss at least 95 of them.
Thus, he said in an interview on ABC's "Good Morning America,"
"The Administration acts under the assumption that at least some
Americans are held against their will."
However, in a later briefing at the Pentagon, Armitage acknowl
edged that he had no firm evidence that Americans still were living in
Indochina, either willingly or as prisoners. Some of the 95 active
cases date back to 1975, and no alleged sightings had occurred in any
of these since 1983, he said.
The remains of nearly 2,500 Americans missing in action from the
Vietnam War years have yet to be recovered, although Defense De
partment officials consider almost all of them to be dead. The Admin
istration, caught between the lack of definitive data on MIAs and the
unsubstantiated conviction of many conservative supporters that
Americans are being held prisoner, sometimes has tried to downplay
the reports and other times acknowledged their potential validity.
Egypt Welcomes Israeli Move
CAIRO, Egypt — Egyptian officials welcomed Israel's decision
yesterday to submit a festering border dispute to binding arbitration,
but they cautioned that more negotiations will be necessary before
bilateral relations can improve.
"There will have to be more negotiations. What we have is not a
final agreement, but an agreed framework under which a lot of
details will now have to be worked out," a source close to the
negotiations said of the new 14-point Israeli plan for resolving major
differences between the two countries.
However, the source added that, based on initial reports of the
proposal, the prospects for improving Egyptian-Israeli relations
looked "positive."
Government and diplomatic sources here and in Jerusalem agreed
that Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak could start a new phase in bilateral relations with a
summit meeting as soon as next month.
U.S. Sends Troops to Honduras
CAMP BIG BEAR, Honduras — Tfie first of 5,000 U.S. National
Guardsmen, most of them combat engineers and heavy-equipment
operators, have arrived for four months of military maneuvers and
construction work aimed at stabilizing a main U.S. ally in Central
America.
A U. S. military officer told reporters that they will work on devel
opment projects aimed at countering Nicaragua, and that if they fail,
"We're going to have to send our kids down here with guns."
Under conditions set for the news conference, the military official
could not be identified.
Rival Christian Militias Clash
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Rival Christian militiamen yesterday battled
for control of strategic routes north and east of the capital as Presi
dent Amin Gemayel flew to Damascus for critical talks on the fate of
a Syrian-sponsored reform package aimed at ending the country's
10-year-old civil war.
At least 12 persons were killed and dozens wounded in the fight
ing, the worst in Christian areas this year.
At daybreak, the Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia,
launched a multi-pronged attack against Phalangist rivals that in
volved several districts of east Beirut. Banks and schools closed and
thousands of students and office workers were stranded by the fight
ing.
U.S. Embassy Calls Terror Alert
AMSTERDAM, Netherlands — U.S. diplomats began a tefror
alert telephone campaign yesterday, calling the 10,000 Americans in
the Netherlands to warn them of possible terrorist acts against U.S.
interests here.
"We call the larger concentrations of Americans, a firm or a school
for Americans, and we let them know, and they let other people
know," said spokesman Sam Wunder at the U.S. Embassy in The
Hague.
The telephone campaign by personnel at the embassy and at the
American consulates in Amsterdam and Rotterdam was spawned by
a Palestinian terrorist alert declared by the Dutch government.
