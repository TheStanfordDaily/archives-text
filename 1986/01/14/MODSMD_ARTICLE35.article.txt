# Administration Foresees Deep Budget Cuts
## Gramm-Rudman may force layoffs, law enforcement cutbacks 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administra
tion, faced with the need to trim $11.7 billion
from this year's budget, is contemplating cuts
that include laying off some federal employees
one or two days a week, leaving thousands of
jobs vacant and scaling back crucial law enforce
ment programs, the White House announced
yesterday.
To comply with the Gramm-Rudman budget
balancing measure enacted by Congress last
month, most domestic programs will be have to
be cut uniformly by 4.3 percent as of March 1,
according to the White House. And the Defense
Department will have to impose a 4.9 percent
reduction, the White House said.
Federal officials acknowledged widespread
confusion over how to impose equal cutbacks on
every program in the domestic budget except
for Social Security, welfare benefits and the
handful of others that Congress specifically ex
empted from the Gramm-Rudman act.
And they pointed out that the cuts required for
this year will probably appear modest next to
those in store for 1987. If Congress and the

White House fail to agree on at least $50 billion
worth of deficit reductions for that year, the
Gramm-Rudman act will require another round
of across-the-board spending cuts to make up
the difference.
"This year is only a hint of what is to come,"
said an official of Congress' General Accounting
Office. "It's going to be painful for everybody."
The Customs Service, for example, is already
planning to let several hundred vacancies go un
filled for the rest of this fiscal year, even though
Congress called only last month for beefing up
Customs' efforts to curb drug smuggling.
And some agencies are looking at furloughs of
as many as one or two days a week to trim costs,
a congressional official said. Likewise, grant and
benefit programs will have to be sliced by 4.3
percent.
Some government beneficiaries have already
begun to feel the effects of the balanced budget
measure. Under Gramm-Rudman, the govern
ment will save $1.4 billion by denying retired
federal civilian and military workers and
recipients of black-lung benefits the 3 percent in

flation adjustments they would have been en
titled to under current law.
Programs sheltered from cuts, besides Social
Security, include most anti-poverty programs,
two veterans' programs and interest on the na
tional debt. In addition, the law limits to 1 per
cent the amount that can be cut in 1986 from
Medicare and other health benefits for veterans,
Indians and migrant workers.
The president's Office of Management and
Budget and the Congressional Budget Office will
jointly announce details of the 1986 cuts tomor
row. The Gramm-Rudman act limits the 1986
cuts to $11.7 billion even if, as expected, OMB
and CBO estimate that the deficit will reach
about $220 billion, far beyond Gramm-Rudman's
$171.9 billion target.
With $1.4 billion already saved by eliminating
some cost-of-living benefit adjustments, the
remaining $10.3 billion is divided equally be
tween domestic programs and defense. OMB
and CBO calculated the 4.3 percent cut for
domestic outlays by dividing about $5.2 billion in
cutback i~-ong all non-exempt programs.
