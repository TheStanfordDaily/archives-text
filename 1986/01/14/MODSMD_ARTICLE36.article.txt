# U.S. Softens Stance on Boarding of Ship
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Although the
Iranian navy may have been acting
within the traditional rights of a na
tion at war when it boarded an
American cargo ship in the Gulf of
Oman, such searches for weapons
raise the risk of misunderstandings
"and even violence," the chief
White House spokesman said yes
terday.
The Reagan Administration was
muted in its criticism of the Iranian
action Sunday, and the lawyer for
American President Lines, owners
of the ship, accused the Administra
tion of "backing around" the ques
tion of whether the Iranians acted
legally.
The Navy sent two warships to
the assistance of the merchant ves
sel, the President Taylor, a 22,000-
ton bulk cargo carrier. But, a Pent
agon spokesman said, the incident
was over and the Iranians, search
ing for weapons and other supplies
destined for Iraq, "were long gone
before our vessels got to the
scene."

The ships were identified by a
Navy source as the USS Conolly, a
destroyer, and the USS Boone, a
guided missile frigate. They arrived
in the region Sunday afternoon after
passing through the Strait of Hor
muz from the Persian Gulf.
They remained on station in the

region yesterday, just beyond the
strait, the source said, speaking on
the condition he not be further iden
tified.
The Reagan Administration was
initially sharp in its criticism, with
White House spokesman Larry
Speakes describing the situation as

"volatile." But by mid-afternoon, in
apparently coordinated statements,
he and State Department spokes
man Bernard Kalb presented the
Iranian action in less strident
terms.
Speakes observed that for five
months, Iran has been searching
neutral ships in the Persian Gulf,
stopping vessels from Kuwait,
Italy, West Germany, Denmark,
Yugoslavia, Poland and Japan. Sun
day's search was the first naval inci
dent involving a U.S. merchant ves
sel in the five-year-old war between
Iran and Iraq.
"The rules of naval warfare have
traditionally accorded a belligerent
certain rights to ascertain whether
neutral shipping is being used to
provide contraband to an opposing
belligerent," Speakes said.
But, he said, "We consider the
Iranian policy of stopping and
searching neutral shipping in the
gulf region to be one of the signifi
cant consequences created by the
Iran-Iraq war.
