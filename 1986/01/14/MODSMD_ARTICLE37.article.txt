Clerics Rip Apartheid
WASHINGTON — Leaders of the nation's
major Protestant, Roman Catholic and Or
thodox churches decided yesterday to organ
ize a coordinated anti-apartheid campaign com
parable to their previous drives for civil rights
in the 1960s and against the Vietnam War in
the 19705.
The group, to be known as the Churches
Emergency Committee on South Africa,
pledged to press for comprehensive govern
ment economic sanctions, divestiture of U.S.
investments, buying campaigns against those
U.S. companies that refuse to divest and an
end to continued bank credit for the South
African government.
"This is an historic gathering," said the Rev.
Lorenzo Shepard, president of the Progres
sive National Baptist Church. "It is an emer
gency gathering. We can no longer stand idly
by and allow our government to casually throw
away a moral prerogative that it can exercise."
The group includes 24 major churches and
12 interchurch agencies spanning the political
spectrum from liberal to conservative, but ex
cluding some fundamentalist churches. Among
those who pledged to participate are the
Roman Catholic Church, the Presbyterian
Chruch, the United Methodist Church, the
Episcopal Church, several Luthern denomina

tions, the Southern Baptists, the African
Methodist Episcopal and the Greek Orthodox
Archdiocese.
Maternity Ruling Soon
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, en
tering a widely debated sex discrimination
dispute, agreed yesterday to decide whether
states can force employers to give pregnant
women special disability leave and additional
benefits that other workers do not receive.
The court will review a California law,
enacted in 1978, that guarantees women up to
four months unpaid maternity leave and
reinstatement to the same job unless there is a
demonstrable "business necessity" for not
doing so. Such benefits are not required for
other employees.
The case could have a substantial impact on
American businesses. Three other states —
Montana, Connecticut and Massachusetts —
have enacted similar laws and other states may
follow suit if such legislation is upheld. Some
proponents have urged the adoption of a na
tional policy requiring employers to grant
maternity leaves.
But an unlikely coalition of business groups
and some women's organizations, joined by
the Reagan Administration, has launched a far

ranging attack on such laws, contending that
they conflict with federal statutes requiring
equal — but not special — treatment for preg
nant workers.
Southerner in '88
WASHINGTON — Democratic Chairman
Paul Kirk Jr., in extraordinarily candid com
ments for a party leader, yesterday urged
Democrats to pick a Southerner for the 1988
presidential ticket and strongly supported a
plan for a Southern regional primary to be held
early in the election process.
Because of changing demographics and the
South's growing population, Kirk said, it
"would make sense to have a Southerner on
the ticket."
Stocks Resume Climb
NEW YORK — Stock prices gained ground
in subdued trading yesterday, steadying after
the sudden selloff that hit the market last
week.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
down 35.67 points last week, rose 7.00 to
1,520.53.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
slowed to 108.68 million shares from 122.78
million Friday.
