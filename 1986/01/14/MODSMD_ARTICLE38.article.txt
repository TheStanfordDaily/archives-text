Strike Talks Stall
OAKLAND — The bitter Oakland teachers
strike entered its second week yesterday amid
renewed charges from teachers that the
school district is only shuffling numbers as the
district warns union demands threaten financial
ruin.
As weekend negotiations with a state
mediator broke down, acting school Superin
tendent Joe Coto called a news conference
Sunday to repeat angrily a charge that the
union's demands would break the 51,000-
student district.
Harold Boyd, executive director of the
2,800-teacher Oakland Education Association,
said the union's latest proposal "does not bank

rupt anybody . . . nobody wants to see the dis
trict go belly-up."
The rejected proposal, said Boyd, would
"move us out of the cellar" in terms of Oak
land's place in the state's 20 largest districts.
The typical teacher salary in Oakland is now
$25,000, one of the lowest in the state's major
districts. An entry-level teacher with a bach
elor's degree gets $16,431. After 25 years of
service, a teacher with a doctorate makes
$29,981.
INS OKs Alien Visas
LOS ANGELES — The U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service, announcing a com-

promise with race track trainers who insist
they cannot find Americans willing to take the
jobs, said yesterday that 363 temporary work
visas will be issued to illegal aliens for positions
as grooms and exercise riders at three tracks
in Southern California.
The decision to grant the H-2 visas — the
first ever approved for the horse race industry
in the United States — was compared by the
INS district director for Los Angeles, Ernest
Gustafson, to the government's traditional wil
lingness to grant temporary work status to
foreigners who come to play major league
baseball or perform as Hollywood enter
tainers.
Gustafson said the visas will be good only
through Oct.l.
