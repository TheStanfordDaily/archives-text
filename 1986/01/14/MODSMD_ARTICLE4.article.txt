# Study Says Abused Children Better Off in Foster Homes
## 
### KELLY SUND Staff writer 
Abused and neglected children show little academic,
social or emotional development under existing foster
care programs or support programs that allow them to
remain at home, say three Stanford professors.
Michael Wald. professor of law, Dr. Herbert Leider
man, professor of psychiatry, and Carl Smith, profes
sor of psychology, recently conducted a two-year
study comparing abused and neglected children who
remained at home, while their parents received coun
seling, with abused and neglected children placed in
foster homes.
According to Wald, the children placed in foster care
showed better school attendance and better physical
health than their counterparts who remained at home,
half of whom showed continued minor abuse and ne
glect despite the social services provided.
The children under foster care also had less regres
sion in cognitive and social abilities.
Wald proposed the study because he had observed
that legislation concerning intervention strategies for
abused and neglected children seemed to be based on
insufficient empirical evidence. The report was made

to the California social services department.
Current federal and state laws direct the courts and
social service agencies to keep the children in their
homes as often as possible to avoid the trauma associ
ated with being separated from their parents. While
some legislation provides social services to the par
ents, little emphasis is placed on the children beyond
their physical safety, according to the study.
"If the only goal of public policy is to prevent severe
physical harm to children, the current policy is jus
tifiable," the authors said.
"However, if legislators are concerned with
children's academic, social and emotional development,
as we believe they should be, legislators have to do
more than adopt a preference for home or foster care.
Under present policies, abused and neglected children
remain at serious risk in both settings," they said.
The researchers interviewed children, parents,
teachers and social workers. They collected data on 32
white children ages 5 to 10. Black and Hispanic
children had to be excluded from the study because in
sufficient data could be collected on them.
Wald stressed the study was "very exploratory,"
and the results were not "conclusive enough" to make
any recommendations.
