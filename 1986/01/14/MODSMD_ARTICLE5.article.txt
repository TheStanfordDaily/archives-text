# Campbell Says Hoover Progressed In '84-85
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
"The 1984-85 academic year was one of
progress and achievement in all areas of the
Hoover Institution's operations," despite ef
forts by Stanford faculty to revise the rela
tionship between Hoover and the University,
Director W. Glenn Campbell said in the insti
tution's annual report, released last month.
"I am especially pleased that the Stanford
Board of Trustees at its meeting on Sept. 10,
1985, unanimously approved the Hoover In
stitution Board of Overseers' annual report
and took special note of the 'range and
quality' of scholarly contributions made by the
fellows of the Hoover Institution," Campbell
stated in his introductory remarks in the
report.
However, Campbell said he was worried
by sentiment among some University faculty
that Hoover should be subjected to greater
academic control in order to discourage the
institution's conservative ideology.
"It is a matter of grave concern to me that
despite the institution's record of achieve
ment, the Stanford Faculty Senate in June
1985 approved the report of the Senate Com
mittee on the Relation Between the Hoover
Institution and the Stanford Professoriate —
the so-called Dornbusch Report," Campbell
stated.
Campbell was unavailable for comment
yesterday.
The Dornbusch Report, named for Sociol
ogy Prof. Sanford Dornbusch, the commit
tee's chairman, addressed concerns that the
institution is a conservatively biased organi
zation and recommended to the Faculty Sen
ate that, "(University) governance is the key
to reduction of ideological concerns." The
senate approved the measure on June 6.
The Dornbusch Report contended that
"the centralized governance at Hoover en
courages the belief that the institution may be

engaging in political advocacy" and therefore
associating the University with particular po
litical beliefs.
Improved communication between Hoover
and the University and increased University
involvement in the appointment of Hoover
fellows were foremost among the Dornbusch
committee's nine recommendations.
In the Hoover annual report, Campbell
questioned the effect that these measures
would have upon the institution.
"The Dornbusch Report proposed even
tual 'divorce' of the institution from Stanford
University if the institution did not implement
the report's recommendations on governance
— several of which would reduce substan
tially the independence of the Hoover Institu
tion and violate long-standing contracts be
tween Hoover and Stanford," Campbell said.
"The institution's independent status
within Stanford University, the factor a small
group of critics among Stanford's profes
soriate use to fuel controversy, is the very
factor that guarentees the extraordinary
degree of academic freedom enjoyed by
scholars at Hoover. And it is this intellectual
freedom to pursue research and to communi
cate that is responsible for creating at Stan
ford an incomparable center for advanced re
search in domestic and international affairs
and public policy," Campbell said.
Dornbusch would not comment when con
tacted yesterday, saying he had not yet read
the Hoover report.
Campbell said he is encouraged by the fin
dings of a committee of Hoover senior re
searchers who responded to the Dornbusch
report.
"Of all the events of the past year, the one
I am most proud of is the response of the
Hoover senior researchers to the Dornbusch
Report. It was indeed gratifying to learn that
Hoover senior researchers, with virtual u
nanimity, shared my concerns," he said.
He then quoted the summary
paragraph of the Hoover scholars'
report: "In summation, when the
nine recommendations of the
Dornbusch Report are scrutinized

closely, we find that some already
have been in place for many years,
others are not necessary, while
others would violate long-standing
contracts between Hoover and
Stanford."
A split between Hoover and the
University would not change the
ideas of Hoover scholars, according
to Campbell.

"The Dornbusch Report is the
first University document to raise
publicly the issue of the separation
of the Hoover Institution from Stan
ford University. This is an extraor
dinarily serious matter; yet, let me
say to those who would divorce the
Institution from Stanford that such
an action will not banish the ideas of
Hoover scholars," Campbell said.

A split between Hoover and the
University would not change the
ideas of Hoover scholars, according
to Campbell.

"The Dornbusch Report is the
first University document to raise
publicly the issue of the separation
of the Hoover Institution from Stan
ford University. This is an extraor
dinarily serious matter; yet, let me
say to those who would divorce the
Institution from Stanford that such
an action will not banish the ideas of
Hoover scholars," Campbell said.
