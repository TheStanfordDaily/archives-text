# Police To Enforce New Seat Belt Law
## 
### DAVID RISSER Editorial staff 
Stanford police officers plan to
enforce California's new seat
belt law, according to Police
Capt. Marvin Moore.
The mandatory seat belt law
became effective Jan. 1, but
Stanford police will not issue
citations before March 1, in
keeping with the grace-period
policy of the California Highway
Patrol.
The law requires that both
drivers and passengers in
private automobiles and trucks
wear seat belts while riding on
California roads. Citations can be
issued to drivers and passengers
over the age of 16.
The fine for a first offense is
$20. Additional violations can
bring fines of up to $50.

Citations can only be issued,
however, if the driver is stopped
for another type of offense.
"The officer has to see that
the belts are in use. If you're
pulled over, stay buckled up until
the officer arrives at the car,"
Moore said in a news release.
California became the 16th
state to enact a mandatory seat
belt law. The law does not apply
to older cars without seat belts.
Questions regarding the law and
some of its more obscure re
strictions may be directed to 1-
BGO-BELTS ON, a toll-free tele
phone hotline.
The law was enacted to
"protect Californians from need
less death and injury and to
reduce taxpayer costs resulting
from traffic collisions," according
to a statement by the California
Office of Traffic Safety.
