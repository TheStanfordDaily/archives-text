### TAMAR SEIVER 
In nursery school I hated my name. My
teacher called me something that sounded like
"tomorrow."
Even then I had enough identity in my little
mind to know that, though I was not a big per
son, I was still a person and certainly not the fol
lowing day.
Arriving at Stanford, though much older and
perhaps a little more justified in thinking of
myself as a big person, the problem still
remained. While I remember the frosh dance,
President Kennedy's speech, the Band and
playing in DeGuerre Pool, what I remember
most about orientation is repeatedly pronouncing
my name.
By the third day I had been called Martar and
sometimes Mai Tai. At least I had advanced from
being a day to being a drink.
So I can't really sympathize with people who
have common names, although I am going to do a
story on them, as soon as I finish this paragraph.
Freshmen who have the same first and last
name as another student on campus will receive
a very nice letter from Stanford before arriving.
It informs the student of the situation and
advises the use of the middle initial to prevent
mix-ups.
Still, senior James Edward Anderson remem

bers registering tor the first time his freshman
year, always a scary experience. He was indeed
given the Permit to Register of James
E.Anderson. However, after being unable to an
swer many surprising questions, the clueless
frosh learned he had the PTR of James Ev
rett Anderson, then a junior. "An experience like
that kinda shakes you up," Edward recalls.

As a sophomore, he began receiving notices in
his post office box every day from UCSD in
forming him of a $3,000 debt for loans from the
school.
Having become wary and wise from his previ
ous adventure, Anderson ignored the notices.

Later, another notice arrived. In
bold, black print across the top it
admonished him that he had "48
hours" left before the deadline to
pay. After that, they would send
loan officers out to get him.
Anderson decided it would be
prudent to call and clear up the
matter.
Last year, as a junior in Soto,
there was another James Ander
son living in the same dorm. Intro
ductions during the first month led
to some confusion. People were
introduced to one James Ander
son and then another. Later
James Edward was often asked
about girls he "was dating," but
had actually never even met.
This year, freshman James Eric
Anderson remembers going to
Cowell Health Center and having
them pull the wrong file. It was a
harmless enough mistake since
he's still around to tell the story
about how the error was caught
before any treatment was ad
ministered.
Sophomore Nicholas Marvin
Anderson claims that being one of
two students with his name is "not
much of a hassle. We were in the
neighboring dorms, Schiff and Rob
inson, but no problems arose. His
counterpart, sophomore Nicholas
James Anderson, visited him the
first week of school his freshman
year just to say hello and intro
duce himself.
But the second Anderson did
have some difficulties at first. He
received the warning letter and
heeded its suggestion of always
using his middle initial. Neverthe
less, registering at Maples
Pavilion, Nicholas James found
two meal cards that had
different numbers, but both
showed the name, Nicholas Mar
vin Anderson. Nicholas James was
thus left hungry, although he
wasn't sure he was better
off after the mix-up was cleared
up.
Since then, the two have had

classes together without any
more confused incidents.
John C. Lee, as opposed to
freshman john D. Lee, can report
no mishaps, though they do take
great precautions. "I'll usually
sign my name complete with
middle initial, and then add on my
address and even my social se
curity number too," he said.
Despite the fact that there are
four Michael Anderson's at Stan
ford, three of whom have the
middle initial J., Michael Richard
can only report that, "sometimes
I'll get the other guy's mail, but
other than that, there have been

no real problems that I'm aware
of."
Even having similar first names
can lead to mistaken identity.
Three years ago, all four fresh
men in a quad in Roble were
named John. One of the four,
senior John Chuharski remem
bers, "Initially it was pretty inter
esting. Actually, it was rather
helpful. Though everyqne was
meeting and learning the names of
hundreds of people, they always
remembered our names."
During the course of the year,
the quad inhabitants put a sign on
their door that said 4J. On the

bathroom across the hall from
their room, they posted a sign
that said SJ. Whenever someone
called the room's telephone and
asked if John was there, the an
swer was yes, and they
proceeded to take each other's
phone calls.
"To clarify and make it easier,
we all went by the initials of our
first and last names, and it never
became a drag. It wasn't as if
people made fun of us, like our
names were Francis, " adds
Chuharski.
According to Residential Edu
cation, rooms like this are a coin
cidence. Roommate assignments
are made with too much consider
ation for four Johns to be put to
gether as a joke.
Chuharski agrees that the
matchup was based on some other
basis than their names. "On paper,
we got along real well." In fact, he
is still rooming with another mem
ber of the quad, senior John Lis,
and has three classes with an
other, senior John Moore.
Interesting pairs have occurred
between roommate last names,
too. Madera's freshmen Kenneth
Rock and Richard Roll are
roommates in Branner this year,
while freshmen named Salmon,
Fischer and Gillman form a triple.
This year in Roble, freshmen
Rick Bacon and Peter Ham are
roommates. Bacon comments, "I
was annoyed at first since it was
irritating. But, no, I was not
surprised that something like that
would happen. We took it pretty
well, and got used to it real quick.
Anyway, we get along real well so
it doesn't really mtter. Now
sometimes, it gives us something
to talk about. Much like a con
versation piece."
And then there is the name we
all share along with its confusion.
"I'm a student at Leland Stanford
Junior University and. ..."
"Oh, that's a junior university.
How interesting. I had always
thought. ..."
"No, no, it isn't a junior univer
sity. It was just named for. ..."

people made fun of us, like our
names were Francis, " adds
Chuharski.
According to Residential Edu
cation, rooms like this are a coin
cidence. Roommate assignments
are made with too much consider
ation for four Johns to be put to
gether as a joke.
Chuharski agrees that the
matchup was based on some other
basis than their names. "On paper,
we got along real well." In fact, he
is still rooming with another mem
ber of the quad, senior John Lis,
and has three classes with an
other, senior John Moore.
Interesting pairs have occurred
between roommate last names,
too. Madera's freshmen Kenneth
Rock and Richard Roll are
roommates in Branner this year,
while freshmen named Salmon,
Fischer and Gillman form a triple.
This year in Roble, freshmen
Rick Bacon and Peter Ham are
roommates. Bacon comments, "I
was annoyed at first since it was
irritating. But, no, I was not
surprised that something like that
would happen. We took it pretty
well, and got used to it real quick.
Anyway, we get along real well so
it doesn't really mtter. Now
sometimes, it gives us something
to talk about. Much like a con
versation piece."
And then there is the name we
all share along with its confusion.
"I'm a student at Leland Stanford
Junior University and. ..."
"Oh, that's a junior university.
How interesting. I had always
thought. ..."
"No, no, it isn't a junior univer
sity. It was just named for. ..."

In nursery school I hated my name. My
teacher called me something that sounded like
"tomorrow."
Even then I had enough identity in my little
mind to know that, though I was not a big per
son, I was still a person and certainly not the fol
lowing day.
Arriving at Stanford, though much older and
perhaps a little more justified in thinking of
myself as a big person, the problem still
remained. While I remember the frosh dance,
President Kennedy's speech, the Band and
playing in DeGuerre Pool, what I remember
most about orientation is repeatedly pronouncing
my name.
By the third day I had been called Martar and
sometimes Mai Tai. At least I had advanced from
being a day to being a drink.
So I can't really sympathize with people who
have common names, although I am going to do a
story on them, as soon as I finish this paragraph.
Freshmen who have the same first and last
name as another student on campus will receive
a very nice letter from Stanford before arriving.
It informs the student of the situation and
advises the use of the middle initial to prevent
mix-ups.
Still, senior James Edward Anderson remem

bers registering tor the first time his freshman
year, always a scary experience. He was indeed
given the Permit to Register of James
E.Anderson. However, after being unable to an
swer many surprising questions, the clueless
frosh learned he had the PTR of James Ev
rett Anderson, then a junior. "An experience like
that kinda shakes you up," Edward recalls.

As a sophomore, he began receiving notices in
his post office box every day from UCSD in
forming him of a $3,000 debt for loans from the
school.
Having become wary and wise from his previ
ous adventure, Anderson ignored the notices.

Later, another notice arrived. In
bold, black print across the top it
admonished him that he had "48
hours" left before the deadline to
pay. After that, they would send
loan officers out to get him.
Anderson decided it would be
prudent to call and clear up the
matter.
Last year, as a junior in Soto,
there was another James Ander
son living in the same dorm. Intro
ductions during the first month led
to some confusion. People were
introduced to one James Ander
son and then another. Later
James Edward was often asked
about girls he "was dating," but
had actually never even met.
This year, freshman James Eric
Anderson remembers going to
Cowell Health Center and having
them pull the wrong file. It was a
harmless enough mistake since
he's still around to tell the story
about how the error was caught
before any treatment was ad
ministered.
Sophomore Nicholas Marvin
Anderson claims that being one of
two students with his name is "not
much of a hassle. We were in the
neighboring dorms, Schiff and Rob
inson, but no problems arose. His
counterpart, sophomore Nicholas
James Anderson, visited him the
first week of school his freshman
year just to say hello and intro
duce himself.
But the second Anderson did
have some difficulties at first. He
received the warning letter and
heeded its suggestion of always
using his middle initial. Neverthe
less, registering at Maples
Pavilion, Nicholas James found
two meal cards that had
different numbers, but both
showed the name, Nicholas Mar
vin Anderson. Nicholas James was
thus left hungry, although he
wasn't sure he was better
off after the mix-up was cleared
up.
Since then, the two have had

classes together without any
more confused incidents.
John C. Lee, as opposed to
freshman john D. Lee, can report
no mishaps, though they do take
great precautions. "I'll usually
sign my name complete with
middle initial, and then add on my
address and even my social se
curity number too," he said.
Despite the fact that there are
four Michael Anderson's at Stan
ford, three of whom have the
middle initial J., Michael Richard
can only report that, "sometimes
I'll get the other guy's mail, but
other than that, there have been

no real problems that I'm aware
of."
Even having similar first names
can lead to mistaken identity.
Three years ago, all four fresh
men in a quad in Roble were
named John. One of the four,
senior John Chuharski remem
bers, "Initially it was pretty inter
esting. Actually, it was rather
helpful. Though everyqne was
meeting and learning the names of
hundreds of people, they always
remembered our names."
During the course of the year,
the quad inhabitants put a sign on
their door that said 4J. On the

bathroom across the hall from
their room, they posted a sign
that said SJ. Whenever someone
called the room's telephone and
asked if John was there, the an
swer was yes, and they
proceeded to take each other's
phone calls.
"To clarify and make it easier,
we all went by the initials of our
first and last names, and it never
