# Sure, a Smith Is a Smith Is a Smith

### TAMAR SEIVER 
In nursery school I hated my name. My
teacher called me something that sounded like
"tomorrow."
Even then I had enough identity in my little
mind to know that, though I was not a big per
son, I was still a person and certainly not the fol
lowing day.
Arriving at Stanford, though much older and
perhaps a little more justified in thinking of
myself as a big person, the problem still
remained. While I remember the frosh dance,
President Kennedy's speech, the Band and
playing in DeGuerre Pool, what I remember
most about orientation is repeatedly pronouncing
my name.
By the third day I had been called Martar and
sometimes Mai Tai. At least I had advanced from
being a day to being a drink.
So I can't really sympathize with people who
have common names, although I am going to do a
story on them, as soon as I finish this paragraph.
Freshmen who have the same first and last
name as another student on campus will receive
a very nice letter from Stanford before arriving.
It informs the student of the situation and
advises the use of the middle initial to prevent
mix-ups.
Still, senior James Edward Anderson remem

bers registering tor the first time his freshman
year, always a scary experience. He was indeed
given the Permit to Register of James
E.Anderson. However, after being unable to an
swer many surprising questions, the clueless
frosh learned he had the PTR of James Ev
rett Anderson, then a junior. "An experience like
that kinda shakes you up," Edward recalls.

As a sophomore, he began receiving notices in
his post office box every day from UCSD in
forming him of a $3,000 debt for loans from the
school.
Having become wary and wise from his previ
ous adventure, Anderson ignored the notices.
