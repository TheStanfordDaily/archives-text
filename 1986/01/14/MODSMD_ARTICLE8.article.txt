# Kleid Begins Nutrasweet Era

In what Kleids 'round the world
hailed as, "like, totally, the
greatest thing since strawberry
tofutti," Daily Managing Editor
Beth Kleid last night Diet Coked
her way to editor-in-chief of The
Daily's 189 th volume.
"Definitely," Kleid said when
asked if she was totally happy and
really, really excited about the
victory. "I'm so old, like, and I've
been here since Day One. I mean
Day One, and that's how I would
â€” I think that's how I'd answer
that question."
Amidst the cork-popping cere
mony that followed the announce
ment of the election results,
Kleid, a senior who, like, majors
in English and hails from La Jolla,
downed a Diet Coke before turn
ing to answer more questions
about her campaign, her projec
tions for the paper and whether
she would jog in the morning after
really tying one on last night.
"Cool, really, really cool. I'm,
like, shaking. I can't even believe
it," Kleid said in prefacing her
comments.

Kleid's election platform called
for sweeping changes in the way,
you know, the editorial side of
The Daily would deal with the
business side.

"I, like, think they (the busi
ness side) and we can, like, deal if
we have a gangbuster year. And,
for sure, staff bonuses will be big,
like, reallv. reallv huge. I think."
