"As laymen we need to recognize
that a sizeable number of our cur
rent social, economic and political
problems have roots in some aspect
of science or technology," said Paul
Hurd, professor emeritus of Stan
ford's School of Education, yester
day at the Senior Center here.
Selecting a period roughly cover
ing the lifetime of his audience,
Hurd traced the major scientific and
technological discoveries from 1910
to the present.
. "I have selected several achieve
ments familiar to most everyone
here, but because they are so
familiar, we sometimes forget the
impact they have had on our culture
and the way each of us lives, thinks
and feels," he said.
! Automobiles, television, syn
thetic fibers and computers were
among the many examples Hurd
used to point out both the good and
bad effects of science on American
society.
.Hurd reminded his audience that
although the automobile has
generated over 15 million jobs, it is
also the leading cause of death and
injury to young people. In addition,
Hiird said that originally there was
concern the automobile would
lead to the downfall of the then

modern youth because of the
"parking and necking" that became
so prevalent.
Hurd emphasized the layman's
obligation to be familiar with scien
tific developments and their impli
cations. He explained that particu
larly in a democracy, science is an
inescapable factor and a way of life
for the citizens.
"We can be certain that one way
or another a new discovery will in
fluence how we think, what we
value, how we adapt and how we

plan our future. How we judge the
worthiness of advances in science
and technology depends upon the
kind of decisions we make as
laymen regarding the uses of a new
discovery," Hurd said.
Hurd concluded his speech with a
look to the future. He suggested
that further developments in such
areas as fiber optics, ceramics and
genetic engineering would continue
to call on the layman to make deci
sions about their applications. Hurd
reminded his audience that "the
changes in our lifetime are only the
beginning. Our grandchildren will
see even greater changes."
Hurd's main area of interest is in
science education, the subject he
taught on the graduate level at
Stanford. Hurd now devotes his
time to doing research and policy
studies for the government.
In December he represented the
United States in meetings with the
Japanese to discuss science educa
tion at the pre-college level. For
this seminar held in Washington,
D.C., Hurd was in charge of outlin
ing a proposal for curriculum
reform.
Hurd was the first of six profes
sors scheduled to speak at the cen
ter this quarter in a series of
lectures entitled "Stanford Scholars
and Their Work." The lectures are
being co-sponsored by Foothill Col
lege.
