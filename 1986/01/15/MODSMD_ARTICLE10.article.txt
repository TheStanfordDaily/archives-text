# Ticket Buyers Turned Away
## 
### AMY EINHORN 
The 500 remaining tickets to Tuesday's
speech by Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu
sold out yesterday afternoon, leaving ap
proximately 150 students ticketless
despite an early morning wait of several
hours.
The students were turned away be
cause Tresidder Union officials reversed
an earlier decision that students could
purchase the tickets, which were ear
marked for sale to the "general public."
The majority of the 150 students were
among those left frustrated Monday after
the BASS ticket agency in Tresidder sold
all the 1,000 "student only" tickets.
John Castonia, the ticket office
manager, told the students Monday morn
ing that they could purchase tickets the
following day during sales to the general
public.
Yesterday morning, however, Castonia
told the crowd that students would not be
allowed to purchase tickets because they
had had exclusive access to the tickets on
Monday.

Anyone attempting to buy tickets would
be required to show a picture ID and
those found to be registered students
would not be allowed to buy tickets, Cas
tonia said.
He admitted, however, that the
publicized ticket rules did say that stu
dents could purchase tickets on both
days. Asked for the reason behind the
change in policy, Castonia referred all
questions to Tresidder Director Ellie Op
penheim.
Oppenheim said she and Ron Hudson,
assistant dean of students and chairman of
the Martin Luther King Commemorative
Commission, concluded on Monday after
noon that no tickets would be sold to stu
dents on Tuesday. The decision was
made "on the basis of concern for the fac
ulty," who had called Oppenheim express
ing concern over the rapid sale of tickets
to students, Oppenheim said.
One thousand tickets were sold to stu
dents within an hour and a half on Monday.
"One point you want to make is that if
they're going to say, 'Only sell to students
on Monday and faculty on Tuesday,' fine.
But to change at the last minute doesn't

seem fair," said David Braun, a co
terminal student who was turned away
yesterday morning.
Michael Schmitz, the Stanford Out of
South Africa (SOSA) representative and a
member of the Martin Luther King sub
committee in charge of coordinating the
Tutu visit, expressed anger at the hand
ling of the situation, declaring that there
was "a lack of democracy in the whole
thing."
According to Schmitz, the committee,
which includes Hudson and Oppenheim,
met and decided on Jan. 7 that the first
day of ticket sales would be exclusively
for students, while the second day would
be for the general public.
The general public was defined as
"students, faculty and staff," according to
Schmitz.
Hudson, however, said it was defined
as faculty, community members and non
students.
"There was not any particular change in
ticket policy" and "no major decision was
made," Hudson said, adding that he feels
there was nothing to communicate to the
committee.
