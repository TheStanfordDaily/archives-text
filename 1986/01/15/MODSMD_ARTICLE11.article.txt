An article in yesterday's Daily mistakenly
identified J. Merrill Carlsmith, professor of
psychology, as Carl Smith.
Another article in yesterday's Daily in
correctly implied that a proposed amend
ment to the ASSU constitution applies to all
of the current ASSU fees. The amendment
applies to only a portion of the fees.
The Daily regrets the errors.
