As the first national holiday commemorating the
birth of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. approaches, the
moment has come to celebrate the accomplishments
of the civil rights movement, but also to look
seriously at the work that still needs to be done to
help make U. S. society one that truly offers liberty
and justice to all of its citizens.
Had King lived, he would be 57 years old today.
In the numbness that followed his assassination on
April 4, 1968, his supporters focused understand
ably on the tragedy of his death, rather than on con
tinuing the fight for which he died. With King, some
of the hope of that movement momentarily died.
Without doubt, King was an outstanding leader of
tremendous vision, with an enormous capacity to
mobilize. But it must not be forgotten that it was the
presence and growth of a mass movement that gave
rise to such a leader, and not the other way around.
King himself urged people to follow, not him, but
the dream he sought to pass on â€” a dream that can
not be allowed to die.
Due to the commitment and tenacity of the civil
rights movement, doors of access to education and
employment previously closed to minorities opened
by a crack. But gains made since that era have been
few. Too often the words, "the first black" or "the

first Chicano" preface the appointment of a minority
to a position of honor or authority.
The percentage of blacks and minorities in the
United States that lives below the poverty line is
grossly out of line with the corresponding figure for
whites. But now some of the measures developed
to combat these and other problems, such as affirm
ative action, are under attack.
At Stanford the rapid growth of the '60s has
slowed, and in some cases is declining. More per
sonnel and resources should be allocated to the
recruitment and retention of minority faculty and
students. The number of tenured minority profes
sors, which reached a high of 50 in '82-83, had fallen
to 46 out of 827 in '84-85 (or 6 percent). Only five
black professors have been promoted to tenure
since 1975. While blacks make up 12-15 percent of
the nation's population, only about 8 percent of
Stanford undergraduates were black in '84-85.
Redressing these grievances should not be put off
any longer. We must begin to rebuild the kind of
mass movement that can spawn a leader like King,
and stop waiting for such a leader to emerge to
mobilize a movement which we can then join. The
dream of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. can no longer
be deferred.
