## Covert Action Disastrous 
### 
Victor Vescovo's column,
"Covert Action Necessary" (The
Daily, Jan. 8), might have qualified
him for a job in the State Depart
ment. But given the rather limited
expertise of the Reagan Adminis
tration's foreign-policy makers, this
doesn't say much for his grasp of
the facts. Indeed, I find Vescovo's
interpretation of world affairs and
his subsequent endorsement of the
use of covert action by the U.S.
government utterly false, unintel
ligent and disastrous.

VIEWPOINT

Assuming that the United States
is involved in a life-or-death
struggle with the Soviet Union,
Vescovo divides the whole world
neatly into two camps: the good
anti-communists and the commu
nist anti-Americans. Unfortunately
the world is not as simple as that.
Frankly, I would have expected a
bit more sophistication from a Stan
ford political science major in his
junior year.
Vescovo lacks a thorough knowl
edge of the complicated inner
structure of the conflicts he would
like to solve through covert action.
The Afghan rebels, for example, do
not need more support for their
fight against the Soviet invaders. It
is ridiculous to assume that the So
viet army would surrender to Af
ghan rebels. Neither can it squelch
their resistance. Mere military sup
port for the rebels would therefore
only prolong their terrible ordeal in
the interest of self-proclaimed
freedom fighters living comfortably
in the United States. Instead there
is a need for a diplomatic solution
that would give the Soviets an
honorable retreat and would install
an independent, neutral Afghani
stan. To try to level what Vescovo
calls a "serious blow ... to Soviet
world prestige" on the backs of the
Afghan people is both inhumane and
unnecessary — the Soviets them
selves did more harm to their own
credibility than anyone else could
have done.
In the case of Kampuchea, Ves
covo completely muddles up the
facts, thereby exemplifying the
false perceptions to which primitive
anti-communism can lead. He obvi
ously does not realize that Pol Pot
and the Khmer Rouge were ousted
from power by Vietnamese commu
nist troops, thus putting an end to
their Stone Age communism and
the holocaust. The irony here lies in
the fact that the initial covert action
of President Richard Nixon and his
security adviser Henry Kissinger
— the secret bombing of Kampu
chea, the removal of neutral Prince
Sihanouk and the installment of pro-
American Lon Nol — finally gave
enough impact to the fight of the
Khmer Rouge. U.S. covert action
weakened moderate Kampuchean
forces and led finally to holocaust.
Vietnamese troops, following
centuries-old imperialist ambitions
in that area, eventually seized the
opportunity and liberated Kampu
chea from brutal chaos.
Neither Vescovo nor the Reagan

Administration seems to have any
knowledge of or perspective on
Central America's history, its mili
tary power structure and the strong
support of the Nicaraguan people
for the Sandinistas. In their naive
world view, Nicaragua, a small
country with roughly 2.5 million in
habitants, surrounded by hostile
neighbors closely allied with the
United States and protected against
military aggression by several
treaties, is perceived as a vital
threat to the very existence of the
United States. But the ruling elites
in countries like El Salvador or
Guatemala are not afraid of a direct
exportation of revolution or an inva
sion by the Sandinistas. Rather,
they fear that the survival of a
popular revolutionary system which
is a viable alternative to their op
pressive military dictatorships
would give their people hope in
their fight for freedom.
Vescovo's, i.e. Reagan's,
"simplest solution" would yield the
worst results. Not only would an
unending guerrilla war by thousands
of well-armed, trained Contras
keep that region unstable, but the
armies in Latin American countries
would interpret a suppression of
the Nicaraguan revolution and the
toppling of the legitimate and
democratically elected Sandinista
government as an encouragement
to repress democratic reforms. In
Argentina or Brazil they might have
fewer scruples about reversing the
process of democratization.
Unilateral U.S. intervention in
Central America has a long tradition
and is used in most cases to thwart
revolutions or reformist move
ments, thereby crystallizing reac
tionary regimes and quasi-feudal
social structures. It should be no
surprise that any successful revolu
tion or reform today is anti-
American. But it must not neces
sarily remain so. The United States
could keep its influence in these
countries if it instead protected and
supported leftist reformist move
ments, rather than chasing them
into the arms of Cuba or the Soviet
Union. These movements are the
most popular and therefore poten

tialiy the most powerful organiza
tions in many Latin American
countries. Even Fidel Castro is not
that happy about being isolated
from American markets. A more
open approach to Cuba would even
tually make it less dependent on the
Eastern bloc.
The basic problem with anti
communist guerrillas is that they are
not necessarily freedom fighters.
Afghans might build an Islamic dic
tatorship, Nicaraguan Contras are
controlled by former Somozistas
and the Kampuchean coalition of
guerrilla armies is heavily dominated
by the Khmer Rouge. In all of these
cases covert action has disastrous
effects. Worse, the U.S. position in
the international arena is
weakened. Apparent victories
through covert actions or open in
terventions prove to be short
range. They backfire, weakening
the position of unstable allies,
giving moral support to communist
guerrillas and desperate terrorists
all over the world and making the
United States less trustworthy. If
the United States continues its
confused and impulsive policy of
clandestine or overt intervention, it
will lose its support in the Western
world, strengthening isolationist
tendencies in Europe and disrupting
important regional and international
organizations.
Like Vescovo, people now
governing this country lack the
basic knowledge necessary to solve
complicated conflicts and are
entrapped in a primitive, dualistic
world view. They are unable to es
tablish thorough, thoughtful and
workable foreign policies. Acting
unilaterally, ethnocentrically and
impulsively, they dream up roman
tic visions of liberation, but produce
only chaos, instability and suffering
for millions of people. They want to
be heroes fighting the evil in this
world, but their naivete finally
makes them useful idiots for anti
democratic anti-communists and
makes all their efforts coun
terproductive.
