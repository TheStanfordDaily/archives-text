# Guilt by Association on the 7F
## 
### 
I guess anyone sitting on a SamTrans bus in a blue
suit with three suitcases deserved to be criticized for
something. But I don't know if I had done as much
wrong as they all claimed I had. If it wasn't for my Rod
ney Dangerfield sense of humor, I don't know if I ever
would have made it from the airport to Stanford.
Sure, criticize me for my blue suit and expensive
education. I didn't use to have it so good. I once walked
into a clothing store and said I wanted to see something
cheap, and they told me to look in the mirror.
I didn't much feel like talking. So of course a lady
with two kids sucking popsicles started firing questions
at me. It didn't take long before she asked me what I'd
be doing next year. I didn't know, and I told her so.

"I'll bet you're going to work in one of those huge
corporations," she charged.
"What if I do?"
"It's unethical to work for them. They exploit us
little people."
"But what if I don't exploit anyone? What if I just do a
good job?"
"Still the same. Just by being in contact with 'em
you're still exploiting."
After a delayed flight and a long wait for a slow bus, I
wasn't much in the mood to defend myself. So I left the
lady and moved to another seat. But at least I was get
ting some attention. When I was a kid they used to say,
"Let's go play hide-and-go-seek." So I would hide, and
they would never come look for me.
After the bearded man standing in the aisle was done
reading the advertisements over the seats for the third
time, and got tired of trying to read The Chronicle over
another man's shoulder, he turned to me.
"I'll bet you voted for Reagan," he accused.
"I'll bet you voted for Nixon," I answered.
"But you did vote, didn't you?"
"Yes," was all I could think of to say. One out of two
isn't bad.
"Criminal."
The comment threw me off guard. I had to ask him
what I had done wrong.
"Every person who votes continues the system that

oppresses other countries throughout the world," he
continued.
"But what if I oppress nobody?" I asked.
"You're doing it indirectly, just the same. I don't
vote because I don't support everything this damned
country does," he explained.
"If you feel this way, how come you live here?" I
asked.
"I'm on parole."
This was my lucky day. Actually, it wasn't as bad as
the night before. I was in a bar, and I told this lady I
wanted to see what her bedroom looked like, so she
drew me a sketch.
Twenty minutes later I was on the back seat of the
bus trying to be inconspicuous by looking out the win
dow at Redwood City. But my silence was quickly in
terrupted.
"Hey, dude. Do you live here?"
I turned to the attention of a spaced-out kid dressed
in rainbow clothes pointing at the seat next to me.
"If you're asking if this seat is taken, it is not," I an
swered.
"No, man. I'm asking if you live here."
'Where, on this bus?"
"No, man. This world's the here I mean."
Great. A whole bus-load full of philosophers.
"Most of the time," I answered.
"Oh, fri&n: You disappoint me. How can you partake
in this world's problems?"
I was never so happy to see Emporium and I. Mag
nin. I struggled off the bus, and here I am now, walking
back to campus. Those criticisms have started me
thinking.
A lot of times we get accused of being unethical not
for what we directly do, but for what we are indirectly
tied to. Working for a corporation that neglects the en
vironment, the consumer or the employee is often con
sidered unethical, even if we as workers aren't guilty of
neglect. Investing in companies that pay taxes to South
Africa, even if the company is an equal-opportunity em
ployer, is also often considered unethical.
Ethics is like other sciences in that it searches for
principles â€” laws of the universe that do or should
govern what happens. Ethics is of no use unless the
principle by which we judge applies in all cases. In the
examples above, the principle was that we can be
judged unethical by our indirect contacts as well as by
our direct actions. But by that principle we are all un
ethical, as the people on the bus vividly demonstrated.
I say it's time to throw that principle out the window.
What matters is not our indirect contacts. A distinction
should be made between the individual and the com
munities to which that individual belongs.
