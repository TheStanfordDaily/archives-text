# Pair Pleads Innocent
## Hearing for third accused of forgery set for Jan. 29 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Two Stanford football players yesterday pleaded in
nocent to various felony charges in Palo Alto Municipal
Court, and a third will enter pleas Jan. 29 pending iden
tification of counsel, the Santa Clara County District
Attorney's Office said yesterday.
Freshman Sam Sutherland pleaded innocent to one
count each of burglary and forgery, and junior Wendell
Brown pleaded innocent to one count each of forgery,
altering a driver's license and receiving or possessing
stolen property.
Sophomore Ken Richardson will enter pleas Jan. 29
to one count each of burglary, forgery, altering a
driver's license and receiving or possessing stolen
property, the district attorney's office said.
All three defendants are being counseled by Palo
Alto attorney Andrew Parnes, but in court Parnes is
representing only Sutherland. Brown was represented
by David Cohen of the public defender's office, while
Richardson did not have an attorney present yester
day.
Both Parnes and the district attorney's office said it
is routine procedure for each defendant to be

represented by his own attorney in court.
Richardson said yesterday that he did not yet know
who his representative in court will be. He said that he
and Brown are still meeting with Parnes. "There'll
probably be a couple more meetings with our attorney,
but after that, I don't really know. We'll probably just
wait and see," he said.
The three also face University Judicial Council
proceedings on violating the Fundamental Standard.
Those proceedings are separate from the legal
proceedings. "Nothing has really changed except that
the school has indicated it won't apply any decision until
next quarter," Brown said.
Sutherland could not be reached for comment.
On Jan. 29, there will also be an appearance by Suth
erland and Brown to determine whether their cases
will go to a preliminary hearing or a superior court
review, the DA's office said. The superior court
review would be to discuss the case and determine
whether it will go to trial or be settled out of court.
Brown and Sutherland also waived their right to time
— the right to have the next appearance within 10 days
— resulting in the Jan. 29 date, ac
cording to the DA's office.
The three are all members of the
Stanford football team. Sutherland
was the starting strong safety this
season. Brown and Richardson are
reserve wide receivers.
They were arrested Dec. 3
at the Emporium-Capwell store in
Stanford Shopping Center after al
legedly attempting to purchase
$470 worth of clothing with checks
and credit cards stolen from sopho
more David Sweeney. Sweeney is
the starting kicker for the football
team.
Police records also say that the
three used a Visa card stolen from
junior Dan Brumbaugh to charge
$1,700 worth of merchandise and
that Sutherland cashed another
$800 in checks stolen from Brum
baugh.
Brumbaugh lives in Florence

Moore Hall's Loro dormitory, on
the same hallway as Sutherland. He
said his backpack, containing his
checks and wallet, was stolen from
outside his door after midnight on
Dec. 3.
The three defendants' futures on
the football team are largely up to
Coach Jack Elway, and that decision
is separate from those of the Uni
versity and the courts, according to
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole.
Elway said in a statement last
month that he had spoken with the
players about the charges, and a
team meeting was held last week to
discuss the matter.
Cole also said earlier that if found
guilty by the University, the three
could face penalties ranging from
censure to expulsion.
If convicted on all charges, they
could receive maximum sentences
in a state prison of five years for
Richardson, four years and four
months for Brown, and three years
and eight months for Sutherland.
