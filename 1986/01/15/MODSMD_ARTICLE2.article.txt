## Hearing for third accused of forgery set for Jan. 29 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Two Stanford football players yesterday pleaded in
nocent to various felony charges in Palo Alto Municipal
Court, and a third will enter pleas Jan. 29 pending iden
tification of counsel, the Santa Clara County District
Attorney's Office said yesterday.
Freshman Sam Sutherland pleaded innocent to one
count each of burglary and forgery, and junior Wendell
Brown pleaded innocent to one count each of forgery,
altering a driver's license and receiving or possessing
stolen property.
Sophomore Ken Richardson will enter pleas Jan. 29
to one count each of burglary, forgery, altering a
driver's license and receiving or possessing stolen
property, the district attorney's office said.
All three defendants are being counseled by Palo
Alto attorney Andrew Parnes, but in court Parnes is
representing only Sutherland. Brown was represented
by David Cohen of the public defender's office, while
Richardson did not have an attorney present yester
day.
Both Parnes and the district attorney's office said it
is routine procedure for each defendant to be

represented by his own attorney in court.
Richardson said yesterday that he did not yet know
who his representative in court will be. He said that he
and Brown are still meeting with Parnes. "There'll
probably be a couple more meetings with our attorney,
but after that, I don't really know. We'll probably just
wait and see," he said.
The three also face University Judicial Council
proceedings on violating the Fundamental Standard.
Those proceedings are separate from the legal
proceedings. "Nothing has really changed except that
the school has indicated it won't apply any decision until
next quarter," Brown said.
Sutherland could not be reached for comment.
On Jan. 29, there will also be an appearance by Suth
erland and Brown to determine whether their cases
will go to a preliminary hearing or a superior court
review, the DA's office said. The superior court
review would be to discuss the case and determine
whether it will go to trial or be settled out of court.
Brown and Sutherland also waived their right to time
â€” the right to have the next appearance within 10 days
