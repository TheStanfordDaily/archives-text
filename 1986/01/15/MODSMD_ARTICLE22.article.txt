## Host Program Tells Applicants All 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions
wades knee deep in applications, seniors Donna
Booher and Art Chutuape are preparing for the arrival
of hundreds of high school seniors who have to make
the big decision of whether they will choose Stanford
after Stanford has chosen them.
Booher and Chutuape arrange "hosts" for these
prospective frosh when they come to visit during the
month of April.
"The program is open to anyone living on campus,"
said Chutuape. "We need all the people we can get."
Last year for the first time, Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions Jean Fetter put a note in high school
seniors' acceptance letters informing them of the host
program. Subsequently, the number of overnight
visitors doubled from 109 in 1984 to 223 in 1985.
Booher, Chutuape and Asst. Director of Undergrad
uate Admissions Scott Allen agree that the program
needs to be expanded. In 1985 there were 160 hosts
available during the month of April, according to
Chutuape. That number failed to be enough, he said.
Booher and Chutuape said they hope to increase that
number this year, and as a long-range goal they want to
offer the hosting program year around.
Chutuape believes the key to expansion is through
exposure. He wants to run ads in The Daily in the com
ing months to inform students of the program.
"It's a lot of fun to do, because you're providing a
good service," Booher says. "It's not a pain."
"Most of them (prospective freshmen) got a better
perspective, because they spent time with students,"
says senior Kristin Kirchner, one of last year's student
coordinators.
Freshmen Michelle Donahue and John Stam, both
veterans of the program, agree with Kirchner.
"It did influence my decision a lot," Stam said. He
was choosing between Stanford and Princeton Univer
sity. After visiting both in one week, he decided that
Stanford was the place for him.

"I was impressed with the classes at Stanford and
liked the attitude the students took toward work," he
said.
"I was treated like a student and everyone was
really friendly," Donahue said. She added that the
physical beauty of the campus was also a deciding fac
tor.
Both Donahue and Stam stayed overnight and went
to parties on campus. They both agree that this helped
them get a feel for the campus.
Not all prospective freshmen stay overnight. Last
year 150 high school seniors had day hosts who took
them to lunch and introduced them briefly to Stanford
life.

Dean of Undergraduate Ad
missions Jean Fetter put a
note in high school seniors'
acceptance letters informing
them of the host program.
Subsequently, the number of
overnight visitors doubled.

Those students who undertake the responsibility of
hosting prospective freshmen, either for the day or
overnight, are provided with a few guidelines on how
to entertain their guests, but the prospective fresh
man's schedule while visiting is flexible.
The most important thing to remember, Booher
said, is not to sell Stanford: "It will sell itself."
"This is not the intention of the program," Allen
said, explaining that the program is set up as a service
to the student.
In 1985, of the 223 overnights who visited, 160 en
rolled at Stanford, (approximately 75 percent), accord
ing to Allen. This statistic, however, is "potentially

misleading." If a prospective freshman visits the
campus and then accepts, it is not necessarily "a cause
effect relationship."
"We hope they'll get an unbiased view of the
campus," Allen said.
Also, hosts should not "try to answer any questions
they do not know the answers to," such as financial aid
inquiries and the chances of a younger sibling being ac
cepted in the future, according to Booher.
"They (prospective freshmen) should be directed to
undergraduate admissions" or the appropriate office
for those answers, Booher said.
Hosts are not expected to take time away from their
studies or other daily activities, Booher said, em
phasizing that "the time commitment isn't that great."
All that is minimally expected of the host is to pick up
the prospective freshman at the Admissions Office
upon his or her arrival, to introduce him or her to
several people and to point the prospective freshman in
the direction of interesting classes or other events.
The rest is up to the host as to how much time he or
she can or wants to spend with the visitor.
Another problem in the past has been a lack of com
munication between the Admissions Office and the
hosts, according to Kirchner. Booher and Chutuape
have proposed a communications network that will
keep everyone better informed.
Booher said one day last year she walked into the of
fice and found herself assuring a frantic mother over
the telephone that her child would have a place to stay
even though the visit had just been arranged. Hopefully
an increase in communication will alleviate such last
minute problems, she said.
One group of prospective freshmen who do not visit
through Booher and Chutuape's host program are
recruits. Sophomore swimmer Stephanie Norton ex
plains that when swimming recruits come to visit, the
team organizes events to take them to, such as football
games and swim meets. They host team dinners and
overall try to cater to them, Norton said.
She explained that, unlike the Admissions Office
hosting program, the team wants to convince the
recruits that Stanford is the place for them.

While the Office of Undergraduate Admissions
wades knee deep in applications, seniors Donna
Booher and Art Chutuape are preparing for the arrival
of hundreds of high school seniors who have to make
the big decision of whether they will choose Stanford
after Stanford has chosen them.
Booher and Chutuape arrange "hosts" for these
prospective frosh when they come to visit during the
month of April.
"The program is open to anyone living on campus,"
said Chutuape. "We need all the people we can get."
Last year for the first time, Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions Jean Fetter put a note in high school
seniors' acceptance letters informing them of the host
program. Subsequently, the number of overnight
visitors doubled from 109 in 1984 to 223 in 1985.
Booher, Chutuape and Asst. Director of Undergrad
uate Admissions Scott Allen agree that the program
needs to be expanded. In 1985 there were 160 hosts
available during the month of April, according to
Chutuape. That number failed to be enough, he said.
Booher and Chutuape said they hope to increase that
number this year, and as a long-range goal they want to
offer the hosting program year around.
Chutuape believes the key to expansion is through
exposure. He wants to run ads in The Daily in the com
ing months to inform students of the program.
"It's a lot of fun to do, because you're providing a
good service," Booher says. "It's not a pain."
"Most of them (prospective freshmen) got a better
perspective, because they spent time with students,"
says senior Kristin Kirchner, one of last year's student
coordinators.
Freshmen Michelle Donahue and John Stam, both
veterans of the program, agree with Kirchner.
"It did influence my decision a lot," Stam said. He
was choosing between Stanford and Princeton Univer
sity. After visiting both in one week, he decided that
Stanford was the place for him.

"I was impressed with the classes at Stanford and
liked the attitude the students took toward work," he
said.
"I was treated like a student and everyone was
really friendly," Donahue said. She added that the
physical beauty of the campus was also a deciding fac
tor.
Both Donahue and Stam stayed overnight and went
to parties on campus. They both agree that this helped
them get a feel for the campus.
Not all prospective freshmen stay overnight. Last
year 150 high school seniors had day hosts who took
them to lunch and introduced them briefly to Stanford
life.

Dean of Undergraduate Ad
missions Jean Fetter put a
note in high school seniors'
acceptance letters informing
them of the host program.
Subsequently, the number of
overnight visitors doubled.

Those students who undertake the responsibility of
hosting prospective freshmen, either for the day or
overnight, are provided with a few guidelines on how
to entertain their guests, but the prospective fresh
man's schedule while visiting is flexible.
The most important thing to remember, Booher
said, is not to sell Stanford: "It will sell itself."
"This is not the intention of the program," Allen
said, explaining that the program is set up as a service
to the student.
In 1985, of the 223 overnights who visited, 160 en
rolled at Stanford, (approximately 75 percent), accord
ing to Allen. This statistic, however, is "potentially

misleading." If a prospective freshman visits the
campus and then accepts, it is not necessarily "a cause
effect relationship."
"We hope they'll get an unbiased view of the
campus," Allen said.
Also, hosts should not "try to answer any questions
they do not know the answers to," such as financial aid
inquiries and the chances of a younger sibling being ac
cepted in the future, according to Booher.
"They (prospective freshmen) should be directed to
undergraduate admissions" or the appropriate office
for those answers, Booher said.
Hosts are not expected to take time away from their
studies or other daily activities, Booher said, em
phasizing that "the time commitment isn't that great."
All that is minimally expected of the host is to pick up
the prospective freshman at the Admissions Office
upon his or her arrival, to introduce him or her to
several people and to point the prospective freshman in
the direction of interesting classes or other events.
The rest is up to the host as to how much time he or
she can or wants to spend with the visitor.
Another problem in the past has been a lack of com
munication between the Admissions Office and the
hosts, according to Kirchner. Booher and Chutuape
have proposed a communications network that will
keep everyone better informed.
Booher said one day last year she walked into the of
fice and found herself assuring a frantic mother over
the telephone that her child would have a place to stay
even though the visit had just been arranged. Hopefully
an increase in communication will alleviate such last
minute problems, she said.
One group of prospective freshmen who do not visit
through Booher and Chutuape's host program are
recruits. Sophomore swimmer Stephanie Norton ex
plains that when swimming recruits come to visit, the
team organizes events to take them to, such as football
games and swim meets. They host team dinners and
overall try to cater to them, Norton said.
