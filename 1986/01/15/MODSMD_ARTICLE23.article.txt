# Bankers Threaten To Stop Loans to Students
## Congressional aides say lenders cried wolf too often 
### TODD RAMMING Editorial staff 
The Senate Subcommittee on Education, Arts and the
Humanities has approved a reduction in payments to
banks who offer loans to students, despite threats from
banks to stop such lending if these cuts were ap
proved.

Just prior to adjournment last month, Congress also
approved a deficit reduction measure that could reduce
such payments even more if federal budget targets
aren't met, according to The Chronicle of Higher Edu
cation.
The furor over recent legislation follows a fall season
of arguments between banks which lend to students
and several arms of the federal government, now
charged with contributing to the reduction of the
federal budget deficit.

This fall, members of Congress proposed legislation
to require banks to disburse federally guaranteed loans
to students in increments rather than in a lump sum at
the start of the academic year.
Lenders complained that their administrative costs
would be too high, and the proposal remains pending in
Congress.
The Education Department has proposed regula
tions that would require banks to submit more docu
ments before receiving reimbursement from the gov
ernment for defaulted student loans.
Bankers again highlighted oversized administrative
costs, and the Education Department will not release
final regulations on loan reimbursement until April.
Congressional aides say lawmakers approved the
cuts because bankers had cried wolf too often.
"Every time we've moved to change the program,
they said it couldn't be done, that they'd drop us out,"
said Polly Gault, staff director of the Senate education
subcommittee.
"We know these are attractive loans because every

one is trying to get into the program," she said.
The banks contend that their complaints are based
on hard business facts and warn that Congress is at
tempting to return to the mid-'7os when the yield to in
stitutions on Guaranteed Student Loans was unat
tractive and many lenders refused to grant such loans.
In order to encourage lenders to make loans to stu
dents, the government currently pays them a special
interest allowance of 3.5 percent above the 91-day
U.S. Treasury bill rate, which is approximately 7 per
cent. The subsidy is meant to bridge the difference be
tween the 8 percent rate that students pay on their
loans and prevailing market rates.
Lenders earn an average of about .75 percent on
their student loan portfolios, according to a study by
the Consumer Bankers Association.
Most institutions are reluctant to reveal their profits
on student loans. More than half of the 13,000 lenders
that make student loans earn less than $5,775 annually
on those portfolios, according to the Consumer Bank
ers Association.
