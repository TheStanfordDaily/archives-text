## Engineering Student Gets Small, Wins Prize

"It was the best of times, it was
the worst of times. ..."
Even Dickens might not have
recognized this, his opening sen
tence to "A Tale of Two Cities,"
after Stanford electrical engineer
ing graduate student Tom Newman
had finished with it in November.
Newman shrunk this sentence,
along with the rest of the novel's
first page, by a factor of 25,000, in
order to win a $1,000 prize that has
remained unclaimed for 25 years.

non-scientists to enter a new field
of physics, that of "manipulating
and controlling things on .a small
scale."
One of the two challenges pro
posed by Feynman, that of making
an "operant electric motor which
. . . is only 1/64 inch cube," was
met almost immediately, said New
man in an interview at the end of
last quarter. But Feynman also of
fered a prize "to the first guy who
can take the information on the
page of a book and put it on an area
25,000 times smaller in linear scale,
in such manner that it can be read
by an electron microscope."

Reducing one page of text 25,000 times
is comparable to writing all 24 volumes
of the Encyclopedia Brittanica on the
head of a pin. . . .

In an address at the 1960
meeting of the American Physical
Society, California Institute of
Technology Physics Prof. Richard
Feynman offered two $1,000
prizes, to encourage scientists and

Newman has done just that.
As Feynman figured it in 1960,
reducing one page of text 25,000
times is comparable to writing all 24
volumes of the Encyclopaedia Brit
tanica on the head of a pin that

measures 1/16 of an inch across. By
a similar calculation, Newman's
demagnified Dickens measures 6
microns by 6 microns (1 micron
equals 1/25,000 inch).
"One of the first things I had to
figure was exactly what Feynman
meant by a 'page of text'," ex
plained Newman. "Figuring he
didn't want anything like 'run, Dick,
run,' I sat down and counted words
until I found an 'average' page. . . .
It ended up being a toss-up be
tween a book on 'Leave it to Bea
ver* and the Dickens," he con
cluded.
For the actual miniaturization,
Newman used three basic tools: a
scanning electron beam, a specially
prepared silicon chip and a PDP-11
computer to synchronize the input
of information with the output of
writing.
With the help of Ken Williams of
the Electrical Engineering Dept.,
Newman used magnets to focus a
40,000-volt beam of electrons,
analogous to those used in a scan
ning electron microscope. "Once
focused to a very narrow beam," he
said, "this is what we used as a
'pencil' for writing on the chip."
The chip itself is made of silicon,
said Newman, thinly coated with
silicon nitrite. A hole is made al
most all the way through from one
side, leaving only a thin membrane
of silicon nitrite across a window in

the chip. A very thin layer of Lucite
is then applied across this
membrane, and this is the surface on
which the desired information is
written.
Electrons go right through the
Lucite, explained Newman, but
every part of the Lucite that is hit
by the electron beam is changed
slightly and becomes soluble to an
other compound, called Cellosolve.
A solution of Cellosolve can

therefore be used to reveal the in
formation written on the chip, a bit
like the way that photographic
developer can be used to reveal
images on photographic paper.
"I shouldn't give the impres
sion," added Newman, "that we in
vented any of the technology, or
that any of what we have done
could not have been done by
anyone else." He explained that the
innovation in shrinking Dickens was

in coordinating the existing technol
ogy, using a computer program to
ensure precise timing and spacing
of the electron beam. The beam
was directed by means of more
magnets, much as a light micro
scope beam is focused and directed
by lenses and prisms. To avoid
blurring of the letters, a "blanking
plate" was used to abruptly inter
