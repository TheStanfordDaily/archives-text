"Along With Youth:
Hemingway, the Early Days"
Peter Griffen
Oxford University Press, 1985
Peter Griffen takes the title of his
book on Ernest Hemingway's early
years from a poem that Hemingway
wrote in 1922, just after moving to
Paris; . .Piles of old
magazines/Drawers of boys' let
ters/And the line of love/They must
have ended some
where./ Yesterday's Tribune is
gone/Along with youth/And the
canoe that went to pieces on the
beach/The year of the big
storm/When the hotel burned
down/At Seney, Michigan."
The title of the book is "Along
With Youth," and anyone who is
familiar with the Nick Adams
stories of life in northern Michigan
or with Hemingway's first novel, "A
Farewell to Arms," about love on
the Italian front in World War I, will
especially appreciate the sensitivity
and insight of Griffen's book.
Griffen ends his well-researched
account at the moment when
Hemingway and his first wife Had
ley Richardson are embarking for
Paris, where the author would soon
do some of his finest writing,
writing inspired largely by the
events in Hemingway's life des
cribed in this book. In Griffen's
mind and, as the poem suggests, in
Hemingway's, this signified the
"end of something." By carefully
circumscribing his book with the
events of Hemingway's birth in Oak
Park, 111. in 1899 and his departure
for Paris in 1922, Griffen can focus
on the vitality and the melancholy,
the idealism and the sense of ad
venture, the ambition and the
love(s) that were Hemingway's in
those first 23 years.
"Along With Youth" conveys with
technical skill the energy that made
those early years worth writing
about, but more importantly with
sympathy for the pains and admira

tion for the genius of the young
writer. Griffen is wholly uncritical
of Hemingway's life and work. The
volume contains five previously un
published short stories which are
effectively interspersed throughout
the text, and for the most part Grif
fen allows these stories and the
numerous correspondences he has
carefully chosen to speak for them
selves. In letters attentively crafted
to satisfy those to whom he wrote,
Hemingway reveals various aspects
of his character to his mother,
father, best friend, first love and
fiancee.
Hemingway's mother Grace was
possessive, jealous and demanding
of his love. In his letters, the son
betrays a desire to simultaneously
prove himself a man and remain
"mother's little yellow-headed
laddie." His father Clarence, who
never let go of the illusion that he
and his son were the "chums" they
had been in years past, demanded
something else from the young cub
reporter and war-time ambulance
driver, and Hemingway all too
readily indulged his father with let
ter after letter of success and good
times. Both parents were proud
when Hemingway returned from
Italy a war hero, and both were ac
cordingly upset whenever he men
tioned his current "girl."
It is primarily through letters to
Bill Home, longtime friend and con
fidant, that we learn the depth of
Hemingway's pain when he is jilted
by his first "true" love, Agnes
Kurowsky, an American nurse who
tended his physical and emotional
needs in Italy, but sent him back to
the states with only empty prom
ises. It took quite a while for the
young man to overcome this jolt,
but when he did, it was due
primarily to the attention, and this
time true love, of his wife to be,
Richardson.
Richardson encouraged Hem
inway and stroked his ego with
out dangerously overdoing the
sympathy. She encouraged him in
his writing, in their plans for mar
riage and in his plans to live in

Europe. The final chapters of the
book are ripe with selections from
the correspondence Richardson and
Hemingway shared in the nine
months before their marriage —
nine months which produced over
1,000 pages. The letters Griffen
has selected reveal more about
Richardson than about Hemingway,
but through them the nature and
importance of the relationship
becomes clear.
The emphasis throughout "Along
With Youth" is on the personal side
of Hemingway's writing. Griffen is
meticulously detailed — perhaps
even more so than Carlos Baker's
biography, widely considered to be
the definitive one on Hemingway.
Griffen's work leaves most people
wondering what he could have left
out. But his book focuses on the
young Hemingway, and it holds to
gether well, the details bringing us
closer to Hemingway the person
and artist.
The book will be most interesting

to those who know and appreciate
Hemingway's writings about this
period in his life (stories like:
"Indian Camp,""The Three Day
Blow," "Up in Michigan" and"The
Big Two-hearted River"), or to
those who already know something
about the rest of Hemingway's life.
It provides insight into what
became of the young adventurer
and budding writer; yet it is also a
good introduction to his style of
writing and to the latest research
about his life.
The notes at the end of the book
are more analytical than the text it
self. They indicate to just what
lengths Griffen has gone in examin
ing Hemingway's early years. Grif
fen writes in a direct, one could say
"Hemingwayesque" style; his ex
tensive research and apparent iden
tity with the writer has produced a
refreshing, enjoyable and in
formative book which sheds new
light on a fairly well-worn but obvi
ously not-yet-exhausted subject.
