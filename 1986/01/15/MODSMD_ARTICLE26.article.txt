"Astaire Dancing"
John Mueller
Knopf, New York, 1985
Rudolf Nureyev once called
Fred Astaire "the greatest
American dancer of all time."
Merce Cunningham did, too. So
did Balanchine. It is not surprising
then, to encounter a book such
as John Mueller's "Astaire Danc
ing" which insists, also, that As
taire is the greatest dancer in the
history of American dance.
"Astaire Dancing" is a full
size, "coffee-table" volume
which covers Astaire's movie
choreography from "Dancing
Lady" in 1933 to the 1969 film
adaptation of "Finian's Rain
bow. " It is, as Mueller states in
his introduction, an "attempt to
discover, analyze and evaluate
Astaire's contribution" to the
Hollywood movie musical. Muel
ler's "attempt" consists of an ex
amination of Astaire's 31
movies, centering around the
choreography of the dances.
Following the introduction,
each chapter of the book is dedi
cated to the scene-by-scene
analysis of an Astaire movie mu
sical. The plot summaries and
dance descriptions are accompa
nied by movie stills and frame
enlargements of important
scenes in the films (the latter are
annoyingly small and blurry, and
tend to disrupt and obscure
Mueller's narrative). Mueller
does not pretend to present an
unbiased analysis of Astaire's
work; the result is an effusive
"technical biography" of the dan
cer, in which what Astaire does
vastly overshadows who Astaire
was.
Astaire, we learn, was "self

effacing around his talented
sister Adele" and was "never
satisfied, constantly practicing
and struggling," but otherwise,
he remains a shadowy figure.
His presence in the book is lim
ited to his choreography and a
few anecdotes of his working
relationships with his female co
stars; this scarcity of personal
information about the dancer
tends to make him seem more a
myth, less a man.
In his writing, Mueller at
tempts to distance himself from
his obvious admiration of As
taire. Personal anecdotes and in
formation are confined to the
margins and footnotes while the
focus rests on the plots and
dances of the movies. The prob
lem with this is that the plots of
the Astaire movies are, for the
most part, inane. We like Astaire
movies not for the orginality of
plot or the context of his dances,
but for Astaire, and the dances
themselves. The wonder of
these films is the way in which
the magnificence of Astaire's
dance technique and choreog
raphy blends with — and over
compensates for — the con
trived plots. The movie scripts
are too trivial — aside from
their significance as trivia — to
hold our attention and interest.
Mueller seems to get lost in
his own analysis of Astaire's con
tribution to dance. His detailed
(movement by movement by
movement by. . .) descriptions
of each scene and dance are al
most indeterminable and in no
way complement the fluidity of
the films themselves. "Astaire
Dancing" is exhaustive — and fi
nally exhausting. If Mueller is out
to prove that Astaire is the
greatest American dancer ever,
maybe he should look around and
see no one's asking for proof.
