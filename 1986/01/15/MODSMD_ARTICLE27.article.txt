"Amusing Ourselves to Death"
Neil Postman
Viking, 1985
A friend happened to bump into me while I was in the
middle of reading this book, and when she saw the title
on the spine, she became inordinately enthusiastic,
asking me what the book was about. "It must be pretty
exciting," she said.
When I told her the book was about the influence of
television on American culture, the glint of intellectual
discovery left her eyes: "Oh, another one of those
books."
The problem with Neil Postman's book is reflected
by this little encounter I had with my friend. The title is
very juicy, promising, even morbid; the subject matter
is in another realm altogether. Are the bookshelves of
America really ready for yet another scathing analysis
of the mindlessness said to be perpetrated every
second by the boob tube?
Postman obviously thinks they are. "There is no
shortage of critics who have observed and recorded
the dissolution of public discourse in America and its
conversion into the arts of show business," he writes.
"But most of them, I believe, have barely begun to tell
the story of the origin and meaning of this descent into
a vast triviality."
What makes Postman's examination of this
"triviality" original — or so he insists on having us
believe — is that he bases it not on George Orwell's
"1984," which visualizes us destroyed by outside
forces that make us prisoners to an alien way of life,
but on a "slightly less known, equally chilling" futurism,
as posited in Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World."
Huxley's vision, according to Postman, was that
"people will come to love their oppression, to adore
the technologies that undo their capacities to think."

Huxley wanted to communicate that "what afflicted
(the characters in his novel) was not that they were
laughing instead of thinking, but that they did not know
what they were laughing about and why they had
stopped thinking."
Postman takes this forced antithesis between the
Orwellian and Huxleyan views of the future and
threads it as a metaphor throughout an elaborate his
torical essay about the influence of technology on the
exchange of information. His essential argument can be
boiled down to a single sentence: The printed word,
which we should equate with higher learning and

rationality, is being rapidly and inevitably supplanted by
the telecast image, which we should equate with the
lowest form of culture, entertainment.
Postman devotes a great deal of his essay to this
analysis. He is almost nostalgic when he refers to what
he calls "The Age of Exposition," a time when
Americans thought nothing about standing around for
seven hours on end listening to a pair of politicians
orate from prepared texts.
It was also a time when the sheer unavailability of
other forms of communication helped the printed word
monopolize the realm of public discourse. Thus,
Postman says, the public in that age was necessarily an

informed, rational, intellectual conglomeration of
people, since the word is nothing if not a conveyor of
meaning, and "meaning demands to be understood."
The end of this condition came about with the advent
of three technologies: the telegraph, the photograph
and their marriage in television. All three inventions
have contributed, each more insistently than the last,
to the gradual demise of context, meaning and reason
in the arena of public communication, according to
Postman. He dubs the result "The Age of Show Busi
ness."
Postman is at his best when he is presenting impres-

sionistic evidence about the small things television
does to divest information of its significance. His at
tacks on the television news industry are particularly
cogent. Pointing out that the primary purpose of the
television news broadcast is not to inform, but to pla
cate, he paints an alarming picture of the way
newscasters follow film footage of a bombing with a
commercial for tampons, so as to throw information out
of its context. Television's ultimate purpose, Postman
says, is to assure viewers that nothing they see on the
screen is cause for anything but the most momentary
concern.
But the strength of these impressions falls flat when

they are used as a springboard for generalizing televi
sion's influence into more than it really is. 1 he valiance
of Postman's struggle to show that our society is nfr-.
perceptibly dissolving into a confederation of mes
merized, unthinking zombies is largely lost on the
reader, partly because the evidence just isn t there for
that kind of grand-scale generalization, and partly be
cause Postman comes off in the process as a holier-,
than-thou prophet who fundamentally underestimates
his audience's intelligence.
Nobody can argue with the gist of Postman s impres
sions. There is also a great deal of urgency in his argu
ments and elegance in his language that make;s
"Amusing Ourselves to Death" interesting reading.
But the problem arises when readers try to reconcile
themselves to the conclusions Postman makes.
Were television something that could easily h'e
reduced to rational debate, and were it something
about which one could arrive at ready conclusions,
Postman's analysis would probably make more sens£
than it does. But the fact that Postman's own conclu
sions are merely waffling and hesitant only points up the
fact that television is a highly impressionistic medium,
both in terms of what it purveys and in terms of what
reactions it engenders in the public mind.
Postman's book is useful in arousing the kind of free:
floating anger any medium as influential as television
should stir up once in a while. But the author succumbs
to a condition similar to that for which he indicts Amen*
can society. He fails to transcend the images of futility
he presents so convincingly. X
Postman becomes as momentarily impressive arid
looming as the television set he attacks. If his ar
guments had something other than their own impres
sionistic luminescence upon which to stand, Postman
might have a work of some importance. But, just as the
TV viewer forgets everything he sees on the nightly
news an hour later, the arguments Postman presents
eventually fade into the background along with the rest
of the "TV is evil" literature that has been dispensed
with such regularity over the past 35 years.

(the characters in his novel) was not that they were
laughing instead of thinking, but that they did not know
what they were laughing about and why they had
stopped thinking."
Postman takes this forced antithesis between the
Orwellian and Huxleyan views of the future and
threads it as a metaphor throughout an elaborate his
torical essay about the influence of technology on the
exchange of information. His essential argument can be
boiled down to a single sentence: The printed word,
which we should equate with higher learning and

rationality, is being rapidly and inevitably supplanted by
the telecast image, which we should equate with the
lowest form of culture, entertainment.
Postman devotes a great deal of his essay to this
analysis. He is almost nostalgic when he refers to what
he calls "The Age of Exposition," a time when
Americans thought nothing about standing around for
seven hours on end listening to a pair of politicians
orate from prepared texts.
It was also a time when the sheer unavailability of
other forms of communication helped the printed word
monopolize the realm of public discourse. Thus,
Postman says, the public in that age was necessarily an

informed, rational, intellectual conglomeration of
people, since the word is nothing if not a conveyor of
meaning, and "meaning demands to be understood."
The end of this condition came about with the advent
of three technologies: the telegraph, the photograph
and their marriage in television. All three inventions
have contributed, each more insistently than the last,
to the gradual demise of context, meaning and reason
in the arena of public communication, according to
Postman. He dubs the result "The Age of Show Busi
ness."
Postman is at his best when he is presenting impres-

sionistic evidence about the small things television
does to divest information of its significance. His at
tacks on the television news industry are particularly
cogent. Pointing out that the primary purpose of the
television news broadcast is not to inform, but to pla
cate, he paints an alarming picture of the way
newscasters follow film footage of a bombing with a
commercial for tampons, so as to throw information out
of its context. Television's ultimate purpose, Postman
says, is to assure viewers that nothing they see on the
screen is cause for anything but the most momentary
concern.
But the strength of these impressions falls flat when

they are used as a springboard for generalizing televi
sion's influence into more than it really is. 1 he valiance
of Postman's struggle to show that our society is nfr-.
perceptibly dissolving into a confederation of mes
merized, unthinking zombies is largely lost on the
reader, partly because the evidence just isn t there for
that kind of grand-scale generalization, and partly be
cause Postman comes off in the process as a holier-,
than-thou prophet who fundamentally underestimates
his audience's intelligence.
Nobody can argue with the gist of Postman s impres
sions. There is also a great deal of urgency in his argu
ments and elegance in his language that make;s
"Amusing Ourselves to Death" interesting reading.
But the problem arises when readers try to reconcile
themselves to the conclusions Postman makes.
Were television something that could easily h'e
reduced to rational debate, and were it something
about which one could arrive at ready conclusions,
Postman's analysis would probably make more sens£
than it does. But the fact that Postman's own conclu
sions are merely waffling and hesitant only points up the
fact that television is a highly impressionistic medium,
both in terms of what it purveys and in terms of what
reactions it engenders in the public mind.
Postman's book is useful in arousing the kind of free:
floating anger any medium as influential as television
should stir up once in a while. But the author succumbs
to a condition similar to that for which he indicts Amen*
can society. He fails to transcend the images of futility
he presents so convincingly. X
Postman becomes as momentarily impressive arid
looming as the television set he attacks. If his ar
guments had something other than their own impres
sionistic luminescence upon which to stand, Postman
might have a work of some importance. But, just as the
TV viewer forgets everything he sees on the nightly
news an hour later, the arguments Postman presents

"Amusing Ourselves to Death"
Neil Postman
Viking, 1985
A friend happened to bump into me while I was in the
middle of reading this book, and when she saw the title
on the spine, she became inordinately enthusiastic,
asking me what the book was about. "It must be pretty
exciting," she said.
When I told her the book was about the influence of
television on American culture, the glint of intellectual
discovery left her eyes: "Oh, another one of those
books."
The problem with Neil Postman's book is reflected
by this little encounter I had with my friend. The title is
very juicy, promising, even morbid; the subject matter
is in another realm altogether. Are the bookshelves of
America really ready for yet another scathing analysis
of the mindlessness said to be perpetrated every
second by the boob tube?
Postman obviously thinks they are. "There is no
shortage of critics who have observed and recorded
the dissolution of public discourse in America and its
conversion into the arts of show business," he writes.
"But most of them, I believe, have barely begun to tell
the story of the origin and meaning of this descent into
a vast triviality."
What makes Postman's examination of this
"triviality" original — or so he insists on having us
believe — is that he bases it not on George Orwell's
"1984," which visualizes us destroyed by outside
forces that make us prisoners to an alien way of life,
but on a "slightly less known, equally chilling" futurism,
as posited in Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World."
Huxley's vision, according to Postman, was that
"people will come to love their oppression, to adore
the technologies that undo their capacities to think."

Huxley wanted to communicate that "what afflicted
(the characters in his novel) was not that they were
laughing instead of thinking, but that they did not know
what they were laughing about and why they had
stopped thinking."
Postman takes this forced antithesis between the
Orwellian and Huxleyan views of the future and
