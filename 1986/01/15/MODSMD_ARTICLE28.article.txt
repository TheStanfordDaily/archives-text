## Winning is secondary Underdog Card Takes On Fresno 
### PETER CASTILLO Staff writer 
Cast once again in the role of the
underdog, the Stanford wrestling
team travels to Fresno State
tonight, and while winning the dual
meet would be nice, what is more
important to wrestling Coach Chris
Horpel is the individual perfor
mances of the eight Cardinal ath
letes competing.
With the Cardinal in a hole from
the outset — the team will be
forced to forfeit two matches
tonight — it's not hard to explain
Horpel's attitude.
"It (tonight's dual meet) is going
to be like Bakersfield," Horpel said,
referring to the Cardinal's 41-8 loss
to the Roadrunners Saturday.
Going into the match, "Jeff Bradley
(142 pounds) is the only one who
has done better than his opponent,"
Horpel added.
The Cardinal will forfeit two
matches against the Bulldogs, as
Mason Gomez is still not ready to
compete at 118 pounds, and Kurt
Kassulke will move down from his
heavyweight position to 190 pounds
because Horpel feels uncomfortable
with him wrestling the Fresno
heavyweight, a 280-pounder.
Gomez will be ready to compete
in the Southern California Duals at
Fullerton this weekend. Terry
Mclntyre, the regular 190-pounder,
will not compete to allow Kassulke
to wrestle.
A key match-up tonight is at 177
pounds, with Stanford's Dave Lee

facing his long-time nemesis Fred
Little. Over the past two years, the
two have had many memorable
battles, with Little holding the edge
in victories. At last year's NCAA
Championship, Little defeated Lee
to prevent Lee from earning Ail-
American honors.
Lee, a sophomore, is having an
other fine season and, like last
year's successful campaign, his
trademark has been consistency.
Horpel praised Lee for winning all
the matches where he was favored
and for scoring upset victories over
some good wrestlers.
"If Lee has a weakness, it is
coming up with the big points with
little time left. He is excellent with
setting up his opponent perfectly
and scoring, but with time running
out, you do not have the time to do
that," Horpel said.
Another wrestler who is having
an outstanding year is Pete Rogers
158 pounds). He faces the Bulldogs'
Doug Carnation, who has given
Rogers problems in the past.
"Pete needs to refine what he
does well. He is not the person to
learn a new repertoire. His
strengths are his mental toughness
and his physical strength," Horpel
said.
Kassulke, by moving down to
190 pounds, will face John O'Brian.
Kassulke has beaten O'Brian
before, but O'Brian won in their last
meeting.
Other than these four wrestlers,
Horpel said he feels the Cardinal
would have to wrestle way over its
head to have a chance to win.


Stanford's Pete Rogers (158 pounds) has been one of the few
bright spots on the Cardinal wrestling team this year. In addition
to his physical strength, Rogers was praised by Coach Chris

Horpel for his mental toughness. In tonight's match against
Fresno, Rogers will have a rematch with the Bulldogs' Doug
