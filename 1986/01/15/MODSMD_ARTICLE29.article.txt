# Lanky Lonborg Became a Big Star

### BRENDAN HEALEY Staff writer 
In the 1963 Stanford baseball handbook, there's a
little passage that reads, "Coach (Dutch) Fehring feels
Jim (Lonborg) has a real future in baseball."
Well, Coach Fehring, you were half right, because
not only did Lonborg have a future in baseball but also
one outside of sports.
After a 15-year career in professional baseball, the
San Luis Obispo native entered the Tufts Dental
School in 1980 and now has his own dental practice.
When Lonborg entered Stanford, a dental practice
was probably a more realistic goal for the biology major
than a lengthy career with the Boston Red Sox, Mil
waukee Brewers and Philadelphia Phillies.
After graduating from San Luis Obispo High School,
"I really wasn't a top-line athlete," Lonborg said. He
came to Stanford on an academic scholarship and as a
lanky 6-foot-5 freshman hoped to make a name for him
self in basketball.
When chances for playing on the basketball team

looked slim, Lonborg put his height to another use.
â€” <**1 ended up going out for the baseball team, and
everything started to fall into place," Lonborg said.
"A lot of baseball players who are tall and lanky like
Jim was, turn into good pitchers because of the way
they're built. Throwing a baseball you have to have a
lot of leverage," former Stanford assistant baseball
coach Billy Alhouse said.
After a year on the freshman team, Lonborg was
promoted to the varsity, where he compiled a 3-3
record as a sophomore and averaged better than a
strikeout per inning.
The Stanford Hall of Famer continued to develop,
and, as a junior, he notched seven wins against six
losses. Lonborg boasted a sterling 1.89 earned run
average in addition to leading Stanford in wins and
strikeouts. His 1963 total of 114 strikeouts is the third
highest one-season total in Stanford history.
"Being able to pitch in Sunken Diamond was a great
thrill," Lonborg said. He added that very few batters
were able to power the ball out of a then-fenceless
Sunken Diamond.
'"He was just outstanding, the type of pitcher every

coach dreams about," Alhouse said. "He was always
our stopper. He had great control, a good curveball and
his fastball was adequate. He was a very intelligent
pitcher."
While good, Lonborg's Stanford stats were not in
dicative of the talent that would help him win 157 major
league games, and it was not until the summer after his
junior year that his abilities became evident.
"My skills weren't really developed at that time,"
Lonborg said of his college career. "I really had
thoughts of going on to medical school, but I started to
mature and got in some good summer leagues."
It was after playing in a South Dakota league during
the summer of 1963 that Lonborg decided to try his
fortune in the play-for-pay leagues.
"They offered me some money, so I took it,"he
said.
"The scouts were very high on him after the sum
mer," former Stanford freshman coach and varsity as
sistant Ray Young said. "I don't think there was any
doubt in my mind or his mind that he would go back to
school and finish.
"In Jim's case, I don't think there's any doubt he

made the right decision," Young added.
Lonborg earned his degree in 1965, which was also
his rookie year with the Red Sox. He posted a 9-17
record that season and came back with a 10-10 tally in
1966.
For Lonborg and his Red Sox teammates, what they
accomplished during the summer of 1967 was the
"Impossible Dream."
"The highlight was being with the Boston Red Sox in
1967 when we won the American League Champion
ship," Lonborg said. "I ended up winning the Cy Young
award."
Lonborg led the American League in both wins (22)
and strikeouts (246). In the World Series against the
St. Louis Cardinals, he won Game Two with a one
hitter and came back to take Game Five with a three
hitter.
Lonborg's winning streak was broken in Game
Seven, though, as he was beaten by the Cardinals' star
hurler, Bob Gibson.
If Lonborg had a dream season in 1967, the off-
