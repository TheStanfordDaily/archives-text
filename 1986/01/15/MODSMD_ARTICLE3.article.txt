# ASSU Supports Police Commission
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
The ASSU last night passed a resolution that
supports the establishment of a permanent
police review commission to examine the actions
of the Stanford Police Department.
Passed with no dissenting votes and one
abstention, this resolution does not formally es
tablish the commission but rather calls for one to
be formed in conjunction with the University, ac
cording to Senate Chair Carey White.
The resolution was proposed by the special in
vestigative committee formed on Nov. 5 to in
vestigate the charges of alleged police brutality
following the 0ct.,11 airest of nine students at
Old Union protesfmg'TTmversity investments in
South Africa.
The ASSU also voted to charge the special in
vestigative committee to find an outside inves
tigator and do any fund raising necessary to con
tinue looking into the alleged police brutality.
The police review commission would have to
be a formal body of the University, White
stressed. Composed of faculty, students, staff,
workers and administrators, it would be a stand-

ing body with which aggrieved parties could file
complaints, according to the resolution.
White was optimistic about the University's
response to the proposal. "Stanford usually has
good judgment. I think they'll do the right thing,"
he said.
The other passage introduced by the ASSU
special investigative committee — the proposal
to find an outside investigator to pursue the
charges of police brutality against student
protestors — passed by a vote of 13-1 with
three abstentions.
"The committee is hoping to uncover things
that were not fully examined in the Kaplan
report" in commissioning an outside inves
tigator, said White.
Prepared by Law Prof. John Kaplan at the re
quest of University President Donald Kennedy,
the report examined the events of Oct. 11 and
has been subject to charges of bias.
The value of a report by an outside inves
tigator is that it will provide another viewpoint,
according to White.
The senate currently is planning to pay for the
investigation through fund raisers and not out of
the ASSU treasury.

The senate also approved a $3,000 fee for
Alex Haley, author of "Roots," who is scheduled
to speak on campus March 5.
In other action, the senate voted to "reaffirm
its position that participation of the Association
. . . in the proposed Coffee House Task Force
would not be an effective means of ensuring
genuine student control over the operation of the
Tresidder Coffee House."
The task force was designed to explore ways
in which student involvement in the Saga-run
Coffee House could be improved. The senate,
however, does not feel that its role in the pro
posed task force entails decision-making and
does not wish to participate, White said.
Th& senate approved the purchase of an
espresso machine for the Espresso Bar, a
student-run alternative to the Coffee House set
up last quarter.
Also in last night's meeting, the senate ap
pointed six new members to the steering com
mittee. Larry Bloch, Walter Sosnowski, Dave
Smolen, Mary Thruber, Richard Beigel and Jim
DeLaHunt will join the advisory committee to
the senate chair.
