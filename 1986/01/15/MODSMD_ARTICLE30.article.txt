# New Drug Rule Passes
## Stanford votes against the measure 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer With wire reports 
! Stanford was one of just a handful
Of schools to vote against a new
drug-testing measure on the final
day of the NCAA's 80th annual con
vention in New Orleans yesterday.
The rule will force college ath
letes to submit to drug tests at foot
ball bowl games and NCAA cham
pionships. The players will be
checked for both "street drugs" and
performance-enhancing sub-
Stances, and if they test positive,
they will lose their eligibility for a
minimum of 90 days.

coach and athletic director at the

"very pleased and quite surprised
that it passed with such an over
whelming majority, based on some

people who have expressed con
cern over it because of constitu
tional rights, individual rights.

dividual rights was Stanford's dele
gate at the convention, Athletic
Director Andy Geiger. Geiger has
long been an opponent of drug test
ing in college sports, and his
njaverick stance at the convention
was not a surprise.

tative Jack Friedenthal, who also at
tended the convention, could be
reached for comment last night.
Earlier this year, according to
Cardinal linebacker Matt Soderlund,
Geiger told the football team he
would do all he could to keep drug
testing away from the Farm.

"He gave us a little talk about it,
and explained why he was against
it," Soderlund said. "He said it
would never happen at Stanford."
"I'm against drug testing
myself," he added. "I feel there's
no reason to single out athletes. If

they're going to test athletes, why
don't they test the whole student
body as well?"
Yesterday's action, while
sometimes confusing, was not as
volatile as Monday, when Division I
institutions voted to retain stan
dardized test scores in a far
reaching new academic require
ment for freshmen. Some black
educators, maintaining that the
tests are racially discriminatory,
said they would "consider our op
tions."
"We will discuss legal action, and
we will discuss getting out of the
NCAA," said Joseph Johnson, pres
ident of Grambling and the sharpest
critic of the standardized tests.
The scandal-wracked Southwest
Conference failed to push through a
motion that would ban boosters
from recruiting on campus. Some
opponents had suggested that
boosters might enroll in a one-hour
night course to get around the rule.
"That's foolishness," said Hous
ton faculty representative Mike
Johnson. Johnson, after hearing his
measure attacked from all sides,
suggested that it be withdrawn.

of the convention came on a much
debated proposal to reduce from

pointment of most major football
schools, delegates rejected a pro
