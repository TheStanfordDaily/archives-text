# BEARS vs. Patriots
## Ditka Doesn't Like His Bears Disturbed 
### 
LAKE FOREST, 111. (AP) —
Coach Mike Ditka has this thing
about togetherness, and the best
way he can keep the Chicago
Bears together is to get them out
of town.
This time Ditka is taking the
National Football Conference
champions to the University of Il
linois for their early preparations
for the 20th Super Bowl against
the New England Patriots in New
Orleans on Jan. 26.
They will work out under a
newly inflated bubble that covers
Zuppke Field at Memorial

Stadium in Champaign.
Getting the team away from
home, away from the hoopla, has
become a Ditka trait.
In each of the past two weeks
he took the team to train in
Suwanee, Ga., outside Atlanta at

the Atlanta Falcons' training site.
"The (New York) Giants said
they didn't know why we were
leaving town," Ditka said. "The
(Los Angeles) Rams said they
didn't know why we were leaving
town."
Pointing to his head and trying
to hide a smirk, Ditka said, "Now
they know."
Whether going to Suwanee had
anything to do with it, the Bears
beat the Giants 21-0 in the
playoffs and followed with a 24-0

whipping of the Rams on Sunday for
the NFC title and the team's first
trip to the Super Bowl.
Years ago, when they didn't have
a training camp of their own, the
late owner and coach, George

Halas, would have the Bears do
their preseason training at St.
Joseph College in Rensselaer, Ind.
It was hot and humid, perfect
conditions to get young men in
shape for a gruelling football
season. It also helped keep the
players away from the bright lights
of the big city.
The Bears abandoned

Rensselaer in 1975 for Lake Forest
College where, in 1979, they
opened their new headquarters,
Halas Hall, on campus.
Two years of training in Lake
Forest was enough for Ditka. Hie
moved the summer training camp
to Platteville, Wis., in 1984, and the
Bears trained there again this past
season.
