# BEARS vs. Patriots
## Ditka Doesn't Like His Bears Disturbed 
### 
LAKE FOREST, 111. (AP) â€”
Coach Mike Ditka has this thing
about togetherness, and the best
way he can keep the Chicago
Bears together is to get them out
of town.
This time Ditka is taking the
National Football Conference
champions to the University of Il
linois for their early preparations
for the 20th Super Bowl against
the New England Patriots in New
Orleans on Jan. 26.
They will work out under a
newly inflated bubble that covers
Zuppke Field at Memorial

Stadium in Champaign.
Getting the team away from
home, away from the hoopla, has
become a Ditka trait.
In each of the past two weeks
he took the team to train in
Suwanee, Ga., outside Atlanta at

the Atlanta Falcons' training site.
"The (New York) Giants said
they didn't know why we were
leaving town," Ditka said. "The
(Los Angeles) Rams said they
didn't know why we were leaving
town."
Pointing to his head and trying
to hide a smirk, Ditka said, "Now
they know."
Whether going to Suwanee had
anything to do with it, the Bears
beat the Giants 21-0 in the
playoffs and followed with a 24-0
