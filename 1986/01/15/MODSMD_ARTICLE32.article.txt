# Berry's Leadership Has Awakened the Pats

FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) — New England Patriots
Coach Raymond Berry walked into the staff meeting
with an idea for a strange play. His coaches were
hardly instant believers.
"He said, 'I'm telling you, this play in this situation
could win us the game,' " assistant coach Les
Steckel.recalled yesterday. "We're all going,
'Huh?' "

The situation came up the next Sunday against
the Miami Dolphins here.
It was fourth down and less than a yard for a first
down. New England trailed 13-3 in the fourth quar
ter. Offensive tackle Steve "Big House" Moore
lined up his 295 pounds in the backfield, a la William
"The Refrigerator" Perry of the
Chicago Bears.
Mosi Tatupu took a handoff from
Steve Grogan and followed Moore.
Then Tatupu turned and flipped the
ball back to Grogan, who fired a 28-
yard scoring pass to Greg Haw
thorne. That shifted the momentum
toward the Patriots, who went on
to a 17-13 victory.
"It won us the game," Steckel
said.

Berry, criticized early in the
season for running a conservative
offense, has received much credit
for weaving a troubled team into a
united group after he succeeded the
fired Ron Meyer halfway through
last season.
His abilities to create and nurture
an offense after discarding last
season's single-back attack rarely
have been mentioned even though
he serves as his own offensive co
ordinator.
New England's early-season of
fensive problems make their
presence in the Super Bowl against

the Bears Jan. 26 amazing. The
Patriots were 2-3 after losing to
Cleveland in their fifth game.
Berry, who said when he becamfc
coach that it was the right time for
him to take the assignment, feels
there is a right time to do things. '
So the Patriots practice unortho
dox plays they don't use in the next
game because the proper situation
doesn't present itself. One of those
plays — Steckel mentioned a par
ticular one — may be unveiled in
New England's final game of the
season.
