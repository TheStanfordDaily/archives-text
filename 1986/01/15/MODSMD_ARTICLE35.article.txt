# Chicago Shuffles Into New Orleans
## 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) — The Chicago Bears, who can
carry a tune as well as a football, are scoring big
with their "Super Bowl Shuffle" record, tape and
video cassette.
The rap song — the No. 1 requested tune in
Chicago — is climbing Billboard magazine's top 100
pop record chart and the video manufacturer says
the cassette's a best-seller.
In the video, 24 uniformed Bears strut their stuff
and sing. Between spotlight solos, the rumbling
chorus goes like this:
"We are the Bears' shufflin' crew,
"Shufflin' on down, doin' it for you.
"We're so bad, we know we're good,
"Blowin' your mind like you knew we would."
"Shuffle" was taped weeks before the Bears
ensured their trip to the Super Bowl, and "we had a
lot of comments that we might be jinxing them,"
spokeswoman Gwyneth Lloyd at Red Label
Records of Chicago, which produced the song, said
yesterday.
"All that's been put to bed."
The Bears shut out both the New York Giants,
21-0, and the Los Angeles Rams, 24-0, on their way
to the National Football Conference championship
— an NFL first. They face the New England

Patriots in New Orleans Jan. 26. ;.;
Sales erf the 25-minute video are "unbelievable,'
Malik Ali, vice president of video-manufacturer Mal
jack Productions Inc., said yesterday.
Since Sunday, when the Bears clinched their
Super Bowl berth, requests have poured in —
30,000 on Monday alone, some from as far away as
New York, Ali said.
He said the idea came from Bears wide receiver
Willie Gault, who could not be reached yesterday
through the team or his agent in California.
Red Label has shipped nearly a million copies of
the record to regional distributors and plans to go
nationwide this week, Lloyd said.
Ali said about 180,000 cassettes have been sold
for $19.95 since "Shuffle" hit the market Dec. 23,
making it the area's all-time best-seller.
Half of Red Label's revenues will go to Chicago's
needy — partly through Mayor Harold Washington's
"Sharing It" food-drive program, said mayoral
spokeswoman Margaret Jones.
Lloyd did not return repeated phone calls seeking
further information on spending plans. Bears
spokesman Ken Valdiserri said he did not know how
"Shuffle" revenues would be distributed.
