Thatcher Defends Secretary
LONDON — After days of silence, Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher launched a sharp counterattack yesterday in an attempt to
quell one of the biggest political storms of her six-and-one-half years
in power.
Answering questions from Members of Parliament crowded into a
packed House of Commons, Thatcher strenuously defended her
beleaguered Trade and Industry Secretary Leon Brittan, who some
felt might be forced to resign after being accused of misleading Parli
ament while defending the government during a heated debate Mon
day.
After answering a series of barbed opposition questions, she had
succeeded in defusing the electric sense of anticipation in the cham
ber. Opposition Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock appeared content
not to press her, apparently saving his attack for today's full debate
on the affair, which traces its origins to differences within Thatcher's
Cabinet about the fate of a small British defense contractor,
Westland PLC.
Thatcher's statement was her first to Parliament since those dif
ferences erupted into a major political sensation Thursday
when her defense secretary, Michael Heseltine, resigned in protest,
leveling an unprecedented personal attack on her and her style of
government.
Heseltine accused Thatcher and Brittan of ganging up on him un
fairly to resist his plans for a consortium of European companies to
rescue Westland, the country's only producer of military helicopters,
from bankruptcy. It is widely believed that Thatcher and Brittan
prefer a rescue package offered by a subsidiary of the American
company, United Technologies.
Heavy Fighting in South Yemen
Heavy fighting was reported yesterday in South Yemen, the only
Marxist state in the Arab world, in what appeared to be an effort by a
staunchly pro-Soviet faction to put the country more firmly under
Moscow's influence.
Western embassies and shipping sources reported seeing bombing
raids, artillery and tank battles, shelling by gunboats in the harbor,
and street fighting between loyalist and rebel troops that continued
into the night. Algeria announced that one of its diplomats was killed
by the fighting.
Unconfirmed reports said President Ali Nasser Mohammed was
shot and critically wounded Monday by Deputy Prime Minister Ali
Ahmed Nasser Antar, one of four alleged leaders of the rigidly pro-
Moscow faction. South Yemen's state radio said Monday that Antar
and the three others had been executed, but the radio made no
broadcasts yesterday and Western diplomatic sources said there
were indications the four may still be alive and leading the coup at
tempt.
The prime minister of South Yemen, Haidar Abudakar Attas, was
in New Delhi yesterday, after calling off a planned visit to Peking. At
tas told reporters only that there was an "abnormal" situation in his
country and that "when the situation becomes normal we will
return."
South Yemen, one of the world's poorest countries, is strategi
cally situated on the southern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, with a
commanding position at the shipping channels connecting the Red
Sea and the Indian Ocean, opposite the Horn of Africa.
Privately, U.S. officials made it clear they preferred the incum
bent government, which has shown willingness to work with the con
servative Arab states, to the more radical faction attempting to over
throw it.
Civilian President in Guatemala
GUATEMALA CITY — In an emotional ceremony before an array
of international dignitaries, 43-year-old Vinicio Cerezo was in
augurated yesterday as the first civilian president of Guatemala in 16
years.
Cerezo, a populist-style Christian Democrat, took over the
presidency from Gen. Oscar Humberto Mejia Victores, the third
general to rule the country through coups and fraudulent elections
since 1978. Cerezo's presidency is an effort to break more than 30
years of military domination of Guatemalan politics that began with a
CIA-orchestrated coup in 1954.
"We are a people who were thrown out of our house, and today we
are going home," Cerezo said to wild cheers. "We are a people who
were denied expression and many of us were persecuted for telling
the truth. Today we have recuperated our voices as citizens."
As Mejia sat impassively in his formal military uniform, Cerezo
accused the previous government of corruption, incompetence and
human rights abuses. He said that he is inheriting a country that is
virtually bankrupt.
"It is true that we find our country in the worst condition that any
chief executive ever has found this nation," he said.
Guatemala is suffering its worst economic crisis since the Depres
sion years of the '30s, with about 50 percent unemployment, 30 per
cent inflation and a $3.5 billion foreign debt. Cerezo has said that he
needs about $300 million in aid during his first six months in office to
keep the country afloat.
The Reagan Administration had requested a two-year $90.9 mil
lion military and economic aid package for Guatemala pending the
election of a civilian president, but the entire federal budget is being
trimmed, and it is unclear how much aid Guatemala will receive now.
Lesotho Appeals to U.S., Britain
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The tiny kingdom of Lesotho
appealed yesterday to the United States and Britain to save it from
economic strangulation by a virtual blockade by South Africa.
Chief Leabua Jonathan, the prime minister of Lesotho, which is
surrounded by South Africa, sent urgent messages to President
Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher accusing
South Africa of imposing a "total embargo" on all goods, including
food, medicine and fuel. He asked for their help in reopening the bor
der.
In Maseru, the capital which is about 220 miles south of here,
grocery stores were running out of food, gasoline stations were
pumping their tanks dry and long lines of migrant workers, tourists,
hospital patients and others were waiting to enter South Africa.
Freight trains in and out of the country were halted, and cars and
trucks were crossing the border at the rate of one an hour — when
they were not being turned back.
South Africa, according to Jonathan, is attempting to punish
Lesotho for complaining to the U.N. Security Council about a
December raid, apparently by South African commandos, in which
nine persons were killed in Lesotho. He said it is also trying to dem
onstrate the economic dependence of neighboring black-ruled
countries on South Africa as talk grows again around the world of
pressuring its white minority government by imposing sanctions.
