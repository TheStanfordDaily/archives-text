# Soviets Position Flagship to Aid Khadafy

WASHINGTON â€” The Soviet Union has sta
tioned the flagship of its Mediterranean fleet in
Tripoli to help Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy
keep track of U.S. military movements and to
deter an American attack by standing close to
one prospective target, Pentagon officials said
yesterday.
Pentagon sources also disclosed yesterday
that two FA-18 fighters flew from aircraft carrier
USS Coral Sea to protect a U.S. reconnaissance
aircraft that encountered two Libyan jets over
international waters north of the Libyan capital of
Tripoli.
The flagship, a submarine tender packed with
radio gear, is part of an expanding electronic
eavesdropping and warning net that the Soviets
have been placing in the Mediterranean off the
Libyan coast, Administration officials said, at the
same time that President Reagan is strengthen
ing U.S. naval forces in the region.

Defense Department spokesman Robert Sims
volunteered some details yesterday on changes
in Soviet deployment of its ships off Libya, start
ing early this month. But he declined to link the
changes to Administration hints of military
retaliation against Libya after the terrorist at
tacks at the Rome and Vienna airports on Dec.
27.
White House and State Department spokes
men at the time tied the terrorist acts to Libya
and held out the possibility of a retaliatory strike.
Military leaders, following routine contingency
planning, mapped elaborate plans for bombing
Libya in case Reagan opted for military action,
with a terrorist training camp outside Tripoli
near the top of the list of potential targets.
Administration officials said the Soviets may
have seen a triple dividend in deploying a picket
line of ships off Libya and berthing a flagship in

the port of Tripoli, the Libyan capital: the ships
would provide intelligence on American activities
in the Mediterranean for both Moscow and
Tripoli, their presence might inhibit Reagan if he
were planning a military strike against Libya and
the Soviet Union would be helping an Arab client
state in a highly visible way.
Pentagon sources disclosed yesterday that
two FA-18 fighter jets scrambled from the deck
of the aircraft carrier USS Coral Sea to protect a
U.S. reconnaissance aircraft that encountered
two Libyan jets over international waters north
of the Libyan capital of Tripoli.
The incident, which occurred at midday Mon
day just beyond the Gulf of Sidra, represented
the first direct encounter between Libyan and
American forces in the volatile region in the
wake of the stepped-up U.S. campaign directed
at isolating the regime of Moammar Khadafy.
