# Senators Accused of Misusing Fund
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Republican
senators, including Pete Wilson of
California, are circumventing
federal election laws and violating
an Internal Revenue Service ruling
by spending money from a special
GOP campaign fund without paying
income taxes on it, the citizens
lobby Common Cause charged yes
terday.
Wilson acknowledged that he
used $52,400 from the fund
operated by the National Republi
can Senatorial Committee to pay for
such items as magazines, Spanish

lessons and a joke-writing service.
He said he did not report the money
to the IRS on the advice of attor
neys because it was spent on official
Senate business and is not consid
ered personal income.
The money came from a
multimillion-dollar fund that the
committee has operated with cam
paign donations since 1981 to help
defray office expenses of Republi
can senators. During the 1983-84
reporting period, the committee
paid out $1.4 million from the fund
to cover the expenses of 55

senators. Wilson claimed the
second-largest amount.
Common Cause President Fred
Wertheimer charged that Wilson
and other recipients of money from
the fund should have paid taxes on
it in compliance with a 1980 IRS
ruling. He said that at least two
other GOP senators, Paula Haw
kins of Florida and Chic Hecht of
Nevada, admitted they did not
report the money as income to the
IRS.
In addition, Wertheimer said the
fund has been used to circumvent a

law prohibiting party committees
from giving more than $17,500 in
direct campaign contributions to a
Senate candidate. He noted that
some senators used the money
from the fund to finance campaign
related activities such as purchasing
mailing lists.
David Narsavage, spokesman for
the senatorial committee, conceded
that some legal experts think
senators should pay taxes on the
money under existing IRS rules.
But he added that the committee's
attorneys do not share that opinion.
