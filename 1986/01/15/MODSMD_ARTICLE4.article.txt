# Police Seek Duo Concerning Cons
## 
### 
Stanford police are currently
investigating two cases of theft
in which students here were
tricked into giving money away.
Police are searching for two
black males who reportedly
asked students to borrow money
with "promises of immediate
restitution," according to Sgt.
Philip Love of the Stanford
police.
In one case, the men are said
to have taken money under the
pretense of needing assistance
to get their car towed.
One of the victims was ap
proached in the Escondido Vil
lage area and the other in the
area of Stern and Wilbur, Love
said. In one case, the men came

to the front door of a residence.
There is no evidence that
force or threat of force was used
in either incident, Love said.
Love, who is heading the in
vestigation, said he believes
similar crimes may have oc
curred but not been reported,
and warned the Stanford com
munity that the imposters may
strike again.
The method used by the men
has produced some good leads,
he said. "There's a good possi
bility that we will be able to iden
tify at least one within a week."
He asked that anyone ap
proached by strangers asking to
borrow money, or anyone with
information about these crimes,
call Stanford police at 497-9633.
