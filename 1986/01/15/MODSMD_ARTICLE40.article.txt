Antitrust Overhaul
WASHINGTON — President Reagan has
decided to ask Congress to overhaul the na
tion's antitrust laws to ease restrictions on
mergers, arguing that American businesses
need greater flexibility to respond to global
competition, Administration sources said yes
terday.
According to a memorandum by Treasury
Secretary James Baker 111, chairman of the
president's Economic Policy Council, the pres
ident has approved a five-point legislative pro
gram recommended by his chief economic ad
visers to change the antitrust laws, which gov
ern major areas of corporate activity.
The package, to be unveiled as part of the
president's 1986 legislative agenda, will in
clude a proposal to exempt import-battered in
dustries from antitrust restrictions on
mergers.
For other industries, another proposal
would limit the grounds on which courts can
block mergers.
Other proposed changes would severely
restrict the use of treble damage awards for vi
olations of antitrust laws, would allow greater
freedom to corporate directors to sit on the
boards of competing companies and would
sharply limit the ability of U.S. firms to file
antitrust suits against foreign corporations.
Court Upholds Rule
WASHINGTON —The Supreme Court
reaffirmed a century-long legal doctrine yes
terday requiring that a criminal conviction be

overturned if members of the defendant's race
were purposefully excluded from the grand
jury that indicted him.
In a 6-3 decision, the justices ordered
prosecuting authorities to retry or free Booker
Hillery Jr., a black former ranch hand con
victed of the brutal murder of a 15-year-old
Kings County, Calif., girl in 1962.
The court dealt a sharp setback to California
state officials who had sought an exception to
the long-standing rule when there was over
whelming evidence of guilt and the defendant
was deemed to have received a fair trial after
being indicted.
Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the
majority, cited a series of court precedents
back to 1880 that he said required Hillery's
conviction to be automatically overturned.
Three justices issued a sharp dissent,
saying that any flaws in the selection of grand
jurors who indicted Hillery represented
"harmless error" and that it was unfair to ex
pect the state could retry a case where wit
nesses have moved or died, evidence has been
lost and memories have faded.
Cocaine in Crash
WASHINGTON — Federal officials are in
vestigating the possibility that a form of
cocaine use involving fire caused the New
Year's Eve plane crash in Texas that killed
rock-and-roll star Rick Nelson and six other
people, sources said yesterday.
Both the pilot and the co-pilot, who survived
the crash, have told investigators that they at
tempted to land the plane after fire started in

the passenger cabin.
The sources said that preliminary toxicology
reports indicate that Nelson's body contained a
measurable level of unmetabolized cocaine,
which means the drug had not been absorbed
into the system at the time of death. They
stressed, however, that final written reports
from two toxicology laboratories are pending.
One of the theories investigators are
probing is that a fire started as a consequence
of cocaine free-basing and got out of control,
igniting the cabin.
SDI To Escape Cuts
WASHINGTON — The Defense Depart
ment has decided to protect President
Reagan's proposed "Star Wars" system of
space-based missile defense, but it will have to
shave funds for the MX missile and trim spend
ing devoted to military readiness, a defense of
ficial said yesterday.
The Administration will announce today the
specifics of the defense cuts it plans to put in
place March 1 under the Gramm-Rudman
balanced-budget law, which Congress enacted
last month. It will also reveal the broad
outlines of domestic spending reductions re
quired by the law.
