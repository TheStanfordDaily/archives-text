Examiner Editor Fired
SAN FRANCISCO — C. David Burgin,
editor of the San Francisco Examiner, has
been relieved of his duties by publisher William
Hearst 111, who said yesterday that he will
assume the title.
At a staff meeting, Hearst said that a series
of discussions had not resolved problems be
tween himself and Burgin, and he had decided
a change was necessary.
Hearst said he anticipates no changes in per
sonnel and no change in direction or editorial
course for the newspaper.
Rose Bird Replies
SAN FRANCISCO — Chief Justice Rose
Bird's supporters issued a 205-page reply yes
terday to the "Prosecutors' White Paper," a
centerpiece of her opponents' campaign,
saying it deliberately distorted the state Su
preme Court's record on the death penalty and
other issues.
A study by lawyers working for Bird's cam
paign committee said the document released
last May by the California District Attorneys
Association had misrepresented the decisions
of Bird and other justices, mis-stated facts in

numerous cases, and falsely accused the court
of excessive delays in death penalty cases.
Some of the criticisms could be described as
differences of opinion, but Bird's campaign also
found some factual errors in the prosecutors'
study — for example, one criticized case that
actually never reached the Supreme Court,
and two in which Bird's opinion conflicted with
the prosecutors' description.

'Star' Produced in Lab
LIVERMORE — Using a gigantic system of
lasers to produce fusion energy, scientists at

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
have come close to duplicating the tempera
tures and pressures at the centers of stars.
For a billionth of a second, the system
poured 100 trillion watts into a spot the size of
a pinpoint, producing more than twice the
entire electric generating capacity of the
United States, researchers said.
"We made a tiny little star," said Erik
Storm, director of the Livermore's Inertial
Confinement Fusion Program.
The successful firing of the huge "Nova"
battery of lasers last Thursday was the first in
a series of tests as researchers continue their
search for a way to use fusion energy to
generate electricity. Fusion energy is the
power that fuels stars in outer space.
