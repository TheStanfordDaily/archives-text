Slides of United States soldiers in battle
flashed on the screen as "Sympathy for the
Devil" by the Rolling Stones blared from a
tape player. A few minutes later, clips
depicting the '60s hippie culture appeared
as the lyrics from Jefferson Airplane's
song "White Rabbit" played in the back
ground.
Both scenes were part of "To Look for
America," a multi-media presentation given
by UC-Berkeley History Prof. Leon Lit
wack before more than 250 spectators last
night at Branner Hall.
Litwack, who began developing the pro-

duction during the '60s and shows it each
year in his classes at Berkeley, called the
production a "very impressionistic look at
American society from Hiroshima to
Woodstock."
"I wanted to make my students aware
that there are different ways of document
ing the past," Litwack said, adding that "in
its own way, (the presentation) has become
a kind of historical relic."
The production, utilizing two film projec
tors, one slide projector and a cassette tape
player, featured footage from television
newscasts and pictures from Life magazine.
Film footage and slides were presented si
multaneously, allowing Litwack to show
contrasts between conflicting interests of
the time.

The production included songs by Elvis
Presley, Simon and Garfunkel, The Who,
The Beatles and Bob Dylan, as well as ex
cerpts of speeches by figures ranging from
Joseph McCarthy to Martin Luther King, Jr.
One segment of the production jux
taposed pictures of blacks being beaten
during civil rights movements on one
screen with pictures of a white family in
front of a new house and car on another
screen.
Other parts included footage of the
McCarthy hearings, Woodstock, the war in
Vietnam and a 1964 protest at Berkeley.
Another part showed cartoons and televi
sion game shows from the period.
"It has become fashionable in recent
years to belittle the '60s, the excesses of

that era," Litwack said, adding that today
some feel "that the anti-war movement
made us soft and flabby."
"I don't agree with that assessment," he
said.
The student generation of the '60s
"perceived, perhaps better than most, an
enormous contradiction between the values
taught in schools and from families and the
reality of hunger, poverty and racism," Lit
wack said.
The student movement of the '60s was
"a much needed shot in the arm" to the so
cial and political situation of the times, he
said.
Litwack, however, refrained from
