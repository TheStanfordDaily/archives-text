# Where Does It All Come From?
## Tuition pays for less than one-half of operating expenses 
### KEN SAWYER Staff writer 
The following article is part one of a two-part
series on University finances. This first segment
will explore where the University obtains its reve
nue, while the second, scheduled to appear Jan.
22, will explore where this revenue is spent.
All of us who are tuition-paying students are
painfully aware of the source of a major portion
of Stanford's funding. Tuition and student fees
account for about 45 percent of the University's
income.
But there is another way that Stanford gains a
great deal of money to fund academic operations
that students often don't realize — gifts and be
quests.
In fact, last year more than 20 percent of the
funds Stanford used came from interest on gifts
that Stanford has accumulated since 1907. More
than 21 percent came from gifts and non
government grants that were earmarked for use
in 1984-85.
Much of the money Stanford received last year
could not be spent. Some of the money was not
"given (to Stanford) to be spent" but "endowed"

to the University, according to Rod Adams, the
treasurer of the University.
"Let's imagine that John Smith wants to
donate to Stanford University. If John Smith
says, 'I give this money to Stanford,' the money
is considered expendable and would go to fund
current operations. However, if John Smith
says, 'I endow this money to Stanford,' the
money is not expendable and would be invested
to earn income or returns which could then be
used to fund current operations of the Univer
sity," he said.
Stanford, like all major academic institutions,
doesn't just let the John Smiths of the world
come looking for it. Stanford solicits donors.
Category I: Living Individuals
The first type of donor Stanford looks for is
the "living individual." Every alumnus and cur
rent parent is solicited each year for a gift to the
University.
David Fulton, director of communication for
the Office of Development, said that each
prospective donor is solicited to give money to
the annual fund for the part of the University
with which he/she has the closest affinity.

"For example, if an alumnus went to the
Graduate School of Business, he would be asked
to give to that school's current fund," Fulton
said.
"A parent of a current student would be asked
to give to a fund for improving undergraduate
education." Last year, 43,800 donors of this sort
gave over $14 million to Stanford.
There are other "living individuals" who are
not asked to donate to an annual fund. Some
prospective donors are rated by the Office of
Development as being a prospect for a "major
gift."
Fulton explained that the staff at the Office of
Development is aware of the prospective donors
and that they often know a good deal about
them.
In some cases screeners estimate the income
of prospective donors."The sum of these
impressions allows the Office of Development to
rate a donor's ability to give," Fulton said.
These prospective donors are encouraged to
give a large, non-recurring gift of $100,000 or
more for a specific purpose — often an endowed
fellowship fund or scholarship fund, even a build-
ing on a rare occassion, according to Fulton.
Category II: Foundations and Corporations
The second category of donors involves
foundations and corporations. Through affiliate
programs, Stanford offers corporations the op
portunity to maintain a relationship with a depart
ment that is doing research in an area of the cor
poration's interest in exchange for money. Stan
ford receives support from over 1,100 corpora
tions. Over 350 corporations belong to an affiliate
program.
Corporations generally do not give money for
endowment, rather they give money that will go
directly into the current budget.
Foundations usually foster some type of pro
gram they have invented or work they want ad
vanced. For example, the Center for Arms Con
trol and Disarmament might receive money to
further the study of nuclear arms control. This
type of donation is usually made by a formal pro
posal. !
Category III: Bequests and Life Income
Gifts
The third category of donations includes be
quests and life income gifts. Many individuals
leave money for Stanford in their wills. The gifts
are designated for a variety of purposes.
Many gifts are used to further the study of a
particular medical disease, some support a
professorship in their name and others are of
ferred without restrictions and usually go into the
general endowment fund.
Surprisingly, more than half the money left to
Stanford in wills doesn't come from alumni.
Life income gifts are also made to Stanford. In
this case, a donor gives Stanford some property,
and University officials manage that asset and pay
the donor an income from it. When the donor or
designated recipient dies, Stanford gets to keep
the property.
There have been occasions when Stanford
received unusual gifts. Livestock, gems and sail
boats are not as uncommon as one might think.
Individuals frequently give books and journals for
the Stanford libraries, and every now and then art
will be donated for the Stanford museums.
The University is currently gearing up for a
centennial campaign and is hoping to garner over
$1 billion between the fall of 1986 and the fall of
1991.
So don't worry that after you graduate you will
never hear from your alma mater — the Office of
Development will surely drop a friendly letter or 'J
perhaps give you a call to see how you are doing.
Don't be too quick to condemn, though. If they
didn't "contact" people like you, Stanford tuition
might be over $20,000 per year.

portunity to maintain a relationship with a depart
ment that is doing research in an area of the cor
poration's interest in exchange for money. Stan
ford receives support from over 1,100 corpora
tions. Over 350 corporations belong to an affiliate
program.
Corporations generally do not give money for
endowment, rather they give money that will go
directly into the current budget.
Foundations usually foster some type of pro
gram they have invented or work they want ad
vanced. For example, the Center for Arms Con
trol and Disarmament might receive money to
further the study of nuclear arms control. This
type of donation is usually made by a formal pro
posal. !
Category III: Bequests and Life Income
Gifts
The third category of donations includes be
quests and life income gifts. Many individuals
leave money for Stanford in their wills. The gifts
are designated for a variety of purposes.
Many gifts are used to further the study of a
particular medical disease, some support a
professorship in their name and others are of
ferred without restrictions and usually go into the
general endowment fund.
Surprisingly, more than half the money left to
Stanford in wills doesn't come from alumni.
Life income gifts are also made to Stanford. In
this case, a donor gives Stanford some property,
and University officials manage that asset and pay
the donor an income from it. When the donor or
designated recipient dies, Stanford gets to keep
the property.
There have been occasions when Stanford
received unusual gifts. Livestock, gems and sail
boats are not as uncommon as one might think.
Individuals frequently give books and journals for
the Stanford libraries, and every now and then art
will be donated for the Stanford museums.
The University is currently gearing up for a
centennial campaign and is hoping to garner over
$1 billion between the fall of 1986 and the fall of
1991.
So don't worry that after you graduate you will
never hear from your alma mater — the Office of
Development will surely drop a friendly letter or 'J
perhaps give you a call to see how you are doing.
Don't be too quick to condemn, though. If they
didn't "contact" people like you, Stanford tuition
might be over $20,000 per year.
Summary of University Revenues
• 45% student tuition and fees
• 21% gifts and non-government grants ear
marked for immediate use
• 20% interest on resources "endowed" to the
University
• 4% miscellaneous
The following article is part one of a two-part
series on University finances. This first segment
will explore where the University obtains its reve
nue, while the second, scheduled to appear Jan.
22, will explore where this revenue is spent.
All of us who are tuition-paying students are
painfully aware of the source of a major portion
of Stanford's funding. Tuition and student fees
account for about 45 percent of the University's
income.
But there is another way that Stanford gains a
great deal of money to fund academic operations
that students often don't realize — gifts and be
quests.
In fact, last year more than 20 percent of the
funds Stanford used came from interest on gifts
that Stanford has accumulated since 1907. More
than 21 percent came from gifts and non
government grants that were earmarked for use
in 1984-85.
Much of the money Stanford received last year
could not be spent. Some of the money was not
"given (to Stanford) to be spent" but "endowed"

to the University, according to Rod Adams, the
treasurer of the University.
"Let's imagine that John Smith wants to
donate to Stanford University. If John Smith
says, 'I give this money to Stanford,' the money
is considered expendable and would go to fund
current operations. However, if John Smith
says, 'I endow this money to Stanford,' the
money is not expendable and would be invested
to earn income or returns which could then be
used to fund current operations of the Univer
sity," he said.
Stanford, like all major academic institutions,
doesn't just let the John Smiths of the world
come looking for it. Stanford solicits donors.
Category I: Living Individuals
The first type of donor Stanford looks for is
the "living individual." Every alumnus and cur
rent parent is solicited each year for a gift to the
University.
David Fulton, director of communication for
the Office of Development, said that each
prospective donor is solicited to give money to
the annual fund for the part of the University
with which he/she has the closest affinity.

"For example, if an alumnus went to the
Graduate School of Business, he would be asked
to give to that school's current fund," Fulton
said.
"A parent of a current student would be asked
to give to a fund for improving undergraduate
education." Last year, 43,800 donors of this sort
gave over $14 million to Stanford.
There are other "living individuals" who are
not asked to donate to an annual fund. Some
prospective donors are rated by the Office of
Development as being a prospect for a "major
gift."
Fulton explained that the staff at the Office of
Development is aware of the prospective donors
and that they often know a good deal about
them.
In some cases screeners estimate the income
of prospective donors."The sum of these
impressions allows the Office of Development to
rate a donor's ability to give," Fulton said.
These prospective donors are encouraged to
give a large, non-recurring gift of $100,000 or
more for a specific purpose — often an endowed
fellowship fund or scholarship fund, even a build-
ing on a rare occassion, according to Fulton.
