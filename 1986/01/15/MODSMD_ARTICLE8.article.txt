# What Encounters Uranus?
## Voyager team gears up for probe's visit to 7th planet 
### JAY FRY 
When Voyager II completes its rendezvous
with the planet Uranus later this month, a team
of Stanford researchers will have just begun to
analyze the data received from its on-board ex
periment.
The experiment uses radio waves to investi
gate the Uranian ring system, the planet's at
mosphere and the distribution of mass for
Uranus and its satellites, according to Electrical
Engineering Prof. G. Leonard Tyler, leader of
the Stanford-designed Voyager Radio Science
Investigation.
Unlike the other 10 experiments conducted on
Voyager 11, this one is unique because it "is not
exactly on-board," Tyler said.
Using Voyager ll's radio subsystem to trans
mit a signal, the project uses a process called
radio occultation to gather data about the
Uranian system. The spacecraft will perform the

experiments when it is nearest the planet on Jan.
24.
Using another radio signal, Voyager II will
then transmit the data back to three large receiv
ing antennas in Australia, over 2 billion miles
away.
Those signals will be sent by conventional
phone lines from Australia to the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory QPL) in Pasadena where the scien
tists are based.
The radio occultation experiment includes re
searchers from JPL as well as Stanford. At the
University, Tyler and Electrical Engineering
Prof. Von Eshleman are the principal inves
tigators studying the radio signals. They work
with a small group of associates and students at
Stanford's Space Telecommunications and
Radioscience Laboratory (STARLAB).
Tyler, who says the team has been preparing
for Voyager's encounter with Uranus since

February 1984, calls the project a "major experi
ment."
"The Uranian system is a new class of
planetary body we haven't visited before," said
Tyler. Uranus and Neptune are "quite different"
from both the terrestrial planets, such as Earth
and Mars, and the gas giants, such as Jupiter and
Saturn.
Uranus, the blue-green seventh planet in the
solar system, is surrounded by nine coal-black
rings and has a core of unknown composition and
a nearly horizontal axis of rotation. The unusual
orientation of the axis prevents Voyager II from
investigating the Uranian system as thoroughly
as it investigated Saturn.
After this month's encounter with Uranus,
Voyager II will continue on to an Aug. 25, 1989,
meeting with Neptune where the Stanford re
search team hopes to perform the same experi
ment.
