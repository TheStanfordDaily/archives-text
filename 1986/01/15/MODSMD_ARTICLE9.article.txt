# Collaborative Offers Three Designs for New Near West Campus
## 
### MARCUS MABRY 
The University is considering three pre
liminary designs for the redevelopment of a
41-acre region west of the Quad which cur
rently houses science and engineering labo
ratories and departments. A final plan is ex
pected in March.
Developed by the University with The
Architects Collaborative (TAC) of San
Francisco and Cambridge, the alternatives
for the Near West Campus "are now being
reviewed by a large number of faculty and
administrators," said Planning Director Phil

Williams.
"Right now, we're trying to generate a
large number of ideas," he said, emphasiz
ing that the purpose is not to choose one of
the three alternatives, but to join the most
desirable aspects of each into a cohesive
plan.
The three plans are:
Alternative A
Adjacent research and teaching buildings
would be built off a central plaza, with re
search in taller buildings on the perimeter
and teaching in lower structures fronting on
the plaza. The adjacent structures could be

connected by an interaction zone, such as
an atrium, that would encourage contacts
among undergraduates, graduates and fac
ulty. Buildings could be organized either by
departments or by function. The plaza
would contain a small amphitheater.
Alternative B
Individual buildings of various sizes and
shapes would be constructed off a
landscape framework that would provide
the unifying link to the region. This plan
would create a strong north to west link
from the heart of the biology and chemistry
area to Terman Engineering Center, and

eventually would eliminate Stauffer II in or
der to create a central plaza near Old
Chemistry. Buildings could be constructed
for teaching or research functions or organ
ized along departmental lines.
Alternative C
Buildings around a central podium would
be zoned vertically, with most undergradu
ate teaching on level one, departmental
offices and seminar rooms on level two, and
research and faculty offices on levels three,
four and five. The podium would be raised
15 feet above natural grade, putting the
main entrance to buildings at level two.

Buildings also could be entered at level
three from the upper level of a connecting
arcade.
A dozen faculty members from the sci
ence and engineering departments to be lo
cated in the renovated Near West Campus
are working closely with the planners.
The group, called FUTURES, is charged
with advising the planners of the project
"from its inception until the concrete is
poured and, hopefully, after the buildings
are open," said Applied Physics Prof.
Robert Byer, head of FUTURES.
