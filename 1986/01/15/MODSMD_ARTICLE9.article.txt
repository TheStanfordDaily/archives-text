# Collaborative Offers Three Designs for New Near West Campus
## 
### MARCUS MABRY 
The University is considering three pre
liminary designs for the redevelopment of a
41-acre region west of the Quad which cur
rently houses science and engineering labo
ratories and departments. A final plan is ex
pected in March.
Developed by the University with The
Architects Collaborative (TAC) of San
Francisco and Cambridge, the alternatives
for the Near West Campus "are now being
reviewed by a large number of faculty and
administrators," said Planning Director Phil

Williams.
"Right now, we're trying to generate a
large number of ideas," he said, emphasiz
ing that the purpose is not to choose one of
the three alternatives, but to join the most
desirable aspects of each into a cohesive
plan.
The three plans are:
Alternative A
Adjacent research and teaching buildings
would be built off a central plaza, with re
search in taller buildings on the perimeter
and teaching in lower structures fronting on
the plaza. The adjacent structures could be

connected by an interaction zone, such as
an atrium, that would encourage contacts
among undergraduates, graduates and fac
ulty. Buildings could be organized either by
departments or by function. The plaza
would contain a small amphitheater.
Alternative B
Individual buildings of various sizes and
shapes would be constructed off a
landscape framework that would provide
the unifying link to the region. This plan
would create a strong north to west link
from the heart of the biology and chemistry
area to Terman Engineering Center, and

eventually would eliminate Stauffer II in or
der to create a central plaza near Old
Chemistry. Buildings could be constructed
for teaching or research functions or organ
ized along departmental lines.
Alternative C
Buildings around a central podium would
be zoned vertically, with most undergradu
ate teaching on level one, departmental
offices and seminar rooms on level two, and
research and faculty offices on levels three,
four and five. The podium would be raised
15 feet above natural grade, putting the
main entrance to buildings at level two.

Buildings also could be entered at level
three from the upper level of a connecting
arcade.
A dozen faculty members from the sci
ence and engineering departments to be lo
cated in the renovated Near West Campus
are working closely with the planners.
The group, called FUTURES, is charged
with advising the planners of the project
"from its inception until the concrete is
poured and, hopefully, after the buildings
are open," said Applied Physics Prof.
Robert Byer, head of FUTURES.
The University planning committee,
which includes representatives from the
science and engineering departments, will
base its final recommendations to the ar
chitects on the suggestions of the faculty,
according to Williams.
Funding for the $250 million redevelop
ment of the science and engineering region
is expected to come from gifts to Stanford.
Donations finance most major University
projects, according to Williams.
Money for the planning process itself
comes from the University's operating
budget.
Ray Bacchetti, vice provost for manage
ment and the leader of the planning commit
tee, has estimated that 20 to 40 percent of

the total cost will come from a small num
ber of principal donors, 20 to 30 percent
from targeted efforts with individuals and
corporations, 5 to 10 percent from a
venture fund and 15 to 30 percent from
University funds.
A fund-raising strategy is currently being
developed, according to Williams.
Admitting that he considers cost a major
obstacle to realizing the project, Williams
stated that some aspects of the renovations
are "extremely urgent. Some of the smaller
buildings (in the existing science area) were
built for only temporary use. They don't
work well, and they're overcrowded."
One way to relieve the financial burden of
the Near West Campus is to plan for a 10-15
year construction period, thus allowing
funds to be amassed gradually, according to
Williams.
"One problem we're puzzling over now is

the process of logistics and sequencing,"
said John Hughes, a member of the planning
committee. The design selected must be
flexible enough so that construction can
proceed in nearly discrete stages, he said.
If funds run out, construction could then be
postponed with minimum disruption of the
overall plan.
An important factor in the final look of
Near West will be how that region joins in
architectural harmony with the Quad.
Since technical buildings "tend to get
larger and taller because of space require
ment for labs . . . (and) equipment," it will
be difficult "to maintain the warm character
of the Farm," said Williams, emphasizing
that preserving the "warm character" is a
priority.
Faculty members and administrators
agree that redevelopment of the science
region is necessary.

Byer explained, "There's a local need, an
urgent need for quality space. A number of
facilities (in the Near West Campus) are in
dustrial slums and were built over 30 years
ago and need to be replaced. On the na
tional level there is another need. Since the
federal government divorced itself from the
support of scientific and engineering re
search (in the private sector) 25 years ago,
many universities are suffering.
"Stanford is in the unique position to
make a statement by renovating and
rebuilding its facilities. It can alert the
country, as a whole, that rebuilding science
and engineering facilities is of national im
portance. Stanford has the opportunity to
be a leader," Byer said.
"It is unthinkable that [the redevelop
ment] won't be carried out. The conse
quences would be termination of research
across a number of departments," he said.

region is necessary.

Byer explained, "There's a local need, an
urgent need for quality space. A number of
facilities (in the Near West Campus) are in
dustrial slums and were built over 30 years
ago and need to be replaced. On the na
tional level there is another need. Since the
federal government divorced itself from the
support of scientific and engineering re
search (in the private sector) 25 years ago,
many universities are suffering.
"Stanford is in the unique position to
make a statement by renovating and
rebuilding its facilities. It can alert the
country, as a whole, that rebuilding science
and engineering facilities is of national im
portance. Stanford has the opportunity to
be a leader," Byer said.
"It is unthinkable that [the redevelop
ment] won't be carried out. The conse
quences would be termination of research
across a number of departments," he said.
The University is considering three pre
liminary designs for the redevelopment of a
41-acre region west of the Quad which cur
rently houses science and engineering labo
ratories and departments. A final plan is ex
pected in March.
Developed by the University with The
Architects Collaborative (TAC) of San
Francisco and Cambridge, the alternatives
for the Near West Campus "are now being
reviewed by a large number of faculty and
administrators," said Planning Director Phil

Williams.
"Right now, we're trying to generate a
large number of ideas," he said, emphasiz
ing that the purpose is not to choose one of
the three alternatives, but to join the most
desirable aspects of each into a cohesive
plan.
The three plans are:
Alternative A
Adjacent research and teaching buildings
would be built off a central plaza, with re
search in taller buildings on the perimeter
and teaching in lower structures fronting on
the plaza. The adjacent structures could be

connected by an interaction zone, such as
an atrium, that would encourage contacts
among undergraduates, graduates and fac
ulty. Buildings could be organized either by
departments or by function. The plaza
would contain a small amphitheater.
Alternative B
Individual buildings of various sizes and
shapes would be constructed off a
landscape framework that would provide
the unifying link to the region. This plan
would create a strong north to west link
from the heart of the biology and chemistry
area to Terman Engineering Center, and

eventually would eliminate Stauffer II in or
der to create a central plaza near Old
Chemistry. Buildings could be constructed
for teaching or research functions or organ
ized along departmental lines.
Alternative C
Buildings around a central podium would
be zoned vertically, with most undergradu
ate teaching on level one, departmental
offices and seminar rooms on level two, and
research and faculty offices on levels three,
four and five. The podium would be raised
15 feet above natural grade, putting the
main entrance to buildings at level two.

Buildings also could be entered at level
three from the upper level of a connecting
arcade.
A dozen faculty members from the sci
ence and engineering departments to be lo
cated in the renovated Near West Campus
are working closely with the planners.
The group, called FUTURES, is charged
with advising the planners of the project
"from its inception until the concrete is
poured and, hopefully, after the buildings
are open," said Applied Physics Prof.
Robert Byer, head of FUTURES.
The University planning committee,
which includes representatives from the
science and engineering departments, will
base its final recommendations to the ar
chitects on the suggestions of the faculty,
according to Williams.
Funding for the $250 million redevelop
ment of the science and engineering region
is expected to come from gifts to Stanford.
Donations finance most major University
projects, according to Williams.
Money for the planning process itself
comes from the University's operating
budget.
Ray Bacchetti, vice provost for manage
ment and the leader of the planning commit
tee, has estimated that 20 to 40 percent of

the total cost will come from a small num
ber of principal donors, 20 to 30 percent
from targeted efforts with individuals and
corporations, 5 to 10 percent from a
venture fund and 15 to 30 percent from
University funds.
A fund-raising strategy is currently being
developed, according to Williams.
Admitting that he considers cost a major
obstacle to realizing the project, Williams
stated that some aspects of the renovations
are "extremely urgent. Some of the smaller
buildings (in the existing science area) were
built for only temporary use. They don't
work well, and they're overcrowded."
One way to relieve the financial burden of
the Near West Campus is to plan for a 10-15
year construction period, thus allowing
funds to be amassed gradually, according to
Williams.
"One problem we're puzzling over now is

the process of logistics and sequencing,"
said John Hughes, a member of the planning
committee. The design selected must be
flexible enough so that construction can
proceed in nearly discrete stages, he said.
If funds run out, construction could then be
postponed with minimum disruption of the
overall plan.
An important factor in the final look of
Near West will be how that region joins in
architectural harmony with the Quad.
Since technical buildings "tend to get
larger and taller because of space require
ment for labs . . . (and) equipment," it will
be difficult "to maintain the warm character
of the Farm," said Williams, emphasizing
that preserving the "warm character" is a
priority.
