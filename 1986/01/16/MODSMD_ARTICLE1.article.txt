# Chisholm Sees Black Revolt In South Africa
## 
### RICK KUWAYTI 
Black activist and former U.S. congresswoman
Shirley Chisholm told an audience of 500 in Kresge
Auditorium last night that she expects a violent up
heaval in South Africa.
"I see this country (South Africa) erupting very
soon, and when it erupts, thousands of people will be
killed, most of them black. They are not afraid to die,"
the 61-year-old Chisholm said.
In an emotional speech, Chisholm recalled her
recent visit to South Africa. "I have never cried so
much in my life, looking out of my hotel window," she
said. What she saw were black men knocking them
selves down to get to the lorries which take them to
their homes, two to three hours away from the city.
Blacks are not allowed to stay in the cities after sunset,
she said.
Chisholm said her conversations with South African
blacks reflected the hostility in that country. "What
frightened me the most was when they said, 'Look at
us well because we are not going to be living much
longer. What kind of life do we have anyway?' . . .
These men were looking at me and almost laughing,"
she said.
Chisholm's speech, which was sponsored by the
ASSU Speaker's Bureau, was one of the on-campus
events scheduled to commemorate the birthday of civil
rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr.
Calling King "a visionary" and "a leader in every
sense of the word," Chisholm spoke of King's dream of
liberation through non-violence as "a dream not just for
people in the South, but for all America."
King was "warning us that racism was not just
regional but a national problem," she said. Chisholm
acknowledged that some change has been made but
that "we have a long way to go both as a people and a
society."
"Racism in this country has remained consistent. . .
we remain a society that is torn by racial conflict and
discrimination, but it is coming to us in a much more
subtle form," she said.
Chisholm called on college students to "participate in
any movement that eradicates injustice." Students
