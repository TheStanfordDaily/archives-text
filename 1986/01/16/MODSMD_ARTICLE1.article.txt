# Chisholm Sees Black Revolt In South Africa
## 
### RICK KUWAYTI 
Black activist and former U.S. congresswoman
Shirley Chisholm told an audience of 500 in Kresge
Auditorium last night that she expects a violent up
heaval in South Africa.
"I see this country (South Africa) erupting very
soon, and when it erupts, thousands of people will be
killed, most of them black. They are not afraid to die,"
the 61-year-old Chisholm said.
In an emotional speech, Chisholm recalled her
recent visit to South Africa. "I have never cried so
much in my life, looking out of my hotel window," she
said. What she saw were black men knocking them
selves down to get to the lorries which take them to
their homes, two to three hours away from the city.
Blacks are not allowed to stay in the cities after sunset,
she said.
Chisholm said her conversations with South African
blacks reflected the hostility in that country. "What
frightened me the most was when they said, 'Look at
us well because we are not going to be living much
longer. What kind of life do we have anyway?' . . .
These men were looking at me and almost laughing,"
she said.
Chisholm's speech, which was sponsored by the
ASSU Speaker's Bureau, was one of the on-campus
events scheduled to commemorate the birthday of civil
rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr.
Calling King "a visionary" and "a leader in every
sense of the word," Chisholm spoke of King's dream of
liberation through non-violence as "a dream not just for
people in the South, but for all America."
King was "warning us that racism was not just
regional but a national problem," she said. Chisholm
acknowledged that some change has been made but
that "we have a long way to go both as a people and a
society."
"Racism in this country has remained consistent. . .
we remain a society that is torn by racial conflict and
discrimination, but it is coming to us in a much more
subtle form," she said.
Chisholm called on college students to "participate in
any movement that eradicates injustice." Students
today are "not turned on to move
ments and not turned on to helping
others .... They may regret it
one day," she warned.
Criticizing Reagan Administra
tion programs in areas such as edu
cation, Chisholm said that "the
wheel of progress has again been
halted." She blasted President
Reagan for having "the audacity and
nerve to appear today and speak on
IV about how wonderful a person
Martin Luther King was . . . when
I saw in Congress a few years ago
how he rebelled against making his
birthday a holiday . . . the hypoc
risy of it all." "I'm angry with cer
tain people using certain situations
to show their compassion when
deep down in their guts they do not
feel it," she added.
Praying to King, who was assas
sinated in Memphis in 1968, she
said, "Our greatest hope must be
that you did not really die in vain."
Chisholm found it ironic that in
1984, exactly 20 years after King
won the Nobel Peace Prize, an
other believer in non-violence, Bis
hop Desmond Tutu was the
recipient of the award.
