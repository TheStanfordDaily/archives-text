# Tutu Will Revive Struggle

"Apartheid cannot be reformed. We can't keep on
having people tinkering with peripheral issues when the
basic problem is political power."
Bishop Desmond Tutu
Jan. 9, 1986
As the crisis in South Africa escalates, Bishop Des
mond Tutu is taking increasingly strong stands on both
the need for fundamental change in South Africa and
the role that the United States plays in supporting the
apartheid system.
Tutu is an important and eloquent representative of
the struggle for black liberation, and it will be an honor
for Stanford to host him next week. His visit is also a
victory for the anti-apartheid movement here; without
broad interest from the community and constant pres
sure from organizations like the Black Student Union
and Stanford Out of South Africa, Tutu would not be
speaking here. Many of the circumstances surrounding
the Tutu visit cast additional doubt on the sincerity of
concern and the ability to take a stand in some sectors
of the Stanford administration.

Everyone on this campus has heard of Desmond
Tutu, a man with a personal commitment to non
violence. The head of the South African Council of
Churches, Tutu won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984
and is one of the religious community's most widely
recognized leaders in the struggle to end apartheid.
Tutu represents the liberation struggle in South Africa.
Part of the current strategy of the South African
government is encouraging differences within the black
community in order to prohibit a unified opposition.
Besides forcing tribes with long histories of conflict
into close contact and competition, the government is
putting a great deal of pressure on Tutu to renounce
radical organizations such as the African National
Congress (ANC) and the Pan-African Congress on the
grounds that they are illegitimate terrorist organiza
tions. Tutu has not given in to the pressure and refers
to Nelson Mandela, the long-imprisoned former leader
of the outlawed ANC, as his president.
Tutu is clearly aware that the source of violence in
South Africa is the terrorism of the Botha government,
and that, at a certain point, non-violent protest ceases

to be an option in protesting the government. The
ANC is the classic example. ANC members worked for
change through legal means for more than 45 years and
turned to armed struggle only after they were banned
and exiled and their leaders were killed or imprisoned.
In a recent interview on NBC's "Today" show, Tutu
stated: "I . . . could get to the point where I would
agree with the church's tradition that if you have two
evils, a repressive system such as Nazism was and the
possibility of overthrowing it, then I would say there
comes a time when it is justifiable to overthrow an un
just system by violence."
The other issue that Tutu has been pushing for is a
stronger U.S. position against the apartheid regime. In
South Africa, calling for divestment or economic sanc
tions is punishable by imprisonment or death. The
United States, according to Tutu, plays a pivotal role in
maintaining apartheid — so important that he is risking
arrest by openly calling for economic sanctions. It is
time for us here in the United States to heed the call
from Tutu and all other major black leaders in South
Africa and to push for economic sanctions — every
thing from divesting Stanford's portfolio to pursuing a
government-decreed trade embargo.
Despite constant assurances to students and the
public that it is doing all it can to help end apartheid, the
Stanford administration and the University Board of
Trustees remain opposed to divestment and have yet
to make a strong call for any other economic sanctions.
In light of this history and some recent controversy
around the Tutu visit, it is worth re-examining what
the board and the administration's relationship to South
Africa is and what, if anything, they are doing to end
apartheid.
The administration's attempt to cancel the Tutu pro
gram by holding the event in the very limited space of
Memorial Auditorium, its resistance to including stu
dent speakers and its arbitrary decisions limiting stu
dent ticket sales are indicative of an attitude problem.
It seems as if the administration didn't want Tutu to
come and inspire students and others on the campus
and — if he had to come — to make a great impact.
But these are very small issues compared to the
refusal of the trustees to consider divestment in a
serious way and the hypocrisy they have shown by ex
pressing concern for the situation while simultaneously
investing more money in South Africa-related stocks.
When Tutu speaks Tuesday, it will be both a day of
celebration for the continued struggle of the black
people of South Africa and a day of renewed determina
tion to make whatever contribution we can at Stanford
to support that struggle for democractic majority rule.

for Stanford to host him next week. His visit is also a
victory for the anti-apartheid movement here; without
broad interest from the community and constant pres
sure from organizations like the Black Student Union
and Stanford Out of South Africa, Tutu would not be
speaking here. Many of the circumstances surrounding
the Tutu visit cast additional doubt on the sincerity of
concern and the ability to take a stand in some sectors
of the Stanford administration.

Everyone on this campus has heard of Desmond
Tutu, a man with a personal commitment to non
violence. The head of the South African Council of
Churches, Tutu won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984
and is one of the religious community's most widely
recognized leaders in the struggle to end apartheid.
Tutu represents the liberation struggle in South Africa.
Part of the current strategy of the South African
government is encouraging differences within the black
community in order to prohibit a unified opposition.
Besides forcing tribes with long histories of conflict
into close contact and competition, the government is
putting a great deal of pressure on Tutu to renounce
radical organizations such as the African National
Congress (ANC) and the Pan-African Congress on the
grounds that they are illegitimate terrorist organiza
tions. Tutu has not given in to the pressure and refers
to Nelson Mandela, the long-imprisoned former leader
of the outlawed ANC, as his president.
Tutu is clearly aware that the source of violence in
South Africa is the terrorism of the Botha government,
and that, at a certain point, non-violent protest ceases

to be an option in protesting the government. The
ANC is the classic example. ANC members worked for
change through legal means for more than 45 years and
turned to armed struggle only after they were banned
and exiled and their leaders were killed or imprisoned.
In a recent interview on NBC's "Today" show, Tutu
stated: "I . . . could get to the point where I would
agree with the church's tradition that if you have two
evils, a repressive system such as Nazism was and the
possibility of overthrowing it, then I would say there
comes a time when it is justifiable to overthrow an un
just system by violence."
The other issue that Tutu has been pushing for is a
stronger U.S. position against the apartheid regime. In
South Africa, calling for divestment or economic sanc
tions is punishable by imprisonment or death. The
United States, according to Tutu, plays a pivotal role in
maintaining apartheid — so important that he is risking
arrest by openly calling for economic sanctions. It is
time for us here in the United States to heed the call
from Tutu and all other major black leaders in South
Africa and to push for economic sanctions — every
thing from divesting Stanford's portfolio to pursuing a
government-decreed trade embargo.
Despite constant assurances to students and the
public that it is doing all it can to help end apartheid, the
Stanford administration and the University Board of
Trustees remain opposed to divestment and have yet
to make a strong call for any other economic sanctions.
In light of this history and some recent controversy
around the Tutu visit, it is worth re-examining what
the board and the administration's relationship to South
Africa is and what, if anything, they are doing to end
apartheid.
The administration's attempt to cancel the Tutu pro
gram by holding the event in the very limited space of
Memorial Auditorium, its resistance to including stu
dent speakers and its arbitrary decisions limiting stu
dent ticket sales are indicative of an attitude problem.
It seems as if the administration didn't want Tutu to
come and inspire students and others on the campus
and — if he had to come — to make a great impact.
But these are very small issues compared to the
refusal of the trustees to consider divestment in a
serious way and the hypocrisy they have shown by ex
pressing concern for the situation while simultaneously
investing more money in South Africa-related stocks.
When Tutu speaks Tuesday, it will be both a day of
celebration for the continued struggle of the black
people of South Africa and a day of renewed determina
tion to make whatever contribution we can at Stanford
to support that struggle for democractic majority rule.
