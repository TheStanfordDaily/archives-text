Half of all college students are holding jobs this
academic year, a proportion that has risen
evenly over the last two decades, reports The
Chronicle of Higher Education.

The Chronicle attributed the growing ranks of
student workers to "spiraling tuition costs, a re
duction — on an inflation-adjusted basis — in the
value of student aid, and greater career con
sciousness among students."
"Parents are complaining bitterly about the

amount of loans they have to take out," says
Pamela Christoffel, author of a new College
Board report on the role of student earnings in
paying for school.
Officials in government and academia are de
veloping new programs and expanding old ones
to help students find jobs to meet their ex
penses, to explore career alternatives and to
provide service to the community.
For most Stanford students on financial aid,
work-study is part of their financial aid package
— one is expected to earn a certain amount of
money over the course of the school year.
Stanford senior Diane Campos has worked
nine months as a building supervisor at RoW
gym. She averages about 11 hours per wee 1 ,
she said.

"It's really convenient. I spend a lot of time at
Roble gym. I get to get to know the dancing in
structors a lot better," Campos said.
Campos said she feels her work offers "a di
version from school."
In December, the U.S. House of Representa
tives approved fundamental changes in the Col
lege Work-Study Program to allow students to
work for private, for-profit companies.
"The whole attitude toward college students
has changed over the last 20 years," said
Howard Hayghe, an economist with the U.S.
Department of Labor.
"People now expect them to work while
they're in school. And as we've moved to a ser
vice economy, part-time jobs are far more
available than they were in the 19605."
