Bombs Away, Berkeley
They get into different things
over at UC-Berkeley.
The Stanford police concern
themselves with student
protests and bicycle lights. Their
East Bay counterparts worry
about bombs.
They've been trained by the
Army and the FBI, and now
they're ready to save Berkeley
and the East Bay (although some
of us must wonder just how
much of it is really worth
saving).
Leroy Pereira is the supervis
ing bomb technician for the UC-
Berkeley Emergency Services
Unit Bomb Squad. He calls it the
"best-equipped bomb squad in
Northern California."
The bomb unit doesn't spend
much time defusing bombs,
however. Pereira says his group
receives about 100 calls a year
for its services, but most of
those are for hazardous chemical
removal and not for bomb
threats.
That's not to say there's no
danger in the job.
One recent Christmas even
ing, Pereira and his crew were
called to the home of a school
principal who found an unmarked
package on his doorstep. He had
been having problems with a par
ticular teacher and feared the
worst.
"So we X-rayed the package,
and noticed all these little shapes
of stuff that appeared to be
salami," Pereira told The Daily
Californian. "It turned out to be a
Hickory Farms gift package."

Going for the Top
Harvard students (you re
member, the ones who got their
president to agree to Woolly
Mammoth divestment?) have fi
nally gotten their act together.
A group of Harvard alums
called Alumni Against Apartheid
has announced that it has enough
signatures to nominate three
anti-apartheid candidates for the
university's Board of Overseers.
Five new members are
elected each year to the board,
which, together with the seven
member Harvard Corporation,
governs the university.
"This Harvard election will be
the largest referendum ever held
anywhere on the issue of apart
heid, and it will be, I think, an in
teresting indicator of American
attitudes on the problem," one of
the candidates said.
South Dakota Blues
South Dakota Gov. William
Janklow has lashed out at the
state's Board of Regents after
South Dakota finished near the
bottom in a survey of state
financing for higher education.
"The idiots over at the
regents don't send in the right
numbers. I don't mind taking the
heat for what I say and do, but I
get the hell beat out of me when
I go to campuses," Janklow ex
plained.
South Dakotans involved in
politics do not lead an easy life.
