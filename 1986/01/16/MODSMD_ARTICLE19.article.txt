### MICHAEL GOFF Staff writer 
After 11 weeks of work at Stanford Sierra
Camp,"the most-often-heard comment is, 'That was
the best summer of my life,' " according to Richard
Knight, the camp's staff director.
Knight said that once again 55 Stanford students
will operate the Stanford Sierra Camp at Fallen Leaf
Lake for alumni association members and their
families this summer.
The camp is owned and operated by the Stanford
Alumni Association, and its facilities are available for
use by Stanford alumni, faculty, staff and their family
and friends. This summer each of the 11 one-week
sessions will be attended by about 250 guests.
At camp, Stanford students do everything from
operating the waterskiing dock, to organizing
children's activities, to teaching tennis, and to run
ning the dining room and the camp office. Students
who will be attending Stanford for at least two quar
ters this year are eligible to apply for this summer.
The camp has facilities for instruction in art, pho
tography, crafts, hiking, exercise, sailing, tennis,
waterskiing and volleyball. In addition, staff mem
bers present a talent show, a campfire and a
waterskiing demonstration each week for the
guests.
Knight said the interviewing staff looks for
"people who have energy and who are personable
and like people. The biggest job is interacting with
guests." Stacey Partch, a senior majoring in his
tory, described her work with children over the past
two summers as, "probably the best thing I ever did
in my life except getting into Stanford.
"I thought it was fabulous. I love children, and
you really get a chance to know them. You have
complete freedom to do what you want with them.
It's kind of like having a classroom in the Sierras."
Joanne Liautaud, a senior majoring in sociology,

said the most important aspect of her summer su
pervising a kitchen staff of 12 was the people she
got to meet. She said the staff "is a support group
that you have to return back to Stanford with" and
alumni interaction provides "a great way to meet
contacts for later on and explore career ideas."
She said, "It is a family camp, and it is geared
toward the family. You are expected to have intel
lectual conversations with adults. The alumni are
curious about what is going on at Stanford now."
Partch said that in some ways this can be the
hardest part of the summer. Staff members are
"constantly surrounded by people, part of the job is
to be there to interact with people. You always have
to be very polite and up and energetic. . . . You
can't just hide," she said.
Knight said the biggest problem for staff mem
bers might be the lack of privacy, because they are
always surrounded by staff members and guests.
But, each staff member has one-and-one-half sched
uled days off to balance work in their assigned
areas, dining room duty, "fountain" duty and cabin
cleaning chores.
Liautaud said, "The jobs can get redundant, but
that comes with any job."
Chris Braun, a senior majoring in human biology,
is considering a third summer at camp, and his ad
vice to all Stanford students is "to try to work up at
camp if possible.
"It's a chance to deal with Stanford students in a
non-academic atmosphere — to see them in a crea
tive and social setting," he said.
Knight said that most jobs at camp pay $110 each
week in addition to tips (about $80 each week last
year), room and board.
Applications are currently available at Bowman
Alumni House and are due Jan. 27, when students
can sign up for interviews. Interested students are
required to submit two recommendations and the
completed application to be considered.
