Selected cuts from these albums will be played on KZSU tomorrow at 6 p.m.

Arcadia — "So Red the Rose"
★ ★
"Hello, K-I-T-S."
"Hi, like could you play that new
song by Duran Duran?"
"You mean 'Arcadia'?"
"Yeah, like whatever. As long as
Simon Leßon is in it. He's dreamy!"
"OK, but we just played it five
minutes ago."
"Oh, no! Like, did you hear about
his boat accident?"
"Yeah. Thanks for call. ..."
"I think Arcadia is even better
than Power Station. They're fluffy
and pretentious, rather than being
rough-edged and pretentious!"
"Sure, kid. I have to go."
"OK. Can you say my name over
the radio? And could you dedicate
that song to Simon for me?"
"Listen, we can't play "Election
Day" for at least three more hours,
OK? People actually do get tired of
no-guitar synthpop after a while.
It's just too whiny, slow and
monotonous, and it already
peaked. ..."
"My friend Buffy said she got the
album from Santa and the other
songs are even better than whatever
that one is. They're more melodic
and experimental."
"Whatever, kid. That's what all
you teenagers say. They're just
Roxy Music worshippers like all the
rest of em."
"Roxy who? Oh, I saw them on
MTV, I think. I think Simon's just
dreamy, don't you?"
"Listen, why don't you turn your
radio off and listen to some old
Duran D. . . ."
Sade — "Promise"
★ ★★
What can one say about the uni
verse's most predictable group?

They're still just like they were,
though maybe a little smooooooother
this time around. Every song has
its infectious reggae-derived
rhythm lines, its sultry saxophone
and of course, Sade Adu's own
purriect voice. Various other in
struments are mixed in for the
same effect. "Diamond Life" is
skillfully and tastefully done,
presenting itself as the young per
son's "beautiful music" that it is.
Ahhhhhhh. This is music for Type-
As who can't afford jacuzzis or
valium. It might not be the most
exciting stuff in the world, ya know,
and the lyrics, of course, say ab
solutely nothing. It's a real pity to
see someone with as much talent as

Sade play her own style ad Las
Vegasium, when she could easily do
something more challenging. But
after all, there are just some times
for Survivor and others for Sade.
The Colourfield — "Virgins
and Philistines"
★ ★★
Do you remember Fun Boy
Three? Well, Terry Hall was a Fun
Boy, and he's on this album. But

take off your high-top dancing
shoes, fun boys 'n' girls. The only
part that sounds like Fun Boy
Three is Hall's trademark, high and
airy vocals. Otherwise it sounds
like, well, let's show you. Put on
the first track. What do you hear?
Organs! What! No synthesizers?
Acoustic guitars? Wait! Try the
next track. A guitar solo? Uh oh,
fun kids, it's psychedelia! The first
track, "I Can't Get Enough of You,
Baby" is even an old '60s hit, and a
pretty good cover of it, too. Colour
field's album is largely a successful
attempt at crossing '80s pop with
'60s psychedelia, except that on a
couple songs they have these
violins that make it sound like
they're making tunes for a
"beautiful music" station. If they
took those orchestral touches out
of some of the songs, things would
probably improve, but that was
probably not what they were trying
to do. When you get this record,
you get a mixed bag of some good
quality, four-star stuff like "Can't
Get Enough," "Hammond Song"
and "Pushing Up Daisies," but you
get mediocre, two-star stuff as
well. So, average it out.

The Replacements — "Tim"
★★★★
Long-time critical favorites,
these four Minneapolis musical
mutants have finally begun to gain
the popular acclaim they so richly
deserve with this, their fourth al
bum. The "Mats are blessed with
immense talent, albeit with internal
contradictions. "Let It Be" was
proclaimed by many to be the finest
album of 1984, earning the group
respect from a wide number of in
fluential sources. In concert, the
polarizations of the band are evi
dent, their originals are powerful,
but nothing will stop the boys from
doing a note-for-note cover of
"Takin' Care of Business" until they
forget the words halfway through.
Many people attempt to lump the
group in the category of neo-'6os
revival garage bands, but they are
much more. When they first
started, they sounded more like

bad thrash, but over time their
sound has become a bit more
polished and refined. The metal in
fluences are still very much in
evidence, but the taste of success
has not spoiled the Mats yet. What
makes the Mats so important is not
their ability to trash it up with the

best of the punk/metal bands, but
their ability to write and perform a
song like "Here Comes a Regular,"
a tale of urban despair more suited
to a Dylan or a Springsteen. On
"Tim," Paul Westerberg has proven
himself a major contender with his
incisive, sobering glimpses of
reality juxtaposed with some won
derful drunken anarchic composi
tions.
Frank Zappa — "Frank Zappa
Meets the Mothers of Preven
tion"
Yet another album from that civil
libertarian himself. While we were
gearin' up to go back to school in
September, Frank was selflessly
defending Our Principles before the
PMRC (Parent's Music Resource
Center), trying to avert a move
ment toward the regulation of
"porn-rock." And not only did he
probably make a difference, but he
also got enough spoken material out
of the Congressional Record to jus
tify a whole album, just so we could
hear a 12-minute cut containing the
stuff, all overdubbed and digitally
sampled. Favorites like Tipper
Gore's "fire and chain and other ob
jectionable tools of gratification in
some twisted minds,"
"Buuuurrrnnn, buuurrrrnnn, buuur
rrrrnnnnn," and Sen. Earnest Hol
lings' ever-heartening, "If I could
find some way constitutionally to do
away with it I would." Zappa's
treatment of it is as biased as can be
expected, but unlike many dub
tracks, the stuff is creatively
packaged enough to become more
entertaining with each play. The
rest of the album is above-average
experimentation, with emphasis on
electronics and instrumentals with

melodies, rather than the usual,
painfully extended guitar solos. It's
still not "heyday" Zappa, whenever
that was, but as music it floats, and
as a political message it's even im
portant.
Malcolm McLaren — "Swamp
Thing"
★ ★★★
If it's teenyboppin' cheerleaders,
obnoxious scratchin' and pseudo
operatic rappin', then it has to be
Malcolm McLaren. You have to
hand it to the guy — when he
writes a song, he releases it
whether it's good or not. This is not
a man who is worried about getting
airplay. "Swamp Thing" is a collec
tion of off-tracks from McLaren's
"Duck Rock" phase. Now think
about this for a second. All music
industry buffs know an "off-track"
is a song that didn't make it onto
the album it was written for. So
"Swamp Thing" consists of eight
songs not good enough for "Duck
Rock."
Before you throw down your
Daily in horror, though, think about
what "Duck Rock's" outstanding
virtues were. This was a record
that basically redefined musical ob
noxiousness and got away with it
clean.
Don't get carried away, though.
One of the tracks on this record is a
complete dud. The album's vocals
are mainly stupid stories, dub
tracks from "Duck Rock" or, worst
of all, regular old rock-song lyrics a
la every other group. Not to men
tion the fact that no one has ever
listened to two McLaren albums in a
row and come out of it alive.

best of the punk/metal bands, but
their ability to write and perform a
song like "Here Comes a Regular,"
a tale of urban despair more suited
to a Dylan or a Springsteen. On
"Tim," Paul Westerberg has proven
himself a major contender with his
incisive, sobering glimpses of
reality juxtaposed with some won
derful drunken anarchic composi
tions.
Frank Zappa — "Frank Zappa
Meets the Mothers of Preven
tion"
Yet another album from that civil
libertarian himself. While we were
gearin' up to go back to school in
September, Frank was selflessly
defending Our Principles before the
PMRC (Parent's Music Resource
Center), trying to avert a move
ment toward the regulation of
"porn-rock." And not only did he
probably make a difference, but he
also got enough spoken material out
of the Congressional Record to jus
tify a whole album, just so we could
hear a 12-minute cut containing the
stuff, all overdubbed and digitally
sampled. Favorites like Tipper
Gore's "fire and chain and other ob
jectionable tools of gratification in
some twisted minds,"
"Buuuurrrnnn, buuurrrrnnn, buuur
rrrrnnnnn," and Sen. Earnest Hol
lings' ever-heartening, "If I could
find some way constitutionally to do
away with it I would." Zappa's
treatment of it is as biased as can be
expected, but unlike many dub
tracks, the stuff is creatively
packaged enough to become more
entertaining with each play. The
rest of the album is above-average
experimentation, with emphasis on
electronics and instrumentals with

melodies, rather than the usual,
painfully extended guitar solos. It's
still not "heyday" Zappa, whenever
that was, but as music it floats, and
as a political message it's even im
portant.
Malcolm McLaren — "Swamp
Thing"
★ ★★★
If it's teenyboppin' cheerleaders,
obnoxious scratchin' and pseudo
operatic rappin', then it has to be
Malcolm McLaren. You have to
hand it to the guy — when he
writes a song, he releases it
whether it's good or not. This is not
a man who is worried about getting
airplay. "Swamp Thing" is a collec
tion of off-tracks from McLaren's
"Duck Rock" phase. Now think
about this for a second. All music
industry buffs know an "off-track"
is a song that didn't make it onto
the album it was written for. So
"Swamp Thing" consists of eight
songs not good enough for "Duck
Rock."
Before you throw down your
Daily in horror, though, think about
what "Duck Rock's" outstanding
virtues were. This was a record
that basically redefined musical ob
noxiousness and got away with it
clean.
Don't get carried away, though.
One of the tracks on this record is a
complete dud. The album's vocals
are mainly stupid stories, dub
tracks from "Duck Rock" or, worst
of all, regular old rock-song lyrics a
la every other group. Not to men
tion the fact that no one has ever
listened to two McLaren albums in a
row and come out of it alive.

Arcadia — "So Red the Rose"
★ ★
"Hello, K-I-T-S."
"Hi, like could you play that new
song by Duran Duran?"
"You mean 'Arcadia'?"
"Yeah, like whatever. As long as
Simon Leßon is in it. He's dreamy!"
"OK, but we just played it five
minutes ago."
"Oh, no! Like, did you hear about
his boat accident?"
"Yeah. Thanks for call. ..."
"I think Arcadia is even better
than Power Station. They're fluffy
and pretentious, rather than being
rough-edged and pretentious!"
"Sure, kid. I have to go."
"OK. Can you say my name over
the radio? And could you dedicate
that song to Simon for me?"
"Listen, we can't play "Election
Day" for at least three more hours,
OK? People actually do get tired of
no-guitar synthpop after a while.
It's just too whiny, slow and
monotonous, and it already
peaked. ..."
"My friend Buffy said she got the
album from Santa and the other
songs are even better than whatever
that one is. They're more melodic
and experimental."
"Whatever, kid. That's what all
you teenagers say. They're just
Roxy Music worshippers like all the
rest of em."
"Roxy who? Oh, I saw them on
MTV, I think. I think Simon's just
dreamy, don't you?"
"Listen, why don't you turn your
radio off and listen to some old
Duran D. . . ."
Sade — "Promise"
★ ★★
What can one say about the uni
verse's most predictable group?

They're still just like they were,
though maybe a little smooooooother
this time around. Every song has
its infectious reggae-derived
rhythm lines, its sultry saxophone
and of course, Sade Adu's own
purriect voice. Various other in
struments are mixed in for the
same effect. "Diamond Life" is
skillfully and tastefully done,
presenting itself as the young per
son's "beautiful music" that it is.
Ahhhhhhh. This is music for Type-
As who can't afford jacuzzis or
valium. It might not be the most
exciting stuff in the world, ya know,
and the lyrics, of course, say ab
solutely nothing. It's a real pity to
see someone with as much talent as

Sade play her own style ad Las
Vegasium, when she could easily do
something more challenging. But
after all, there are just some times
for Survivor and others for Sade.
The Colourfield — "Virgins
and Philistines"
★ ★★
Do you remember Fun Boy
Three? Well, Terry Hall was a Fun
Boy, and he's on this album. But

take off your high-top dancing
shoes, fun boys 'n' girls. The only
part that sounds like Fun Boy
Three is Hall's trademark, high and
airy vocals. Otherwise it sounds
like, well, let's show you. Put on
the first track. What do you hear?
Organs! What! No synthesizers?
Acoustic guitars? Wait! Try the
next track. A guitar solo? Uh oh,
fun kids, it's psychedelia! The first
track, "I Can't Get Enough of You,
Baby" is even an old '60s hit, and a
pretty good cover of it, too. Colour
field's album is largely a successful
attempt at crossing '80s pop with
'60s psychedelia, except that on a
couple songs they have these
violins that make it sound like
they're making tunes for a
"beautiful music" station. If they
took those orchestral touches out
of some of the songs, things would
probably improve, but that was
probably not what they were trying
to do. When you get this record,
you get a mixed bag of some good
quality, four-star stuff like "Can't
Get Enough," "Hammond Song"
and "Pushing Up Daisies," but you
get mediocre, two-star stuff as
well. So, average it out.

The Replacements — "Tim"
★★★★
Long-time critical favorites,
these four Minneapolis musical
mutants have finally begun to gain
the popular acclaim they so richly
deserve with this, their fourth al
bum. The "Mats are blessed with
immense talent, albeit with internal
contradictions. "Let It Be" was
proclaimed by many to be the finest
album of 1984, earning the group
respect from a wide number of in
fluential sources. In concert, the
polarizations of the band are evi
dent, their originals are powerful,
but nothing will stop the boys from
doing a note-for-note cover of
"Takin' Care of Business" until they
forget the words halfway through.
Many people attempt to lump the
group in the category of neo-'6os
revival garage bands, but they are
much more. When they first
started, they sounded more like

bad thrash, but over time their
sound has become a bit more
polished and refined. The metal in
fluences are still very much in
evidence, but the taste of success
has not spoiled the Mats yet. What
makes the Mats so important is not
their ability to trash it up with the

best of the punk/metal bands, but
their ability to write and perform a
song like "Here Comes a Regular,"
a tale of urban despair more suited
to a Dylan or a Springsteen. On
"Tim," Paul Westerberg has proven
himself a major contender with his
incisive, sobering glimpses of
reality juxtaposed with some won

"Buuuurrrnnn, buuurrrrnnn, buuur
rrrrnnnnn," and Sen. Earnest Hol
lings' ever-heartening, "If I could
find some way constitutionally to do
away with it I would." Zappa's
treatment of it is as biased as can be

entertaining with each play. The

same effect. "Diamond Life" is
skillfully and tastefully done,
presenting itself as the young per
son's "beautiful music" that it is.
Ahhhhhhh. This is music for Type-
As who can't afford jacuzzis or
valium. It might not be the most
exciting stuff in the world, ya know,
and the lyrics, of course, say ab
solutely nothing. It's a real pity to
see someone with as much talent as

Sade play her own style ad Las
Vegasium, when she could easily do
something more challenging. But
after all, there are just some times
for Survivor and others for Sade.
The Colourfield — "Virgins
and Philistines"
★ ★★
Do you remember Fun Boy
Three? Well, Terry Hall was a Fun
Boy, and he's on this album. But

take off your high-top dancing
shoes, fun boys 'n' girls. The only
part that sounds like Fun Boy
Three is Hall's trademark, high and
airy vocals. Otherwise it sounds
like, well, let's show you. Put on
the first track. What do you hear?
Organs! What! No synthesizers?
Acoustic guitars? Wait! Try the
next track. A guitar solo? Uh oh,
fun kids, it's psychedelia! The first
track, "I Can't Get Enough of You,
Baby" is even an old '60s hit, and a
pretty good cover of it, too. Colour
field's album is largely a successful
attempt at crossing '80s pop with
'60s psychedelia, except that on a
couple songs they have these
violins that make it sound like
they're making tunes for a
"beautiful music" station. If they
took those orchestral touches out
of some of the songs, things would
probably improve, but that was
probably not what they were trying
to do. When you get this record,
you get a mixed bag of some good
quality, four-star stuff like "Can't
Get Enough," "Hammond Song"
and "Pushing Up Daisies," but you
get mediocre, two-star stuff as
well. So, average it out.

The Replacements — "Tim"
★★★★
Long-time critical favorites,
these four Minneapolis musical
mutants have finally begun to gain
the popular acclaim they so richly
deserve with this, their fourth al
bum. The "Mats are blessed with
immense talent, albeit with internal
contradictions. "Let It Be" was
proclaimed by many to be the finest
album of 1984, earning the group
respect from a wide number of in
fluential sources. In concert, the
polarizations of the band are evi
dent, their originals are powerful,
but nothing will stop the boys from
doing a note-for-note cover of
"Takin' Care of Business" until they
forget the words halfway through.
Many people attempt to lump the
group in the category of neo-'6os
revival garage bands, but they are
much more. When they first
started, they sounded more like

bad thrash, but over time their
sound has become a bit more
polished and refined. The metal in
fluences are still very much in
evidence, but the taste of success
has not spoiled the Mats yet. What
makes the Mats so important is not
their ability to trash it up with the

best of the punk/metal bands, but
their ability to write and perform a
song like "Here Comes a Regular,"
a tale of urban despair more suited
to a Dylan or a Springsteen. On
"Tim," Paul Westerberg has proven
himself a major contender with his
incisive, sobering glimpses of
reality juxtaposed with some won
derful drunken anarchic composi
tions.
Frank Zappa — "Frank Zappa
Meets the Mothers of Preven
tion"
Yet another album from that civil
libertarian himself. While we were
gearin' up to go back to school in
September, Frank was selflessly
defending Our Principles before the
PMRC (Parent's Music Resource
Center), trying to avert a move
ment toward the regulation of
"porn-rock." And not only did he
probably make a difference, but he
also got enough spoken material out
of the Congressional Record to jus
tify a whole album, just so we could
hear a 12-minute cut containing the
stuff, all overdubbed and digitally
sampled. Favorites like Tipper
Gore's "fire and chain and other ob
jectionable tools of gratification in
some twisted minds,"
"Buuuurrrnnn, buuurrrrnnn, buuur
rrrrnnnnn," and Sen. Earnest Hol
lings' ever-heartening, "If I could
find some way constitutionally to do
away with it I would." Zappa's
treatment of it is as biased as can be
expected, but unlike many dub
tracks, the stuff is creatively
packaged enough to become more
entertaining with each play. The
rest of the album is above-average
experimentation, with emphasis on
electronics and instrumentals with

melodies, rather than the usual,
painfully extended guitar solos. It's
still not "heyday" Zappa, whenever
that was, but as music it floats, and
as a political message it's even im
portant.
Malcolm McLaren — "Swamp
Thing"
★ ★★★
If it's teenyboppin' cheerleaders,
obnoxious scratchin' and pseudo
operatic rappin', then it has to be
Malcolm McLaren. You have to
hand it to the guy — when he
writes a song, he releases it
whether it's good or not. This is not
a man who is worried about getting
airplay. "Swamp Thing" is a collec
tion of off-tracks from McLaren's
"Duck Rock" phase. Now think
about this for a second. All music
industry buffs know an "off-track"
is a song that didn't make it onto
the album it was written for. So
"Swamp Thing" consists of eight
songs not good enough for "Duck
Rock."
Before you throw down your
Daily in horror, though, think about
what "Duck Rock's" outstanding
virtues were. This was a record
that basically redefined musical ob
noxiousness and got away with it
clean.
Don't get carried away, though.
One of the tracks on this record is a
complete dud. The album's vocals
are mainly stupid stories, dub
tracks from "Duck Rock" or, worst
of all, regular old rock-song lyrics a
la every other group. Not to men
tion the fact that no one has ever
listened to two McLaren albums in a
row and come out of it alive.
