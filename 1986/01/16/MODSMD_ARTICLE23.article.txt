## Rule Changes Shake Things Up Mandatory Drug Testing's An Invasion of Privacy 
### 
So the NCAA decided to institute
a measure that will force college
athletes to submit to drug tests at
football bowl games and NCAA
championships.
The measure covers both
"performance-enhancing" drugs
like steroids and anphetimines and
"street" drugs. The second part

John Lis, Daily columnist

takes the measure from the realm
of ensuring fair competition to that
of playing policeman and makes a
controversial but defendable
practice into one that is arbitrary
and intrusive.
"If they're going to test athletes,
why don't they test the whole stu
dent body as well?" senior Matt
Soderlund, a linebacker on the
Stanford football team, asked Tues
day.
Soderlund's question is the heart
of this matter. Testing for drugs
that give users an advantage over
non-users is certainly undesirable,
but may be necessary in the imper
fect world we live in.
I wouldn't particularly care to be
tested for these drugs, but I would

understand the rationale and maybe
appreciate that opponents would
not be able to gain an unfair advan
tage as a result of the testing.
Whether there is a need for this
testing is unclear, but let's give the
NCAA the benefit of the doubt
Testing for other drugs, "street"
drugs, drugs that are used recrea
tionally and don't improve perfor
mance — this is something the
NCAA has no right to do.
Let's drop the issue of legality
here. Sure, some of these drugs
are illegal. It's illegal for a 20-year
old to drink alcohol in this state, so I
suppose that if I were tested and al
cohol were found in my system, it
would be known that I am not in
strict compliance with the law. But
who really cares if an athlete under
21 has a beer? What business is it of
the NCAA's?
The NCAA in all likelihood won't
test for alcohol. But what will it test
for? Even the NCAA offices in
Shawnee Mission, Kan., didn't have
the answer to that question yester
day.
Does it include marijuana, a drug

that is illegal in some states and has been
decriminalized in others? Why should athletes be
tested for marijuana while it is regularly used by stu
dents? If the nation's colleges have determined that
marijuana use is bad, let them test all students and
suspend for 90 days those who test positive, just as it
proposes to suspend athletes from competing for 90
days if they test positive.

The question can be asked about cocaine. I find it
hard to defend cocaine use, but why single out athletes
for testing and penalties if they use it? Either test all
students — something I think would be protested by
students who don't use the drug as well as those who
do — or drop the requirement for athletes.
The use of certain recreational drugs may be objec
tionable, and perhaps some of these drugs should
remain illegal. But to force athletes to be tested for
these drugs, which have no positive effect on perfor
mance, and to penalize them for use is a step beyond
the concerns and rights of the NCAA.
