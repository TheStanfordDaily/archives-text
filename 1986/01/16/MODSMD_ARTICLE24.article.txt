# Higher Academic Standards Might Promote Excellence
##

u -
The bottom line in the uproar
over the NCAA's establishment of
minimal academic standards for ad
mitting student-athletes was best

expressed by
James Whar
ton, chancellor

at Louisiana State
University, who

observed, "We no

longer will have students

112 majoring in eligibility."
There is a lot to be said for that.
Universities and colleges exist
the purpose of education. That
is their function, their raison d'etre.
Everything else that goes on, ath
letics included, is strictly periph
eral.
So for the NCAA to require that
athletes achieve scores (which, by
the way, are comfortably below the
national average) on standardized
tests as a condition of admission is
hardly an unreasonable request.
Black educators, however, claim
different motives in the legislation.
Joseph Johnson, president of
Grambling University, saw "a hid
den agenda at this convention, and
that was to eliminate the number of
black athletes on college

campuses."
But why would that be true at a
time when athletic programs, many
of them largely populated by blacks,
are flourishing?
Johnson added that many major
athletic programs had been built
"on the backs of poor, black kids.
Now they're saying to them, *We

Hal Bock, AP sportswriter

don't need you anymore. We want
you off our campus.' "
But Proposition 48 does not bar
anybody from campus. What it does
is set standards for freshmen par
ticipating in athletics. What is so
terrible about that? There is noth
ing in the legislation that does not
allow academically deficient
student-athletes to be admitted,
improve their grades and then par
ticipate in sports later.
What? And miss a year of
eligibility? Wouldn't that be terrible?
There was a time not so very
long ago when freshmen routinely
were not eligible for varsity sports.
They survived then. They could
survive now.
Johnson and the other black
educators claim that standardized
entrance examinations, such as the
Scholastic Aptitude Test, are prod
ucts of a white, middle class society
and discriminate against black
ghetto students. George Hanford,
president of the College Board that
sponsors the SAT, calls that charge
particularly troublesome.
"That simply is not true," he
said. "The authority for that is a
study by the National Academy of
Science, which indicated no bias
against minorities. However, the
use of the test in this circumstance
does have a disproportionate effect
on minorities because of their edu
cational background."

Then the finger points at high
school preparation.
"By and large, greater amounts
of educational funds are spent in af
fluent communities and less in
others," Hanford said. "Society
produces this. We are trying to
overcome this educational deficit.
While on the average, blacks and
other minorities score lower, the
gap is slowly closing."
It should not, however, fall to
NCAA member schools to serve a
remedial function while at the same
time cashing in on athletic prowess.
That's not their job. Education is.
Students who are admitted should
be qualified academically and
whether they can run faster or jump
higher than their brethren should
not enter into the equation.
In Texas, Gov. Mark White's ad
ministration has supported the con
troversial "no pass, no play," rule
which prohibits students who fail

any course in any six-week marking
period from participating in any
extra-curricular activities in the
next marking period.
Coaches have railed at the legis
lation. "We want it refined," Eddie
Joseph, executive director of the
coaches association said. "Make the
suspension for the time deficient,
not for entire marking periods.
Don't make it punitive. The way it
is now, it does not motivate. It is
not encouraging. It is discourag

Larry Yawn, director of the edu
cation division of the governor's of
fice, says the strongest supporters
of the pass-play rule are members
of the black and Mexican-American
community. "A system that allows
them to slip through does not help
them," he said, "It exploits them."
That's something the NCAA fi
nally seems to have acknowledged.

particularly troublesome.
"That simply is not true," he
said. "The authority for that is a
study by the National Academy of
Science, which indicated no bias
against minorities. However, the
use of the test in this circumstance
does have a disproportionate effect
on minorities because of their edu
cational background."

Then the finger points at high
school preparation.
"By and large, greater amounts
of educational funds are spent in af
fluent communities and less in
others," Hanford said. "Society
produces this. We are trying to
overcome this educational deficit.
While on the average, blacks and
other minorities score lower, the
gap is slowly closing."
It should not, however, fall to
NCAA member schools to serve a
remedial function while at the same
time cashing in on athletic prowess.
That's not their job. Education is.
Students who are admitted should
be qualified academically and
whether they can run faster or jump
higher than their brethren should
not enter into the equation.
In Texas, Gov. Mark White's ad
ministration has supported the con
troversial "no pass, no play," rule
which prohibits students who fail

any course in any six-week marking
period from participating in any
extra-curricular activities in the
next marking period.
Coaches have railed at the legis
lation. "We want it refined," Eddie
Joseph, executive director of the
coaches association said. "Make the
suspension for the time deficient,
not for entire marking periods.
Don't make it punitive. The way it
is now, it does not motivate. It is
not encouraging. It is discourag

Larry Yawn, director of the edu
cation division of the governor's of
fice, says the strongest supporters
of the pass-play rule are members
of the black and Mexican-American
community. "A system that allows
them to slip through does not help
them," he said, "It exploits them."
That's something the NCAA fi
nally seems to have acknowledged.
