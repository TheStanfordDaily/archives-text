# Higher Academic Standards Might Promote Excellence
##

The bottom line in the uproar
over the NCAA's establishment of
minimal academic standards for ad
mitting student-athletes was best

expressed by
James Whar
ton, chancellor

at Louisiana State
University, who

observed, "We no

longer will have students

112 majoring in eligibility."
There is a lot to be said for that.
Universities and colleges exist
the purpose of education. That
is their function, their raison d'etre.
Everything else that goes on, ath
letics included, is strictly periph
eral.
So for the NCAA to require that
athletes achieve scores (which, by
the way, are comfortably below the
national average) on standardized
tests as a condition of admission is
hardly an unreasonable request.
Black educators, however, claim
different motives in the legislation.
Joseph Johnson, president of
Grambling University, saw "a hid
den agenda at this convention, and
that was to eliminate the number of
black athletes on college

campuses."
But why would that be true at a
time when athletic programs, many
of them largely populated by blacks,
are flourishing?
Johnson added that many major
athletic programs had been built
"on the backs of poor, black kids.
Now they're saying to them, *We

don't need you anymore. We want
you off our campus.' "
But Proposition 48 does not bar
anybody from campus. What it does
is set standards for freshmen par
ticipating in athletics. What is so
terrible about that? There is noth
ing in the legislation that does not
allow academically deficient
student-athletes to be admitted,
improve their grades and then par
ticipate in sports later.
What? And miss a year of
eligibility? Wouldn't that be terrible?
There was a time not so very
long ago when freshmen routinely
were not eligible for varsity sports.
