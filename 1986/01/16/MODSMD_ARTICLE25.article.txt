second period, scored a takedown and let

Lee go for a one-point escape so he could try
for another takedown to narrow the score.
Little succeeded in getting both another
takedown and a three-point near fall, taking a
7-5 lead after two periods. The match was
nearly ended with the Cardinal grappler being
pinned, but the referee's signal came seconds
after the buzzer sounded.
In the final period, Lee recovered some
what and was able to take Little down to tie
the score at 7-7, but was unable to score
again.,
Lee's season record now stands at 19-4-1.
