## Halas' Ghost Thought To Animate Chicago 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) — Ed McCas
key is convinced that the spirit of
the late George Halas has helped
the Bears get to the Super Bowl.

McCaskey believes Halas was in
volved when Sean Landeta of the
New York Giants whiffed at a punt
attempt which gave the Bears a
surprise touchdown in their 21-0
victory that opened their
postseason play.
"No question about it, George
moved the ball on that punt," said
McCaskey, Halas' son-in-law, who
took over as Bears board chairman
after Halas' death.
Halas has been dead for more
than two years. But his memory
has been revived with every suc
cess of his beloved Chicago Bears,
who will meet the New England
Patriots in the Super Bowl on Jan.
26.
Against the Los Angeles Rams at

Soldier Field Sunday, the Bears had
hoped for inclement weather to
give them an extra edge over the
West Coast team. When the game
started, it was 39 degrees and
sunny. But as the afternoon wore
on, the skies darkened, and it
began snowing. The Bears won,
24-0.
"George was at it again," some
one remarked. "This is real Bear
weather."
Halas, who was 88 when he died,
is remembered best as a tough, jut
jawed Bohemian who took no non
sense on the football field, driving
his players mercilessly and ranting
on the sidelines against officials.
He developed the kind of physi
cal, "take no prisoners" approach to
the game for which the Bears
remain famous.
He also was known to be tight
with the dollar, but in later years
became a soft touch for helping out
players in financial need.
Eventually, he came to be known
as Papa Bear — a living legend in
the city of his birth.
Halas interrupted his coaching
career four times for various
reasons. He "retired" in 1956, but
came back again in 1959. He led the
Bears to their last championship in
1963 at the age of 68.
