# Athletes of the Year Named
## It's the Second Time For Golfer Nancy Lopez 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) â€” Nancy
Lopez, who had a record-setting
season on the women's golf tour,
was named the 1985 Associated
Press Female Athlete of the Year
yesterday. It was the second time
she has won the annual award.
Lopez was named on 48 ballots
cast by 221 sports writers and
sportscasters nationwide. Tennis
player Martina Navratilova was
second with 43 votes, followed by

basketball player Cheryl Miller
with 31 and distance runner Mary
Decker Slaney with 29.
Lopez first won the Female
Athlete of the Year award in 1978.
She is the 11th woman in the
award's 55-year history to win the
Athlete of the Year honor two or
more times. She said she was
"very pleased, very honored" at
being named 1985's best.
Her selection came as the climax to what she
called "my best season," a year in which she set
three major Ladies Professional Golf Association
records, led the LPGA Tour in many categories and
was named the association's Player of the Xear.
She won the most tournaments, five, and was in
the top 10 in 21 of 25 starts.
She set a single-season money winning record of
$416,472.
She broke her scoring record with an average of
70.73.
And she set an all-time low of 268, 20 under par,
in her victory in the Henredon Classic.
Her other victories came in the LPGA champion

ship (her second), the Chrysler-Plymouth Classic,
the Hall of Fame Classic and the Portland-Ping Clas
sic.
In 1978, her first full year on the tour, Lopez won
nine tournaments, including a record five in a row.
"I've won more tournaments in other years, but
the scoring average says this was the year I played
my best golf," she said.
And much of the credit, Lopez said, goes to her
husband, New York Mets third baseman Ray
Knight.
"He gave me a lot of encouragement. He was
right there, pushing me, sometimes when I didn t
want to play," she said. "Being a professional ath
lete himself, he knew some of the things I was going
through. He helped.
"He made me feel like being No. 1 again."
