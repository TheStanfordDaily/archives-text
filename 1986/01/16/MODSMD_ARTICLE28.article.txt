# New York's Phenom Gooden Tops Male Vote-Getters
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Dwight
Gooden led the major leagues in
victories, strikeouts and earned
run average in 1985. He won 14
straight games and pitched 31
consecutive scoreless innings. He
became the youngest modern big
leaguer to win 20 games and
earned the National League Cy
Young award at the earliest age of
any pitcher, ever.
With all these accomplishments,

what was his most memorable
moment of 1985?
'When I hit the home run,"he
says.
Soft-spoken and almost never
given to hyperbole, the 21-year
old right-hander demurs from
tooting his own horn, but the
numbers trumpet his success.
For his deeds, Gooden was
voted The Associated Press' 1985
Male Athlete of the Year, winning
over Chicago Bears running back
Walter Payton by a large margin.
In balloting released yesterday,
Gooden received 53 votes in a
nationwide poll of 221 sports writ
ers and broadcasters; Payton had
39 votes.
Race car driver Bill Elliott was
third with 25, followed by Cincin
nati Reds player-manager Pete
Rose with 23 and Los Angeles
Lakers center Kareem Abdul-
Jabbar with 20.
Carl Lewis, a quadruple gold
medalist in track and field at the
Los Angeles Olympics, won the
1984 award for the second
straight year. Gooden was the
first baseball player to win the 55-
year-old award since Willie Star
gell in 1979.
"It's different from the Cy
Young because it includes all
players from different sports in

every event, and you pick the
best one," said Gooden, who will
receive the Athlete of the Year
trophy Feb. 21 in a ceremony at
his hometown of Tampa, Fla. "It's
something I will always cherish."
Gooden's first-and-only major
league home run came on Sept. 21
at home against the Pittsburgh
Pirates. It was one of his 21 hits
on the year that set a Mets record
for pitchers. The rest of Gooden's
records came on the mound.
Gooden followed up a Rookie of
the Year campaign in 1984 by
being named the National
League's Cy Young winner Nov.
13, three days before turning 21.
During the season, he went 24-4
with 268 strikeouts and an ERA of
1.53. He put together a string of
14 straight victories from May 30-
Aug. 25, and he went 31 con
secutive innings from Aug. 31-
Sept. 21 without allowing a run.
On Aug. 25, he became the
youngest pitcher in modern his
tory to win 20 games, reaching
the milestone at 20 years, nine
months, and nine days old. Bob

Feller was 20 years, 10 months,
five days old when he won 20 for
Cleveland in 1939. Gooden also
posted the highest winning
percentage in the National League
(.857) since Preacher Roe went
22-3 (.880) for the Brooklyn
Dodgers in 1951.
His primary goal, however, is
to get the Mets into the playoffs
after finishing second in the NL
East the past two seasons. The
Mets won 98 games, but finished
three back of St. Louis in the divi
sion in 1985.
"Everybody said last year that
it boiled down to the last week of
the season with the Cards,"
Gooden said in a telephone inter
view from his home. "But I
thought it happened earlier in the
season against teams like the (San
Francisco) Giants and
(Pittsburgh) Pirates, teams we
had to beat and had a lot of trouble
with.
"I thought both years we should
have been right there," he said. "I
think we should be right in there
again."
