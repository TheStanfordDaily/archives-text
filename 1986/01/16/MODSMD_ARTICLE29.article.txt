# Debi Thomas Wears Golden Skates
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Staff writer 
Debi Thomas likes to clown
around on skates.
"When I was seven, I would get
out on the ice and try to imitate Mr.
Frick's moves," the Stanford fresh
man said of the former Ice Follies
clown. "He was my idol. I thought
he was the greatest skater in the
world. He probably got me started
skating."
Now Thomas has her own ice
comedy routine in which she imper
sonates Wanda Beazle of the Bar
rier Bouncers Figure Skating Club,
a skating beginner nervously going
through her first public perfor
mance.
Wanda Beazle has appeared on
television in many European
countries and according to Thomas,
"It's (the Beazle routine) become
like a cult kind of thing."
"I think it's hilarious," Yvonne
Gomez, the No. 7 figure skater in

the United States, said. "It's so
funny."
When it comes to figure skating
competitions, though, Thomas is no
clown, as was evidenced by her
recent victory in this summer's Na
tional Sports Festival and her fifth

place finish in the World Champion
ships. That performance solidified
her position as one of the top, if not
the top, black figure skaters ever.
Success has been the norm for
Thomas since she first skated com
petitively at the age of nine.
"I entered my first competition,
and then I was stuck," Thomas
said. "I got this medal, and I wore it
all the time. I used to wear it to
bed. It's really worn out now."
"She was this scrawny, scrawny,
skinny little thing who used to jump
real well," Gomez said of the young
Thomas. "She's still got that cute
personality."
Thomas was taken under the
wing of figure skating Coach Alex
McGowan the next year and began
to climb steadily through the levels
of junior competitions.
"He has just done wonders with
my figures," Thomas said of
McGowan's tutelage. "I've made a
lot of progress each year."
As a 12-year-old, Thomas
copped a second-place finish at the

novice nationals; at the age of 14,
she moved up to senior competi
tion; and two years later she
finished sixth at the senior nation
als.
At the age of 17, she qualified for
the World Championships in Tokyo.
"At my first worlds, I came in
fifth, which was really fantastic con
sidering I didn't skate that well,"
Thomas said.
The four skaters who finished
ahead of Thomas in Tokyo had also
finished in the top four at the 1984
Winter Olympics.
While Thomas' rise to skating
prominence has been meteoric —
she was recently named the 1985
Sportswoman of the Year in Figure
Skating by the U.S. Olympic Com
mittee — it has also been due to
many hours of hard work.
"I usually start skating at 1:15,"
Thomas said of her training
regimen. "I skate an hour of figures
and an hour of freestyle, and then

I'll skate two hours of figures or an
hour of free and figures. (Although)
we usually do more before competi
tion. I end around 7:45."
Combining her rigorous training
schedule with an equally demanding
Stanford academic workload —
something few or none of the other
top-flight skaters do — is another
challenge for Thomas.
"They're not doing regular
school," Thomas said of her com
petitors. "I'm trying to show other
people it's possible."
"I've never tried to handle col
lege education and skating at the
same time," Brian Boitano, the top
ranked male figure skater in the
United States, said. "It's really
hard. I think her head's on straight.
That's basically why she can handle
both things as well as anybody
can."
In addition to the time require
ments, figure skating at the interna
tional level is also very expensive.
A new pair of skates costs Thomas
$550, and her mother, father and
brother help her foot the $25,000-
a-year bill.
"Mom is a computer program
mer," Thomas said. "She has done
everything for me. There is no way
I would have made it without her.
She supports me in everything I've
wanted to do."

The sacrifices have not been
without reward for Thomas,
though, as she has won interna
tional skating competitions in Eng
land, France, Japan and West Ger
many.
It was her victory in Baton
Rouge, La., at the Sports Festival,
however, that Thomas points to as
a career milestone.
"The National Sports Festival
was my first national win," Thomas
said. "Sportsfest was so fantastic.
The audience in Baton Rouge was
so psyched. They were so
receptive for my program, it made
me skate better than ever."
As Thomas works toward this
year's National Championships to
be held on Long Island the second
through the ninth of February, she
will be looking to hone a jumping
ability that sets her apart from
other female skaters.
"She's very athletic," Gomez
said. "She has a natural jumping
ability and her gorgeous triples
(jumps) that any girl would just die
for."
"My strength is that I'm a well
rounded skater," Thomas said. "I
have a very good jumping ability,
and then I have an artistic side. I've
taken five years of ballet."
"My weakness is just sometimes
doubting myself and letting things
take over that bother me," Thomas

continued. "I have a temper. That
same temper also makes me
strong-willed. Everybody has to
get upset over something,
sometimes you just have to let it
out."
Boitano, however, sees Thomas'
mental outlook as an asset.
"Another one of her big
strengths is her mental attitude,"
Boitano said. "She's real humble
about how she is in the sport. It's a
really good attitude. She's very
consistent. That's probably why
she is where she is now."
As for her future aspirations,
Thomas has set some high goals for
herself.
"I'm looking toward the Olym
pics," she said. "For the next two
and-one-half years, I'll be working
toward consistency. I want my
Olympic performance to be my ul
timate performance. I don't want to
have any regrets after the Olym
pics.
"My second goal is to go on to
medical school," Thomas contin
ued. "I want to be an orthopedic
surgeon."
When Gomez looks at Thomas,
she sees more than a
championship-caliber skater and
future doctor, though.
"I've known Debi for a long, long
time," Gomez said. "She's really a
nice girl, really funny. I really like
her a lot."
