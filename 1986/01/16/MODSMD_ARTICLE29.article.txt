# Debi Thomas Wears Golden Skates
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Staff writer 
Debi Thomas likes to clown
around on skates.
"When I was seven, I would get
out on the ice and try to imitate Mr.
Frick's moves," the Stanford fresh
man said of the former Ice Follies
clown. "He was my idol. I thought
he was the greatest skater in the
world. He probably got me started
skating."
Now Thomas has her own ice
comedy routine in which she imper
sonates Wanda Beazle of the Bar
rier Bouncers Figure Skating Club,
a skating beginner nervously going
through her first public perfor
mance.
Wanda Beazle has appeared on
television in many European
countries and according to Thomas,
"It's (the Beazle routine) become
like a cult kind of thing."
"I think it's hilarious," Yvonne
Gomez, the No. 7 figure skater in

the United States, said. "It's so
funny."
When it comes to figure skating
competitions, though, Thomas is no
clown, as was evidenced by her
recent victory in this summer's Na
tional Sports Festival and her fifth

place finish in the World Champion
ships. That performance solidified
her position as one of the top, if not
the top, black figure skaters ever.
Success has been the norm for
Thomas since she first skated com
petitively at the age of nine.
"I entered my first competition,
and then I was stuck," Thomas
said. "I got this medal, and I wore it
all the time. I used to wear it to
bed. It's really worn out now."
"She was this scrawny, scrawny,
skinny little thing who used to jump
real well," Gomez said of the young
Thomas. "She's still got that cute
personality."
Thomas was taken under the
wing of figure skating Coach Alex
McGowan the next year and began
to climb steadily through the levels
of junior competitions.
"He has just done wonders with
my figures," Thomas said of
McGowan's tutelage. "I've made a
lot of progress each year."
As a 12-year-old, Thomas
copped a second-place finish at the

novice nationals; at the age of 14,
she moved up to senior competi
tion; and two years later she
finished sixth at the senior nation
als.
At the age of 17, she qualified for
the World Championships in Tokyo.
"At my first worlds, I came in
fifth, which was really fantastic con
sidering I didn't skate that well,"
Thomas said.
The four skaters who finished
ahead of Thomas in Tokyo had also
finished in the top four at the 1984
Winter Olympics.
While Thomas' rise to skating
prominence has been meteoric —
she was recently named the 1985
Sportswoman of the Year in Figure
Skating by the U.S. Olympic Com
mittee — it has also been due to
many hours of hard work.
"I usually start skating at 1:15,"
Thomas said of her training
regimen. "I skate an hour of figures
and an hour of freestyle, and then
