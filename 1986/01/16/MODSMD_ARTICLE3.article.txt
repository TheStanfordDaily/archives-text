# Asbestos Study is Forthcoming

### LARRY WEBER Staff writer 
An investigation into the amount and the con
dition of asbestos in 13 campus buildings was
completed over Christmas break, and the results
will be available in four to six weeks, according
to University Vice Provost John Hughes.
Asbestos was determined to be a public health
hazard in 1975, and, according to Hughes, al
most every building on campus contains as
bestos in some form. Except for Geology Cor
ner, the 13 surveyed buildings were chosen be
cause they are known to contain sprayed-on as
bestos, which is more subject to decomposition
into airborne particles.
Only airborne asbestos particles can damage
one's health.
However, Hughes said that because of the
relatively long time it takes asbestos to break
down and become airborne, campus asbestos
does not pose an immediate threat to the Uni
versity public.

The latest information, collected by Galson
Technical Services of Oakland, is intended to
help the vice provost's budgeting office and the
University's Department of Health and Safety
develop and implement a continuous removal
program.
Past readings of asbestos taken from air sur
rounding buildings and from sources inside build
ings, near ceiling tiles and pipes upon which as
bestos have been sprayed, have been below the
accepted margin for occupational hazard, said Al
lison Zaum, an industrial hygienist for the Uni
versity's Health and Safety Department.
"We do not expect to find anything different
from what we have found already, which is quite
low," said Zaum.
The latest data will supplement an ongoing
Health and Safety inquiry into the amount and
condition of asbestos in and around University
structures and will help the University plan ap
propriate action, which is not always removal of
the substance.
"It is possible that it would be more of a health
hazard to remove asbestos from, for instance, a

ceiling tile, which would expose someone, than
to just leave it there. But the long-term goal
must be a plan for removal," Zaum said.
She asserted the necessity for a new and com
plete assessment of asbestos inventory to estab
lish such a long-term plan.
"What is really needed is consistency in
evaluating what kind of controls are to be done,"
she said.
The initial 13 buildings screened by the con
sultant firm are Encina Hall, Skilling Auditorium,
Math Corner, Memorial Auditorium, the School
of Education, Herrin Hall and Labs, Mitchell
Earth Sciences, the Geology Corner, the
Graduate School of Business, Green Library,
Jordan Hall, Building 170 and Cowell Student
Health Center.
According to University Project Manager Lois
Steiner, who is an intermediary between the
University Health and Safety Department, the
Vice Provost office, and the consultant group, all
buildings will be checked except those con
structed after 1975, when asbestos was deter
mined to be a public health hazard.
