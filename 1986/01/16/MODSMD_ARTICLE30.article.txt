## Cardinal's Rugby Side Peels the Banana Slugs 
### 
The Stanford s men's rugby team scored nine
points in the last six minutes of play to post a 21-19
comeback league victory Saturday over its host, the
UC-Santa Cruz (UCSC).
Stanford's ruggers approached the contest with a
lax attitude because of previous lopsided victories
over the Banana Slugs of UCSC. However, that atti
tude came to an abrupt end when UCSC jumped to
an early 7-0 lead in the opening minutes of the
game.
Revealing that they were not the same team
which lost to Stanford 49-0 last year, UCSC came
out aggressive and ready to play.
Party time was over for the Stanford ruggers at
that point, and it was time to regroup, especially
after captain Mike Schiller left the game with a knee
injury. Stanford cut the UCSC lead to 7-6 on a try
(four points) by Ted Layman, followed by the con
version field goal (2 points) by Andy MacTavish.
Still, UCSC did not fold and soon followed with a try.
After the score, however, the Banana Slugs missed
their conversion kick. That completed the scoring
for the first half, and UCSC left for halftime with an
11-6 advantage.
During the 10-minute halftime period, Stanford's
coach, Dave Fugimoto, asserted the obvious to his
team: They were not mentally prepared for the
game. Furthermore, since Stanford's league con
sists of eight other teams, every victory is impor
tant in order to attain the Cardinal's goal of capturing

the league championship.
If it lost to UCSC, this quest would become vir
tually impossible due to the caliber of other league
teams such as the University of Santa Clara, UC-
Davis and UC-Berkeley, defending national col
legiate champions.
The second half saw Stanford capture the lead for
the first time, when the combination of a Ted
Layman try and a successful conversion kick by
Andy MacTavish worked to perfection. That gave
Stanford a 12-11 edge.
Nevertheless, UCSC recaptured the lead by
scoring consecutive trys. Again, however, the
Banana Slugs missed both conversion kicks, and
with less than 10 minutes to play they led 19-12.
Finally, Stanford players opened their eyes and
realized that they were going to become victims of
an upset if they kept playing in their lethargic state.
With time running out, Stanford's Chris Stevens
obtained possesion of the ball, and then broke one
tackle. While in the grasp of another UCSC player,
Stevens pitched the ball to a sprinting Mike Castillo,
who ran 40 yards for the score. Followed once again
by a successful conversion kick from the sure
footed Andy MacTavish, Stanford trailed 19-18.
The Cardinal team improved its overall record to
5-2 and, with Saturday's victory, opened league play
at 1-0.
The next match for the Cardinal ruggers is Satur
day, when Stanford hosts St.Mary's University.
