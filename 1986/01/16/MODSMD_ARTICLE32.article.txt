Khadafy Will Train Guerrillas
TRIPOLI, Libya — Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy, stepping up
his challenge to the Reagan Administration, declared publicly yester
day night that he will train and equip Arab guerrillas for "terrorist and
suicide missions."
Libya, he said, is "a base for the liberation of Palestine," and, he
added, if Israel or the United States attacks it, he would "use all
forms of violence in self-defense."
Although Khadafy spoke mainly of the "unconventional" weapons
at his disposal, his remarks came a day after Soviet warships arrived
in Tripoli harbor. A fleet of U.S. warships, meanwhile, is deploying
off the Libyan coast.
Appearing last night for two hours in the hall of the National
Peoples' Congress before a crowd of about 2,000 madly cheering,
olive-uniformed high school and college students and a handful of
radical Arab figures including dissident Palestinian leader Abu Musa,
Khadafy abandoned completely the conciliatory tone toward the
United States that he had used in interviews with Western reporters
over the past week.
In the face of repeated charges by the Reagan Administration that
Khadafy already is training and supplying terrorists, including the
group headed by Palestinian radical Abu Nidal that is blamed for the
Dec. 27 attacks on the airports in Rome and Vienna, Khadafy had
taken pains until now to deny direct complicity with these groups or
their actions.
Militias Clash Despite Pact
BEIRUT, Lebanon — A major showdown between Christian
militias involving tanks and ferocious combat dealt a severe blow to a
Syrian-brokered peace pact yesterday and plunged Lebanon into a
new cycle of violence and uncertainty.
Eli Hobeika, commander of the Lebanese Forces, the main Chris
tian militia, and his followers were crushed in a counterstrike by his
own chief of staff, Samir Geagea, and Phalangist fighters loyal to
President Amin Gemayel. On Monday Hobeika launched an assault
on Phalangist positions at access routes to the mountainous Metn
region, a Gemayel stronghold.
Pro-Syrian militias entrenched in the hills overlooking the Metn
started pounding Gemayel's hometown of Bikfaya at midafternoon
after Hobeika was encircled in his bunker with his men.
Late evening reports said Hobeika and his supporters were es
corted out of their besieged stronghold by the Lebanese army.
The Christian television station, the Lebanese Broadcasting
Corp., interrupted its evening program to announce that Hobeika
was on his way to the Ministry of Defense with his aides to present
his resignation. Yesterday's battles splintered the executive commit
tee of the Lebanese Forces which had staged an uprising in March
against the established leadership of the Phalangist Party, consid
ered too supportive of the president.
Westland Scandal Intensifies
LONDON — The political storm buffeting Prime Minister Mar
garet Thatcher's Conservative government threatened yesterday to
engulf one of her senior ministers despite her efforts to defend him in
a six-hour parliamentary debate.
A confidential letter published hours before the debate
strengthened suggestions that Secretary for Trade and Industry
Leon Brittan misled Parliament earlier this week on crucial points of
the affair, which political commentators here have labeled Thatcher's
most serious domestic crisis since she won re-election in 1983.
Brittan has already been forced to apologize to Parliament when
Thatcher's office admitted Monday that it possessed a letter that he
had denied existed. Long-simmering differences between
Thatcher and her Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine over the
planned rescue of a financially ailing British defense contractor,
Westland PLC, exploded in controversy last week when Heseltine
dramatically resigned in the middle of a Cabinet meeting, then
charged Thatcher with muzzling him and running her government in
an arbitrary, unconstitutional fashion.
During yesterday's debate, Heseltine added new accusations to
support his argument that Thatcher and Brittan had quietly tried to
short-circuit the European bid while attempting to silence his sup
port for it by invoking the need for government impartiality.
Offices Blocked Amid Mystery
MASERU, Lesotho — Security forces in armored cars blocked off
government offices in this capital of the small kingdom of Lesotho for
a few hours yesterday, but the reason for the move remained a mys
tery as the day ended.
The government of Chief Leabua Jonathan, Lesotho's prime mini
ster for the last 20 years, said a bomb scare forced the evacuation of
its main offices shortly before lunch, though a three-hour search
turned up no bomb.
"It was nothing, and life is back to normal now," Desmond Sixishe,
the information minister, said later yesterday.
Not only were the main government offices cordoned off by
Lesotho's paramilitary security forces, but police patrols were in
creased throughout Maseru. Official government limousines were
seen coming and going from government offices, the king's palace
and security facilities with great frequency, at high speed and
sometimes trailed by trucks of troops.
All this took place against the background of Lesotho's increas
ingly strained relations with South Africa, which surrounds Lesotho
and is threatening to strangle its economy.
Protesters Greet Kennedy
SANTIAGO, Chile — Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), arriving
yesterday on a fact-finding trip, found the highway from the airport
to the capital blocked for nearly two hours by supporters of the mili
tary dictatorship who denounced him as a Soviet "stooge," passed
out reminders of Chappaquiddick and pelted cars with rotten eggs
and tomatoes.
Kennedy, whose criticism of the regime's civil rights record has
earned him the description of "Chile's worst enemy in the West" in
the pro-government press, was later told by U.S. Embassy officials
that they had "precise information" that members of President
Augusto Pinochet's government had "organized and financed" the
crowd of about 300 demonstrators.
Foreign Minister Jaime del Valle denied that, but the demonstra
tion clearly was tolerated by the regime since public protests by the
opposition have been consistently broken up by violent police action.
However, the Massachussets Democrat, once he had made his
way into Santiago, was himself the center of a spontaneous rally as
an anti-government crowd gathered in a plaza to hear his message of
democracy and to cheer hirfl.
