# Gorbachev Unveils New Arms Proposal

### 
MOSCOW and WASHINGTON
— Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
yesterday unveiled a proposal to rid
the world of nuclear weapons by
the year 2000.
Gorbachev invited the United
States to forget about its plans for
space-based arms and join in a
three-step program to scrap all nu
clear arsenals, using the money
saved for global development.
In Washington, President Reagan
welcomed Gorbachev's new arms
proposal, although he emphasized
only some parts could be helpful for
new agreements.
The Kremlin chief also an
nounced that the ruling Politburo
has approved a three-month exten
sion of its unilateral moratorium on

nuclear testing. The Soviet Union
began the moratorium in August.
The sweeping proposal to do
away with nuclear arms came on

the eve of a new round of Soviet-
American strategic arms control
talks in Geneva that Gorbachev and
President Reagan agreed at their
November summit meeting should
be accelerated. They also agreed to
seek a separate accord on
intermediate-range weapons.
Gorbachev's program was laid
out in a long statement that was
carried by TASS, the official news
agency, and read over the main
evening television news program.
"We propose that we should en
ter the third millennium without nu
clear weapons, on the basis of
mutually acceptable and strictly
verifiable agreements," Gorbachev
said. "If the United States Adminis
tration is indeed committed to the

goal of complete elimination of nu
clear weapons everywhere, as it
has repeatedly stated, it is being of
fered a practical opportunity to
begin this in practice."
President Reagan yesterday
welcomed the surprise new offer on
arms control by Gorbachev, al
though he emphasized that only
some parts of it "may be con
structive" in the search for new
agreements.
"At the least, it keeps the mo
mentum going," one U.S. official
said, despite some embarrassment
that senior Administration officials
in recent days had predicted that
Moscow would make no fresh offer
in the negotiations before late
February.
