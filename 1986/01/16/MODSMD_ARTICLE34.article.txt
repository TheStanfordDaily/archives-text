# White House Issues Blueprint for Spending Cuts
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — White House Budget
Director James Miller yesterday announced
$11.7 billion in spending cuts triggered by the
Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law and
claimed that they can be carried out "with a mini
mum of disruption." Agency officials, however,
said the rigid retrenchment would impose
serious hardships on some important govern
ment activities.
Meanwhile, a senior Administration official
yesterday said that the Pentagon may inflate its
budget request to protect "Star Wars."
The federal deficit would hit a record $220.5
billion this year without spending cuts, Adminis
tration and congressional budget officials con
cluded. Their estimate set into motion the
Gramm-Rudman act's automatic process to trim
thousands of government operations as of March
1.
Unless Congress intervenes, the cuts will
reduce defense spending by about $5.4 billion

and domestic programs by $5.3 billion. Another
$1 billion has already been saved by eliminating
cost-of-living increases in pensions for federal ci
vilian and military retirees.
Congress exempted some domestic programs
from the Gramm-Rudman cuts, and the Reagan
Administration shielded some military accounts.
More than $200 billion in Social Security pay
ments will not be affected, and Medicare and
other health-care benefit programs cannot be
reduced by more than 1 percent. Congress also
protected several welfare and veterans' pro
grams from cuts, but few other government
operations are to be spared the budget knife.
This first modest step toward the Gramm-
Rudman act's ultimate goal — a balanced budget
by 1991 — will reduce all unprotected domestic
programs by 4.3 percent and all unshielded
defense programs by 4.9 percent. The cuts
leave the estimated 1986 deficit at about $210
billion, barely below last year's record of $212
billion.

The Defense Department may ask Congress
for more than it needs next year for President
Reagan's proposed "Star Wars" program to
protect it from the impact of any across-the
board cuts required by the new deficit-reduction
law, a senior Reagan Administration official said
yesterday.
"It is not uncommon to ask for more than one
absolutely must have in anticipation of cuts," the
official said in unusually candid remarks about
federal budgeting in general and spending on
"Star Wars," Reagan's space-based missile
defense system, in particular.
His comment drew a quick denial from
Defense Department Comptroller Robert Helm,
who called it "a ridiculous and absurd statement
to make. Resources are scarce enough."
"Star Wars" emerged yesterday as one of the
few military projects untouched by the 1986
budget cuts unveiled by the Defense Depart
ment as a result of the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction law.
