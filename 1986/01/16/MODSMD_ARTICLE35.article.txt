Shultz for Retaliation
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State
George Shultz, taking on Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger and British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, said yesterday that the
United States should strike back at terrorists
and be prepared to use military force even
without assurance of clear victory or total
public support.
Without mentioning Thatcher, Shultz labeled
as "absurd" her recent contention that interna
tional law prohibits punitive or pre-emptive
strikes against states that harbor terrorists.
"On the contrary," Shultz said in comments
that aides described as aimed at the British
leader, such actions in defense of U.S. citizens
would be "strengthening the basis of interna
tional stability, justice and the rule of law."
Then, continuing an internal Administration
debate over the use of covert and overt force
in Third World conflicts, Shultz appeared to
dismiss several conditions Weinberger has said
must precede the introduction of U. S. forces,
including assurance of public support and a
commitment to victory. The United States,
Shultz said, must sometimes be willing to
wield military power before a consensus has
emerged and when total victory is not an op
tion or a goal.
"We do not have the luxury of waiting until
all the ambiguities have disappeared," Shultz
said. "I do know we will need the closest coor
dination between our military power and our
political objectives — because I, as secretary
of state, know full well that power and
diplomacy must go together."
Shultz's speech at a Defense Department

conference appears to foreshadow a major Ad
ministration initiative to resume military aid to
the "contra" rebels battling Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista regime. An Administration source
said yesterday that President Reagan will ask
Congress to provide the contras non-lethal and
military aid totaling $100 million, up from this
year's $27 million non-lethal aid program.
Reagan Praises King
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, who
initially opposed creating a federal holiday to
honor Martin Luther King, Jr., told children
yesterday at a school named after the slain civil
rights leader that the country is "different and
better" because of King's commitment to
justice and peace for all people.
The president added that the nation, while
"freer" than it was when King led the civil
rights movement, still had "unfinished busi
ness, and we can't rest until all prejudice is
gone forever."
Reagan's visit to the Martin Luther King, Jr.
Elementary School in southeast Washington
was part of a week of activities commemorat
ing the first national celebration of King's
birthday.
King's widow, Coretta Scott King, will meet
with Reagan in the White House tomorrow.
The month before Reagan grudgingly signed
the 1983 legislation making her husband's
birthday as a federal holiday, she accepted
Reagan's apology for a remark he made at a
news conference that "We'll know in about 35
years, won't we?" whether King was a com
munist sympathizer.

New Antitrust Plan
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administra
tion's plan to help U.S. industry compete
abroad by streamlining — and in large part
relaxing — the nation's antitrust laws received
mixed reviews yesterday from some affected
industries and cautious approval from
economists specializing in international trade
issues.
The key element in the package, approved
last week by President Reagan, is a proposed
five-year suspension by the Commerce De
partment of merger restrictions for U.S. in
dustries that have been seriously injured by
foreign competition.
Several private economists in recent
months have proposed similar policy changes,
which are intended to take the place of conven
tional protectionist remedies
But two sample industries facing import
competition, steel and electronics, reacted in
starkly different ways. The heavily protected
steel industry would rather keep its present
tariff and quota protection, industry sources
said, while the semiconductor industry, at
present under siege from Japan, would
welcome any measure that would make it
easier to compete in a global marketplace.
Prices Broadly Higher
NEW YORK — Stock prices chalked up
broad gains yesterday, continuing their
recovery from last week's sell-off.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
rose 8.25 to 1,527.29.

New Antitrust Plan
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administra
tion's plan to help U.S. industry compete
abroad by streamlining — and in large part
relaxing — the nation's antitrust laws received
mixed reviews yesterday from some affected
industries and cautious approval from
economists specializing in international trade
issues.
The key element in the package, approved
last week by President Reagan, is a proposed
five-year suspension by the Commerce De
partment of merger restrictions for U.S. in
dustries that have been seriously injured by
foreign competition.
Several private economists in recent
months have proposed similar policy changes,
which are intended to take the place of conven
tional protectionist remedies
But two sample industries facing import
competition, steel and electronics, reacted in
starkly different ways. The heavily protected
steel industry would rather keep its present
tariff and quota protection, industry sources
said, while the semiconductor industry, at
present under siege from Japan, would
welcome any measure that would make it
easier to compete in a global marketplace.
Prices Broadly Higher
NEW YORK — Stock prices chalked up
broad gains yesterday, continuing their
recovery from last week's sell-off.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
rose 8.25 to 1,527.29.
