Heroin Ring Broken
SAN JOSE — A major international ring that
brought millions of dollars worth of heroin to
the United States with the help of French, Ital
ian, Israeli and American citizens has been
broken after a year-long investigation, the
Drug Enforcement Agency reported yester
day.
The ring involved some of the same figures
whose names surfaced during the famed
"French Connection" investigation of the
1960s and dealt with all levels of the heroin
trade, from raw opium to processing labs to
smuggling, according to Larry Lusardi, agent
in charge of the DEA bureau in San Jose.
He was unable to say how much heroin was
imported, but said the trade was "obviously in
the millions of dollars." The investigation
resulted in at least one seizure of heroin when
agents confiscated a 14-pound package of the
illegal narcotic in Florida.
As a result of a federal complaint issued in

New York, the federal agency has begun to
make arrests in the case, including an elderly
San Jose couple, Rose and George Adragna,
according to Lusardi, who said many of those
involved were senior citizens.
Intel Lays Off 700
SANTA CLARA — Intel Corp. announced
700 layoffs yesterday and reported plummet
ing profits amid signs that the semiconductor
industry is rebounding from a long slump.
Intel, one of the nation's largest makers of
semiconductor chips, cited depressed condi
tions in the industry in announcing the layoffs,
which are effective immediately.
Those conditions were reflected in the com
pany's 1985 results. Intel reported revenues
of $1.36 billion with net income of $1.57 mil
lion, or 1 cent a share, for fiscal 1985 ended
Dec. 28. That is down from revenues of $1.63
billion and earnings of $198.2 million, or $1.70

a share, in fiscal 1984.
More telling in those results was a fourth
quarter loss in 1985 of $14.9 million, or 13
cents a share, and an operating loss of $60.2
million for the year. In the fourth quarter of
1984, the company earned $23.2 million, or 20
cents a share.
The meager net profit recorded in 1985 was
the result of interest income and tax benefits.
Cocaine Fire Denied
LOS ANGELES — A spokesman for
onetime teen idol Rick Nelson vehemently
denied a report yesterday that a fire aboard
Nelson's airplane just before it crashed may
have been ignited by "free-basing" cocaine.
Federal officials said they have yet to deter
mine the cause of the Douglas DC-3 crash on
New Year's Eve that killed Nelson and six
others.
