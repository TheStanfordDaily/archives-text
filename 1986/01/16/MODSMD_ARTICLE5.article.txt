# Cost-Cutting Causes Med Center Crunch
## 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
This is the first in a two-part se
ries on the effects of changes in
health care financing on the Stan
ford Medical Center. To appear next
week: doctors clash with doctors over
control of resources; doctors conflict
with administrators over control of
medical practice.
An "authentic crisis" in the
financing of health care is having an
"especially harsh" impact on the
Stanford Medical Center and other
facilities like it, according to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy.
In fact, current federal and state
medical insurance policies con
stitute so great a threat that they
may produce "a financial formula to
kill the university medical centers,"
Kennedy said.

News Analysis

In this climate, the medical cen
ter is taking on the characteristics
of a war zone, with battles being
fought on several fronts.
As physicians fight each other
over resources, administrators and
staff battle for control over medical
practice, and hospitals play tug-of
war over patients and fight the gov
ernment for adequate funding, the
cost-reduction pressures of the
1980s seem to be transforming life
at the medical center.
Everyone from doctors and
nurses to patients, technicians, stu
dents and administrators is af
fected.
The crisis began with nationwide
efforts to combat the soaring costs
of health care. National expendi
tures for health care rose from $52
billion in 19t>0 to nearly $400 billion
in 1985, constantly increasing the
health sector's percentage of the
gross national product — even
during the slow economic growth of
the late 1970s and early 1980s.
In the public domain, the main
features of the nation's reaction
have been radical changes in reim
bursement methods for the treat
ment of elderly patients insured
through the national Medicare pro
gram and of poor patients insured
through the state's MediCal pro
gram.
In the private sector, there has
been a dramatic rise in the number
of for-profit hospitals run by chains,
a rapid growth in health
maintenance organizations (HMOs)
and preferred provider organiza
tions, and increasing use of deduc
tibles and co-insurance.
Some of these changes have
been especially hard-hitting at Stan
ford. In 1983, the state began its at
tack on health-care costs by basing
reimbursement for MediCal on
hospital-specific daily rates
negotiated each year, rather than
on actual costs. The contracts are

confidential, but David Sakai, direc
tor of finance at the hospital, said
that one of the contracts paid Stan
ford 20 to 30 percent less than
costs. Sakai described the rate
negotiated for fiscal 1986 as "barely
acceptable."
Thus, despite efforts to affect
changes in payment methodologies,
the battle with the government is
one Stanford has so far been losing.
The public sector struck again in
1983, when the federal government
began basing Medicare payments
on fixed rates predetermined for
each specific category of illness, or
"diagnostic-related grouping"
(DRG), rather than on costs in
curred in treatment.
More than 35 percent of the days
spent by patients at Stanford are
covered by Medicare, and more
than 10 percent by MediCal.
At the same time, private insur
ance companies and other third
party payers such as Blue Cross
and Blue Shield began dealing blows
to academic medical centers like
Stanford by contracting with hospi
tals and groups of doctors, using
payment methods involving dis
counted or fixed rates. Subscription
to conventional insurance plans
dropped, while the number of parti
cipants in groups with prepaid plans
such as HMOs surged.
These changes have translated
into further pressures to cut costs
and to compete for patients, who
are increasingly forced to accept
more financial responsibility for
their health-care choices.
University medical centers like
Stanford, however, are less suited
than others to compete in the new
environment "because of the
severity of illness in their patient
mix and because of their responsi
bilities to graduate medical educa
tion, 1 Kennedy, who chairs Uie
Board of Hospital Directors.
In fact, a study done for Medicare
in 1981 ranked Stanford as one of
the highest in the nation in terms of
the severity of illness of the patient
population. A Stanford study com
pleted in late 1985 concluded that
the Medicare reimbursement sys
tem will only be adequate if severity
of illness in the case mix is taken
into account when Medicare
determines reimbursement rates
for its 468 "diagnostic related
groups." A patient with many
health complications who is ad
mitted for treatment often requires
hospitalization for much longer than
the DRG specifies, and the hospital
thus loses money on that patient.
In addition, physicians at institu
tions like Stanford are required to
spend time teaching medical stu
dents and fulfilling research respon
sibilities.
While the new reimbursement
methods have resulted in needed
incentives to treat the more routine
procedures and illnesses in a cost-
effective way, Kennedy said, "The
threat that the university medical
centers face is from a set of policies
that favor cost competition for the
routine stuff and then expect the
university hospitals to take on the
load of managing the severe ill
nesses, many of them in charity
patients, without adequate reim
bursement, and that is a financial
formula to kill the university medi
cal centers."
Faced with a more hostile envi
ronment, Stanford Hospital has
been experiencing a decline in its
patient census. Most of the decline
has been in the average length of
stay, which dropped steadily from
13.3 days in 1960 to 6.9 days in
1984, in line with a nationwide
trend. Hospital administrators say
they have sought to encourage this
trend as long as this can be done
without changing the quality of
care.
The decline in the length of stay
means that "the least severe por
tions of each hospitalization are
being trimmed off," Kennedy said.
"Physicians are changing their
practices, and what is left for the
hospitals to do is more severe
medicine," which is more costly be
cause of the expensive technology,
laboratory procedures and services
required.
However, the census is also a
function of the number of admis
sions, which peaked 01 in

1980 and dropped slightly to 23,572
in 1984. With a relatively steady
number of admissions but a
decrease in length of stay, the
hospital now has more empty beds.
The occupancy rate declined from
77 percent in 1980 to 72 percent in
1985.
Administrators are thus seeking
to attract more patients in order to
maintain the hospital's income.
Clearly, a battle line has been
drawn between Stanford and other
area hospitals as they compete for
patients.
"In years past, we were compet
ing in more or less a friendly fashion
for what was considered a universe
of patients," said rheumatologist
Mel Britain, who is both president
of the medical staff at Stanford and
director of "Take Care," the Palo
Alto Medical Clinic's HMO. "Now,
we are realizing that the universe of
patients is restricted, and we are
competing for the same patients."
Community hospitals are now
more likely to refer patients who
are extremely ill to Stanford be
cause, as more of these patients
are cared for on a fixed rather than
a fee-for-service rate, the hospitals
lose money on these patients.
In addition, the increasing level
of medical sophistication at other
hospitals and clinics in this area has
enabled them to attract patients
who in past years might have been
drawn solely to Stanford because of
its high level of technological ex
pertise in specialized areas of
medicine, such as heart surgery
and cancer treatment.

The problems resulting for Stan
ford may in part be attributed to a
failure to make some of the adapta
tions necessary to compete for
patients.
In several instances, for exam
ple, top physicians trained at Stan
ford have left in recent years to
practice either privately or in com
munity hospitals. Their reasons for
leaving have included the demands
placed upon them by the medical
center and a perceived failure of
the center to meet their needs for
faculty, resource and financial sup
port. These doctors have diverted
hundreds of patients, resulting in a
substantial loss in potential revenue
to Stanford.
At the same time, many efforts
to adapt in the area of competition
for patients have already been
made at Stanford. One of the most
recent developments has been the
signing of an agreement between
the clinic and Maxicare, one of the
largest HMOs in the country. The
agreement, which includes services
at the Stanford Clinic as well as ad
mission to the hospital, covers care
for thousands of employees at com
panies with Maxicare contracts.
Other steps are a rise in out
patient services, which is in line
with a national trend. For example,
the hospital opened an ambulatory
surgery center last summer, elim
inating the need for hospital stays
for procedures that are considered
minor, such as liver biopsies.
The medical center also opened
a home care program in May. The
program serves patients in

Alameda, Santa Clara and San
Mateo counties. Most of the visits
by home care staffers are to elderly
patients who would have otherwise
stayed in the hospital longer.
An alcohol/drug abuse treatment
program is also scheduled to open
in February.
Many parts of the current $112
million Hospital Modernization Proj
ect (HMP) — such as an increased
availability of private rooms, are in
tended to improve the quality of pa
tient care and comfort. Construc
tion and renovation under the HMP
is scheduled for completion in the
fall of 1987. A new children's hospi
tal is also being built, and a $6.5 mil
lion renovation of the Boswell
Building, where the Stanford Clinic
is located, is nearing completion.
Meanwhile, administrators at the
medical center continue to combat
policies in the public arena. Current
policies are bringing new issues to
the fore.
The question of whether Stan
ford can afford to treat the publicly
insured elderly and poor is one
Stanford must now address.
"We've worked hard to keep ac
tive in the area of socially beneficial
care because we believe it's an im
portant obligation," Kennedy said.
"But we're going to have to put the
MediCal contracting agency on
notice that much more of this
(inadequate reimbursement for
services), and we're really going to
have to get out.
"It's just not reasonable to ex
pect us to continue to shift costs
from those (MediCal) patients onto

the patients who are either paying
for their own health care or are
insured by private third parties, and
that is what is happening all over
the country as a result of under
reimbursement.
"We can't run a hospital at an an
nual loss," Kennedy said, adding
that neither can Stanford physicians
"run a faculty practice program at
an annual loss."
Kennedy said the problem is
more serious with MediCal, "but
Medicare is right behind."
Sakai said that not only is price
shifting unfair to paying patients,
but it is also less possible since
"many private patients are now
more price sensitive," and will
switch to other hospitals if prices
rise.
Hospital managers have been
working to hold down the rate of
price increases ever since a
directive issued by the Board of
Directors in 1982, a year in which
prices rose 22 percent, which was
"double the rate of increase in the
hospital market basket," Sakai said.
The rate of increase last year
was just under 7.5 percent, and
"we are aiming this year for 5 per
cent," said Sheldon King, president
of the hospital.
Sakai said this slowed rate of in
crease will not be sustainable un
less changes are made in Medicare
and MediCal reimbursement rates.
Medical center officials have
therefore stepped up their attacks
on the state and local policies, lob
bying through organizations such as
the Council of Teaching Hospitals

— which King chaired for more
than a year through last October —
for reimbursement methods which
they believe would be more fair to
academic medical centers.
Kennedy also lobbies Capitol Hill
legislators as a spokesman for the
Association of American Univer
sities.
The outcomes of these and other
battles being waged at Stanford and
elsewhere across the nation remain
to be seen.
For society as a whole, stem
ming rising health care costs may
free more money for other expendi
tures and may reduce employer
deductions from pay for health
benefits, as well as the cost of in
surance premiums.
Many patients will also benefit
from the improved facilities and
services offered. For some, less
time spent in the hospital and more
outpatient services like Home Care
translate into more comfort and in
dependence.
For other patients, the changes
may be harmful. "There is the
feeling among seniors that they
have been told to get out (leave the
hospital) quickly — that their time
is up as far as (Medicare) . . .
coverage," said Mary Wax, coordin
ator of the health program at the
Senior Center of Palo Alto.
Several groups, such as the
American Association of Retired
People, have expressed concern
that earlier discharge of patients
may be detrimental rather than
beneficial for many patients, espe
cially the elderly.
This is the first in a two-part se
ries on the effects of changes in
health care financing on the Stan
ford Medical Center. To appear next
week: doctors clash with doctors over
control of resources; doctors conflict

medical practice.

threat that the university medical
centers face is from a set of policies
that favor cost competition for the
routine stuff and then expect the
university hospitals to take on the
load of managing the severe ill
nesses, many of them in charity
patients, without adequate reim
bursement, and that is a financial
formula to kill the university medi
cal centers."
Faced with a more hostile envi
ronment, Stanford Hospital has
been experiencing a decline in its
patient census. Most of the decline
has been in the average length of
stay, which dropped steadily from
13.3 days in 1960 to 6.9 days in
1984, in line with a nationwide
trend. Hospital administrators say
they have sought to encourage this
trend as long as this can be done
without changing the quality of
care.
The decline in the length of stay
means that "the least severe por
tions of each hospitalization are
being trimmed off," Kennedy said.
"Physicians are changing their
practices, and what is left for the
hospitals to do is more severe
medicine," which is more costly be
cause of the expensive technology,
laboratory procedures and services
required.
However, the census is also a
function of the number of admis
sions, which peaked 01 in

1980 and dropped slightly to 23,572
in 1984. With a relatively steady
number of admissions but a
decrease in length of stay, the
hospital now has more empty beds.
The occupancy rate declined from
77 percent in 1980 to 72 percent in
1985.
Administrators are thus seeking
to attract more patients in order to
maintain the hospital's income.
Clearly, a battle line has been
drawn between Stanford and other
area hospitals as they compete for
patients.
"In years past, we were compet
ing in more or less a friendly fashion
for what was considered a universe
of patients," said rheumatologist
Mel Britain, who is both president
of the medical staff at Stanford and
director of "Take Care," the Palo
Alto Medical Clinic's HMO. "Now,
we are realizing that the universe of
patients is restricted, and we are
competing for the same patients."
Community hospitals are now
more likely to refer patients who
are extremely ill to Stanford be
cause, as more of these patients
are cared for on a fixed rather than
a fee-for-service rate, the hospitals
lose money on these patients.
In addition, the increasing level
of medical sophistication at other
hospitals and clinics in this area has
enabled them to attract patients
who in past years might have been
drawn solely to Stanford because of
its high level of technological ex
pertise in specialized areas of
medicine, such as heart surgery
and cancer treatment.

The problems resulting for Stan
ford may in part be attributed to a
failure to make some of the adapta
tions necessary to compete for
patients.
In several instances, for exam
ple, top physicians trained at Stan
ford have left in recent years to
practice either privately or in com
munity hospitals. Their reasons for
leaving have included the demands
placed upon them by the medical
center and a perceived failure of
the center to meet their needs for
faculty, resource and financial sup
port. These doctors have diverted
hundreds of patients, resulting in a
substantial loss in potential revenue
to Stanford.
At the same time, many efforts
to adapt in the area of competition
for patients have already been
made at Stanford. One of the most
recent developments has been the
signing of an agreement between
the clinic and Maxicare, one of the
largest HMOs in the country. The
agreement, which includes services
at the Stanford Clinic as well as ad
mission to the hospital, covers care
for thousands of employees at com
panies with Maxicare contracts.
Other steps are a rise in out
patient services, which is in line
with a national trend. For example,
the hospital opened an ambulatory
surgery center last summer, elim
inating the need for hospital stays
for procedures that are considered
minor, such as liver biopsies.
The medical center also opened
a home care program in May. The
program serves patients in

Alameda, Santa Clara and San
Mateo counties. Most of the visits
by home care staffers are to elderly
patients who would have otherwise
stayed in the hospital longer.
An alcohol/drug abuse treatment
program is also scheduled to open
in February.
Many parts of the current $112
million Hospital Modernization Proj
ect (HMP) — such as an increased
availability of private rooms, are in
tended to improve the quality of pa
tient care and comfort. Construc
tion and renovation under the HMP
is scheduled for completion in the
fall of 1987. A new children's hospi
tal is also being built, and a $6.5 mil
lion renovation of the Boswell
Building, where the Stanford Clinic
is located, is nearing completion.
Meanwhile, administrators at the
medical center continue to combat
policies in the public arena. Current
policies are bringing new issues to
the fore.
The question of whether Stan
ford can afford to treat the publicly
insured elderly and poor is one
Stanford must now address.
"We've worked hard to keep ac
tive in the area of socially beneficial
care because we believe it's an im
portant obligation," Kennedy said.
"But we're going to have to put the
MediCal contracting agency on
notice that much more of this
(inadequate reimbursement for
services), and we're really going to
have to get out.
"It's just not reasonable to ex
pect us to continue to shift costs
from those (MediCal) patients onto

the patients who are either paying
for their own health care or are
insured by private third parties, and
that is what is happening all over
the country as a result of under
reimbursement.
"We can't run a hospital at an an
nual loss," Kennedy said, adding
that neither can Stanford physicians
"run a faculty practice program at
an annual loss."
Kennedy said the problem is
more serious with MediCal, "but
Medicare is right behind."
Sakai said that not only is price
shifting unfair to paying patients,
but it is also less possible since
"many private patients are now
more price sensitive," and will
switch to other hospitals if prices
rise.
Hospital managers have been
working to hold down the rate of
price increases ever since a
directive issued by the Board of
Directors in 1982, a year in which
prices rose 22 percent, which was
"double the rate of increase in the
hospital market basket," Sakai said.
The rate of increase last year
was just under 7.5 percent, and
"we are aiming this year for 5 per
cent," said Sheldon King, president
of the hospital.
Sakai said this slowed rate of in
crease will not be sustainable un
less changes are made in Medicare
and MediCal reimbursement rates.
Medical center officials have
therefore stepped up their attacks
on the state and local policies, lob
bying through organizations such as
the Council of Teaching Hospitals

— which King chaired for more
than a year through last October —
for reimbursement methods which
they believe would be more fair to
academic medical centers.
Kennedy also lobbies Capitol Hill
legislators as a spokesman for the
Association of American Univer
sities.
The outcomes of these and other
battles being waged at Stanford and
elsewhere across the nation remain
to be seen.
For society as a whole, stem
ming rising health care costs may
free more money for other expendi
tures and may reduce employer
deductions from pay for health
benefits, as well as the cost of in
surance premiums.
Many patients will also benefit
from the improved facilities and
services offered. For some, less
time spent in the hospital and more
outpatient services like Home Care
translate into more comfort and in
dependence.
For other patients, the changes
may be harmful. "There is the
feeling among seniors that they
have been told to get out (leave the
hospital) quickly — that their time
is up as far as (Medicare) . . .
coverage," said Mary Wax, coordin
ator of the health program at the
Senior Center of Palo Alto.
Several groups, such as the
American Association of Retired
People, have expressed concern
that earlier discharge of patients
may be detrimental rather than
beneficial for many patients, espe
cially the elderly.
This is the first in a two-part se
ries on the effects of changes in
health care financing on the Stan
ford Medical Center. To appear next
week: doctors clash with doctors over
control of resources; doctors conflict
with administrators over control of
medical practice.
An "authentic crisis" in the
financing of health care is having an
"especially harsh" impact on the
Stanford Medical Center and other
facilities like it, according to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy.
In fact, current federal and state
medical insurance policies con
stitute so great a threat that they
may produce "a financial formula to
kill the university medical centers,"
Kennedy said.

News Analysis

In this climate, the medical cen
ter is taking on the characteristics
of a war zone, with battles being
fought on several fronts.
As physicians fight each other
over resources, administrators and
staff battle for control over medical
practice, and hospitals play tug-of
war over patients and fight the gov
ernment for adequate funding, the
cost-reduction pressures of the
1980s seem to be transforming life
at the medical center.
Everyone from doctors and
nurses to patients, technicians, stu
dents and administrators is af
fected.
The crisis began with nationwide
efforts to combat the soaring costs
of health care. National expendi
tures for health care rose from $52
billion in 19t>0 to nearly $400 billion
in 1985, constantly increasing the
health sector's percentage of the
gross national product — even
during the slow economic growth of
the late 1970s and early 1980s.
In the public domain, the main
features of the nation's reaction
have been radical changes in reim
bursement methods for the treat
ment of elderly patients insured
through the national Medicare pro
gram and of poor patients insured
through the state's MediCal pro
gram.
In the private sector, there has
been a dramatic rise in the number
of for-profit hospitals run by chains,
a rapid growth in health
maintenance organizations (HMOs)
and preferred provider organiza
tions, and increasing use of deduc
tibles and co-insurance.
Some of these changes have
been especially hard-hitting at Stan
ford. In 1983, the state began its at
tack on health-care costs by basing
reimbursement for MediCal on
hospital-specific daily rates
negotiated each year, rather than
on actual costs. The contracts are

confidential, but David Sakai, direc
tor of finance at the hospital, said
that one of the contracts paid Stan
ford 20 to 30 percent less than
costs. Sakai described the rate
negotiated for fiscal 1986 as "barely
acceptable."
Thus, despite efforts to affect
changes in payment methodologies,
the battle with the government is
one Stanford has so far been losing.
The public sector struck again in
1983, when the federal government
began basing Medicare payments
on fixed rates predetermined for
each specific category of illness, or
"diagnostic-related grouping"
(DRG), rather than on costs in
curred in treatment.
More than 35 percent of the days
spent by patients at Stanford are
covered by Medicare, and more
than 10 percent by MediCal.
At the same time, private insur
ance companies and other third
party payers such as Blue Cross
and Blue Shield began dealing blows
to academic medical centers like
Stanford by contracting with hospi
tals and groups of doctors, using
payment methods involving dis
counted or fixed rates. Subscription
to conventional insurance plans
dropped, while the number of parti
cipants in groups with prepaid plans
such as HMOs surged.
These changes have translated
into further pressures to cut costs
and to compete for patients, who
are increasingly forced to accept
more financial responsibility for
their health-care choices.
University medical centers like
Stanford, however, are less suited
than others to compete in the new
environment "because of the
severity of illness in their patient
mix and because of their responsi
bilities to graduate medical educa
tion, 1 Kennedy, who chairs Uie
Board of Hospital Directors.
In fact, a study done for Medicare
in 1981 ranked Stanford as one of
the highest in the nation in terms of
the severity of illness of the patient
population. A Stanford study com
pleted in late 1985 concluded that
the Medicare reimbursement sys
tem will only be adequate if severity
of illness in the case mix is taken
into account when Medicare
determines reimbursement rates
for its 468 "diagnostic related
groups." A patient with many
health complications who is ad
mitted for treatment often requires
hospitalization for much longer than
the DRG specifies, and the hospital
thus loses money on that patient.
In addition, physicians at institu
tions like Stanford are required to
spend time teaching medical stu
dents and fulfilling research respon
sibilities.
While the new reimbursement
methods have resulted in needed
incentives to treat the more routine
procedures and illnesses in a cost-
effective way, Kennedy said, "The
threat that the university medical
centers face is from a set of policies
that favor cost competition for the
routine stuff and then expect the
university hospitals to take on the
load of managing the severe ill
nesses, many of them in charity
patients, without adequate reim
bursement, and that is a financial
formula to kill the university medi
cal centers."

The question of whether Stan
ford can afford to treat the publicly
insured elderly and poor is one
Stanford must now address.
"We've worked hard to keep ac
tive in the area of socially beneficial
care because we believe it's an im
portant obligation," Kennedy said.
"But we're going to have to put the
MediCal contracting agency on
notice that much more of this
(inadequate reimbursement for
services), and we're really going to
have to get out.
"It's just not reasonable to ex
pect us to continue to shift costs
from those (MediCal) patients onto

the patients who are either paying
for their own health care or are
insured by private third parties, and
that is what is happening all over
the country as a result of under
reimbursement.
"We can't run a hospital at an an
nual loss," Kennedy said, adding
that neither can Stanford physicians
"run a faculty practice program at
an annual loss."
Kennedy said the problem is
more serious with MediCal, "but
Medicare is right behind."
Sakai said that not only is price
shifting unfair to paying patients,
but it is also less possible since
"many private patients are now
more price sensitive," and will
switch to other hospitals if prices
rise.
Hospital managers have been
working to hold down the rate of
price increases ever since a
directive issued by the Board of
Directors in 1982, a year in which
prices rose 22 percent, which was
"double the rate of increase in the
hospital market basket," Sakai said.
The rate of increase last year
was just under 7.5 percent, and
"we are aiming this year for 5 per
cent," said Sheldon King, president
of the hospital.
Sakai said this slowed rate of in
crease will not be sustainable un
less changes are made in Medicare
and MediCal reimbursement rates.
Medical center officials have
therefore stepped up their attacks
on the state and local policies, lob
bying through organizations such as
the Council of Teaching Hospitals

— which King chaired for more
than a year through last October —
for reimbursement methods which
they believe would be more fair to
academic medical centers.
Kennedy also lobbies Capitol Hill
legislators as a spokesman for the
Association of American Univer
sities.
The outcomes of these and other
battles being waged at Stanford and
elsewhere across the nation remain
to be seen.
For society as a whole, stem
ming rising health care costs may
free more money for other expendi
tures and may reduce employer
deductions from pay for health
benefits, as well as the cost of in
surance premiums.
Many patients will also benefit
from the improved facilities and
services offered. For some, less
time spent in the hospital and more
outpatient services like Home Care
translate into more comfort and in
dependence.
For other patients, the changes
may be harmful. "There is the
feeling among seniors that they
have been told to get out (leave the
hospital) quickly — that their time
is up as far as (Medicare) . . .
coverage," said Mary Wax, coordin
ator of the health program at the
Senior Center of Palo Alto.
Several groups, such as the
American Association of Retired
People, have expressed concern
that earlier discharge of patients
may be detrimental rather than
beneficial for many patients, espe
cially the elderly.
This is the first in a two-part se
ries on the effects of changes in
health care financing on the Stan
ford Medical Center. To appear next
week: doctors clash with doctors over
control of resources; doctors conflict
with administrators over control of
medical practice.
An "authentic crisis" in the
financing of health care is having an
"especially harsh" impact on the
Stanford Medical Center and other
facilities like it, according to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy.
In fact, current federal and state
medical insurance policies con
stitute so great a threat that they
may produce "a financial formula to
kill the university medical centers,"
Kennedy said.

News Analysis

In this climate, the medical cen
ter is taking on the characteristics
of a war zone, with battles being
fought on several fronts.
As physicians fight each other
over resources, administrators and
staff battle for control over medical
practice, and hospitals play tug-of
war over patients and fight the gov
ernment for adequate funding, the
cost-reduction pressures of the
1980s seem to be transforming life
at the medical center.
Everyone from doctors and
nurses to patients, technicians, stu
dents and administrators is af
fected.
The crisis began with nationwide
efforts to combat the soaring costs
of health care. National expendi
tures for health care rose from $52
billion in 19t>0 to nearly $400 billion
in 1985, constantly increasing the
health sector's percentage of the
gross national product — even
during the slow economic growth of
the late 1970s and early 1980s.
In the public domain, the main
features of the nation's reaction
have been radical changes in reim
bursement methods for the treat
ment of elderly patients insured
through the national Medicare pro
gram and of poor patients insured
through the state's MediCal pro
gram.
In the private sector, there has
been a dramatic rise in the number
of for-profit hospitals run by chains,
a rapid growth in health
maintenance organizations (HMOs)
and preferred provider organiza
tions, and increasing use of deduc
tibles and co-insurance.
Some of these changes have
been especially hard-hitting at Stan
ford. In 1983, the state began its at
tack on health-care costs by basing
reimbursement for MediCal on
hospital-specific daily rates
negotiated each year, rather than
on actual costs. The contracts are

confidential, but David Sakai, direc
tor of finance at the hospital, said
that one of the contracts paid Stan
ford 20 to 30 percent less than
costs. Sakai described the rate
negotiated for fiscal 1986 as "barely
acceptable."
Thus, despite efforts to affect
changes in payment methodologies,
the battle with the government is
one Stanford has so far been losing.
The public sector struck again in
1983, when the federal government
began basing Medicare payments
on fixed rates predetermined for
each specific category of illness, or
"diagnostic-related grouping"
(DRG), rather than on costs in
curred in treatment.
More than 35 percent of the days
spent by patients at Stanford are
covered by Medicare, and more
than 10 percent by MediCal.
At the same time, private insur
ance companies and other third
party payers such as Blue Cross
and Blue Shield began dealing blows
to academic medical centers like
Stanford by contracting with hospi
tals and groups of doctors, using
payment methods involving dis
counted or fixed rates. Subscription
to conventional insurance plans
dropped, while the number of parti
cipants in groups with prepaid plans
such as HMOs surged.
These changes have translated
into further pressures to cut costs
and to compete for patients, who
are increasingly forced to accept
more financial responsibility for
their health-care choices.
University medical centers like
Stanford, however, are less suited
than others to compete in the new
environment "because of the
severity of illness in their patient
mix and because of their responsi
bilities to graduate medical educa
tion, 1 Kennedy, who chairs Uie
Board of Hospital Directors.
In fact, a study done for Medicare
in 1981 ranked Stanford as one of
the highest in the nation in terms of
the severity of illness of the patient
population. A Stanford study com
pleted in late 1985 concluded that
the Medicare reimbursement sys
tem will only be adequate if severity
of illness in the case mix is taken
into account when Medicare
determines reimbursement rates
for its 468 "diagnostic related
groups." A patient with many
health complications who is ad
mitted for treatment often requires
hospitalization for much longer than
the DRG specifies, and the hospital
thus loses money on that patient.
In addition, physicians at institu
tions like Stanford are required to
spend time teaching medical stu
dents and fulfilling research respon
sibilities.
While the new reimbursement
methods have resulted in needed
incentives to treat the more routine
procedures and illnesses in a cost-
effective way, Kennedy said, "The
threat that the university medical
centers face is from a set of policies
that favor cost competition for the
routine stuff and then expect the
university hospitals to take on the
load of managing the severe ill
nesses, many of them in charity
patients, without adequate reim
bursement, and that is a financial
formula to kill the university medi
cal centers."
Faced with a more hostile envi
ronment, Stanford Hospital has
been experiencing a decline in its
patient census. Most of the decline
has been in the average length of
stay, which dropped steadily from
13.3 days in 1960 to 6.9 days in
1984, in line with a nationwide
trend. Hospital administrators say
they have sought to encourage this
trend as long as this can be done
without changing the quality of
care.
The decline in the length of stay
means that "the least severe por
tions of each hospitalization are
being trimmed off," Kennedy said.
"Physicians are changing their
practices, and what is left for the
hospitals to do is more severe
medicine," which is more costly be
cause of the expensive technology,
laboratory procedures and services
required.
However, the census is also a
function of the number of admis
sions, which peaked 01 in

1980 and dropped slightly to 23,572
in 1984. With a relatively steady
number of admissions but a
decrease in length of stay, the
hospital now has more empty beds.
The occupancy rate declined from
77 percent in 1980 to 72 percent in
1985.
Administrators are thus seeking
to attract more patients in order to
maintain the hospital's income.
Clearly, a battle line has been
drawn between Stanford and other
area hospitals as they compete for
patients.
"In years past, we were compet
ing in more or less a friendly fashion
for what was considered a universe
of patients," said rheumatologist
Mel Britain, who is both president
of the medical staff at Stanford and
director of "Take Care," the Palo
Alto Medical Clinic's HMO. "Now,
we are realizing that the universe of
patients is restricted, and we are
competing for the same patients."
Community hospitals are now
more likely to refer patients who
are extremely ill to Stanford be
cause, as more of these patients
are cared for on a fixed rather than
a fee-for-service rate, the hospitals
lose money on these patients.
In addition, the increasing level
of medical sophistication at other
hospitals and clinics in this area has
enabled them to attract patients
who in past years might have been
drawn solely to Stanford because of
its high level of technological ex
pertise in specialized areas of
medicine, such as heart surgery
and cancer treatment.

The problems resulting for Stan
ford may in part be attributed to a
failure to make some of the adapta
tions necessary to compete for
patients.
In several instances, for exam
ple, top physicians trained at Stan
ford have left in recent years to
practice either privately or in com
munity hospitals. Their reasons for
leaving have included the demands
placed upon them by the medical
center and a perceived failure of
the center to meet their needs for
faculty, resource and financial sup
port. These doctors have diverted
hundreds of patients, resulting in a
substantial loss in potential revenue
to Stanford.
At the same time, many efforts
to adapt in the area of competition
for patients have already been
made at Stanford. One of the most
recent developments has been the
signing of an agreement between
the clinic and Maxicare, one of the
largest HMOs in the country. The
agreement, which includes services
at the Stanford Clinic as well as ad
mission to the hospital, covers care
for thousands of employees at com
panies with Maxicare contracts.
Other steps are a rise in out
patient services, which is in line
with a national trend. For example,
the hospital opened an ambulatory
surgery center last summer, elim
inating the need for hospital stays
for procedures that are considered
minor, such as liver biopsies.
The medical center also opened
a home care program in May. The
program serves patients in

Alameda, Santa Clara and San
Mateo counties. Most of the visits
by home care staffers are to elderly
patients who would have otherwise
stayed in the hospital longer.
An alcohol/drug abuse treatment
program is also scheduled to open
in February.
Many parts of the current $112
million Hospital Modernization Proj
ect (HMP) — such as an increased
availability of private rooms, are in
tended to improve the quality of pa
tient care and comfort. Construc
tion and renovation under the HMP
is scheduled for completion in the
fall of 1987. A new children's hospi
tal is also being built, and a $6.5 mil
lion renovation of the Boswell
Building, where the Stanford Clinic
is located, is nearing completion.
Meanwhile, administrators at the
medical center continue to combat
policies in the public arena. Current
policies are bringing new issues to
the fore.
The question of whether Stan
ford can afford to treat the publicly
insured elderly and poor is one

"We've worked hard to keep ac

that neither can Stanford physicians
"run a faculty practice program at

more serious with MediCal, "but
Medicare is right behind."
Sakai said that not only is price

but it is also less possible since
"many private patients are now

switch to other hospitals if prices

bursement methods for the treat
ment of elderly patients insured
through the national Medicare pro
gram and of poor patients insured
through the state's MediCal pro
gram.
In the private sector, there has
been a dramatic rise in the number
of for-profit hospitals run by chains,
a rapid growth in health
maintenance organizations (HMOs)
and preferred provider organiza
tions, and increasing use of deduc
tibles and co-insurance.
Some of these changes have
been especially hard-hitting at Stan
ford. In 1983, the state began its at
tack on health-care costs by basing
reimbursement for MediCal on
hospital-specific daily rates
negotiated each year, rather than
on actual costs. The contracts are

confidential, but David Sakai, direc
tor of finance at the hospital, said
that one of the contracts paid Stan
ford 20 to 30 percent less than
costs. Sakai described the rate
negotiated for fiscal 1986 as "barely
acceptable."
Thus, despite efforts to affect
changes in payment methodologies,
the battle with the government is
one Stanford has so far been losing.
The public sector struck again in
1983, when the federal government
began basing Medicare payments
on fixed rates predetermined for
each specific category of illness, or
"diagnostic-related grouping"
(DRG), rather than on costs in
curred in treatment.
More than 35 percent of the days
spent by patients at Stanford are
covered by Medicare, and more
than 10 percent by MediCal.
At the same time, private insur
ance companies and other third
party payers such as Blue Cross
and Blue Shield began dealing blows
to academic medical centers like
Stanford by contracting with hospi
tals and groups of doctors, using
payment methods involving dis
counted or fixed rates. Subscription
to conventional insurance plans
dropped, while the number of parti
cipants in groups with prepaid plans
such as HMOs surged.
These changes have translated
into further pressures to cut costs
and to compete for patients, who
are increasingly forced to accept
more financial responsibility for
their health-care choices.
University medical centers like
Stanford, however, are less suited
than others to compete in the new
environment "because of the
severity of illness in their patient
mix and because of their responsi
bilities to graduate medical educa
tion, 1 Kennedy, who chairs Uie
Board of Hospital Directors.
In fact, a study done for Medicare
in 1981 ranked Stanford as one of
the highest in the nation in terms of
the severity of illness of the patient
population. A Stanford study com
pleted in late 1985 concluded that
the Medicare reimbursement sys
tem will only be adequate if severity
of illness in the case mix is taken
into account when Medicare
determines reimbursement rates
for its 468 "diagnostic related
groups." A patient with many
health complications who is ad
mitted for treatment often requires
hospitalization for much longer than
the DRG specifies, and the hospital
thus loses money on that patient.
In addition, physicians at institu
tions like Stanford are required to
spend time teaching medical stu
dents and fulfilling research respon
sibilities.
While the new reimbursement
methods have resulted in needed
incentives to treat the more routine
procedures and illnesses in a cost-
effective way, Kennedy said, "The
threat that the university medical
centers face is from a set of policies
that favor cost competition for the
routine stuff and then expect the
university hospitals to take on the
load of managing the severe ill
nesses, many of them in charity
patients, without adequate reim
bursement, and that is a financial
formula to kill the university medi
cal centers."
Faced with a more hostile envi
ronment, Stanford Hospital has
been experiencing a decline in its
patient census. Most of the decline
has been in the average length of
stay, which dropped steadily from
13.3 days in 1960 to 6.9 days in
1984, in line with a nationwide
trend. Hospital administrators say
they have sought to encourage this
trend as long as this can be done
without changing the quality of
care.
The decline in the length of stay
means that "the least severe por
tions of each hospitalization are
being trimmed off," Kennedy said.
"Physicians are changing their
practices, and what is left for the
hospitals to do is more severe
medicine," which is more costly be
cause of the expensive technology,
laboratory procedures and services
required.
However, the census is also a
function of the number of admis
sions, which peaked 01 in

1980 and dropped slightly to 23,572
in 1984. With a relatively steady
number of admissions but a
decrease in length of stay, the
hospital now has more empty beds.
The occupancy rate declined from
77 percent in 1980 to 72 percent in
1985.
Administrators are thus seeking
to attract more patients in order to
maintain the hospital's income.
Clearly, a battle line has been
drawn between Stanford and other
area hospitals as they compete for
patients.
"In years past, we were compet
ing in more or less a friendly fashion
for what was considered a universe
of patients," said rheumatologist
Mel Britain, who is both president
of the medical staff at Stanford and
director of "Take Care," the Palo
Alto Medical Clinic's HMO. "Now,
we are realizing that the universe of
patients is restricted, and we are
competing for the same patients."
Community hospitals are now
more likely to refer patients who
are extremely ill to Stanford be
cause, as more of these patients
are cared for on a fixed rather than
a fee-for-service rate, the hospitals
lose money on these patients.
In addition, the increasing level
of medical sophistication at other
hospitals and clinics in this area has
enabled them to attract patients
who in past years might have been
drawn solely to Stanford because of
its high level of technological ex
pertise in specialized areas of
medicine, such as heart surgery
and cancer treatment.

The problems resulting for Stan
ford may in part be attributed to a
failure to make some of the adapta
tions necessary to compete for
patients.
In several instances, for exam
ple, top physicians trained at Stan
ford have left in recent years to
practice either privately or in com
munity hospitals. Their reasons for
leaving have included the demands
placed upon them by the medical
center and a perceived failure of
the center to meet their needs for
faculty, resource and financial sup
port. These doctors have diverted
hundreds of patients, resulting in a
substantial loss in potential revenue
to Stanford.
At the same time, many efforts
to adapt in the area of competition
for patients have already been
made at Stanford. One of the most
recent developments has been the
signing of an agreement between
the clinic and Maxicare, one of the
largest HMOs in the country. The
agreement, which includes services
at the Stanford Clinic as well as ad
mission to the hospital, covers care
for thousands of employees at com
panies with Maxicare contracts.
Other steps are a rise in out
patient services, which is in line
with a national trend. For example,
the hospital opened an ambulatory
surgery center last summer, elim
inating the need for hospital stays
for procedures that are considered
minor, such as liver biopsies.
The medical center also opened
a home care program in May. The
program serves patients in

Alameda, Santa Clara and San
Mateo counties. Most of the visits
by home care staffers are to elderly
patients who would have otherwise
stayed in the hospital longer.
An alcohol/drug abuse treatment
program is also scheduled to open
in February.
Many parts of the current $112
million Hospital Modernization Proj
ect (HMP) — such as an increased
availability of private rooms, are in
tended to improve the quality of pa
tient care and comfort. Construc
tion and renovation under the HMP
is scheduled for completion in the
fall of 1987. A new children's hospi
tal is also being built, and a $6.5 mil
lion renovation of the Boswell
Building, where the Stanford Clinic
is located, is nearing completion.
Meanwhile, administrators at the
medical center continue to combat
policies in the public arena. Current
policies are bringing new issues to
the fore.
The question of whether Stan
ford can afford to treat the publicly
insured elderly and poor is one
Stanford must now address.
"We've worked hard to keep ac
tive in the area of socially beneficial
care because we believe it's an im
portant obligation," Kennedy said.
"But we're going to have to put the
MediCal contracting agency on
notice that much more of this
(inadequate reimbursement for
services), and we're really going to
have to get out.
"It's just not reasonable to ex
pect us to continue to shift costs
from those (MediCal) patients onto

the patients who are either paying
for their own health care or are
insured by private third parties, and
that is what is happening all over
the country as a result of under
reimbursement.
"We can't run a hospital at an an
nual loss," Kennedy said, adding
that neither can Stanford physicians
"run a faculty practice program at
an annual loss."
Kennedy said the problem is
more serious with MediCal, "but
Medicare is right behind."
Sakai said that not only is price
shifting unfair to paying patients,
but it is also less possible since
"many private patients are now
more price sensitive," and will
switch to other hospitals if prices
rise.
Hospital managers have been
working to hold down the rate of
price increases ever since a
directive issued by the Board of
Directors in 1982, a year in which
prices rose 22 percent, which was
"double the rate of increase in the
hospital market basket," Sakai said.
The rate of increase last year
was just under 7.5 percent, and
"we are aiming this year for 5 per
cent," said Sheldon King, president
of the hospital.
Sakai said this slowed rate of in
crease will not be sustainable un
less changes are made in Medicare
and MediCal reimbursement rates.
Medical center officials have
therefore stepped up their attacks
on the state and local policies, lob
bying through organizations such as
the Council of Teaching Hospitals

— which King chaired for more
than a year through last October —
for reimbursement methods which
they believe would be more fair to
academic medical centers.
Kennedy also lobbies Capitol Hill
legislators as a spokesman for the
Association of American Univer
sities.
The outcomes of these and other
battles being waged at Stanford and
elsewhere across the nation remain
to be seen.
For society as a whole, stem
ming rising health care costs may
free more money for other expendi
tures and may reduce employer
deductions from pay for health
benefits, as well as the cost of in
surance premiums.
Many patients will also benefit
from the improved facilities and
services offered. For some, less
time spent in the hospital and more
outpatient services like Home Care
translate into more comfort and in
dependence.
For other patients, the changes
may be harmful. "There is the
feeling among seniors that they
have been told to get out (leave the
hospital) quickly — that their time
is up as far as (Medicare) . . .
coverage," said Mary Wax, coordin
ator of the health program at the
Senior Center of Palo Alto.
Several groups, such as the
American Association of Retired
People, have expressed concern
that earlier discharge of patients
may be detrimental rather than
beneficial for many patients, espe
cially the elderly.
