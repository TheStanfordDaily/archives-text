# Cost-Cutting Causes Med Center Crunch
## 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
This is the first in a two-part se
ries on the effects of changes in
health care financing on the Stan
ford Medical Center. To appear next
week: doctors clash with doctors over
control of resources; doctors conflict
with administrators over control of
medical practice.
An "authentic crisis" in the
financing of health care is having an
"especially harsh" impact on the
Stanford Medical Center and other
facilities like it, according to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy.
In fact, current federal and state
medical insurance policies con
stitute so great a threat that they
may produce "a financial formula to
kill the university medical centers,"
Kennedy said.

News Analysis

In this climate, the medical cen
ter is taking on the characteristics
of a war zone, with battles being
fought on several fronts.
As physicians fight each other
over resources, administrators and
staff battle for control over medical
practice, and hospitals play tug-of
war over patients and fight the gov
ernment for adequate funding, the
cost-reduction pressures of the
1980s seem to be transforming life
at the medical center.
Everyone from doctors and
nurses to patients, technicians, stu
dents and administrators is af
fected.
The crisis began with nationwide
efforts to combat the soaring costs
of health care. National expendi
tures for health care rose from $52
billion in 19t>0 to nearly $400 billion
in 1985, constantly increasing the
health sector's percentage of the
gross national product â€” even
during the slow economic growth of
the late 1970s and early 1980s.
In the public domain, the main
features of the nation's reaction
have been radical changes in reim
bursement methods for the treat
ment of elderly patients insured
through the national Medicare pro
gram and of poor patients insured
through the state's MediCal pro
gram.
In the private sector, there has
been a dramatic rise in the number
of for-profit hospitals run by chains,
a rapid growth in health
maintenance organizations (HMOs)
and preferred provider organiza
tions, and increasing use of deduc
tibles and co-insurance.
Some of these changes have
been especially hard-hitting at Stan
ford. In 1983, the state began its at
tack on health-care costs by basing
reimbursement for MediCal on
hospital-specific daily rates
negotiated each year, rather than
on actual costs. The contracts are

confidential, but David Sakai, direc
tor of finance at the hospital, said
that one of the contracts paid Stan
ford 20 to 30 percent less than
costs. Sakai described the rate
negotiated for fiscal 1986 as "barely
acceptable."
Thus, despite efforts to affect
changes in payment methodologies,
the battle with the government is
one Stanford has so far been losing.
The public sector struck again in
1983, when the federal government
began basing Medicare payments
on fixed rates predetermined for
each specific category of illness, or
"diagnostic-related grouping"
(DRG), rather than on costs in
curred in treatment.
More than 35 percent of the days
spent by patients at Stanford are
covered by Medicare, and more
than 10 percent by MediCal.
At the same time, private insur
ance companies and other third
party payers such as Blue Cross
and Blue Shield began dealing blows
to academic medical centers like
Stanford by contracting with hospi
tals and groups of doctors, using
payment methods involving dis
counted or fixed rates. Subscription
to conventional insurance plans
dropped, while the number of parti
cipants in groups with prepaid plans
such as HMOs surged.
These changes have translated
into further pressures to cut costs
and to compete for patients, who
are increasingly forced to accept
more financial responsibility for
their health-care choices.
University medical centers like
Stanford, however, are less suited
than others to compete in the new
environment "because of the
severity of illness in their patient
mix and because of their responsi
bilities to graduate medical educa
tion, 1 Kennedy, who chairs Uie
Board of Hospital Directors.
In fact, a study done for Medicare
in 1981 ranked Stanford as one of
the highest in the nation in terms of
the severity of illness of the patient
population. A Stanford study com
pleted in late 1985 concluded that
the Medicare reimbursement sys
tem will only be adequate if severity
of illness in the case mix is taken
into account when Medicare
determines reimbursement rates
for its 468 "diagnostic related
groups." A patient with many
health complications who is ad
mitted for treatment often requires
hospitalization for much longer than
the DRG specifies, and the hospital
thus loses money on that patient.
In addition, physicians at institu
tions like Stanford are required to
spend time teaching medical stu
dents and fulfilling research respon
sibilities.
While the new reimbursement
methods have resulted in needed
incentives to treat the more routine
procedures and illnesses in a cost-
