# 'Where the Wild Things Are' at Stanford
## New psychology class explores the rich world of children's books FEATURES 
### IAN HARPER 
"There are a lot of students interested in the
field, and it's a way for them to get in touch with
their childhood again. I could hear them today
after having shared their favorite picture books,
talking about how fun it was to look at these
books and remember," says Barbaranne
Shepard of the undergraduates who are taking
her class, "Children's Literature: A Psychologi
cal Perspective."
Apparently, as fast and as full of changes as
life is on the Farm, more than a few students feel
a nostalgia for the simpler, less demanding dis
coveries about the world they made in the books
they read as children.
Back then, our concerns were not whether a
Unified Field Theory existed or what the differ
ence between atomic and molecular orbitals was;
our minds, instead, worried over whether the
green eggs and ham would still be edible after
their long journey or if Winnie the Pooh could
trick the bees into letting him have their honey.
This observation may explain why Shepard's
course has become one of the "must take"
classes this quarter, the first time the class has
ever been offered at St; nford.

The waiting list for this class of 20 overflowed
the first day of registration, and even more
people showed up for the first two meetings.
Although "surprised, pleasantly" by the class'
popularity, Shepard says she remained adamant
in maintaining the class size. She expresses grat
itude to the sophomores who gave their places
to the seniors in the class.
The class will be offered again next quarter.
Securing a place even next quarter promises to
be a plum prize because it won't be offered again
next year.
The class may resume again the following
year, after Shepard returns from a year on
leave. "If there is a a prevailing sort of interest,"
she modestly adds.
Shepard received her undergraduate degree
from Earlham College in Indiana. She subse
quently earned her graduate degree in education
of young children at the Nursery Training School
of Boston and her masters in education at the
Yale Childhood Studies Center.
She continued to teach after getting married
and raising three children. Her experience in
cludes two years as child care coordinator at
Stanford and five years as head teacher of the
Bing Nursery School, which is located on

campus.
It wasn't, however, until 1976, when she took
a course in London offered through UC-Santa
Cruz, that her interest in children's literature
crystallized. She credits Kay Goines, her mentor
in British children's literature, with influencing
her development in the field.
She first taught the class to undergraduates at
Cornell University last year. Upon her return to
Stanford she realized that children's literature
wasn't offered by the English Department.
She next approached the chairman of the Psy
chology Department with the idea for the class.
Shepard said she feels that the class fills a real
need since it provides exposure to literary and
graphic art that students would not have other
wise have received at Stanford.
"A good quality children's book takes as much
thought and effort, and in many cases, much
more than writing for adults," she notes.
Among the authors of children's literature that
she admires is the controversial Maurice Sendak
("Where the Wild Things Are," "Outside Over
There") for "what he has stood for and
represented in the field in the last 20 years."
