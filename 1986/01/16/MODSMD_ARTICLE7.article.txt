# Low-Cost Patients' Apartments Started
## 
### MORTY POSNER Staff writer 
In what is apparently a first in American
health care, a short-term, low-cost housing
complex will be built near Stanford University
Medical Center with the cooperation of in
stitutional and private interests.
Groundbreaking ceremonies for the new
Flora Lamson Hewlett Apartments will be
held Wednesday. When completed, they will
house patients and their families who have
come from a great distance to receive treat
ment here.
Dubbed a "Hometel," the 42-unit apart
ment complex was made possible by the
three-way cooperation of the University, the
William and Flora Hewlett Foundation of
Menlo Park and the Assistance League of
Santa Clara County.
A few U.S. hospitals provide nearby
housing for patients and families, but this sort
of cooperation between a health institution
and private interests is unique.
The complex will be owned by the league,
the local chapter of the National Assistance

League, a volunteer service organization.
Operating funds will come from the Costume
Bank of Los Altos, the league's principal
fund-raiser.
The University has provided the land for
the apartments with a 99-year lease at $1 per
year, and the construction will be funded by a
$3,750,000 grant to the Assistance League
from the Hewlett Foundation.
According to Karen Walles of the league,
the complex will house patients, outpatients
and their families living more than 50 miles
from the medical center. Those staying in the
complex will pay $10 a day. Because space in
the complex is limited, potential occupants
will be screened by the social service division
of the hospital.
Each unit will accommodate two people
and will have a bedroom, living room, kitchen
and bathroom. A lounge, laundry facilities and
the use of a swimming pool will be available.
The league began providing housing for
patients in 1978 when it began a pilot pro
gram with three units in the Oak Creek
Apartments. The funds for the new complex
were granted by the Hewlett Foundation in
1983, Walles said.
