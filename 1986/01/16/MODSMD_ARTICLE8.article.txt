## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Unfair Taxation 
### 
Students receive financial aid for one reason:
Without the monetary support they would be unable
to pursue their education.
That fundamental connection between dollars and
knowledge highlights the problem of the tax reform
bill that calls for taxing all stipends for both under
graduates and graduates.
"In an institution like [Stanford] where under
graduate financial aid is given to those with the most
need, it would mean that the neediest would be the
most highly taxed," said Graduate Studies Dean
Elizabeth Traugott at last week's Faculty Senate
meeting.
The majority of Stanford undergraduates receive
financial aid, and with the rising cost of education
such aid is increasingly valuable.
Under proposals already approved by the House
of Representatives and waiting to be considered by
the Senate, the amount of any scholarship or fellow
ship not specifically marked for tuition or equipment
will be considered taxable student income. General
purpose grants, such as Pell Grants, would be fully
taxable.
The impact of such changes in tax policy is being
felt already.
Approximately 700 non-exempt teaching and re
search assistants now face taxation of their tuition

credits because a law that treated such credits as
tax-exempt income was not extended.
Robert Freelen, vice president for Public Affairs,
has aptly called the House proposal "devastating to
students and to higher education."
The tax proposals are so unjust that calling them
reforms is a travesty.
In a society where knowledge is not only the key
to power and progress but also a requirement for
survival, the government cannot afford to
shortchange education.
By taxing financial aid, the government is putting
yet another obstacle in front of the nation's youth.
Instead of supporting education and therefore sup
porting the future, the government is sending out
the clear message that it does not care about
educating future generations.
Worse, it is indicating that the education of the
poor is of no importance. Financial aid goes to those
who need it, and under the proposed reform the
poorest students would be paying the largest tax.
They may even be forced to stop their education.
Education is not a privilege for the rich. It is a
right for every human being.
Remind your congressmen of the importance of
education. Let them know that the tax reforms are
unfair, and tell them to vote against the proposals.
