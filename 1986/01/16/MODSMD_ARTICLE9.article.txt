Invitation Is
Gesture of Peace
It is disappointing, and slightly
embarrassing to those of us who
otherwise consider ourselves con
servative minded, that Hoover
researchers L. H. Gann and David
Gress have seen fit to dive off the
rhetorical deep end in their opposi
tion to the invitation of Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev as this
year's Commencement speaker.
The simplistic, isolationist views
espoused in their brief letters (The
Daily, Jan. 7 and 14) trivialize the
reality of today's world, and yet,
we fear, are all too widely held.
Unlike South African President
P.W. Botha and the Imperial
Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, Gor
bachev has the potential to remain
leader of the Soviet Union into the
next century — a distinction far
more influential than any conferred
upon Botha or the Wizard. There is
no reason to believe that by the
year 2000, when this year's
graduates are in their mid- to late
30s, the Soviet Union will have
atrophied into a pitiful, struggling
nation simply because we have
ignored it on idealistic grounds.
In the spirit of better interna
tional understanding — and not in
admiration of the Soviet system —
we feel Gorbachev should be
invited to speak at an institution
which represents the American
ideals of academic and ideological
freedom. We feel that Stanford is

such an institution and that Com
mencement is an opportunity for
our generation to make its first
gesture toward the more peaceful
coexistence of our two nations.
We understand that ultimately
we can only speak for ourselves
and that not everyone wishes to
invite Gorbachev to our Com
mencement ceremonies. We are
heartened by the discourse that
this issue has encouraged, and we
respect differing opinions when
they are as intelligently and elo
quently expressed as Joel Brick's
(The Daily, Jan. 6). We hope and
believe that Gann and Gress do not
represent the sentiments of the
Stanford community and that any
further opinion on the matter, pro
or con, will be grounded more in
reason and less in "silly provoca
tion."

More Space
For Intramurals
I am writing this letter to bring
out a point which the editorial (The
Daily, Jan. 13) on intramural sports
sign-ups failed to address. The
point is that at the root of the IM
sign-ups and many other problems
is the lack of facilities for student
recreation here at Stanford.

People feel the need to wait in
line so long because there is not
enough gym time to schedule all
the teams that would like to play.
Let's face it: Playing at 11:30 on a
school night may be better than
not playing, but it borders on the
ridiculous.
Contrary to the tone of the edi
torial, the fault does not lie with
the people working at the IM of
fice. They are simply working with
what the University gives them.
The remarks about the golf carts
were extremely off-base. After
officiating IMs several years, it is
my experience that those who
work in the IM office ought to be
driven around in chauffeured
limousines, considering some of
the asinine behavior that they have
to tolerate.
The facilities problem needs to
be addressed. Open court time for
basketball is especially short.
Making Maples Pavilion available at
noon does little for students who
hunger for lunch, and the few
hours at Roble gym are always
packed.
I feel there is a problem, but I
wouldn't have written this letter if
I didn't feel there is also a solution.
The solution is simply building a
proper student recreation center. I
realize the University can't just pull
out a million dollars and build one,
but preliminary planning and a
funding commitment would cer
tainly be a good start.
