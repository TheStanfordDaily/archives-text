To understand much of what we're do
ing with respect to cancer research, you'd
need a graduate degree in microbiology or
biochemistry.
But to understand how well our educa
tional programs and service resources help
both patients and their families, simply
talk to one out of every 100 Americans
who are part of our volunteer program.
Or talk to one of the 3 million who've sur
vived cancer.
The battle isn't over but we are win
ning.
Please support the American Cancer
Society.
