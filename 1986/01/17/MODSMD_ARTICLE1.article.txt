well as a panel discussion by

Speaking tonight at 7:30 in Ter

pointed by President Reagan in
February 1981. She has previously
served in a variety of volunteer
positions, including the Houghton
County Republican Committee in
Michigan, and has been a co-chair of
Michigan's Reagan-Bush State
Committee.
Since assuming her current posi
tion, Ruppe has traveled to several
Peace Corps volunteer sites in
Africa, Asia and Latin America. Re-
ferring to the worldwide reputation
of the Peace Corps, Ruppe has said
she has "the best job in Washing
ton. I get to work for world peace
and travel, and everyone thanks me
for the work of the volunteers."
The Peace Corps was estab
lished by an executive order signed
by President John F. Kennedy on
March 1, 1961. The order fulfilled a
promise made in Kennedy's Jan.
20, 1961 inaugural address: "To
those peoples in the huts and
villages of half the globe struggling
to break the bonds of mass misery,
we pledge our best efforts to help
them help themselves."
Since the first group of Peace
Corps Volunteers left for Ghana on
Aug. 30, 1961, over 120,000 volun
teers have served in 92 countries,
according to the Peace Corps
News.
