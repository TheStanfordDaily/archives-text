## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Let Paul View File 
### 
In February 1983, an all-male committee of the
Religious Studies Department denied tenure to
Diana Paul, who is part Japanese.
She appealed, but the tenure denial was upheld at
every level of the University, and her grievance
proceedings ended with University President
Donald Kennedy's decision.
In 1984, Paul filed suit against the University,
charging racial and sexual discrimination and asking
for tenure or review of her tenure candidacy. The
suit further claims there were procedural ir
regularities in Paul's tenure review because she was
refused access to her tenure file — even though
three other faculty members who were denied ten
ure had been granted access to their files.
Without full access to her complete file, which in
cludes letters from 11 experts evaluating Paul's
scholarship, the allegation that she was unjustifiably
denied tenure cannot be answered.
'We're in no position to judge the fairness or un
fairness of the (University's) decision because we
don't have the letters," said English Prof. Ronald
Rebholz, Paul's faculty adviser during her grievance
procedure.
Stanford did give Paul summaries of the evalua
tions, which quoted the letters, but "it is impossible
to tell the context of any of these remarks," Rebholz
said.

There is reason, however, to believe that the
summaries may be biased. When Paul received a
complete copy of one of the letters from an
evaluator and compared it with the summary, she
discovered that the summary focused on criticism
while omitting compliments.
There is also reason to believe that one of the
evaluators was being considered as a replacement
for Paul and that he was aware of those develop
ments, according to Rebholz.
The Religious Studies Department has never
tenured a woman. Paul "was subjected to a lot of
racist and sexist remarks" and was criticized for
focusing her research on women, according to her
attorney, Mari Mayeda.
Whether Paul's tenure denial was valid or unjusti
fiably discriminatory remains to be seen, but the
analysis cannot be accomplished without her tenure
file.
Paul's attorneys are seeking to acquire that file,
and we urge Stanford to cooperate. If the complete
file is not submitted as evidence during the trial, the
charge of discrimination can never be fully resolved
— even if the University wins the case.
Paul has the right to know exactly why she was
denied tenure, and Stanford has the responsibility to
provide that information. Refusal to do so simply
implies that the University has something to hide.
