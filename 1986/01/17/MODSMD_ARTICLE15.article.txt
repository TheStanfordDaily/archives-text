## Africans Speak on Future of Africa 
### 
The following is the position of the Stanford African
Students Association on the question of Azania, or
southern Africa:
We do not recognize the legal or moral existence of
the Republic of South Africa.
We consider the entity that is frequently referred to
as the Republic of South Africa to be a European set
tler colony on African soil.
We consider the perspectives, opinions and interests
of the current white minority colonial regime on the
southern sub-continent of Africa on all questions relat
ing to itself, its relations with others, and questions of
its perpetuation, to be fundamentally and intrinsically
Eurocentric in nature and quite antithetical to the
perspectives, interests and aspirations of the African
people.

VIEWPOINT

We consider the current struggles in southern Africa
to be not simply an anti-apartheid civil rights move
ment, but a people's liberation struggle. We consider
the issue to be not simply a question of the transfer of
power within one ongoing national entity, but rather,
the formation of a fundamentally new and different na
tion of African people operating under the ideals of
African civilization.
We consider it to be a given fact that any decoloniza
tion process must include economic pressure on the
colonizers as its central component in order to erode
the economic basis for colonization and, therefore, the
underlying real rationale for continued exploitation. For
this reason, we as African people completely, and in
the most emphatic way possible, support the notion
and the actual process of total disinvestment of foreign
concerns from the white minority colonial regime on
the southern reaches of our continent.
Our argument is quite simple. We consider it to be a
given fact that apartheid exists because of, and is
propped up largely by, Eurocentric economic con
cerns. We draw from this fact two inferences: First,
apartheid cannot exist for long without massive foreign
capital from Europe and the United States, and
secondly, the removal of foreign capital will signal the
inevitable and rapid end of apartheid.
We consider it a fallacy and a deliberate obfuscation
of the facts to suggest that disinvestment will hurt the
colonized Africans more than the colonizing
Europeans. We are completely insulted by the
patronizing implication that most Africans should not,
or are unwilling to, suffer some small discomfort in the
furthering of their own liberty. This idea is truly dis
gusting and quite irritating.
We consider it necessary in order to facilitate the
process of disinvestment, which we see as an intrinsic
and necessary part of the decolonization process, that
large and important institutions of all types, especially
those with a presumed and profoundly moral character
or mission such as civic structures and universities of
higher learning, should, and must, engage in an immed
iate process of total divestiture of all their funds from
all public businesses participating in commercial rela
tions with the economic system of apartheid.
We consider it to be our duty as responsible Africans
to support the current African liberation movements in
southern Africa in every way possible and by all means
at our disposal. The nature of the struggle will be
defined by the people of southern Africa.
In closing, let us say that our guiding principle is the
fundamental postulate that "Africa is for the African."
We simply want a continent whose structures are con
ceived by Africans and whose riches and whose des
tinies are controlled by the African people.
Divestment Activities at Stanford
As African students, we are deeply moved by, and
profoundly appreciative of, the vigorous efforts of
American students on behalf of justice and humanity. It
is truly heartening to see that there are Americans at
Stanford who are brave enough to risk their futures

and to donate their time and energy because of a
deeply felt concern about injustice and inhumanity. In
our opinion, all those students who committed civil dis
obedience have become participants in the liberation
struggle of Africa.
Resting on the premises that: Stanford is committed
to creating a better world; Stanford people are moral
people; Stanford is a true world center of learning and
research for the benefit of mankind; Stanford exists for
humanity and not for commercial exigency; and that
Stanford is committed to fair and open discussion of the
facts of apartheid and the realities of investment capi
tal.
We ask that: Stanford students, faculty, staff and
workers sign a petition recognizing that apartheid is an
unjust system and that Stanford University is in tacit
collaboration in its injustice by having hundreds of mil
lions of dollars invested in apartheid; Stanford Univer
sity make a statement as a university as soon as
possible, accepting the fact that apartheid is largely a
system of economic exploitation, and therefore that all
efforts to end apartheid must include economic sanc
tions as a central and visible part; and that Stanford
University immediately initiate a practical process of
total divestment of all funds from all business concerns
that engage in systematic commercial relations with
the economic system of apartheid.
If the premises that form the basis of this policy
prove to be unsound, and if Stanford University finds
that it will not immediately engage in a practical and
reasonable process of total divestiture, we ask, in the
spirit of open discussion and mutual respect that:
Stanford University explain fully and clearly the
reasons it will not divest its funds from apartheid and
give a full description of all those who are making this
decision on the behalf of the University as well as
whatever special interests they may have in, or with,
3outh Africa;
Stanford University call for and support a referen
dum on divestment to ascertain fully the attitudes of all
its members. Such a referendum should come after a
reasonable period of education of all Stanford commu
nity members on the facts of the issue. These mem
bers should include: students, faculty, staff and all
workers. And the referendum must be written and
worded in collaboration with all these groups;
Stanford University give material support to all
groups with a special interest in this issue to engage
actively and effectively in processes of education and
dissemination of information and ideas;
Stanford University commit itself unequivocably to
support whatever decision on divestment is dictated by
such a referendum on total divestment.
We believe that it is important for African people to
know whether or not the majority of people at Stanford
support investment in apartheid.

southern Africa in every way possible and by all means
at our disposal. The nature of the struggle will be
defined by the people of southern Africa.
In closing, let us say that our guiding principle is the
fundamental postulate that "Africa is for the African."
We simply want a continent whose structures are con
ceived by Africans and whose riches and whose des
tinies are controlled by the African people.
Divestment Activities at Stanford
As African students, we are deeply moved by, and
profoundly appreciative of, the vigorous efforts of
American students on behalf of justice and humanity. It
is truly heartening to see that there are Americans at
Stanford who are brave enough to risk their futures

and to donate their time and energy because of a
deeply felt concern about injustice and inhumanity. In
our opinion, all those students who committed civil dis
obedience have become participants in the liberation
struggle of Africa.
Resting on the premises that: Stanford is committed
to creating a better world; Stanford people are moral
people; Stanford is a true world center of learning and
research for the benefit of mankind; Stanford exists for
humanity and not for commercial exigency; and that
Stanford is committed to fair and open discussion of the
facts of apartheid and the realities of investment capi
tal.
We ask that: Stanford students, faculty, staff and
workers sign a petition recognizing that apartheid is an
unjust system and that Stanford University is in tacit
collaboration in its injustice by having hundreds of mil
lions of dollars invested in apartheid; Stanford Univer
sity make a statement as a university as soon as
possible, accepting the fact that apartheid is largely a
system of economic exploitation, and therefore that all
efforts to end apartheid must include economic sanc
tions as a central and visible part; and that Stanford
University immediately initiate a practical process of
total divestment of all funds from all business concerns
that engage in systematic commercial relations with
the economic system of apartheid.
If the premises that form the basis of this policy
prove to be unsound, and if Stanford University finds
that it will not immediately engage in a practical and
reasonable process of total divestiture, we ask, in the
spirit of open discussion and mutual respect that:
Stanford University explain fully and clearly the
reasons it will not divest its funds from apartheid and
give a full description of all those who are making this
decision on the behalf of the University as well as
whatever special interests they may have in, or with,
3outh Africa;
Stanford University call for and support a referen
dum on divestment to ascertain fully the attitudes of all
its members. Such a referendum should come after a
reasonable period of education of all Stanford commu
nity members on the facts of the issue. These mem
bers should include: students, faculty, staff and all
workers. And the referendum must be written and
worded in collaboration with all these groups;
Stanford University give material support to all
groups with a special interest in this issue to engage
actively and effectively in processes of education and
dissemination of information and ideas;
Stanford University commit itself unequivocably to
support whatever decision on divestment is dictated by
such a referendum on total divestment.
We believe that it is important for African people to
know whether or not the majority of people at Stanford
support investment in apartheid.

The following is the position of the Stanford African
Students Association on the question of Azania, or
southern Africa:
We do not recognize the legal or moral existence of
the Republic of South Africa.
We consider the entity that is frequently referred to
as the Republic of South Africa to be a European set
tler colony on African soil.
We consider the perspectives, opinions and interests
of the current white minority colonial regime on the
southern sub-continent of Africa on all questions relat
ing to itself, its relations with others, and questions of
its perpetuation, to be fundamentally and intrinsically
Eurocentric in nature and quite antithetical to the
perspectives, interests and aspirations of the African
people.

VIEWPOINT

We consider the current struggles in southern Africa
to be not simply an anti-apartheid civil rights move
ment, but a people's liberation struggle. We consider
the issue to be not simply a question of the transfer of
power within one ongoing national entity, but rather,
the formation of a fundamentally new and different na
tion of African people operating under the ideals of
African civilization.
We consider it to be a given fact that any decoloniza
tion process must include economic pressure on the
colonizers as its central component in order to erode
the economic basis for colonization and, therefore, the
underlying real rationale for continued exploitation. For
this reason, we as African people completely, and in
the most emphatic way possible, support the notion
and the actual process of total disinvestment of foreign
concerns from the white minority colonial regime on
the southern reaches of our continent.
Our argument is quite simple. We consider it to be a
given fact that apartheid exists because of, and is
propped up largely by, Eurocentric economic con
cerns. We draw from this fact two inferences: First,
apartheid cannot exist for long without massive foreign
capital from Europe and the United States, and
secondly, the removal of foreign capital will signal the
inevitable and rapid end of apartheid.
We consider it a fallacy and a deliberate obfuscation
of the facts to suggest that disinvestment will hurt the
colonized Africans more than the colonizing
Europeans. We are completely insulted by the
patronizing implication that most Africans should not,
or are unwilling to, suffer some small discomfort in the
furthering of their own liberty. This idea is truly dis
gusting and quite irritating.
We consider it necessary in order to facilitate the
process of disinvestment, which we see as an intrinsic
and necessary part of the decolonization process, that
large and important institutions of all types, especially
those with a presumed and profoundly moral character
or mission such as civic structures and universities of
higher learning, should, and must, engage in an immed
iate process of total divestiture of all their funds from
all public businesses participating in commercial rela
tions with the economic system of apartheid.
We consider it to be our duty as responsible Africans
to support the current African liberation movements in
southern Africa in every way possible and by all means
at our disposal. The nature of the struggle will be
defined by the people of southern Africa.
In closing, let us say that our guiding principle is the

ceived by Africans and whose riches and whose des
tinies are controlled by the African people.
