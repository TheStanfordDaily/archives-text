Each Person
Has a Voice
"A distinction should be made
between the individual and the
communities to which that individ
ual belongs," said Po Bronson in
his column (The Daily, Jan. 16) on
guilt by association/ethics on the
7F. Indirect contacts, he post
ulates, should not be the basis on
which people are judged: if you
help elect a president whose pro
grams exploit people, it is not the
voter's fault; if you are an em
ployee of a multinational corpora
tion that dumps carcinogens into
homeowners' backyards, it is not
your fault; and if you are a stock
holder of a corporation (or a stu
dent at a university) that invests in
South Africa, it is not your fault.
You are never at fault; it is always
the community that is at fault.
But who makes up the commu
nity? A community is, by
Webster's definition, a unified body
of individuals. A community is not,
as Bronson would like to believe,
for whatever reasons (probably to
assuage his pained conscience), an
entity that makes decisions without
individual players. There is no
community that is like a soul that
can continue on without a body; a
community is only made up of
bodies.
Certainly, in some cases, a
single individual may not have a
large share of power in a commu
nity, but to deny that your efforts
can have a long-term effect (as
Bronson is really implying), and
thereby decide not to take a stand
and/or action on many issues, is
escapism. While some may not
agree with University President
Donald Kennedy's actions on cer
tain issues, he is right when he
says, "You can make a difference!"
It would be very idealistic and
naive to believe that your single
effort will change the world, but
the collective action of all the
idealistic and naive efforts in this
world can make situations change.
A good illustration to think of this

week as we celebrate the life of
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. would
be the collective action of all those
involved in the Civil Rights Move
ment, the March on Washington,
the Montgomery sit-ins and other
actions that occurred in that era.
Hopefully the era mentioned is
not over; hopefully only a minority
of students and community
members share Bronson's views —
it will be very sad if anything else
is true.

Police Actions
Require Review
The following is a statement
released Jan. 14 by theASSU Sen
ate:
While working to develop a more
complete and unbiased analysis of
the events surrounding the Oct.
11, 1985, anti-apartheid protest and
the subsequent treatment of the
arrestees, including senior Robby
Perkins, the members of the sen
ate have reached the conclusion
that a more long-term approach
toward the monitoring of police
behavior is imperative.
Other factors have helped to
reinforce this conclusion. The
alleged harassment of blacks,
Chicanos and Asians by the police
force constitutes an additional
cause for concern. The breaking of
a journalist's hand at a Stanford
football game by a Stanford officer
as well as the alleged rough treat
ment of students at Big Game (at
Berkeley last year) by the officers
from Stanford provide a recent
historical perspective.
With these factors in mind, we
recommend that a Stanford Police
Review Commission be estab
lished. Such a body would be
composed of faculty, students,
staff, workers and administrators.
Aggrieved parties would have a
standing body with which to file
complaints.
We call on the community and
specifically the University adminis

tration to support the formation of
a Police Review Commission and to
help facilitate its creation by all the
members of the community.

Zapata Mural
An Unfair Attack
I am saddened to see academic
credit being given for the attack on
the Hoover Institution in Casa
Zapata's latest mural.
Those of us who believe that a
university should encourage
respectful debate among differing
viewpoints — however widely they
differ — can only respond to this
sort of political thinking with dis
may.

Daily'Flip-Flop'
Never Happened
Once again I write to correct a
Daily editorial Qan. 9). It accuses
me of a policy "flip-flop," because I
said on Nov. 11 that we would
cooperate with an ASSU Senate
investigation of the Oct. 11 sit-in
arrests, and then on Dec. 11 was
critical of the idea that an external
investigator be appointed to look
into the matter.
Surely it is apparent that those
are not the same thing at all. At
the time of the Nov. 11 question
put to me on KZSU, the senate
was talking about an internal in
quiry it would undertake for its
own purposes. The much later
proposal had to do with an external
investigator, to be appointed to
re-do what Law Prof. John Kaplan
had already done.
How can it possibly constitute a
"flip-flop" to give different
responses to those two very differ
ent requests?
