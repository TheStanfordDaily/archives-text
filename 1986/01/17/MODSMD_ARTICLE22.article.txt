## Operator, Help Me Place This Call 
### SMITA SINGH 
You're confronted with an im
penetrable problem set and really
need to talk to your section leader.
You need modern medical advice on
the best remedy for a hangover.
You have to figure out how to regis
ter for all your classes before Old
Union closes for the day.
To steal a current cliche, "Don't
panic." Now serving the informa
tion needs of the Stanford region of
the galaxy — 497-2300. Those
seven digits are a deceptively
simple code representing reams of
information.
Most of the time when people dial
this number, it seems about as ef
fortless as getting the weather or
time. The disembodied operator's
voice isn't any particular place; it's
just there, hidden somewhere in
the touch-tone or dial face of your
phone.
497-2300 actually represents an
honest-to-goodness office replete
with receptionist, desks, cubicles and
coffee machine — on campus,
nonetheless. What's more, real
people answer the phones. Located
at 327 Bonair Siding in the Commu
nications Services Building, the in
formation number employs 18 full
time operators and 20 part-time
student operators. The building
houses the entire Communications
Services Department (not to be
confused with the academic Com
munications Dept.), a division of
ITS.
The operators provide a 24-hour
information service. But what kind
of information resources do they
have available?
The list of data is seemingly end
less. The most widely requested
service is simple directory assis
tance; the telephone numbers of
students, faculty members, Univer
sity offices and patients at Stanford
Medical Center are all on file.
"It's more than just a 411 ser
vice," explained Communications
Services Manager Maureen Trimm.
Not only can callers ask for a spe
cific telephone number, but they
can also request a more general
referral.
For example, the operators can
provide the public with information
on the programs available at the
medical center. Or they can give an
outsider information on how to reg
ister at Stanford. They can even
refer a caller to the proper do,ctor at
the medical center or department
on campus.
Since 497-2300 functions par
tially as a referral service for the
medical center, some callers think

they have a doctor or medical per
sonnel on the line.
Operator Remy Chata says that
she gets callers on the line who
think she's a doctor and will start
telling her about their ailments. She
doesn't deny that to an extent she
functions as a pseudo-physician by
listening to their complaints and
then directing them to the right de
partment of the medical center.
"When you're an operator, in a
way, you should know everything,"
Remy concluded.
Another operator tells about the
calls she gets from people asking
about the feasibility of sex-change
operations. She says she simply
refers them to the medical center.
According to Trimm, Remy is
right about the versatility of the
operator's knowledge. They get to
know quite a bit about the facilities
and services offered on campus
through their training and then the
actual work experience.
Beyond the standard information
requests, Communications
Services, through the 497-2300
number, becomes a facilities and
maintenance dispatch service in the
evenings and on the weekends.
"If there's a flood on Branner's
first floor during the weekend, the
operators can notify a maintenance
crew when the maintenance offices
are closed," said Trimm.
But wait, there's more. The
number also serves as an emer

gency line for the police and fire de
partments after 4:30 p.m. Before
you try any prank emergency calls,
be warned that all the night calls are
taped for record purposes. Those
recordings reveal some interesting
calls.
Operator Doug White remem
bers one of his first days working at
the information service. It was
during the 1984 Olympic Games.
He recalls a woman with a "Turkish
sort of accent" threatening to plant
a bomb at Stanford Stadium.
"She wanted me to tell some
body what she was going to do,"
Doug recalls. He just relayed the
threat to the local police.
Apart from operating the Univer
sity telephone system (r J the 497-
numbers), the Com- .unications
Services Department provides an
international telegram and telex
service for the University's aca
demic and administrative commu
nity. Elaine Jackson, the operations
supervisor, remarks, "Anything
Western Union can do, we can do."
Finally, for any forgetful Escon
dido Village residents out there, the
operators keep a set of keys for
locked-out occupants. What's that
got to do with Communications
Services one might ask. Not much.
But as Georgia Riley explains,
"We're open 24 hours."
Sometimes, though, the request
for information gets quite garbled.
After all, even operators are
human.

When gathering material for this
article, I called 497-2300 to find out
where the office was located. After
listening to my request, much to
my amazement, the operator told
me to call the police station — yes,
the police station.
I tried to protest and re-explain,
but the operator insisted that I try
the police station on campus.
So, what the heck, I called the
police station on campus and asked
them to tell me the location of the
information number office. Very
slowly, as if explaining cell mitosis
to a pre-schooler, the voice from
the police station suggested that I
call the information number and ask
them where exactly they were on
campus.
Feeling slightly stupid, I started
to explain that I had done just that,
but instead I just accepted the ad
vice.
Warily, I tried 497-2300 again.
This time, the operator listened to
my predicament and suggested I
speak to "Elizabeth," whereupon
he transferred my call to her.
"Elizabeth" also heard me through
and promptly passed me on to
Trimm, who finally provided the in
formation I needed.
What a way to begin a story on
the information service on campus.
Remember, they've got information
about almost anything on campus
— just don't ask them where their
office is.

but the operator insisted that I try
the police station on campus.
So, what the heck, I called the
police station on campus and asked
them to tell me the location of the
information number office. Very
slowly, as if explaining cell mitosis
to a pre-schooler, the voice from
the police station suggested that I
call the information number and ask
them where exactly they were on
campus.
Feeling slightly stupid, I started
to explain that I had done just that,
but instead I just accepted the ad
vice.
Warily, I tried 497-2300 again.
This time, the operator listened to
my predicament and suggested I
speak to "Elizabeth," whereupon
he transferred my call to her.
"Elizabeth" also heard me through
and promptly passed me on to
Trimm, who finally provided the in
formation I needed.
What a way to begin a story on
the information service on campus.
Remember, they've got information
about almost anything on campus
— just don't ask them where their
office is.

One of the University's information operators uses her computer to access the wealth of
sometimes obscure data — a 24-hour resource to callers.
You're confronted with an im
penetrable problem set and really
need to talk to your section leader.
You need modern medical advice on
the best remedy for a hangover.
You have to figure out how to regis
ter for all your classes before Old
Union closes for the day.
To steal a current cliche, "Don't
panic." Now serving the informa
tion needs of the Stanford region of
the galaxy — 497-2300. Those
seven digits are a deceptively
simple code representing reams of
information.
Most of the time when people dial
this number, it seems about as ef
fortless as getting the weather or
time. The disembodied operator's
voice isn't any particular place; it's
just there, hidden somewhere in
the touch-tone or dial face of your
phone.
497-2300 actually represents an
honest-to-goodness office replete
with receptionist, desks, cubicles and
coffee machine — on campus,
nonetheless. What's more, real
people answer the phones. Located
at 327 Bonair Siding in the Commu
nications Services Building, the in
formation number employs 18 full
time operators and 20 part-time
student operators. The building
houses the entire Communications
Services Department (not to be
confused with the academic Com
munications Dept.), a division of
ITS.
The operators provide a 24-hour
information service. But what kind
of information resources do they
have available?
The list of data is seemingly end
less. The most widely requested
service is simple directory assis
tance; the telephone numbers of
students, faculty members, Univer
sity offices and patients at Stanford
Medical Center are all on file.
"It's more than just a 411 ser
vice," explained Communications
Services Manager Maureen Trimm.
Not only can callers ask for a spe
cific telephone number, but they
can also request a more general
referral.
For example, the operators can
provide the public with information
on the programs available at the
medical center. Or they can give an
outsider information on how to reg
ister at Stanford. They can even
refer a caller to the proper do,ctor at
the medical center or department
on campus.
Since 497-2300 functions par
tially as a referral service for the
medical center, some callers think

they have a doctor or medical per
sonnel on the line.
Operator Remy Chata says that
she gets callers on the line who
think she's a doctor and will start
telling her about their ailments. She
doesn't deny that to an extent she
functions as a pseudo-physician by
listening to their complaints and
then directing them to the right de
partment of the medical center.
"When you're an operator, in a
way, you should know everything,"
Remy concluded.
Another operator tells about the
calls she gets from people asking
about the feasibility of sex-change
operations. She says she simply
refers them to the medical center.
According to Trimm, Remy is
right about the versatility of the
operator's knowledge. They get to
know quite a bit about the facilities
and services offered on campus
through their training and then the
actual work experience.
Beyond the standard information
requests, Communications
Services, through the 497-2300
number, becomes a facilities and
maintenance dispatch service in the
evenings and on the weekends.
"If there's a flood on Branner's
first floor during the weekend, the
operators can notify a maintenance
crew when the maintenance offices
are closed," said Trimm.
But wait, there's more. The
number also serves as an emer

gency line for the police and fire de
partments after 4:30 p.m. Before
you try any prank emergency calls,
be warned that all the night calls are
taped for record purposes. Those
recordings reveal some interesting
calls.
Operator Doug White remem
bers one of his first days working at
the information service. It was
during the 1984 Olympic Games.
He recalls a woman with a "Turkish
sort of accent" threatening to plant
a bomb at Stanford Stadium.
"She wanted me to tell some
body what she was going to do,"
Doug recalls. He just relayed the
threat to the local police.
Apart from operating the Univer
sity telephone system (r J the 497-
numbers), the Com- .unications
Services Department provides an
international telegram and telex
service for the University's aca
demic and administrative commu
nity. Elaine Jackson, the operations
supervisor, remarks, "Anything
Western Union can do, we can do."
Finally, for any forgetful Escon
dido Village residents out there, the
operators keep a set of keys for
locked-out occupants. What's that
got to do with Communications
Services one might ask. Not much.
But as Georgia Riley explains,
"We're open 24 hours."
Sometimes, though, the request
for information gets quite garbled.
After all, even operators are
human.

When gathering material for this
article, I called 497-2300 to find out
where the office was located. After
listening to my request, much to
my amazement, the operator told
me to call the police station — yes,
the police station.
