## Young Writers Star in 'Winter One Acts' 
### NANCY HENRY Editorial staff 
This weekend, the Stanford
Drama Department continues its
tradition of offering student
playwrights the opportunity to have
their work staged with all the
seriousness and professionalism
that any major work would receive
here. The 1986 "Original Winter
One Acts" offer a bill as promising
and diverse as any in years past,
and, in keeping with the tradition,'
deliver their share of entertaining,
imaginative, dull and unpolished
theater.
The first offering in the three
play program is the most engaging,
best written and funniest. In
"Veering," playwright Jonathan
Greenberg has mastered a dialogue
that, when aided by the spirited

performances of Giancarlo Ferruzzi
and Macall Dunahee, holds our at
tention and, furthermore, seems to
be going somewhere; it is the most
complete of the three.
Greenberg starts with a simple
premise: Jim, a typical California
high-tech businessman who has
been driving to work and back on

Highway 280 for 16 years, finally
becomes fed up with the routine
and normalcy of his life and, without
understanding why, pulls off the
highway at Vista Point. When the
play opens, he has been sitting in
his car for hours, unaware of time
or space. There he meets Rosie, an
independent and sexy woman who
lives at Vista Point in her beat-up
Chevrolet. She wants Jim to loosen
up and "talk to her." He does, in a
way that surprises him more than
her.
As Jim, Ferruzzi transforms him
self into a wild animal, roaring his
way to a "climax" after which he is
ready to divulge all of his perverse
(to him) sexual fantasies: lusting
after his son's teenage friends,
desiring black women, having a
homosexual encounter. This fan
tasy turns to fear as Jim's hyper
bolic tirades equate sex with

disease, then love with death.
Greenberg has written some
humorously cliched and grandiose
speeches for this sadly normal man
who is caught up in every im
aginable romantic myth — the har
mony of man and nature (which of
course he can "see" from Vista
Point) and the spiritual union of man

and woman in the sexual act — the
way it was in the beginning, the
way "it used to be."
In this case, Rosie, the small
town but worldly woman, seems to
represent reality. Dunahee is strik
ingly believable as she tells Jim that
his romantic notions are bullshit,
and she humbles him with the sad
stories of the men in her life. But in
her own way, Rosie has no more of
a handle on things than Jim. The
cliches she speaks are those of rock
lyrics. She seems independent, but
it is obvious she is very dependent
on the men who define her life as
she tells it, and, in the end, as we
see it on stage.
Unfortunately the Kafkaesqe
ending of "Veering," implying the
social castration of Jim by "the sys
tem," is more awkward and over
stated than effective. This is nei
ther a powerful play nor a subtle
one, but it is interesting, with
clever, engaging dialogue, charac
ters we can relate to and an un
deniably relevant, if somewhat
clouded, social relevance.
The attributes that make
"Veering" worthy are ostensibly
lacking in the play with a title as
meaningless as its content: "Ann, a
Wall and Frank, and a Tree, and
This Could Go on Forever ..."
Admittedly, Michael Seaman's
"Ann" had the most promising
beginning of the three plays. Three
black-clad figures pushing a tree
march onto a darkened stage to the
dirge-like music of Laurie Ander
son. A voice states, "You were
born and so you're free and
therefore happy birthday." A wall is
placed in front of the tree, and the
characters leave. It's all very mys
terious and symbolic, unfortun
ately, the rest of the play is about
as mysterious as a conversation be
tween two old people about what
they should eat and what medicine

they should take — and that is
precisely what it is. Characteriza
tion of the old folks by Jennifer Ar
nold and Chris Hart (also very
funny in "Veering") is excellent, but
they have nothing to say or do, and
their talents are wasted. Music is
well used in "Ann," but its signifi
cance is not clear. The play ends
similarly to how it began. If it is
shrouded in symbolic meaning, it
may be brilliant, but that does not
change the fact that it is a boring
play.
The final piece in the program,
"Casting Shadows" by Melinda Is
rael, is almost like two plays in one;
and though the general idea of the
play is creative, the second half,
which constitutes the play's
"meaning," seems somewhat
tacked on. It drags, perhaps be
cause it is predictable. Israel could
have done with one or two charac
ters what it takes her six characters
to do.
The first half of the play is spent
introducing us to a group of people
brought together on a city bus. The
dominant traits of their per
sonalities are revealed as they in
teract with each other. Most of
them are stereotypes: jerky jock,

young businesswoman, "hippie"
guitar player, sensitive artist. A
middle-aged, out-of-luck watch
maker sets the tone by reading
comic newspaper headlines, hinting
at the terrible state of the world and
the ominous events to come.
Several times, on cue, these char
acters stop their talk, and hold
masks representing their per
sonalities up to their faces for a few
seconds, then continue as normal.
The climax of the piece is when an
explosion rocks the bus (a nuclear
attack?) and it is forced off the road
somewhere outside the city.
How the characters react to the
situation and the death of the watch
maker is typical of what we know
about them and what their masks
have suggested. The jock (Larry
Nadler) tries to take control, in
furiated when he cannot revive the
man nor move the bus. The hippie
(Carol Alexander) just sings, the
bus driver (Jamison Smeltz) feels
overwhelming guilt. Suddenly, we
are thrust back into the past of
these characters, guided by the
silent "bag woman" (Wiek Kruit
wagen — the only rider without a
mask). The scenes that follow are
explanations of why each of the

characters is how he is, and
what foreshadowings of nuclear dis
aster they have had in their past.
The bus driver, for example, wore
a horse mask. We learn that he
comes from a religious environment
in Virginia against which he
rebelled; thus the horse mask and
the display of religious guilt — his
true character — in a time of crisis.
This is an interesting but not fas
cinating idea, and the novelty wears
off long before the last character
has been analyzed/revealed. This
play is probably the most techni
cally effective. The scene of the
blast is one that reaches an inten
sity equal to any possible in a pro
fessional theater, and the music is
appropriate and well-timed
throughout.
The producers of the "One Acts"
have selected three very different
plays, and generally the directing
and acting is first rate. It is not sur
prising that the quality is uneven or
that the scripts present difficulties.
The noble purpose of the one-act
venture is to allow writers to make
such mistakes, and it is worthwhile
for the Stanford community to see
what its young playwrights are up
to.

self into a wild animal, roaring his
way to a "climax" after which he is
ready to divulge all of his perverse
(to him) sexual fantasies: lusting
after his son's teenage friends,
desiring black women, having a
homosexual encounter. This fan
tasy turns to fear as Jim's hyper
bolic tirades equate sex with

disease, then love with death.
Greenberg has written some
humorously cliched and grandiose
speeches for this sadly normal man
who is caught up in every im
aginable romantic myth — the har
mony of man and nature (which of
course he can "see" from Vista
Point) and the spiritual union of man

and woman in the sexual act — the
way it was in the beginning, the
way "it used to be."
In this case, Rosie, the small
town but worldly woman, seems to
represent reality. Dunahee is strik
ingly believable as she tells Jim that
his romantic notions are bullshit,
and she humbles him with the sad
stories of the men in her life. But in
her own way, Rosie has no more of
a handle on things than Jim. The
cliches she speaks are those of rock
lyrics. She seems independent, but
it is obvious she is very dependent
on the men who define her life as
she tells it, and, in the end, as we
see it on stage.
Unfortunately the Kafkaesqe
ending of "Veering," implying the
social castration of Jim by "the sys
tem," is more awkward and over
stated than effective. This is nei
ther a powerful play nor a subtle
one, but it is interesting, with
clever, engaging dialogue, charac
ters we can relate to and an un
deniably relevant, if somewhat
clouded, social relevance.
The attributes that make
"Veering" worthy are ostensibly
lacking in the play with a title as
meaningless as its content: "Ann, a
Wall and Frank, and a Tree, and
This Could Go on Forever ..."
Admittedly, Michael Seaman's
"Ann" had the most promising
beginning of the three plays. Three
black-clad figures pushing a tree
march onto a darkened stage to the
dirge-like music of Laurie Ander
son. A voice states, "You were
born and so you're free and
therefore happy birthday." A wall is
placed in front of the tree, and the
characters leave. It's all very mys
terious and symbolic, unfortun
ately, the rest of the play is about
as mysterious as a conversation be
tween two old people about what
they should eat and what medicine

they should take — and that is
precisely what it is. Characteriza
tion of the old folks by Jennifer Ar
nold and Chris Hart (also very
funny in "Veering") is excellent, but
they have nothing to say or do, and
their talents are wasted. Music is
well used in "Ann," but its signifi
cance is not clear. The play ends
similarly to how it began. If it is
shrouded in symbolic meaning, it
may be brilliant, but that does not
change the fact that it is a boring
play.
The final piece in the program,
"Casting Shadows" by Melinda Is
rael, is almost like two plays in one;
and though the general idea of the
play is creative, the second half,
which constitutes the play's
"meaning," seems somewhat
tacked on. It drags, perhaps be
cause it is predictable. Israel could
have done with one or two charac
ters what it takes her six characters
to do.
The first half of the play is spent
introducing us to a group of people
brought together on a city bus. The
dominant traits of their per
sonalities are revealed as they in
teract with each other. Most of
them are stereotypes: jerky jock,

young businesswoman, "hippie"
guitar player, sensitive artist. A
middle-aged, out-of-luck watch
maker sets the tone by reading
comic newspaper headlines, hinting
at the terrible state of the world and
the ominous events to come.
Several times, on cue, these char
acters stop their talk, and hold
masks representing their per
sonalities up to their faces for a few
seconds, then continue as normal.
The climax of the piece is when an
explosion rocks the bus (a nuclear
attack?) and it is forced off the road
somewhere outside the city.
How the characters react to the
situation and the death of the watch
maker is typical of what we know
about them and what their masks
have suggested. The jock (Larry
Nadler) tries to take control, in
furiated when he cannot revive the
man nor move the bus. The hippie
(Carol Alexander) just sings, the
bus driver (Jamison Smeltz) feels
overwhelming guilt. Suddenly, we
are thrust back into the past of
these characters, guided by the
silent "bag woman" (Wiek Kruit
wagen — the only rider without a
mask). The scenes that follow are
explanations of why each of the

characters is how he is, and
what foreshadowings of nuclear dis
aster they have had in their past.
The bus driver, for example, wore
a horse mask. We learn that he
comes from a religious environment
in Virginia against which he
rebelled; thus the horse mask and
the display of religious guilt — his
true character — in a time of crisis.
This is an interesting but not fas
cinating idea, and the novelty wears
off long before the last character
has been analyzed/revealed. This
play is probably the most techni
cally effective. The scene of the
blast is one that reaches an inten
sity equal to any possible in a pro
fessional theater, and the music is
appropriate and well-timed
throughout.
The producers of the "One Acts"
have selected three very different
plays, and generally the directing
and acting is first rate. It is not sur
prising that the quality is uneven or
that the scripts present difficulties.
The noble purpose of the one-act
venture is to allow writers to make
such mistakes, and it is worthwhile
for the Stanford community to see
what its young playwrights are up
to.


This weekend, the Stanford
Drama Department continues its
tradition of offering student
playwrights the opportunity to have
their work staged with all the
seriousness and professionalism
that any major work would receive
here. The 1986 "Original Winter
One Acts" offer a bill as promising
and diverse as any in years past,
and, in keeping with the tradition,'
deliver their share of entertaining,
imaginative, dull and unpolished
theater.
The first offering in the three
play program is the most engaging,
best written and funniest. In
"Veering," playwright Jonathan
Greenberg has mastered a dialogue
that, when aided by the spirited

performances of Giancarlo Ferruzzi
and Macall Dunahee, holds our at
tention and, furthermore, seems to
be going somewhere; it is the most
complete of the three.
Greenberg starts with a simple
premise: Jim, a typical California
high-tech businessman who has
been driving to work and back on

Highway 280 for 16 years, finally
becomes fed up with the routine
and normalcy of his life and, without
understanding why, pulls off the
highway at Vista Point. When the
play opens, he has been sitting in
his car for hours, unaware of time
or space. There he meets Rosie, an
independent and sexy woman who
lives at Vista Point in her beat-up
Chevrolet. She wants Jim to loosen
up and "talk to her." He does, in a
way that surprises him more than
her.
