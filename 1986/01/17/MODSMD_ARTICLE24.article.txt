# Psychological drama on campus
## Business School Markets Intense Production of 'Equus' 
### PETER MORGAN Staff writer 
"Equus," the intense drama by Peter Shaffer
("Amadeus") about a young boy's obsession with
horses, opened last night for three performances only
at Memorial Auditorium. The show has been produced,
directed and acted entirely by Stanford Business
School students, and credit should go to them for their
ambitiousness and determination in presenting it.
The play demands more than the normal amount of
shouting, crying and tension of a serious drama: It
dwells in the deepest waters of psychological abnor
mality, not just those of marital discord (the common
subject of serious drama these days). Alan Strang, a
17-year-old boy, has blinded six horses with a metal
spike, and has subsequently been placed under the
care of Dr. Martin Dysart in a state hospital. The play
takes place during the period of Alan's treatment and
follows Dysart's unravelling of Alan's brain. What
Dysart finds after learning about the parents, the em
ployer, the girlfriend, etc., are the primal passions of
sex and religion placed not on humans (women and
Jesus, respectively), but on horses. Alan's god is
"Equus," the spirit in every horse, and Dysart's task is
to remove this god to release the boy from the psycho
logical pain he is in.
If this were all there was to "Equus," the play would
have long been forgotten as some sort of perverse
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." Such is not the
case, though, because the play is more about Dysart
than his young patient. Dysart is tormented by his life
of making people "normal" by way of removing their

passions. It relieves them of the pain, but also the
"vitality" (as Carlyle called it) of their passions, and
Dysart questions just how worthwhile such a life is.
For this is Dysart's life, one so civilized as to be emas
culated, a mere shell of the "human being" that is pas
sionate, sexual, religious and, ultimately, alive.
It is this double-barrelled intensity of "Equus" that
makes it so moving, and the last half hour in which both

Alan and Dysart peak in desperation is some of the
most intense modern drama written. We are mucking
about in the world of primal needs, of civilized su
perfices and the gap between the two.
So the business school has a tall order to fill. Rather
than spout off about what I thought, here is what I
heard before, during, and after the show last night:
"That was the best thing I've seen at Stanford. I

couldn't watch the end part."
"I thought the leads were so strong, I was shaking
when the doctor described sacrificing babies. ..."
"I saw it in New York, and this wasn't as good. Ex
cept for the horses. They were fantastic."
"It seemed like a really long first act, but the second
one went by so fast, (and) it was so intense I didn't
even notice how late it is."
"The father was hilarious. Yeah, I mean scary and
hilarious of course."
"Shaffer is so indulgent in his word games and
melodrama. I didn't like 'Amadeus' at all and I only liked
the last part of this one. I wish it had just been a 20-
minute one-act, not some belabored, self-consciously
intellectual epic."
This is an intensely dramatic play in a production that
gets better and better as the evening progresses. The
pace and intensity is rather narrow at first, but the last
half hour is riveting and obviously where the cast and
director (to say nothing of Shaffer) have placed their
money. My personal favorites were the horses (ironic, I
know), a wonderful ensemble of dancers that create
(with some lighting help) an eerie mood to support
Alan's uneasiness. Choreographer Mark Juliano's
original work here is wonderful and not to be missed.
"Equus" is a play that stimulates and enthralls. Shaf
fer is taking it all on: what it is to be alive, what it is to
be "disturbed" or "normal" and where all such feelings
come from in our primal needs. There aren't any
answers, just a scary vision of what happens when we
think there are.
The last showing is Saturday night at 8 p.m. Tickets
are $7.50 with a Stanford ID card.

If this were all there was to "Equus," the play would
have long been forgotten as some sort of perverse
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." Such is not the
case, though, because the play is more about Dysart
than his young patient. Dysart is tormented by his life
of making people "normal" by way of removing their

passions. It relieves them of the pain, but also the
"vitality" (as Carlyle called it) of their passions, and
Dysart questions just how worthwhile such a life is.
For this is Dysart's life, one so civilized as to be emas
culated, a mere shell of the "human being" that is pas
sionate, sexual, religious and, ultimately, alive.
It is this double-barrelled intensity of "Equus" that
makes it so moving, and the last half hour in which both

Alan and Dysart peak in desperation is some of the
most intense modern drama written. We are mucking
about in the world of primal needs, of civilized su
perfices and the gap between the two.
So the business school has a tall order to fill. Rather
than spout off about what I thought, here is what I
heard before, during, and after the show last night:
"That was the best thing I've seen at Stanford. I

couldn't watch the end part."
"I thought the leads were so strong, I was shaking
when the doctor described sacrificing babies. ..."
"I saw it in New York, and this wasn't as good. Ex
cept for the horses. They were fantastic."
"It seemed like a really long first act, but the second
one went by so fast, (and) it was so intense I didn't
even notice how late it is."
"The father was hilarious. Yeah, I mean scary and
hilarious of course."
"Shaffer is so indulgent in his word games and
melodrama. I didn't like 'Amadeus' at all and I only liked
the last part of this one. I wish it had just been a 20-
minute one-act, not some belabored, self-consciously
intellectual epic."
This is an intensely dramatic play in a production that
gets better and better as the evening progresses. The
pace and intensity is rather narrow at first, but the last
half hour is riveting and obviously where the cast and
director (to say nothing of Shaffer) have placed their
money. My personal favorites were the horses (ironic, I
know), a wonderful ensemble of dancers that create
(with some lighting help) an eerie mood to support
Alan's uneasiness. Choreographer Mark Juliano's
original work here is wonderful and not to be missed.
"Equus" is a play that stimulates and enthralls. Shaf
fer is taking it all on: what it is to be alive, what it is to
be "disturbed" or "normal" and where all such feelings
come from in our primal needs. There aren't any
answers, just a scary vision of what happens when we
think there are.
The last showing is Saturday night at 8 p.m. Tickets
are $7.50 with a Stanford ID card.
