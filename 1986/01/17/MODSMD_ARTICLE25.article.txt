# 'Jewel of the Nile' Lacks the Romance of 'Stone'
## 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
Robert Zemeckis' 1984 "Romancing the
Stone" was an entertaining adventure fan
tasy scaled to the charms of its heroine,
writer Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner). The
plot existed as a light parody version of her
romances, and the movie worked because
it retained her perspective on her whirlwind
adventures in South America. The movie's
sequel,"The Jewel of the Nile," is a rather
dry, redundant reworking of the tricks in
"Romancing." "Jewel of the Nile" suffers by
comparison for a number of reasons,
foremost among them being it's all rather

pointless, in the first movie, Joan was
liberated from drudgery; she lived her ad
venture, enjoyed a fairytale ending, and
there was a sense of completeness about it.
The sequel has to crank itself up to speed,
and then it grinds along laboriously.
It's clear from the opening moments of
"Jewel of the Nile" that Zemeckis is a bet
ter director for this sort of thing than Lewis
Teague ("Alligator," "Cujo"). Teague, to
gether with screenwriters Mark Rosanthal
and Lawrence Konner, rework the opening
of the original, and the new version is sillier
and much more poorly staged. This holds
true for the rest of the movie as well. Joan
and Jack Colton (Michael Douglas again) are
on their world cruise and are beginning to

squabble about destinations and goals. For
tunately, a rousing Middle Eastern ad
venture comes along, complete with a sinis
terly charming prince (Omar, played by
Spiros Focas), fanatical hordes and a sage
holy man (Avner Eisenberg). The joke of
this sequel is that Joan and Jack, a fairytale
couple, need a fairytale adventure every
now and then to give their relationship a
boost. It's an amusing conceit (though not
as good as the original's), but not enough is
made of it. The emphasis this time around
is on the narrow escapes, the filmmakers'
attitude being more is better.
This is also their attitude toward Danny
DeVito — not one of my favorites from the
original. DeVito (as Ralph) gets some funny

lines in "Jewel," but his one-note, New
York-hood-in-the-Third-World performance
shrinks with time; that he's given a larger
role here is symptomatic of producer and
star Michael Douglas' sense of humor and
creativity. Comedy does not come easy for
Douglas, though he seems more relaxed
here than in "Romancing." (A friend of mine
commented "Yes — he was sure the sequel
would make money.") He certainly isn't
taking any chances with a proven formula,
and he repeats key scenes, such as a dance
interlude with him and Kathleen Turner.
Turner could perform this role in her sleep,
but her character isn't the focus here as it
was in the original; her female perspective,
which was so fresh before, is lost. So is

Zemeckis' timing and flair (demonstrated
recently in "Back to the Future"). Teague
flubs the finale through sloppy camerawork
and staging; there are too many flames, ex
plosions and loose ends to be satisfying.
When Jack rescues Joan at the last minute,
there should be some resonance between
this and the ending of "Romancing," where
Jack didn't. But the thrill is gone.
Credit for the freshness of the original
was due mainly to Diane Thomas, the
young waitress whose first screenplay,
"Romancing the Stone," was such a huge
hit. Her funny, funky heroine injected
humanity into the tired macho adventure
genre. Hollywood suffered a great loss
when Thomas died several months ago.
