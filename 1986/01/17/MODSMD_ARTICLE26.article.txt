## Monterey Peninsula Offers Scenic Luxury 
### JEFFREY MALTZMAN JOHN SAGE 
The Monterey Peninsula
Location: Two hours south of
Stanford on Highway 1
Area Code: 408
As far as quick, scenic and fun
getaways go, it is hard to beat the
Monterey Peninsula. Stanford stu
dents seeking a reprieve from pre
finals syndrome (PFS) need not
look further than the picturesque
coastside only two hours to the
south.
Monterey has changed visibly in
recent years. Increased conges
tion, traffic and the attendant
tourist shops and T-shirt stores
have combined to rob Monterey of
some of its charm. The addition of
David Packard's aquarium (no "fish
and chip" jokes, please), while a
valuable addition to the area, is in
large part responsible for the crush
of people that lines the streets of
Cannery Row.
Now, the good news. Monterey
and nearby neighbor, Carmel, are
still exquisitely beautiful towns with
plenty of charm. For those willing
to move beyond Cannery Row and
Ocean Avenue, a full complement
of scenic, affordable and romantic
diversions awaits to help you
overcome everything from
boredom to unbridled lust or even
the more negative effects of Wilbur
food service.
A tour of the famed 17-Mile
Drive is always a good way to begin
a weekend in Monterey/Carmel.
The road winds past golf courses,
houses that seem to say, "Be
thankful I let you drive by," and
beautiful white-sand beaches. The
drive has gotten to be a bit expen
sive, however, leading these
travel writers to ask every stu
dent's favorite question: "How can

I get it for free?" There are several
possible techniques.
Aside from off-roading past the
ranger station, tell the guard that
you've made lunch reservations at
the magnificent Pebble Beach
Lodge and are late for your meeting
with Lee lacocca. If you don't want
to lie, go ahead and make lunch or
dinner reservations at the lodge â€”
this will get you a fee waiver at the
gate. The cost of the lunch,
however, would probably get you a
lifetime pass on 17-Mile Drive. If 25
cents per mile is too much for your
budget, head down the road to
Asilomar (same exit off Highway 1),
where you can drive for free and
stop at a number of beautiful dune
beaches.
If you're still in a driving mood
but ready to do some walking, head
down Highway 1 four to five miles to
Point Lobos State Park, a wonder
ful oceanside area with miles of
hiking trails and over 300 species of
plants. Rangers and docents lead
regular tours of the tidepools and
will help you identify such creatures
as royal purple urchins (sounds like
a Dickens novel) and orange
crusted stars. Point Lobos also of
fers the nation's first underwater
trail for interested scuba divers.
More conventional hikers can ex
plore the Garland Ranch in Carmel
Valley or the many trails of Jack's
Peak in Monterey. The road to
Jack's Peak, which is the same road
to the Monterey airport, lies just off
of Highway 101 south of Monterey.
If you enjoy quiet walks and beauti
ful views, this is the place to go. In
fact, you can take a south-facing
trail and find a spot in the sun for a
good afternoon nap.
For those interested in seeing
the sights with other forms of
transportation, the Monterey area
has a number of great bicycle
routes. Follow the shoreline from

Lover's Point to Asilomar, Pacific
Grove, or tour 17-Mile Drive (see
above). Cyclists are admitted free
at the Pacific Grove gates after 8
a.m. and must finish before 11 p.m.
on weekends. Check yellow pages

for bicycle rentals. Call Monterey
Moped at 646-0505 for details on
moped rental. Rollerskaters can
rent equipment from Ramblin' Rol
lers of Monterey at 372-3175.
If touring is your thing, Mon

terey's the place. You can begin
with a tour of Peninsula wineries by
visiting Monterey Vineyards in
Gonzales, off of Highway 101.
Tours and tastings run from 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.

Students doing research for
American literature can take the
Steinbeck country tour, which
begins at the John Steinbeck Li
brary, 110 W. San Luis, Salinas. (10
a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through
Thursday and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
on Saturday and Sunday). Call
408/758-7311 for more information.
Geology aficionados can do a
little field research with their favor
ite lab partner(s) in the natural hot
mineral waters at Paraiso Hot
Springs, 48 miles southeast of
Monterey off Arroyo Seco Road.
(408/678-2882) or at the baths of
Esalen in Big Sur (408/667-2335).
Accommodations in Monterey
are plentiful and range from Motel 6
to quaint bed and breakfasts to such
luxury hotels as the Hyatt and
Sheraton. Deciding to review Motel
6 in next month's column, we opted
for the plush and luxurious accom
modations of the latter.
If you're looking for a unique,
romantic place to stay on the Mon
terey Peninsula, try the Centrella
Hotel in nearby Pacific Grove. The
Centrella was originally built in
1889 as a 17-room guest house. As
its popularity grew, the hotel was
expanded and renovated. Its most
recent renovation (at $1 million)
was completed in 1982 and resulted
in Centrella being listed in the Na
tional Register of Historical Places.
This small bed and breakfast inn now
holds top design awards for both its
guest rooms and lobby area.
The Centrella is a small, friendly
sort of hotel that goes that extra
step for the guest. If you call down
to the desk and request a bottle of
wine not normally stocked in the
inn's wine cellar, the night clerk will
drive into town just to find it for
you.

Rich in history as well as beautiful natural scenery, the Monterey Peninsula offers man-made
wonders for the tourist to view, such as this mission from California's early history.
