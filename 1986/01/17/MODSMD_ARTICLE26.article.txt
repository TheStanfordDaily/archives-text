## Monterey Peninsula Offers Scenic Luxury 
### JEFFREY MALTZMAN JOHN SAGE 
The Monterey Peninsula
Location: Two hours south of
Stanford on Highway 1
Area Code: 408
As far as quick, scenic and fun
getaways go, it is hard to beat the
Monterey Peninsula. Stanford stu
dents seeking a reprieve from pre
finals syndrome (PFS) need not
look further than the picturesque
coastside only two hours to the
south.
Monterey has changed visibly in
recent years. Increased conges
tion, traffic and the attendant
tourist shops and T-shirt stores
have combined to rob Monterey of
some of its charm. The addition of
David Packard's aquarium (no "fish
and chip" jokes, please), while a
valuable addition to the area, is in
large part responsible for the crush
of people that lines the streets of
Cannery Row.
Now, the good news. Monterey
and nearby neighbor, Carmel, are
still exquisitely beautiful towns with
plenty of charm. For those willing
to move beyond Cannery Row and
Ocean Avenue, a full complement
of scenic, affordable and romantic
diversions awaits to help you
overcome everything from
boredom to unbridled lust or even
the more negative effects of Wilbur
food service.
A tour of the famed 17-Mile
Drive is always a good way to begin
a weekend in Monterey/Carmel.
The road winds past golf courses,
houses that seem to say, "Be
thankful I let you drive by," and
beautiful white-sand beaches. The
drive has gotten to be a bit expen
sive, however, leading these
travel writers to ask every stu
dent's favorite question: "How can

I get it for free?" There are several
possible techniques.
Aside from off-roading past the
ranger station, tell the guard that
you've made lunch reservations at
the magnificent Pebble Beach
Lodge and are late for your meeting
with Lee lacocca. If you don't want
to lie, go ahead and make lunch or
dinner reservations at the lodge â€”
this will get you a fee waiver at the
gate. The cost of the lunch,
however, would probably get you a
lifetime pass on 17-Mile Drive. If 25
cents per mile is too much for your
budget, head down the road to
Asilomar (same exit off Highway 1),
where you can drive for free and
stop at a number of beautiful dune
beaches.
If you're still in a driving mood
but ready to do some walking, head
down Highway 1 four to five miles to
Point Lobos State Park, a wonder
ful oceanside area with miles of
hiking trails and over 300 species of
plants. Rangers and docents lead
regular tours of the tidepools and
will help you identify such creatures
as royal purple urchins (sounds like
a Dickens novel) and orange
crusted stars. Point Lobos also of
fers the nation's first underwater
trail for interested scuba divers.
More conventional hikers can ex
plore the Garland Ranch in Carmel
Valley or the many trails of Jack's
Peak in Monterey. The road to
Jack's Peak, which is the same road
to the Monterey airport, lies just off
of Highway 101 south of Monterey.
If you enjoy quiet walks and beauti
ful views, this is the place to go. In
fact, you can take a south-facing
trail and find a spot in the sun for a
good afternoon nap.
For those interested in seeing
the sights with other forms of
transportation, the Monterey area
has a number of great bicycle
routes. Follow the shoreline from

Lover's Point to Asilomar, Pacific
Grove, or tour 17-Mile Drive (see
above). Cyclists are admitted free
at the Pacific Grove gates after 8
a.m. and must finish before 11 p.m.
on weekends. Check yellow pages

for bicycle rentals. Call Monterey
Moped at 646-0505 for details on
moped rental. Rollerskaters can
rent equipment from Ramblin' Rol
lers of Monterey at 372-3175.
If touring is your thing, Mon

terey's the place. You can begin
with a tour of Peninsula wineries by
visiting Monterey Vineyards in
Gonzales, off of Highway 101.
Tours and tastings run from 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.

Students doing research for
American literature can take the
Steinbeck country tour, which
begins at the John Steinbeck Li
brary, 110 W. San Luis, Salinas. (10
a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through
Thursday and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
on Saturday and Sunday). Call
408/758-7311 for more information.
Geology aficionados can do a
little field research with their favor
ite lab partner(s) in the natural hot
mineral waters at Paraiso Hot
Springs, 48 miles southeast of
Monterey off Arroyo Seco Road.
(408/678-2882) or at the baths of
Esalen in Big Sur (408/667-2335).
Accommodations in Monterey
are plentiful and range from Motel 6
to quaint bed and breakfasts to such
luxury hotels as the Hyatt and
Sheraton. Deciding to review Motel
6 in next month's column, we opted
for the plush and luxurious accom
modations of the latter.
If you're looking for a unique,
romantic place to stay on the Mon
terey Peninsula, try the Centrella
Hotel in nearby Pacific Grove. The
Centrella was originally built in
1889 as a 17-room guest house. As
its popularity grew, the hotel was
expanded and renovated. Its most
recent renovation (at $1 million)
was completed in 1982 and resulted
in Centrella being listed in the Na
tional Register of Historical Places.
This small bed and breakfast inn now
holds top design awards for both its
guest rooms and lobby area.
The Centrella is a small, friendly
sort of hotel that goes that extra
step for the guest. If you call down
to the desk and request a bottle of
wine not normally stocked in the
inn's wine cellar, the night clerk will
drive into town just to find it for
you.

Rich in history as well as beautiful natural scenery, the Monterey Peninsula offers man-made
wonders for the tourist to view, such as this mission from California's early history.
wine, sherry and a light repast
around the fireplace. Breakfast is
complimentary, and everyone eats
together in the large living room a la
the Waltons.
The Centrella has 20 rooms, in
cluding two charming attic suites
and five nostalgic cottage rooms
complete with fireplaces. All rooms
are exquisitely designed and
decorated. Heavy hand-made quilts
cover the beds and the bathroom
fixtures are made of antique brass.
Rooms with shared baths are a
reasonable $40 per night. Cham
bers with a private bath range from
$55 to $68. Suites are $79, while
fireplace cottages range from $95
to $115. For reservations call
408/372-3372 or write to The
Centrella Hotel, P.O. Box 51157,
Pacific Grove, CA 93950.
Those seeking luxurious accom
modations with a touch of "real
home" should visit the Martine Inn
of Pacific Grove without delay. A
beautifully restored and decorated
estate across from the Hopkins
Marine Station, the Martine Inn is
the former home of a pharmaceuti
cal magnate (Parke, of
Parke/Davis).
Don and Marion Martine have

successfully created an environ
ment where guests can check their
problems at the door, enjoy the
finest personal treatment and ex
perience complete tranquility.
Sound good? It is.
With 19 rooms, each individually
designed and decorated, the
Martine Inn feels like a home (not
mine or yours, but someone's).
The rooms have neither names nor
numbers identifying them. Casual
references to different rooms, such
as "Pewter," "Art Deco" and
"Captain's Cabin" only reflect the
special nature of the antiques that
have been picked to furnish the
rooms. Every effort is made to
make guests feel as if they are
family members: Nothing is off
limits.
The Martine is filled with fully
restored and operative antiques.
Guests can play one of two pump
organs on the main floor, view the
ocean (right across the street) with
ancient brass binoculars and
shower in the marble tubs with brass
handles (one shower has six
shower heads running from floor to
ceiling). A full selection of old
games, toys and books in the parlor
provides guests with an infinite
number of rainy day diversions.
Beyond the accommodations and
service is delicious food. Marion
prepares a huge breakfast

(including everything from fresh or
ange juice to banana pancakes to
fritatta) every morning and hot hors
d'oeuvres in the evening. Guests
gather around the fireplace to
watch the sunset, sample the
sumptuous creations and enjoy
Don's favorite California wines.
Rooms at the Martine Inn cost
between $85 and $165 per night.
Rooms in the back of the house and
without fireplaces are the least ex
pensive, while larger suites with
fireplaces are at the higher end of
the price spectrum. Every floor has
a sitting room with a full bay win
dow overlooking the Pacific Ocean.
Reservations at the Martine
should be made several weeks in
advance by calling 408/373-3388 or
by writing the Martine Inn, 255
Ocean View Blvd., Pacific Grove,
CA 93950.
The Monterey Sheraton recently
marked its one-year anniversary.
The hotel is the tallest structure in
Monterey; not surprisingly, its con
struction aroused the ire of many
locals. Its central location makes it
very convenient for strolling: the
wharf is a 10-minute walk, Cannery
Row a 20-minute walk.
The hotel is done very tastefully,
with light-colored marble, glass
and warm carpeting inviting guests
for an elegant stay. Modem objets
d'art in "Miami Vice" tones hang

from the walls. The hotel features a
weight room and steam room, pool
and jacuzzi. While the outward ap
pearance of the hotel is striking, it
is the service that makes a stay at
the Sheraton truly memorable.
Upon arrival, guests are greeted
by fresh-faced, eager young valets
and porters. Their eagerness
seems to stem from a desire to be
helpful rather than a hunger for two
bits. Everyone, from the desk clerk
to the manager, was helpful and
courteous. Of course, when the
maid knocked on my door at 8 a.m.
to change my sheets, I was singing
a different tune.
Rooms are beautifully furnished
in real wood, brass and pastel
colors. Wood-paneled desks and a
table overlooking Monterey Bay
combine to make the room difficult
to leave. Real hangers and pieces of
art not nailed down also add a
civilized air to the room. (Of
course, as a Band member it was
very difficult to leave the brass
lamp and monogrammed robe.)
Amenities such as newspapers and
turn-down service are included.
Sheraton's toll-free reservation
number is 1-800-325-3535. Room

rates at the Monterey Sheraton fall
into three categories: deluxe
(upper floor with a view), at $155
per night for two people; superior
(mid floors with a good view) $135
per night for two people; and stan
dard (lower floors, no amenities) at
$120 per night for two people.
Golf enthusiasts will find the
Hyatt Regency Monterey (formerly
Hyatt Del Monte) the perfect place
to stay. This Mobile Four Star
Award hotel sits along the mag
nificent championship 18-hole Del
Monte golf course, and approxi
mately half of its rooms have views
of the golf course. The hotel also
sports a racquet club, heated swim
ming pool and spa.
The 579-room Hyatt was
recently renovated at a cost of over
$20 million. The recent improve
ments include 140 new rooms,
eight new suites and a new 23-room
"Regency Club" (a concierge floor
with VIP service).
The lobby area, which provides a
relaxing atmosphere for reading
and relaxing, also features two new
restaurants. The peninsula serves
California cuisine at its best while
the Cafe Monterey serves light

meals and snacks. High tea is
served in the lobby daily.
Rooms at the Hyatt are spacious
and comfortable, with plush seating
areas, cable television and your
own personal electronic safe.
Guests set their own combinations
and pay a slight charge for the
privilege of having Big Brother at
the front desk know when you are
using the device.
Prices start at $89 per night for
the "Aquarium Weekend Special"
and kids can stay free in the same
room. Be wary of rooms facing the
town, as they overlook the busy and
noisy Highway 1. For reservations,
call Hyatt's toll-free reservation
number 800/824-2196.
The Let's Go budget guide to
California notes accurately that
"cheap lodging in Monterey is
impossible to come by easily, but
obtainable with a bit of diligent
searching." The peninsula's only
youth hostel is open only in the
summer and can be reached at
408/373-4166. For a complete
listing of all hotels and motels in the
Carmel/Monterey area, call the
visitor's information bureau at
408/649-3200.

A view of the boats at the Monterey Marina suggests romantic cruises and high seas adventures.
Land lovers also can appreciate the marina's beauty, albeit from a safe distance.
