## Globetrotters Wow Maples 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
They've played in 101 countries on six con
tinents. They've played before 75,000 in Berlin
and in a private audience for the Pope. And
they've brought smiles to faces of millions, espe
cially to children, who seem to be particularly in
fatuated with their combination of basketball and
entertainment.
And when the Harlem Globetrotters returned
to Maples Pavilion last night for what has become
an annual event, the people, and the children,
were there. A sell-out crowd of 7,500 packed
Maples, and for the next 2Vi hours they got what
they came for â€” witty humor, clowning pranks,

and a little bit of good basketball on the side.
The Trotters also brought along Lynette
Woodard, the guard out of Kansas who is the
first woman to play with the Globetrotters in
their 60-year history.
Needless to say, she was the center of atten
tion. At another pregame press conference in
another gym in another city, Woodard told of her
"dream come true," playing for the same team
her cousin, Geese Ausbie, played with for 24
years.
Her reasons for joining the team were simple.
"I wanted to make money, I wanted to play bas
ketball, and I wanted to travel," she said. One
gets to do all three playing for the Globetrotters.
Woodard was the captain of the gold-medal

winning 1984 U.S. Olympic Team and played
with Cheryl Miller, the collegiate Player of the
Year, at Los Angeles. Miller is a senior at USC
this year, and Woodard said of next year,
"There's been talk of starting an all-female team,
but if not, it would be great to play with Cheryl
and share it with someone else."
Sweet Lou Dunbar and Twiggy Sanders are
the stars of the Globetrotters, handling most of
the comedy roles while the others serve as a
supporting cast for their antics. "Comedy is not
my part of the show," Woodard said. She defined
her role as simply "to play."
While Woodard and seven other Trotters

packed Maples for the show. The 6-foot-9 Dunbar has been a

played and defeated the Washington
Generals, 82-76, Dunbar stole the
show, with the classic routines and
a few that caught the crowd by
surprise. The Trotters didn't seem
at their best, dropping balls, mis
sing passes, blowing layups here
and there, but the comedy came

through as it always seems to do.
The two men you really have to
feel for, though, are Billy Campion
and Louis "Red" Klotz. Campion is
the Generals' assistant coach, and
plays center, taking the brunt of
Dunbar's antics. Klotz is their
owner-coach, who has been with
the Trotters' opposition for years.
He had his glory as a player, start
ing on the 1948 NBA champion Bal
timore Bullets.

Klotz retired after years of
playing on the winless team now
called the Generals only to have to
endure scores of losses each
season from the bench. Despite
this, he still cracked a smile at
times during Globetrotter routines
he must see in his sleep.
And when he was smiling, there
were 7,500 men, women and
children smiling with him.

Globetrotter Osborne Lockhart, a seven-year member of the club, takes it to the bucket in last
night's win over the Washington Generals, the team which has made a career of losing. The
newest Trotter, Lynette Woodard, was also in the lineup last night.
