## Globetrotters Wow Maples 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
They've played in 101 countries on six con
tinents. They've played before 75,000 in Berlin
and in a private audience for the Pope. And
they've brought smiles to faces of millions, espe
cially to children, who seem to be particularly in
fatuated with their combination of basketball and
entertainment.
And when the Harlem Globetrotters returned
to Maples Pavilion last night for what has become
an annual event, the people, and the children,
were there. A sell-out crowd of 7,500 packed
Maples, and for the next 2Vi hours they got what
they came for â€” witty humor, clowning pranks,

and a little bit of good basketball on the side.
The Trotters also brought along Lynette
Woodard, the guard out of Kansas who is the
first woman to play with the Globetrotters in
their 60-year history.
Needless to say, she was the center of atten
tion. At another pregame press conference in
another gym in another city, Woodard told of her
"dream come true," playing for the same team
her cousin, Geese Ausbie, played with for 24
years.
Her reasons for joining the team were simple.
"I wanted to make money, I wanted to play bas
ketball, and I wanted to travel," she said. One
gets to do all three playing for the Globetrotters.
Woodard was the captain of the gold-medal

winning 1984 U.S. Olympic Team and played
with Cheryl Miller, the collegiate Player of the
Year, at Los Angeles. Miller is a senior at USC
this year, and Woodard said of next year,
"There's been talk of starting an all-female team,
but if not, it would be great to play with Cheryl
and share it with someone else."
Sweet Lou Dunbar and Twiggy Sanders are
the stars of the Globetrotters, handling most of
the comedy roles while the others serve as a
supporting cast for their antics. "Comedy is not
my part of the show," Woodard said. She defined
her role as simply "to play."
While Woodard and seven other Trotters


The Reigning Clown Prince of Basketball, "Sweet Lou" Dunbar,
hams it up with a purse before some of the 7,500 fans that

Globetrotter for eight years.
