# It's a Big Game On the Court

Big Game.
Say those two words during football season and many things come
to mind — Gaieties, the bonfire, the rally in San Francisco and a
sold-out stadium to watch Stanford and California battle it out in the
premier annual sporting event in Northern California.
Say them during basketball season and all you'll get are a couple of
teams on the edge of .500 trying to sustain the dream of making a
run at the Pacific 10 Conference championship.
There are no plays, no rallies, no hatred-inspiring speeches this
weekend. In fact, with a three-day weekend, there may not be a
whole lot of students in the stands for tomorrow afternoon's annual
Maples Pavilion showdown.
"It's not as big as football, obviously, with the student body, but
it's big for us," Stanford forward Earl Koberlein said. "All conference
games are, but this one might be a little more important."
Stanford has had a bad time of it lately against the Bears — Cal has
won seven of the last eight meetings, including both last year. The
Cardinal did come close in Maples, but lost 43-41 in double overtime.
Stanford's last win came in 1984 in Berkeley, 62-51.
"Even though it's not as big as in football, we still don't like them,"
Koberlein said. "There's still pride involved, and we haven't beaten
them in a while. Once in four years — that's a streak we'd like to
break."
The Bears visit the Farm with a 2-2 record in the conference, 10-4
overall. They opened quickly with victories over Washington, the
preseason pick to win the Pac-10, and Washington State in Berkeley.

banged-up Cardinals who will play against Cal tomorrow.
