# Chico Offers Fresh Test
## Kenney will take only freshmen for meet 
### AMY FRANCETIC Staff writer 
Without the upperclassmen
there to put out a possible fire,
the freshman swimmers on the
Stanford men's swim team will
have to toughen up and swim
some pretty competitive races
when they travel to Chico State
tomorrow.
Stanford Coach Skip Kenney
explained that he's racing the
same all-freshman team against
Chico that raced that mutilated
UC-Davis last weekend.

"These dual meets are a su
perb opportunity for the fresh
men to get in some choice racing
practice. Chico will be good com
petition to prepare the frosh for
racing our conference teams,"
Kenney said.
The first conference dual meet
for the Cardinal is Jan. 31 at home
against Arizona State. But before
then, the freshmen will collide
with the Division II NCAA Cham
pions, Chico State. The Stanford
squad will "need to turn in some
pretty good times" to beat Chico,

Kenney said.
In evaluating the whole team,
Kenney said the Cardinal is ahead
of where it was last year in train
ing, but he feels the team
chemistry is taking a bit longer to
synthesize. "We've got a lot of
freshmen out this year, and
they're taking longer to gel as a
team," he said.
The Stanford divers, who make
up what is arguably one of the
best teams on the West Coast,
will travel with the freshman swim-

mers to Chico tomorrow, where
they are expected to fare well.
"The guys dove great last
weekend, and we don't expect a
problem at Chico," diving Coach
Rick Shavone said. The divers com

peted in the Texas Ail-American
meet a week ago against some stiff
competition, and seniors Thor
Johnson and Tom Rothenbucher
finished in the top five out of more
than 60 divers.
