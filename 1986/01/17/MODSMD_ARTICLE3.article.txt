# Kennedy Denies Perkins' Claim
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
The University has decided not to pay
senior Robby Perkins' claim calling for
$600,100 in damages resulting from alleged
brutality by Stanford police at an October
anti-apartheid rally, according to Assoc. Staff
Counsel Thomas Fenner.
The next step, according to Perkins, will
be approaching the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) next week about his case and
those of two other Stanford students with
similar claims. He said he is "fairly confident"
that the ACLU will officially accept the cases.
University President Donald Kennedy
mailed a denial of the claim, authored by Fen
ner, and a cover letter to Perkins yesterday,
Fenner said. Fenner would not disclose
details about the contents of the cover letter.
Kennedy would not comment on the cor
respondence between the University and
Perkins.
Perkins, who alleges he was beaten by
police after being arrested at an Oct. 11 sit-in
at Old Union, filed the claim against the Uni
versity, the Stanford Police Department, the
County of Santa Clara and the Santa Clara
County Sheriff s Department.
Perkins said he has already received a
denial from Santa Clara County.
Perkins said he was not surprised when
The Daily informed him of the University's
decision. "It was somewhat unrealistic (to ex
pect) that they would pay," he said.
Perkins charged in his claim that the use of
a compliance-pain hold by officers
"constituted excessive, unreasonable, un
necessary and unlawful force by the Stanford
campus police." In addition, Perkins claims
that he was "placed in isolation, strip
searched and beaten" after he was trans
ferred to North County Jail.
Two other students, Kaylen Worth and
David Potter, have also filed claims, each call
ing for $100,000 in damages. Worth's and
Potter's claims refer only to the use of
compliance-pain holds used at the arrest, and
not allegations of abuse at the jail, Potter
said.
Neither of the two has received word on

the status of his claim.
Peter Heslin, another student protester
arrested at Old Union, is also considering
filing a claim.
ACLU lawyer Ed Chen, who helped the
students prepare their claims, estimated that
it could be one to two months before the
ACLU decides whether to take on the cases.
The ACLU office in San Francisco, staffed
with only three lawyers, has limited re
sources to deal with cases like these, Chen
said.
The process by which the ACLU decides
to take on a case involves three steps, he
said. First, it is reviewed by a legal staff.
Next, a legal committee hears it, and then the
board of directors makes the final decision.
Chen said there are several important
aspects of the protesters' claims, citing the
students' charges of police brutality and the
possibility of racial discrimination in the case
of Perkins, who was the only black arrested
during that sit-in. Chen stressed the fact that
the students were involved in a "First
Amendment action."
"There is an ominous trend across the
country of universities quelling dissent," he
explained.
If the ACLU does not take the case, then
the three protesters would have to hire their
own lawyers. Perkins has already said he will
continue to pursue his case.
Worth was less certain about his future
plans. "If the ACLU doesn't take it, it's a
pretty good indication that I might not win,"
he said, adding that he might not take it any
further.
The ASSU has also expressed interest in
helping finance the protesters' legal action.
Senate Chair Carey White has said that the
senate will look at cases individually if the
protesters express a financial need.
All four of the students have said their goal
behind legal action is not money. "The pri
mary purpose is to keep this from happening
again," Perkins said.
Perkins said he will drop the suit if five of
the police officers involved resign: Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington, Stanford
Police Sgt. Nick Brunot, Santa Clara Ser-
