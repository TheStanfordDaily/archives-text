# Johnson, Wester Square Off
## 
### MARY K. McDEVITT Staff writer 
San Jose State senior Angie Wester wants to take
advantage of Jenna Johnson.
Wester doesn't get many chances to swim against
history's fastest high school 100-yard butterflyer, and
at the Cardinal-Spartan dual meet tomorrow morning,
Wester hopes to race herself to a qualifying time for the
March NCAA championships.
Wester, the Spartans' lone national-caliber swimmer,
placed a close second to Johnson at the Cal Invitational
last week.

Swimming in a special heat, Wester and Johnson will
race alone, allowing for a calm, fast pool, and Wester
will likely swim in the lane next to Johnson and draft
Johnson's waves.
"It should be a good race," Stanford Asst. Coach
Steve Wishart said.
Johnson feels confident about the matchup. "If she
does her best time this year, it will be close," Johnson
said. "But I'm not worried about it."
Despite the fact that the Cardinal could afford to
juggle its lineup against the relatively weak Spartans,
Wishart said the team will field its
top swimmers in each event. Stan
ford will use the meet to fine-tune
race strategies and build speed in
preparation for tough competition
against USC and UCLA later this
month, Wishart said.
Tomorrow's meet in San Jose is
the first dual meet for the Cardinal.
The normal diving competition will
not take place because the Spartans
do not have any divers.
