# Modory replaces Lauchner
## Spikers Host Chico 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
Despite losing Ail-American set
ter Craig Lauchner to graduation,
the Stanford men's volleyball team
that opens its regular season to
morrow night against Chico State
figures to be "better than last
year's team," according to junior
Steve Modory, who has assumed
Lauchner's setting position.
"All around, this team is going to
be better," Modory said. "We're
further along this year than last
year."
Tomorrow's match with Chico
follows the Stanford-UC Berkeley
basketball game at Maples Pavilion
and is scheduled to start at 6 p.m.
Chico plays at the club sports
level in volleyball but has several
players from the Southern Califor
nia area, the acknowledged hotbed
of volleyball. And, according to
Modory, the Cardinal needs to ap
proach the match seriously.
"A good start for us is crucial,"
he said. "We need to see how we
can play and perform."
Last season, the Cardinal per
formed very well — in fact, well
enough to be ranked consistently
among the top six teams in the na

tion and qualify for the Western
Regionals after compiling a 23-10
overall record.
But with the graduation of Lauch
ner — the central figure in the
Stanford attack — Cardinal Co
coaches Don Shaw and Fred Sturm
have had to turn to Modory, who,
despite impressive high school
credentials, has relatively little ex
perience at Stanford.
Modory, though, sees little rea
son for concern.

"We're passing a lot better than
we ever have, and Jon Root, Scott
Fortune and Chris Braun are all hit
ting better this year (though) they
were great last year," Modory said.
"And the blocking has been
good," he added, noting that Braun
and Fortune were both 6-foot-6
honorable-mention Ail-Americans
last season, while Root, a second
team All-American in 1985, stands
6-5. "With people that big there is a
lot you can do."
As for his own role, Modory said,
"I'm not Craig Lauchner, and I'm
never going to be. I feel confident
that I can do the job that I'm

supposed to. There is a lot of pres
sure, but both coaches are helping
me out a lot, and the players realize
that I'm not Craig."
Modory explained that because
he is just 5-11, he will be the target
of many opposing offenses. "I'm
going to have to realize that teams
will be setting at me. My ability to
block is nowhere near Lauchner's
yet so I'll have to work channeling
the ball."
Lack of size may prohibit him
from being a prolific blocker, yet
Modory believes that in other areas
his size is beneficial. "I think I can
contribute defensively in the back
row," he said.
