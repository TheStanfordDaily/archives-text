# VanDerveer Weathers a Wild Year
## The
						women's basketball team prepares for St. Mary's

Tara VanDerveer enjoys sailing.
When her duties as basketball
coach allow it, she indulges in this
form of maritime relaxation.
Most of the time, however, she
is submerged in the depths of Card
inal basketball, a world that's quite
different from the calm, cool
breezes and steady serenity of an
ocean voyage.
The 1985-86 edition of Stanford
women's basketball has been any
thing but smooth sailing. In fact, as
VanDerveer has discovered, it's
been more akin to some wild
amusement park ride.
"I feel like I'm on an emotional
roller coaster, " she said.
Fortunately for the 10-5 Card
inal, the erratic ride has had more
ups than downs. But VanDerveer
still hopes for steadier perfor
mances from her players.
"Our team is inconsistent, I will
admit," she said. "We seem to play
harder against better competition,
but we tend not to play hard against
lesser competition."
This inconsistency has tempered
VanDerveer's optimism for a 20-
win season and a possible NCAA
tournament bid.
"I prefer to take one game at a
time," she said. "The really tough
part of the season is coming up.
We'll be playing USC twice as well
as Berkeley." Tonight at Maples
Pavilion, Stanford will be looking to
take its 11th game of the season at
the expense of the St. Mary's
Gaels.
The Cardinal hopes to keep
coasting after a strong 77-65 win
Monday night over the University
of Utah.
The 8-4 Gaels will attempt to tar
nish Stanford's perfect 5-0 record
at home.
St. Mary's has lost its last two
games, to San Jose State and USF,
by scores of 70-67 and 73-67,
respectively.
Averaging 71 points per game,
the Gaels are offensively explosive.
They are led by Connie Frank, who
averages 13 points a game. Five
foot-10 guard Molly Robertson is
St. Mary's next leading scoring at
12 points an outing.

hresnman Evon Asforis is one reason why Stanford's inside game has improved this year. Her
8.3 rebounds per game leads the Cardinal. She and the rest of the Stanford squad will take on St
Mary's tonight in Maples at 7:30.
