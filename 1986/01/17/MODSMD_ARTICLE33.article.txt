# Big Ten Trip Is Big Fencing Challenge
## 
### LISA MARTINEZ Staff writer 
With a gust of rising expecta
tions, the Cardinal fencers
prepare to travel to Chicago to
meet the best the Big Ten Con
ference has to offer this
weekend. The University of Illi
nois, Wisconsin, Minnesota and
Northwestern will be the major
foes trying to foil Stanford's
chances, but the University of
Chicago and Lawrence Univer
sity should also be a challenge.
The Stanford fencers are re
turning to the Midwest for their
second tilt with the Big Ten
powers. Last year on the trip
East, the Cardinal men beat
Northwestern, Ohio State, Illi
nois, Wisconsin, Minnesota and
Chicago, while the women
topped all the above with the ex
ception of Illinois, a team they
never met.
"Since they (the Cardinal fen
cers) did this last year, they
have a pretty good idea of what
to expect," Stanford Coach Buzz
Hurst said. "They're going back
there looking for some people to
beat."
Competition looks tough for
the Cardinal. The men will face
three nationally ranked teams â€”
Illinois (Bth), Northwestern
(10th) and Wisconsin (11th).
"Illinois and Wisconsin tradition
ally have strong teams in epee

and foil, so we'll be seriously
challenged by them in these
events," Hurst said.
As usual, however, the out
look seems good for the Stanford
men. "Sabre is the strongest
team in relation to the other
schools this weekend," Hurst
said. "But, once again, the ab
sence of our No. 2 foilist, Chris
Gillen, is causing foil to be a bit
of a question mark. We'll just
have to see how well we do."
Gillen, a sophomore, returned
from winter break and did not
fence for the team in its first
meet after the break, a contest
against UC-Santa Cruz here on
Saturday.
Apparently, Gillen has decided
not to fence at this time due to
academic reasons. Hurst,
however, would not confirm
this, saying that Gillen may still
return to the team. Gillen could
not be reached for comment.
The women also face some
stiff competition as they meet
the nationally ranked women's
teams of Wisconsin (11th) and
Northwestern (13th).
According to Hurst, this meet
will be a deciding factor for the
Cardinal team. "This is what will
confirm, raise or lower our na
tional standings," Hurst said.
The Stanford fencers enter
the true start of their season
with this meet. "This will be one
of two challenging road trips in a
row," Hurst said.
