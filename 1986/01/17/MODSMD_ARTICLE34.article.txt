The Cardinal wrestling team goes to the Southern
California Duals in Fullerton this Sunday, and with
the team preparing for the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, Stanford expects the tournament to
be more of a learning experience than anything else.
Also competing will be the host, Cal State-
Fullerton, as well as Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo,
Fresno State, Utah State, the University of New
Mexico, Southern Illinois and Arizona State, Stan
ford's first-round opponent.
Southern Illinois is the team to beat, according to
Stanford Coach Chris Horpel. The defending Divi
sion II champion, Southern Illinois last year had
several wrestlers earn Ail-American honors at the
Division I level as well.
In the tournament, Horpel is looking more for in
dividual improvement than a fine team performance.
ASU is the defending Pac-10 champion $nd is a Top
Ten caliber team. Given the level of competition at
the Duals, it is entirely possible Stanford could finish

eighth in the eight-team field.
The Cardinal will be able to field a full roster for
the tournament if Horpel feels the team has a
chance to win; otherwise the team will forfeit at
heavyweight. Mason Gomez rejoins the team at 118
pounds, and Mark Alex (142 pounds) will make his
first varsity start.
Pete Rogers is questionable at 158 pounds due to
sprained knee ligaments. If he is unable to compete,
Horpel will take a reserve.
"Whenever one goes to a high-level competition,
a wrestler gets the impression that the better
wrestlers have some magical technique that lets
them win," Horpel said. "The better guys usually do
not know any more than he, but they have such a
great mental attitude which gives them the edge."
Horpel feels Lee and Bradley can enter this upper
plateau. The only thing holding them back is the
mental ability to put together all they know and
maintain a high level of consistency, he said.
"Although Bradley has been winning, the matches
have been closer than they should have been. This
tournament should be good for Bradley, as it can get
v.;â„¢ " Horpel added.
