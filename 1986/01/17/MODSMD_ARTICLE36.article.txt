# Gymnastics Season Gets Underway
## Women Seek Experience 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
The Stanford women's gymnas
tics team will open its season to
morrow at UC-Davis in what will
mainly be an experience meet for
the Cardinal's freshmen. The
squad, at full strength, will begin
its season next week when it visits
USC for its first PacWest competi
tion.
To get an idea of the strength of
the Cardinal this year, one need
only know that despite entering
only six gymnasts in Saturday's
meet, five of them freshmen,
Stanford Coach Homer Sarpino is
expecting his team to perform as
well as if not better than a UC-
Davis squad that has been a Divi
sion II powerhouse for many
years.
While the competition will cer
tainly be welcome, the team is not
necessarily going after a victory.
'We're not looking for a win, we're
not looking for a loss," Sarpino
said.
What the team is looking for is
to "hit" its routines, according to
Sarpino. He has instructed his
squad not to worry about the diffi
culty of their moves, and should,
instead, concentrate on perform
ing the moves they feel most com
fortable with.
Stanford finished the 1984-85
campaign as the No. 13 team in
the nation and could very well end
up even higher in the rankings this
season. Sarpino will not say,

ter last year's record of 20-9.
"Our schedule is so tough," he
said.
"Tough" means facing many of
the best collegiate teams in dual

meet competition. It does not
mean Stanford will be losing those
meets. "We're going to be com
petitive with everybody. If they
slip up, we can pass them," Sar
pino said.
