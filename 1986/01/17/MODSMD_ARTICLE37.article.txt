# Men Aim At NCAAs Again
## 
### TRACY POTTER 
The Stanford men's gymnastics
team last competed in December
at the San Jose State's Spartan
Open, winning the meet with a
266.5 cumulative score and vic
tories over the Spartans, UC-
Berkeley, UC-Davis and UC-
Santa Barbara. Tonight it re
turns to San Jose, this time to
face the Spartans alone.
Although the Spartan Open was
the Cardinal's season opener,
Stanford Coach Sadao Hamada
considers the meet as "more of a
preparation. Our toughest compe
tition will be against lowa, Ne
braska, UCLA and Arizona State.
The San Jose meet on Friday will
help us prepare for the UCLA
meet next week," he said.
With three victories against San
Jose last season, the Cardinal
must be considered the favorite
tonight.
The 1984-85 season was a
remarkable one for the Cardinal
gymnasts; in fact, it was the best
in Stanford's history. For the first
time in nearly 50 years, the team
competed at the NCAAs, finishing
seventh. That performance was
even more impressive considering
the size of last year's team. Stan
ford competed with only six
gymnasts, and it was the smallest
team at the NCAAs. Most teams
competed with the roster limit of
nine players.
All six starters from last year
return to the line-up this season,
including Jon Louis and Randy Be
sosa, both members of the 1985

U.S. National Team, and Mike
Matzek, winner of the 1985 U.S.
Gymnastics Federation Champi
onship in the Tri-Elite level. Two
talented freshmen also joined the
team this year, Andy Ropp and
Scott Schaffer.
"This year, I feel that everyone
has improved, and with the fresh
men, our team should have more
depth than last year," Hamada
said. "If everything goes right, we
could be contenders for the NCAA
Championship."
The gymnasts to watch in
tonight's meet include San Jose
State junior Steve Nalian and
sophomore Youval Moyal, both
members of San Jose's top 10 all
around list. Cardinal gymnasts
competing in the all-around com
petition include junior Mark Ar
nold, sophomore Chuck Gerardo
and Ropp.
"A score of 270 or more at this
meet will be a good indication for
us," Hamada said. "The gymnasts
get in better shape as the season
progresses. If we score a 270
against San Jose, that means that
by the end of the season we'll be
scoring a 280 plus."
