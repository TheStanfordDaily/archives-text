# Police Arrest Suspected Con Artist
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Stanford police say they have foiled the opera
tion of a campus con man accused of obtaining
money on false pretenses from five unwary vic
tims.
Acting on a tip from a caller Wednesday night,
police caught up with Junius Duran Mouton
around 7:15 p.m. as he was leaving the McFar
land Building in Escondido Village. Mouton, who
has also used the name Melton, was reportedly
preparing to steal money from another victim at
the time of his arrest, according to Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Niemeyer said Mouton has been positively
identified by all five known victims of his alleged
ruse, and also by the caller who tipped off police
on Wednesday.
Mouton, currently being held in North County

Jail in lieu of $8,500 bail, is scheduled to appear
in court Tuesday, according to Sgt. Howard
Desart, a spokesman at the jail. A file on Mouton
at the jail cites the charges against him as bur
glary, forgery and resisting arrest.
The bail also includes $3,000 for a warrant
issued by the Palo Alto Municipal Court on an
unrelated felony charge, according to Desart.
That charge, petty theft, is a felony because
Mouton has a prior felony conviction.
Niemeyer described Mouton as "very un
cooperative" when arrested and said he denied
any wrongdoing, asserting that he had asked
only for loans that he planned to repay.
Mouton is said to have told his victims an elab
orate story in which he said he needed money to
get his car serviced so that he could salvage
slabs of meat that were quickly spoiling, accord
ing to Niemeyer.
He asked to borrow money with a promise of

immediate restitution and also offered his victims
some meat, but he never made any reimburse
ments, Niemeyer said.
Niemeyer added that Mouton gave one victim
an 1.0. U. and, in another incident, used a stolen
check as collateral.
"The guy is a smooth operator," Niemeyer
said. "People here are good human beings . . .
trusting people, and he capitalized on that."
On Tuesday, Stanford Police Sgt. Philip Love
released information on the reported crimes, in
cluding a prediction that there were two men
operating together and that police would identify
at least one within a week.
Niemeyer said yesterday that police now
believe they have caught the "up-front guy," and
noted that Mouton denied having an accomplice.
Niemeyer said that Stanford police are no
longer searching for anyone in connection with
these reported crimes.
