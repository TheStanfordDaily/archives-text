## The 						Tough Talk Continues in the Camps 
### 
FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) — The New
England Patriots, who fooled the experts
by reaching the Super Bowl, still haven't
convinced them. For its fourth consecutive
playoff game, the American Football Con
ference's surprise champion is an under
dog.
But a team that has weathered adversity
all season, rebounding from a 2-3 start and
key injuries, remains unfazed by the latest
slap at its ability.
"We've been winning as underdogs, so
why change it?" said wide receiver Stanley
Morgan.
The Chicago Bears are 10-point favorites
in the Jan. 26 battle for the National Foot
ball League title. Their 15-1 regular-season
record and two playoff shutouts contribute
to that judgment.

Some Patriots wonder whether all that
winning and the praise it has brought may
work against Chicago.
"The emphasis will probably be on
them," said New England linebacker Larry
McGrew. "That's to our advantage. People
will talk about Chicago. You listen to people
talking about how good you are all season
and pretty soon you're going to believe it."
"I think the Chicago Bears are overlook
ing us and not giving us a whole lot of
respect, just from things in the press," said
substitute center Guy Morriss. " 'Hey,
we're the Chicago Bears. We can't be beat.'
We'd like to show them."
The Bears were beaten once. The Dol
phins ruined their perfect record Dec. 2
with a 38-24 victory in Miami. Chicago has

given up 33 points in its five games since
then.
That loss was the only game since Nov. 3
in which the Bears trailed at any point, al-

though they did come from behind in six of
their first nine victories.
"I don't know if Chicago knows how to
play catchup ball," McGrew said.
The Bears, with the NFL's top-ranked

defense, haven't had to worry about that in
the playoffs with shutouts over the New
York Giants and Los Angeles Rams. But
the Patriots think their seventh-ranked
defense is pretty strong also.
"I feel like we can give them the exact
same problems that they can give to us,"
said free safety Fred Marion, who has three
interceptions in three playoff games. "We
faced offenses during the course of the
season that pose more of a threat than the
Chicago Bears give us.
"I'm not saying they're not a fine football
team," he added. "On the other hand,
they're a basic running offense, running,
running, and throwing when they have to."
It wasn't offense, however, that got the
Bears into this title game. It was defense.
And though Chicago refused yesterday to

predict an unprecedented Super Bowl
shutout of the Patriots, they did concede
that they were thinking about the possibil
ity.
"It's always in our mind," tackle William
"The Refrigerator" Perry said before the
Bears began practicing under the inflatable
bubble covering the University of Illinois
football field in Champaign, 111.
"We want it just as badly as we wanted
the other two," Perry said. "Buddy Ryan
(the defensive coordinator) would be most
grateful for a shutout."
"We think that way going into every
game," defensive end Richard Dent said of
a possible shutout. "If we can keep them
down and if we can score some points, we
feel we can shut them out."
