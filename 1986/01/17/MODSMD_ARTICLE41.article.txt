Marcos' Health Said To Worsen
WASHINGTON — The health of Philippine President Ferdinand
Marcos has taken a turn for the worse and so weakened him that he
has had to be propped up by bodyguards during recent campaign
rallies and has cut back road appearances for next month's presiden
tial elections, well-informed sources in Washington said yesterday.
Marcos, 68, suffers from an often incurable, recurring illness
known as systemic lupus erythematosus, according to intelligence
and congressional sources. The disease causes inflammation of many
body systems and can have serious impact on the kidneys.
Marcos has survived three debilitating bouts, recovering each
time to resume his activities. According to sources, he may be suf
fering another bout that began shortly after the new year. His poor
health has raised particular concern among Marcos' senior aides as
the presidential campaign enters the critical last three weeks before
the Feb. 7 election, the sources said.
Spokesman Roy Naval dismissed speculation that Marcos could
have been receiving medication while off the stage, saying, "He
could have just been having an orange drink."
If Marcos' health should deteriorate to the extent that he is no
longer able to function, or if he dies before the election, under the
Philippine constitution, succession would pass to the speaker of the
National Assembly, Nicanor Yniguez. Yniguez is believed by some
analysts to be loyal to Imdelda Marcos, who acts as roving ambassa
dor for her husband and who has been seen for years as his possible
successor.
It would then be up to Yniguez to decide whether to proceed with
the election or to put it off to allow the ruling party to nominate an
other candidate.
Civil War Continues in S. Yemen
MANAMA, Bahrain — Western countries were reported yester
day to be considering measures for the evacuation of their nationals
from Aden as rival Marxist forces continued fierce battles in and
around the South Yemen capital.
The contingency evacuation moves, confirmed by sources in
Paris, reflected growing fears that the four-day-old battles were
turning into a full-scale civil war, despite mediation efforts under way
at the Soviet Embassy in Aden.
Sources said if an evacuation decision was reached and arrange
ments for safe passage made, French warships currently at Djibouti
would sail to Aden to evacuate several hundred Westerners cur
rently trapped there.
The situation in Aden was said to be deteriorating rapidly. There
were reports of power failures and shortages of food and water.
Some areas were said to be flooded by oil from damaged pipelines
linked to the Aden refinery.
South Yemen's borders remained closed yesterday and there was
no contact with the outside world. Ships sailing near Aden radioed
reports of a billowing cloud of smoke over the city.
Dissidents Detained in Poland
WARSAW, Poland — An international peace conference backed by
Poland's communist authorities opened here yesterday as authorities
detained three opposition figures and broke up a press conference in
an effort to silence criticism of an event that has divided intellectuals
in Poland and abroad.
As about 350 delegates from 47 nations gathered for the nominally
private Congress of Intellectuals for a Peaceful Future of the World,
police detained dissident Jacek Kuron and former Solidarity trade
union spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz in their homes, their families
said.
The two activists had planned to meet journalists and conference
delegates to report on Polish political prisoners and the recent dis
missal of 70 rectors and deans from universities. Family members
said police had shown them summonses formally ordering the men to
appear for questioning as witnesses in criminal investigations.
Later, police interrupted a press conference in Kuron's home at
tended by several other opposition intellectuals, a group of Western
reporters and two Austrian delegates to the peace conference. Bar
bara Malak, a psychologist at Warsaw University who spoke at the
meeting, was detained.
Fighting Persists Near Beirut
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Syrian-backed forces fought fierce artillery
battles yesterday with supporters of Lebanese President Amin
Gemayel north and east of Beirut only hours after defeated
Lebanese Forces Cmdr. Elie Hobeika left Beirut for exile in Paris.
The fighting left an estimated 200 dead and 600 wounded.
The move came after Gemayel's Phalangist fighters, backed by
militiamen loyal to Lebanese forces Chief of Staff Samir Geagea,
overthrew Hobeika and took over most of Christian East Beirut.
Hobeika's departure jeopardizes the Dec. 28 Syrian-supervised
peace treaty between the leaders of Lebanon's Christian and Moslem
militias. Gemayel refused to endorse the treaty that Hobeika signed
on behalf of the Christian community. Gemayel and Geagea opposed
the Dec. 28 pact on the grounds that it gave up essential Christian
privileges to their Moslem rivals.
Syrian-backed forces retaliated with a massive artillery barrage
against villages in the mountains east of here.
Khadafy Calls Reagan 'Criminal'
TRIPOLI, Libya — Moammar Khadafy said Wednesday an inter
national court should try President Reagan as a war criminal for his
"policy of aggression" toward Libya and other Arab nations.
Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Khadafy's government
last week, accusing it of harboring the terrorist group the United
States blames for the Dec. 27 airport massacres at Rome and
Vienna, in which five Americans and 14 other people were killed.
"There is no difference between Nazi imperialism and the im
perialism led by Ronald Reagan," the radical Libyan leader told a
cheering meeting of one of the 1,400 local political groups he calls
Basic People's Congresses.
"Reagan is Hitler No. 2," Khadafy declared. "There is no reason
why the world should continue to regard Hitler as a war criminal and
seek out fugitive Nazis, while leaving Reagan unpunished. Reagan,
too, should be tried as a war criminal."
It was the second night in a row that Khadafy delivered a violent
anti-American speech broadcast live on state radio and television.
He called Tuesday for a "general mobilization of the Libyan
people" and threatened Libyan economic sanctions against the
United States.
