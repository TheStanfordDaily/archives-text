# Arms talks resume in Geneva
## Reagan Reacts Cautiously to Soviet Offer 
### 
WASHINGTON and GENEVA — President
Reagan said yesterday that the Kremlin's
sweeping plan for nuclear disarmament by the
end of the century is encouraging and "different
from things that we've heard in the past," and he
promised to analyze it carefully.
However, the Administration firmly rejected
Moscow's fresh demand for a scrapping of "Star
Wars" missile-defense research and a proposed
moratorium on nuclear testing.
Meanwhile, in Geneva, the U.S.-Soviet arms
negotiations resumed yesterday after a 10-week
break. Viktor Karpov, the chief Soviet
negotiator, said that the first order of business
for the new round of arms talks will be to deal
with the new Kremlin proposal.
In unveiling the new offer Wednesday, Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev insisted that the dis
armament process could proceed only if the
United States and the Soviet Union "renounce
the development, testing and deployment" of so
called space-strike weapons, the Kremlin's term
for "Star Wars." The Administration calls the
plan the Strategic Defense Initiative, or SDI.

After reviewing the Soviet plan overnight, the
Administration mixed cautious praise of some
elements with criticism of other aspects.
Reagan reserved judgment on whether it
signaled that the Soviets are serious about
negotiating an arms agreement.
"We're going to find out," he said, answering
reporters' questions briefly during a picture
taking session in the Cabinet Room.
"We're grateful for the offer," the president
said. Asked whether it could lead toward dis
armament, he said, "We're studying it with great
care and it is going to depend on wfiat takes
place in Geneva" at arms control talks.
Questioned whether he was encouraged by
the offer, Reagan said, "Yes. It is different from
things that we've heard in the past from leaders
in the Soviet Union. It's just about the first time
that anyone's ever proposed actually eliminating
nuclear weapons."
The Administration reaction came as Ameri
can and Soviet negotiators in Geneva opened the
fourth round of arms talks in 10 months and the
first since Reagan and Gorbachev met in Novem
ber.

"We certainly disagree with them on SDI,"
said presidential spokesman Larry Speakes.
Both sides should pursue research on missile
defense systems to permit a transition from of
fensive to defensive weapons, he said.
As for the test ban, Speakes said the Soviets
do not need to test because they already have an
advantage.
The spokesman described two elements of
the Soviet plan as concrete steps: a proposed 50
percent reduction in nuclear missiles, bombers
and submarines, and the elimination of the more
than 500 intermediate-range nuclear missiles
deployed in Europe by the superpowers.
"We have had these same type of proposals on
the table since 1981, again in 1983," Speakes
said. "And the Soviets now have responded to
them and they have set a timetable for this."
He resisted invitations to describe the Soviet
plan as a propaganda effort or grandstanding on
the eve of the opening of arms talks.
However, a senior Administration official,
speaking on condition he not be identified, was
skeptical about Gorbachev's intentions.
