# Big Drop in Oil Prices Expected by Spring
## 
### 
Spurred by a growing glut of oil
worldwide, speculators yesterday
drove down the prices they will pay
for future delivery of crude and
heating oil to a seven-year low. The
action on New York futures
markets will likely mean a sizable
drop in consumer prices this spring
for products such as gasoline.
Traders on the New York Mer
cantile Exchange were responding
to reports that Saudi Arabian oil
production had reached 6 million
barrels per day, considerably
higher than expected and much
greater than they had been pump
ing under production quotas estab

lished by the Organization of Petro
leum Exporting Countries. The
Saudis have been expected to boost
output for some time, after months
of threatening to do so because of
quota violations by other OPEC
members.
OPEC's output has been increas
ing since the cartel decided last
month to maintain its share of the
declining world oil market, even if it
meant boosting production to com
pete with cheaper sources such as
Britain's North Sea. Because the
Saudis are OPEC's biggest
producer, their decision to increase

output is viewed as particularly sig
nificant for world oil prices.
Although analysts said mild
weather — which reduced demand
for heating oil — has also contrib
uted, energy economists said
OPEC's production is the biggest
factor in a worldwide oversupply of
oil that has sent oil prices tumbling
in all markets.
"It's an extraordinarily volatile
period of time," said analyst
Charles Bureker of Sutro & Co. in
San Francisco.
Energy analysts said that it is the
reverse of 1979, when oil prices

surged and lines formed at gasoline
stations during the crisis in Iran.
The prices offered yesterday for
future crude and heating oil were
the lowest since early that year.
The futures market action fueled
a moderate rally in the stock mar
ket, as investors responded
buoyantly to expectations of
cheaper oil. The Dow Jones
average of 30 industrial stocks
closed up 14.34 points at 1,541.63,
with much of the gain coming in the
latest hour after traders became
aware of the oil price drop. Many
stocks of oil companies, meantime,
fell in price.
