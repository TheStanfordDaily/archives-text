Factory Output Rises
WASHINGTON — Paving the way for a
new surge of economic growth, America's fac
tories expanded their output of automobiles,
home appliances and furniture during Decem
ber and helped generate a strong 0.7 percent
gain in the nation's industrial output, the
Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday.
Economists said they were encouraged by
last year's strong finish and predicted a
healthy, low-inflation business climate during
1986. The business expansion is entering its
fourth year without any apparent signs of
weakness, many analysts believe.
"We foresee no recession at all," said
Ronald Utt, associate chief economist for the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
The White House, too, was buoyantly opti
mistic about business prospects. "For two
months straight we've had good, strong in
creases in industrial production," spokesman
Larry Speakes said. "This sizable increase
. . . combines with other data to show that
1986 will indeed be a good year for the eco
nomy."
The December gain follows a revised No
vember figure showing a rise of 0.6 percent in
production by the nation's factories, mines and
mills.
Output rose last month for most products,
including cars and trucks, appliances, televi
sions and air conditioners, and other consumer
goods, such as clothing and food. The produc
tion of business equipment rose 0.2 percent,
while the output of defense merchandise

climbed 0.5 percent. The output of mines and
utilities also increased.
Cap Questions Strikes
WASHINGTON — The United States is ca
pable of responding to terrorist attacks "very
quickly and very effectively" but must consider
whether its use of force "will discourage and
diminish terrorism in the future," Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger said yesterday.
Exploring the views of counterterrorism
that have often set him apart from Secretary of
State George Shultz, Weinberger cautioned
against the use of force in a less-than-precise
fashion and said: "I think that there are a lot of
people who would get instant gratification from
some kind of a bombing attack somewhere
without being too worried about the details."
One day after Shultz outlined his own views
of the proper U.S. response to terrorist ac
tions, Weinberger said at a Pentagon news
conference, "I think we have a responsibility
to take the actions that are effective in deter
ring future terrorism."
But, he added, "There have been a lot of at
tacks made in retaliation from time to time.
They haven't eliminated terrorism or terrorist
attacks on the people who made the immediate
retaliation." In one of the most recent such
raids, Israeli jets struck a Palestinian camp in
Tunisia in early October in response to the
murder of Israelis on a yacht in a harbor on
Cyprus.

Goetz Case Dropped
NEW YORK — A state judge dismissed at
tempted murder and assault charges yester
day against subway gunman Bernhard Goetz,
but gave prosecutors the option of taking his
controversial case to a third grand jury.
New York State Supreme Court Judge
Steven Crane, Jr. ruled that prosecutors had
committed "prejudicial error" when they in
structed grand jurors about the legal claim of
self-defense. Crane also said that prosecutors
withheld exculpatory evidence from the grand
jury, and that one of the witnesses may have
perjured himself.
Goetz still faces three counts of criminal
possession of a weapon and one count of reck
less endangerment. The tall, thin, 38-year-old
electrical technician drew international fame
after he shot four young men who he said had
tried to rob him of $5 in a Manhattan subway
train Dec. 22, 1984.
Market Garners Gain
NEW YORK — The stock market closed
with a rush of buying yesterday to post its
second straight gain.
Airline and computer stocks turned in stand
out performances in a fairly active session.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
jumped 14.34 to 1,541.63, bringing its gain for
the past two sessions to 22.59 points.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
reached 130.46 million shares, against 122.42
million Wednesday.
