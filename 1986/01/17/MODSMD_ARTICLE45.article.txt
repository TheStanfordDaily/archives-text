Budget Panel Reports
SACRAMENTO — The Assembly's fiscal
committee, in the first analysis of Gov. George
Deukmejian's $36.7 billion budget released last
week, said yesterday that the spending plan
underfunds many health, welfare, toxics and
education programs.
"It's more or less a status quo budget, wor
risome more for what it lacks than what it pro
vides," said Assemblyman John Vasconcellos
(D-Santa Clara), the democratic chairman of
the Ways and Means Committee.
Deukmejian submitted his proposed spend
ing plan for the fiscal year that begins July 1 to
the Legislature last week. That begins the six
month budget process by which Vasconcellos'
committee and its Senate counterpart go over

the huge document department-by
department and compile the Legislature's
budget version by June.
Vasconcellos' staff went through the pro
posed budget and released a 55-page prelimi
nary analysis that he said raises "significant
questions about the governor's spending
plans."
S.F. AIDS Report
SAN FRANCISCO — Early results of a
four-year examination of 800 gay men shows
half have been infected with the AIDS virus
and at least half of those still carry the deadly
disease, according to the researcher leading
the study.
Warren Winkelstein Jr., professor of

epidemiology at UC-Berkeley, also said that
the study seems to confirm that the risk of in
fection is far greater for those who have a high
number of partners.
The researcher is leading a $3.4 million
study of men who live within a two-mile radius
of San Francisco's largest homosexual section,
the Castro District.
Of those subjects, about 800 are
homosexual, Winkelstein said. Early results
show that half of those 800 have tested posi
tive for the presence of the antibody associ
ated with the AIDS virus, and at least half of
those actually carry the virus, known as
HTLV-111, although the subjects have not yet
developed AIDS.
Winkelstein also said the rate of infection is
directly related to the number of sexual con
tacts among gay men.
