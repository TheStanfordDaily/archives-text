### LIZ EGAN Staff writer 
More than 90 percent of the
Stanford community reads The
Stanford Daily, according to a
recent survey jointly conducted
by The Stanford Daily Publishing
Corp. and the Communications
Department.
During the month of Novem
ber, a study on Daily readership
was carried out by Communica
tions Prof. A 1 Gunther and his
class in research methods. The
students made 266 calls to fac

ulty, staff, graduate students and
undergraduates. Two hundred
forty were determined to be
Daily readers.
The questionnaire was then
directed at determining attitudes
toward the newspaper as a prod
uct, opinions about the Daily as
an advertising medium, and the
demographics of Daily reader
ship.
"Daily readers are young, af
fluent, well-educated local con
sumers," according to the
report.
The report also said that
newspapers "are making a strong
showing in competing for the atten
tion of the Stanford community," as
compared with television and radio.
More than 50 percent of those sur
veyed said they read a paper seven
times a week, and an additional 34
percent read a newspaper from
three to six times a week. Fifty-six
percent said they watched less than
one hour of television per day,
while 29 percent said they listen to
the radio the same amount of time.
Although most of the community
reads newspapers, and the most
read paper is The Daily, the report
shows a "considerable variation"
among students, faculty and staff
members in the frequency of Daily
reading.
According to the report, under
graduates are by far the most avid
readers, followed by graduate stu
dents, staff and faculty,
respectively. A significant gap
exists between the undergraduate
frequency and that of the other

three groups, as shown by the
table.
The report found that few faculty
members read The Daily once a
week, if at all. "Unfortunately, this
low frequency reading group also

comprises the Daily audience with
the highest income level, the group
with the greatest potential to at
tract advertisers," according to the
report.
Information about consumer

habits was obtained for Daily adver
tising purposes. The $2,700 that
was spent by the paper for the re
search will be helpful in an effort to

attract future advertisers, accord
ing to Dana Treister, The Daily's
advertising manager, who said the
money covered primarily the cost
of labor by the research students.
A survey of Daily readers aimed
at determining consumer
preferences and tastes included the
following:
• Credit cards were shown to be
the favorite method of payment —
80 percent use this plastic form of
money.
• The favored mode of transporta
tion was the car, with 62 percent
driving daily. Bicycles were second
at 58 percent.
• Sixty-four percent go to a movie
one to three times a month. "Even

the fact that 1 percent go to a movie
nine to 12 times monthly is
amazing," according to Treister.
The survey was additionally
composed to promote the work of a
graduate student in communica
tions. Questions were added to the
analysis concerning the theory of
"spiral of silence."
This part of the survey ques
tioned attitudes toward divestment,
police brutality, and the media's
portrayal of such issues. One ques
tion involved how willing a Daily
reader would be to enter a discus
sion on apartheid.
The results of this section of the
research are not yet available.
"It's good that both sides could
benefit mutually — the class could
test the hypothesis and get practi
cal experience . . . and we could
benefit our ad sales," Treister said.
