# Law Profs. Back Birds of a Feather
## 
### C.R. DOUGLAS Staff writer 
When former California Gov. Jerry Brown ap
pointed Rose Bird as chief justice of the state's
highest court, a new era began for California's le
gal system. From the day of her appointment,
Bird has been under attack from various sectors
of society on a wide spectrum of issues.
Critics focus on everything from the fact that
she is a woman to some unpopular decisions she
made as head of the California Department of
Agriculture.
In addition, Bird has been criticized for being
the only justice on the court not to have served
as a district attorney, but rather as a public
defender. Recently, this criticism has come to
fruition in a campaign to remove her from her
post.
Now that Bird is up for one of the confirmation
elections that takes place every four years, some
Stanford law professors have combined their in
fluence to support her cause.
Originally intended to protect citizens from a
judge who handed down unconstitutional deci
sions after being appointed, this confirmation
process has taken on political overtones with the
Bird controversy.
