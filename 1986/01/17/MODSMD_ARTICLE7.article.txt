When former California Gov. Jerry Brown ap
pointed Rose Bird as chief justice of the state's
highest court, a new era began for California's le
gal system. From the day of her appointment,
Bird has been under attack from various sectors
of society on a wide spectrum of issues.
Critics focus on everything from the fact that
she is a woman to some unpopular decisions she
made as head of the California Department of
Agriculture.
In addition, Bird has been criticized for being
the only justice on the court not to have served
as a district attorney, but rather as a public
defender. Recently, this criticism has come to
fruition in a campaign to remove her from her
post.
Now that Bird is up for one of the confirmation
elections that takes place every four years, some
Stanford law professors have combined their in
fluence to support her cause.
Originally intended to protect citizens from a
judge who handed down unconstitutional deci
sions after being appointed, this confirmation
process has taken on political overtones with the
Bird controversy.

California Chief Justice Rose Bird is up for a highly-contested confirmation election
that some Stanford law professors think she should win.
One of the major topics in this
battle is capital punishment.
Many who oppose Bird link the
facts that she personally opposes
the death penalty and that she
has voted to reverse every
death penalty case brought
before her. Although the death
penalty is certainly not the only
issue in this battle, it captures
the essence of the opposition's
argument: Rose Bird is injecting
her own beliefs into her judicial
decisions.
One of those who feels she
has been less than impartial in
her decisions is Boalt Law Prof.
Stephen Barnett. Although Bar
nett is not involved in any formal
way with the move to oust Bird,
he admits his sympathy with
those who do.
Formal opposition to Bird has
come from a number of state
senators, including H. L. Rich
ardson, who announced this
week his candidacy for lieutenant
governor. In addition to state
politicians, the California District
Attorneys' Association has been
quite active in the anti-Bird cam
paign.
According to Barnett, these
and other groups feel that the
decisions of Bird have been poli
tical and have shown bad judge
ment. "She hasn't been the
model of justice for the law," he
says. "This judge has gone too
far, forfeiting the public's confi
dence."
Locally, Prof. Michael Wald of
Stanford Law School has in
itiated a group of law professors
around the state to counteract
those who voice opposition to
Bird. Bothered by what he sees
as misinformation distributed by
those opposed to Bird, Wald's
objective is to involve law pro
fessors from around the state in
the election in an effort to pro
vide an objective analysis.
As a clearinghouse of informa
tion, Wald provides law profes
sors with documents and infor
mation necessary to inform
reporters and media adequately.
In addition he schedules law pro
fessors to speak at Rotary and
other civic organizations'
meetings around the state to
help define the issues most
salient in the campaign.
Wald's foremost concern is the
threat this confirmation election
poses to the democratic institu
tions of the state. "I don't view
this as an election about the
quality of certain judges," he
says.

Independent of his views
about Bird, Wald says that the
opposition is acting from a funda
mentally incorrect viewpoint.
"Many people argue that we
should vote against Bird because
(she is) not responsive to the
people, but if judges were solely
subservient to people, we
wouldn't have desegregation and
would have more limited free
speech."
His fear is that with a con
firmation law such as this, at
some time voters could in effect
change a constitution (state or
federal) by voting justices out of
office
Wald argues that opposition to
Bird is a reflection of conserva
tive activism, particularly in
response to her opposition to the
death penalty.
As a specialist on the death
penalty, Stanford Law Prof.
Robert Weisberg has also voiced
his concern over the recent op
position to Bird.
Unlike Wald, Weisberg admits
no aversion to the confirmation
process, yet he does have some
reservations about this particular
confirmation campaign.
"The danger in this is the elec
tion being controlled by mislead
ing campaigns. It is difficult to
fight off the effect of highly mis
leading political campaigns," con
tends Weisberg.
Weisberg feels that the accu
sations made against her, espe
cially those regarding cases
where the death penalty is in
question, are ungrounded.
"On all courts, both state and
federal, you get a wide variety of
opinions about the particular
legality of the laws and particular
legality of the death penalty,"
says Weisberg.
For this reason, Weisberg
argues that Bird is no exception
with regard to this issue.
"She hasn't said a thing which
does not have some clear legal
basis. It is a disputed area, and
she is at one end of the dispute,"
contends Weisberg.
"I think her opposition
wrongly assumes that she should
be voted out of office because
her views may conflict with a
majority of voters on certain is
sues, especially the death
penalty," Weisberg says.
So, for Weisberg the election
could end up ousting the contro
versial justice for unjust reasons.
An upcoming debate on the
Bird election is scheduled for the
afternoon of Jan. 24 at the San
Francisco Hyatt Regency. Spon
sored by the San Francisco Law
Society, it will feature Wald and
Barnett.

firmation law such as this, at
some time voters could in effect
change a constitution (state or
federal) by voting justices out of
office
Wald argues that opposition to
Bird is a reflection of conserva
tive activism, particularly in
response to her opposition to the
death penalty.
As a specialist on the death
penalty, Stanford Law Prof.
Robert Weisberg has also voiced
his concern over the recent op
position to Bird.
Unlike Wald, Weisberg admits
no aversion to the confirmation
process, yet he does have some
reservations about this particular
confirmation campaign.
"The danger in this is the elec
tion being controlled by mislead
ing campaigns. It is difficult to
fight off the effect of highly mis
leading political campaigns," con
tends Weisberg.
Weisberg feels that the accu
sations made against her, espe
cially those regarding cases
where the death penalty is in
question, are ungrounded.
"On all courts, both state and
federal, you get a wide variety of
opinions about the particular
legality of the laws and particular
legality of the death penalty,"
says Weisberg.
For this reason, Weisberg
argues that Bird is no exception
with regard to this issue.
"She hasn't said a thing which
does not have some clear legal
basis. It is a disputed area, and
she is at one end of the dispute,"
contends Weisberg.
"I think her opposition
wrongly assumes that she should
be voted out of office because
her views may conflict with a
majority of voters on certain is
sues, especially the death
penalty," Weisberg says.
So, for Weisberg the election
could end up ousting the contro
versial justice for unjust reasons.
An upcoming debate on the
Bird election is scheduled for the
afternoon of Jan. 24 at the San
Francisco Hyatt Regency. Spon
sored by the San Francisco Law
Society, it will feature Wald and
Barnett.
When former California Gov. Jerry Brown ap
pointed Rose Bird as chief justice of the state's
highest court, a new era began for California's le
gal system. From the day of her appointment,
Bird has been under attack from various sectors
of society on a wide spectrum of issues.
Critics focus on everything from the fact that
she is a woman to some unpopular decisions she
made as head of the California Department of
Agriculture.
In addition, Bird has been criticized for being
the only justice on the court not to have served
as a district attorney, but rather as a public
defender. Recently, this criticism has come to
fruition in a campaign to remove her from her
post.
Now that Bird is up for one of the confirmation
elections that takes place every four years, some
Stanford law professors have combined their in
fluence to support her cause.
Originally intended to protect citizens from a
judge who handed down unconstitutional deci
sions after being appointed, this confirmation
process has taken on political overtones with the
Bird controversy.

California Chief Justice Rose Bird is up for a highly-contested confirmation election
that some Stanford law professors think she should win.
One of the major topics in this
battle is capital punishment.
Many who oppose Bird link the
facts that she personally opposes
the death penalty and that she
has voted to reverse every
death penalty case brought
before her. Although the death
penalty is certainly not the only
issue in this battle, it captures
the essence of the opposition's
argument: Rose Bird is injecting
her own beliefs into her judicial
decisions.
One of those who feels she
has been less than impartial in
her decisions is Boalt Law Prof.
Stephen Barnett. Although Bar
nett is not involved in any formal
way with the move to oust Bird,
he admits his sympathy with
those who do.
Formal opposition to Bird has
come from a number of state
senators, including H. L. Rich
ardson, who announced this
week his candidacy for lieutenant
governor. In addition to state
politicians, the California District
Attorneys' Association has been
quite active in the anti-Bird cam
paign.
According to Barnett, these
and other groups feel that the
decisions of Bird have been poli
tical and have shown bad judge
ment. "She hasn't been the
model of justice for the law," he
says. "This judge has gone too
far, forfeiting the public's confi
dence."
Locally, Prof. Michael Wald of
Stanford Law School has in
itiated a group of law professors
around the state to counteract
those who voice opposition to
Bird. Bothered by what he sees
as misinformation distributed by
those opposed to Bird, Wald's
objective is to involve law pro
fessors from around the state in
the election in an effort to pro
vide an objective analysis.
As a clearinghouse of informa
tion, Wald provides law profes
sors with documents and infor
mation necessary to inform
reporters and media adequately.
In addition he schedules law pro
fessors to speak at Rotary and
other civic organizations'
meetings around the state to
help define the issues most
salient in the campaign.
Wald's foremost concern is the
threat this confirmation election
poses to the democratic institu
tions of the state. "I don't view
this as an election about the
quality of certain judges," he
says.

Independent of his views
about Bird, Wald says that the
opposition is acting from a funda
mentally incorrect viewpoint.
"Many people argue that we
should vote against Bird because
(she is) not responsive to the
people, but if judges were solely
subservient to people, we
wouldn't have desegregation and
would have more limited free
speech."
His fear is that with a con
firmation law such as this, at
some time voters could in effect
change a constitution (state or
federal) by voting justices out of
office
