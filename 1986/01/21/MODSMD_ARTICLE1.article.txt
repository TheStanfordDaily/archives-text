# Mural Displayed At Zapata Rally

### KARLA TINKLENBERG 
More than 150 people attended
Friday's unveiling of a new mural
at Casa Zapata that criticizes what
its artists perceive as the right
wing political stance of the Hoover
Institution and the alleged com
plicity of the University in Hoover
activities.
The unveiling of the mural, en
titled "Spirit of Hoover," also in
cluded a rally and unity march
from Hoover Tower. The event
was organized by the Movimiento
Estudiantil Chicano de Azatlan
(MEChA).
The mural, set against an
eclipsed sun, depicts a skeleton
tied to the Hoover Institution and
pulling it in half as small figures of
students also struggle to topple it.
Shown in relation to this are
scenes such as guerrillas marching
through the jungles of Central
America and white policemen
standing over South African
blacks with whips, as coins fall
into a piggy bank with the Stan
ford insignia on it.
As Michael Arguello, one of
seven undergraduates who

painted the mural, said, "Most of
us are outraged at the current
state of affairs; we are angered at
Stanford's role as an accomplice.
Through this mural, we are
proclaiming our rage and anger
and challenging others to join our
cause."
But in a letter published in
Friday's Daily, Hoover Institution
Executive Editor Walter Lammi
expressed concern over the
mural.
"Those of us who believe that a
university should encourage
respectful debate among differing
viewpoints — however widely
they differ — can only respond to
this sort of political thinking with
dismay," Lammi said in the letter.
The mural is the product of the
SWOPSI course "Murals as Social
Conscience Art" taught by Zapata
Resident Fellow Jose Antonio
Burciaga. The seven Stanford un
dergraduates who painted it are
Arguello, Emilio Rodriguez, Jr.,
Martin Bernal, Alonso Duenas,
Enrique Lopez, Alex Mojica and
John Sobraske.

third-floor mural in Casa Zapata. The mural, which was un
veiled at a rally Friday, was painted as a project for the
SWOPSI course "Murals as Social Conscience Art."
