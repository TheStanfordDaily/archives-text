### 
Just before dawn on Jan. 10, convicted murdurer
and rapist James Terry Roach was electrocuted in a
Columbia, S.C. prison and became the first person
in 22 years to be involuntarily executed for a crime
by someone under the age of 18. Eight years ago,
Roach was 17 when he and two companions raped a
South Carolina woman, killed her and her companion
and later returned to the scene of the murders to
mutilate the woman's body.
Despite appeals from Nobel Peace Prize winner
Mother Teresa, the secretaries-general of the
United Nations and the Organization of American
States, and former President Jimmy Carter, and
despite evidence that Roach may have been suffer
ing from the early stages of a mentally debilitating
genetic disorder at the time of his crime, South
Carolina Gov. Richard Riley refused to halt the ex
ecution. The U.S. Supreme Court had upheld the
decision two days earlier by a 7-2 decision.
The justice system must not be easy on criminals,
especially brutal murdurers such as Roach, but the
death penalty is an unjustifiable punishment â€”
regardless of the crime and the age of the criminal.
Many states and countries already prohibit execu
tion of minors, but the time has come for nations to
prohibit the death penalty altogether. Roach was the
51st person executed in the United States since the
Supreme Court reinstituted capital punishment in
1976.
Some would argue that the death penalty acts as a
deterrent to potential violent criminals, but the
evidence is inconclusive. Some research has dem
onstrated that execution offers no greater deterrent

than life imprisonment. But if a person is disturbed
enough to murder it is unlikely he would consider
realistically the consequenses of the action in the
first place.
Some would also argue that it is cheaper to exe
cute a criminal than keep him in prison, but often the
cost of lengthy court appeals associated with capitol
punishment cases far exceeds the sum needed to
sustain a prisoner for life.
Furthermore, capital punishment raises serious
questions of discrimination. Minorities who commit
crimes and murderers of whites receive the death
penalty more often than white criminals or those
who murder minorities.
Regardless of the statistical arguments against
capital punishment, however, there are basic,
philosophical objections.
Ideally, prisons should be places of reform, not
punishment. Executions undermine the reformative
role of justice and create a violent, punitive image of
the justice system. To execute a killer is to put the
justice system on the same level as the criminal.
No one has the right to sentence a criminal to
death, and it is wrong for courts to condemn one in
the interests of "the people." Human beings are too
vengeful and frail to decide whether another should
live or die, and the responsibility for a death is too
overwhelming for anyone or any anonymous group
to bear.
A good long look at the meaning of justice and the
value of human life is in order for Riley, the Su
preme Court and the 200 people who cheered
outside the prison when Roach was pronounced dead.
