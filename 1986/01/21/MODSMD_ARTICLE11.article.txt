Needy Consume
Others' Money
I am writing in response to the
editorial (The Daily, Jan. 16)
criticizing Congress' decision to tax
federal financial aid grants. It is not
this decision in particular that con
cerns me, but rather the justifica
tion The Daily gives to defend its
position that the government
should not tax the needy. The
justification, basically, is that if a
person needs money to accomplish
a particular goal, he is therefore
entitled to the necessary money.
This type of moral reasoning can
be very attractive, particularly if
you are very sympathetic to the
sufferings of other people. Few
want to see a person fail to get an
education or any other good be
cause he lacks the money.
However, this moral stance con
tains a contradiction, since any
society which pursues it closer and
closer to its logical end is certain to
destroy itself.
Consider that for such a person
to get the money he needs, he will
have to take it from someone who
can produce that money through
his own efforts. This is what our
government does in its tax-funded
welfare programs. For such a
system to work, it is necessary
that there be people who are able
to produce so that those who can
not produce as well can take ad
vantage of their effort. But the
more social welfare programs a
society initiates in pursuing its
moral goal, the greater the demand
there is on those who can produce.
There comes a point when the
producers can no longer produce
under this load, and once one has
eliminated all the producers those
who can't produce will have
nowhere to turn. Thus, the moral
system that rewards need will
have destroyed the means to its
end.
This process is analogous to the
case of an anemic person who
demands a certain number of pints
of blood from a healthy person in
order to live. The healthy person
may be able to regenerate his lost
blood in order to continue supply
ing the sick person, and the result
ing weakness may not be noticed.
However, if too much blood is
taken, the healthy person will die,
and the anemic person will soon
follow.

Death Penalty
Is Unjustifiable
The purpose of this letter is to
call attention to the lack of moral
justification for the death of James
Terry Roach in South Carolina's
electric chair on Jan. 10. Surely,

the execution of individuals who
commit crimes as juveniles is an
example of cruel and unusual
punishment. While almost all
civilized nations of the world have
rejected capital punishment as a
brutalizing and inappropriate exer
cise in legal authority, our nation is
still tolerating the death penalty for
juvenile crime.
A truly enlightened people will
not long remain indifferent to social
practices that dehumanize all. Now
that the story of young Roach's
death has hit the news services of
the world, one can only take com
fort in the hope that this case has
focused sufficient attention to
ensure that people will demand
from their elected representatives
the assurance that this terrible
wrong will not occur again. There
is still much work to be done in the
world before true justice prevails.
The older generation hopes that
new, idealistic leadership will come
from your ranks.
Roach's attorney, David Bruck,
must be greatfully thanked for his
enduring efforts on behalf of one of
the world's discarded people.

Hoover Mural
Is Appropriate
The new mural unveiled Friday
in Casa Zapata, entitled "Spirit of
Hoover," was produced by stu
dents enrolled in a class on
muralism. However, an executive
editor at the Hoover Institution,
Mr. Walter Lammi, finds the mural
"disrespectful" and deplores the
fact that these students received
academic credit (The Daily, Jan.
17). We wish to point out that the
assumptions behind Mr. Lammi's
complaint are unacceptable in a
properly governed academic sys
tem.
• Censorship. Students who do a
paper or a project for a course
should not be judged on the poltical
beliefs expressed therein, but only
on the quality of their academic
performance. To suggest other
wise amounts to political censor
ship. There are certainly political
beliefs expressed in "The Spirit of
Hoover" mural. Its design implies
that work done at the Hoover
Institution has real links with the
turmoil and poverty in Latin
America and South Africa and,
further, that the united efforts of
those people to free themselves
will bring down Hoover's ascen
dency. These political beliefs may
or may not be true, but there is no
doubt that the mural itself is a
brilliant statement of those beliefs
and that it appropriately serves for
partial fulfillment of the require
ments of an academically credited
course in muralism.

• Academic Credit. But this brings
up an even larger misconception on
Mr. Lammi's part, revealed in his
notion of granting credit. Papers
and projects are not in themselves
granted credit. Courses, approved
by departments, are offered for
credit. Students who enroll in
courses and fulfil their require
ments are then granted credit with
an appropriate grade. There are
two quite distinct levels of aca
demic evaluation here: First,
courses themselves are evaluated
as worthy (or not) of credit;
second, students' performances
are evaluated by the teachers. In
the case of the three extra
departmental programs now known
collectively as Innovative Academic
Courses (lAC), all proposals for
courses are evaluated by an ac
creditation committee consisting of
four faculty members, two stu
dents, the cognizant dean and the
faculty director. The procedure is
rather more rigorous than that in
most regular departments, and
many proposals are turned down.
It is not surprising that a
working member of Hoover has
misconceptions about the academic
structures surrounding political
discourse and about the accredita
tion process. The Faculty Senate's
principal charge against Hoover is
that its appointment and activities
are not properly integrated into the
usual systems of academic gover
nance. Mr. Lammi's misconcep
tions are further substantiations of
that charge. As the Ward report
recommended and the senate con
firmed, Hoover should be either
incorporated in the normal systems
of academic govenance or else
formally divorced. Mr. Lammi's
opinions, if representative of his
institution, are documents in the
file for divorce.

Abortion Debate
Lacks Reflection
Jan. 22 will mark the passing of
another year since the U.S. Su
preme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision, which opened the
floodgates to abortion in the United
States. The number of unborn
babies being killed by abortion in
this country is conservatively esti
mated at 1.5 million babies per
year.
Underlying this wholesale
slaughter of innocents is our lack of
sufficient reflection on the brevity
of our own mortal lives.
The world is not our permanent
domicile. We are but pilgrims here,
journeying through, and are meant
to be with God forever.
