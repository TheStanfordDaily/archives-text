# Leftists Are Most Oppressive
## 
### 
While it might not be unusual for a person to filter
and alter facts to suit a particular belief, liberals are es
pecially adept at it. The world is full of injustice, and
liberals are quick to point out their favorite trouble
spots, such as Nicaragua and South Africa. Unfortun
ately, they also ignore some of the most obvious prob
lem areas. Liberals concentrate their energy and anger
on rightist nations. Atrocities in leftist countries
receive little more than passing notice. The bias in the
liberal conscience leads to hypocrisy.
On campus, numerous rallies and sit-ins have taken
place protesting the oppression of the black population
in South Africa. No mention is made of Nicaragua's
Miskito Indians, who have been severely persecuted
by the Sandinista regime. Indian tradition is being sub
jected to Marxist-Leninist ideology. Nicaraguan troops
are occupying the Miskito homeland, and many Indians
have died in forced relocations to Sandinista detention
areas.

So, the question is: Why haven't the liberals organ
ized sit-ins and rallies in the Quad to protest the
oppression of the Miskito Indians? Is the fact that the
Sandinistas are a leftist government — and, therefore,
claim to represent the people — reason enough to
ignore such heinous crimes?
The liberal backing of leftist movements includes
governments and guerrillas. Catherine Atkin, in her Jan.
9 column on this page, offered one example. Making a
pitch for self-determination, she praises both the
Filipino New People's Army (NPA) and the Nicaraguan
government. The sad thing is that wliile liberals wish to
foster equality, freedom and human rights, the factions
they support do not.
One former liberal cause was the overthrow of the
shah of Iran. Liberals were quick to embrace the
Iranian revolution when it broke out, almost trampling
each other to death running to condemn the shah and
his regime. They hailed the new freedoms that would
become a way of life for the Iranian people. Maybe the
liberals should ask the severely persecuted Bahai sect
how they are currently enjoying their walk in the sun.
The Ayatolluh Khomeni government has proven to be
one of the world's most repressive.
While they may not be the most brutal, the Marxist-
Leninist states are the world's most systematic op
posers of freedom and human rights. The Bill of
Rights, which guarantees basic, inalienable rights,
would be an alien document in the communist
countries. Free will and actions are reserved for the

state alone. Coercion, persecution and denial form the
cornerstone of Marxist-Leninist rule.
Although Miss Atkin does not seem to realize it,
Marxist-Leninist governments such as those in
Nicaragua and the Soviet Union do not allow self
determination. At the end of World War 11, the Soviet
Union promised free elections in occupied Eastern
Europe. Those elections never occurred. Popular
uprisings, expressing the true will of the people, were
crushed in Hungary and Poland in 1956 and in Czecho
slovakia in 1968.
Nicaragua is another particularly good example.
During their battle to overthrow Dictator Anastazio'
Somoza, the Sandinistas pledged to bring about quick
elections and such rights as freedom of the press. No
votes were taken and the Sandinistas either took con-'
trol of the media or heavily censored it. Opposition po
litical parties were banned.
Tyranny is tyranny, however. And the right-wing
governments, such as those that rule the Philippines
and South Africa, are no less oppressive than their left
wing counterparts. But at least the rightist govern
ments offer the hope of self-determination and the in
stitution of liberty and equality. No communist or
Marxist-Leninist government has ever allowed free
elections. Yet in Latin America alone, military dictator
ships have been replaced with civilian governments in
Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru
and Colombia.
In revolutionary periods, the communists claim to
fight for the people. In practice, they fight "o'rify to
promote their own interests. The people are
suppressed.
Miss Atkin cited the New People's Army as one of
the groups struggling to secure self-determination for
its people. Such is not the case. Many Filipinos favor
the moderate opposition to rightist President Fer
dinand Marcos. Fearing a moderate victory in the up
coming presidential voting, the communist-led NPA is
boycotting the elections. Not only that, but the NPA is
intent on destroying the election process. Newsweek
magazine wrote, "Villagers who might have walked
miles to vote for (former President Benigno) Aquino
have learned how dangerous it is to defy the local
NPA." Instead of allowing the Filipinos a democratic
chance to unseat Marcos in the election, the NPA
wishes to keep Marcos in power so that it can increase
its influence. The NPA obviously does not favor free
elections. Let there be no illusion: If the NPA comes to
power, dictatorship will fall only to totalitarianism. ♦'
Liberals, with their support of leftist movements,
ignore the worst of the oppressors and aid the very
systems they profess to oppose. With the promise of
free elections and freedom comes only subjugation and
persecution. The left-wing governments are not the
ones to support if one favors self-determination and
respect for human rights and desires.
