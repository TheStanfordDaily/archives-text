# Leprosy and Life's Meaning
## 
### 
I had a dream. I dreamt that I was a huge
watermelon floating in the primordial soup of a
billion years ago, before life on our planet
existed. I don't really know how I got there; it
seems so illogical in the glare of rational exis
tence. Anyhow, I was there and quite alone, as
there were no other forms of life around at the
time. I found myself alone and searching — for a
path, for a way to get some meaning out of life. I
woke up before I could get the answer, but it got
me thinking. . . .
What is life? What is existence? Is it OK to
murder? If it isn't OK to murder, how about just
taking someone else's life? Or maybe depriving
them of freedom for no reason? Or perhaps with
some reason? What about killing the enemy?
What about killing enemy soldiers in time of war?
Enemy soldiers with families, young daughters
and sons, brothers and sisters and
grandparents? Enemy soldiers with aspirations
to greatness? Enemy soldiers defending their
homeland? Why are the Vietnam vets still having

such a hard time psychologically? They did kill
many innocent people — and they still don't
know the reason why. Do you? Should they feel
badly or shouldn't they? What about abortion,
child abuse, apartheid, Nicaragua, the contras,
terrorism, the CIA, communists, fascists, bad
taste, Libya? Should we be concerned about
these things and, if so, why? Does justice exist
in nature, outside of human society? If so, I
would like to see it. What is the justice behind
the earthquake in Mexico, famine in Africa,
floods in India? What is the justice behind getting
cancer, getting the flu or being killed in a plane
crash?
In physics, E 4 mc 2 . Are there similar equations
in justice? Does the killing of one wheelchair
bound American equal the killing of a certain
number of Palestinians? For the Nazis, one Ger
man soldier equalled 10 Frenchmen. One Jew

equalled a lampshade and 10 bars of soap. Per
haps it doesn't matter. Maybe suffering is OK.
The Bible seems to think so. And, if suffering is
a good thing, then inflicting it on someone else
might be OK, too. Who is to say that oppressing
others is better than being oppressed or that
being happy is better than being unhappy? Or
that a life of health and wealth is better than a life
of poverty and disease? Aren't they both sides of
the same coin? Aren't they all forms of existence
— each as real and valid as the other?
1 once took care of a patient who had leprosy.
He was missing half of his right foot, several toes
on his left foot, all his fingers and part of his
nose. He had infected what he had left of his left
foot, and each time I went to change his dressing
more green pus oozed out of his wound — un
believably foul green pus that would gag you. I
would get out my scissors and forceps and, after
allowing the pus to flow, would start snipping. I
would then probe the wound with a Q-tip soaked
in betadine in an attempt to get the antisceptic as
far in to the wound as possible. I would twist,
probe and twirl that cotton probe into the open
wound at the anterior portion of his foot until it
would pop out the posterior end. Then I would
get another Q-tip and go in from a different di
rection; I would exit somewhere closer to his
heal. Picture this: a foot suspended in mid-air,
the big toe and the one next to it missing — but
not just missing. A gaping hole exists where they
had rotted off. His whole foot is one big mass of
rotten flesh covered with grey skin.
While I was hacking away at what was left of
his foot, he would joke merrily in Spanish about
"zapatas" — shoes — and how he would find it
difficult to get a pair to fit him now. And we
would joke about "tortugas" — tortoises — and

how now he would be walking as slow as one.
The interesting thing about leprosy is that it
invariably disgusts other people more than it
does the leper himself. It attacks the peripheral
nerves so that the person with the disease feels
no pain. In fact, that is precisely the reason why
people with leprosy lose bits and pieces of their
body; they injure, burn, traumatize various parts
of their bodies without noticing it. The leper ad
justs to his disease, but those around him don't.
This patient was from Mexico, abandoned by
his family years ago when fingers started disap
pearing. Somehow, he had found his way to the
United States, and he was now having the time
of his life. He had a place to lay his head, a clean
bed, meals served in bed and all he could eat. He
had a companion, another leper with whom he
shared a room — someone to whom he could
talk and relate. And he had a doctor who cared
about him and with whom he could joke about his
feet. Life for this patient was happiness itself.
How could this man with so little have so much?
It's all cognitive, you see. Life is a point of
view. It's relative. Are you unhappy because you
feel that you may be letting other people down or
because you need to live up to other people's ex
pectations and can't? Upset because someone
turned you down for a date next Saturday or be
cause you got a "B" when it should have been a
"B +"? Forget that. Think about being a leper
with no fingers or toes. All you really need is a
place to lie your head and dream. Dream of being
a giant watermelon in the great primordial soup
of life.
