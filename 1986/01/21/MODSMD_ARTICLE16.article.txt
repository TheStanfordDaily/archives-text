## SDI Will Advance The Arms Race 
### 
Research conducted by a U.S.
defense think tank, the R&D As
sociates, recently discovered an
unintended offensive capability of
the satellite-based laser system
being developed for the Reagan Ad
ministration's Strategic Defense
Initiative (SDI). As an integral part
of this "Star Wars" program, these
"directed energy weapons" would
be used to destroy Soviet nuclear
missies in their "boost phase"
shortly after take-off. Strikingly,

VIEWPOINT

this defensive function is not the
laser's only strength. The research
team deduced that these lasers, or
biting the earth, could feasibly
strike an enemy city, thereby in
cinerating the likes of Moscow.
Assuming this information is cor
rect, detrimental consequences lay
ahead for either the United States'
heretofore controversial defense
plan or, more importantly, for the
future of substantive nuclear arms
control agreements. Until now, the
Soviets have internationally
denounced SDI as a destabilizing
force in the delicate arms control
process. They base this diehard
belief on the assumption that "Star
Wars" intrinsically harbors an offen
sive capacity. Hence, in light of the
new data, impassioned Soviet con
cern over the militarization of space
appears justified.
Consequently, since President
Reagan remains deadset against
compromise on his space defense
shield, the future for substantive
arms control agreements seems
bleak. Due to its offensive nature,
deployment of SDI would fan the

flames of escalation. The Kremlin's
quest for military parity vis-a-vis
the United States has in the past
been, and will continue to be, an in
tegral part of Soviet strategic
policy. Accordingly, finding them
selves in a seemingly inferior posi
tion, the Soviets would be com
pelled to develop an improved
counterforce system.
Until now, Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev has appealed to his U. S.
counterpart to discontinue research
and development on SDI in ex
change for appreciable advances in
arms control. To show the sincerity
of their commitment, the Soviets
have unilaterally implemented a nu
clear test moratorium, calling for
U.S. reciprocation. Furthermore,
the Soviets would agree to drastic
cuts in offensive arsenals, contin
gent, of course, upon ending the
"Star Wars" program.
As tensions mount, it would be
hoove the president to understand
the legitimacy of Soviet apprehen
sions toward the laser system and,
accordingly, reassess his uncom
promising commitment on SDI. Es
sentially then, he had better place
this powerful bargaining chip on the
negotiating table, thereby abruptly
halting — and gradually reversing
— the impending escalation of of
fensive weaponry.
If, however, development of SDI
advances full steam, it is a foregone
conclusion that the Soviets must
follow suit. A rejuvenation of the
arms race into a qualitatively new
sphere would greatly undermine
the security of both nations.
