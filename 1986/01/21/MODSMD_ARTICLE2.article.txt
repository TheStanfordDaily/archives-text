# Tutu Talk To Be Transmitted to Terman
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
A remote hook-up in Terman and
Skilling Auditoriums will allow nearly 500 people
who could not buy tickets for tonight's sold-out
campus speech by South African Bishop Des
mond Tutu to watch him live.
Terman and Skilling will open at 7 p.m., and
seating will be on a first-come, first-serve basis
for the 7:30 p.m. program, which will include in
troductory remarks by University President
Donald Kennedy, discussion by a panel of stu
dents and faculty and a performance by the Stan
ford Gospel Choir. There will be no admission

charge at the broadcasts.
One thousand student tickets for Tutu's
Memorial Auditorium speech went on sale on
Jan. 13 and were sold out within 90 minutes. An
other 500 tickets reserved for faculty, staff and
community members were sold in 50 minutes
the next day.
Because KZSU is also planning to air the
entire program live, it will not be broadcast on
loudspeakers outside Memorial Auditorium, as
has been done for several popular programs in
the past.
Tutu, an Anglican bishop in Johannesburg and
winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his op
position to South Africa's apartheid system of ra
cial separation, is appearing here as part of a

month-long tour of the United States. His tour
also includes appearances in Washington, D.C.,
Harvard University and UC-Santa Barbara.
The panel discussion scheduled to precede
Tutu's speech at tonight's program will include
Political Science Prof. David Abernethy, Law
Prof. William Gould, Education Assoc. Prof. Joel
Samoff, graduate student Edward Edozian,
seniors Steve Phillips and Alice Stauffer and
M'akhoba Maloba, a South African and spouse of
a graduate student.
Anthropology Prof. James Gibbs will
moderate the panel and will introduce Tutu.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Ron Hudson and
History Assoc. Prof. Clay Carson will also take
part in the program.
