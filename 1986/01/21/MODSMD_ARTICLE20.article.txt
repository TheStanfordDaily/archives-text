## Bug One More Time 
### ANDREW McCLUNG Staff writer 
Now, fans, I preface this, my penultimate
column, with the warmest greetings and best
wishes, along with all of the appropriate
apologies for the brevity of these recent
columns.
But what the hey, it's better that way, no?
Why do they have locks on the doors at
Denny's when every Denny's is open 24 hours a
day forever? — Solomon Grundy, born on
Monday, sailing on the Bay of Fundy, friend
ofMcGeorge Bundy
They don't.
At least, not at the Denny's in Redwood
City, the staff of which somewhat reluctantly
consented to discuss the issue with me. The
people at the Denny's in Mountain View were
more aggressively unenthused about res
ponding to my line of questioning.
It turns out that there are no locks on the
doors, and that when major interior repairs
must be effected (the only circumstance, ap
parently, that even temporarily abrogates the
Denny's commitment to perpetual restaurant
service), the management elects to park a
truck in front of the entrance.
Or so they tell me.

W7ry do some toasters specify which slot to
put "one slice" in? What possible difference can
it make which side my single slice toasts in, and
how can the toaster tell? — A.Y., junior
I had always wondered about this myself,
so I called the General Electric consumer in
formation hotline (which is a toll-free number,
by the way).
I was stunned and amazed to learn that
G.E. sold off its toaster division to Black and
Decker a few years ago, and I'm sure that
many of you altered your stock portfolios ac
cordingly at that time.
Nevertheless, the consumer informant ex
plained to me that, in actual fact, it does make
a difference which side that single slice goes
into. You see, the typical toaster has a ther
mostat on one side, and it regulates the cur
rent that flows through those thin, wavy little
heating elements inside the toaster.
If you put your slice on the wrong side, the
air in the empty side heats up to toasting tem
perature a lot faster than it would if a piece of
bread were in there. And the thermostat, lo
cated near that empty slot, will therefore
conclude that the bread has been adequately
heated long before that is really the case. And
so it will cause your "toast" to pop out while it
is still just a flabby white slice of the "staff of
life" (as current advertising parlance
describes it).
