## Hot Peppers Rock in Mem Aud 
### TRACY FURUTANI 
Friday's opening salvo of this
year's Concert Network Series,
which featured the Red Hot Chili
Peppers and the Uptones, resulted
in a number of dubious firsts, in
cluding: the first slam dancing in
Memorial Auditorium, which
resulted in damage to the stage bar
rier; the first performance involving
spitting on a Cardinal crowd; and
the first time Palo Alto High School
students outnumbered Stanford
students within 50 yards of Hoover
Tower.
The show began only an hour
late, a fact hardly noticed by the
disappointingly small but compen
satingly vocal audience. The
Berkeley-based Uptones delivered
an interesting, multifaceted show,
their style ranging from straight
hard rock to reggae. Though they
are a young band (the average
group member's age is 18), the
Uptones displayed an uncanny
amount of technical skill. And,
judging from the highly partisan
crowd, they were the local-boys
done-good.
In addition to the usual two
guitars-bass-drums-vocals setup,
the Uptones are augmented by a
fabulous brass section that added a
new dimension to what would have
been standard reggae-flavored
dance music. Particulary impres
sive were solos by saxophonist
David Ellis, whose cool playing
complemented vocalist Erik
Rader's harried style.
Lyrically, the Uptones' material
springs from The Clash

and has a generous dose of U2-ish
idealism. While Rader's on-stage
impatience added energy to his per
formance, it seemed wrong for the
more idealistic songs. Still, with
song titles like "K.U.S.A." and
"Compromise," and given the con
tinual windmilling by guitarists Eric
Dinwiddie and Charles Stella,
Rader's manner was not incon
sistent with the rest of his
group.

Watch them â€” they're going
places.
After the Uptones' well-received
encore, the audience tensely
awaited the appearance of the Red
Hot Chili Peppers, a Hollywood
based band with a strong Southern
California following. Clearly, they
were aiming to create a following in
the north.
The Peppers' music is best des
cribed as "surf-funk," a hybrid com

bining the strong bass lines of surf
music with the strong rhythm of
funk. Vocalist Anthony Kiedis acts
as a rapmaster, spitting and shout
ing the lyrics while the instruments
provide background. What creates
the Peppers' cult is their desire to
shock and disgust. If you've seen
their "True Men Don't Kill
Coyotes" video, in which the band
members smear fluorescent paint
over each other's nude bodies, you
might have expected a live perfor
mance to be more of the same. You
would not have been disappointed.
As the band played the theme
from "Rocky," singer Kiedis ap
peared, clad only in American flag
trunks. Throughout the evening, he
proceeded to make propositions to
arbitrary females and males in the
audience.
The trouble with the Peppers is
that their music is extremely
repetitive; every song sounds the
same. They write strong surrealis
tic lyrics (even if you need a lyrics
sheet to understand them). They
undeniably have energy and are
definitely a shocking act (at one
point Kiedis spat a mouthful of liq
uid over the first few rows).
However, ultimately, the atro
ciously distorted guitar sounds the
same, the Quaalude-driven drum
ming sounds the same and the in
comprehesibly shouted words
sound the same.
After the Uptones announced
that their music was of the "get up
in the aisles" variety, one could see
a lone Concert Network usher,
standing between the stage barrier
and the surging mob, his eyes wide
with horror at what was to come.


The Berkeley-based Uptones, cast as local-boys-done-good,
played in Memorial Auditorium on Friday night with the Red Hot
Chili Peppers.
