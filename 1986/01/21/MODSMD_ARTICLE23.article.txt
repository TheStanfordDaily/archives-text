# Infinite Q Entertains Coffee House Crowd
## 
### MORTY POSNER Staff writer 
What? You say that the last
thing you thought you'd see a
Stanford engineering major
doing was playing in a jazz band?
Well look no more — I found ex
actly that in the jazz fusion group
Infinite Q at the Coffee House
Friday night.
Infinte Q is composed of
five Silicon Valley engineers,
two of whom, Greg Lowitz on
sax and Derek Granath on
electric bass, are Stanford
graduates. On Friday they
played with infinite style to the
bustling Coffee House crowd.
Although they occasionally
apologized for playing mostly
what they considered standard
jazz fusion numbers, Granath
said of the Rodney Laws tune
"Always There": "We like it.
We're gonna play it anyway."
Everyone was so involved in the
music they could hardly com
plain.
Lowitz, who has written six
copyrighted songs, said that
while Infinite Q plays mostly
standards, the group tries to
perform a broad variety of jazz
fusion. Undoubtedly, their selec
tions were eclectic, ranging from
Dave Brubeck (and his familiar
"Take Five") to Michael Jackson.
One set featured their own ar
rangement of "Birdland," which
they performed for the first

time, another jumped back in
time to "Blues in the Night."
I knew that jazz fusion was
what Doc Severinsen was
playing when he wasn't on "The
Tonight Show," but Lowitz gave
a more definitive answer: "It's
got the style and feel of old jazz
while fusing it with electric in
struments." It has a modern
beat with a "jazz-rock feel."
Lowitz said that he and the
rest of the group — Dave Haw
thorne on drums, Raleigh
Estrada on electric guitar and
Rich McCauley on keyboards,
have had a steady gig at a restau
rant in San Jose since they got
together five months ago. Infin
ite Q's first gig was arranged by
McCauley's wife for, quite ap
propriately, a Mitsubishi Hallo
ween party in October.
The group's name, Infinite Q,
is immediately recognizable to
engineers and computer
programmers, but a fuzzy like
me had to ask. Apparently, it
means data structure. Lowitz
said he and the others in the
group took a poll at their
respective jobs and the engi
neering crowd picked Infinite Q.
Lougee seemed pleased with
the turnout, which included not
only the group's friends from
Hewlett-Packard and Watkins-
Johnson, but those returning
from other campus events.
"Beethoven was rockin' next
door and "La Cage (Aux Folles")
was playin,' " Lougee said.
