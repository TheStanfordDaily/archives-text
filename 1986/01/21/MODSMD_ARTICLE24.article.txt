## Card Bears a Big Game Defeat And the Big Loss is Koberlein 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
The long weekend was not a kind one for the Stan
ford men's basketball team.
Saturday, in front of a sellout crowd of 7,500 in
Maples Pavilion, the Cardinal let a six-point halftime
lead slip away and lost to rival UC-Berkeley 75-69.
But the hardest news came Sunday when an ex
amination confirmed fears that senior forward Earl
Koberlein had torn ligaments in his right knee. Kober
lein is out for the rest of the season.
"I felt lucky up until now," Koberlein said yesterday.
"I've been fortunate injury-wise. This is the first injury
that's kept me out of a game since I've been here."
Koberlein injured the knee when he avoided a colli
sion that was caused when Cal guard Kevin Johnson
charged into Stanford guard Keith Ramee with 7:38
remaining in the first half. The injury was not a result of
any actual physical contact.
"I went to practice and looked at tapes, and I really
couldn't tell exactly what I did," Koberlein said.
"It's just a shame for his career to be ended like
this," Stanford Coach Tom Davis said after the game.
"He's been the heart of the program here. He was my

first recruit at Stanford — no one else wanted him. He
was the cornerstone of the program — always trying
to get the other kids to play better."
For the second time in two weeks, Stanford has
learned that a senior three-year starter will be out for
the season. On Jan. 8, the Cardinal learned that guard
Steve Brown's career on the Farm ended when a
stress fracture in his right leg failed to heal.
Koberlein will undergo surgery today at 11 a.m. at
the Palo Alto Surgical Center, with Dr. Gordon
Campbell performing the operation. The extent of any
cartilege damage will also be assessed at that time.
Koberlein is expected to be in a hard cast for three to
four weeks and in a hinge cast for another six to eight
weeks.
In his four-year career at Stanford, Koberlein scored
767 points and had 430 rebounds in 105 games. This
year he was averaging 10.3 points and 5.3 rebounds in
the Cardinal's first 18 games, all of which he started.
Koberlein said rehabilitation may take nine months,
but he still has hopes of playing professionally over
seas. "When I was in Australia, I talked to people over
there, and they said I could probably play there," he
said. "I'd really like to play in Italy, though. Italy would

scored 12 points while playing without the flak jacket he has been wearing to protect sore ribs.
But the ailing Cardinal suffered yet another injury blow when it was learned yesterday that for
ward Earl Koberlein (right) would be out for the remainder of the year.
