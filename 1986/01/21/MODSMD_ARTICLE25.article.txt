# Track Rolls Indoors

In what Stanford Coach Brooks
Johnson described as a "relaxed"
meet, the Cardinal men's and
women's teams got out of the
blocks quickly in 1986 with a
season-opening win in Sunday's in
door double-dual track and field
meet in Seattle.
Despite the absence of the Card
inal's top two men's distance run
ners, Marc Olesen and Ryan Stoll;
the top three women's distance
runners, Ceci Hopp, Chris Curtin
and Cory Schubert; and the team's
best overall athlete, Jay Thorson,
the men's and women's squads
combined for a 164-71 win over the
University of Portland and a 129-
122 win over the University of
Washington, the tournament host.
"I think this meet sets a positive
tone and an upbeat spirit for us this
year," Johnson said yesterday.
Though the Stanford arsenal was
without some of its biggest guns,
the squad still managed to set 10
meet records, and it was led by
senior Pam Dukes, who qualified
for NCAA competition with a
tournament-record toss of 53-feet,
two-and-three-quarter inches in the
women's shotput.
Johnson, explaining why some of
his best runners didn't make the
trip, said he used the indoor meet
as warmup for the 1986 campaign
and as a test for some of his
younger athletes.
"For us, it (the indoor meet) is a
reward for a lot of kids who worked
hard in the fall," Johnson said. "It's
a perfect meet. There is competi
tion but not a really intense rivalry.
The kids come first, then the com
petition and then the score."
In addition to Dukes, Stanford
got typically strong performances
from seniors Jeff Atkinson and
Regina Jacobs. Junior Pam Board
