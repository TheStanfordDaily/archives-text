# Track Rolls Indoors

### PETER HAVEN Editorial staff 
In what Stanford Coach Brooks
Johnson described as a "relaxed"
meet, the Cardinal men's and
women's teams got out of the
blocks quickly in 1986 with a
season-opening win in Sunday's in
door double-dual track and field
meet in Seattle.
Despite the absence of the Card
inal's top two men's distance run
ners, Marc Olesen and Ryan Stoll;
the top three women's distance
runners, Ceci Hopp, Chris Curtin
and Cory Schubert; and the team's
best overall athlete, Jay Thorson,
the men's and women's squads
combined for a 164-71 win over the
University of Portland and a 129-
122 win over the University of
Washington, the tournament host.
"I think this meet sets a positive
tone and an upbeat spirit for us this
year," Johnson said yesterday.
Though the Stanford arsenal was
without some of its biggest guns,
the squad still managed to set 10
meet records, and it was led by
senior Pam Dukes, who qualified
for NCAA competition with a
tournament-record toss of 53-feet,
two-and-three-quarter inches in the
women's shotput.
Johnson, explaining why some of
his best runners didn't make the
trip, said he used the indoor meet
as warmup for the 1986 campaign
and as a test for some of his
younger athletes.
"For us, it (the indoor meet) is a
reward for a lot of kids who worked
hard in the fall," Johnson said. "It's
a perfect meet. There is competi
tion but not a really intense rivalry.
The kids come first, then the com
petition and then the score."
In addition to Dukes, Stanford
got typically strong performances
from seniors Jeff Atkinson and
Regina Jacobs. Junior Pam Board
was also impressive. Atkinson set a
meet record with a personal-best
time of 2:26.3 in the men's 1,000
meters, he took first in the men's
mile with a clocking of 4:13.9 and
he was a member of the men's two
mile relay team that ran to a tourna
ment record 7:51.7.
Jacobs, after coming off an out
standing cross-country season, ran
to a meet record of 10:21.2 in the
women's two-mile run. In the
women's 600-yard dash, Board,
with a time of 1:25.0, edged the
Huskies' Sonya Adams for another
Stanford meet record. Board also
was a member of the winning

women's mile relay team.
With the help of some talented
newcomers to bolster an already
strong squad, the women are
looking to retake the Pacific 10
Conference title from UCLA.
Freshman Stacy Zartler ran to a
meet record 2:59.2 in the women's
1,000 meters, and she finished
second in the women's mile with a
time of 5:01.3.
Johnson also praised the efforts
of another freshman, Tina Niu, who
set a new Stanford indoor mark
with a leap of 35-5 in the women's
triple jump. It was the first time she
had ever competed in the event.
Sophomore high jumper Lisa
Bernhagen cleared at 5-10 for yet
another tournament best for the
women.
