# Gaels Nearly Storm Stanford
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
The buzzer sounded, ending
the game.
Most of the 350 who nearly suf
fered from cardiac arrest in
Maples Pavilion Friday night could
finally relax and rejoice in a 72-71

Cardinal victory over the St.
Mary's Gaels.
However, most of the mem
bers of the Stanford women's
basketball team did not rejoice.
Standouts Virginia Sourlis and
Kami Anderson strode off the
court, shaking their heads as if
Stanford had survived a storm it
shouldn't have.

The storm was named St.
Mary's, a tenacious group from a
small school in the East Bay that
came to upset the Cardinal. With
13 seconds left, Stanford, leading
by one point, felt the full force of
its tenacity.
Gael co-captain Lisa Bertaccini
fired up a prayer from the top of
the key. While those in atten
dance held their collective
breaths, the ball bounded in, out
and into the waiting hands of
Stanford center Jill Yanke with
just a few seconds left on the
clock.
But before anyone could relax,
Gael forward Connie Frank
reached in and stripped the ball
from Yanke's grasp. Frank
grabbed the loose ball and
released a shot near the basket at
the buzzer.
Frank had hit clutch baskets
during the entire second half, but
this short five-footer trickled in,
around and out, giving Stanford
its 11th win of the season.
Gael Coach Terri Rubenstein
said she was disappointed with
the final outcome, but from the
look on her face you could tell she
was proud of her plucky clan of
hoopsters.
"They've had that kind of spirit
for the last three years," she
said. "Whenever we play Division
I schools, we're always out
matched talent-wise. We know
we have to be tenacious and ag
gressive."
St. Mary's (8-5) almost ruined
the brilliant offensive heroics of
Yanke, who shot 13-for-19 from
the field for a career-high 26
points.
"Offensively, Yanke had a
great game," Stanford Asst.
Coach Amy Tucker said.
"Defensively, we had break
downs at almost every point."
The Cardinal, out-rebounded
37-33, missed the services of
Kim Mercer, who is, according to
Tucker, Stanford's best defensive
post player. A pulled back muscle
has kept Mercer out of action the
last two games.
Tonight Stanford meets the
UC-Berkeley Bears at Cal.

Fortunately for Stanford, junior Erica Mueser and her Card
inal teammates came down to earth in time Friday night to
beat the scrappy upstarts from St. Mary's 72-71.
