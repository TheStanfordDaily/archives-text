# Spikers Win 3-1
## Club team plays hard 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
Shortly after most of the sellout
crowd from the Stanford-UC
Berkeley basketball game had fil
tered out of Maples Pavilion Satur
day, the Cardinal men's volleyball
team opened its season with a 15-4,
15-6, 13-15, 15-6 victory over
scrappy Chico State.
In a stark contrast to the large,
boisterous crowds that turned out
for the Cardinal women's volleyball
games this season, only a few spec
tators were on hand for the men's
opener. Many that might have been
interested in attending were prob
ably turned off by the Cardinal's
competition, unheralded Chico.
But though the Wildcats are only
a club sports team, they were any
thing but a pushover for Stanford.
Despite playing with a much smaller
lineup and considerably less talent,
Chico played tenaciously on
defense and was able to capture the

third game, a moral victory in itself.
In the end, however, the Card
inal had too much size for the
Wildcats. The Chico hitters were
forced to hit against a Cardinal
block that consisted in part of 6-
foot-6 Chris Braun, 6-6 Scott
Fortune and 6-5 Jon Root. Because
of the towering Stanford block,
many of the Wildcats' spikes sailed
long.
After winning the first game 15-
4, the Cardinal broke to a 9-3 ad
vantage at the outset of game two
behind the strong hitting and block
ing of Braun and Fortune. Chico
stayed close, but with the score 11-
6, Stanford won four consecutive
points, all on Wildcat hitting errors,
to take the second game, 15-6.
Any plans the Cardinal players
had of quickly disposing of the
Wildcats in the third game were
postponed when Chico jumped to
an 8-1 lead. At this point it was
Stanford, not Chico, that was
rapidly collecting hitting errors.
Though the Cardinal did eventu
ally tie the game at 13-13 due to
Root's resurgent hitting, the
Wildcats wrapped up the game
when Root and Braun hit out on
successive points.
The fourth game was dominated
by the trio of Braun, Fortune and
Root, and when Fortune pounded a
kill from the middle of the court, the
Cardinal had captured the game,
15-6 and the match.
Braun and Root led Stanford of
fensively with 17 kills and Fortune
followed with 14 for the match.
Stanford's next game will be its
California Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association (CIVA) opener at home
against Cal-State Northridge on
Jan. 27, and two days later, the
Cardinal will travel to Moraga for a
date with another CIVA opponent,
St. Mary's.

The Stanford men's volleyball team had to dig a little more than expected against a tough Chico
squad Saturday. Still, John McDermott and the Card managed a four-set win.
