# Frosh Sink Chico, Prep For Pac-10
## 
### AMY FRANCETIC Staff writer 
Viewing Saturday's away dual
meet against Chico State as an op
portunity to race the freshmen and
prep them for the Pacific 10 Confer
ence battles ahead, the Stanford
men's swim team crushed Chico
80-33, winning all events except
the 50-meter freestyle.
Accompanying the team in place
of Stanford Coach Skip Kenney,
Asst. Coach Ted Knapp said, "It
was a successful day. We got all of
the freshmen off campus for an
away meet, and they swam real
consistently — not real fast, not
real slow. The Chico pool facilities
are not typical of our normal dual
competiton, and the slower pool
was reflected in the times."
However, the Cardinal turned in

good enough times to dominate
their 1985 Division II Champion op
ponents and boost the freshman
dual record to 3-0.
The four-and-a-half-hour road
trip "helped to develop stronger
team unity," Knapp said. "Spending
that much time together on the
road makes it easy for everyone to
become closer."
Perhaps the highlight of the meet
was when the Stanford 400
freestyle relay team, composed of
Jay Mortenson, Dave Schraven,
Colin Bole and John Hodge, inched
by Chico to finish one-tenth of a
second ahead. "I liked coaching that
relay the most. Everyone was up
and yelling; it was really exciting,"
Knapp said.
The Stanford men's diving team
contributed to the victory by taking
first and second on both the three
meter and one-meter boards.
