# Grapplers Take 7th in Fullerton
## 
### PETER CASTILLO Staff writer 
Although the Cardinal wrestling
squad finished seventh at the
Southern California Duals Sunday
at Cal-State Fullerton, Stanford
Coach Chris Horpel was pleased
by the individual performances of
the athletes.
"I think we benefited from it. At
first we thought we were over our
heads. We made a lot of progress
and some of the wrestlers im

proved greatly in one day.
Stanford narrowly lost in the
opening round to Arizona State
29-27 as the Sun Devils, racked
by injuries, had to forfeit three
matches.
Kurt Kassulke (190 pounds)
defeated ASU's Don Fyre 12-
2. In a controversial match, Stan
ford's Dave Lee (167 pounds)
beat Dennis Roberts 17-5. Horpel
felt that during the match the ref
eree made mistakes that cost Lee
a technical fall, a victory of 15 or
more points.

Horpel reviewed the videotape
with the referee after the meet,
who agreed he had made some
mistakes after viewing the match.
In its only bad dual meet, the
University of New Mexico
destroyed Stanford 42-10. Lee
was the only Cardinal to register a
non-forfeit win by beating Jay
Head 13-3. In another controver
sial match, Jeff Bradley (134
pounds) lost to Chris Lutrelle of
New Mexico 7-5.
In the final period, Bradley at

tacked and was able to grab hold
of Lutrelle's leg. Lutrelle coun
tered by using a crotch hold, but
according to Horpel, Bradley
clearly had the superior position.
It was only a matter of time until
Bradley could gain control for a
two-point takedown and tie the
match.
The referee called a stalemate
after five seconds instead of
waiting the normal 15, because he
believed no further points could
be scored in the current position.
