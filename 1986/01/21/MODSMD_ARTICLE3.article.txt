### DAVID EMERSON Staff writer 
Ernest Arbuckle, one of the main
forces behind the rise of the Stan
ford Graduate School of Business to
international prominence, was
killed in a car accident Friday night.
Arbuckle, 73, and his wife Kath
erine, 65, died when their 1985
Mercury station wagon drifted off
state Highway 1 near Monterey and
struck an abutment, according to
the California Highway Patrol.
Katherine Arbuckle was driving
at the time of the accident. There
were no immediate indications of
the cause of the crash. The couple
were believed to be in transit from
their Portola Valley home to their
other residence in Carmel.
Ernest Arbuckle, who was dean
of the business school from 1958 to
1968, was "an academic pioneer
who began the school's impressive
rise to pre-eminence," according to
University President Donald Ken
nedy. Arbuckle also served as a
Stanford trustee from 1954 to 1958
and from 1968 to 1976.
During his 10-year tenure as
dean, Arbuckle saw the business
school move into its new three
story buil ding, its capital funds and
operating expenses rise seven-fold
to more than $15 million, the faculty
more than double and the median
admission test scores rise from the
64th to the 94th percentile nation
ally.
In 1966, then-Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare John
Gardiner called Arbuckle "the
ablest, most imaginative business
school dean in the country."
Born in Lee, N.H., he went to
Stanford as an undergraduate,
where he was elected student
council president and received a
degree in history in 1933. He
earned his MBA in 1936.
During World War II he won a Sil
ver Star for gallantry as the com
mander of a PT boat in the Mediter
ranean.
After his decade as dean of the

business school, Arbuckle became
board chairman of Wells Fargo Bank
from 1968 to 1977 and chairman of
Saga Corp. from 1978 to 1981. His
other directorships included
Hewlett-Packard, A. Johnson &
Co., Owens-Illinois and Utah Inter
national.
He was also a member of Presi
dent Nixon's Commission on Inter
national Trade and Investment
Policy from 1970 to 1971, the
Trilateral Commission from 1973 to
1977 and chairman of the Stanford
Research Institute from 1966 to
1970.

When asked to state the most im
portant qualities for executives, Ar
buckle listed character and integrity
first, followed by strong motivation
and personal drive, skill in interper
sonal relationships and intelligence.
On another occasion, he said, "If
the private enterprise system as
we know it is to survive, we must
instill in our students attitudes that
accept integrity, rooted in the
bedrock of principle, as more im
portant than operational com
petence."
Business School Dean Robert
Jaedicke said, "Ernie set a model
for businessmen serving as dean,
