### MARK SMOYER TRACY POTTER Staff writers 
The Stanford women's gymnas
tics team traveled to UC-Davis
Saturday for its first meet of the
season, coming away with a solid
win and confidence that a success
ful campaign lies ahead.
The tri-meet included Chico
State as well as Stanford and UC-
Davis, but it was dominated by a
Cardinal team consisting only of
five freshmen and one sopho
more, as Stanford Coach Homer
Sarpino looked to give his rookies
some experience before the start
of PacWest competition next
weekend.
Stanford was confident going
into the meet, despite its youth.
The confidence was justified, be

cause the youth included a gym
nast Sarpino called the nation's
top recruit coming out of high
school, freshman Ginny Rhe. Ac
cording to Sarpino, Rhe will be in
contention for the NCAA individ
ual title at season's end.
Rhe, who participated for the
United States in the most recent
World University Games, didn't
waste any time in showing why
practically every women's col
legiate gymnastics program
wanted her. She won the all
around individual title with a score
of 34.9, and Sarpino said she could
have scored even higher.
Rhe's performance led the team
to a score of 164.9, 12 points
higher than second place Chico.
The Cardinal swept the top three
spots in the vault and uneven bars
competiton and took first and
second in the beam.

Winning the floor exercise was
freshman Cheryl Doo, whose stel
lar performance in the meet came
as a very pleasant surprise to Sar
pino. "She looked great, she's
really got grit," he said. The
freshman from Hawaii placed
second all-around with a score of
33.95.
Meanwhile, the day before the
women's competition, the men
were learning in San Jose that vic
tory is sometimes a little less than
sweet.
Such was the case Friday night
after the Stanford men's gym
nastics team handily defeated the
San Jose State Spartans 264.75 to
247.25.
Stanford Coach Sadao Hamada
said the performance was "poorer
than I expected. Somehow, the
team took the meet not too
seriously."

Hamada attributed a poorer
score than expected — the Card
inal had hoped for a 270 — to a
lack of concentration. "If it's a
high pressure meet against one of
the more competitive teams . . .
we'd do better," he said.
A below-average team score
was turned in on the pommel
horse, at 40.9, while Hamada said
the team vault score, 46.35, was
"one of our better scores at any
meet.".
Fine performances were given
by sophomore Mike Matzek, who
tallied a 9.5 on the high bar, and
senior Gary Smith on the vault
(9.45). Freshman Scott Schaffer
scored a 9.4 on the vault, and
junior co-captain Mark Arnold
finished with a 9.3 on the rings.
On Friday, Stanford will head
south for a tough Pacific 10 Con
ference matchup against UCLA.
