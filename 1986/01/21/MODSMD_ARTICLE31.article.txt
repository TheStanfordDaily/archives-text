At its first dual meet of the season at San Jose State Saturday, the Card
inal women's swim team whomped the Spartans 100-22, winning 12 of the
14 events and setting five pool records.
Stanford won every event except the 200-yard butterfly and the 100-
yard freestyle, which were both captured by Spartan senior Angie Wester.
Stanford senior Kathy Smith set two pool records in the breaststroke
events and was part of a record-setting team in the 200-yard freestyle
relay, along with freshmen Aimee Berzins and Jenna Johnson and senior
Diana Zock.
Johnson won the 100-yard butterfly in an NCAA qualifying time of 55.34,
more than three seconds ahead of runner-up Wester.
Johnson said making the time cut was not her big goal for the race, be
cause there are still many chances to qualify. But she said, "I was pretty
happy about it, for this part of the season."
Johnson also won the 50-yard freestyle despite feeling sluggish at the
start, she said. Her time of 24.42 was just four-tenths of a second ahead of
second-place finisher Zock, a Cardinal co-captain.
Freshman Dana Anderson set a pool record in the 200-yard freestyle
with a time of 1:53.27, just ahead of Berzins, who finished in 1:53.62. An
derson also captured first place in the 500-yard freestyle.
Sophomore Stacy Shupe, en route to a 1,000-yard freestyle win, set a
*— 1 -°oord of 10:15.66.
