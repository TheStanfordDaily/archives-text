Situation in Yemen Still Unclear
DJIBOUTI, Afars — Rebels and forces loyal to President Ali Nas
ser Mohammed both claimed to be gaining control of South Yemen
yesterday as foreigners evacuated by ship reported new fighting and
said that the week of civil war had "absolutely devastated" Aden, the
capital of the strategically situated Soviet ally on the Arabian Penin
sula.
Mohammed was reported by several sources to be somewhere in
South Yemen after a weekend flight to Ethiopia, and official sources
said he had spoken by telephone with the leaders of Algeria, Libya
and Syria in an effort to gain backing against the Marxist hard-liners
attempting to overthrow him.
The Soviet Union, which uses the Arab world's only Marxist state
as its sole military facility in the region, published an appeal from
South Yemeni Prime Minister Haidu Abu Bakr Attas for an end to the
fighting. Attas, who was in New Delhi when the fighting began, has
been in Moscow since Thursday.
But the Soviets, faced with a civil war in which both sides profess
allegiance to Moscow, have cautiously avoided taking sides. Agence
France-Presse reported from Moscow that Attas was received by
Yegor Ligachev, the Soviets' No. 2 party official, rather than by his
governmental counterpart, in what diplomats said was a clear
message that for the time being Moscow was not fully recognizing
him as prime minister.
The fighting began last Monday, after an apparent shootout at a
Politburo meeting between supporters of Mohammed, a Marxist who
has angered hard-liners by his willingness to deal with pro-West Arab
neighbors, and former President Abdul Fatah Ismail. Ismail
reportedly wanted to return South Yemen to the doctrinaire Mar
xism it followed before he was forced to resign in 1980.
Moslems Want Gemayel Out -
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Lebanese Moslem leaders returned from
crucial talks in Damascus yesterday with demands for the removal
from power of the Christian president, Amin Gemayel.
The comments by Prime Minister Rashid Karami and former
Prime Minister Selim Hoss, who have tried to play conciliatory roles
between the president and his opponents in the Moslem camp, were
uncompromising and harsh.
"The regime has proven that it will stop at nothing to abort any
(peace) initiative, and boycott (of Gemayel) is now de facto," Hoss
declared.
A political source privy to the mood in Damascus said the question
now was not "whether to deal with Amin or not but how to make him
fall."
Against the backdrop of explicit political warnings to Gemayel,
both pro-Syrian militia groups and the Syrian Army beefed up their
military presence along the approaches to Christian areas in the
north, raising fears of a show of force to make Christians accept a
new political accord.
An offensive by pro-Syrian militias on Wednesday was halted the
next day, but ground movements indicated that the military option
had not been ruled out by Syria. An additional Syrian infantry brigade
was dispatched to the village of Dhour Chweir, overlooking the
Christian Bikfaya, in the last 24 hours, the sources added.
Syrian tanks and 42 rocket launchers reportedly were moved from
the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley to the upper Metn, another
Christian area. A joint military operations room was set up to coor
dinate activity among the national Syrian Social Party, the Druze
Progressive Socialist Party, the pro-Syrian Baath Party and the
Lebanese Communist Party.
Tunnel To Unite France, Britain
LILLE, France — Pursuing a centuries-old dream, Britain and
France yesterday announced the construction of the world's longest
underwater tunnel to provide the first fixed link between the island
kingdom and the continent of Europe.
The $6.6 billion rail-only project was unveiled at a joint press con
ference here by French President Francois Mitterrand and British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. It was chosen in preference to
three rival plans that combined road and rail links across the 21-mile
stretch of water known as the English Channel to the British and La
Manche (the sleeve) to the French.
Hailing what he depicted as "the biggest civil-engineering project
of the 20th century," Mitterrand said the privately financed tunnel
would represent a "geographic, political and economic" link between
France and Britain. Thirty-two banks already have pledged more
than $5 billion of the estimated cost.
Lesotho Citizens Cheer Coup
MASERU, Lesotho — Thousands of persons poured into the
streets here yesterday, cheering and dancing, to celebrate a military
coup d'etat ending the 20-year rule of Lesotho's prime minister,
Chief Leabua Jonathan.
For most, Jonathan's ouster seemed to mean an end both to
Lesotho's confrontation with South Africa, which surrounds the tiny
mountain kingdom, and to the economic blockade South Africa
imposed on the country three weeks ago.
Little apprehension was expressed about the takeover of the gov
ernment before dawn yesterday by Maj. Gen. Justin Lekhanya, the
politically conservative commander of Lesotho's 3,000-man
paramilitary force.
Lekhanya's calls for national reconciliation and a return to the
traditional values of this highly conservative society were broadcast
throughout the day on the state-run radio here and appeared to calm
Lesotho's 1.5 million people.
Foreigners Blocked From Polls
MANILA, Philippines — A key member of the Philippine Election
Commission said yesterday that foreign journalists and international
observer teams, including representatives of the U.S. Congress, will
be banned from the polling places during the special presidential elec
tion scheduled for Feb. 7.
Speaking to local and foreign reporters at a weekly political forum,
commission member Jaime Opinion said the ban is permitted in the
nation's newly written election code, which he said provides prison
terms of up to six years for any foreigners coming within 50 yards of
the voting centers on election day.
During the last Philippine election, a May 1984 contest for 183
legislative seats, foreign journalists were allowed inside the polling
places, where many witnessed widespread election abuses, including
ballot box stuffing and harassment of voters by local politicians
belonging to Marcos' ruling party.
