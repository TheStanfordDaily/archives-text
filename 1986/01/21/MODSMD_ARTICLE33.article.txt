# Nation Narks First Holiday Honoring King
## 
### 
ATLANTA — With festive parades, solemn
vigils, passionate speeches and a glittering musi
cal extravaganza, the United States yesterday
marked the first national holiday in honor of Mar
tin Luther King, Jr., the martyred civil rights
leader whose dream of freedom and justice has
inspired millions of Americans.
Vice President George Bush flew to Atlanta,
King's birthplace and the focal point of the
nationwide holiday activities, for a wreath-laying
ceremony at King's white-marble tomb and an
ecumenical service at Ebenezer Baptist Church,
were King once served as co-pastor.
"In his lifetime, many criticized Martin Luther
King's dedication to nonviolence," Bush said.
"They said it won't work, they said it was im
practical. Well, I say that America today bears
witness that Dr. King's faith in America was true
faith. Love has overcome hate."
During the interfaith service, South African
Bishop Demond Tutu — like King, a Nobel
Pearp Prize winner — was awarded the annual

Martin Luther King, Jr. Nonviolent Peace Prize
by King's widow, Coretta.
"I tremble as I stand in the shadow of this
great person," Tutu said, as he received the gold
medal bearing King's likeness. Tutu added that
he accepted the award on behalf of his fellow
black South Africans, who he said are "peace
loving to a fault" in their struggle against apart
heid.
Among the dignitaries at Ebenezer Baptist
were Secretary Samuel Pierce Jr. of the Housing
and Urban Development Department, President
Reagan's only black cabinet member; Sens.
Robert Dole (R-Kan.) and Edward Kennedy CD-
Mass.), both members of the federal commission
overseeing preparations for the national holiday
activities; Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris and
Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young.
In Montgomery, Ala., where King first rose to
national prominence as leader of a anti
segregation bus boycott in 1955, hundreds of
blacks stood on the steps of the state capital

where Gov. George Wallace had once declared
"segregation now, segregation forever" to hear
the governor's proclamation honoring King.
In Birmingham, a seven-foot statue of King
was unveiled in a park. In the early 19605, King
led a series of demonstrations in the city in the
face of fire hoses and police dogs and was once
arrested and jailed. The Birmingham protests
were a major impetus behind passage of the
1964 Civil Rights Act.
In Memphis, Tenn., a vigil was held at the
Lorraine Motel, where the charismatic leader
was cut down by a sniper's bullet on April 4,
1968, as he stood on the balcony. King had gone
to Memphis to lead a demonstration of striking
garbage workers.
Under a law enacted by Congress and signed
into law by Reagan three years ago, the third
Monday of January is set aside as a federal
holiday to honor King's birthday, which actually
is Jan. 15.
