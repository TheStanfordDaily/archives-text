# 'Panic' Lowers Crude Oil Prices to $20 a Barrel
## 
### 
Oil prices plunged toward $20 a
barrel yesterday in what traders
called a "panic" atmosphere as too
much oil found too few takers on
world markets.
Analysts said the continuing
sharp drop in crude oil prices, espe
cially for oil sold on the so-called
"spot" market for immediate
delivery, could translate into
cheaper prices at gasoline pumps
within a few weeks. And analysts
said they see no quick end to the
price slide.

In Saudi Arabia, where increased
production of oil was blamed for
much of the falloff in prices over the
last week, Oil Minister Sheik Ah
mad Zaki Yamani was reported
ready to approach Britain and other
nations about coordinating produc
tion to prevent a full-blown collapse
of oil prices.
The precipitous decline was des
cribed by Kuwait's oil minister as
"price anarchy" that could last
three months before producers, es

pecially the Organization of Petro
leum Exporting Countries, can
reorganize and put a cap back on
production levels.
It was OPECVapparent decision
in early December to protect its
"fair market share," even if prices
fell, that led to increased production
and the quick fall-off in prices that
began in earnest the middle of last
week. Mild weather, cutting
demand for heating oil, has wor
sened the oversupply.
One key type of crude oil from

Britain's North Sea to be delivered
in April slipped yesterday to $19.50
a barrel in London markets. In this
country, the so-called benchmark
West Texas Intermediate crude for
February delivery dropped more
than $2 to $21.27 a barrel.
Data Resources in Lexington,
Mass., estimates that a one-year
decline of $5 per barrel in crude-oil
prices would reduce the U.S. infla
tion rate by 1 percent and increase
the gross national product by 0.6
percent.
