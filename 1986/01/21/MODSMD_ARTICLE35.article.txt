Congress Faces Cuts
WASHINGTON — Confronted with the
nasty task of slashing popular government pro
grams before facing the voters in November,
members of the 99th Congress reconvene
today for what is certain to be a tumultuous
election-year session.
In addition to the usual political posturing
that normally slows the legislative process
before an election, the lawmakers will be
laboring this year under an extraordinary
legislative mandate known as Gramm-Rudman
— the budget-balancing act named for its aut
hors, Republican Sens. Phil Gramm of Texas
and Warren Rudman of New Hampshire.
Enacted late last year, Gramm-Rudman re
quires Congress to trim the federal deficit to
specified levels beginning March 1. Congres
sional leaders predict that it will force senators
and representatives to choose between two
highly unpalatable alternatives that they have
been pondering for years — either cutting pro
grams favored by middle-class voters or
raising taxes.
Normally under such circumstances,
Congress might be expected to take the easy
way out by doing nothing or delaying the deci
sion until after the election. But some mem
bers are predicting that election-year pres
sures will have the opposite effect in 1986.
Even so, the task of complying with
Gramm-Rudman is unlikely to be accomplished
without tremendous acrimony between Demo
crats and Republicans and additional friction

between Congress and President Reagan. As
one Senate aide put it, "You'll see an already
partisan environment become electric with
partisanship."
Indeed, partisan politics will color virtually
every major issue facing Congress during this
session, including the House-passed initiative
on tax reform, proposals to narrow the na
tion's mammoth trade defict, continued aid for
the Nicaraguan rebels, arms sales to Arab na
tions, sanctions against South Africa, aid for
financially beleaguered American farmers and
efforts to combat terrorism worldwide.
Eastern Lay-Offs
NEW YORK — Eastern Airlines, hurt by
fare wars with competitors enjoying lower
operating costs, said yesterday that it will lay
off 1,010 flight attendants, reduce pay for the
remaining 6,000 ?nd put in place tough new
work rules aimed at improving productivity.
An Eastern spokesman said that the work
rule changes and payroll reductions will save
the troubled carrier between $400 million and
$500 million this year alone.
The actions, which Eastern President
Joseph Leonard said "were demanded by the
marketplace," put the nation's third-largest
carrier on a collision course with its unions.
Robert Callahan, head of the union that
represents Eastern's flight attendants, vowed
that "since it is a fight you want, we will fight
you ... in the boardrooms, in the banks, in

the media, on Wall Street and with the public
. . . and maybe in the streets." He added, "It's
all-out war."
However, he gave no indication of what ac
tion the union would take other than to repeat
an earlier promise that there will be no strike
before March 1.
On Feb. 28, Eastern's 60 lenders could pull
the carpet out from under the airline unless it
is able to gain vast new concessions from its
workers. Eastern owes $2.5 billion on which it
must pay interest of $220 million annually.
Probe Nears Uranus
More than eight years after leaving the
earth, the Voyager 2 spacecraft on Friday may
unlock some of the mysteries of Uranus, the
seventh planet from the sun, circled by at least
nine rings and 12 moons and one of two planets
to rotate on its side.
Voyager 2, with one radio inoperative and
the other barely operating, flew past Jupiter in
1979 and Saturn in 1981, sending back dra
matic pictures and greatly increasing the
knowledge of the solar system. Now the
spacecraft, which has already outlived its
design life, will home in on one of the most
mysterious of the nine planets.
In the six hours that Voyager will traverse
the Uranian system, it will return more infor
mation about the third-largest planet than was
learned in more than 200 years of earthbound
astronomical observation.
