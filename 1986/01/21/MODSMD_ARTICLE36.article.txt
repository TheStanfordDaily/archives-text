King Day in California
Californians celebrated the first national
holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
with parades and marches throughout the
state yesterday while activists staged a civil
rights-style sit-in at the South African Consu
late.
South Africa Bishop Desmond Tutu,
who called for a campaign of civil disobedience
against apartheid, questioned whether the
non-violence advocated by King would work in
South Africa.
"I myself believe that the strategy of non
violence succeeds where there is a minimal
moral standard," Tutu said at a news confer
ence in Los Angeles prior to a King celebration
dinner hosted by Mayor Tom Bradley. "Martin
Luther King, Jr. wondered whether his non
violent technique would have worked in Nazi
Germany. . . .
"In South Africa, I suspect we don't have
the constituency which has the moral minimum
standard to which appeal can be made — which
would be outraged and appalled," he said.
Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in
1984, was presented with the Martin Luther
King, Jr. Peace Prize during an ecumenical
service at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church
earlier yesterday.

Galactic Threads
LOS ANGELES — An astronomer has dis
covered faint "threads" weaving their way
through the center of the Milky Way galaxy
that are more than 600 trillion miles long,
opening a new page in astronomical research.
The "threads" have never been seen before
and no one is certain what they are, where
they came from or what they mean.
"It was quite unexpected," says the
astronomer, Mark Morris of the UCLA, who
made the discovery with a colleague, Farhad
Yusef-Zadeh of Columbia University.
"There is nothing known in the astrophysi
cal realm that can account for them. It took
awhile to convince ourselves that they are
real,"Morris said.
The "threads" are far too faint to reproduce
in most publications. But they appear, in the
high-resolution graphs produced by the scien
tists, as narrow, uniform threads arching
across the center of the Milky Way galaxy.
But the scientists aren't sure of the compo
sition of the "threads." At this point, they are
more convinced of what the "threads" are not
than of what they are.
The most likely explanation, Morris sugges

ted, is that the threads are "hot radiating
plasma that is flowing and confined by the mag
netic field" of the galaxy.
Morris and Yusef-Zadeh have been at the
forefront of research on the galactic center,
using the relatively young field of radio
astronomy to look through the galactic dust
that obscures the center from optical tele
scopes.
Mayor Joins Talks
OAKLAND — Negotiations in the Oakland
school strike now include Mayor Lionel Wilson,
but both sides yesterday said they were no
closer to a settlement.
The mayor joined the talks on Sunday, ex
actly two weeks after the Oakland Education
Association voted overwhelmingly to strike
the 51,000-student district.
"There was a lot of dialogue back and forth"
after Wilson stepped into the talks, said Sharon
Jay, a member of the union bargaining commit
tee.
She said school officials spent most of yes
terday evaluating a new counter-offer from the
union, which has 2,800 members.
