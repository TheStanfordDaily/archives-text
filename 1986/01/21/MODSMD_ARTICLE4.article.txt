# Peace Corps Improves Relations, Says Director
## 
### NGA DANG 
The director of the U.S. Peace Corps
this weekend called for continued funding of
the organization, stressing its importance in
establishing good relations with the Third
World.
"The Peace Corps was one of the wisest
inventions ever made, reflecting the spirit
of America, showing that we are a nation
that shares and cares," Loret Ruppe told a
Terman Auditorium audience Friday night.
But in the face of Capitol Hill budget
cutting, the Peace Corps has been forced to
reduce its volunteers from 3,440 to 2,600

this year, Ruppe said.
"I hear that the Pentagon has $162 mil
lion for subscriptions and in-house publica
tions and I can't send Americans who want
to serve Chad," she said.
There are now 6,000 Peace Corps volun
teers in 61 countries. Forty-one volunteers
are recent Stanford graduates. Since 1961,
872 Stanford graduates have gone abroad
as Peace Corps volunteers, placing Stan
ford eighth among leading instutions
producing volunteers.
Ruppe's speech was one of the numerous
events held this weekend on Third World
development. She spoke at a symposium
titled "Volunteering in Third World Devel

opment: What is at Stake?"
An audience of 200 gathered to listen to
personal experiences, proposed solutions
and advice given by speakers including
Ruppe, Political Science Prof. David Aber
nethy, Law School Dean TomMcßride and
Medea Benjamin of the Institute of Food
and Development Policy. University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy served as
moderator.
The weekend's events were sponsored
by the Stanford International Development
Organization (SIDO) and the Overseas De
velopment Network (ODN).
In her opening address, Ruppe also
urged Americans to single out and attack

the problem of world hunger, which she
termed "the greatest obstacle to peace."
According to Ruppe, the difficulty in at
tacking famine has more to do with psychol
ogy and politics than with horticulture. She
said the solutions lie in long-term grass
roots programs such as placing teams in
Africa for 10 to 20 years to stress continu
ity rather than sending one volunteer for
two years. She urged increased collabora
tion between the Peace Corps and other
agencies, such as the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and U.S. Aid for International
Development.
Besides the immediate benefit received
by Third World countries through volun
teerism, the United States benefits from the

knowledge brought back by the volunteers,
according to Ruppe.
"Through the personal link of the Peace
Corps, we begin to see that the concerns of
a Latin American, Asian or African family
are not unlike ours," she said.
The United States experiences far
reaching benefits from the program, ac
cording to Ruppe. "Around the world I can't
go to any embassy without finding 30 to 40
percent of the personnel having served the
Peace Corps," she said.
Although the motivation to join the Peace
Corps is the same as it was in the '60s,
the volunteer of the '80s is better-trained,
older and has specific skills,
according to Ruppe.
"The things you do for
others come back to reward
you," she said.
Abernethy, a former
Crossroads volunteer in
Africa, advised future volun
teers to be realistic enough to
think they can make some dif
ference but not naive enough
to think they are going to
make very much difference.
"If you can combine unsel
fish motives with selfish
motives, I think your reason
for being out there will be
more credible to yourself and
to others. If you are unable to
unselfishly change the world,
you're able to help yourself by
learning the world and you
will benefit no matter what
happens," Abernethy said.
More important than lead
ership skills, the volunteer
must have "followership"
skills, that is, listening to
others and being sensitive to
their needs, Abernethy said.
