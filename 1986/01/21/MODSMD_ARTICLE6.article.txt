# Give Us This Day Our Daily Bagel

The New York Times has labeled them
"unsweetened doughnuts with rigor mortis
Stanford students know them as standard
weekend brunch fare.
For certain individuals, however, bagels are
much, much more.
Like many other breads, the bagel has a long,
romantic history. Legend tells that it was in
vented in 1683 by a Viennese baker in honor
Johan Soviesky, a Polish prince who had saved
the city from marauding Turks.
Called a "beygel," its name was derived from
the Old High German word "boug," meaning
"ring," because it was shaped like the prince's
stirrup.
Little did the grateful baker know that his
tasty tribute would one day be the object of
desire for countless hungry individuals — bagel
junkies.
Bagel junkies know that the bagels you buy by
the bagful at the supermarket aren't bagels at all,
but preservative-packed pillows of starchy
dough that bounce when you throw them against
the wall. Bagel junkies know that real bagels
become as hard as rocks in four to five days, or
when left on a food service tray for several
hours.

Bagel junkies count the days to the weekend
when they can get their bagel fix at University
Food Service. They can always be recognized by
the devasted look in their eyes when the hashers
tell them that the bagel delivery truck has bro
ken down and won't be coming today, by the
furtive way that they lurk around the bagel box
waiting for a fresh load to arrive and by their hys

terical cries when they realize their favorite type
is gone: "What do you mean you're out of
cinnamon-raisin ones?"
Bagel junkies realize that they'll have to wait
'til the next weekend to get their fix, and as a
result, do one of two things. They either

consume vast quantities in one sitting,
hamster-style, or they attempt to beat
the system, saving 20 bagels from Sun
day brunch in their room, only to. learn
that lack of preservatives prevents such
bagels from lasting more than a few
days.
If you suffer from these symptoms,
there is a good chance that you too, are
a bagel junkie. If you are, or if you're
just looking for a healthy snack alterna
tive to Twinkies and Ding-Dongs,
there's good news — you don't have to
wait until the weekend any longer.
The Store sells "David's Bagels," ex
tra chewy morsels that are delivered
daily by an operation of the same name
located in the Town and Country Vil
lage.
Renee Remy, The Store's assistant
manager, says The Store receives only
about eight bags of bagels per day.
"But if we carried more, we'd prob
ably sell more," she says. Other bagel
outlets on campus include Baker Street,
The Grand Marketplace, the Coffee
House and Encina, which all sell bagels
seven days a week.

The problem is, they go fast. "We're
almost always sold out by noon," says
Kathy Campbell, Baker Street
manager. So what do you do if you have
a craving for a bagel dinner, or if you
want to buy 100 bagels for a dorm study
break?

The Bagel Works, Inc. opens its
doors from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. on week
days and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends
to sell its freshly-baked beauties at
$3.90 for a dozen. Located one street
over from University Avenue at 129
Lytton Ave., The Bagel Works is the
supplier for many local supermarkets
and most on-campus food stores, as
well as University Food Service.
"Sundays we sell about 5,000 bagels
(retail). It's our busiest day,"says Bagel

Works manager John Muller. "Weekdays
we sell around 2,000 to 3,000."
Billing its crusty creations as "The
Original New York Water Bagels," The
Bagel Works makes them from a third
generation secret recipe that remains a
closely guarded mystery.
"We use a better quality flour than
most places, and a malt which is spe
cially brought in from the East Coast,"
he says. "A lot of our customers say
that they're like New York bagels."
Unlike most store-bought bagels,
The Bagel Works makes its bagels from
a minimum of ingredients: hi-gluten
flour, water, malt, yeast and salt, and
most importantly, "no preservatives at
all," Muller says.
"We also use a very precise standard
of water to flour, and we try to keep the
consistency the same everytime," he
adds.
The Bagel Works offers a wide vari
ety of bagels to suit the most
descriminating bagel lover; plain, corn,
egg, poppyseed, sesame seed, onion,
salt, pumpernickel-rye, garlic, wheat
and cinnamon-raisin are the standard
types.

Renee Remy, The Store's assistant
manager, says The Store receives only
about eight bags of bagels per day.
"But if we carried more, we'd prob
ably sell more," she says. Other bagel
outlets on campus include Baker Street,
The Grand Marketplace, the Coffee
House and Encina, which all sell bagels
seven days a week.

The problem is, they go fast. "We're
almost always sold out by noon," says
Kathy Campbell, Baker Street
manager. So what do you do if you have
a craving for a bagel dinner, or if you
want to buy 100 bagels for a dorm study
break?

The Bagel Works, Inc. opens its
doors from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. on week
days and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends
to sell its freshly-baked beauties at
$3.90 for a dozen. Located one street
over from University Avenue at 129
Lytton Ave., The Bagel Works is the
supplier for many local supermarkets
and most on-campus food stores, as
well as University Food Service.
"Sundays we sell about 5,000 bagels
(retail). It's our busiest day,"says Bagel

Works manager John Muller. "Weekdays
we sell around 2,000 to 3,000."
Billing its crusty creations as "The
Original New York Water Bagels," The
Bagel Works makes them from a third
generation secret recipe that remains a
closely guarded mystery.
"We use a better quality flour than
most places, and a malt which is spe
cially brought in from the East Coast,"
he says. "A lot of our customers say
that they're like New York bagels."
Unlike most store-bought bagels,
The Bagel Works makes its bagels from
a minimum of ingredients: hi-gluten
flour, water, malt, yeast and salt, and
most importantly, "no preservatives at
all," Muller says.
"We also use a very precise standard
of water to flour, and we try to keep the
consistency the same everytime," he
adds.
The Bagel Works offers a wide vari
ety of bagels to suit the most
descriminating bagel lover; plain, corn,
egg, poppyseed, sesame seed, onion,
salt, pumpernickel-rye, garlic, wheat
and cinnamon-raisin are the standard
types.

The New York Times has labeled them
"unsweetened doughnuts with rigor mortis
Stanford students know them as standard
weekend brunch fare.
For certain individuals, however, bagels are
much, much more.
Like many other breads, the bagel has a long,
romantic history. Legend tells that it was in
vented in 1683 by a Viennese baker in honor
Johan Soviesky, a Polish prince who had saved
the city from marauding Turks.
Called a "beygel," its name was derived from
the Old High German word "boug," meaning
"ring," because it was shaped like the prince's
stirrup.
Little did the grateful baker know that his
tasty tribute would one day be the object of
desire for countless hungry individuals — bagel
junkies.
Bagel junkies know that the bagels you buy by
the bagful at the supermarket aren't bagels at all,
but preservative-packed pillows of starchy
dough that bounce when you throw them against
the wall. Bagel junkies know that real bagels
become as hard as rocks in four to five days, or
when left on a food service tray for several
hours.

Bagel junkies count the days to the weekend
when they can get their bagel fix at University
Food Service. They can always be recognized by
the devasted look in their eyes when the hashers
tell them that the bagel delivery truck has bro
ken down and won't be coming today, by the
furtive way that they lurk around the bagel box
waiting for a fresh load to arrive and by their hys

terical cries when they realize their favorite type
is gone: "What do you mean you're out of
cinnamon-raisin ones?"
Bagel junkies realize that they'll have to wait
'til the next weekend to get their fix, and as a
result, do one of two things. They either

consume vast quantities in one sitting,
hamster-style, or they attempt to beat
the system, saving 20 bagels from Sun
day brunch in their room, only to. learn
that lack of preservatives prevents such
bagels from lasting more than a few
days.
If you suffer from these symptoms,
there is a good chance that you too, are
a bagel junkie. If you are, or if you're
just looking for a healthy snack alterna
tive to Twinkies and Ding-Dongs,
there's good news — you don't have to
wait until the weekend any longer.
