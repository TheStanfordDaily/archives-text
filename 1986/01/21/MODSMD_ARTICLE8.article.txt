# Tutu's Travails Reviewed
## 
### STEVE STREED 
Bishop Desmond Tutu's opposition to the
policies of his home country of South Africa
dates back to at least 1957, when he resigned a
teaching position in protest of the inferior educa
tion given blacks in South Africa.
His stand against the racist system of apart
heid received great recognition in 1984, when
Tutu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
The citation that accompanied the prize said
the award was "a gesture of support" both to
Tutu and "to the South African Council of
Churches," as well as to all those involved in
"the nonviolent struggle for liberation."
Tutu himself said the prize is much more than
a personal honor. "It acknowledges all those who
have been involved in the liberation struggle for
a new society in South Africa," he said.
Many observers have said Tutu's adamant
stand against apartheid, his acceptance of the
peace prize and his extensive travel abroad,
have placed him in danger.
Tutu supports the creation of a governmental
system in South Africa that would replace apart
heid, which denies political rights to the black
majority. The South African courts have
declared such views to be treasonable and
punishable by prison sentence or death.
The first South African to win the Nobel Peace
Prize, Albert Luthili, was barred by the South

African government from being quoted by the
press. After winning the prize in 1960, the Zulu
chieftain was also prohibited from leaving his
home district.
Tutu has not specifically called for divestment,
the selling of stock in companies with ties to
South Africa. A South African who publicly sup
ports any sanctions against the government can
be punished under South African law. Tutu has
said, however, he will support sanctions if the
system of apartheid is not ended by this spring.
In a July 1985 interview with Newsweek mag
azine, Tutu did not advocate violent measures to
topple the white South African regime but did
express surprise that South African protesters
"continue to accept the likes of us and others
who are still talking about peaceful change."
When asked what kind of workable solution
would satisfy all South Africans, Tutu answered,
"We need a national convention where the au
thentic representatives of every section of South
African society would get together and horse
trade. They would work out the blueprint for
South Africa."
The 55-year-old Tutu was appointed the first
black secretary-general of the interdenomina
tional South African Council of Churches in 1978.
From this post he opposed the apartheid system
of racial separation. In the autumn of 1979, as
secretary-general of the Council of Churches,
Tutu called on the government of Denmark to
cease buying South African coal. When Tutu

returned to South Africa from London his pass
port was confiscated.
In 1975 Tutu left a position with the Theologi
cal Education Fund in England in order to
become the anglican dean of Johannesburg.
From 1976 to 1978 Tutu was also the bishop of
Lesotho, South Africa. As bishop of Lesotho,
Tutu worked with anti-apartheid activist Nhato
Notlana to try to channel violence building up
among South African youths into peaceful
protest against apartheid.
In 1957, when the South African government
introduced bantu education for black students,
Tutu resigned from his teaching position at Mun
sieville High School in Krugersdorp along with
many other high school teachers throughout
South Africa.
Tutu, the recipient of many honorary degrees,
including ones from Harvard and Kent State,
was conferred an honorary doctorate of sacred
theology by Columbia University in August
1982. He sought to attend the awards ceremony
at Columbia but was denied permission to go to
New York to receive the degree.
Tutu has a host of academic credits to his
name. He received a teacher's diploma from
Bantu Normal College in Pretoria, a B.A. from
the University of South Africa in Johannesburg,
and both a bachelor's of divinity and a master's of
theology from King's College, London.
He married Leah Nomalizo Shenxane in 1955,
and has one son and three daughters.
