# King Project Preserves Civil Rights Legacy
## 
### R. TAEZA PIERCE Editorial staff 
On Aug. 28, 1963, at a civil rights march on
Washington, D.C., Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr. first told the world, "I have a dream." The
reverend dedicated and ultimately sacrificed
his life to the realization of that dream.
Twenty-three years later, at Stanford Uni
versity, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers
Project is hard at work preserving the dream
and legacy of the civil rights leader.
Under the editorship of Assoc. History
Prof. Clayborne Carson, the project commit
tee has begun the task of gathering, sorting,
storing on computer, editing and annotating
all of King's personal and professional papers.
Beside Carson, the committee consists of
an administrator, four undergraduate interns,
two undergraduate work-study students,
seven graduate students and a research asso
ciate. In addition, two full-time staff members
work on the project at the Martin Luther
King, Jr. Center for Non-Violent Social
Change, Inc., in Atlanta.
Coretta Scott King, King's widow and
director of the King Center, selected Carson
as senior editor and director of the project in
May. "It's really a full-time job, and I try to
get some teaching in too. I haven't been
teaching undergraduate courses since last

spring," Carson said. He has taught some
graduate courses.
Since May, Carson has spent the bulk of his
time getting the project underway, which he
said involves traveling to look at various li
brary collections, trying to gather papers in
private collections before they are lost and
beginning the actual editorial work. He works
closely with Coretta King and once a month
visits the King Center, which houses the
largest collection of King-related documents.
At this early stage "it's mainly a matter of
acquiring all of the papers. . . . Once we
have acquired all the papers we can find, it's a
matter of selecting those that are most signif
icant and annotating them — putting them in
historical context," Carson said.
The end result will be a 12-volume collec
tion of King's writings. According to Carson,
those documents not selected for publication
will probably be made available to scholars in
another form, such as in microform or optical
text.
Working on the project has been a learning
experience for all involved. Rachel Bagby,
coordinator of the African and Afro-American
Studies Program, has worked with the proj
ect as a research associate since November.
Bagby organized and assembled the King
exhibit on display in Tresidder Union last
week. The audio-visual display included six
hours of tapes of King's speeches and ser

mons, interviews with King, and an interview
with Rosa Parks about her historic refusal to
give up her seat on the bus; photographs; and
copies of some of King's writings.
She is also helping to edit the project's
Manual of Operations — the handbook outlin
ing the goals of the project and how they will
be accomplished.
In the process of selecting speeches, ser
mons, photographs and documents for the
display, Bagby said she learned a great deal
about the movement itself and King's contri
bution to it."I got a real sense of him as a real
person, not as the Rev. Dr. King that we all
know about ... a deeper knowledge of his
personal self."
Bagby said she was impressed with the
enormous commitment King and other
leaders made to the movement. "It became
really clear that he was hardly ever home,
that makes me wonder, 'what was his family
life like?'" Bagby said the experience has
given her "more respect for the effort that
went into that movement," and forced her to
re-evaluate her own commitment to the
black cause.
"How can I be responsible for that? King
and others put their lives into that move
ment," Bagby said. "What am I willing to do,
given the particular social problems we have
now, in some miniscule way, compared to
what King did?"

According to Carson, "The basic impact of
the papers project will be to help
scholars. ... If they have access to more in
formation, then they can convey that informa
tion to the general public.
"King was the symbol of the black
struggle, but he wasn't the entire struggle.
One of the goals of the project is to clarify the
relationship between King and the local
leaders who mobilized black people — to
heighten the appreciation of ordinary people,
black and white, who contributed" to the
movement.
Carson, who described himself as a "foot
soldier" of the civil rights movement, was a
student organizer at UCLA, where he was an
undergraduate in the '60s.
"In many cases the heart of the movement,
especially in the deep South, was poor blacks,
often times without education, for whom the
movement was a life-changing event,"he
said.
As editor of the King papers, Carson hopes
to provide "a resource of verified information
on Dr. King." The 12-volume publication re
sulting from the project will serve as a
documentation not only of King's life and
work, but also on the life of the movement he
fought to further.
Carson said the first volume should be pub
lished within five years, and after that one
volume will come out per year.

work on the project at the Martin Luther
King, Jr. Center for Non-Violent Social
Change, Inc., in Atlanta.
Coretta Scott King, King's widow and
director of the King Center, selected Carson
as senior editor and director of the project in
May. "It's really a full-time job, and I try to
get some teaching in too. I haven't been
teaching undergraduate courses since last

spring," Carson said. He has taught some
graduate courses.
Since May, Carson has spent the bulk of his
time getting the project underway, which he
said involves traveling to look at various li
brary collections, trying to gather papers in
private collections before they are lost and
beginning the actual editorial work. He works
closely with Coretta King and once a month
visits the King Center, which houses the
largest collection of King-related documents.
At this early stage "it's mainly a matter of
acquiring all of the papers. . . . Once we
have acquired all the papers we can find, it's a
matter of selecting those that are most signif
icant and annotating them — putting them in
historical context," Carson said.
The end result will be a 12-volume collec
tion of King's writings. According to Carson,
those documents not selected for publication
will probably be made available to scholars in
another form, such as in microform or optical
text.
Working on the project has been a learning
experience for all involved. Rachel Bagby,
coordinator of the African and Afro-American
Studies Program, has worked with the proj
ect as a research associate since November.
Bagby organized and assembled the King
exhibit on display in Tresidder Union last
week. The audio-visual display included six
hours of tapes of King's speeches and ser

mons, interviews with King, and an interview
with Rosa Parks about her historic refusal to
give up her seat on the bus; photographs; and
copies of some of King's writings.
She is also helping to edit the project's
Manual of Operations — the handbook outlin
ing the goals of the project and how they will
be accomplished.
In the process of selecting speeches, ser
mons, photographs and documents for the
display, Bagby said she learned a great deal
about the movement itself and King's contri
bution to it."I got a real sense of him as a real
person, not as the Rev. Dr. King that we all
know about ... a deeper knowledge of his
personal self."
Bagby said she was impressed with the
enormous commitment King and other
leaders made to the movement. "It became
really clear that he was hardly ever home,
that makes me wonder, 'what was his family
life like?'" Bagby said the experience has
given her "more respect for the effort that
went into that movement," and forced her to
re-evaluate her own commitment to the
black cause.
"How can I be responsible for that? King
and others put their lives into that move
ment," Bagby said. "What am I willing to do,
given the particular social problems we have
now, in some miniscule way, compared to
what King did?"

According to Carson, "The basic impact of
the papers project will be to help
scholars. ... If they have access to more in
formation, then they can convey that informa
tion to the general public.
"King was the symbol of the black
struggle, but he wasn't the entire struggle.
One of the goals of the project is to clarify the
relationship between King and the local
leaders who mobilized black people — to
heighten the appreciation of ordinary people,
black and white, who contributed" to the
movement.
Carson, who described himself as a "foot
soldier" of the civil rights movement, was a
student organizer at UCLA, where he was an
undergraduate in the '60s.
"In many cases the heart of the movement,
especially in the deep South, was poor blacks,
often times without education, for whom the
movement was a life-changing event,"he
said.
As editor of the King papers, Carson hopes
to provide "a resource of verified information
on Dr. King." The 12-volume publication re
sulting from the project will serve as a
documentation not only of King's life and
work, but also on the life of the movement he
fought to further.
Carson said the first volume should be pub
lished within five years, and after that one
volume will come out per year.
On Aug. 28, 1963, at a civil rights march on
Washington, D.C., Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr. first told the world, "I have a dream." The
reverend dedicated and ultimately sacrificed
his life to the realization of that dream.
Twenty-three years later, at Stanford Uni
versity, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers
Project is hard at work preserving the dream
and legacy of the civil rights leader.
Under the editorship of Assoc. History
Prof. Clayborne Carson, the project commit
tee has begun the task of gathering, sorting,
storing on computer, editing and annotating
all of King's personal and professional papers.
Beside Carson, the committee consists of
an administrator, four undergraduate interns,
two undergraduate work-study students,
seven graduate students and a research asso
ciate. In addition, two full-time staff members
work on the project at the Martin Luther
King, Jr. Center for Non-Violent Social
Change, Inc., in Atlanta.
