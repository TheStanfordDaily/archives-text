IRON WILL
The Life and Times of Jane Stanford
Thursday, January 23, 12:30 PM
Iron Will: The Life and Letters of Jane Stanford chronicles the tours de
force, emotions, and convictions of this turn-of-the-century Victorian
millionairess, wife of a California governor and railroad magnate, who
with her husband founded Stanford University, and then after his
death, guided it through its first tumultuous decade.
