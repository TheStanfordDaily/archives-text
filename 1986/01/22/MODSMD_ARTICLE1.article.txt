He received a standing ovation before he had ut
tered a word. And after a 40-minute speech at
Memorial Auditorium last night, the over-capacity
crowd rose again to applaud South African Bishop Des
mond Tutu, while press cameras flashed and hundreds
of students chanted for divestment.
"I would like to give you all a one-man standing ova
tion," returned the 1984 winner of the Nobel Peace
Prize, who spoke as part of the University's annual
Martin Luther King, Jr. celebration.
Tutu, who arrived at Stanford on a flight from Los
Angeles following several speeches, nonetheless ap
peared relaxed and in good spirits as he riveted the
already-won-over audience with his harsh critique of
U.S. dealings with South Africa and his condemnation
of the deplorable condition of South African blacks.
The Bishop of Johannesburg, whose speech was
broadcast live over KZSU and transmitted to closed
circuit television screens in Terman and Skilling
auditoriums, used humorous anecdotes and forceful
rhetoric to convey his determination to end apartheid
in his homeland.
"This country has ... an extraordinary penchant for
backing the wrong horse," Tutu said, referring to the
United States' reluctance to end long-standing eco
nomic ties with South Africa.
Tutu was optimistic about future change, however.
"If you had said in '84 that in '85 (the U.S.) Congress
would be discussing what sort of sanctions to apply

(toward the South African government), I would have
said . . . you need to see a psychiatrist.
"The people of this land decided that enough was
enough," Tutu said, noting that students played a
"very significant" role in forcing the Reagan Adminis
tration to impose the economic sanctions on South
Africa.
"I wouldn't poo-poo degrees and good grades. But
students have said that some things are more impor
tant than how to manage the rat race," Tutu said
amidst cheers from the packed auditorium.
He praised student activists both for defying the
stereotype that they are apathetic and "looking out for
number one" and for the selflessness of their concern.
Tutu contrasted apartheid protests with those involv
ing U.S. actions in Vietnam during past decades, point
ing out that Vietnam protesters were more directly
motivated by self-interest — a fear of getting drafted,
for instance — than are anti-apartheid activists.
"I know I speak on behalf of millions . . . when I say
'thanks,' " Tutu said.
He spoke at length about the South African govern
ment's efforts to make native blacks aliens in their own
country, thus depriving them of individual and political
rights.
"The South African government lets me travel with
a (special) document ... in the space where
nationality is described, mine is described as
'undeterminable at present,' " Tutu said.
"In the land of my birth, I do not vote, because I can
riot vote. . . . This is . . . utterly ridiculous, but it's

"We want a South Africa that is truly just, and it's going to happen. We'd like to be able to say ...
America helped us to become free,'" said Bishop Desmond Tutu to a sellout crowd in Memorial
Auditorium last night.
