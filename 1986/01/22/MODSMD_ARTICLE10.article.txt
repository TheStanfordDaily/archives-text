Speeches by Stanford faculty and stu
dents concerning apartheid in South Africa
and music by the Stanford Gospel Choir
prefaced Bishop Desmond Tutu's appear
ance at Memorial Auditorium last night,
which highlighted Stanford's annual Martin
Luther King, Jr. celebration.
Most speakers drew correlations be
tween the racial inequality in America —
against which King struggled — and the
present situation in South Africa.
"Why does South Africa have this hold
on us?" Political Science Prof. David Aber
nethy asked the crowd of nearly 2,000. "It
reminds us of our own story."
Black Student Union (BSU) President
Steven Phillips called South Africa "the
most rascist regime in the world."

Phillips, a senior, stressed that the
struggle against apartheid does not apply
to all white South Africans.
"It's not black against white (South
Africans)," Phillips said. "It's white
supremists against those opposed."
Law Prof. William Gould stressed the
effectiveness of divestment from South
Africa.
"The South African government under
stands the power of sanctions. That's why
they oppose them," Gould said.
SOSA representative Alice Stauffer
criticized University President Donald
Kennedy's stance against divestment,
charging that "Kennedy claims to know
better than black South Africans (what
they want)."
"(We must remember) we're part of a
nationwide struggle," Stauffer said,
"because if you look at Stanford, it can get
pretty depressing."
