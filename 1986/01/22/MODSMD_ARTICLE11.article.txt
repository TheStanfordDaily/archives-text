Imagine a world free of nuclear weapons by the
year 2000. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
shocked U.S. officials, his own negotiators and the
world-at-large last week by offering just such a pro
posal. His three-phased plan, which provides a con
crete timetable and on-site verification to eliminate
the nuclear arsenal, represents a fresh and con
structive attitude toward world peace.
Likewise, the Reagan Administration's favorable
response is further indication that a safer world is
possible through cooperation and negotiation be
tween the superpowers. President Reagan, who
has unilaterally rejected previous proposals from the
"evil empire," recognized Gorbachev's suggestion
as "different from things we have heard in the past."
Secretary of State George Shultz stated that the
United States is treating the proposal seriously and
looking for its positive aspects.
Perhaps the Administration response would have
been less guarded had Gorbachev proposed his plan
at the bargaining table in Geneva rather than to the
media. Nevertheless, the positive response on both
sides represents a framework from which detailed

negotiations can proceed.
While the vision of a nuclear-free world is Utopian,
the eventual goal of no nuclear weapons is far super
ior to mutually assured destruction. Admittedly,
there are numerous unresolved issues, such as
which weapons to eliminate first, how to insure
other countries eliminate or do not ever develop a
nuclear capability and how to defend central Europe
from overwhelming Soviet conventional forces.
While these crucial issues will have to be addressed,
the monumental achievement remains the funda
mental change in attitude of both the United States
and the Soviet Union.
Gorbachev has taken a courageous stance by
publicly committing himself to the elimination of nu
clear weapons. The real challenge for both sides lies
ahead in transforming these noble ideals into realis
tic reductions through good-faith negotiations. Only
time will tell whether Gorbachev has a far-reaching
vision or is executing a cheap propaganda ploy. We
applaud his initial effort and encourage both Gorba
chev and Reagan to seize this leadership opportu
nity and to help eliminate the threat of nuclear war.
