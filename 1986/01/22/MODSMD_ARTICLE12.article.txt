## Deal With 'Social Responsibility' 
### 
We're all big kids now. Out of
touch with the latest Cracker Jack
prize. Unfamiliar with the new line
of GI Joes. We've got cars, taxes
and The San Francisco Chronicle
now. Po Bronson's column,
however, "Guilt by Association on
the 7F," brought me back to the
days of creamsicles and hopscotch.
Thanks for the nostalgia, Po, but
only a Saturday morning cartoon
can meet the enemy of justice and
have it rendered helpless in one
half hour. You did even better. You
took the admittedly scary "Monster
of Social Responsibility" and had it
begging at your feet in two sen
tences.
I guess what struck me about his
article was the familiar ring. The
issue of social responsibility sends

many people running. Most, like
Bronson, go running to their dic
tionaries for a new, more eloquent
way to skirt the situation. Note the
especially adept sprinting ability of
University President Donald Ken
nedy when confronted with the on
going issue of Stanford's involve
ment in the apartheid system in
South Africa. The curiously defen
sive attitude people get when faced
with circumstances beyond their
little world gives them away,
however. Clearly social responsibil
ity is a relevant value, and it does
have a place in our lives.
The problem is, what are its
parameters? To ask oneself what
kind of duty we have to situations
beyond our immediate selves is to
get into that sticky area of ethics.
Nasty little creatures, these ethics.
They can never be boxed into a nice
little formula and then neatly placed
into a situation for the answer to
emerge, like in calculus class. Un
fortunately, ethics ultimately in
volves that ooey-gooey entity
called empathy. And too many of us
then react as Mr. Bronson did —
overwhelmed by the complexity
and intangibility of empathy, we try
to cope by getting rid of the in
tricacy of the situation. Tying it up
in a neat rhetorical package that in
evitably misses the heart of the
matter, we file it away (under "R,"
for rendered unthreatening). With
ethics nicely packaged into mere
words, making the situations

simplistic and malleable, it becomes
far too easy to do what Mr. Bron
son ultimately did. We can just
"throw that principle (social respon
sibility) out of the window."
I am not sure if Mr. Bronson, and
indeed much of the Stanford admin
istration, realize that some things

VIEWPOINT

cannot be "thrown out of the win
dow." Ethics are not simply
abstract principles. They confront
real human pain and suffering. No
one can simply refile a situation, or
use kryptonite to abolish one princi
ple in favor of another.
Stanford profits from and
propagates the abhorrent system in
South Africa. The fact that we do so

in the subtler fashion of investing in
companies there does not mitigate
that fundamental truth. All the jus
tifications in the world that one
hears time and again from both stu
dents and administration — that
harm is not our intent, or that we
are simply minding our own busi
ness (and money is part of that
business) — fall flat on the face of
the simple, grim reality that there is
massive suffering going on.
The simple fact is that our ac
tions do have far-reaching conse
quences. 1 may be eating a fruit that
was picked by starving migrant
workers, and so in some way I
condone their condition, while your
paper came from the continual rape
of the rain forests. In fact, my life
style was molded by everything
from the sweat of the Chinese on
the U.S. railway system to ancient
battles in Eastern lands. And now
my money rests in South Africa. It
is not something that I am proud of;
it makes me a little nauseous. Thus
the final conclusion, and the only
one I can come to: As Mr. Bronson
admits, but is too cowardly to up
hold, "We are all unethical."
But I refuse to be paralyzed by
this revelation. Instead, it is neces
sary to move on it. I know that I
come into contact with and affect
abominable situations. What should
I do? I can cringe and whimper, as
Mr. Bronson does, and argue that,
since I cannot solve everything, I
shall simply solve nothing. Now it

becomes easy to passively accept
Stanford's investments, ignoring
the ethical dimension. It becomes
acceptable to operate strictly on a
business framework.
Unfortunately, Kennedy still
feels that he needs to shroud the
situation in moral poesy. He should
just get together with Bronson and
find a nifty sounding way to abolish
the concept of social responsility.
After all, with dollars as his priority,
Kennedy will not pull out of South
Africa. He not only loses the invest
ments (which he can presumably
reinvest), but he also loses valuable
monetary alliances like Hewlett
Packard, and all the gifts to the En
gineering Deparment that such an
alliance means.
Finally, to justify all this, I simply
go into semantic mode and make up
a new "principle." All of a sudden a
"distinction should be made be
tween the individual and the com
munities to which that individual
belongs." This will relieve both the
guilt and the complicity. It gets me
off the hook, and I do not have deal
with the the label of "unethical,"
though clearly my actions still have
the same effect.
Instead, we all must face our
complicity with the injustices in the
world. It becomes impossible to
draw a line, or make a file or cate
gory to distinguish between where
one directly affects a situation and
where one just indirectly does.
Being kind of criminal is like being
kind of pregnant. Then, sadly, we
all must face our own personal
limitations in solving the problems.
Mostly we must not decide that the
situation does not exist simply be
cause it inconveniences our con
science.
Stanford can beg no limitations
when dealing with its part in the
oppression in South Africa. It is a
powerful university. Its trus
tees head some of the most
successful companies in the nation.
It wholeheartedly invested in a cor
rupt system, and it can wholeheart
edly get itself out. For those of us
who are still trying to quantify eth
ics, we are wholeheartedly invest
ing in that country. I think that wins
us a place in Bronson's "Directly In
volved" file any day.
I am tired of hearing speeches by
the administration that intend
simply to prove its chastity in rela
tion to the situation, rather than
deal frankly with the situation itself,
and so garnish the circumstances
with intricate and misleading details
(see booklet "Stanford and South
Africa"), and then sum the issue up
in simplistic Bronsonian categories.
The bottom line is that we are in
volved, and we can do something
about the nature of that involve
ment. Therefore, we must. No
more simplistic reasoning and
categorization in a situation that
demands first our empathy, and
second, our action. No more hiding
behind words. But for a kink in fate,
you and I could oppress black South
Africans. Try to simply file that one
away.
