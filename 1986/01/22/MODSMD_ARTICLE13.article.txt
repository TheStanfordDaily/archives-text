Have you heard what's going on in South Yemen
lately? No? South Yemen. Remember? It's a country in
the Middle East bordering Saudi Arabia, Oman and the
other Yemen. Well, if you haven't been reading the
papers lately, that country is currently involved in a
very violent civil war. The Marxist government is
trying its best to defeat communist extremists from
seizing power. The head of the government had been
severely wounded and, as of this writing, the situation
remains "fluid."
To the average American, what happens in South
Yemen has little if any global significance. It does,
however, bring up an interesting point. When was the
last time you woke up in the morning to the sound of a
running gun battle in the streets? For a great many
people in the world, the threat of war or sudden
changes in one's government are everyday fears.

In the United States, people take so much for
granted — like a stable government. In this country we
have a working popular democracy which has served
us very well for more than 200 years. Although it
has many problems, it has served us remarkably well
throughout history.
Yet how many of us take an active role in the affairs
of our nation, or even know about current issues that
directly affect our lives in this country?
For example, a law was recently enacted in
Congress called Gramm-Rudman. The bill was de
signed to balance the federal budget by forcing across
the-board cuts in social services and defense spending
if budget-reduction targets are not met. As a result,
many Stanford students may face large cuts in their
federal student loans. Furthermore, a huge tax bill is
being formulated in Congress that will literally dictate
the way most of us will pay taxes when we graduate. In
the area of defense research, the Strategic Defense
Initiative ("Star Wars") is still a high budget priority
that will cost us billions in wasted resources in the
future. Last, but not least, there remain issues like
capital punishment, gun control and environmental
protection that everyone talks about, but no one writes
to their representatives about.
What do people do about all of these issues? Well, if
you are like the majority of people on this campus, you
talk about it a little and grumble and moan. In the com
fortable isolation of Nirvana that is called Stanford Uni
versity, it is easy to just take classes, study, party and
leave the outside world to those who care about it.

This is a state of mind called apathy.
Do you vote in national elections? Do you write to
your congressman or senators regularly to let them
know how you feel on important issues? Do you even
know who your congressman and senators are? Do you
even take the time to find out what the important is
sues in the United States are?
Most people have done few, if any, of these things.
It is not that they are too busy or don't have opinions
— everybody here has an opinion on everything — it's
just that they don't care.
Here we are in a country designed for the effective
practice of democracy. Yet political apathy reigns.
People complain that their votes don't matter, or that
big corporations or political action committees really
run the government — individual opinions would hie
drowned out in the clamor.
Nothing could be further from the truth. A group of
individuals expressing strong feelings about an issue
can have an incredible effect on the actions of an
elected official. Nothing makes a congressman work
harder or faster than the thought that his constituents
don't like him.
There's an interesting statistic floating around that
says for every letter an elected official gets, there are
about 20 other people who feel the same way but don't
take the time to write. Thus even a couple of coherent
letters can get an official concerned.
So what does South Yemen have to do with this? A
great deal. When you hear about the political troubles
of other nations struggling to maintain their
not to mention a government that lasts more than year,
think about where you live. Most of us are lucky
enough to live in a virtual paradise compared to the
rest of the world. Look around and think of the govern
ment that made it all possible. Keep it strong and func
tioning. Become a part of the political process and keep
it alive.
The most pathetic thing I see everyday are the
people passionately criticizing the policies of the presi
dent, the Democrats or anything else associated with
the government, yet doing little to change the state of
affairs. If you don't like what the federal government is
doing in Nicaragua, or how they treat laboratory
animals, or cutbacks that will soon arrive in the form of
reduced student grants, write to the people who are
responsible to you and let them know how you feel.
Even if nothing changes, at least you will have had the
satisfaction that you tried to influence your own des
tiny.
There is nothing worse than feeling helpless and in
effectual. Use the system that countless people have
died defending, and use it to your advantage. It is only
the participation in our democracy that keeps it strong,
and it is this strength that allows us never to fear the
political violence and bloodshed that plague the rest of
the world.

the way most of us will pay taxes when we graduate. In
the area of defense research, the Strategic Defense
Initiative ("Star Wars") is still a high budget priority
that will cost us billions in wasted resources in the
future. Last, but not least, there remain issues like
capital punishment, gun control and environmental
protection that everyone talks about, but no one writes
to their representatives about.
What do people do about all of these issues? Well, if
you are like the majority of people on this campus, you
talk about it a little and grumble and moan. In the com
fortable isolation of Nirvana that is called Stanford Uni
versity, it is easy to just take classes, study, party and
leave the outside world to those who care about it.

This is a state of mind called apathy.
Do you vote in national elections? Do you write to
your congressman or senators regularly to let them
know how you feel on important issues? Do you even
know who your congressman and senators are? Do you
even take the time to find out what the important is
sues in the United States are?
Most people have done few, if any, of these things.
It is not that they are too busy or don't have opinions
— everybody here has an opinion on everything — it's
just that they don't care.
Here we are in a country designed for the effective
practice of democracy. Yet political apathy reigns.
People complain that their votes don't matter, or that
big corporations or political action committees really
run the government — individual opinions would hie
drowned out in the clamor.
Nothing could be further from the truth. A group of
individuals expressing strong feelings about an issue
can have an incredible effect on the actions of an
elected official. Nothing makes a congressman work
harder or faster than the thought that his constituents
don't like him.
There's an interesting statistic floating around that
says for every letter an elected official gets, there are
about 20 other people who feel the same way but don't
take the time to write. Thus even a couple of coherent
letters can get an official concerned.
So what does South Yemen have to do with this? A
great deal. When you hear about the political troubles
of other nations struggling to maintain their
not to mention a government that lasts more than year,
think about where you live. Most of us are lucky
enough to live in a virtual paradise compared to the
rest of the world. Look around and think of the govern
ment that made it all possible. Keep it strong and func
tioning. Become a part of the political process and keep
it alive.
The most pathetic thing I see everyday are the
people passionately criticizing the policies of the presi
dent, the Democrats or anything else associated with
the government, yet doing little to change the state of
affairs. If you don't like what the federal government is
doing in Nicaragua, or how they treat laboratory
animals, or cutbacks that will soon arrive in the form of
reduced student grants, write to the people who are
responsible to you and let them know how you feel.
Even if nothing changes, at least you will have had the
satisfaction that you tried to influence your own des
tiny.
There is nothing worse than feeling helpless and in
effectual. Use the system that countless people have
died defending, and use it to your advantage. It is only
the participation in our democracy that keeps it strong,
and it is this strength that allows us never to fear the
political violence and bloodshed that plague the rest of
the world.

Have you heard what's going on in South Yemen
lately? No? South Yemen. Remember? It's a country in
the Middle East bordering Saudi Arabia, Oman and the
other Yemen. Well, if you haven't been reading the
papers lately, that country is currently involved in a
very violent civil war. The Marxist government is
trying its best to defeat communist extremists from
seizing power. The head of the government had been
severely wounded and, as of this writing, the situation
remains "fluid."
To the average American, what happens in South
Yemen has little if any global significance. It does,
however, bring up an interesting point. When was the
last time you woke up in the morning to the sound of a
running gun battle in the streets? For a great many
people in the world, the threat of war or sudden
changes in one's government are everyday fears.

In the United States, people take so much for
granted — like a stable government. In this country we
have a working popular democracy which has served
us very well for more than 200 years. Although it
has many problems, it has served us remarkably well
throughout history.
Yet how many of us take an active role in the affairs
of our nation, or even know about current issues that
directly affect our lives in this country?
For example, a law was recently enacted in
Congress called Gramm-Rudman. The bill was de
signed to balance the federal budget by forcing across
the-board cuts in social services and defense spending
if budget-reduction targets are not met. As a result,
many Stanford students may face large cuts in their
federal student loans. Furthermore, a huge tax bill is
being formulated in Congress that will literally dictate
the way most of us will pay taxes when we graduate. In
the area of defense research, the Strategic Defense
Initiative ("Star Wars") is still a high budget priority
that will cost us billions in wasted resources in the
future. Last, but not least, there remain issues like
capital punishment, gun control and environmental
protection that everyone talks about, but no one writes
