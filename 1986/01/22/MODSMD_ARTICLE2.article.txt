# Doctors Demystify AIDS Fears

### ERIC HEALY Staff writer 
"The progress that has been made in
four short years since the disease has
been recognized is reason to be optimistic
about the future," Dr. Peter Drotman
from the AIDS Branch of the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said
last night in Kresge Auditorium.
Drotman was one of several experts on
AIDS research participating in a program
called "An AIDS Overview: Where the
Danger Lies," the first of four programs
addressing the issue of Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome.
Opening the week-long conference,
University President Donald Kennedy
called AIDS "a serious health problem"
that is "the most serious challenge of its
kind in this century."
"We as individuals are not prepared to

deal with the problem of AIDS . . . yet, it
is sure that we will all be affected by it in
one way or another," said Craig Heller,
director of Stanford's human biology pro
gram and moderator of last night's sympo
sium.
Commenting on recent concerns over
the contagious nature of AIDS, Drotman
said, "No cases have beeii reported in
people who have come into contact with
AIDS patients, like housekeepers."
Drotman said a correlation between
AIDS and Kaposi's sarcoma, a very spe
cialized form of cancer was noticed among
gay men in their 30s. Pneumonia,
however, is directly responsible for nearly
all of the deaths due to AIDS. The
pneumonia usually causes death quicker
than any of the other conditions con
tracted by AIDS patients.
Although there have already been about
16,500 reported cases of AIDS nation
wide, Drotman predicted the number will

double within the next 14 months. The
disease is concentrated mainly in large
cities, he said, citing New York City's
4,457 and San Francisco's 1,519 reported
cases since AIDS first came to attention
nearly five years ago.
Edgar Engleman, director of the Stan
ford Blood Bank, spoke on the transmis
sion of AIDS through blood transfusions.
The present method used for determin
ing donor eligibility detects the antibodies
of the AT PS virus as a mearis for deducing
the presence of the actual virus, according
to Engleman.
The major weaknesses of the test lie in
the fact that it detects the antibodies in
stead of the virus itself, it does not predict
symptoms or the ability to infect others
and it occasionally yields false results.
Although other improved tests are
available, Engleman said the present test
