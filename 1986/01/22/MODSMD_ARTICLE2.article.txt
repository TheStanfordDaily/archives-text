# Doctors Demystify AIDS Fears
## 
### ERIC HEALY Staff writer 
"The progress that has been made in
four short years since the disease has
been recognized is reason to be optimistic
about the future," Dr. Peter Drotman
from the AIDS Branch of the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said
last night in Kresge Auditorium.
Drotman was one of several experts on
AIDS research participating in a program
called "An AIDS Overview: Where the
Danger Lies," the first of four programs
addressing the issue of Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome.
Opening the week-long conference,
University President Donald Kennedy
called AIDS "a serious health problem"
that is "the most serious challenge of its
kind in this century."
"We as individuals are not prepared to

deal with the problem of AIDS . . . yet, it
is sure that we will all be affected by it in
one way or another," said Craig Heller,
director of Stanford's human biology pro
gram and moderator of last night's sympo
sium.
Commenting on recent concerns over
the contagious nature of AIDS, Drotman
said, "No cases have beeii reported in
people who have come into contact with
AIDS patients, like housekeepers."
Drotman said a correlation between
AIDS and Kaposi's sarcoma, a very spe
cialized form of cancer was noticed among
gay men in their 30s. Pneumonia,
however, is directly responsible for nearly
all of the deaths due to AIDS. The
pneumonia usually causes death quicker
than any of the other conditions con
tracted by AIDS patients.
Although there have already been about
16,500 reported cases of AIDS nation
wide, Drotman predicted the number will

double within the next 14 months. The
disease is concentrated mainly in large
cities, he said, citing New York City's
4,457 and San Francisco's 1,519 reported
cases since AIDS first came to attention
nearly five years ago.
Edgar Engleman, director of the Stan
ford Blood Bank, spoke on the transmis
sion of AIDS through blood transfusions.
The present method used for determin
ing donor eligibility detects the antibodies
of the AT PS virus as a mearis for deducing
the presence of the actual virus, according
to Engleman.
The major weaknesses of the test lie in
the fact that it detects the antibodies in
stead of the virus itself, it does not predict
symptoms or the ability to infect others
and it occasionally yields false results.
Although other improved tests are
available, Engleman said the present test
"works quite well for this purpose
(of determining donor eligibility).
The nation's blood supply is quite
safe."
Engleman predicted that a test
greatly lessening the number of am
biguous findings will be developed
in the near future, while the ul
timate test for the actual AIDS
virus protein is further away from
realization.
The program finished with an in
formative and entertaining discus
sion of "Safe Sex Practices" by
Prof. Clark Taylor of the Institute
for the Advanced Study of Human
Sexuality.
Citing statistics, Taylor said 50
percent of males have had sex with
other men by the age of 50, while
only 6 to 8 percent of men admit to
being exclusively homosexual.
"We can demand that the media
advertise condoms and sper
macides which when used together
are over 90 percent effective in
preventing the spread of venereal
disease and AIDS. It all begins with
communication," Taylor said.
"This is an era where we have to
cultivate our communication skills
for health's sake," he continued.
Taylor said "the most difficult sit

uation" arises because
"heterosexual prevention of AIDS
(and other sexually transmissable
diseases) is on the lowest burner
and therefore not a high priority.
He claims that people are
dominated by the "it-could-never
happen-to-me" mentality. "We
need to act before it's too late.
Now, we have a tremendous num
ber of people infected who are in
fecting others," Taylor said.
Today's program at 7 p.m. in
Kresge will focus on the legislative
and medical aspects of AIDS.
Tomorrow's discussion, "A Per
sonal Look at AIDS," will feature a
reading of the winning entry in the
human biology essay contest on
AIDS and public policy.
The final program, 7 p.m. Friday
in Annenberg Auditorium, is a
debate on the response of an in
formed society to the issues raised
by the illness.
