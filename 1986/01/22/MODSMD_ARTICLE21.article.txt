## Narcolepsy Research Awakens on Farm 
### NIKO SCHIFF Editorial staff 
As a result of the work of Dr.
John Holloman at the Stanford
Medical Center, there is hope for
the eventual eradication of nar
colepsy — commonly known as the
"sleeping disease."
Holloman heads a project that
aims to elucidate the specific ge
netic basis of narcolepsy. And this
project makes use of the new medi
cal frontier of gene therapy — a
research technique that combines
the use of recombinant DNA in
human treatment.
In the United States alone, ap
proximately 250,000 people are af
flicted with narcolepsy.
Narcolepsy is a disease that
manifests itself in symptoms of ex
cessive daytime sleepiness and
more extreme effects of "sleep at
tacks" involving sleep paralysis or
cataplexy. Sleep paralysis is charac
terized by the inability to move
upon falling asleep or waking from
sleep. Such an attack may last a few
minutes and may occur several
times a day.

Cataplexy involves sudden at
tacks of complete or partial mus
cular paralysis which are triggered
by overstimulation or strong emo
tions.
The research into narcolepsy has
been greatly advanced by basic dis
coveries in immunology, a few of
which have been made at Stanford's
Fairchild Microbiology Facility.
According to Holloman, nar
colepsy has been found to be asso
ciated with the genes that encode
proteins involved in the body's
immune response, especially a cer
tain complex of genes named the
Major Histocompatibility Complex,
MHC, that appears to have been
conserved in evolution over time
and that plays a role in essentially
every immune response.
Holloman explained that
Dr. Hugh McDevitt, professor of
microbiology, was the first person
to examine these certain inherited
proteins found on the cell's surface
that regulate cell response to tissue
rejection and certain types of
disease susceptibility.
MHC is a chromosomal region

that controls the immunological re
jection of transplanted organs and
other non-self tissues in the body.
It has been located on chromosome
six in humans — normal humans
have 23 chromosome pairs.
This region of the chromosome
encodes about 80 genes, many of
which code for proteins found on
the surface of the cell that act upon
foreign substances entering the
body.
The proteins coded by MHC ap
pear to participate in recognition of
non-self tissues and large molecules
by cells called T-cells and antibody
producing white cells and enable
the body to fight off these foreign
invaders.
These cell-surface proteins ap
pear to play a role in calling up the
body's killer cells and generating
antibodies to eliminate all foreign
types of tissue or large molecules.
Identification of these foreign an
tigens activates mechanisms in the
cell that lead to the death of cells
nearby.
"The MHC region controls the
immune response and helps confer
immunity to diseases, but variation
in the MHC region may increase

susceptibility to certain diseases,"
Holloman said.
"Up until a year-and-a-half ago,
the most complete example of a
disease pinned down to a variation
or gene 'allele' in the MHC region
was a disease called AS, Ankylosing
Spodilts, a peculiar arthritis of
the spine found mostly in males,"
he added. "The occurrence of a B
gene called the B-27 gene in the
MHC region and those having the
disease was 95 percent."
However, according to Hol
loman, French researchers looking
into narcolepsy, first found a "loose
concordance" of a narcoleptic group
with MHC variations looking at
three of the four regions of the
MHC region called the A, Band C
regions.
And the Honda research group in
Japan which examined the remain
ing D region found a "stunning"
result, he said.
"They discovered that 100 per
cent of classically defined narcolep
tics had a certain DR2 gene in the
MHC region," Holloman explained.
To find a disease with 100 percent
correlation to a genetic factor
brings high suspicion to DR2 as a
gene that causes or gives suscep
tibility.
The D region of the MHC has
three major subregions called DP,
DQ, and DR, all of which contribute

cell-surface proteins. Two other
sub-regions are of uncertain status
at present. The DR region has
seven common alleles, named DRI
- and seven more uncommon al
leles, DRB-14. It is the DR2 gene
that is associated with narcolepsy.
Holloman's group is seeking to
specify the exact nature of the
gene's role, whether it causes a
structural change in the surface
protein or has a mutation in its DNA
sequence. If there is a change in a
surface protein that protrudes out
of the cell, then it is likely to even
tually be a good candidate for the
newly developing technique of gene
therapy.
Gene therapy is slated to begin
this year, according to Holloman.
He added that there are point
mutations and enzyme-related
diseases that could be treated with
this procedure, which involves sub
stitution of a synthetically
manufactured gene into a human
to act like the healthy gene they
failed to inherit.
According to New Medical Sci
ence (Dec. 1985), "an attempt to
insert genes into human somatic
cells in order to correct a genetic
defect will probably be made in the
United States for the first time
early in 1986."
The first attempts at gene
therapy will be made to replace a

defective enzyme or protein which
is not finely regulated within the
body. Point mutations, singular
defects in the DNA sequence of a
gene and enzyme-related diseases
are good choices for this procedure,
since one gene can be theoretically
replaced to correct the problem.
The specificity of having only one
genetic defect to correct makes
these kinds of problems viable gene
therapy candidates. Enzymes are
large proteins which may be coded
by more than one gene.
"Constitutive" genes will prob
ably be used in the first experi
ments, explained Holloman.
These are genes that are always
turned on to some low level in the
cell. These types of genes will
avoid the problems incurred with
products like hormones that have to
be regulated with pinpoint ac
curacy.
Bone marrow cell deficiencies
are excellent choices since bone
marrow cells are easily cultivated
and worked with in vitro. Other
more complex tissues, such as
brain tissue, will require more
years of research to even consider
applying these techniques, said
Holloman.
An example of a bone marrow
disease is ADA, adenosine
deaminase, a genetically deter
mined version of AIDS, found in

babies. This disease is 100 percent
fatal and is due to a specific defect
in the ADA gene.
A gene therapy treatment for
this disease would involve remov
ing the marrow from a patient, in
serting the normal ADA gene
through gene therapy and re
implanting the marrow into the
body, said Holloman.
This result could be achieved by
inserting an artifically constructed
gene into a specifically engineered
retrovirus. They have long been
known to insert into DNA, he
noted.
Retroviruses are RNA virsuses
that insert themselves into the
DNA helix and incorporate their ge
netic material into the host DNA.
After insertion of the newly en
gineered gene construct into the
bone marrow cells of a patient,
about 60 percent of the
reconstituted cells would carry the
new gene-virus construct, thus it is
plausible to expect reconstitution of
the immune response in the case of
ADA, according to Holloman.
Juvenile diabetes is another
disease that has been shown to be
connected to the MHC region allele
susceptibility, and holds potential
for gene therapy procedures in the
very distant future. Wide-ranging
applications of gene therapy are a
long way off, however. Many

tissue types are not as easily
manipulated as bone marrow, and
this will put gene therapy on the
back burner until their functioning is
specifically worked out.
This is especially true of nar
colepsy, said Holloman. The exact
nature of the genetic factors has yef
to be determined. Using 19
samples of narcoleptics' blood ob
tained from the Stanford Sleep Re
search Center, Holloman's lab
probes to see if narcolepsy is
caused by one or more genes, and
whether the DR2 gene causes
structural changes in surface
proteins.
Holloman said the results of the
DR2 structural variability, if any,
will be in within the next two
months. If narcolepsy is located on
one gene it would stand a good
chance to be a disease treated with
gene therapy in the future, while
the complications of tissue research
and other important factors put this
into at least a 15-20 year time frame
before it is a reality.
Presently there are about five to
10 centers in the country capable of
carrying out these procedures, said
Holloman. The effect of gene
therapy will eventually be a "new
era of disease management, ulti
mately altering the course of medi
cal treatment."
