## Narcolepsy Research Awakens on Farm 
### NIKO SCHIFF Editorial staff 
As a result of the work of Dr.
John Holloman at the Stanford
Medical Center, there is hope for
the eventual eradication of nar
colepsy — commonly known as the
"sleeping disease."
Holloman heads a project that
aims to elucidate the specific ge
netic basis of narcolepsy. And this
project makes use of the new medi
cal frontier of gene therapy — a
research technique that combines
the use of recombinant DNA in
human treatment.
In the United States alone, ap
proximately 250,000 people are af
flicted with narcolepsy.
Narcolepsy is a disease that
manifests itself in symptoms of ex
cessive daytime sleepiness and
more extreme effects of "sleep at
tacks" involving sleep paralysis or
cataplexy. Sleep paralysis is charac
terized by the inability to move
upon falling asleep or waking from
sleep. Such an attack may last a few
minutes and may occur several
times a day.

Cataplexy involves sudden at
tacks of complete or partial mus
cular paralysis which are triggered
by overstimulation or strong emo
tions.
The research into narcolepsy has
been greatly advanced by basic dis
coveries in immunology, a few of
which have been made at Stanford's
Fairchild Microbiology Facility.
According to Holloman, nar
colepsy has been found to be asso
ciated with the genes that encode
proteins involved in the body's
immune response, especially a cer
tain complex of genes named the
Major Histocompatibility Complex,
MHC, that appears to have been
conserved in evolution over time
and that plays a role in essentially
every immune response.
Holloman explained that
Dr. Hugh McDevitt, professor of
microbiology, was the first person
to examine these certain inherited
proteins found on the cell's surface
that regulate cell response to tissue
rejection and certain types of
disease susceptibility.
MHC is a chromosomal region
