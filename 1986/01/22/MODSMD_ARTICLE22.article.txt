## Of Davies' Mythic Canada 
### JENNIFER HILL 
"What's Bred In The Bone"
Robertson Davies
Viking, New York, 1986
"What's bred in the bone will not out of the
flesh" is the epigraph to and the refrain of Rober
son Davies' most recent novel. It is "what's bred
in the bone" of the wealthy, eccentric art collec
tor and art expert Francis Cornish (recently
deceased) that the Canadian novelist Davies at
tempts to explore in his fictional biography.
It is apparent that to Davies, the inevitable ef
fect of Canada's uncertain national identity on
Canadians and their culture is a favorite theme.
In 'What's Bred in the Bone," Cornish is as
much a product of Canada as he is of his own
eclectic personal activity. The cultural mixture in
Canada is seen in Cornish's background; his
mother is the daughter of a Catholic-Scottish and
French-Canadian logging magnate, and his father
is a Protestant second son of British nobility.
Cornish's hometown of Blairlogie, called a
"jumping-off' point, is a charming mix of reality
and fantasy. Blairlogie does not actually exist —
cannot exist — yet, somehow, the place does
exist in Canada's psyche. Davies writes of the
townspeople: "Below the Scots, in a ranking that
was decreed by money, came a large population
of French descent, some of whom were substan
tial merchants. At the bottom of the financial and
social heap were the Poles, a body of laborers
and small farmers from which the upper ranks
drew their domestic servants." The Blairlogie
years are perhaps the best in the book, as
Davies makes the town of "5,000 carefully differ
entiated souls" very real.
Differentiation poses the problem that the
Rev. Simon Darcourt, a family friend and would
be biographer of Cornish, must wrestle with in
the novel's beginning. Darcourt's attempt to
write a biography is thwarted by the real lack of
detail in Cornish's effects. There are hints of for
gery, spying and homosexuality in "Uncle

Frank's" past, as well as more apparent ec
centricities, such as a well-documented refusal
to bathe. Cornish is ultimately demystified by
the careful records of a recording angel — Les
ser Zadkiel — and the commentary of Cornish's
deamon, Maimas.
Davies' description of Cornish's childhood is
quirky and engaging. Cornish emerges as a
young man who is deeply influenced by his
encounters with various midwestern
grotesques. His parents' influence (or lack of in
fluence) on him is due to their distance from him;
his real role models include an aunt whose hair
was torn out in her childhood by a great horned
owl and Zadok Hoyle, a family servant who
doubles as an embalmer. Cornish's appreciation

for art is due to Mary-Ben (the aunt) but his first
artistic dabbling occurs when he accompanies
Zaok to the funeral parlor.
The pace of the book slows a little when Cor
nish leaves Blairlogie for Colborne College
(devoted Davies fans will delight at the appear
ance of Dunstan Rammsey, described by the
schoolbody Cornish as a "severe Scottish face
with beetling brows and an extraordinary amount
of hair growing out of its nose") and the world
beyond.
In demystifying Cornish's life of apparent con
tradictions — a boy from the "jumping-off place"
who rises to international fame as an art expert,
the artist who is also a spy — Davies attempts to
explain Canada's position as "America's attic"

(the title of a book of Da vies' essays), a country
with a national inferiority complex and very little
that is not borrowed from other cultures.
Cornish is affected very deeply by his lack of
real "groundedness," especially when, as a stu
dent at Oxford, he finds himself unable to ex
press himself artistically in any contemporary
form and goes back to the styles of the Old
Masters instead. His mentor, a slightly demonic
art restorer named Tancred Saraceni counsels
him, "Don't try to fake the modern manner if it
isn't right for you. Find your legend. Find your
personal myth." This, incidentally, is Davies'
message to Canada: the country, like Cornish,
cannot divorce itself from European roots, so it
better adapt to them.
Davies' style draws heavily on European tradi
tion; he is a specialist on Victorian literature, and
his prose certainly has some Victorian elements
in it.
Those who are familiar with Davies' "The
Deptford Trilogy" will not be surprised at the in
clusion of myth — as well as Jungian principles,
astrology and mysticism — in "What's Bred in
the Bone." Cornish's mastery (artistic and
otherwise) depends upon his successful
encounter with his Shadow (a mysterious pres
ence at the family mansion) and the various
women in his life who influence him directly,
both physically and psychologically (as animal
representations). Cornish's' life takes him
around Europe, seeking, confronting, but never
quite finding the completeness he desires. Sar
ceni says, "Half-Catholics cannot be great ar
tists; one needs passion and conviction
combined. Cornish's greatest achievements and
real individuation take place at a point near the
middle of his life, and the rest of the novel is a
simpler description of a complacent and happy
man. The pace of the novel falls off markedly,
and we are disappointed because we want to
know more, but there is no more to tell. Cornish
and Canada are too old to be young, and too
young to have fully matured. The man and the
mystery of his life only begin to explain Canada,
artistic inheritance, individuation and intellect.
