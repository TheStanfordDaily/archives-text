"On Becoming A Biologist"
Jon Janvoy, Jr.
Harper and Row, New York,
1985
Janvoy, a well-read biologist
who teaches at the University of
Nebraska, has written a useful
introduction to the biological
sciences for both the pre-med
and the layman. His "On Becom
ing A Biologist" is really two
books woven together; one book
describes his own values and
lifestyle, and the other doles out
advice for those interested in bi
ology.
In this respect, Janvoy's book
is comparable to "The Youngest
Science" by Lewis Thomas; it
stresses the role of the person
involved in the scientific en
deavor, rather than concentrat
ing on a description of the sci
ence itself. At a time when many
undergraduates are pursuing
courses in the biological sciences
for the sole purpose of fulfilling
pre-med requirements, Janvoy
airs the option of studying biol
ogy for biology's sake — with
the aim of the development of
one's human potential.
A valuable section of this book
discusses the trials of biological
research. The reader gets a
taste of the frustrations of doing
experiments, the difficulties in

volved in writing and publishing
and the problem of acquiring
funds to do research. Most of the
examples in this part of the book
are derived from Janvoy's per
sonal experience, but this does
not mean they are limited in
scope.
The book begins and ends
with chapters that focus on the
philosophy of the biologist rather
than the practical aspects of the
biologist's work. Heady ques
tions such as "Why do people
study biology?" and "What are
the social responsibilities of the
biologist?" are considered. As a
naturalist, Janvoy argues that all
biologists must be naturalists at
heart.
In the final chapter of the
book, entitled
"Responsibilities," Janvoy
outlines his views of the respon
sibilities of biologists to society.
In a dogmatic tone, he argues
that society is in many respects
analogous to a complex biological
system.
Though Janvoy's prose occa
sionally suffers from pretension,
the book does offer some good
insights into the method and
practice of biology. Of course, it
does not describe what biology is
— that's left to classes and
textbooks. If you've got enough
interest in the field to read
beyond Janvoy's slim volume,
the book will give you a good
overview.
