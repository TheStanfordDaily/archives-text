# 'Small Business': Man Vs. Upward Mobility

### DAVID BARBER 
"Small Business"
Tom Parker
Norton, New York, 1986
Murphy is obsolete. Now we
have Fassler's law. Not only will
anything go wrong that possibly
can, but it will shatter with all the
vengeance and fury of a Biblical
decree.
Martin Fassler's improbable
woes occupy this lively first novel
by former- Stanford Stegner Fellow
Tom Parker. Boldly picaresque and
provincial, "Small Business"
chronicles a calamitous month in
the life and work of a textbook
specimen of '80s success and
mercilessly lampoons a host of
California-brand maniacs and
paranoias. Slapstick as his travails
become, hapless and feckless as he
is, Fassler's tale is saved from
mere farce by the sure marksman
ship of the satire.
Lord knows poor Fassler tries
his best. As the lesser half of
Blair/Fassler Inc., a San Francisco
media production company on the
rise, he must balance slippery ac
counts and maintain some measure
of order in an officefui of temper
mental artists. A thankless task,
perhaps, but he's willing to console
himself with all the conspicuosly
reassuring trappings a hip young
businessman might need: turbo
sports sedan, posh tennis club, ex
clusive townhouse and a wall of
ghoulish African masks, which even
as he speaks are appreciating at a
fantastic rate. Besides, the com
pany's vital signs have never been
better. The mammoth Consolidated
Wines, won over by Fassler's inter
minable hustle and jive, has just
shelled out half a million for
Blair/Fassler to produce its annual

sales meeting.
But senior partner and resident
eccentric genius Ed Blair never did
have a flair for the reasonable or the
predictable. Inspired sleaze has
gotten him to where he is today.
There was that colossal, riotous
light show in the early '60s, for in
stance, spanning the entire Marin
County. And there was the
monumentous first meeting with
Fassler himself at a downtown
wine-tasting, where a practiced
Blair was smoothly uncorking
bottles of far pricier years. And
now, on the brink of the greatest
triumph yet for their plucky busi
ness, Blair jumps ship. Apologizing
vaguely for an emotional difficulty,
he shrugs and vanishes, and the
rest of the staff disappears as if on
cue. The reins are Fassler's.
Our hero is plagued by domestic
miseries, too. Firm and sensible
Joyce won't marry him. Popsie is
entrusting his feeble heart to Palm
Springs golf and Fassler's shrewish
stepmother. At home, Keystone
Kop building inspectors are detect
ing grim violations in every pipe and
wire. At the club, flabby and aging
Rosenthal is thrashing him with
diabolical ease on the courts.
Therapists tell us that the line
between business and life often
blurs perilously. Novelist Parker is
apparently no stranger to the Mach
iavellian inner sanctums of the
corporate world, and Fassler's or
deal bristles with darkly comic
verisimilitude. As time grows short
and failures snowball, Fassler races
fervidly through the city attending
to each fresh personal and profes
sional crisis with ineptitude. The
obvious solution is paranoia; Fas
sler unsurprisingly proves to be a
master.
He suspects conspiracy,
sabotage, insidious plots, every
conceivable body and object playing

its part in the mayhem. Rabid
tenacity keeps Fassler from going
under entirely. He tackles the es
teemed Consolidated Wines project
on his own — writing copy, shoot
ing film and coordinating
streamlined production equipment
in torrid burlesque. He implores
Joyce to tie the knot and exhorts
Popsie to come clean. Against bet
ter judgment, one almost wants to
cheer him on. Eventually, he fer
rets out the news that Blair has
absconded to Florence, where he
and his charges are finishing pro

duction on the cryptic "Italy
presentation." Packing nothing so
much as a toothbrush, the
beleagured Fassler seizes Joyce
and hops a jet in pursuit.
Is it all a conspiracy? Can
Blair/Fassler survive? Will Fassler
get Joyce to the alter and deduce
the mytery of Rosenthal? "Small
Business" leaves no thread un
raveled in the end, but the satisfac
tion is uneven. The problem is that
the novel's chaos is generated on
too many levels, by too many
motives, to the point where multi

plying subplots begin to compete
like unruly siblings for the reader's
attention. Fassler's checkered
romantic career and traumatic
childhood, and his madcap efforts to
resolve them, seem gratuitous and
unconvincing beside the vivid ac
counts of his type-A tightwire acts
in the business arena. Parker's
surest gift is for scenarios freighted
with plausible absurdity; his
dextrous irony is just the weapon to
carve up the handshaking and infin
ite hype that oil our engines of com
merce. With a little more ambition

and a little more focus, the novel
might have exposed the boardroom
as a bastion of sanctioned insanity,
akin to Joseph Heller's army in
"Catch 22." The talent and venom
are there.
We are light years away from
Dashiell Hammet's San Francisco,
where a cool and calculating Sam
Spade could see his way through
the most pernicious fix. Parker's
promising debut is best read as a
cautionary fable about the peril
faced by today's upwardly mobile;
once success bats an eye their way. •

duction on the cryptic "Italy
presentation." Packing nothing so
much as a toothbrush, the
beleagured Fassler seizes Joyce
and hops a jet in pursuit.
Is it all a conspiracy? Can
Blair/Fassler survive? Will Fassler
get Joyce to the alter and deduce
the mytery of Rosenthal? "Small
Business" leaves no thread un
raveled in the end, but the satisfac
tion is uneven. The problem is that
the novel's chaos is generated on
too many levels, by too many
motives, to the point where multi

plying subplots begin to compete
like unruly siblings for the reader's
attention. Fassler's checkered
romantic career and traumatic
childhood, and his madcap efforts to
resolve them, seem gratuitous and
unconvincing beside the vivid ac
counts of his type-A tightwire acts
in the business arena. Parker's
surest gift is for scenarios freighted
with plausible absurdity; his
dextrous irony is just the weapon to
carve up the handshaking and infin
ite hype that oil our engines of com
merce. With a little more ambition

and a little more focus, the novel
might have exposed the boardroom
as a bastion of sanctioned insanity,
akin to Joseph Heller's army in
"Catch 22." The talent and venom
are there.
We are light years away from
Dashiell Hammet's San Francisco,
where a cool and calculating Sam
Spade could see his way through
the most pernicious fix. Parker's
promising debut is best read as a
cautionary fable about the peril
faced by today's upwardly mobile;
once success bats an eye their way. •

"Small Business"
Tom Parker
Norton, New York, 1986
Murphy is obsolete. Now we
have Fassler's law. Not only will
anything go wrong that possibly
can, but it will shatter with all the
vengeance and fury of a Biblical
decree.
Martin Fassler's improbable
woes occupy this lively first novel
by former- Stanford Stegner Fellow
Tom Parker. Boldly picaresque and
provincial, "Small Business"
chronicles a calamitous month in
the life and work of a textbook
specimen of '80s success and
mercilessly lampoons a host of
California-brand maniacs and
paranoias. Slapstick as his travails
become, hapless and feckless as he
is, Fassler's tale is saved from
mere farce by the sure marksman
ship of the satire.
Lord knows poor Fassler tries
his best. As the lesser half of
Blair/Fassler Inc., a San Francisco
media production company on the
rise, he must balance slippery ac
counts and maintain some measure
of order in an officefui of temper
mental artists. A thankless task,
perhaps, but he's willing to console
himself with all the conspicuosly
reassuring trappings a hip young
businessman might need: turbo
sports sedan, posh tennis club, ex
clusive townhouse and a wall of
ghoulish African masks, which even
as he speaks are appreciating at a
fantastic rate. Besides, the com
pany's vital signs have never been
better. The mammoth Consolidated
Wines, won over by Fassler's inter
minable hustle and jive, has just
shelled out half a million for
Blair/Fassler to produce its annual

sales meeting.
But senior partner and resident
eccentric genius Ed Blair never did
have a flair for the reasonable or the
predictable. Inspired sleaze has
gotten him to where he is today.
There was that colossal, riotous
light show in the early '60s, for in
stance, spanning the entire Marin
County. And there was the
monumentous first meeting with
Fassler himself at a downtown
wine-tasting, where a practiced
Blair was smoothly uncorking
bottles of far pricier years. And
now, on the brink of the greatest
triumph yet for their plucky busi
ness, Blair jumps ship. Apologizing
vaguely for an emotional difficulty,
he shrugs and vanishes, and the
rest of the staff disappears as if on
cue. The reins are Fassler's.
Our hero is plagued by domestic
miseries, too. Firm and sensible
Joyce won't marry him. Popsie is
entrusting his feeble heart to Palm
Springs golf and Fassler's shrewish
stepmother. At home, Keystone
Kop building inspectors are detect
ing grim violations in every pipe and
wire. At the club, flabby and aging
Rosenthal is thrashing him with
diabolical ease on the courts.
Therapists tell us that the line
between business and life often
blurs perilously. Novelist Parker is
apparently no stranger to the Mach
iavellian inner sanctums of the
corporate world, and Fassler's or
deal bristles with darkly comic
verisimilitude. As time grows short
and failures snowball, Fassler races
fervidly through the city attending
to each fresh personal and profes
sional crisis with ineptitude. The
obvious solution is paranoia; Fas
sler unsurprisingly proves to be a
master.
He suspects conspiracy,
sabotage, insidious plots, every
conceivable body and object playing

its part in the mayhem. Rabid
tenacity keeps Fassler from going
under entirely. He tackles the es
teemed Consolidated Wines project
on his own — writing copy, shoot
ing film and coordinating
streamlined production equipment
in torrid burlesque. He implores
Joyce to tie the knot and exhorts
Popsie to come clean. Against bet
ter judgment, one almost wants to
cheer him on. Eventually, he fer
rets out the news that Blair has
absconded to Florence, where he
and his charges are finishing pro

duction on the cryptic "Italy
presentation." Packing nothing so
much as a toothbrush, the
beleagured Fassler seizes Joyce
and hops a jet in pursuit.
