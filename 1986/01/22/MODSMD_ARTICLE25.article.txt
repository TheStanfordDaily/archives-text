## Bears Seen Better By 11 in Big One 
### 
After being subjected to "wide-open, ex
citing, offensive football" for the past few
years, it's good to see a couple of teams in
the Super Bowl who got there the old
fashioned way — with great defense and a
solid running game.
; The Chicago Bears and the New England
Patriots took different roads to the top, but
used the same method. Some would call it
boring, and if you like watching San Diego
and Miami try to score 100 points between
them, you'd be right.
; But there's something incredible about

the way the Bears defeated the New York
Giants 21-0 in the divisional playoffs. It was
boring, but it was still gripping. The last
time a defense played a game verging on
perfection like that escapes memory.
The Patriots have taken a different ap
proach — forcing enough turnovers to pull
out three playoff wins on the road. But they
too rely on the defense to force those turn
overs, and the running of Craig James and
crew to punch it in.
The Bears have been expected all year
to get to New Orleans. Some people are

rooting for them to lose, seeing them as the
overwhelming favorite, the Goliath to the
Patriots' David.
Others hold their sometimes inter

minable boasting against them — a person
ality flaw manifested in the presumptuous
recording of "The Super Bowl Shuffle" a
month before actually getting there. They
don't like a quarterback like Jim McMahon
who has been a rebel ever since he
slammed his first beer on the Brigham
Young campus as a collegiate quarterback.
And they certainly don't like a defensive
tackle like William Perry who runs and
catches and is the hottest advertising craze
since Clara Peller.
vou root against a city that

hasn't seen a championship team since
1963? We're talking about a town that
shows up in force to root for a baseball
team that hasn't won a World Series since
1908. Face it, if the Bears lose Sunday, the
line to jump off the Sears Tower will stretch
halfway to Wisconsin.
And besides, how can you root against
the greatest running back in the history of
the NFL, Walter Payton, in his first Super
Bowl? You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch.
