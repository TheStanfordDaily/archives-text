# Little in Life Throws Dorst
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Staff writer 
Chris Dorst led the 1977 Stan
ford water polo team to an NCAA
championship, played on two Olym
pic teams and at one time was con
sidered the top goalie in the world.
But he may have missed his true
calling.

â€¢ "He does the best Elvis Presley
imitation I've ever seen," Olympic
teammate and 1982 Stanford
graduate Jody Campbell said. "He

just does an unbelievable Elvis. At
my wedding he did three or four
Elvis songs. He brought the house
down."
The music world's loss has been
water polo's gain, though, as Dorst
gradually improved over the years
from being a third-team Ail-
American as a senior at Menlo-
Atherton High School, to the MVP
of the 1977 NCAA Championships
and a member of the silver-medal
winning team in the 1984 Olympics.
For Dorst the decision of where
to attend school was not an easy
one.
"It was Berkeley or Stanford,"
Dorst said. "Both my parents went
to Berkeley. They had a better
team and offered me a scholarship.
(But) there was just an aura about it
(Stanford) that Berkeley couldn't
touch.
"I was probably 75 percent com
mitted to Berkeley when I got ad
mitted to Stanford. I never really
thought I'd be that good. It just
really worked out well."
As a freshman, Dorst played on
the Cardinal junior varsity team.
The next year Coach Art Lambert
arrived from DeAnza Junior Col
lege, and Dorst blossomed under
the new leader's direction.
"Lambert's far and away the best
coach I've ever played with," Dorst
said. "He taught us what you have
to do to win. He was an absolute
perfectionist. He would scream
some of the most dehumanizing,

disgusting things you could scream
at a person."
The demanding Lambert, whom
Dorst compared to Bobby Knight,
also brought goalie Frank Forencich
with him from DeAnza.
"He (Forencich) was pretty
good," Dorst said. "It challenged
me."
Dorst and Forencich split playing
time in goal as sophomores and
juniors, although as a junior "I
started all the NCAA games, which
was kind of a turning point," Dorst
said.

Forencich quit water polo before
his senior year, and Dorst became
the team's undisputed starter in
goal.
"Art was concerned with every
facet of the game," Dorst said. "My
senior year I had one guy (Asst.
Coach Mike MacNaMa) who was
watching me all the time. Having
someone there and just giving you
that constant feedback was just tre
mendous for me."
Dorst's improvement mirrored
that of the entire Stanford team
which went from sixth, to fourth

and finally first in the country during
his last three years.
"It was fabulous," Dorst said of
the 1977 NCAA championship. "It
was real satisfying for a number of
reasons. Number one, Stanford had
never done anything in water polo;
number two, it was a real vindica
tion for Art Lambert and his coach
ing methods; thirdly we were all
such good friends."
After graduating from Stanford
with a 3.5 average in history in
1977, Dorst formed a company
called Stanford Solar Systems with

a friend and began training for the
Olympics.
"It gave me a chance to train, as
well as to get a chance for going
through that entrepreneurial exper
ience everyone raves about," Dorst
said of his business. "We sold the
company in May of 1979, and actu
ally didn't lose as much as we
should have."
Dorst soon moved to Southern
California to be with the national
team in its preparation for the


Chris Dortz
"The best Elvis Presley
imitation. . "

"I'm proudest of making the 1984 team as much as anything in
my career, save the NCAA championship," Dorst says.
