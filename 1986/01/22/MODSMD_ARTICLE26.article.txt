# Little in Life Throws Dorst
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Staff writer 
Chris Dorst led the 1977 Stan
ford water polo team to an NCAA
championship, played on two Olym
pic teams and at one time was con
sidered the top goalie in the world.
But he may have missed his true
calling.

• "He does the best Elvis Presley
imitation I've ever seen," Olympic
teammate and 1982 Stanford
graduate Jody Campbell said. "He

just does an unbelievable Elvis. At
my wedding he did three or four
Elvis songs. He brought the house
down."
The music world's loss has been
water polo's gain, though, as Dorst
gradually improved over the years
from being a third-team Ail-
American as a senior at Menlo-
Atherton High School, to the MVP
of the 1977 NCAA Championships
and a member of the silver-medal
winning team in the 1984 Olympics.
For Dorst the decision of where
to attend school was not an easy
one.
"It was Berkeley or Stanford,"
Dorst said. "Both my parents went
to Berkeley. They had a better
team and offered me a scholarship.
(But) there was just an aura about it
(Stanford) that Berkeley couldn't
touch.
"I was probably 75 percent com
mitted to Berkeley when I got ad
mitted to Stanford. I never really
thought I'd be that good. It just
really worked out well."
As a freshman, Dorst played on
the Cardinal junior varsity team.
The next year Coach Art Lambert
arrived from DeAnza Junior Col
lege, and Dorst blossomed under
the new leader's direction.
"Lambert's far and away the best
coach I've ever played with," Dorst
said. "He taught us what you have
to do to win. He was an absolute
perfectionist. He would scream
some of the most dehumanizing,

disgusting things you could scream
at a person."
The demanding Lambert, whom
Dorst compared to Bobby Knight,
also brought goalie Frank Forencich
with him from DeAnza.
"He (Forencich) was pretty
good," Dorst said. "It challenged
me."
Dorst and Forencich split playing
time in goal as sophomores and
juniors, although as a junior "I
started all the NCAA games, which
was kind of a turning point," Dorst
said.

Forencich quit water polo before
his senior year, and Dorst became
the team's undisputed starter in
goal.
"Art was concerned with every
facet of the game," Dorst said. "My
senior year I had one guy (Asst.
Coach Mike MacNaMa) who was
watching me all the time. Having
someone there and just giving you
that constant feedback was just tre
mendous for me."
Dorst's improvement mirrored
that of the entire Stanford team
which went from sixth, to fourth

and finally first in the country during
his last three years.
"It was fabulous," Dorst said of
the 1977 NCAA championship. "It
was real satisfying for a number of
reasons. Number one, Stanford had
never done anything in water polo;
number two, it was a real vindica
tion for Art Lambert and his coach
ing methods; thirdly we were all
such good friends."
After graduating from Stanford
with a 3.5 average in history in
1977, Dorst formed a company
called Stanford Solar Systems with

a friend and began training for the
Olympics.
"It gave me a chance to train, as
well as to get a chance for going
through that entrepreneurial exper
ience everyone raves about," Dorst
said of his business. "We sold the
company in May of 1979, and actu
ally didn't lose as much as we
should have."
Dorst soon moved to Southern
California to be with the national
team in its preparation for the

my career, save the NCAA championship," Dorst says.
Olympics, but then disaster in the
form of the boycott struck.
"More than anything it was ex
tremely frustrating," Dorst said of
President Carter's decision to with
hold the U.S. team from the Mos
cow games. "It was a stupid deci
sion, a real fundamental error in
judgment. Needless to say, I didn't
vote for him in 1980."
With his Olympic dream shat
tered, Dorst returned to the aca
demic world and the Stanford Busi
ness School.
"(Business school) was another
fabulous expeiience," Dorst said.
"It's tough to go from being the

best in the world at what you do to
being just mediocre, although we
had a great intramural water polo
team."
After earning an MBA in 1982,
Dorst re-entered the business
world with Atari, this time, he
thought, for good.
"When I went to business school,
I said 'that's it, I'm done with water
polo,' " Dorst said.
The lure of the pool was too
much for him, though, and he was
soon back in the pool and training
for the 1984 Olympics. Dorst went
from being the national team's No.
4 goalie to backup netminder and
one of the two on the Olympic team
by the summer of 1984.
"After two years it was tough to
come back," he said. "I've never

been in so much pain. It was a tre
mendous physical challenge and a
mental challenge as well. I think I'm
proudest of making the 1984 team
as much as anything in my career,
save the NCAA championship."
Dorst's Olympic dream had come
true after a four-year delay.
"Anytime you reach that dream,
it never meets expectations, but
this exceeded it,"he said of the
Olympics. "The most incredible
memory was playing for a gold
medal. Opening ceremonies could
be the most emotionally moving
thing of my life. It was phenomenal.
"We walked through the tunnel
(of the Olympic arena), and it was
deafening. I didn't see anybody not
standing up. We were the focal
point of this incredible national

pride. It was just this fever of emo
tion."
Although they tied the final game
against Yugoslavia and ended up
with a silver medal on the basis of
goals scored, Dorst and his
teammates had still finished higher
than any other U. S. Olympic water
polo team ever.
Now Dorst is officially retired
from water polo and is applying the
same qualities that made him a
standout goalie to his marketing
consultant's job with Regis
McKenna.
"He was pretty much a student
of the game," Dorst's Stanford and
Olympic teammate Drew McDonald
said. "He played his position really
intelligently. He was able to get up
for big games."

"If you want something hard
enough and work hard enough, it
will come to you," Dorst said. "I
wouldn't have been able to make
the 1984 team on talent. The work
ethic is not trite; it's true."
Now Dorst makes his home in
what he called a "dive" apartment in
Palo Alto with several other bach
elors including football player Matt
Soderlund.
For Dorst the combination of
knowledge, talent and a Puritan
work ethic has led to success both
in and out of the pool.
"He's been not only a teammate
but also a very close friend,"
McDonald said. "He's committed to
his friends the way he is to his ath
letics. He always gives his best."

Chris Dorst led the 1977 Stan
ford water polo team to an NCAA
championship, played on two Olym
pic teams and at one time was con
sidered the top goalie in the world.
But he may have missed his true
calling.

• "He does the best Elvis Presley
imitation I've ever seen," Olympic
teammate and 1982 Stanford
graduate Jody Campbell said. "He

just does an unbelievable Elvis. At
my wedding he did three or four
Elvis songs. He brought the house
down."
The music world's loss has been
water polo's gain, though, as Dorst
gradually improved over the years
from being a third-team Ail-
American as a senior at Menlo-
Atherton High School, to the MVP
of the 1977 NCAA Championships
and a member of the silver-medal
winning team in the 1984 Olympics.
For Dorst the decision of where
to attend school was not an easy
one.
"It was Berkeley or Stanford,"
Dorst said. "Both my parents went
to Berkeley. They had a better
team and offered me a scholarship.
(But) there was just an aura about it
(Stanford) that Berkeley couldn't
touch.
"I was probably 75 percent com
mitted to Berkeley when I got ad
mitted to Stanford. I never really
thought I'd be that good. It just
really worked out well."
As a freshman, Dorst played on
the Cardinal junior varsity team.
The next year Coach Art Lambert
arrived from DeAnza Junior Col
lege, and Dorst blossomed under
the new leader's direction.
"Lambert's far and away the best
coach I've ever played with," Dorst
said. "He taught us what you have
to do to win. He was an absolute
perfectionist. He would scream
some of the most dehumanizing,

disgusting things you could scream
at a person."
The demanding Lambert, whom
Dorst compared to Bobby Knight,
also brought goalie Frank Forencich
with him from DeAnza.
"He (Forencich) was pretty
good," Dorst said. "It challenged
me."
Dorst and Forencich split playing
time in goal as sophomores and
juniors, although as a junior "I
started all the NCAA games, which
was kind of a turning point," Dorst
said.

Forencich quit water polo before
his senior year, and Dorst became
the team's undisputed starter in
goal.
"Art was concerned with every
facet of the game," Dorst said. "My
senior year I had one guy (Asst.
Coach Mike MacNaMa) who was
watching me all the time. Having
someone there and just giving you
that constant feedback was just tre
mendous for me."
Dorst's improvement mirrored
that of the entire Stanford team
which went from sixth, to fourth

and finally first in the country during
his last three years.
"It was fabulous," Dorst said of
the 1977 NCAA championship. "It
was real satisfying for a number of
reasons. Number one, Stanford had
never done anything in water polo;
number two, it was a real vindica
tion for Art Lambert and his coach
ing methods; thirdly we were all
such good friends."
After graduating from Stanford
with a 3.5 average in history in
1977, Dorst formed a company
called Stanford Solar Systems with

a friend and began training for the
Olympics.
"It gave me a chance to train, as
well as to get a chance for going
through that entrepreneurial exper
ience everyone raves about," Dorst
said of his business. "We sold the
company in May of 1979, and actu
ally didn't lose as much as we
should have."
Dorst soon moved to Southern
California to be with the national
team in its preparation for the

Olympics, but then disaster in the
form of the boycott struck.
"More than anything it was ex
tremely frustrating," Dorst said of
President Carter's decision to with
hold the U.S. team from the Mos
cow games. "It was a stupid deci
sion, a real fundamental error in
judgment. Needless to say, I didn't
vote for him in 1980."
With his Olympic dream shat
tered, Dorst returned to the aca
demic world and the Stanford Busi
ness School.
"(Business school) was another
fabulous expeiience," Dorst said.
"It's tough to go from being the

best in the world at what you do to
being just mediocre, although we
had a great intramural water polo
team."
After earning an MBA in 1982,
Dorst re-entered the business
world with Atari, this time, he
thought, for good.
"When I went to business school,
I said 'that's it, I'm done with water
polo,' " Dorst said.
The lure of the pool was too
much for him, though, and he was
soon back in the pool and training
for the 1984 Olympics. Dorst went
from being the national team's No.
4 goalie to backup netminder and
one of the two on the Olympic team
by the summer of 1984.
"After two years it was tough to
come back," he said. "I've never

been in so much pain. It was a tre
mendous physical challenge and a
mental challenge as well. I think I'm
proudest of making the 1984 team
as much as anything in my career,
save the NCAA championship."
Dorst's Olympic dream had come
true after a four-year delay.
"Anytime you reach that dream,
it never meets expectations, but
this exceeded it,"he said of the
Olympics. "The most incredible
memory was playing for a gold
medal. Opening ceremonies could
be the most emotionally moving
thing of my life. It was phenomenal.
"We walked through the tunnel
(of the Olympic arena), and it was
deafening. I didn't see anybody not
standing up. We were the focal
point of this incredible national

pride. It was just this fever of emo
tion."
Although they tied the final game
against Yugoslavia and ended up
with a silver medal on the basis of
goals scored, Dorst and his
teammates had still finished higher
than any other U. S. Olympic water
polo team ever.
Now Dorst is officially retired
from water polo and is applying the
same qualities that made him a
standout goalie to his marketing
consultant's job with Regis
McKenna.
"He was pretty much a student
of the game," Dorst's Stanford and
Olympic teammate Drew McDonald
said. "He played his position really
intelligently. He was able to get up
for big games."

"If you want something hard
enough and work hard enough, it
will come to you," Dorst said. "I
wouldn't have been able to make
the 1984 team on talent. The work
ethic is not trite; it's true."
Now Dorst makes his home in
what he called a "dive" apartment in
Palo Alto with several other bach
elors including football player Matt
Soderlund.
For Dorst the combination of
knowledge, talent and a Puritan
work ethic has led to success both
in and out of the pool.

but also a very close friend,"
McDonald said. "He's committed to
