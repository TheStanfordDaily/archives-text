* Women's Rugby
The women's rugby team opened its league play
with a shutout victory over Sonoma State Saturday.
Tromping through ankle-deep mud at the visitor's
field, the Cardinal jumped out to a quick 6-0 lead on
; two placekicks by Andi Wolpert. Then, just before
the end of the first half, rookie Lucy Carleton took
the ball on the right wing, ran past her defender and
scored the first try of the game.
Kicking dominated the second half as both teams
tried to gain the advantage with a slippery ball. Stan
ford spent most of its time inside of Sonoma's 25-
yard line but was kept out of the try zone by a stub
born defense.
Finally, with only a few minutes left in the game,
forward Kate Wade emerged with the ball from a
melee in the center of the field. Wade passed the
ball to a sprinting Melanie Domres, who faked the
remaining defender. That left rookie Mary Chung all
alone in the corner for the try. It turned out to be
the last score of the game, as the Cardinal went on
to win by a score of 14-0.
The ruggers will host their next league game on
Saturday against the Bay Area She Hawks at
Maloney Field.
Lacrosse
Although last Saturday's big event was the
Stanford-Cal basketball game, hundreds of en
thusiasts of another kind came out to the Stanford
athletic fields to watch another sport being played.
A lacrosse mini-tournament was held all day Satur
day and included the Stanford men's lacrosse squad
along with other local colleges and clubs.
The Cardinal, the No. 1 team in Northern Califor
nia a year ago, played Saturday as though it was
ready to dominate once again this year. Stanford
rebounded from a 9-2 early morning loss to the
highly regarded San Francisco Lacrosse Club to
later beat the Marin Club, considered one of the
best in the state. Stanford tallied up a 6-4 halftime
lead while rotating a number of starters in the
lineup. In the second half, all the remaining players
had a chance to see action, many on the B-team for
the first time in their lacrosse careers.
Team co-captain and first-line mitty John Cox,
who scored the first goal for the Cardinal against
San Francisco, was enthusiastic after the game
about the team's performance. "I think we really
looked good," he said. "Most of last year's players
have returned, and we also have a great crop of
freshmen who are ready to contribute. The two
games were good preparation for next week's
road trip."
The men's lacrosse squad opens its home
schedule Feb. 1 against Cal-Poly San Luis Obispo.

Ice Hockey
In action last weekend, the Stanford ice hockey
team skated to a split of a two-game homestand.
In a penalty-ridden game on Saturday the Cardinal
dominated the Reno Broncos to win by a final score
of 6-2. Stanford forward John Zierk's hot stick
netted a hat trick for the Cardinal while Pat Dobson,
Dave Yu and Scott Tilley each picked up solo goals
in the convincing victory. Goalie Bill Levine played
an outstanding game in the net as well.
Stanford ran up against tougher opposition Sun
day night, though, as it fell to UC-Berkeley, also
by a score of 6-2, before an enthusiastic home
crowd.
The Cardinal's Mike Sabina tied the match at one
in the first period, but the Bears then scored five un
answered goals before defenseman Bob Mulroy
could tip in a goal off a rebound late in the third.
"We just keep beating ourselves," said Stanford
forward Scott Bommer of the mid-game lapse.
Skiing
Many students rushed to Lake Tahoe this
weekend, but for Stanford's Alpine and Nordic ski
teams, the race didn't end with the road trip.
Freshman Shelley St. Laurent won Sunday's giant
slalom competition at Soda Springs, leading the
Women's A-Team to its fifth NCSA victory this
season. Co-captain Liz. Atkinson and senior Mardi
Dier placed third and fifth, respectively, to help beat
the seven other Northern California schools. Strong
finishes by veterans Alex Weiher and Aimee Berg
helped reveal the team's depth â€” despite the
snow's lack of it.
Also competing in the giant slalom, the Stanford
men finished third overall behind Sierra College and
Berkeley. Top-seeded sophomore Tim Nolan was
especially geared for this race, both mentally and
physically. Wearing only swimming apparel, long un
derwear and a scarf, he barely took seventh place.
Brad "Morning Hair" Swett, Chip "Chard" Haz
ard, Griff "Franz" Steiner and sophomore Lane
Hornung placed a tight 10th, 12th, 17th and 20th,
respectively.
In the Nordic events, comprised of a relay and a
distance race, the Stanford women placed third and
the men fifth, overall.
Representing the Cardinal at the Squaw Valley
meet were sophomores Joy Farmer, Alice Peters,
Claudia D'Andrea and senior Kim Hughes.
Finishing for the men were Bob Boutin, Nathan
Martin and Brian Tsang.
This weekend, the men's and women's alpine
teams will be back in action at Soda Springs. The
Nordic race will be held at Boreal Ridge.
