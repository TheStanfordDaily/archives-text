### LISA MARTINEZ Staff writer 
After a weekend of fencing against Midwestern
schools in Chicago, Stanford's men's and women's
teams returned Sunday with some satisfying victories
under their belts.
The women overwhelmed their competition by a
cumulative score of 58-12; the men weren't quite as
dominant but did outscore their opponents 102-48.
The Cardinal women had an outstanding weekend at
Chicago University as they took on the best of the Big
Ten in five matchups on Friday and Saturday.
The women felled 13th ranked Northwestern Friday
night, beating the Wildcats 12-4. "Northwestern was
surprisingly scrappy," Coach Buzz Hurst said. "They
had a good strong team, but we put them away."
On Saturday morning, the Stanford women came up
against the University of Minnesota, beating them 14-
2. After Minnesota came Lawrence University, which
Stanford beat 16-0.
Next was the University of Chicago, which fell with
out an apparent fight, 16-0. "Chicago is a pretty strong
team," Hurst said, "but they are about where we were
eight years ago."
Saturday afternoon the Cardinal women were faced
with their greatest confrontation of the tournament as
they came up against the University of Wisconsin.
"Wisconsin was the big challenge we were looking
towards," Hurst said. "They knocked us out of the
NCAA upper bracket two years ago, and now they
have an even stronger team."
The Cardinal kept its composure to defeat the
Badgers 10-6. "We knocked them out decisively,"
Hurst said. "We were ahead from the start. The
women never really relinquished the lead and they
never lost control."

Hurst was impressed with the performances of
some individual team members. Captain Jennifer Yu
remained undefeated at 20-0; Alison Reid, the No. 2
fencer, finished with a cumulative mark of 18-2; and
Holly Taylor, the No. 3 performer, compiled a 19-1
total.
"This the finest performance from the Stanford
women's team that I have ever seen," Hurst said.
"There's no question that we are the defending Big
Ten champs. We are probably also the best in the Mid
west."
The Stanford men defeated their Big Ten opponents
5-1 in the Chicago tournament this weekend in what
Hurst felt was a less-than-satisfying overall perfor
mance.
The Cardinal came up against Northwestern on
Friday night and defeated its varsity team in a close 16-
11 match. "We started out flat," said Hurst, "but we
pulled out through an outstanding performance by the
epee team, as they chalked up a 6-3 victory."
The next morning the men got off to a poor start as
they succumbed to the University of Illinois 17-10. "No
one did a very outstanding job," said Hurst. "We
needed top performances out of our top people, and we
didn't get them. Nevertheless, the sabre team fenced
very well in this bout with a score of 6-3."
According to Stanford's coach, "The University of
Minnesota paid the price for our loss to Illinois." The
Cardinal fencers rebounded with a 24-2 drubbing of the
Golden Gophers.
The Cardinal continued its winning ways, defeating
the University of Lawrence 25-1 and the University of
Chicago 23-4. "It was really a 'no sweat' operation,"
Hurst said.
In the final match of the tournament, the Stanford
fencers challenged the country's llth-ranked team,
the University. of Wisconsin, and defeated them in a
close 14-13 match.
