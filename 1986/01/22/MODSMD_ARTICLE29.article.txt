# Golden Bears Dunk Card

### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
BERKELEY â€” The two most
recent Stanford-Cal basketball con
frontations have yielded the same
basic story line: Cal owns second
half; beats Stanford.
Saturday the Cardinal men saw a
six-point lead at the intermission
disintegrate into a six-point Bear
victory.
Last night at Harmon Gym, in
front of a noisy crowd and a bois
terous Cal Band, the Stanford

women's basketball team also fell
prey to a second-half Bear
onslaught. This time California
turned a tight, 32-31 score at the
half into a 77-59 rout.
A fast-paced transition game
helped Cal (8-7) snap its two-game
losing streak.
"When we ran the counterattack
in the first half, we felt like they
were getting tired," Bear forward
Chris Metzger said. "So we thought
we could get an advantage in the
second half by pushing the ball up
the floor and keeping them off the
boards."

While Cal fast-breaks kept Stan
ford's defense unbalanced, a slight
defensive adjustment at the half left
Stanford's offense in disarray.
"I told Jennifer (six-foot-three
forward Bennet) to collapse a
couple of steps into the middle,"
Cal Coach Gooch Foster said. This
strategy forced the Cardinal to take
lower percentage, outside shots.
"We then tried to put more pres
sure on their outside shooters by
spreading out the rest of our zone
(defense)," Foster said. "If we
added a couple of feet to their
outside shots, they would miss
more."
The Cardinal missed often,
making only 12-of-35 shots en route
to a 28-point second half. Mean
while, the Bears couldn't miss.
Metzger was a pefect 6-for-6
from the field to lead Cal's barrage
of outside shots. She finished with a
game-high 20 points, as did Stan
ford center Jill Yanke.
"Coach Foster told us to spread
out our offense more and be ready
to take the shot," Metzger said.
"Just being more aware made us
shoot better."
Moreover, the Bears were
nearly perfect from the free throw
line; they hit 15-of-16 shots from
the foul line in the second half.
Stanford returns home hoping
the friendly confines of Maples
Pavilion help the team regroup.
The women host UCLA Friday
night at 7:30.
