# Chili Peppers Played for Loss
## 
### TRACY FURUTANI 
Friday night's Memorial Auditorium
concert by the Red Hot Chili Peppers lost
approximately $5,000, according to pre
liminary figures supplied by Concert Net
work Director Partick O'Hara.
Included in the loss is about $1,700 in
damage to the auditorium caused by a
rowdy crowd, according to Bruce Krern
petz, Memorial Auditorium's stage
manager. The damage included a
destroyed barrier around the orchestra pit
and a torn curtain that was draped over
the barrier.
Despite the damage, Krempetz, the

police and concert organizers all felt that
security for the show was adequate. All
did concur, however, that Memorial
Auditorium is not an appropriate venue for
rock concerts.
Most of the loss was due to poor atten
dance. According to preliminary figures
from the Tresidder Ticket Office, which
handled all ticket sales, there were 454
paid admissions, of which 209 were Stan
ford students.
Both the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the
opening band, The Uptones, charged be
tween $1,500 and $5,000, according to
O'Hara, while production costs for a show
in Memorial Auditorium range "anywhere

from $3,000 to $12,000." Another $1,000
to $2,000 was spent on advertising, he
said. O'Hara refused to give more precise
figures.
"We expected to lose money," said
Suzanne Becker, adviser to the Concert
Network and program coordinator at
Tresidder Union, adding that a $1,000
loss would not have been surprising. "The
Frost (Ampitheater) shows end up sub
sidizing the Mem Aud shows," she
remarked.
O'Hara would not speculate on what the
loss will mean for the Concert Network's
