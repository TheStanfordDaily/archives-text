# Chili Peppers Played for Loss

### TRACY FURUTANI 
Friday night's Memorial Auditorium
concert by the Red Hot Chili Peppers lost
approximately $5,000, according to pre
liminary figures supplied by Concert Net
work Director Partick O'Hara.
Included in the loss is about $1,700 in
damage to the auditorium caused by a
rowdy crowd, according to Bruce Krern
petz, Memorial Auditorium's stage
manager. The damage included a
destroyed barrier around the orchestra pit
and a torn curtain that was draped over
the barrier.
Despite the damage, Krempetz, the

police and concert organizers all felt that
security for the show was adequate. All
did concur, however, that Memorial
Auditorium is not an appropriate venue for
rock concerts.
Most of the loss was due to poor atten
dance. According to preliminary figures
from the Tresidder Ticket Office, which
handled all ticket sales, there were 454
paid admissions, of which 209 were Stan
ford students.
Both the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the
opening band, The Uptones, charged be
tween $1,500 and $5,000, according to
O'Hara, while production costs for a show
in Memorial Auditorium range "anywhere

from $3,000 to $12,000." Another $1,000
to $2,000 was spent on advertising, he
said. O'Hara refused to give more precise
figures.
"We expected to lose money," said
Suzanne Becker, adviser to the Concert
Network and program coordinator at
Tresidder Union, adding that a $1,000
loss would not have been surprising. "The
Frost (Ampitheater) shows end up sub
sidizing the Mem Aud shows," she
remarked.
O'Hara would not speculate on what the
loss will mean for the Concert Network's
future until after a Friday meeting
of the Concert Network Board of
Directors.
Friday night's headliners, the
Red Hot Chili Peppers, are consid
ered to be an "up and coming
group," said O'Hara, and tend to
have a lewd act. "Most Stanford
students go for the name (of the
band)," he continued, and given the
Peppers' lack of name recognition,
the Concert Network expected less
than a capacity crowd.
O'Hara was "disappointed that
there weren't more Stanford stu
dents there," but attributed the
poor showing to the three-day
weekend. "My RA said he would
have gone to the show if he hadn't
been away."
The Memorial Auditorium
damage, according to Krempetz,
was concentrated in the stage area.
"We should have set up a more
sturdy barrier or else taken it out,"
said Tim Self, staff supervisor for
the Concert Network. "We ex
pected people to stand up and move
around," but not as soon as they
did, he said. "I think it had to do
with the age of the audience."
"We put 15 people in the space
between the wall and the

(orchestra) pit," said O'Hara,
"They physically pushed the wall
(back toward the audience) to keep
them out of the pit." He stated that
the crowd was, on the whole,
"cooperative" and followed the in
structions of the security people to
stay away from the demolished bar
rier.
"We were fortunate in that there
was a small turnout," said Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington,
adding that the crowd was a
"difficult group to handle."
Nonetheless, the general con
sensus was that security for the
show was adequate.
Forty-two people were hired for
security, according to Self.
"Basically, we pretty much went
with (the Stanford police) plan," he
said, adding that the only medical
problem occurred before the con
cert
"The problem wasn't the organi
zation (of the concert)," said Her
rington. "The problem was that the
facility wasn't very good for that
kind of event."
"Jazz and comedy are more the
kinds of shows which should be in
Mem Aud," said Becker.
O'Hara agreed: "What remains to
be seen is the future of rock in Mem
Aud."
