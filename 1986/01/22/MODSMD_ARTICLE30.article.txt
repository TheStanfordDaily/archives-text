Foreigners Trapped in S. Yemen
DJIBOUTI — Fighting continued yesterday between rival Marxist
factions in the South Yemen capital of Aden, thwarting several at
tempts by British ships to evacuate hundreds of foreigners trapped
without water or electricity, according to reports reaching Djibouti.
An appeal for help, radioed to Djibouti by a United Nations official
in Aden, said there was an urgent need to rescue foreigners still
trapped in the capital because their supplies of food and bottled water
would last only two more days.
U.N. sources who received the message Monday night quoted the
official as saying that heavy fighting was continuing in the city and
that electricity, water and telephone lines had all been cut. He indi
cated that the French embassy had apparently been hit by shell or
rocket fire and that there were several casualties, the sources
added.
The nine days of fighting between forces loyal to President Ali
Nasser Hasani and those supporting a loose coalition of hard-line
Marxists trying to topple him is believed to have claimed thousands
of lives so far. Arab press reports have spoken of as many as 14,000
dead, although the figure cannot be verified. Communications with
South Yemen are severed, and the military and political situation
there remains "highly confused," a Western diplomat said.
The diplomat said the fighting in Aden itself seems "to have run
into a stalemate, with each side holding on to a section of the city and
shelling the other."
The fighting between rival factions of the army, navy, air force and
political party militias appeared to be concentrated in Aden and the
area to either side of it.
Marcos' Election Rules Rebuked
WASHINGTON — In a mild rebuke to the government of
Philippine President Marcos, the State Department said yesterday
that Manila's decision to restrict foreign observers of the Feb. 7
presidential election was not desirable.
At the same time, department spokesman Bernard Kalb refused
to say whether arrangements for the election were adequate to
assure a fair outcome — a key concern of the United States.
In a related story, amid charges that Democrats in Congress are
meddling in next month's election in the Philippines, a House sub
committee heard testimony yesterday that First Lady Imelda Marcos
secretly owns a $19 million mansion on Long Island.
Rep. Stephen Solarz (D-N.Y.) chairman of the House subcommit
tee on Asian and Pacific affairs, said the Marcos family owns proper
ties in the United States valued at more than $350 million. He
promised to use future hearings to expose the "complex web" of
companies used to conceal these investments.
But Rep. Toby Roth (R-Wis.) argued that none of the documents
produced by witnesses and the committee staff proved conclusively
that Mrs. Marcos owned the Long Island estate. He charged Solarz
with trying to use the hearings to help defeat Mrs. Marcos' husband
in the Feb. 7 special presidential election.
Meanwhile in Manila, Marcos yesterday appeared to back away
from an earlier pledge to retire the armed forces chief of staff, Gen
eral Fabian Ver, before next month's presidential election.
In an appearance before a businessmen's organization, Marcos
cited "factionalism" in the Philippine armed forces as a reason for re
taining Ver, despite U.S. objections that he was an obstacle to ur
gently needed reforms in the military.
Following a year-long leave of absence, Ver, 66, a supporter and
cousin of the president, was re-instated by Marcos as chief of staff
last month when he was acquitted of charges of being an accessory
to the 1983 assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino, Jr.
China Eases Foreign Investment
PEKING — Chinese authorities announced yesterday that they
plan to make it easier for foreign companies to take profits out of
China and, in some instances, to sell more goods in the potentially
huge domestic market.
The move is aimed at attracting still-hesitant overseas investors.
During the past six years, about 1,800 foreign companies have begun
joint ventures with Chinese enterprises, investing a total of $2.8 bil
lion, according to Chinese estimates. The main sources of that
money are Hong Kong and the United States.
But many of those companies have been operating under severe
legal handicaps. The most important are restrictions on the ability of
foreign companies to convert their earnings in China into foreign cur
rency that can be sent out of the country.
In an interview that appeared yesterday in The China Daily, a
government-controlled publication, a leading government economist
detailed a series of new measures on foreign currency that will be
adopted later this week by the State Council, China's version of a
presidential cabinet. All the changes are aimed at helping foreign
companies find ways of converting earnings into foreign exchange
that can be taken out of China.
"The currency problem is probably the greatest constraint on in
vestment in China," said Chris Brown, a Peking-based representa
tive of the National Council for U.S.-China trade. "There's no ques
tion this is a very important policy decision, long awaited. It sounds
really good, but we have to see how the policy is implemented."
As part of the new lure for foreign investors, the government is
also holding out the prospect that it will ease limits on the ability of
joint ventures to sell their products in China.
Four Killed in South Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Two white South African
policemen were beaten and stabbed to death yesterday when they
tried to break up a political meeting by more than 500 black miners
southwest of here, a police spokesman in Pretoria reported.
The rioting gold miners then seized the two officers' shotguns and
pistols and used them on police reinforcements during a short gun
battle. Two blacks were also killed.
The two policemen were the first white constables to die in 17
months of sustained civil unrest here, and their deaths seemed likely
to intensify the anger among South African whites who are coming
increasingly under attack.
The officers, members of the regional riot squad, apparently were
surrounded when they arrived late yesterday afternoon to disperse
the meeting of miners and residents from Bekkersdal, a black
township about 20 miles southwest of Johannesburg, called to dis
cuss local grievances and work out a plan of protest action.
Before reinforcements could arrive, the two policemen were at
tacked with war clubs, machetes and knives and killed, according to a
spokesman at police headquarters in Pretoria. The blacks then fired
on the reinforcements with the dead officers' weapons before they
fled into Bekkersdal. The policemen's mutilated bodies were found
near their heavily damaged vehicle.
