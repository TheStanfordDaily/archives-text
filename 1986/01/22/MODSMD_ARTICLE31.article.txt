# Car Bomb Blast Kills 27 in Beirut
## Officials say bomb apparently aimed at Phalange Party office 
### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon — At least 27 people were
killed and more than 100 were wounded yester
day when a powerful car bomb exploded in a
Christian neighborhood of East Beirut.
The massive explosion set fire to a seven
story office building, blew in the fronts of dozens
of shops on the busy commercial street and
crushed 20 cars like broken toys.
A police bomb expert said the Mercedes Benz
250 used in the explosion contained about 550
pounds of plastic explosive. The car was also
filled with gasoline cans and oxygen cylinders to
create a fireball after the initial blast.
No group claimed responsibility for setting the
bomb, but officials said it appeared to be aimed at
a local office of President Amin Gemayel's
Phalange Party. The office, in a second-floor
apartment, was next to the building where the

car bomb went off. The Furn al-Shubbak area is
also home to Elie Karameh, the leader of the
Phalange Party.
At least half of those killed were trapped in
burning cars after the bomb went off. Most of the
injured were hit by flying glass, which covered
the street for blocks in the neighborhood, a
prosperous Christian enclave.
The explosion dug a neat, car-shaped crater
six feet deep in front of the office building.
"I was standing in my shop helping a cus
tomer," said one shopkeeper. "The next thing I
heard this explosion and I was in the back room
lying down."
It appeared likely that the bombing was an
other consequence of last week's bloody uprising
against Elie Hobeika, who was head of the prin

cipal Christian militia, which is known as the
Lebanese Forces.
Between 300 and 450 persons were killed last
week in violent clashes between Hobeika's fol
lowers and partisans of Samir Geagea, the
Lebanese Forces chief of staff, who teamed up
with militiamen loyal to Gemayel to oust
Hobeika.
The 28-year-old Hobeika fled to Paris but is
reported to be on his way to Damascus.
The uprising in the Christian community
deeply angered Syria, which had painstakingly
negotiated a peace settlement for Lebanon. A
peace pact was signed Dec. 28 by Hobeika and
the leaders of the two primary Moslem militias,
but last week's rebellion appears to have left the
agreement in tatters.
