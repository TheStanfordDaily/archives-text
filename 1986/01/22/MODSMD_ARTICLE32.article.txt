# Free Fall in Oil Prices May Continue
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The free fall
in oil prices pulled American crude
oil below $20 a barrel for the first
time on commodity markets yester
day, triggering a selling wave of
stocks on Wall Street by investors
worried about the impact of lower
prices on the energy and banking
industries.
But the price for the benchmark
grade of American oil stabilized
above the $20 mark at the end of a
record day of trading. Analysts said
that while the plunge in crude oil
prices this year may have slowed
temporarily, the likelihood is for
continued declines.
The Dow Jones Industrial
Average fell 14.68 points to

1,514.45 yesterday as the volatility
in oil prices spilled over into stock
markets. The selling was heaviest
in oil and oil-related issues, such as
the stocks of major bank holding
companies, whose loans to Third
World oil producers could be further
endangered by the falling prices.
"People have become concerned
with owning bank stocks and other
issues that might be exposed to
lower oil prices," said Thomas
Ryan, of Kidder Peabody & Co.
Peter Beutel, an analyst with
Rudolf Wolff Futures Inc., said
buyers appeared once the price fell
below $20 a barrel for West Texas
Intermediate crude, a grade traded
on the New York Mercantile Ex

change that is closely watched as a
guide to prices in this country.
"The fact that we settled above it
($2O) is significant," said Beutel,
whose firm is a commodity broker.
The price of a barrel of West Texas
Intermediate, for delivery next
month, fell from $21:30 Monday to
$19.85 yesterday, before moving
upward to $20.55 at the end of
trading on the mercantile exchange.
That is the lowest point since the
beginning of oil futures trading on
the exchange in March 1983.
"We're experiencing a relative
free fall (in oil prices), whether it's
on the spot (cash) or futures
markets," said Sanford Margoshes,
an analyst with Shearson Lehman

Bros. "We're seeing an absence of
buyers compared to the sellers.
The buyers are taking a wait-and
see attitude, since we're going into
relatively uncharted waters.
There's almost a curiosity to see
how far (down) they will go.
"I don't think there are any psy
chological support levels" under the
price of oil, said Margoshes. "My
own guess is that ... we may see
something like $15 a barrel," before
prices head upward.
The fundamental force driving
prices down is the continuing over
supply of crude oil on world
markets, resulting from Saudia
Arabia's decision in the fall to boost
its production dramatically.
