War Victims Win Suit
WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court
yesterday reversed a lower court and allowed
Japanese-Americans interned during World
War II to sue for as much as $24 billion in da
mages.
A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
overruled District Judge Louis Oberdorfer,
who held in 1984 that the federal statute of
limitations barred the Japanese-Americans
from making any claims against the govern
ment after six years. The panel voted 2-1 to
reverse the old ruling.
Judge Skelly Wright, who wrote the decision
for the panel, declared the statutory limit irrel
evant. The government has conceded in other
cases, Wright said, that the Justice Depart
ment concealed evidence showing that the
confinement of all Japanese-Americans in the
Pacific Coast states was not necessary to
preserve the national security.
"Extraordinary injustice can provoke ex
traordinary acts of concealment," Wright said.
"Where such concealment is alleged, it ill be
hooves the government of a free people to
evade an honest accounting."
Bank of America Fined
Bank of America yesterday was fined a
record $4.75 million for failing to report
thousands of large cash transactions as re
quired by federal law.
The Treasury Department said that the na
tion's largest bank had committed 17,000 vio
lations of the Bank Secrecy Act, a tool used to
battle the laundering of cash used in drug
smuggling and other illegal activities. The law
requires financial institutions to report all cash
dealings of more than $10,000 to the Internal
Revenue Service.
The bad news came on the same day that
Bank of America reported a $337 million loss
for 1985, the second-largest annual loss in

U.S. banking history and Bank of America's
first yearly deficit since the Depression. The
figure reflects massive loan losses in
agriculture, real estate, energy and Third
World countries.
In addition, the bank suspended payment of
the 20-cents-a-share dividend on common
stock, which had been reduced from 38 cents
a-share just five months ago. The move is a
blow to tens of thousands of small sharehold
ers who depend upon Bank of America
dividends for living expenses.
Spending Debate
WASHINGTON — President Reagan and
congressional leaders yesterday staked out
sharply conflicting positions on taxes and gov
ernment spending as the 99th Congress recon
vened for what is expected to be a tumultuous
election-year second session.
Picking up where they left off last year, con
gressional leaders of each party sharply ques
tioned the president's plans to again propose
deep cuts in domestic spending, protect
defense spending and avoid a tax increase.
Reagan stood his ground, setting in motion a
debate similar to the one that dominated the
first session.
There was general agreement among Re
publican and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill
that a budget compromise linked to tax in
creases will be impossible without active sup
port from the White House.
But at a meeting with GOP leaders at the
White House, Reagan drew the line against tax
increases for next fiscal year and said defense
spending increases are essential to progress in
arms control negotiations with the Soviet
Union. Meanwhile, White House Budget
Director James Miller 111 told congressional
leaders yesterday that more than half the defi
cit reduction Reagan will propose for fiscal
1987 will represent recycled proposals that
Congress rejected last year, and about 40 per
cent will be such new ideas as selling govern
ment property and loans.

But congressional leaders insisted that
Reagan, if his spending cuts are to win ap
proval this year, must drop his opposition to a
tax increase. Senate Budget Committee Chair
man Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) told reporters
that higher taxes are needed to "glue the pack
age together" and reach deficit-reduction tar
gets spelled out by recently enacted balanced
budget legislation.
Some in Congress have predicted that
Reagan's budget, which he will formally submit
next month, will be "dead on arrival" in
Congress, particularly if he presses for cuts
that Congress has previously rejected. But
Miller has argued that Congress will be more
inclined to accept the proposals this year,
when it faces the constraints of the new
Gramm-Rudman law, which mandates a
balanced budget by 1991.
Mafia Boss Guilty
WASHINGTON — Five reputed Midwes
tern mob leaders, including Chicago's acting
Mafia boss, were convicted yesterday of skim
ming almost $2 million from a string of
Teamster-financed casinos in Las Vegas.
A U.S. District Court jury in Kansas City
returned verdicts of guilty on each of eight
counts after a four-month trial that produced
striking evidence of organized crime's once
pervasive influence over the Teamsters'
central states pension fund, and its continuing
control over top Teamsters officials.
Those convicted were Joseph "Doves"
Aiuppa, 78, whom the government has des
cribed as the acting boss of Chicago's "Outfit";
his underboss, John Cerone, 71; two of their
top captains, Angelo LaPietra, 65, and Joseph
Lombardo, 57, and Milton "Maishe" Rockman,
73, reputed financier of the Cleveland Mafia
and its liaison with the Teamsters.
They face five years in prison and $10,000
fines on each count, one of conspiracy and
seven of using facilities in interstate commerce
to exert their secret control over the casinos.
