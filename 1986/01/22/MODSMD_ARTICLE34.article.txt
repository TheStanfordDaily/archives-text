S.F. May Divest
SAN FRANCISCO — City supervisors yes
terday approved an anti-apartheid ordinance
that would ban the city from doing business
with companies with ties to South Africa.
Exemptions would be permitted in cases
where the city would end up spending signifi
cantly more money for goods and services.
The proposed ordinance — which protests
the South African policy of enforced segrega
tion or apartheid — faces one more vote for
final approval. Yesterday's vote was unani
mous.

The supervisors gave the approval despite a
letter from Mayor Dianne Feinstein that urged
them to reject an earlier amendment that
would prohibit the city from buying goods
made by firms with South Africa links.
1 he mayor said the amendment was so
broad it would "significantly increase delays in
processing purchase orders and require addi
tional staffing" for the purchasing department.

LOS ANGELES — Heavy metal singer
songwriter Ozzy Osbourne said yesterday his

songs of suicide and paranoia were grossly
misinterpreted by the parents of a teen-ager
who killed himself after listening to Osbourne's
"Suicide Solution."
"The song wasn't written for suicide. It was
anti-suicide," Osbourne said at a crowded
news conference. "It was about a friend of
mine who killed himself on alcohol and drugs.
'Suicide Solution,' meaning solution as a liquid,
not as a solution to the way out."
Osbourne, 37, appeared with attorney
Howard Weitzman, who read a lengthy state
ment attacking the lawsuit filed in October by
the parents of John Daniel McCollum, 19.
