# THE 						CONSTITUTION
## 
### 
Statement In Favor
Genuine change. It was promised
vehemently by the new Council of
Presidents last spring, and by many far
seeing senators. This new Constitution
is that change. The present student or
ganization amounts to little more than a
junior-level Faculty Senate, a lumbering
and inefficient body that fails to repre
sent, initiate, decide, or even have fun
effectively. It is a monster (yuck!
Monsters are bad!) and this document
is a Monster-Tamer. The smaller size
("say good-bye to Mr. Senate") and
election by one-man, one-vote (say!
That makes sense!) does not reduce
representation, and lends no advantage
to any philosophy or political stance. It
keeps only what is necessary — strong
support for student groups, student
voice, and student representation on
University committees — and chucks
the rest of the fat out the proverbial win
dow.
Here's a quick way to convince your
self that this Constitution is needed:
think about all the good things your stu
dent government has done for you,
ever. C'mon, give it a try. Pretty short
list, huh? 'Nuff said.
Change isn't easy, but inertia will
literally mean years more of the present
moribund, lackluster, self-serving, icky
system we have now. This change is
sorely needed. This Constitution has
been drafted by fire-breathing Presi
dents and frustrated senators alike —
things must really be hurting for
cooperation like that to flourish. Finally,
people around the ASSU are listening
when the student body says, "Hey —
this sucks."
The new Constitution. Because we've
been laughing at an old joke for too
long.
Michael Patrick Collins
Chairman, Council of Presidents

SUMMARY
The New Constitution, if adopted, would
effect these major changes:
Article Two: Legislative Branch — The
legislative branch, currently an elected Sen
ate with 20 voting and 20 alternate mem
bers, becomes two elected Boards, each
with nine voting members, 4 graduate, 4 un
dergraduate, and a chair. The Funding
Board will be responsible for student-group
funding; the Policy Board deals with all else
but focuses on creation of new student
services and selecting students for Univer
sity committees (a Nominations Commis
sion is no longer provided for that purpose).
Each Board will write its own rules and
make all decisions in its area of responsibil
ity. The Boards may meet in joint session,
by request of any eight of the eighteen
members, and may overturn or initiate deci
sions of either Board.
Article Three: Executive Branch
—There will be three rather than four mem
bers of the Council of Presidents. A new po
sition of Administrative Manager is created
to handle day-to-day operations. A veto of
the Council could be overriden by a two
thirds vote of the vetoed board, rather than
the majority vote of the Senate now re
quired to override.
Article Five: Finances — In some
cases, peteition requirements for placing a
student group's Special Fee request on the
ballot have been lowered.
Article Six: Initiative, Referendum,
and Recall — Ballot measures, initiatives,
and referenda are divided between those
that call elections and those that are placed
on the ballot for scheduled elections. The
former require a greater number of
signatures than currently, and the peteitions
must show the cost of the election; the latter
are unaffected.
Article Seven: Amendment — The pe
tition requirement for calling a constitutional
election is raised from five to twenty per
cent. The requirement for placing an
amendment on the ballot for a scheduled
election is raised from five to ten percent.
Amendments interpreted by the University
would not take effect until ratified by the
Boards or by a further vote.
There are no major changes in Articles 1,
4, and 8. The New Constitution would effect
many less important changes. See the text.
Throughout the New Constitution, the
language is made easier to read but more
subject to differing interpretations.

Statement Against
The new Constitution is well intended but will
do the opposite of what its proponents claim.
1. It does not make the ASSU more representa
tive. In fact, it allows for less representatives to
be elected. Less is not more. If voting patterns
of the past are any indication of voting pat
terns to come, the old ASSU bureaucrats who
have had a year or more of press coverage
and thus high name recognition will receive
the most votes, and the new people with fresh
ideas will receive the least. With fewer seats,
all this does is exclude new people.
2. Appeals procedures and independence of
appeals levels would be lessened in cases of
funding errors or bias. The current appeals
procedure allows for a program board
(appointed by non-ASSU-senators) com
pletely different from the ASSU, an appropria
tions committee of a small fraction of the
ASSU, and finally the entire ASSU. The new
proposal is like removing everything but the
Appropriations Committee and has no inde
pendent levels at all. If this constitution was in
effect in the last few years there would now be
no Coalition Against Apartheid or many other
organizations.
3. The new COP powers are too great. An ultra
right wing COP could wipe out funding for any
group if the ASSU senate make-up is similar
to past ones. In past cases (Black Students
Union, Tuesday Films, Coalition Against
Apartheid) when two-thirds of the senate was
needed, it didn't materialize. The make-up of
the COP Is very unstable. If it decided to wipe
out any single organization it could do so by
threatening to veto the whole funding proposal
if the group it didn't like doesn't get its funds
cut.
NOWHERE IN THE NEW CONSTITUTION IS
ANY OF THE ASSU RED TAPE REMOVED.
The (less representative) Senate can still control
Special Fee group budgets. Organizations which
usually get bad treatment in the funding process
will now have no totally independent body to ap
peal to. Minority groups will not have the second
ary seats to occupy which they usually have.
I have served as a member of Program Board,
Chair of the Appropriations Committee, and have
seen first-hand how the ASSU interferes with
student programming. I am currently treasurer of
two student organizations and financial advisor
for several and have experienced ASSU red
tape. If this constitution had been in effect for the
past three years it would have seriously ad
versely affected a great number of groups. I think
that the perspective from which this proposal
was written is classic ASSU: NOT A SINGLE
TREASURER OF ANY STUDENT ORGANIZA
TION WAS CALLED IN FOR CONSULTATION
ON ITS FORMULATION. None of the authors
have ever served on a Program Board-funded
group. Even more typical is the fact that for such
a major funding change NOT A SINGLE STU
DENT GROUP WAS NOTIFIED ABOUT THE
PROPOSED CHANGES OR THAT THEY HAD
A RIGHT TO WRITE A STATEMENT AGAINST
THIS PROPOSAL. I just happened to be in the
ASSU office just before the deadline for submis
sion of statements against it. Students want
ASSU red tape removed, not made more sticky.

Article Five: Finances — In some
cases, peteition requirements for placing a
student group's Special Fee request on the
ballot have been lowered.
Article Six: Initiative, Referendum,
and Recall — Ballot measures, initiatives,
and referenda are divided between those
that call elections and those that are placed
on the ballot for scheduled elections. The
former require a greater number of
signatures than currently, and the peteitions
must show the cost of the election; the latter
are unaffected.
Article Seven: Amendment — The pe
tition requirement for calling a constitutional
election is raised from five to twenty per
cent. The requirement for placing an
amendment on the ballot for a scheduled
election is raised from five to ten percent.
Amendments interpreted by the University
would not take effect until ratified by the
Boards or by a further vote.
There are no major changes in Articles 1,
4, and 8. The New Constitution would effect
many less important changes. See the text.
Throughout the New Constitution, the
language is made easier to read but more
subject to differing interpretations.

Statement Against
The new Constitution is well intended but will
do the opposite of what its proponents claim.
1. It does not make the ASSU more representa
tive. In fact, it allows for less representatives to
be elected. Less is not more. If voting patterns
of the past are any indication of voting pat
terns to come, the old ASSU bureaucrats who
have had a year or more of press coverage
and thus high name recognition will receive
the most votes, and the new people with fresh
ideas will receive the least. With fewer seats,
all this does is exclude new people.
2. Appeals procedures and independence of
appeals levels would be lessened in cases of
funding errors or bias. The current appeals
procedure allows for a program board
(appointed by non-ASSU-senators) com
pletely different from the ASSU, an appropria
tions committee of a small fraction of the
ASSU, and finally the entire ASSU. The new
proposal is like removing everything but the
Appropriations Committee and has no inde
pendent levels at all. If this constitution was in
effect in the last few years there would now be
no Coalition Against Apartheid or many other
organizations.
3. The new COP powers are too great. An ultra
right wing COP could wipe out funding for any
group if the ASSU senate make-up is similar
to past ones. In past cases (Black Students
Union, Tuesday Films, Coalition Against
Apartheid) when two-thirds of the senate was
needed, it didn't materialize. The make-up of
the COP Is very unstable. If it decided to wipe
out any single organization it could do so by
threatening to veto the whole funding proposal
if the group it didn't like doesn't get its funds
cut.
NOWHERE IN THE NEW CONSTITUTION IS
ANY OF THE ASSU RED TAPE REMOVED.
The (less representative) Senate can still control
Special Fee group budgets. Organizations which
usually get bad treatment in the funding process
will now have no totally independent body to ap
peal to. Minority groups will not have the second
ary seats to occupy which they usually have.
I have served as a member of Program Board,
Chair of the Appropriations Committee, and have
seen first-hand how the ASSU interferes with
student programming. I am currently treasurer of
two student organizations and financial advisor
for several and have experienced ASSU red
tape. If this constitution had been in effect for the
past three years it would have seriously ad
versely affected a great number of groups. I think
that the perspective from which this proposal
was written is classic ASSU: NOT A SINGLE
TREASURER OF ANY STUDENT ORGANIZA
TION WAS CALLED IN FOR CONSULTATION
ON ITS FORMULATION. None of the authors
have ever served on a Program Board-funded
group. Even more typical is the fact that for such
a major funding change NOT A SINGLE STU
DENT GROUP WAS NOTIFIED ABOUT THE
PROPOSED CHANGES OR THAT THEY HAD
A RIGHT TO WRITE A STATEMENT AGAINST
THIS PROPOSAL. I just happened to be in the
ASSU office just before the deadline for submis
sion of statements against it. Students want
ASSU red tape removed, not made more sticky.

BE fT ENACIH) BY TIE ASBOQATH) BTUDBUTS OF STANFORD UNNERSnY: that the new Constitution
replaces the current Constitution of the ASBU.
Statement In Favor
Genuine change. It was promised
vehemently by the new Council of
Presidents last spring, and by many far
seeing senators. This new Constitution
is that change. The present student or
ganization amounts to little more than a
junior-level Faculty Senate, a lumbering
and inefficient body that fails to repre
sent, initiate, decide, or even have fun
effectively. It is a monster (yuck!
Monsters are bad!) and this document
is a Monster-Tamer. The smaller size
("say good-bye to Mr. Senate") and
election by one-man, one-vote (say!
That makes sense!) does not reduce
representation, and lends no advantage
to any philosophy or political stance. It
keeps only what is necessary — strong
support for student groups, student
voice, and student representation on
University committees — and chucks
the rest of the fat out the proverbial win
dow.
Here's a quick way to convince your
self that this Constitution is needed:
think about all the good things your stu
dent government has done for you,
ever. C'mon, give it a try. Pretty short
list, huh? 'Nuff said.
Change isn't easy, but inertia will
literally mean years more of the present
moribund, lackluster, self-serving, icky
system we have now. This change is
sorely needed. This Constitution has
been drafted by fire-breathing Presi
dents and frustrated senators alike —
things must really be hurting for
cooperation like that to flourish. Finally,
people around the ASSU are listening
when the student body says, "Hey —
this sucks."
The new Constitution. Because we've
been laughing at an old joke for too
long.
Michael Patrick Collins
Chairman, Council of Presidents

SUMMARY
The New Constitution, if adopted, would
effect these major changes:
Article Two: Legislative Branch — The
legislative branch, currently an elected Sen
ate with 20 voting and 20 alternate mem
bers, becomes two elected Boards, each
with nine voting members, 4 graduate, 4 un
dergraduate, and a chair. The Funding
Board will be responsible for student-group
funding; the Policy Board deals with all else
but focuses on creation of new student
services and selecting students for Univer
sity committees (a Nominations Commis
sion is no longer provided for that purpose).
Each Board will write its own rules and
make all decisions in its area of responsibil
ity. The Boards may meet in joint session,
by request of any eight of the eighteen
members, and may overturn or initiate deci
sions of either Board.
Article Three: Executive Branch
—There will be three rather than four mem
bers of the Council of Presidents. A new po
sition of Administrative Manager is created
to handle day-to-day operations. A veto of
the Council could be overriden by a two
thirds vote of the vetoed board, rather than
the majority vote of the Senate now re
quired to override.
Article Five: Finances — In some
cases, peteition requirements for placing a
student group's Special Fee request on the
ballot have been lowered.
Article Six: Initiative, Referendum,
