# CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS Constitutional Amendment 1
## 
### 
Statement In Favor
Ed Renwick, ASSU Senator, Sponsor
The Nominations Commission (Nom Com) per
forms the extremely important task of nominating
student members to virtually all University com
mittees. Attracting qualified Nom Com members
is extremely important. The Constitution currently
provides that members of the Commission are to
be selected in Winter Quarter and take office the
first day of Spring quarter. Unfortunately, the term
of office for University committees coincides with
the academic year. This means that enthusiastic
and experienced students involved in University
committees are unable to apply for membership
in Nom Com for the following year because the
term of office for University committees overlaps.
This amendment will eliminate the overlapping
terms of office by providing that Nom Corn's term
of office will be specified in the Bylaws. The term
of office could thus be made to coincide with the
academic year, and a member of a University
committee could apply for membership in Nom
Com for the following year.
Filling Nom Com with qualified students is very
important. These students represent you and
your interests to the University. Vote YES!

Summary
This amendment modifies the section
of the Constitution specifying the term of
office of members of the Nominations
Commission, which nominates student
members to virtually ail University com
mittees. The current language provides
that members of the Commission are to
be selected in Winter, and take office by
the first day of Spring quarter. The new
language provides that the term of office
will be specified by the Senate in the By-
Laws. The new By-Laws to be enacted
along with the amendment state that the
term of office will coincide with the aca
demic year.

Senate Recommendation
YES. In the past several years, it has proven
extremely difficult to find students willing to serve
on the Nominations Commission. In part this is
due to the fact that the Constitution specifies a
term of office for Nom Com members which over
laps that of most other positions, including all Uni
versity committees. Since Nom Com members
are prohibited from being appointed to University
committees, interested students had to choose
between serving on Nom Com and serving on a
committee.
This amendment will eliminate the overlapping
terms of office. A student could thus be appointed
to a committee by the out-going Nom Com during
Spring quarter, and then be appointed to serve
on Nom Com for the following year. Since the ex
act term of office will be specified in the By-Laws
rather than the Constitution, it will be possible to
modify it if necessary as circumstances change.
Nom Com members perform one of the most
important functions of student government at
Stanford. This amendment will make it easier to
attract qualified students to the Commission.
Please vote yes.
