# Constitutional Amendment 2
## 
### 
Statement In Favor Of
Sponsor: Jim DeLaHunt
Stanford's student fee system is an outstanding
model of democratic taxation — except for the Associ
ation Fee. It costs $16 per year, and you never get to
vote on it! The ASSU Senate decides all alone how
much to charge you for the Association Fee. This
amendment puts that power in your hands.
The Association Fee is given out to lots of small stu
dent groups, and so setting the size of the Association
Fee is a simple trade-off between more funding and
lower ASSU fees. Right now, the Senate tries to guess
which you want. With this amendment, you can say
yourself. Do you want more funding? You'll vote for an
increase. Do you want to cut ASSU fees? You can vote
for a decrease. And if half the students agree with you,
the fee will move in the direction you want!
This amendment is carefully written to be responsive
to students without endangering the funding that stu
dent groups depend on. Fees will increase and
decrease in small increments, so that there will never
be a year when there is suddenly no funding — and no
programming. On the other hand, we can make major
changes to fees to adapt to changing circumstances.
The fee will be set to the median, not the average, of
the votes, so extremists voting at the ends of the range
won't have undue effect. The Senate will continue to do
what it does well, namely distribute the funds to student
groups, but it will no longer be able to force a sudden
increase or decrease in the fee down your thro~l
This amendment doesn't endanger your right to a
refund of the Association Fee. It doesn't raise or lower
your ASSU fees — the existing Program Board and
Publications Board are locked in at their current levels.
In fact, it is scrupulously neutral towards raising or
lowering fees. It doesn't create any new fees. All it
does is give you more control over how much of your
money the ASSU takes away.
One final thing. If you vote yes on this amendment
now (and the University doesn't torpedo it), you can
vote on the Program Board and Pub Board this Spring.
Do it! Vote yes — "Let Students Set the Association
Fee"!

Summary
The Association Fee is part of the "ASSU
Fees" collected from every student at registra
tion, and the ASSU distributes it, via the Program
Board and Publications Board, to student groups
and publications needing small amounts of fund
ing. The Association Fee is currently $5-$6 per
student per quarter, and is refundable. Unlike
Special Fees, which are voted on by the student
body, the size of the Fee is set by the ASSU Sen
ate each Spring.
This amendment does three things. Firstly, it
splits the single Association Fee into two inde
pendent "General Fees", the Program Board and
Publications Board. Secondly, it has the students
voting in the Spring quarter general election set
the size of each General Fee, as follows: For
each fee, the ballot would list a number of
choices above and below the current amount —
for instance, the Program Board fee might list ad
justments of -10 percent, -5 percent, 0 percent, 5
percent, or 10 percent to its current $156,000
level. Each student would vote for their preferred
fee level. The median of their votes would be the
new amount for that Fee. Thirdly, this amend
ment provides that General Fees can't be created
or abolished without a two-thirds vote by the stu
dent body.
This amendment does not by itself affect the
amount of fees collected or the uses to which
they are put. If it takes effect this winter, it will al
low the Program and Publications Board Fees to
be voted on this Spring. It will take effect regard
less of the vote on the New Constitution, since it
modifies both the new and old constitutions.

Statement Against
The proposed change in the Constitution will be the
worst thing that has ever happened to student organi
zations and programs at Stanford. That's why NO OR
GANIZATION WAS NOTIFIED OF THE PLACEMENT
OF THIS AMENDMENT ON THE BALLOT UNTIL
AFTER THE DEADLINE FOR SUBMITTING STATE
MENTS AGAINST IT. The only reason that this state
ment got in this book is that an appeal was made to the
elections commissioner after the deadline.
The new proposal would have students vote on.fund
ing for student groups WITHOUT KNOWING WHICH
GROUPS AND WHICH PROGRAMS WOULD BE
WIPED OUT UNTIL AFTER IT IS TOO LATE.
Nowhere in this proposal is there a provision for listing
the groups that will get the axe when students get to
vote on paying less "taxes" or not. If students think the
fee assessed is too high, they can get it refunded.
It is a bad idea to let students who take full refunds
vote on how much money other students spend on pro
grams. Twenty-five percent of the students will prob
ably vote to drastically cut the program funding and
then take their money back. Why should the students
who don't want to chip in on funding have any influence
on the funding they don't pay.
Furthermore, even the most well-intended student
could not possibly determine how much funding is
needed without a careful analysis of the funding sys
tem. That's what we elect senators for.
The proposal would also freeze out all new and inno
vative major programming. If some good new idea
came up students would never even hear about it.
There would be no funds to do the new program and
the students would never know that funds should have
been around when they next go to the polls.
