endum. 83 percent. Apartheid. Investment. Racism.
Investment. Murder. Investment. Stanford. South
Africa. Divestment. Now.
As students we do not control this University. We
cannot vote for the Board of Trustees or President
Kennedy. However, we do have a student government
and we can control what it does. The ASSU has its
money invested with the University in South Africa in
Merge Pool "B." We can end that. We can cease to as
sist the South African government symbolically and ac
tually.
Opponents argue that divestment from the
University would mean that the ASSU would lose
money. This argument is based on the premise of the
ASSU then managing its money on its own, hiring a
money-manager, and suffering from a small amount of
money in a few companies. Thus leading to a lack of
stock diversification.
This premise is incorrect. The money would be
merged with a socially-responsible investment firm,
which manages a great deal of money and earns
similar returns. Therefore no additional costs. No new
manager. No reduced diversification. No loss.
Apologists for apartheid argue either that 1) divest
ment will hurt blacks, 2) the regime needs time to
reform, 3) divestment is only symbolic, 4) Soviets will
move in.
Contradictions include: 1) over 70 percent of blacks
called for divestment in latest poll, and American cor
porations employ less than 1 percent of blacks, 2) the
regime has demonstrated a commitment to status quo
and has intensified repression, 3) alone, our divest
ments effect may be small, but as part of a growing
tidal wave of universities that have divested it is signifi
cant; furthermore, divestment hits front-page Johan
nesburg and lowers opporessor's morale, 4) if we are
anti-Soviet because of their human rights violations,
why support a regime which does the same?
As Gil Scot-Heron says, "If you don't stand for some
thing you'll go for anything." Stand against apartheid.
Divest Now.

Summary
This non-binding referendum is meant to
advise the ASSU on whether it should continue to
invest the money it holds for students with the
University. The ASSU holds endowment funds
and voluntary student organization funds for stu
dents. Endowment funds give the ASSU interest
income on which it operates, and they also pro
vide a reserve. Student organization funds are
raised by groups ttrough student fees and their
own fundraising: groups are required by the Uni
versity to bank with the ASSU.
Most of these funds are currently invested with
the University's funds. The University's funds are
in turn invested in a variety of assets in order to
give security and a high yield. Corporations that
do business in South Africa are included in this
portfolio.
If the ASSU removed the students' money from
the University 1 pools, it would be the responsibility
of the Financial Manager, with Senate approval,
to find other investments for the students' money.
The financial impact, both in terms of return and
in terms of cost of managing, is unknown at this
time.
A yes vote advises divestment from the Uni
versity pools; a no vote advises remaining with
the University pools.

Statement Against
Steve Smith, ASSU Senator
While apartheid is a heinous practice that
should be abolished by whatever means neces
sary, it has not been shown that divestment from
American companies doing business in South
Africa will achieve this goal. These companies
have made progress in helping the blacks and
remain a very powerful tool to use against the op
pressive government since money is often
stronger than reason. If American companies are
forced to leave South Africa, they will no doubt be
replaced by other foreign companies that might
not give a damn about reform. We can do the
most good if we retain our position in these com
panies and work from within the system rather
than divesting and consequently losing any eco
nomic influence we might have to do some good.
