Students should "translate (Bishop Des
mond) Tutu's message into action ... be
cause the message is a call to action," said
Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA) rep
resentative Michael Schmitz at yesterday's
noon rally in White Plaza.
Sponsored by SOSA, the anti-apartheid
rally, which drew a crowd of about 100,
supported the efforts of Tutu and Martin
Luther King. Jr. for self-determination and
civil rights.
King's birthday, officially observed for
the first time this year, "celebrates a
movement" for liberation, said Schmitz.
"We've struggled to build a student

movement" pushing for self-determination
and equal rights for all peoples, he said,
noting that Tutu has supported student ac
tivists.
Quoting Tutu, Schmitz said the move
ment is not a struggle for petty reforms,
but a struggle for political power, majority
rule and the abolition of apartheid in South
Africa.
Bringing the struggle closer to home,
freshman Ira Williams of the Black Student
Union (BSU) defined the "crises facing
Stanford . . . (as) the fight to preserve
Ujamaa (the black theme house)," reform
the Western Culture tracks and change the
way in which the University perceives
blacks.
