# Rally Clamors for Action

Students should "translate (Bishop Des
mond) Tutu's message into action ... be
cause the message is a call to action," said
Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA) rep
resentative Michael Schmitz at yesterday's
noon rally in White Plaza.
Sponsored by SOSA, the anti-apartheid
rally, which drew a crowd of about 100,
supported the efforts of Tutu and Martin
Luther King. Jr. for self-determination and
civil rights.
King's birthday, officially observed for
the first time this year, "celebrates a
movement" for liberation, said Schmitz.
"We've struggled to build a student

movement" pushing for self-determination
and equal rights for all peoples, he said,
noting that Tutu has supported student ac
tivists.
Quoting Tutu, Schmitz said the move
ment is not a struggle for petty reforms,
but a struggle for political power, majority
rule and the abolition of apartheid in South
Africa.
Bringing the struggle closer to home,
freshman Ira Williams of the Black Student
Union (BSU) defined the "crises facing
Stanford . . . (as) the fight to preserve
Ujamaa (the black theme house)," reform
the Western Culture tracks and change the
way in which the University perceives
blacks.

Senior Mario Huerta, member of SOSA, spent the night before the SOSA
rally in this cardboard shack, part of the shantytown in White Plaza.
Questioning the focus of the
Western Culture tracks, a three
quarter series of classes required of
every undergraduate, on the works
of "white, European males," Wil
liams emphasized that all the stu
dents are not from that cultural
background. There needs to be a
correlation between the various
heritages of the students and the
classes offered to them, he said.
"Where is the liberal education

promised by the University?" asked
sophomore Rudy Fuentes, noting
the lack of classes on Chicano is
sues as well as the shortage of
Chicano professors.
"Let's take our beliefs and let's
live them," said SOSA member
Caroline Paul, urging the small
crowd not to be afraid of being
called radicals or of being lone indi
viduals in "a social monster."
An open-mike rally is scheduled
for noon today at White Plaza, and
there will be a teach-in at 3:30 in
Old Union, according to SOSA
member Mary Rose.
