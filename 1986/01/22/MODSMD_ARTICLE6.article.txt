In less than a month, Halley's Comet will once
again reach perihelion, the point in its orbit when
it is closest to the sun and the time when
earthbound skywatchers will also have a chance
to renew their fascination with this historic
feature of the night sky.
Scientific advances during the 75 years since
Halley's was last in viewing range should provide
the most informative interaction with comets in
history.
At the same time, Green Library's Depart
ment of Special Collections plans to inform
viewers about the history of this relationship
with comets by displaying a treasury of scientific
works.
The exhibit, entitled "Starry Messengers:
Comets in Science and Society," opened Sunday
at the Louis R. Lurie Rotunda and Gallery, which
is accessible from the Green Library entry facing
History Comer.
The display of old, rare books is the work of
researcher/bibliographer Henry Logwood, head
of the History of Science and Technology Collec
tions at Stanford. In the exhibit, Logwood says
he traces "the continuing story of humankind's
fascination with comets, both in science and soci
ety."
The chronological display begins with

"Comets in Antiquity" and leads to "Halley's
Comet in 1986." The first display highlights the
cometary theory of Aristotle, the dominant au
thority on comets in the classical period. Henry
Logwood writes, "Aristotle depicted comets as
irregularly occurring, 'hot, dry exhalations from
the earth's surface," and Aristotle describes the
comet tail as "emissions which catch fire as they

rise to the outer edge of the sublunary sphere."
Logwood's study shows how ancient civiliza
tion's interest in comets focused on them as por
tents of historical events and natural
catastrophes.
The same interest held for comets in the
