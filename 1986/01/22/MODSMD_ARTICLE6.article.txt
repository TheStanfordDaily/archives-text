# Green Gathers Great Balls of Fire

### KRISTEN BROWN 
In less than a month, Halley's Comet will once
again reach perihelion, the point in its orbit when
it is closest to the sun and the time when
earthbound skywatchers will also have a chance
to renew their fascination with this historic
feature of the night sky.
Scientific advances during the 75 years since
Halley's was last in viewing range should provide
the most informative interaction with comets in
history.
At the same time, Green Library's Depart
ment of Special Collections plans to inform
viewers about the history of this relationship
with comets by displaying a treasury of scientific
works.
The exhibit, entitled "Starry Messengers:
Comets in Science and Society," opened Sunday
at the Louis R. Lurie Rotunda and Gallery, which
is accessible from the Green Library entry facing
History Comer.
The display of old, rare books is the work of
researcher/bibliographer Henry Logwood, head
of the History of Science and Technology Collec
tions at Stanford. In the exhibit, Logwood says
he traces "the continuing story of humankind's
fascination with comets, both in science and soci
ety."
The chronological display begins with

"Comets in Antiquity" and leads to "Halley's
Comet in 1986." The first display highlights the
cometary theory of Aristotle, the dominant au
thority on comets in the classical period. Henry
Logwood writes, "Aristotle depicted comets as
irregularly occurring, 'hot, dry exhalations from
the earth's surface," and Aristotle describes the
comet tail as "emissions which catch fire as they

rise to the outer edge of the sublunary sphere."
Logwood's study shows how ancient civiliza
tion's interest in comets focused on them as por
tents of historical events and natural
catastrophes.
The same interest held for comets in the

Middle Ages. Two brilliant comets
of 1472 were catalogued in "The
Lucerne Chronicle" of 1513, an
original copy of which is on display
in the collection. These manifesta
tions were credited by contempo
rary skywatchers with producing
summers with no fruit, plague and
warfare.
The display reveals more of
these superstitions in the 1473
volume of Isadore Seville's
"Etymologies," in which comets
"signify political revolutions, wars
and pestilences."
"The lasting contribution of the
Middle Ages to the appreciation of
comets was aesthetic," Logwood
says in the notes that accompany
the show. He refers to the comet
images in such well-known master
pieces of the period as the Bayeux
Tapestry, the Canterbury Psalter
and Giotto's "Adoration of the
Magi." Even Dante described the
image of blessed souls "flaming like

comets" in the "Paradiso."
The display continues to
chronicle the developments of the
new astronomy of the 16th century,
when scientists disputed the loca
tion of comets by asking, "Do they
pass inside the earth's atmosphere
or outside?"
According to Logwood, the
Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe
asserts "that comets must be lo
cated beyond the sphere of the
moon's orbit."
This theory conflicted with Aris
totle's cosmological theory. Aris
totle reserves the realm beyond the
earth's atmosphere for celestial,
immutable bodies like planets.
The issue of the location and path
of comets continued in 1618, when
three comets appeared. The special
collection includes the"De Com
etis" of Johannes Kepler, imperial
mathematician at Prague, which
maintains that the comets of 1607
and 1618 moved in straight lines.
The theory of Brahe, his
predecessor, displeased him, for

Brahe had proposed that comets
move in circular orbits and thereby
share the divine forms of motion
reserved for planets.
Another important contem
porary issue pitted heliocentrists
against geocentrists.
In his attempt to prove
heliocentrism, Galileo Galilei was
unable to explain the whereabouts
of comets and implied that they
might be optical illusions. However,
he effectively refuted arguments
against heliocentrism in his 1632
treatise "II Saggiatore" ("The As
sayer"), now also on display in
Green.
Despite 17th-century explana
tions based on scientific reasoning,
many people continued to view
comets as supernatural.
According to Logwood's notes,
the German scientist Erhard Weisel
(1625-1699) "chose a metaphysical
rather than a mechanistic explana
tion for the appearances of com
ets." The 1661 edition of
"Speculum Uranicum," on display

now in Green, described his theory
that comets are the signs of God's
displeasure.
Although theorists like Weisel
still existed, Logwood says,"The
progress of science during the 17th
century steadily eroded the power
of superstition and supernaturalism
on prevailing attitudes toward na
ture. The conception of comets
. . . succumbed to the rules of rea
son."
An example of such reason is evi
dent in Pierre Bayle's (1647-1706)
"Miscellaneous Thoughts on the
Comet of 1680." Writes Logwood,
"Comets, in Bayle's view, must be
regarded as 'ordinary works of na
ture which, without regard to the
happiness or misery of mankind,
are moved from one part of the
heavens to the other by the general
laws of motion.' "
While compiling data on such
comets during the 1600s,
astronomer Sir Edmund Halley
"noticed that a comet he observed
in 1682 appeared to resemble the

observed paths of three other re
corded comets visible in 1456, 1531
and 1607.
"He concluded that these obser
vations referred to a single comet
with an orbital cycle of about 75
years, and that this same comet
would therefore return in 1758 or
1759. Nearly 16 years after his
death, the comet returned as
predicted, and thus became known
as Halley's Comet," reports Log
wood.
Halley's observational evidence
led him to his conviction that com
ets follow regular orbits. This idea
was pure hypothesis until the
predicted return of the comet phys
ically proved the theory of universal
gravitation described in Newton's
"Principia," a 1687 version of which
is also in Green.
Halley's comet returned on
schedule in 1759. Logwood writes,
"The self-congratulatory enthusiasm
of Newtonians in the 18th century
encouraged the opinion that their
enlightened understanding of natu

ral events like comets brought
them closer to a true appreciation
for the Creator's ingenuity."
To Logwood, the confirmation of
Newton's and Halley's hypotheses
after the first return of Halley's
Comet in 1759 signified a "triumph
of science" in that "prevailing atti
tudes toward comets as natural
phenomena were radically trans
formed." He writes, "The educated
classes took a more dispassionate
view of the comets, as befit the
'enlightened' spirit of the age.
"The present century," Log
wood concludes, "has brought the
proliferation of data, techniques and
theories pertaining to comets to a
previously unimaginable pace."
Japan, the Soviet Union and the
11-nation European Space Agency
scheduled satellite missions to gath
er data on Halley's Comet. The
United States, citing the con
straints of federal budget-cutting,
has opted not to launch a similar
probe.

tion's interest in comets focused on them as por
tents of historical events and natural
catastrophes.
The same interest held for comets in the

Middle Ages. Two brilliant comets
of 1472 were catalogued in "The
Lucerne Chronicle" of 1513, an
original copy of which is on display
in the collection. These manifesta
tions were credited by contempo
rary skywatchers with producing
summers with no fruit, plague and
warfare.
The display reveals more of
these superstitions in the 1473
volume of Isadore Seville's
"Etymologies," in which comets
"signify political revolutions, wars
and pestilences."
"The lasting contribution of the
Middle Ages to the appreciation of
comets was aesthetic," Logwood
says in the notes that accompany
the show. He refers to the comet
images in such well-known master
pieces of the period as the Bayeux
Tapestry, the Canterbury Psalter
and Giotto's "Adoration of the
Magi." Even Dante described the
image of blessed souls "flaming like

comets" in the "Paradiso."
The display continues to
chronicle the developments of the
new astronomy of the 16th century,
when scientists disputed the loca
tion of comets by asking, "Do they
pass inside the earth's atmosphere
or outside?"
According to Logwood, the
Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe
asserts "that comets must be lo
cated beyond the sphere of the
moon's orbit."
This theory conflicted with Aris
totle's cosmological theory. Aris
totle reserves the realm beyond the
earth's atmosphere for celestial,
immutable bodies like planets.
The issue of the location and path
of comets continued in 1618, when
three comets appeared. The special
collection includes the"De Com
etis" of Johannes Kepler, imperial
mathematician at Prague, which
maintains that the comets of 1607
and 1618 moved in straight lines.
The theory of Brahe, his
predecessor, displeased him, for

Brahe had proposed that comets
move in circular orbits and thereby
share the divine forms of motion
reserved for planets.
Another important contem
porary issue pitted heliocentrists
against geocentrists.
In his attempt to prove
heliocentrism, Galileo Galilei was
unable to explain the whereabouts
of comets and implied that they
might be optical illusions. However,
he effectively refuted arguments
against heliocentrism in his 1632
treatise "II Saggiatore" ("The As
sayer"), now also on display in
Green.
Despite 17th-century explana
tions based on scientific reasoning,
many people continued to view
comets as supernatural.
According to Logwood's notes,
the German scientist Erhard Weisel
(1625-1699) "chose a metaphysical
rather than a mechanistic explana
tion for the appearances of com
ets." The 1661 edition of
"Speculum Uranicum," on display

now in Green, described his theory
that comets are the signs of God's
displeasure.
Although theorists like Weisel
still existed, Logwood says,"The
progress of science during the 17th
century steadily eroded the power
of superstition and supernaturalism
on prevailing attitudes toward na
ture. The conception of comets
. . . succumbed to the rules of rea
son."
An example of such reason is evi
dent in Pierre Bayle's (1647-1706)
"Miscellaneous Thoughts on the
Comet of 1680." Writes Logwood,
"Comets, in Bayle's view, must be
regarded as 'ordinary works of na
ture which, without regard to the
happiness or misery of mankind,
are moved from one part of the
heavens to the other by the general
laws of motion.' "
While compiling data on such
comets during the 1600s,
astronomer Sir Edmund Halley
"noticed that a comet he observed
in 1682 appeared to resemble the

observed paths of three other re
corded comets visible in 1456, 1531
and 1607.
"He concluded that these obser
vations referred to a single comet
with an orbital cycle of about 75
years, and that this same comet
would therefore return in 1758 or
1759. Nearly 16 years after his
death, the comet returned as
predicted, and thus became known
as Halley's Comet," reports Log
wood.
Halley's observational evidence
led him to his conviction that com
ets follow regular orbits. This idea
was pure hypothesis until the
predicted return of the comet phys
ically proved the theory of universal
gravitation described in Newton's
"Principia," a 1687 version of which
is also in Green.
Halley's comet returned on
schedule in 1759. Logwood writes,
"The self-congratulatory enthusiasm
of Newtonians in the 18th century
encouraged the opinion that their
enlightened understanding of natu

ral events like comets brought
them closer to a true appreciation
for the Creator's ingenuity."
To Logwood, the confirmation of
Newton's and Halley's hypotheses
after the first return of Halley's
Comet in 1759 signified a "triumph
of science" in that "prevailing atti
tudes toward comets as natural
phenomena were radically trans
formed." He writes, "The educated
classes took a more dispassionate
view of the comets, as befit the
'enlightened' spirit of the age.
"The present century," Log
wood concludes, "has brought the
proliferation of data, techniques and
theories pertaining to comets to a
previously unimaginable pace."
Japan, the Soviet Union and the
11-nation European Space Agency
scheduled satellite missions to gath
er data on Halley's Comet. The
United States, citing the con
straints of federal budget-cutting,
has opted not to launch a similar
probe.
In less than a month, Halley's Comet will once
again reach perihelion, the point in its orbit when
it is closest to the sun and the time when
earthbound skywatchers will also have a chance
to renew their fascination with this historic
feature of the night sky.
Scientific advances during the 75 years since
Halley's was last in viewing range should provide
the most informative interaction with comets in
history.
At the same time, Green Library's Depart
ment of Special Collections plans to inform
viewers about the history of this relationship
with comets by displaying a treasury of scientific
works.
The exhibit, entitled "Starry Messengers:
Comets in Science and Society," opened Sunday
at the Louis R. Lurie Rotunda and Gallery, which
is accessible from the Green Library entry facing
History Comer.
The display of old, rare books is the work of
researcher/bibliographer Henry Logwood, head
of the History of Science and Technology Collec
tions at Stanford. In the exhibit, Logwood says
he traces "the continuing story of humankind's
fascination with comets, both in science and soci
ety."
The chronological display begins with

"Comets in Antiquity" and leads to "Halley's
Comet in 1986." The first display highlights the
cometary theory of Aristotle, the dominant au
thority on comets in the classical period. Henry
Logwood writes, "Aristotle depicted comets as
irregularly occurring, 'hot, dry exhalations from
the earth's surface," and Aristotle describes the
comet tail as "emissions which catch fire as they

rise to the outer edge of the sublunary sphere."
