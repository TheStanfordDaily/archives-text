Guest Lecturer
Rabbi Naftoli Estulin
Director of the Chabad
Russian Immigrant Program of California
Rabbi Estulin is a product of the Jewish Underground Movement in the Soviet Union.
Until his emigration to America in 1972, he spent 7 years shuttling from city to city as
part of a clandestine travelling veshiva, staying one step ahead of Russian police. He
now brings to our country his fortitude and stamina acquired behind the Iron Curtain,
helping the adjustment of newly arrived Russian Immigrants to their new free world.
The phrase "thank G-d for rebbe Naftula" has become a household word to hundreds
of Russian refugees within the greater L. A. community.
Come share his history and experiences at a joyous Melava Malka Celebration.
