CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT
MANDATES AVAILABILITY OF
BEN-WAH BELLS IN FRESHMAN DORMS
Well, actually it doesn't. But you really ought to vote on the is
sues in the upcoming Constitutional Election, because many of
the ideas here are every bit as exciting as obscure sex toys with
intriguing names:
* The New Constitution: It eliminates the senate, creates a pair of
smaller boards to work with student groups and university com
mittee nominations, streamlines the special fees process, gives the
government a nickname ("Fred"), and urges people to love one
another.
* Funding Amendment: Allows students to vote on the size of the
Association Fee, including the budgets of the Program and
Publications Boards. Does not even mention Ben-Wah bals once.
* Nominations Commission Amendment: Allows Nominations
Commission terms to change so that more students can serve in
this entertaining capacity.
* ASSU Divestment Referendum: Advises the ASSU on whether
students want to divest ASSU funds from University portfolios
including investment in South Africa. Again, this has little to do
with auto-eroticism.
Needed: 1 Senate, No Members.
