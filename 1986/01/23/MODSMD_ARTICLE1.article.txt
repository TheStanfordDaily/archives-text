# Commission Discusses Honor Code
## 
### ERIC HEALY Staff writer 
"There seems to be a reluctance
on the part of students when they
see something questionable hap
pening to speak up," said Stanford
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole
yesterday during this year's first'
meeting of the Honor Code Com
mission.
"The way the Honor Code is
written, reporting fellow students
is a last resort. Stopping the behav
ior (that violates the Honor Code) is
the priority," Cole said, comment
ing on the issue of a third person
reporting on fellow students.
"Students should speak up by
saying something like 'Hey, you
over there, cut it out' to fellow stu
dents who are violating the Honor
Code during examinations," she
said.
"About one-third of the cases
. . . that I look into are reported by
students. . . . The kinds of things
that I hear from students are about
in-class exams," said Cole, who
responds to complaints of Honor
Code violations filed through the
Stanford Judicial Council.
"About 20 students on the
average come to me each year in
the third-party capacity," she said.
Responding to questions on the
relationship between the Honor
Code, the Fundamental Standard
and the Policy on Campus Disrup
tion (PCD), Cole said, "There is a
relationship in the sense that they
all concern student behavior."
However. Jon Adelstein, chair
man of the Honor Code Commis
sion, said, "Unlike the Honor Code,
the PCD was imposed by the ad
ministration. Most ominously, the
PCD lacks any justification other
than its design to repress student
rights."
Cole said the PCD has "a sepa
rate history but the process of
trying it is exactly the same as the
Honor Code because they both deal
with student behavior.
"The Fundamental Standard can
cover anything we want it to cover.
If we want it to be arbitrary, we
could use that just as easily as the
present Policy on Campus Disrup
tion," Cole said.
Formulated in 1967, the PCD
applies to any disruptive activity on
campus and can be applied to ac
tivism such as sit-ins at University
facilities, according to Adelstein. En
forcement of the policy is at the dis
cretion of the University, he said.
Cole likened the Fundamental
Standard to a "catch-all on student
behavior," including issues such as
the alcohol policy and the policy on
driving on campus while intox
icated, which can be applied at the
discretion of the Stanford Judicial
Council.
