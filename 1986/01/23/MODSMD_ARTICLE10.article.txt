# Inventor Speaks on Flight

Inventor Paul MacCready told a Branner Hall au
dience last night that a $100,000 personal debt
prompted him to develop a series of man-powered
flying machines that led to his being named Engineer
of the Century by the American Society of Mechani
cal Engineers.
In 1976, MacCready developed the Gossamer
Condor, the first man-powered flying machine to
complete a one-mile, figure-eight course. For his in
vention, MacCready received a prize of 50,000
British pounds, which had been established 17 years
before by Henry Kremer.
"I did it for the money," MacCready candidly told
the crowd of more than 120 people. MacCready,
who also won the Lindbergh award in 1982, said he
needed the money to pay off a bank loan used to
found AeroVironment, Inc., a company providing
products and services for energy and the atmo
spheric environment.
MacCready also developed the Gossamer Al
batross, the first man-powered flying machine to
make the 22-mile trek across the English Channel,
and the Solar Challenger, a vehicle powered by
16,000 solar cells that can fly at 20 mph at heights
greater than 14,000 feet. He began working on
solar-powered flight in 1979 during the energy
crisis.
Showing slides and a film of his inventions, Mac-
Cready credited "lateral thinking â€” working on
something that was separate," as the key process
that allowed him to figure out the engineering tech
niques needed to create the Gossamer Condor.
MacCready's ideas came while studying the flying
motions of birds, taking note of their turning radii
and wing angles. He also studied the mechanics of
common hang gliders.
"The great secret weapon that I had was no
knowledge of aircraft structure," MacCready said,

noting that this freed him from using the conven
tional logic of airplane engineers. He said specialists
in airplane design "had blinders on" when it came to
creating a man-powered flying machine.
The result of that free-thinking was a 55-pound
machine that flew the one-mile course at an average
altitude of 10 feet and speed of 10 mph.
The Gossamer Condor now hangs in the National
Air and Space Museum in Washington, D. C., next td
Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis and the
Wright brothers' original flying machine, he said.
MacCready's most recent experiments involve
creating a replica of the pterodactyl, a flying
dinosaur that inhabited the earth 63 million years
ago. That machine, controlled from the ground,
features wings that move up, down, forward and
backward and a head that serves as a rudder to help
guide the machine's direction.
