Acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS) is not solely a medical problem, stressed
a panel of three experts last night in Kresge
Auditorium as part of a continuing symposium
sponsored by the Human Biology Program.
Each of the experts — Stan Hadden, Joel
Wachs and Dr. Paul Volberding — made a
presentation before fielding questions from the
audience of about 90.
"The problem involves society, politics and
the media," said Volberding, director of the
AIDS activity unit at San Francisco General
Hospital.
Both Hadden and Wachs touched upon the po
litical aspects of the disease. Wachs, a Los An
geles City Council member, recently authored a
bill outlawing AIDS-based discrimination.
"The underlying premise is that a sick person
shouldn't he at the mercy of the uninformed,"

Wachs said of the law.
Hadden, a research assistant to state Sen.
David Roberti, dealt with the cost of the disease
and who pays for it.
The issue of who pays has aroused some con
troversy between the state and the insurance in
dustry, Hadden said.
Currently, insurance lobbyists are seeking to
abolish a law that prevents them from canceling
insurance policies for persons who have tested
positive for AIDS antibodies, according to Had
den.
The disease has far-reaching societal implica
tions, Volberding said. AIDS antibody testing
has helped research, but it has complicated mat
ters involving privacy and the insurance issue.
Last night's presentation was moderated by
Dr. Merton Bernfield, Knowles professor of
Human Biology and professor of pediatrics at
Stanford Medical School.
There will be another presentation today at 7
p.m. in Kresge Auditorium.
