# Constitution: Yes

Last spring, the Hammer and Coffin slate vowed
to abolish the senate and make the ASSU a true ser
vice organization. The proposed changes on the bal
lot would fulfill this promise. The benefits of reduc
ing the number of student government members —
and thus ending the bureaucratic slowdowns that
have plagued the student government in the past —
far outweigh the potential costs of implementing

more centralized representation. Furthermore,
eradicating cumbersome bylaws will enhance the ef
fectiveness of the ASSU. Objections to the elimina
tion of graduate district voting and other provisions
of the current bylaws can all be accommodated with
relative ease in any new bylaws written by the new
ASSU.
