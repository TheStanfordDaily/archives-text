# Nom Com Term: Yes
## 
### 
The existing term of Nominations Commission
members runs from spring to winter quarter, but
committee terms coincide with the academic year.
This descrepancy prevents members of University
committees from applying for the Nom Com for the
following year, automatically excluding experienced
committee members from participating in the selec
tion of new ones. The importance of the Nomina

tions Commission should not be underestimated â€”
it is responsible for choosing those who will serve
on decision-making bodies such as the Board of
Trustees Commission on Investment Responsibility
and the Committee on Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aids. We therefore urge approval of
this amendment.
