Although some fear a reduction of the Asso
ciation Fee to the detriment of small student
groups, the provision allowing students to deter
mine percentage changes in the base amount of the
fee only allows the student body at large to exercise
more influence over the total amount allocated. As
long as fair and representative Program and Publica
tion Boards are nominated and a reasonable range is

set for the percentage changes, this amendment
would be an appropriate measure of the general con
sensus on needed levels of funding. The quality of
student organizations and the events they sponsor
will be the greatest factors contributing to the stu
dent body's decision on how much funding should be
increased or decreased.
