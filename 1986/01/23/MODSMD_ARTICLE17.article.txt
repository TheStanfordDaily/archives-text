# ASSU Investment: No
## 
### 
The wording is confusing but the message is
clear: "We ain't gonna invest in South Africa." The
actual text of the referendum unfortunately states:
"Even though divestment might entail financial loss
to the Association and would involve removing the
ASSU's funds from the University's merged endow
ment pool, should the Association continue to invest
its funds, either directly or indirectly, in companies

which do business in South Africa?" This means a
vote of No signifies a vote for divestment. The old,
tired arguments against economic pressure as a
means to end apartheid peacefully are wearing thin.
Bishop Desmond Tutu asserts that if substantial
economic sanctions were levied against South
Africa, "Voila! Apartheid would be over in next to no
time."
