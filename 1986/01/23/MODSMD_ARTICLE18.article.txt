## Remember Soviet Jews 
### 
The exchange of greetings be
tween President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev to the
peoples of the United States and
the Soviet Union on New Year's
Day reminds us of the hope with
which the world looked to the No
vember summit meeting in Geneva
as the potential precursor to arms
limitation. However, relevant
human rights issues which should
be addressed by these two leaders
are too often lost among the paper
shuffling and media blitzing which
accompany the summits.
While Reagan and Gorbachev dis
cuss current issues and make good
will gestures, thousands of Jewish
families behind the Soviet iron cur
tain continue to fear for their religi
ous freedom and right to emigrate.
Since the peak of emigration in

VIEWPOINT

1979, when over 50,000 Jews were
allowed to leave for the West, the
Soviet government has become in
creasingly repressive in its treat
ment of Jewish citizens.
In 1984, only 893 Jews were
allowed to leave the Soviet Union.
These 893 represent but a small
fraction of the more than 383,000
Soviet Jews who have applied for
emigration visas. The vast majority
remaining in the Soviet Union are
known as "refuseniks," because
they have been refused the right to
emigrate.
Soviet Jews seek emigration
visas as a means of escaping the
slow but inexorable "war of attri
tion" that the Soviet government is
waging on their right to live and
worship. The government has
forced synagogues to close,
outlawed the teaching of the He
brew language and made the pos
session of books dealing with Israel

and Judaica a crime. The national
tenet of anti-Semitism pervades all
aspects of a refusenik's life. The
Jew encounters it at work, as he is
barred from good jobs and salaries.
He encounters it socially, as he and
his children are ostracized and
treated as second-class citizens.
The Soviet Jew has no assurance
of the protection of his rights as a
Soviet citizen and as a human being.
It is not unusual for a Jew to be
charged with fabricated crimes in
response to his desire to express
his religious and cultural convic
tions. For writing a letter to Chaim
Herzog, the president of Israel,
Alec Zelichonok was sentenced to
three years in a labor camp on Aug.
8, 1985.
On June 18, 1985, Yevgeny Koif
man, a 47-year old Hebrew
teacher, was arrested without a
warrant by KGB agents for the pos
session of "narcotics." The chief
prosecutor of the case later ad
mitted to the defendant's wife,
Lydia Koifman, that no narcotics
had been found, but that her hus
band would nonetheless remain im
prisoned. In May 1985, Dr.
Vladimir Brodsky, cardiologist and
peace activist, was arrested after
refusing to hand his passport to a
stranger in civilian clothes and then
taken to a militia post and charged
with "abusive language and physical
violence." On Aug. 15, with only
his wife Dina attending his trial, he
was sentenced to three years at
hard labor for "malicious
hooliganism."
What has precipitated these bru
tal human rights violations against
the Jews of the Soviet Union?
During the period of detente, the
leadership of the Soviet Union fol
lowed a looser emigration policy in
an effort to drain off the drive of the
Jewish movement. In response to

that policy, Jewish emigration
soared from 13,221 in 1975 to
51,320 in 1979, a result unforeseen
by the Soviet policy makers.
In a country which claims to be
on the road to social perfection, this
wave of emigration stood out as a
slap in the face to official Soviet
dogma. Just the fact that the Jews
want to leave and may be allowed to
do so is a strong criticism of Soviet
society. After all, if Soviet society
were perfect, why would its
citizens wish to leave?
As a result, the Soviet govern
ment decided to break the back of
the renascent Jewish movement.
Threats, imprisonment and
dramatically reduced emigration (in
contrast to the numbers awaiting
exit visas) constitute the new So
viet policy for the harmonious fit
ting of Soviet Jews into the "Soviet
fold." This renewal of oppression
proves once again that the Soviet
Union can never be a homeland to
its Jews while it denies them the
basic rights and opportunities of
free citizens.
Soviet Jews sit and wait behind
the shroud of Russian xenophobia,
shut off from the outside world
without knowing if they will ever
have a chance for freedom within
their lifetimes. They are dependent
upon those of us who are fortunate
enough to be able to voice our
opinions openly, without fear of
retribution. Let us all take this time
to make New Year's resolutions of
our own for 1986. Do not forget the
plight of Jews in the the Soviet
Union. Speak out, write, protest.
Our help is desperately needed.
