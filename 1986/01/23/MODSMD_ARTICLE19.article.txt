# Unite Against Racism
## 
### 
I have attended many rallies (some good, some not
so good), but few as inspiring as the Friday rally organ
ized by the Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan
(MEChA), which demonstrated the strength of a com
munity when it realizes its strength as a group.
The rally included speakers from Third World organ
izations and progressive groups here on campus. While
it specifically celebrated the unveiling of Casa Zapata's
newest mural, "The Spirit of Hoover," and the return of
MEChA as a student organization, the rally signified
much more. The messages of the speakers from
MEChA, the Asian American Student's Association,

the Black Student Union and the Stanford American In
dian Organization made it clear that Third World stu
dents on this campus have much in common. Each
group spoke of the particular issues facing it, but the
overwhelming theme of the program was the need for
unity among the various communities.
In the face of Reaganism and the conservative
onslaught, speakers spoke of the need to organize and
unite in order to combat attacks on Third World people
here in this country. The effects of a system literally
built on the backs of Third World people does not stop
at the border of the Stanford campus. The issues of
theme dorms, ethnic studies, the Western Culture re
quirement and the need to organize around these was
stressed by all. Progressive groups spoke of the need
to support actively those struggles.
The report by Hoover Institution Senior Research
Fellow John Bunzel on ethnic theme dorms attacks
theme houses for being separatist and implies that the
experiences of Third World people on this campus are
no different than those of anyone else. The essence of
this report invalidates the culture of Third World
people. Stanford did not even admit black students un
til 21 years ago, and Third World students are still very
under-represented. To deny the existence of theme
dorms would be to deny students the right to live and
thrive in surroundings which support and maintain their
cultural heritage.
It is not the responsibility of Third World students to
distribute themselves across campus as disseminators
of "cultural diversity." They are not here for the bene
fit of others. It is the responsibility of others to take it
upon themselves to learn about other cultures. The

first step toward that education is student understand
ing of this country's many attempts to destroy the cul
ture of those who were here before the white man and
those who were brought here to build the white man's
empire. We must understand that the maintenance of
strong and vital theme dorms — which represent the
centers of each community — are essential to a com
mitment to real diversity.
The University's "commitment" is further question
able because it refuses to really "make a difference" by
supporting ethnic studies departments on this campus.
Afro-American studies struggles to survive on a limited
budget. The Chicano Studies Department hardly exists,
with only one class being offered this quarter. The Uni
versity has not offered a class on Asian-Americans in
the past two years, and it was not until the Asian-
American community pressured the administration that
plans were made for one in the spring. How are Third
World students to study and learn about their history?
How are white students really to learn about other
cultures when this institution does not support ade
quate curriculums as well as provide incentives for stu
dents to take such classes?
While these departments suffer from lack of funds,
great amounts of money are being invested in the con
tinued expansion and development of the Western Cul
ture requirement. The tracks are taught as if nothing
else were going on at the time the "great works" were
written. The whole of western civilization arose out of
the traditions of Africa, but there is no mention of that.
Plato and Aristotle arise in a vacuum and serve as the
basis for civilized western thought. To assume that the
western culture is equivalent to world culture is arro
gant, racist and wrong. As students, we need to learn
about the culture of the majority of the people of the
world — or we will have learned an incomplete and dis
torted view of history.
It is clear that all students on this campus, Third
World and white, must call on the University to make
"cultural diversity" not only a promise but a reality.
Third World students daily must fight the reality of rac
ism. White students should respect their
struggle and support them in any way that we can. We
must reject the "missionary" attitude that we will win
their rights for them. Instead, we should respect their
independence and integrity and accept their leadership.
With this understanding, we should realize that we
have an important role to play in challenging the sys
tem which perpetuates such racism. I believe that a
student movement is made strong not by liquidating
our differences. Our strength comes from being united
against a common enemy and sharing a vision of a just
society. Each victory moves us all closer to realizing
this vision.
