The American Dream
"Let's drive across the country
on spring break," I said to my
roommates in a spasm of inspiration
a few weeks ago. "We'll take my
Volkswagen, drive like hell each
day, and then find some place to
sleep for free each night. Just think
of it: Grand Canyon, Dodge City,
Plymouth Rock, Badlands. We'll hit
them all."
"No doing," Greg said. Dave just
ignored me. "Are you ever going to
change the record?" he moaned.
"There are no visionaries in
America anymore," I snapped, and
flipped the record.
But 1 was wrong.
There are visionaries still. The
sort of people who understand what
it is to be an American. Not in the
Rambo and Ronbo sort of way, but
in the real way. Highways. Hot
dogs. Budweiser. Baseball.
UC-Santa Barbara students Pat
Tracey and Kent Foster know what
I mean. I've never met them, but I
can tell.
"Before we did it, everybody
laughed at us and said it couldn't be
done," Tracey told the Daily
Nexus. "I didn't have a driver's
license, we didn't have places to
stay. It was pretty much stupid."
That didn't stop them.
On Sept. 1, they loaded up their
VW with their belongings and their
baseball caps, and they took off for
San Francisco and Candlestick
Park.
Twenty-four days, 15 cities and
20 baseball games later, they
returned to Santa Barbara, their vi
sionary trek across America — the

real America — complete.
"We planned it in a night," one of
our heroes remembered. "We sat
down with all the schedules of all
the teams." They wanted to see
baseball and see the country and do
it quickly and do it in a car. If that
isn't American, I don't know what
is.
They traveled clockwise around
the United States and into Canada,
where imitation Americans play im
itation baseball. They visited
Yankee and Shea and Fenway and
Wrigley. They always sat in the
cheap seats, and they never stayed
in hotels.
They conned toll-takers to let
them cross bridges for free. They
conned parking attendants to let
them park for free. They conned
distant acquaintances to let them
stay at their homes for free.
"Sure, I'd do something stupid
like that again," Tracey said.
And if he does, I'm going with
him.
On To Trivia
"We're learning to meet the
needs of our target market by
taking classroom theories and in
corporating them into the project."
Is it a law now that you have to
talk stupid to make money?
But that's not the point here.
A group of resume-packing pre
professionals who call themselves
the Bowling Green State chapter of
the American Marketing Associa
tion have put together a Bowling
State Trivia Game. (Not to be
confused, of course, with the Trivia
State Bowling Game.)

Great questions on this game.
How about this one: The grounds
crew at old Bowling Alley State
removes 2,200 tons of which sub
stance from the campus each year?
Trash, snow, leaves, or beer cans?
Give up? It's trash.
Pretty exciting stuff, huh?
It took 315 members of this mar
keting club to come up with ques
tions like this one. And that just
goes to show you that your first in
clination was probably right:
Bowling Green State is pretty
trivial too.
Other Stories
It's a weak week in the world of
the college press. It's the usual
stuff: students are fighting for di
vestment, administrators are
fearing federal budget cuts, and
someone is telling the Texas frater
nities that they'd better cut back on
drinking.
The more things change, the

more things stay the same.
I've been doing this column, off
and on, for a couple of years now.
This will probably be the last time
around for me, the last night of
coming in late and having a features
editor bark, "The papers are over
there. And put my name on it too
this time so we both get paid."
Bigger and better things, you
know.
That's all for now.
