# ASSU NEWS

Back to the Future Dept., vol. 1: Seems as though the race
to rebuild Rome and take the reigns of power is underway
indeed; an unwieldly number of shady looking characters have
been testing the presidential waters in and around the ASSU
Fortress of Power lately. A certain Senate Chair and a well
known senatorette with a penchant for Guys with Gavels have
been seen nobbing hobs rather frequently lately — but is it only
politics that draws them together? There are those who foresee
the muscle-bound midwestern mogul and the Maryland mini
ature Miss casting longing glances over a sprightly Cabernet at
the Good Earth . . . Also Ran: Just when you thought that the
Press were those people who write newspapers, what happens
but one of 'em decides he'd like to make the news instead of
misinterpret it. That's right, Stanford's former political reporter —
sporting a particularly natty head of recently purchased curls —
has been seen courting both Mr. Chair and Chair Jr. . . . Akin to
Sam Donaldson running for surgeon general, mumble some old
hands from the badlands, throwing sloppy darts and taking that
first long look into the Kleid-O-Scope . . .
Heard in the Halls of Power: Seems that a certain member
of the Council of Presidents who narrowly avoided a jail term for
contempt of court (after wadding up his Notice to Appear and
tossing it at the baliff) is once again questioning his ever
fluctuating sexuality. Latest Rumour: He's a lesbian trapped in
a man's body, wanting to meet a nice girl but afraid that his
desires aren't socially acceptable . . . Whaddaya Know? Seems
that there's an interesting idea floating about in regard to that
nutty campus activist who takes his name from a loud, inefficient
engine without sparkplugs. Appears that there's a move afoot to
protest his presence at the University, since no one was able to
submit opposing statements to the Dean of Admissions . . . And in
the opposite corner, the Dean of Dean Affairs. He played a few
rounds of blind-man's-bluff and then sat down to interpret the
New Constitution, avec blindfold . . .
By the Way, wasn't it that oh-so-beloved Tresidder Food Ser
vice Lackey (last reported ordering another dozen warehouse
loads of all-purpose Egg Puff), calling everyone from the Health
Department to the Canadian Mounties trying desperately to rub
out student initiative altogether and squash the Espresso Bar —
blazing back for another quarter and making the fatal mistake of
being far more popular and entertaining than the Official Coffee
House, which I've heard now requires a Faculty ID or Proof of In
solence to be admitted. But then, my hearing's not what it once
was.
