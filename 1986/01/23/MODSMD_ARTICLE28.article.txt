# PLANS I MAKE

"The best laid plans of mice and men gang aft agley." I don't
know what it means, either. But it sure sounds nice. Ideas, ideas,
we got ideas. Listen:
* ON-LINE COURSE GUIDE
Why kill trees? We're thinking about putting the ASSU Course
Guide into the Socrates system, storing all the student reviews of
classes on-line. That way, anytime you want to read all the nasty
things people wrote about their professors, you can just go to the
Library terminals, Lots, or dial in from home. Wow, the cutting
edge of technology. Comes damn close to making you think. We
could store bazillions of class reviews in there and save money on
printing costs. It's the dawning of a new era. Da-da!
* BLOW UP TRESIDDER AND BUILD SOMEPLACE FUN ON
ITS RUBBLE
The ASSU Army Bureau of Covert Operations recently
revealed a plan to invade the community union, level the offend
ing structure with bazookas, and set up a student junta.
If that doesn't work, there's a plan to re-develop Tresidder,
anyhow. They want to enlarge the Coffee House, enclose the
staircases, divide up the airport lounge downstairs, get rid of Lots
11, build student office spaces, and on and on. Sounds pretty darn
exciting, doesn't it? Especially that bit about the staircases.
Well, we've got ideas of our own. Carey White and Mary Thur
ber are going to talk to the powers-that-shouldn't-be about put
ting in:
— A Real Pub.
— A Ballroom/dancehall with a weekend d.j.,
soundsystem, lights, videos, free coke.
— A room for Big-Screen sports and Movies (just like yer
local bar)
— Priority to student groups for use of all the space
— Most Important: Long-term student share in control
of new construction.
Like, we pay to be here, whereas everyone else gets paid to be
here. Is a place where we can enjoy ourselves too much to ask for
$15,000,000,000,000,000,000 a year?
* STUDENT PARTY FUND
We never give money to anything fun. Hell, we never give
money to anything. But that's beside the point. The Student Af
fairs Committee wants to set up a Special Fee for parties next
year. Real Parties. You pay a buck or two a year and we get real
bands and real beer. You don't think that sounds like fun? Well,
you've obviously never seen a senator dance. Believe me, Eric
Berg gets down. Watch Jim McGrath shake. It's worth a buck. So
vote for it.
