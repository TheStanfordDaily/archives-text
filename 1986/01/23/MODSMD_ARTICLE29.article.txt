# Don Kennedy Sent Me To Jail
## 
### 
As should already be widely known, on October 11, nine Stan
ford students staged a peaceful sit-in at Old Union. These students
appear to have been the victims of police brutality. After a subse
quent protest of police behavior, University President Donald Ken
nedy appointed Law Professor John Kaplan to prepare a report
about the event. Many felt this report was characterized by bias in
both the analysis and the prescription.
In response to community concern, the ASSU set up a Special
Investigative Committee to look into the events and to find an
outside investigator to avoid the bias that marred the Kaplan
report. That committee is composed of undergraduate and
graduate students, professors, staff members, and members of the
ASSU Senate.
The committee determined that there should be a standing body
to deal with issues such as these on a regular basis. The committee
recommended, and the Senate supported without dissent, the es
tablishment of a permanent police review commission to ex
amine the actions of the Stanford Police Department. The
police review commission will be composed of students,
staff, faculty, USW representatives, administrators and
others from outside the Stanford community.
We feel that the presence of such a review commission will dis
courage police brutality, harrassment of minorities and other
abuses of police authority.
The Senate further charged the committee to locate an outside
investigator and to do any fund raising necessary to allow contin
ued probing into the incidents of October 11 at both Old Union and
the North County Jail facility.
To the Stanford Community
We need your support to establish a permanent police
review commission. We have written President Donald
Kennedy and contacted the Chair of the Faculty Senate: in
the next few weeks the University will be deciding
whether or not to support the idea of a police review com
mission. It's urgent that they know the Stanford commu
nity wants to see a review commission established before
they make their decision.
At the same time we will be raising money for a fair,
outside investigation into the alleged brutality incidents.
Without such an investigation we may never know the
truth, and we will certainly not know it before long months
or years have passed and the case has come to trial. By then
the problem will have been quietly swept under the rug.
We urge you to support the establishment of a review
commission and the funding of an investigation. We will be
bringing speakers, selling T-shirts, holding rallies, showing
films; we will do whatever we can. And if you participate,
we will succeed. If you have a few minutes of your time or
have a dollar or two you would like to contribute, please
contact us at the ASSU at 497-4331, or call John van Loben
Sels (323-4379) or Carey White (326-3473).
