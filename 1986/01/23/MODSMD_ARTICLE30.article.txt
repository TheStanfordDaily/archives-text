# 'Twice in a Lifetime' Not To Be Seen Once
## 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
! "Twice in a Lifetime" is so unbelievably bad, it
makes the jokes about its lasting a lifetime seem inade
quate. Other critics have been comparing it (glowingly)
with "Terms of Endearment," and though "Twice in a
Lifetime" is a much worse movie, it has the same kind
of television-inspired characters and the same loaded,
heart-warming situations.
What "Twice in a Lifetime" doesn't have is
"Terms' " acting to redeem it. The movie stars Gene
Hackman, who, when he's wrong for a role, is much
worse in that role than many other, less talented actors
would be. The earliest moments of "Twice in a
Lifetime take place at his character's birthday party,
and Hackman plays the scene as if he had a bit of food
stuck between his teeth. It's one of those joking family
get-togethers from television, and when Hackman has
to respond to all of the elaborately set-up crosstalk and
warm family chitchat, his timing goes completely off,
and every expression is too big or out of place.
Although he maintains a core of reserve throughout
the movie, in the early parts of "Twice in a Lifetime"
Hackman seems on the verge of doing something really
flamboyant and comic (you can see his Lex Luthor
character from the "Superman" films just beneath the
surface). It's the sign of a fine, energetic actor looking
for something more in a role than it has to offer. The
movie is about the kind of people who get excited over
guessing the price of the Kellogg's Pop Tarts on "The
Price is Right," so it's really not much of an embarrass
ment that Hackman can't do anything with the material.
Jack Nicholson wouldn't be able to play this role
(seriously); Brando would give it so much depth he
would destroy the picture.
• "Twice in a Lifetime" is about Harry (Hackman), a
Seattle steelworker who leaves his wife, Kate (Ellen
Burstyn) for the local barmaid, Audrey (Ann-Margret).
The movie sets up Harry as the dissatisfied husband
and then goes to elaborate lengths to show that he isn't
really fed up with his dutiful wife and family or the ag
gressively middle-class values they represent. He just
"wasn't fulfilled" by his marriage anymore, and Kate
soon comes to realize that she wasn't either.
; If Harry had come truly to hate his dreary family and
job and lifestyle, then his leaving might generate some
real tension. But this is the Reagan era of happy
homes, so Harry is really right, and after some obliga
tory heartbreak and moping, everyone comes to
realize this, except his daughter Sonny (Amy

Madigan). But Madigan is so obnoxious we can't take
her seriously anyway.
Director Bud Yorkin and screenwriter Colin Welland
use 70s self-analysis pedantry to justify '50s (and '80s)
small-town family and community cliches, making the
movie a truly intolerable hybrid. The three main char
acters are constantly analyzing their needs and the
needs of those around them and darned if they don't
know just what's right for everyone. The supporting
characters act as a sort of Greek chorus to the prin
cipals. The bar at which Harry hangs out is so full of
boisterous patrons (they're the modern equivalents of

hearty peasants), it makes those bars on beer com
mercials look like morgues by comparison; the menfolk
arm wrestle, slap each other around and exchange con
vivial four-letter words. These scenes are here to
show us how incredibly well-loved Harry is, and his
every witticism is greeted with raucous laughter.
These scenes also show us what Harry really wants in
a woman, for every gal in the bar is just one of the
guys, and the best sport of all is Audrey, who throws
out her arms and demands a big wet kiss for Harry's
birthday (if this were a comedy, she would be a jovial,
fat German hausfrau).

Audrey and Harry's relationship develops quickly,
but he's too nice of a guy to keep it from Kate; Kate's
shattered, but of course she will pull through. The
movie is so rotten up to this point, it comes as no
surprise that the filmmakers start leaving out the key
scenes. They cut away from Kate's finding out about
the affair from a friend, they cut away from Harry and
Kate's first confrontation ("Kate, we have to talk
. . ."), and we don't see the scene where his family
finds out. This is TV discreteness: avoid all ugly emo
tions, because they may upset people and then they
won't buy the sponsor's product. "Twice in a Lifetime"
is selling its pop psycho-platitudes, which are at their
ripest when Audrey and Harry meet at his workplace
and have exchanges like, "Is it worth it? Yes, we love
life again," and "You're my round, sweet-smelling
female."
With lines like that and with a director who holds a
character in unrelenting close-up in the hopes of catch
ing emotional truth, the actors are crippled from the
outset. Still, Madigan and Burstyn act as if they believe
in the material, which is a critical mistake. Burstyn's
Kate is drippy-devoted in the first half of the movie (no
one smiles through tears like Burstyn), but once she
realizes that she's "got to live again" and "just needed
time to grow," she grows as a person by getting her
hair dyed, having her ears pierced, winning at bingo
and going to a male strip joint (where she giggles like a
schoolgirl). She becomes a happy, adventurous, white
bread, middle-class, still-devoted-to-her-husband
housewife, and we know she'll live again when she
starts taking classes at the local college.
Madigan's Sonny is the only character who doesn't
see that Dad's leaving is for the best, so she pouts and
looks hurt a lot and stomps and yells when Harry's
around. Madigan reveals no shadings, no vulnerability
in her character, because there aren't any in the script;
she's the kind of conscientious performer who's
doomed in pictures like this. In the minor roles, Brian
Dennehy, as Nick, comes off the best, because he's
the most subdued, and he looks slightly embarrassed
whenever he enters a scene.
Are times so bad that critics feel obligated to place
any movie that hints at adult themes on their Top 10
lists? This "Terms of the Ordinary Kramers" drivel
practically begs for Oscars with its sincerity and solid
American values. Yorkin and Welland put all their char
acters on a pedestal, so that formerly disenchanted
Harry comes back to his daughter Helen's wedding and
sees that, yes, his family has matured and it is good.
The take-home message of this movie is: Father
knows best, even when father bails out.

. . ."), and we don't see the scene where his family
finds out. This is TV discreteness: avoid all ugly emo
tions, because they may upset people and then they
won't buy the sponsor's product. "Twice in a Lifetime"
is selling its pop psycho-platitudes, which are at their
ripest when Audrey and Harry meet at his workplace
and have exchanges like, "Is it worth it? Yes, we love
life again," and "You're my round, sweet-smelling
female."
With lines like that and with a director who holds a
character in unrelenting close-up in the hopes of catch
ing emotional truth, the actors are crippled from the
outset. Still, Madigan and Burstyn act as if they believe
in the material, which is a critical mistake. Burstyn's
Kate is drippy-devoted in the first half of the movie (no
one smiles through tears like Burstyn), but once she
realizes that she's "got to live again" and "just needed
time to grow," she grows as a person by getting her
hair dyed, having her ears pierced, winning at bingo
and going to a male strip joint (where she giggles like a
schoolgirl). She becomes a happy, adventurous, white
bread, middle-class, still-devoted-to-her-husband
housewife, and we know she'll live again when she
starts taking classes at the local college.
Madigan's Sonny is the only character who doesn't
see that Dad's leaving is for the best, so she pouts and
looks hurt a lot and stomps and yells when Harry's
around. Madigan reveals no shadings, no vulnerability
in her character, because there aren't any in the script;
she's the kind of conscientious performer who's
doomed in pictures like this. In the minor roles, Brian
Dennehy, as Nick, comes off the best, because he's
the most subdued, and he looks slightly embarrassed
whenever he enters a scene.
Are times so bad that critics feel obligated to place
any movie that hints at adult themes on their Top 10
lists? This "Terms of the Ordinary Kramers" drivel
practically begs for Oscars with its sincerity and solid
American values. Yorkin and Welland put all their char
acters on a pedestal, so that formerly disenchanted
Harry comes back to his daughter Helen's wedding and
sees that, yes, his family has matured and it is good.
The take-home message of this movie is: Father
knows best, even when father bails out.


Gene Hackman (Harry) and Ann-Margret (Audrey) embrace in "Twice in a Lifetime," produced
and directed by Bud Yorkin. The film explores the reaction of Harry's family to his affair with
Audrey.
! "Twice in a Lifetime" is so unbelievably bad, it
makes the jokes about its lasting a lifetime seem inade
quate. Other critics have been comparing it (glowingly)
with "Terms of Endearment," and though "Twice in a
Lifetime" is a much worse movie, it has the same kind
of television-inspired characters and the same loaded,
heart-warming situations.
What "Twice in a Lifetime" doesn't have is
"Terms' " acting to redeem it. The movie stars Gene
Hackman, who, when he's wrong for a role, is much
worse in that role than many other, less talented actors
would be. The earliest moments of "Twice in a
Lifetime take place at his character's birthday party,
and Hackman plays the scene as if he had a bit of food
stuck between his teeth. It's one of those joking family
get-togethers from television, and when Hackman has
to respond to all of the elaborately set-up crosstalk and
warm family chitchat, his timing goes completely off,
and every expression is too big or out of place.
Although he maintains a core of reserve throughout
the movie, in the early parts of "Twice in a Lifetime"
Hackman seems on the verge of doing something really
flamboyant and comic (you can see his Lex Luthor
character from the "Superman" films just beneath the
surface). It's the sign of a fine, energetic actor looking
for something more in a role than it has to offer. The
movie is about the kind of people who get excited over
guessing the price of the Kellogg's Pop Tarts on "The
Price is Right," so it's really not much of an embarrass
ment that Hackman can't do anything with the material.
Jack Nicholson wouldn't be able to play this role
(seriously); Brando would give it so much depth he
would destroy the picture.
• "Twice in a Lifetime" is about Harry (Hackman), a
Seattle steelworker who leaves his wife, Kate (Ellen
Burstyn) for the local barmaid, Audrey (Ann-Margret).
The movie sets up Harry as the dissatisfied husband
and then goes to elaborate lengths to show that he isn't
really fed up with his dutiful wife and family or the ag
gressively middle-class values they represent. He just
"wasn't fulfilled" by his marriage anymore, and Kate
soon comes to realize that she wasn't either.
; If Harry had come truly to hate his dreary family and
job and lifestyle, then his leaving might generate some
real tension. But this is the Reagan era of happy
homes, so Harry is really right, and after some obliga
tory heartbreak and moping, everyone comes to
realize this, except his daughter Sonny (Amy

Madigan). But Madigan is so obnoxious we can't take
her seriously anyway.
Director Bud Yorkin and screenwriter Colin Welland
use 70s self-analysis pedantry to justify '50s (and '80s)
small-town family and community cliches, making the
movie a truly intolerable hybrid. The three main char
acters are constantly analyzing their needs and the
needs of those around them and darned if they don't
know just what's right for everyone. The supporting
characters act as a sort of Greek chorus to the prin
cipals. The bar at which Harry hangs out is so full of
boisterous patrons (they're the modern equivalents of

hearty peasants), it makes those bars on beer com
mercials look like morgues by comparison; the menfolk
arm wrestle, slap each other around and exchange con
vivial four-letter words. These scenes are here to
show us how incredibly well-loved Harry is, and his
every witticism is greeted with raucous laughter.
These scenes also show us what Harry really wants in
a woman, for every gal in the bar is just one of the
guys, and the best sport of all is Audrey, who throws
out her arms and demands a big wet kiss for Harry's
birthday (if this were a comedy, she would be a jovial,
fat German hausfrau).

Audrey and Harry's relationship develops quickly,
but he's too nice of a guy to keep it from Kate; Kate's
shattered, but of course she will pull through. The
movie is so rotten up to this point, it comes as no
surprise that the filmmakers start leaving out the key
scenes. They cut away from Kate's finding out about
the affair from a friend, they cut away from Harry and
Kate's first confrontation ("Kate, we have to talk
. . ."), and we don't see the scene where his family
finds out. This is TV discreteness: avoid all ugly emo
