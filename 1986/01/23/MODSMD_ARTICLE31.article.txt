Bangles — "Different Light"
★★★★
You can have yer Bananarama
and yer Flirts, and even yer Go
; Go's; we'll take the Bangles any
day. You say, "OK, sure, so you
guys know everything about music.
But what makes the Bangles so
•neat?" Well, first, thanks for the
icompliment. And second, we know
;the Bangles are great because
they're fun, they're clean, they
rock, and their music isn't inane like
a lot of fem-wave is. It is catchy,
danceable and enjoyable whether

played loud or soft. The guitar-
coo) : f"9Qk. antf four-part
Bangle harmonies are as immedi
ately attractive as ever; Susanna
Hoffs' lead vocals are still the best,
and the whole band's hip yet
humble attitude keeps it from
being nauseating like other former
art-garage bands. Their psych
edelic tendencies are all but gone,
except for a few Beatles-style rem
nants and some rumors of
Susanna's premature death (album
cover clues include: the boldfaced
letters DETH in the album's title;
the fact that all front cover photos
of Susanna are in black and white;
and the boldfaced letters in the
band's name, BGS, obviously stand
for Bus Got Susanna.) All National
Enquirer leads aside, though, this
most solid effort is unique, modern,
well-written pop-and-roll that will
hopefully boost the group well past
the wannabees who deserve the
fame 'n' fortune a lot less.
The Cult — "Love"
★ ★★
If you're the type of guy (or gal)

The rating scale: from one to five stars, with five being the best
Selected cuts from these albums will be played on KZSU tomorrow at 6 p.m.

who gets into post-punk groups
wjjh IgajJ singers who screech 'n'
wail arid have record covers full of
pseudo-artistic icons and weird
typefaces, then you are in what we
at the Picks Field Research Con
sortium would classify as The Cult's
"target audience subsegment"
(TASS). Of course, not everyone is
hip enough to be a member of The
Cult's TASS. The rest of us should
be content to listen to the features
of the group's sound that set it
apart from your run-of-the-mill,
post-punk-variety kinda stuff. The
Cult may not be many people's cup
o' tea, but their music is more
palatable than groups such as, say,
The Damned or the Sisters of
Mercy. The Cult's sound and psych
edelic/native American imagery
are new also new 'n' refreshing (to
pop music). The group is not with
out plenty of weaknesses,
however. Their style, combined
with some of lead singer lan
Astbury's more obnoxious wailing
moments, is tiresome and
headache-provoking, and too much
of the record is preoccupied with
The Cult's dark, too-guitary semi

dronitude. Nevertheless, it's
worthwhile for occasional listening
and hits upon a distinctive sound
that most "alternative" groups
would kill for.
The Golden Palominos —
"Visions of Excess"
★ ★★★
OK. Now I think we got this
straight. The Golden Palominos are
a band, even though this seems like
a compilation album. What a lazy,
stupid band. I mean, they had to
have help from all kinds of people to
put this thing out. They hardly
wrote any of the songs. Look at the
first three tracks — is this R.E.M.
or what? Sure they're good songs,
but if R.E.M. vocalist Michael Stipe
helped write your tunes, and then
sang them, and then got guitar guru
Richard Thompson to play, you'd
sound damn good, too. Listen to
the next one. Is this Public Image,
Ltd. or what? I don't care if it is one
of John Lydon's (a.k.a. Johnny Rot
ten) better songs. Go ahead and
buy it. You want to know how he
starts out that song? He burps. Not

an ordinary burp — he rears up to
the microphone and burps like a
cow exploding. It's art, man. Right.
Then what? Thompson's still
playing guitars and now Jack Bruce
(ex-Cream) does vocals. Of course
the song is good, but then who needs
the frigging Palominos? All they do
is play drums and bass. OK, some
guitars, too. OK, so they do sing on
the last three songs. And they're
good songs. They're still parasites.
Scummy opportunistic no-names.
Fine. We'll just go get Eddie Van
Halen for our album. . . .
Fine Young Cannibals — "Fine
Young Cannibals"
★★
F.Y.C. is composed of two
former members of The (Almighty)
English Beat, along with Roland
Gift, who does the "singing." This
"singing" isn't the normal type of
melodic stuff we're all used to. It's
that rare brand of grating vocal
style that can alienate even hard
ened college radio listeners like
you. It's difficult to describe; per
haps if Elvis Costello were run

through a food processor he might
make these sounds before his
gruesome, Gremlinesque demise.
Most of the time, Gift is the worst
part of the group. Jimmy Somerville
(Bronski Beat) narrowly beats him
out with a guest vocal appearance
on a cover of "Suspicious Minds."
As for the rest of the music
(veteran record reviewers can
mentally drown out bad vocals), it's
not so great, either. It's post-ska all
right, the Beat guitar and bass are
still there. But something is gone
— there doesn't seem to be any
kind of creative energy or inspira
tion in any of the music. Every song
limps along for three minutes until it
mercifully ends. Those serious
types among you who like the
"sophisticated" Style Council more
than The Jam might like this as
well. The rest of us fun-lovin' types
can party down in the past or at
least settle for General Public.
