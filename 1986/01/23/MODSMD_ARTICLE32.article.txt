## UCLA To Play at Maples Tonight Card Faces Injuries And Bruin Tradition 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
You've got to wonder where it's going to stop.
Two weeks ago, the Stanford men's basketball team
learned senior guard Steve Brown would miss the rest
of the season with a stress fracture. Sunday, the Card
inal learned that torn ligaments in his right knee had
ended the season for senior forward Earl Koberlein.
And then UCLA, for years the dominant force in
West Coast basketball, comes into Maples Pavilion
tonight to face the hobbled Cardinal.
The Bruins still carry the legend of their name, but
the dominance has since faded, as Washington, Oregon
State and USC have all won Pacific 10 Conference
titles in the past few years. UCLA comes into Maples
with a 3-2 conference record, 8-5 overall, tied for
fourth place with California.
Yet the Bruins still carry on some of the legacy of
the teams that won 10 NCAA championships in the 12
years between 1964 and 1975. After being overlooked
last season for an NCAA bid, UCLA went to the Na
tional Invitational Tournament and won it with a 65-62
victory over Indiana to cap a 21-12 season.
Junior forward Reggie Miller was named the Most
Outstanding Player of the NIT and has gone on this
season to average 24.7 points per game, including 27.2
points for his five Pac-10 games. The skinny (6-foot-7,
177 pounds) Miller is, however, better known as the
brother of USC All-America forward Cheryl Miller.
Others that Coach Walt Hazzard has depended on
this year are junior guard Montel Hatcher (16.8 points
per game) and Pooh Richardson, a freshman guard
from Philadelphia who is averaging 10.2 points and 6.8
assists per game.
If there's any good news for the Cardinal, it's that
junior guard Novian Whitsitt is expected to return to
action tonight. Whitsitt has missed the Cardinal's last
four games with a pulled back muscle.
Freshman Todd Lichti, Stanford's top scorer so far
at 16.6 points per game, is expected to start at the No.
2 guard position again tonight, despite Whitsitt's
return. Andy Fischer will then start at small forward.
The loss of Koberlein leaves a hole coming off the
bench up front. Greg Butler will start in place of
Koberlein, leaving little-used freshman Bryan
McSweeney (under three minutes per game) and soph
omore Eric Reveno (seven minutes per game) in
reserve. A
In their last outing, the Bruins lost a non-conference
