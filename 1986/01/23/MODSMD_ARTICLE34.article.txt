# Freshman Wright At Top of His Class
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Staff writer 
Freshman Howard Wright is already a veteran of the
NBA.
But Stanford basketball fans need not fear for the 6-
foot-8 center's NCAA eligibility.
Wright's NBA experience came when he was 12
years old, as a ball boy for his hometown team, the
then-San Diego Clippers.
That wasn't his first exposure to professional ath-

letes, either. Wright's
father, Ernie, was an
All-Pro offensive tackle
for the NFL's San Diego
Chargers and Cincinnati
Bengals.
Stanford Coach Tom
Davis thinks that had an
impact on the younger
Wright.
"One advantage
Howard has is that his
father was a pro athlete.
He has seen what sports
is about," Davis said.
Certainly, Wright's
play this season has

shown that he knows what basketball is about. He has
become a fixture in the Cardinal lineup, starting all but
two games thus far, while averaging nine points and
seven rebounds per game.
Wright's rebounding statistics put him in the top 10
in the Pacific 10 Conference in that category. He's also
second in the conference in blocked shots. No mean
feats for a freshman.
But not completely unexpected, either. Wright came
to Stanford with sparkling high school credentials. In
his senior year at San Diego's Patrick Henry High
School (the same school attended by senior teammate
Steve Brown), Wright averaged 20.2 points, 13
rebounds and four blocked shots per game.
He led his team to the semifinals of the San Diego
County post-season tournament and was named
County Player of the Year by the Los Angeles Times.
In the summer before that senior year, Wright had
met NBA veteran Kermit Washington, who was living
in San Diego at-the time. The two worked out to-

. . attitude picked up
gether, and Wright found the experience
very helpful.
"My attitude and confidence really picked
up," he said.
Later that summer, Washington was
named to an assistant coaching position at
Stanford. Washington, however, downplays
his role in Wright's arrival on the Farm.
"I told him to go where he wants to go,"
said Washington. "But I also told him that
you can't beat a good educational system —
that's something I learned while in the
NBA."
Wright was contacted by most of the
major basketball schools, but said that

"none showed the sincere interest that
Stanford did."
"I felt so confident with the atmosphere
here," he said. "And they don't just expect
the minimum from you as a student.
There's a demand on me to be both a stu
dent and an athlete, and that means some
thing.
"Regardless of how well I do in
basketball here, I think the reward will be
the diploma."
Wright shouldn't have too many worries
about how well he will do in basketball at
Stanford. He has already proven this year
that he can play at the major college level
— his statistics attest to that. He has all the
ingredients for greatness: size, quickness,
agility, and what Washington calls "innate
athletic ability."

Perhaps most importantly, Wright has an
outstanding basketball mind.
"Howard is a very intelligent basketball
player," Davis said. "He might be as willing
a student of the game, as keen a learner, as
anyone I've ever seen. He's so willing to
work at everything."
Co-captain Andy Fischer concurs:
"Howard's a really bright player. That
might be his biggest plus, added to his great
athletic ability," Fischer said.
For now, the team looks to Wright
primarily for rebounding and shot-blocking,
two roles he has fulfilled admirably.
"He has added a different dimension at
the center position," said sophomore
teammate Eric Reveno. "He's not a tall
center, but he's a quick leaper, a very good
rebounder."

In the future, Wright will probably
assume an expanded scoring role for the
Cardinal.
"If he wants to work on his offensive
game, he's going to be a good scorer,"
Davis said.
"His offense has been surprisingly
good," Fischer said. "He could score at will
because he can get the ball at will."
Wright sees room for improvement in his
own game, and foresees a promising future
for the Stanford team.
"I have to keep my intensity up," he said.
"At Stanford, I've trimmed the minutes
played in a game, but the quality is better."
The quality ofWright's play, coupled with
that of the other members of a stellar fresh
man recruiting class, already has visions of

Pac-10 contention dancing in the heads of
Stanford fans.
Wright shares the fans' optimism about
the team's future.
"We're a year away from being probably
one of the best teams Stanford has ever
had," he says. "We're a really young team."
As for his career after Stanford, Wright
isn't giving it a lot of thought yet.
"Once I get my diploma, anything that
comes after that would be icing on the
cake," he says. "Of course I'd love to play
pro ball if I got the chance."
Washington, for one, thinks Wright will
get the chance.
"I'm sure he'll get drafted into the pros,"
says Washington. "How high is up to him."
