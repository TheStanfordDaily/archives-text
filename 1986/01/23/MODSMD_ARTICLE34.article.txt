# Freshman Wright At Top of His Class

### CHRIS MYERS Staff writer 
Freshman Howard Wright is already a veteran of the
NBA.
But Stanford basketball fans need not fear for the 6-
foot-8 center's NCAA eligibility.
Wright's NBA experience came when he was 12

become a fixture in the Cardinal lineup, starting all but

seven rebounds per game.
Wright's rebounding statistics put him in the top 10
in the Pacific 10 Conference in that category. He's also
second in the conference in blocked shots. No mean
feats for a freshman.
But not completely unexpected, either. Wright came
to Stanford with sparkling high school credentials. In
his senior year at San Diego's Patrick Henry High
School (the same school attended by senior teammate
Steve Brown), Wright averaged 20.2 points, 13
rebounds and four blocked shots per game.
He led his team to the semifinals of the San Diego
County post-season tournament and was named
County Player of the Year by the Los Angeles Times.
In the summer before that senior year, Wright had
met NBA veteran Kermit Washington, who was living
in San Diego at-the time. The two worked out to-
