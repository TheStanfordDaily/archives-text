## There's a California Town That Always Supports New England 
### 
WALNUT GROVE (AP) — Some 29 miles
southwest of Sacramento — and a few might
say a thousand miles southwest of the 20th
century — sits a cluster of buildings along the
banks of the muddy Sacramento River.

This could have been the setting for Andy
Griffith's Mayberry. There are no fast-food
franchises here, no rush-hour traffic jams, no
neon lights to brighten the skies. Just hard
working folks and familiar faces. Life is easy.
Out-of-towners should be warned to turn
their clocks back 50 years when arriving. But
a kindred spirit unites the 760 people who call
Walnut Grove home.
Locals gather at Alma's Cafe — "Where
The Elite Meet To Eat" — for breakfast,
lunch, coffee and conversation. Everybody

knows "Mighty Mo" Morais, who runs The
Liquor Store, Gail Perry down at the post of
fice and Rhea Arlin of the Style Cellar.
'We're laid back here, easy-going people,"
says Mighty Mo. "I don't even lock my door
at night."
But every so often, this burg is stirred into
a frenzy.
In 1982, state Sen. John Garamendi ran
against Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley in
the Democratic gubernatorial primary.
"The senator lives right across the river,"
Mighty Mo says."He lost out, but we were
with him all the way. He's one of our points of
interest."
Last autumn, Humphrey The Whale
splashed nearby. "Business really picked
up," Mighty Mo says.
And earlier last year, after a group of mer
chants purchased a parcel of land along the
downtown strip, several safes were discov
ered buried in the ground.
"Everyone was pretty excited wondering

what was inside," said Joe Enos, a
realtor. "We all figured there'd be
some bucks." He puts his index
finger and thumb together and
forms a zero. "Nothing," he said.
"There was nothing inside."
Now Walnut Grove is in a frenzy
again.
This is Tony Eason country.
And if you do not know who Tony
Eason is, well, just stop anyone on
the street. The New England
Patriots starting quarterback in
Super Bowl XX against the Chicago
Bears Sunday is Walnut Grove's fa
vorite son.

Eason grew up here and played
football just down the road at Delta
High in Clarksburg, right near the
sugar factory. He is still held in high
esteem.
"We get tourists in here," says
Vic Savale, who owns Alma's Cafe,
"and they hear us talking about
Tony. "They say, 'Who's Tony
Eason?' Believe me, by the time
they leave they know all about
him."
You'd never know this is San
Francisco 49er territory. Walnut
Grove has been painted red, white
and blue — the Patriots' colors.
Window shopping has become al
most impossible. Store fronts are
decorated with paintings of the

Patriots' No. 11 tossing a football.
Bumper stickers read: "Live in
the Delta. . . Where Living is
Eason."
In the next few days, downtown
Walnut Grove will get another coat
of red, white and blue. Students at
a local elementary school are
drawing posters in a Super Bowl
motif. The posters will be judged
and hung in shops and on city
streets in time for Saturday's
parade.
The parade. Of course.
"It's our way of letting Tony
know how much we care for him,"
said Rhea Arlin, hairdresser and
family friend who is helping organ
ize the event.
