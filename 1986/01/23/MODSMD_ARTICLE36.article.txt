# Jim McMahon's Problems All Seem Behind Him Now

### 
NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Chicago quarter
back Jim McMahon got his acupuncturist yes
terday. And his sore buttocks, reported im
proved, seemed set to play in Sunday's Super
Bowl.
After sitting out much of Tuesday's
practice, McMahon was treated before yes
terday's session by acupuncturist Hiroshi
Shiriashi, after the team's management
acceded to his request to have him flown in
from Chicago.
Then, wearing a headband with
"acupuncture" written on it, the irreverent

McMahon took most of the snaps on the
Bears' first two series at practice. That was
enough to encourage Coach Mike Ditka, who
earlier had worried about his quarterback's
condition.
"The main thing I was impressed with was
all his movement," Ditka said. "He was 200
percent better today. I was not very optimis
tic after yesterday's practice. It was a pleas
ant surprise for me."
Even before the pool report from the inter-
view, the official injury report had
listed McMahon as "probable" for
Sunday's game between the Bears
and New England Patriots. In offi
cial National Football League par
lance, that means he has at least a
75 percent chance of playing.
That confirmed the assessment
of McMahon himself, who had
vowed to play.
"I'm not gonna miss this game.
I'd never want to miss this game,"
McMahon told reporters from be
hind the sunglasses that have
become the trademark of his rebel
lious persona.
"I'll play because of the treat
ments I'll be getting. I'll play
because once you get on the field
the adrenalin starts pumping and
you put the pain out of your mind."
Vets Set To Climax Careers
As the New England Patriots
flew back to Boston after the vic
tory over Miami that put them in
the Super Bowl, John Hannah finally
decided he had something to
celebrate.
"He went to the back of the plane
with everybody and was dancing
and singing, which is not the John

Hannah we know," recalls Ron
Wooten, the other guard on New
England's offensive line. "He had to
be the most satisfied Patriot."
Hannah, considered by some to
be the best offensive lineman ever
to play football, will be making the
first Super Bowl appearance of his
13 National Football League
seasons on Sunday.
So will Walter Payton, who has
the statistics to prove he's the
greatest running back — his 14,860
career rushing yards in 11 years
with the Chicago Bears are the
NFL's all-time best.
Hannah and Payton profess to be
treating the Super Bowl as one
more game in a long career, Payton
more so than Hannah.
"My idea of playing is to go out
and play as hard as I can whether
it's the Super Bowl or anything
else," Payton said.
But if they're playing down the
significance of the game, their
teammates aren't. Neither are
some of their opponents.
At a recent award presentation in
Miami, Howie Long of the Los An
geles Raiders said he hopes the
Patriots win the Super Bowl be
cause he'd like to see Hannah cap a
distinguished career. Long's
teammate, Marcus Allen, said he
was rooting for the Bears because
of Payton, adding: "We running

backs stick together."
Start with Payton.
"To do all that he's done and not
go all the way is like going to the
end of the rainbow and not getting
the pot of gold," said Matt Suhey,
who plays next to Payton in
Chicago's backfield and is one of his
closest friends on the team. "No
matter how much he says it's just
another game, I think he really
wants it."
"I get special satisfaction in Wal
ter's case," said Bears Coach Mike
Ditka, who played in the 1971 and
1972 Super Bowls with the Dallas
Cowboys in the 10th and 11th
seasons of a 12-year career.
"When you can accomplish over
11 years what he's accomplished,
it's nice to take center stage. A lot
of great backs never made it —
O.J. Simpson, Jim Brown."
Hannah had a first-hand initiation
into what a Super Bowl means —■
his brother Charlie was a member
of the Raiders' Super Bowl winners
two years ago.
"When Charlie showed me his
ring, he started talking about all the
things I'd accomplished in my
career," Hannah said. "I said, 'I'd
trade all the things I'd done for that
ring.' Getting here is the partial ful
fillment of a dream, and it gives me
a possibility to fulfill the dream by
winning Sunday."
