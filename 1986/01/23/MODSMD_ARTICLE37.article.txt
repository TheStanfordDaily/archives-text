Boston 110, L.A. Lakers 95
In Boston last night, Dennis Johnson
scored 22 points and Larry Bird 21 as the
Boston Celtics rolled to a 110-95 NBA
victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in
the first meeting of the two powers since
last year's championship series.
The Celtics, still smarting from a six
game loss to the Lakers in the NBA finals
last June, led all the way except for a few
seconds in the opening period in hiking
their home record to 18-1. Boston also
improved its overall record to 31-8, just a
half-game behind the Lakers' league-best
32-8.
Johnson and Bird got plenty of help in
the scoring department as Robert Parish
contributed 16 points, Kevin McHale 12
and Bill Walton and Danny Ainge 11 each.
Walton, a veteran acquired mainly as a
backup for Parish at center, also had eight
rebounds and seven blocked shots in lim
ited action.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was high for the
Lakers with 17 points, but his sky hook
failed him for most of the game. Byron
Scott had 16 points, Earvin "Magic"
Johnson 15 and James Worthy 12 before
the Lakers regulars retired to the bench
after Boston built an insurmountable lead
in the fourth period.
Boston broke away from a 7-7 tie with
eight consecutive points in the first per
iod. The Lakers responded with a 14-4
run for their only lead, 21-19, before Bos
ton went in front to stay.
The Celtics led 57-49 at the half, then
broke away in the third quarter for an 88-
75 advantage. They led by as much as 23
points in the final period.

field, hitting 56 of 83 shots en route to
their ninth triumph in 11 games. Golden

road, lost for the 10th time in 12 games.
Wilkins led an 11-1 Hawks' streak in the
third period as Atlanta took a 91-78 lead

missing the last 11 games following his
suspension and drug rehabilitation.
