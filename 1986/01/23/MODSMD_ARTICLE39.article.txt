Marcos Official Vows Fair Vote
WASHINGTON — The Feb. 7 presidential election in the
Philippines will be "free, orderly, peaceful and democratic" because
of precautions taken by the government of President Ferdinand
Marcos, the country's acting foreign minister asserted yesterday.
Pacifico Castro defended his government's ban on foreign obser
vers and all news media at polling places, saying that the presence of
representatives of the opposition Laban Unido party and civic groups
would be sufficient to guarantee fairness.
Castro said that regulations similar to those passed by the national
assembly for next month's voting had applied in previous elections.
Under the law, both foreign and Filipino reporters will be required to
remain more than 50 yards from the polls.
However, Castro's contention was disputed by Dette Pascual,
U.S. spokesman for the National Citizens Movement for Free Elec
tions, who said in an interview that although legal restrictions on the
news media previously may have existed, in practice journalists had
free access to polling sites.
In previous elections, she said, squads of government supporters
were admitted to the polls by village captains — appointed by the
Marcos regime — who have the power to give ballots to persons not
on the official voters' list. Using this procedure, she continued, the
same persons could "fly" from polling place to polling place in order
to produce a government majority.
Nonetheless, Castro insisted, "The elections for president and
vice president will be free, orderly, peaceful and democratic. This is
because a dominant opposition has been duly accredited by the gov
ernment."
Frantic Oil Trading Stabilizes
World oil prices finally leveled off yesterday following frantic
trading that pushed crude oil to below $20 a barrel for a short time
early this week, more than $5 below the previous week's price.
But there is little confidence about what is to come in one of the
most volatile oil markets since the rise of the Organization of Petro
leum Exporting Countries, which took control of the market in the
early 19705.
"What pushed the market down in the first place was the un
seasonably warm weather and the resulting oversupply of oil," said
David Hackney, a spokesman for Sun Co.'s oil trading unit in
Philadelphia. "But that oversupply could easily be eaten up with a
cold snap. So it's anyone's guess where it's headed at this point."
Oil analysts had predicted that prices would slide in early spring
after the winter peak consumption. But unseasonably warm weather
in both the Northeastern United States and in Europe this month
prompted a buildup of inventories. Many analysts believe that the
"surprise" surplus during normally cold months panicked the market.
Oil experts estimate that the current inventory surplus is some
where between 700,000 and 1 million barrels — below the daily pro
duction of many of the bigger producers, such as Saudi Arabia, which
currently is believed to be pumping 4.5 million barrels daily. "It could
turn around as fast as it went down," said oil analyst Mark French of
Wharton Econometrics, an economic consulting company. "Even so,
I doubt whether it can recover to the level before the drop." In
December, for example, the price for West Texas Intermediate
grade was as high as $29 a barrel.
Beirut Car-Bomb Victims Buried
BEIRUT — Thirty victims of Tuesday's devastating car-bomb at
tack in Christian East Beirut were buried yesterday. Christian and
Moslem leaders alike condemned the massacre.
According to latest reports, 30 persons were killed and 132
wounded when a Mercedes-Benz packed with about 550 pounds of
explosives rocked a crowded shopping area near a Phalange Party
office in the Furn el Chabback quarter.
A man stopped the car in the middle of the road, pretending it had
broken down, newspapers said yesterday. He left the scene while a
huge traffic jam built up behind his car.
Moments later it exploded in a huge fireball, with many people who
were trapped inside their cars burning to death beyond recognition,
the reports said.
An anonymous caller to several newspapers claimed responsibility
for the attack on behalf of an Organization of Free Christians. But the
claim was being treated with scepticism, informed sources said.
The Christian militia known as Lebanese Forces said the blast was
directed against the unity of Christians and"the victory of Jan. 15,"
when militia cheif Elie Hobeika was toppled by forces loyal to Presi
dent Amin Gemayel, including the Phalangists.
Japan To Revamp Trade Policy
TOKYO — Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said yesterday that
he is pursuing a fundamental restructuring of Japan's export-oriented
economy with the goal of bringing long-term solutions to its emo
tional trade disputes with much of the rest of the world.
In an interview with a group of reporters and editors from The
Washington Post and Newsweek magazine Nakasone pointed to a
major commission report due in March as the main trade initiative
that Japan would offer this spring.
In the interview, Nakasone said he is warning business leaders
that Japan is at a point where it must act or risk serious conse
quences.
"If one continues to win in the game of mah-jongg, no friend will
come to play with you any longer," Nakasone said, referring to
threats to raise barriers against Japanese goods in the United States
and other Japanese foreign markets.
Japanese officials are trying to head off what they say may be a
new surge in protectionist sentiments in Washington this spring.
They also want to create a cordial atmosphere for an economic sum
mit Nakasone is to host here in May.
Three To Die for Gandhi Murder
NEW DELHI, India — A Delhi judge convicted three Sikh men of
murder and conspiracy yesterday and sentenced them to death for
the October 1984 assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
In a heavily guarded courtroom inside Delhi's main jail, Judge
Mahesh Chandra ended the eight-month-long trial by delivering his
verdict from behind a bulletproof glass shield. Each of the three
defendants — two former Delhi policemen assigned to Gandhi's se
curity detail and a former government clerk — maintained his in
nocence, and defense lawyers immediately promised an appeal.
With much of northwestern India under tightened security this
week because of tensions surrounding the Sikh community, there
were immediate fears that the judgment would further inflame Sikh
extremists who have mounted a campaign of terrorist attacks in the
Sikhs' home state, Punjab.

in both the Northeastern United States and in Europe this month
prompted a buildup of inventories. Many analysts believe that the
"surprise" surplus during normally cold months panicked the market.
Oil experts estimate that the current inventory surplus is some
where between 700,000 and 1 million barrels — below the daily pro
duction of many of the bigger producers, such as Saudi Arabia, which
currently is believed to be pumping 4.5 million barrels daily. "It could
turn around as fast as it went down," said oil analyst Mark French of
Wharton Econometrics, an economic consulting company. "Even so,
I doubt whether it can recover to the level before the drop." In
December, for example, the price for West Texas Intermediate
grade was as high as $29 a barrel.
Beirut Car-Bomb Victims Buried
BEIRUT — Thirty victims of Tuesday's devastating car-bomb at
tack in Christian East Beirut were buried yesterday. Christian and
Moslem leaders alike condemned the massacre.
According to latest reports, 30 persons were killed and 132
wounded when a Mercedes-Benz packed with about 550 pounds of
explosives rocked a crowded shopping area near a Phalange Party
office in the Furn el Chabback quarter.
A man stopped the car in the middle of the road, pretending it had
broken down, newspapers said yesterday. He left the scene while a
huge traffic jam built up behind his car.
Moments later it exploded in a huge fireball, with many people who
were trapped inside their cars burning to death beyond recognition,
the reports said.
An anonymous caller to several newspapers claimed responsibility
for the attack on behalf of an Organization of Free Christians. But the
claim was being treated with scepticism, informed sources said.
The Christian militia known as Lebanese Forces said the blast was
directed against the unity of Christians and"the victory of Jan. 15,"
when militia cheif Elie Hobeika was toppled by forces loyal to Presi
dent Amin Gemayel, including the Phalangists.
Japan To Revamp Trade Policy
TOKYO — Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said yesterday that
he is pursuing a fundamental restructuring of Japan's export-oriented
economy with the goal of bringing long-term solutions to its emo
tional trade disputes with much of the rest of the world.
In an interview with a group of reporters and editors from The
Washington Post and Newsweek magazine Nakasone pointed to a
major commission report due in March as the main trade initiative
that Japan would offer this spring.
In the interview, Nakasone said he is warning business leaders
that Japan is at a point where it must act or risk serious conse
quences.
"If one continues to win in the game of mah-jongg, no friend will
come to play with you any longer," Nakasone said, referring to
threats to raise barriers against Japanese goods in the United States
and other Japanese foreign markets.
Japanese officials are trying to head off what they say may be a
new surge in protectionist sentiments in Washington this spring.
They also want to create a cordial atmosphere for an economic sum
mit Nakasone is to host here in May.
Three To Die for Gandhi Murder
NEW DELHI, India — A Delhi judge convicted three Sikh men of
murder and conspiracy yesterday and sentenced them to death for
the October 1984 assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
In a heavily guarded courtroom inside Delhi's main jail, Judge
Mahesh Chandra ended the eight-month-long trial by delivering his
verdict from behind a bulletproof glass shield. Each of the three
defendants — two former Delhi policemen assigned to Gandhi's se
curity detail and a former government clerk — maintained his in
nocence, and defense lawyers immediately promised an appeal.
With much of northwestern India under tightened security this
week because of tensions surrounding the Sikh community, there
were immediate fears that the judgment would further inflame Sikh
extremists who have mounted a campaign of terrorist attacks in the
Sikhs' home state, Punjab.
Marcos Official Vows Fair Vote
WASHINGTON — The Feb. 7 presidential election in the
Philippines will be "free, orderly, peaceful and democratic" because
of precautions taken by the government of President Ferdinand
Marcos, the country's acting foreign minister asserted yesterday.
Pacifico Castro defended his government's ban on foreign obser
vers and all news media at polling places, saying that the presence of
representatives of the opposition Laban Unido party and civic groups
would be sufficient to guarantee fairness.
Castro said that regulations similar to those passed by the national
assembly for next month's voting had applied in previous elections.
Under the law, both foreign and Filipino reporters will be required to
remain more than 50 yards from the polls.
However, Castro's contention was disputed by Dette Pascual,
U.S. spokesman for the National Citizens Movement for Free Elec
tions, who said in an interview that although legal restrictions on the
news media previously may have existed, in practice journalists had
free access to polling sites.
In previous elections, she said, squads of government supporters
were admitted to the polls by village captains — appointed by the
Marcos regime — who have the power to give ballots to persons not
on the official voters' list. Using this procedure, she continued, the
same persons could "fly" from polling place to polling place in order
to produce a government majority.
Nonetheless, Castro insisted, "The elections for president and
vice president will be free, orderly, peaceful and democratic. This is
because a dominant opposition has been duly accredited by the gov
ernment."
Frantic Oil Trading Stabilizes
World oil prices finally leveled off yesterday following frantic
trading that pushed crude oil to below $20 a barrel for a short time
early this week, more than $5 below the previous week's price.
But there is little confidence about what is to come in one of the
most volatile oil markets since the rise of the Organization of Petro
leum Exporting Countries, which took control of the market in the
early 19705.
"What pushed the market down in the first place was the un
seasonably warm weather and the resulting oversupply of oil," said
David Hackney, a spokesman for Sun Co.'s oil trading unit in
Philadelphia. "But that oversupply could easily be eaten up with a
cold snap. So it's anyone's guess where it's headed at this point."
Oil analysts had predicted that prices would slide in early spring
after the winter peak consumption. But unseasonably warm weather
