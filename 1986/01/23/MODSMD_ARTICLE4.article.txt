# 16,000 Apply To University
## 
### KELLY SUND Staff writer 
Applications to Stanford's Class
of 1990 topped 16,000 yesterday —
a number second only to last year's
total of 17,652 — according to Jean
Fetter, dean of Undergraduate Ad
missions.
The mailing deadline for late ap
plications was Jan. 20.
As of Jan. 14, when the most
recent figures were tabulated,
more applicants, 6,462, came from
California than any other state.
New York ranked second, with 874
applicants, and Texas was third
with 695.
Stanford plans to admit 2,500
freshmen with the expectation that
1,520 will enroll.
Last year, Harvard received
13,345 applications, Yale received
11,737, and Princeton had 12,220.

Saying that she was "not con
cerned" about Stanford's drop in
applications from last year, Fetter
expressed happiness that the num
ber of applicants was the second
highest ever.
Fetter said she would "be con
cerned if there is a drop in quality."
She attributed the decrease in
applicants to the nationally decreas
ing number of high school
graduates.
The change in the application
process for the University of Cali
fornia may also have affected poten
tial Stanford applicants. Students
may now apply with a single applica
tion fee to more than one of the UC
campuses, and applications to all of
the campuses have greatly in
creased.
Fetter theorized that changing
the application deadline from Jan. 1
to Dec. 16 might have eliminated a
number of potential applicants who
waited until Christmas break to
complete their applications. The
change in deadline this year was
made to give the admissions staff

more time to read applications.
She also suggested that concern
about federal student financial aid
might have reduced the number of
applicants.
During the last five years, the
number of applications to Stanford
has increased by more than 25 per
cent.
Fetter attributed this to the high

caliber of the faculty and to the gen
eral quality of undergraduate life at
Stanford.
A recent study by the American
Council on Education and UCLA
said that Stanford's good academic
reputation was a very significant
factor for 95 percent of freshmen
when they made their college
choice, according to University
News Service.
