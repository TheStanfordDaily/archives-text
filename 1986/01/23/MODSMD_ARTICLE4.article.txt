Applications to Stanford's Class
of 1990 topped 16,000 yesterday —
a number second only to last year's
total of 17,652 — according to Jean

missions.
The mailing deadline for late ap

recent figures were tabulated,
more applicants, 6,462, came from
California than any other state.
New York ranked second, with 874
applicants, and Texas was third

Stanford plans to admit 2,500
freshmen with the expectation that
1,520 will enroll.
Last year, Harvard received
13,345 applications, Yale received
11,737, and Princeton had 12,220.

Saying that she was "not con
cerned" about Stanford's drop in
applications from last year, Fetter
expressed happiness that the num

highest ever.
Fetter said she would "be con

She attributed the decrease in
applicants to the nationally decreas

graduates.

campuses, and applications to all of
the campuses have greatly in
creased.
