# Inflation shows upturn
## Economic Growth Sinks to Three-year Low 
### 
WASHINGTON — The economy's perfor
mance last year was the weakest since the last
recession, and inflation began rising slightly at
year-end, the government reported yesterday.
The Commerce Department said the gross
national product — the nation's output of goods
and services — grew at a 2.3 percent rate from
the fourth quarter of 1984 to the fourth quarter
of 1985, far below the 4 percent rate forecast by
the Reagan Administration. It was the worst
showing since the recession year of 1982, when
the economy declined 2.1 percent.
The nation's large trade deficit, expected to
approach $150 billion when all the figures are in
for 1985, has been blamed for slowing the eco
nomy and costing hundreds of thousands of jobs

in industries hurt by imports. Nevertheless, the
civilian unemployment rate still dropped last year
from 7.4 to 6.9 percent, the lowest level since
April 1980.
The slow pace of the expansion, which
surprised many economists, followed a strong
performance in 1984, when GNP grew at a 6.6
percent rate while inflation remained moderate.
Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported
that consumer prices rose 3.8 percent last year,
an improvement from the 4,0 percent rate in
1984, and the same level as in 1983. However,
economists cautioned that inflation began to pick
up in the last three months of 1985, in part be
cause of higher food costs and increases in im
port prices.

The Reagan Administration has forecast that
the economy will grow at a 4 percent rate in
1986 and that inflation will not re-accelerate. If
inflation worsens and growth is weaker than ex
pected, the federal budget deficit will increase,
requiring deeper cuts under the Gramm-
Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction law.
While many economists say that inflation in
1986 will rise only slightly above levels last year,
they expect GNP to grow 3 percent at best.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said
that in addition to strong economic growth this
year, the Administration sees "no reason to ex
pect a re-ignition of the flames of inflation, partic
ularly in light of falling crude-oil prices."
