# Police Shoot Blacks In S. African Strife
## 
### 
BEKKERSDAL, South Africa —
Seven blacks were shot dead and
40 others wounded in a search for
the killers of two white South
African policemen, authorities said
yesterday. Residents of this black
township put the death toll at more
than 10.
As hundreds of combat troops
sealed off the township and
patrolled its dusty streets through
most of yesterday, heavily armed
riot police conducted a house-to
house search for suspects. Police
said that they arrested 250 blacks,
and charged 11 with murder. The
questioning of the others contin
ued.
At one roadblock outside Bek
kersdal, police said that they found
a Soviet-made AK-47 rifle and six
hand grenades in a car driven by
two blacks, who were arrested.
The two officers, a sergeant and
a constable, were the first white
policemen killed in 17 months of
sustained civil unrest here, and
their deaths brought a strong warn
ing yesterday from Louis le
Grange, the South African minister
of law and order, that "no mercy
would be shown to people who at
tacked or killed policemen or

prevented them from doing their
duty."
"The present trend of vicious at
tacks on policemen cannot be
tolerated," Le Grange said before a
cabinet meeting in Cape Town. "We
will do everything within the law to
protect ourselves and do our duty."
Twenty-two whites, including a
young soldier on riot duty, have
now died in South Africa's unremit
ting racial violence. Of these, 13
were killed in land-mine explosions
and bomb blasts since mid-
December after the African Na
tional Congress, fighting to over
throw the white minority rule,
called on its supporters to step up
their attacks on whites. More than
1,100 persons, mostly blacks and
Coloreds — persons of mixed race
— have died since the violence
began. Among those are about 20
black policemen, mostly killed as
government collaborators.
In Krugersdorp, the major white
town near Bekkersdal, black
nationalist leader Winnie Mandela
appeared briefly in court on charges
of violating a government order
barring her from living at her home
in Soweto, outside Johannesburg.
The case was postponed for four
weeks.
