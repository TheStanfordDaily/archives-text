# Abortion Foes Rally
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — On an
emotional day marking the 13th
anniversary of legalized abor
tions, thousands of opponents of
abortion yesterday marched on
the Supreme Court, lobbied
Congress and listened to
speeches, including one from
President Reagan, who vowed
to help them "overturn the
tragedy" of the high court deci
sion.
Speaking by a telephone
hookup to the crowd gathered on
the Ellipse, behind the White
House, Reagan asserted that ad
vances in prenatal medicine have
provided "dramatic confirma
tion" that a child in the womb is a
"live member of the human fam
ily."
Later, two dozen leaders of
anti-abortion groups met with
Reagan, emerging seemingly
satisfied with the president's
support for their cause but
sharply divided over the issue of
whether presidential amnesty
should be extended to militants
who have been convicted of
bombing abortion clinics.
The rally attracted a broad
range of participants, young and
old, wearing everything from
suits to jeans. Estimated at
about 36,000 by local police, the

crowd, many of whom carried
signs and banners, was about
half the size of last year's.
Several congressmen and
senators later addressed the
rally, which was plagued by a
poor sound system, leaving
many protesters unable to hear
the speakers. Among those ec
hoing Reagan's promise to help
overturn the court decision were
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and
Reps. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.),
Robert Dornan (R-Calif.) and
William Dannemeyer (R-Calif.).
The issue of a presidential
pardon for convicted bombers
that abortion foes claim are
"unjustly incarcerated" was
raised during the meeting be
tween Reagan and anti-abortion
leaders. Paul Brown, chief ex
cecutive officer of the American
Life League, told reporters af
terward that the president had
said he might someday "view
these on a case-by-case basis."
However, White House
spokesman Albert Brashear,
who attended the session,
quoted Reagan as saying that he
"might get a review" on a spe
cific case in which an opponent of
abortion was sentenced to 42
years in prison for kidnapping a
doctor who performs abortions.
