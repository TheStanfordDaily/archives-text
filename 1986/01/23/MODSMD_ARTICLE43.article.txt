Reagan Nixes Taxes
WASHINGTON — President Reagan told
Senate Republicans at a breakfast meeting
yesterday that he opposes the inclusion of a
business transfer tax or an oil-import fee in the
tax-revision plan the Senate will consider this
year, Administration and congressional offi
cials said.
Reagan also said he was "disturbed" that the
House had discarded his plan to eliminate the
federal deduction for state and local taxes and
suggested restoring it in the Senate to offset
the additional business tax breaks he wants,
presidential spokesman Larry Speakes said.
The president's comments came as the
early jockeying over this year's legislative
priorities intensified. Reagan told congres
sional leaders Tuesday that he would not ac
cept tax increases to reduce the deficit, and
yesterday he appeared to lay down another
challenge to Congress on tax revision, his
other major domestic policy priority for the
year.
The business transfer tax and oil-import fee
have been discussed by key senators as a way
to make up revenues that would be lost be
cause of Reagan's other demands for changes
in the House-passed tax-revision bill, as well
as changes the senators may want.

Court Rules on Banks
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court
swept aside a major obstacle yesterday to the
rapid spread of "non-bank banks," ruling that
the Federal Reserve Board lacked authority to
regulate the newly created, limited-service fin
ancial institutions.
In a decision widely awaited in the financial
industry, the court held 8-0 that provisions of
the federal Bank Holding Act were intended by
Congress to exempt limited-service institu
tions from board regulation, even though they
effectively provide many of the same services
as ordinary commercial banks.
The ruling represented an important victory
for the brokerage companies, retailers and
other companies that have recently entered
the limited-service banking field. Preliminary
applications for more than 300 limited-service
banks, most from bank holding companies,
have been approved by the comptroller of the
currency.
Medicaid Fraud
CHICAGO — Five doctors and three phar
macists were among 11 medical workers con
victed in District Court here yesterday of

bilking the Medicaid program of almost $20
million.
The 11 were accused of running a network
of clinics, medical laboratories and pharmacies
that were, in the words of one prosecutor,
"fraud mills," used to write and fill thousands
of phony prescriptions for codeine-based
cough syrup and sedatives for drug addicts.
The doctors and pharmacists then billed the
federally funded Illinois Medicaid program for
millions of dollars worth of unnecessary medi
cal tests, examinations and supplies.
The 11 were found guilty of racketeering,
conspiracy to commit racketeering, illegal drug
distribution and mail fraud in a jury trial that
lasted more than two months.
Stocks Show Decline
NEW YORK — The stock market suffered a
broad decline yesterday as traders again
dwelled on the potentially harmful conse
quences of weak oil prices.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
drifted at moderately lower levels much of the
session until the final hour, when the sell-off
accelerated. At the end of the session, the
blue chip barometer stood at 1,502.29, down
12.16 from Tuesday's closing level.
