"dynamite information" the contractor claimed

prosecutor said yesterday.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Bob Rose said in
opening statements that the alleged extortion
attempt was made by Leon Haywood, 51, who
tried to sell the information to Hedgecock at
torney Oscar Goodman.
Rose said Haywood, in an Oct. 30 phone
conversation with Goodman, claimed to repre
sent an unidentified juror who had "dynamite

information that would guarantee a new trial
(for Hedgecock)."
"According to Mr. Haywood, the juror
would tell the media they were coerced," Rose
added. "It would look like a surprise to every
one, and no one would know of Mr. Goodman's
involvement."
Goodman, however, contacted the FBI im
mediately after receiving the call from
Haywood, who is charged with attempting to
defraud Goodman.
Hedgecock, whose first trial ended in a
mistrial, was convicted Oct. 9 of perjury and
conspiracy charges arising from his 1983 cam
paign. The second trial ended three weeks
before Haywood's initial call.
