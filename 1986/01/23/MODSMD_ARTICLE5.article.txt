# Hoover Fellows Call Mural Insulting
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
Researchers at the Hoover Institution
agree that a recently completed Casa Zapata
mural depicting Latin American and South
African people pulling down Hoover Tower is
an unjustifiable insult to their studies of inter
national affairs.
"I'm slightly hurt. [The mural] is very un
just," said Latin American specialist Robert
Wesson, a Hoover senior fellow.
Entitled "The Spirit of Hoover," the mural
shows a skeleton breaking Hoover Tower in
half while Hispanic and black people pull the
pieces down with ropes. It also includes a
group of South African police, Latin American
guerrillas, a dead U.S. soldier and a piggy
bank into which American money earned on
foreign investment is being dropped.
The mural is intended to suggest that
Hoover is an influential factor in the formation
of conservative policy that oppresses Third

World people, according to artists who
worked on it.
Hoover Senior Fellow Lewis Gann said he
is upset by the mural, but he "can't sav that !
lie awake at night overcome with grief."
"I feel it is a gross slander, but we have
freedom of expression under the Constitu
tion, and people are allowed to make fools of
themselves as well as gain fame," Gann said.
Wesson said he does "not know of anything
the Hoover Institution is doing to oppress
people in Latin America."
"I have a great deal of sympathy with ie
problems of Latin America. . Everything
we've done has been for the beneht of every
one concerned," said Wesson, who has
recently written several articles on the Latin
American debt crisis.
"I just sit here and do my best, and
whatever image there may be, my feeling is
that it's unfortunate. I'm afraid people have
taken us as a symbol of something. Hoover
does no contract work for any corporation at
all," Wesson continued.

The artists, however, said they believe the
mural is appropriate and represents an impor
tant campus issue.
"Most of us are outraged at the current
state of affairs; we are angered at Stanford's
role as accomplice in these affairs. Through
this mural, we are proclaiming our rage and
anger and challenging others to join our
cause," said Mike Arguello, one of the
mural's seven artists.
The student artists are expressing their
displeasure at "the alliance between Hoover
and the Reagan Administration," said Bur
ciaga, a well-known local muralist.
"We're talking about war in South Africa
and Nicaragua, and we had to make our state
ment with passion" to match the seriousness
of the situations in those countries, according
to John Sobraske, another of the artists.
"It's respectful debate. I think we're telling
[Hoover] exactly how we feel. It's not slan
derous," Sobraske continued.
Gann and Burciaga disagreed on whether
the mural represents the opinions of a

majority of Stanford students.
"The mural represents the attitudes of a
very small minority who see themselves as
saints and those who disagree as sinners.
There is no justification for this insult" to
those who "have made a considerable contri
bution to learning," Gann said.
Burciaga said he has encountered no
criticism since the mural was unveiled Friday
and considers complaints by Hoover re
searchers unjustified.
Hoover fellows "know how to dish it out,
but they can't take it. They send policies to
Reagan, yet when they're criticized, they are
outraged," Burciaga said.
Walter Lammi, executive editor of the
Hoover Institution Press and member of the
Stanford class of '69, said he was "saddened
by the mural."
"I came out of Stanford as a radical... but
I feel that my undergraduate education didn't
serve me very well. It taught me passion but
