# New Loan Program for Faculty Housing To Begin
## 
### RUSSELL KOROBKIN 
In its continuing effort to
facilitate faculty recruiting and
retention, the Stanford Office of
Real Estate Programs and Land
Management is initiating a $30 mil
lion housing coinvestment program
to aid faculty in purchasing homes in
the Stanford area.
Scheduled to begin March 1, the
financing program will cover, at low
interest rates, up to 50 percent of
the purchase price of a home for
most faculty and some senior staff
members.
"What our housing programs are

intended to do is neutralize housing
as a factor in faculty recruitment,"
said Robin Hamill, director of Real
Estate Programs and Land Manage
ment.
"We are in one of the highest
priced housing markets in the
country — if not the highest-priced
— and yet our faculty salaries are
comparable to our competitor insti
tutions, primarily Ivy League
schools," Hamill said.
If a young prospective faculty
member is searching for a job and
housing costs here are two to three
times what they are elsewhere, he
is "not going to choose to come
here," Hamill said.

The Real Estate Programs and
Land Management Office attempts
to make out-of-pocket housing ex
penditures for Stanford faculty
comparable to what they would be
elsewhere for the same quality of
housing. Hamill said the new pro
gram will save a new faculty mem
ber up to $612 per month on a
$200,000 home. She estimates the
average cost of on-campus faculty
housing to be slightly over
$300,000
Hamill said home-financing pro
grams are having a tremendous ef
fect on recruitment. In 1979-80,
the University had no such program
and approximately 80 percent of

prospective faculty members who
went elsewhere said it was because
of the high cost of housing.
Since then, various assistance
programs have significantly
reduced that number. "We haven't
eliminated the problem, but we've
reduced it to almost manageable
levels," Hamill said.
Under the new coinvestment
(COIN) plan, Stanford will loan a
new faculty member up to 50 per
cent of the purchase price of a
home. The cost to the borrower is
5 percent the first year, escalating
by one-third of 1 percent each year.
The new faculty member will not
repay any of the principle of the

loan while he owns the house —
only interest. When the house is
sold, the faculty member owes
Stanford the amount of the original
loan plus a percentage of the ap
preciation on the house equal to the
percentage of the purchase price
that was borrowed.
For example, if a new faculty
member borrows $150,000 to buy a
$300,000 home, he or she would
pay $7,500 in interest the first
year, approximately $8,000 the
second year, and so on. If the home
is later sold for $350,000, Stanford
would receive a lump-sum payment
of $175,000 in addition to the annual
interest.
The loan can be repaid at any
time, but must be paid in one lump
sum, Hamill said.
"The purpose (of COIN) is to
make monthly payments affor
dable," emphasized Hamill. It is not
a subsidy to faculty members. The
University could make money from
the loans or could lose heavily
depending on housing appreciation
in the future, she said.
While COIN's primary purpose is
to assist new faculty members, cur
rent faculty members buying a new
house can also make use of the pro
gram. For these borrowers, inter
est rates begin at 6 percent and
escalate one-half of 1 percent a
year. Approximately 100 of Stan
ford's highest-ranking senior staff
members are also eligible for COIN
loans, Hamill said.
COIN is being introduced as an
alternative to the University's cur
rent 10/30 loan plan. Under 10/30,
Stanford secures a 30-year loan for
the new faculty member, the first
10 years at an interest rate below
market levels (usually 8 percent).

After the 10th year, the new fac
ulty member owes a balloon pay
ment — the total of what he has
saved over the previous decade —
which is partially paid by him, and
partially paid by the University.
"The interest-only nature of
coinvestment and the way the pay
ments increase gradually over time
sounds better and more attractive
to a lot of people coming in," he
said. New faculty members will
have a choice between the plans.
Although COIN is scheduled to
begin March 1, Hamill admits she's
"doing a lot of praying." She and
Whitmore aren't sure from what
sources the University will borrow
the approximately $30 million re
quired to finance the program for
three years.
"The University definitely has
$30 million somewhere, but the
question is, 'How do you want to
invest your portfolio?' " Whitmore
said. "Do you really want to put $30
million in the local real estate mar
ket, or would you rather save that
money and invest it somewhere
else? By borrowing externally you
protect yourself from having too
much tied up."
In addition to COIN and 10/30,
the University offers two other
housing finance programs.

quired to finance the program for
three years.
"The University definitely has
$30 million somewhere, but the
question is, 'How do you want to
invest your portfolio?' " Whitmore
said. "Do you really want to put $30
million in the local real estate mar
ket, or would you rather save that
money and invest it somewhere
else? By borrowing externally you
protect yourself from having too
much tied up."
In addition to COIN and 10/30,
the University offers two other
housing finance programs.
In its continuing effort to
facilitate faculty recruiting and
retention, the Stanford Office of
Real Estate Programs and Land
Management is initiating a $30 mil
lion housing coinvestment program
to aid faculty in purchasing homes in
the Stanford area.
Scheduled to begin March 1, the
financing program will cover, at low
interest rates, up to 50 percent of
the purchase price of a home for
most faculty and some senior staff
members.
"What our housing programs are

intended to do is neutralize housing
as a factor in faculty recruitment,"
said Robin Hamill, director of Real
Estate Programs and Land Manage
ment.
"We are in one of the highest
priced housing markets in the
country — if not the highest-priced
— and yet our faculty salaries are
comparable to our competitor insti
tutions, primarily Ivy League
schools," Hamill said.
If a young prospective faculty
member is searching for a job and
housing costs here are two to three
times what they are elsewhere, he
is "not going to choose to come
here," Hamill said.

The Real Estate Programs and
Land Management Office attempts
to make out-of-pocket housing ex
penditures for Stanford faculty
comparable to what they would be
elsewhere for the same quality of
housing. Hamill said the new pro
gram will save a new faculty mem
ber up to $612 per month on a
$200,000 home. She estimates the
average cost of on-campus faculty
housing to be slightly over
$300,000
Hamill said home-financing pro
grams are having a tremendous ef
fect on recruitment. In 1979-80,
the University had no such program
and approximately 80 percent of

prospective faculty members who
went elsewhere said it was because
of the high cost of housing.
Since then, various assistance
programs have significantly
reduced that number. "We haven't
eliminated the problem, but we've
reduced it to almost manageable
levels," Hamill said.
Under the new coinvestment
(COIN) plan, Stanford will loan a
new faculty member up to 50 per
cent of the purchase price of a
home. The cost to the borrower is
5 percent the first year, escalating
by one-third of 1 percent each year.
The new faculty member will not
repay any of the principle of the

loan while he owns the house —
only interest. When the house is
sold, the faculty member owes
Stanford the amount of the original
loan plus a percentage of the ap
preciation on the house equal to the
percentage of the purchase price
that was borrowed.
For example, if a new faculty
member borrows $150,000 to buy a
$300,000 home, he or she would
pay $7,500 in interest the first
year, approximately $8,000 the
second year, and so on. If the home
is later sold for $350,000, Stanford
would receive a lump-sum payment
of $175,000 in addition to the annual
interest.
The loan can be repaid at any
time, but must be paid in one lump
sum, Hamill said.
"The purpose (of COIN) is to
make monthly payments affor
dable," emphasized Hamill. It is not
a subsidy to faculty members. The
University could make money from
the loans or could lose heavily
depending on housing appreciation
in the future, she said.
While COIN's primary purpose is
to assist new faculty members, cur
rent faculty members buying a new
house can also make use of the pro
gram. For these borrowers, inter
est rates begin at 6 percent and
escalate one-half of 1 percent a
year. Approximately 100 of Stan
ford's highest-ranking senior staff
members are also eligible for COIN
loans, Hamill said.
COIN is being introduced as an
alternative to the University's cur
rent 10/30 loan plan. Under 10/30,
Stanford secures a 30-year loan for
the new faculty member, the first
10 years at an interest rate below
market levels (usually 8 percent).

After the 10th year, the new fac
ulty member owes a balloon pay
ment — the total of what he has
saved over the previous decade —
which is partially paid by him, and
partially paid by the University.
"The interest-only nature of
coinvestment and the way the pay
ments increase gradually over time
sounds better and more attractive
to a lot of people coming in," he
said. New faculty members will
have a choice between the plans.
Although COIN is scheduled to
begin March 1, Hamill admits she's
"doing a lot of praying." She and
Whitmore aren't sure from what
sources the University will borrow
the approximately $30 million re
quired to finance the program for
three years.
