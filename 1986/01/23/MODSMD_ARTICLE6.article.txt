# New Loan Program for Faculty Housing To Begin
## 
### RUSSELL KOROBKIN 
In its continuing effort to
facilitate faculty recruiting and
retention, the Stanford Office of
Real Estate Programs and Land
Management is initiating a $30 mil
lion housing coinvestment program
to aid faculty in purchasing homes in
the Stanford area.
Scheduled to begin March 1, the
financing program will cover, at low
interest rates, up to 50 percent of
the purchase price of a home for
most faculty and some senior staff
members.
"What our housing programs are

intended to do is neutralize housing
as a factor in faculty recruitment,"
said Robin Hamill, director of Real
Estate Programs and Land Manage
ment.
"We are in one of the highest
priced housing markets in the
country — if not the highest-priced
— and yet our faculty salaries are
comparable to our competitor insti
tutions, primarily Ivy League
schools," Hamill said.
If a young prospective faculty
member is searching for a job and
housing costs here are two to three
times what they are elsewhere, he
is "not going to choose to come
here," Hamill said.

The Real Estate Programs and
Land Management Office attempts
to make out-of-pocket housing ex
penditures for Stanford faculty
comparable to what they would be
elsewhere for the same quality of
housing. Hamill said the new pro
gram will save a new faculty mem
ber up to $612 per month on a
$200,000 home. She estimates the
average cost of on-campus faculty
housing to be slightly over
$300,000
Hamill said home-financing pro
grams are having a tremendous ef
fect on recruitment. In 1979-80,
the University had no such program
and approximately 80 percent of

prospective faculty members who
went elsewhere said it was because
of the high cost of housing.
Since then, various assistance
programs have significantly
reduced that number. "We haven't
eliminated the problem, but we've
reduced it to almost manageable
levels," Hamill said.
Under the new coinvestment
(COIN) plan, Stanford will loan a
new faculty member up to 50 per
cent of the purchase price of a
home. The cost to the borrower is
5 percent the first year, escalating
by one-third of 1 percent each year.
The new faculty member will not
repay any of the principle of the

loan while he owns the house —
only interest. When the house is
sold, the faculty member owes
Stanford the amount of the original
loan plus a percentage of the ap
preciation on the house equal to the
percentage of the purchase price
that was borrowed.
For example, if a new faculty
member borrows $150,000 to buy a
$300,000 home, he or she would
pay $7,500 in interest the first
year, approximately $8,000 the
second year, and so on. If the home
is later sold for $350,000, Stanford
would receive a lump-sum payment
