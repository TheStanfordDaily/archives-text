# Students May Lose $244 Million by Law
## 
### 
Federal spending on student aid
must be cut by about $224 million
this year to comply with the sweep
ing deficit-reduction law enacted by
Congress last month, the Congres
sioal Budget Office and White
House Office of Management and
the Budget said last week.
Under the law, the president
must issue orders by Feb. 1 to

Education Watch

reduce overall federal spending in
the current fiscal year by $11.7 bil
lion.
Budget agencies said all non
defense programs must be reduced
by 4.3 percent in order to achieve
the necessary reduction in spend
ing, reported The Chronicle of
Higher Education.
Defense-related activities must
be cut by 4.3 percent.
The new law, known as the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act after
its legislative sponsors, specifies
that, in most cases, the president's
order must reduce each federal
program by an equivalent propor
tion to achieve the legislated reduc-

tions.
The General Accounting Office is
scheduled to send the president a
report this week outlining how the
automatic spending cuts, which
take effect March 1, must be made.
The Education Department has
said its entire budget may be
trimmed by $599 million.
' We can live with these cuts,"

said Education Secretary William
Bennett,
Bennett said he hopes that future
cuts would not be made in an non
discriminating, automatic manner.
Under the Gramm-Rudman-
Hollings Act, automatic cuts must
be imposed when the president and
Congress cannot agree on how cuts
should be made.

"It would be far preferable to
make these decisions according to
some determination of priorities
rather than mechanically and across
the board," Bennett said.
Bruce Carnes, deputy assistant
education secretary for planning,
budget and evaluation said this
year's cuts could be "easily ab
sorbed" by the department.
"I look at it this way: If the
federal government provides 8 per
cent of all education spending in this
country, then a 4.3 percent reduc
tion of our budget translates into a
0.3 percent cut in education fund
ing," Carnes said.
The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
legislation, however, could hold
bigger cuts in store in the future.
Beginning in fiscal 1987, the law
calls for the deficit to be reduced by
increments of about $36 billion, un
til it is eliminated in 1991.
If the automatic approach had to
be used in 1987, about $50 billion in
cuts would be spread across
various federal agencies. The cuts
would fall more heavily on depart-
ments such as Education,
however, since the law ex
empts nearly three quarters
of the federal budget from the
automatic scheme — includ
ing such items as Social Se
curity and interest on the
national debt.
Education lobbyists have
expressed concern that
reductions of about 30 per
cent would have to be made in
most college-assistance pro
grams.
The fiscal 1987 cuts would
take place next Oct. 1, seven
months after this year's
reductions.
The report issued last
week by the Congressional
Budget Office and the Office
of Management and Budget
marked the first step in a
complicated process that will
ultimately lead to this fiscal
year's cuts.
The president must use the
report of the General Ac
counting Office as a basis for
the enactment of automatic
spending cuts that he must
issue to comply with Gramm-
Rudman-Hollings legislation.
The automatic cuts could
be avoided if Congress and
the president could agree on
some other way to reduce the
deficit, but it is not expected
that such an alternative plan
will be adopted.
