# Police Apply Noise Policy
## 
### KEITH SEINFELD 
A year after the University
adopted guidelines aimed at limiting
late-night party noise, campus resi
dents say the noise situation has
improved, but fear that the im
provement may be short-lived.
Ida Dean, manager of Pearce
Mitchell Apartments and a member
of the Committee on Noise, said of
the situation, "We live right across
from frat row and we had so many
complaints last year that I had to go
to the director of the Row. Then
they formed the committee, which
was very helpful ... I felt there
was a good understanding.
"But last week there was a huge
party across the street (at Grove
House) that disregarded the noise
rules," Dean said, adding that she is
concerned because parties tend to
get bigger and louder in the sping.
On a typical weekend, Stanford
police respond to several com
plaints about loud parties, and prob
lems are resolved with the coopera
tion of the noise-makers, according
to Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington.

"We have no policy for noise or
parties. The policy comes from the
dean of Student Affairs," Her
rington said. "We don't care about
parties until we get complaints, and
90 percent of them are noise
related.
"We respond to every complaint
by dispatching an officer to investi
gate the scene. Whether we shut
down a party or not depends on
how late it is, how much drinking's
been going on, and whether there is
someone who appears responsible
and in Control. There is a tendency
for the noise to go back up after the
officer leaves, so he will often ask
them to turn it off completely,"
Herrington said.
The University's noise policy
was written last year by a commit
tee of students, faculty, police and
campus residents, according to
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons.
The committee was formed be
cause "there were too many com
plaints about noise," Lyons said, "It
appeared that there had been an in
crease in number (of complaints)
over the last few years and, since it
is also often a judgement problem,

there was a feeling that some
guidelines might be helpful."
Diana Conklin, associate dean of
Student Affairs, summarized the
policy as "a set of guidelines di
rected primarily toward students in
residences. . . . The fewer the
problems, the better the party."
The most explicit of the
guidelines calls for a significant
noise reduction by 11 p.m. on
weekdays and 1 a.m. on weekends.
"This means basically that noise
should not be heard outside of the
house after the specified times, and
if the party is still going on then
somebody should walk around the
outside of the house to check the
volume," Conklin said.
Lyons said, "At first glance it
[the guidelines] looked pretty good,
but like all guidelines, they rely on
people trying to understand each
other. Sometimes you put a lot of
work into something and assume
that everyone knows about it â€” I
think that last year we didn't get the
word out well enough."
"Perhaps this spring we should
get a group together from the
residences to review and evaluate
it," Lyons said.
