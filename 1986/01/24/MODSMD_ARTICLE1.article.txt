# University To Offer S.A.-Free Pensions
## 
### LARRY WEBER Staff writer 
As a result of pressures within
the Stanford community, a retire
ment investment plan free of
speculation in companies with
South African business interests
will be offered to Stanford faculty
and tax exempt employees, accord
ing to John Working, the Univer
sity's manager of benefits.
"The plan is (University Presi
dent Donald) Kennedy's response
to the interest on the part of the
community last spring (regarding
South Africa) to answer to the
needs in employee benefits,"
Working said.
If they wish, tax exempt staff and
faculty can begin directing 5 per
cent of their salary into the Calvert
Group's Social Investment Fund
with their Feb. 22 paychecks.
Calvert will join Fidelity, Scudder
and Vanguard as companies offering
retirement investment opportuni
ties to Stanford workers.
The difference between Cal
vert's pension investment plan and
those of the other three is its ad
herence to a company-established
set of social criteria, which includes
the disallowance of investment in
corporations economically active
within borders monitored by
"repressive regimes."
Although Calvert's socially
conscious pension fund discrimi
nates between potential invest
ments, its rate of return will not
suffer, according to Martha Kelly,
the company's pension product
manager.
Kelly cited as evidence last
year's 2G.8 percent total return for
Calvert's social investment
managed growth portfolio, which
along with the company's money
market portfolio constitutes what is
available to eligible Stanford
employees.
"What it (the return) shows is
that you don't have to sacrifice rate
of return because you are investing
in a socially-conscious fund," she
said.
Calvert's social criteria, accord
ing to Kelly, also prohibit invest
ments in companies that damage
the environment, stock the world's
nuclear arsenal or work to expand
the scope of nuclear energy.
Investing in such companies, she
said, would not only offend the
minds of socially-conscious inves
tors, but would constitute wreck
less speculation.
"We fee! that we have the most
strong social criteria without
sacrificing our return for our inves
tors." she said.
