## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Editor's Farewell 
### 
Jorgen Visbak, a 65-year-old chemical engineer
from Boulder City, Nev., some years ago became
the first person to "swim" the entire length of the
Grand Canyon. Dressed in a wet suit and life
preserver, he waded into the Colorado River at
Lee's Ferry, near Page, Ariz., and paddled the 277
miles to Lake Mead.
"It's a wild river, you know — so many rapids! —
but I had always wanted to swim it," Visbak told me
a couple years ago. "I finally got the chance, so off I
went. The white water tossed me around, and there
were times when I had to swim like hell. But I had
friends who cached supplies and helped along the
way.
"All the while I floated down the Colorado, I was
thinking how this river and I had become friends —
how we were working together to do something ex
citing. By the time I got to Lake Mead — ex
hausted, let me tell you, but exhilarated, too — it
felt almost as if the river couldn't keep flowing if I
left it. But I got in the car and went home, and the
Colorado went on without me. We had spent our
time together, but it was time for me to move on."
Letting go of something you've loved is never
easy. And when you have spent many hours at The
Daily for weeks at a time, it's tempting to believe
that nothing can work without you.
But The Daily will go on.
I have written and edited my way through miles of
copy, and read my work the next day with pride and

dismay. But my faith in The Daily — a place where
students can come together to work for something
they believe in — has never wavered. Every new
student we can bring into The Daily teaches us
something different about the community we try to
serve. New people make new mistakes, but they
also achieve new successes.
It is my hope that volume 188 will be remem
bered not for the typefaces we have used, or for the
letters we have capitalized in headlines, but as a
time when new people have felt encouraged to come
into The Daily and discover why veteran staffers
care so much about the work they do here.
During the past four years, The Daily and I have
become friends. We have shared experiences and
explored each other's limitations and possibilities.
We have worked together in ways I will always
cherish.
I will graduate in not so very long, and there will
come a time when The Daily is very far away. But
The Daily will go on, and there will be others who
will share in its opportunities. If I could wish any
thing for those who follow me, it would be that their
hours at The Daily will be as exhausting and ex
hilarating as mine have been.
