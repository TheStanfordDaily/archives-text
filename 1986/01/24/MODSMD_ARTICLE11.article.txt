Give Fair Shake
To Conservatives
Mr. Jose Antonio Burciaga, in
the Zapata mural controversy,
claims that Hoover fellows "know
how to dish it out, but they can't
take it." I disagree.
What would liberals and radicals
have said had the Hoover Institu
tion commissioned artists for a
mural showing Stanford militants
as lackeys who serve the lords of
Moscow's Gulag Archipelago? How
would liberals and radicals react
were they to be routinely harried,
heckled and insulted — as invited
conservative speakers are — at
symposia concerning controversial
topics? How would liberals feel —
to give a specific instance — if only
conservatives had been asked to
comment on Bishop Tutu's recent
presentation at Stanford?
Academia's problems are ,
however, more deep-seated.
There are certain fields of study in
the United States from which con
servatives are excluded de facto,
though not dejure, from teaching
positions at almost all prestigious
U.S. universities. To the best of
my knowledge, no self-avowed
conservative holds a teaching posi
tion at any U.S. university in fields
such as African studies, black
studies, Chicano studies or
women's studies.
It is surely harder for a camel to

pass through the eye of a needle
than, say, for an opponent of the
ERA to get a teaching position in
women's studies. And this is a
matter of much graver concern
than the Zapata mural.

I am writing in response to the
letter of Mr. Jose Antonio Burciaga
and Mr. John Winker (The Daily,
Jan. 21) concerning the new Zapata
mural. While I agree with the gen
eral thrust of the letter — that it
was appropriate not to judge the
mural on its expressed political
beliefs — one particular part of the
letter caught my attention. To
quote: "Censorship. Students who
do a paper or a project for a course
should not be judged on the politi
cal beliefs expressed therein, but
only on the quality of their aca
demic performance. To suggest
otherwise amounts to political
censorship."
If you replace the word
"students" with "Hoover fellows"
and delete the words "for a
course," you are left with an inter
esting statement. While Mr. Walter
Lammi of the Hoover Institution
does seem to have some miscon

ceptions about the accreditation
process, this is understandable
since the Hoover Institution has no
input to the accreditation process.
What disturbs me is that the main
charges against Hoover all revolve
around a supposed lack of aca
demic governance. If there is a
problem with the credentials of
Hoover fellows or with their meth
ods of research, then I am sure
that a single Stanford faculty mem
ber could discredit Hoover by
presenting his findings on Hoover,
assuming they were correct and
provable.
Since this has not occurred, I
submit that the only possible rea
son for wanting to submit Hoover
to greater academic governance is
to stifle the views commonly ex
pressed at Hoover.
I personally enjoy the fact that at
Stanford, unlike many other
schools, there exists such a wide
variety of viewpoints, and that
they are all part of the Stanford
community. I feel that it would be
a grave error either to divorce
certain viewpoints from the Uni
versity or to squash them under
the thumb of "academic gover
nance." I hope that anybody who
agrees with the statement which I
quoted will reread it and make sure
that they are applying these ideas
equally to all parties involved.
