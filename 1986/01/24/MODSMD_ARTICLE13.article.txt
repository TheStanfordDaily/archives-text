# ARTHUR MILGRAM
## Police Actions Abusive 
### 
I agree with the ASSU that a further investigation of
police behavior on campus concerning what took place
during senior Robby Perkins' arrest is required. Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy denies this neces
sity because it will turn up information that will embar
rass himself and Marvin Herrington, chief of police.
The reason I believe this to be true stems from the
knowledge I have gained from 15 years of on-campus
residence. Furthermore, the first Wednesday after the
end of fall quarter this year I was arrested from the
family room of my home for riding a bicycle without a
light.

VIEWPOINT

The story began while I was riding my bicycle, with
out its light, up Estudillo Road, turning down the hill
onto Lathrop. I observed a police vehicle parked on
Middlefield Road, and I observed that the officer began
to follow me down Lathrop with his headlights turned
off. I turned onto Cedro Way and rode three blocks to
my home. My house is on a corner, and just before 1
was in front of it, the police car turned on its head
lights. Good for him. I rode home, let myself in by the
front door and began watching television.
Soon afterward, I observed several noises coming
from the backyard, so I went to investigate. When I
turned on the porch light, a police officer came to the
door and said, "Either you open the door, or I'll break
it in." Surprised, I invited him in, and then opened the
door. Immediately, he reached in and grabbed my
wrist, pulled me out of the house and attempted to ap
ply the by-now-infamous compliance pain hold. I
reversed his wrist, applied my own hold and began
shouting for help.
My next-door neighbors came out and witnessed
most of what follows. When I reaped what was going
on, I put my hands up. The officer then slammed me
onto the wall, and instantly my backyard was swarming
with policemen. I was immediately chained and thrown
into the back of one of four police cars. But not before I
observed that these officers of the peace were search
ing both my house and my garage. Now they had
already taken my driver's license, hence they knew I
lived there. As I said, my neighbors have seen that
what I am writing is true.
Later I was charged with resisting arrest, riding a

bicycle without a light and riding a bicycle while under
the influence of alchohol. All of the lawyers I have
talked to urge me to file a civil suit — they say my
rights have been trampled. I agree; and furthermore, I
demand that the abusive and unbusinesslike behavior
of the campus police be stopped. Those men are police
officers, not part of the Gestapo!
My father, a tenured professor here, has advised
Kennedy of the arrest and made his own complaint
known to him. Kennedy has chosen to ignore him. I
can recall a similar situation in which a friend of mine
(whose father is also on the faculty) was arrested il
legally, and his father threatened a civil suit. In a con
ference with Herrington, the captain told my friend's
father that he might actually win the suit, but that the
Police Department knew that both of his sons drove
cars.
I ask you, What right have these people to come and
terrorize us in the very homes in which we live?
