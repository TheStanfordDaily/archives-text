# Fighting Injustice Pays Poorly
## 
### 
I went to the Career Planning and Placement
Center the other day to look for my future. What
I found was deeply distressing.
Since I have loans to pay off, I need to get a
well-paying job. But the most lucrative positions,
I found, were mostly with corporations. They

had a host of opportunities for engineers, invest
ment bankers and financial analysts. But there
was little for someone who wants to eradicate in
justice and make a decent living, too.
As I sat flipping through the red binders it
became clear to me that almost all of the finan
cially rewarding jobs are within the framework of
the status quo. Harking back to my days in Eco
nomics 001, I thought about the laws of supply
and demand. The jobs most in demand are those
which continue the status quo as is. Depending
on the needs of the economy at any given mo
ment, the positions which best fill those needs
will be best compensated.
There is not at present a great demand for
people who desire to ameliorate the human con
dition.
I found myself wondering if that was all there
is. Have my four years at Stanford come to this

— offering myself up to the highest bidder so
that I can go out and grease the wheels of
America's economic machine? Is that really all
there is? Is my primary purpose in life to uphold
and ensure the smooth functioning of the
present-day economy? The same economy that
cannot provide employment for 10 million people
and allows 34 million people to live in poverty?
And what about the victims of this economic
behemoth? What will happen to them? Does our
role in driving forward the engines of the eco
nomy have anything to do with their pain? What
will we do?
John Donne wrote, "any man's death
diminishes me because I am involved in mankind;
and never send to know for whom the
bell tolls; it tolls for thee." I cannot help but hurt
when I learn that 40,000 children in this world
die every day from hunger and starvation. Forty
thousand bells toll every day; the ringing is in
cessant. When I think of people sleeping in door-

" There is a higher calling than to drive a nice car
and live in a big house. We must all answer the
question, What will we do?' "

ways in San Francisco, I shiver in my bed. I can
not sleep. "It tolls for thee." It tolls . . . and tolls
. . . and tolls.
What will we do?
I cannot ignore the pain of the people. I must

act. Martin Luther King, Jr. said that when faced
with an edifice that produces poverty, one must
go beyond helping the poor. One must change
the edifice. I must take up the struggle to build a
better world.
The job is secondary, the struggle is primary.
I will make a living, but the real question is how
will I live. In what fashion will I conduct my life?
What road will I take? Is there any alternative to
committing my very being and essence to the
creation of a more just social order?
I realize that fighting to improve this society
does not pay well. That very fact speaks
volumes about why social change is so
desperately needed. My family may not be happy
with my choice, but they will have to under
stand. There is a higher calling than to drive a
nice car and live in a big house. We must all an
swer the question, "What will we do?"
As I put away the red binder and walked
outside, I thought of the words of Paul Robeson:

"You must take sides. You must elect to fight for
freedom or slavery. I have made my choice. I
had no alternative."
