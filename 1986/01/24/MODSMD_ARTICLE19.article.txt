## 'Fool for Love' Fails as a Flick 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
Although there's a lot of action in
Robert Altman's adaptation of Sam
Shepard's "Fool for Love," it's a
strangely empty movie. Altman
spends a long time at the beginning
setting the scene — a motel at the
edge of nowhere, brightly lit with
day-glow neon. Eddie (Shepard
himself) arrives in his truck and
horse trailer. Altman loves this set
as much as Francis Ford Coppola
loved his stage in "One from the
Heart," and his camera roves in and
out of the buildings, catching
oblique movements and the edges
of the frame. The characters prowl
around the motel, have their con
frontations and then move on. The
movie seems empty because nei
ther they nor the director ever stop
to involve us in their conflicts.
Shepard's play is about Eddie's
return to May (Kim Basinger in the
movie), who's living at this motel
near the Mojave desert. Eddie and
May have a very stormy, love/hate
relationship. But like many
Shepard characters, they seem
drawn to each other in a very funda
mental way. Just how fundamental

their relationship is constitutes the
heart of the play.
Like the earlier Altman adapta
tion "Come Back to the Five &
Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean,"
"Fool for Love" is a play about the
deceptions of memory. Unlike Ed
Graczyk's "Five & Dime" though,
Shepard doesn't set obvious
theatrical traps for his characters.
Graczyk gave one character,
Joanne, the job of exposing the lies
in the lives of everyone in the cast.
In Shepard's work, the characters
at least partially understand their
lies, and they go on living them be
cause that's what they're fated to
do. Shepard doesn't deal in tidy
resolutions, but he plays his own
theatrical games, and in "Fool for
Love" these are a little more
heavy-handed than in most of his
work.
The play focuses on Eddie and
May and never lets up; their rela
tionship is at one moment tender,
the next passionate, the next viol
ent. The play has a rapt quality be
cause it's all done in one act, in one
room, and it shifts attention from
the two principals only once. This is
what makes "Fool for Love" work
at all, for its subject matter is, at
least for Shepard, far from inspired

or profound. It's his most obvious
decline-of-the-American-West goth
ic, with the characters' relation
ships, passions and self-deceits
drawing on, and then undermining,
classic Western hero iconography.
Though only average Shepard, it's
still much better material than
Graczyk's "Five & Dime," so it's
surprising when Altman doesn't
develop "Fool for Love" 's
strengths in the transfer to the
screen. Altman wants to turn the
play into a movie, and in opening it

up he dilutes its power.
In "Five & Dime," Altman essen
tially stuck to his one-room set and
devoted his full attention to the per
formances. He pulled off miracles;
every movement brought out the
best in the actresses and gave
depth to the material. He went
inside the characters by devoting all
of his directing skill and energy to
them and their interactions. It's
what he does best in his best films,
and it's exactly what Shepard's
work requires. So what is Altman

doing in "Fool for Love" when he
spends time drifting around the pe
riphery of his motel set? Eddie
devotes half his time to glimpsing at
May through open windows, and
May occupies herself flitting in and
out of doorways.
The set seems deliberately con
structed for this. The motel rooms
have no curtains, and are brightly lit
from the inside; Altman may be
trying for an effect similar to the
one he got with the mirrored wall in
"Five & Dime," but in that movie

the mirror provided a link between
the two different worlds of the play,
which were connected through the
characters. The "Fool for Love"
set keeps the characters separated
— watching and wandering. And
whenever the material threatens to
focus on the actors, Altman cuts
away to a flashback sequence, or
follows other characters who have
just left the scene. In "Five &
Dime," Altman used the same
