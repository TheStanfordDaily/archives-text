# The
						Company Stages 'Caesar,' 20th-century Style
## 
### MARK TOMPKINS Staff writer 
By now it is a well-established
convention in the world of theater
to take a play out of its original con
text and put it in a new setting. This
practice is best exemplified by Jean
Anouilh, who in 1943 transformed
Sophocles's "Antigone" into an ex
amination of wartime France.
Moliere's "Tartuffe," originally set
in the Paris of 1669, has been
plunked down in the 19th-century
American South without any great
difficulty. So it should come as no
great surprise that the version of
Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar" cur
rently being performed by The
Company in Cubberley Auditorium is
set in "an industrialized nation in
the first half of the 20th century,"
as the program puts it.
But can the Swan of Avon stand
this sort of tinkering with his ma
terial? Moving "Julius Caesar" to an
unnamed modern state certainly
must have sounded like a great idea
when The Company first came up
with the notion. The politics of con
spiracy haven't changed much since
Cassius and Brutus decided to as
sassinate Julius Caesar, so if any
thing, Shakespeare's account of the
murder has only gained in
relevancy. And what delicious irony
if "Julius Caesar" were set in, say,
Nazi Germany, since it was Roman
grandeur that Hitler wanted to
recreate with his Third Reich?
Without getting too fanciful, imagine
the possibilities for a "Caesar" de
signed by Albert Speer and directed
by Leni Rifenstahl.
The main problem with The
Company's "Julius Caesar" is that
once the new setting has been es
tablished, director Tony Kelly and
his troupe seem to have shied away
from the possibilities inherent in the
material. The idea of a modern-day
"Caesar," carrying as it does strong

whiffs of fascism and
totalitarianism, could have been ex
plored much further. As it is now,
the new setting seems like a gim
mick, particularly in the opening
scenes. The actors seem to pose
stiffly in their immaculate
trenchcoats and baggy suits; the
costumes wear the cast, rather
than vice versa, and we wonder if
this is not some sort of avant garde
fashion show.
Dour electronic music lets us
know that this is a grim, gray indus
trial state. A huge painted backdrop
shows buildings and girders in a
vaguely futurist style, but we never
get to see the backdrop fully due to
the dim lighting. One of the set's
better touches is a crackling voice
that squawks over a loudspeaker
several times, delivering a message

with distinctly socialist overtones.
Fortunately, things pick up as the
drama progresses. The brutal as
sassination scene sets all the actors
into high gear, and they no longer
seem uncomfortable or self
conscious in their costumes. A
second backdrop is put up for the
murder, and it's extremely effec
tive; the violent slashes of color
suggest the gory knives that tear
into Julius Caesar. Later on these
same streaks of color will stand for
the angry Roman crowd, roused by
Antony into avenging their ruler.
Of all the actors, Michael Weis as
Brutus and Paolo Morante as
Marcus Antony are the most at
ease with Shakespeare's lines.
They give their speeches exactly the
right measured cadences that the
material calls for. Morante is fairly

capable in the famous "I come to
bury Caesar, not to praise him"
speech, but the crowd he's ad
dressing yells over several of his
lines, and this is a serious mistake,
for these lines are not meant to be
drowned out.
Several of the characters have
been remodeled in a manner appro
priate to the new setting. Casca is
now a woman, an acknowledge
ment perhaps that women have a
little more access to political
power. Played by Alison Mockett,
this Casca is all sharp cheekbones
and haughty poise, the perfect
1940s film heroine. Caesar himself,
played by Jeff Schwamberger, is
now a somewhat fragile-looking
man with a quavering voice. It's in
teresting that this stooped man
could be the center of such intense
feeling, beloved by the public and
despised by the conspirators.
Schwamberger's portrayal of
Caesar works, principally because
we know that leaders in the 20th
century do not have to be physically
imposing to be dangerous.
In direct contrast is John Tier
ney's Octavius, whose effective
ness is directly related to his physi
cal presence. In Shakespeare's
original, Octavius is the man best
suited to rule because he is utterly
businesslike and divorced from pas
sion. In The Company's version, a
ruthless streak has been added. We
know that this Octavius is going to
stamp out his enemies with the
ease that he grinds out his
cigarettes. Dressed in a big over
coat and dark glasses, Tierney's
Octavius is the generalissimo su
preme; he's the virtual embodiment
of an order that came to power in
many places in the '30s and '40s.
With the character of Octavius, as
well as those of Casca and Caesar,
this production of Shakespeare's
classic drama brings out new di
mensions in the material that are
only hinted at elsewhere.


John Tierney (Octavius), and Paolo Morante (Marcus Antony)
and lan Cummings are featured in The Company's current pro
duction of a modern-day "Julius Caesar." The show runs tomor
row and Sunday at 8:30 p.m. in Cubberley Auditorium.
