## Big Basin Hosts Treks From Redwoods to Sea 
### SUSAN SMITH 
When your little sister is diver
sions editor for The Daily, every
thing you do becomes possible ma
terial for a story. So when I decided
to fulfill a years-old dream to hike
the Skyline-to-the-Sea trail at Big
Basin's Redwoods State Park,
guess whose eyes lit up in anticipa
tion of the hard copy she knew I'd
agree to provide?
Big Basin is about an hour away
from Stanford. To get there, you
take 280 South to Saratoga-
Sunnyvale Road west, and head
toward the green hills until you
reach the Highway 9 junction in
Saratoga, where you turn right.
Highway 9 takes you on an ex
tremely winding 15 or so miles di
rectly to park headquarters.

The many beautifully maintained
trails at Big Basin range in difficulty
and length, so you can choose any
thing from an afternoon stroll to a
three-day trek.
The Skyline-to-the-Sea trail actu
ally starts about 10 miles away from
Big Basin Headquarters at Water
man Gap in Castle Rock State Park.
From Big Basin to the sea along the
trail is another 10 miles. My friend
and I planned an overnight trip,
taking Sunset Trail to Sunset Trail
Camp, about six m ; les, and then
joining up with the Skyline-to-the-
Sea trail the next day.
The first thing we learned about
park rules is that no camping
outside designated campgrounds is
permitted. This was a problem,
since we had spent too long getting
ready and had too little time to
reach the camp before dark. The

very patient ranger, convinced by
my friend's Air Force issue
fatigues, finally did agree to issue
us the $1 per-person, per-night
camping permit, but strongly
warned us against trying to get
there that evening.
We tried anyway, but I agree
with the ranger that it was foolish
and dangerous to hike this trail in
the dark. Signs advise that this is a
strenuous route, and my friend's
aching muscles concurred. We
climbed up through mostly red
woods, and then followed the ridge
(which has very steep sides) most
of the way. This leg of the trip took
about three-and-a-half hours. The
trail camp has an outhouse and
piped-in water (drinking from the
streams is not advised). Open fires,
except campstoves, are prohibited.
The next morning, after much

moaning and groaning from my
friend the 'experienced out
doorsman,' we took the Berry
Creek Falls trail down to the
Skyline-Sea trail. Berry Creek Falls
trail is very steep and follows the
creek on a down past some pretty
nice falls. Here the forest is very
wet and the intensity of the greens
is fantastic.
The Skyline-Sea trail from Berry
Creek on is all downhill, but not too
steep. There are several loop trails

off of it, and some that lead back to
park headquarters. Since no camp
ing is allowed at the beach, several
trail camps have been established
about two miles from the end of the
trail.
The trail ends at Waddeli Beach,
just south of Ano Nuevo Point on
Highway 1. This is a lovely place to
end a hike, especially if your friends
are coming to take you home, as
ours were (although they had a little
trouble spotting my friend in his

cammies). Santa Cruz County
Transit runs a bus line from the
beach to park headquarters, so you
can get back on your own.
Big Basin is a great place to "get
away from it all." Winter, though
wet, can be the best time of year to
camp there, because there is little
demand for sites. But at any time of
the year, the beautiful scenery and
extensive trail systems make Big
Basin one of the Bay Area's most
desirable places to visit.
