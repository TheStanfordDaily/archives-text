For the Stanford freshman eager
to date but unfortunately sans
voiture comes La Crepe Chouette,
a quaint French restaurant tucked
away in a campus Row house and
opened for business on Saturday
nights.
Several students in the French
House run La Crepe Chouette, or
"The Great Crepe," and do almost
all the cooking, serving and cleaning
themselves — their only outside
help is that of the ever-cheerful
Felicia Lee.
The menu is simple and the food
is good. Crepes available include
chicken and sliced almonds, ham
and cheese, and spinach and mush

rooms. Quiche is also offered.
A set meal for two — crepes,
salad, dessert and a beverage —
ranges from $8-$l2, and the
management may toss in some
complimentary wine if the mood is
right. The chicken crepes make for
a tasty entree, and the chocolate
mousse and Grand Marnier crepes
highlight the dessert selections.
Musical entertainment contri
butes to a pleasant atmosphere.
The dining rooms are romantically
candle-lit and the tables are

pleasantly decorated with red
checkered tablecloths and flowers
in wine bottles.
House officers there say they run
the once-a-week restaurant mostly
as a service to the community but
also as a money-making operation.
The cooks, waiters and waitresses
are not paid.
La Crepe Chouette will be having
a Viennese Ball special tomorrow
night from 5 to 9 p.m. Patrons are
encouraged to call the French
House phone to make reservations.
