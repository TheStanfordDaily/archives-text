## Track Travels To LSU 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
Most of the travelers headed to
Louisiana this weekend will be
dreaming of point spreads and
Super Bowl payoffs, but Stanford
Coach Brooks Johnson and his track
and field squad will have a different
competition in mind â€” the . pres
tigious LSU Invitational in Baton
Rouge.
Louisiana may seem like a long
way to go for a track meet, but the
LSU Invitational today and tomor
row should be worth the trip. The
field includes 28 men's teams and
26 women's squads and reads like a
"Who's Who" list of Southern track
powerhouses.
In the men's meet the Cardinal
will come up against the likes of
Baylor, Rice, Auburn, the Univer
sity of Houston and SMU, all of
whom have placed highly in recent
NCAA championships. Baylor will
be especially tough, as the team will
be returning the majority of a squad
that placed third in last year's
NCAA Indoors Championships and
second in the Outdoors Champion
ships.
And if that sounds like good com
petition, throw in some Olympians
who will be competing unattached,
and you've really got a talented
field.
The LSU sports information
director has confirmed that Olym
pians A 1 Joyner and Mark McCoy,
and possibly a couple of others, will
compete right alongside the college
athletes. McCoy will take part in
the long jump and Joyner will join
the triple jump field.
For Stanford, Johnson will enter
15 athletes in a wide variety of
events. The Cardinal's best chance
for a victory will most likely come

In another superb performance, Todd Lichti pumped in 18 points last night to help pace the Card
inal to a 76-70 win over UCLA. "He thrives on ... the pressure," Stanford Coach Tom Davis said
of Lichti after the game.
