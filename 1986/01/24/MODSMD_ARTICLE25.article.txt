# Hapless Bruins Fall to Stanford
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Yesterday in this space, The Daily ran a story that said the UCLA men's
basketball team would play Stanford in Maples Pavilion last night. We were
apparently wrong.
Oh sure, a bunch of guys wearing blue and gold played a game last night.
They bore no resemblance to UCLA, though. Stanford came out, shot 67
percent in the first half, killed the Bruins on the boards, and came away
with a 76-70 victory in front of a virtually lifeless gathering of 6,905.
Stanford is now 3-4 in the Pacific 10 Conference, 9-10 overall, and now
tied with USC for sixth place in the conference. UCLA falls into fifth place
at 3-3 in the Pac-10, 8-6 overall.
To the its credit, Stanford looked like a winner at the end, sticking its
free throws down the stretch and avoiding a relapse of games against
Washington, Arizona and California, when it let close games slip out of
reach. The Cardinal did what it had to, shooting 82 percent from the line in
the second half, including 13 of 14 in the final minute.
"When UCLA tried to make a run, we'd make a play or make a couple of
free throws," Cardinal Coach Tom Davis said. "We hung together tonight.
At times this year we've become unraveled, but not tonight."
UCLA Coach Walt Hazzard could only find one reason for the Bruins
looking as if they had forgetten to get off the plane. "Tonight we were just
beaten by a better team, a team that wanted to win more than we did."
Stanford forward Greg Butler, who scored 14 points, including 11 in the
first half, concurred. "They looked like they came out a little flat," he said.
"Sometimes on the road it's easy to go flat — you don't have the fans with
you, you make a good play and nobody cheers."
The Bruins were hamstrung by the total lack of an inside game. Starters
Jack Haley and Craig Jackson — UCLA's center and power forward —
each scored only two points, and Stanford outrebounded the Bruins by a
38-26 margin.
Stanford showed more man-to-man defense last night than it has all
year, and the move did nothing to hurt the cause. "We set out in the man,
and that helps us rebound," Butler said. "It lets everyone pick out one man
and check out that one man. When we went to the zone, we kept checking
out one man."
"That's the most man we've played in a lot of games, and it was effec
tive," Davis said.
The Cardinal shooters came out scorching in the first half, with Butler
and Novian Whitsitt leading the way. Whitsitt had missed the Cardinal's last
four games with a pulled muscle in his back, but entered the game to a
standing ovation three minutes into the game and proceeded to go 5-of-7
from the field in the first half and finish with a team-high 19 points.
"He was on fire the first half," Davis said. "He carried us, and so did
Greg Butler."
Whitsitt slumped in the second half, hitting only l-of-7, but largely due to
fatigue. "I just got really tired. I didn't have any legs on my jumper," he
said. He hadn't run in practice for two weeks before Monday.
At the end, guard Keith Ramee took charge for the Cardinal. "There
aren't many players better at bring
ing the ball down the court than
Keith Ramee," Davis said.
"Whatever he shoots from the line
normally, he's that much better in
the last five or six minutes. And I
think Todd Lichti is of the same cut
— he thrives on the free throws, on
the pressure."
Lichti had another routinely bril
liant night, scoring 18 points on a
combination of lean-in jumpers,
long bombs and seemingly absurd
layups. He also added seven
rebounds.
Forward Reggie Miller tried to
pick up the slack for UCLA, scoring
28 points, including 19 in the
second half, while playing the entire
game.
Although Stanford led most of
the game, including the entire
second half, the crowd, about 600
short of a sellout, never really got
into the game. Even during the four
UCLA timeouts in the final minute
as the Cardinal hung precariously to
a slim lead, the crowd was
strangely silent.
It was a decided contrast to the
75-64 victory over UCLA two
years ago, when the crowd rushed
onto the floor following the win and
danced for an hour as the Band
played. Last night, the students sat
in polite silence as UCLA shot cru
cial free throws in the final minutes
and orderly filed out after the final
buzzer sounded.
"It didn't excite the crowd as
much — and they had been terrific
for us — but there wasn't the spon
taneous enthusiasm that there was
then," Davis said in comparing the
two games. "But that was the first
time we had beaten them in a while."

UCLA Coach Walt Hazzard could only find one reason for the Bruins
looking as if they had forgetten to get off the plane. "Tonight we were just
beaten by a better team, a team that wanted to win more than we did."
Stanford forward Greg Butler, who scored 14 points, including 11 in the
first half, concurred. "They looked like they came out a little flat," he said.
"Sometimes on the road it's easy to go flat — you don't have the fans with
you, you make a good play and nobody cheers."
The Bruins were hamstrung by the total lack of an inside game. Starters
Jack Haley and Craig Jackson — UCLA's center and power forward —
each scored only two points, and Stanford outrebounded the Bruins by a
38-26 margin.
Stanford showed more man-to-man defense last night than it has all
year, and the move did nothing to hurt the cause. "We set out in the man,
and that helps us rebound," Butler said. "It lets everyone pick out one man
and check out that one man. When we went to the zone, we kept checking
out one man."
"That's the most man we've played in a lot of games, and it was effec
tive," Davis said.
The Cardinal shooters came out scorching in the first half, with Butler
and Novian Whitsitt leading the way. Whitsitt had missed the Cardinal's last
four games with a pulled muscle in his back, but entered the game to a
standing ovation three minutes into the game and proceeded to go 5-of-7
from the field in the first half and finish with a team-high 19 points.
"He was on fire the first half," Davis said. "He carried us, and so did
Greg Butler."
Whitsitt slumped in the second half, hitting only l-of-7, but largely due to
fatigue. "I just got really tired. I didn't have any legs on my jumper," he
said. He hadn't run in practice for two weeks before Monday.
At the end, guard Keith Ramee took charge for the Cardinal. "There
aren't many players better at bring
ing the ball down the court than
Keith Ramee," Davis said.
"Whatever he shoots from the line
normally, he's that much better in
the last five or six minutes. And I
think Todd Lichti is of the same cut
— he thrives on the free throws, on
the pressure."
Lichti had another routinely bril
liant night, scoring 18 points on a
combination of lean-in jumpers,
long bombs and seemingly absurd
layups. He also added seven
rebounds.
Forward Reggie Miller tried to
pick up the slack for UCLA, scoring
28 points, including 19 in the
second half, while playing the entire
game.
Although Stanford led most of
the game, including the entire
second half, the crowd, about 600
short of a sellout, never really got
into the game. Even during the four
UCLA timeouts in the final minute
as the Cardinal hung precariously to
a slim lead, the crowd was
strangely silent.
It was a decided contrast to the
75-64 victory over UCLA two
years ago, when the crowd rushed
onto the floor following the win and
danced for an hour as the Band
played. Last night, the students sat
in polite silence as UCLA shot cru
cial free throws in the final minutes
and orderly filed out after the final
buzzer sounded.
"It didn't excite the crowd as
much — and they had been terrific
for us — but there wasn't the spon
taneous enthusiasm that there was
then," Davis said in comparing the
two games. "But that was the first
time we had beaten them in a while."

Novian Whitsitt, the Cardinal guard who has been out of the lineup with a shoulder injury,
returned last night to lead all Stanford scorers with 19 points.
Yesterday in this space, The Daily ran a story that said the UCLA men's
basketball team would play Stanford in Maples Pavilion last night. We were
apparently wrong.
Oh sure, a bunch of guys wearing blue and gold played a game last night.
They bore no resemblance to UCLA, though. Stanford came out, shot 67
percent in the first half, killed the Bruins on the boards, and came away
with a 76-70 victory in front of a virtually lifeless gathering of 6,905.
Stanford is now 3-4 in the Pacific 10 Conference, 9-10 overall, and now
tied with USC for sixth place in the conference. UCLA falls into fifth place
at 3-3 in the Pac-10, 8-6 overall.
To the its credit, Stanford looked like a winner at the end, sticking its
free throws down the stretch and avoiding a relapse of games against
Washington, Arizona and California, when it let close games slip out of
reach. The Cardinal did what it had to, shooting 82 percent from the line in
the second half, including 13 of 14 in the final minute.
"When UCLA tried to make a run, we'd make a play or make a couple of
free throws," Cardinal Coach Tom Davis said. "We hung together tonight.
At times this year we've become unraveled, but not tonight."
UCLA Coach Walt Hazzard could only find one reason for the Bruins
