# Take me out to the ballgame
## 'Next Year’ Begins Today 
### ROB GRAHAM Editorial staff 
It's that time of year again. It's
late January and there's still a
chill in the air. The leaves on the
trees are brown and the sky's
usually overcast.
That can mean only one thing.
Get those coolers and
scorecards ready, it's baseball
season.
That's right, baseball season.
And for some, fastpitch can
never come soon enough. Those
Friday and Saturday afternoons
sure can drag without balls and
strikes.
It's been seven long months
since Stanford last took the field
at the College World Series in
Omaha, Neb. And, you can be
sure, some fans started looking
forward to "next year" just after
the last out was made and the
bats and balls packed away.
"Next year" starts today —
the waiting's finally over. Stan
ford opens its season this
weekend with two games against
San Jose State.
Today the Cardinal, which
enters action as the 10th best
team in the country according to
a Baseball America poll, meets
the Spartans on the road with
the first pitch scheduled to be
thrown at 2 p.m. Avid watchers
could make the 45-minute drive
to San Jose today to see Stan
ford's Jack McDowell — 11-4
with a 4.15 earned run average a
year ago — square off against
Spartans' right-hander Larry
McEvoy.
The fun doesn't really begin
until tomorrow, though. That's
when Stanford is home for a 1
p.m. start against the same
Spartans. Admission is free for
students with a valid Stanford
ID. Adults will be charged $3 at
the gate; children, senior
citizens, faculty and staff must
pay $2.

Junior right-hander Rob
Wasenaar, 9-2 with a 4.06 ERA
last year, gets the nod to go
against San Jose's Ronald
Fritsch.
Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess doesn't expect much
from either of his starters. "We'll
be pleased if we can get four,
maybe five, innings out of
Wasenaar and McDowell," he
said. "But no more than that."
Marquess is more eager at
this early stage to see how his
young talent does against college
competition. "We're still not sure
what we have," Marquess said.
"I do know that it's going to be
difficult replacing what we lost."
Just how Stanford will replace
graduates Jeff Ballard (pitcher),
Rick Lundblade (first base), Pete
Stanicek (second) and John Ver
ducci (shortstop) should be the
story through the early-going of
the year.
Stanford finished as the
country's No. 5 team a year ago
but has lost three-fourths of its
infield and its best starting
pitcher. Now Marquess, who
was named The Sporting News'
NCAA Coach of the Year in
1985, is faced with building a
team out of a mixture of proven
talent and relative newcomers.
Card notes
Lance Shebelut, with only
five at-bats during his two-year
Stanford career, appears to be a
lock to start at first base.
Marquess calls the 6-foot-2
junior from Fresno "a good hitter
with great power." He'll be
asked to fill the shoes of 1985
Pac-10 Southern Division Player
of the Year Lundblade.
A battle for the starting
shortstop spot is brewing. Ken
Green, a senior, and junior
David Esquer have fought to
replace Verducci. Esquer will
play both SJS games this
weekend as Green rests a leg in
jury.

Cardinal sophomore Jack McDowell, a 1986 pre-season All-
America candidate, will get the nod as the starter in today's
game at San Jose State. Last year, McDowell compiled an 11-
4 record and a 4.15 ERA.
