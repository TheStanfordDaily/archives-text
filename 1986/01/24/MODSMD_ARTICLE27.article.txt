Saturday may be the last chance
Stanford fans will get to see USC's
Cheryl Miller perform in person.
Probably the most celebrated
athlete in the history of women's
basketball, Miller will be making her
final appearance in Maples Pavilion
Saturday when the Cardinal hosts
the No. 2 Trojans in a Pac-West
Conference showdown.
First things first, however.
Tonight Stanford (11-6) begins the
1986 conference season against the

8-9 UCLA Bruins. Both games
begin at 7:30 p.m.
The condensed version of the
Pacific 10 Conference, the Pac-
West, which consists of Stanford,
USC, UCLA, Arizona and Arizona
State, will expand to a 10-team for
mat next year.
The winner of the Pac-West wiU
not automatically receive an NCAA
tournament bid. However, if any
team appears likely to gain an at
large berth in the championship
