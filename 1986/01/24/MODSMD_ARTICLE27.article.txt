Conference showdown.
First things first, however.

tournament, it's the Trojans.
USC (15-2) recently opened its
conference season with impressive
wins over Arizona and Arizona
State by scores of 93-72 and 95-61,
respectively.
The women of Troy boast a well
balanced offensive attack led by Mil
ler, the nation's leading scorer at
25.9 points per game.

"They have a balanced lineup,"
she said. "They have a good point
guard and a good off guard. As a
team, they're very quick." But she
concedes the real strength lies with
Miller's dominant inside game.
As for weaknesses in the Trojan
lineup, there aren't many.
The Bruins, on the other hand,
aren't quite as formidable.
However, a recent four-point loss
to a highly regarded Tennessee
squad indicates UCLA won't be a
pushover either.
