# Gymnasts Open PacWest
## Women Head South 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
When the Stanford women's
gymnastics team arrives in South
ern California today, its immediate
concern will be tonight's meet
against USC, but its main concern
will be tomorrow afternoon's meet
against No. 7 UCLA.
"I know UCLA will be the harder
meet," Stanford standout Beth
Pope said. And so does her coach,
Homer Sardina. All the gymnasts
will be taking it easy tonight, and
two of them, Alison McGann and
Jinny Rhee, won't even be compet
ing, according to Sardina.
This weekend's meets will be the
first PacWest competitions for the
Cardinal, who handily defeated UC-
Davis and Chico State last weekend
in their first meet of the season.
Stanford, with only five freshmen
and one sophomore competing, was
led by Rhee and Cheryl Doo. Rhee
and Pope will be expected to lead
the squad against UCLA.
Traditionally, the Bruins have
had a strong program, and the

tradition didn't end this year. They
are led by freshman Tanya Service,
who won the all-around at the
recent Long Beach Invitational
where the Bruins finished first.
Also competing for UCLA is Gigi
Zosa, a member of the 1984
Canadian Olympic Team.
In the past, the Bruins have
dominated the Cardinal. "UCLA is
probably six . . . and one against
us," Sardina said.
Just like last week, Sardina is not
necessarily looking for a win out of
this weekend's meets but, instead,
to "get our feet on the competitive
floor." This means the gymnasts
will not be taking risks in their
routines, and will stick to what they
do best.
"We're probably a top-10 team,"
Sardina said. He expects Stanford
to have a sure spot among the na
tion's elite by the time the season is
in full swing, and he hopes this will
attract a crowd to Maples Pavilion
when the Cardinal host the nation's
best later in the winter.
"Good fan support is a real ad
vantage in college competitions,"
he said.
