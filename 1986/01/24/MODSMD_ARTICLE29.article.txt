## Cardinal to combat three opponents tomorrow in San Francisco 
### LISA MARTINEZ Staff writer 
Eagerly awaiting their next challenge, the
Stanford fencers take on the U.S. Air Force
Academy, the University of San Francisco,
San Francisco State and Cal-State Fullerton
tomorrow at the University of San Francisco.
The Cardinal will combat its most formidable
competition of the tournament when they face
Air Force early tomorrow morning.
"Air Force is a perennially strong team,"
Stanford Coach Buzz Hurst said. "They should
tend to be strong in foil and epee, but I think
what will make the difference for us is sabre."
According to Hurst, this will be a grudge
match for Stanford.

"Last year, we defeated their men with
some gusto, but we lost to their women's team
9-7 due to injuries," Hurst said. "There is
definitely some desire to get revenge this
year."
The Cardinal men and women will then chal
lenge San Francisco and San Francisco State,
respectively, in what will be each opponent's
second bout of the season.
"In our last bouts, we had no trouble with
the USF men other than a close epee match,
but San Francisco State gave the women fits,"
Hurst said. "I suspect a challenge from them,
although our women have gained their identity
since our last meet against these schools."
In the final bout of the tournament, Stanford

will fence Cal-State Fullerton.
"Fullerton is always a well-balanced team,"
Hurst said. "We've never had tdo much trouble
with the men, but the women's team is con
siderably stronger than last year."
Hurst expects outstanding performances
from three seniors, women's team captain
Jennifer Yu, men's foil captain Elliott Cheu,
sabre team captain Andy Goorno.
"Jennifer is now 32-0 in the regular season
while Elliott is 23-3," Hurst said. "Andy,
clearly the outstanding men's performer of last
weekend, is now 21-2."
According to Hurst, the Cardinal teams will
be at full strength this weekend.
