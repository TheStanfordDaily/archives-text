# Students Plan Refugee Haven
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
A group of 25 students
approved plans last night to launch a
campaign to have the Stanford
campus formally proclaimed a sanc
tuary for Central American
refugees.
The plan adopted by the group
entails both a petition drive to in
crease public awareness and an or
ganized effort to encourage the
ASSU Senate to put a sanctuary
referendum in the ASSU general
elections this spring.
If adopted, the sanctuary mea
sure would actively promote Stan
ford as a safe haven for political
refugees in cooperation with Bay
Area sanctuary organizations such
as the Committee of El Salvador
Refugees (CORES) and the South

Bay Sanctuary Covenant, an or
ganization of local churches. Possi
ble actions could include the es
tablishment of "safe" housing on
campus or financial assistance for
the refugees.
Financial support would be used
to assist refugees in finding local
housing and jobs, in addition to pos
ting bonds for refugees if they face
prosecution by the U.S. Immigra
tion and Naturalization Service.
Bonds might also be necessary for
students if accused of harboring,
transporting or concealing
refugees.
In its attempts to win support for
the measure, students said they
would stress humanitarian concerns
as well as the political debate on
U.S. Central American policy.
"When talking with students, the
most important thing to stress is
the human element," said Simon
Durcan, a member of the group.
"The sanctuary movement doesn't
have to be politicized."
An education and information
campaign will also be needed to
help overcome the sanctuary move
ment's "low profile," according to
group member Max Peltz.

Group members heard an urgent
plea for help from "Theresa," a
refugee who four months ago fled
with her three young children from
the "great repression" of El Sal
vador.
"I want to ask you to (tell) your
government that we in El Salvador
are tired of all the military aid
(while) there are many people who
are dying of hunger," she said. "It's
a struggle of my people, and no one
should get in the middle of it."
Sanctuary efforts around the
country are in response to the small

number of Central American
refugees who are granted political
asylum by the U.S. State Depart
ment, proponents said.
The first campus sanctuary was
organized by UC-Riverside
graduate students in February of
1984. Graduate student groups
were also instrumental in adding
UC-Berkeley, UC-Fresno, UC-
Riverside, UC-San Diego and the
University of Colorado-Boulder to
the docket of institutions whose
campuses are now sanctuary
zones.
