### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Now the real season begins. The Stanford men's gymnastics teams has
had five meets this season, but tonight at UCLA, Stanford Coach Sa ao
Hamada will be entering his team at full strength for the first time.
"This is the one we're really psyched up for," Hamada said. T/vere
going to have a very competitive meet."
The competition is a Bruin team which hopes to continue its traditional
dominance of men's collegiate gymnastics. This tradition includes former
Bruins Mitch Gaylord, Peter Vidmar and Tim Daggett, three members of
the gold-medal winning 1984 U.S. Olympic team.
The meet will take place in UCLA's Pauley Pavilion, the site of the
Olympic gymnastics competition. This makes the meet even more excit
ing, according to Stanford freshman Scott Shaffer, who also pointed out
that Stanford's gym is the home of the actual pommel horse used at the
Los Angeles Olympic Games.
According to Hamada, the Cardinal will need to post a team score of at
least 275 points to have any hope of beating the Bruins.
Stanford will be entering four gymnasts, Randy Besosa, John Louis,
Mike Matzek and Chuck Gerardo, in the all-around competition, and
Hamada said he looks to this quartet to pace the Cardinal. Besosa and
Louis are both members of the U.S. National Team.
Leading the way for the Bruins will be U.S. National Team members
Rob Campbell and Brian Ginsberg. In UCLA's only previous meet against
Cal-State Fullerton, Campbell won the all-around as UCLA racked up an
impressive team score of 275.10.
Hamada expects the Cardinal to be strongest in the rings and the vault,
while its weakest points will be the pommel horse and parallel bars.
