### MARY K. McDEVITT Staff writer 
The Stanford women's swim
team will face the USC Trojans
today at the McDonald's Olympic
Pool in Southern California in the
first of a pair of rigorous Pac West
dual meets this weekend.
Today's meet with the No. 5
Trojans and tomorrow's affair with
the No. 9 UCLA Bruins should be
the toughest Pac West matchups
the Cardinal, ranked No. 2, will
have all year.
The Trojans may be marginally
stronger than UCLA, but Stanford
is not taking either meet for
granted.

"We're sort of geared toward
USC, but UCLA should be just as
tough of a meet," freshman frees
tyler Aimee Berzins said.
"They're ready to swim us just
as much as we're excited to swim
them," she said.
The Cardinal has been gearing
toward the meets the past several
weeks and will be looking to regis
ter some quick times.
'We're gonna rest up," Berzins
said. "Racing in the Olympic Pool is
the perfect opportunity to swim as
fast as we can right now.
The Olympic Pool is one of the
fastest pools in the world, and
several Cardinal swimmers will be
shooting for NCAA qualifying
times.
