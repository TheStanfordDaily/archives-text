# Grapplers Strong For All Cal Invite
## 
### PETER CASTILLO Staff writer 
For the first time since
Christmas, the Stanford wrestling
team should be at full strength
when it travels to San Francisco to
morrow to compete in the All Cal
Invitational.
The All Cal is the state champi
onship, and every school in Califor
nia with a wrestling program is en
tered. The Cardinal captured
second last year, its highest placing
ever, and was only four points be
hind Cal-State Bakersfield. Other
schools that could vie for the title
are Fresno State, Cal-Poly San Luis
Obispo and San Jose State.
"The guys that do really well at
this tournament should do similarly
at the Pac-10 Championships. Last
year our four NCAA qualifiers, Jeff
Bradley, Dave Lee, Tom Mullen
and Scott Wiggen, were in the
finals," Stanford Coach Chris Hor

pel said. "A finalist here should be a
NCAA qualifier."
Lee (167 pounds) will have a
tough time defending his title, as he
will likely face long-time rival Fred
Little of Fresno State in the finals.
Little holds a 4-2-1 advantage over
Lee, but in their last meeting Qan.
16) Little had to fight back for the
tie.
Bradley, who is the defending
champion at 134 pounds, has not
been wrestling well recently, ac
cording to Horpel, and Horpel
hopes Bradley can rebound at the
tournament. The Pacific 10 Cham
pionships are only little more than a
month away, and it is important for
Bradley to regain some positive
momentum.
"The wrestlers who are doing
well will identify a few problems.
The others should get a confidence
boost if they do well. It is just an
other tournament, but we will do
better here than in our duals," Hor
pel said.
