# The 						team heads to Mexico
## Golfers Face Tough Test 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
A trip to Mexico in January is an appealing thought,
even during the relatively mild winters of the Bay
Area.
While they won't exactly be on vacation, the Stan
ford women's golf team will be sunning themselves on
the greens in Mexico starting this Sunday during the
three-day Oklahoma State Intercollegiate in Guadalajara.
The Cardinal, ranked third nationally and first in the
Far West Region of the NCAA, will be opening the
second half of their split season against several of the
top teams in the country.
Leading the competition will be top-ranked Tulsa,
followed by Florida (No. 2), Louisiana State (No. 6),
Southern Methodist (No. 8) and other top-20 clubs like
Miami, Furman, Oklahoma State, Texas A&M and
Oklahoma.
The tournament, sponsored by OSU, the Mexican
Federation of Golf and the city of Guadalajara, will also
feature the Mexican national women's team. The

tournament sponsors will be paying most of the Card
inal's expenses.
Despite the team's inactivity for over the last two
months, Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin is optimistic
about the squad's chances in Mexico — and for the
entire season.
"(The layoff) is like having taken the whole summer
off," Baldwin said.. "We won't be as sharp as we were
at the end of the fall season. (But) the team is practic
ing very, very well. I wouldn't be satisfied unless we
finished in the top three.
"For us to beat Tulsa and Florida would take maxi
mum effort from all five," Baldwin added. "I've got
confidence, though, that if we don't beat them here,
we can beat them down the road in the NCAA Champi
onship."
The Cardinal will be without the services of the
Stanford Fall Invitational individual champion, Julie Car
michael, who is taking her business school entrance
exams tomorrow. However, Stanford will still be en
tering a strong starting five of Kay Cornelieus (ranked
eighth nationally), Clare Dolan, Kathy Kostas, Kath
leen McCarthy and Trish McGonigle.
