# Card Prepares For Dallas Meet
## 
### AMY FRANCETIC Staff writer 
Eight swimmers from the
Stanford men's swim team fly to
Texas this weekend to compete
in the Dallas Morning News
Classic (DMNC). Stanford Coach
Skip Kenney is taking Olympians
Pablo Morales, Jeff Kostoff and
John Moffet, as well as Dave
Lundberg, Sean Murphy, An
thony Mosse, Dave Louden and
John Hodge to participate in the
meet.
Six of the top seven teams
from last year's NCAA Cham
pionships will race in Dallas, and
UCLA is highly favored to win.
"This meet is not really set up

for our type of team," Asst.
Coach Ted Knapp said. "There's
a good deal of relays, and UCLA
has got some great sprinters."
"We're counting on good per
formances from Morales, Kos
toff and Moffet, but Murphy is
just getting over an illness and
won't be swimming 100 per
cent," Knapp said. Sophmore
Matt Nance, sick with
mononucleosis, will be out of ac
tion. "He could have helped a
lot," Knapp said.
This is the first time Florida
State will participate in the
DMNC, and Stanford will watch
them carefully. FSU promises to
be Stanford's most threatening
opponent in this year's NCAA
Championships in April.
