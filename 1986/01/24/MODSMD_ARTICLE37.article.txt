NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The
television commentators for Sun
day's Super Bowl don't expect to
have a lot of scoring to talk about.
"I wouldn't be surprised to see a
7-3 score at halftime," said NFL
Hall of Famer Merlin Olsen, who
will be in the NBC broadcast booth
with former Super Bowl quarter
back Bob Griese and Dick Enberg.
NBC has projected that about
115 million Americans would see its
live telecast. Millions more in 35
other nations will see a videotaped
replay. The replay audience in
cludes an unknown number of
people in mainland China for the
first time, according to Val
Pinchbeck, the NFL's director of
broadcasting.
