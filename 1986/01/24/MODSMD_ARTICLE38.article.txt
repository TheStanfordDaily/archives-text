Weapons Sale to China Planned
PEKING — The Reagan Administration is preparing to notify
Congress soon of its intent to carry out its largest military weapons
sale yet to China, according to Western diplomats here.
The United States is planning to sell the Chinese air force ad
vanced avionics — that is, radar, navigation and fire-control equip
ment — for China's F-8 interceptor planes. The size of the sale is un
certain because it will not be put out for bids until after congressional
authorization is obtained, but it is estimated that the total amount will
be several hundred million dollars.
The impending deal was first disclosed earlier this month by a
Washington correspondent for the Far Eastern Economic Review.
Western diplomats here confirmed the report, and said that they ex
pect that the Administration will formally notify Congress of the deal
within the next few weeks, perhaps even before Feb. 1.
Officials at the U. S. Embassy in Peking declined to comment on
the weapons sale, saying that all information about it would have to
be released in Washington. Pentagon officials in Washington also
declined to comment.
The avionics deal would be only the second government-to
government arms sale between the United States and China. The
first, sent to Congress last September, was a relatively uncontrover
sial $98 million sale of a design and equipment for China to build a fac
tory for artillery and other ammunition.
Under federal law, the executive branch is required to notify
Congress of any major foreign arms sale. The sale is then official un
less Congress objects within 30 days. Congress did not otoject to the
first arms sale to China last fall.
Analysts here said that the avionics deal could be worth anywhere
from $200 million to $1 billion to U.S. defense contractors, depend
ing in part on how many planes China decides to upgrade.
The sale of avionics has been under consideration for several
years, dating back at least to the 1983 visit to Peking by Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger.
It could provoke strong opposition from Taiwan and from Taiwan's
supporters in Congress, who have sought to prevent a deepening of
the military relationship between the United States and China.
Taiwan's representative in the United States, Fredrick Chien,
recently returned to Taipei for consulations, and Sen. Barry
Goldwater (R-Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Com
mittee and one of Taiwan's most important congressional allies,
recently visited Taiwan.
Aquino Vows Sweeping Reforms
MANILA, Philippines — Philippine opposition presidential candi
date Corazon Aquino yesterday issued a program of political
measures to "tear down the dictatorship" of President Ferdinand
Marcos and warned him not to "frustrate the will of the people" in
next month's election.
In her most scathing speech so far in her campaign for the
presidency, Aquino described Marcos as a "dying dictator" strug
gling to hold on to power through an electoral campaign of "brazen
lies." She pledged that, if elected, she would "dismantle the dic
tatorial edifice Mr. Marcos has built" during his 20 years in power
and, in its place, "build for our people a genuine democracy."
For the first time, Aquino also said she would jail those guilty of
corruption and of illegally investing "hidden wealth" abroad. A con
gressional subcommittee in Washington is looking into charges that
Marcos and his wife, Imelda, have invested at least $250 million in
New York real estate as part of a multibillion-dollar export of capital
by the Philippine ruling elite. Aquino also has indicated previously
that, if elected, she would put Marcos on trial for the 1983 assassina
tion of her husband, Benigno Aquino, Jr.
Saudis Warn of Oil Price War
WASHINGTON — A renewed warning of an oil price war by Saudi
Arabia's energy minister helped keep oil prices sliding downward
yesterday, for the sixth day in a row.
Once again, the trading in London and on the New York Mercantile
Exchange was volatile and heavy. The selling began yesterday in
Europe after Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the Saudi oil minister, warned of
an unrestrained price war unless Great Britain and other producers
outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agree
with OPEC to limit oil production.
Without an agreement, "There will be no limitation to the
downward price spiral, which may bring crude prices t6 less than $15
a barrel, with adverse and dangerous consequences for the whole
world economy," Yamani said, according to OPEC's official news
agency.
A month ago, $20 a barrel represented the low end of most
analysts' forecasts. But yesterday's prices of Brent North Sea crude
oil, the benchmark oil on European commodity markets, plunged to
$17.70 a barrel in early trading before closing at about $18.30 a bar
rel, compared with Wednesday's price of $19.90 a barrel. The prices
are for contracts to buy or sell oil for delivery in February.
Tribal Fighting Leaves 30 Dead
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Zulu warriors, in a vengeful
continuation of their bitter feud with Pondo tribesmen, attacked a
Pondo settlement south of Durban yesterday, killing at least 30 per
sons and razing almost the entire shantytown.
Armed with spears, machetes, war clubs and homemade guns, the
Zulus, estimated to number more than 1,000, drove the Pondos out
of the Kwamakhuta section of Umbogintwini, just south of the Dur
ban airport on the Indian Ocean coast, and then burned to the ground
most of the hillside settlement's 4,000 shacks.
The Pondos, who had beaten the Zulus decisively in a series of
battles in the area during Christmas week when 63 persons were
killed, were outnumbered two to one and had to flee for their lives
into the Umbumbulu hills, according to police and eyewitness ac
counts.
Irish Vote Tests New Accord
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Protestants and Catholics in this
bitterly divided province turned out in large numbers yesterday to
vote in the first major test of public support for last November's
Anglo-Irish agreement giving the Irish Republic a say in Northern
Ireland's affairs.
Amid tight security that included armed police at polling stations,
voting went off peacefully in what is widely seen as a referendum on
the accord. Vote counting is scheduled to start Friday morning, with
the results expected before the end of the day.
