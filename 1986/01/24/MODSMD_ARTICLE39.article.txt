# Reagan seeks expanded covert efforts
## U.S. Orders Flight Operations off Libya 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administra
tion yesterday ordered two aircraft carrier battle
groups in the Mediterranean to begin flight
operations north of Libya, Defense Department
officials said.
The warplane operations, scheduled to begin
from the carriers USS Saratoga and USS Coral
Sea Thursday night, were described by one Ad
ministration official yesterday as "part of the war
of nerves" between the Reagan Administration
and the Libyan leader, Moammar Khadafy. The
Navy planes will be within range of Libyan radar
as they fly training exercises but are under or
ders not to cross into Libyan airspace, the official
said.
The carrier operations are the latest in a se
ries of maneuvers by the Administration in an at

tempt to show resolve against Khadafy, who has
been repeatedly accused of supporting interna
tional terrorism. Earlier this month, Reagan an
nounced further economic sanctions against
Libya.
At the same time, in White House meetings
Jan. 6 and 7, Reagan also ordered that more
money and manpower be devoted to the devel
opment of a CIA covert operation against
Khadafy and that an envoy be sent to Egypt for
further discussions about coordinating possible
military options, sources said.
Although there have been discussions within
the Administration recently about ambitious anti-
Libyan military options, the sources said that at
this point joint action by the United States and its
Middle East allies would be undertaken only if

Khadafy attacks a neighboring nation or is found
to be responsible for terrorist actions similar to
the Dec. 27 attacks on the Rome and Vienna air
ports.
The first indication of the warplane exercises
came yesterday when the Pentagon confirmed
that the Navy had issued a "Notice of Intent to
Conduct Flight Operations" through the Interna
tional Civil Aeronautical Organization.
that document, which is not classified, says car
rier flight operations will be conducted for a
week within the Tripoli Flight Information
Region, a sector of airspace extending scores of
miles from Libya.
White House officials denied reports that the
current exercise was intended to provoke
Khadafy.
