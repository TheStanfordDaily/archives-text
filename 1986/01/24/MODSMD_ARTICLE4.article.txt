# Financing Crisis Transforms Medical Center
## FEATURES 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
This is the second in a two-part series on the
effects of changes in health care financing on
the Stanford Medical Center.
An "authentic crisis" in health care financ
ing has hit the academic medical centers, ac
cording to University President Donald Ken
nedy, and the resulting financial pressures
are transforming a variety of relationships at
Stanford.
One such relationship is that between
physicians and hospital managers. With finan
cial viability becoming a major concern at
hospitals and medical centers everywhere,
there has been what Stanford Economics
Prof. Victor Fuchs described in a 1982 article
for Health Affairs magazine as a "battle line
emerging between ... a fiercely indepen

dent profession and a management structure
that seeks to gain further control over what
doctors do."
At Stanford, a potentially adversarial rela
tionship between physicians and managers
has instead remained cooperative, according
to Fuchs, hospital managers and many
physicians. But they explain that the new en
vironment has altered the nature of the rela
tionship.
Faculty relations with community
physicians and with each other are also
changing, as are patients' relations with doc
tors and nurses.
The "crisis" stems from nationwide efforts
to gain control over skyrocketing health care
costs, which have risen from $52 to nearly
$400 billion since 1950 an J nave grown in
their percentage of the gross national product
from 4.4 to 10 percent.
As a result, there have been dramatic

changes in the ways that both public and
private sectors reimburse hospitals and
physicians.
"The threat that the university medical
centers face is from a set of policies that favor
cost competition for the routine stuff and then
expect the university hospitals to take on the
load of managing the severe illnesses, many
of them in charity patients, without adequate
reimbursement," Kennedy said, "and that is
a financial formula to kill the university medi
cal centers."
The result has been an increasingly com
petitive health care environmen but one in
which academic medical centei are disad
vantaged "because of the severity of illness in
their patient mix and because of their respon
sioiiiiies to giauuate medical education,"
Kennedy said.
As the environment changes, so does the
evolving love-hate relationship between Stan

ford faculty and community physicians.
Stanford has an unusual relationship with
community physicians because it has a con
tract with the city of Palo Alto that requires
that local physicians be granted medical
privileges at Stanford Hospital. As a result,
780 of the 1,147 active physicians on the
hospital's staff are community physicians.
"The community physicians in our geogra
phic area as a rule are excellent and our inter
action with them is excellent," said oncologist
Robert Carlson, an assistant professor at the
medical school.
But the relationship has been characterized
as one of "acidity" by Hospital President
Sheldon King.
A prime source of contention between
some of the members of the two groups has
been the issue of access to specialized labora-
tones, such as X-ray, cardiac cat
heterization and electrophysiology
labs.
Before changes in the health
care economy led to a significant
decline in the patient census —
largely the result of an ever
shrinking length of stay in the
hospital — and decreased labora
tory use, complaints by faculty
members to hospital and medical
school administrators led the
Hospital Board of Directors to issue
what became known as the "August
memorandum" of 1979. The
memorandum restricted laboratory
access to Stanford faculty mem
bers, angering many community
physicians.
"The relationship of the two
groups of physicians on the access
issue has been alleviated," said
radiologist James Silverman, chief
of the medical staff and associate
dean of Clinical Affairs. He cited a
"limited access" compromise which
has since been worked out. The
compromise allows community
physicians to apply for a certain
number of openings at the laborato
ries, provided they are members of
a group of clinical physicians that

teaches and supervises Stanford
residents, interns and medical stu
dents of a voluntary basis.
"That's not to say the physicians
like each other any more or are any
more interested in working to
gether, but because of the hospi
tal's need for patients, there has
been some acquiescence," Silver
man said.
The reopening process began a
few years ago, but was only com
pleted with the opening of cardiol
ogy laboratories to community
physicians in the last few months,
Silverman said.
Relations between the two
physician groups have also become
more "complicated" because "now,
we are realizing that the universe of
patients is restricted and we are
competing for the same patients,"
said Medical Staff President Mel
Britain, a rheumatologist who
directs the Palo Alto Medical
Clinic's HMO: Take Care.
Prompted by a high level of bed
occupancy at Stanford in the 1960s
and '70s, community physicians
became leaders in developing and
administering more services on an
outpatient basis. New methods of
reimbursement added to these in
centives at Stanford as well, and in
recent years the medical center has
begun to offer a variety of out

patient services which directly
compete with pre-established pro
grams in the community , such as
same-day surgery.
In addition, while Stanford has a
reputation for excellence in highly
specialized care, the number of
referrals from other physicians
have been declining both due to the
increasing sophistication of
medicine in the area and the limita
tions imposed by HMOs and other
forms of insurance that apply only
to certain hospitals or groups of
doctors.
To maintain the patient base ne
cessary to pay faculty salaries,
keep the hospital financially viable
and meet the medical school's edu
cational needs, primary care
practice will now need to receive
more emphasis, according to a
report released last month by a task
force set up last January to study
the problem. Primary care is non
specialized treatment of patients
and generally deals with more
routine illnesses.
The emphasis will necessitate
the hiring of additional physicians
for the Stanford Clinic, according to
Prof. Keith Taylor, a gastroen
terologist. The clinic is the base of
medical practice for 290 faculty
clinicians. Doctors in the areas of
primary care, primarily in internal

medicine, obstetrics and gynecol
ogy, and pediatrics, serve as the
"gatekeepers" to the hospital,
Taylor said, adding that more are
needed.
Such changes will increase the
levels at which Stanford and com
munity physicians compete.
Counterbalancing this competi
tion are efforts to maintain good
relations, such as measures to im
prove communication with referring
physicians. "I think physicians are
realizing that we aren't going to get
patients unless they start treating
(community) physicians with
respect and equality," said one
nurse, who explained that over the
years she has observed in some
Stanford physicians an "attitude
that you guys (community
physicians) don't really know what
you're doing so just leave it to us."
She said projects have recently
been launched to increase consulta
tion and communication with the
doctors about the patients they
refer.
King and others stress the im
portance of developing new kinds of
cooperative relationships with
other hospitals to adapt to the new
health care environment. He said
Stanford is investigating joining
other hospitals to form "networks
which would involve having Stan

ford act as a referral center," and
creating resource purchasing and
sharing arrangements, with possi
ble joint teaching programs as well.
The increasing emphasis at the
medical school on patient care in
light of changing economic circum
stances has largely settled what had
been an ongoing debate among the
faculty over the school's emphasis.
Many faculty members had
argued for a continuation of Stan
ford's traditional emphasis on re
search, an area which brought
Stanford its reputation as a pace
setter in many fields. Clinicians and
basic researchers differed on the
desirable distribution of faculty and
resources and the criteria for se
lecting medical students.
However, "It is impossible to
have a discussion of matters such
as emphasis on clinical care in a
vacuum," said Carlson. "Changing
methods of reimbursement as well
as tightening of federal funding from
the federal government for basic
research has to affect that discus
sion. "
According to Kennedy, "patient
care is now twice as important [to
the'medical school] in relation to re
search as it was six to eight years
ago."
The new circumstances may
have resolved some issues at the

medical center, but they have
created others. Some clinicians, in
cluding Surgery Prof. Thomas
Stamey, head of urology, and Car
diovascular Surgery Prof. Norman
Shumway have complained that
certain departments that bring in
substantial revenues through their
clinical work are doing a dispropor
tionate share of the work load and
thus subsidizing the research of
other departments. All depart
ments should become fiscally re
sponsible, they say, either by
increasing their patient care load or
obtaining more grants.
Physicians in some departments
say that their work does not lend it
self to profit-making. Many of the
patients treated in the department
of obstetrics and gynecology, for
example, are insured by MediCal.
Other departments, such as clinical
pharmachology, have fewer
patients because of the nature of
the field.
"The pressure on these depart
ments has increased since the Fac
ulty Practice Plan became well
organized in the last few years,"
Silverman said.
The increased emphasis on pa
tient care has also brought resent
ment by some faculty members of
the expectations placed upon them
by administrators.
"It [the mission of the medical
center] is supposed to be a triad —
research, patient care and teaching
— with fairly equal emphasis on all
three. At Stanford, to be promoted,
you have to do such a high quantity
and quality of research that it's al
most impossible" to fulfill one's re
sponsibilities, one tenure-track
faculty member said. He asked not
to be named.
"Because other duties leave in

sufficient time for research, I have
to make a decision," he said. "I can
work 80 hours a week — 40 hours
on the (hospital) wards and on
teaching interns, medical students
and residents and 40 hours on re
search — and have no personal life
— or cut back on my clinical time."
Such dilemnas have been ac
knowledged by medical center
leaders, including Medical School
Dean David Korn. In accepting the
task force report last month, Korn
spoke of the rapid disappearance of
the "triple-threat person," one who
excels at teaching, research and pa
tient care.
The task force recommended

that the medical school examine the
academic status of all Stanford full
time faculty physicians engaged
primarily in patient care and teach
ing.
"The pressure to do research
and the pressure to see more
patients comes from the Dean's Of
fice and the individual departments
because of the need for funds to pay
salaries," Silverman said. "The
counterbalance to the problem is (a)
promotion" process that gives
weight to clinical excellence rather
than the current one, in which the
key determinant is research
strength, he said.
At the same time, physicians and adminis
trators have been making other demands for
change on themselves and each other.
"If (administrators) want us to be super
men, at least they should give us the tools,
like secretarial support and other things that
people in private practice take for granted,
such as not having to go through layers of
committees to get things done," the tenure
track faculty member said.
While hospital administrators agree that
they need to abolish rigidities and respond
more quickly to opportunities and requests
for change, their goals also include tighter
controls of resources. Since 1982, the hospi
tal has been run "more like a company," said
David Sakai, hospital director of finance.
"We've become more like a market-run sys
tem," he said.
Hospital administrators submitted a plan to
the Hospital Board of Directors in September
of 1984 which includes both a "cost
containment" and a marketing component.
Implementation of the plan has brought about
many changes for staff and patients at the
medical center.
Stressing increased efficiency and in
creased effectiveness — "looking at inputs to
see if we could do with less expensive materi
als," the managers have been challenging fac
ulty and staff members to change the way

they practice medicine, Sakai said.
The hospital's base budget has been
reduced by $15 to $16 million since 1982, and
King projects an increased reduction by $15
to $20 million in the $200 million budget over
the next few years.
King said increased attention to cost has
resulted in the establishment of "better moni
toring systems" so the budget has become
"more finely tuned" to the hospital's needs.
The decline in census, for example, has been
accompanied by a consolidation of underpop
ulated units and the elimination of both
managerial and staff positions. Most of the
staff positions were nursing jobs, King said.
Steps have been taken to reduce the
"layers of supervision" as well and to make
"more effective use of personnel," King said.
Work and productivity standards have also
been established.
"It's an exciting period for hospital
managers," Sakai said.
One crucial challenge for managers is to
make these changes without straining rela
tions with physicians.
"There's bound to be a certain amount of
back and forth," said Britain. One
manager/physician disagreement took place
over a decision to close a floor of the Hoover
Pavilion where there are medical-surgical
beds and move the unit to another floor,
which "from the physicians' point of view was
very undesirable," Britain said. In that case,
"what physicians suggested carried the day."
For community physicians, the changing
dynamics of the hospital environment

"restrict our desire to use the resources (at
Stanford) because they're not under our
direct control," and often results in the es
tablishment of "parallel structures" for pro
viding services Britian said.
But Britain and physicians praise the work
of King and other managers to keep manage
ment responsive to the needs of physicians
and patients. Carlson added that "the new
emphasis on developing a primary patient
care base ... is going to require an in
creased amount of interaction between admi
nistrators and physicians"
Efforts to include staff members in the
decision-making process include the creation
of new committees on cost-containment that
include doctors, nurses and others involved
in direct patient care. Instead of having all
cost reductions mandated by administrators
or board committees as in the past, the hospi
tal opened an avenue for "sort of a bottom-up
type of management system, where you use
the people who are taking care of patients to
decide where the cuts can best be made," Sil
verman said.
Nurses have formed their own cost
reduction committees as well, as the need to
cut the costs of nursing care is more
profoundly felt. One nurse, who asked to
remain anonymous, said the trend in patient
census reduction throughout the Bay Area is
causing nurses at Stanford to fear that lay
offs may be imminent.
"The morale of the (nursing) staff has
really changed," she said. "People are
worried," and partially because they are not

able to work as many hours as they would
like, "people are more apathetic."
Community hospitals can now perform
more advanced services and tend increas
ingly to refer only the most extremely ill
patients to Stanford. The sickest patients are
also increasingly referred to Stanford as more
patients are cared for on a fixed rather than
fee-for-service basis. The hospitals lose
money on these patients.
As a result, there are more and more
chronically ill patients in Stanford's intensive
care units, patients who are "not sick enough
to die but not well enough to get better," and
this is "breeding an apathy" the nurse said.
Patient care doesn't suffer directly, but
that extra yard to make the patient more
comfortable just isn't done," she said.
Additional demands on nurses also affect
morale since they sometimes feel overbur
dened, she said. "I think we are going to see
a return to more activities performed by pro
fessional nurses, with possible cost savings
and better care," King said. He said the new
environment is putting a check on the
proliferation of specialty therapists and tech
nologists.
Fuchs has also warned that
physician/patient relations could be affected
by the increasing emphasis on cost
reduction, causing an erosion of patient trust
in doctors.
Undoubtedly, the changes now occurring
will continue to change Stanford's relations to
other hospitals and the nature of interaction
among players in the medical field.
