# Financing Crisis Transforms Medical Center
## FEATURES 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
This is the second in a two-part series on the
effects of changes in health care financing on
the Stanford Medical Center.
An "authentic crisis" in health care financ
ing has hit the academic medical centers, ac
cording to University President Donald Ken
nedy, and the resulting financial pressures
are transforming a variety of relationships at
Stanford.
One such relationship is that between
physicians and hospital managers. With finan
cial viability becoming a major concern at
hospitals and medical centers everywhere,
there has been what Stanford Economics
Prof. Victor Fuchs described in a 1982 article
for Health Affairs magazine as a "battle line
emerging between ... a fiercely indepen

dent profession and a management structure
that seeks to gain further control over what
doctors do."
At Stanford, a potentially adversarial rela
tionship between physicians and managers
has instead remained cooperative, according
to Fuchs, hospital managers and many
physicians. But they explain that the new en
vironment has altered the nature of the rela
tionship.
Faculty relations with community
physicians and with each other are also
changing, as are patients' relations with doc
tors and nurses.
The "crisis" stems from nationwide efforts
to gain control over skyrocketing health care
costs, which have risen from $52 to nearly
$400 billion since 1950 an J nave grown in
their percentage of the gross national product
from 4.4 to 10 percent.
As a result, there have been dramatic

changes in the ways that both public and
private sectors reimburse hospitals and
physicians.
"The threat that the university medical
centers face is from a set of policies that favor
cost competition for the routine stuff and then
expect the university hospitals to take on the
load of managing the severe illnesses, many
of them in charity patients, without adequate
reimbursement," Kennedy said, "and that is
a financial formula to kill the university medi
cal centers."
The result has been an increasingly com
petitive health care environmen but one in
which academic medical centei are disad
vantaged "because of the severity of illness in
their patient mix and because of their respon
sioiiiiies to giauuate medical education,"
Kennedy said.
As the environment changes, so does the
evolving love-hate relationship between Stan

ford faculty and community physicians.
Stanford has an unusual relationship with
community physicians because it has a con
tract with the city of Palo Alto that requires
that local physicians be granted medical
privileges at Stanford Hospital. As a result,
780 of the 1,147 active physicians on the
hospital's staff are community physicians.
"The community physicians in our geogra
phic area as a rule are excellent and our inter
action with them is excellent," said oncologist
Robert Carlson, an assistant professor at the
medical school.
But the relationship has been characterized
as one of "acidity" by Hospital President
Sheldon King.
A prime source of contention between
some of the members of the two groups has
been the issue of access to specialized labora-
