# Southern Yemen Rebel Forces Reported To Be Near Victory

DJIBOUTI â€” Rebel forces, bat
tling from house to house, have
captured Aden's foreign embassy
quarter and trapped South Yemen
head of state Ali Nasser Hasani's
beleaguered troops in the capital's
old section, according to reports
emerging from Aden yesterday.
The fierce fighting, which is said
to have devastated Aden and
claimed as many as 12,000 lives, "is
now all but over," said Cmdr. Rich
ard Bridges, captain of the HMS
Jupiter, one of the British vessels
evacuating foreigners from the em
battled capital.
Bridges, speaking to reporters
when the Jupiter arrived in Djibouti
early yesterday, said that fighting in
Khormaksar, Aden's northeastern
embassy quarter, had tapered off
Wednesday. He said that clashes
continued "sporadically" in only the
old, southernmost quarter of the
city known as the Crater, where
the last Hasani loyalists were hold
ing out.
Bridges' account, along with
reports from refugees arriving in
Djibouti later in the day, appeared
to indicate that the rebels have all

but crushed Hasani's forces after 11
days of civil war.
However, the rebels were them
selves said to be divided between
forces loyal to former head of state
Abdul-Fattah Ismail and Deputy
Prime Minister Ali Ahmed Antar. It
was not clear which faction had or
would come out on top, and
diplomats in Djibouti, 200 miles
from Aden across the Red Sea,
predicted that the fighting may

resume between the rebel factions
once Hasani's forces have been
eliminated from their last stron
ghold in the Crater district.
Officials here said about 2,500
foreigners were plucked from two
coastal evacuation sites Wednesday
night and yesterday morning. They
included more than 1.000 Soviets,
part of the substantial Soviet pres
ence in South Yemen, the only
Marxist state in the Middle East.
