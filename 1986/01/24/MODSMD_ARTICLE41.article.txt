## 
### 
WASHINGTON —
Philippine President Fer
dinand Marcos has claimed for
decades that he led a band of
anti-Japanese guerrillas
during World War 11, but the
U.S. Army rejected his claim
right after the war, according
to documents in U.S. ar
chives.
Documents in the archives
suggest that Marcos actually
worked on behalf of Philippine
politicians who collaborated
with the Japanese occupation
of the islands from 1942 to
1944.
The documents on file in
this country and abroad —
some written by Marcos him
self during the war — suggest
that Marcos' principal ob
jective during the years of the
Japanese occupation of the
Philippines was to promote
the cause of Jose Laurel, who
served as president of the
Japanese-sponsored Republic
of the Philippines from Octo
ber 1943 until the end of the
war.
