Senate Warns Reagan
WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans
delivered a blunt warning to President Reagan
yesterday that he "should not wait until the
11th hour" to accept a compromise deficit
reduction package, possibly including tax in
creases, according to Administration and con
gressional sources.
Separately, some Senate Republicans
leaders said that Social Security, which is ex
empt from automatic spending cuts under the
new balanced-budget law, still should be
viewed as a future target in the search for
ways to reduce the deficit.
Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-
Kan.) said "one of the mistakes we made" last
year was to exempt Social Security cost-of
living adjustments from the new balanced
budget law, but he said it is "too early to tell" if
Congress will turn to Social Security for deficit
savings.
Asbestos Ban Sought
WASHINGTON — The Environmental
Protection Agency launched an effort yester
day to halt all uses of asbestos in the United
States within 10 years, starting with a ban on
asbestos-permeated cement pipes, fittings,
floor and roofing material and heat-resistan*

clothing made of the cancer-causing sub
stance.
"I believe there can be no debate about the
health risks of asbestos," EPA Administrator
Lee Thomas said. "This proposal starts us
down the path that will eventually rid asbestos
from our environment."
The proposal, being prepared at the agency
for more than six years, signals the end for as
bestos, which has been used widely for more
than a century as an insulator and to
strengthen construction materials.
The move also climaxes one of the most bit
ter regulatory battles of the Reagan Adminis
tration. The decade-long phaseout outlined
yesterday is virtually identical to an EPA pro
posal scuttled 18 months ago by Administra
tion regulatory overseers as unwarranted and
overly expensive.
Airline Mega-Merger
WASHINGTON — Northwest Orient
Airlines yesterday announced the biggest
merger in U.S. civil aviation history — an $884
million deal to acquire Republic Airlines.
If the transaction goes through, it will create
the nation's third largest airline — one fully ca
pable of battling United and American airlines,
currently first and second in the industry.
The merger of the two Minneapolis-St.

Paul-based airlines must be approved by the
U.S. Department of Transportation, which
rules on such matters since the death of the
Civil Aeronautics Board a year ago, the final
phase of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978.
Court Convicts Spy
WASHINGTON — A messenger for a
transcribing company pleaded guilty yesterday
to a charge of delivering national defense docu
ments to a person not entitled to receive
them, as prosecutors said they could have
proved he tried to sell the Soviet Union top
secret congressional testimony on U.S. mili
tary capabilities.
The messenger, Randy Jeffries, 26, could
be sentenced to 10 years in prison under the
plea agreement, which dropped a more serious
espionage charge that carried a sentence of life
imprisonment.
Stocks Rise Slightly
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
rose 8.95 to 1,511.24.
Big Board volume totaled 130.31 million
shares, against 131.18 million in the previous
session.
The NYSE's composite index rose 0.39 to
118.14.
