PASADENA — Voyager 2 has discovered
Uranus emits weak radio signals, suggesting it
has a magnetic field that could reveal the
length of a day on the planet and whether it has
a molten rocky core or liquid oceans.
"If you want to know how long a day is on
Uranus, you have to measure the magnetic
field. It's the way we will know how rapidly the
planet is rotating," Ed Stone, Voyager project
scientist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said
yesterday.
In addition, "If you have a magnetic field,
you have to have an electrical current" to
create the field, Stone said.

That means Uranus must have flowing,
electrically conductive material in its interior,
which is hidden by the planet's thick atmos
phere, he said.
Voyager 2, which explored Jupiter in 1979
and Saturn in 1981, makes its closest approach
to Uranus and the planet's five major moons
today — the most distant objects ever visited
by a spacecraft from Earth.
The space probe already has discovered
nine new moons orbiting Uranus, raising the
total of known moons to 14, as well as clouds
and winds swirling around the solar system's
third-largest planet, the seventh from the sun.

Sanctuary Break-ins
SAN FRANCISCO — Two Berkeley
churches and a San Francisco office involved in
the movement to give sanctuary to Central
American refugees have reported break-ins,
and some activists suspect government in
volvement.
Rep. Don Edwards (D-Calif.) chairman of
the House Subcommittee on Civil and Consti
tutional Rights, said he has received as
surances from the FBI and the federal Im
migration and Naturalization Service that their
agents aren't involved in the burglaries.
