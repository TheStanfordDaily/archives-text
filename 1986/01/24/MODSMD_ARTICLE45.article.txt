# A 						Letter from the Editor
## 
### 
The magazine you hold in your hands is
biased.
So too, however, is virtually every book you
might ever read. In my home state, for exam
ple, the telephone directory produced by the
local phone company places the listings of gov
ernment agencies on a series of blue pages,
ostensibly attempting to be helpful to the con
sumer but simultaneously displaying a subtle
bias.
As an editor, one must contend with both
limited space (all editors must choose which
articles to run and which not to) and the non
objectivity of language (most every English
word is awash in connotations).
These limitations introduce a bias, often
slight, into each publication, however well
written.
I have found only one exit from the above
limitations, and it is admittedly an imperfect
one.
Let me outline the bias which underlied my
selection and editing of articles; and, perhaps
when considered within the context of this

bias, the magazine stands on a more objective
footing.
There is something, I believe, to be said for
the interchange of ideas in a rational forum,
and such a forum serves as the best way to ef
fect change.
In all fairness, when such a forum is of lim
ited space, ideas must be judged on their ra
tional substantiation and originality.
We have tried to cover the entire spectrum
of opinion, from the religious conservative to
the gay activist, while bearing in mind that
blind assertion or needless repitition are both
approaches more suited for the political rally
than the college media.
That, in brief, is my bias. And it is a bias
which has inevitably shaped this magazine.
At left, the Rev. Sandmire, an episcopal
priest, blesses motorbikes at the annual chris
tening at The Eagle, a San Francisco gay bar.
Sandmire of course has never read what I
am writing in this letter of introduction, but I
would contend that he most probably already
understands what I am saying.
