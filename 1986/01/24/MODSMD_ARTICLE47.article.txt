another student won the English Department's poetry
prize in 1931 and was later printed in a fine-press
edition by the Stanford University Press.

The dance is done,
and our pulsating selves
have taken exhaustion
and laid it on the grass —
elbows digging into earth
and toes reaching toward heaven —
and having known
the very edges of each other,
we stare our different ways.
In a little while
this awkwardness will pass

Stanford opened its academic
doors in 1891, as the first
class, co-educational from the
outset, entered the University.
The early records of
homosexuality at Stanford are
scarce, but several of a rather
anecdotal nature offer a glimpse of
gay and lesbian life in the the early
years of the University.

ana we shall lift and smile —
I to go down
toward the first lights of town,
and you to disappear
where the woods turn against
the sun's intimate rays.
Only ... we shall leave
behind us here
the impress of our bodies
upon these grasses
which will lie,
crushed and still,
until tomorrow's sun.
And when another day
we dance, and having done,
fling ourselves
here in the late sun,

From 1911 to 1912, Alberta
Lucille Hart attended class at Stan
ford and lived in Roble Hall. She
was soon joined by her lover from
Albany College in Oregon, a woman
known only as "E.C."
Hart returned in 1916 for the
summer session at the Stanford
Medical School. During her stay,
Hart took to wearing masculine
attire at campus costume parties,
and she later became a "passing
woman" under the name "Dr. Alan
L. Hart."
In 1936, having established a
career as a radiologist and author in
New Mexico, Hart published "The
Undaunted," (New York: Norton),
one of the earlier American novels
to portray a gay male character
sympathetically.
Noting that "the subject of
homosexuality is one of vast impor
tance," Dr. Josephine Jackson of
Pasadena remarked in 1919 in the
"Proceedings of the International
Conference of Women Physicians":
"I have an adopted daughter. She
has been mine since she was eight
years old. There has been no man,
no boy in the household. This
daughter of mine since she was 15,
16, 17 began to get crushes on girls
her own age, and while she was at
Stanford, she had a terrible crush
on a girl of her own age. . . .
"She was not abnormal, but
simply passing through that phase
of homosexuality, and I said just
that to her. She went horseback
riding with a young girl chum the
day a lieutenant in the Army came
100 miles to see her, left him
waiting while she went riding with a
girl college chum, which was an aw
ful mistake."

The identity of Jackson's
daughter has not been established
definitively, but the most likely can
didate is Marie Herbert Jackson of
Los Angeles, enrolled as a history
undergraduate at Stanford from
1909 to 1911.
As the second decade of the cen
tury began, Stanford Education and
Psychology Prof. Lewis M. Terman
undertook a long-term psychologi
cal study of 1,000 mentally-gifted
children, including periodic in-depth
life histories with profiles of sexual
experience.
In 1936, Terman published "Sex
and Personality: Studies in Mascu
linity and Femininity" (New York:
McGraw-Hill), with co-author Cath
erine Cox Miles. The volume in
cludes numerous studies of
"inversion." Pioneering British
sexologist Havelock Ellis reviewed

the book favorably.
Due to this and other publica
tions, Terman received letters
from a number of homosexual
readers seeking advice, and some
wanted a possible "cure."
One correspondent wrote in
1937 of a doctor in Los Angeles
who claimed to determine
homosexuality by means of a urine
test.
In a 1952 letter concerning the
eventual disposition of his profes
sional papers, Terman mentioned
his concern about the confidentiality
of the research files which the
"Stanford Study of Gifted Children"
had produced.
"Apart from many test scores on
various tests . . . there are ex
tremely confidential records on
such things as mental breakdowns,
suicides (attempted or actual),
homosexuality, marital infidelity,
sexual impotency, marital malad
justments of every kind and a few
cases of delinquency," Terman
wrote.
"All of this is scattered through
the records of thousands of per
sonal interviews made by the field
assistants, and through many
hundreds of memoranda I have re
corded after my own private con
ferences with subjects who brought
their problems to me as a sort of
father confessor," he explained.
In 1931, Stanford junior Smith
Dawless published a poem describ
ing in veiled terms his relationship
with Harry Hay, a freshmen. Daw
less' poem, "Discovery," was
awarded the annual English Depart
ment poetry prize and later
reprinted in a fine-press edition,
"Discovery and Other Poems."

(Stanford: The Stanford University
Press, 1931)
Later in 1931, James Broughton
entered Stanford as a freshman.
Broughton soon took up an affair
with Hay and involved himself with
Hay's network of homosexual
friends.
After becoming editor of the
"Yearbook in Stanford Writing,"
then president of the sponsoring
student group, the English Club,
from 1933 to 1934, Broughton
began to attend Stanford irregularly
until the 1936 summer session.
He left Stanford some 40 units
short of graduation, going on to
make his name as a gay poet and
avant-garde director.
His film "The Pleasure Garden"
received a special award at the
1954 Cannes Festival. Hay and his
lover, John Burnside, would later

— almost — as soft
as they are now;
but when we are through
with resting exhaustion,
they will lie silently
until the next night's moon.
And some remote afternoon
when, spent with dance, we lay
ourselves upon this place,
there will be unfriendly
bare earth where now we lie:
and I will look up
and find you suddenly
grown strange and bare.
. . . and that day
exhaustion will not pass.
— Smith Dawless

make a cameo appearance in
Broughton's 1983 film "Devotions."
In 1935, during her only lecture
tour of Ameri a, well-known les
bian writer Gertrude Stein gave a
sold-out talk on "The Relation of
English Literature to the American
Language."
The next morning, The Daily re
ported a series of remarks with an
ambiguity that might well have had
special meaning for homosexual
members of the audience at the
lecture: "She (Stein) said that ar
tists were the only ones with com
mon sense because they were the
only ones that realized that all
things were natural things. Most
people think most things are un
natural things, and they are
shocked when they learn that all
things are natural now."
Stanford's gay and lesbian popu
lation seemed to be markedly suc
cessful in the literary world during
the 19505.
1953 brought Jane Rule to Stan
ford for one quarter as a graduate
student in English. Rule went on to
make her name as a novelist,
publishing such works as "Desert of
the Heart" (1964) and "Lesbian
Images" (1975).
From 1956 to 1958, Thompson
William (Thom) Gunn attended
Stanford as an undergraduate.
Gunn, an openly gay poet, gained
recognition from the non-gay criti
cal establishment as a major English
author for numerous works, one of
which, "Moly" (1957), was pub
lished during his undergraduate
years at the University.
In 1959, as a subject in a psycho
logical experiment at Stanford
secretly sponsored by the Central

Intelligence Agency, openly-gay
Beat poet Alan Ginsberg took LSD
for the first time.
As the writers and poets stepped
up their writing, the police stepped
up their raids against gay activity,
especially in public bathrooms.
In 1956, Palo Alto police raided a
popular local tearoom in the South
ern Pacific train station at Alma and
University. Twenty-three men
were arrested, including seven
Stanford students.
These students were placed on
"medical leave of absence pending
satisfactory evidence of rehabilita
tion."
Police action against bathroom
activity again involved Stanford in
1959, when a second raid on the
Palo Alto train depot netted 24
suspects, including a Stanford
graduate student.
Investigators used a hidden
camera to film activities in the
stalls. One suspect was also
charged with petty theft after police
oberved him entering a pay toliet
without depositing the required 10
cents.
1965 brought the formation of
the earliest known student organi
zation to advocate civil rights for
gay men and lesbians.
In December, the Stanford
Sexual Rights Forum registered as
a recognized Voluntary Student Or
ganization (VSO). Its program in
cluded the repeal of "all laws
punishing co-habitation, sodomy,
homosexuality ..." and an end to
job discrimination against
homosexuals.
In practice, the group primarily
concentrated its efforts on reform
of University regulations restricting
interactions between men and
women in on-campus residence
halls and on lobbying for free access
to contraceptives at the Student
Health Service.
In January 1968, the Student
Homophile League (SHL), first or
ganized at Columbia University in
New York, established a chapter at
Stanford. The Stanford Chapter of
the SHL was only the second
homosexual student group in the
nation.
The Stanford chapter of the SHL
disbanded in the spring of the year
of its founding.
In November of 1970, the Gay
Students' Union (GSU), a group in
volving men and women, students
and non-students from the Stanford
area, began to meet off campus in
private homes.
The founding of the GSU marked
the beginning of the continuous or
ganizational history of gay men and
lesbians at Stanford.
In January 1971, Maud Haimson
and Fred Oakman, founding mem
bers of the GSU, "come out" about
their homosexuality in The Daily, in
announcing a GSU-sponsored se
ries of dormitory discussions on
homosexuality; they are the first
Stanford students to come out in
the press using their full names.
"What is the problem with being
gay? Are homosexual relationships
inherently unsatisfactory, or does
the difficulty lie in the way such
relationships are fitted in with other
social patterns? As one who has
loved another man, I know the po
tential for beauty, satisfaction and
true human sharing which lies
before the homosexual. But before
him, as before the heterosexual
male, lie any number of personal
pitfalls and occasions of agonizing
emotional pain. Everyone in coming
to terms with their sexuality must

suffer periods of doubt, frustration
and loneliness; and at times must
fail in attempting to establish closer
ties with other persons," wrote
Maud Haimson in introducing the
first openly homosexual signed let
ter to appear in The Daily.
An FBI informant at Stanford for
warded a clipping of a second story
in The Daily, "Gay Students Drop
Straight Roles" Uan. 31) to the
FBl's San Francisco Field Office,
where Oakman and Haimson's
names were tagged for indexing
and possible establishment of indi
vidual intelligence files.
Ten years later, GLAS, the or
ganization which succeeded the
GSU at Stanford, would use the
Freedom of Information Act to ob
tain this and other documents which
reveal FBI surveillance and
intelligence-gathering involving the
Stanford GSU, as well as gay stu
dent organizations at Cal State
Hayward, UC-Berkeley and the
College of San Mateo in 1970-75.
In May 1971, an off-campus "Gay
Women's Meeting," apparently in
association with the GSU, was an
nounced in The Daily — the first
known organizational meeting ex
clusively for lesbians in the Stanford
community.
In 1972, KZSU, the campus radio
station, began to air a weekly gay
program, "Out of the Closets."
Later in the same year, the
members of the GSU received
recognition as a registered VSO,
changing their name in 1972 to the
Gay People's Union (GPU) and in
1973 acquiring from the Dean of
Student Affairs Office desk space in
the loft of the Women's Clubhouse.
In the winter quarter of 1973,
community activist Joel Roberts
taught SCIRE 199, "The Myth,
Culture and History of the
Homosexual," the first lesbian and
gay studies course to be offered at
Stanford.
In November 1973, the GPU
moved to the second floor of the
Old Firehouse, where it occupied
an office and a large, separate
meeting room.
Upset by the GPU's policy of
opening membership and Steering
Committee positions to non
students (both activities are specifi
cally forbidden by University
policy), Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons asked Assoc. Dean
Dan Williams in a confidential memo
to consider withdrawal of the
GPU's VSO status. Lyons added
that "it is reasonable for us to ques
tion whether Stanford should be the
base for organizing and providing
services for the entire peninsula
gay community."
The GPU, however, was able to
strike an agreement with Williams
by which an amended constitution
would allow non-student participa
tion while bringing the GPU into
compliance with VSO regulations.
1974 brought further develop
ment in women's issues on the
Stanford campus. The Center for
Research on Women (CROW) was
begun at Stanford as an organiza
tion to further feminist scholarship
at the University. Lesbian studies
were of principal concern to CROW
from the outset.
Lesbian issues were also in the
forefront at the GPU, as some 50
women, mostly non-students, or
ganized a distinct Women's Col
lective.
In this developmental year of
1974, the GPU was able to broaden
