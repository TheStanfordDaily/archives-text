The dance is done,
and our pulsating selves
have taken exhaustion
and laid it on the grass —
elbows digging into earth
and toes reaching toward heaven —
and having known
the very edges of each other,
we stare our different ways.
In a little while
this awkwardness will pass

Stanford opened its academic
doors in 1891, as the first
class, co-educational from the
outset, entered the University.
The early records of
homosexuality at Stanford are
scarce, but several of a rather
anecdotal nature offer a glimpse of
gay and lesbian life in the the early
years of the University.

From 1911 to 1912, Alberta
Lucille Hart attended class at Stan
ford and lived in Roble Hall. She
was soon joined by her lover from
Albany College in Oregon, a woman
known only as "E.C."
Hart returned in 1916 for the
summer session at the Stanford
Medical School. During her stay,
Hart took to wearing masculine
attire at campus costume parties,
and she later became a "passing
woman" under the name "Dr. Alan
L. Hart."
In 1936, having established a
career as a radiologist and author in
New Mexico, Hart published "The
Undaunted," (New York: Norton),
one of the earlier American novels
to portray a gay male character
sympathetically.
Noting that "the subject of
homosexuality is one of vast impor
tance," Dr. Josephine Jackson of
Pasadena remarked in 1919 in the
"Proceedings of the International
Conference of Women Physicians":
"I have an adopted daughter. She
has been mine since she was eight
years old. There has been no man,
no boy in the household. This
daughter of mine since she was 15,
16, 17 began to get crushes on girls
her own age, and while she was at
Stanford, she had a terrible crush
on a girl of her own age. . . .
"She was not abnormal, but
simply passing through that phase
of homosexuality, and I said just
that to her. She went horseback
riding with a young girl chum the
day a lieutenant in the Army came
100 miles to see her, left him
waiting while she went riding with a
girl college chum, which was an aw
ful mistake."

The identity of Jackson's
daughter has not been established
definitively, but the most likely can
didate is Marie Herbert Jackson of
Los Angeles, enrolled as a history
undergraduate at Stanford from
1909 to 1911.
As the second decade of the cen
tury began, Stanford Education and
Psychology Prof. Lewis M. Terman
undertook a long-term psychologi
cal study of 1,000 mentally-gifted
children, including periodic in-depth
life histories with profiles of sexual
experience.
In 1936, Terman published "Sex
and Personality: Studies in Mascu
linity and Femininity" (New York:
McGraw-Hill), with co-author Cath
erine Cox Miles. The volume in
cludes numerous studies of
"inversion." Pioneering British
sexologist Havelock Ellis reviewed

the book favorably.
Due to this and other publica
tions, Terman received letters
from a number of homosexual
readers seeking advice, and some
wanted a possible "cure."
One correspondent wrote in
1937 of a doctor in Los Angeles
who claimed to determine
homosexuality by means of a urine
test.
In a 1952 letter concerning the
eventual disposition of his profes
sional papers, Terman mentioned
his concern about the confidentiality
of the research files which the
"Stanford Study of Gifted Children"
had produced.
"Apart from many test scores on
various tests . . . there are ex
tremely confidential records on
such things as mental breakdowns,
suicides (attempted or actual),
homosexuality, marital infidelity,
sexual impotency, marital malad
justments of every kind and a few
cases of delinquency," Terman
wrote.
"All of this is scattered through
the records of thousands of per
sonal interviews made by the field
assistants, and through many
hundreds of memoranda I have re
corded after my own private con
ferences with subjects who brought
their problems to me as a sort of
father confessor," he explained.
In 1931, Stanford junior Smith
Dawless published a poem describ
ing in veiled terms his relationship
with Harry Hay, a freshmen. Daw
less' poem, "Discovery," was
awarded the annual English Depart
ment poetry prize and later
reprinted in a fine-press edition,
"Discovery and Other Poems."

(Stanford: The Stanford University
Press, 1931)
Later in 1931, James Broughton
entered Stanford as a freshman.
Broughton soon took up an affair
with Hay and involved himself with
Hay's network of homosexual
friends.
After becoming editor of the
"Yearbook in Stanford Writing,"
then president of the sponsoring
student group, the English Club,
from 1933 to 1934, Broughton
began to attend Stanford irregularly
until the 1936 summer session.
He left Stanford some 40 units
short of graduation, going on to
make his name as a gay poet and
avant-garde director.
His film "The Pleasure Garden"
received a special award at the
1954 Cannes Festival. Hay and his
lover, John Burnside, would later

— almost — as soft
as they are now;
but when we are through
with resting exhaustion,
they will lie silently
until the next night's moon.
And some remote afternoon
when, spent with dance, we lay
ourselves upon this place,
there will be unfriendly
bare earth where now we lie:
and I will look up
and find you suddenly
grown strange and bare.
. . . and that day
exhaustion will not pass.

make a cameo appearance in
Broughton's 1983 film "Devotions."
In 1935, during her only lecture
tour of Ameri a, well-known les
bian writer Gertrude Stein gave a
sold-out talk on "The Relation of
English Literature to the American
Language."
The next morning, The Daily re
ported a series of remarks with an
ambiguity that might well have had
special meaning for homosexual
members of the audience at the
lecture: "She (Stein) said that ar
tists were the only ones with com
mon sense because they were the
only ones that realized that all
things were natural things. Most
people think most things are un
natural things, and they are
shocked when they learn that all
things are natural now."
Stanford's gay and lesbian popu
lation seemed to be markedly suc
cessful in the literary world during
the 19505.
1953 brought Jane Rule to Stan
ford for one quarter as a graduate
student in English. Rule went on to
make her name as a novelist,
publishing such works as "Desert of
the Heart" (1964) and "Lesbian
Images" (1975).
From 1956 to 1958, Thompson
William (Thom) Gunn attended
Stanford as an undergraduate.
Gunn, an openly gay poet, gained
recognition from the non-gay criti
cal establishment as a major English
author for numerous works, one of
which, "Moly" (1957), was pub
lished during his undergraduate
years at the University.
In 1959, as a subject in a psycho
logical experiment at Stanford
secretly sponsored by the Central

Intelligence Agency, openly-gay
Beat poet Alan Ginsberg took LSD
for the first time.
As the writers and poets stepped
up their writing, the police stepped
up their raids against gay activity,
especially in public bathrooms.
In 1956, Palo Alto police raided a
popular local tearoom in the South
ern Pacific train station at Alma and
University. Twenty-three men
were arrested, including seven
Stanford students.
These students were placed on
"medical leave of absence pending
satisfactory evidence of rehabilita
tion."
Police action against bathroom
activity again involved Stanford in
1959, when a second raid on the
Palo Alto train depot netted 24
suspects, including a Stanford
graduate student.
Investigators used a hidden
camera to film activities in the
stalls. One suspect was also
charged with petty theft after police
oberved him entering a pay toliet
without depositing the required 10
cents.
1965 brought the formation of
the earliest known student organi
zation to advocate civil rights for
gay men and lesbians.
In December, the Stanford
Sexual Rights Forum registered as
a recognized Voluntary Student Or
ganization (VSO). Its program in
cluded the repeal of "all laws
punishing co-habitation, sodomy,
homosexuality ..." and an end to
job discrimination against
homosexuals.
In practice, the group primarily
concentrated its efforts on reform
of University regulations restricting
interactions between men and
women in on-campus residence
halls and on lobbying for free access
to contraceptives at the Student
Health Service.
In January 1968, the Student
Homophile League (SHL), first or
ganized at Columbia University in
New York, established a chapter at
Stanford. The Stanford Chapter of
the SHL was only the second
homosexual student group in the
nation.
The Stanford chapter of the SHL
disbanded in the spring of the year
of its founding.
In November of 1970, the Gay
Students' Union (GSU), a group in
volving men and women, students
and non-students from the Stanford
area, began to meet off campus in
private homes.
The founding of the GSU marked
the beginning of the continuous or
ganizational history of gay men and
lesbians at Stanford.
In January 1971, Maud Haimson
and Fred Oakman, founding mem
bers of the GSU, "come out" about
their homosexuality in The Daily, in
announcing a GSU-sponsored se
ries of dormitory discussions on
homosexuality; they are the first
Stanford students to come out in
the press using their full names.
"What is the problem with being
gay? Are homosexual relationships
inherently unsatisfactory, or does
the difficulty lie in the way such
relationships are fitted in with other
social patterns? As one who has
loved another man, I know the po
tential for beauty, satisfaction and
true human sharing which lies
before the homosexual. But before
him, as before the heterosexual
male, lie any number of personal
pitfalls and occasions of agonizing
emotional pain. Everyone in coming
to terms with their sexuality must

suffer periods of doubt, frustration
and loneliness; and at times must
fail in attempting to establish closer
ties with other persons," wrote
Maud Haimson in introducing the
first openly homosexual signed let
ter to appear in The Daily.
An FBI informant at Stanford for
warded a clipping of a second story
in The Daily, "Gay Students Drop
Straight Roles" Uan. 31) to the
FBl's San Francisco Field Office,
where Oakman and Haimson's
names were tagged for indexing
and possible establishment of indi
vidual intelligence files.
Ten years later, GLAS, the or
ganization which succeeded the
GSU at Stanford, would use the
Freedom of Information Act to ob
tain this and other documents which
reveal FBI surveillance and
intelligence-gathering involving the
Stanford GSU, as well as gay stu
dent organizations at Cal State
Hayward, UC-Berkeley and the
College of San Mateo in 1970-75.
In May 1971, an off-campus "Gay
Women's Meeting," apparently in
association with the GSU, was an
nounced in The Daily — the first
known organizational meeting ex
clusively for lesbians in the Stanford
community.
In 1972, KZSU, the campus radio
station, began to air a weekly gay
program, "Out of the Closets."
Later in the same year, the
members of the GSU received
recognition as a registered VSO,
changing their name in 1972 to the
Gay People's Union (GPU) and in
1973 acquiring from the Dean of
Student Affairs Office desk space in
the loft of the Women's Clubhouse.
In the winter quarter of 1973,
community activist Joel Roberts
taught SCIRE 199, "The Myth,
Culture and History of the
Homosexual," the first lesbian and
gay studies course to be offered at
Stanford.
In November 1973, the GPU
moved to the second floor of the
Old Firehouse, where it occupied
an office and a large, separate
meeting room.
Upset by the GPU's policy of
opening membership and Steering
Committee positions to non
students (both activities are specifi
cally forbidden by University
policy), Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons asked Assoc. Dean
Dan Williams in a confidential memo
to consider withdrawal of the
GPU's VSO status. Lyons added
that "it is reasonable for us to ques
tion whether Stanford should be the
base for organizing and providing
services for the entire peninsula
gay community."
The GPU, however, was able to
strike an agreement with Williams
by which an amended constitution
would allow non-student participa
tion while bringing the GPU into
compliance with VSO regulations.
1974 brought further develop
ment in women's issues on the
Stanford campus. The Center for
Research on Women (CROW) was
begun at Stanford as an organiza
tion to further feminist scholarship
at the University. Lesbian studies
were of principal concern to CROW
from the outset.
Lesbian issues were also in the
forefront at the GPU, as some 50
women, mostly non-students, or
ganized a distinct Women's Col
lective.
In this developmental year of
1974, the GPU was able to broaden
its concerns not only through the
inclusion of lesbian issues but by a
grant from the state of California.
With assistance from the
Whitman-Radclyffe Foundation of
San Francisco, the GPU received a
three-year, $90,000 grant from the
California State Department of
Health to create the Gay Commu
nity of Concern (GCC), a pilot pro
gram providing liaison between the
mid-peninsula gay community and
social service/mental health
agencies and professionals.
The organization worked out of
the Old Firehouse and shared its
paid staffers with the GPU.
As a year of progress, 1974 also
brought an air of festivity to the gay
community at Stanford, as the first
annual gay and lesbian awareness
celebration at Stanford took place in
June with funding supplied in part
by the U.S. Department of Educa
tion.
In addition to its foimal title of
Stanford Gay Pride Week, the
celebration carried the title, "Spirit
of '76: A Gay Civil Rights Event."
Many participants dressed as
Revolutionary War figures or sym
bols to promote the theme of gay
rights by 1976.
Stanford administrators received
a number of angry letters following
the event from alumni and mem
bers of the public protesting the use
of University facilities for such
events.
Whereas 1974 brought many
changes within the gay and lesbian
community, 1975 and the years fol
lowing saw this community turning
outward in attempts to effect
change.
The GPU in that year ap
proached Ken Kaufman, assistant
director of Financial Aids, about the
possibility of organizing a scholar
ship fund for homosexual students.
Kaufman agreed that his office
could administer such a fund.
From 1975 to 1976, graduate
student Richard Thomas and other
members of the GPU conducted a
campaign to have the Stanford
Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC) closed to
employers who discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation. As of
this date, only the Stanford Law
School specifically prohibits such
recruiting, although most other
centers require that recruiters
state their bias up front in hiring.
In 1976, at the urging of the
GPU, the Stanford libraries
adopted a new policy of placing ma
terials on homosexuality in open
stacks. Works on the subjects had
previously been placed in locked
stacks, where they could be con
sulted only upon special application
at the loan desk.
Also in 1976, a negative reply
came from Lyons to the GPU's re
quest of establishing a scholarship
and loan fund for homosexual stu
dents. Lyons stated that it would be
inappropriate for the University "to
give or loan funds to a student
simply because he or she is or is not
heterosexual."
Members of the GPU argued that
the University does accept and
administer ROTC scholarships,
which are made available exclu
sively to heterosexual students.
In May of 1978, the Office of Stu
dent Activities (OSA) announced

plans to divide the GPU office and
meeting room at the Old Firehouse
among several unrelated groups,
but GPU protests and meetings
with the affected groups led OSA to
abandon the plan.
The following times brought a vi
olent attack on the gay community
in the area, as former San Fran
cisco Supervisor Dan White assas
sinated San Francisco Mayor
George Moscone and openly gay
Supervisor Harvey Milk on Nov.
27, 1978.
The attack elicited a similarly vi
olent response as 5,000 gay men
and lesbians — responding to the
announcement that White had been
convicted of manslughter instead of
first-degree murder — besieged
City Hall, shattering windows and
torching police cars for nearly four
hours.
Shortly following the "White
Night" riot, dozens of uniformed
San Francisco police officers des
cended on Castro Street, raiding
the Elephant Walk bar and beating
its patrons.
Jack Winkler, professor of clas
sics at Stanford, was among the vic
tims at the Elephant Walk bar.
The San Francisco Police Com
mission later held that none of the
officers in the raid could be dis
ciplined due to inadequate identifi
cation.
In April 1980, a one-week under
cover operation by Stanford police
led to the 10 arrests for tearoom
activity in public restrooms in the
Cummings Art Building, Cubberley
Education Building and at Sunken
Diamond. Two Stanford students
were among those apprehended.
Members of the GPU and the
Gay Counseling Group decried the
arrests and subsequent press expo
sure of the suspects. A group of
gay Stanford faculty met with rep
resentatives of the Stanford police,
who agreed to seek the advice of
the gay community for other solu
tions should the problem reoccur.
Attention returned to establish
ment of non-discrimination in No
vember, 1980, policies as the city
of Palo Alto placed a referendum
outlawing discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation in em
ployment, housing and public ac
comodations on the ballot. Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy and
his wife Jeanne endorsed the mea
sure as private individuals, as did a
number of Stanford professors.
The measure, which would not
have affected the Stanford campus,
failed by a margin of nearly two-to
one, to the surprise of many.
In the ensuing two years,
graduate student Staurt Reges and
the GPU launched a second cam
paign to have the University adopt a
policy of non-discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation.
University officials maintained at
that time that Stanford does not
engage in discrimination on this
basis and such a policy is therefore
unnecessary.
1982, however, saw the adoption
by the Stanford Law School of a
non-discrimination policy on the
basis of sexual orientation.
May of the same year marked the
10th anniversary of the GPU, and
the change in name from the GPU
to the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford, and the beginning of an
era that is still too close to be
viewed from an honestly historical
perspective.

Commentary

The following is an essay prepared by Stanford Classics Prof. Jack
Winkler.

In the mid-19505, when tele
vision and I were young, a
weekly program called "I Led
Three Lives" gave me my first
model of a gay identity. Richard
Carlson, a B-actor whose most
famous role was the lead in
"Invasion of the Body
Snatchers," played the part of
Herbert Philbrick, an FBI double
agent who led one life as an ordi
nary, white, middle-class citizen,
another as a member of a com
munist cell, and a third as an FBI
agent. Each week he secretly
plotted to foment strikes or
overthrow the government and
even more secretly helped the
FBI to foil those villainous plans.

system, beaten and killed by
vigilante justice.
In retrospect I had in
numerable experiences that
should have told me I was . . .
what? Without the name I didn't
know, though gradually I learned
what not to say and do. A male
college friend once commented
on how when a man and woman
are walking toward you, you al
ways notice the woman. I can re
member thinking, "Uh-oh. That
is not true, and I'd better not
think about it." By assiduous for
getfulness I successfully
managed not to know, really not
to know that I was ....
There were many other
people waiting for that word to
be spoken. It happened in late
June, 1969. The Stonewall resis
tance against a routine police
harassment in Greenwich Village
was the event that spoke the
word. The resisters said "gay;"
and gay people were created;
and they were very good.
Hearing that word began my
second life — this time as a gay
activist, while I was a classics
professor at Yale. Those were
exciting times, whose story I
may tell elsewhere.
My third life is in this quite dif
ferent environment, the ambigu
ous tolerance of liberal Stanford.
There is an oppressive side to
this non-punitive but non
supportive tolerance that is also
hard to convey; it's like a velvet
claw that strokes you with its
soft part as long as you keep
quiet, but turns its pointed nails
to you as soon as you speak up.

To explain why this crude
Cold War propaganda, operating
on a sub-Rambo level of sub
tlety, could have been for me an
even somewhat positive model
for a gay identity, I need to
remind younger gay folks what
America was like in the post-war
repression. Lesbian and gay sub
cultures seem to have existed in
most societies that have left suf
ficient records of themselves for
us to know. Recently, social his
torians have been recovering
these in some abundance from
various parts of 19th and 20th
century America, and in particu
lar have seen a great prolifera
tion of same-sex love in the
same-sex institutions of World
War 11. Rosie the Riveter and
G.I. Joe were not dating each
other.
The re-disciplining of post-war
American society — which
meant putting women off the
payroll and keeping the male
work force relatively docile —
was achieved in part by inflating
public fears of an external enemy
(the country is still at war — a
Cold War) and internal enemies
— "deviants." These two ter
rors were often united in a single
image, that of the commie
queer. (Ridiculous in fact, since
the U.S. Communist Party
at that time was as homophobic
as any other group, and the fled
gling homophile associations
were politically rather conserva
tive.)
The principle witch-hunters of
the early '50s — Joe McCarthy,
Nixon, Hoover — set their
sights on both kinds of sub
versive, using the separate fears
to fuel each other. The fact that
at least two of these men and
Nixon's chief witness, Whittaker
Chambers, were homosexual
was no accident. The form being
given to gay identity in the '50s
was different from the mar
ginalization found most often
throughout history: Its charac
teristic was self-repression.
People who even suspected
that they might be gay locked
the closet door from the inside.
Following a certain kind of logic,
it does make sense that the most
serious practicing homophobes
were themselves homosexual.
In a reign of fear, it is the poten
tial victims who are most acutely
aware of "the issue" and may
prove their loyalty most dramati
cally by being Grand Inquisitors
in the cause of straight patrio
tism.
I think what reached deepest
into my personal reality was the
way in which Carlson's character
was allowed to be both sub
versive and patriotic at the same
time. He had two secret iden
tities, two visible allegiances,
one the wickedest imaginable
and the other its precise an
tidote. That meant that having a
secret inner self was frightening
and dangerous and yet neces
sary and even good; and in an in
choate way I felt that putting
those four qualities together was
telling the human truth as I lived
it.
The part of my '50s grade
school and high school experi
ence that is hardest to convey is
its daily amnesia, a sort of
knowing without knowing. My
fascination with "I Led Three
Lives" did not make me con
scious that I had a specific secret
or that it had a specific name. At
a fourth grade Valentine's Day
party during class time we all ex
changed valentines and I ad
dressed all 80 of mine to Bobby
Gioia. This was thought strange.
But still I didn't know that this
impulsive affection of an eight
year-old would have been thought
by many to constitute a guilty
identity and that adults of that
sort were routinely disowned,
fired, imprisoned and even
castrated by the public justice

Don't get me wrong, things
could be much worse. But there
is an element of terror even in a
reign of tolerance that has con
sistently refused to make non
discrimination against gays and
lesbians and official University
policy.
As long as the University
stays officially mute and blind,
regarding sexual orientation as a
wholly private matter, gay
people will have their lives con
structed in weirdly private ways.
The bathroom walls are eloquent
statements of how such love and
hate are privatized. "Make date"
and "Die faggot" are equally im
polite in our public discourse.
Both will flourish in that twilight
region as long as the University
refuses to declare that one of
those statements violates the
Fundamental Standard and the
other does not.
An earlier classicist, Friedrich
Nietzsche, wrote a book called
"Gay Knowledge." He didn't
quite mean by that what we do,
but there is a reality worthy to
be so named and honored.
Through the centuries lesbian
and gay energy and knowledge
and perspectives have added an
enormous amount to the life of
many societies, and they could
do so here. I would like this Uni
versity actively and vigorously to
promote a rainbow diversity of
multiple perspectives, with
lavendar well represented. When
that happens, I may be able to go
Richard Carlson one better and
move into a fourth life.
