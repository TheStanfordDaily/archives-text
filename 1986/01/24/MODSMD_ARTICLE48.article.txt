# Non- Discriminatory Policies ...
## at Stanford 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
Members of Stanford's gay and lesbian community
have once again begun efforts to broaden the Univer
sity's anti-discrimination statement, hoping that Stan
ford will join the ranks of other educational institutions
that include in their policies a vow not to discriminate
on the basis of sexual orientation.
Harvard, Amherst and Oberlin already have adopted
such policies.
In December, members of the Gay and Lesbian Alli
ance at Stanford (GLAS) met with University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy to discuss the status of the
campus gay and lesbian community and the possibility
of changing the University's anti-discrimination state
ment.

Stanford University currently operates
under what it calls a "Statement of Non
discriminatory Policy." This policy was
drafted and went into effect in the early
19705. The text of this policy follows:

Stanford University admits students of either
sex and any race, color or national origin to all the
rights, privileges, programs and activities gener
ally accorded or made available to students at the
University. It does not discriminate against stu-

The current University statement, as contained in
official publications such as Courses and Degrees and
the Information Bulletin, has been written to meet
standards established by the federal government for a
tax-exempt institution in Title IX of the 1972 Education
Amendments.
According to Stuart Reges, assistant chairman of the
Computer Science Dept. and a member of the GLAS
Steering Committee, University administrators have
resisted altering the current language despite the fact
that both the Faculty and Staff Academic Handbook and
the current United Stanford Workers contract explicitly
protect faculty, staff and workers from discrimination
on the basis of sexual preference.

"They think it is extremely important that the Uni
versity has these policies and procedures, but they
don't feel that way about students," Reges said.
Although "open-minded" on the question, Kennedy
said he does not currently favor altering the existing
policy to enumerate protection for other minorities
without a federal mandate.
"At the time this policy was established, the decision
was made that there was a need to refer only to (those)
items that one is required to under law," Kennedy
said. "I guess the feeling was people ought to trust that
you're not going to do 'bad things' and you don't have
to list the 'bad things' you don't do.
"The feeling was (that) if you start to make lists of
other 'bad things' which you do not do that aren't (in
policy) as a matter of legal requirement, you build
yourself the obligation to create a kind of Napoleonic
code of all the things you don't do," Kennedy said.
Although a new policy would contain certain specific
groups, the list would not be endless Reges said.
"We tried to make the suggestion to Kennedy that

dents on the basis of sex, race, color, handicap or
national and ethnic origin in the administration of
its educational policies, admissions policies, schol
arship and loan programs and athletic and other
University-administered programs.

we don't include everyone possible on the list," Reges
said, "but there are groups that are discriminated
against openly, and it should be clear that those groups
are not to be discriminated against."
The revision of the existing policy would not be lim
ited to including only sexual orientation as a non
discriminating factor, Reges said.
"I personally don't think it's reasonable that we
should ask the University to just add two words to the
policy," he said. "I think what we should ask the Uni
versity to do is to draft a comprehensive policy, and I
feel confident that if they draft a comprehensive policy
that it will include those two words.
"The thing we want to avoid is being a 'special inter-

est' group and asking for two words to be added to a
policy. The two words have stronger implications than
just protecting us (because) it would be a major devia
tion form policy and would open the door for everyone
else, exactly what Kennedy is worried about."
GLAS will also attempt to "teach" Kennedy about
the concerns of the gay and lesbian community, Reges
said. "I think he has a misconception about gay
people," he said. "He thinks being gay is something
private. I believe he thinks it's an embarrassing ques
tion to ask someone if they're gay, but we don't."
Although he originally supported the University's
current anti-discrimination policy, Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons said discussions with students and
administrators "have done a lot to convince me that we
have some real problems of behavior (and) overt
expressions of discrimination."
The change in the "national mood" over the last six
years, partly reflected in the federal government's lack
of zealousness in enforcing anti-discrimination
statutes, has allowed overt discrimination to be "more
acceptable," Lyons said.
"I think we (previously) could safely say that it was
accepted by students here as wrong to discriminate on
the basis of sexual orientation," he said. "Not that
there wasn't such discrimination, but the fact is that
what the 'right' behavior was seemed to be a com
monly understood principle in the University."
Instances of evangelical organizations offering to
"change" admitted homosexuals, allegations of frater
nities forcing out gay members and increasing public
fear of AIDS indicates that previous assumption "is
beginning to erode," Lyons said.
"I am very concerned about this (which) says to me
that this is going to be an important time to probably
take some institutional stands," he said.
Efforts by student groups to change the University
policy began in the mid- 19705. On May 25, 1976, stu
dents marched to the office of then University Presi
dent Richard Lyman to present petitions calling for a
comprehensive anti- disrimination statement by the
University.
The student-proposed "human rights policy" would
