Harvard University
Homosexuals comprise approximately 10 per
cent of the Harvard student population, accord
ing to Jim Sanks of the Harvard/Radcliffe Gay
and Lesbian Students Association. He described
the level of tolerance for homosexuals at Har
vard as "about average."
"Mostly we have trouble with people tearing
down our posters," he said. "We're lucky in that
the university itself is on our side. Last year they
passed a non-discrimination policy which in
cluded prohibition of discrimination based on
sexual preferences. So when there's intolerance
on the part of the students, we always have the
university behind us."
Brigham Young University
The Daily was unable to speak to any mem
bers of the homosexual students organization of
Brigham Young University because no such or
ganization exists. Because Brigham Young is run
by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints, or Mormons, no homosexuals are
allowed to attend.
"They're not supposed to be accepted into the
university in the first place," a university official
explained.
Paul Richards, director of the Public Commu
nications Office, was able to state the official
policy of the university. "All students at Brigham
Young University are required to live up to the
Code of Honor. One of the provisions of this
code is that students are to live a life of chastity,
which means never having sexual contact with
another person out of the bond of wedlock. And
of course, we do not recognize the marriage of
two members of the same sex.
"This a church-sponsored university. The
church supplies 66 percent of the tuition of every
student who attends Brigham Young University,
and the church takes a strong stand against
homosexuality. So the church doesn't feel unjus
tified in establishing that Brigham Young is not a
place for homosexuals," he said.

Asked whether the university would expel a
student because he or she was gay, Richards
responded, "First, such a student would be
called in for counseling. If the counseling failed,
then the student could be expelled. But we don't
go around asking students whether or not they
are homosexuals."
Richards said some students have been ex
pelled for homosexuality, but he said he did not
know how many.
Princeton University
The 60 members of the Gay Alliance at
Princeton comprise a very small proportion of
the 4,000 undergraduates who attend Princeton.
If such membership is a true estimate of the
number of gays at Princeton, this breakdown is
far below the national average of 10 percent.
Shawn Cowls, president of the Gay Alliance,
offered an explanation for the small number of
self-proclaimed homosexuals at Princeton.
"Princeton is very old-fashioned and conformist.
People who come here are generally very con
servative and not very political. You see, it's not
as if there is anyone telling anyone else what to
do; it's a self-perpetuating and self-enforced con
formism," he said.
Cowls also attributed part of the level of in
tolerance at Princeton to the eating club system.
"The eating clubs have the effect of subdividing
people into groups which are very much alike; as
a member of an eating club, you're not only a
part of Princeton, but a part of a particular group
in Princeton. The eating clubs are thus very ef
fective instruments of conformity," he said.
Cowls also implied that the political and social
apathy which he said was prevalent at Princeton
in part makes up for the students' intolerance,
saying, "It's a very two-sided situation for us.
There's isn't very much tolerance of
homosexuality at Princeton, and yet there's not
much action against it either; it's not the Prince
ton thing to do to make a fuss."
University of Southern California
The three homosexual student organizations
at USC, the Gay/Lesbian Student Union, the

Gay Men's Colloquium and the Lesbian Rap
Group, are unified under an umbrella organiza
tion called the Gay and Lesbian Student Assem
bly.
Although the GLSA has only 30 students who
are responsible for the organization of events,
hundreds of students attend the functions spon
sored by the organization. For example, the
GLSA recently sponsored a Tuesday night party
which drew 600 people.
Michael Palmieri, chairman of the USC Pro
gram Board, estimated that there are about
3,000 homosexuals among the 27,000 students
at USC. He said there is an adequate level of
tolerance of homosexuality at USC. "It would be
hard to shock the students at USC," he said.
University of Tai-Pei, Taiwan
Students at the newspaper of this university
were unable to offer comment, either because
they were unfamiliar with the concept of
homosexuality or were unwilling to speak on the
topic.
This reaction was typical of newspapers
throughout the East — in Beijing, New Delhi and
elsewhere — with which The Daily conducted
telephone interviews.
A few students advised The Daily to speak
with a doctor, because they said they felt
homosexuality was best discussed as a medical
condition.
Only Dr. Zhe Yian Zhuang of the University of
Tai-Pei Medical Center was willing to offer his
perspective on the status of homosexuality in his
region.
"I think about 1 percent of the population is
gay; some think about 5 percent," Zhe Yian
Zhuang said.
"Most of the homosexuals keep their sexual
preference secret. About only 1 percent of the
homosexual population will openly admit that
they are gay," he said.
"The general public thinks homosexuality is a
defect, but I as a doctor do not think so," he
added.
"The general public disapproves of
homosexuality," he said. "In the future, they will
not accept it. They will disapprove more."
