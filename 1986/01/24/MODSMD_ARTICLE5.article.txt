# Stanford Police Ask, â€˜Who Ya Gonna Call?'

### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
The setting could be straight out of a horror film. An
abandoned carriage house on a hill with bolted doors, broken
and boarded up windows, a roof that is collapsing and paint
that has worn away over the years. The only visible opening
is a broken window on the lower level, just big enough for a
person to climb through.
But rather than sitting on some Hollywood studio's back
lot, the dilapitated building rests on Stanford property, just
behind the Center for Behaviorial Sciences. And according to
some students, the actions that take place inside that
structure, and the materials found there by police, border on
the bizarre.
According to one student, who asked not to be identified,
the second floor of the building features a large room at the
top of an internal stairwell that contains "what we've been
calling an alter."
The student, who entered the house with a few other
curious students on Jan. 12, said the alter-like structure was
made of a board placed across two stands, draped by a stained
sheet and holding a number of candles.
The student said there was writing on the walls that "was

what we thought were satariic symbols" and anti-Christian
graffiti. One sticker on a window read "Kill Cops," he said.
"I don't know if it's devil worship, but something's going
on," the student said.
According to Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington,
police entered the building last weekend and found "some old
candles" and a table cloth on an old table "that could be des
cribed as an alter."
"I don't know just what the purpose was," Herrington said,
adding that he believed officers removed the materials from
the building.
"There was someone apparently in there," Herrington
said, although he added that no one was there when police
went inside the building.
Asked if police found satanic writing on the walls, Her
rington said, "I don't remember anything like that."
A Daily reporter who entered the building yesterday
through a broken window on the ground level found old
desks, classroom material, beer bottles and a red candle on
the first floor.
A large room on the second floor contained the alter-like
structure the student described, although a sheet and candles
were not to be found. A series of tightly-clustered classroom
chairs surrounded the structure.
Another room on the second floor was strewn with pillows,

old carpets, beer bottles, a pipe and a pair of rubber gloves.
The names of several punk-rock groups were scrawled on the
walls.
Herrington said that he didn't "remember any other inci
dent around there," although he added that high school stu
dents occasionally "get up in thai hill site and drink." He also
said the building could have been used as part of a fraternity's
initiation ceremonies.
Alan Henderson, financial officer for the Center for Ad
vanced Study in the Behaviorial Sciences, said there has been
"a continual breaking in" to the building over the years.
Police investigated the carraige house after a second group
of students entered the house on Jan. 16 and reported seeing
a person "in a bright, white gown of some sort with their back
to the group, facing the alter," the student said.
The figure began to raise its arms, turning toward the
group, according to one of the students. The students headed
down the stairs and failed to get a clear look at the person's
face, he said.
Once downstairs, the students ran to the window they had
crawled through to enter. At this time, according to the stu
dent, objects, including a chair, were hurled at the students
by "at least two people." The students noticed that a red
candle that was not lighted when they entered the house was
now burning.
