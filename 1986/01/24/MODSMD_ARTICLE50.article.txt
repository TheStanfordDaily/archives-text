CAMBRIDGE, Mass. â€” Although Stanford continues to
abide by an anti-discrimination statement required by federal
law, several colleges and universities have recently broken
ranks with their counterparts to adopt broad-based anti
discrimination statements.
Harvard University adopted a new and comprehensive anti
discrimination statement last July when the seven-member
Harvard Corporation, the equivalent of the Stanford Board of
Trustees, approved new language that explicitly stated Har
vard's policy in relation to gays, lesbians and other minorities
who often face discrimination.
Commenting on the new policy, Harvard President Derek
Bok said, "As institutions committed to the free exchange of
ideas, universities should endeavor to avoid judging people on
the basis of extraneous factors and should assure access to all
individuals based solely on their ability to contribute to the
pursuit of knowledge and the advancement of the university.
That is what our adoption of the new policy seeks to assure."
Despite an atmosphere of relative acceptance, several re
ported incidents of discrimination concerned many Harvard
gay and lesbian alumni, according to Burton Pierce, who did
graduate work at Stanford after his undergraduate days at
Harvard, where he was involved in the effort to change Har
vard's policy.
"We certainly did not come to the conclusion that Harvard
was a terrible place to be for the gay and lesbian community,"
Pierce said. "On the other hand, there truly is such a thing as
homophobia. Consequently, there had been some unpleasant
incidents regarding students and faculty."

These "low grade" manifestations of anti-gav.bias under
scored the need for the university to take a strong position
against possible discrimination, said William Bennett, presi
dent of the Harvard Gay and Lesbian Caucus and editor of the
Harvard Medical School Health Letter.
The group also feared increasing discrimination and
"tougher times" for gay rights in the midst of increasing public
concern over the spread of AIDS, Pierce said.
The small group then appointed itself as an "unofficial"
visiting committee to advise Bok on modifying the Harvard
statement, Pierce said.
According to Pierce, the committee sought to convince
Bok of the necessity of change by arguing philosophical merits
as well as pointing out discrepancies in the individual policies
of Harvard's schools. Both the Divinity School and the School
of Law had already specified non-discrimination on the basis
of sexual orientation in their individual policies, Pierce said.
The committee also argued that Harvard was obligated to
protect those who might be affected by the "clear" anti-gay
bias in society at large that was "reflected in some extent" in
the university, Pierce said.
According to Pierce, the university was probably also in
fluenced as well by the passage of local human rights or
dinances by Boston in 1984 and Cambridge in early 1985
which specifically cite sexual orientation as a protected cate
gory.
"We were simply stating that we were in a position of
playing 'catch up' on a local level," Pierce said. "Otherwise,
the university seemed to be speaking in many tongues."
According to Bennett, the committee initially encountered
"a fair amount of (negative) inertia" from Harvard administra
tors.
Harvard Vice President and General Counsel Daniel
Steiner told The Daily that administrators originally voiced
mixed views on the proposed changes.
Despite this resistance, the "non-confrontational approach"

of the committee seemed to "trigger the university's sense of
fair play" and resulted in a "progressive warming of relations
as a level of understanding was reached," Bennett said,
By the time the proposal reached the Harvard Corporation,
there was "no serious objection" to it, as many of the prin
ciples stated in the policy had already been expressed by the
university, Steiner said.
In what is seen as an attempt to protect Harvard from legal
action, particularly from such employers as the Department
of Defense which discriminates on the basis of sexual orienta-

Harvard University'operates under
what it calls a "Non-Discrimination
Policy." Harvard announced a revised
version of this policy on July 26, 1985.
The text of the current policy follows:
Harvard University's policy is to make deci
sions concerning applicants, students, faculty
and staff on the basis of the individual's
qualifications to contribute to Harvard's edu
cational objectives and institutional needs.

tion, the university policy does not prohibit employers who
discriminate on such a basis from recruiting on campus.
Steiner said a Harvard policy affecting outside organiza
tions would be inappropriate. "As a university, I don't think
we can ask much more of them than to comply with the law."
The adoption of the policy represents "a significant ad
vance" for Harvard as a leader in society, Bennett said. "I do
feel strongly that universities have some obligation to lead,"
he said.
Even though the move would seem to pressure other
major universities to follow their lead, Steiner said the
"innovator" label did not influence the Harvard decision.

The principle of not discriminating against
individuals on the basis of race, color, sex,
sexual orientation, religion, age, national or
ethnic origin, political beliefs, veteran status,
or disability unrelated to job or course of study
requirements is consistent with the purpose of a
university and the law.
Harvard expects that those with whom it
deals will comply with all applicable an
ti-discrimination laws.
