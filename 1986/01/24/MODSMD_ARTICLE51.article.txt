There is a story, perhaps apocryphal, that when
Queen Victoria was presented with a bill outlawing cer
tain gay and lesbian acts, she refused to believe that
lesbianism existed and had the relevant passages
struck from the bill. In this way, she signed into British
law a ban on male homosexuality that implicitly
condoned lesbianism.
Ignorance, it seems, plays a large part in the amount
of freedom granted homosexuals, both at Stanford and
elsewhere.
Jeff, a Stanford student, said he thinks that gay
couples are generally treated well by other students as
long as such couples are not "blatant" about expressing
their intimacy in public.
While Jeff said he feels that such a requirement is not
too stringent, other homosexuals said they think it un
fair, since heterosexuals are rarely expected to
restrain themselves in a like manner.
A Stanford graduate student questioned whether
such an unfair expectation could be considered a real
acceptance of homosexuality at all.
The idea that gay couples should maintain the ap
pearance of straight lifestyles indicates that some
heterosexuals would prefer to ignore the existence of
homosexuality altogether, according to the graduate
student.
Sophomore Zoe Sutton echoes this sentiment. Par
ticularly in the case of lesbianism, society does not ac
cept it as much as ignore it, she said.
Sutton contends that people at Stanford usually have
a sense of "intellectual tact" which prevents them from
overtly harassing gay and lesbian couples.
This sense of tact tends to break down, however,
when straight students are exposed to homosexual
couples holding hands or dancing together at a party,
she said.
Jeff cited one example in which he and some friends
were dancing together at a small party when they were

encircled by a group of straight male students who
began chanting "faggots".
A lesbian couple described their attempt to take a
class in ballroom dancing as a basically positive experi
ence, save for a man in the class who menacingly fol
lowed them to their car after evening meetings.
In addition to such over harassment, gay couples
have claimed they have to contend with discrimination
perpetrated by the University itself.
As an example, the lesbian couple mentioned above
was married in June by a Presbyterian minister. None
theless, their marriage is not recognized as legal by the
state of California and their application for married
graduate student housing in Escondido Village was
rejected on those grounds.
"This is one case where the church is ahead of the
state," one member of the couple said.
One member of the couple lamented the fact that
people complain about the alleged promiscuity of gay
people when "they (gay people) receive none of the
benefits of abiding by the social institutions that exist
for heterosexuals. Gays who marry have the satisfac
tion of their commitment to each other, but nothing
else, because society never sanctions that commit
ment," she said.
According to Director of Graduate Residences
Patricia Polhemus, the University recognizes only legal
marriages.
Ostensibly, this policy was enacted to prevent all un
married couples from obtaining University-sponsored
housing. Although times and social mores have
changed, University policy has not.
As a result, on-campus housing is available only to
those couples who are heterosexual or who both hap
pen to be students.
Polhemus explained that there would be some legal
problems if Stanford homosexuals could bring their
non-student lovers into the married housing because
then two individuals would hold rent responsibility to
the University instead of one couple under the common
property law for marriage.
"That whole system is based on a way of thinking
that isn't really appropriate any more," she admitted,
though. "Res Ed in general is very good about sexual
preference, but in housing it's difficult."
