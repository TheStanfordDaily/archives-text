# Roommate,
## Roommate 
### MARILYN WANN Editorial staff 
It's called Residential Education for a reason.
You don't get this education from lectures in the
Tank, but from the people in your own dorm — resi
dent fellows, resident assistants, dormmates and
roommates.
The theory is that you should deal with the frustra
tion of being locked out of your room. You should wade
through piles of someone else's laundry. And
sometimes, you should live with someone whose
sexual preferences are different from your own.
That means that if you're heterosexual, you may
have to redraw the lines of your black and white world
to include an unfamiliar piece of reality, but one that
suddenly has a great influence on your life.

And as a gay man or lesbian, you may have to hide,
defend, or at least explain your everyday emotions to
someone with whom you must then continue to live.
"We (at Res Ed) ask people to do a very difficult
thing, which is to live together in a very small cubicle,"
said Asst. Director of Student Affairs Jim Cadena,
who devises the RA training seminar, "Openness to
Differences," each year. This workshop prepares the
University's front line of support during roommate
crises — the RAs — for some of their most trying situ
ations.
"At the end-of-the-year interview with the RAs, for
a long time their most difficult area involved questions
of race. For the last three years, what's been men
tioned is gay and lesbian issues. We knew we had to do
more in this issue," Cadena said about his decision last
September to focus more on the problems of
homosexual life in the dorms.
Providing this day-long opportunity for new RAs to
explore their reactions to issues of race, gender and
sexual preference and then to discuss how they should
deal with these topics in their dorms is Res Ed's main
way of addressing these issues, too.
Res Ed officials say they don't think an elaborate
policy or detailed restrictions would enhance the
learning that they hope goes on between roommates,
including gay/straight combinations.
"We have no special policy for homosexuals," said

Robin Hensley, program coordinator for Res Ed. "We
work with residential staff if a problem does arise,
talking through fears and anxiety, getting beyond
sexual preference to get to know the person as who
they are."
"There's no need for a policy," Cadena agreed. "It's
really barbaric trying to legislate something like that.
People just need to grow up."
Res Ed's response to students who think they can't
tolerate having a gay or lesbian roommate is a firm re
jection most of the time, however.
This approach follows their overriding policy in such
cases that the experience is meant to be educational,
not easy. Unless the situation proves harmful to one of
the roommate's academic studies, no changes will be
made.
Res Ed won't avoid problems, either, by giving gay
and lesbian students extra consideration in getting

singles. Hensley said he doesn't think it's even a con
sideration. "They're in the same position as far as get
ting a single. This issue would be treated the same as
any other roommate change. It's not treated any differ
ently."
And roommate changes aren't made easily.
"You can't decide you don't want to live with some
one on the first day," Hensley explains. "We went you
to try and work it out, understanding their fears and
not bailing out. It's highly unlikely that sexual prefer
ence would be the sole reason for change."
"Maybe he'd be checking me out"
Sophomore Jens Machatzke, who lives in Storey
House now, said he doesn't agree with this policy. He
found out last year, after drawing into the most sought
after residence on campus, that he would have a gay
roommate, one of the house's returning residents. Un
happy with the idea, he talked to Diana Conklin, direc
tor of the Row.
"I said, i'm paying a lot of money for this school.
What are my options?' " he recalled. "She said I could
work it out within the house. She also said that they
had made exceptions in the past but in my case they
wouldn't. She said that living with gays is part of Resi
dential Education. If that's true, then why don't they
expose everybody to it?"

Machatzke's request was turned down by Res Ed
even after his parents called in their complaints; and no
switches could be made in the house because Mac
hatzke's entering resident status didn't entitle him to
oust any returning residents from their chosen rooms,
according to the house rules.
"I had the choice to get reassigned, but I drew with
six friends. Why should I have to move?" Machatzke
asked, still showing some anger at the way Res Ed
handled his case. "It was very clear to me that this
problem had arisen before. I would have strongly con
sidered moving out and boarding somewhere, but then
I would have lost my guaranteed year."
Machatzke found out when he arrived at school this
year that his assigned roommate had stopped out and
therefore would not be living with him. So the prob
lems he anticipated never occurred, but Machatzke still
has some strong opinions on the issue.
"I never met him. Maybe I should have, but I was
scared," Machatzke admitted. "Res Ed made me feel
wrong for wanting this, though, and said that I should
work it out."
"I have nothing against him except that he's
homosexual," Machatzke said. "My attitude toward
gays is that as long as it doesn't affect me, what they
do is their own business. If you room together, though,
your privileges are shared, and it becomes your busi
ness."
Machatzke points out that Res Ed's policies reflect a
double standard, from his perspective. "Stanford
doesn't allow men and women to room together, and
they're complementing sex preferences just like gays
and straights."
His personal objections followed from this argument.
"If I wanted to change in my room, maybe he'd be
checking me out, maybe he wouldn't. That's the same
reason why there are women's and men's locker
rooms."
After trying to get a satisfactory solution to his com
plaints by working through the system, Machatzke said
he was left disillusioned. "They look down on students
and are condescending, like with the alcohol policy and
the way they treat frats, but then in a situation where
they should be more understanding, they give you this
run-around," he said.
"It just never occurred to me"
This situation at Storey didn't prove to be a problem
for junior Ben Page, who roomed with Machatzke's in
tended roommate last year. He didn't find out about it
before moving in, though.
"He sat me down and told me about three or four
weeks into the quarter," Page recalled, describing his
reaction. "It wasn't something that I'd ever really
thought about. It had just never occurred to me to
wonder if someone's gay."
He wasn't completely neutral about it at first,
though. "I had a sort of instinctive distaste for it, but
that's something I got used to. That doesn't really
carry over to how I would feel about a person."
Page admitted to being a little surprised when he
found out about his roommate's homosexuality, "but
not in a bad way," he said. He attributed his calm reac
tion to the very roommate situation which worried
Machatzke.
"Living with someone, you're more relaxed," Page
explained. "If I had met someone who's gay, I might
have taken it as a big deal."
In his case, residential education took the form of a
new appreciation for a person's individuality. "You
never know until you're in a situation. It could be
someone who turns out fine," Page said. "Sexual pref
erence is a ridiculous basis on which to judge some
one."
The important thing for Page was that, although
they weren't "the best of friends," he and his
roommate got along fine, and he now recommends the
experience for people with feelings like Machatzke's.
"It's too bad if anyone's really uncomfortable with it.
Especially for someone who would think they would be
uncomfortable in a situation like that, it would be good
for them," Page said.
"I could never imagine"
One sophomore who lived in Otero his freshmen
year, asking to be identified only as Jeff, talked about
difficulties he has seen other people have in living with
their roommates.
"I don't think that gay people would want to be put in
a room with other gays, or even with women, but I
personally think that it's important to be put in a room
with an open-minded person," he said. "People should
not worry about their roommate wanting to have a rela
tionship with them. I could never imagine wanting to
have a relationship with someone I'm living with in this
situation."
