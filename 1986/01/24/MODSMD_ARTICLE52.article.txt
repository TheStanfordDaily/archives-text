# Roommate,
## Roommate 
### MARILYN WANN Editorial staff 
It's called Residential Education for a reason.
You don't get this education from lectures in the
Tank, but from the people in your own dorm — resi
dent fellows, resident assistants, dormmates and
roommates.
The theory is that you should deal with the frustra
tion of being locked out of your room. You should wade
through piles of someone else's laundry. And
sometimes, you should live with someone whose
sexual preferences are different from your own.
That means that if you're heterosexual, you may
have to redraw the lines of your black and white world
to include an unfamiliar piece of reality, but one that
suddenly has a great influence on your life.

And as a gay man or lesbian, you may have to hide,
defend, or at least explain your everyday emotions to
someone with whom you must then continue to live.
"We (at Res Ed) ask people to do a very difficult
thing, which is to live together in a very small cubicle,"
said Asst. Director of Student Affairs Jim Cadena,
who devises the RA training seminar, "Openness to
Differences," each year. This workshop prepares the
University's front line of support during roommate
crises — the RAs — for some of their most trying situ
ations.
"At the end-of-the-year interview with the RAs, for
a long time their most difficult area involved questions
of race. For the last three years, what's been men
tioned is gay and lesbian issues. We knew we had to do
more in this issue," Cadena said about his decision last
September to focus more on the problems of
homosexual life in the dorms.
Providing this day-long opportunity for new RAs to
explore their reactions to issues of race, gender and
sexual preference and then to discuss how they should
deal with these topics in their dorms is Res Ed's main
way of addressing these issues, too.
Res Ed officials say they don't think an elaborate
policy or detailed restrictions would enhance the
learning that they hope goes on between roommates,
including gay/straight combinations.
"We have no special policy for homosexuals," said

Robin Hensley, program coordinator for Res Ed. "We
work with residential staff if a problem does arise,
talking through fears and anxiety, getting beyond
sexual preference to get to know the person as who
they are."
"There's no need for a policy," Cadena agreed. "It's
really barbaric trying to legislate something like that.
People just need to grow up."
Res Ed's response to students who think they can't
tolerate having a gay or lesbian roommate is a firm re
jection most of the time, however.
This approach follows their overriding policy in such
cases that the experience is meant to be educational,
not easy. Unless the situation proves harmful to one of
the roommate's academic studies, no changes will be
made.
Res Ed won't avoid problems, either, by giving gay
and lesbian students extra consideration in getting

singles. Hensley said he doesn't think it's even a con
sideration. "They're in the same position as far as get
ting a single. This issue would be treated the same as
any other roommate change. It's not treated any differ
ently."
And roommate changes aren't made easily.
"You can't decide you don't want to live with some
one on the first day," Hensley explains. "We went you
to try and work it out, understanding their fears and
not bailing out. It's highly unlikely that sexual prefer
ence would be the sole reason for change."
"Maybe he'd be checking me out"
Sophomore Jens Machatzke, who lives in Storey
House now, said he doesn't agree with this policy. He
found out last year, after drawing into the most sought
after residence on campus, that he would have a gay
roommate, one of the house's returning residents. Un
happy with the idea, he talked to Diana Conklin, direc
tor of the Row.
"I said, i'm paying a lot of money for this school.
What are my options?' " he recalled. "She said I could
work it out within the house. She also said that they
had made exceptions in the past but in my case they
wouldn't. She said that living with gays is part of Resi
dential Education. If that's true, then why don't they
expose everybody to it?"

Machatzke's request was turned down by Res Ed
even after his parents called in their complaints; and no
switches could be made in the house because Mac
hatzke's entering resident status didn't entitle him to
oust any returning residents from their chosen rooms,
according to the house rules.
"I had the choice to get reassigned, but I drew with
six friends. Why should I have to move?" Machatzke
asked, still showing some anger at the way Res Ed
handled his case. "It was very clear to me that this
problem had arisen before. I would have strongly con
sidered moving out and boarding somewhere, but then
I would have lost my guaranteed year."
Machatzke found out when he arrived at school this
year that his assigned roommate had stopped out and
therefore would not be living with him. So the prob
lems he anticipated never occurred, but Machatzke still
has some strong opinions on the issue.
"I never met him. Maybe I should have, but I was
scared," Machatzke admitted. "Res Ed made me feel
wrong for wanting this, though, and said that I should
work it out."
"I have nothing against him except that he's
homosexual," Machatzke said. "My attitude toward
gays is that as long as it doesn't affect me, what they
do is their own business. If you room together, though,
your privileges are shared, and it becomes your busi
ness."
Machatzke points out that Res Ed's policies reflect a
double standard, from his perspective. "Stanford
doesn't allow men and women to room together, and
they're complementing sex preferences just like gays
and straights."
His personal objections followed from this argument.
"If I wanted to change in my room, maybe he'd be
checking me out, maybe he wouldn't. That's the same
reason why there are women's and men's locker
rooms."
After trying to get a satisfactory solution to his com
plaints by working through the system, Machatzke said
he was left disillusioned. "They look down on students
and are condescending, like with the alcohol policy and
the way they treat frats, but then in a situation where
they should be more understanding, they give you this
run-around," he said.
"It just never occurred to me"
This situation at Storey didn't prove to be a problem
for junior Ben Page, who roomed with Machatzke's in
tended roommate last year. He didn't find out about it
before moving in, though.
"He sat me down and told me about three or four
weeks into the quarter," Page recalled, describing his
reaction. "It wasn't something that I'd ever really
thought about. It had just never occurred to me to
wonder if someone's gay."
He wasn't completely neutral about it at first,
though. "I had a sort of instinctive distaste for it, but
that's something I got used to. That doesn't really
carry over to how I would feel about a person."
Page admitted to being a little surprised when he
found out about his roommate's homosexuality, "but
not in a bad way," he said. He attributed his calm reac
tion to the very roommate situation which worried
Machatzke.
"Living with someone, you're more relaxed," Page
explained. "If I had met someone who's gay, I might
have taken it as a big deal."
In his case, residential education took the form of a
new appreciation for a person's individuality. "You
never know until you're in a situation. It could be
someone who turns out fine," Page said. "Sexual pref
erence is a ridiculous basis on which to judge some
one."
The important thing for Page was that, although
they weren't "the best of friends," he and his
roommate got along fine, and he now recommends the
experience for people with feelings like Machatzke's.
"It's too bad if anyone's really uncomfortable with it.
Especially for someone who would think they would be
uncomfortable in a situation like that, it would be good
for them," Page said.
"I could never imagine"
One sophomore who lived in Otero his freshmen
year, asking to be identified only as Jeff, talked about
difficulties he has seen other people have in living with
their roommates.
"I don't think that gay people would want to be put in
a room with other gays, or even with women, but I
personally think that it's important to be put in a room
with an open-minded person," he said. "People should
not worry about their roommate wanting to have a rela
tionship with them. I could never imagine wanting to
have a relationship with someone I'm living with in this
situation."

He did add, though, that occasionally a person will be
attracted to his or her roommate. "I know a guy in
the Suites who is rooming with six to eight guys. They
knew he was gay, but he still has become attracted to
one of the other guys. This usually doesn't happen," he
said.
"It's too easy to go on a soapbox"
Sophomore Daniel Bao's residential education last
year was the experience of coming out to RA Lisa
Naulls and to his freshman year roommate, Eric Vayle.
What he learned about the way people react to fin
ding out he's gay and how he can increase their under
standing helped him when he told sophomore John
Kunstle, his roommate this year and, in an even bigger
step, his parents.
"Usually what happens is that first they don't want to
say anything for fear of insulting you," explained Bao.
"I try to joke about it. Sometimes John (Kunstle) just
forgets and I have to remind him what I'm tallung
about. Then he gets the joke."
Bao said he agrees with Res Ed's idea that students
should learn from the people they live with, and he
takes on the role of teacher himself because he thinks
the more people understand his personality the easier
things will be.
112 "The best way to educate people is to cpme out. It's
too easy to go on a soapbox; people will think you're a
kook. One-on-one is the best way," he concluded.
That conclusion may be the best way, but it wasn't
always the easiest for Bao. He agonized over telling
Vayle during his freshman year, until the Speaker's
Bureau scheduled some of its gay and lesbian members
to talk to Bao's fellow Paloma residents in January.
That gave him the initiative and an excuse to bring it
up.
Bao remembered his anxiety that day when Vayle, in
a bad mood already, started to fill out the Speaker's
Bureau questionnaire that is circulated before the
talks, but left the room after crumpling it up.
"I ran to the trash can the minute he left the room to
see if he had answered the question that asks, 'If your
roommate were gay, would you want him to tell
you?' "said Bao, who then decided just to use the
direct approach.
"He was calmer than I was when I told him," Bao
said, recalling the scene. "1 felt really bad. He was
my freshman roommate. He had no choice. I went in
with the attitude, 'Here's something you should
know.' "
Vayle recounted his version of their conversation in
a separate interview.
"I said, 'Oh.' I was standing up and I sank back on a
chair and said, 'I guess we'll find out now if I'm as
liberal as I say I am.' I'll tell you, that Speaker's Bureau
wasn't as simply educational as it would have been,"
Vayle said, chuckling.
"It was a major event, but it was not a crisis. The
most interesting thing was that he didn't tell me early.
He was so serious," said Vayle, reflecting on his first
reactions.
Like Page's experience in Storey, Bao and Vayle got
to know each other as roommates before they faced
the possible conflict.
Vayle knew Bao well enough by then that he doesn't
remember changing his habits or feeling differently
around his roommate after finding out that he was gay.
"I was the first person he'd ever told. It made me
feel very confident in our friendship that he was placing
not burden but confidence in me," Vayle explained. "It
was harder on him because for me it was all in the
abstract. He wasn't in any relationships."
Vayle didn't have many problems with others who
knew, either, although he said that people did seem to
expect him to be nervous around his roommate.
"People tend to see homosexuals as one-track
people. I knew him as a friend and roommate who hap
pens to be gay," Vayle said to explain the ease of his
adjustment to the news.
He also gave credit to Bao's personality, saying,
"He's one of the most giving people I know, and that
has little to do with his sexual preference."
Vayle's residential education proved a positive ex
perience for him, as he said, "It certainly enlightened
me to the fact that there's just so much more to people
than who they choose to be with."
He could think of only one drawback living with Bao
during the year. "He was a slob," Vayle revealed in a
confidential tone. "That was the only reason I didn't
ask him to be my roommate again."
"It' 9 just an expression"
Kunstle, Bao's current roommate, agreed with both
of Vayle's conclusions, saying, "I'm more concerned
with the type of person I live with, their idiosyncracies,

than whether he's gay. He is kind of a slob, but I lived
with a slob last year."
Kunstle found out five weeks into the year that his
roommate is gay and said his first thought was, 'Wow,
I hope I haven't done anything to offend him."
Bao said this kind of reaction was better than if
Kunstle had said nothing. "The worst kind of response
when you tell someone that you're gay is, 'Oh, that's
nice.' You don't know what the person is feeling."
Now, Kunstle says he's adjusted to the situation by
not really changing at all. "We approach it from all the
basic roommate problems — who's going to clean the
fridge?"
"As far as changing in the room goes, I usually let
him worry about that sort of thing because he's always
dealt with that in men's locker rooms and bathrooms,"
Kunstle explained. "He's had to learn to deal with two
types of males."
After living with a gay roommate, Kunstle said he
can understand the predicament Red Ed officials face,
and he thinks they've handled it as well as they can.
"There is no comparable policy where they put men
and women in the same room and say, 'This is gonna
be educational.' There's no traditional social place for
gays to live, though. They're part way here and part
way there. You can't put them with the girls," Kunstle
reasoned.
He said that no amount of thinking about the interac
tion of gay and straight roommates would have been
the same as actually going through it. "Being in the sit
uation, I learned about my reactions. I watch what I
say. I realize the unconscious stereotypes. You hear
people say, 'That's gay.' It's just an expression, but
habits can be hard to break."
For Bao, these experiences in residential education
gave him the strength to finally confront his mother
with the truth.
"I used this article as a psychological ploy to get
myself to tell them," he said during the interview,
after expressing concern that some of the other
sources hadn't wanted their names printed. He decided
that his comments shouldn't be anonymous.
"Last night I told her," he said. "She said she ex
pected it. She went through the whole spectrum of
reactions very fast. First, she said it was just a phase,
then asked me if I was sure, suggested I see a psychol
ogist, or maybe wait a while to make sure.
"Then she went to the other extreme the morning
after I told her, saying, 'I love you, I really do,' " Bao
recounted with mild surprise at his mother's adap
tability.
Bao considers himself lucky that the reactions from
people who know have been so understanding and that
he's never had any encounters with belligerent people
in public.
He said he's not sure what will happen as a result of
being in a campus publication like this, though. "It
should be interesting to see what my freshman year
dormmates will think. Some of them might not take it
well," he said, choosing his words carefully.
"A lot of times people make a distinction between
the person and the sexual preference," Bao said, hint
ing that this attitude doesn't really allow the gay per
son to be himself, although he understands why it's an
attractive idea. "That way they can be totally negative
on gays and still like the person."
"There's no need for a policy"
Naulls, an RAin Paloma when Bao lived there, and
his friend that year, agreed with his approach. "I tried
to keep an open mind and put myself in the position of
the person coming in and entrusting himself to me,"
she said, recalling that she never really worried about
Bao's adjustment as much as that of the people around
him.
"I had no worries, really, because knowing Daniel, I
know he's a really balanced person and would grow
from it," Naulls said, reflecting on her responsibility as
an RA to the two roommates. "With Eric, I was very
observant. I felt it wasn't my place to tell Eric on my
own, but I would check in and ask how things were
going in general, and he always said that everything
was cool."
Naulls never knew that Bao had come out to his
roommate, because she had never noticed a change in
his behavior at all. "I'm pleasantly surprised," she said.
"Other people in the house would have had definite dif
ficulties with it."
In analyzing the education she got from Res Ed, she
said that most of it took place during the training semi
nar on the differences of race, gender and sexuality. "It
helped me learn how to structure my questions, deal
with touchy subjects," she said.
She didn't use the specific training in talking to Bao
as much as the more open attitude the seminar gave
her. Naulls said she left everything open to him,
asking how he felt about himself coming out and how
he felt about telling others. If there had been prob
lems with Bao's roommate, she said her main action
would have been to help put them both in an empat
hetic state of mind.
"The workshop is enough preparation for these
situation," Naulls said from her experience.
"There's no need for a policy."
"Death to gays"
Cadena explained more about the techniques his
workshop uses to give RAs this preparation. "We
ask them, 'Can you put your own judgments aside
when you have to relate to this person and help
others to be sensitive?' " he said.
During the seminar, new RAs are asked to define
terms like, "dyke," "lesbian" or "queen," in a
process of becoming aware of their own attitudes.
Then they are given hypothetical dorm situations
and asked how they would handle them.
"There are no right answers, but the idea is to
get reactions," Cadena said, explaining this phase.
The result of these planned activities and the discus
sion which they provoke is supposed to be an RA's
increase ability to talk about subjects that are loaded
with emothions and strong opinions for most stu
dents. This ability should help RAs in situations
when they need to lead other students through the
same process.
"In any situation where there's a conflict, the per
son who's uncomfortable has probably never talked
about what it is," Cadena said. He described the
"Openness to Differences" seminar as the best way
to show RAs how to break down the barriers to that
talk.
"It's a difficult area for people to deal with, and
RAs are also young," Cadena admitted. "It's difficult
for them to call people out, to respond assertively to
gay persecution. People come back and say to
them, 'You must be gay.' "
He described one incident that took place several
years ago in a graduate student's dorm. A student
had put a sign on his door that read, "Death to
gays," when a student living down the hall was
known to be gay. "The RA was extremely coura
geous and told the person it was horrible by asking,
'Do you realize what this means?' That person took
a hard line, but the student realized what he had
really been saying and turned around and
apologized," Cadena said.
The increasing occurrence of RA crises like this
one necessitated the shift of Res Ed's focus to ad
dressing gay and lesbian issues more in the seminar.
"It seemed to be really focused on sexuality,"
recalled senior Melissa Fischer, an RAin Alondra
who considers herself as having a "lesbian view
point," which she defined as more than a sexual ori
entation, but also a political and philosophical out
look.
"Homosexuality is something I've thought a lot
about. It was good for me to learn what people who
haven't thought about this were thinking."
She was unhappy at first with the seminar's meth
ods, though. "I didn't even want to do it (the defini
tion activity). The trap you fall on by doing that is
defining stereotypes," she said.
She realized, after participating for a little while,
that the structure of the game got people talking.
"It's better that they've thought about it in the
workshop than gotten received instruction," she
concluded.
A tense debate grew out of this discussion, during
which Fischer said she argued against most of the
others who held that homosexuality by definition re
quired a physical relationship. "It went back and
forth for 10 minutes. There was this tension. I felt
like any minute we d say, 'I've had enough,' " she
said. "Trust built up in the group instead. I
didn't expect that the mainstream people would lis
ten to me."
With the freshmen living in her dorm now, she
avoids preaching quite so strongly on the issues, in
stead asking questions that will get informal debates
started in the hall.
She sees the most common attitude as freshmen
who say, "Yes, it's fine, but my children aren't going
to be homosexual.' "
"If you're going to say it's OK, you have a respon
sibility to make a place for homosexuals," is Fis
cher's reply.
She uses her RA role to educate about the lives of
gays and lesbians.
"Homosexuals today have to inhibit their behav
ior. There's a real tension in your life," she ex
plained. "We should work against those tensions in
the dorms."
"The people who scream the loudest and are of
fended by it the most are thinking about it. I'm
excited by it when they bring it up themselves," she
said of her freshmen. "They're certainly very aware
of my political attitudes and of their word choice
when they're around me; they say 'woman' instead
of 'girl.' I don't kow if they all know (about her les
bian viewpoint), but they certainly presume a lot."
Fischer wanted to be an RA to continue the im
portant influence her freshman year RA had on her
in learning to accept the differences she saw in her
self and in others. Between the freshman and senior
years, she chose to live in Synergy, where the resi
dents share this openness, she said.
Of her roommate experiences, she said, "It's a
great thing to (mix people with different sexual
preferences) because it leads to respect for the indi
vidual and the freedom to let someone else be what
they want to be."
She recounted her personal history to explain
how she developed this attitude. During her fresh
man year, she wasn't woman-identified or actively
seeking the company of women, but this was begin
ning to change.
"It's not heterosexuality that turned me off, but
all the things that went with it," she said. "You have
a boyfriend and you only have one, and there are
certain ways you act. I would enjoy figuring the guy
out and then there was nothing else to it."
"I started to think, Wouldn't it be nice to be in a
relationship where you get back what you're
giving?' " Fischer recalled. She doesn't like to label
herself with the word "lesbian" because for her it in

eludes more than it implies; it is a nurturing attitude
and also a politicial stance.
"When people talk about homosexuals, what they
presume is that 24 hours a day you're having sex,
remarked Fischer with disbelief. Her goal is to use
the system of residential education to at least give
students the opportunity to learn something differ
ent from the accepted stereotypes.
"Dorms aren't all that receptive"
Another longtime Synergy resident, senior Lisa
Rubin, chose to avoid the dorms, and often even
roommates, unless she was sure the people she
would be living with had the type of understanding
Fischer is trying to provide.
"I've had singles because I can only live with
someone who knows me very well, she explained.
"I can't live with someone who isn t comfortable
enough with my relationships not to scurry out of
the room if something is going on."
The roommate she was placed with her freshman
year never suspected what was going on, Rubin
remembered. "No women, I felt, knew me at all.
She started the year in love with her RA, who
was a man. But even while she had this crush, she
knew that other things were going on. By spring
quarter, she'd become involved in a long-lasting les
bian relationship, which she hid from her roommate
by spending most of her time in her lover's dorm.
"I don't think she understood what was going on,"
she said, explaining that her roommate was annoyed
that Rubin spent so much time away without expla
nation.
That summer, Rubin and her lover did what many
homosexual couples do; they lived off campus.
"Dorms aren't all that receptive," she explained.
Rubin joined the Speaker's Bureau to provide res
idential education as much as she could without
having to live in the dorms.
"My room wasn't my room"
For a former Stern freshman, there was no es
caping life in a large dorm with an assigned
roommate, all the things that Rubins avoided.
His roommate was against homosexuality be
cause of fundamentalist religious beliefs, but also
felt that he had no right to censor or restrict an
other's actions.

"I didn't know he even knew for a while," said the
sophomore, who asked that his name be withheld.
His roommate never discussed his sexual prefer
ence with him, making him feel that he should
restrict his behavior to avoid pushing the issue.
So whenever he brought friends over, they made
an effort to sit across the room from each other and
never thought of touching when the roommate was
around.
"My room wasn't my room," he remembered.
"There was something about having to act differ
ently there. Other girlfriends were my roommates.
I felt more comfortable in my best girlfriend's room
than my own."
He said he is much happier this year, living with a
friend who is also gay. "I'm much more comfortable
now not having to deal with those little head trips.
Nudity isn't a problem, which is kind of funny to
assume that just because you have a penis, we (gay
roommates) are just out to jump you."
"Personality is more important than that," he
said, agreeing with Vayle and Page.
His view of his residential education was two
sided. There were opportunities for both growth
and persecution. "For a straight person, it can be
very educational. I know I changed a lot of minds in
the dorm," he recalled. "Or it can be absolute hell.
The problem that I foresee is that I could have very
easily gotten stuck with one of the belligerent
homophobes."
He was positive about the benefits in the end,
though, saying, "You become more sure of yourself
because you have to explain yourself and clarify
your own position, which can be wonderful."
Cadena agreed that the possible outcomes of gay
and straight people living together should be good
most of the time. "There are lots of difficult situa
tions people have to live with, and living with a gay
roommate is probably the easiest thing to deal
with."

It's called Residential Education for a reason.
You don't get this education from lectures in the
Tank, but from the people in your own dorm — resi
dent fellows, resident assistants, dormmates and
roommates.
The theory is that you should deal with the frustra
tion of being locked out of your room. You should wade
through piles of someone else's laundry. And
sometimes, you should live with someone whose
sexual preferences are different from your own.
That means that if you're heterosexual, you may
have to redraw the lines of your black and white world
to include an unfamiliar piece of reality, but one that
suddenly has a great influence on your life.

And as a gay man or lesbian, you may have to hide,
defend, or at least explain your everyday emotions to
someone with whom you must then continue to live.
"We (at Res Ed) ask people to do a very difficult
thing, which is to live together in a very small cubicle,"
said Asst. Director of Student Affairs Jim Cadena,
who devises the RA training seminar, "Openness to
Differences," each year. This workshop prepares the
University's front line of support during roommate
crises — the RAs — for some of their most trying situ
ations.
"At the end-of-the-year interview with the RAs, for
a long time their most difficult area involved questions
of race. For the last three years, what's been men
tioned is gay and lesbian issues. We knew we had to do
more in this issue," Cadena said about his decision last
September to focus more on the problems of
homosexual life in the dorms.
Providing this day-long opportunity for new RAs to
explore their reactions to issues of race, gender and
sexual preference and then to discuss how they should
deal with these topics in their dorms is Res Ed's main
way of addressing these issues, too.
Res Ed officials say they don't think an elaborate
policy or detailed restrictions would enhance the
learning that they hope goes on between roommates,
including gay/straight combinations.
"We have no special policy for homosexuals," said

Robin Hensley, program coordinator for Res Ed. "We
work with residential staff if a problem does arise,
talking through fears and anxiety, getting beyond
sexual preference to get to know the person as who
they are."
"There's no need for a policy," Cadena agreed. "It's
really barbaric trying to legislate something like that.
People just need to grow up."
Res Ed's response to students who think they can't
tolerate having a gay or lesbian roommate is a firm re
jection most of the time, however.
This approach follows their overriding policy in such
cases that the experience is meant to be educational,
not easy. Unless the situation proves harmful to one of
the roommate's academic studies, no changes will be
made.
Res Ed won't avoid problems, either, by giving gay
and lesbian students extra consideration in getting

singles. Hensley said he doesn't think it's even a con
sideration. "They're in the same position as far as get
ting a single. This issue would be treated the same as
any other roommate change. It's not treated any differ
ently."
And roommate changes aren't made easily.
"You can't decide you don't want to live with some
one on the first day," Hensley explains. "We went you
to try and work it out, understanding their fears and
not bailing out. It's highly unlikely that sexual prefer
ence would be the sole reason for change."
"Maybe he'd be checking me out"
Sophomore Jens Machatzke, who lives in Storey
House now, said he doesn't agree with this policy. He
found out last year, after drawing into the most sought
after residence on campus, that he would have a gay
roommate, one of the house's returning residents. Un
happy with the idea, he talked to Diana Conklin, direc
tor of the Row.
"I said, i'm paying a lot of money for this school.
What are my options?' " he recalled. "She said I could
work it out within the house. She also said that they
had made exceptions in the past but in my case they
wouldn't. She said that living with gays is part of Resi
dential Education. If that's true, then why don't they
expose everybody to it?"

Machatzke's request was turned down by Res Ed
even after his parents called in their complaints; and no
switches could be made in the house because Mac
hatzke's entering resident status didn't entitle him to
oust any returning residents from their chosen rooms,
according to the house rules.
"I had the choice to get reassigned, but I drew with
six friends. Why should I have to move?" Machatzke
asked, still showing some anger at the way Res Ed
handled his case. "It was very clear to me that this
problem had arisen before. I would have strongly con
sidered moving out and boarding somewhere, but then
I would have lost my guaranteed year."
Machatzke found out when he arrived at school this
year that his assigned roommate had stopped out and
therefore would not be living with him. So the prob
lems he anticipated never occurred, but Machatzke still
has some strong opinions on the issue.
"I never met him. Maybe I should have, but I was
scared," Machatzke admitted. "Res Ed made me feel
wrong for wanting this, though, and said that I should
work it out."
"I have nothing against him except that he's
homosexual," Machatzke said. "My attitude toward
gays is that as long as it doesn't affect me, what they
do is their own business. If you room together, though,
your privileges are shared, and it becomes your busi
ness."
Machatzke points out that Res Ed's policies reflect a
double standard, from his perspective. "Stanford
doesn't allow men and women to room together, and
they're complementing sex preferences just like gays
and straights."
His personal objections followed from this argument.
"If I wanted to change in my room, maybe he'd be
checking me out, maybe he wouldn't. That's the same
reason why there are women's and men's locker
rooms."
After trying to get a satisfactory solution to his com
plaints by working through the system, Machatzke said
he was left disillusioned. "They look down on students
and are condescending, like with the alcohol policy and
the way they treat frats, but then in a situation where
they should be more understanding, they give you this
run-around," he said.
"It just never occurred to me"
This situation at Storey didn't prove to be a problem
for junior Ben Page, who roomed with Machatzke's in
tended roommate last year. He didn't find out about it
before moving in, though.
"He sat me down and told me about three or four
weeks into the quarter," Page recalled, describing his
reaction. "It wasn't something that I'd ever really
thought about. It had just never occurred to me to
wonder if someone's gay."
He wasn't completely neutral about it at first,
though. "I had a sort of instinctive distaste for it, but
that's something I got used to. That doesn't really
carry over to how I would feel about a person."
Page admitted to being a little surprised when he
found out about his roommate's homosexuality, "but
not in a bad way," he said. He attributed his calm reac
tion to the very roommate situation which worried
Machatzke.
"Living with someone, you're more relaxed," Page
explained. "If I had met someone who's gay, I might
have taken it as a big deal."
In his case, residential education took the form of a
new appreciation for a person's individuality. "You
never know until you're in a situation. It could be
someone who turns out fine," Page said. "Sexual pref
erence is a ridiculous basis on which to judge some
one."
The important thing for Page was that, although
they weren't "the best of friends," he and his
roommate got along fine, and he now recommends the
experience for people with feelings like Machatzke's.
"It's too bad if anyone's really uncomfortable with it.
Especially for someone who would think they would be
uncomfortable in a situation like that, it would be good
for them," Page said.
"I could never imagine"
One sophomore who lived in Otero his freshmen
year, asking to be identified only as Jeff, talked about
difficulties he has seen other people have in living with
their roommates.
"I don't think that gay people would want to be put in
a room with other gays, or even with women, but I
personally think that it's important to be put in a room
with an open-minded person," he said. "People should
not worry about their roommate wanting to have a rela
tionship with them. I could never imagine wanting to
have a relationship with someone I'm living with in this
situation."

He did add, though, that occasionally a person will be
attracted to his or her roommate. "I know a guy in
the Suites who is rooming with six to eight guys. They
knew he was gay, but he still has become attracted to
one of the other guys. This usually doesn't happen," he
said.
"It's too easy to go on a soapbox"
Sophomore Daniel Bao's residential education last
year was the experience of coming out to RA Lisa
Naulls and to his freshman year roommate, Eric Vayle.
What he learned about the way people react to fin
ding out he's gay and how he can increase their under
standing helped him when he told sophomore John
Kunstle, his roommate this year and, in an even bigger
step, his parents.
"Usually what happens is that first they don't want to
say anything for fear of insulting you," explained Bao.
"I try to joke about it. Sometimes John (Kunstle) just
forgets and I have to remind him what I'm tallung
about. Then he gets the joke."
Bao said he agrees with Res Ed's idea that students
should learn from the people they live with, and he
takes on the role of teacher himself because he thinks
the more people understand his personality the easier
things will be.
112 "The best way to educate people is to cpme out. It's
too easy to go on a soapbox; people will think you're a
kook. One-on-one is the best way," he concluded.
That conclusion may be the best way, but it wasn't
always the easiest for Bao. He agonized over telling
Vayle during his freshman year, until the Speaker's
Bureau scheduled some of its gay and lesbian members
to talk to Bao's fellow Paloma residents in January.
That gave him the initiative and an excuse to bring it
up.
Bao remembered his anxiety that day when Vayle, in
a bad mood already, started to fill out the Speaker's
Bureau questionnaire that is circulated before the
talks, but left the room after crumpling it up.
"I ran to the trash can the minute he left the room to
see if he had answered the question that asks, 'If your
roommate were gay, would you want him to tell
you?' "said Bao, who then decided just to use the
direct approach.
"He was calmer than I was when I told him," Bao
said, recalling the scene. "1 felt really bad. He was
my freshman roommate. He had no choice. I went in
with the attitude, 'Here's something you should
know.' "
Vayle recounted his version of their conversation in
a separate interview.
"I said, 'Oh.' I was standing up and I sank back on a
chair and said, 'I guess we'll find out now if I'm as
liberal as I say I am.' I'll tell you, that Speaker's Bureau
wasn't as simply educational as it would have been,"
Vayle said, chuckling.
"It was a major event, but it was not a crisis. The
most interesting thing was that he didn't tell me early.
He was so serious," said Vayle, reflecting on his first
reactions.
Like Page's experience in Storey, Bao and Vayle got
to know each other as roommates before they faced
the possible conflict.
Vayle knew Bao well enough by then that he doesn't
remember changing his habits or feeling differently
around his roommate after finding out that he was gay.
"I was the first person he'd ever told. It made me
feel very confident in our friendship that he was placing
not burden but confidence in me," Vayle explained. "It
was harder on him because for me it was all in the
abstract. He wasn't in any relationships."
Vayle didn't have many problems with others who
knew, either, although he said that people did seem to
expect him to be nervous around his roommate.
"People tend to see homosexuals as one-track
people. I knew him as a friend and roommate who hap
pens to be gay," Vayle said to explain the ease of his
adjustment to the news.
He also gave credit to Bao's personality, saying,
"He's one of the most giving people I know, and that
has little to do with his sexual preference."
Vayle's residential education proved a positive ex
perience for him, as he said, "It certainly enlightened
me to the fact that there's just so much more to people
than who they choose to be with."
He could think of only one drawback living with Bao
during the year. "He was a slob," Vayle revealed in a
confidential tone. "That was the only reason I didn't
ask him to be my roommate again."
"It' 9 just an expression"
Kunstle, Bao's current roommate, agreed with both
of Vayle's conclusions, saying, "I'm more concerned
with the type of person I live with, their idiosyncracies,

than whether he's gay. He is kind of a slob, but I lived
with a slob last year."
Kunstle found out five weeks into the year that his
roommate is gay and said his first thought was, 'Wow,
I hope I haven't done anything to offend him."
Bao said this kind of reaction was better than if
Kunstle had said nothing. "The worst kind of response
when you tell someone that you're gay is, 'Oh, that's
nice.' You don't know what the person is feeling."
Now, Kunstle says he's adjusted to the situation by
not really changing at all. "We approach it from all the
basic roommate problems — who's going to clean the
fridge?"
"As far as changing in the room goes, I usually let
him worry about that sort of thing because he's always
dealt with that in men's locker rooms and bathrooms,"
Kunstle explained. "He's had to learn to deal with two
types of males."
After living with a gay roommate, Kunstle said he
can understand the predicament Red Ed officials face,
and he thinks they've handled it as well as they can.
"There is no comparable policy where they put men
and women in the same room and say, 'This is gonna
be educational.' There's no traditional social place for
gays to live, though. They're part way here and part
way there. You can't put them with the girls," Kunstle
reasoned.
He said that no amount of thinking about the interac
tion of gay and straight roommates would have been
the same as actually going through it. "Being in the sit
uation, I learned about my reactions. I watch what I
say. I realize the unconscious stereotypes. You hear
people say, 'That's gay.' It's just an expression, but
habits can be hard to break."
For Bao, these experiences in residential education
gave him the strength to finally confront his mother
with the truth.
"I used this article as a psychological ploy to get
myself to tell them," he said during the interview,
after expressing concern that some of the other
sources hadn't wanted their names printed. He decided
that his comments shouldn't be anonymous.
"Last night I told her," he said. "She said she ex
pected it. She went through the whole spectrum of
reactions very fast. First, she said it was just a phase,
then asked me if I was sure, suggested I see a psychol
ogist, or maybe wait a while to make sure.
"Then she went to the other extreme the morning
after I told her, saying, 'I love you, I really do,' " Bao
recounted with mild surprise at his mother's adap
tability.
Bao considers himself lucky that the reactions from
people who know have been so understanding and that
he's never had any encounters with belligerent people
in public.
He said he's not sure what will happen as a result of
being in a campus publication like this, though. "It
should be interesting to see what my freshman year
dormmates will think. Some of them might not take it
well," he said, choosing his words carefully.
"A lot of times people make a distinction between
the person and the sexual preference," Bao said, hint
ing that this attitude doesn't really allow the gay per
son to be himself, although he understands why it's an
attractive idea. "That way they can be totally negative
on gays and still like the person."
"There's no need for a policy"
Naulls, an RAin Paloma when Bao lived there, and
his friend that year, agreed with his approach. "I tried
to keep an open mind and put myself in the position of
the person coming in and entrusting himself to me,"
she said, recalling that she never really worried about
Bao's adjustment as much as that of the people around
him.
"I had no worries, really, because knowing Daniel, I
know he's a really balanced person and would grow
from it," Naulls said, reflecting on her responsibility as
an RA to the two roommates. "With Eric, I was very
observant. I felt it wasn't my place to tell Eric on my
own, but I would check in and ask how things were
going in general, and he always said that everything
was cool."
Naulls never knew that Bao had come out to his
roommate, because she had never noticed a change in
his behavior at all. "I'm pleasantly surprised," she said.
"Other people in the house would have had definite dif
ficulties with it."
In analyzing the education she got from Res Ed, she
said that most of it took place during the training semi
nar on the differences of race, gender and sexuality. "It
helped me learn how to structure my questions, deal
with touchy subjects," she said.
She didn't use the specific training in talking to Bao
as much as the more open attitude the seminar gave
her. Naulls said she left everything open to him,
asking how he felt about himself coming out and how
he felt about telling others. If there had been prob
lems with Bao's roommate, she said her main action
would have been to help put them both in an empat
hetic state of mind.
"The workshop is enough preparation for these
situation," Naulls said from her experience.
"There's no need for a policy."
"Death to gays"
Cadena explained more about the techniques his
workshop uses to give RAs this preparation. "We
ask them, 'Can you put your own judgments aside
when you have to relate to this person and help
others to be sensitive?' " he said.
During the seminar, new RAs are asked to define
terms like, "dyke," "lesbian" or "queen," in a
process of becoming aware of their own attitudes.
Then they are given hypothetical dorm situations
and asked how they would handle them.
"There are no right answers, but the idea is to
get reactions," Cadena said, explaining this phase.
The result of these planned activities and the discus
sion which they provoke is supposed to be an RA's
increase ability to talk about subjects that are loaded
with emothions and strong opinions for most stu
dents. This ability should help RAs in situations
when they need to lead other students through the
same process.
"In any situation where there's a conflict, the per
son who's uncomfortable has probably never talked
about what it is," Cadena said. He described the
"Openness to Differences" seminar as the best way
to show RAs how to break down the barriers to that
talk.
"It's a difficult area for people to deal with, and
RAs are also young," Cadena admitted. "It's difficult
for them to call people out, to respond assertively to
gay persecution. People come back and say to
them, 'You must be gay.' "
He described one incident that took place several
years ago in a graduate student's dorm. A student
had put a sign on his door that read, "Death to
gays," when a student living down the hall was
known to be gay. "The RA was extremely coura
geous and told the person it was horrible by asking,
'Do you realize what this means?' That person took
a hard line, but the student realized what he had
really been saying and turned around and
apologized," Cadena said.
The increasing occurrence of RA crises like this
one necessitated the shift of Res Ed's focus to ad
dressing gay and lesbian issues more in the seminar.
"It seemed to be really focused on sexuality,"
recalled senior Melissa Fischer, an RAin Alondra
who considers herself as having a "lesbian view
point," which she defined as more than a sexual ori
entation, but also a political and philosophical out
look.
"Homosexuality is something I've thought a lot
about. It was good for me to learn what people who
haven't thought about this were thinking."
She was unhappy at first with the seminar's meth
ods, though. "I didn't even want to do it (the defini
tion activity). The trap you fall on by doing that is
defining stereotypes," she said.
She realized, after participating for a little while,
that the structure of the game got people talking.
"It's better that they've thought about it in the
workshop than gotten received instruction," she
concluded.
A tense debate grew out of this discussion, during
which Fischer said she argued against most of the
others who held that homosexuality by definition re
quired a physical relationship. "It went back and
forth for 10 minutes. There was this tension. I felt
like any minute we d say, 'I've had enough,' " she
said. "Trust built up in the group instead. I
didn't expect that the mainstream people would lis
ten to me."
With the freshmen living in her dorm now, she
avoids preaching quite so strongly on the issues, in
stead asking questions that will get informal debates
started in the hall.
She sees the most common attitude as freshmen
who say, "Yes, it's fine, but my children aren't going
to be homosexual.' "
"If you're going to say it's OK, you have a respon
sibility to make a place for homosexuals," is Fis
cher's reply.
She uses her RA role to educate about the lives of
gays and lesbians.
"Homosexuals today have to inhibit their behav
ior. There's a real tension in your life," she ex
plained. "We should work against those tensions in
the dorms."
"The people who scream the loudest and are of
fended by it the most are thinking about it. I'm
excited by it when they bring it up themselves," she
said of her freshmen. "They're certainly very aware
of my political attitudes and of their word choice
when they're around me; they say 'woman' instead
of 'girl.' I don't kow if they all know (about her les
bian viewpoint), but they certainly presume a lot."
Fischer wanted to be an RA to continue the im
portant influence her freshman year RA had on her
in learning to accept the differences she saw in her
self and in others. Between the freshman and senior
years, she chose to live in Synergy, where the resi
dents share this openness, she said.
Of her roommate experiences, she said, "It's a
great thing to (mix people with different sexual
preferences) because it leads to respect for the indi
vidual and the freedom to let someone else be what
they want to be."
She recounted her personal history to explain
how she developed this attitude. During her fresh
man year, she wasn't woman-identified or actively
seeking the company of women, but this was begin
ning to change.
"It's not heterosexuality that turned me off, but
all the things that went with it," she said. "You have
a boyfriend and you only have one, and there are
certain ways you act. I would enjoy figuring the guy
out and then there was nothing else to it."
"I started to think, Wouldn't it be nice to be in a
relationship where you get back what you're
giving?' " Fischer recalled. She doesn't like to label
herself with the word "lesbian" because for her it in

eludes more than it implies; it is a nurturing attitude
and also a politicial stance.
"When people talk about homosexuals, what they
presume is that 24 hours a day you're having sex,
remarked Fischer with disbelief. Her goal is to use
the system of residential education to at least give
students the opportunity to learn something differ
ent from the accepted stereotypes.
"Dorms aren't all that receptive"
Another longtime Synergy resident, senior Lisa
Rubin, chose to avoid the dorms, and often even
roommates, unless she was sure the people she
would be living with had the type of understanding
Fischer is trying to provide.
"I've had singles because I can only live with
someone who knows me very well, she explained.
"I can't live with someone who isn t comfortable
enough with my relationships not to scurry out of
the room if something is going on."
The roommate she was placed with her freshman
year never suspected what was going on, Rubin
remembered. "No women, I felt, knew me at all.
She started the year in love with her RA, who
was a man. But even while she had this crush, she
knew that other things were going on. By spring
quarter, she'd become involved in a long-lasting les
bian relationship, which she hid from her roommate
by spending most of her time in her lover's dorm.
"I don't think she understood what was going on,"
she said, explaining that her roommate was annoyed
that Rubin spent so much time away without expla
nation.
That summer, Rubin and her lover did what many
homosexual couples do; they lived off campus.
"Dorms aren't all that receptive," she explained.
Rubin joined the Speaker's Bureau to provide res
idential education as much as she could without
having to live in the dorms.
"My room wasn't my room"
For a former Stern freshman, there was no es
caping life in a large dorm with an assigned
roommate, all the things that Rubins avoided.
His roommate was against homosexuality be
cause of fundamentalist religious beliefs, but also
felt that he had no right to censor or restrict an
other's actions.

"I didn't know he even knew for a while," said the
sophomore, who asked that his name be withheld.
His roommate never discussed his sexual prefer
ence with him, making him feel that he should
restrict his behavior to avoid pushing the issue.
So whenever he brought friends over, they made
an effort to sit across the room from each other and
never thought of touching when the roommate was
around.
"My room wasn't my room," he remembered.
"There was something about having to act differ
ently there. Other girlfriends were my roommates.
I felt more comfortable in my best girlfriend's room
than my own."
He said he is much happier this year, living with a
friend who is also gay. "I'm much more comfortable
now not having to deal with those little head trips.
Nudity isn't a problem, which is kind of funny to
assume that just because you have a penis, we (gay
roommates) are just out to jump you."
"Personality is more important than that," he
said, agreeing with Vayle and Page.
His view of his residential education was two
sided. There were opportunities for both growth
and persecution. "For a straight person, it can be
very educational. I know I changed a lot of minds in
the dorm," he recalled. "Or it can be absolute hell.
The problem that I foresee is that I could have very
easily gotten stuck with one of the belligerent
homophobes."
He was positive about the benefits in the end,
though, saying, "You become more sure of yourself
because you have to explain yourself and clarify
your own position, which can be wonderful."
Cadena agreed that the possible outcomes of gay
and straight people living together should be good
most of the time. "There are lots of difficult situa
tions people have to live with, and living with a gay
roommate is probably the easiest thing to deal
with."
- Research assistance by Scott Roth

It's called Residential Education for a reason.
You don't get this education from lectures in the
Tank, but from the people in your own dorm — resi
dent fellows, resident assistants, dormmates and
roommates.
The theory is that you should deal with the frustra
tion of being locked out of your room. You should wade
through piles of someone else's laundry. And
sometimes, you should live with someone whose
sexual preferences are different from your own.
That means that if you're heterosexual, you may
have to redraw the lines of your black and white world
to include an unfamiliar piece of reality, but one that
suddenly has a great influence on your life.

And as a gay man or lesbian, you may have to hide,
defend, or at least explain your everyday emotions to
someone with whom you must then continue to live.
"We (at Res Ed) ask people to do a very difficult
thing, which is to live together in a very small cubicle,"
said Asst. Director of Student Affairs Jim Cadena,
who devises the RA training seminar, "Openness to
Differences," each year. This workshop prepares the
University's front line of support during roommate
crises — the RAs — for some of their most trying situ
ations.
"At the end-of-the-year interview with the RAs, for
a long time their most difficult area involved questions
of race. For the last three years, what's been men
tioned is gay and lesbian issues. We knew we had to do
more in this issue," Cadena said about his decision last
September to focus more on the problems of
homosexual life in the dorms.
Providing this day-long opportunity for new RAs to
explore their reactions to issues of race, gender and
sexual preference and then to discuss how they should
deal with these topics in their dorms is Res Ed's main
way of addressing these issues, too.
Res Ed officials say they don't think an elaborate
policy or detailed restrictions would enhance the
learning that they hope goes on between roommates,
including gay/straight combinations.
"We have no special policy for homosexuals," said

Robin Hensley, program coordinator for Res Ed. "We
work with residential staff if a problem does arise,
talking through fears and anxiety, getting beyond
sexual preference to get to know the person as who
they are."
"There's no need for a policy," Cadena agreed. "It's
really barbaric trying to legislate something like that.
People just need to grow up."
Res Ed's response to students who think they can't
tolerate having a gay or lesbian roommate is a firm re
jection most of the time, however.
This approach follows their overriding policy in such
cases that the experience is meant to be educational,
not easy. Unless the situation proves harmful to one of
the roommate's academic studies, no changes will be
made.
Res Ed won't avoid problems, either, by giving gay
and lesbian students extra consideration in getting

singles. Hensley said he doesn't think it's even a con
sideration. "They're in the same position as far as get
ting a single. This issue would be treated the same as
any other roommate change. It's not treated any differ
ently."
And roommate changes aren't made easily.
"You can't decide you don't want to live with some
one on the first day," Hensley explains. "We went you
to try and work it out, understanding their fears and
not bailing out. It's highly unlikely that sexual prefer
ence would be the sole reason for change."
"Maybe he'd be checking me out"
Sophomore Jens Machatzke, who lives in Storey
House now, said he doesn't agree with this policy. He
found out last year, after drawing into the most sought
after residence on campus, that he would have a gay
roommate, one of the house's returning residents. Un
happy with the idea, he talked to Diana Conklin, direc
tor of the Row.
"I said, i'm paying a lot of money for this school.
What are my options?' " he recalled. "She said I could
work it out within the house. She also said that they
had made exceptions in the past but in my case they
wouldn't. She said that living with gays is part of Resi
dential Education. If that's true, then why don't they
expose everybody to it?"

Machatzke's request was turned down by Res Ed
even after his parents called in their complaints; and no
switches could be made in the house because Mac
hatzke's entering resident status didn't entitle him to
oust any returning residents from their chosen rooms,
according to the house rules.
"I had the choice to get reassigned, but I drew with
six friends. Why should I have to move?" Machatzke
asked, still showing some anger at the way Res Ed
handled his case. "It was very clear to me that this
problem had arisen before. I would have strongly con
sidered moving out and boarding somewhere, but then
I would have lost my guaranteed year."
Machatzke found out when he arrived at school this
year that his assigned roommate had stopped out and
therefore would not be living with him. So the prob
lems he anticipated never occurred, but Machatzke still
has some strong opinions on the issue.
"I never met him. Maybe I should have, but I was
scared," Machatzke admitted. "Res Ed made me feel
wrong for wanting this, though, and said that I should
work it out."
"I have nothing against him except that he's
homosexual," Machatzke said. "My attitude toward
gays is that as long as it doesn't affect me, what they
do is their own business. If you room together, though,
your privileges are shared, and it becomes your busi
ness."
Machatzke points out that Res Ed's policies reflect a
double standard, from his perspective. "Stanford
doesn't allow men and women to room together, and
they're complementing sex preferences just like gays
and straights."
His personal objections followed from this argument.
"If I wanted to change in my room, maybe he'd be
checking me out, maybe he wouldn't. That's the same
reason why there are women's and men's locker
rooms."
After trying to get a satisfactory solution to his com
plaints by working through the system, Machatzke said
he was left disillusioned. "They look down on students
and are condescending, like with the alcohol policy and
the way they treat frats, but then in a situation where
they should be more understanding, they give you this
run-around," he said.
"It just never occurred to me"
This situation at Storey didn't prove to be a problem
for junior Ben Page, who roomed with Machatzke's in
tended roommate last year. He didn't find out about it
before moving in, though.
"He sat me down and told me about three or four
weeks into the quarter," Page recalled, describing his
reaction. "It wasn't something that I'd ever really
thought about. It had just never occurred to me to
wonder if someone's gay."
He wasn't completely neutral about it at first,
though. "I had a sort of instinctive distaste for it, but
that's something I got used to. That doesn't really
carry over to how I would feel about a person."
Page admitted to being a little surprised when he
found out about his roommate's homosexuality, "but
not in a bad way," he said. He attributed his calm reac
tion to the very roommate situation which worried
Machatzke.
"Living with someone, you're more relaxed," Page
explained. "If I had met someone who's gay, I might
have taken it as a big deal."
In his case, residential education took the form of a
new appreciation for a person's individuality. "You
never know until you're in a situation. It could be
someone who turns out fine," Page said. "Sexual pref
erence is a ridiculous basis on which to judge some
one."
The important thing for Page was that, although
they weren't "the best of friends," he and his
roommate got along fine, and he now recommends the
experience for people with feelings like Machatzke's.
"It's too bad if anyone's really uncomfortable with it.
Especially for someone who would think they would be
uncomfortable in a situation like that, it would be good
for them," Page said.
"I could never imagine"
One sophomore who lived in Otero his freshmen
year, asking to be identified only as Jeff, talked about
difficulties he has seen other people have in living with
their roommates.
"I don't think that gay people would want to be put in
a room with other gays, or even with women, but I
personally think that it's important to be put in a room
with an open-minded person," he said. "People should
not worry about their roommate wanting to have a rela
tionship with them. I could never imagine wanting to
have a relationship with someone I'm living with in this
situation."

He did add, though, that occasionally a person will be
attracted to his or her roommate. "I know a guy in
the Suites who is rooming with six to eight guys. They
knew he was gay, but he still has become attracted to
one of the other guys. This usually doesn't happen," he
said.
"It's too easy to go on a soapbox"
Sophomore Daniel Bao's residential education last
year was the experience of coming out to RA Lisa
Naulls and to his freshman year roommate, Eric Vayle.
What he learned about the way people react to fin
ding out he's gay and how he can increase their under
standing helped him when he told sophomore John
Kunstle, his roommate this year and, in an even bigger
step, his parents.
"Usually what happens is that first they don't want to
say anything for fear of insulting you," explained Bao.
"I try to joke about it. Sometimes John (Kunstle) just
forgets and I have to remind him what I'm tallung
about. Then he gets the joke."
Bao said he agrees with Res Ed's idea that students
should learn from the people they live with, and he
takes on the role of teacher himself because he thinks
the more people understand his personality the easier
things will be.
112 "The best way to educate people is to cpme out. It's
too easy to go on a soapbox; people will think you're a
kook. One-on-one is the best way," he concluded.
That conclusion may be the best way, but it wasn't
always the easiest for Bao. He agonized over telling
Vayle during his freshman year, until the Speaker's
Bureau scheduled some of its gay and lesbian members
to talk to Bao's fellow Paloma residents in January.
That gave him the initiative and an excuse to bring it
up.
Bao remembered his anxiety that day when Vayle, in
a bad mood already, started to fill out the Speaker's
Bureau questionnaire that is circulated before the
talks, but left the room after crumpling it up.
"I ran to the trash can the minute he left the room to
see if he had answered the question that asks, 'If your
roommate were gay, would you want him to tell
you?' "said Bao, who then decided just to use the
direct approach.
"He was calmer than I was when I told him," Bao
said, recalling the scene. "1 felt really bad. He was
my freshman roommate. He had no choice. I went in
with the attitude, 'Here's something you should
know.' "
Vayle recounted his version of their conversation in
a separate interview.
"I said, 'Oh.' I was standing up and I sank back on a
chair and said, 'I guess we'll find out now if I'm as
liberal as I say I am.' I'll tell you, that Speaker's Bureau
wasn't as simply educational as it would have been,"
Vayle said, chuckling.
"It was a major event, but it was not a crisis. The
most interesting thing was that he didn't tell me early.
He was so serious," said Vayle, reflecting on his first
reactions.
Like Page's experience in Storey, Bao and Vayle got
to know each other as roommates before they faced
the possible conflict.
Vayle knew Bao well enough by then that he doesn't
remember changing his habits or feeling differently
around his roommate after finding out that he was gay.
"I was the first person he'd ever told. It made me
feel very confident in our friendship that he was placing
not burden but confidence in me," Vayle explained. "It
was harder on him because for me it was all in the
abstract. He wasn't in any relationships."
Vayle didn't have many problems with others who
knew, either, although he said that people did seem to
expect him to be nervous around his roommate.
"People tend to see homosexuals as one-track
people. I knew him as a friend and roommate who hap
pens to be gay," Vayle said to explain the ease of his
adjustment to the news.
He also gave credit to Bao's personality, saying,
"He's one of the most giving people I know, and that
has little to do with his sexual preference."
Vayle's residential education proved a positive ex
perience for him, as he said, "It certainly enlightened
me to the fact that there's just so much more to people
than who they choose to be with."
He could think of only one drawback living with Bao
during the year. "He was a slob," Vayle revealed in a
confidential tone. "That was the only reason I didn't
ask him to be my roommate again."
"It' 9 just an expression"
Kunstle, Bao's current roommate, agreed with both
of Vayle's conclusions, saying, "I'm more concerned
with the type of person I live with, their idiosyncracies,

than whether he's gay. He is kind of a slob, but I lived
with a slob last year."
Kunstle found out five weeks into the year that his
roommate is gay and said his first thought was, 'Wow,
I hope I haven't done anything to offend him."
Bao said this kind of reaction was better than if
Kunstle had said nothing. "The worst kind of response
when you tell someone that you're gay is, 'Oh, that's
nice.' You don't know what the person is feeling."
Now, Kunstle says he's adjusted to the situation by
not really changing at all. "We approach it from all the
basic roommate problems — who's going to clean the
fridge?"
"As far as changing in the room goes, I usually let
him worry about that sort of thing because he's always
dealt with that in men's locker rooms and bathrooms,"
Kunstle explained. "He's had to learn to deal with two
types of males."
After living with a gay roommate, Kunstle said he
can understand the predicament Red Ed officials face,
and he thinks they've handled it as well as they can.
"There is no comparable policy where they put men
and women in the same room and say, 'This is gonna
be educational.' There's no traditional social place for
gays to live, though. They're part way here and part
way there. You can't put them with the girls," Kunstle
reasoned.
He said that no amount of thinking about the interac
tion of gay and straight roommates would have been
the same as actually going through it. "Being in the sit
uation, I learned about my reactions. I watch what I
say. I realize the unconscious stereotypes. You hear
people say, 'That's gay.' It's just an expression, but
habits can be hard to break."
For Bao, these experiences in residential education
gave him the strength to finally confront his mother
with the truth.
"I used this article as a psychological ploy to get
myself to tell them," he said during the interview,
after expressing concern that some of the other
sources hadn't wanted their names printed. He decided
that his comments shouldn't be anonymous.
"Last night I told her," he said. "She said she ex
pected it. She went through the whole spectrum of
reactions very fast. First, she said it was just a phase,
then asked me if I was sure, suggested I see a psychol
ogist, or maybe wait a while to make sure.
"Then she went to the other extreme the morning
after I told her, saying, 'I love you, I really do,' " Bao
recounted with mild surprise at his mother's adap
tability.
Bao considers himself lucky that the reactions from
people who know have been so understanding and that
he's never had any encounters with belligerent people
in public.
He said he's not sure what will happen as a result of
being in a campus publication like this, though. "It
should be interesting to see what my freshman year
dormmates will think. Some of them might not take it
well," he said, choosing his words carefully.
"A lot of times people make a distinction between
the person and the sexual preference," Bao said, hint
ing that this attitude doesn't really allow the gay per
son to be himself, although he understands why it's an
attractive idea. "That way they can be totally negative
on gays and still like the person."
"There's no need for a policy"
Naulls, an RAin Paloma when Bao lived there, and
his friend that year, agreed with his approach. "I tried
to keep an open mind and put myself in the position of
the person coming in and entrusting himself to me,"
she said, recalling that she never really worried about
Bao's adjustment as much as that of the people around
him.
"I had no worries, really, because knowing Daniel, I
know he's a really balanced person and would grow
from it," Naulls said, reflecting on her responsibility as
an RA to the two roommates. "With Eric, I was very
observant. I felt it wasn't my place to tell Eric on my
own, but I would check in and ask how things were
going in general, and he always said that everything
was cool."
Naulls never knew that Bao had come out to his
roommate, because she had never noticed a change in
his behavior at all. "I'm pleasantly surprised," she said.
"Other people in the house would have had definite dif
ficulties with it."
In analyzing the education she got from Res Ed, she
said that most of it took place during the training semi
nar on the differences of race, gender and sexuality. "It
helped me learn how to structure my questions, deal
with touchy subjects," she said.
She didn't use the specific training in talking to Bao
as much as the more open attitude the seminar gave
her. Naulls said she left everything open to him,
asking how he felt about himself coming out and how
he felt about telling others. If there had been prob
lems with Bao's roommate, she said her main action
would have been to help put them both in an empat
hetic state of mind.
"The workshop is enough preparation for these
situation," Naulls said from her experience.
"There's no need for a policy."
"Death to gays"
Cadena explained more about the techniques his
workshop uses to give RAs this preparation. "We
ask them, 'Can you put your own judgments aside
when you have to relate to this person and help
others to be sensitive?' " he said.
During the seminar, new RAs are asked to define
terms like, "dyke," "lesbian" or "queen," in a
process of becoming aware of their own attitudes.
Then they are given hypothetical dorm situations
and asked how they would handle them.
"There are no right answers, but the idea is to
get reactions," Cadena said, explaining this phase.
The result of these planned activities and the discus
sion which they provoke is supposed to be an RA's
increase ability to talk about subjects that are loaded
with emothions and strong opinions for most stu
dents. This ability should help RAs in situations
when they need to lead other students through the
same process.
"In any situation where there's a conflict, the per
son who's uncomfortable has probably never talked
about what it is," Cadena said. He described the
"Openness to Differences" seminar as the best way
to show RAs how to break down the barriers to that
talk.
"It's a difficult area for people to deal with, and
RAs are also young," Cadena admitted. "It's difficult
for them to call people out, to respond assertively to
gay persecution. People come back and say to
them, 'You must be gay.' "
He described one incident that took place several
years ago in a graduate student's dorm. A student
had put a sign on his door that read, "Death to
gays," when a student living down the hall was
known to be gay. "The RA was extremely coura
geous and told the person it was horrible by asking,
'Do you realize what this means?' That person took
a hard line, but the student realized what he had
really been saying and turned around and
apologized," Cadena said.
The increasing occurrence of RA crises like this
one necessitated the shift of Res Ed's focus to ad
dressing gay and lesbian issues more in the seminar.
"It seemed to be really focused on sexuality,"
recalled senior Melissa Fischer, an RAin Alondra
who considers herself as having a "lesbian view
point," which she defined as more than a sexual ori
entation, but also a political and philosophical out
look.
"Homosexuality is something I've thought a lot
about. It was good for me to learn what people who
haven't thought about this were thinking."
She was unhappy at first with the seminar's meth
ods, though. "I didn't even want to do it (the defini
tion activity). The trap you fall on by doing that is
defining stereotypes," she said.
She realized, after participating for a little while,
that the structure of the game got people talking.
"It's better that they've thought about it in the
workshop than gotten received instruction," she
concluded.
A tense debate grew out of this discussion, during
which Fischer said she argued against most of the
others who held that homosexuality by definition re
quired a physical relationship. "It went back and
forth for 10 minutes. There was this tension. I felt
like any minute we d say, 'I've had enough,' " she
said. "Trust built up in the group instead. I
didn't expect that the mainstream people would lis
ten to me."
With the freshmen living in her dorm now, she
avoids preaching quite so strongly on the issues, in
stead asking questions that will get informal debates
started in the hall.
She sees the most common attitude as freshmen
who say, "Yes, it's fine, but my children aren't going
to be homosexual.' "
"If you're going to say it's OK, you have a respon
sibility to make a place for homosexuals," is Fis
cher's reply.
She uses her RA role to educate about the lives of
gays and lesbians.
"Homosexuals today have to inhibit their behav
ior. There's a real tension in your life," she ex
plained. "We should work against those tensions in
the dorms."
"The people who scream the loudest and are of
fended by it the most are thinking about it. I'm
excited by it when they bring it up themselves," she
said of her freshmen. "They're certainly very aware
of my political attitudes and of their word choice
when they're around me; they say 'woman' instead
of 'girl.' I don't kow if they all know (about her les
bian viewpoint), but they certainly presume a lot."
Fischer wanted to be an RA to continue the im
portant influence her freshman year RA had on her
in learning to accept the differences she saw in her
self and in others. Between the freshman and senior
years, she chose to live in Synergy, where the resi
dents share this openness, she said.
Of her roommate experiences, she said, "It's a
great thing to (mix people with different sexual
preferences) because it leads to respect for the indi
vidual and the freedom to let someone else be what
they want to be."
She recounted her personal history to explain
how she developed this attitude. During her fresh
man year, she wasn't woman-identified or actively
seeking the company of women, but this was begin
ning to change.
"It's not heterosexuality that turned me off, but
all the things that went with it," she said. "You have
a boyfriend and you only have one, and there are
certain ways you act. I would enjoy figuring the guy
out and then there was nothing else to it."
"I started to think, Wouldn't it be nice to be in a
relationship where you get back what you're
giving?' " Fischer recalled. She doesn't like to label
herself with the word "lesbian" because for her it in

eludes more than it implies; it is a nurturing attitude
and also a politicial stance.
"When people talk about homosexuals, what they
presume is that 24 hours a day you're having sex,
remarked Fischer with disbelief. Her goal is to use
the system of residential education to at least give
students the opportunity to learn something differ
ent from the accepted stereotypes.
"Dorms aren't all that receptive"
Another longtime Synergy resident, senior Lisa
Rubin, chose to avoid the dorms, and often even
roommates, unless she was sure the people she
would be living with had the type of understanding
Fischer is trying to provide.
"I've had singles because I can only live with
someone who knows me very well, she explained.
"I can't live with someone who isn t comfortable
enough with my relationships not to scurry out of
the room if something is going on."
The roommate she was placed with her freshman
year never suspected what was going on, Rubin
remembered. "No women, I felt, knew me at all.
She started the year in love with her RA, who
was a man. But even while she had this crush, she
knew that other things were going on. By spring
quarter, she'd become involved in a long-lasting les
bian relationship, which she hid from her roommate
by spending most of her time in her lover's dorm.
"I don't think she understood what was going on,"
she said, explaining that her roommate was annoyed
that Rubin spent so much time away without expla
nation.
That summer, Rubin and her lover did what many
homosexual couples do; they lived off campus.
"Dorms aren't all that receptive," she explained.
Rubin joined the Speaker's Bureau to provide res
idential education as much as she could without
having to live in the dorms.
"My room wasn't my room"
For a former Stern freshman, there was no es
caping life in a large dorm with an assigned
roommate, all the things that Rubins avoided.
His roommate was against homosexuality be
cause of fundamentalist religious beliefs, but also
felt that he had no right to censor or restrict an
other's actions.

"I didn't know he even knew for a while," said the
sophomore, who asked that his name be withheld.
His roommate never discussed his sexual prefer
ence with him, making him feel that he should
restrict his behavior to avoid pushing the issue.
So whenever he brought friends over, they made
an effort to sit across the room from each other and
never thought of touching when the roommate was
around.
"My room wasn't my room," he remembered.
"There was something about having to act differ
ently there. Other girlfriends were my roommates.
I felt more comfortable in my best girlfriend's room
than my own."
He said he is much happier this year, living with a
friend who is also gay. "I'm much more comfortable
now not having to deal with those little head trips.
Nudity isn't a problem, which is kind of funny to
assume that just because you have a penis, we (gay
roommates) are just out to jump you."
"Personality is more important than that," he
said, agreeing with Vayle and Page.
His view of his residential education was two
sided. There were opportunities for both growth
and persecution. "For a straight person, it can be
very educational. I know I changed a lot of minds in
the dorm," he recalled. "Or it can be absolute hell.
The problem that I foresee is that I could have very
easily gotten stuck with one of the belligerent
homophobes."
He was positive about the benefits in the end,
though, saying, "You become more sure of yourself
because you have to explain yourself and clarify
your own position, which can be wonderful."
Cadena agreed that the possible outcomes of gay
and straight people living together should be good
most of the time. "There are lots of difficult situa
tions people have to live with, and living with a gay
roommate is probably the easiest thing to deal
with."
- Research assistance by Scott Roth

It's called Residential Education for a reason.
You don't get this education from lectures in the
Tank, but from the people in your own dorm — resi
dent fellows, resident assistants, dormmates and
roommates.
The theory is that you should deal with the frustra
tion of being locked out of your room. You should wade
through piles of someone else's laundry. And
sometimes, you should live with someone whose
sexual preferences are different from your own.
That means that if you're heterosexual, you may
have to redraw the lines of your black and white world
to include an unfamiliar piece of reality, but one that
suddenly has a great influence on your life.

And as a gay man or lesbian, you may have to hide,
defend, or at least explain your everyday emotions to
someone with whom you must then continue to live.
"We (at Res Ed) ask people to do a very difficult
thing, which is to live together in a very small cubicle,"
said Asst. Director of Student Affairs Jim Cadena,
who devises the RA training seminar, "Openness to
Differences," each year. This workshop prepares the
University's front line of support during roommate
crises — the RAs — for some of their most trying situ
ations.
"At the end-of-the-year interview with the RAs, for
a long time their most difficult area involved questions
of race. For the last three years, what's been men
tioned is gay and lesbian issues. We knew we had to do
more in this issue," Cadena said about his decision last
September to focus more on the problems of
homosexual life in the dorms.
Providing this day-long opportunity for new RAs to
explore their reactions to issues of race, gender and
sexual preference and then to discuss how they should
deal with these topics in their dorms is Res Ed's main
way of addressing these issues, too.
Res Ed officials say they don't think an elaborate
policy or detailed restrictions would enhance the
learning that they hope goes on between roommates,
including gay/straight combinations.
"We have no special policy for homosexuals," said

Robin Hensley, program coordinator for Res Ed. "We
work with residential staff if a problem does arise,
talking through fears and anxiety, getting beyond
sexual preference to get to know the person as who
they are."
"There's no need for a policy," Cadena agreed. "It's
really barbaric trying to legislate something like that.
People just need to grow up."
Res Ed's response to students who think they can't
tolerate having a gay or lesbian roommate is a firm re
jection most of the time, however.
This approach follows their overriding policy in such
cases that the experience is meant to be educational,
not easy. Unless the situation proves harmful to one of
the roommate's academic studies, no changes will be
made.
Res Ed won't avoid problems, either, by giving gay
and lesbian students extra consideration in getting

singles. Hensley said he doesn't think it's even a con
sideration. "They're in the same position as far as get
ting a single. This issue would be treated the same as
any other roommate change. It's not treated any differ
ently."
And roommate changes aren't made easily.
"You can't decide you don't want to live with some
one on the first day," Hensley explains. "We went you
to try and work it out, understanding their fears and
not bailing out. It's highly unlikely that sexual prefer
ence would be the sole reason for change."
"Maybe he'd be checking me out"
Sophomore Jens Machatzke, who lives in Storey
House now, said he doesn't agree with this policy. He
found out last year, after drawing into the most sought
after residence on campus, that he would have a gay
roommate, one of the house's returning residents. Un
happy with the idea, he talked to Diana Conklin, direc
tor of the Row.
"I said, i'm paying a lot of money for this school.
What are my options?' " he recalled. "She said I could
work it out within the house. She also said that they
had made exceptions in the past but in my case they
wouldn't. She said that living with gays is part of Resi
dential Education. If that's true, then why don't they
expose everybody to it?"

Machatzke's request was turned down by Res Ed
even after his parents called in their complaints; and no
switches could be made in the house because Mac
hatzke's entering resident status didn't entitle him to
oust any returning residents from their chosen rooms,
according to the house rules.
"I had the choice to get reassigned, but I drew with
six friends. Why should I have to move?" Machatzke
asked, still showing some anger at the way Res Ed
handled his case. "It was very clear to me that this
problem had arisen before. I would have strongly con
sidered moving out and boarding somewhere, but then
I would have lost my guaranteed year."
Machatzke found out when he arrived at school this
year that his assigned roommate had stopped out and
therefore would not be living with him. So the prob
lems he anticipated never occurred, but Machatzke still
has some strong opinions on the issue.
"I never met him. Maybe I should have, but I was
scared," Machatzke admitted. "Res Ed made me feel
wrong for wanting this, though, and said that I should
work it out."
"I have nothing against him except that he's
homosexual," Machatzke said. "My attitude toward
gays is that as long as it doesn't affect me, what they
do is their own business. If you room together, though,
your privileges are shared, and it becomes your busi
ness."
Machatzke points out that Res Ed's policies reflect a
double standard, from his perspective. "Stanford
doesn't allow men and women to room together, and
they're complementing sex preferences just like gays
and straights."
His personal objections followed from this argument.
"If I wanted to change in my room, maybe he'd be
checking me out, maybe he wouldn't. That's the same
reason why there are women's and men's locker
rooms."
After trying to get a satisfactory solution to his com
plaints by working through the system, Machatzke said
he was left disillusioned. "They look down on students
and are condescending, like with the alcohol policy and
the way they treat frats, but then in a situation where
they should be more understanding, they give you this
run-around," he said.
"It just never occurred to me"
This situation at Storey didn't prove to be a problem
for junior Ben Page, who roomed with Machatzke's in
tended roommate last year. He didn't find out about it
before moving in, though.
"He sat me down and told me about three or four
weeks into the quarter," Page recalled, describing his
reaction. "It wasn't something that I'd ever really
thought about. It had just never occurred to me to
wonder if someone's gay."
He wasn't completely neutral about it at first,
though. "I had a sort of instinctive distaste for it, but
that's something I got used to. That doesn't really
carry over to how I would feel about a person."
Page admitted to being a little surprised when he
found out about his roommate's homosexuality, "but
not in a bad way," he said. He attributed his calm reac
tion to the very roommate situation which worried
Machatzke.
"Living with someone, you're more relaxed," Page
explained. "If I had met someone who's gay, I might
have taken it as a big deal."
In his case, residential education took the form of a
new appreciation for a person's individuality. "You
never know until you're in a situation. It could be
someone who turns out fine," Page said. "Sexual pref
erence is a ridiculous basis on which to judge some
one."
The important thing for Page was that, although
they weren't "the best of friends," he and his
roommate got along fine, and he now recommends the
experience for people with feelings like Machatzke's.
"It's too bad if anyone's really uncomfortable with it.
Especially for someone who would think they would be
uncomfortable in a situation like that, it would be good
for them," Page said.
"I could never imagine"
One sophomore who lived in Otero his freshmen
year, asking to be identified only as Jeff, talked about
difficulties he has seen other people have in living with
their roommates.
"I don't think that gay people would want to be put in
a room with other gays, or even with women, but I
personally think that it's important to be put in a room
with an open-minded person," he said. "People should
not worry about their roommate wanting to have a rela
tionship with them. I could never imagine wanting to
have a relationship with someone I'm living with in this
situation."

He did add, though, that occasionally a person will be
attracted to his or her roommate. "I know a guy in
the Suites who is rooming with six to eight guys. They
knew he was gay, but he still has become attracted to
one of the other guys. This usually doesn't happen," he
said.
"It's too easy to go on a soapbox"
Sophomore Daniel Bao's residential education last
year was the experience of coming out to RA Lisa
Naulls and to his freshman year roommate, Eric Vayle.
What he learned about the way people react to fin
ding out he's gay and how he can increase their under
standing helped him when he told sophomore John
Kunstle, his roommate this year and, in an even bigger
step, his parents.
"Usually what happens is that first they don't want to
say anything for fear of insulting you," explained Bao.
"I try to joke about it. Sometimes John (Kunstle) just
forgets and I have to remind him what I'm tallung
about. Then he gets the joke."
Bao said he agrees with Res Ed's idea that students
should learn from the people they live with, and he
takes on the role of teacher himself because he thinks
the more people understand his personality the easier
things will be.
112 "The best way to educate people is to cpme out. It's
too easy to go on a soapbox; people will think you're a
kook. One-on-one is the best way," he concluded.
That conclusion may be the best way, but it wasn't
always the easiest for Bao. He agonized over telling
Vayle during his freshman year, until the Speaker's
Bureau scheduled some of its gay and lesbian members
to talk to Bao's fellow Paloma residents in January.
That gave him the initiative and an excuse to bring it
up.
Bao remembered his anxiety that day when Vayle, in
a bad mood already, started to fill out the Speaker's
Bureau questionnaire that is circulated before the
talks, but left the room after crumpling it up.
"I ran to the trash can the minute he left the room to
see if he had answered the question that asks, 'If your
roommate were gay, would you want him to tell
you?' "said Bao, who then decided just to use the
direct approach.
"He was calmer than I was when I told him," Bao
said, recalling the scene. "1 felt really bad. He was
my freshman roommate. He had no choice. I went in
with the attitude, 'Here's something you should
know.' "
Vayle recounted his version of their conversation in
a separate interview.
"I said, 'Oh.' I was standing up and I sank back on a
chair and said, 'I guess we'll find out now if I'm as
liberal as I say I am.' I'll tell you, that Speaker's Bureau
wasn't as simply educational as it would have been,"
Vayle said, chuckling.
"It was a major event, but it was not a crisis. The
most interesting thing was that he didn't tell me early.
He was so serious," said Vayle, reflecting on his first
reactions.
Like Page's experience in Storey, Bao and Vayle got
to know each other as roommates before they faced
the possible conflict.
Vayle knew Bao well enough by then that he doesn't
remember changing his habits or feeling differently
around his roommate after finding out that he was gay.
"I was the first person he'd ever told. It made me
feel very confident in our friendship that he was placing
not burden but confidence in me," Vayle explained. "It
was harder on him because for me it was all in the
abstract. He wasn't in any relationships."
Vayle didn't have many problems with others who
knew, either, although he said that people did seem to
expect him to be nervous around his roommate.
"People tend to see homosexuals as one-track
people. I knew him as a friend and roommate who hap
pens to be gay," Vayle said to explain the ease of his
adjustment to the news.
He also gave credit to Bao's personality, saying,
"He's one of the most giving people I know, and that
has little to do with his sexual preference."
Vayle's residential education proved a positive ex
perience for him, as he said, "It certainly enlightened
me to the fact that there's just so much more to people
than who they choose to be with."
He could think of only one drawback living with Bao
during the year. "He was a slob," Vayle revealed in a
confidential tone. "That was the only reason I didn't
ask him to be my roommate again."
"It' 9 just an expression"
Kunstle, Bao's current roommate, agreed with both
of Vayle's conclusions, saying, "I'm more concerned
with the type of person I live with, their idiosyncracies,

than whether he's gay. He is kind of a slob, but I lived
with a slob last year."
Kunstle found out five weeks into the year that his
roommate is gay and said his first thought was, 'Wow,
I hope I haven't done anything to offend him."
Bao said this kind of reaction was better than if
Kunstle had said nothing. "The worst kind of response
when you tell someone that you're gay is, 'Oh, that's
nice.' You don't know what the person is feeling."
Now, Kunstle says he's adjusted to the situation by
not really changing at all. "We approach it from all the
basic roommate problems — who's going to clean the
fridge?"
"As far as changing in the room goes, I usually let
him worry about that sort of thing because he's always
dealt with that in men's locker rooms and bathrooms,"
Kunstle explained. "He's had to learn to deal with two
types of males."
After living with a gay roommate, Kunstle said he
can understand the predicament Red Ed officials face,
and he thinks they've handled it as well as they can.
"There is no comparable policy where they put men
and women in the same room and say, 'This is gonna
be educational.' There's no traditional social place for
gays to live, though. They're part way here and part
way there. You can't put them with the girls," Kunstle
reasoned.
He said that no amount of thinking about the interac
tion of gay and straight roommates would have been
the same as actually going through it. "Being in the sit
uation, I learned about my reactions. I watch what I
say. I realize the unconscious stereotypes. You hear
people say, 'That's gay.' It's just an expression, but
habits can be hard to break."
For Bao, these experiences in residential education
gave him the strength to finally confront his mother
with the truth.
"I used this article as a psychological ploy to get
myself to tell them," he said during the interview,
after expressing concern that some of the other
sources hadn't wanted their names printed. He decided
that his comments shouldn't be anonymous.
"Last night I told her," he said. "She said she ex
pected it. She went through the whole spectrum of
reactions very fast. First, she said it was just a phase,
then asked me if I was sure, suggested I see a psychol
ogist, or maybe wait a while to make sure.
"Then she went to the other extreme the morning
after I told her, saying, 'I love you, I really do,' " Bao
recounted with mild surprise at his mother's adap
tability.
Bao considers himself lucky that the reactions from
people who know have been so understanding and that
he's never had any encounters with belligerent people
in public.
He said he's not sure what will happen as a result of
being in a campus publication like this, though. "It
should be interesting to see what my freshman year
dormmates will think. Some of them might not take it
well," he said, choosing his words carefully.
"A lot of times people make a distinction between
the person and the sexual preference," Bao said, hint
ing that this attitude doesn't really allow the gay per
son to be himself, although he understands why it's an
attractive idea. "That way they can be totally negative
on gays and still like the person."
"There's no need for a policy"
Naulls, an RAin Paloma when Bao lived there, and
his friend that year, agreed with his approach. "I tried
to keep an open mind and put myself in the position of
the person coming in and entrusting himself to me,"
she said, recalling that she never really worried about
Bao's adjustment as much as that of the people around
him.
"I had no worries, really, because knowing Daniel, I
know he's a really balanced person and would grow
from it," Naulls said, reflecting on her responsibility as
an RA to the two roommates. "With Eric, I was very
observant. I felt it wasn't my place to tell Eric on my
own, but I would check in and ask how things were
going in general, and he always said that everything
was cool."
Naulls never knew that Bao had come out to his
roommate, because she had never noticed a change in
his behavior at all. "I'm pleasantly surprised," she said.
"Other people in the house would have had definite dif
ficulties with it."
In analyzing the education she got from Res Ed, she
said that most of it took place during the training semi
nar on the differences of race, gender and sexuality. "It
helped me learn how to structure my questions, deal
with touchy subjects," she said.
She didn't use the specific training in talking to Bao
as much as the more open attitude the seminar gave
her. Naulls said she left everything open to him,
asking how he felt about himself coming out and how
he felt about telling others. If there had been prob
lems with Bao's roommate, she said her main action
would have been to help put them both in an empat
hetic state of mind.
"The workshop is enough preparation for these
situation," Naulls said from her experience.
"There's no need for a policy."
"Death to gays"
Cadena explained more about the techniques his
workshop uses to give RAs this preparation. "We
ask them, 'Can you put your own judgments aside
when you have to relate to this person and help
others to be sensitive?' " he said.
During the seminar, new RAs are asked to define
terms like, "dyke," "lesbian" or "queen," in a
process of becoming aware of their own attitudes.
Then they are given hypothetical dorm situations
and asked how they would handle them.
"There are no right answers, but the idea is to
get reactions," Cadena said, explaining this phase.
The result of these planned activities and the discus
sion which they provoke is supposed to be an RA's
increase ability to talk about subjects that are loaded
with emothions and strong opinions for most stu
dents. This ability should help RAs in situations
when they need to lead other students through the
same process.
"In any situation where there's a conflict, the per
son who's uncomfortable has probably never talked
about what it is," Cadena said. He described the
"Openness to Differences" seminar as the best way
to show RAs how to break down the barriers to that
talk.
"It's a difficult area for people to deal with, and
RAs are also young," Cadena admitted. "It's difficult
for them to call people out, to respond assertively to
gay persecution. People come back and say to
them, 'You must be gay.' "
He described one incident that took place several
years ago in a graduate student's dorm. A student
had put a sign on his door that read, "Death to
gays," when a student living down the hall was
known to be gay. "The RA was extremely coura
geous and told the person it was horrible by asking,
'Do you realize what this means?' That person took
a hard line, but the student realized what he had
really been saying and turned around and
apologized," Cadena said.
The increasing occurrence of RA crises like this
one necessitated the shift of Res Ed's focus to ad
dressing gay and lesbian issues more in the seminar.
"It seemed to be really focused on sexuality,"
recalled senior Melissa Fischer, an RAin Alondra
who considers herself as having a "lesbian view
point," which she defined as more than a sexual ori
entation, but also a political and philosophical out
look.
"Homosexuality is something I've thought a lot
about. It was good for me to learn what people who
haven't thought about this were thinking."
She was unhappy at first with the seminar's meth
ods, though. "I didn't even want to do it (the defini
tion activity). The trap you fall on by doing that is
defining stereotypes," she said.
She realized, after participating for a little while,
that the structure of the game got people talking.
"It's better that they've thought about it in the
workshop than gotten received instruction," she
concluded.
A tense debate grew out of this discussion, during
which Fischer said she argued against most of the
others who held that homosexuality by definition re
quired a physical relationship. "It went back and
forth for 10 minutes. There was this tension. I felt
like any minute we d say, 'I've had enough,' " she
said. "Trust built up in the group instead. I
didn't expect that the mainstream people would lis
ten to me."
With the freshmen living in her dorm now, she
avoids preaching quite so strongly on the issues, in
stead asking questions that will get informal debates
started in the hall.
She sees the most common attitude as freshmen
who say, "Yes, it's fine, but my children aren't going
to be homosexual.' "
"If you're going to say it's OK, you have a respon
sibility to make a place for homosexuals," is Fis
cher's reply.
She uses her RA role to educate about the lives of
gays and lesbians.
"Homosexuals today have to inhibit their behav
ior. There's a real tension in your life," she ex
plained. "We should work against those tensions in
the dorms."
"The people who scream the loudest and are of
fended by it the most are thinking about it. I'm
excited by it when they bring it up themselves," she
said of her freshmen. "They're certainly very aware
of my political attitudes and of their word choice
when they're around me; they say 'woman' instead
of 'girl.' I don't kow if they all know (about her les
bian viewpoint), but they certainly presume a lot."
Fischer wanted to be an RA to continue the im
portant influence her freshman year RA had on her
in learning to accept the differences she saw in her
self and in others. Between the freshman and senior
years, she chose to live in Synergy, where the resi
dents share this openness, she said.
Of her roommate experiences, she said, "It's a
great thing to (mix people with different sexual
preferences) because it leads to respect for the indi
vidual and the freedom to let someone else be what
they want to be."
She recounted her personal history to explain
how she developed this attitude. During her fresh
man year, she wasn't woman-identified or actively
seeking the company of women, but this was begin
ning to change.
"It's not heterosexuality that turned me off, but
all the things that went with it," she said. "You have
a boyfriend and you only have one, and there are
certain ways you act. I would enjoy figuring the guy
out and then there was nothing else to it."
"I started to think, Wouldn't it be nice to be in a
relationship where you get back what you're
giving?' " Fischer recalled. She doesn't like to label
herself with the word "lesbian" because for her it in

eludes more than it implies; it is a nurturing attitude
and also a politicial stance.
"When people talk about homosexuals, what they
presume is that 24 hours a day you're having sex,
remarked Fischer with disbelief. Her goal is to use
the system of residential education to at least give
students the opportunity to learn something differ
ent from the accepted stereotypes.
"Dorms aren't all that receptive"
Another longtime Synergy resident, senior Lisa
Rubin, chose to avoid the dorms, and often even
roommates, unless she was sure the people she
would be living with had the type of understanding
Fischer is trying to provide.
"I've had singles because I can only live with
someone who knows me very well, she explained.
"I can't live with someone who isn t comfortable
enough with my relationships not to scurry out of
the room if something is going on."
The roommate she was placed with her freshman
year never suspected what was going on, Rubin
remembered. "No women, I felt, knew me at all.
She started the year in love with her RA, who
was a man. But even while she had this crush, she
knew that other things were going on. By spring
quarter, she'd become involved in a long-lasting les
bian relationship, which she hid from her roommate
by spending most of her time in her lover's dorm.
"I don't think she understood what was going on,"
she said, explaining that her roommate was annoyed
that Rubin spent so much time away without expla
nation.
That summer, Rubin and her lover did what many
homosexual couples do; they lived off campus.
"Dorms aren't all that receptive," she explained.
Rubin joined the Speaker's Bureau to provide res
idential education as much as she could without
having to live in the dorms.
"My room wasn't my room"
For a former Stern freshman, there was no es
caping life in a large dorm with an assigned
roommate, all the things that Rubins avoided.
His roommate was against homosexuality be
cause of fundamentalist religious beliefs, but also
felt that he had no right to censor or restrict an
other's actions.

"I didn't know he even knew for a while," said the
sophomore, who asked that his name be withheld.
His roommate never discussed his sexual prefer
ence with him, making him feel that he should
restrict his behavior to avoid pushing the issue.
So whenever he brought friends over, they made
an effort to sit across the room from each other and
never thought of touching when the roommate was
around.
"My room wasn't my room," he remembered.
"There was something about having to act differ
ently there. Other girlfriends were my roommates.
I felt more comfortable in my best girlfriend's room
than my own."
He said he is much happier this year, living with a
friend who is also gay. "I'm much more comfortable
now not having to deal with those little head trips.
Nudity isn't a problem, which is kind of funny to
assume that just because you have a penis, we (gay
roommates) are just out to jump you."
"Personality is more important than that," he
said, agreeing with Vayle and Page.
His view of his residential education was two
sided. There were opportunities for both growth
and persecution. "For a straight person, it can be
very educational. I know I changed a lot of minds in
the dorm," he recalled. "Or it can be absolute hell.
The problem that I foresee is that I could have very
easily gotten stuck with one of the belligerent
homophobes."
He was positive about the benefits in the end,
though, saying, "You become more sure of yourself
because you have to explain yourself and clarify
your own position, which can be wonderful."
Cadena agreed that the possible outcomes of gay
and straight people living together should be good
most of the time. "There are lots of difficult situa
tions people have to live with, and living with a gay
roommate is probably the easiest thing to deal
with."
- Research assistance by Scott Roth

It's called Residential Education for a reason.
You don't get this education from lectures in the
Tank, but from the people in your own dorm — resi
dent fellows, resident assistants, dormmates and
roommates.
The theory is that you should deal with the frustra
tion of being locked out of your room. You should wade
through piles of someone else's laundry. And
sometimes, you should live with someone whose
sexual preferences are different from your own.
That means that if you're heterosexual, you may
have to redraw the lines of your black and white world
to include an unfamiliar piece of reality, but one that
suddenly has a great influence on your life.

And as a gay man or lesbian, you may have to hide,
defend, or at least explain your everyday emotions to
someone with whom you must then continue to live.
"We (at Res Ed) ask people to do a very difficult
thing, which is to live together in a very small cubicle,"
said Asst. Director of Student Affairs Jim Cadena,
who devises the RA training seminar, "Openness to
Differences," each year. This workshop prepares the
University's front line of support during roommate
crises — the RAs — for some of their most trying situ
ations.
"At the end-of-the-year interview with the RAs, for
a long time their most difficult area involved questions
of race. For the last three years, what's been men
tioned is gay and lesbian issues. We knew we had to do
more in this issue," Cadena said about his decision last
September to focus more on the problems of
homosexual life in the dorms.
Providing this day-long opportunity for new RAs to
explore their reactions to issues of race, gender and
sexual preference and then to discuss how they should
deal with these topics in their dorms is Res Ed's main
way of addressing these issues, too.
Res Ed officials say they don't think an elaborate
policy or detailed restrictions would enhance the
learning that they hope goes on between roommates,
including gay/straight combinations.
"We have no special policy for homosexuals," said

Robin Hensley, program coordinator for Res Ed. "We
work with residential staff if a problem does arise,
talking through fears and anxiety, getting beyond
sexual preference to get to know the person as who
they are."
"There's no need for a policy," Cadena agreed. "It's
really barbaric trying to legislate something like that.
People just need to grow up."
Res Ed's response to students who think they can't
tolerate having a gay or lesbian roommate is a firm re
jection most of the time, however.
This approach follows their overriding policy in such
cases that the experience is meant to be educational,
not easy. Unless the situation proves harmful to one of
the roommate's academic studies, no changes will be
made.
Res Ed won't avoid problems, either, by giving gay
and lesbian students extra consideration in getting

singles. Hensley said he doesn't think it's even a con
sideration. "They're in the same position as far as get
ting a single. This issue would be treated the same as
any other roommate change. It's not treated any differ
ently."
And roommate changes aren't made easily.
"You can't decide you don't want to live with some
one on the first day," Hensley explains. "We went you
to try and work it out, understanding their fears and
not bailing out. It's highly unlikely that sexual prefer
ence would be the sole reason for change."
"Maybe he'd be checking me out"
Sophomore Jens Machatzke, who lives in Storey
House now, said he doesn't agree with this policy. He
found out last year, after drawing into the most sought
after residence on campus, that he would have a gay
roommate, one of the house's returning residents. Un
happy with the idea, he talked to Diana Conklin, direc
tor of the Row.
"I said, i'm paying a lot of money for this school.
What are my options?' " he recalled. "She said I could
work it out within the house. She also said that they
had made exceptions in the past but in my case they
wouldn't. She said that living with gays is part of Resi
dential Education. If that's true, then why don't they
expose everybody to it?"

Machatzke's request was turned down by Res Ed
even after his parents called in their complaints; and no
switches could be made in the house because Mac
hatzke's entering resident status didn't entitle him to
oust any returning residents from their chosen rooms,
according to the house rules.
"I had the choice to get reassigned, but I drew with
six friends. Why should I have to move?" Machatzke
asked, still showing some anger at the way Res Ed
handled his case. "It was very clear to me that this
problem had arisen before. I would have strongly con
sidered moving out and boarding somewhere, but then
I would have lost my guaranteed year."
Machatzke found out when he arrived at school this
year that his assigned roommate had stopped out and
therefore would not be living with him. So the prob
lems he anticipated never occurred, but Machatzke still
has some strong opinions on the issue.
"I never met him. Maybe I should have, but I was
scared," Machatzke admitted. "Res Ed made me feel
wrong for wanting this, though, and said that I should
work it out."
"I have nothing against him except that he's
homosexual," Machatzke said. "My attitude toward
gays is that as long as it doesn't affect me, what they
do is their own business. If you room together, though,
your privileges are shared, and it becomes your busi
ness."
Machatzke points out that Res Ed's policies reflect a
double standard, from his perspective. "Stanford
doesn't allow men and women to room together, and
they're complementing sex preferences just like gays
and straights."
His personal objections followed from this argument.
"If I wanted to change in my room, maybe he'd be
checking me out, maybe he wouldn't. That's the same
reason why there are women's and men's locker
rooms."
After trying to get a satisfactory solution to his com
plaints by working through the system, Machatzke said
he was left disillusioned. "They look down on students
and are condescending, like with the alcohol policy and
the way they treat frats, but then in a situation where
they should be more understanding, they give you this
run-around," he said.
"It just never occurred to me"
This situation at Storey didn't prove to be a problem
for junior Ben Page, who roomed with Machatzke's in
tended roommate last year. He didn't find out about it
before moving in, though.
"He sat me down and told me about three or four
weeks into the quarter," Page recalled, describing his
reaction. "It wasn't something that I'd ever really
thought about. It had just never occurred to me to
wonder if someone's gay."
He wasn't completely neutral about it at first,
though. "I had a sort of instinctive distaste for it, but
that's something I got used to. That doesn't really
carry over to how I would feel about a person."
Page admitted to being a little surprised when he
found out about his roommate's homosexuality, "but
not in a bad way," he said. He attributed his calm reac
tion to the very roommate situation which worried
Machatzke.
"Living with someone, you're more relaxed," Page
explained. "If I had met someone who's gay, I might
have taken it as a big deal."
In his case, residential education took the form of a
new appreciation for a person's individuality. "You
never know until you're in a situation. It could be
someone who turns out fine," Page said. "Sexual pref
erence is a ridiculous basis on which to judge some
one."
The important thing for Page was that, although
they weren't "the best of friends," he and his
roommate got along fine, and he now recommends the
experience for people with feelings like Machatzke's.
"It's too bad if anyone's really uncomfortable with it.
Especially for someone who would think they would be
uncomfortable in a situation like that, it would be good
for them," Page said.
"I could never imagine"
One sophomore who lived in Otero his freshmen
year, asking to be identified only as Jeff, talked about
difficulties he has seen other people have in living with
their roommates.
"I don't think that gay people would want to be put in
a room with other gays, or even with women, but I
personally think that it's important to be put in a room
with an open-minded person," he said. "People should
not worry about their roommate wanting to have a rela
tionship with them. I could never imagine wanting to
have a relationship with someone I'm living with in this
situation."

He did add, though, that occasionally a person will be
attracted to his or her roommate. "I know a guy in
the Suites who is rooming with six to eight guys. They
knew he was gay, but he still has become attracted to
one of the other guys. This usually doesn't happen," he
said.
"It's too easy to go on a soapbox"
Sophomore Daniel Bao's residential education last
year was the experience of coming out to RA Lisa
Naulls and to his freshman year roommate, Eric Vayle.
What he learned about the way people react to fin
ding out he's gay and how he can increase their under
standing helped him when he told sophomore John
Kunstle, his roommate this year and, in an even bigger
step, his parents.
"Usually what happens is that first they don't want to
say anything for fear of insulting you," explained Bao.
"I try to joke about it. Sometimes John (Kunstle) just
forgets and I have to remind him what I'm tallung
about. Then he gets the joke."
Bao said he agrees with Res Ed's idea that students
should learn from the people they live with, and he
takes on the role of teacher himself because he thinks
the more people understand his personality the easier
things will be.
112 "The best way to educate people is to cpme out. It's
too easy to go on a soapbox; people will think you're a
kook. One-on-one is the best way," he concluded.
That conclusion may be the best way, but it wasn't
always the easiest for Bao. He agonized over telling
Vayle during his freshman year, until the Speaker's
Bureau scheduled some of its gay and lesbian members
to talk to Bao's fellow Paloma residents in January.
That gave him the initiative and an excuse to bring it
up.
Bao remembered his anxiety that day when Vayle, in
a bad mood already, started to fill out the Speaker's
Bureau questionnaire that is circulated before the
talks, but left the room after crumpling it up.
"I ran to the trash can the minute he left the room to
see if he had answered the question that asks, 'If your
roommate were gay, would you want him to tell
you?' "said Bao, who then decided just to use the
direct approach.
"He was calmer than I was when I told him," Bao
said, recalling the scene. "1 felt really bad. He was
my freshman roommate. He had no choice. I went in
with the attitude, 'Here's something you should
know.' "
Vayle recounted his version of their conversation in
a separate interview.
"I said, 'Oh.' I was standing up and I sank back on a
chair and said, 'I guess we'll find out now if I'm as
liberal as I say I am.' I'll tell you, that Speaker's Bureau
wasn't as simply educational as it would have been,"
Vayle said, chuckling.
"It was a major event, but it was not a crisis. The
most interesting thing was that he didn't tell me early.
He was so serious," said Vayle, reflecting on his first
reactions.
Like Page's experience in Storey, Bao and Vayle got
to know each other as roommates before they faced
the possible conflict.
Vayle knew Bao well enough by then that he doesn't
remember changing his habits or feeling differently
around his roommate after finding out that he was gay.
"I was the first person he'd ever told. It made me
feel very confident in our friendship that he was placing
not burden but confidence in me," Vayle explained. "It
was harder on him because for me it was all in the
abstract. He wasn't in any relationships."
Vayle didn't have many problems with others who
knew, either, although he said that people did seem to
expect him to be nervous around his roommate.
"People tend to see homosexuals as one-track
people. I knew him as a friend and roommate who hap
pens to be gay," Vayle said to explain the ease of his
adjustment to the news.
He also gave credit to Bao's personality, saying,
"He's one of the most giving people I know, and that
has little to do with his sexual preference."
Vayle's residential education proved a positive ex
perience for him, as he said, "It certainly enlightened
me to the fact that there's just so much more to people
than who they choose to be with."
He could think of only one drawback living with Bao
during the year. "He was a slob," Vayle revealed in a
confidential tone. "That was the only reason I didn't
ask him to be my roommate again."
"It' 9 just an expression"
Kunstle, Bao's current roommate, agreed with both
of Vayle's conclusions, saying, "I'm more concerned
with the type of person I live with, their idiosyncracies,

than whether he's gay. He is kind of a slob, but I lived
with a slob last year."
Kunstle found out five weeks into the year that his
roommate is gay and said his first thought was, 'Wow,
I hope I haven't done anything to offend him."
Bao said this kind of reaction was better than if
Kunstle had said nothing. "The worst kind of response
when you tell someone that you're gay is, 'Oh, that's
nice.' You don't know what the person is feeling."
Now, Kunstle says he's adjusted to the situation by
not really changing at all. "We approach it from all the
basic roommate problems — who's going to clean the
fridge?"
"As far as changing in the room goes, I usually let
him worry about that sort of thing because he's always
dealt with that in men's locker rooms and bathrooms,"
Kunstle explained. "He's had to learn to deal with two
types of males."
After living with a gay roommate, Kunstle said he
can understand the predicament Red Ed officials face,
and he thinks they've handled it as well as they can.
"There is no comparable policy where they put men
and women in the same room and say, 'This is gonna
be educational.' There's no traditional social place for
gays to live, though. They're part way here and part
way there. You can't put them with the girls," Kunstle
reasoned.
He said that no amount of thinking about the interac
tion of gay and straight roommates would have been
the same as actually going through it. "Being in the sit
uation, I learned about my reactions. I watch what I
say. I realize the unconscious stereotypes. You hear
people say, 'That's gay.' It's just an expression, but
habits can be hard to break."
For Bao, these experiences in residential education
gave him the strength to finally confront his mother
with the truth.
"I used this article as a psychological ploy to get
myself to tell them," he said during the interview,
after expressing concern that some of the other
sources hadn't wanted their names printed. He decided
that his comments shouldn't be anonymous.
"Last night I told her," he said. "She said she ex
pected it. She went through the whole spectrum of
reactions very fast. First, she said it was just a phase,
then asked me if I was sure, suggested I see a psychol
ogist, or maybe wait a while to make sure.
"Then she went to the other extreme the morning
after I told her, saying, 'I love you, I really do,' " Bao
recounted with mild surprise at his mother's adap
tability.
Bao considers himself lucky that the reactions from
people who know have been so understanding and that
he's never had any encounters with belligerent people
in public.
He said he's not sure what will happen as a result of
being in a campus publication like this, though. "It
should be interesting to see what my freshman year
dormmates will think. Some of them might not take it
well," he said, choosing his words carefully.
"A lot of times people make a distinction between
the person and the sexual preference," Bao said, hint
ing that this attitude doesn't really allow the gay per
son to be himself, although he understands why it's an
attractive idea. "That way they can be totally negative
on gays and still like the person."
"There's no need for a policy"
Naulls, an RAin Paloma when Bao lived there, and
his friend that year, agreed with his approach. "I tried
to keep an open mind and put myself in the position of
the person coming in and entrusting himself to me,"
she said, recalling that she never really worried about
Bao's adjustment as much as that of the people around
him.
"I had no worries, really, because knowing Daniel, I
know he's a really balanced person and would grow
from it," Naulls said, reflecting on her responsibility as
an RA to the two roommates. "With Eric, I was very
observant. I felt it wasn't my place to tell Eric on my
own, but I would check in and ask how things were
going in general, and he always said that everything
was cool."
Naulls never knew that Bao had come out to his
roommate, because she had never noticed a change in
his behavior at all. "I'm pleasantly surprised," she said.
"Other people in the house would have had definite dif
ficulties with it."
In analyzing the education she got from Res Ed, she
said that most of it took place during the training semi
nar on the differences of race, gender and sexuality. "It
helped me learn how to structure my questions, deal
with touchy subjects," she said.
She didn't use the specific training in talking to Bao
as much as the more open attitude the seminar gave
her. Naulls said she left everything open to him,
asking how he felt about himself coming out and how
he felt about telling others. If there had been prob
lems with Bao's roommate, she said her main action
would have been to help put them both in an empat
hetic state of mind.
"The workshop is enough preparation for these
situation," Naulls said from her experience.
"There's no need for a policy."
"Death to gays"
Cadena explained more about the techniques his
workshop uses to give RAs this preparation. "We
ask them, 'Can you put your own judgments aside
when you have to relate to this person and help
others to be sensitive?' " he said.
During the seminar, new RAs are asked to define
terms like, "dyke," "lesbian" or "queen," in a
process of becoming aware of their own attitudes.
Then they are given hypothetical dorm situations
and asked how they would handle them.
"There are no right answers, but the idea is to
get reactions," Cadena said, explaining this phase.
The result of these planned activities and the discus
sion which they provoke is supposed to be an RA's
increase ability to talk about subjects that are loaded
with emothions and strong opinions for most stu
dents. This ability should help RAs in situations
when they need to lead other students through the
same process.
"In any situation where there's a conflict, the per
son who's uncomfortable has probably never talked
about what it is," Cadena said. He described the
"Openness to Differences" seminar as the best way
to show RAs how to break down the barriers to that
talk.
"It's a difficult area for people to deal with, and
RAs are also young," Cadena admitted. "It's difficult
for them to call people out, to respond assertively to
gay persecution. People come back and say to
them, 'You must be gay.' "
He described one incident that took place several
years ago in a graduate student's dorm. A student
had put a sign on his door that read, "Death to
gays," when a student living down the hall was
known to be gay. "The RA was extremely coura
geous and told the person it was horrible by asking,
'Do you realize what this means?' That person took
a hard line, but the student realized what he had
really been saying and turned around and
apologized," Cadena said.
The increasing occurrence of RA crises like this
one necessitated the shift of Res Ed's focus to ad
dressing gay and lesbian issues more in the seminar.
"It seemed to be really focused on sexuality,"
recalled senior Melissa Fischer, an RAin Alondra
who considers herself as having a "lesbian view
point," which she defined as more than a sexual ori
entation, but also a political and philosophical out
look.
"Homosexuality is something I've thought a lot
about. It was good for me to learn what people who
haven't thought about this were thinking."
She was unhappy at first with the seminar's meth
ods, though. "I didn't even want to do it (the defini
tion activity). The trap you fall on by doing that is
defining stereotypes," she said.
She realized, after participating for a little while,
that the structure of the game got people talking.
"It's better that they've thought about it in the
workshop than gotten received instruction," she
concluded.
A tense debate grew out of this discussion, during
which Fischer said she argued against most of the
others who held that homosexuality by definition re
quired a physical relationship. "It went back and
forth for 10 minutes. There was this tension. I felt
like any minute we d say, 'I've had enough,' " she
said. "Trust built up in the group instead. I
didn't expect that the mainstream people would lis
ten to me."
With the freshmen living in her dorm now, she
avoids preaching quite so strongly on the issues, in
stead asking questions that will get informal debates
started in the hall.
She sees the most common attitude as freshmen
who say, "Yes, it's fine, but my children aren't going
to be homosexual.' "
"If you're going to say it's OK, you have a respon
sibility to make a place for homosexuals," is Fis
cher's reply.
She uses her RA role to educate about the lives of
gays and lesbians.
"Homosexuals today have to inhibit their behav
ior. There's a real tension in your life," she ex
plained. "We should work against those tensions in
the dorms."
"The people who scream the loudest and are of
fended by it the most are thinking about it. I'm
excited by it when they bring it up themselves," she
said of her freshmen. "They're certainly very aware
of my political attitudes and of their word choice
when they're around me; they say 'woman' instead
of 'girl.' I don't kow if they all know (about her les
bian viewpoint), but they certainly presume a lot."
Fischer wanted to be an RA to continue the im
portant influence her freshman year RA had on her
in learning to accept the differences she saw in her
self and in others. Between the freshman and senior
years, she chose to live in Synergy, where the resi
dents share this openness, she said.
Of her roommate experiences, she said, "It's a
great thing to (mix people with different sexual
preferences) because it leads to respect for the indi
vidual and the freedom to let someone else be what
they want to be."
She recounted her personal history to explain
how she developed this attitude. During her fresh
man year, she wasn't woman-identified or actively
seeking the company of women, but this was begin
ning to change.
"It's not heterosexuality that turned me off, but
all the things that went with it," she said. "You have
a boyfriend and you only have one, and there are
certain ways you act. I would enjoy figuring the guy
out and then there was nothing else to it."
"I started to think, Wouldn't it be nice to be in a
relationship where you get back what you're
giving?' " Fischer recalled. She doesn't like to label
herself with the word "lesbian" because for her it in

eludes more than it implies; it is a nurturing attitude
and also a politicial stance.
"When people talk about homosexuals, what they
presume is that 24 hours a day you're having sex,
remarked Fischer with disbelief. Her goal is to use
the system of residential education to at least give
students the opportunity to learn something differ
ent from the accepted stereotypes.
"Dorms aren't all that receptive"
Another longtime Synergy resident, senior Lisa
Rubin, chose to avoid the dorms, and often even
roommates, unless she was sure the people she
would be living with had the type of understanding
Fischer is trying to provide.
"I've had singles because I can only live with
someone who knows me very well, she explained.
"I can't live with someone who isn t comfortable
enough with my relationships not to scurry out of
the room if something is going on."
The roommate she was placed with her freshman
year never suspected what was going on, Rubin
remembered. "No women, I felt, knew me at all.
She started the year in love with her RA, who
was a man. But even while she had this crush, she
knew that other things were going on. By spring
quarter, she'd become involved in a long-lasting les
bian relationship, which she hid from her roommate
by spending most of her time in her lover's dorm.
"I don't think she understood what was going on,"
she said, explaining that her roommate was annoyed
that Rubin spent so much time away without expla
nation.
That summer, Rubin and her lover did what many
homosexual couples do; they lived off campus.
"Dorms aren't all that receptive," she explained.
Rubin joined the Speaker's Bureau to provide res
idential education as much as she could without
having to live in the dorms.
"My room wasn't my room"
For a former Stern freshman, there was no es
caping life in a large dorm with an assigned
roommate, all the things that Rubins avoided.
His roommate was against homosexuality be
cause of fundamentalist religious beliefs, but also
felt that he had no right to censor or restrict an
other's actions.

"I didn't know he even knew for a while," said the
sophomore, who asked that his name be withheld.
His roommate never discussed his sexual prefer
ence with him, making him feel that he should
restrict his behavior to avoid pushing the issue.
So whenever he brought friends over, they made
an effort to sit across the room from each other and
never thought of touching when the roommate was
around.
"My room wasn't my room," he remembered.
"There was something about having to act differ
ently there. Other girlfriends were my roommates.
I felt more comfortable in my best girlfriend's room
than my own."
He said he is much happier this year, living with a
friend who is also gay. "I'm much more comfortable
now not having to deal with those little head trips.
Nudity isn't a problem, which is kind of funny to
assume that just because you have a penis, we (gay
roommates) are just out to jump you."
"Personality is more important than that," he
said, agreeing with Vayle and Page.
His view of his residential education was two
sided. There were opportunities for both growth
and persecution. "For a straight person, it can be
very educational. I know I changed a lot of minds in
the dorm," he recalled. "Or it can be absolute hell.
The problem that I foresee is that I could have very
easily gotten stuck with one of the belligerent
homophobes."
He was positive about the benefits in the end,
though, saying, "You become more sure of yourself
because you have to explain yourself and clarify
your own position, which can be wonderful."
Cadena agreed that the possible outcomes of gay
and straight people living together should be good
most of the time. "There are lots of difficult situa
tions people have to live with, and living with a gay
roommate is probably the easiest thing to deal
with."
- Research assistance by Scott Roth

It's called Residential Education for a reason.
You don't get this education from lectures in the
Tank, but from the people in your own dorm — resi
dent fellows, resident assistants, dormmates and
roommates.
The theory is that you should deal with the frustra
tion of being locked out of your room. You should wade
through piles of someone else's laundry. And
sometimes, you should live with someone whose
sexual preferences are different from your own.
That means that if you're heterosexual, you may
have to redraw the lines of your black and white world
to include an unfamiliar piece of reality, but one that
suddenly has a great influence on your life.

And as a gay man or lesbian, you may have to hide,
defend, or at least explain your everyday emotions to
someone with whom you must then continue to live.
"We (at Res Ed) ask people to do a very difficult
thing, which is to live together in a very small cubicle,"
said Asst. Director of Student Affairs Jim Cadena,
who devises the RA training seminar, "Openness to
Differences," each year. This workshop prepares the
University's front line of support during roommate
crises — the RAs — for some of their most trying situ
ations.
"At the end-of-the-year interview with the RAs, for
a long time their most difficult area involved questions
of race. For the last three years, what's been men
tioned is gay and lesbian issues. We knew we had to do
more in this issue," Cadena said about his decision last
September to focus more on the problems of
homosexual life in the dorms.
Providing this day-long opportunity for new RAs to
explore their reactions to issues of race, gender and
sexual preference and then to discuss how they should
deal with these topics in their dorms is Res Ed's main
way of addressing these issues, too.
Res Ed officials say they don't think an elaborate
policy or detailed restrictions would enhance the
learning that they hope goes on between roommates,
including gay/straight combinations.
"We have no special policy for homosexuals," said

Robin Hensley, program coordinator for Res Ed. "We
work with residential staff if a problem does arise,
talking through fears and anxiety, getting beyond
sexual preference to get to know the person as who
they are."
"There's no need for a policy," Cadena agreed. "It's
really barbaric trying to legislate something like that.
People just need to grow up."
Res Ed's response to students who think they can't
tolerate having a gay or lesbian roommate is a firm re
jection most of the time, however.
This approach follows their overriding policy in such
cases that the experience is meant to be educational,
not easy. Unless the situation proves harmful to one of
the roommate's academic studies, no changes will be
made.
Res Ed won't avoid problems, either, by giving gay
and lesbian students extra consideration in getting

singles. Hensley said he doesn't think it's even a con
sideration. "They're in the same position as far as get
ting a single. This issue would be treated the same as
any other roommate change. It's not treated any differ
ently."
And roommate changes aren't made easily.
"You can't decide you don't want to live with some
one on the first day," Hensley explains. "We went you
to try and work it out, understanding their fears and
not bailing out. It's highly unlikely that sexual prefer
ence would be the sole reason for change."
"Maybe he'd be checking me out"
Sophomore Jens Machatzke, who lives in Storey
House now, said he doesn't agree with this policy. He
found out last year, after drawing into the most sought
after residence on campus, that he would have a gay
roommate, one of the house's returning residents. Un
happy with the idea, he talked to Diana Conklin, direc
tor of the Row.
"I said, i'm paying a lot of money for this school.
What are my options?' " he recalled. "She said I could
work it out within the house. She also said that they
had made exceptions in the past but in my case they
wouldn't. She said that living with gays is part of Resi
dential Education. If that's true, then why don't they
expose everybody to it?"

Machatzke's request was turned down by Res Ed
even after his parents called in their complaints; and no
switches could be made in the house because Mac
hatzke's entering resident status didn't entitle him to
oust any returning residents from their chosen rooms,
according to the house rules.
"I had the choice to get reassigned, but I drew with
six friends. Why should I have to move?" Machatzke
asked, still showing some anger at the way Res Ed
handled his case. "It was very clear to me that this
problem had arisen before. I would have strongly con
sidered moving out and boarding somewhere, but then
I would have lost my guaranteed year."
Machatzke found out when he arrived at school this
year that his assigned roommate had stopped out and
therefore would not be living with him. So the prob
lems he anticipated never occurred, but Machatzke still
has some strong opinions on the issue.
"I never met him. Maybe I should have, but I was
scared," Machatzke admitted. "Res Ed made me feel
wrong for wanting this, though, and said that I should
work it out."
"I have nothing against him except that he's
homosexual," Machatzke said. "My attitude toward
gays is that as long as it doesn't affect me, what they
do is their own business. If you room together, though,
your privileges are shared, and it becomes your busi
ness."
Machatzke points out that Res Ed's policies reflect a
double standard, from his perspective. "Stanford
doesn't allow men and women to room together, and
they're complementing sex preferences just like gays
and straights."
His personal objections followed from this argument.
"If I wanted to change in my room, maybe he'd be
checking me out, maybe he wouldn't. That's the same
reason why there are women's and men's locker
rooms."
After trying to get a satisfactory solution to his com
plaints by working through the system, Machatzke said
he was left disillusioned. "They look down on students
and are condescending, like with the alcohol policy and
the way they treat frats, but then in a situation where
they should be more understanding, they give you this
run-around," he said.
"It just never occurred to me"
This situation at Storey didn't prove to be a problem
for junior Ben Page, who roomed with Machatzke's in
tended roommate last year. He didn't find out about it
before moving in, though.
"He sat me down and told me about three or four
weeks into the quarter," Page recalled, describing his
reaction. "It wasn't something that I'd ever really
thought about. It had just never occurred to me to
wonder if someone's gay."
He wasn't completely neutral about it at first,
though. "I had a sort of instinctive distaste for it, but
that's something I got used to. That doesn't really
carry over to how I would feel about a person."
Page admitted to being a little surprised when he
found out about his roommate's homosexuality, "but
not in a bad way," he said. He attributed his calm reac
tion to the very roommate situation which worried
Machatzke.
"Living with someone, you're more relaxed," Page
explained. "If I had met someone who's gay, I might
have taken it as a big deal."
In his case, residential education took the form of a
new appreciation for a person's individuality. "You
never know until you're in a situation. It could be
someone who turns out fine," Page said. "Sexual pref
erence is a ridiculous basis on which to judge some
one."
The important thing for Page was that, although
they weren't "the best of friends," he and his
roommate got along fine, and he now recommends the
experience for people with feelings like Machatzke's.
"It's too bad if anyone's really uncomfortable with it.
Especially for someone who would think they would be
uncomfortable in a situation like that, it would be good
for them," Page said.
"I could never imagine"
One sophomore who lived in Otero his freshmen
year, asking to be identified only as Jeff, talked about
difficulties he has seen other people have in living with
their roommates.
"I don't think that gay people would want to be put in
a room with other gays, or even with women, but I
personally think that it's important to be put in a room
with an open-minded person," he said. "People should
not worry about their roommate wanting to have a rela
tionship with them. I could never imagine wanting to
have a relationship with someone I'm living with in this
situation."

He did add, though, that occasionally a person will be
attracted to his or her roommate. "I know a guy in
the Suites who is rooming with six to eight guys. They
knew he was gay, but he still has become attracted to
one of the other guys. This usually doesn't happen," he
said.
"It's too easy to go on a soapbox"
Sophomore Daniel Bao's residential education last
year was the experience of coming out to RA Lisa
Naulls and to his freshman year roommate, Eric Vayle.
What he learned about the way people react to fin
ding out he's gay and how he can increase their under
standing helped him when he told sophomore John
Kunstle, his roommate this year and, in an even bigger
step, his parents.
"Usually what happens is that first they don't want to
say anything for fear of insulting you," explained Bao.
"I try to joke about it. Sometimes John (Kunstle) just
forgets and I have to remind him what I'm tallung
about. Then he gets the joke."
Bao said he agrees with Res Ed's idea that students
should learn from the people they live with, and he
takes on the role of teacher himself because he thinks
the more people understand his personality the easier
things will be.
112 "The best way to educate people is to cpme out. It's
too easy to go on a soapbox; people will think you're a
kook. One-on-one is the best way," he concluded.
That conclusion may be the best way, but it wasn't
always the easiest for Bao. He agonized over telling
Vayle during his freshman year, until the Speaker's
Bureau scheduled some of its gay and lesbian members
to talk to Bao's fellow Paloma residents in January.
That gave him the initiative and an excuse to bring it
up.
Bao remembered his anxiety that day when Vayle, in
a bad mood already, started to fill out the Speaker's
Bureau questionnaire that is circulated before the
talks, but left the room after crumpling it up.
"I ran to the trash can the minute he left the room to
see if he had answered the question that asks, 'If your
roommate were gay, would you want him to tell
you?' "said Bao, who then decided just to use the
direct approach.
"He was calmer than I was when I told him," Bao
said, recalling the scene. "1 felt really bad. He was
my freshman roommate. He had no choice. I went in
with the attitude, 'Here's something you should
know.' "
Vayle recounted his version of their conversation in
a separate interview.
"I said, 'Oh.' I was standing up and I sank back on a
chair and said, 'I guess we'll find out now if I'm as
liberal as I say I am.' I'll tell you, that Speaker's Bureau
wasn't as simply educational as it would have been,"
Vayle said, chuckling.
"It was a major event, but it was not a crisis. The
most interesting thing was that he didn't tell me early.
He was so serious," said Vayle, reflecting on his first
reactions.
Like Page's experience in Storey, Bao and Vayle got
to know each other as roommates before they faced
the possible conflict.
Vayle knew Bao well enough by then that he doesn't
remember changing his habits or feeling differently
around his roommate after finding out that he was gay.
"I was the first person he'd ever told. It made me
feel very confident in our friendship that he was placing
not burden but confidence in me," Vayle explained. "It
was harder on him because for me it was all in the
abstract. He wasn't in any relationships."
Vayle didn't have many problems with others who
knew, either, although he said that people did seem to
expect him to be nervous around his roommate.
"People tend to see homosexuals as one-track
people. I knew him as a friend and roommate who hap
pens to be gay," Vayle said to explain the ease of his
adjustment to the news.
He also gave credit to Bao's personality, saying,
"He's one of the most giving people I know, and that
has little to do with his sexual preference."
Vayle's residential education proved a positive ex
perience for him, as he said, "It certainly enlightened
me to the fact that there's just so much more to people
than who they choose to be with."
He could think of only one drawback living with Bao
during the year. "He was a slob," Vayle revealed in a
confidential tone. "That was the only reason I didn't
ask him to be my roommate again."
"It' 9 just an expression"
Kunstle, Bao's current roommate, agreed with both
of Vayle's conclusions, saying, "I'm more concerned
with the type of person I live with, their idiosyncracies,

than whether he's gay. He is kind of a slob, but I lived
with a slob last year."
Kunstle found out five weeks into the year that his
roommate is gay and said his first thought was, 'Wow,
I hope I haven't done anything to offend him."
Bao said this kind of reaction was better than if
Kunstle had said nothing. "The worst kind of response
when you tell someone that you're gay is, 'Oh, that's
nice.' You don't know what the person is feeling."
Now, Kunstle says he's adjusted to the situation by
not really changing at all. "We approach it from all the
basic roommate problems — who's going to clean the
fridge?"
"As far as changing in the room goes, I usually let
him worry about that sort of thing because he's always
dealt with that in men's locker rooms and bathrooms,"
Kunstle explained. "He's had to learn to deal with two
types of males."
After living with a gay roommate, Kunstle said he
can understand the predicament Red Ed officials face,
and he thinks they've handled it as well as they can.
"There is no comparable policy where they put men
and women in the same room and say, 'This is gonna
be educational.' There's no traditional social place for
gays to live, though. They're part way here and part
way there. You can't put them with the girls," Kunstle
reasoned.
He said that no amount of thinking about the interac
tion of gay and straight roommates would have been
the same as actually going through it. "Being in the sit
uation, I learned about my reactions. I watch what I
say. I realize the unconscious stereotypes. You hear
people say, 'That's gay.' It's just an expression, but
habits can be hard to break."
For Bao, these experiences in residential education
gave him the strength to finally confront his mother
with the truth.
"I used this article as a psychological ploy to get
myself to tell them," he said during the interview,
after expressing concern that some of the other
sources hadn't wanted their names printed. He decided
that his comments shouldn't be anonymous.
"Last night I told her," he said. "She said she ex
pected it. She went through the whole spectrum of
reactions very fast. First, she said it was just a phase,
then asked me if I was sure, suggested I see a psychol
ogist, or maybe wait a while to make sure.
"Then she went to the other extreme the morning
after I told her, saying, 'I love you, I really do,' " Bao
recounted with mild surprise at his mother's adap
tability.
Bao considers himself lucky that the reactions from
people who know have been so understanding and that
he's never had any encounters with belligerent people
in public.
He said he's not sure what will happen as a result of
being in a campus publication like this, though. "It
should be interesting to see what my freshman year
dormmates will think. Some of them might not take it
well," he said, choosing his words carefully.
"A lot of times people make a distinction between
the person and the sexual preference," Bao said, hint
ing that this attitude doesn't really allow the gay per
son to be himself, although he understands why it's an
attractive idea. "That way they can be totally negative
on gays and still like the person."
"There's no need for a policy"
Naulls, an RAin Paloma when Bao lived there, and
his friend that year, agreed with his approach. "I tried
to keep an open mind and put myself in the position of
the person coming in and entrusting himself to me,"
she said, recalling that she never really worried about
Bao's adjustment as much as that of the people around
him.
"I had no worries, really, because knowing Daniel, I
know he's a really balanced person and would grow
from it," Naulls said, reflecting on her responsibility as
an RA to the two roommates. "With Eric, I was very
observant. I felt it wasn't my place to tell Eric on my
own, but I would check in and ask how things were
going in general, and he always said that everything
was cool."
Naulls never knew that Bao had come out to his
roommate, because she had never noticed a change in
his behavior at all. "I'm pleasantly surprised," she said.
"Other people in the house would have had definite dif
ficulties with it."
In analyzing the education she got from Res Ed, she
said that most of it took place during the training semi
nar on the differences of race, gender and sexuality. "It
helped me learn how to structure my questions, deal
with touchy subjects," she said.
She didn't use the specific training in talking to Bao
as much as the more open attitude the seminar gave
her. Naulls said she left everything open to him,
asking how he felt about himself coming out and how
he felt about telling others. If there had been prob
lems with Bao's roommate, she said her main action
would have been to help put them both in an empat
hetic state of mind.
"The workshop is enough preparation for these
situation," Naulls said from her experience.
"There's no need for a policy."
"Death to gays"
Cadena explained more about the techniques his
workshop uses to give RAs this preparation. "We
ask them, 'Can you put your own judgments aside
when you have to relate to this person and help
others to be sensitive?' " he said.
During the seminar, new RAs are asked to define
terms like, "dyke," "lesbian" or "queen," in a
process of becoming aware of their own attitudes.
Then they are given hypothetical dorm situations
and asked how they would handle them.
"There are no right answers, but the idea is to
get reactions," Cadena said, explaining this phase.
The result of these planned activities and the discus
sion which they provoke is supposed to be an RA's
increase ability to talk about subjects that are loaded
with emothions and strong opinions for most stu
dents. This ability should help RAs in situations
when they need to lead other students through the
same process.
"In any situation where there's a conflict, the per
son who's uncomfortable has probably never talked
about what it is," Cadena said. He described the
"Openness to Differences" seminar as the best way
to show RAs how to break down the barriers to that
talk.
"It's a difficult area for people to deal with, and
RAs are also young," Cadena admitted. "It's difficult
for them to call people out, to respond assertively to
gay persecution. People come back and say to
them, 'You must be gay.' "
He described one incident that took place several
years ago in a graduate student's dorm. A student
had put a sign on his door that read, "Death to
gays," when a student living down the hall was
known to be gay. "The RA was extremely coura
geous and told the person it was horrible by asking,
'Do you realize what this means?' That person took
a hard line, but the student realized what he had
really been saying and turned around and
apologized," Cadena said.
The increasing occurrence of RA crises like this
one necessitated the shift of Res Ed's focus to ad
dressing gay and lesbian issues more in the seminar.
"It seemed to be really focused on sexuality,"
recalled senior Melissa Fischer, an RAin Alondra
who considers herself as having a "lesbian view
point," which she defined as more than a sexual ori
entation, but also a political and philosophical out
look.
"Homosexuality is something I've thought a lot
about. It was good for me to learn what people who
haven't thought about this were thinking."
She was unhappy at first with the seminar's meth
ods, though. "I didn't even want to do it (the defini
tion activity). The trap you fall on by doing that is
defining stereotypes," she said.
She realized, after participating for a little while,
that the structure of the game got people talking.
"It's better that they've thought about it in the
workshop than gotten received instruction," she
concluded.
A tense debate grew out of this discussion, during
which Fischer said she argued against most of the
others who held that homosexuality by definition re
quired a physical relationship. "It went back and
forth for 10 minutes. There was this tension. I felt
like any minute we d say, 'I've had enough,' " she
said. "Trust built up in the group instead. I
didn't expect that the mainstream people would lis
ten to me."
With the freshmen living in her dorm now, she
avoids preaching quite so strongly on the issues, in
stead asking questions that will get informal debates
started in the hall.
She sees the most common attitude as freshmen
who say, "Yes, it's fine, but my children aren't going
to be homosexual.' "
"If you're going to say it's OK, you have a respon
sibility to make a place for homosexuals," is Fis
cher's reply.
She uses her RA role to educate about the lives of
gays and lesbians.
"Homosexuals today have to inhibit their behav
ior. There's a real tension in your life," she ex
plained. "We should work against those tensions in
the dorms."
"The people who scream the loudest and are of
fended by it the most are thinking about it. I'm
excited by it when they bring it up themselves," she
said of her freshmen. "They're certainly very aware
of my political attitudes and of their word choice
when they're around me; they say 'woman' instead
of 'girl.' I don't kow if they all know (about her les
bian viewpoint), but they certainly presume a lot."
Fischer wanted to be an RA to continue the im
portant influence her freshman year RA had on her
in learning to accept the differences she saw in her
self and in others. Between the freshman and senior
years, she chose to live in Synergy, where the resi
dents share this openness, she said.
Of her roommate experiences, she said, "It's a
great thing to (mix people with different sexual
preferences) because it leads to respect for the indi
vidual and the freedom to let someone else be what
they want to be."
She recounted her personal history to explain
how she developed this attitude. During her fresh
man year, she wasn't woman-identified or actively
seeking the company of women, but this was begin
ning to change.
"It's not heterosexuality that turned me off, but
all the things that went with it," she said. "You have
a boyfriend and you only have one, and there are
certain ways you act. I would enjoy figuring the guy
out and then there was nothing else to it."
"I started to think, Wouldn't it be nice to be in a
relationship where you get back what you're
giving?' " Fischer recalled. She doesn't like to label
herself with the word "lesbian" because for her it in

eludes more than it implies; it is a nurturing attitude
and also a politicial stance.
"When people talk about homosexuals, what they
presume is that 24 hours a day you're having sex,
remarked Fischer with disbelief. Her goal is to use
the system of residential education to at least give
students the opportunity to learn something differ
ent from the accepted stereotypes.
"Dorms aren't all that receptive"
Another longtime Synergy resident, senior Lisa
Rubin, chose to avoid the dorms, and often even
roommates, unless she was sure the people she
would be living with had the type of understanding
Fischer is trying to provide.
"I've had singles because I can only live with
someone who knows me very well, she explained.
"I can't live with someone who isn t comfortable
enough with my relationships not to scurry out of
the room if something is going on."
The roommate she was placed with her freshman
year never suspected what was going on, Rubin
remembered. "No women, I felt, knew me at all.
She started the year in love with her RA, who
was a man. But even while she had this crush, she
knew that other things were going on. By spring
quarter, she'd become involved in a long-lasting les
bian relationship, which she hid from her roommate
by spending most of her time in her lover's dorm.
"I don't think she understood what was going on,"
she said, explaining that her roommate was annoyed
that Rubin spent so much time away without expla
nation.
That summer, Rubin and her lover did what many
homosexual couples do; they lived off campus.
"Dorms aren't all that receptive," she explained.
Rubin joined the Speaker's Bureau to provide res
idential education as much as she could without
having to live in the dorms.
"My room wasn't my room"
For a former Stern freshman, there was no es
caping life in a large dorm with an assigned
roommate, all the things that Rubins avoided.
His roommate was against homosexuality be
cause of fundamentalist religious beliefs, but also
felt that he had no right to censor or restrict an
other's actions.

"I didn't know he even knew for a while," said the
sophomore, who asked that his name be withheld.
His roommate never discussed his sexual prefer
ence with him, making him feel that he should
restrict his behavior to avoid pushing the issue.
So whenever he brought friends over, they made
an effort to sit across the room from each other and
never thought of touching when the roommate was
around.
"My room wasn't my room," he remembered.
"There was something about having to act differ
ently there. Other girlfriends were my roommates.
I felt more comfortable in my best girlfriend's room
than my own."
He said he is much happier this year, living with a
friend who is also gay. "I'm much more comfortable
now not having to deal with those little head trips.
Nudity isn't a problem, which is kind of funny to
assume that just because you have a penis, we (gay
roommates) are just out to jump you."
"Personality is more important than that," he
said, agreeing with Vayle and Page.
His view of his residential education was two
sided. There were opportunities for both growth
and persecution. "For a straight person, it can be
very educational. I know I changed a lot of minds in
the dorm," he recalled. "Or it can be absolute hell.
The problem that I foresee is that I could have very
easily gotten stuck with one of the belligerent
homophobes."
He was positive about the benefits in the end,
though, saying, "You become more sure of yourself
because you have to explain yourself and clarify
your own position, which can be wonderful."
Cadena agreed that the possible outcomes of gay
and straight people living together should be good
most of the time. "There are lots of difficult situa
tions people have to live with, and living with a gay
roommate is probably the easiest thing to deal
with."

It's called Residential Education for a reason.
You don't get this education from lectures in the
Tank, but from the people in your own dorm — resi
dent fellows, resident assistants, dormmates and
roommates.
The theory is that you should deal with the frustra
tion of being locked out of your room. You should wade
through piles of someone else's laundry. And
sometimes, you should live with someone whose
sexual preferences are different from your own.
That means that if you're heterosexual, you may
have to redraw the lines of your black and white world
to include an unfamiliar piece of reality, but one that
suddenly has a great influence on your life.

And as a gay man or lesbian, you may have to hide,
defend, or at least explain your everyday emotions to
someone with whom you must then continue to live.
"We (at Res Ed) ask people to do a very difficult
thing, which is to live together in a very small cubicle,"
said Asst. Director of Student Affairs Jim Cadena,
who devises the RA training seminar, "Openness to
Differences," each year. This workshop prepares the
University's front line of support during roommate
crises — the RAs — for some of their most trying situ
ations.
"At the end-of-the-year interview with the RAs, for
a long time their most difficult area involved questions
of race. For the last three years, what's been men
tioned is gay and lesbian issues. We knew we had to do
more in this issue," Cadena said about his decision last
September to focus more on the problems of
homosexual life in the dorms.
Providing this day-long opportunity for new RAs to
explore their reactions to issues of race, gender and
sexual preference and then to discuss how they should
deal with these topics in their dorms is Res Ed's main
way of addressing these issues, too.
Res Ed officials say they don't think an elaborate
policy or detailed restrictions would enhance the
learning that they hope goes on between roommates,
including gay/straight combinations.
"We have no special policy for homosexuals," said

Robin Hensley, program coordinator for Res Ed. "We
work with residential staff if a problem does arise,
talking through fears and anxiety, getting beyond
sexual preference to get to know the person as who
they are."
"There's no need for a policy," Cadena agreed. "It's
really barbaric trying to legislate something like that.
People just need to grow up."
Res Ed's response to students who think they can't
tolerate having a gay or lesbian roommate is a firm re
jection most of the time, however.
This approach follows their overriding policy in such
cases that the experience is meant to be educational,
not easy. Unless the situation proves harmful to one of
the roommate's academic studies, no changes will be
made.
Res Ed won't avoid problems, either, by giving gay
and lesbian students extra consideration in getting

singles. Hensley said he doesn't think it's even a con
sideration. "They're in the same position as far as get
ting a single. This issue would be treated the same as
any other roommate change. It's not treated any differ
ently."
And roommate changes aren't made easily.
"You can't decide you don't want to live with some
one on the first day," Hensley explains. "We went you
to try and work it out, understanding their fears and
not bailing out. It's highly unlikely that sexual prefer
ence would be the sole reason for change."
"Maybe he'd be checking me out"
Sophomore Jens Machatzke, who lives in Storey
House now, said he doesn't agree with this policy. He
found out last year, after drawing into the most sought
after residence on campus, that he would have a gay
roommate, one of the house's returning residents. Un
happy with the idea, he talked to Diana Conklin, direc
tor of the Row.
"I said, i'm paying a lot of money for this school.
What are my options?' " he recalled. "She said I could
work it out within the house. She also said that they
had made exceptions in the past but in my case they
wouldn't. She said that living with gays is part of Resi
dential Education. If that's true, then why don't they
expose everybody to it?"

Machatzke's request was turned down by Res Ed
even after his parents called in their complaints; and no
switches could be made in the house because Mac
hatzke's entering resident status didn't entitle him to
oust any returning residents from their chosen rooms,
according to the house rules.
"I had the choice to get reassigned, but I drew with
six friends. Why should I have to move?" Machatzke
asked, still showing some anger at the way Res Ed
handled his case. "It was very clear to me that this
problem had arisen before. I would have strongly con
sidered moving out and boarding somewhere, but then
I would have lost my guaranteed year."
Machatzke found out when he arrived at school this
year that his assigned roommate had stopped out and
therefore would not be living with him. So the prob
lems he anticipated never occurred, but Machatzke still
has some strong opinions on the issue.
"I never met him. Maybe I should have, but I was
scared," Machatzke admitted. "Res Ed made me feel
wrong for wanting this, though, and said that I should
work it out."
"I have nothing against him except that he's
homosexual," Machatzke said. "My attitude toward
gays is that as long as it doesn't affect me, what they
do is their own business. If you room together, though,
your privileges are shared, and it becomes your busi
ness."
Machatzke points out that Res Ed's policies reflect a
double standard, from his perspective. "Stanford
doesn't allow men and women to room together, and
they're complementing sex preferences just like gays
and straights."
His personal objections followed from this argument.
"If I wanted to change in my room, maybe he'd be
checking me out, maybe he wouldn't. That's the same
reason why there are women's and men's locker
rooms."
After trying to get a satisfactory solution to his com
plaints by working through the system, Machatzke said
he was left disillusioned. "They look down on students
and are condescending, like with the alcohol policy and
the way they treat frats, but then in a situation where
they should be more understanding, they give you this
run-around," he said.
"It just never occurred to me"
This situation at Storey didn't prove to be a problem
for junior Ben Page, who roomed with Machatzke's in
tended roommate last year. He didn't find out about it
before moving in, though.
"He sat me down and told me about three or four
weeks into the quarter," Page recalled, describing his
reaction. "It wasn't something that I'd ever really
thought about. It had just never occurred to me to
wonder if someone's gay."
He wasn't completely neutral about it at first,
though. "I had a sort of instinctive distaste for it, but
that's something I got used to. That doesn't really
carry over to how I would feel about a person."
Page admitted to being a little surprised when he
found out about his roommate's homosexuality, "but
not in a bad way," he said. He attributed his calm reac
tion to the very roommate situation which worried
Machatzke.
"Living with someone, you're more relaxed," Page
explained. "If I had met someone who's gay, I might
have taken it as a big deal."
In his case, residential education took the form of a
new appreciation for a person's individuality. "You
never know until you're in a situation. It could be
someone who turns out fine," Page said. "Sexual pref
erence is a ridiculous basis on which to judge some
one."
The important thing for Page was that, although
they weren't "the best of friends," he and his
roommate got along fine, and he now recommends the
experience for people with feelings like Machatzke's.
"It's too bad if anyone's really uncomfortable with it.
Especially for someone who would think they would be
uncomfortable in a situation like that, it would be good
for them," Page said.
"I could never imagine"
One sophomore who lived in Otero his freshmen
year, asking to be identified only as Jeff, talked about
difficulties he has seen other people have in living with
their roommates.
"I don't think that gay people would want to be put in
a room with other gays, or even with women, but I
personally think that it's important to be put in a room
with an open-minded person," he said. "People should
not worry about their roommate wanting to have a rela
tionship with them. I could never imagine wanting to
have a relationship with someone I'm living with in this
situation."

He did add, though, that occasionally a person will be
attracted to his or her roommate. "I know a guy in
the Suites who is rooming with six to eight guys. They
knew he was gay, but he still has become attracted to
one of the other guys. This usually doesn't happen," he
said.
"It's too easy to go on a soapbox"
Sophomore Daniel Bao's residential education last
year was the experience of coming out to RA Lisa
Naulls and to his freshman year roommate, Eric Vayle.
What he learned about the way people react to fin
ding out he's gay and how he can increase their under
standing helped him when he told sophomore John
Kunstle, his roommate this year and, in an even bigger
step, his parents.
"Usually what happens is that first they don't want to
say anything for fear of insulting you," explained Bao.
"I try to joke about it. Sometimes John (Kunstle) just
forgets and I have to remind him what I'm tallung
about. Then he gets the joke."
Bao said he agrees with Res Ed's idea that students
should learn from the people they live with, and he
takes on the role of teacher himself because he thinks
the more people understand his personality the easier
things will be.
112 "The best way to educate people is to cpme out. It's
too easy to go on a soapbox; people will think you're a
kook. One-on-one is the best way," he concluded.
That conclusion may be the best way, but it wasn't
always the easiest for Bao. He agonized over telling
Vayle during his freshman year, until the Speaker's
Bureau scheduled some of its gay and lesbian members
to talk to Bao's fellow Paloma residents in January.
That gave him the initiative and an excuse to bring it
up.
Bao remembered his anxiety that day when Vayle, in
a bad mood already, started to fill out the Speaker's
Bureau questionnaire that is circulated before the
talks, but left the room after crumpling it up.
"I ran to the trash can the minute he left the room to
see if he had answered the question that asks, 'If your
roommate were gay, would you want him to tell
you?' "said Bao, who then decided just to use the
direct approach.
"He was calmer than I was when I told him," Bao
said, recalling the scene. "1 felt really bad. He was
my freshman roommate. He had no choice. I went in
with the attitude, 'Here's something you should
know.' "
Vayle recounted his version of their conversation in
a separate interview.
"I said, 'Oh.' I was standing up and I sank back on a
chair and said, 'I guess we'll find out now if I'm as
liberal as I say I am.' I'll tell you, that Speaker's Bureau
wasn't as simply educational as it would have been,"
Vayle said, chuckling.
"It was a major event, but it was not a crisis. The
most interesting thing was that he didn't tell me early.
He was so serious," said Vayle, reflecting on his first
reactions.
Like Page's experience in Storey, Bao and Vayle got
to know each other as roommates before they faced
the possible conflict.
Vayle knew Bao well enough by then that he doesn't
remember changing his habits or feeling differently
around his roommate after finding out that he was gay.
"I was the first person he'd ever told. It made me
feel very confident in our friendship that he was placing
not burden but confidence in me," Vayle explained. "It
was harder on him because for me it was all in the
abstract. He wasn't in any relationships."
Vayle didn't have many problems with others who
knew, either, although he said that people did seem to
expect him to be nervous around his roommate.
"People tend to see homosexuals as one-track
people. I knew him as a friend and roommate who hap
pens to be gay," Vayle said to explain the ease of his
adjustment to the news.
He also gave credit to Bao's personality, saying,
"He's one of the most giving people I know, and that
has little to do with his sexual preference."
Vayle's residential education proved a positive ex
perience for him, as he said, "It certainly enlightened
me to the fact that there's just so much more to people
than who they choose to be with."
He could think of only one drawback living with Bao
during the year. "He was a slob," Vayle revealed in a
confidential tone. "That was the only reason I didn't
ask him to be my roommate again."
"It' 9 just an expression"
Kunstle, Bao's current roommate, agreed with both
of Vayle's conclusions, saying, "I'm more concerned
with the type of person I live with, their idiosyncracies,

than whether he's gay. He is kind of a slob, but I lived
with a slob last year."
Kunstle found out five weeks into the year that his
roommate is gay and said his first thought was, 'Wow,
I hope I haven't done anything to offend him."
Bao said this kind of reaction was better than if
Kunstle had said nothing. "The worst kind of response
when you tell someone that you're gay is, 'Oh, that's
nice.' You don't know what the person is feeling."
Now, Kunstle says he's adjusted to the situation by
not really changing at all. "We approach it from all the
basic roommate problems — who's going to clean the
fridge?"
"As far as changing in the room goes, I usually let
him worry about that sort of thing because he's always
dealt with that in men's locker rooms and bathrooms,"
Kunstle explained. "He's had to learn to deal with two
types of males."
After living with a gay roommate, Kunstle said he
can understand the predicament Red Ed officials face,
and he thinks they've handled it as well as they can.
"There is no comparable policy where they put men
and women in the same room and say, 'This is gonna
be educational.' There's no traditional social place for
gays to live, though. They're part way here and part
way there. You can't put them with the girls," Kunstle
reasoned.
He said that no amount of thinking about the interac
tion of gay and straight roommates would have been
the same as actually going through it. "Being in the sit
uation, I learned about my reactions. I watch what I
say. I realize the unconscious stereotypes. You hear
people say, 'That's gay.' It's just an expression, but
habits can be hard to break."
For Bao, these experiences in residential education
gave him the strength to finally confront his mother
with the truth.
"I used this article as a psychological ploy to get
myself to tell them," he said during the interview,
after expressing concern that some of the other
sources hadn't wanted their names printed. He decided
that his comments shouldn't be anonymous.
"Last night I told her," he said. "She said she ex
pected it. She went through the whole spectrum of
reactions very fast. First, she said it was just a phase,
then asked me if I was sure, suggested I see a psychol
ogist, or maybe wait a while to make sure.
"Then she went to the other extreme the morning
after I told her, saying, 'I love you, I really do,' " Bao
recounted with mild surprise at his mother's adap
tability.
Bao considers himself lucky that the reactions from
people who know have been so understanding and that
he's never had any encounters with belligerent people
in public.
He said he's not sure what will happen as a result of
being in a campus publication like this, though. "It
should be interesting to see what my freshman year
dormmates will think. Some of them might not take it
well," he said, choosing his words carefully.
"A lot of times people make a distinction between
the person and the sexual preference," Bao said, hint
ing that this attitude doesn't really allow the gay per
son to be himself, although he understands why it's an
attractive idea. "That way they can be totally negative
on gays and still like the person."
"There's no need for a policy"
Naulls, an RAin Paloma when Bao lived there, and
his friend that year, agreed with his approach. "I tried
to keep an open mind and put myself in the position of
the person coming in and entrusting himself to me,"
she said, recalling that she never really worried about
Bao's adjustment as much as that of the people around
him.
"I had no worries, really, because knowing Daniel, I
know he's a really balanced person and would grow
from it," Naulls said, reflecting on her responsibility as
an RA to the two roommates. "With Eric, I was very
observant. I felt it wasn't my place to tell Eric on my
own, but I would check in and ask how things were
going in general, and he always said that everything
was cool."
Naulls never knew that Bao had come out to his
roommate, because she had never noticed a change in
his behavior at all. "I'm pleasantly surprised," she said.
"Other people in the house would have had definite dif
ficulties with it."
In analyzing the education she got from Res Ed, she
said that most of it took place during the training semi
nar on the differences of race, gender and sexuality. "It
helped me learn how to structure my questions, deal
with touchy subjects," she said.
She didn't use the specific training in talking to Bao
as much as the more open attitude the seminar gave
her. Naulls said she left everything open to him,
asking how he felt about himself coming out and how
he felt about telling others. If there had been prob
lems with Bao's roommate, she said her main action
would have been to help put them both in an empat
hetic state of mind.
"The workshop is enough preparation for these
situation," Naulls said from her experience.
"There's no need for a policy."
"Death to gays"
Cadena explained more about the techniques his
workshop uses to give RAs this preparation. "We
ask them, 'Can you put your own judgments aside
when you have to relate to this person and help
others to be sensitive?' " he said.
During the seminar, new RAs are asked to define
terms like, "dyke," "lesbian" or "queen," in a
process of becoming aware of their own attitudes.
Then they are given hypothetical dorm situations
and asked how they would handle them.
"There are no right answers, but the idea is to
get reactions," Cadena said, explaining this phase.
The result of these planned activities and the discus
sion which they provoke is supposed to be an RA's
increase ability to talk about subjects that are loaded
with emothions and strong opinions for most stu
dents. This ability should help RAs in situations
when they need to lead other students through the
same process.
"In any situation where there's a conflict, the per
son who's uncomfortable has probably never talked
about what it is," Cadena said. He described the
"Openness to Differences" seminar as the best way
to show RAs how to break down the barriers to that
talk.
"It's a difficult area for people to deal with, and
RAs are also young," Cadena admitted. "It's difficult
for them to call people out, to respond assertively to
gay persecution. People come back and say to
them, 'You must be gay.' "
He described one incident that took place several
years ago in a graduate student's dorm. A student
had put a sign on his door that read, "Death to
gays," when a student living down the hall was
known to be gay. "The RA was extremely coura
geous and told the person it was horrible by asking,
'Do you realize what this means?' That person took
a hard line, but the student realized what he had
really been saying and turned around and
apologized," Cadena said.
The increasing occurrence of RA crises like this
one necessitated the shift of Res Ed's focus to ad
dressing gay and lesbian issues more in the seminar.
"It seemed to be really focused on sexuality,"
recalled senior Melissa Fischer, an RAin Alondra
who considers herself as having a "lesbian view
point," which she defined as more than a sexual ori
entation, but also a political and philosophical out
look.
"Homosexuality is something I've thought a lot
about. It was good for me to learn what people who
haven't thought about this were thinking."
She was unhappy at first with the seminar's meth
ods, though. "I didn't even want to do it (the defini
tion activity). The trap you fall on by doing that is
defining stereotypes," she said.
She realized, after participating for a little while,
that the structure of the game got people talking.
"It's better that they've thought about it in the
workshop than gotten received instruction," she
concluded.
A tense debate grew out of this discussion, during
which Fischer said she argued against most of the
others who held that homosexuality by definition re
quired a physical relationship. "It went back and
forth for 10 minutes. There was this tension. I felt
like any minute we d say, 'I've had enough,' " she
said. "Trust built up in the group instead. I
didn't expect that the mainstream people would lis
ten to me."
With the freshmen living in her dorm now, she
avoids preaching quite so strongly on the issues, in
stead asking questions that will get informal debates
started in the hall.
She sees the most common attitude as freshmen
who say, "Yes, it's fine, but my children aren't going
to be homosexual.' "
"If you're going to say it's OK, you have a respon
sibility to make a place for homosexuals," is Fis
cher's reply.
She uses her RA role to educate about the lives of
gays and lesbians.
"Homosexuals today have to inhibit their behav
ior. There's a real tension in your life," she ex
plained. "We should work against those tensions in
the dorms."
"The people who scream the loudest and are of
fended by it the most are thinking about it. I'm
excited by it when they bring it up themselves," she
said of her freshmen. "They're certainly very aware
of my political attitudes and of their word choice
when they're around me; they say 'woman' instead
of 'girl.' I don't kow if they all know (about her les
bian viewpoint), but they certainly presume a lot."
Fischer wanted to be an RA to continue the im
portant influence her freshman year RA had on her
in learning to accept the differences she saw in her
self and in others. Between the freshman and senior
years, she chose to live in Synergy, where the resi
dents share this openness, she said.
Of her roommate experiences, she said, "It's a
great thing to (mix people with different sexual
preferences) because it leads to respect for the indi
vidual and the freedom to let someone else be what
they want to be."
She recounted her personal history to explain
how she developed this attitude. During her fresh
man year, she wasn't woman-identified or actively
seeking the company of women, but this was begin
ning to change.
"It's not heterosexuality that turned me off, but
all the things that went with it," she said. "You have
a boyfriend and you only have one, and there are
certain ways you act. I would enjoy figuring the guy
out and then there was nothing else to it."
"I started to think, Wouldn't it be nice to be in a
relationship where you get back what you're
giving?' " Fischer recalled. She doesn't like to label
herself with the word "lesbian" because for her it in

eludes more than it implies; it is a nurturing attitude
and also a politicial stance.
"When people talk about homosexuals, what they
presume is that 24 hours a day you're having sex,
remarked Fischer with disbelief. Her goal is to use
the system of residential education to at least give
students the opportunity to learn something differ
ent from the accepted stereotypes.
"Dorms aren't all that receptive"
Another longtime Synergy resident, senior Lisa
Rubin, chose to avoid the dorms, and often even
roommates, unless she was sure the people she
would be living with had the type of understanding
Fischer is trying to provide.
"I've had singles because I can only live with
someone who knows me very well, she explained.
"I can't live with someone who isn t comfortable
enough with my relationships not to scurry out of
the room if something is going on."
The roommate she was placed with her freshman
year never suspected what was going on, Rubin
remembered. "No women, I felt, knew me at all.
She started the year in love with her RA, who
was a man. But even while she had this crush, she
knew that other things were going on. By spring
quarter, she'd become involved in a long-lasting les
bian relationship, which she hid from her roommate
by spending most of her time in her lover's dorm.
"I don't think she understood what was going on,"
she said, explaining that her roommate was annoyed
that Rubin spent so much time away without expla
nation.
That summer, Rubin and her lover did what many
homosexual couples do; they lived off campus.
"Dorms aren't all that receptive," she explained.
Rubin joined the Speaker's Bureau to provide res
idential education as much as she could without
having to live in the dorms.
"My room wasn't my room"
For a former Stern freshman, there was no es
caping life in a large dorm with an assigned
roommate, all the things that Rubins avoided.
His roommate was against homosexuality be
cause of fundamentalist religious beliefs, but also
felt that he had no right to censor or restrict an
other's actions.

"I didn't know he even knew for a while," said the
sophomore, who asked that his name be withheld.
His roommate never discussed his sexual prefer
ence with him, making him feel that he should
restrict his behavior to avoid pushing the issue.
So whenever he brought friends over, they made
an effort to sit across the room from each other and
never thought of touching when the roommate was
around.
"My room wasn't my room," he remembered.
"There was something about having to act differ
ently there. Other girlfriends were my roommates.
I felt more comfortable in my best girlfriend's room
than my own."
He said he is much happier this year, living with a
friend who is also gay. "I'm much more comfortable
now not having to deal with those little head trips.
Nudity isn't a problem, which is kind of funny to
assume that just because you have a penis, we (gay
roommates) are just out to jump you."
"Personality is more important than that," he
said, agreeing with Vayle and Page.
His view of his residential education was two
sided. There were opportunities for both growth
and persecution. "For a straight person, it can be
very educational. I know I changed a lot of minds in
the dorm," he recalled. "Or it can be absolute hell.
The problem that I foresee is that I could have very
easily gotten stuck with one of the belligerent
homophobes."
He was positive about the benefits in the end,
though, saying, "You become more sure of yourself
because you have to explain yourself and clarify
your own position, which can be wonderful."
Cadena agreed that the possible outcomes of gay
and straight people living together should be good
most of the time. "There are lots of difficult situa
tions people have to live with, and living with a gay
roommate is probably the easiest thing to deal
with."

It's called Residential Education for a reason.
You don't get this education from lectures in the
Tank, but from the people in your own dorm — resi
dent fellows, resident assistants, dormmates and
roommates.
The theory is that you should deal with the frustra
tion of being locked out of your room. You should wade
through piles of someone else's laundry. And
sometimes, you should live with someone whose
sexual preferences are different from your own.
That means that if you're heterosexual, you may
have to redraw the lines of your black and white world
to include an unfamiliar piece of reality, but one that
suddenly has a great influence on your life.

And as a gay man or lesbian, you may have to hide,
defend, or at least explain your everyday emotions to
someone with whom you must then continue to live.
"We (at Res Ed) ask people to do a very difficult
thing, which is to live together in a very small cubicle,"
said Asst. Director of Student Affairs Jim Cadena,
who devises the RA training seminar, "Openness to
Differences," each year. This workshop prepares the
University's front line of support during roommate
crises — the RAs — for some of their most trying situ
ations.
"At the end-of-the-year interview with the RAs, for
a long time their most difficult area involved questions
of race. For the last three years, what's been men
tioned is gay and lesbian issues. We knew we had to do
more in this issue," Cadena said about his decision last
September to focus more on the problems of
homosexual life in the dorms.
Providing this day-long opportunity for new RAs to
explore their reactions to issues of race, gender and
sexual preference and then to discuss how they should
deal with these topics in their dorms is Res Ed's main
way of addressing these issues, too.
Res Ed officials say they don't think an elaborate
policy or detailed restrictions would enhance the
learning that they hope goes on between roommates,
including gay/straight combinations.
"We have no special policy for homosexuals," said

Robin Hensley, program coordinator for Res Ed. "We
work with residential staff if a problem does arise,
talking through fears and anxiety, getting beyond
sexual preference to get to know the person as who
they are."
"There's no need for a policy," Cadena agreed. "It's
really barbaric trying to legislate something like that.
People just need to grow up."
Res Ed's response to students who think they can't
tolerate having a gay or lesbian roommate is a firm re
jection most of the time, however.
This approach follows their overriding policy in such
cases that the experience is meant to be educational,
not easy. Unless the situation proves harmful to one of
the roommate's academic studies, no changes will be
made.
Res Ed won't avoid problems, either, by giving gay
and lesbian students extra consideration in getting

singles. Hensley said he doesn't think it's even a con
sideration. "They're in the same position as far as get
ting a single. This issue would be treated the same as
any other roommate change. It's not treated any differ
ently."
And roommate changes aren't made easily.
"You can't decide you don't want to live with some
one on the first day," Hensley explains. "We went you
to try and work it out, understanding their fears and
not bailing out. It's highly unlikely that sexual prefer
ence would be the sole reason for change."
"Maybe he'd be checking me out"
Sophomore Jens Machatzke, who lives in Storey
House now, said he doesn't agree with this policy. He
found out last year, after drawing into the most sought
after residence on campus, that he would have a gay
roommate, one of the house's returning residents. Un
happy with the idea, he talked to Diana Conklin, direc
tor of the Row.
"I said, i'm paying a lot of money for this school.
What are my options?' " he recalled. "She said I could
work it out within the house. She also said that they
had made exceptions in the past but in my case they
wouldn't. She said that living with gays is part of Resi
dential Education. If that's true, then why don't they
expose everybody to it?"

Machatzke's request was turned down by Res Ed
even after his parents called in their complaints; and no
switches could be made in the house because Mac
hatzke's entering resident status didn't entitle him to
oust any returning residents from their chosen rooms,
according to the house rules.
"I had the choice to get reassigned, but I drew with
six friends. Why should I have to move?" Machatzke
asked, still showing some anger at the way Res Ed
handled his case. "It was very clear to me that this
problem had arisen before. I would have strongly con
sidered moving out and boarding somewhere, but then
I would have lost my guaranteed year."
Machatzke found out when he arrived at school this
year that his assigned roommate had stopped out and
therefore would not be living with him. So the prob
lems he anticipated never occurred, but Machatzke still
has some strong opinions on the issue.
"I never met him. Maybe I should have, but I was
scared," Machatzke admitted. "Res Ed made me feel
wrong for wanting this, though, and said that I should
work it out."
"I have nothing against him except that he's
homosexual," Machatzke said. "My attitude toward
gays is that as long as it doesn't affect me, what they
do is their own business. If you room together, though,
your privileges are shared, and it becomes your busi
ness."
Machatzke points out that Res Ed's policies reflect a
double standard, from his perspective. "Stanford
doesn't allow men and women to room together, and
they're complementing sex preferences just like gays
and straights."
His personal objections followed from this argument.
"If I wanted to change in my room, maybe he'd be
checking me out, maybe he wouldn't. That's the same
reason why there are women's and men's locker
rooms."
After trying to get a satisfactory solution to his com
plaints by working through the system, Machatzke said
he was left disillusioned. "They look down on students
and are condescending, like with the alcohol policy and
the way they treat frats, but then in a situation where
they should be more understanding, they give you this
run-around," he said.
"It just never occurred to me"
This situation at Storey didn't prove to be a problem
for junior Ben Page, who roomed with Machatzke's in
tended roommate last year. He didn't find out about it
before moving in, though.
"He sat me down and told me about three or four
weeks into the quarter," Page recalled, describing his
reaction. "It wasn't something that I'd ever really
thought about. It had just never occurred to me to
wonder if someone's gay."
He wasn't completely neutral about it at first,
though. "I had a sort of instinctive distaste for it, but
that's something I got used to. That doesn't really
carry over to how I would feel about a person."
Page admitted to being a little surprised when he
found out about his roommate's homosexuality, "but
not in a bad way," he said. He attributed his calm reac
tion to the very roommate situation which worried
Machatzke.
"Living with someone, you're more relaxed," Page
explained. "If I had met someone who's gay, I might
have taken it as a big deal."
In his case, residential education took the form of a
new appreciation for a person's individuality. "You
never know until you're in a situation. It could be
someone who turns out fine," Page said. "Sexual pref
erence is a ridiculous basis on which to judge some
one."
The important thing for Page was that, although
they weren't "the best of friends," he and his
roommate got along fine, and he now recommends the
experience for people with feelings like Machatzke's.
"It's too bad if anyone's really uncomfortable with it.
Especially for someone who would think they would be
uncomfortable in a situation like that, it would be good
for them," Page said.
"I could never imagine"
One sophomore who lived in Otero his freshmen
year, asking to be identified only as Jeff, talked about
difficulties he has seen other people have in living with
their roommates.
"I don't think that gay people would want to be put in
a room with other gays, or even with women, but I
personally think that it's important to be put in a room
with an open-minded person," he said. "People should
not worry about their roommate wanting to have a rela
tionship with them. I could never imagine wanting to
have a relationship with someone I'm living with in this
situation."

He did add, though, that occasionally a person will be
attracted to his or her roommate. "I know a guy in
the Suites who is rooming with six to eight guys. They
knew he was gay, but he still has become attracted to
one of the other guys. This usually doesn't happen," he
said.
"It's too easy to go on a soapbox"
Sophomore Daniel Bao's residential education last
year was the experience of coming out to RA Lisa
Naulls and to his freshman year roommate, Eric Vayle.
What he learned about the way people react to fin
ding out he's gay and how he can increase their under
standing helped him when he told sophomore John
Kunstle, his roommate this year and, in an even bigger
step, his parents.
"Usually what happens is that first they don't want to
say anything for fear of insulting you," explained Bao.
"I try to joke about it. Sometimes John (Kunstle) just
forgets and I have to remind him what I'm tallung
about. Then he gets the joke."
Bao said he agrees with Res Ed's idea that students
should learn from the people they live with, and he
takes on the role of teacher himself because he thinks
the more people understand his personality the easier
things will be.
112 "The best way to educate people is to cpme out. It's
too easy to go on a soapbox; people will think you're a
kook. One-on-one is the best way," he concluded.
That conclusion may be the best way, but it wasn't
always the easiest for Bao. He agonized over telling
Vayle during his freshman year, until the Speaker's
Bureau scheduled some of its gay and lesbian members
to talk to Bao's fellow Paloma residents in January.
That gave him the initiative and an excuse to bring it
up.
Bao remembered his anxiety that day when Vayle, in
a bad mood already, started to fill out the Speaker's
Bureau questionnaire that is circulated before the
talks, but left the room after crumpling it up.
"I ran to the trash can the minute he left the room to
see if he had answered the question that asks, 'If your
roommate were gay, would you want him to tell
you?' "said Bao, who then decided just to use the
direct approach.
"He was calmer than I was when I told him," Bao
said, recalling the scene. "1 felt really bad. He was
my freshman roommate. He had no choice. I went in
with the attitude, 'Here's something you should
know.' "
Vayle recounted his version of their conversation in
a separate interview.
"I said, 'Oh.' I was standing up and I sank back on a
chair and said, 'I guess we'll find out now if I'm as
liberal as I say I am.' I'll tell you, that Speaker's Bureau
wasn't as simply educational as it would have been,"
Vayle said, chuckling.
"It was a major event, but it was not a crisis. The
most interesting thing was that he didn't tell me early.
He was so serious," said Vayle, reflecting on his first
reactions.
Like Page's experience in Storey, Bao and Vayle got
to know each other as roommates before they faced
the possible conflict.
Vayle knew Bao well enough by then that he doesn't
remember changing his habits or feeling differently
around his roommate after finding out that he was gay.
"I was the first person he'd ever told. It made me
feel very confident in our friendship that he was placing
not burden but confidence in me," Vayle explained. "It
was harder on him because for me it was all in the
abstract. He wasn't in any relationships."
Vayle didn't have many problems with others who
knew, either, although he said that people did seem to
expect him to be nervous around his roommate.
"People tend to see homosexuals as one-track
people. I knew him as a friend and roommate who hap
pens to be gay," Vayle said to explain the ease of his
adjustment to the news.
He also gave credit to Bao's personality, saying,
"He's one of the most giving people I know, and that
has little to do with his sexual preference."
Vayle's residential education proved a positive ex
perience for him, as he said, "It certainly enlightened
me to the fact that there's just so much more to people
than who they choose to be with."
He could think of only one drawback living with Bao
during the year. "He was a slob," Vayle revealed in a
confidential tone. "That was the only reason I didn't
ask him to be my roommate again."
"It' 9 just an expression"
Kunstle, Bao's current roommate, agreed with both
of Vayle's conclusions, saying, "I'm more concerned
with the type of person I live with, their idiosyncracies,

than whether he's gay. He is kind of a slob, but I lived
with a slob last year."
Kunstle found out five weeks into the year that his
roommate is gay and said his first thought was, 'Wow,
I hope I haven't done anything to offend him."
Bao said this kind of reaction was better than if
Kunstle had said nothing. "The worst kind of response
when you tell someone that you're gay is, 'Oh, that's
nice.' You don't know what the person is feeling."
Now, Kunstle says he's adjusted to the situation by
not really changing at all. "We approach it from all the
basic roommate problems — who's going to clean the
fridge?"
"As far as changing in the room goes, I usually let
him worry about that sort of thing because he's always
dealt with that in men's locker rooms and bathrooms,"
Kunstle explained. "He's had to learn to deal with two
types of males."
After living with a gay roommate, Kunstle said he
can understand the predicament Red Ed officials face,
and he thinks they've handled it as well as they can.
"There is no comparable policy where they put men
and women in the same room and say, 'This is gonna
be educational.' There's no traditional social place for
gays to live, though. They're part way here and part
way there. You can't put them with the girls," Kunstle
reasoned.
He said that no amount of thinking about the interac
tion of gay and straight roommates would have been
the same as actually going through it. "Being in the sit
uation, I learned about my reactions. I watch what I
say. I realize the unconscious stereotypes. You hear
people say, 'That's gay.' It's just an expression, but
habits can be hard to break."
For Bao, these experiences in residential education
gave him the strength to finally confront his mother
with the truth.
"I used this article as a psychological ploy to get
myself to tell them," he said during the interview,
after expressing concern that some of the other
sources hadn't wanted their names printed. He decided
that his comments shouldn't be anonymous.
"Last night I told her," he said. "She said she ex
pected it. She went through the whole spectrum of
reactions very fast. First, she said it was just a phase,
then asked me if I was sure, suggested I see a psychol
ogist, or maybe wait a while to make sure.
"Then she went to the other extreme the morning
after I told her, saying, 'I love you, I really do,' " Bao
recounted with mild surprise at his mother's adap
tability.
Bao considers himself lucky that the reactions from
people who know have been so understanding and that
he's never had any encounters with belligerent people
in public.
He said he's not sure what will happen as a result of
being in a campus publication like this, though. "It
should be interesting to see what my freshman year
dormmates will think. Some of them might not take it
well," he said, choosing his words carefully.
"A lot of times people make a distinction between
the person and the sexual preference," Bao said, hint
ing that this attitude doesn't really allow the gay per
son to be himself, although he understands why it's an
attractive idea. "That way they can be totally negative
on gays and still like the person."
"There's no need for a policy"
Naulls, an RAin Paloma when Bao lived there, and
his friend that year, agreed with his approach. "I tried
to keep an open mind and put myself in the position of
the person coming in and entrusting himself to me,"
she said, recalling that she never really worried about
Bao's adjustment as much as that of the people around
him.
"I had no worries, really, because knowing Daniel, I
know he's a really balanced person and would grow
from it," Naulls said, reflecting on her responsibility as
an RA to the two roommates. "With Eric, I was very
observant. I felt it wasn't my place to tell Eric on my
own, but I would check in and ask how things were
going in general, and he always said that everything
was cool."
Naulls never knew that Bao had come out to his
roommate, because she had never noticed a change in
his behavior at all. "I'm pleasantly surprised," she said.
"Other people in the house would have had definite dif
ficulties with it."
In analyzing the education she got from Res Ed, she
said that most of it took place during the training semi
nar on the differences of race, gender and sexuality. "It
helped me learn how to structure my questions, deal
with touchy subjects," she said.
She didn't use the specific training in talking to Bao
as much as the more open attitude the seminar gave
her. Naulls said she left everything open to him,
asking how he felt about himself coming out and how
he felt about telling others. If there had been prob
lems with Bao's roommate, she said her main action
would have been to help put them both in an empat
hetic state of mind.
"The workshop is enough preparation for these
situation," Naulls said from her experience.
"There's no need for a policy."
"Death to gays"
Cadena explained more about the techniques his
workshop uses to give RAs this preparation. "We
ask them, 'Can you put your own judgments aside
when you have to relate to this person and help
others to be sensitive?' " he said.
During the seminar, new RAs are asked to define
terms like, "dyke," "lesbian" or "queen," in a
process of becoming aware of their own attitudes.
Then they are given hypothetical dorm situations
and asked how they would handle them.
"There are no right answers, but the idea is to
get reactions," Cadena said, explaining this phase.
The result of these planned activities and the discus
sion which they provoke is supposed to be an RA's
increase ability to talk about subjects that are loaded
with emothions and strong opinions for most stu
dents. This ability should help RAs in situations
when they need to lead other students through the
same process.
"In any situation where there's a conflict, the per
son who's uncomfortable has probably never talked
about what it is," Cadena said. He described the
"Openness to Differences" seminar as the best way
to show RAs how to break down the barriers to that
talk.
"It's a difficult area for people to deal with, and
RAs are also young," Cadena admitted. "It's difficult
for them to call people out, to respond assertively to
gay persecution. People come back and say to
them, 'You must be gay.' "
He described one incident that took place several
years ago in a graduate student's dorm. A student
had put a sign on his door that read, "Death to
gays," when a student living down the hall was
known to be gay. "The RA was extremely coura
geous and told the person it was horrible by asking,
'Do you realize what this means?' That person took
a hard line, but the student realized what he had
really been saying and turned around and
apologized," Cadena said.
The increasing occurrence of RA crises like this
one necessitated the shift of Res Ed's focus to ad
dressing gay and lesbian issues more in the seminar.
"It seemed to be really focused on sexuality,"
recalled senior Melissa Fischer, an RAin Alondra
who considers herself as having a "lesbian view
point," which she defined as more than a sexual ori
entation, but also a political and philosophical out
look.
"Homosexuality is something I've thought a lot
about. It was good for me to learn what people who
haven't thought about this were thinking."
She was unhappy at first with the seminar's meth
ods, though. "I didn't even want to do it (the defini
tion activity). The trap you fall on by doing that is
defining stereotypes," she said.
She realized, after participating for a little while,
that the structure of the game got people talking.
"It's better that they've thought about it in the
workshop than gotten received instruction," she
concluded.
A tense debate grew out of this discussion, during
which Fischer said she argued against most of the
others who held that homosexuality by definition re
quired a physical relationship. "It went back and
forth for 10 minutes. There was this tension. I felt
like any minute we d say, 'I've had enough,' " she
said. "Trust built up in the group instead. I
didn't expect that the mainstream people would lis
ten to me."
With the freshmen living in her dorm now, she
avoids preaching quite so strongly on the issues, in
stead asking questions that will get informal debates
started in the hall.
She sees the most common attitude as freshmen
who say, "Yes, it's fine, but my children aren't going
to be homosexual.' "
"If you're going to say it's OK, you have a respon
sibility to make a place for homosexuals," is Fis
cher's reply.
She uses her RA role to educate about the lives of
gays and lesbians.
"Homosexuals today have to inhibit their behav
ior. There's a real tension in your life," she ex
plained. "We should work against those tensions in
the dorms."
"The people who scream the loudest and are of
fended by it the most are thinking about it. I'm
excited by it when they bring it up themselves," she
said of her freshmen. "They're certainly very aware
of my political attitudes and of their word choice
when they're around me; they say 'woman' instead
of 'girl.' I don't kow if they all know (about her les
bian viewpoint), but they certainly presume a lot."
Fischer wanted to be an RA to continue the im
portant influence her freshman year RA had on her
in learning to accept the differences she saw in her
self and in others. Between the freshman and senior
years, she chose to live in Synergy, where the resi
dents share this openness, she said.
Of her roommate experiences, she said, "It's a
great thing to (mix people with different sexual
preferences) because it leads to respect for the indi
vidual and the freedom to let someone else be what
they want to be."
She recounted her personal history to explain
how she developed this attitude. During her fresh
man year, she wasn't woman-identified or actively
seeking the company of women, but this was begin
ning to change.
"It's not heterosexuality that turned me off, but
all the things that went with it," she said. "You have
a boyfriend and you only have one, and there are
certain ways you act. I would enjoy figuring the guy
out and then there was nothing else to it."
"I started to think, Wouldn't it be nice to be in a
relationship where you get back what you're
giving?' " Fischer recalled. She doesn't like to label
herself with the word "lesbian" because for her it in

eludes more than it implies; it is a nurturing attitude
and also a politicial stance.
"When people talk about homosexuals, what they
presume is that 24 hours a day you're having sex,
remarked Fischer with disbelief. Her goal is to use
the system of residential education to at least give
students the opportunity to learn something differ
ent from the accepted stereotypes.
"Dorms aren't all that receptive"
Another longtime Synergy resident, senior Lisa
Rubin, chose to avoid the dorms, and often even
roommates, unless she was sure the people she
would be living with had the type of understanding
Fischer is trying to provide.
"I've had singles because I can only live with
someone who knows me very well, she explained.
"I can't live with someone who isn t comfortable
enough with my relationships not to scurry out of
the room if something is going on."
The roommate she was placed with her freshman
year never suspected what was going on, Rubin
remembered. "No women, I felt, knew me at all.
She started the year in love with her RA, who
was a man. But even while she had this crush, she
knew that other things were going on. By spring
quarter, she'd become involved in a long-lasting les
bian relationship, which she hid from her roommate
by spending most of her time in her lover's dorm.
"I don't think she understood what was going on,"
she said, explaining that her roommate was annoyed
that Rubin spent so much time away without expla
nation.
That summer, Rubin and her lover did what many
homosexual couples do; they lived off campus.
"Dorms aren't all that receptive," she explained.
Rubin joined the Speaker's Bureau to provide res
idential education as much as she could without
having to live in the dorms.
"My room wasn't my room"
For a former Stern freshman, there was no es
caping life in a large dorm with an assigned
roommate, all the things that Rubins avoided.
His roommate was against homosexuality be
cause of fundamentalist religious beliefs, but also
felt that he had no right to censor or restrict an
other's actions.

"I didn't know he even knew for a while," said the
sophomore, who asked that his name be withheld.
His roommate never discussed his sexual prefer
ence with him, making him feel that he should
restrict his behavior to avoid pushing the issue.
So whenever he brought friends over, they made
an effort to sit across the room from each other and
never thought of touching when the roommate was
around.
"My room wasn't my room," he remembered.
"There was something about having to act differ
ently there. Other girlfriends were my roommates.
I felt more comfortable in my best girlfriend's room
than my own."
He said he is much happier this year, living with a
friend who is also gay. "I'm much more comfortable
now not having to deal with those little head trips.
Nudity isn't a problem, which is kind of funny to
assume that just because you have a penis, we (gay
roommates) are just out to jump you."
"Personality is more important than that," he
said, agreeing with Vayle and Page.
His view of his residential education was two
sided. There were opportunities for both growth
and persecution. "For a straight person, it can be
very educational. I know I changed a lot of minds in
the dorm," he recalled. "Or it can be absolute hell.
The problem that I foresee is that I could have very
easily gotten stuck with one of the belligerent
homophobes."
He was positive about the benefits in the end,
though, saying, "You become more sure of yourself
because you have to explain yourself and clarify
your own position, which can be wonderful."
Cadena agreed that the possible outcomes of gay
and straight people living together should be good
most of the time. "There are lots of difficult situa
tions people have to live with, and living with a gay
roommate is probably the easiest thing to deal
with."
