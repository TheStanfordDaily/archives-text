The following is an essay
prepared by a male sophomore who
wished to remain anonymous.
On my first day at the Uni
versity, I silently witnessed
my fellow freshmen fiercely
mutilating the "Gays Aren't
Queer at Stanford" fliers in our
Frosh Orientation Packs. I lis
tened to their fag jokes, with the
rabid laughter of upperclassmen
in the background. Stanford
wasn't quite the sanctuary of
open-mindedness that I had
hoped it would be.
I decided before I arrived here
that I had enough of life as a
"closet case." After my arrival, I
quickly decided that for me
"coming out" would mean an ef
fort to meet other gay people, not
that I would identify myself as gay
to "straight" students.
Holding to that no-one-can
know plan would be relatively
easy, I thought. I was able to
endure the frustration and an
guish of playing the game in high
school, much as I hated it; and I
must have played it well, because
no one ever seriously accused me
of being "a fag." I figured that I
could just be me at Stanford, and
no one would ever know that I
was gay.
But I soon realized that I
couldn't be me. Homosexuality
was much more of an issue here
than it had been in high school,
and it became harder and harder
to suppress responses to the anti
gay insults and myths. Hardly a
day would go by when I wouldn't
hear the subject come up: "Those
#%*& homos are out recruiting
again," someone would say as he
tore and crumpled a Gay and Les
bian Alliance at Stanford (GLAS)
information flier.
"Stay away from the Old
Firehouse," another would warn,
"or you might get raped by a fag."
The pressure was there, but it
was indirect.
I silently withstood the hateful
remarks to avoid the more in
tense attacks that one of my
friends was forced to endure.
Thanks to a "friend" who had
betrayed his confidence, he was
forced "out of the closet" in his
dorm. His dormmates hurled in
sults and threats in graffiti on the
walls of the bathroom stalls: "If I
get AIDS off this toilet seat,
someone is going to die," warned
one. Another said, "Hey you 10
percent — remember the
Holocaust. All homosexuals
should take showers together.
We don't need you, we won't miss
you."

The decorations on his dorm
door were torn down and defaced
one night. "Fags for Mondale,"
someone wrote on his
"Mondale/Ferraro" sticker.
My hopes that the abuse might
end upon escaping the frosh
dorms have been. shattered. In
case I should begin to think that
I'm a human being who deserves
the same rights as others, the
Tresidder stalls remind me that
"Fags have no rights."
Several weeks ago one guy in
my dorm, enraged after hearing
that AIDS has spread even to his
rural home state, ran through the
dorm yelling. "Shoot all those
homos on sight!"
The threats transcend even the
boundaries of life and death.
When the vigilante homophobes
get through, the "holier-than
thou" homophobes tell me where
I'm going after I get shot. Straight
to the depths of hell, it appears.
A few nights ago at dinner, one
such homophobe reacted to the
GLAS fliers that had been on the
tables during breakfast (and had
mysteriously disappeared by
lunch-time). Stanford
homosexuals are trying to
"confuse and persuade impres
sionable young Stanford stu
dents," he said.
A year ago I would have lis
tened silently to his remark, but
this year I dug up the strength to
respond. "Gay people cannot be
recruited," I explained. "A per
son cannot change his or her
sexual orientation any more than
you can change your natural hair
color. Those fliers were simply
informational, for the Stanford
students who are gay."
That remark was all that was
needed to set him off. "I'm not
that gullible," he told me. "What
do you think they do to students
once they get them to those
meetings?"
As I listened and responded to
his accusations, I was incredulous
that anyone could actually believe
these "revelations" about gays; at
the same time I realized that he
was but one among many.

Homosexuality is a form of
adultery, he told me, and
therefore all gay people are con
stantly violating one of God's Ten
Commandments. He even had
"proof': God is showing his dis
pleasure at gays' "decision" to fol
low an "immoral lifestyle"
through the AIDS epidemic.
Why do people "choose" to be
gay? "It's a fad," he explained.
"People think it's the thing to do.
They're misguided by sinful
people."

What about the studies that in
dicate that 10 percent of the pop
ulation is naturally gay, and the
recent evidence that sexual orien
tation is at least paritally biologi
cally rooted, as explicated in the
overview in Judd Marmor's book
" Homosexual Behavior'
The New York Times (Aug.
26, 1985), in addition, contains an
article entitled, "Panelists Cite
Biological Roots for Horn
sexuality."
The student refused to read
any such studies, because he said
he didn't believe in the "religion"
of psychology.
For all the prejudice I've men
tioned, I've not even touched on
the social harassment that I find
the most difficult to deal with as a
gay person. Try (or at least imag
ine) going for a week without dis
playing any affection to your
girlfirend or boyfriend while
anyone is around, even your
roommate. You can't even say
anything around anyone else that
could possibly be construed as
more than just friendly. Then im
agine living under such circum
stances for your whole life, as
most gay people do.
Marriage is never fully realized
because neither the state nor
most churches will perform the
marriage or recognize a life-long
commitment that you have made
to the person you love.
Moreover, you are bombarded
daily with people telling you that
the love you feel isn't real or
valid, and that your natural
feelings are unnatural, perverted
and disgusting.
Every time you hold hands,
every time you kiss, even if the
two of you are all alone, you hear
the voice of society telling you
you're evil, you're sick for doing
what comes naturally to you.
"You and me together, fighting
for our love," echoes the gay rock
group, Bronski Beat, over and
over in one of their more popular
tunes, "Why?" Gay people are
well-acquainted with "fighting for
love," fighting for the right to love
whom we do, and the way we do.
To this day, not a single state
will recognize the marriage of a
gay couple socially, legally or
economically. A few scattered
churches and synagogues, mostly
ones that serve gay congrega
tions, are beginning to give religi
ous validity to such marriages,
but in almost all cases the national
and international religious organi
zations won't go along.
Even Stanford's policies inten
sify the burden. Stanford refuses
to adopt a non-discriminatory ad
missions policy for gay students.
The implication is either that dis
crimination against gay people

does not exist — which the raging
homophobes would gleefully ad
mit is absurd — or that the dis
crimination is OK.
So why did I "come out of the
closet" and subject myself to the
possibility of harassment, threats
and social pressure? Being "out"
for me doesn't mean that I intro
duce myself as a gay person to
everyone I meet, or that I sign
my name to an article in The Daily
in which I discuss my personal life
as a gay person, or that I revolve

my life around my homosexuality,
anymore than heterosexual
people would introduce them
selves as "straight," or would feel
comfortable exposing their per
sonal lives in The Daily, or would
revolve their lives around their
sexuality. v , .
For me, being out means
that I don't deny who I am to
myself or to anyone else who may
question me. It means I can feel
comfortable going out with
whomever I want, whenever I
want, and that I won't be
ashamed to defend myself as a
gay person when I confront misin
formed, abusive homophobic
people.
I'm "out" because I enjoy being
me, living my life as the person I
am and not as the person other
people tell me I should be.
It is important to realize that I
have expressed the feelings and
views of one gay person. Each
gay person is as unique in many
ways as each heterosexual per
son. I could not possibly speak for
all gay students at Stanford any
more than a single straight person
could express the personal
feelings of Stanford's straight
population.
Nonetheless, gay students at
Stanford, and gay people
everywhere do share certain
common experiences unique to
them as gay people — experi
ences of oppression like those I
have outlined.
"There is no doubt that ulti
mately an enlightened and
civilized society must rid itself of
it homophobic fears and
prejudices," Marmor states m
"Homosexual Behavior."
"The vast majority of
homosexual men and women ask
only to be accepted as human
beings and allowed to live their
own lives free of persecution or
discrimination," Marmor contin
ues.
Yet there are scores of myths
about gay people that most
straight people continue to
believe. The facts are out there,
waiting to be absorbed, but they
are drowned in a sea of fear, ig
norance and hatred. People seem
to prefer the myths.
As I was finishing my dinner
table discussion with the student I
mentioned earlier, I asked him
why he was so afraid of learning
the facts and being enlightened.
"If that's enlightenment, I'd
prefer to remain ignorant," he
said. So he does, as do thousands
of other Stanford students, and
millions of people around the
world. And we gay students, and
gay human beings everywhere,
continue to suffer for their ignor
ance.

The following is an essay prepared by senior Romney Robinson

When I was a freshman living
in Branner, the Gay and
Lesbian Speakers Bureau
announced, to my excitement, that
two gay men and two lesbian
women were coming to our dorm to
discuss their experiences of being
gay at Stanford.
I was excitied first of all because
I had never met, nor talked to, an
openly gay person. Secondly,
having recognized the possibility of
my own gay identity since my junior
year of high school, the thought of
listening to a person discuss issues
which I had been afraid to even
mention offered the prospect of
somehow easing the anxiety I had
felt from hiding a portion of my life
as important as sexuality for so
long.

Commentary

At the time, I didn't identify with
being gay nor dream that I ever
would since I didn't understand the
need for labels. I certainly wasn't a
lesbian, because I didn't like the
word. Something about the way it
sounded or rolled awkwardly off my
"tongue. Maybe it was the z
sounding "s" that drew out the
word a little too long and made the
word a little too uncertain . . . lez
zzbian.
Or maybe I had heard the old
saying lez-be-friends once too of
ten.
The word always conjured up a
lot of negative images in my mind
— images of shadowy figures of

women grouped together in dark al
leys, waiting behind doors, stalking
victims and always laughing with a
loud, raucous cackle. Not that I
ever believed that lesbians, real
lesbians like the ones I was listen
ing to at the Speakers Bureau,
were like that, but the stereotype
had been stuck in my mind for a
long time and was not going to be
broken easily.
There was very little I wanted to
do my freshman year about search
ing into the part of my identity that
was uncertain. Looking back, I
found the atmosphere of the dorm
to be repressive primarily because I
felt as though I had to conform to
the overall dorm character created
in Branner.
Homosexuality and a recent in
terest, feminism, did not seem to
be a part of that character. I was
not willing at that time to Lest its
flexibility.
I took the opportunity during my
sophomore year, moving into a new
dorm situation in Alpha Sig, to start
over and to connect myself with the
ideas of feminism. I went to the
Women's Center with the hopes of
involving myself with that portion of
the women's community at Stan
ford that dealt with women's is
sues.
I wanted to meet other women
who were interested in feminist
concerns and to learn more about
feminism — something about which
I knew very little. I also hoped to
somehow connect myself indirectly
with the lesbian community.
Not yet wanting to identify
myself with the word lesbian, I
found the Women's Center offered
an ambiguity to my identity that the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stan
ford (GLAS) could not.
What 1 did find at the Women's
Center was a small group of women
who met once a week to plan pro
grams and events centering around
women's concerns. The group,

though small, was welcoming. Al
though we never really discussed
sexuality or lesbianism as a per
sonal subject (there was only one
openly self-identified lesbian in the
group), simply talking about life as
women at Stanford in even the indi
rect way of programming and spon
soring events helped me learn
about myself as a woman and the is
sues involved in being a woman in a
male-oriented atmosphere.
The time I spent working with
the Women's Center gave me more
time to review my attitudes toward
lesbianism. Hearing the word more
often and seeing it on fliers and in
the magazines and books that I was
reading allowed me to become
more familiar and comfortable with
the word as an identity.
Even all the negative images that
were once brought to mind at the
mere mention of the word lesbian
would be challenged by a song I
would hear one day while traveling
with some friends from the center.
The song started with a stalking
sound from a piano similar in tune to
the type played in old pictures to
cue the audience that the villain was
about to come onto the scene. Next
there were the creaking sounds of a
door opening, followed by a few
thumps and finally an uprise of evil
laughter. I had already started
chuckling quietly to myself but it
was when I heard the words, "Here
come the lesbians ... the leaping
lesbians" that I finally laughed out
loud.

Here was a song that humorously
re-created almost

exactly the
images that I had
once imagined
with the word
"lesbian." It was
like someone
saying, "Yes, the
word can conjure
up a lot of
negative images,
but see how
ridiculous they
are?"
I don't think
that there was
anything else
which was able so
effectively to
shatter the one
lingering reserva
tion I had with the
word "lesbian."
It is difficult to
pinpoint any par
ticular moment to
say that I "came
out," or even
began identifying
myself as a les
bian. Throughout
the time that I
was involved with
the Women's Cen
ter I had slowly
and quietly begun
using the word in
reference to
myself.
I began telling
some of my closer

friends of my lesbianism and occa
sionally went up to GLAS for a
dance or special event. The number
of gay men and lesbians with whom
I was becoming acquainted slowly
rose.
A close friend of mine, a gay man
by the name of David, with whom I
had lived in Branner and with whom
I drew into Alpha Sig, had been
going through a similar situation.
We had come out to each other in
the beginning of the school year and
had since discussed plans and strat
egies on how we could get to know
more gay people on campus. We
eagerly shared our knowledge of
and introduced each other to any
new-found gay and lesbian friends.
At the beginning of my junior
year I began doing Speakers
Bureaus at the dorms. I also
became involved with GLAS. Later
in the year, David and I did a
Speakers Bureau at Alpha Sig, in
this way coming out formally at last
to the house.
The response was one of over
whelmingly positive support. Com
ing out and finally being out for me
was realizing where the source of
my personality lay. It was a dis
covery that my personality
stemmed from my being black, a
woman, a lesbian and a whole host
of experiences that could not be so
clearly categorized.
For the longest time, I had
thought that people would some
how look at me differently after I
told them. What I realized,
however, was that the person that
they were looking at before had in
cluded that lesbianism.
Now my use of the label,
"lesbian" in defining myself is not so
much for personal reasons as it is
for political. It's in knowing that
every person who knows me knows
at least one gay person.
I use it to be counted and to let
people know that lesbians and gay
men do exist in every day life.

The following is an essay
prepared by a male sophomore who
wished to remain anonymous.
On my first day at the Uni

formed, abusive homophobic
people.
I'm "out" because I enjoy being
me, living my life as the person I
am and not as the person other

It is important to realize that I
have expressed the feelings and

time to review my attitudes toward
lesbianism. Hearing the word more
often and seeing it on fliers and in
the magazines and books that I was
reading allowed me to become
more familiar and comfortable with
the word as an identity.
Even all the negative images that
were once brought to mind at the
mere mention of the word lesbian
would be challenged by a song I
would hear one day while traveling
with some friends from the center.
The song started with a stalking
sound from a piano similar in tune to
the type played in old pictures to
cue the audience that the villain was
about to come onto the scene. Next
there were the creaking sounds of a
door opening, followed by a few
thumps and finally an uprise of evil
laughter. I had already started
chuckling quietly to myself but it
was when I heard the words, "Here
come the lesbians ... the leaping
lesbians" that I finally laughed out
loud.

Here was a song that humorously
re-created almost

exactly the
images that I had
once imagined
with the word
"lesbian." It was
like someone
saying, "Yes, the
word can conjure
up a lot of
negative images,
but see how
ridiculous they
are?"
I don't think
that there was
anything else
which was able so
effectively to
shatter the one
lingering reserva
tion I had with the
word "lesbian."
It is difficult to
pinpoint any par
ticular moment to
say that I "came
out," or even
began identifying
myself as a les
bian. Throughout
the time that I
was involved with
the Women's Cen
ter I had slowly
and quietly begun
using the word in
reference to
myself.
I began telling
some of my closer

friends of my lesbianism and occa
sionally went up to GLAS for a
dance or special event. The number
of gay men and lesbians with whom
I was becoming acquainted slowly
rose.
A close friend of mine, a gay man
by the name of David, with whom I
had lived in Branner and with whom
I drew into Alpha Sig, had been
going through a similar situation.
We had come out to each other in
the beginning of the school year and
had since discussed plans and strat
egies on how we could get to know
more gay people on campus. We
eagerly shared our knowledge of
and introduced each other to any
new-found gay and lesbian friends.
At the beginning of my junior
year I began doing Speakers
Bureaus at the dorms. I also
became involved with GLAS. Later
in the year, David and I did a
Speakers Bureau at Alpha Sig, in
this way coming out formally at last
to the house.
The response was one of over
whelmingly positive support. Com
ing out and finally being out for me
was realizing where the source of
my personality lay. It was a dis
covery that my personality
stemmed from my being black, a
woman, a lesbian and a whole host
of experiences that could not be so
clearly categorized.
For the longest time, I had
thought that people would some
how look at me differently after I
told them. What I realized,
however, was that the person that
they were looking at before had in
cluded that lesbianism.
Now my use of the label,
"lesbian" in defining myself is not so
much for personal reasons as it is
for political. It's in knowing that
every person who knows me knows
at least one gay person.
I use it to be counted and to let
people know that lesbians and gay
men do exist in every day life.

The following is an essay
prepared by a male sophomore who
wished to remain anonymous.
On my first day at the Uni
versity, I silently witnessed
my fellow freshmen fiercely
mutilating the "Gays Aren't
Queer at Stanford" fliers in our
Frosh Orientation Packs. I lis
tened to their fag jokes, with the
rabid laughter of upperclassmen
in the background. Stanford
wasn't quite the sanctuary of
open-mindedness that I had
hoped it would be.
I decided before I arrived here
that I had enough of life as a
"closet case." After my arrival, I
quickly decided that for me
"coming out" would mean an ef
fort to meet other gay people, not
that I would identify myself as gay
to "straight" students.
Holding to that no-one-can
know plan would be relatively
easy, I thought. I was able to
endure the frustration and an
guish of playing the game in high
school, much as I hated it; and I
must have played it well, because
no one ever seriously accused me
of being "a fag." I figured that I
could just be me at Stanford, and
no one would ever know that I
was gay.
But I soon realized that I
couldn't be me. Homosexuality
was much more of an issue here
than it had been in high school,
and it became harder and harder
to suppress responses to the anti
gay insults and myths. Hardly a
day would go by when I wouldn't
hear the subject come up: "Those
#%*& homos are out recruiting
again," someone would say as he
tore and crumpled a Gay and Les
bian Alliance at Stanford (GLAS)
information flier.
"Stay away from the Old
Firehouse," another would warn,
"or you might get raped by a fag."
The pressure was there, but it
was indirect.
I silently withstood the hateful
remarks to avoid the more in
tense attacks that one of my
friends was forced to endure.
Thanks to a "friend" who had
betrayed his confidence, he was
forced "out of the closet" in his
dorm. His dormmates hurled in
sults and threats in graffiti on the
walls of the bathroom stalls: "If I
get AIDS off this toilet seat,
someone is going to die," warned
one. Another said, "Hey you 10
percent — remember the
Holocaust. All homosexuals
should take showers together.
We don't need you, we won't miss
you."

The decorations on his dorm
door were torn down and defaced
one night. "Fags for Mondale,"
someone wrote on his
"Mondale/Ferraro" sticker.
My hopes that the abuse might
end upon escaping the frosh
dorms have been. shattered. In
case I should begin to think that
I'm a human being who deserves
the same rights as others, the
Tresidder stalls remind me that
"Fags have no rights."
Several weeks ago one guy in
my dorm, enraged after hearing
that AIDS has spread even to his
rural home state, ran through the
dorm yelling. "Shoot all those
homos on sight!"
The threats transcend even the
boundaries of life and death.
When the vigilante homophobes
get through, the "holier-than
thou" homophobes tell me where
I'm going after I get shot. Straight
to the depths of hell, it appears.
A few nights ago at dinner, one
such homophobe reacted to the
GLAS fliers that had been on the
tables during breakfast (and had
mysteriously disappeared by
lunch-time). Stanford
homosexuals are trying to
"confuse and persuade impres
sionable young Stanford stu
dents," he said.
A year ago I would have lis
tened silently to his remark, but
this year I dug up the strength to
respond. "Gay people cannot be
recruited," I explained. "A per
son cannot change his or her
sexual orientation any more than
you can change your natural hair
color. Those fliers were simply
informational, for the Stanford
students who are gay."
That remark was all that was
needed to set him off. "I'm not
that gullible," he told me. "What
do you think they do to students
once they get them to those
meetings?"
As I listened and responded to
his accusations, I was incredulous
that anyone could actually believe
these "revelations" about gays; at
the same time I realized that he
was but one among many.

Homosexuality is a form of
adultery, he told me, and
therefore all gay people are con
stantly violating one of God's Ten
Commandments. He even had
"proof': God is showing his dis
pleasure at gays' "decision" to fol
low an "immoral lifestyle"
through the AIDS epidemic.
Why do people "choose" to be
gay? "It's a fad," he explained.
"People think it's the thing to do.
They're misguided by sinful
people."

What about the studies that in
dicate that 10 percent of the pop
ulation is naturally gay, and the
recent evidence that sexual orien
tation is at least paritally biologi
cally rooted, as explicated in the
overview in Judd Marmor's book
" Homosexual Behavior'
The New York Times (Aug.
26, 1985), in addition, contains an
article entitled, "Panelists Cite
Biological Roots for Horn
sexuality."
The student refused to read
any such studies, because he said
he didn't believe in the "religion"
of psychology.
For all the prejudice I've men
tioned, I've not even touched on
the social harassment that I find
the most difficult to deal with as a
gay person. Try (or at least imag
ine) going for a week without dis
playing any affection to your
girlfirend or boyfriend while
anyone is around, even your
roommate. You can't even say
anything around anyone else that
could possibly be construed as
more than just friendly. Then im
agine living under such circum
stances for your whole life, as
most gay people do.
Marriage is never fully realized
because neither the state nor
most churches will perform the
marriage or recognize a life-long
commitment that you have made
to the person you love.
Moreover, you are bombarded
daily with people telling you that
the love you feel isn't real or
valid, and that your natural
feelings are unnatural, perverted
and disgusting.
Every time you hold hands,
every time you kiss, even if the
two of you are all alone, you hear
the voice of society telling you
you're evil, you're sick for doing
what comes naturally to you.
"You and me together, fighting
for our love," echoes the gay rock
group, Bronski Beat, over and
over in one of their more popular
tunes, "Why?" Gay people are
well-acquainted with "fighting for
love," fighting for the right to love
whom we do, and the way we do.
To this day, not a single state
will recognize the marriage of a
gay couple socially, legally or
economically. A few scattered
churches and synagogues, mostly
ones that serve gay congrega
tions, are beginning to give religi
ous validity to such marriages,
but in almost all cases the national
and international religious organi
zations won't go along.
Even Stanford's policies inten
sify the burden. Stanford refuses
to adopt a non-discriminatory ad
missions policy for gay students.
The implication is either that dis
crimination against gay people

does not exist — which the raging
homophobes would gleefully ad
mit is absurd — or that the dis
crimination is OK.
So why did I "come out of the
closet" and subject myself to the
possibility of harassment, threats
and social pressure? Being "out"
for me doesn't mean that I intro
duce myself as a gay person to
everyone I meet, or that I sign
my name to an article in The Daily
in which I discuss my personal life
as a gay person, or that I revolve

my life around my homosexuality,
anymore than heterosexual
people would introduce them
selves as "straight," or would feel
comfortable exposing their per
sonal lives in The Daily, or would
revolve their lives around their
sexuality. v , .
For me, being out means
that I don't deny who I am to
myself or to anyone else who may
question me. It means I can feel
comfortable going out with
whomever I want, whenever I
want, and that I won't be
ashamed to defend myself as a
gay person when I confront misin
formed, abusive homophobic
people.
I'm "out" because I enjoy being
me, living my life as the person I
am and not as the person other
people tell me I should be.
It is important to realize that I
have expressed the feelings and
views of one gay person. Each
gay person is as unique in many
ways as each heterosexual per
son. I could not possibly speak for
all gay students at Stanford any
more than a single straight person
could express the personal
feelings of Stanford's straight
population.
Nonetheless, gay students at
Stanford, and gay people
everywhere do share certain
common experiences unique to
them as gay people — experi
ences of oppression like those I
have outlined.
"There is no doubt that ulti
mately an enlightened and
civilized society must rid itself of
it homophobic fears and
prejudices," Marmor states m
"Homosexual Behavior."
"The vast majority of
homosexual men and women ask
only to be accepted as human
beings and allowed to live their
own lives free of persecution or
discrimination," Marmor contin
ues.
Yet there are scores of myths
about gay people that most
straight people continue to
believe. The facts are out there,
waiting to be absorbed, but they
are drowned in a sea of fear, ig
norance and hatred. People seem
to prefer the myths.
As I was finishing my dinner
table discussion with the student I
mentioned earlier, I asked him
why he was so afraid of learning
the facts and being enlightened.
"If that's enlightenment, I'd
prefer to remain ignorant," he
said. So he does, as do thousands
of other Stanford students, and
millions of people around the
world. And we gay students, and
gay human beings everywhere,
continue to suffer for their ignor
ance.

The following is an essay prepared by senior Romney Robinson

When I was a freshman living
in Branner, the Gay and
Lesbian Speakers Bureau
announced, to my excitement, that
two gay men and two lesbian
women were coming to our dorm to
discuss their experiences of being
gay at Stanford.
I was excitied first of all because
I had never met, nor talked to, an
openly gay person. Secondly,
having recognized the possibility of
my own gay identity since my junior
year of high school, the thought of
listening to a person discuss issues
which I had been afraid to even
mention offered the prospect of
somehow easing the anxiety I had
felt from hiding a portion of my life
as important as sexuality for so
long.

Commentary

At the time, I didn't identify with
being gay nor dream that I ever
would since I didn't understand the
need for labels. I certainly wasn't a
lesbian, because I didn't like the
word. Something about the way it
sounded or rolled awkwardly off my
"tongue. Maybe it was the z
sounding "s" that drew out the
word a little too long and made the
word a little too uncertain . . . lez
zzbian.
Or maybe I had heard the old
saying lez-be-friends once too of
ten.
The word always conjured up a
lot of negative images in my mind
— images of shadowy figures of

women grouped together in dark al
leys, waiting behind doors, stalking
victims and always laughing with a
loud, raucous cackle. Not that I
ever believed that lesbians, real
lesbians like the ones I was listen
ing to at the Speakers Bureau,
were like that, but the stereotype
had been stuck in my mind for a
long time and was not going to be
broken easily.
There was very little I wanted to
do my freshman year about search
ing into the part of my identity that
was uncertain. Looking back, I
found the atmosphere of the dorm
to be repressive primarily because I
felt as though I had to conform to
the overall dorm character created
in Branner.
Homosexuality and a recent in
terest, feminism, did not seem to
be a part of that character. I was
not willing at that time to Lest its
flexibility.
I took the opportunity during my
sophomore year, moving into a new
dorm situation in Alpha Sig, to start
over and to connect myself with the
ideas of feminism. I went to the
Women's Center with the hopes of
involving myself with that portion of
the women's community at Stan
ford that dealt with women's is
sues.
I wanted to meet other women
who were interested in feminist
concerns and to learn more about
feminism — something about which
I knew very little. I also hoped to
somehow connect myself indirectly
with the lesbian community.
Not yet wanting to identify
myself with the word lesbian, I
found the Women's Center offered
an ambiguity to my identity that the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stan
ford (GLAS) could not.
What 1 did find at the Women's
Center was a small group of women
who met once a week to plan pro
grams and events centering around
women's concerns. The group,

though small, was welcoming. Al
though we never really discussed
sexuality or lesbianism as a per
sonal subject (there was only one
openly self-identified lesbian in the
group), simply talking about life as
women at Stanford in even the indi
rect way of programming and spon
soring events helped me learn
about myself as a woman and the is
sues involved in being a woman in a
male-oriented atmosphere.
The time I spent working with
the Women's Center gave me more
time to review my attitudes toward
lesbianism. Hearing the word more
often and seeing it on fliers and in
the magazines and books that I was
reading allowed me to become
more familiar and comfortable with
the word as an identity.
Even all the negative images that
were once brought to mind at the
mere mention of the word lesbian
would be challenged by a song I
would hear one day while traveling
with some friends from the center.
The song started with a stalking
sound from a piano similar in tune to
the type played in old pictures to
cue the audience that the villain was
about to come onto the scene. Next
there were the creaking sounds of a
door opening, followed by a few
thumps and finally an uprise of evil
laughter. I had already started
chuckling quietly to myself but it
was when I heard the words, "Here
come the lesbians ... the leaping
lesbians" that I finally laughed out
loud.

Here was a song that humorously
re-created almost

exactly the
images that I had
once imagined
with the word
"lesbian." It was
like someone
saying, "Yes, the
word can conjure
up a lot of

but see how
ridiculous they
are?"
I don't think
that there was
anything else
which was able so
effectively to
shatter the one
lingering reserva
tion I had with the
word "lesbian."
It is difficult to
pinpoint any par
ticular moment to
say that I "came
out," or even
began identifying
myself as a les
bian. Throughout
the time that I
was involved with
the Women's Cen
ter I had slowly
and quietly begun
using the word in
reference to
myself.
I began telling
some of my closer

friends of my lesbianism and occa
sionally went up to GLAS for a
dance or special event. The number
of gay men and lesbians with whom
I was becoming acquainted slowly
rose.
A close friend of mine, a gay man
by the name of David, with whom I
had lived in Branner and with whom
I drew into Alpha Sig, had been
going through a similar situation.
We had come out to each other in
the beginning of the school year and
had since discussed plans and strat
egies on how we could get to know
more gay people on campus. We
eagerly shared our knowledge of
and introduced each other to any
new-found gay and lesbian friends.
At the beginning of my junior
year I began doing Speakers
Bureaus at the dorms. I also
became involved with GLAS. Later
in the year, David and I did a
Speakers Bureau at Alpha Sig, in
this way coming out formally at last
to the house.

gay person when I confront misin
formed, abusive homophobic
people.
I'm "out" because I enjoy being
me, living my life as the person I
am and not as the person other

It is important to realize that I
have expressed the feelings and

gay person is as unique in many
ways as each heterosexual per
son. I could not possibly speak for

feelings of Stanford's straight
population.
Nonetheless, gay students at
Stanford, and gay people
everywhere do share certain
common experiences unique to
them as gay people — experi
ences of oppression like those I
have outlined.
"There is no doubt that ulti
mately an enlightened and

"Homosexual Behavior."
"The vast majority of
homosexual men and women ask

Yet there are scores of myths
about gay people that most
straight people continue to
believe. The facts are out there,
waiting to be absorbed, but they
are drowned in a sea of fear, ig
norance and hatred. People seem
to prefer the myths.
As I was finishing my dinner

why he was so afraid of learning
the facts and being enlightened.
"If that's enlightenment, I'd
prefer to remain ignorant," he
said. So he does, as do thousands
of other Stanford students, and
millions of people around the
world. And we gay students, and
gay human beings everywhere,
continue to suffer for their ignor
ance.

The following is an essay prepared by senior Romney Robinson

When I was a freshman living
in Branner, the Gay and
Lesbian Speakers Bureau
announced, to my excitement, that
two gay men and two lesbian
women were coming to our dorm to
discuss their experiences of being
gay at Stanford.
I was excitied first of all because
I had never met, nor talked to, an
openly gay person. Secondly,
having recognized the possibility of
my own gay identity since my junior
year of high school, the thought of
listening to a person discuss issues
which I had been afraid to even
mention offered the prospect of
somehow easing the anxiety I had
felt from hiding a portion of my life
as important as sexuality for so
long.

Commentary

At the time, I didn't identify with
being gay nor dream that I ever
would since I didn't understand the
need for labels. I certainly wasn't a
lesbian, because I didn't like the
word. Something about the way it
sounded or rolled awkwardly off my
"tongue. Maybe it was the z
sounding "s" that drew out the
word a little too long and made the
word a little too uncertain . . . lez
zzbian.
Or maybe I had heard the old
saying lez-be-friends once too of
ten.
The word always conjured up a
lot of negative images in my mind
— images of shadowy figures of

women grouped together in dark al
leys, waiting behind doors, stalking
victims and always laughing with a
loud, raucous cackle. Not that I
ever believed that lesbians, real
lesbians like the ones I was listen
ing to at the Speakers Bureau,
were like that, but the stereotype
had been stuck in my mind for a
long time and was not going to be
broken easily.
There was very little I wanted to
do my freshman year about search
ing into the part of my identity that
was uncertain. Looking back, I
found the atmosphere of the dorm
to be repressive primarily because I
felt as though I had to conform to
the overall dorm character created
in Branner.
Homosexuality and a recent in
terest, feminism, did not seem to
be a part of that character. I was
not willing at that time to Lest its
flexibility.
I took the opportunity during my
sophomore year, moving into a new
dorm situation in Alpha Sig, to start
over and to connect myself with the
ideas of feminism. I went to the
Women's Center with the hopes of
involving myself with that portion of
the women's community at Stan
ford that dealt with women's is
sues.
I wanted to meet other women
who were interested in feminist
concerns and to learn more about
feminism — something about which
I knew very little. I also hoped to
somehow connect myself indirectly
with the lesbian community.
Not yet wanting to identify
myself with the word lesbian, I
found the Women's Center offered
an ambiguity to my identity that the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stan
ford (GLAS) could not.
What 1 did find at the Women's
Center was a small group of women
who met once a week to plan pro
grams and events centering around
women's concerns. The group,

though small, was welcoming. Al
though we never really discussed
sexuality or lesbianism as a per
sonal subject (there was only one
openly self-identified lesbian in the
group), simply talking about life as
women at Stanford in even the indi
rect way of programming and spon
soring events helped me learn
about myself as a woman and the is
sues involved in being a woman in a
male-oriented atmosphere.
The time I spent working with
the Women's Center gave me more
time to review my attitudes toward
lesbianism. Hearing the word more
often and seeing it on fliers and in
the magazines and books that I was
reading allowed me to become
more familiar and comfortable with
the word as an identity.
Even all the negative images that
were once brought to mind at the
mere mention of the word lesbian
would be challenged by a song I
would hear one day while traveling
with some friends from the center.
The song started with a stalking
sound from a piano similar in tune to
the type played in old pictures to
cue the audience that the villain was
about to come onto the scene. Next
there were the creaking sounds of a
door opening, followed by a few
thumps and finally an uprise of evil
laughter. I had already started
chuckling quietly to myself but it
was when I heard the words, "Here
come the lesbians ... the leaping
lesbians" that I finally laughed out
loud.

Here was a song that humorously
re-created almost

exactly the
images that I had
once imagined
with the word
"lesbian." It was
like someone
saying, "Yes, the
word can conjure
up a lot of
negative images,
but see how
ridiculous they
are?"
I don't think
that there was
anything else
which was able so
effectively to
shatter the one
lingering reserva
tion I had with the
word "lesbian."
It is difficult to
pinpoint any par
ticular moment to
say that I "came
out," or even
began identifying
myself as a les
bian. Throughout
the time that I
was involved with
the Women's Cen
ter I had slowly
and quietly begun
using the word in
reference to
myself.
I began telling
some of my closer

friends of my lesbianism and occa
sionally went up to GLAS for a
dance or special event. The number
of gay men and lesbians with whom
I was becoming acquainted slowly
rose.
A close friend of mine, a gay man
by the name of David, with whom I
had lived in Branner and with whom
I drew into Alpha Sig, had been
going through a similar situation.
We had come out to each other in
the beginning of the school year and
had since discussed plans and strat
egies on how we could get to know
more gay people on campus. We
eagerly shared our knowledge of
and introduced each other to any
new-found gay and lesbian friends.
At the beginning of my junior
year I began doing Speakers
Bureaus at the dorms. I also
became involved with GLAS. Later
in the year, David and I did a
Speakers Bureau at Alpha Sig, in
this way coming out formally at last
to the house.
The response was one of over
whelmingly positive support. Com
ing out and finally being out for me
was realizing where the source of
my personality lay. It was a dis
covery that my personality
stemmed from my being black, a
woman, a lesbian and a whole host
of experiences that could not be so
clearly categorized.
For the longest time, I had
thought that people would some
how look at me differently after I
told them. What I realized,
however, was that the person that
they were looking at before had in
cluded that lesbianism.
Now my use of the label,
"lesbian" in defining myself is not so
much for personal reasons as it is
for political. It's in knowing that
every person who knows me knows
at least one gay person.
I use it to be counted and to let
people know that lesbians and gay
men do exist in every day life.

The following is an essay
prepared by a male sophomore who
wished to remain anonymous.
On my first day at the Uni
versity, I silently witnessed
my fellow freshmen fiercely
mutilating the "Gays Aren't
Queer at Stanford" fliers in our
Frosh Orientation Packs. I lis
tened to their fag jokes, with the
rabid laughter of upperclassmen
in the background. Stanford
wasn't quite the sanctuary of
open-mindedness that I had
hoped it would be.
I decided before I arrived here
that I had enough of life as a
"closet case." After my arrival, I
quickly decided that for me
"coming out" would mean an ef
fort to meet other gay people, not
that I would identify myself as gay
to "straight" students.
Holding to that no-one-can
know plan would be relatively
easy, I thought. I was able to
endure the frustration and an
guish of playing the game in high
school, much as I hated it; and I
must have played it well, because
no one ever seriously accused me
of being "a fag." I figured that I
could just be me at Stanford, and
no one would ever know that I
was gay.
But I soon realized that I
couldn't be me. Homosexuality
was much more of an issue here
than it had been in high school,
and it became harder and harder
to suppress responses to the anti
gay insults and myths. Hardly a
day would go by when I wouldn't
hear the subject come up: "Those
#%*& homos are out recruiting
again," someone would say as he
tore and crumpled a Gay and Les
bian Alliance at Stanford (GLAS)
information flier.
"Stay away from the Old
Firehouse," another would warn,
"or you might get raped by a fag."
The pressure was there, but it
was indirect.
I silently withstood the hateful
remarks to avoid the more in
tense attacks that one of my
friends was forced to endure.
Thanks to a "friend" who had
betrayed his confidence, he was
forced "out of the closet" in his
dorm. His dormmates hurled in
sults and threats in graffiti on the
walls of the bathroom stalls: "If I
get AIDS off this toilet seat,
someone is going to die," warned
one. Another said, "Hey you 10
percent — remember the
Holocaust. All homosexuals
should take showers together.
We don't need you, we won't miss
you."

The decorations on his dorm
door were torn down and defaced
one night. "Fags for Mondale,"
someone wrote on his
"Mondale/Ferraro" sticker.
My hopes that the abuse might
end upon escaping the frosh
dorms have been. shattered. In
case I should begin to think that
I'm a human being who deserves
the same rights as others, the
Tresidder stalls remind me that
"Fags have no rights."
Several weeks ago one guy in
my dorm, enraged after hearing
that AIDS has spread even to his
rural home state, ran through the
dorm yelling. "Shoot all those
homos on sight!"
The threats transcend even the
boundaries of life and death.
When the vigilante homophobes
get through, the "holier-than
thou" homophobes tell me where
I'm going after I get shot. Straight
to the depths of hell, it appears.
A few nights ago at dinner, one
such homophobe reacted to the
GLAS fliers that had been on the
tables during breakfast (and had
mysteriously disappeared by
lunch-time). Stanford
homosexuals are trying to
"confuse and persuade impres
sionable young Stanford stu
dents," he said.
A year ago I would have lis
tened silently to his remark, but
this year I dug up the strength to
respond. "Gay people cannot be
recruited," I explained. "A per
son cannot change his or her
sexual orientation any more than
you can change your natural hair
color. Those fliers were simply
informational, for the Stanford
students who are gay."
That remark was all that was
needed to set him off. "I'm not
that gullible," he told me. "What
do you think they do to students
once they get them to those
meetings?"
As I listened and responded to
his accusations, I was incredulous
that anyone could actually believe
these "revelations" about gays; at
the same time I realized that he
was but one among many.

Homosexuality is a form of
adultery, he told me, and
therefore all gay people are con
stantly violating one of God's Ten
Commandments. He even had
"proof': God is showing his dis
pleasure at gays' "decision" to fol
low an "immoral lifestyle"
through the AIDS epidemic.
Why do people "choose" to be
gay? "It's a fad," he explained.
"People think it's the thing to do.
They're misguided by sinful
people."

What about the studies that in
dicate that 10 percent of the pop
ulation is naturally gay, and the
recent evidence that sexual orien
tation is at least paritally biologi
cally rooted, as explicated in the
overview in Judd Marmor's book
" Homosexual Behavior'
The New York Times (Aug.
26, 1985), in addition, contains an
article entitled, "Panelists Cite
Biological Roots for Horn
sexuality."
The student refused to read
any such studies, because he said
he didn't believe in the "religion"
of psychology.
For all the prejudice I've men
tioned, I've not even touched on
the social harassment that I find
the most difficult to deal with as a
gay person. Try (or at least imag
ine) going for a week without dis
playing any affection to your
girlfirend or boyfriend while
anyone is around, even your
roommate. You can't even say
anything around anyone else that
could possibly be construed as
more than just friendly. Then im
agine living under such circum
stances for your whole life, as
most gay people do.
Marriage is never fully realized
because neither the state nor
most churches will perform the
marriage or recognize a life-long
commitment that you have made
to the person you love.
Moreover, you are bombarded
daily with people telling you that
the love you feel isn't real or
valid, and that your natural
feelings are unnatural, perverted
and disgusting.
Every time you hold hands,
every time you kiss, even if the
two of you are all alone, you hear
the voice of society telling you
you're evil, you're sick for doing
what comes naturally to you.
"You and me together, fighting
for our love," echoes the gay rock
group, Bronski Beat, over and
over in one of their more popular
tunes, "Why?" Gay people are
well-acquainted with "fighting for
love," fighting for the right to love
whom we do, and the way we do.
To this day, not a single state
will recognize the marriage of a
gay couple socially, legally or
economically. A few scattered
churches and synagogues, mostly
ones that serve gay congrega
tions, are beginning to give religi
ous validity to such marriages,
but in almost all cases the national
and international religious organi
zations won't go along.
Even Stanford's policies inten
sify the burden. Stanford refuses
to adopt a non-discriminatory ad
missions policy for gay students.
The implication is either that dis
crimination against gay people

does not exist — which the raging
homophobes would gleefully ad
mit is absurd — or that the dis
crimination is OK.
So why did I "come out of the
closet" and subject myself to the
possibility of harassment, threats
and social pressure? Being "out"
for me doesn't mean that I intro
duce myself as a gay person to
everyone I meet, or that I sign
my name to an article in The Daily
in which I discuss my personal life
as a gay person, or that I revolve

my life around my homosexuality,
anymore than heterosexual
people would introduce them
selves as "straight," or would feel
comfortable exposing their per
sonal lives in The Daily, or would
revolve their lives around their
sexuality. v , .
For me, being out means
that I don't deny who I am to
myself or to anyone else who may
question me. It means I can feel
comfortable going out with
whomever I want, whenever I
want, and that I won't be
ashamed to defend myself as a
gay person when I confront misin
formed, abusive homophobic
people.
I'm "out" because I enjoy being
me, living my life as the person I
am and not as the person other
people tell me I should be.
It is important to realize that I
have expressed the feelings and
views of one gay person. Each
gay person is as unique in many
ways as each heterosexual per
son. I could not possibly speak for
all gay students at Stanford any
more than a single straight person
could express the personal
feelings of Stanford's straight
population.
Nonetheless, gay students at
Stanford, and gay people
everywhere do share certain
common experiences unique to
them as gay people — experi
ences of oppression like those I
have outlined.
"There is no doubt that ulti
mately an enlightened and
civilized society must rid itself of
it homophobic fears and
prejudices," Marmor states m
"Homosexual Behavior."
"The vast majority of
homosexual men and women ask
only to be accepted as human
beings and allowed to live their
own lives free of persecution or
discrimination," Marmor contin
ues.
Yet there are scores of myths
about gay people that most
straight people continue to
believe. The facts are out there,
waiting to be absorbed, but they
are drowned in a sea of fear, ig
norance and hatred. People seem
to prefer the myths.
As I was finishing my dinner
table discussion with the student I
mentioned earlier, I asked him
why he was so afraid of learning
the facts and being enlightened.
"If that's enlightenment, I'd
prefer to remain ignorant," he
said. So he does, as do thousands
of other Stanford students, and
millions of people around the
world. And we gay students, and
gay human beings everywhere,
continue to suffer for their ignor
ance.

for our love," echoes the gay rock
group, Bronski Beat, over and
over in one of their more popular
tunes, "Why?" Gay people are
well-acquainted with "fighting for
love," fighting for the right to love
whom we do, and the way we do.
To this day, not a single state
will recognize the marriage of a
gay couple socially, legally or
economically. A few scattered
churches and synagogues, mostly
ones that serve gay congrega
tions, are beginning to give religi
ous validity to such marriages,
but in almost all cases the national
and international religious organi
zations won't go along.
Even Stanford's policies inten
sify the burden. Stanford refuses
to adopt a non-discriminatory ad
missions policy for gay students.
The implication is either that dis
crimination against gay people

does not exist — which the raging
homophobes would gleefully ad
mit is absurd — or that the dis
crimination is OK.
So why did I "come out of the
closet" and subject myself to the
possibility of harassment, threats
and social pressure? Being "out"
for me doesn't mean that I intro
duce myself as a gay person to
everyone I meet, or that I sign
my name to an article in The Daily
in which I discuss my personal life
as a gay person, or that I revolve

my life around my homosexuality,
anymore than heterosexual
people would introduce them
selves as "straight," or would feel
comfortable exposing their per
sonal lives in The Daily, or would
revolve their lives around their
sexuality. v , .
For me, being out means
that I don't deny who I am to
myself or to anyone else who may
question me. It means I can feel
comfortable going out with
whomever I want, whenever I
want, and that I won't be
ashamed to defend myself as a
gay person when I confront misin
formed, abusive homophobic
people.
I'm "out" because I enjoy being
me, living my life as the person I
am and not as the person other
people tell me I should be.
It is important to realize that I
have expressed the feelings and
views of one gay person. Each
gay person is as unique in many
ways as each heterosexual per
son. I could not possibly speak for
all gay students at Stanford any
more than a single straight person
could express the personal
feelings of Stanford's straight
population.
Nonetheless, gay students at
Stanford, and gay people
everywhere do share certain
common experiences unique to
them as gay people — experi
ences of oppression like those I
have outlined.
"There is no doubt that ulti
mately an enlightened and
civilized society must rid itself of
it homophobic fears and
prejudices," Marmor states m
"Homosexual Behavior."
"The vast majority of
homosexual men and women ask
only to be accepted as human
beings and allowed to live their
own lives free of persecution or
discrimination," Marmor contin
ues.
Yet there are scores of myths
about gay people that most
straight people continue to
believe. The facts are out there,
waiting to be absorbed, but they
are drowned in a sea of fear, ig
norance and hatred. People seem
to prefer the myths.
As I was finishing my dinner
table discussion with the student I
mentioned earlier, I asked him
why he was so afraid of learning
the facts and being enlightened.
"If that's enlightenment, I'd
prefer to remain ignorant," he
said. So he does, as do thousands
of other Stanford students, and
millions of people around the
world. And we gay students, and
gay human beings everywhere,
continue to suffer for their ignor
ance.

The following is an essay prepared by senior Romney Robinson

When I was a freshman living
in Branner, the Gay and
Lesbian Speakers Bureau
announced, to my excitement, that
two gay men and two lesbian
women were coming to our dorm to
discuss their experiences of being
gay at Stanford.
I was excitied first of all because
I had never met, nor talked to, an
openly gay person. Secondly,
having recognized the possibility of
my own gay identity since my junior
year of high school, the thought of
listening to a person discuss issues
which I had been afraid to even
mention offered the prospect of
somehow easing the anxiety I had
felt from hiding a portion of my life
as important as sexuality for so
long.

Commentary

At the time, I didn't identify with
being gay nor dream that I ever
would since I didn't understand the
need for labels. I certainly wasn't a
lesbian, because I didn't like the
word. Something about the way it
sounded or rolled awkwardly off my
"tongue. Maybe it was the z
sounding "s" that drew out the
word a little too long and made the
word a little too uncertain . . . lez
zzbian.
Or maybe I had heard the old
saying lez-be-friends once too of
ten.
The word always conjured up a
lot of negative images in my mind
— images of shadowy figures of

women grouped together in dark al
leys, waiting behind doors, stalking
victims and always laughing with a
loud, raucous cackle. Not that I
ever believed that lesbians, real
lesbians like the ones I was listen
ing to at the Speakers Bureau,
were like that, but the stereotype
had been stuck in my mind for a
long time and was not going to be
broken easily.
There was very little I wanted to
do my freshman year about search
ing into the part of my identity that
was uncertain. Looking back, I
found the atmosphere of the dorm
to be repressive primarily because I
felt as though I had to conform to
the overall dorm character created
in Branner.
Homosexuality and a recent in
terest, feminism, did not seem to
be a part of that character. I was
not willing at that time to Lest its
flexibility.
I took the opportunity during my
sophomore year, moving into a new
dorm situation in Alpha Sig, to start
over and to connect myself with the
ideas of feminism. I went to the
Women's Center with the hopes of
involving myself with that portion of
the women's community at Stan
ford that dealt with women's is
sues.
I wanted to meet other women
who were interested in feminist
concerns and to learn more about
feminism — something about which
I knew very little. I also hoped to
somehow connect myself indirectly
with the lesbian community.
Not yet wanting to identify
myself with the word lesbian, I
found the Women's Center offered
an ambiguity to my identity that the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stan
ford (GLAS) could not.
What 1 did find at the Women's
Center was a small group of women
who met once a week to plan pro
grams and events centering around
women's concerns. The group,

though small, was welcoming. Al
though we never really discussed
sexuality or lesbianism as a per
sonal subject (there was only one
openly self-identified lesbian in the
group), simply talking about life as
women at Stanford in even the indi
rect way of programming and spon
soring events helped me learn
about myself as a woman and the is
sues involved in being a woman in a
male-oriented atmosphere.
The time I spent working with
the Women's Center gave me more
time to review my attitudes toward
lesbianism. Hearing the word more
often and seeing it on fliers and in
the magazines and books that I was
reading allowed me to become
more familiar and comfortable with
the word as an identity.
Even all the negative images that
were once brought to mind at the
mere mention of the word lesbian
would be challenged by a song I
would hear one day while traveling
with some friends from the center.
The song started with a stalking
sound from a piano similar in tune to
the type played in old pictures to
cue the audience that the villain was
about to come onto the scene. Next
there were the creaking sounds of a
door opening, followed by a few
thumps and finally an uprise of evil
laughter. I had already started
chuckling quietly to myself but it
was when I heard the words, "Here
come the lesbians ... the leaping
lesbians" that I finally laughed out
loud.

Here was a song that humorously
re-created almost

exactly the
images that I had
once imagined
with the word
"lesbian." It was
like someone
saying, "Yes, the
word can conjure
up a lot of
negative images,
but see how
ridiculous they
are?"
I don't think
that there was
anything else
which was able so
effectively to
shatter the one
lingering reserva
tion I had with the
word "lesbian."
It is difficult to
pinpoint any par
ticular moment to
say that I "came
out," or even
began identifying
myself as a les
bian. Throughout
the time that I
was involved with
the Women's Cen
ter I had slowly
and quietly begun
using the word in
reference to
myself.
I began telling
some of my closer

friends of my lesbianism and occa
sionally went up to GLAS for a
dance or special event. The number
of gay men and lesbians with whom
I was becoming acquainted slowly
rose.
A close friend of mine, a gay man
by the name of David, with whom I
had lived in Branner and with whom
I drew into Alpha Sig, had been
going through a similar situation.
We had come out to each other in
the beginning of the school year and
had since discussed plans and strat
egies on how we could get to know
more gay people on campus. We
eagerly shared our knowledge of
and introduced each other to any
new-found gay and lesbian friends.
At the beginning of my junior
year I began doing Speakers
Bureaus at the dorms. I also
became involved with GLAS. Later
in the year, David and I did a
Speakers Bureau at Alpha Sig, in
this way coming out formally at last
to the house.
The response was one of over
whelmingly positive support. Com
ing out and finally being out for me
was realizing where the source of
my personality lay. It was a dis
covery that my personality
stemmed from my being black, a
woman, a lesbian and a whole host
of experiences that could not be so
clearly categorized.
For the longest time, I had
thought that people would some
how look at me differently after I
told them. What I realized,
however, was that the person that
they were looking at before had in
cluded that lesbianism.
Now my use of the label,
"lesbian" in defining myself is not so
much for personal reasons as it is
for political. It's in knowing that
every person who knows me knows
at least one gay person.
I use it to be counted and to let
people know that lesbians and gay
men do exist in every day life.

The following is an essay
prepared by a male sophomore who
wished to remain anonymous.
On my first day at the Uni
versity, I silently witnessed
my fellow freshmen fiercely
mutilating the "Gays Aren't
Queer at Stanford" fliers in our
Frosh Orientation Packs. I lis
tened to their fag jokes, with the
rabid laughter of upperclassmen
in the background. Stanford
wasn't quite the sanctuary of
open-mindedness that I had
hoped it would be.
I decided before I arrived here
that I had enough of life as a
"closet case." After my arrival, I
quickly decided that for me
"coming out" would mean an ef
fort to meet other gay people, not
that I would identify myself as gay
to "straight" students.
Holding to that no-one-can
know plan would be relatively
easy, I thought. I was able to
endure the frustration and an
guish of playing the game in high
school, much as I hated it; and I
must have played it well, because
no one ever seriously accused me
of being "a fag." I figured that I
could just be me at Stanford, and
no one would ever know that I
was gay.
But I soon realized that I
couldn't be me. Homosexuality
was much more of an issue here
than it had been in high school,
and it became harder and harder
to suppress responses to the anti
gay insults and myths. Hardly a
day would go by when I wouldn't
hear the subject come up: "Those
#%*& homos are out recruiting
again," someone would say as he
tore and crumpled a Gay and Les
bian Alliance at Stanford (GLAS)
information flier.
"Stay away from the Old
Firehouse," another would warn,
"or you might get raped by a fag."
The pressure was there, but it
was indirect.
I silently withstood the hateful
remarks to avoid the more in
tense attacks that one of my
friends was forced to endure.
Thanks to a "friend" who had
betrayed his confidence, he was
forced "out of the closet" in his
dorm. His dormmates hurled in
sults and threats in graffiti on the
walls of the bathroom stalls: "If I
get AIDS off this toilet seat,
someone is going to die," warned
one. Another said, "Hey you 10
percent — remember the
Holocaust. All homosexuals
should take showers together.
We don't need you, we won't miss
you."

The decorations on his dorm
door were torn down and defaced
one night. "Fags for Mondale,"
someone wrote on his
"Mondale/Ferraro" sticker.
My hopes that the abuse might
end upon escaping the frosh
dorms have been. shattered. In
case I should begin to think that
I'm a human being who deserves
the same rights as others, the
Tresidder stalls remind me that
"Fags have no rights."
Several weeks ago one guy in
my dorm, enraged after hearing
that AIDS has spread even to his
rural home state, ran through the
dorm yelling. "Shoot all those
homos on sight!"
The threats transcend even the
boundaries of life and death.
When the vigilante homophobes
get through, the "holier-than
thou" homophobes tell me where
I'm going after I get shot. Straight
to the depths of hell, it appears.
A few nights ago at dinner, one
such homophobe reacted to the
GLAS fliers that had been on the
tables during breakfast (and had
mysteriously disappeared by
lunch-time). Stanford
homosexuals are trying to
"confuse and persuade impres
sionable young Stanford stu
dents," he said.
A year ago I would have lis
tened silently to his remark, but
this year I dug up the strength to
respond. "Gay people cannot be
recruited," I explained. "A per
son cannot change his or her
sexual orientation any more than
you can change your natural hair
color. Those fliers were simply
informational, for the Stanford
students who are gay."
That remark was all that was
needed to set him off. "I'm not
that gullible," he told me. "What
do you think they do to students
once they get them to those
meetings?"
As I listened and responded to
his accusations, I was incredulous
that anyone could actually believe
these "revelations" about gays; at
the same time I realized that he
was but one among many.

Homosexuality is a form of
adultery, he told me, and
therefore all gay people are con
stantly violating one of God's Ten
Commandments. He even had
"proof': God is showing his dis
pleasure at gays' "decision" to fol
low an "immoral lifestyle"
through the AIDS epidemic.
Why do people "choose" to be
gay? "It's a fad," he explained.
"People think it's the thing to do.
They're misguided by sinful
people."

What about the studies that in
dicate that 10 percent of the pop
ulation is naturally gay, and the
recent evidence that sexual orien
tation is at least paritally biologi
cally rooted, as explicated in the
overview in Judd Marmor's book
" Homosexual Behavior'
The New York Times (Aug.
26, 1985), in addition, contains an
article entitled, "Panelists Cite
Biological Roots for Horn
sexuality."
The student refused to read
any such studies, because he said
he didn't believe in the "religion"
of psychology.
For all the prejudice I've men
tioned, I've not even touched on
the social harassment that I find
the most difficult to deal with as a
gay person. Try (or at least imag
ine) going for a week without dis
playing any affection to your
girlfirend or boyfriend while
anyone is around, even your
roommate. You can't even say
anything around anyone else that
could possibly be construed as
more than just friendly. Then im
agine living under such circum
stances for your whole life, as
most gay people do.
Marriage is never fully realized
because neither the state nor
most churches will perform the
marriage or recognize a life-long
commitment that you have made
to the person you love.
Moreover, you are bombarded
daily with people telling you that
the love you feel isn't real or
valid, and that your natural
feelings are unnatural, perverted
and disgusting.
Every time you hold hands,
every time you kiss, even if the
two of you are all alone, you hear
the voice of society telling you
you're evil, you're sick for doing
what comes naturally to you.
"You and me together, fighting
for our love," echoes the gay rock
group, Bronski Beat, over and
over in one of their more popular
tunes, "Why?" Gay people are
well-acquainted with "fighting for
love," fighting for the right to love
whom we do, and the way we do.
To this day, not a single state
will recognize the marriage of a
gay couple socially, legally or
economically. A few scattered
churches and synagogues, mostly
ones that serve gay congrega
tions, are beginning to give religi
ous validity to such marriages,
but in almost all cases the national
and international religious organi
zations won't go along.
Even Stanford's policies inten
sify the burden. Stanford refuses
to adopt a non-discriminatory ad
missions policy for gay students.
The implication is either that dis
crimination against gay people

does not exist — which the raging
homophobes would gleefully ad
mit is absurd — or that the dis
crimination is OK.
So why did I "come out of the
closet" and subject myself to the
possibility of harassment, threats
and social pressure? Being "out"
for me doesn't mean that I intro
duce myself as a gay person to
everyone I meet, or that I sign
my name to an article in The Daily
in which I discuss my personal life
as a gay person, or that I revolve

my life around my homosexuality,
anymore than heterosexual
people would introduce them
selves as "straight," or would feel
comfortable exposing their per
sonal lives in The Daily, or would
revolve their lives around their
sexuality. v , .
For me, being out means
that I don't deny who I am to
myself or to anyone else who may
question me. It means I can feel
comfortable going out with
whomever I want, whenever I
want, and that I won't be
ashamed to defend myself as a
gay person when I confront misin
formed, abusive homophobic
people.
I'm "out" because I enjoy being
me, living my life as the person I
am and not as the person other
people tell me I should be.
It is important to realize that I
have expressed the feelings and
views of one gay person. Each
gay person is as unique in many
ways as each heterosexual per
son. I could not possibly speak for
all gay students at Stanford any
more than a single straight person
could express the personal
feelings of Stanford's straight
population.
Nonetheless, gay students at
Stanford, and gay people
everywhere do share certain
common experiences unique to
them as gay people — experi
ences of oppression like those I
have outlined.
"There is no doubt that ulti
mately an enlightened and
civilized society must rid itself of
it homophobic fears and
prejudices," Marmor states m
"Homosexual Behavior."
"The vast majority of
homosexual men and women ask
only to be accepted as human
beings and allowed to live their
own lives free of persecution or
discrimination," Marmor contin
ues.
Yet there are scores of myths
about gay people that most
straight people continue to
believe. The facts are out there,
waiting to be absorbed, but they
are drowned in a sea of fear, ig
norance and hatred. People seem
to prefer the myths.
As I was finishing my dinner
table discussion with the student I
mentioned earlier, I asked him
why he was so afraid of learning
the facts and being enlightened.
"If that's enlightenment, I'd
prefer to remain ignorant," he
said. So he does, as do thousands
of other Stanford students, and
millions of people around the
world. And we gay students, and
gay human beings everywhere,
continue to suffer for their ignor
ance.

dorm yelling. "Shoot all those
homos on sight!"
The threats transcend even the
boundaries of life and death.
When the vigilante homophobes
get through, the "holier-than
thou" homophobes tell me where
I'm going after I get shot. Straight
to the depths of hell, it appears.
A few nights ago at dinner, one
such homophobe reacted to the
GLAS fliers that had been on the
tables during breakfast (and had
mysteriously disappeared by
lunch-time). Stanford
homosexuals are trying to
"confuse and persuade impres
sionable young Stanford stu
dents," he said.
A year ago I would have lis
tened silently to his remark, but
this year I dug up the strength to
respond. "Gay people cannot be
recruited," I explained. "A per
son cannot change his or her
sexual orientation any more than
you can change your natural hair
color. Those fliers were simply
informational, for the Stanford
students who are gay."
That remark was all that was
needed to set him off. "I'm not
that gullible," he told me. "What
do you think they do to students
once they get them to those
meetings?"
As I listened and responded to
his accusations, I was incredulous
that anyone could actually believe
these "revelations" about gays; at
the same time I realized that he
was but one among many.

Homosexuality is a form of
adultery, he told me, and
therefore all gay people are con
stantly violating one of God's Ten
Commandments. He even had
"proof': God is showing his dis
pleasure at gays' "decision" to fol
low an "immoral lifestyle"
through the AIDS epidemic.
Why do people "choose" to be
gay? "It's a fad," he explained.
"People think it's the thing to do.
They're misguided by sinful
people."

What about the studies that in
dicate that 10 percent of the pop
ulation is naturally gay, and the
recent evidence that sexual orien
tation is at least paritally biologi
cally rooted, as explicated in the
overview in Judd Marmor's book
" Homosexual Behavior'
The New York Times (Aug.
26, 1985), in addition, contains an
article entitled, "Panelists Cite
Biological Roots for Horn
sexuality."
The student refused to read
any such studies, because he said
he didn't believe in the "religion"
of psychology.
For all the prejudice I've men
tioned, I've not even touched on
the social harassment that I find
the most difficult to deal with as a
gay person. Try (or at least imag
ine) going for a week without dis
playing any affection to your
girlfirend or boyfriend while
anyone is around, even your
roommate. You can't even say
anything around anyone else that
could possibly be construed as
more than just friendly. Then im
agine living under such circum
stances for your whole life, as
most gay people do.
Marriage is never fully realized
because neither the state nor
most churches will perform the
marriage or recognize a life-long
commitment that you have made
to the person you love.
Moreover, you are bombarded
daily with people telling you that
the love you feel isn't real or
valid, and that your natural
feelings are unnatural, perverted
and disgusting.
Every time you hold hands,
every time you kiss, even if the
two of you are all alone, you hear
the voice of society telling you
you're evil, you're sick for doing
what comes naturally to you.
"You and me together, fighting
for our love," echoes the gay rock
group, Bronski Beat, over and
over in one of their more popular
tunes, "Why?" Gay people are
well-acquainted with "fighting for
love," fighting for the right to love
whom we do, and the way we do.
To this day, not a single state
will recognize the marriage of a
gay couple socially, legally or
economically. A few scattered
churches and synagogues, mostly
ones that serve gay congrega
tions, are beginning to give religi
ous validity to such marriages,
but in almost all cases the national
and international religious organi
zations won't go along.
Even Stanford's policies inten
sify the burden. Stanford refuses
to adopt a non-discriminatory ad
missions policy for gay students.
The implication is either that dis
crimination against gay people

does not exist — which the raging
homophobes would gleefully ad
mit is absurd — or that the dis
crimination is OK.
So why did I "come out of the
closet" and subject myself to the
possibility of harassment, threats
and social pressure? Being "out"
for me doesn't mean that I intro
duce myself as a gay person to
everyone I meet, or that I sign
my name to an article in The Daily
in which I discuss my personal life
as a gay person, or that I revolve

my life around my homosexuality,
anymore than heterosexual
people would introduce them
selves as "straight," or would feel
comfortable exposing their per
sonal lives in The Daily, or would
revolve their lives around their
sexuality. v , .
For me, being out means
that I don't deny who I am to
myself or to anyone else who may
question me. It means I can feel
comfortable going out with
whomever I want, whenever I
want, and that I won't be
ashamed to defend myself as a
gay person when I confront misin
formed, abusive homophobic
people.
I'm "out" because I enjoy being
me, living my life as the person I
am and not as the person other
people tell me I should be.
It is important to realize that I
have expressed the feelings and
views of one gay person. Each
gay person is as unique in many
ways as each heterosexual per
son. I could not possibly speak for
all gay students at Stanford any
more than a single straight person
could express the personal
feelings of Stanford's straight
population.
Nonetheless, gay students at
Stanford, and gay people
everywhere do share certain
common experiences unique to
them as gay people — experi
ences of oppression like those I
have outlined.
"There is no doubt that ulti
mately an enlightened and
civilized society must rid itself of
it homophobic fears and
prejudices," Marmor states m
"Homosexual Behavior."
"The vast majority of
homosexual men and women ask
only to be accepted as human
beings and allowed to live their
own lives free of persecution or
discrimination," Marmor contin
ues.
Yet there are scores of myths
about gay people that most
straight people continue to
believe. The facts are out there,
waiting to be absorbed, but they
are drowned in a sea of fear, ig
norance and hatred. People seem
to prefer the myths.
As I was finishing my dinner
table discussion with the student I
mentioned earlier, I asked him
why he was so afraid of learning
the facts and being enlightened.
"If that's enlightenment, I'd
prefer to remain ignorant," he
said. So he does, as do thousands
of other Stanford students, and
millions of people around the
world. And we gay students, and
gay human beings everywhere,
continue to suffer for their ignor
ance.

The following is an essay prepared by senior Romney Robinson

When I was a freshman living
in Branner, the Gay and
Lesbian Speakers Bureau
announced, to my excitement, that
two gay men and two lesbian
women were coming to our dorm to
discuss their experiences of being
gay at Stanford.
I was excitied first of all because
I had never met, nor talked to, an
openly gay person. Secondly,
having recognized the possibility of
my own gay identity since my junior
year of high school, the thought of
listening to a person discuss issues
which I had been afraid to even
mention offered the prospect of
somehow easing the anxiety I had
felt from hiding a portion of my life
as important as sexuality for so
long.

Commentary

At the time, I didn't identify with
being gay nor dream that I ever
would since I didn't understand the
need for labels. I certainly wasn't a
lesbian, because I didn't like the
word. Something about the way it
sounded or rolled awkwardly off my
"tongue. Maybe it was the z
sounding "s" that drew out the
word a little too long and made the
word a little too uncertain . . . lez
zzbian.
Or maybe I had heard the old
saying lez-be-friends once too of
ten.
The word always conjured up a
lot of negative images in my mind
— images of shadowy figures of

women grouped together in dark al
leys, waiting behind doors, stalking
victims and always laughing with a
loud, raucous cackle. Not that I
ever believed that lesbians, real
lesbians like the ones I was listen
ing to at the Speakers Bureau,
were like that, but the stereotype
had been stuck in my mind for a
long time and was not going to be
broken easily.
There was very little I wanted to
do my freshman year about search
ing into the part of my identity that
was uncertain. Looking back, I
found the atmosphere of the dorm
to be repressive primarily because I
felt as though I had to conform to
the overall dorm character created
in Branner.
Homosexuality and a recent in
terest, feminism, did not seem to
be a part of that character. I was
not willing at that time to Lest its
flexibility.
I took the opportunity during my
sophomore year, moving into a new
dorm situation in Alpha Sig, to start
over and to connect myself with the
ideas of feminism. I went to the
Women's Center with the hopes of
involving myself with that portion of
the women's community at Stan
ford that dealt with women's is
sues.
I wanted to meet other women
who were interested in feminist
concerns and to learn more about
feminism — something about which
I knew very little. I also hoped to
somehow connect myself indirectly
with the lesbian community.
Not yet wanting to identify
myself with the word lesbian, I
found the Women's Center offered
an ambiguity to my identity that the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stan
ford (GLAS) could not.
What 1 did find at the Women's
Center was a small group of women
who met once a week to plan pro
grams and events centering around
women's concerns. The group,

though small, was welcoming. Al
though we never really discussed
sexuality or lesbianism as a per
sonal subject (there was only one
openly self-identified lesbian in the
group), simply talking about life as
women at Stanford in even the indi
rect way of programming and spon
soring events helped me learn
about myself as a woman and the is
sues involved in being a woman in a
male-oriented atmosphere.
The time I spent working with
the Women's Center gave me more
time to review my attitudes toward
lesbianism. Hearing the word more
often and seeing it on fliers and in
the magazines and books that I was
reading allowed me to become
more familiar and comfortable with
the word as an identity.
Even all the negative images that
were once brought to mind at the
mere mention of the word lesbian
would be challenged by a song I
would hear one day while traveling
with some friends from the center.
The song started with a stalking
sound from a piano similar in tune to
the type played in old pictures to
cue the audience that the villain was
about to come onto the scene. Next
there were the creaking sounds of a
door opening, followed by a few
thumps and finally an uprise of evil
laughter. I had already started
chuckling quietly to myself but it
was when I heard the words, "Here
come the lesbians ... the leaping
lesbians" that I finally laughed out
loud.

Here was a song that humorously
re-created almost

exactly the
images that I had
once imagined
with the word
"lesbian." It was
like someone
saying, "Yes, the
word can conjure
up a lot of
negative images,
but see how
ridiculous they
are?"
I don't think
that there was
anything else
which was able so
effectively to
shatter the one
lingering reserva
tion I had with the
word "lesbian."
It is difficult to
pinpoint any par
ticular moment to
say that I "came
out," or even
began identifying
myself as a les
bian. Throughout
the time that I
was involved with
the Women's Cen
ter I had slowly
and quietly begun
using the word in
reference to
myself.
I began telling
some of my closer

friends of my lesbianism and occa
sionally went up to GLAS for a
dance or special event. The number
of gay men and lesbians with whom
I was becoming acquainted slowly
rose.
A close friend of mine, a gay man
by the name of David, with whom I
had lived in Branner and with whom
I drew into Alpha Sig, had been
going through a similar situation.
We had come out to each other in
the beginning of the school year and
had since discussed plans and strat
egies on how we could get to know
more gay people on campus. We
eagerly shared our knowledge of
and introduced each other to any
new-found gay and lesbian friends.
At the beginning of my junior
year I began doing Speakers
Bureaus at the dorms. I also
became involved with GLAS. Later
in the year, David and I did a
Speakers Bureau at Alpha Sig, in
this way coming out formally at last
to the house.
The response was one of over
whelmingly positive support. Com
ing out and finally being out for me
was realizing where the source of
my personality lay. It was a dis
covery that my personality
stemmed from my being black, a
woman, a lesbian and a whole host
of experiences that could not be so
clearly categorized.
For the longest time, I had
thought that people would some
how look at me differently after I
told them. What I realized,
however, was that the person that
they were looking at before had in
cluded that lesbianism.
Now my use of the label,
"lesbian" in defining myself is not so
much for personal reasons as it is
for political. It's in knowing that
every person who knows me knows
at least one gay person.
I use it to be counted and to let
people know that lesbians and gay
men do exist in every day life.
