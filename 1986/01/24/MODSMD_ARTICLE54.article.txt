# GLAS plays socio-politics

### STACY SIMON Staff writer 
The Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
(GLAS) exists to provide a supportive envi
ronment for homosexuals, to promote the in
tegration of homosexuality into American so
ciety and to protect civil rights for
homosexuals, especially those with AIDS, ac
cording to GLAS Steering Committee mem
ber Roland van Gaalen.
Toward that end, GLAS sponsors films,
dances, poetry readings, lectures, parties,
discussion groups, rallies, speakers and
protests.
"We've been invisible for too long," said
van Gaalen, but he admits that the "high
profile" favored by the current GLAS leader
ship may deter students who are still in the
closet from joining the organization. It's a
trade-off between outreach and activism, he
said.
In 1983, Stanford accepted $2,040 raised
by GLAS to "provide a scholarship for a
medical school student, with preference to be
given to the student who has shown a com
mitment to serving the gay community."
In November, GLAS publicized "Living
With AIDS," a documentary preview, and
sponsored a lecture by a doctor from San
Francisco General Hospital on the latest
AIDS-related developments.
GLAS's main tradition is Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Week, which had a budget last
May of almost $10,000, according to GLAS
Archivist Gerard Koskovich, and included
about 20 events. Van Gaalen said that GLAS
is hoping to get gay author Christopher Isher
wood to speak at the 1986 event.
Events such as these, according to van
Gaalen, are intended to promote community
awareness of homosexuals.
Van Gaalen said the civil rights activism of
GLAS can be "a stink over a seemingly insig
nificant conflict on campus." He mentioned as
an example, a fraternity's re-enactment of
the attack on the Segal scupture.
Installed on campus in February 1984,
George Segal's sculpture, "Gay Liberation,"
is a white bronze depiction of two standing
men and two seated women.
Two weeks after it arrived on campus, an
unidentified white man vandalized the
sculpture with a ballpeen hammer.
GLAS sponsored a rally in White Plaza to
protest the violence and suggested that stu
dents place flowers at the site.
In January 1985, four Sigma Alpha Epsilon
pledges disrupted a Martin Luther King, Jr.
rally when they powdered themselves white
and posed as the figures in the Segal
sculpture, while other pledges gestured at
them with hammers.
Following a meeting between the GLAS
Steering Committee and Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons, the fraternity apologized
to the public, GLAS and the black community
and conducted a seminar addressing homo
phobia and society's perception of
homosexuals.
In spite of this incident, van Gaalen and
Koskovich both insisted that Stanford pro
vides a positive environment for gay men and
lesbians. Van Gaalen called GLAS "one of the
most successful student organizations of its
kind in the nation," and Koskovich over
flowed with praise for gay "greats," gay
"firsts" and gay "onlys" on the Stanford
campus.
Van Gaalen went so far as to say, "If the
whole world were like Stanford, we wouldn't
have any problems at all."
GLAS has a meeting room, which is big
enough to hold a long conference table, four
couches, four desks, a refrigerator and
several easy chairs and still have enough
space left for a 100-person social meeting.
Van Gaalen called the space a "big asset."
He said the gay and lesbian group at UC-
Berkeley isn't as successful as GLAS be
cause it has only an office.
Koskovich called the floor a "private terri-

Tory where people could feel comfortable
coming to meetings without having to shove
their way through lots of people who have
nothing to do with the organization."
Koskovich wants the "Community Cen
ter," as GLAS members refer to the space,
to have permanent status so that GLAS
would not have to reapply for it every year.
He mentioned the Black House, El Centro
Chicano and the Women's Center as perman
ent facilities given to organizations by the
University.
GLAS is an organization for both gay men
and lesbians, but the two often go their sepa
rate ways.
"The problem with the term 'gay' applying
to both men and women is that most people
think only of men," van Gaalen said.
Senior Noel Hanrahan, one of two women
on the GLAS Steering Committee, agreed
that the term "gay" can lead to an "invisibility
of the female component."
She said that differences between gay men
and lesbians caused the founding of the
Women's Collective in 1981. The group is still
part of GLAS, but has its own budget of
$1,500 to sponsor events.

"Having gay men and lesbians working to
gether is weird, because- we've already
defined ourselves as wanting to associate
with members of our own sex," Hanrahan
said.
Lesbians have special concerns, according
to Hanrahan, because they're oppressed both
as women and as homosexuals. Most lesbians
are feminists, she said, so the Women's Col
lective sponsors a lot of feminist events that
may not be specifically lesbian. This differs
from GLAS as a whole, which van Gaalen said
"is politically non-partisan. We have right- as
well as left-wingers, Catholics, Protestants
and Jews."
The feminist community at Stanford is sup
portive of lesbians, said Hanrahan. The
women of GLAS hold their weekly meetings
at the Women's Center because it is wheel
chair accessible, unlike the Old Firehouse.
Hanrahan estimated that 40 women show up
each week to discuss a pre-arranged topic.
The men meet separately, "not because
we don't like each other," said van Gaalen,
"but because of differences between the
men's and women's groups." He estimated
that 100 men attend the weekly "socials,"
which have no structured discussion, but are
"an alternative to a bar environment." There
is no loud music, so the men can talk, and a
policy not to serve alcohol, said van Gaalen,
although he admitted that beer occasionally

finds its way into the refrigerator.
Other constituent groups of GLAS are the
Gay and Lesbian Counseling Group, the Stan
ford Gay and Lesbian Speakers Bureau, and
two Stanford gay and lesbian alumni associa
tions. There are also gay and lesbian associa
tions for law, business and medical students.
Koskovich said that each of these groups
provides outreach for a particular interest,
while GLAS is a central place for coordina
tion, programming and referral.
GLAS also involves itself in politics when it
seems appropriate. Recently, GLAS has not
engaged in large-scale canvassing, voter
registration or publicity campaigns because
there have not been political issues toward
which such action would be appropriate, one
GLAS member explained.
The group often lobbies for its interests on
a smaller scale by meeting with Stanford ad
ministrators, circulating petitions and sending
letters to congressmen.
Most recently, the steering committee
sent letters to congressmen, senators, Presi
dent Reagan and the National Institutes of
Health, calling for the Center for Disease
Control (CDC) to disseminate money it had

been allocated for AIDS education.
According to Steering Committee member
Jeff Zaimman, the CDC had been holding the
money for an extended period of time without
taking action because it could not bring itself
to talk about safe sex in a straightforward
manner.
In 1985, GLAS sent letters to every mem
ber of the California Legislature and to Gov.
George Deukmejian urging the adoption of
ABI, a bill to prohibit discrimination based on
sexual orientation. The bill, passed by the
Legislature, was finally vetoed by Deuk
mejian.
According to its members, GLAS's main
role is not political. "The unifying issue for
members of GLAS is that lesbian and gay
people should be able to pursue the same
type of fulfillment in life as their non-gay
counterparts, Zaimman said. "When politics
touches on that, then we should get involved
in those political issues."
"GLAS is a non-partisan organization,"
Koskovich said. "Our members have ranged
from socialists to anarchists to conservative
Republicans, (and) ... we don't feel that our
membership should be restricted to a political
party."
GLAS, he added, also has to work within
University rules, which limit political activism
by campus groups in order to preserve Stan
ford's tax-exempt status.
