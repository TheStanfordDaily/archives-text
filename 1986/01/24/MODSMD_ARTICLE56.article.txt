### LESLIE KAUFMAN 
Stanford Alumni Association offi
cials say they are optimistic about
accepting the application for charter
membership of what would become
the first gay/lesbian club in the or
ganization.
The Stanford Gay and Lesbian
Alumni Club (SGLA), an informal
San Francisco-based group
composed primarily of Stanford
alumni, has been meeting for three
years.
SGLA began petitioning the
Alumni Association last June for a
charter membership. The group's
first application was denied for
technical reasons, when members
of SGLA refused to disclose a full
list of their membership for files at
the Bowman Center. This listing of

a club's members is a standard re
quirement for receiving a charter
from the Alumni Association.
Since SGLA failed to obtain a
charter last spring, a representa
tive of the club has been working
with Carolyn Manning, director of
clubs at the Alumni Association, in
hopes of devising an acceptable al
ternative to having members'
names on file.
Carol Bounds, a representative
of the Alumni Association, said,
"We approve and support the idea
of a gay and lesbian club, but we
have been hesitant to make excep
tions to the rules for acquiring a
charter. As it is, the association
now has close to 100 clubs, and if we
started to make exceptions things
could become very confused."
Ninety percent of any group with
Alumni Association charter group

status must be Stanford alumni.
If a group's application is ac
cepted, a club receives special
benefits from the Alumni Associa
tion, including staff support and
fund holding.
SGLA President Jim Haas said he
is hopeful that the technical details
will be solved after working with
Manning.
If SGLA's petition is approved,
the club still will keep a low-key
image, continuing normal activities,
according to Haas.
"We like to get together two or
three times of the year; we usually
invite a speaker. It is a congenial
type of thing. Also SGLA serves as
a vehicle for alumni, who previously
haven't been involved in alumni and
University affairs since they
graduated, to reconnect with the
University," he said.
