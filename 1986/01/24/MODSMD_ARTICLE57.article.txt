# Gay Men & Lesbians
## Allied in some battles but fighting different wars 
### LESLIE KAUFMAN 
A "serious communication gap"
has developed between gay
and lesbian groups on campus
due to past dissension about the di
rection of the Gay and Lesbian Alli
ance at Stanford (GLAS), said
David Herrera, a senior in anthro
pology and a member of GLAS.
The Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford (GLAS) developed from
the Gay People's Union founded in
1972 as an organization whose pri
mary role, most current members
agree, is a social one for both gay
and lesbian students.
GLAS aims to create a comforta
ble community for gay people on
the Stanford campus. It is a place
where gay people may meet one
another.
GLAS also has a political function
in which men and women who have
different social groups but the same
goals may get together and take ac
tion. The primary goal is, of course,
the furthering of gay rights.
"From the outset, men and
women involved in GLAS
recognized that, though their ex
periences were different, their
oppression came from the same
sources. That explains the practice
within GLAS of having separate
men's and women's groups which
work together on problems of

mutual concern, such as rights ad
vocacy," according to Gerard Kos
kovich, a graduate student in art
history and GLAS archivist.
Although sharing similar goals,
male and female members of GLAS
have often disagreed.
Herrera said, "Just as
heterosexuals often have
stereotypes about gay people, gay
men often have stereotypes about
lesbians and lesbians about gay
men. There is a lot of education
that can and should be done on both
parts to dispel these misun
derstandings."
As the gap between men and
women seemed to increase, GLAS
gained a campus reputation of being
essentially male-dominated. The
GLAS Steering Committee, the
group that makes GLAS's program
ming decisions, is open to anyone
who wants to be on it but has only
two or three women out of the
about 10 full-time members.
This occurrence also reflects the
reluctance of women to get in
volved in GLAS. Senior Noel Han
rahan, one of the two women on
GLAS's Steering Committee, said,
"Since historically GLAS has been
predominantly male, women
haven't seen it as a place for them."
More than just the problem of
male dominance in numbers, Han
rahan said that lesbians felt that
their concerns were being ignored

through an "unconscious bias."
The lesbian political agenda in
some cases has been seen as
broader than the male con
cerns. "Lesbians have to deal with a

double oppression. We have to deal
with both prejudices against gay
people and prejudices against
women," Hanrahan explained.
Many women said they prefer or

ganizations that are more sympa
thetic with their feminist political
concerns. Freshman Joyce Adams
agreed with other woman on
GLAS's Steering Committee,
saying, "Less women get involved
with a group like GLAS because
they can serve their purposes by
getting involved in feminist activi
ties."
Herrera said he agrees that
women have other ways of getting
to know each other and therefore
have less need to be associated
with GLAS.
"The lesbian community tends to
be smaller than the gay community
and they have different networks
and routes for meeting each other,"
he said.
Recently though, there has been
an effort, especially on the part of
men at GLAS, to be more aware of
women's concerns, according to
Herrera. "Take lesbian awareness
week. That is a good example of
some of the events that we have
been trying to plan to help bridge
the gap," he said.
Hanrahan said she remains opti
mistic about GLAS's future. "I
think now gay men are really trying
t<s be sensitive to women's issues
and to incorporate more activities
that would attract women," she
said.
GLAS has stated that it plans to
keep overt political action to a mini

mum, while working hard on civil
rights, because there is no
"monolithic gay political opinion." A
broader political program might
alienate members of GLAS with dif
fering viewpoints, some fear.
GLAS, however, hopes to in
crease programming that will be of
interest to women. Higher sensitiv
ity toward women's concerns will
be on the agenda for the whole or
ganization.
GLAS planners said they hope in
creased programs for women will
increase female participation in the
organization. Integration of lesbians
and gay men, however, is not
planned essentially because GLAS
was founded on the supposition that
the male and female groups would
be separate but supportive.
"There is a tendency on the part
of the press and the outside to see
the division of GLAS not as a natu
ral coalition but as divisiveness and
I think on the whole this is false.
The extent to which the coalition of
men's and women's groups has
been successful has to be measured
in terms of the organization's ac
complishments," Koskovich said.
"More than any other university
that I have visited, the gay and les
bian students at Stanford have
created a strong community and
have had an impact on the con
sciousness of the University as a
whole," Koskovich added.
