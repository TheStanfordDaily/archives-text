Rhio Hiersch has seen a great
deal of change in the gay and lesbian
movement since he first became a
part of it here as a freshman in
1977. Still, he said that the trans
formation that has gone on in the
Bay Area and in California generally
since 1948 does not necessarily
translate into a national sweep, nor
does the fact that things are chang
ing mean that things have gotten
better for gays everywhere.
"The gay liberation movement is
just getting off the ground in some
places," Hiersch said. "It's had set
backs and it's struggling, and
everywhere you look there's some
thing new and different going on."
The gay and lesbian movement
began in the U.S. in the first half of
the century with sporadic efforts by
a few scattered individuals who felt
it was better to strike a blow for
their freedom than to remain hid
den. The growth of the movement
in Germany and Great Britain in the
period between 1850 and 1939 had
a significant impact on people like
Henry Gerber, an immigrant from

the Weimar Republic who founded
the first gay organization in the
United States in the '20s.
As soon as the United States
entered World War 11, the military
realized that a large number of the
men it was recruiting were
homosexuals. It began to explicitly
designate these men as
homosexuals and to discharge them
in growing numbers, and this overt
classification of homosexuals as a
minority gave many among them a
sense of identity they had never
possessed before, according to Sai
vatore Licata's "Historical
Perspectives on Homosexuality."

Combined with the general dis
ruption of social patterns that the
war engendered, the classification
process helped make the '40s
become a decade of heightened
awareness and community
mindedness among gays, Licata
wrote.
The end of the war was the
catalyst for the translation of this
awareness into collective attempts
at organizing. The rise of the gay
bar was an especially important fac
tor in the creation of an under
ground community during the late
forties.
Although the threat of a police
raid hovered in the air at each bar,
the patrons faced it as a group —
forming a heretofore non-existent
sense of solidarity and confidence
that fueled later organizing at
tempts, Licata wrote.
John D'Emilio's "Sexual Politics,
Sexual Communities" highlighted a
second important factor in the
heightening of gay awareness
during this period: the publication of
Alfred Kinsey's studies on male and
female sexuality in 1948 and 1953.
These reports redefined the
beliefs Americans held about their
sexuality in all its facets, but they

particularly challenged the way the
public at large thought about
homosexuality.
Kinsey wrote that he was com
pletely unprepared for the findings
he made about the incidence of
homosexuality among males.
"Whether the histories were
taken in one large city or another,
whether they were taken in large
cities, in small towns, or in rural
areas, whether they came from one
college or another, a church school
or a state university or some
private institution, whether they
came from one pail of the country
or another, the incidence data on

the homosexual have been more or
less the same," Kinsey wrote.
"Persons with homosexual his
tories are to be found in every age
group, in every social level, in
every conceivable occupation, in
cities and on farms, and in the most
remote areas of the country," he
added.
Among Kinsey's findings were
the fact that half of the men he sur
veyed admitted erotic responses to
their own sex. He also found that
37 percent had had at least one post
adolescent same-sex experience
leading to orgasm, and that 4 per
cent were exclusively homosexual
throughout adulthood.
The proportions for lesbians
were smaller (28 percent of the
women surveyed admitted erotic
responses to their own sex), but
still revealed that the lesbian
minority was a significant one.
Kinsey was also responsible for
the famous conclusion that 10 per
cent of the American public
routinely participates in
homosexual activity.
Kinsey's findings sparked in
dignation among the heterosexual
community, but also the recognition
— for the first time, in most cases
— among the homosexual commu
nity that they actually made up a
sizable segment of the U.S. popula
tion, according to Licata.
This recognition was echoed in
the prospectus that launched the
first post-war gay organization, the
Bachelors of Wallace, in 1948.
Harry Hay, a co-founder of the
group and a Stanford undergraduate
in the early '30s, wrote that the
purpose of the group was "to dem
onstrate by our efforts that our
physiological and psychological
handicaps need be no deterrent in
integrating 10 percent of the
world's population towards the con
structive social progress of
mankind."
Hay and his compatriots
developed a structure for these
miniature organizations based on
that of the leftist political groups
they had belonged to in the '30s,
a model of cell-like secrecy that
helped the quick foundation of
similar groups in urban gay ghettos
all over the country. No figures on
how many people attended the
meetings of these groups are
available, but by the spring of 1953
meetings were being held in San
Diego, San Francisco, Berkeley,
Oakland, New York City and
Chicago.
By the end of the '50s, three
major gay organizations had come
into existence, all based in Califor
nia, but with branches in major
cities across the country — the
Mattachine Society, ONE Inc. and
the Daughters of Bilitis (the first
lesbian organization).
Two major blows for gay rights
— the dismissal of solicitation

charges against a Mattachine co
founder in 1952, and a 1958 Su
preme Court decision lifting a ban
on the distribution of ONE Inc.'s
magazine — gave the small commu
nity added confidence in its ability
to organize effectively against dis
criminatory legislation.
Despite these victories, the
number of people willing to join
these so-called "homophile" organi
zations never exceeded 250 at any
given time.
The '60s saw a perceptible
shift in the focus of gay organiza
tions, from an early emphasis on
education and information to a more
activist stance inspired by the suc
cesses of the black civil rights
movement. Small bands of demon
strators began cropping up at
events in major cities, and picketing
around Philadelphia's Independence
Hall on July 4 became an annual
event for gays.
Civil rights, however, were still
not granted homosexuals except in
highly isolated and publicized cases.
Police brutality was still a major
point of contention between gays
and the heterosexual community,
and when the police raided the
Stonewall Inn in the summer of
1969, what had previously been
fought in the courts spilled out onto
the streets.
Two detectives and a few other
officers hit the bar at midnight on
June 28, ostensibly to arrest the
bartenders for operating a liquor
joint without a license. As the police
began leading people out — not
only the bartenders, but a
housewife, some lawyers who were
there to protect the bar's interests,
and a handful of drag queens who'd
been dancing onstage — a scene
quite different than they had an
ticipated broke out on the sidewalk.
The housewife put up a struggle.
The scene suddenly became
chaotic. "Limp wrists were forgot
ten," the Village Voice reported.
"Beer cans and bottles were
heaved at the windows and a rain of
coins descended on the cops. . . .
Almost by signal the crowd erupted
into cobblestone and bottle
heaving."
The police barricaded them
selves inside the bar to wait for
reinforcements, and almost imme
diately the crowd uprooted a
parking meter and used it to try to
batter down the door. They then
proceeded to throw a lit can of
gasoline into the bar.
Reinforcements eventually came
for the police, but that was not the
end of it. Rioting continued for
three more days as a crowd of gays
outnumbering the police five to one
heaved sacks of wet garbage and
concrete blocks at police cars and
rushed officers who tried to subdue
fleeing drag queens.
Large numbers of young people
were attracted to the countercul

tural gay movement; over 10,000
people marched on Central Park to
commemorate the first anniversary
of the Stonewall riot.
The new movement used tactics
its predecessors would have never
used. The summer after Stonewall
saw an enormous march of several
thousand gay men and lesbians
from Times Square to Greenwich
Village in reaction to a series of bar
raids. Meetings of psychiatric as
sociations were disrupted by men
dancing around in dresses and
shouts of "Genocide!" when a
paper on aversion therapy for
homosexuals was read.
Politicians campaigning for office
were interrupted by gay
liberationists who leapt in front of
the news cameras to demand that
the politicians address issues of gay
rights.
The '70s saw the gay
liberation movement consolidate it
self behind issues of general con
cern. The defeats came. Anita
Bryant, a former Miss America
runner-up, said in a 1978 magazine
interview that gays should be
locked up for at least 20 years
if they were convicted of a
homosexual act. "Any time you
water down the law, it just makes it
easier for immorality to be
tolerated," she said. "Why make it
easier for them? They'll have plenty
of time to think (about salvation) in
prison."
Not long after Bryant made those
statements, she led a campaign to
overturn a Dade County, Florida
law granting equal opportunities in
employment to gays. The law was
overturned on the June ballot by a
2-to-l margin.
The victories, however, also
came. A similar initiative by Califor
nia state senator John Briggs for
the November ballot — one ban
ning gays from teaching in public
schools — was overturned by a
2-to-l margin.
More emphasis was placed on
negotiation than on radical activism
to achieve progress during the
seventies , even though the gay
community could still demonstrate
its collective anger if provoked, as
it did in May 1979 when a San Fran
cisco jury gave Dan White a sen
tence of manslaughter for killing
Mayor George Moscone and Super
visor Harvey Milk.
Hiersch, 26, was a sophomore
when White shot Milk and Moscone.
He is now an alumnus channeling
his energies into facilitating a small
gay youth group centered around
discussing the problems of growing
up gay in what Hiersch terms a
"hostile culture."
Even something as seemingly in
nocuous as the Peninsula Gay and
Lesbian Youth Group, which meets
every week in the Lutheran church

on Stanford Avenue, can be contro
versial in the eyes of some obser
vers.
Hiersch said he was amazed
when he saw the headline in the
Palo Alto Weekly: "Newspaper Ad
Causes Uproar." He said he had
routinely, a few weeks earlier, put
in a request that the Palo Alto High
School newspaper run an ad telling
readers they could seek out "fun,
friendship and support" in the youth
group.
The editors of the paper
"realized they had better get
permission" to run the ad from the
administration when they saw its
text, according to Hiersch. "The ad
had the full support of the
(newspaper) staff, the adviser and
the principal," Hiersch said.
The district's counsel said there
would be no legal problems with
running the ad, according to
Hiersch, but when word that the ad
would be published leaked out, a
"hubbub" resulted on campus.
Virginia Briggs, a substitute
teacher on campus at the time, was
concerned that "damage could be
done to young people" by the
group, Hiersch said.
Briggs brought up the issue at a
school board meeting.
She added that the ad could be a
"threat" to "unsure, unstable and
lonely" students.
Hiersch said that Melinda Sacks,
the writer of the Palo Alto Weekly
article, "got hold" of the issue and
"saw it as an opportunity to artifi
ciallv create an uproar."
The eventual outcome was a
review by the school board of the
advertising policy for school
papers. The issue was whether
there were any holes in the policy
that might allow tobacco and alcohol
companies to sue to have their ads
run in the paper if the youth group's
ad ran, according to Hiersch.
The district's counsel concluded
not, and the school board let the ad
vertising policy stand.
"They didn't see it as a gay issue
at all," Hiersch said. "They saw it
as merely an issue of being sure
that their advertising policy for high
school papers kept them from
having any liability against them."
"Others have switched the focus
of their energies to dealing with the
AIDS crisis, giving support to AIDS
victims and educating people
around the issue of AIDS," Hiersch
said.
While refusing to say that AIDS is

the issue of the '80s for the gay
community, Hiersch did not belittle
the impact that the disease has had
on the gay community, both locally
and nationally. Just as the ban on
the gay magazine ONE, Inc. gal
vanized the gay community in the
'50s, as the Stonewall riot in Green
wich Village did in the '60s, as the
leniency of the jury's decision
against Dan White did in the 70s,
Hiersch says that AIDS has
strengthened the gay community
and helped it mature as it responds
to a disease which has been killing
people in San Francisco at the rate
of two a day.
"I think our community is griev
ing for our loss," Hiersch said, "but
we are gaining strength and
working together better than we
have since the late '705."
He said the mounting prejudice
against gays, teenagers in Seattle
chasing gays with chains, nurses
leaving trays of food outside doors
of AIDS patients, authorities shut
ting down bathhouses, is only
driving more and more gays with
complexes about themselves to
endanger themselves and spread
the virus even more.
"There is a lot of unhappiness
and confusion among gay people
who have not dealt with their gay
ness in a positive fashion and who
are still suffering from internalized
homophobia and from the bullshit
that straight people have told them
about how bad they are," Hiersch
said.
"Those people are the ones who
are out there and who don't have
the self-respect to say, 'I have to
stop doing these things that
threaten my health.' These people
are often so certain that their life
style is leading them towards un
happiness that they become passive
about their sexuality and let it run
their lives mindlessly."
AIDS is a disease that by defini
tion creates dichotomies. Doctors
researching the disease are uncer
tain whether the disease is caused
by interrelated factors, which if
true would indict the way one leads
one's life, or by the HTLV-111 virus
alone, which if true would mean life
style would have nothing to do with
it.
Medical writer David Black calls
this dichotomy "an argument be
tween two world views" of what is
causing the immune systems of
once healthy men to collapse.
The dichotomy doesn't stop
there. The attitudes of the gay
community diverge on the issue of
AIDS as well.
A year after the San Francisco
gay community split in two over

whether the baths should be
closed, Larry Kramer, a co-founder
of the Gay Men's Health Crisis and
author of the controversial AIDS
play "The Normal Heart," said,
"Because of this epidemic, 25 mil
lion people are becoming more and
more invisible. The gay community
is more unorganized than ever. We
have no representation in Washing
ton, no lobbyists, no national organ
izations of any size or strength. An
epidemic of death, instead of pull
ing us together, is pushing us back
into the closet."
"I am ashamed of my fellow gay
man," Kramer said. "He's become
the sissy every straight man ever
said he was."
Harry Britt, the openly gay
member of San Francisco's Board
of Supervisors, had a different way
of looking at it. "There is so much
reality-denial in being gay," he said.
"We create personalities we don't
even recognize to present to the
world. But AIDS has called us to
reality. We've had to deal with
dying. We are a more mature com
munity, not a less sexual one.
We're a more united community."
Hiersch, while expressing op
timism about the future of activism
on campus and in the Bay Area (as
long as infighting is kept down to a
dull roar), is somewhat less cheer
ful about the nation as a whole.
"The homophobia in a place like
Las Vegas, which is the area I came
from, is virtually glutinous. The
community there is totally under
ground — very big and very quiet.
The last time I was there, which
was two years ago, they did not
have any kind of community voice
or newspaper, no kind of publica
tion to talk about what was happen
ing in the community and to the
people in the community, to com
plain about the treatment of the
police forces, to connect the people
in the community with each other in
an active way, and to get people in
volved.
"There was no organization, to
the best of my knowledge. I looked
for one. One that was doing any
thing in the way of trying to change
the antediluvian sexuality laws of
that state. There are people in the
state of Nevada in jail today for con
sensual homosexual acts with an
other adult. That's a medieval law.
It has no place in a civilized society,
where we have better things to be
doing with our law enforcement of
ficers than having them chase down
a couple of gay men who are having
a good time and not bothering
anybody."
