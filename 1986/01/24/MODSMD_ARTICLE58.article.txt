Rhio Hiersch has seen a great
deal of change in the gay and lesbian
movement since he first became a
part of it here as a freshman in
1977. Still, he said that the trans
formation that has gone on in the
Bay Area and in California generally
since 1948 does not necessarily
translate into a national sweep, nor
does the fact that things are chang
ing mean that things have gotten
better for gays everywhere.
"The gay liberation movement is
just getting off the ground in some
places," Hiersch said. "It's had set
backs and it's struggling, and
everywhere you look there's some
thing new and different going on."
The gay and lesbian movement
began in the U.S. in the first half of
the century with sporadic efforts by
a few scattered individuals who felt
it was better to strike a blow for
their freedom than to remain hid
den. The growth of the movement
in Germany and Great Britain in the
period between 1850 and 1939 had
a significant impact on people like
Henry Gerber, an immigrant from

the Weimar Republic who founded
the first gay organization in the
United States in the '20s.
As soon as the United States
entered World War 11, the military
realized that a large number of the
men it was recruiting were
homosexuals. It began to explicitly
designate these men as
homosexuals and to discharge them
in growing numbers, and this overt
classification of homosexuals as a
minority gave many among them a
sense of identity they had never
possessed before, according to Sai
vatore Licata's "Historical
Perspectives on Homosexuality."

Combined with the general dis
ruption of social patterns that the
war engendered, the classification
process helped make the '40s
become a decade of heightened
awareness and community
mindedness among gays, Licata
wrote.
The end of the war was the
catalyst for the translation of this
awareness into collective attempts
at organizing. The rise of the gay
bar was an especially important fac
tor in the creation of an under
ground community during the late
forties.
Although the threat of a police
raid hovered in the air at each bar,
the patrons faced it as a group —
forming a heretofore non-existent
sense of solidarity and confidence
that fueled later organizing at
tempts, Licata wrote.
John D'Emilio's "Sexual Politics,
Sexual Communities" highlighted a
second important factor in the
heightening of gay awareness
during this period: the publication of
Alfred Kinsey's studies on male and
female sexuality in 1948 and 1953.
These reports redefined the
beliefs Americans held about their
sexuality in all its facets, but they

particularly challenged the way the
public at large thought about
homosexuality.
Kinsey wrote that he was com
pletely unprepared for the findings
he made about the incidence of
homosexuality among males.
"Whether the histories were
taken in one large city or another,
whether they were taken in large
cities, in small towns, or in rural
areas, whether they came from one
college or another, a church school
or a state university or some
private institution, whether they
came from one pail of the country
or another, the incidence data on

the homosexual have been more or
less the same," Kinsey wrote.
"Persons with homosexual his
tories are to be found in every age
group, in every social level, in
every conceivable occupation, in
cities and on farms, and in the most
remote areas of the country," he
added.
Among Kinsey's findings were
the fact that half of the men he sur
veyed admitted erotic responses to
their own sex. He also found that
37 percent had had at least one post
adolescent same-sex experience
leading to orgasm, and that 4 per
cent were exclusively homosexual
throughout adulthood.
The proportions for lesbians
were smaller (28 percent of the
women surveyed admitted erotic
responses to their own sex), but
still revealed that the lesbian
minority was a significant one.
Kinsey was also responsible for
the famous conclusion that 10 per
cent of the American public
routinely participates in
homosexual activity.
Kinsey's findings sparked in
dignation among the heterosexual
community, but also the recognition
— for the first time, in most cases
— among the homosexual commu
nity that they actually made up a
sizable segment of the U.S. popula
tion, according to Licata.
This recognition was echoed in
the prospectus that launched the
first post-war gay organization, the
Bachelors of Wallace, in 1948.
Harry Hay, a co-founder of the
group and a Stanford undergraduate
in the early '30s, wrote that the
purpose of the group was "to dem
onstrate by our efforts that our
physiological and psychological
handicaps need be no deterrent in
integrating 10 percent of the
world's population towards the con
structive social progress of
mankind."
Hay and his compatriots
developed a structure for these
miniature organizations based on
that of the leftist political groups
they had belonged to in the '30s,
a model of cell-like secrecy that
helped the quick foundation of
similar groups in urban gay ghettos
all over the country. No figures on
how many people attended the
meetings of these groups are
available, but by the spring of 1953
meetings were being held in San
Diego, San Francisco, Berkeley,
Oakland, New York City and
Chicago.
By the end of the '50s, three
major gay organizations had come
into existence, all based in Califor
nia, but with branches in major
cities across the country — the
Mattachine Society, ONE Inc. and
the Daughters of Bilitis (the first
lesbian organization).
Two major blows for gay rights
— the dismissal of solicitation

charges against a Mattachine co
founder in 1952, and a 1958 Su
preme Court decision lifting a ban
on the distribution of ONE Inc.'s
magazine — gave the small commu
nity added confidence in its ability
to organize effectively against dis
criminatory legislation.
Despite these victories, the
number of people willing to join
these so-called "homophile" organi
zations never exceeded 250 at any
given time.
The '60s saw a perceptible
shift in the focus of gay organiza
tions, from an early emphasis on
education and information to a more
activist stance inspired by the suc
cesses of the black civil rights
movement. Small bands of demon
strators began cropping up at
events in major cities, and picketing
around Philadelphia's Independence
Hall on July 4 became an annual
event for gays.
Civil rights, however, were still
not granted homosexuals except in
highly isolated and publicized cases.
Police brutality was still a major
point of contention between gays
and the heterosexual community,
and when the police raided the
Stonewall Inn in the summer of
1969, what had previously been
fought in the courts spilled out onto
the streets.
Two detectives and a few other
officers hit the bar at midnight on
June 28, ostensibly to arrest the
bartenders for operating a liquor
joint without a license. As the police
began leading people out — not
only the bartenders, but a
housewife, some lawyers who were
there to protect the bar's interests,
and a handful of drag queens who'd
been dancing onstage — a scene
quite different than they had an
ticipated broke out on the sidewalk.
The housewife put up a struggle.
The scene suddenly became
chaotic. "Limp wrists were forgot
ten," the Village Voice reported.
"Beer cans and bottles were
heaved at the windows and a rain of
coins descended on the cops. . . .
Almost by signal the crowd erupted
into cobblestone and bottle
heaving."
The police barricaded them
selves inside the bar to wait for
reinforcements, and almost imme
diately the crowd uprooted a
parking meter and used it to try to
batter down the door. They then
proceeded to throw a lit can of
gasoline into the bar.
Reinforcements eventually came
for the police, but that was not the
end of it. Rioting continued for
three more days as a crowd of gays
outnumbering the police five to one
heaved sacks of wet garbage and
concrete blocks at police cars and
rushed officers who tried to subdue
fleeing drag queens.
Large numbers of young people
were attracted to the countercul

tural gay movement; over 10,000
people marched on Central Park to
commemorate the first anniversary
of the Stonewall riot.
The new movement used tactics
its predecessors would have never
used. The summer after Stonewall
saw an enormous march of several
thousand gay men and lesbians
from Times Square to Greenwich
Village in reaction to a series of bar
raids. Meetings of psychiatric as
sociations were disrupted by men
dancing around in dresses and
shouts of "Genocide!" when a
paper on aversion therapy for
homosexuals was read.
Politicians campaigning for office
were interrupted by gay
liberationists who leapt in front of
the news cameras to demand that
the politicians address issues of gay
rights.
The '70s saw the gay
liberation movement consolidate it
self behind issues of general con
cern. The defeats came. Anita
Bryant, a former Miss America
runner-up, said in a 1978 magazine
interview that gays should be
locked up for at least 20 years
if they were convicted of a
homosexual act. "Any time you
water down the law, it just makes it
easier for immorality to be
tolerated," she said. "Why make it
easier for them? They'll have plenty
of time to think (about salvation) in
prison."
Not long after Bryant made those
statements, she led a campaign to
overturn a Dade County, Florida
law granting equal opportunities in
employment to gays. The law was
overturned on the June ballot by a
2-to-l margin.
The victories, however, also
came. A similar initiative by Califor
nia state senator John Briggs for
the November ballot — one ban
ning gays from teaching in public
schools — was overturned by a
2-to-l margin.
More emphasis was placed on
negotiation than on radical activism
to achieve progress during the
seventies , even though the gay
community could still demonstrate
its collective anger if provoked, as
it did in May 1979 when a San Fran
cisco jury gave Dan White a sen
tence of manslaughter for killing
Mayor George Moscone and Super
visor Harvey Milk.
Hiersch, 26, was a sophomore
when White shot Milk and Moscone.
He is now an alumnus channeling
his energies into facilitating a small
gay youth group centered around
discussing the problems of growing
up gay in what Hiersch terms a
"hostile culture."
Even something as seemingly in
nocuous as the Peninsula Gay and
Lesbian Youth Group, which meets
