### MICHAEL NEWMAN Staff writer 
Education about AIDS at Stanford is
more accessible and more compre
hensive than at most other colleges in
the nation, according to representatives
from Cowell Student Health Center, the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
(GLAS) and Residential Education.
"Stanford has to be commended for being
in the lead of all the universities in the
country (in AIDS education)," said Jeff Zim
man, coordinator of the GLAS Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome education
project.

"I think it's fair to say thet we're ahead of
the game," added Doryn Davis-Chervin,
director of health promotion at Cowell.
"Other schools keep calling us."
AIDS education programs at Stanford are
numerous and varied. Last quarter Cowell
physicians traveled to dorms, GLAS spon
sored panel discussions and invited AIDS
experts to speak, and Cowell published an
issue of The Student Body entirely devoted
to >he epidemic.
One of the more effective programs was

the in-dorm showing of the recent KPIX-TV
special, "Our Worst Fear: The AIDS
Epidemic." After the presentation of the
documentary, physicians from Cowell an
swered students' questions and provided
up-to-date information about the disease.
A joint effort of Res Ed and Cowell, the
presentation reached almost 20 residences
last quarter. "There was really a lot of inter
est, " said Robin Hensley, program coordin
ator for Res Ed.
"It went over really well," said Randy
Joss, a resident assistant in Lagunita, where
the program was held last November. "In
general, I think most students were very ig
norant (about AIDS), " Joss noted. "This
presentation went a long way towards
changing that." About 50 students attended
the event at Lagunita, he said.
"Everyone is touched by AIDS," ex
plained Davis-Chervin. "And bringing these
programs into the dorms is what's impor
tant. The students really want information
about AIDS, and we provide it."
Davis-Chervin and her colleagues at
Cowell also published November's edition of
The Student Body, Cowell's quarterly in
sert into The Daily. The issue addressed
the AIDS problem from a number of differ
ent perspectives.
"The issue was very informative," Davis-
Chervin said. She also explained that it
reached a greater number of students than
the in-dorm presentations. "In that sense, it

was a more popular means of education,"
she said.
Reaction around campus to the publica
tion was very positive, according to Davis-
Chervin. "I thought that it was very well
done," said Zimman. Additional copies of
the insert are still available at Cowell.
In addition to these University-sponsored
activities, GLAS organizes many of its own
events, which are "always open to the gen
eral public," according to Zimman.
In fact, GLAS has been educating people
about AIDS "since the first moment anyone
ever noticed it," according to GLAS Ar
chivist Gerard Koskovich. GLAS held its
first AIDS-related public event in 1983.
Now, GLAS has several of its own pro
grams to inform the public about the
disease, and the group continues to co
sponsor programs with Res Ed and Cowell.
"We're trying to coordinate our programs
even more," Zimman said.
Last quarter, GLAS organized more than
half a dozen AIDS-related events: weekly
"rap sessions" with Cowell psychiatrist Dr.
Carlos Greaves, the presentation and dis
cussion of the documentary-in-progress
"Living With AIDS" by producer/director
Tina DiFeliciantonio, and other scheduled
presentations by Bay Area physicians.
Stanford's proximity to San Francisco,
with its large gay population and high level
of AIDS awareness, is "definitely a factor"
in the success of AIDS education here,

Davis-Chervin noted. "We're a few steps
ahead because a lot of the top research (on
AIDS) is done in the Bay Area."
Junior Noel Hanrahan, a member of the
GLAS Steering Committee who helped or
ganize this week's "AIDS: The Costs of Not
Caring" conference, agreed. "There are a
lot of AIDS experts in this area," she said,
adding that their availability helps GLAS
provide so much AIDS education on its lim
ited budget.
This week's conference was sponsored
mostly by the Human Biology Program, al
though GLAS "helped out with information,
planning and money," said Hanrahan. The
brown-bag lunch discussions were spon
sored solely by GLAS.
And GLAS will continue to sponsor pro
grams throughout the year, according to
Zimman. "We plan to continue with our own
education and to reach out into the commu
nity even more," he said.
Davis-Chervin at Cowell and Hensley at
Res Ed plan to continue their efforts, also.
"As information about AIDS changes — and
it does daily — we will accommodate,"
said Davis-Chervin. "We'll try to assess
the students' needs and respond."
Res Ed's Hensley had similar sentiments.
Although there is "no specific program set
up" this quarter, the "AIDS: Our Worst
Fear" videotape will be available, according
to Hensley. "This issue is not going to just
go away," she said.

physicians traveled to dorms, GLAS spon
sored panel discussions and invited AIDS
experts to speak, and Cowell published an
issue of The Student Body entirely devoted
to >he epidemic.
One of the more effective programs was

the in-dorm showing of the recent KPIX-TV
special, "Our Worst Fear: The AIDS
Epidemic." After the presentation of the
documentary, physicians from Cowell an
swered students' questions and provided
up-to-date information about the disease.
A joint effort of Res Ed and Cowell, the
presentation reached almost 20 residences
last quarter. "There was really a lot of inter
est, " said Robin Hensley, program coordin
ator for Res Ed.
"It went over really well," said Randy
Joss, a resident assistant in Lagunita, where
the program was held last November. "In
general, I think most students were very ig
norant (about AIDS), " Joss noted. "This
presentation went a long way towards
changing that." About 50 students attended
the event at Lagunita, he said.
"Everyone is touched by AIDS," ex
plained Davis-Chervin. "And bringing these
programs into the dorms is what's impor
tant. The students really want information
about AIDS, and we provide it."
Davis-Chervin and her colleagues at
Cowell also published November's edition of
The Student Body, Cowell's quarterly in
sert into The Daily. The issue addressed
the AIDS problem from a number of differ
ent perspectives.
"The issue was very informative," Davis-
Chervin said. She also explained that it
reached a greater number of students than
the in-dorm presentations. "In that sense, it

was a more popular means of education,"
she said.
Reaction around campus to the publica
tion was very positive, according to Davis-
Chervin. "I thought that it was very well
done," said Zimman. Additional copies of
the insert are still available at Cowell.
In addition to these University-sponsored
activities, GLAS organizes many of its own
events, which are "always open to the gen
eral public," according to Zimman.
In fact, GLAS has been educating people
about AIDS "since the first moment anyone
ever noticed it," according to GLAS Ar
chivist Gerard Koskovich. GLAS held its
first AIDS-related public event in 1983.
Now, GLAS has several of its own pro
grams to inform the public about the
disease, and the group continues to co
sponsor programs with Res Ed and Cowell.
"We're trying to coordinate our programs
even more," Zimman said.
Last quarter, GLAS organized more than
half a dozen AIDS-related events: weekly
"rap sessions" with Cowell psychiatrist Dr.
Carlos Greaves, the presentation and dis
cussion of the documentary-in-progress
"Living With AIDS" by producer/director
Tina DiFeliciantonio, and other scheduled
presentations by Bay Area physicians.
Stanford's proximity to San Francisco,
with its large gay population and high level
of AIDS awareness, is "definitely a factor"
in the success of AIDS education here,

Davis-Chervin noted. "We're a few steps
ahead because a lot of the top research (on
AIDS) is done in the Bay Area."
Junior Noel Hanrahan, a member of the
GLAS Steering Committee who helped or
ganize this week's "AIDS: The Costs of Not
Caring" conference, agreed. "There are a
lot of AIDS experts in this area," she said,
adding that their availability helps GLAS
provide so much AIDS education on its lim
ited budget.
This week's conference was sponsored
mostly by the Human Biology Program, al
though GLAS "helped out with information,
planning and money," said Hanrahan. The
brown-bag lunch discussions were spon
sored solely by GLAS.
And GLAS will continue to sponsor pro
grams throughout the year, according to
Zimman. "We plan to continue with our own
education and to reach out into the commu
nity even more," he said.
Davis-Chervin at Cowell and Hensley at
Res Ed plan to continue their efforts, also.
"As information about AIDS changes — and
it does daily — we will accommodate,"
said Davis-Chervin. "We'll try to assess
the students' needs and respond."
Res Ed's Hensley had similar sentiments.
Although there is "no specific program set
up" this quarter, the "AIDS: Our Worst
Fear" videotape will be available, according
to Hensley. "This issue is not going to just
go away," she said.
Education about AIDS at Stanford is
more accessible and more compre
hensive than at most other colleges in
the nation, according to representatives
from Cowell Student Health Center, the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
(GLAS) and Residential Education.
"Stanford has to be commended for being
in the lead of all the universities in the
country (in AIDS education)," said Jeff Zim
man, coordinator of the GLAS Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome education
project.

"I think it's fair to say thet we're ahead of
the game," added Doryn Davis-Chervin,
director of health promotion at Cowell.
"Other schools keep calling us."
