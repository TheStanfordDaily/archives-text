# Taking the bars
## 
### SCOTT KENNETH SAN FILIPPO Staff Writer 
The social scene for gays in San
Francisco and also for Stanford
students revolves around bars like
the I-Beam, shown at right.

Dancing. Drinking. Going to a
bar in Palo Alto. Or San Jose.
Or San Francisco. Or per
haps just getting a few friends to
gether to party in the dorm. Sounds
like a usual night out? It is.
And, not surprisingly, it
describes a night out for
homosexuals as much as it does for
heterosexuals, according to several
members of the Stanford gay and
lesbian community.
On campus, the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanford (GLAS) spon
sors parties and dances as well as
discussion groups that meet during
the week. Both
the men's and
women's
meetings start
with a discussion
about current
events or topics
relevant to the
gay community.
The men's
group, held Wed
nesday nights at
Tresidder Union,
lasts until mid
night, becoming
less formal after 9 p.m.
"It's a good study break," said
Jeff, a Stanford sophomore. "You
see a lot of friends. It's really well
supported."
Breaking that barrier to go to the
GLAS meetings is sometimes the
hardest part for gays and lesbians at
Stanford. Many find it unexpectedly
difficult to take the first step. Once
they do, however, they find a
warm, open community that gives
them a "network of friends."
"Probably a lot of people who
walk by on Wednesday night who
wish they could be there, don't
come up the stairs," said Jeff. "It
took me until February of my fresh
man year to actually walk up the
steps."
Darby Hoover, a 1985 Stanford
graduate, also hesitated before at
tending her first GLAS meeting. "I
was scared of a community that
already had bonds," she said. "But I
found that many of the people there
were friends I knew anyway."
The bar scene is very popular
with the gay community. Finding a
bar where you can feel comfortable
being gay, however, is sometimes
hard, according to Gerard Kos

kovich, a graduate in art history and
archivist at GLAS. He has been in
volved in the gay social scene in and
around Stanford for nine years.
"Gay people need specific ter
ritories where they can be them
selves, express their feelings and
feel comfortable doing so. You don't
want to go to a place and be ha
rassed," he said.
One local "straight" rightspot
that gays frequently visit is the
New Varsity Theatre on University
Avenue, Koskovich said. He des
cribed the people there as "more
open" and more likely to respect
gay customers.
Many local places do not have
that same comfortable feeling. At
one restaurant, Koskovich and his
friend were so bothered by custom
ers at another table that they asked
the waitress to call a manager. She
refused.
Other incidents of harassment
are often provoked by large groups

of adolescent males out to prove
their "machismo," especially in the
presence of their girlfriends, ac
cording to Koskovich.
Probably the most popular gay
hot spot near Stanford is B-Street
in San Mateo, mentioned by almost
every person interviewed. In a
scene usually dominated in num
bers by men, B-Street has an even
mix of both men and women. A sep
arate bar is provided upstairs for
women, although men and women
are not necessarily separated. B-
Street offers an alternative for gays
who do not feel like driving all the
way to San Francisco nightclubs,
for Palo Alto's few men's clubs
cater mainly to an older, more blue
collar type of clientele.
Another popular hangout,
Desperado's in Campbell, also has
an even ratio of men and women.
The clientele is young, and Kos
kovich describes the bar as a sym
bol of the changing gay outlook.

Desperado's opens when the mall in
which it is located closes. Its large
front windows overlook an enor
mous parking lot.
"It used to be that you would
sneak in the back door of a gay
club," Koskovich said, "Now we
have a club in the middle of a shop
ping center, with huge windows
facing the street. It says a lot about
the open feeling of the gay commu
nity."
Senior Noel Hanrahan agrees.
"Going to a gay club is getting a lot
'chicer,' " she said.
A major factor in gay life at Stan
ford is having San Francisco
nearby. Not only does it offer
several clubs, as well as a very ac
tive and open gay community, but it
also allows those gays and lesbians
not yet "out" on campus to get
away occasionally.
The I-Beam, a popular San Fran
cisco club to many students, for
merly was an all-gay bar every

night of the week. Now the I-Beam
is a straight bar every night except
Sunday, when the club sponsors a
Tea Dance, which the club
promotes in many gay newspapers.
Just as in the heterosexual bar
scene, there are several gay bars
known as cruise bars or pick-up
clubs. One of those, The Stud, was
described as the "quintessential
San Francisco bar." Nearly 20
years old, The Stud is one of the
city's most established gay bars and
pick-up spots.
Most of the time, however, the
gay men and women travel to the
bars with their friends to see other
friends, dance or just meet new
people.
"Going out is a positive identity
builder," said Koskovich. It puts
gays in touch with other gays,
making them feel less alone and
more secure about their feelings
that might otherwise be
suppressed.

ers at another table that they asked
the waitress to call a manager. She
refused.
Other incidents of harassment
are often provoked by large groups

of adolescent males out to prove
their "machismo," especially in the
presence of their girlfriends, ac
cording to Koskovich.
Probably the most popular gay
hot spot near Stanford is B-Street
in San Mateo, mentioned by almost
every person interviewed. In a
scene usually dominated in num
bers by men, B-Street has an even
mix of both men and women. A sep
arate bar is provided upstairs for
women, although men and women
are not necessarily separated. B-
Street offers an alternative for gays
who do not feel like driving all the
way to San Francisco nightclubs,
for Palo Alto's few men's clubs
cater mainly to an older, more blue
collar type of clientele.
Another popular hangout,
Desperado's in Campbell, also has
an even ratio of men and women.
The clientele is young, and Kos
kovich describes the bar as a sym
bol of the changing gay outlook.

Desperado's opens when the mall in
which it is located closes. Its large
front windows overlook an enor
mous parking lot.
"It used to be that you would
sneak in the back door of a gay
club," Koskovich said, "Now we
have a club in the middle of a shop
ping center, with huge windows
facing the street. It says a lot about
the open feeling of the gay commu
nity."
Senior Noel Hanrahan agrees.
"Going to a gay club is getting a lot
'chicer,' " she said.
A major factor in gay life at Stan
ford is having San Francisco
nearby. Not only does it offer
several clubs, as well as a very ac
tive and open gay community, but it
also allows those gays and lesbians
not yet "out" on campus to get
away occasionally.
The I-Beam, a popular San Fran
cisco club to many students, for
merly was an all-gay bar every

night of the week. Now the I-Beam
is a straight bar every night except
Sunday, when the club sponsors a
Tea Dance, which the club
promotes in many gay newspapers.
Just as in the heterosexual bar
scene, there are several gay bars
known as cruise bars or pick-up
clubs. One of those, The Stud, was
described as the "quintessential
San Francisco bar." Nearly 20
years old, The Stud is one of the
city's most established gay bars and
pick-up spots.
Most of the time, however, the
gay men and women travel to the
bars with their friends to see other
friends, dance or just meet new
people.
"Going out is a positive identity
builder," said Koskovich. It puts
gays in touch with other gays,
making them feel less alone and
more secure about their feelings
that might otherwise be
suppressed.

The social scene for gays in San
Francisco and also for Stanford
students revolves around bars like
the I-Beam, shown at right.

Dancing. Drinking. Going to a
bar in Palo Alto. Or San Jose.
Or San Francisco. Or per
haps just getting a few friends to
gether to party in the dorm. Sounds
like a usual night out? It is.
And, not surprisingly, it
describes a night out for
homosexuals as much as it does for
heterosexuals, according to several
members of the Stanford gay and
lesbian community.
On campus, the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanford (GLAS) spon
sors parties and dances as well as
discussion groups that meet during
the week. Both
the men's and
women's
meetings start
with a discussion
about current
events or topics
relevant to the
gay community.
The men's
group, held Wed
nesday nights at
Tresidder Union,
lasts until mid
night, becoming
less formal after 9 p.m.
"It's a good study break," said
Jeff, a Stanford sophomore. "You
see a lot of friends. It's really well
supported."
Breaking that barrier to go to the
GLAS meetings is sometimes the
hardest part for gays and lesbians at
Stanford. Many find it unexpectedly
difficult to take the first step. Once
they do, however, they find a
warm, open community that gives
them a "network of friends."
"Probably a lot of people who
walk by on Wednesday night who
wish they could be there, don't
come up the stairs," said Jeff. "It
took me until February of my fresh
man year to actually walk up the
steps."
Darby Hoover, a 1985 Stanford
graduate, also hesitated before at
tending her first GLAS meeting. "I
was scared of a community that
already had bonds," she said. "But I
found that many of the people there
were friends I knew anyway."
The bar scene is very popular
with the gay community. Finding a
bar where you can feel comfortable
being gay, however, is sometimes
hard, according to Gerard Kos

kovich, a graduate in art history and
archivist at GLAS. He has been in
volved in the gay social scene in and
around Stanford for nine years.
"Gay people need specific ter
ritories where they can be them
selves, express their feelings and
feel comfortable doing so. You don't
want to go to a place and be ha
rassed," he said.
One local "straight" rightspot
that gays frequently visit is the
New Varsity Theatre on University
Avenue, Koskovich said. He des
cribed the people there as "more
open" and more likely to respect
gay customers.
Many local places do not have
that same comfortable feeling. At
one restaurant, Koskovich and his
friend were so bothered by custom
ers at another table that they asked
the waitress to call a manager. She
refused.
Other incidents of harassment
are often provoked by large groups

of adolescent males out to prove
