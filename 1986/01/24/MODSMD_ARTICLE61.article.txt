"Gay Liberation" awaits in
stallation on campus.

vandalized the sculpture with a
ballpeen hammer two weeks after
it was installed.

✓ ✓ tanford is apparently willing to rec
ognize and celebrate sexual perver
sion with a sickening four-figure
sculpture, 'Gay Liberation,' " a Stanford
alumnus wrote in a March, 1984 letter to The
Stanford Observer.
"No wonder Stanford cannot win football
games," he added.
George Segal's "Gay Liberation"
sculpture, located at the northern end of
Lomita Mall, west of the Mathematics De
partment and east of Varian Laboratories,
consists of four white patinated bronze fig
ures. Two males stand side by side, one
man's hand resting on the other's shoulder,
while two females sit on a park bench with
one woman's hand on the knee of the other.
"It (the sculpture) em
bodies Segal's extraordi
nary sensitivity in interpret
ing human feelings through
body language. This
sculpture also shows his
strong formal sense, which
imparts to his surfaces and
composition a harmony
drawing from the rich heri
tage of the best modern
painting and sculpture,"
Law Prof. John Merryman,
chairman of the University's
Panel of Outdoor Art, said
in a statement preceding the sculpture's in
stallation on Feb. 21, 1984.
Commissioned for $150,000 by the Mildred
Andrews Fund of New Orleans in 1979 in
memory of the 1969 Stonewall riot, in which
gay groups in New York's Greenwich Village
demonstrated against routine police harass
ment, the sculpture has had trouble finding a
home, and has been the subject of contro
versy and the victim of vandalism here at
Stanford.
According to a spokesman from the Sidney
Janis Gallery in New York, Segal made two
sculptures from an original plaster cast. The
plaster cast was sold to a museum in Japan
several years ago.
One of the sculptures, originally intended
for Sheridan Square in New York, is currently
on exhibition in Madison, Wise.
Bruce Voeller of the Mariposa Foundation
in Los Angeles hoped to take the other
sculpture to Los Angeles. When those plans
fell through, the Mildred Andrews Fund of
fered the sculpture to the San Francisco Arts
Commission, which was considering placing
the sculpture in Harvey Milk Plaza, named for
the homosexual San Francisco supervisor
who was killed by Dan White in 1978.
While San Francisco considered the
sculpture, Peter Putnam of the Mildred
Andrews Fund offered to loan it to Stanford.
According to Art Prof. Albert Elsen, "It

would stay here until such time as the city of
San Francisco would install it in Harvey Milk
Plaza, and if it didn't happen, it would remain
at Stanford."
It appears that the sculpture is here to
stay, at least for the time being.
"The subject really hasn't come up for a
while," said Michael Bell, assistant director of
the San Francisco Arts Commission.
"Technically, we can't do anything about it
until somebody proposes it to us formally."
The installation of "Gay Liberation" at
Stanford brought a mixed response.
At the time of the installation, Merryman
said, "Segal is of the international stature of
the major modern sculptors already
represented on this campus, and the pres
ence of his work will do us an honor."
Members of the gay community remember
welcoming the statue for its symbolic value.
"Just having it here would represent more
open attitudes toward homosexuality, or
more important than that, just awareness
that gay people do exist," recalled Wilfred
Williams, a member of the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanford (GLAS). "It has good
shock value for a lot of people."
Others, however, did not welcome the
sculpture. In a letter to University President
Donald Kennedy on May 21, 1984, Stanford
alumnus Karl Amelang wrote, "In having this
sculpture on campus, Stanford officially in
forms the public that not only does Stanford
tolerate homosexuality, Stanford endorses
this deviant behavior. Frankly, this decision
by the leadership of Stanford makes me ill."
The evening of March 6, 1984, two weeks
after the sculpture's installation, a vandal
struck it with a hammer 40 times. The vandal
has never been caught.
The statue was removed and repaired,
then replaced in Lomita Mall.
GLAS reacted to the vandalism by holding
a speak-out, and supporters placed flowers
and posters on the empty pedestal.
Third-year law student Mark Dupont, a
GLAS spokesman, recalled, "I felt like I per
sonally had been attacked. The Segal
sculpture is important to me in that it's a sym
bol of love and affection among gay people."
Dupont added, "I wish there had been
more of a recognition by the University that
that kind of vandalism is a reflection of a
greater homophobia which many people at
the University have."
GLAS Steering Committee member Noel
Hanrahan had similar recollections. "My im
mediate reaction to the sculpture vandalism
was one of deep disappointment and realiza
tion that even here at Stanford we are not
safe," she said.
"During the aftermath of the Segal
sculpture vandalism I was both touched and
disappointed with the University's
response," Hanrahan recalled. "On the one
hand, I appreciate their acceptance of the
statue and its prompt reinstallation. But on
the other hand, I was disappointed with the

lack of follow-through on prosecution of those
individuals who verbally and physically
threaten us."
But despite the attack, and the controver
sial nature of the piece, it appears that "Gay
Liberation" will remain at Stanford.
"I'm extremely fond of it and attached to it

as a piece of sculpture," said Art Prof. Wanda
Corn. "I hope we don't lose it. I think it's a
wonderful addition to Stanford."
"It's been a pretty long time since there's
been any aggression (toward the sculpture),"
said Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington
said. "I think it's become a non-issue."

ment, the sculpture has had trouble finding a
home, and has been the subject of contro
versy and the victim of vandalism here at
Stanford.
According to a spokesman from the Sidney
Janis Gallery in New York, Segal made two
sculptures from an original plaster cast. The
plaster cast was sold to a museum in Japan
several years ago.
One of the sculptures, originally intended
for Sheridan Square in New York, is currently
on exhibition in Madison, Wise.
Bruce Voeller of the Mariposa Foundation
in Los Angeles hoped to take the other
sculpture to Los Angeles. When those plans
fell through, the Mildred Andrews Fund of
fered the sculpture to the San Francisco Arts
Commission, which was considering placing
the sculpture in Harvey Milk Plaza, named for
the homosexual San Francisco supervisor
who was killed by Dan White in 1978.
While San Francisco considered the
sculpture, Peter Putnam of the Mildred
Andrews Fund offered to loan it to Stanford.
According to Art Prof. Albert Elsen, "It

would stay here until such time as the city of
San Francisco would install it in Harvey Milk
Plaza, and if it didn't happen, it would remain
at Stanford."
It appears that the sculpture is here to
stay, at least for the time being.
"The subject really hasn't come up for a
while," said Michael Bell, assistant director of
the San Francisco Arts Commission.
"Technically, we can't do anything about it
until somebody proposes it to us formally."
The installation of "Gay Liberation" at
Stanford brought a mixed response.
At the time of the installation, Merryman
said, "Segal is of the international stature of
the major modern sculptors already
represented on this campus, and the pres
ence of his work will do us an honor."
Members of the gay community remember
welcoming the statue for its symbolic value.
"Just having it here would represent more
open attitudes toward homosexuality, or
more important than that, just awareness
that gay people do exist," recalled Wilfred
Williams, a member of the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanford (GLAS). "It has good
shock value for a lot of people."
Others, however, did not welcome the
sculpture. In a letter to University President
Donald Kennedy on May 21, 1984, Stanford
alumnus Karl Amelang wrote, "In having this
sculpture on campus, Stanford officially in
forms the public that not only does Stanford
tolerate homosexuality, Stanford endorses
this deviant behavior. Frankly, this decision
by the leadership of Stanford makes me ill."
The evening of March 6, 1984, two weeks
after the sculpture's installation, a vandal
struck it with a hammer 40 times. The vandal
has never been caught.
The statue was removed and repaired,
then replaced in Lomita Mall.
GLAS reacted to the vandalism by holding
a speak-out, and supporters placed flowers
and posters on the empty pedestal.
Third-year law student Mark Dupont, a
GLAS spokesman, recalled, "I felt like I per
sonally had been attacked. The Segal
sculpture is important to me in that it's a sym
bol of love and affection among gay people."
Dupont added, "I wish there had been
more of a recognition by the University that
that kind of vandalism is a reflection of a
greater homophobia which many people at
the University have."
GLAS Steering Committee member Noel
Hanrahan had similar recollections. "My im
mediate reaction to the sculpture vandalism
was one of deep disappointment and realiza
tion that even here at Stanford we are not
safe," she said.
"During the aftermath of the Segal
sculpture vandalism I was both touched and
disappointed with the University's
response," Hanrahan recalled. "On the one
hand, I appreciate their acceptance of the
statue and its prompt reinstallation. But on
the other hand, I was disappointed with the

lack of follow-through on prosecution of those
individuals who verbally and physically
threaten us."
But despite the attack, and the controver
sial nature of the piece, it appears that "Gay
Liberation" will remain at Stanford.
"I'm extremely fond of it and attached to it

as a piece of sculpture," said Art Prof. Wanda
Corn. "I hope we don't lose it. I think it's a
wonderful addition to Stanford."
"It's been a pretty long time since there's
been any aggression (toward the sculpture),"
said Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington
said. "I think it's become a non-issue."

George Segal's "Gay Liberation"
sculpture, located at the northern end of
