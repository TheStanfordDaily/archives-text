# Scientists question the questions

### RICHARD WALTER Staff writer 
One by-product of the increasing
strength of the gay community is a
growing awareness of possible re
search abuses into the causes of
homosexuality, especially in the
fields of psychology and biology.
A recent study entitled "Sexual
Preference," conducted by re
searchers at the prestigious Alfred
C. Kinsey Institute for Sex Re
search, is one piece of such work
which has come into question.
The authors of the study, Alan
Bell, Martin Weinberg and Sue
Hammersmith, all professors at In
diana University, are aware of the
intricacies of their subject matter.
They even start their study by
trying to anticipate future criticism.
They state, "First, we believe
that any parsimonious and valid sci
entific explanation must account for
the rule as well as the exception.
That means any satisfactory theory
of sexual orientation must explain
with equal ease both the majority
pattern, heterosexuality, and the
less common homosexual pattern."
The Psychological Approach
The Kinsey study sets out to test
many of the prominent psychologi
cal theories about the origins of
sexual preference by analyzing
people's memories about their
childhoods. The data for the study
were drawn from interviews con
ducted in the years 1969 and 1970
with 979 homosexual and 477 het
erosexual men and women who
lived in the San Francisco Bay
Area.
Question-, in the interview cov
ered relationships with mothers,
fathers and siblings, feelings about
gender conformity, experiences
outside the family circle, and child
hood and adolescent sexuality.
The authors note in the introduc
tion that the use of the memories of
those interviewed is problematic.
Specifically, they comment that
these facts from the past can be dis
torted or recounted inaccurately.

The Method is the Message
The method of analysis used to
compile the results of the inter
views is known as "path analysis,"
which in the authors' words "is a
means of analyzing the ways in
which a large number of
'independent' variables might in
terrelate and ultimately have a
direct or indirect effect on a
'dependent' variable — in this case
sexual preference. ... By follow
ing along the paths between
variables in the path diagram, we
can see the causal chains that link a
given independent variable with the
dependent one."
Path analysis was originally
developed for use in the biological
sciences, not for psychology,
however. Critics of this study point
out that any kind of causal chain dis
covered by this research can only
be established by the personal
speculation of the authors based on
their subjects' recollections.
The jump made here to guess
work was a major criticism of the
work, though. "They replaced one
set of problems with another," said
Sharon Matteo, a visiting scholar it,
the Psychology Department. She
commented that the researchers
seem to shuffle the research off into
another direction — biology —
rather than taking a comprehensive
look at the problems that the aut
hors themselves noted in the intro
duction to the study.
A statement following the Kinsey
report's conclusion also
presupposes which sexual prefer
ence parents woi 1 prefer their
children to posstss, supporting
Matteo's accusations of bias.
It states, "You may supply your
sons with footballs and your
daughters with dolls, but no one can
guarantee that they will enjoy
them. What we seem to have identi
fied — given that our model applies
only to extant theories and does not
create new ones — is a pattern of
feelings and reactions within the
child that cannot be traced back to a
single social or psychological root;
indeed homosexuality may arise
from a biological precursor (as do

left-handedness and allergies, for
example) that parents cannot con
trol. In short, to concerned par
ents, we cannot recommend any
thing beyond the care, sympathy
and devotion that good parents
presumably lavish on all their
children anyway."
Matteo questions the fundamen
tal approach of research like this.
"The question should be, "What
kinds of questions should we be
asking?' Or, 'To what extent do our
biases color what questions we
ask?' " Matteo said.
"The question needs to be
turned around. 'Why do we have
rampant heterosexuality?' We al
ways ask what is wrong with the
homosexual," Matteo said.
The Biological Approach
Research into sexual preference
is carried out through many disci
plines, including biology. Much of
the biological research has focused
on the possible influence of
hormones in determining sexual
preference.
Research carried out by Brian
Gladue, R. Green and R. Hellman
tested reactions of different groups
to injections of estrogen.
Estrogen is a female hormone,
which is thought to play a substan
tial role in the menstrual cycle.
The conclusions stated that the
study's group of homosexual men
had a hormone response pattern
midway between that of heterosex
ual men and heterosexual women.
Yet, the neutrality of this re
search is debated by psychologists
who question whether the science
of biology can adequately treat is
sues dealing with a person's sexual
preference.
"By locating their research
within the context of pursuing 'a bi
ological explanation of
homosexuality' and characterizing
their findings as inviting 'the idea
that there may be physiological de
velopment componenents in the
sexual orientation of some
homosexual men,' Gladue et al.
reveal two important assumptions.
First, they imply that

heterosexuality needs no explana
tion. Second, focusing exclusively
on a biological approach obscures
an important, alternative interpre
tation of the data," said Gregory
Herek of the Yale Department of
Psychology in a letter to Science
magazine, which published the
study in September of 1984.
Give Us Dirty Laundry
Another issue surrounding re
search into sexual preference is

how the results of research are pre
sented in the media. Alter the Kin
sey report, Sexual Preference, was
released, Newsweek magazine
reviewed the work under the title
"Gays are born, not made."
After Gladue published his
results, an Associated Press dis
patch stressed that the study found
"clear evidence of a biological dif
ference between homosexual and
heterosexual men . . . that may
have developed before birth."
Herek criticized this report and
warned that people reading press
reports of the study might be led to
doubt that psychology can play a
role in hormone response due to
the researchers' approach.
"As long as the status of
homosexual persons in the United

States remains a politically charged
topic, the very framing of a scien
tific research question will elicit
value-laden coverage from the
news media," Herek said.
Even Herek's field of psychology
is not safe.
"It is not surprising that there is
an increasing tendency among
homosexuals, especially those in
volved in the gay liberation move
ment, to view anything psychologi
cal, or even psychoanalytical, in an
extremely hostile light," noted Mar-

tin Dannecker, a researcher on
sexology at the University of
Frankfurt, in his book "Theories of
Homosexuality."
Junior Noel Hanrahan. a member
of the Steering Committee of the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stan
ford (GLAS) noted the danger that
research can cause for the gay com
munity.
"As a minority community we are
particularly vulnerable to public
policy decisions which often result
from social science research," she
said. "Historically, this research
has been influenced by prevailing
cultural prejudices. Hence we must
be particularly thorough when
analyzing methodology and conclu
sions of any study of our commu
nity."

these facts from the past can be dis
torted or recounted inaccurately.

The Method is the Message
The method of analysis used to
compile the results of the inter
views is known as "path analysis,"
which in the authors' words "is a
means of analyzing the ways in
which a large number of
'independent' variables might in
terrelate and ultimately have a
direct or indirect effect on a
'dependent' variable — in this case
sexual preference. ... By follow
ing along the paths between
variables in the path diagram, we
can see the causal chains that link a
given independent variable with the
dependent one."
Path analysis was originally
developed for use in the biological
sciences, not for psychology,
however. Critics of this study point
out that any kind of causal chain dis
covered by this research can only
be established by the personal
speculation of the authors based on
their subjects' recollections.
The jump made here to guess
work was a major criticism of the
work, though. "They replaced one
set of problems with another," said
Sharon Matteo, a visiting scholar it,
the Psychology Department. She
commented that the researchers
seem to shuffle the research off into
another direction — biology —
rather than taking a comprehensive
look at the problems that the aut
hors themselves noted in the intro
duction to the study.
A statement following the Kinsey
report's conclusion also
presupposes which sexual prefer
ence parents woi 1 prefer their
children to posstss, supporting
Matteo's accusations of bias.
It states, "You may supply your
sons with footballs and your
daughters with dolls, but no one can
guarantee that they will enjoy
them. What we seem to have identi
fied — given that our model applies
only to extant theories and does not
create new ones — is a pattern of
feelings and reactions within the
child that cannot be traced back to a
single social or psychological root;
indeed homosexuality may arise
from a biological precursor (as do

left-handedness and allergies, for
example) that parents cannot con
trol. In short, to concerned par
ents, we cannot recommend any
thing beyond the care, sympathy
and devotion that good parents
presumably lavish on all their
children anyway."
Matteo questions the fundamen
tal approach of research like this.
"The question should be, "What
kinds of questions should we be
asking?' Or, 'To what extent do our
biases color what questions we
ask?' " Matteo said.
"The question needs to be
turned around. 'Why do we have
rampant heterosexuality?' We al
ways ask what is wrong with the
homosexual," Matteo said.
The Biological Approach
Research into sexual preference
is carried out through many disci
plines, including biology. Much of
the biological research has focused
on the possible influence of
hormones in determining sexual
preference.
Research carried out by Brian
Gladue, R. Green and R. Hellman
tested reactions of different groups
to injections of estrogen.
Estrogen is a female hormone,
which is thought to play a substan
tial role in the menstrual cycle.
The conclusions stated that the
study's group of homosexual men
had a hormone response pattern
midway between that of heterosex
ual men and heterosexual women.
Yet, the neutrality of this re
search is debated by psychologists
who question whether the science
of biology can adequately treat is
sues dealing with a person's sexual
preference.
"By locating their research
within the context of pursuing 'a bi
ological explanation of
homosexuality' and characterizing
their findings as inviting 'the idea
that there may be physiological de
velopment componenents in the
sexual orientation of some
homosexual men,' Gladue et al.
reveal two important assumptions.
First, they imply that

heterosexuality needs no explana
tion. Second, focusing exclusively
on a biological approach obscures
an important, alternative interpre
tation of the data," said Gregory
Herek of the Yale Department of
Psychology in a letter to Science
magazine, which published the
study in September of 1984.
Give Us Dirty Laundry
Another issue surrounding re
search into sexual preference is

how the results of research are pre
sented in the media. Alter the Kin
sey report, Sexual Preference, was
released, Newsweek magazine
reviewed the work under the title
"Gays are born, not made."
After Gladue published his
results, an Associated Press dis
patch stressed that the study found
"clear evidence of a biological dif
ference between homosexual and
heterosexual men . . . that may
have developed before birth."
Herek criticized this report and
warned that people reading press
reports of the study might be led to
doubt that psychology can play a
role in hormone response due to
the researchers' approach.
"As long as the status of
homosexual persons in the United

States remains a politically charged
topic, the very framing of a scien
tific research question will elicit
value-laden coverage from the
news media," Herek said.
Even Herek's field of psychology
is not safe.
"It is not surprising that there is
an increasing tendency among
homosexuals, especially those in
volved in the gay liberation move
ment, to view anything psychologi
cal, or even psychoanalytical, in an
extremely hostile light," noted Mar-

tin Dannecker, a researcher on
sexology at the University of
Frankfurt, in his book "Theories of
Homosexuality."
Junior Noel Hanrahan. a member
of the Steering Committee of the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stan
ford (GLAS) noted the danger that
research can cause for the gay com
munity.
"As a minority community we are
particularly vulnerable to public
policy decisions which often result
from social science research," she
said. "Historically, this research
has been influenced by prevailing
cultural prejudices. Hence we must
be particularly thorough when
analyzing methodology and conclu
sions of any study of our commu
nity."
One by-product of the increasing
strength of the gay community is a
growing awareness of possible re
search abuses into the causes of
homosexuality, especially in the
fields of psychology and biology.
A recent study entitled "Sexual
Preference," conducted by re
searchers at the prestigious Alfred
C. Kinsey Institute for Sex Re
search, is one piece of such work
which has come into question.
The authors of the study, Alan
Bell, Martin Weinberg and Sue
Hammersmith, all professors at In
diana University, are aware of the
intricacies of their subject matter.
They even start their study by
trying to anticipate future criticism.
They state, "First, we believe
that any parsimonious and valid sci
entific explanation must account for
the rule as well as the exception.
That means any satisfactory theory
of sexual orientation must explain
with equal ease both the majority
pattern, heterosexuality, and the
less common homosexual pattern."
The Psychological Approach
The Kinsey study sets out to test
many of the prominent psychologi
cal theories about the origins of
sexual preference by analyzing
people's memories about their
childhoods. The data for the study
were drawn from interviews con
ducted in the years 1969 and 1970
with 979 homosexual and 477 het
erosexual men and women who
lived in the San Francisco Bay
Area.
Question-, in the interview cov
ered relationships with mothers,
fathers and siblings, feelings about
gender conformity, experiences
outside the family circle, and child
hood and adolescent sexuality.
The authors note in the introduc
tion that the use of the memories of
those interviewed is problematic.
Specifically, they comment that
these facts from the past can be dis
torted or recounted inaccurately.
