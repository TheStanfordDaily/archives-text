						brief summary of popular theories attempting to explain homosexuality
## 
### 
• Intersexuality
Proponents of this theory claim that homosexual
and bisexual individuals have physical features of
both sexes. The theory was popular among turn-of
the-century psychologists, depite the fact that it
fails to account for the 99 percent of homosexuals
who have normal anatomical attributes.
• Hereditary Determinant
Speculation surrounding "gay genes" has led at
various times to attempts to find consitutional char
acteristics of a hereditary type to explain
homosexuality. None of the work to date has dem
onstrated anything conclusively, and much of it has
been discredited within the scientific community for
sheer scientific ineptness.

• Seduction Theory
Psychologists searching for an explanation have
at times proposed that homosexuals are initiated
into their sexual orientation by older homosexuals.
Undemonstrated, this theory was discounted to a
great degree by the report of the Kinsey group
mentioned in the article.
• Segregation Theory
This theory, another of the psychological type,
proposes that homosexuals are individuals raised in
an atmosphere isolated from their own sex. As a
result, according to this theory, homosexuals take
on characteristics of the opposite sex, including
sexual preference. This theory has also been
refuted by the Kinsey group.
