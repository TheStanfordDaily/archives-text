Einstein was right. There really is no such
thing as an objective point of view.
The opinions and controversies surrounding
homosexuality demonstrate that idea all too well,
and members of the Stanford community, like
people everywhere, hold differing views about
the issue.
Members of the Stanford community are no
exception. Even the recognized campus groups
hold a variety of policies when it comes to
homosexuality. This variety only increases when
individual members of the groups are consulted
about their feelings.
Open the Doors and See All the People
The most vehement protests against
homosexuality traditionally come from religious
groups. Yet even these opinions are as hard-line
or as tolerant as the tenets of which they are a
part.
For instance, the entire Old Testament only
contains two references proscribing
homosexuality, and both of these refer only to
such activity between men. Because of this, the
Jewish faith does not prohibit sex between
women.
In addition, both of these verses (Leviticus
18:22, 20:13) refer to a man having intercourse
with a man as he would with a woman, an act
which is impossible for physiological reasons.
For this reason, some liberal rabbis interpret
these verses as proscribing something other
than homosexuality. "What. . .the verse is actu
ally proscribing is people engaging in acts in
which they are fooling themselves," said Rabbi
Ari Cartun of Stanford's Hillel.
An example of this, Cartun said, is "to lie with
a woman that you're not in love with as if you
were in love with her.
"If you want a woman, lie with a woman. Don't
lie with a man as you would with a woman," he
said, explaining his interpretation.
Christianity, on the other hand, takes the New
Testament into account when it says that,
". . .because they have not seen fit to acknowl
edge God, He has given them up to their own
depraved reason." (Romans 1:28)
According to the Rev. Russell Roide of Stan
ford's Newman Center, the Roman Catholic
Church considers homosexuality to be just one
aspect of the depravity human beings experience
when they turn away from God.
This idea that homosexuality is depraved and
unnatural leads to one of the most frequently
mentioned arguments against homosexuality.
Summarizing this argument, Roide said,
"However, it does not seem philosophically or
theologically sound to drop all notion of evil for
homosexual acts that occur in a stable relation
ship. For one thing, homosexual acts will never
be open to the specific value of the procreation of
children, a value without which humanity cannot
exist and accomplish its goals in this world."

"And yet, the best scientific evidence we have
is that one's sexual orientation is formed at an
extremely early age, probably in the first three
years of life. And what the Catholic Church es
sentially calls on us to do is deny the orientation
that we have come to have, and 1 find that tan
tamount to lying," said graduate student Mark
Dupont, a member of the Gay and Lesbian Alli
ance at Stanford (GLAS).
One must bear in mind, however, that the
Christian religion believes in brotherly love.
Roide summarized this very eloquently when he
said, "As far as the Catholic church is concerned,
its response to homosexuals should be to help
them understand themselves as part of the
people of God. Regardless of where one stands
on the morality of specific homosexual acts,

homosexual persons should have the ministry of
the Catholic Church always available to them,
and they must be accepted by all."
To Have and to Hold
Another very controversial issue concerning
homosexuality is that of homosexual marriage.
According to Dupont. "Gay and lesbian individ
uals do very much want to participate in that kind
of ceremony and have that kind of recognition
from people."
When asked if he would perform such a cere
mony, Robert Hamerton-Kelly, dean of the
chapel at Memorial Church, said, "Not in public.
And that is a prudential judgment.
"The politics of it are such that it would prob
ably, in my judgement, cause more damage to
the Church and to the Christian cause than is
warranted," he explained.
Richard Thayer, assistant dean of the chapel
at Memorial Church, said that he would perform
some sort of marriage-type ceremony, provided
that the homosexual couple involved went
through the same sort of "premarital" counseling
as he would ask of any heterosexual couple.
Cartun said he would agree with Hamerton-

Kelly, though he pointed out that in the Jewish
faith, an officiating rabbi is not required for the
ceremony of marriage.
"Jews marry each other, and rabbis have no
necessary function in any way. So, I would not
be denying them a ceremony; I would be denying
them my understanding of exactly what was
going on," he said.
"I do feel like homosexuality is wrong, but 1
feel also like it's no more wrong than sex outside
of marriage in general," said Intervarsity mem
ber Dave Lamb, a graduate student here.
"Lesbian and gay relationships have as much
commitment and as much love and joy as hetero
sexual couples do, and I'm sad that religious in
stitutions haven't taken more of a lead in ack
nowledging that," Dupont said.
The Politics of Homosexuality
In talking about homosexuality, some common
myths often arise. Among these is the idea that
homosexuals tend to be liberals more than con
servatives.
Junior Jason Matherly, president of the Stan
ford College Republicans, claims this is not the
case. "The homosexual activists that you see
certainly tend to be leftists because they tend to
be activists in any case," he said.
In response to Matherly's statement, sopho
more Mark Lemley, president of the Stanford
Democrats, said, "I think that's probably true at
Stanford a great deal. Nationally, I don't think
that's necessarily true."
Lemley went on to say that he thought that
there were probably gay members in the Stan
ford Democrats, though he would not hazard a
guess as to the percentage.
He said, however, that because he knew most
of the people involved, he felt relatively certain
that there were no homosexuals in the organiza
tion's active membership.
Brotherly Love
Another concern that comes up when discuss
ing homosexuality is the idea of "homophobia" —
or fear of homosexuality — among fraternities.
The general feeling among a random sampling
of Stanford's fraternities was that such paranoia
does not exist.
At the same time, however, the idea that fra
ternities are more susceptible to homosexuality
found adamant opposition among those who
were interviewed.
One fraternity president who wished to
remain anonymous said that because of the
macho image associated with fraternities, such
tensions and problems might exist, but would
not surface.
Senior Pierre King, president of Delta Kappa
Epsilon, said, "We don't get worked up about it."
Senior George Lemaitre, president of Kappa
Alpha, said, "There's no discrimination of any
kind, at all," within the fraternity.
He went on to say that he didn't think there
was much discrimination anywhere at Stanford.
"We didn't sleep through the '605," he said.
