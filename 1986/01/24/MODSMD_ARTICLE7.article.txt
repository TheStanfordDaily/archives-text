# The
						Quad's Yearly Renovation

### TAMAR SEIVER 
If the history of The Stanford Quad is anything
like the history of its namesake, the square
edged center of campus, then last year was its
equivalent of the 1906 earthquake.
This year, with the possible use of a laser scan
on some photos, the look of Stanford's yearbook
will be as solid as cobblestones and as profes
sional as stone-carved mosiacs.
In 1985, The Quad was plagued with complica
tions. The printed books arrived late from the
presses in North Carolina because of Amerian
Airlines' participation in an airline strike. Giving
priority to people on the few flights they did fly,
all the airline's shipping was a mess of long
delays.
Only 1,800 yearbooks had been sold when the
shipment of 2,600 arrived.
Murphy's Law came true when the bindings of
these books cracked.
Because the 1985 book was a centennial
issue, a special cover had been designed with
hand brushings. Kingsport Press, responsible
for the cover, had to repeat this process four
times before it was correct.
Losses added up with the necessary expense
of mailing the late books to buyers.
Also, by arriving late the 1985 book sale was
not able to take advantage of the nostalgia people

teel at trie end of spring quarter and at the end of
the year.
The billing price for the 1985 book was $29.
How did The Quad survive so many mishaps
well enough to put out any book at all this year?
The previous year's advertising had sold out,
causing leftover profits. Also, every every book
in that year's 2,600 press run sold the minute
they arrived spring quarter, taking advantage of

seniors' maximum nostalgia.
The 1986 yearbook is very different. There
have been many changes according to senior
David Nott, editor of the 1986 Quad.
The Quad has a new color enlarger and pro
cessor, both used in photo developing for clear,
precise color pictures.
In the black-and-white pictures, sharp con
trasts and artistic style should contribute better
quality to the book as a whole, he said.
By allowing more general photographic sub
missions from students, The Quad staff hopes to
represent a larger range of the undergraduate
population. They do take submissions and may
use the pictures after evaluating them.
Junior Alice Mo, the academic editor of this
year's Quad, hopes to put more copy into the
book in order to be more detailed.
Most importantly, the 1986 volume will be a
fall delivery book instead of a spring delivery.
This signifies many changes, the biggest of
which will be the inclusion of graduation pictures
and copy.
Instead of a November deadline, the staff will
meet a due date at the end of March, allowing
time to shoot more rolls of film. From a larger
selection, the pictures should be higher quality:
brighter, shinier and clearer, they say, explain
ing that having amassed more photos, editors
