# Symposium Explores Life With AIDS
## 
### LIZ EGAN Staff writer 
"For Bill, AIDS did not mean
the difficult adjustment to life with
AIDS, the political struggle to
protect the rights of people with
AIDS, the threat of mass
quarantine. For Bill, his family
and his friends, AIDS meant
death."
Last night was the first time
Anne Perkins spoke about the
death of her brother. Perkins, an
assistant at Stanford's Overseas
Studies Office, was one of the
speakers in the third part of
"AIDS Challenge: A Symposium
on AIDS."
Dr. Herant Katchadourian,
professor of psychiatry and
human biology, moderated the
event, which aimed to look at
AIDS on a personal level.
According to Katchadourian, a
difficult burden for AIDS patients
is the "leprosy mentality" exer
cised by observers of the victims.
One should view the disease "for

what it is, not for what we imag
ine it to be," he said.
Andrew Small, who was
diagnosed to have AIDS more
than three years ago, shared his
personal experiences. "At the
age of 30, I found myself faced
with my own mortality," he said.
But the most important thing
for Small was to try to get on with
his life. "AIDS is an ongoing cycle
... but I refused to allow this to
get to me," Small said.

Small, who was once ex
tremely weakened by the
disease, said he has now gained
enough strength to help other
AIDS victims. He answers calls
on an AIDS hotline and shares his
understandings with audiences
such as the large one last night in
Kresge Auditorium.
"Without a sense of hope, I feel
that life is a walking death. But,
with hope, there is life," Small
said.
During the symposium, the
winning essay in a contest called
"AIDS and Public Policy," spon
sored by the School of
Humanities and Sciences, was an
nounced. The combined effort of
four Graduate School of Business
students produced "The Social
Responsibility of Business." Ar
thur Brazy, Richard Doppelt, Mi
chael Mael and Dave Plough were
awarded $200, which they will
donate to an AIDS foundation.
Tomorrow evening's agenda
for the symposium will feature a
panel with Rep. William Dan
nemeyer (R.-Calif.),
