# Waltzing in Roble
## 
### MICHAEL NEWMAN Editorial staff 
Vienna came to Stanford Satur
day night, and approximately 350
formally dressed couples packed the
spectacularly decorated gym
nasiums and inner courtyard of the
Roble Athletic Complex in celebra
tion.
The Ninth Annual Viennese Ball
began with its opening ceremony at
8:30 and ended some five hours
later. Only then, after the Viennese
Bail Orchestra had played its final
waltz and Bill Hammett and his
Hyatt Regency Orchestra had tooted
their last notes, did some of the
couples begin to leave.

Feature

According to its organizers, this
year's Ball was exceptional. There
was little of the past years' over
crowding, which has made what's
supposed to be waltzing in Vienna
seem more like slam-dancing at the
Keystone.
"I thought the whole thing went
very well," said senior Kelly Spen
cer, a member of the Ball Commit
tee.
Spencer, who was in charge of the
program and ticket sales, noted that
not all 350 couples who bought tick
ets for the event actually attended.
That made for a less-crowded situa
tion, though not by much.
"There weren't that many no
shows," Spencer said. But she did
emphasize that the slightly smaller
crowd made it easier to dance.
Junior Lucia Eisner, another
member of the committee, agreed,
noting that fewer tickets were sold
for this year's Ball. "Things went
more smoothly this year."
The first Viennese Ball was held in
1977, when students returning from
the Stanford-in-Austria program
decided to bring a taste of Austria to
the Farm. About 350 students atten
ded the first Ball, which took place
in Toyon Hall.
Now, the Ball is almost twice the
size of that first one, and the Vien
nese Ball Committee — more than
80 members strong — begins plan
ning for the gala affair in Septem
ber.
Coordinator/Treasurer Kermit
Marsh, a junior, stressed the
amount of work that goes into the
Ball — and the amount of money.
Both this year were high, he said.
"Most of the money went into
equipment and facility rental, the
two musical groups, food and
printing costs," Marsh said. Al
though an exact figure is not yet
available, he estimated that the final
cost for the Ball will be "roughly
$15,000."
Usually, the Viennese Ball breaks
even, but this year it actually lost a
little money, Marsh said. He attrib
uted the losses to higher rental
costs.
And though this year's Viennese
Ball is only a day old — and still has
outstanding debts, according to
Marsh — some planners are already
beginning to think about next year.
"It'll be the tenth one, so it's
going to be special," Marsh noted.
Osborne mentioned the possibility
of holding the Ball in San Francisco,
or at least "a larger place, to accom
modate more people."
For the moment, though, most of
the students who were involved
with the event's planning are con

tent to rest for awhile. "I really
enjoyed myself at the Ball," Marsh
recalled. "The highlight of the even
ing, for me, was the opening cere
mony."
But Marsh was also at Roble until
10 a.m. yesterday cleaning up, and
he said "that wasn't a whole lot of
fun."
