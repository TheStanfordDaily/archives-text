# Quake hits Bay Area

### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff With wire reports 
An earthquake measuring 5.2
on the Richter scale rocked North
ern California yesterday, but
Stanford police said no damage or
injuries were reported locally.
The 11:20 a.m. quake was cen
tered in the San Andreas Fault
near Hollister, a small farming
town about 50 miles south of
Stanford in an area "quite seismi
cally active," according to Civil
Engineering Prof. James Gere, co
director of the Blume Earthquake
Engineering Center here.
A report issued by the state Of
fice of Emergency Services said
that there were no reported injur
ies in the state.
The quake was felt as far north
as San Francisco, as far southeast
as Fresno and as far south as San
Louis Obispo, according to An
thony Lomax of the UC-Berkeley
Seismograph Station.
In Stockton, 60 miles east of San
Francisco, residents said the
tremor splashed water out of

swimming pools and rattled chan
deliers.
The quake cannot be used to
predict future seismic activity, ac
cording to Gere, who said that an
other quake measuring about 4.3
was recorded last week near Hol
lister.
"This could be the end for a
while; there could be more like
this or there could be a bigger one.
You just can't tell," Gere said.
He added that the quake was
part of a series and not unusual.
The Richter scale is a means for
measuring the magnitude of an
earthquake, according to Gere.
The intervals increase logarithmi
cally, so an earthquake measuring
six is 10 times more powerful than
one measuring five and 100 times
more powerful than one measur
ing four, he explained.
The tremor was so powerful
that it broke a seismograph lo
cated near the engineering library
in the Terman Engineering Build
ing. The seismograph was finely
adjusted to record distant and
minor earthquakes and was over
powered by the relatively large
quake, Gere said.

The local U.S. Geological Sur
vey said the quake was of
"moderate size" and reported 29
minor aftershocks, the largest of
which measured 2.4, in the hour
and a half following the quake.
However, the Department of
Water Resources later reported a
tremor of 3.8 at 1:44 p.m., and the
state Office of Emergency Services
detected a 4.2 quake at 3:46 p.m.
The most serious property
damage was done to the Almaden
winery, located 11 miles south of
Hollister. A wine storage vat was
knocked loose from its founda
tion, spilling 20,000 gallons of red
wine.
Other vats sprung leaks, and
workers were ordered to leave the
building because of the threat of
collapse, according to California
Department of Forestry fire en
gineer Kelly Blake.
Three miles south of the town,
an oak tree fell over
crashed into an abandoned farm
house, according to Hollister
police dispatcher Liz Nelson.
However, Nelson added, Hol
lister "held together pretty well."
