## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Editor's introduction 
### 
Welcome to "Backshop." This is the place where
The Daily is pasted up.
It's 3 a.m. and most of you are sleeping. The
campus is still. But in Backshop, there is a feeling
of electricity as the finishing touches are put on The
Daily. The news editor cuts the last lines of a story.
The sports editor changes a misspelled coach's
name. The photo editor checks the cropping of the
last picture. And the editor or managing editor takes
a miniature rolling pin and rolls the page so every
thing sticks.
"Roll it." These are Backshop's favorite words.
With each exclamation of "roll it,"the paper is one
step closer to the printing press. One step closer to
you.
It's hard for me to convey the thrill that I feel when
The Daily is finished each night. It's excitement
mixed with a tinge of fear that some glaring error has
gone unnoticed. It's a feeling of collective ac
complishment: beginning writers, senior staff writ
ers, columnists, department editors, graphic artists
and members of the community have all made their
imprint on each Daily. It's the thrill of serving you
with a conglomeration of information and ideas — a
collage of what we at The Daily hope will not only in
form you, but stimulate thought and discussion
among you.
The thrill of The Daily is addictive. It is why we
stay up until all hours to produce this newspaper. . .
and why we do it again day after day. And when we
see the finished product, we feel proud that we have
given something to the Stanford community.
Of course, you are a part of this process. When I
see people reading The Daily on campus, I often
stare at the expressions on their faces (hopefully,
they're enthralled enough not to see me staring). Are
they learning? Laughing? Cursing? Delighted?
Enraged?
I see The Daily as a major Stanford bulletin board.

We need you to tack things up on the board to fill it
with things that are pertinent, intelligent,
provocative, entertaining. Write to us if you have an
opinion; call us if you have a tip. Better yet, write for
us and share in the process. The Daily is tailored to
bring the Stanford world to you; we need your par
ticipation to bring it to you the best we can.
People are the pulse behind the newspaper you
now hold in your hand. I think the people on the
staff this volume are some of the best I've known at
The Daily. But we need more people — you. Not
only is The Daily a place for people to grow and learn
as journalists, it's a fun place to work.
It's traditional for the incoming editor to
philosophize a little about what The Daily is and will
be. Usually, I'm not so traditional, which is why your
Daily looks different today. "I'll modernize it; make
it splashy," I told the staff. (Define splashy, Beth.
Does that mean it'll be wet? they asked.) We'll be
more trendy this volume in lay-out and typestyles.
However, the basic trends that The Daily strives for
will remain unchanged. We will continue in our
commitment to inform and educate you, and we will
continue to rely on your suggestions and reactions.
The Daily shapes the lives of the people who work
here. Daily photographers can't walk past anything
on campus without seeing it in the frame of a rectan
gle. Reporters' eyes and ears are extra-keen. Editors
can hardly read a newspaper without scanning it for
things related to Stanford. The Daily has changed
the way we look at things. We hope it does the same
for you.
As for Volume 189, I say with the optimism of
Daily Backshop right before the last page of an issue
is completed, and we know we'll see The Daily again
in print in six hours, "Roll it."
