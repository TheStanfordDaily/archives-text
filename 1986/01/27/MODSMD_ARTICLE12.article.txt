New constitution
Is unjust, racist
Vote "No" on the new constitu
tion. It is racist. If this new constitu
tion had been in effect in the past,
there would never have been a
single black graduate student
elected. Furthermore, only about
1 percent of the undergraduate
senators would have been black.
There would never have been a
Hispanic senator. The Daily and the
ASSU call this "more representa
tive." (This constitution was written
by an all-white ASSU team.)
It hurts graduate students. The
graduate districts are removed.
They were created because of the
horrible under-representation of
graduate students from small de
partments. Yet this constitution is
being sold as "more representa
tive." The number of graduate stu
dents who will participate in fund
ing decisions will be reduced from
20 to four. But somehow the elimi
nation of graduate districts and
seats will be "accommodated" with
"bylaws." This is completely sense
less. The Graduate Student Associa
tion was never contacted and still

has not been notified of this consti
tution.
It hurts student organizations.
The students last year voted to elim
inate the ASSU because it interfered
with student programming and kept
wiping out funds to groups recom
mended by the Program Board.
ASSU senators tried to kill funding
to black and Hispanic groups. This
didn't work.
Also, the senate body kept revers
ing program cuts by the appropria
tions committee. So the ASSU
power brokers decided to eliminate
"bureaucratic slowdowns" that
have plagued the student govern
ment in the past by eliminating the
Program Board and the senate body.

'Lifetime' review
was snide, unfair
No topic is more subject to violent
disagreement than the merits of dif
ferent movies. Everyone has their
favorite which everyone else hates,
and their abomination which every
one elso loves. I thus hesitate to
write a letter disagreeing with the

The Daily's movie reviewer. But I
was so astonished and baffled by
Steve Warrick's sarcasticly negative
review of "Twice in a Lifetime" (The
Daily, Jan. 23) and the effect it might
have on potential viewers of this
magnificent film, that I feel com
pelled to respond. Mr. Warrick is
obviously sick of the family-drama
genre of films. This has apparently
blinded him to the merits of the
most sensitive, intelligent and ma
ture films about divorce. "Twice
in a Lifetime" is a nice, low-key film
about nice, realistic people who end
up hurting each other without really
meaning to. The film expresses with
brilliant subtlety the essential truth
about divorce: that the best of inten
tions, even the fact that a marriage
has honestly ground to a dead end,
cannot ameliorate the blameless and
unavoidable pain that comes with
radically altering family relations.
For me, as for many Americans mv
age, divorce is not an alien
phenonemon. I found "Twice in a
Lifetime" to ring stunningly true. I
say to anyone who reads this: don't
pay attention to snidely dismissive
reviews. See it and judge for your
self.
