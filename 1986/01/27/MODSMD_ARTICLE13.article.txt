## Racist murals persuade no 
### 
I feel compelled to write in response to the current
controversy surrounding the 'Spirit of Hoover' mural
in Casa -'apata. I agree with L.H. Gann, Walter
Lammi, and the others that the mural is an unfair and
biased attack on the Hoover Institution (The Daily, Jan.
23 and 24). However, unlike Gann an Lammi, 1 feel that
the issue is much broader than this particular mural or
the relationship between the Hoover Institution and the
rest of the University. If one takes a leisurely tour of
Casa ''apata, one is confronted with a spectacle much
more significant that the one "Hoover" mural.
In the dining hall is a large mural of three characters.
The first is an elderly Hispanic woman whose hand is
apparently crippled by arthritis. While I certainly agree

TOM DE PAUL

that health care among the poor is not what it should
be, I do not agree that it is in good taste to confront stu
dents who are attempting to gain sustenance (in Stern,
no less) with such an unattractive countenance.
The second character is a "with it"and "hip" young
Hispanic woman. No problems there. But the third
character is a young Caucasian woman, who for some
reason, has no facial features. I believe that the racist
character of this mural is readily apparent. When one
leaves the dining hall, and by all means I would not
suggest that one spend too much time being assaulted
by this ridiculous "artwork," one should then walk
through the rest of Casa -'apata, spending extra time on
the artwork adorning the stairwells. At every turn,
strange images bombard one's conciousness. Under one
staircase is an image of a crouched Caucasian police offi
cer, gun in hand, ready to fire at whomever rounds the
corner in too much haste. Again, I believe this image
simply reflects the racism inherent in such artwork, and
the artists themselves.
Now 1 turn to a concern of a more practical nature.
Lammi, executive editor of the Hoover Institution,
writes that "the University should encourage

respectful debate among differing viewpoints —
however widely they differ." My response, of course, is
to agree. I would make one additional observation,
however. The students who attempt to enlighten the
rest of the student body on the "purported evils" of the
Hoover Institution, the "atrocities" occuring in South
Africa and the "crimes" being committed by the Reagan
Administration policy in Central America by painting
murals, building "shanty-towns" in White Plaza, or
participating in "sit-ins" in front of University President
Kennedy's office are actually doing the rest of us a fa
vor.
Not, of course, in the sense that they believe. No, the
favor they are doing for the University community is
choosing outlets for their political concern that make
them unacceptable to those who actually make policy,
whether that be University policy or U.S. foreign
policy. When I envision legitimate political interaction, I
think of people who volunteer their time to work on
phone banks or walk precints, and those who make fin
ancial contributions to candidates who espouse their
beliefs. Often, these people are chosen to advise these
candidates, who when successful, become
policymakers. This populist model of political behavior
is, of course, not the only one.
Others choose to become scholars, and when their
work comes to the attention of candidates, they are of
ten given advisory positions. Prof. Boskin's advisory
role to candidate Reagan in the 1980 campaign, and
Prof. Blacker's role as national security advisor to Gary
Hart's 1984 campaign are examples of this. Another is
the significant role of Hoover Institution scholars in the
two Reagan Administrations. I believe that those who
choose to voice their beliefs by building unattractive
cardboard housing in White Plaza, or by painting unat
tractive scenes on dormitory walls are not those who
will have substantial policy input. Rather, by behaving
in such a manner, they have virtually assured them
selves little or no voice in actual policymaking.
