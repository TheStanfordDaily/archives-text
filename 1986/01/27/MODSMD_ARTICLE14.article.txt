# Stanford lacks academic rigor

### 
Winter quarter finds me thinking of the same issue I
thought of at the end of fall quarter: the quality of Stan
ford as an undergraduate institution.
The results of a U.S. News & World Report survey of
college presidents across the nation propelled the issue
to the front of my mind. The survey results, published
in late November, placed Stanford at the top of the list
of the nation's major undergraduate universities for the
second consecutive year. Put simply, the presidents
considered Stanford the best undergraduate school in
the country. This comes as no suprise to most of us, as
we are accustomed to the tremendous respect accorded
Stanford.

Yet, the survey results spurred my thinking about
what type of school Stanford is. My thoughts, after
much vacillation, led me to this: The selection of Stan
ford as the top undergraduate institution reflects the
mediocrity of undergraduate education in this country,
assuming that the presidents' assessment is accurate.
Academically, Stanford has been a disappointment.
Let's consider the facts.
First the good things. Stanford is unquestionably a
top-notch research institution. Facilities, funding and
brilliant research professors are plentiful. In more than
one field, Stanford researchers are at the forefront of the
expansion of scientific knowledge. The faculty of the
Psychology Department, for example, reads like a
"Who's Who" of contemporary psychological theory
and research. And many of the professors are open to
student interaction, provided that the student is aggres
sive enough to initiate things.
Stanford also ranks high in terms of non-academic
aspects of the college experience. The campus is beauti
ful. The location, suburban yet reasonably close to San
Francisco and Oakland, yields both the benefits of being
in a big city and of being secluded. The weather is some
of the best in the country. All the facilities are top
quality.
Now for the bad things. In a general sense, the worst
thing about Stanford is its grading system. In most non
engineering and non-science classes, the grades are in
flated enormously, to the point where a B no longer
represents "good" or "above average" work but is
given for "adequate" or "average" work. For example,
in one class the instructor, after handing out a paper as
signment, assured us, "If you just do the assignment,
you'll get a B." As expected, almost everyone in the
class received (I won't say earned) either an A or a B,
both for that assignment and for the course.
In other classes, where the grading itself is not as
relaxed, the familiar and much-welcomed "curve" ad
justs scores so that the median is a B-, sometimes a B.
The idea of a curve is useful. The curve assures that stu
dents will not be penalized due to an overly difficult or
harshly graded exam. However, in practice the use of
curves has two serious shortcomings.
First, in most cases the median score is assigned a

grade of B or B-. Implicit in that is the belief that average
work by a Stanford student deserves, at the very least, a
B-. Second, the inclusion of the scores of both students
taking the class for a letter grade and those taking the
class pass/no credit in the computation of the curve in
flates grades.
We all know that pass/no credit classes are not treated
as seriously as classes taken for a grade. Consequently,
the students seeking a pass from the class will probably
fall in the bottom half of the score distribution. The
result is distortion of the scores of students taking the
class for a letter grade.
For example, a friend once calculated that in a large
economics class, because of the large number of stu
dents electing pass/no credit grading, one only had to be
in the top half of students taking the class for a letter
grade in order to receive (once again J won't say earn)
an A. As one senior said when asked about the rigor of
Stanford's grading system: "I've often gotten a Bin a
class without doing any work, and it shouldn't be like
that."
An integral component of Stanford's system of grade
inflation is the virtual prohibition of F's. An F or NC will
never appear on the transcript of any Stanford
graduate, no matter how deserving of F's that student's
performance may have been. Stanford generously gives
A's but absolutely refuses to give F's, as if the Univer
sity recognizes and rewards outstanding academic
achievement while ignoring dismal achievement.
While these features of Stanford's grading system are
so well entrenched that they seem normal and natural
to us, they appear unusual and incredibly easy to out
siders not accustomed to the Stanford system. Last
year, for instance, an exchange student from another
university remarked upon learning of Stanford's
grading system, "Stanford sure is hard to get into, but I
see that once you get here you can just coast to gradua
tion."
This is not to say that students do not excel here;
there are many motivated students who do quite excep
tional things. The point is that Stanford's academic
standards are ridiculously undemanding, certainly not
commensurate with the supposed caliber of the school.
As one first-year graduate student remarked, "Before I
came, I expected Stanford to be more than what it is.
Academically, it doesn't demand much of students, un
less one is into the sciences. I've met a lot of people here
who do hardly any work, yet they will still have a pres
tigious Stanford degree."
In the final analysis, the grading system results from
and reflects the prevailing elitist sentiment at Stanford.
Stanford students, the thinking goes, do not deserve F's
and should have the opportunity of not accepting
grades that are lower than they wish. The grading sys
tem practically ensures that students have reasonably
good grades, which, the thinking goes, is what Stanford
students deserve anyway.
What's the end result of Stanford's undemanding
grading system and low standards? A Stanford degree,
while a respected credential, does not guarantee as high
a level of intellectual performance as most people would
like to believe. If Stanford, as the college presidents
seem to think, is the top undergraduate institution in
the United States, then Stanford's success is, ironically,
a sad commentary on undergraduate education in this
country.

of the best in the country. All the facilities are top
quality.
Now for the bad things. In a general sense, the worst
thing about Stanford is its grading system. In most non
engineering and non-science classes, the grades are in
flated enormously, to the point where a B no longer
represents "good" or "above average" work but is
given for "adequate" or "average" work. For example,
in one class the instructor, after handing out a paper as
signment, assured us, "If you just do the assignment,
you'll get a B." As expected, almost everyone in the
class received (I won't say earned) either an A or a B,
both for that assignment and for the course.
In other classes, where the grading itself is not as
relaxed, the familiar and much-welcomed "curve" ad
justs scores so that the median is a B-, sometimes a B.
The idea of a curve is useful. The curve assures that stu
dents will not be penalized due to an overly difficult or
harshly graded exam. However, in practice the use of
curves has two serious shortcomings.
First, in most cases the median score is assigned a

grade of B or B-. Implicit in that is the belief that average
work by a Stanford student deserves, at the very least, a
B-. Second, the inclusion of the scores of both students
taking the class for a letter grade and those taking the
class pass/no credit in the computation of the curve in
flates grades.
We all know that pass/no credit classes are not treated
as seriously as classes taken for a grade. Consequently,
the students seeking a pass from the class will probably
fall in the bottom half of the score distribution. The
result is distortion of the scores of students taking the
class for a letter grade.
For example, a friend once calculated that in a large
economics class, because of the large number of stu
dents electing pass/no credit grading, one only had to be
in the top half of students taking the class for a letter
grade in order to receive (once again J won't say earn)
an A. As one senior said when asked about the rigor of
Stanford's grading system: "I've often gotten a Bin a
class without doing any work, and it shouldn't be like
that."
An integral component of Stanford's system of grade
inflation is the virtual prohibition of F's. An F or NC will
never appear on the transcript of any Stanford
graduate, no matter how deserving of F's that student's
performance may have been. Stanford generously gives
A's but absolutely refuses to give F's, as if the Univer
sity recognizes and rewards outstanding academic
achievement while ignoring dismal achievement.
While these features of Stanford's grading system are
so well entrenched that they seem normal and natural
to us, they appear unusual and incredibly easy to out
siders not accustomed to the Stanford system. Last
year, for instance, an exchange student from another
university remarked upon learning of Stanford's
grading system, "Stanford sure is hard to get into, but I
see that once you get here you can just coast to gradua
tion."
This is not to say that students do not excel here;
there are many motivated students who do quite excep
tional things. The point is that Stanford's academic
standards are ridiculously undemanding, certainly not
commensurate with the supposed caliber of the school.
As one first-year graduate student remarked, "Before I
came, I expected Stanford to be more than what it is.
Academically, it doesn't demand much of students, un
less one is into the sciences. I've met a lot of people here
who do hardly any work, yet they will still have a pres
tigious Stanford degree."
In the final analysis, the grading system results from
and reflects the prevailing elitist sentiment at Stanford.
Stanford students, the thinking goes, do not deserve F's
and should have the opportunity of not accepting
grades that are lower than they wish. The grading sys
tem practically ensures that students have reasonably
good grades, which, the thinking goes, is what Stanford
students deserve anyway.
What's the end result of Stanford's undemanding
grading system and low standards? A Stanford degree,
while a respected credential, does not guarantee as high
a level of intellectual performance as most people would
like to believe. If Stanford, as the college presidents
seem to think, is the top undergraduate institution in
the United States, then Stanford's success is, ironically,
a sad commentary on undergraduate education in this
country.

Winter quarter finds me thinking of the same issue I
thought of at the end of fall quarter: the quality of Stan
ford as an undergraduate institution.
The results of a U.S. News & World Report survey of
college presidents across the nation propelled the issue
to the front of my mind. The survey results, published
in late November, placed Stanford at the top of the list
of the nation's major undergraduate universities for the
second consecutive year. Put simply, the presidents
considered Stanford the best undergraduate school in
the country. This comes as no suprise to most of us, as
we are accustomed to the tremendous respect accorded
Stanford.

Yet, the survey results spurred my thinking about
what type of school Stanford is. My thoughts, after
much vacillation, led me to this: The selection of Stan
ford as the top undergraduate institution reflects the
mediocrity of undergraduate education in this country,
assuming that the presidents' assessment is accurate.
Academically, Stanford has been a disappointment.
Let's consider the facts.
First the good things. Stanford is unquestionably a
top-notch research institution. Facilities, funding and
brilliant research professors are plentiful. In more than
one field, Stanford researchers are at the forefront of the
expansion of scientific knowledge. The faculty of the
Psychology Department, for example, reads like a
"Who's Who" of contemporary psychological theory
and research. And many of the professors are open to
student interaction, provided that the student is aggres
sive enough to initiate things.
Stanford also ranks high in terms of non-academic
aspects of the college experience. The campus is beauti
ful. The location, suburban yet reasonably close to San
Francisco and Oakland, yields both the benefits of being
in a big city and of being secluded. The weather is some
of the best in the country. All the facilities are top
quality.
Now for the bad things. In a general sense, the worst
thing about Stanford is its grading system. In most non
