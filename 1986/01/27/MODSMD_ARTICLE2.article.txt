A three-alarm fire ravaged an Escondido
Village apartment yesterday afternoon,
causing $175,000 in damage, according to
Palo Alto Fire Dept. Battalion Chief Jim
Timko.
The fire started around noon in the
kitchen of apartment 65E, and a prelimi
nary investigation "points to an unat
tended pot on the stove" as the cause of
the blaze, Timko said.
rranieela and Brian Baitholomc us/.,
tenants of 65E, were not at home when the
fire began and arrived after the fire had

been extinguished. The Bartholomeusz'
were in the process of moving out of their
apartment and were staying with friends,
according to Caroline Van Niekerk, a ten
ant of the adjacent unit 65D. Brian Bar
tholomeusz recently received his doctorate
in materials science at Stanford.
Gopal Raju, Prameela Bartholomeusz'
brother, who was staying in the unit at the
time, said he had left the unit a half hour
before the blaze broke out.
Raju said he did not believe the fire
started in the kitchen. "1 didn't go

The knob of the stove was found in the

"on" position, according to Raymond
Gamma, University fire safety inspector.
The fire melted the aluminum around the
kitchen wall, blew out a window and
spread to the roof, Gamma said.
The firefighters found "nothing sal
vagable," Timko said.
Van Niekerk and her two children,
tenants of the adjacent unit 65D, were at
home at the time and were alerted to the
danger by a neighbor. The fire "shattered
the windows of the unit (65E) and went
wild," Van Niekerk said. Van Niekerk's

gineering.
"I was able to get most of our stuff
out . . . but where we'll move to,
nobody knows," Van Niekerk said.
Units 65F and 65D, which are ad
jacent to 65E, sustained mostly
water and smoke damage, Timko
said. Additional damage was caused
by firemen who cut holes in the
roofs to allow room for ladders.
Three of the 30 firefighters who

were summoned to the blaze sus
tained minor injuries, Timko said.
Of the damage estimate, $150,000
is for structural damage and $25,000
for contents, Timko said.
A contractor will examine the
damage today and draw up plans
for repair, according to Bob Mibach,
facilities manager of graduate stu
dent housing.
A group of officials from graduate
student housing and the Health and
Safety Department will determine
who is liable for the fire at a meeting
next month, Mibach said.
