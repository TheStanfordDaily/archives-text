## Computers take on a new beat 
### SHERNAZ DAVER Staff writer 
A programmer enters code into a computer,
the musican next door listens to a newly-created
tone and someone down the hall pulls out a com
pleted sheet of music from the printer. It is a typi
cal morning at the Stanford Center for Computer
Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA).
CCRMA, currently located about five miles
from campus, will move to the Knoll in April. It
was initially a part of the University's Artificial
Intelligence (AI) department. When AI moved on
campus in 1979, CCRMA became an independent
research center.
"Computers are a very powerful way to aid
and create music," said Prof. John Chowning,
director of CCRMA. Chowning and Music Prof.
Leland Smith developed many programs for
music synthesis and composition in the 19605.
CCRMA has come a long way since then.
Today it is widely regarded as one of the world's
top research centers in computer music.
It has developed a technique that produces
complex musical waves and the composition lan
guage "Pla," used by CCRMA composers. It is
currently working on developing a procedure
which coordinates the accoustical and editing
parts of a composition. It also is developing a
method by which composers can produce musi
cal reverberations by inputting numbers.
Smith recently developed a music editing and
publishing program which allows manuscripted
music to be printed on any printer.
Unlike composing traditional music, where the
musician tinkers with an instrument until he or
she hits on the right melody, computer music
composition deals solely with the computer. The
composer uses a computer program to determine
the variables of the composition's notes, such as

frequency, pitch and tone.
These variables are then converted into numer
ical computer code and synthesized into musical
sounds. Speakers, linked to the computer, then
"play'' the music. This process takes from about
'nroe to five minutes, depending on the length of
he composition.
Since this procedure creates both traditional
music and noises unique to the computer, the art
ist has a wide range of possibilities from which to
choose, according to visiting composer Jonathan
Hallstrom. "It is like being turned loose in a
candy store," he said.
"Normally composers are so protective of their
materials and tricks, but here there is a willing
ness to share information and knowledge" Hal

lstrom added.
Hallstrom, an orchestra conductor and com
poser from Maine, arrived at CCRMA with little
programming knowledge. But by the end of his
three-week stay, he had mastered the composi
tion program "Pla" and had composed a short
piece of music.
Hallstrom said that although computer music is
technical, "most things done here are with an eye
to composition ."
This could be due to the center's wide range of
professionals. The center's 40-person staff con
sists of computer scientists, electrical engineers,
musicans and linguists. Most of them are Stan
ford graduates who had some contact with
CCRMA as students.
To introduce the Stanford community to its re
search and new developments, CCRMA holds
lectures, concerts and classes. Chowning
teaches a three-quarter series, Research in
Computer-Generated Music, in which students
learn the basics of "Pla" for music composition.
Ray Sayre, a junior in mathematics who took
the class last quarter, had mixed emotions about
it. He said the class was "fascinating" and "four
units of fun," but expressed some doubts about
its level of difficulty. Sayre said that it was
"frustrating" to be unable to use the computers at
the same levels that CCRMA composers used
them.
Most people at CCRMA see the field of com
puter music taking off in a big way.
"What can be done with computers and music
is really rather open-minded," Chowning said.
However, few of those associated with the cen
ter think of computers replacing traditional musi
cal instruments. As Smith put it,"The computer
is just another instrument. Violins didn't take
over bassoons, so why should computers take
over?"
