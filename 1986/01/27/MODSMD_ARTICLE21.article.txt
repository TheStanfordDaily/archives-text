## Machtolf HR in 13th gives Card pair 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
Mark Machtolf and Al Osuna look
like the unlikely heroes of the Stan
ford baseball team — at least after
this weekend, anyway.
"Osuna and Machtolf? Who are
they?" most Cardinal fans must be
asking. And it's no wonder.
Well, the two relative unknowns
combined Saturday to lead Stanford
past San Jose State 8-6 in front of a
sun-drenched Sunken Diamond
crowd. The 13-inning victory com
pleted a season-opening sweep of
the Spartans that began with
Friday's 10-6 Cardinal rout in San
Jose.
Even avid followers of Stanford
baseball must have left Sunken Dia
mond Saturday scratching their
heads and wondering about this
Osuna-Machtolf tandem. After all,
one guy — Osuna — didn't pitch at
Stanford last year, although he's a
junior. And the other, Machtolf,
was a linebacker on the Stanford
football team.
The pair chose Saturday to make a
lasting impression. Machtolf, who
until this year doubled as an outside
linebacker in the fall and a third
baseman in the spring, ended Satur
day's 13-inning marathon when he
powered a two-run game-winning
home run.
Coming into this season, Machtolf
had platooned at third, where he
compiled a .264 lifetime batting
average and amassed all of two
homers during two seasons on the
diamond. Those aren't exactly num
bers that warrant much attention.
Things could change in a hurry,
however.
"I've dropped about 15 pounds
off my football playing weight,"
Machtolf said, "and really feel ready
to go."
But Machtolf's unlikely heroism
isn't without its irony. It turns out
that on his home run swing, he was
just trying to get the ball in play. "I
was trying to keep my swing short,
get one in the gap, and let (Frank)
Carey run," said the 6-foot-3 junior
from Spokane, Wash. The speedy

Carey was on first with one out
when Machtolf came up.
"It was a slider up, and I was
looking for a fastball," said Mach
tolf, who had been hitless in four
previous at-bats on the day."I think
it was a bad pitch."
If it weren't for Machtolf's
surprise heroics, the efforts of
Osuna may have been lost. Osuna
entered in the eighth with the score
tied at six, two out and runners on
first and second. He promptly got
Earl Boles, SJSU's cleanup hitter, to

fly to center and end the Spartan
threat.
Osuna didn't quit there. He lasted
another five innings to finish the
game and record the win, his first
for Stanford in almost two years.
Osuna's story is one filled with
twists. He came to the Farm two
years ago as a highly-touted recruit.
He recorded a pair of wins that year,
impressing more than a few during
his freshman year.
But that's when his troubles
began. Osuna left Stanford after his

freshman year to iron out some aca
demic troubles. During his year at
Cerritos Junior College in the Los
Angeles area, he regained his Stan
ford eligibility — and refined his
baseball skills, too.
"It (the year in Southern Califor
nia) was really good for me," Osuna
said. "I worked on my slider and it,
not my fastball, has become my out
pitch.
Now that he's back, Osuna's de
termined to stay. And if he pitches
like he did Saturday, he probably

will. "I knew they (his teammates)
were counting on me. . . and I
didn't want to let them down," he
said.
"I was really pumped up," Osuna
continued. "It's a good feeling to
know that people are behind you."
Keep it up, Al, and they'll be behind
you all the way.
Osuna and Machtolf, names Stan
ford fans will surely have to learn
soon, saved Stanford from a split of
the two games. After two innings
Saturday, San Jose sat on top 5-2.

Stanford's starter, Rob Wasenaar,
was knocked out in the second after
giving up four hits, two of which
were fence-rattling triples.
As Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said, "That's the worst he
(Wasenaar) has pitched. He had
poor location and not much
velocity, and that's a poor combina
tion."
Wasenaar, a nine-game winner
last year, has been penciled in as
Stanford's second starter, behind
Jack McDowell, but Saturday's out
ing should raise some questions.
Marquess, for his part, remains
confident in Wasenaar. "He's actu
ally been our best pitcher through
out fall practice. He's proven he can
pitch. . . . He'll be back out there."
While Wasenaar came up a little
short, McDowell started the year in
fine style Friday in San Jose. The
lanky 6-5 sophomore lasted through
six innings — sometimes showing
the moments of the brilliance every
one expects — to notch his first win
of the year. Along the way, he gave
up two runs, struck out eight, sur
rendered eight hits and walked
none.
"It was all right for a first outing,"
McDowell said. "I was a little shaky.
I'm happy but not satisfied."
A five-run third-inning outburst
staked McDowell to a 6-2 lead. And
with the way he throttled the Spar
tan bats, that was more than
enough.
Card notes
Marquess was pleased with his
team's play. "We played some real
good defense/' he said. "That's
what you look for, defense and for
the pitches to be around the plate.
That way you're going to be in most
games." Regarding his on-again,
off-again offense, Marquess wasn't
too concerned: "We swung the bats
all right. . . I think we'll hit better
than that, though."
Lance Shebelut, making his first
collegiate starts this weekend,
showed some offensive punch. The
6-2 junior was3-for-4 Friday with an
RBI, and then doubled in another
run Saturday. He did, however,
boot a grounder in San Jose.


Walt Harris and his Stanford teammates seem to be in perfect
stride early in the season. The Cardinal opened its 1986 cam
paign with a two-game sweep of San Jose State over the

weekend. A 3-for-6 day in Saturday's 8-6 victory proved that
Harris' batting eye is still keen. It is unlikely, however, that he
saw much on this play.

last year, has been penciled in as
Stanford's second starter, behind
Jack McDowell, but Saturday's out
ing should raise some questions.
Marquess, for his part, remains
confident in Wasenaar. "He's actu
ally been our best pitcher through
out fall practice. He's proven he can
pitch. . . . He'll be back out there."
While Wasenaar came up a little
short, McDowell started the year in
fine style Friday in San Jose. The
lanky 6-5 sophomore lasted through
six innings — sometimes showing
the moments of the brilliance every
one expects — to notch his first win
of the year. Along the way, he gave
up two runs, struck out eight, sur
rendered eight hits and walked
none.
"It was all right for a first outing,"
McDowell said. "I was a little shaky.
I'm happy but not satisfied."
A five-run third-inning outburst
staked McDowell to a 6-2 lead. And
with the way he throttled the Spar
tan bats, that was more than
enough.
Card notes
Marquess was pleased with his
team's play. "We played some real
good defense/' he said. "That's
what you look for, defense and for
the pitches to be around the plate.
That way you're going to be in most
games." Regarding his on-again,
off-again offense, Marquess wasn't
too concerned: "We swung the bats
all right. . . I think we'll hit better
than that, though."
Lance Shebelut, making his first
collegiate starts this weekend,
showed some offensive punch. The
6-2 junior was3-for-4 Friday with an
RBI, and then doubled in another
run Saturday. He did, however,
boot a grounder in San Jose.


Walt Harris and his Stanford teammates seem to be in perfect
stride early in the season. The Cardinal opened its 1986 cam
paign with a two-game sweep of San Jose State over the

weekend. A 3-for-6 day in Saturday's 8-6 victory proved that
Harris' batting eye is still keen. It is unlikely, however, that he
saw much on this play.
Mark Machtolf and Al Osuna look
like the unlikely heroes of the Stan
ford baseball team — at least after
this weekend, anyway.
"Osuna and Machtolf? Who are
they?" most Cardinal fans must be
asking. And it's no wonder.
Well, the two relative unknowns
combined Saturday to lead Stanford
past San Jose State 8-6 in front of a
sun-drenched Sunken Diamond
crowd. The 13-inning victory com
pleted a season-opening sweep of
the Spartans that began with
Friday's 10-6 Cardinal rout in San
Jose.
Even avid followers of Stanford
baseball must have left Sunken Dia
mond Saturday scratching their
heads and wondering about this
Osuna-Machtolf tandem. After all,
one guy — Osuna — didn't pitch at
Stanford last year, although he's a
junior. And the other, Machtolf,
was a linebacker on the Stanford
football team.
The pair chose Saturday to make a
lasting impression. Machtolf, who
until this year doubled as an outside
linebacker in the fall and a third
baseman in the spring, ended Satur
day's 13-inning marathon when he
powered a two-run game-winning
home run.
Coming into this season, Machtolf
had platooned at third, where he
compiled a .264 lifetime batting
average and amassed all of two
homers during two seasons on the
diamond. Those aren't exactly num
bers that warrant much attention.
Things could change in a hurry,
however.
"I've dropped about 15 pounds
off my football playing weight,"
Machtolf said, "and really feel ready
to go."
But Machtolf's unlikely heroism
isn't without its irony. It turns out
that on his home run swing, he was
just trying to get the ball in play. "I
was trying to keep my swing short,
get one in the gap, and let (Frank)
Carey run," said the 6-foot-3 junior
from Spokane, Wash. The speedy

Carey was on first with one out
when Machtolf came up.
"It was a slider up, and I was
looking for a fastball," said Mach
tolf, who had been hitless in four
previous at-bats on the day."I think
it was a bad pitch."
If it weren't for Machtolf's
surprise heroics, the efforts of
Osuna may have been lost. Osuna
entered in the eighth with the score
tied at six, two out and runners on
first and second. He promptly got
Earl Boles, SJSU's cleanup hitter, to

fly to center and end the Spartan
threat.
Osuna didn't quit there. He lasted
another five innings to finish the
game and record the win, his first
for Stanford in almost two years.
Osuna's story is one filled with
twists. He came to the Farm two
years ago as a highly-touted recruit.
He recorded a pair of wins that year,
impressing more than a few during
his freshman year.
But that's when his troubles
began. Osuna left Stanford after his

freshman year to iron out some aca
demic troubles. During his year at
Cerritos Junior College in the Los
Angeles area, he regained his Stan
ford eligibility — and refined his
baseball skills, too.
"It (the year in Southern Califor
nia) was really good for me," Osuna
said. "I worked on my slider and it,
not my fastball, has become my out
pitch.
Now that he's back, Osuna's de
termined to stay. And if he pitches
like he did Saturday, he probably

will. "I knew they (his teammates)
were counting on me. . . and I
didn't want to let them down," he
said.
"I was really pumped up," Osuna
continued. "It's a good feeling to
know that people are behind you."
Keep it up, Al, and they'll be behind
you all the way.
Osuna and Machtolf, names Stan
ford fans will surely have to learn
soon, saved Stanford from a split of
the two games. After two innings
Saturday, San Jose sat on top 5-2.

Stanford's starter, Rob Wasenaar,
was knocked out in the second after
giving up four hits, two of which
were fence-rattling triples.
As Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said, "That's the worst he
(Wasenaar) has pitched. He had
poor location and not much
velocity, and that's a poor combina
tion."
