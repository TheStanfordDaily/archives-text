## Women dominant against USC, UCLA 
### MARY K. McDEVITT Senior staff writer 
In its season opener this weekend, the Stanford
women's swim team blasted the Southern California
members of the Pacific West Conference, registering
19 NCAA qualifying times in back-to-back wins over
USC and UCLA.
The highlight of Saturday's 102-38 win over the
Bruins was the performance of Olympic silver
medalist Susan Rapp, a junior who sat out last year
because of arthroscopic knee surgery. In 1984 Rapp
won the NCAA 200-yard breaststroke and scored
points in the 100 butterfly, 200 butterfly and 200 indi
vidual medley.
"Susan really showed that she's coming back,"
Haines said.
Rapp won the 200 butterfly in an NCAA cut of
2:01.56, "which was great," Haines said. "That was
really the comeback of the year so far."
She also won the 200 individual medley in an
NCAA qualifying time of 2:05.06.
"I was really excited to make cuts," Rapp said.
"My knees held up really well. It was a blessing."
In the 400 medley relay, freshman Michelle
Donahue, senior Kathy Smith, freshman Jenna
Johnson and senior Diana ''ock combined to win in
3:47.2, one of the top three times in the nation to
date.
The Cardinal won every event except the 100 back
stroke and the one- and three-meter diving.
In the freestyle sprints, Johnson and freshman
Aimee Berzins won the 50 and 100 events,
respectively, ''ock was second in both races.
Distance freestylers Stacy Shupe, a sophomore,

and Lisa Hazen, a senior, captured the 500- and
1,650-yard events.
At USC on Friday, freshman Jennifer Pokluda,
Smith, Johnson and ''ock set the tone for the meet in
the opening event, winning the 200 medley relay in
1:45.04, an NCAA standard.
Johnson won the 200 freestyle in what Haines
called the "best swim of the meet." Her time of
1:47.91, an NCAA cut, was a lifetime best.
"I really wanted to do at least a 1:48.," Johnson
said. "I was just going for it."
Johnson also won the 100 butterfly in 54.95.
In the 200 butterfly, freshman Monica Neilebeck
used the excitement of the meet, which was filmed
by a cable television station, to her advantage, win
ning in 2:01.79.
"It was my first race and our first real dual meet,"
Neilebeck said. "My adrenaline was going â€” there
were all these camera crews. I got up on the blocks
and was ready to go."
Neilebeck also won the 200 individual medley,
narrowly missing an NCAA standard.
In breaststroke events this weekend, senior Kathy
Smith didn't lose a single race. Her times against the
Trojans of 1:03.49 in the 100-yard race and 2:18.5 in
the 200-yard event were both NCAA cuts.
Donahue scored first and Pokluda placed second
in the 100 backstroke, both with NCAA times.
Shupe and Hazen set NCAA standards in the
1,650 freestyle, with times of 16:28.2 and 16:34.0,
respectively.
Basically, the weekend was a confidence builder
for the Cardinal.
"We were really encouraged," Johnson said.
"Overall we left feeling excited and positive."
