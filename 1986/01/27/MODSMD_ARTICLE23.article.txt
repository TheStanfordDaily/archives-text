# Men a disappointing fourth in Dallas
## 
### AMY FRANCETIC Staff writer 
In an uncharacteristic perfor
mance, the Stanford men's swim
team tallied 248 points to finish
fourth out of six teams in the Dal
las Morning News Classic held in
Dallas Friday and Saturday.
Florida, one of Stanford's
highly-ranked NCAA opponents,
made its first-ever appearance at
the meet this year, and edged past
UCLA, 274.5 to 273.5, to capture
first place. Texas nabbed third
place with 265 points, California
followed Stanford in fifth place
with 233 points, and Southern
Methodist University struggled in
sixth with 229 points.
"It wasn't our kind of a meet,"
Cardinal sophomore Sean
Murphy said. "Much of the meet
depended on sprint relays, and
Florida and UCLA have depth and

speed in their sprinters."
Florida shared first and second
with UCLA in all of the relays, to
account for most of its points.
A poor finish in the 400-yard
sprint medley relay on Friday
dealt a damaging blow to the
Cardinal's morale.
"The first day is important, it
sets the tone of the meet for the
team," Murphy said. "It taught us
a good lesson for the NCAAs,
which extend over a three-day
weekend,"
However, the Cardinal rallied
Saturday and won more events
than its opponents. Junior Pablo
Morales swept all three of his
events, the 200 butterfly, the 200
individual medley and the 100
butterfly.
Morales did not record the fast
est time of the meet in the 200 but
terfly. His time was bettered by
teammate Anthonv Mosse, who

was swimming in a bonus heat.
Mosse posted a 1:46.8 — the fast
est American time of the year.
Junior Jeff Kostoff found him
self racing only the clock in two of
his races, the 500 freestyle and the
400 individual medley, as he
easily swam by the rest of the
field.
Saturday, Murphy won the 200
backstroke but said he received a
questionable call on his turn. He
was disqualified on the call, cos
ting Stanford valuable points.
Despite the fourth-place finish,
"The weekend was beneficial be
cause We accomplished our main
goal, which was to get in some
good races," Morales said.
The Cardinal kicks off its con
ference dual meet action this
weekend at home when it hosts
Arizona State in DeGuerre Pool at
2 p.m.
