# Bears maul Patriots

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The
Chicago Bears carved their black
and blue initals next to the great
teams in NFL history Sunday by
turning their "46" defense into a
"46" offense.
Scorned by the purists who in
sisted they would have to win a
Super Bowl to be considered a great
team, the Bears did just that in over
powering fashion, demolishing
New England 46-10 in Super Bowl
XX and forcing the Patriots' offense
into retreat.
It was the Bears' 18th victory in 19
games and marked the third time
they had scored more than 40 points
against teams with 10 victories or
more. The 46 points were the most
ever scored in a Super Bowl and the
margin of victory was the largest
ever.
Asst. Coach Buddy Ryan's "46,"
which often puts eight men on the

line of scrimmage, set up 32 of the
46 points.

Led by Richard Dent, the game's
Most Valuable Player, it registered
seven sacks to tie a Super Bowl
record, held New England to

minus-19 yards in the first half and
didn't allow a pass completion for 25
minutes or a first down for 26. Only
one of New England's first 16 plays
from scrimmage — a three-yard run
by Craig James — gained yardage.
Quarterback Jim McMahon ran
for two touchdowns and passed for
256 yards before leaving at the end

of the third quarter with a slightly
sprained left wrist.
But Walter Payton, the NFL's all
time leading rusher, didn't score in
his first Super Bowl in 11 seasons. In
fact, he was upstaged once again by
300-pound lineman William "The
Refrigerator" Perry, who ran for one
TD, threw a block for another, and
even tried to throw a pass.
"Yes, I was disappointed," said
Payton, who gained 61 yards in 22
carries. "I feel bad, but that's the
way it goes."
Dent was credited with IV2 sacks,
forced two fumbles and even
knocked down a pass to lead the
defense.
New England, which had forced
16 turnovers in its three playoff vic
tories, forced its 17th on the second
play of the game when Payton

fumbled and Larry McGrew
recovered on the Chicago 19.
But in a hint of things to come,
Tony Eason was harried into three
incomplete passes, and New Eng
land had to settle for Tony
Franklin's 36-yard field goal. The
score, 1:19 into the game, was the
earliest in Super Bowl history and
the first points scored in the playoffs
against the Bears, who ended up
outscoring their three postseason
opponents 101-10.
With the help of a 43-yard pass
from McMahon to Willie Gault,
Chicago came right back to tie at 3-3
on Kevin Butler's 28-yard field goal,
the first of three for the rookie
kicker.
Then came the defense — Dent in
particular— setting up 10 points in
1:03 to give the Bears a 13-3 lead at
the end of the first quarter.
The second half was strictly anti
climax.
"I think we'll be seen as one of the
best teams of all time," Chicago Bear
linebacker Mike Singletary said.
