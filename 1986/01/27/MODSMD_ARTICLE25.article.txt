# Women hoopsters nipped by UCLA, then routed by USC
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
The Stanford women's basketball
team needed just one more thing in
each of its two Pacific West Confer
ence home losses this weekend.
First, a furious Cardinal comeback
against UCLA Friday night came up
just one minute short as the Bruins
hung on for a 65-62 victory. And
then on Saturday night against
USC, the Cardinal needed just one
more player — if that player hap
pened to be Cheryl Miller.
Unfortunately for Stanford (11-8
overall, 0-2 in the conference), Mil
ler was suited up in scarlet and gold,
and she led the No. 5 Trojans (16-2,
3-0) to an 81-59 rout.
It's almost as fun to listen to Mil
ler's stats as it is to watch her play.
Against the Cardinal she scored 32
points, roped in 13 rebounds,
dished out four assists and came up
with seven steals.
"It was nothing spectacular for
her," Stanford Coach Tara VanDer
veer said. "In fact she probably had
a below-average game by her stand
ards."
While Miller did everything on
the court, she wasn't the sole reason
for the USC victory. Trojan senior
Cynthia Cooper and junior guard
Rhonda Windham outquicked and
outshot the younger Cardinal team.

sophomores with (senior guard Vir

ginia) Sourlis out there," VanDer
veer said. "Everyone got some good
experience."
Indeed, Cardinal sophomore
Kami Anderson and freshman Jill
Yanke led Stanford in scoring with
18 and 13 points respectively. Two
more Stanford freshmen, Andrea
Ransom and Evon Asforis, logged
30 minutes of playing time against
use.
Asforis and her teammates put in
a valiant but tiring run against the
UCLA Bruins on Friday; the only
problem was that they started too
late. Thanks to the hot shooting of
Bruin senior Anne Dean and sopho
more Jaime Brown — and a dismal
26 percent shooting effort by Stan
ford — UCLA held a comfortable 39-
20 halftime lead.
The Cardinal played better in the
second half, but simply wasn't able
to put a big dent in the Bruin lead.
"Everytime I thought we were
going to make a run, we'd make a
turnover or let them get an easy
hoop and lose our momentum,"
VanDerveer said.
Stanford trailed 63-48 with 3:59
remaining in the contest when it fi
nally made its true run at the Bruins.
The Cardinal's full court pressure
began to reap benefits, as the man
to-man trap forced UCLA forward
Shari Biggs into three turnovers
down the stretch.
Anderson juked left and made a
strong baseline move to the right to
cut the spread to five with 48
seconds left.
After the Bruins missed the next
time down the court, Sourlis hit a
set shot to make the score 63-60.
Stanford then quickly fouled Dean.
Dean missed the front end of the
one-and-one, and Sourlis delivered
a 25-foot prayer that swished. With
12 seconds left in the game, the
Bruins led by one point, 63-62.
Stanford fouled Brown right away
on the inbound pass, and with nine
ticks left on the scoreboard she
calmly sank the two free throws to
seal the 65-62 victory.
"We aren't a great enough team to
come back from such a big deficit/'
VanDerveer said.
