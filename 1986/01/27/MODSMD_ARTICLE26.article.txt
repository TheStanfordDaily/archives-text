# Gymnasts fly high
## Men score nation's '86 best vs. Bruins 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
When the Stanford men's gvmastics team walked
into UCLA's Pauley Pavilion Friday night, it was just
looking to turn in a solid performance.
"Many of us didn't think we could beat them,"
Stanford freshmen Scott Schaffer said. "We were
concentrating on hitting our routines."
But when the squad walked out of UCLA's gym, it
was the owner of the highest team score recorded
this winter by any team in the nation.
The Cardinal's 278.2 tally was enough to edge the
Bruins, who finished with a 276.9 total. "It was a
very high-scoring meet," Schaffer said.
Stanford Coach Sadao Hamada agreed. "1 was ex
pecting about 275 (points)," he said. "We had a very
good competition. All the guys were really con
centrating."
The competition was highlighted by the perfor
mances of the four U.S. National Team members
participating in the meet. These gymnasts took the
first four spots in the all-around competition.

UCLA's Rob Campbell took first with 57 points,
narrowly defeating Stanford's Randy Besosa, who
scored a 56.8. Finishing third was Bruin Brian
Ginsberg at 56.1. The Cardinal's John Louis grabbed
fourth with 55.85 points.
According to Shaffer, Besosa had an incredible
meet. "Randy just got good scores on every single
event; he was hitting everything," Schaffer said.
Campbell, meanwhile, showed why he almost
made the 1984 Olympic Team, as he edged Besosa
for the individual title.
Top Stanford performances in single events in
cluded Gary Smith's 9.7 on the high bar and a score
of 9.7 from junior Mark Arnold on the rings. Louis
recorded a 9.65 in the floor exercise.
Not only did the Cardinal defeat powerhouse
UCLA in Pauley Pavilion in its first real meet of the
season, but it did it "even with UCLA getting good
scores from the local judges." Schaffer said.
"Usually the home team has a great advantage, be
cause they're used to their own equipment,"
Hamada said. "We totally wiped them out (though)
and that surprised UCLA, I think."
