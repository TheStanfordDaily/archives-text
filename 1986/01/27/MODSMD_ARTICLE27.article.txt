# Strong weekend for women down south
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Traveling to Southern California for back-to-back
competitions, the second of which includes the No. 6
and No. 7 teams in the nation, is never an easy task.
This weekend, however, the Stanford women's
gymnastics team did just that. Friday, the Cardinal
topped USC, and although the women lost Saturday
to seventh-ranked UCLA and sixth-ranked Arizona,
Stanford Coach Homer Sardina felt they performed
very well, better than he had expected they would.
Despite the positive performance of the team Sat
urday afternoon, the meet may prove to be a very
negative one for the Cardinal. During the meet's
third rotation, Stanford sophomore Beth Pope, one
of the nation's best collegiate gymnasts, suffered a
knee injury that could put her out for the season.
While performing her floor exercise routine, Pope
badly injured her knee. She will see a doctor tomor
row for an official diagnosis.
It is possible that the injury could end her season,
but "Beth could be back for our second home meet,
the Cardinal Classic (Feb. 7)," Sardina said.

Sardina stressed that this was only conjecture on
his part and that only after Pope's examination today
would anybody be able to say when she could return
to action.
Even without Pope, Stanford scored well at UCLA
with 176.6 points. The host Bruins won the meet
with 183.25 points, edging Arizona's score of 181.2.
Stanford's score could have been a 183 had the Card
inal not lost seven points in falls, according to Sar
dina.
Stanford was led by Jinny Rhee, who dueled with
UCLA's Tanya Service throughout the meet. The
freshmen ended up first and second in the all
around competition. Service earned the top spot
with 38.1 points, while Rhee finished in a second
place tie with the Bruins' Gigi -'osa at 36.75.
Also turning in solid performances for the Card
inal were Laurence George and Jessica Armstrong.
Against USC, Stanford won what Sardina called
"a lopsided competition," 166.6 to 133.
According to Sardina, the Cardinal's performance
Saturday against two such highly-ranked teams
proved that it can compete with anybody. "We're
definitely a tough team," he said.
