# Track takes two firsts from LSU
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
The nice thing about preseason track meets is that scores don't really
count for anything, so the athletes can relax. Mistakes aren't crucial, as they
may be later in the season. With those thoughts in mind, the Stanford track
team looked at last weekends' Louisiana State Invitational as a chance to im
prove and prepare for the upcoming season.
Team scores weren't important, but that didn't detract from the level of
competion. Participants in the meet included some of the top southern track
athletes as well as a couple of ex-Olympians. As Cardinal pole vaulter Dave
Pickett said, "It was a big meet with no big meet pressure."
As one might expect from such a meet, some Stanford athletes were
motivated and able to improve, and some weren't.
In the womens' meet, two Cardinal athletes stood out from the crowd.
The womens' high jump field was described by the LSU sports informa
tion office as one of the toughest of the meet. No less than 10 of the competi
tors had personal bests of ovef 5-foot-10. Credentials don't mean anything
unless one produces, and Stanford's Lisa Bernhagen did just that.
Bernhagen cleared 5-11 and claimed the meet title. Outjumping her
nearest competitor by more than an inch, she convincingly beat a talented
field.
In the women's shot put, senior Pam Dukes found herself in a three-way
battle with Regina Cavanaugh of Rice and Teresa Williford of LSU.
Cavanaugh, one of the nation's best, ended up first, but Dukes was able to
beat out Williford to take second.
Dukes' throw of 51 feet, three inches wasn't her best of the young season,
but it marked her second strong performance in a row.
In the men's meet, the Stanford distance runners and vertical jumpers
were tough to beat.
If there was a weakness in the meet, it was the quality of the distance
field, so a talented group of Stanford runners had little problem walking
away with the mens' distance medley title.
The team consisted of Brian Connoly running 880 yards, Leslie Morris
sprinting a 440, Brian Pettingill going 1,320 yards, and Jeff Atkinson anchor
ing with a mile.
The victory was sweet for the Cardinal, but not surprising. As Atkinson
said, "It was fun, but the competition wasn't very formidable."
Another solid performance came from the Stanford pole vaulters. Com
peting on Friday to qualify for Saturday's competition, Dave Pickett and
John Gash both managed to get over the bar at 16-2. Gash placed first and
Pickett second in Friday's preliminary competition, as Gash had one less
miss.
Unfortunately, neither was able to capitalize on Saturday's extra competi
tion. Gash was unable to clear the opening height and Pickett listened to
Stanford Coach Brooks Johnson's advice and sat out to protect a sore groin.
Pickett was pleased with his performance, but still wanted just a little
more. To qualify for the NCAAs he'll have to reach 17-1, which he feels is "a
goal within reach."
In the high jump competition, Stanford's Brian Marshall captured third
with a leap of 7-1.
