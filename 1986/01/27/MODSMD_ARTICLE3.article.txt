# Experts view Uranus data

A team of seven Stanford researchers analyzing data
from the Voyager 2 spacecraft emerged from Stanford's
Space Telecommunications and Radioscience Labora
tory (STARLAB) early yesterday morning encouraged
by the results of an all-night study of the planet Uranus.
The specific details of the Stanford findings will be
released in a press conference tomorrow at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, where other
research on Uranus is taking place.
Voyager 2 recently finished gathering data on the
rings and five largest moons of Uranus. Launched in
1977, the spacecraft is now traveling to Neptune, the
fourth planet on its flight.
According to senior engineering research associate
Essam Marouf, Stanford researchers conducted experi
ments to determine the size, location and density of the
rings. Other research conducted at the JPL focused on
the planet's atmosphere â€” its temperature, pressure
and heat waves.
The experimentation at Stanford used special com
puter software designed by senior research associate
Richard Simpson and electrical engineering graduate
students Donna Gresh and Paul Rosen. Electrical engi
neering Profs. Leonard Tyler and Von Eshleman, engi
neering research associate Dave Hinson and Marouf are
also involved in the project.
Marouf said Stanford usually must wait a long time
before receiving transmissions gathered from Voyager,
which is now 1.8 billion miles away from Earth. The
data gathered on Friday, however, was flown immedi
ately to San Francisco from Australia, where it was col
lected by three antennae.
"This time we've arranged to get a piece of our data
. . . within 24 hours of the actual conduction of the ex
periment," Marouf said.
As well as determining the nature of the rings, the
computer program will also determine whether there
are large particles located in between, according to
Marouf.
The Voyager is on its "Grand Tour" of the planets
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. The four planets
line up once every 176 years in an order that enables sci
entists to use the gravity of one planet "as a slingshot to
send the spacecraft to the next planet," Marouf said.
To gather the data from Uranus, the Voyager travels
behind the rings and transmits radio signals through
them, Marouf said. The computer at Stanford sorts out
the signature of these radio signals and, by examining
the pattern in which the signals are blocked, determines
the distribution of material.
Stanford has "thr only experiment that's able to tell
how big the particles are," Marouf
said.
Over the weekend, photographic
images transmitted from the

Voyager revealed other findings,
about Uranus and its environs. The
discoveries, announced Saturday,
included the existence of a 10th ring
around the planet and a previously
unknown moon.
After the results concerning the
atmosphere and rings of Uranus are
released at the press conference,

Stanford researchers will continue
to conduct investigation of the
Voyager data.
Stanford has been involved in the
Voyager experiments since their in
ception in the early 19705. Marouf
said that he expects that Stanford
also will participate in studies of
Neptune.
