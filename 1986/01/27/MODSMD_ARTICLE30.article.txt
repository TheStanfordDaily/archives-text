# Cardinal volleyball meets Northridge
## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
Once again, Maples Pavilion will
play host to some top-flight volley
ball action tonight — only this time,
the court will belong to the Stanford
men's volleyball team, ranked No. 5
in the country in the preseason
NCAA poll.
The Cardinal men will try to pick
up where their highly successful
female counterparts left off, kicking
off their conference schedule with a
7:30 p.m. match against Cal State-
Northridge.
The Cardinal men play in the
tough California Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Association, home of
defending NCAA champion Pep
perdine as well as strong squads
from USC, UCLA and Hawaii, all of
whom are ranked ahead of Stan
ford.

The top five finishers in the 11-
team league are granted berths in
the NCAA West Regionals. The
league champion and the runner-up
then go on to the national Final
Four. In fact, the championship
game is almost always between the
two CIV A representatives.
But as Stanford Coach Don Shaw
said, the Cardinal would rather con
trol its own destiny than depend on
that precarious fifth spot in the con
ference.
The Cardinal will look to Ail-
American Jon Root and veterans
Chris Braun and Scott Fortune, who
return as the three main hitters, in
their quest for a playoff bid. Steve
Modory steps into the setter posi
tion vacated by All-American Craig
Lauchner, and will be counted on to
run the complicated Stanford of
fense.
