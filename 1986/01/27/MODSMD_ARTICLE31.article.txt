# Wrestlers improving

### PETER CASTILLO Staff writer 
The past month has been an extremely tough one
for the Stanford wrestling team, as it has lost nine of
its last 10 dual meets, but the squad rebounded on
Saturday with a fifth-place finish at the All-
California Invitational in San Francisco. The return
ing champion, Cal State-Bakersfield, ran away from
the pack to defend its title.
"I am happy to see the other guys who have not
placed in a tournament do so well," Stanford Coach
Chris Horpel. "They needed it for their confidence
and to gain some momentum."
Horpel said he felt that that the Cardinal could
have placed second if Jeff Bradley (134 pounds) and
126-pounder Neil Wartnik were not out with neck in
juries.
Bradley has had a problem with his neck all season
and at the start of the season seriously considered
redshirting. Horpel is giving Bradley the week off to
rest but said he is concerned that the injury may not
allow Bradley to practice adequately for the Pacific 10
Championships on March 2.
Kurt Kassulke, who has shown steady improve

ment throughout the year at 190 pounds, was a
surprise for the Cardinal in second place.
Stanford's Dave Lee, ranked 13th in the nation at
167 pounds, lost in the finals to second-ranked Dar
ryl Pope of Bakersfield, 4-2. It was the fourth
meeting of the season between these rivals, and
Pope holds a slim 2-1-1 series edge over Lee.
Lee has also faced stiff competition from Fresno
State's Fred Little, and Horpel said he feels that Lee
has benefited from facing these two often this
season.
"I do not think he is letting it (his losses to Pope
and Little) get to him. He is closing the gap between
them," Horpel said. "He does not have to go East to
face such good wrestlers because he can get it in his
backyard. The other wrestlers have not gotten such a
high level of competition and may have problems if
they qualify for the NCAA Championships."
Both Jeff Hazard (150 pounds) and Pete Rogers
(158 pounds) captured third for the Cardinal, and
their teammate Terry Mclntyre defeated Chris
Macintosh of Cal-State Fullerton, 5-2, for third.
The Cardinal will swing into action next against
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo Saturday at 7 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion.
