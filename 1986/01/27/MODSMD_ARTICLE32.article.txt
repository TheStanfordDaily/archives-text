Soviets help S. Yemen rebels
MANAMA, Bahrain — The Soviet Union has replenished from its
own stocks in South Yemen the arsenal of the hardline Marxist regime
that deposed President Ali Nasser Mohammed last week after bloody
and devastating battles, authoritative reports said yesterday.
The United Arab Emirates newspaper Al-Khaleej quoted sources as
saying that most of the huge losses had already been replaced from
the Soviet-controlled airbase at Al-Rayyan, in the central governorate
of Hadramawt, and the Been al-Jabaleen military warehouses near
Aden.
Meanwhile, reports from Sanaa, the North Yemen capital, said that
the new regime had gone on the offensive against Mohammed's sup
porters who were massing their forces in Abeen, near the North
Yemen border.
It said North Yemen authorities were staging a military mobilization
on the border with South Yemen and turning down requests by
reporters to visit the area "for their own safety."
In Aden, the South Yemen Cabinet met under Prime Minister and
Interim President Haider al-Attas, who returned from Moscow over
the weekend after Mohammed's opponents tightened their control on
most territories in the strategic Arabian Peninsula country.
Aden radio said that a special committee was set up to evaluate
damage sustained in nearly two weeks of fighting against the forces of
Mohammed, accused of having ordered the assassination of top Polit
buro members on Jan. 13.
It said humanitarian aid was being received from a number of
countries but did not give any estimate of the extent of casualties or
damage. Press reports said there were no less than 10,000 dead,
20,000 wounded and damage of up to $4 billion.
Portugal to have runoff election
LISBON, Portugal — Diogo Freitas do Amaral, a 44-year-old con
servative law professor, took a commanding lead in the Portuguese
presidential elections yesterday but fell short of the majority needed
to win in the first round.
Socialist Mario Soares, a prime minister three times and the best
known Portuguese politician outside Portugal, held off a challenge
from two other leftist candidates to win the right to oppose Freitas do
Amaral in a runoff election scheduled Feb. 16.
Even while falling short of a first-round majority, Freitas do
Amaral, who seemed to be on the fringes of Portuguese politics with
his conservative Social Democratic Central Party in the leftist epoch
after the 1974 revolution, put together the strongest right-wing
showing in any of the three presidential and six parliamentary elec
tions of democratic Portugal.
The second round will thus pit one of Portugal's most conservative
politicians against its best known leftist politician. Freitas do Amaral
will be favored because Soares, in the view of most analysts, will have
a difficult time uniting the left behind him, especially in the case of his
longtime enemies of the Communist Party.
S. African government rips Tutu
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — By calling for American and
European support for the African National Congress during his three
week tour of the United States, Bishop Desmond Tutu has become
more controversial here than ever before, and the black prelate
returns home this week amid demands that the South African gov
ernment silence him.
Tutu's critics have urged that he be prosecuted for treason, that he
be barred from all political activities, including public appearances, or
that, at least, he be forbidden to travel abroad again.
The government has described as "shocking and deplorable"
Tutu's declared support of the African National Congress, outlawed
here 25 years ago and now the main guerrilla organization fighting the
minority white government. State-run Radio South Africa has
accused him of fomenting even greater violence here and deliberately
undermining efforts at peaceful reform.
Even some liberal whites who usually defend Tutu say that he went
too far in his daily attacks on apartheid while in the United States and
that he must now make clear his position on violence if he is to retain
their support.
But Tutu, the Anglican bishop of Johannesburg and winner of the
1984 Nobel Peace Prize, shrugged off the criticism. Speaking in
Chicago last week, he told reporters, "I don't usually say anything
abroad that I don't say inside the country. They are just annoyed, I
think, at the attention I get."
He doubted, he said, whether the government would prosecute
him under South Africa's strict security laws or even withdraw his
passport. "Why are they so scared of someone who doesn't have a
vote in his country?" Tutu commented. "1 am a nothing. Why
worry?"
Honduran president takes office
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras — President-elect Jose Azcona, who is
to take office today, comes to power in a weak political position that
leaves him vulnerable to pressure from the armed forces and the U.S.
government, according to Honduran politicians and other analysts
here.
Azcona faces an uphill battle to establish himself as a strong leader
because he will control neither the Congress nor the Supreme Court,
and because he did poorly in the Nov. 24 election.
Another candidate won a plurality of the votes, and Azcona was
named the victor only because of a quirk in the election rules.
In one important indication of Azcona's weakness, he already has
backed off from a position he took in the campaign of opposing the
presence in southern Honduras of Nicaraguan antigovernment guer
rillas known as contras, or counterrevolutionaries.
He still plans to try to arrange for them to move their bases across
the border into Nicaragua. But his aides said he views that process as
a gradual one and does not want a "confrontation" with the United
States over the issue.
Both the Honduran armed forces and the U.S. government want
this country to continue providing sanctuary to the contras. The
rebels are not strong enough militarily to move their camps into
Nicaragua, so Azcona's administration appears likely to continue the
current policy of letting the contras stay while denying publicly that
they are there, according to the Honduran politicians and other obser
vers.
Regarding domestic policy, Azcona campaigned on a platform call
ing for improved programs in health care, education, land reform and
employment. But his choices of Cabinet ministers were strongly
criticized by politicians and other analysts of all political stripes.
These sources said that Azcona had given too many positions to
personal friends or potential political allies and that he yielded to
pressure from the armed forces in his choice for the influential post of
foreign minister.
Marcos bans civilian firearms
MANILA, Philippines — Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos
ordered yesterday the disarming of all civilians carrying firearms prior
to the presidential election Feb. 7.
Meanwhile, the military said at least 12 persons have been killed
and nine injured in election-related shootings, ambushes and other
incidents since the campaign started Dec. 11.
Marcos met national and regional leaders of the ruling New Society
Movement party at the presidential palace to thrash out measures to
protect the sanctity of the polls, a palace statement said.
The prohibition on firearms covers all licensed holders except cas
hiers, disbursing officers and law enforcers.

employment. But his choices of Cabinet ministers were strongly
criticized by politicians and other analysts of all political stripes.
These sources said that Azcona had given too many positions to
personal friends or potential political allies and that he yielded to
pressure from the armed forces in his choice for the influential post of
foreign minister.
Marcos bans civilian firearms
MANILA, Philippines — Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos
ordered yesterday the disarming of all civilians carrying firearms prior
to the presidential election Feb. 7.
Meanwhile, the military said at least 12 persons have been killed
and nine injured in election-related shootings, ambushes and other
incidents since the campaign started Dec. 11.
Marcos met national and regional leaders of the ruling New Society
Movement party at the presidential palace to thrash out measures to
protect the sanctity of the polls, a palace statement said.
The prohibition on firearms covers all licensed holders except cas
hiers, disbursing officers and law enforcers.
Soviets help S. Yemen rebels
MANAMA, Bahrain — The Soviet Union has replenished from its
own stocks in South Yemen the arsenal of the hardline Marxist regime
that deposed President Ali Nasser Mohammed last week after bloody
and devastating battles, authoritative reports said yesterday.
The United Arab Emirates newspaper Al-Khaleej quoted sources as
saying that most of the huge losses had already been replaced from
the Soviet-controlled airbase at Al-Rayyan, in the central governorate
of Hadramawt, and the Been al-Jabaleen military warehouses near
Aden.
Meanwhile, reports from Sanaa, the North Yemen capital, said that
the new regime had gone on the offensive against Mohammed's sup
porters who were massing their forces in Abeen, near the North
Yemen border.
It said North Yemen authorities were staging a military mobilization
on the border with South Yemen and turning down requests by
reporters to visit the area "for their own safety."
In Aden, the South Yemen Cabinet met under Prime Minister and
Interim President Haider al-Attas, who returned from Moscow over
the weekend after Mohammed's opponents tightened their control on
most territories in the strategic Arabian Peninsula country.
Aden radio said that a special committee was set up to evaluate
damage sustained in nearly two weeks of fighting against the forces of
Mohammed, accused of having ordered the assassination of top Polit
buro members on Jan. 13.
It said humanitarian aid was being received from a number of
countries but did not give any estimate of the extent of casualties or
damage. Press reports said there were no less than 10,000 dead,
20,000 wounded and damage of up to $4 billion.
Portugal to have runoff election
LISBON, Portugal — Diogo Freitas do Amaral, a 44-year-old con
servative law professor, took a commanding lead in the Portuguese
presidential elections yesterday but fell short of the majority needed
to win in the first round.
Socialist Mario Soares, a prime minister three times and the best
known Portuguese politician outside Portugal, held off a challenge
from two other leftist candidates to win the right to oppose Freitas do
Amaral in a runoff election scheduled Feb. 16.
Even while falling short of a first-round majority, Freitas do
Amaral, who seemed to be on the fringes of Portuguese politics with
his conservative Social Democratic Central Party in the leftist epoch
after the 1974 revolution, put together the strongest right-wing
showing in any of the three presidential and six parliamentary elec
tions of democratic Portugal.
The second round will thus pit one of Portugal's most conservative
politicians against its best known leftist politician. Freitas do Amaral
will be favored because Soares, in the view of most analysts, will have
a difficult time uniting the left behind him, especially in the case of his
longtime enemies of the Communist Party.
S. African government rips Tutu
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — By calling for American and
European support for the African National Congress during his three
week tour of the United States, Bishop Desmond Tutu has become
more controversial here than ever before, and the black prelate
returns home this week amid demands that the South African gov
ernment silence him.
Tutu's critics have urged that he be prosecuted for treason, that he
be barred from all political activities, including public appearances, or
that, at least, he be forbidden to travel abroad again.
The government has described as "shocking and deplorable"
Tutu's declared support of the African National Congress, outlawed
here 25 years ago and now the main guerrilla organization fighting the
minority white government. State-run Radio South Africa has
accused him of fomenting even greater violence here and deliberately
undermining efforts at peaceful reform.
Even some liberal whites who usually defend Tutu say that he went
too far in his daily attacks on apartheid while in the United States and
that he must now make clear his position on violence if he is to retain
their support.
But Tutu, the Anglican bishop of Johannesburg and winner of the
1984 Nobel Peace Prize, shrugged off the criticism. Speaking in
Chicago last week, he told reporters, "I don't usually say anything
abroad that I don't say inside the country. They are just annoyed, I
think, at the attention I get."
He doubted, he said, whether the government would prosecute
him under South Africa's strict security laws or even withdraw his
passport. "Why are they so scared of someone who doesn't have a
vote in his country?" Tutu commented. "1 am a nothing. Why
worry?"
Honduran president takes office
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras — President-elect Jose Azcona, who is
to take office today, comes to power in a weak political position that
leaves him vulnerable to pressure from the armed forces and the U.S.
government, according to Honduran politicians and other analysts
here.
Azcona faces an uphill battle to establish himself as a strong leader
because he will control neither the Congress nor the Supreme Court,
and because he did poorly in the Nov. 24 election.
Another candidate won a plurality of the votes, and Azcona was
named the victor only because of a quirk in the election rules.
In one important indication of Azcona's weakness, he already has
backed off from a position he took in the campaign of opposing the
presence in southern Honduras of Nicaraguan antigovernment guer
rillas known as contras, or counterrevolutionaries.
He still plans to try to arrange for them to move their bases across
the border into Nicaragua. But his aides said he views that process as
a gradual one and does not want a "confrontation" with the United
States over the issue.
Both the Honduran armed forces and the U.S. government want
this country to continue providing sanctuary to the contras. The
rebels are not strong enough militarily to move their camps into
Nicaragua, so Azcona's administration appears likely to continue the
current policy of letting the contras stay while denying publicly that
they are there, according to the Honduran politicians and other obser
vers.
Regarding domestic policy, Azcona campaigned on a platform call
ing for improved programs in health care, education, land reform and
employment. But his choices of Cabinet ministers were strongly
criticized by politicians and other analysts of all political stripes.
These sources said that Azcona had given too many positions to
