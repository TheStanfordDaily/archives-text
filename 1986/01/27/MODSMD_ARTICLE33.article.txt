# Peace meeting in Mid-East
## 
### 
AMMAN, Jordan — King Hus
sein of Jordan met with Yasser
Arafat and the leadership of the
Palestine Liberation Organization
here yesterday in what could prove
to be decisive negotiations that de
termine the shape of future Middle
East peace efforts.
The Jordanian monarch and
Arafat held two meetings, first with
aides to the two men present for
talks and a working lunch at Hus
sein's al-Nedwa Palace and then
again in the evening for a private
discussion that lasted several hours.
Hussein and Arafat have not met
since November. They are assessing
the Middle East peace initiative
which they launched jointly last
Feb. 11 with a call for the establish
ment of a confederation of Jordan
and a Palestinian state in the Israeli
occupied West Bank of the Jordan
River.
The current round of talks has
generated considerable anticipation
because Hussein is expecting an an
swer from Arafat on the question of
whether the PLO now accepts two
U.N. Spmritv Council Resolutions,

242 and 338, which implicitly recog
nize Israel's right to exist within se
cure boundaries. The United States
has made that acceptance a condi
tion for PLO participation in any
peace talks, but the PLO has consis
tently rejected the resolutions.
Arafat's meeting with the King
also follows a flurry of diplomatic
activity on the Middle East. Richard
Murphy, the U.S. assistant secre
tary of state for Near East and South
Asian Affairs, met last week in Lon
don with both Hussein and Israeli
Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
Two Murphy aides, Roscoe Sud
darth and Wat Cluveries, were in
Amman yesterday, but it was un
clear if their visits were related to
the Arafat talks. Suddarth met with
Jordanian Prime Minister -'aid Rifai
earlier in the day.
The Israeli prime minister told a
news conference in London last
week that Jordan and Israel ap
peared to be getting closer to an
agreement on the terms under
which the two sides would be will
ing to negotiate, but he acknowl
edged that they still disagreed on

such major points as who would
represent the Palestinians in'the
negotiations.
Jordan has been pressing for the
convening of an international con
ference to settle the Middle East
problem and wants to include the
PLO and the Soviet Union in the
discussions.
Israel and the United States have
appeared wary of the conference
idea, advocating instead direct talks

between Jordan and Israel. In recent
days, however, both the United
States and Israel appeared to be
coming closer to accepting some
form of international conference.
Arafat's meetings with Hussein
are expected to last several days
since it is likely that Arafat will listen
to whatever proposals the King
received from Murphy in London
before making any decision on
Resolutions 242 and 338.
Only a few days ago, a high
ranking PLO official told reporters
here that Arafat would reject the
disputed resolutions.
But another PLO official said that
acceptance was still regarded as a
possibility, provided the United
States met PLO conditions. These
included a guarantee from Wash
ington that acceptance of the resolu
tions would insure PLO participa
tion in any peace negotiations, and
American recognition of Palestinian
rights to self-determination, a vague
formulation that has come to mean
an independent homeland, a con
cept unacceptable to the United
States.
