NAIROBI, Kenya — National Resistance Army
rebels have captured Kampala, the capital of
Uganda, and are establishing a new government,
an nra official announced here yesterday.
After two days of bitter fighting in Kampala
that claimed hundreds of casualties, "We regard
ourselves as the government of Uganda. We are
in effective control," Eirya Kategaya, a high
ranking NRA official, proclaimed.
He said the last of the Ugandan army troops in
the city surrended at 5.30 p.m. Saturday. Cheer
ing crowds in Kampala were reported late Satur
day to have welcomed the rebel troops, which
were described as well-organized and profes
sional, in contrast to ill-trained government
troops that had gone on sporadic looting sprees.
Kategaya said the National Resistance Army
was "preparing to set up an administration," but
denied that NRA head and one-time Ugandan
Defense Minister Yoweri Museveni, 43, would
automatically head it.
Gen. Tito Okello, the 71-year-old leader of the
military council that had ruled the country since a
coup last July, was quoted in The Sunday Nation
newspaper here as saying, "I am going back to
fight and regain power."

Western diplomats in Uganda contacting
Kenya by radio — telephones and telex lines were
out — said army resistance was virtually at an
end in Kampala and Entebbe, about 20 miles
south of the capital.
Most soldiers loyal to the leaders of the July
coup had fled, though some were still reported
on the eastern fringe of the city.
Officers loyal to Okeilo's 6-month-old regime
were said by the radio sources to be trying to rally
troops in Jinja and re-group for fresh fighting.
Jinja, about 50 miles east of Kampala, is the loca
tion of a strategic power plant that supplies the
capital with electricity.
The sources said electricity had been cut off
and water was in short supply in Kampala.
Museveni was reported to be in Kampala but
unable to address the nation because the radio
station was out of commission, the diplomats
said. Okello was reported to be in the Busia area
about 90 miles east of Kampala, though he may
also have crossed into Kenya.
The NRA's claims, if substantiated, mark the
beginning of the end of a guerrilla struggle that
began when Milton Obote won the presidency in

December 1980, sparking dissatisfaction and
widespread civil disorder.
Obote, deposed by Okello last july, initially
became prime minister in 1962 and led the British
protectorate to independence in October of that
year.
While Obote was attending the 1971 Common
wealth conference in Singapore, Maj. Gen. Idi
Amin, who had been suspended on suspicion of
murder, seized power on Jan. 25,1971. His eight
year reign was marked by repression and
atrocities that took the lives of between 50,000
and 300,000 persons, according to Amnesty Inter
national figures.
To detract military officers' attention from a
deteriorating domestic situation, Amin ordered
an invasion of Tanzania in October 1978. Tan
zanian President Julius Nyerere counterattacked
in January 1979 and his troops, meeting feeble
resistance, marched into a shattered Kampala in
April.
Following the brief rule of former Makrere Uni
versity head Yusufu Lule, Obote returned to taKe
part in the December 1980 presidential elections,
the first since independence.
