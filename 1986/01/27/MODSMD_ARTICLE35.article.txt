Odd geology revealed
PASADENA, Calif. — Miranda, a small
moon of Uranus, appeared in photographs
from Voyager 2 yesterday as a crazy quilt of dis
connected and misshapen cliffs, valleys,
canyons and glaciers that may force scientists to
rewrite chapters of geology textbooks.
"If you took all the bizarre geology in the
solar system and put it on one object, that
would be Miranda," said Laurence Soderblom
of the U.S. Geological Survey. "There is noth
ing like it in the solar system."
Miranda quickly emerged as the star of the
Voyager 2 flight, which passed within about
50,000 miles of Uranus, the seventh planet from
the sun, on Friday and used the planet's tre
mendous gravitational force like a slingshot to
fling the spacecraft toward a 1989 date with
Neptune.
As it passed Uranus, Voyager 2 also discov
ered evidence of 10 new thin rings, which
would double the number of known rings
around the planet. It also tracked odd cloud
formations in the atmosphere of Uranus, 1.8
billion miles from Earth.
Spectacular photographs of Miranda, one of
five moons that had been discovered from
Earth before Voyager 2 found 10 new smaller
ones, showed a surface covered with geological
oddities.
One region was dominated by massive oval
shaped cliffs that look like racetracks, another

appeared to be an enormous glacier flow that
disappeared beneath a huge mountain range. A
third had the shape of a gigantic arrowhead or
an upside-down chevron covered with frost.
Aerial inexperience
WASHINGTON — The safety hotline at the
Air Line Pilots Association is ringing more fre
quently these days as pilots report increasing
problems with the nation's air traffic control
system.
The pilots say that their complaints, which
include accounts of misunderstandings and
communications problems with controllers,
reflect a shortage of experienced air traffic con
trollers at a time when the level of traffic is
soaring.
"We have noticed a significant number of
calls with unusual circumstances occurring,"
said John O'Brien, head of the association's en
gineering and air safety department.
According to one report received by ALPA,
two passenger jets nearly collided over New
York last fall when one of the pilots mistakenly
understood that a clearance given to another
plane was his.
Although such snafus do not always put the
nation's airlines and air passengers in im
minent danger, the ALPA reports underscore
the fact that the nation's air traffic control sys
tem is functioning with a far less experienced

crop ol controllers than was on tne jot> before
Reagan fired 11,700 striking controllers in Au
gust 1981.
At the Federal Aviation Administration, Jack
Ryan, director of air traffic operations service,
insisted that the system was functioning well.
"As every day goes by," he said, "the people
who are there gain more experience."
Civil rights dispute
WASHINGTON — High-level Reagan Ad
ministration officials will sit down this week to
thrash out an internal dispute over whether to
begin the process of dismantling affirmative ac
tion rules that have underpinned the nation's
civil-rights policy for more than two decades,
White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan said
yesterday.
Regan said he, Attorney General Edwin
Meese and Secretary of Labor William Brock
would discuss proposed revisions in a 1965 ex
ecutive order issued by then-President Lyndon
Johnson which required federal contractors to
meet quotas for hiring of blacks, women and
other minorities.
Meese and other Administration con
servatives have long sought to dilute the
directive, possibly by replacing mandatory
hiring goals with voluntary ones. Brock has
resisted such a change.
