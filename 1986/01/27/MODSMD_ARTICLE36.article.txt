Tutu winds up tour
SANTA MONICA — South African Bishop
Desmond Tutu wound up a three-week, 12-city
U.S. tour with a celebrity-studded reception at
which he announced he has raised more than
$500,000 for the South African Council of
Churches.
"Speaking of the many, many who are not
able to be here, who may have spent as much
as 20 years in jail, like Nelson Mandela, it will
be wonderful for them to know they are not
alone, that the world has a heart," the black
Anglican prelate and critic of apartheid said
before he flew home late Saturday.
Tutu spokeswoman Lia Belli, wife of attorney
Melvin Belli, said yesterday that the bishop's
departure was kept secret for security reasons.
She said he would arrive in South Africa today
but wouldn't elaborate.
Compared to previous public appearances,
during which he called for economic sanctions

against his country and support of the
government-banned African National
Congress, Tutu was more casual Saturday
night at the reception in the home of state As
semblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica)
and Hayden's wife, actress Jane Fonda.
Tutu said more than $500,000 was donated
during the tour.
"It is going to be extremely difficult to put on
my hat that I have back home after meeting all
of you," he joked to the crowd that included
celebrities Ed Asner, Barbra Streisand, Tyne
Daly, Harry Belafonte, Richard Pryor, Quincy
Jones, Sidney Poitier, Sidney Pollack, Whoopi
Goldberg, Robert DeNiro, Sally Kellerman,
Carroll O'Connor and Sally Field.
Money will go to scholarships, food and shel
ter for families of political prisoners and for le
gal aid, said Mrs. Belli, co-chairwoman of the
Adelphia Foundation which was formed to or
ganize the fund-raising, security and schedul
ing for the bishop's tour.

Bacteria test opposed
CASTROVILLE — Plans for the first field test
of genetically altered bacterial agents have
drawn heated criticism in this sleepy corner of
northern Monterey County, the self-named
"Artichoke Capital of the World."
The experiment, reportedly scheduled for
mid-February by Advanced Genetic Sciences
Inc., could mark a watershed in the field of ge
netic engineering by proving the viability of ge
netically altered bacteria outside a laboratory.
The historic test was approved in November by
the Federal Evironmental Protection Agency.
But concerns over safety and the secrecy sur
rounding details of the test, a release of about 8
trillion altered bacteria into the environment,
have stirred some residents to demand that the
test be moved out of this, the nation's No. 1
vegetable-growing county.
