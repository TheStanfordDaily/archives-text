Heralding heterosexuality as
"God's plan for man," Rep. William
Dannemeyer (R.-Fullerton) Friday
night called for support of federal
public health legislation that would
close bathhouses and prevent gay
men from giving blood.
Dannemeyer, 56, a candidate for
the Republican nomination for the
U.S. Senate race in California, high

nenberg Auditorium that concluded
Stanford's four-day symposium on
Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS).
Dannemeyer told an audience of
300 about a bill he has introduced to
the U.S. House of Representatives
which, if passed, would make it a
federal offense for homosexual
males to give blood.

should be told that our blood supply

is contaminated," Dannemeyer
said. He warned that people under
going surgery should arrange for
their own blood supply.

own political gains." Decker also
accused Dannemeyer of ignoring
civil rights and using "cheap and
tawdry tactics" to "fuel his greedy
quest for power."
Members of the Rational Policy

both gay and non-gay community
members, protested Dannemeyer's
speech by holding up signs, some of
which read "Quarantine Ignorance
Not AIDS" and "Knowledge Is the
