Heralding heterosexuality as
"God's plan for man," Rep. William
Dannemeyer (R.-Fullerton) Friday
night called for support of federal
public health legislation that would
close bathhouses and prevent gay
men from giving blood.
Dannemeyer, 56, a candidate for
the Republican nomination for the
U.S. Senate race in California, high
lighted a panel discussion in An
nenberg Auditorium that concluded
Stanford's four-day symposium on
Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS).
Dannemeyer told an audience of
300 about a bill he has introduced to
the U.S. House of Representatives
which, if passed, would make it a
federal offense for homosexual
males to give blood.
"The people in this country
should be told that our blood supply

is contaminated," Dannemeyer
said. He warned that people under
going surgery should arrange for
their own blood supply.
According to Bruce Decker, chair
man of the California AIDS Advi
sory Committee and Dannemeyer's
opponent in the debate, Dan
nemeyer "feeds the fire of hysteria
by seeking to exploit AIDS for his
own political gains." Decker also
accused Dannemeyer of ignoring
civil rights and using "cheap and
tawdry tactics" to "fuel his greedy
quest for power."
Members of the Rational Policy
Deficiency Syndrome (RPDS) Edu
cation Project, a group composed of
both gay and non-gay community
members, protested Dannemeyer's
speech by holding up signs, some of
which read "Quarantine Ignorance
Not AIDS" and "Knowledge Is the

Only Defense."
Calling gay bathhouses "AIDS
factories," Dannemeyer said the
bathhouses should be shut down to
protect both the homosexual and
heterosexual communities. "It's
reprehensible that public authorities
are permitting them to continue to
operate," Dannemeyer said.
Dannemeyer said he has also
called for stricter measures in
dealing with people who have con
tracted AIDS. "I don't believe a per
son with AIDS should be permitted
to work in the health care profes
sion," Dannemeyer said.
Dannemeyer, who is a senior

member of the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on health
and environment, has also intro
duced a bill that would prevent
children with AIDS from attending
schools.
In an interview with The Daiiy
after the discussion, Dannemeyer
said he was "saddened" by Decker's
comments.
Asked if he had a message for
Stanford students, Dannemeyer
said, "I think that the AIDS
epidemic is causing all of us in our
culture to re-examine the practice of
conducting a monogamous life
style."
The symposium was sponsored
by the Stanford Human Biology
Program.
