# Selective Service gets lists of aid recipients
## 
### STEVE STREED Staff writer 
The Department of Education an
nounced Wednesday it will provide
the Selective Service with the names
of students who have applied for
federal financial aid this year, but
the decision does not affect the
Stanford Financial Aid Office's
policies regarding draft registration
legislation, according to Robert
Huff, director of Financial Aids.
"Stanford has always been
opposed to this particular aspect of
the law that a student being on aid
has to be known by the Selective
Service. . . . There is no reason to
believe that we would alter our view
with respect to this legislation,"
Huff said.
The statute requiring students ap
plying for federal financial aid to
state they have complied with the
rules of draft registration is dis
criminatory, Huff said.
"It discriminates against the
neediest of college students. If you
have circumstances so that you
don't need to apply for financial aid,
if vou are wealthy or your parents

are wealthy, then you are a student
who is not required to show the
Selective Service that he has regis
tered for the draft," whereas the
neediest of students must show that
they have registered if they want to
receive federal financial aid, Huff
said.
While students who apply for any
form of federal financial aid are re
quired by law to sign a form stating
they have registered for the draft or
are exempt from doing so, Stanford
students who object to draft
registration on grounds of con
science will be eligible for alternative
forms of financial aid from the
school, Huff said.
"That's always been our policy,
we have never precluded these stu
dents from funds if they can't as a
matter of conscience sign up for the
Selective Service," Huff said.
"We try through our own res
cources to allow a student to con
tinue his education. ... If a student
can't as a matter of conscience sign
up for federal aid then Stanford will
replace that aid from its own
funds," Huff said.
Stanford financial aid policy in the
past has been to substitute Stanford
loans and work-study for federal
grants and loans, Huff added.
Huff said that he did not think the
joining of the Department of Educa
tion and the Selective Service to find
the names of non-registrants was an
important issue for Stanford stu
dents.

"I don't think we're directly in
volved," he said.
Selective Service "already has a
list of any student who applies for a
Pell grant, because a student who
applies for a Pell grant must make a
direct application to the govern
ment," Huff said.
A student must apply for a federal
Pell grant before he is eligible for
any other forms of federal aid, such
as National Direct Student Loan or
college work-study subsidized by
the federal government, he said.
