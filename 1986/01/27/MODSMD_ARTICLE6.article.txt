### KELLY SUND Staff writer 
In an ASSU special election tomorrow
and Wednesday, students will vote on a
new constitution, two constitutional
amendments and a referendum advising
the ASSU to divest its funds from compan
ies doing business in South Africa.
The proposed constitution would replace
the current Senate, consisting of 40 mem
bers, with a Funding Board and a Policy
Board composed of nine members each. If
the new constitution is approved, students
will vote for two candidates for each group
in the next election. Under the current sys
tem, voters can choose up to 10 candidates.
The constitution also reduces the Council
of Presidents (COP) from four members to
three and creates the new position of Ad
ministrative Manager.
Senate Chair Carey White said he
believes the increased difficulty of being
elected will make the members of the
boards take their jobs more seriously. The
reduced size will force the members to
work harder and be more accountable for
their actions, he added.
COP member Mike Collins said that
funding for student groups will be im
proved under the new constitution because
the legislative committee that interviews a

group will be the body that approves the
amount of funding, eliminating unin
formed changes.
A proposed amendment which would al
low students, rather than the legislative
body, to set the total amount of the Associ
ation Fee would take effect under either
constitution.
Students would vote to raise or lower the
existing fee (currently almost $6 a quarter)
by specific percentages. The actual fee
would be the median of all the votes, elim
inating fringe votes and shifting the fee in
the direction favored by the majority of the
students.
According to White, the tentative plan is
to list all of the student groups that receive
a portion of the association fee. Individual
groups could not be hurt by this listing be
cause the Funding Board will set the
amounts given to each group. Groups ask
ing for more than $4,000 will be voted on
individually by students on a special fees
ballot.
A second amendment, valid only under
the current constitution, would modify the
term of the members of the Nominations
Commission, the group that nominates
students to University committees.
Currently the term overlaps with the
terms for both senators and University
committee members, preventing
members of these groups from ser
ving on the Nominations Commis
sion.
A referendum advising the ASSU
not to invest directly or indirectly in
companies doing business in South
Africa will also appear on the ballot.
If the ASSU complied with the ref
erendum, it would remove its funds
from the University's merged en

dowment pool and invest else
where.
Those funds total approximately
$1 million and the ASSU operates
on the interest, according to White.
Suggested possibilities for rein
vestment include portfolios which
contain no South Africa-related in
vestments, investment pools con
sisting of other universities in the
same position or the University's
new South Africa-free pension
fund.
