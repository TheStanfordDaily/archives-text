### MARY K. McDEVITT Senior staff writer 
Stanford hosted more than 1,700
foreign visitors last year, making
1985 a banner year for hosts at the
University, according to the annual
report of the Office of International
Visitors at Bechtel International
Center.
The number of international
visitors rose 28 percent from 1,335
visitors in 1984, according to the
report, prepared by office director
Maria-Mary Bun.
The office schedules meetings and
lunches for the guests with profes

sors and students who share ex
pertise in the visitors' fields of inter
est, and it also provides transporta
tion. The office is staffed by two full
time workers and 25 volunteers.
University administration and
services attracted 389 visitors, the
largest numbe* of any department,
according to the report.
Many visitors work at universities
abroad and are referred to Stanford
by government agencies, Bun said.
"They come here for an educational
process," she said.
"They all want to come to Stan
ford and see how it is organized,
how they can emulate it, how it's

financed and how the schools are
independent, because Stanford is
very different from universities
abroad. Their [universities] are
government-run and centralized,
and Stanford is private and
decentralized," Bun said.
The Hoover Institution hosted the
second largest number of foreign
visitors.
"Many have heard about the
Hoover Institution wherever they
come from. So they ask to see a col
lection from their country or to talk
with someone at the Hoover about
foreign policy," Bun said.
"Some people want to see the

tower and facilities, some want to
talk to individual scholars with ex
pertise in the fields they are inter
ested in and some want to use the
collections in the library and ar
chives," according to Erica Vener,
public affairs assistant at Hoover In
stitution.
Most foreign travelers come to the
United States for month-long visits
and make stops in Washington,
D.C., the Midwest and the West
Coast, Bun said.
"Invariably they ask to visit San
Francisco, to go to Stanford one day
and Berkeley the next."
