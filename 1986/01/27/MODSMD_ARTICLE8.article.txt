### LIZ EGAN Staff writer 
Two students were arrested Friday night in San Fran
cisco and cited with battery, disturbance of the peace
and indecent exposure at the Fairmont Hotel, according
to the San Francisco Central Police Station.
Senior Gary Rosenberg and Mark Broido, both mem
bers of the Kappa Alpha fraternity, were taken into
police custody, given misdemeanor citations and then
released. They will appear in court on March 18.
According toKA President George LeMaitre, the stu
dents were arrested after swimming across the pool in
the Tonga Room, a restaurant and bar in the hotel. The
swim was part of a celebration ending "KA Fun Week,"
LeMaitre said.
LeMaitre said that the swim "wasn't an official frater
nity event."
Asst. Dean of Residential Education Diana Conklin
was informed of the arrests but has not yet responded
to the fraternity, LeMaitre said. Conklin was un
available for comment yesterday.

Five hotel security guards restrained the two naked
swimmers, and some K A members claim the manner of
restraint was too forceful.
Sophomore KA member Brian Francis was also ar
rested on charges of battery and disturbance of the
peace for trying to protect the other fraternity members
from the guards.
Fairmont Hotel representatives were unavailable for
comment.
"The people at the Fairmont Hotel were really irra
tional and unhelpful. The people that actually did help
were the police when they came," senior KA member
Ron Mast said.
Mast added that Rosenberg ran out into the street and
was dragged back into the hotel by security guards
before police arrived. One guard drew a gun on the KA
members, he said.
Both Mast and LeMaitre said they expect the charges
will be dropped and that the Fairmont will make com
pensation for the forceful restraint. Mast said the frater
nity may file suit if the hotel does not make compensa
tion.
