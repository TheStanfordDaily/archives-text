Wednesday, January 29, 1986 5-6:30 p.m.
School of Law, Crown Quad, Room 180
TAX ON TUITION CREDIT
FOR NON-EXEMPT TA'S AND RA'S
Non-exempt teaching assistants and research assistants have up to now
paid tax on their salaries (stipends), not on the value of tuition credit
provided as part of their assistantships. As of January 1, 1986 they are
required to pay tax on tuition credits as well as salaries (stipends).
(Non-exempt teaching assistants and research assistants are graduate
students working for the University, but not for the degree).
What in the law has changed and why?
What are the liabilities of non-exempt TA's and RA's, and of the
University?
What are we doing?
There will be presentations by representatives of Graduate Studies,
the Public Affairs Office, the Legal Office, and the Controller's Office,
followed by open discussion.
NOTE: This forum addresses changes in the tax law that are already
in effect. We will be monitoring Congressional actions during the next
month to see whether this change in the law is reversed.
A later forum will address possible changes in tax-treatment of
scholarships and fellowships as part of the new Tax Reform Bill being
considered in Congress.
