# Student's claim rejected
## 
### ALLISON HARTWELL Editorial staff 
The University has denied a claim
filed by sophomore David Potter for
$100,000 in damages resulting from
his arrest at an Oct. 14 anti-apartheid
sit-in, according to Staff Counsel Iris
Brest.
In the claim, Potter maintained
that Stanford police officers used
"unlawful force" when they imple
mented the compliance-pain hold at
the time of his arrest.
"I was surprised the University
completely rejected it (the claim),"
Potter said, adding that he was disap
pointed that there have been no
punitive measures against the officers
involved at the arrests.
The University mailed the denial
Friday, Brest said.
Potter said he will "continue press
ing" the case despite the denials and
may seek the aid of the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). He
said he filed the claim "to publicize
the brutality of the police," and not
fbr the monetary compensation.
A similar claim filed by senior
Robby Perkins for $600,100 was
denied last week. Perkins submitted
his claim for injuries he said he
received at the site of the arrest Oct.
11 and at the Santa Clara County Jail,
where he was taken after his arrest
and allegedly beaten.
In addition to the claims against
Stanford, both Potter and Perkins
earlier this month filed claims with
Santa Clara County. Both claims
were rejected. Potter's on Friday and
Perkins' on Jan. 15.
Another student arrested at the
Oct. 11 sit-in, junior Kaylen Worth,
also filed a claim for $100,000 with
Santa Clara County. He said he
received word that his claim had been
denied in a letter last week.
Worth said has not heard from the
University since he fi'.td a claim last
week, although he said he expects it
to be rejected also.
Like Potter, Worth and Perkins
said they hope the ACI.U will take
their cases, although neither has met
formally with officials from the or
ganization. Perkins said he is optimis
tic that the AC'LU will take his case,
adding that the organization "has
been very helpful so far."
Worth, Perkins and Potter last
night joined 15 other students who

had been arrested at anti-apartheid
sit-ins in October to view video tapes
taken by the Stanford police of the
Oct. 1 1, 14 and 16 arrests. The videos
were shown at Columbae House.
The tapes were obtained by sub
poena by Tony Press, a Los Altos at
torney assigned to Perkins' defense
by Santa Clara County Conflict Ad
ministration. Press said he is one of
six attorneys involved in defending
the protesters in their criminal cases
and not directly involved in anv civil

suit the protesters may file.
Perkins said that the video tapes
shown last night "fundamentally dif
fered" from those he had viewed last
year with Law Prof. John Kaplan,
who headed an investigation into
charges of police brutality at the re
quest of University President Donald
Ken nedy.
"Parts were cut out," Perkins said,
adding that the sound quality so poor
that protesters' screams were
muffled.
