# International law is not just symbolic, relief worker says

While attacks by terrorist organiza
tions tend to convince people that in
ternational law is an artifice, it is ac
tually a major component of multi
national efforts to assist civilians in
war-torn countries, a student repre
sentative to the American Red Cross
said here yesterday.
David Schvartzman, a junior in in
ternational relations and American
Red Cross representative to the Con
ference on International Law in War
saw, noted that El Salvador, a nation
particularly affected by recent inter
nal violence, has been slowly learning
the lesson that international
humanitarian law is more than just a
convention.
Schvartzman outlined for a Bechtel
International Center audience yester
day afternoon the steps that the In
ternational Red Cross has taken in
the past five years to alleviate suffer
ing in the Central American nation.
Schvartzman said that the assump
tion that international law is a set of
powerless dictums is demonstrably
false. The Geneva Conventions, a
body of 1949 international agree
ments that empowered the Red Cross
to come into warring nations and give
aid to civilians, has saved in
numerable lives. It has also generated
a "humanitarian reflex" that has en
couraged nations to reject violence
and to refuse to display indifference

toward human suffering, according to
Schvartzman.
" The reason that (international
law) needs to be taught is to show
people that in times of war, there are
certain people (who) don't deserve to
be treated worse than they would be
as combatants," Schvartzman added.
While admitting that there is only
so much the Red Cross can do in any
given situation — by law it can only
enter a country at war if it is urged to
do so by other governments —
Schvartzman said that these limita
tions have not prevented the organi
zation from working effectively in El
Salvador.

The Red Cross has progressed
"dramatically" in increasing the num
ber of visits the government and the
rebel forces will allow it to make to
prisoners of war, according to
Schvartzman. In 1981, the Red Cross
made 1,211 visits to 207 interment
camps. That number had jumped to
1,866 visits to 260 camps by 1984.
The organization has also per
suaded the government to allow it to
undertake efforts to trace missing
people and to provide relief to
villages that have been hit in battle.
Schvartzman said an intensified pro
gram of charlas, in which Red Cross
officials visit villages and have discus
sions with the community to outline
health-related improvement targets,
such as water sanitation, has had a
significant impact on hard-to-reach
areas in El Salvador.
Schvartzman said the Red Cross
generally does not reveal conditions
in prison camps and villages for fear
of jeopardizing an already tenuous
relationship with the government.
Coming out with lurid stories of
dilapidation in rural areas could also
endanger the organization's
credibility in the 92 other countries in
which the Red Cross has active
delegations, he said.
Schvartzman added, however, that
this policy of discretion is in keeping
with the organization's traditional eth
ic of impartiality in the spate of in
ternal conflicts that are going on
every day around the globe.
