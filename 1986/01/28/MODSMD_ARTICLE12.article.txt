# Police kick off alcohol program
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
In response to what police are calling "a significant
problem with alcohol at Stanford,'' the Department of
Public Safety has launched an alcohol awareness out
reach program for University residences.
In a letter distributed last week to resident assistants,
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington, director of
the University's Department of Public Safety, des
cribed the program as "casual in both format and
tone."
The program, in which Stanford police officers meet
with students in residences, "includes facts about alco
hol's effects on the body as well as laws and legal pro
cedures regarding alcohol," Herrington said.
The program also looks at the consequences of being
arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol
(DUI), featuring a review of official police procedures,
what arrestees can expect in jail, and trial options for
accused DUI offenders.
"The Department of Public Safety and the Univer
sity can only do so much to prevent unfortunate
alcohol-related incidents: the remaining efforts must

come from the students. ... We believe that the in
formed student is better-equipped to make decisions
about his her alcohol consumption which will not lead
to damage of property or injur\ to themselves or
others," Herrington said.
According to Herrington, the Stanford community
has experienced "increases in alcohol-related injuries,
students unable to care for themselves due to over
indulgence in alcohol and students driving while under
the influence of alcohol."
Stanford Police Capt. Marvin Moore said that in the
13 years he has been with the Stanford police the num
ber of alchohol-related incidents "has probably in
creased threefold."
"The days of the one-kegger party are over.'' he
said. "Now they bring in a truck (with beer). I know we
have more alcohol-related calls now.
"There's a significant problem with alcohol at Stan
ford," Moore said, noting that while Stanford has been
fortunate to avoid a large number of alcohol-related
fatalities, "we're surely headed that way."
There were approximately 55 DUIs at the Univer
sity from Jan. 1 to Dec. 9 of last year, Moore said, add
ing that offenders included both students and people
from outside the Stanford community.
