## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper See beyond Tutu speech 
### 
When Bishop Desmond Tutu appeared last Tuesday
in Memorial Auditorium, he received a standing ova
tion from the capacity crowd before speaking a single
word. He entertained the crowd with jokes, emotional
anecdotes and witticisms and was serenaded with
chants of " Divest now." Few who witnessed the speech
were disappointed, and most left with a smiles on their
faces.
Those unable to stand in ticket lines for more than
an hour jammed Skilling and Terman auditoriums to
view the historic speech on a broadcast by the Stanford
Instructional Television Network.
Before the speech, Tutu was repeatedly compared
by a panel of South African scholars to Mahatma
Ghandi and Martin Luther King, Jr. Clearly, Tutu, the
winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his opposi
tion to apartheid, has charisma and popularity few can
match.
However, beneath the entertainment and hoopla of
the event lies an issue of the greatest importance —
violence and racism in South Africa — and that fact
must not be lost amid the excitement of a man as wor
shiped and awe-inspiring as Tutu.
The same man who cracked jokes about crocodile
hunting told of the tragic relocation and starvation of

millions of South African blacks and called for U.S.
sanctions against the South African government.
He said that he, a Nobel laureate and clergyman,
cannot vote in his native land, whereas any white 18-
year-old can. "The South African government lets me
travel with a [special] document. ... In the space
where nationality is described, mine is described as
'undeterminable at present,' " he added, referring to
the government's effort to assign every black South
African to an independent "homeland."
The South African government is not fooled by
Tutu's humor and congeniality. Worried by Tutu's ef
fect on foreign audiences, a representative of the South
African government called Tutu's speeches, which are
becoming more favorable toward black terrorist organ
izations working to bring about change in the country,
"shocking and deplorable." The state-operated radio
accused Tutu of fomenting dissent and discouraging
peaceful solutions to the race conflict.
Tutu is a powerful force in South Africa and an
emerging leader in the struggle for racial equality. To
go to his speech and give him a standing ovation,
however, is not enough. Behind the glamour of a great
hero is the reality of a desperate situation, and all who
understand Tutu must commit themselves to change.
