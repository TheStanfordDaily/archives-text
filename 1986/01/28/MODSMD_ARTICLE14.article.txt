Banks hits mark
I agree with R. Richard Banks
("Stanford lacks academic rigor,"
The Daily, Jan. 27) that one of
the worst things about Stanford is its
grading system. Whatever the origins
of the present system, it seems to me
it is students' attitudes about grades
that perpetuates the status quo. Al
though I am relatively new to the
Stanford faculty, I feel I am continu
ally confronted with students' irra
tional perception of the relationship
between their work in class and the
grade they should receive for it. What
disturbs me most is the irresponsible
attitude of students who miss classes,
who come to class not having done
readings or assignments, who do not
follow directions or take seriously
policies given to them verbally or in
writing, and yet think they have
reasonable cause to challenge, or at
the very least be bitter about, a grade
which takes that behavior into ac
count through objective and equi
table means.
Stanford's elitism generates the
feeling among many of its students
that because one is very bright and
has always been in the upper scholas
tic echelon that it is somehow mean,
wrong or unfair for an instructor to
establish standards which might pos
sibly lead to an evaluation of one's
work as average. I believe that we as
a faculty are remiss if we do not per

serve the integrity of our students,
both in effort and accomplishment,
and if we do not assign grades which
truly reflect that expectation.

Hoover ire ironic
I could not resist a chuckle when I
read about how some of the Hoover
groupies were griping about the Casa
Zapata mural (The Daily, Jan. 23).
During my six years on U.S.
campuses, I have always enjoyed the
way you Americans — both of the left
and the right — celebrate your First
Amendment.
But it never ceases to surprise me
when one group claims to be hurt or
slandered by the political expression
of another group. I suppose muralist
Antonio Burciaga put it quite aptly
when he told a Daily reporter that the
Hoover folks "know how to dish it
out, but they just can't take it. . .

Unite against
AIDS threat
If there's one thing I've learned
since coming to Stanford, it's that the
easiest way to deal with the gray areas

of certain issues is to create artificial
boundaries of black and white. This is
definitely an easy way to deal with
seemingly unsolvable social, moral
and political dilemmas, but it's also a
cop-out.
Attending the panel discussion on
AIDS last Friday night made me
realize that this dichotomization
results in dangerously closed minds.
It was interesting (and disturbing) to
note that the discussion rapidly
deteriorated into a verbal war be
tween terrified homophobes and
equally frightened supporters of gay
rights. Both groups feared for their
lives: One felt threatened biologi
cally, while the other feared societal
repression (or worse) as a result of
this very real biological threat.
Creating black/white barriers by at
taching connotations such as natu
ral/unnatural, good/bad,
moral/immoral, normal/perverse to
the terms straight/gay makes us forget
the fact that both sub-groups belong
to the species homo sapiens, and
destroys all hope for a truly con
structive dialogue on related issues.
We are both fighting for survival in an
often hostile environment. Instead of
wasting our time and energy fighting
one another over the essentially
private (and trivial) issue of sexual
orientation, we must join forces and
face this threat together— rationally,
united and strong.
