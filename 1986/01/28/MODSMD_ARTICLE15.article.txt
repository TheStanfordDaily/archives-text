## COP members defend new constitution 
### 
After my initial disbelief upon reading Eric Die
sel's charmingly libelous letter in yesterday's Daily
("New constitution is unjust, racist"), I tried to
think of two words to describe what I had just ex
perienced. This is what came to mind: utter and
complete bullshit. This was not two words, I realize,
but it sure seemed to describe the whole affair ac
curately.

Most of all I found the charge of racism abhor
rent and altogether unjustified. I could not help but
take it personally, as Mr. Diesel no doubt intended.
As anyone who reads the document can immedi
ately attest, there is not the slightest hint of racism
anywhere at all within it. The very idea is absurd.
Mr. Diesel's claim that there would be no black
graudate students and "only about 1 percent
[black] undergraduates" (where the hell did that
statistic come from? It could easily describe the
current ASSU Senate, which currently has no black
graduate students and only one black undergradu
ate student) is the ludicrous imagining of a
gentleman who is certainly not reading the new
constitution, if indeed he has read anything prior to
publishing these statements and is not simply
reeling these things off the top of his head. "There
would never have been a Hispanic senator," he fur
ther claims. What the *@!# are you talking about,
Eric? None of this is rooted in the slightest, small
est approximation of reality. Nowhere in his letter
is Mr. Diesel able even to quote from the new con

stitution to back up his jaundiced ravings. This is no
coincidence — the document simply does not do
the things he discusses. Mr. Diesel's use of the term
"racist" to describe this work is disparagingly self
serving and is an insult to the very individuals
whose support he so desperately wishes to engage.
Yes, the ASSU needs more minority involve
ment. It is not, however, a question for this docu
ment — it is a need which exists right now, right
here, with the current set-up. The current low par
ticipation of minorities is not, will not be, and could
not be a factor of rules limiting their ability to run.
Quite the opposite. Mr. Diesel deigns to suggest
that somehow the new constitution will keep stu
dents from voting for black people. He is not ad
dressing the constitution at all — he is labeling this
campus as racist, and not crediting it the intelli
gence to vote for the best candidates. It is an ex
tremely disturbing world view.

'As anyone who reads the document can immedi
ately attest, there is not the slightest hint of racism
anywhere at all within it.'

The gentleman's remarks in regard to graduate
students are equally false and misleading. In noting
that the number of graduate students is reduced, he
fails to note (oh-so-conveniently) that the number
of undergraduates is reduced equally, and that the
same number of graduate students serve on the

Funding and Policy Boards as do undergraduates,
just as in the present system that Mr. Diesel seems
all of a sudden so touchingly fond of. Equal voice,
equal vote. Furthermore, there is nothing senseless
about removing the wordy and confusing districting
of graduate students from the constitution and
placing them in the by-laws, where they belong.
This does not mean that districting is gone.
Finally, the gentleman suggests that the new con
stitution would be damaging to student organiza
tions. Interesting, Mr. Diesel. In the Elections
Handbook, he claims that no one involved in
writing the constitution has been involved in a Pro
gram Board funded group. So doing, he apparently
discounts our long-standing association with
SURE, KZSU, the Stanford Chaparral (funded
through the Pubications Board), the Women's
Center and other groups. Suffice to say: I am a
Chappie before I am a president.

Mr. Diesel's remarks are unfounded, unjustified,
and just plain wrong. Were it not so pathetic, the
consistency of his inaccuracy would be admirable,
or at least amusing.
Michael Collins is chairman of the Council of Presi
dents; Timothy Quirk is a COP member.
