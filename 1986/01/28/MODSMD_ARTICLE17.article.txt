# Wobegon, Ralph and Wanda

It's in a restaurant, or perhaps a cafe. Warm, well-lit.
Perhaps jazz music plays in the background. Maybe not.
Linoleum floors, vinyl seat-covers, overhead flourescent
lights. It doesn't really matter. Use your imagination, set
the scene, set the mood.
The table is just far enough apart that the two need to
lean in on their elbows to speak. Midge, or Maude, refills
their coffee cups.
"But you must do something. You know, meaningful,"
she said.
"I've thought. I mean, it's been a project. But there's
nothing to say, absolutely nothing," he said.
"Of course there is. South Africa, Tutu, terrorism.
Write about how we all mistreat each other. You know,
we should give more to the poor. It's always a good topic
— but yet it isn't Christmas," she said.
"You're right, it isn't Christmas," he said.
She plays with her coffee cup, now readjusts her skirt.
"Write about subjectivity and objectivity. You know,
you can be philosophical, and approach the problem com
plexly. Write about Ayn Rand. Impress the reader," she
said.

"I suppose if I knew what subjectivity and objectivity
were I could write about them. I know how subjective I
am, but that's not what you mean, is it?"
"No," she said.
"Right."
"O.K. Write about love," she said.
"About love? What a crazy idea!" he said.
"No. No, really. Write about the search for the perfect
love, how it matters more than all these wordly prob
lems," she said.
"But I'd be lying," he said.
"You're right. You would be. But it's a start."
Maude comes by to top off the cups.
"Write about death," she said. "Write a witty story
about how we concern ourselves with living to such an ex
tent that we forget about death."
"You're kidding. My roommate says he doesn't have
time to read anything in The Daily but the classifieds and
you're telling me to write about death? You must be
crazy," he said.
"No, I'm serious," she said. "Everyone writes about
important things — divestment, race relations, terrorism
— but no one writes about the Big Things. You know,
ones we think about everyday. Where am I going? Why
am I going there? And will there be a McDonald's when I
get there? Talk about issues that relate to people's
everyday life and thoughts."
"Look. I'm expected to be erudite, logical and witty,"

he said. "I'm supposed to present an opinion about politi
cal happenings, not about personal ones. And I'm
supposed to use good grammar, and a thesis, body and
conclusion. Where is love included in that?"
"I don't know. Try it," she said.
"But they don't want that, particularly on a first
column," he said. "Maybe I could write a serious, more
conventional article, and if I got a spot then write about
whatever interests me."
"How deceitful. I'm shocked," she said.
"No, really. It's all a game, you know. They expect a
certain kind of columm, and I'd be going against the grain.
If I spoke of death — phew! That's out quick. Love might
have a better chance, but it's still a long shot," she said.
"Look. Just write about something that interests you.
Perhaps you could write about whether art has a purpose
or not. You know, one character is really idealist, and
believes art and words can change the world. The other
thinks art is meaningless, and that it can't change anything
or anybody. You know, write about writing. A meta
column," she said.
"No way, Jose! You are crazy. If I speak of death or
love, maybe — but a column about writing a column? No
one would care. And you're supposed to have a topic,
besides," he said.
"I've got it. Write about how some people have it all to
gether while others don't," she said. "It'd be really easy
for you."
"Funny, funny. It would be easy, though. I could write
about how excited I am now to get mail from the U.S.
Army telling me what a great career I could have. It'd be
enlightening for all those non-directed, fuzzy people out
there," he said.
"Well, I don't know. I've given you some ideas," she
said. "You could write about two characters who sit at
some table and discuss topics to write about. You know,
the first week could be a general preview of some topics,
and then after that you could allow the characters to grow,
to become characters instead of mouthpieces for the au
thor. It might be interesting."
"Sort of like Lake Wobegon, or Ralph and Wanda in
Time," he said.
"Right," she said. "You'd have a lot of leeway to dis
cuss things from different viewpoints. It'd be a challenge."
"But how would anyone know what I was writing about
in such a column? It sounds so different — you know, it
really doesn't say anything," he said.
"I guess they just have to trust you," she said.
"Imagine that. What power. Ah, I can see it. I just have
to figure out what to write," he said.
"Yeah, that's always the problem. But you have ideas,
go with them," she said.
"Alright, I will. Til go with them," he said. "Who
knows, it might work. And after all, there really isn't
much to lose, is there?"
"Besides a few hours sleep, I don't believe there is," she
said.
"Alright, I'll try it,"he said. "And we'll see."
"Good," she said. "Try it. And good luck."
