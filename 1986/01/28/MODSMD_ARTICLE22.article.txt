## BUG ME 
### ANDREW McCLUNG Staff Writer 
Okay, folks, this is it. This is the last of
the Michoacans, buds. I hope you en
joy it.
Each night I bicycle way far out of my way
to cruise past the Rodin sculpture garden, in
hopes of viewing the masterpieces of art con
tain therein. Lately, however, I have noticed
that only a few of the sculptures are appropri
ately illuminated. Why is this? I had been
laboring under the impression that the whole
garden was to be fully lit 24 hours-a-day, and
it pains me so grievously to discover other
wise. What gives? — Robert Sinclair
For those of you who aren't keeping up
with your materials science lore, Prof.
Sinclair is a world-famous pioneer in trans
mission electron microscopy, and you can
thus imagine that we're mighty honored to
have him here with us in our column this
week.
Sinclair will hopefully be gratified to learn
that discussions with Museum Curator Frank
Comer and Art Prof. Albert Elsen revealed
that the lighting system that is currently in
place in the garden is only a temporary sys
tem.
However, just as the Manzanita Park con
dominiums (not "condominia") were de
signed to serve only as temporary housing,
the "temporary" lighting system in the gar
den has overstayed its welcome.
You see, the more permanent system that
originally was to be in use by last summer
had to be designed from scratch, because of
the lighting and weather conditions under
which it was to operate. Specifically, the idea
was to set up the lighting to mimic the
candlelit condition of Rodin's studio; that
way, people could view the sculptures as they
appear in natural sunlight during the daytime
and as they used to appear in Rodin's studio
at night.
This is a great idea, but given that no out
door lighting systems are made that can si
multaneously simulate candlelight and
withstand Stanford's winter quarter weather,
problems arise. There is a host of agencies,
both on-campus and otherwise, who insist on
testing and approving radical new lighting
designs, especially those that people are
going to be walking on top of (the lamps are
to be installed flush with the ground, like
those in Governor's Corner). These groups
abhor big-time electrical short-circuits, par
ticularly those in which museum-goers serve
as the short-circuiting element.
Furthermore, since the lights are to be
ground-mounted, all the wiring must be sub
terranean, and therefore interlaced with
those fabulous sprinkler systems that we ap
preciate so much. You know, it's funny, but
down there underground, a lot of dirt and
gunk gets into sprinkler valves and electrical
junction boxes, and steadily drizzling rain
does not make the situation any better. So
the designing process that obviates the need
for constant uprooting of system for

maintenance purposes becomes a bit tricky.
Once the design and approval details are
finally worked out (and it's getting near the
end even as I write), the lighting fixtures and
their controls and connections must be
manufactured and installed. All of that
should be finished by springtime. Or so it is
hoped.
Now, it turns out that while I was answer
ing that last question, Prof. Elsen asked me
the following:
Why does The Daily persist, year in and
year out, in giving aid and comfort to vandals
who deface and destroy works of art that have
been brought to campus at great trouble and
expense? It is extremely difficult to persuade
donors of art that it is worthwhile to contrib
ute to the cultural education of the community
when every time a statue or building is
defaced (spray-painted, hammered,
"decorated", etc.) The Daily runs a photo
graph on page one that portrays the van
dalism as a harmlessly humorous stunt. —
Albert Elsen
As you may have suspected, Prof. Elsen, a
quick survey of some of The Daily staff indi
cates that they do not feel that the reporting
of a crime encourages the commission of
similar crimes. Doubtless, too, the major
television networks feel that protracted
video coverage of terrorist activities in no
way supports the desire of terrorists to draw
attention to themselves and their various
causes.

My own guess, which is admittedly un
solicited, is that art, like any expression of
emotion or opinion, provokes emotional
responses from those who experience it.
Whether a printed description of what are
typically considered to be unreasonably
harsh responses encourages that sort of
response is fodder for psychology theses. But
the question of whether we can reasonably
expect a bunch of 20-year-olds running a
small newspaper to be significantly more re
sponsible in reporting local crimes than the
major news media themselves is less certain
to be answered by scholarly endeavor. Espe
cially when it is a minority of other 20-year
olds, equally gifted and privileged, who are
committing the acts of vandalism in what
they think is a spirit of collegiate fun.
