Officials of Syufy Enterprises,
the company that owns the new
Century Cinemas in Mountain
View, guard the success of their latest
movie theater complex in the same
manner that military personnel guard
top-secret defense information.
When asked to describe how busi
ness has been for the Century since it
opened last November, Syufy repre
sentative Nancy Klasky responded by
saying, "It's doing extremely well."
How well? "Extremely well."
All outward signs would seem to
indicate that the 10-plex has been
doing "extremely well" and then
some. On Friday and Saturday
evenings, lines for the Century's
several box-office windows spill out
onto the streets, and the theater's
"acres and acres" of free parking
seem at times unable to accommo
date the number of cars passing
through. The Century's success,
however, has caused great pain for
other local movie theaters.
, Renaissance Rialto, which locally
owns the Stanford, the Park, the
Guild and the Fine Arts, has probably
been most directly affected by the
Century complex, which company
representative Allen Michaam says
"obviously hasn't been good for busi
ness." Syufy, according to Michaam,
has a "total monopolization of the
market and we're not happy to see
it."
' Michaam says, "We feel we have
the same right to play the same
pictures that the (Century does)" be
cause the market for the the two
chains is different. The Renaissance
Rialto theaters, Michaam says, have
traditionally catered to Stanford stu
dents and people living in Menlo Park
and Palo Alto. People in this market
find it inconvenient to go to "the
swamps" to see a movie, especially
Stanford students who don't have
cars. Michaam argues that if both the
Century and Renaissance Rialto
theaters were allowed to show cur
rent Hollywood films, business for
the Century wouldn't be hurt signifi
cantly since most of its business
comes from Mountain View and
other South Bay cities.
Since Syufy Enterprises has more
clout with motion picture distributors
than Renaissance Rialto (Syufy has
250 theaters in its chain, Renaissance
only 14), it can demand that dis
tributors lease films to Century
Cinemas exclusively and consistently.
This! "unreasonable clearance" leads
to wthe Century's monopoly on
popular Hollywood features, and
leaves other theaters in the area fight
ing for the spoils.

Michaam finds this practice
"unreasonable," and while Renais
sance is thinking of ways to combat
tbe. proble.ni, Michaam says any ac
tion would take too much time and
money, and would be a battle of
"David versus Goliath . . . Chains are
always going to be more powerful."

Michaam thinks distributors should
award films to chains and theaters on
an individual basis.
Until such action happens, local
theaters will be fighting for the distri
bution rights of films Syufy has
decided not to exhibit: "art" films.
Renaissance, which has until recently

exhibited titles like "Poltergeist,"
"Pee Wee's Big Adventure" and
"Jagged Edge," is now showing films
like "Ran," "The Official Story" and
"The Trip to Bountiful." Calling art
films the "lower end of the market
place," Michaam says the chain is
"still making a profit, (but) not as

much as we used to." And he admits
that Renaissance has become a threat
to the traditional art film exhibitor in
the area, Landmark Theaters.
Landmark, which currently owns
the Aquarius and the Bijou (which
reopened on Jan. 24), has had to
fight with Renaissance for the rights

for potentially "hot" art films like
"Brazil" (which it didn't get the rights
for) and "Hail Mary" (which it did).
To make matters worse, Old Mill Six
has indicated that it will soon join
competition for the art film product.
Rick San Vicente, District
Manager of American Multi Cinema
(AMC), the chain that owns the Old
Mill, says one or two of the theater's
screens will be devoted solely to art
product by this summer.
San Vicente says, "Syufy has been
aggressive in the marketplace . . .
we've been affected (but) we still
have our loyal customers." San
Vicente says the Old Mill's market is
a "more upscale, well-educated audi
ence" that doesn't really attend the
kind of films the Century now offers.
By devoting part of the theater to art
films, San Vicente says the Old Mill is
"giving the customer what it wants"
and competition for art films won't be
that bad because "there's enough
product for everyone."
Rumors have been circulating
lately that the Old Mill might be
bought out and converted to hotel
space. San Vicente claims that such
reports are unsubstantiated, don't
give specific plans, and "as far as I'm
concerned, we're not for sale."
Michaam, responding to the rumor
of the Old Mill's possible sale, said it
won't have much of an effect on the
market because Syufy will "gobble
up" the films the Old Mill would have
shown; with 10 screens, he says, the
Century can accommodate many
numbers of films at one time.
Jude Lutge, owner of the New Var
sity, says the Century hasn't had any
effect on her theater because of the
Varsity's repertory format. The big
gest threat the Varsity faces — a
threat also faced by the Aquarius and
the Bijou — is an uncertain future
provided by local realtor Charles
"Chop" Keenan, who recently
bought the properties of all three
theaters.
Each theater has been leased out to
the current theater owners for the
next few years and Keenan says he
has "not a clue" what he's going to do
with the properties once the current
contracts expire. He adds, however,
that "if I could lease (the properties)
as something that would make
money, I might. Wouldn't you?"
Lutge, who will have operated the
Varsity for 12 years this May, is
raising money to buy the Varsity
property and maintain it as a theater.
She says, "This is my life, it's not just
a piece of property ... I'm sure he
wants to make retail space" out of the
property. Keenan says he's heard
nothing about Lutge's proposal to
buy the Varsity.

property and maintain it as a theater.
She says, "This is my life, it's not just
a piece of property ... I'm sure he
wants to make retail space" out of the
property. Keenan says he's heard
nothing about Lutge's proposal to
buy the Varsity.

Officials of Syufy Enterprises,
the company that owns the new
Century Cinemas in Mountain
View, guard the success of their latest
movie theater complex in the same
manner that military personnel guard
top-secret defense information.
When asked to describe how busi
ness has been for the Century since it
opened last November, Syufy repre
sentative Nancy Klasky responded by
saying, "It's doing extremely well."
How well? "Extremely well."
All outward signs would seem to
indicate that the 10-plex has been
doing "extremely well" and then
some. On Friday and Saturday
evenings, lines for the Century's
several box-office windows spill out
onto the streets, and the theater's
"acres and acres" of free parking
seem at times unable to accommo
date the number of cars passing
through. The Century's success,
however, has caused great pain for
other local movie theaters.
, Renaissance Rialto, which locally
owns the Stanford, the Park, the
Guild and the Fine Arts, has probably
been most directly affected by the
Century complex, which company
representative Allen Michaam says
"obviously hasn't been good for busi
ness." Syufy, according to Michaam,
has a "total monopolization of the
market and we're not happy to see
it."
' Michaam says, "We feel we have
the same right to play the same
pictures that the (Century does)" be
cause the market for the the two
chains is different. The Renaissance
Rialto theaters, Michaam says, have
traditionally catered to Stanford stu
dents and people living in Menlo Park
and Palo Alto. People in this market
find it inconvenient to go to "the
swamps" to see a movie, especially
Stanford students who don't have
cars. Michaam argues that if both the
Century and Renaissance Rialto
theaters were allowed to show cur
rent Hollywood films, business for
the Century wouldn't be hurt signifi
cantly since most of its business
comes from Mountain View and
other South Bay cities.
Since Syufy Enterprises has more
clout with motion picture distributors
than Renaissance Rialto (Syufy has
250 theaters in its chain, Renaissance
only 14), it can demand that dis
tributors lease films to Century
Cinemas exclusively and consistently.
This! "unreasonable clearance" leads
to wthe Century's monopoly on
popular Hollywood features, and
leaves other theaters in the area fight
ing for the spoils.

Michaam finds this practice
"unreasonable," and while Renais
sance is thinking of ways to combat
tbe. proble.ni, Michaam says any ac
tion would take too much time and
money, and would be a battle of
"David versus Goliath . . . Chains are
always going to be more powerful."

Michaam thinks distributors should
award films to chains and theaters on
an individual basis.
Until such action happens, local
theaters will be fighting for the distri
bution rights of films Syufy has
decided not to exhibit: "art" films.
Renaissance, which has until recently

exhibited titles like "Poltergeist,"
"Pee Wee's Big Adventure" and
"Jagged Edge," is now showing films
like "Ran," "The Official Story" and
"The Trip to Bountiful." Calling art
films the "lower end of the market
place," Michaam says the chain is
"still making a profit, (but) not as

much as we used to." And he admits
that Renaissance has become a threat
to the traditional art film exhibitor in
the area, Landmark Theaters.
Landmark, which currently owns
the Aquarius and the Bijou (which
reopened on Jan. 24), has had to
fight with Renaissance for the rights

for potentially "hot" art films like
"Brazil" (which it didn't get the rights
for) and "Hail Mary" (which it did).
To make matters worse, Old Mill Six
has indicated that it will soon join
competition for the art film product.
Rick San Vicente, District
Manager of American Multi Cinema
(AMC), the chain that owns the Old
Mill, says one or two of the theater's
screens will be devoted solely to art
product by this summer.
San Vicente says, "Syufy has been
aggressive in the marketplace . . .
we've been affected (but) we still
have our loyal customers." San
Vicente says the Old Mill's market is
a "more upscale, well-educated audi
ence" that doesn't really attend the
kind of films the Century now offers.
By devoting part of the theater to art
films, San Vicente says the Old Mill is
"giving the customer what it wants"
and competition for art films won't be
that bad because "there's enough
product for everyone."
Rumors have been circulating
lately that the Old Mill might be
bought out and converted to hotel
space. San Vicente claims that such
reports are unsubstantiated, don't
give specific plans, and "as far as I'm
concerned, we're not for sale."
Michaam, responding to the rumor
of the Old Mill's possible sale, said it
won't have much of an effect on the
market because Syufy will "gobble
up" the films the Old Mill would have
shown; with 10 screens, he says, the
Century can accommodate many
numbers of films at one time.
Jude Lutge, owner of the New Var
sity, says the Century hasn't had any
effect on her theater because of the
Varsity's repertory format. The big
gest threat the Varsity faces — a
threat also faced by the Aquarius and
the Bijou — is an uncertain future
provided by local realtor Charles
"Chop" Keenan, who recently
bought the properties of all three
theaters.
Each theater has been leased out to
the current theater owners for the
next few years and Keenan says he
has "not a clue" what he's going to do
with the properties once the current
contracts expire. He adds, however,
that "if I could lease (the properties)
as something that would make
money, I might. Wouldn't you?"
Lutge, who will have operated the
Varsity for 12 years this May, is
raising money to buy the Varsity
property and maintain it as a theater.
She says, "This is my life, it's not just
a piece of property ... I'm sure he
