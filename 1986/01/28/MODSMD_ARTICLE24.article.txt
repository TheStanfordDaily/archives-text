# Lewitzky: stumbling but startling
## Dance troupe explores electrical fields and negative space

So much for universality in art.
As soon as the curtain lifted on the Bella
Lewitsky Dance ensemble, I knew I had to be
watching something from Southern California.
Was this indeed the dance company that, accord
ing to the Lively Arts program, "has drawn raves
for its innovative exploration of space"? It
looked more like a futuristic version of "A
Chorus Line."
Lewitsky's company, established in 1966, is in
ternationally known. Lewitsky herself is a world
famous teacher and choreographer. Her dancers
are renowned for "technically formidable, ex
uberant and sensitive performances."
Unfortunately, the first dance of the evening
was permeated with a sense of space — in a Cali
fornia sense of the word. Called "Eight Dan
cers/Eight Lights," it featured eight dancers in
terfacing more or less successfully with eight
dancer-sized fluorescent tubes. The dancers
(Amy Ernst, Sean Greene, Walter Kennedy,
Nancy Lanier, Lori McWilliams, John Pen
nington, Claudia Schneiderman and Kenneth
Talley) were wearing brightly colored costumes
and moving in a stiff way more than a little remi
niscent of some store mannequins I once met in
Venice Beach.
The backdrop (red, blue and green lighting ar
ranged in a possible imitation of a Will Acker
man album cover), bright costumes and rhythmi
cally flashing poles of light created an environ
ment that was somehow part toy shop and part
factory — childish and cold. The music had a
similar feeling to it, hitting the audience as a
layering of atonal sounds resulting in something
that was not quite a melody — almost like
Bauhaus for ballet.
In such an overwhelming setting, the eight
dancers had to work hard to steal back the show,
and they weren't always successful. As the dance
opened, they took their places beside their
fluorescent-tube partners and turned the lights
on and off with their movements, suggesting the
presence of an electrical field between their
bodies and the poles.
This "field" concept seemed to carry through
many parts of the dance, as dancers explored the
positive and negative spaces created by bodies
moving in tandem. The most interesting parts of
these pieces were tandem performances; when all
dancers moved together they at times resembled
a series of robots (dull ones) or an exceptionally
adept jazzercise class.
After "Eight Dancers/Eight Lights" came two
shorter pieces: a dramatization of a Gabriella
Mistral poem entitled "The Song of the
Woman," and a group piece entitled "Sextet."

Bella Lewitzky's com
pany, established in
1966, is internationally
recognized. Lewitzky
herself is a world
famous teacher and
choreographer. Her
dancers are renowned
for 'technically for
midable, exuberant and
sensitive performances.'

"The Song of the Woman" was the most disap
pointing of all the dances, because the poem,
which was printed on the program, seemed like
rich material for an interpretive dance. A bare

stage and a droning recital of the poem was ad
mittedly a demanding backdrop, and neither
Lewitsky's choreography nor Ernst's dancing
captured my attention. The dance seemed a col
lection of stock phrases: dips, swirls, scoops and
unrequited embraces. Each move was well timed
and gracefully wrought, but the dance as a whole
didn't add to the appreciation of the poem and
wouldn't have been able to stand being removed
from the context of the narration.
After "The Song Of The Woman," I began to
wonder if maybe it was me, and not the Lewitsky
dancers, who was having a bad night. The next
dance, "Sextet," was monotonous in every sense
of the word; flat music, flat colors and — well —
just plain flatness.
The six dancers (Theodora Fredricks, Lanier,
McWilliams, Greene, Kennedy and Pennington)
danced to computer-realized music that proved
there's quite a difference between realization and
revelation. I don't remember it much. Some of
the surrounding crowd seemed much more ap
preciative than I, and I was getting the feeling
that their delighted gasps signified some kind of
informed appreciation — in other words, I wasn't
getting the joke.
Happily, the Lewitsky dancers chose to end
with their best piece. The last dance, "Nos
Duraturi," proved to me that I was, after all, in
the mood to see some good dancing. This was a
compelling and frequently stunning dance, and it
convinced me that the dancers really earned the
praise dished upon them in the Lively Arts pro
gram.
1 haven't the vaguest idea what "Nos
Duraturi" means, but I'm willing to humiliate
myself by suggesting it has something to do with
religion of the Latinate sort. Eleven dancers
(Deborah Collodel, Ernst, Fredrics, Greene,
Kennedy, Kinmura, Lanier, McWilliams, Pen
nington. Schniederman and Kenneth Talley)
wove themselves on and offstage, each getting a
fairly equal amount of floor.
The dance is a compendium of various religi
ous, symbolic and plain bizarre imagery. In con
trast to "Song,"' which seemed like a Sears' Cata
log of woman's interpretive dance movements,
this dance used very little that I'd seen before
(this could be my limitation) and yet very little
that wasn't effective. It was one of those per
formances where you get to wondering why
anyone hadn't thought of that before, and you
realize that art really isn't dead after all — even
in Los Angeles.
"Nos Duraturi" elicited a disproportionately
large share of delighted squeals from my neigh
bors. so I'd venture to say that they liked it best,
too. I joined them in squealing, and in genuine
applause afterwards; for me, the last perfor
mance had absolved the inadequacies of the
three preceding it.

didn't add to the appreciation of the poem and
wouldn't have been able to stand being removed
from the context of the narration.
After "The Song Of The Woman," I began to
wonder if maybe it was me, and not the Lewitsky
dancers, who was having a bad night. The next
dance, "Sextet," was monotonous in every sense
of the word; flat music, flat colors and — well —
just plain flatness.
The six dancers (Theodora Fredricks, Lanier,
McWilliams, Greene, Kennedy and Pennington)
danced to computer-realized music that proved
there's quite a difference between realization and
revelation. I don't remember it much. Some of
the surrounding crowd seemed much more ap
preciative than I, and I was getting the feeling
that their delighted gasps signified some kind of
informed appreciation — in other words, I wasn't
getting the joke.
Happily, the Lewitsky dancers chose to end
with their best piece. The last dance, "Nos
Duraturi," proved to me that I was, after all, in
the mood to see some good dancing. This was a
compelling and frequently stunning dance, and it
convinced me that the dancers really earned the
praise dished upon them in the Lively Arts pro
gram.
1 haven't the vaguest idea what "Nos
Duraturi" means, but I'm willing to humiliate
myself by suggesting it has something to do with
religion of the Latinate sort. Eleven dancers
(Deborah Collodel, Ernst, Fredrics, Greene,
Kennedy, Kinmura, Lanier, McWilliams, Pen
nington. Schniederman and Kenneth Talley)
wove themselves on and offstage, each getting a
fairly equal amount of floor.
The dance is a compendium of various religi
ous, symbolic and plain bizarre imagery. In con
trast to "Song,"' which seemed like a Sears' Cata
log of woman's interpretive dance movements,
this dance used very little that I'd seen before
(this could be my limitation) and yet very little
that wasn't effective. It was one of those per
formances where you get to wondering why
anyone hadn't thought of that before, and you
realize that art really isn't dead after all — even
in Los Angeles.
"Nos Duraturi" elicited a disproportionately
large share of delighted squeals from my neigh
bors. so I'd venture to say that they liked it best,
too. I joined them in squealing, and in genuine
applause afterwards; for me, the last perfor
mance had absolved the inadequacies of the
three preceding it.

So much for universality in art.
As soon as the curtain lifted on the Bella
Lewitsky Dance ensemble, I knew I had to be
watching something from Southern California.
Was this indeed the dance company that, accord
ing to the Lively Arts program, "has drawn raves
for its innovative exploration of space"? It
looked more like a futuristic version of "A
Chorus Line."
Lewitsky's company, established in 1966, is in
ternationally known. Lewitsky herself is a world
famous teacher and choreographer. Her dancers
are renowned for "technically formidable, ex
uberant and sensitive performances."
Unfortunately, the first dance of the evening
was permeated with a sense of space — in a Cali
fornia sense of the word. Called "Eight Dan
cers/Eight Lights," it featured eight dancers in
terfacing more or less successfully with eight
dancer-sized fluorescent tubes. The dancers
(Amy Ernst, Sean Greene, Walter Kennedy,
Nancy Lanier, Lori McWilliams, John Pen
nington, Claudia Schneiderman and Kenneth
Talley) were wearing brightly colored costumes
and moving in a stiff way more than a little remi
niscent of some store mannequins I once met in
Venice Beach.
The backdrop (red, blue and green lighting ar
ranged in a possible imitation of a Will Acker
man album cover), bright costumes and rhythmi
cally flashing poles of light created an environ
ment that was somehow part toy shop and part
factory — childish and cold. The music had a
similar feeling to it, hitting the audience as a
layering of atonal sounds resulting in something
that was not quite a melody — almost like
Bauhaus for ballet.
In such an overwhelming setting, the eight
dancers had to work hard to steal back the show,
and they weren't always successful. As the dance
opened, they took their places beside their
fluorescent-tube partners and turned the lights
on and off with their movements, suggesting the
presence of an electrical field between their
bodies and the poles.
This "field" concept seemed to carry through
many parts of the dance, as dancers explored the
positive and negative spaces created by bodies
moving in tandem. The most interesting parts of
these pieces were tandem performances; when all
dancers moved together they at times resembled
a series of robots (dull ones) or an exceptionally
adept jazzercise class.
After "Eight Dancers/Eight Lights" came two
shorter pieces: a dramatization of a Gabriella
Mistral poem entitled "The Song of the
Woman," and a group piece entitled "Sextet."

Bella Lewitzky's com
pany, established in
1966, is internationally
recognized. Lewitzky
herself is a world
famous teacher and
choreographer. Her
dancers are renowned
for 'technically for
midable, exuberant and
sensitive performances.'

"The Song of the Woman" was the most disap
pointing of all the dances, because the poem,
which was printed on the program, seemed like
rich material for an interpretive dance. A bare

stage and a droning recital of the poem was ad
mittedly a demanding backdrop, and neither
Lewitsky's choreography nor Ernst's dancing
captured my attention. The dance seemed a col
lection of stock phrases: dips, swirls, scoops and
unrequited embraces. Each move was well timed
and gracefully wrought, but the dance as a whole
didn't add to the appreciation of the poem and
wouldn't have been able to stand being removed
from the context of the narration.
