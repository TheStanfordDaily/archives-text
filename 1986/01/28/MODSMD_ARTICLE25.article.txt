# 'Spies' betrayed by inconsistent humor

### LISA MARINO BRANDI WATSON 
Having performed together on the
original "Saturday Night Live," Dan
Aykroyd and Chevy Chase have left
behind an unequalled legacy of
lunacy. We are happy to report that
they have carried this legacy over into
their first collaboration on the big
screen, "Spies Like Us." The
chemistry between the two provides
viewers with a glimpse of a poten
tially successful movie. It was not the
spark between Chase and Aykroyd
that dulled our senses; it was the
drifting plot and weak supporting
cast.
Director John Landis' creation is a
step down from his previous efforts
(among them "National Lampoon's
Animal House," "An American
Werewolf in London," and "Trading
Places"). The caliber of "Spies Like
Us" is nowhere near the high level of
entertainment Landis was able to sus
tain in those earlier outings.
As the U.S. secret agents Millbarge
and Fitz-Hume, Aykroyd and Chase
were humorous guides through the
world of international espionage.
However, the portrayal of both
American and Soviet spies was
clearly unrealistit â€” these bumbling
men were far more incompetent than
one could expect any rational human

being to be. By far the most enter
taining action in "Spies" took place in
a U.S. military training camp, where
Millbarge and Fitz-Hume were
repeatedly subjected to ludicrous ex
ertions.
Donna Dixon played the uncon
vincing U.S. spy, Karen Boyer. After
listening to her whining voice for two
hours, it was apparent that she
captured the role thanks to husband,
co-writer, co-star Aykroyd and not
because of any acting ability she may
have had.
It was downhill from Dixon's per
formance as the plot dragged on to its
anti-climactic conclusion. The writers
made a failing attempt to end the film
on a moral note. The "good guys"
catching "bad guys" finish was insult
ing to the audience's intelligence.
What was supposed to be an interest
ing plot twist was nothing more than
an incoherent finale.
Random appearances by Bob
Hope and punk-rock MTV viewers
defy rational explanation. They did
little but confuse the audience.
Despite its numerous shortcom
ings, "Spies Like Us" is a fun diver
sion that is full of laughs, as long as
you are not searching for an intrigu
ing plot. But if you are looking for
more than mediocre fare, this film is
not something you should look for
ward to seeing.
