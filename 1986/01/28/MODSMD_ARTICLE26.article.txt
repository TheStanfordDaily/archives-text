## Spikers dominate Northridge Cardinal notches second victory of the season in three sets 
### SUSAN SLUSSER 
Last night's convincing 15-7, 16-
14, 15-2 victory over Cal State-
Northridge in Maples Pavilion gave
the Stanford men's volleyball team its
first league win.
The second game was the most ex
citing of the match, as the Cardinal
fought back from a 6-0 deficit. Stan
ford was clearly the better team in the
opening game and dominated the
final game. But in the second game,
Northridge attacked early and ag
gressive net play helped the team
build an 11-5 edge over Stanford at
one point.
From then on, however, Stanford
chipped away at the Northridge lead,
tying the game at 13-13 before lock
ing the match up 16-14. The squad
did not trail again for the rest of the
night, crushing the Northridge team
in the last game and allowing it
only two points.
The key to the second game, ac
cording to Coach Don Shaw, was that
Stanford did not allow itself to
become frustrated.
"It's a real mental game," he said.
"The team that cracks first gives up
points."
It was this patient play that charac
terized the Cardinal performance.
Stanford's ability to get side-outs
stopped Northridge effectively and
kept them from scoring.
"We side-out as best as we
can,"said Shaw. "That's the best
defense."
It was clear that this caused
Northridge to lose its concentra
tion. Northridge senior middle
blocker Scott Juhl admitted "We
were not patient. We have the skills,
but we need to rely on our side-out
game more."
"Stanford was more consistent,"
said senior John Buffington, who led
the Northridge team in kills (10) and
hitting percentage (.444) "We broke
down in our passing game."
Northridge was also handicapped
by the absence of senior outside hitter
Chuck English, sidelined with back
problems.
"It (the loss of English) really hurt
them,"said Shaw. "He's their big gun
â€” they go to him in tough situations.
He's a fine outside hitter."
A few Northridge players felt that
the addition of English wouldn't have
made much difference, however.
"We wouldn't have played better
with or without him," Juhl said.
"It didn't really matter," Buf
fington said. "Jim Meaney (Juhl's
substitute) played well."
It was the Stanford players who
stood out last night, though, espe-
