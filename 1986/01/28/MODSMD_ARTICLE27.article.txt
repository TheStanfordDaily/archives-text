# Club sports roundup

Skiing
Even though members of the Stanford Ski
Team skipped watching the Super Bowl Sun
day, they knew the Bears would be tough â€”
at least on snow.
Reminiscent of the previous weekend, the
Stanford women beat California Saturday to
win the giant slalom at Soda Springs. Fresh
man Shelley St. Laurent and junior Liz At
kinson captured first and second place,
respectively, for the Cardinal in the overall
competition. Co-captain Katherine Strickler
finished 10th to round out the Stanford
scoring.
In the men's portion of the giant slalom,
Stanford finished in third place behind Sierra
College and Berkeley. Sophomore Tim
Nolan placed seventh, followed by Chip
Hazard in 11th place. Lane Hornung
captured 19th place for the Cardinal.
In the slalom, the Cardinal women failed
to fulfill their expectations, finishing in third
place behind Cal and UC-Davis. The consis
tent Atkinson took third place overall, and
teammate Mardi Dier, flying down the hill,
came in seventh.
The Stanford men were more successful
than the women on the slalom course. The
A-Team took second behind Sierra. Nolan,
Hazard, and freshman Brad Swett blazed to
sixth, seventh and 14th-place finishes,
respectively.
Men's Lacrosse
Playing with only a partial squad, the Stan
ford men's lacrosse team fell to highly
touted Whittier Saturday, 22-16, but came
back strong to defeat UCLA the following
morning, 18-12.
Illnesses kept several of the Cardinal from
making the trip to Los Angeles. As a result,
the team had to perform with only three
defensemen throughout the weekend, and
several players had to play out of position.
Hard-hitting Whittier, the defending West
Coast champions, took advantage of the in
experienced Stanford defense and grabbed
an early first-quarter lead. After the slow
start, however, the Cardinal was able to play
up to Whittier's level the rest of the game.
Captain John Patrick led Stanford with
four goals and five assists. Junior Greg
Simon added three goals to the Cardinal
cause.

Against UCLA, the Cardinal opened the
game much sharper and controlled the match
with an improved, more cohesive defense. A
balanced scoring attack was paced by fresh
men Rob Lamkin (four goals) and Don Ken
dall (three goals).
The Cardinal returns to action Saturday at
1 p.m. at the Lacrosse Field against Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo in the league opener.
Ice Hockey
The Stanford ice hockey team came away
with two tough wins and one loss in last
weekend's action.
Friday, the skaters avenged three previous
losses on the season to California, dominat
ing the Bears 9-3 in a very physical contest.
Forward Mike Sabina led a hustling attack in
one of the most important victories of the
year for the Cardinal.
Sabina slapped in two goals and recorded
two assists, while Scott Bommer scored a
goal and picked up an assist for Stanford, and
Danny Ammon got a goal and three assists.
Saturday's action saw the battered Card
inal beat San Jose by a score of 6-2. John
Zierk led Stanford with two goals and a pair
of assists.
The weekend's busy schedule showed its
effects on Sunday, however, as the icemen
fell to Stockton, 6-3. Bob Mulroy anchored
the Cardinal scoring with two goals, and
Sabina added a goal and an assist.
The line of Sabina, Mulroy and Steve
Peterson was impressive in all three of the
games, accounting for a large portion of the
goals scored.
Women's Lacrosse
The Stanford women's lacrosse team has a
new coach, Heidi Faith, and a large turnout
(about fifty girls) for the 1986 season.
The new season got off to a good start Sat
urday as the squad hosted an informal tourn
ament on Roble Field. Playing against teams
from California, UC-Davis and Palo Alto,
the Stanford squads fared well, winning all of
their games.
The Cardinal is looking for increased com
petition on the West Coast, including
Canada, this year. They will face the same
three teams they played this weekend at a
tournament at UC-Davis next Sundav.
