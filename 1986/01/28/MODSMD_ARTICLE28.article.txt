# Chicago Bears are no dynasty—yet
## 
### 
My apologies to New England
Patriots fans for my Super Bowl
prediction last week of a 14-3
Chicago win. I didn't mean to get
anyone's hopes up.
In light of the pitiful perfor
mance by the Patriots on Sunday, I
vastly overrated their ability to
control the Bears offense and keep
things close enough where a
couple of key turnovers might just
have swung things.
The performance of the Chicago
defense was unexpected only in
degree — that New England's best
offensive play would have been a
punt on first down was something
that wasn't surprising. The
Patriots would have been lucky to
score a touchdown under any cir
cumstances.

That the Bears could score 46
points was a shock. Even taking
away the nine points scored by the
Chicago defense and the field goal
that shouldn't have counted, 34
points against the best defense in
the American Football Confer
ence was stunning.
The postgame reaction was typi
cal. Already, Chicago is being
called the next dynasty, and the
defense is being called the best in
history.
Hold on a minute. As Chicago
Coach Mike Ditka pointed out,
the last talk of a dynasty was com
ing from the campus of this very
university exactly one short year
ago. And that San Francisco 49er
dynasty limped into a wild-card
playoff spot and limped home
having been devastated in the
opening round by the New York
Giants.
The Bears were the second-best
team in the NFL last season, and
the 49ers shut them out 23-0 in
the NFC championship game en
route to their triumph here against
Miami in the Super Bowl.
This year, they established
themselves as the front-runner
when they blasted the Niners in
Candlestick Park by a 26-10 count
in the sixth week of the season,
and they kept performing at peak
level for the next four months.
The Bears last year had the two
things needed to be a good foot
ball team — a running game led by

Walter Payton, the game's finest,
and a defense. The return of a
healthy Jim McMahon was all the
Bears needed to become a great
team.
Can the Bears repeat? If key
players like Payton, McMahon
and linebacker Mike Singletary
stay healthy, if the off-season ban
quet circuit doesn't take its toll, if
the intensity of a hungry team that
hadn't won can be maintained,
well, maybe. Otherwise, look at
the 49ers, look at the Los Angeles
Raiders the year before. Dynasties
are lasting only one season in the
NFL nowadays.
What do we want, anyway?
McMahon became a national
celebrity in the two weeks preced
ing the game, with his sunglasses,
headbands, late-night carousing
and comments that he never made
about sluts and stupid men in New
Orleans that were in the headlines
daily.
The image rankled some people
who found his behavior obnoxious
in their kinder moods, the San
Francisco Chronicle's Glenn
Dickey and C.W. Nevius among
them. They are sick of the "Super
Bowl Shuffle," sick of William
"The Refrigerator" Perry and sick
of a bragging team that said it was
the best and then went out and
proved it.
Well, as they say, it ain't brag
ging if it's true. And besides, I
kind of like McMahon. Any guy
who drinks beer on the Brigham
Young University golf course can't
be all bad.
I also wonder what the writers
who covered the Super Bowl were
hoping for. When McMahon is
loud-mouthed and gives them a
story every day, they bitch. When
John Tudor of the St. Louis Car
dinals is quiet and avoids them
during the World Series, they
bitch.
At least the Bears realize they
aren't loved by all of America. In
this respect they have avoided a
myth that the Dallas Cowboys
deluded themselves into believing
for years.
Pete, are you listening?
The two-week break between
the conference championships and
the Super Bowl is one week too
long. I have yet to hear why the
extra week is good, except in over
hyping an already hyped event.

Football is a game played on a
seven-day cycle, and there is no rea
son to change that for the Super
Bowl. If the NFL has any sense, it will
eliminate the extra week.
While we're changing the NFL
schedule, how about moving the
season up a week? Early September
is usually good football weather, un
less you're in Denver. Late Decem
ber is bad football weather in most of
the country. Ergo, play in September
instead of December.
Implementing both these ideas
would move the Super Bowl back
into mid-January, and the Pro Bowl
out of February. Football in February
is almost as ridiculous as football in
the spring, and what idiot would think
of playing football in the spring?
Three bad apples
Three basketball players at Minne
sota have been arrested and charged
with various counts of sexual assault
of an 18-year-old woman after a
game at Wisconsin in Madison on
Thursday.

In the aftermath. Coach Jim
Dutcher resigned, the Gophers for
faited Sunday's game against North
western and are considering forfeiting
the remainder of their games this
season.
But to forfeit the remainder of the
season is unfair. It is unfair to those
students on the team who aren't al
leged rapists. It is unfair to the Gop
hers' Big Ten opponents who will lose
a game or two, not to mention the en
suing revenue. It is unfair to students
for whom the basketball games are
entertainment. And it is unfair to the
people of the Twin Cities and the
state of Minnesota for whom the
Gophers are the only major basket
ball team around.
The actions of three members of a
team off the court should not
jeopardize the entire basketball pro
gram. This is not a point-shaving or
recruiting scandal that directly relates
to basketball; it is a criminal action
involving three men who happen to
be college basketball players. The
Minnesota basketball program should
not suffer for transgressions in their
personal lives, no matter how
reprehensible.

cumstances.

That the Bears could score 46
points was a shock. Even taking
away the nine points scored by the
Chicago defense and the field goal
that shouldn't have counted, 34
points against the best defense in
the American Football Confer
ence was stunning.
The postgame reaction was typi
cal. Already, Chicago is being
called the next dynasty, and the
defense is being called the best in
history.
Hold on a minute. As Chicago
Coach Mike Ditka pointed out,
the last talk of a dynasty was com
ing from the campus of this very
university exactly one short year
ago. And that San Francisco 49er
dynasty limped into a wild-card
playoff spot and limped home
having been devastated in the
opening round by the New York
Giants.
The Bears were the second-best
team in the NFL last season, and
the 49ers shut them out 23-0 in
the NFC championship game en
route to their triumph here against
Miami in the Super Bowl.
This year, they established
themselves as the front-runner
when they blasted the Niners in
Candlestick Park by a 26-10 count
in the sixth week of the season,
and they kept performing at peak
level for the next four months.
The Bears last year had the two
things needed to be a good foot
ball team — a running game led by

Walter Payton, the game's finest,
and a defense. The return of a
healthy Jim McMahon was all the
Bears needed to become a great
team.
Can the Bears repeat? If key
players like Payton, McMahon
and linebacker Mike Singletary
stay healthy, if the off-season ban
quet circuit doesn't take its toll, if
the intensity of a hungry team that
hadn't won can be maintained,
well, maybe. Otherwise, look at
the 49ers, look at the Los Angeles
Raiders the year before. Dynasties
are lasting only one season in the
NFL nowadays.
What do we want, anyway?
McMahon became a national
celebrity in the two weeks preced
ing the game, with his sunglasses,
headbands, late-night carousing
and comments that he never made
about sluts and stupid men in New
Orleans that were in the headlines
daily.
The image rankled some people
who found his behavior obnoxious
in their kinder moods, the San
Francisco Chronicle's Glenn
Dickey and C.W. Nevius among
them. They are sick of the "Super
Bowl Shuffle," sick of William
"The Refrigerator" Perry and sick
of a bragging team that said it was
the best and then went out and
proved it.
Well, as they say, it ain't brag
ging if it's true. And besides, I
kind of like McMahon. Any guy
who drinks beer on the Brigham
Young University golf course can't
be all bad.
I also wonder what the writers
who covered the Super Bowl were
hoping for. When McMahon is
loud-mouthed and gives them a
story every day, they bitch. When
John Tudor of the St. Louis Car
dinals is quiet and avoids them
during the World Series, they
bitch.
At least the Bears realize they
aren't loved by all of America. In
this respect they have avoided a
myth that the Dallas Cowboys
deluded themselves into believing
for years.
Pete, are you listening?
The two-week break between
the conference championships and
the Super Bowl is one week too
long. I have yet to hear why the
extra week is good, except in over
hyping an already hyped event.

Football is a game played on a
seven-day cycle, and there is no rea
son to change that for the Super
Bowl. If the NFL has any sense, it will
eliminate the extra week.
While we're changing the NFL
schedule, how about moving the
season up a week? Early September
is usually good football weather, un
less you're in Denver. Late Decem
ber is bad football weather in most of
the country. Ergo, play in September
instead of December.
Implementing both these ideas
would move the Super Bowl back
into mid-January, and the Pro Bowl
out of February. Football in February
is almost as ridiculous as football in
the spring, and what idiot would think
of playing football in the spring?
Three bad apples
Three basketball players at Minne
sota have been arrested and charged
with various counts of sexual assault
of an 18-year-old woman after a
game at Wisconsin in Madison on
Thursday.

In the aftermath. Coach Jim
Dutcher resigned, the Gophers for
faited Sunday's game against North
western and are considering forfeiting
the remainder of their games this
season.
But to forfeit the remainder of the
season is unfair. It is unfair to those
students on the team who aren't al
leged rapists. It is unfair to the Gop
hers' Big Ten opponents who will lose
a game or two, not to mention the en
suing revenue. It is unfair to students
for whom the basketball games are
entertainment. And it is unfair to the
people of the Twin Cities and the
state of Minnesota for whom the
Gophers are the only major basket
ball team around.
The actions of three members of a
team off the court should not
jeopardize the entire basketball pro
gram. This is not a point-shaving or
recruiting scandal that directly relates
to basketball; it is a criminal action
involving three men who happen to
be college basketball players. The
Minnesota basketball program should
not suffer for transgressions in their
personal lives, no matter how
reprehensible.
My apologies to New England
Patriots fans for my Super Bowl
prediction last week of a 14-3
Chicago win. I didn't mean to get
anyone's hopes up.
In light of the pitiful perfor
mance by the Patriots on Sunday, I
vastly overrated their ability to
control the Bears offense and keep
things close enough where a
couple of key turnovers might just
have swung things.
The performance of the Chicago
defense was unexpected only in
degree — that New England's best
offensive play would have been a
punt on first down was something
that wasn't surprising. The
Patriots would have been lucky to
score a touchdown under any cir
cumstances.

That the Bears could score 46
points was a shock. Even taking
away the nine points scored by the
Chicago defense and the field goal
