# Fencers win in San Francisco
## 
### LISA MARTINEZ Staff writer 
This Saturday in a tournament at the Uni
versity of San Francisco, the Stanford fen
cing teams crushed their competition, as
both the men and the women compiled 3-0
records in the event.
The Stanford men quickly dispatched
USF 23-4 in the teams' second matchup of
the season. "The team fenced very well
against San Francisco," Coach Buzz Hurst
said. "We won foil 8-1, epee came in at 6-3
and sabre was victorious at 9-0."
The Cardinal men then overcame their
toughest challenge of the tournament,
defeating Air Force 14-13. "This is the
fourth year we've fenced Air Force and the
third year we've beaten them," Hurst said.
"There's no question that Stanford and Air
Force are extremely evenly matched teams.
"This is the closest match we've had
against Air Force yet. The men started con
siderably behind, with foil losing 5-4 and
epee 7-2. But sabre took over and won eight
bouts in a row. They really came through for
us."
According to Hurst, Mike Cramer, Stan
ford s No. 3 sabre, "did the most heroic job
of the tournament." Suffering a relapse of
mononucleosis, Cramer was unable to
practice on Thursday or Friday.
"We kept him out of the USF match but
we had to put him in for Air Force," Hurst
said. "Under extremely difficult conditions,
he achieved a 5-0 record for the tourna
ment. He did an outstanding job."
Next up, the Stanford men challenged
Fullerton State, the Southern Conference
champs, overcoming them with a 17-10 win.
"Fullerton really gave us a scare," Hurst
said. "Epee was down 4-0 but sabre brought
us back. Fullerton is the second strongest
team in the region. We'll have to watch out
for them at the Western Regionals."
According to Hurst, "the epee team had
kind of a rocky go all day. They obviously
had a downer in their loss to Air Force, but
they really did a very credible job in bring
ing it back. Ihe epee team is extremely
young in experience, but they are steadily
improving. They will be much stronger by
the time we get to the regionals."
" The foil team is coming back strong and
improving with each meet," Hurst contin
ued. "They've defeated every school,
usually with wide margins. They're one of
the keys for us."

The Cardinal women began the tourna
ment with a bang, trouncing San Francisco
State 14-2. They continued their winning
ways throughout the tournament, overcom
ing Air Force 13-3 and Fullerton 10-6.
"The women dominated from the start,"
Hurst said. Stanford captain Jennifer Yu
remained undefeated at 12-0.
"We have also had consistently outstand
ing performances from Holly Taylor and
Alison Reid. They're the ones coming
through for us this season," he said. "Once
again, the women gave us another decisive
victory, putting aside all possible doubts
about who is the best team in the (NCAA)
Western Region."

Overall, Hurst was fairly pleased with the
tournament. "It was a little hair-raising
against Air Force, but we came out all right,"
he said. "As a coach, I could use a few less
thrills."
With the wins the men advanced to 11-1
overall on the season, and the women
padded a perfect 11-0 record.
Next weekend, both Stanford squads will
fence Texas-San Antonio at Roble Gym.
"We have passed the real hard core of the
regular season and we don't anticipate any
real trouble from Texas," Hurst said. "We
can lighten up a little now and start looking
toward the Western Regionals, where it will
be anyone's ballgame."

With the wins the men advanced to 11-1
overall on the season, and the women
padded a perfect 11-0 record.
Next weekend, both Stanford squads will
fence Texas-San Antonio at Roble Gym.
"We have passed the real hard core of the
regular season and we don't anticipate any
real trouble from Texas," Hurst said. "We
can lighten up a little now and start looking
toward the Western Regionals, where it will
be anyone's ballgame."
