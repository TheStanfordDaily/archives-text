# Minorities rip constitution

### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
Nine members of campus minority-interest groups met
last night to denounce the proposed ASSU constitution to
be voted on today, saying it threatens the representation
of minority groups in the ASSU Senate and Council of
Presidents (COP).
In an informal meeting at El Centro Chicano, the stu
dents blasted the appeals process as outlined in the pro
posed constitution and the senate's failure to consult
minority groups during the writing of the document.
Members of Amnesty International, the Coalition
Against Apartheid, Stanford Central American Action
Network, Stanford Arms Control and Disarmament
Forum, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford, the
Stanford American Indian Organization and El Centro
joined to draft an informal statement in support of the
Black Student Union's (BSU) stance against the proposed
constitution.
Although no BSU representative attended last night's
meeting, the discussion opened with a summary of the
BSU's official statement opposing the proposed constitu
tion on the grounds that it "reduces student representa
tion in general and Third World student participation in
particular."
The students asserted that a reduction in the number of
COP members from four to three reduces the probability
that a minority group will be represented in the council.
Under the provisions of the new constitution, the senate
would consist of 18 members and be be divided into a
policy and funding board, each consisting of four senators
and one chairman.
The students at the meeting agreed that even with the
current system of 20 elected senators, minority represen
tation in the student government is minimal. According to
Eric Diesel, a graduate student in statistics, it is "easier to
get one of 20 than one of four" senators elected who will
represent one or more minority groups.
The proposed appeals process, which eliminates two
steps in the current process by abolishing the Senate Ap
propriations Committee, would make it more difficult for
minority organizations to appeal senate decisions advo
cating less money than requested for group activities, ac
cording to the students.
Diesel noted that a minority group's request for funding
could be halted by one decision against the request in the
funding board, with no chance for appeal. Also, two mem
bers of the COP could veto the funding board's decision in
favor of minority group's funding, he said.
"Essentially, two people could stop all funding," said
one student who asked not to be named.
The students at the El Centro meeting supported the
BSU's statement that "one board makes a decision and
there are no avenues for appeal."
COP member Michael Collins, one of the authors of the
proposed constitution, said he thinks the proposed consti
tution would not reduce representation despite the reduc
tion in the total number of elected representitives.
"In no sense does it mandate that minority participation
will be lower. Hopefully, it will be greater," Collins said.
He added that criticism that power is in the hands of too
few results from a misunderstanding of the new constitu
tion.
"It's dirt simple to anyone who has read the document.
The various ways that any given student or group can ap
proach the student government are nicely defined. The
last thing that the COP would want to do is to take power
away from student groups," Collins said.
Besides the issue of possible loss of a minority voice in
the new student government, the students expressed con
cern over possible effects the proposed constitution could
have on graduate student representation. The current

voting system provides for one representative from each
graduate school, while the proposed constitution calls for
all graduates to vote for at-large candidates for senate
from all schools.
"Since students from the smaller graduate departments
are less well-known," they'll necessarily have a greater
problem getting elected than students from the larger de
partments," Diesel said.
He added that a lack of equal representation could
create conflicts between "fuzzies and techies, since the
fuzzies generally belong to smaller departments."
The students said they believed the authors of the pro
posed new constitution were well-intentioned. But ac
cording to sophomore Gina Hernandez, the authors
"should have consulted other groups to discuss the
proposals for the new government."
Instead, the constitution was authored primarily by four
whites, only one of whom is female, she said.
Collins said he cannot understand criticism that the
constitution was authored by whites. "Everyone on this
campus is — and should believe that they are — truly
equal. I believe it,"he said.
In an interview after the meeting, BSU Chair Steve
Phillips agreed that the proposed constitution "has the
potential to limit representation of all the minority groups
on campus, and particularly students of color."
Phillips added that while he believes the authors of the
proposed constitution did not take a "a malevolent ap
proach" toward campus minority groups, members of the
senate and COP have succeeded in "overlooking our
communities."
"More time and care should have been taken" in the
writing of the proposed constitution, with its authors
making more of an effort to discuss their work with repre
sentatives of campus minority groups, Phillips said.
Collins said, "By no means was it written in a vacuum.
People would stop me in the street and tell me what ought
to be in there."

"In no sense does it mandate that minority participation
will be lower. Hopefully, it will be greater," Collins said.
He added that criticism that power is in the hands of too
few results from a misunderstanding of the new constitu
tion.
"It's dirt simple to anyone who has read the document.
The various ways that any given student or group can ap
proach the student government are nicely defined. The
last thing that the COP would want to do is to take power
away from student groups," Collins said.
Besides the issue of possible loss of a minority voice in
the new student government, the students expressed con
cern over possible effects the proposed constitution could
have on graduate student representation. The current

voting system provides for one representative from each
graduate school, while the proposed constitution calls for
all graduates to vote for at-large candidates for senate
from all schools.
"Since students from the smaller graduate departments
are less well-known," they'll necessarily have a greater
problem getting elected than students from the larger de
partments," Diesel said.
He added that a lack of equal representation could
create conflicts between "fuzzies and techies, since the
fuzzies generally belong to smaller departments."
The students said they believed the authors of the pro
posed new constitution were well-intentioned. But ac
cording to sophomore Gina Hernandez, the authors
"should have consulted other groups to discuss the
proposals for the new government."
Instead, the constitution was authored primarily by four
whites, only one of whom is female, she said.
Collins said he cannot understand criticism that the
constitution was authored by whites. "Everyone on this
campus is — and should believe that they are — truly
equal. I believe it,"he said.
In an interview after the meeting, BSU Chair Steve
Phillips agreed that the proposed constitution "has the
potential to limit representation of all the minority groups
on campus, and particularly students of color."
Phillips added that while he believes the authors of the
proposed constitution did not take a "a malevolent ap
proach" toward campus minority groups, members of the
senate and COP have succeeded in "overlooking our
communities."
"More time and care should have been taken" in the
writing of the proposed constitution, with its authors
making more of an effort to discuss their work with repre
sentatives of campus minority groups, Phillips said.
Collins said, "By no means was it written in a vacuum.
People would stop me in the street and tell me what ought
to be in there."
Nine members of campus minority-interest groups met
last night to denounce the proposed ASSU constitution to
be voted on today, saying it threatens the representation
of minority groups in the ASSU Senate and Council of
Presidents (COP).
In an informal meeting at El Centro Chicano, the stu
dents blasted the appeals process as outlined in the pro
posed constitution and the senate's failure to consult
minority groups during the writing of the document.
Members of Amnesty International, the Coalition
Against Apartheid, Stanford Central American Action
Network, Stanford Arms Control and Disarmament
Forum, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford, the
Stanford American Indian Organization and El Centro
joined to draft an informal statement in support of the
Black Student Union's (BSU) stance against the proposed
constitution.
Although no BSU representative attended last night's
meeting, the discussion opened with a summary of the
BSU's official statement opposing the proposed constitu
tion on the grounds that it "reduces student representa
tion in general and Third World student participation in
particular."
The students asserted that a reduction in the number of
COP members from four to three reduces the probability
that a minority group will be represented in the council.
Under the provisions of the new constitution, the senate
would consist of 18 members and be be divided into a
policy and funding board, each consisting of four senators
and one chairman.
The students at the meeting agreed that even with the
current system of 20 elected senators, minority represen
tation in the student government is minimal. According to
Eric Diesel, a graduate student in statistics, it is "easier to
get one of 20 than one of four" senators elected who will
represent one or more minority groups.
The proposed appeals process, which eliminates two
steps in the current process by abolishing the Senate Ap
propriations Committee, would make it more difficult for
minority organizations to appeal senate decisions advo
cating less money than requested for group activities, ac
cording to the students.
Diesel noted that a minority group's request for funding
could be halted by one decision against the request in the
funding board, with no chance for appeal. Also, two mem
bers of the COP could veto the funding board's decision in
favor of minority group's funding, he said.
"Essentially, two people could stop all funding," said
one student who asked not to be named.
The students at the El Centro meeting supported the
BSU's statement that "one board makes a decision and
there are no avenues for appeal."
COP member Michael Collins, one of the authors of the
proposed constitution, said he thinks the proposed consti
tution would not reduce representation despite the reduc
tion in the total number of elected representitives.
"In no sense does it mandate that minority participation
will be lower. Hopefully, it will be greater," Collins said.
