# Bears return to jubilant Chicago

### 
CHICAGO (AP) — The trium
phant Chicago Bears returned home
yesterday to a ticker-tape parade
through the downtown financial dis
trict, where they were greeted by tens
of thousands of cheering fans who
clogged the streets, waved from win
dows and poured tons of shredded
paper on their heroes.
After a six-block parade, Bears
President Michael McCaskey carried
the gleaming silver Super Bowl
trophy through the crowd and onto a
podium at Daley Plaza.
"Today in this country, everybody
is a Chicago Bear fan," said McCas
key, who then drew thunderous
cheers when he broke into dog barks
of the type popularized by Bears
players prowling the sidelines.
The Bears, who arrived about an
hour later than expected from New
Orleans, were ferried down LaSalle
Street on buses, as children climbed
trees to catch a glimpse and paper
fluttered like swirling snow in the
arctic temperatures.
"Having a ticker-tape parade in
Chicago is so wonderful, I just
wanted to be part of it," said Dorothy
Bloom, 33, of Chicago.
"We're part of it; that's the big
thing," said Paul Holmen, a
ca r penter.
The parade was led by Bears Coach
Mike Ditka, who rode in a car with an
open sun-roof. Ditka stood in the
opening, raising his hands trium
phantly.
Originally, plans had called for the
Bears to be taken through the city in
convertibles, but buses later were
substituted. Several team members
climbed atop the buses and waved as
the parade passed slowly along the
six-block route.
The temperature downtown was 8
degrees, with a wind-chill factor of 29
degrees below.
The paper already was knee-deep
in spots before the arrival of the
buses, enabling fans to stage mock

snowball fights with armloads of it.
As the buses approached Daley
Plaza, someone on top of one bus
began clearing the paper off with a
snowshovel.
Linebacker Brian Cabral was the
first player to climb through a hatch
onto the roof of one bus and begin
waving to the fans. More players soon
joined him, waving, passing around
beer and tossing handfuls of confetti
at each other.
Fans also tried to climb onto the
bus roofs, some falling back onto the
crowded street.
After running to the podium.
Mayor Harold Washington proudly
displayed a street sign that will be
used to rename part of Lake Shore
Drive in honor of the late Bears'
founder, George S. Halas.
Walter Payton was the only one of
the Bears' nine Pro Bowl players
turning out for the homecoming
celebration. Not attending because of
the Feb. 2 game at Honolulu were
Jimbo Covert, Jay Hilgenberg, Rich
ard Dent and Mike Singletary, all Pro
Bowl starters, and Dave Duerson,
Otis Wilson, Dan Hampton and Jim
McMahon, all reserves for the all-star
game.
Students at two private schools —
Gordon Technical High School in
Chicago and at Immaculate Concep
tion High School in Elmhurst — were
given the day off.
But classes were held at the city's
public schools — including Lane Tech
and Crane Tech high schools, provid
ing band music for the parade and
rally.
Robert Kelley, director of the
Bureau of Management Information
for Chicago's public schools, ac
knowledged that some students
would opt for the parade instead of
afternoon classes.
"I think if I were a kid, I'd do it,"
he said.
Celebration of Chicago's long
awaited championship began when
the game ended Sunday night. About
10,000 fans hit the streets of a
popular North Side bar district, clog
ging traffic, tossing firecrackers and
singing the Bears' praises until
daylight.
About 75 people were arrested,
most on disorderly conduct charges,
said patrolman John McAllister. An
gelo Capua, 54, of Berwyn, an em
ployee of WMAQ-TV, was hit by a
car and suffered a broken leg, author
ities said. He was in fair condition
Monday at Northwestern Memorial
Hospital.
Although Chicago baseball teams
have come close, the city had not had
a national champion in a major sport
since 1963, when the Bears defeated
the New York Giants in the National
Football League championship game,
before the Super Bowl was in
augurated.

Mike Ditka, who rode in a car with an
open sun-roof. Ditka stood in the
opening, raising his hands trium
phantly.
Originally, plans had called for the
Bears to be taken through the city in
convertibles, but buses later were
substituted. Several team members
climbed atop the buses and waved as
the parade passed slowly along the
six-block route.
The temperature downtown was 8
degrees, with a wind-chill factor of 29
degrees below.
The paper already was knee-deep
in spots before the arrival of the
buses, enabling fans to stage mock

snowball fights with armloads of it.
As the buses approached Daley
Plaza, someone on top of one bus
began clearing the paper off with a
snowshovel.
Linebacker Brian Cabral was the
first player to climb through a hatch
onto the roof of one bus and begin
waving to the fans. More players soon
joined him, waving, passing around
beer and tossing handfuls of confetti
at each other.
Fans also tried to climb onto the
bus roofs, some falling back onto the
crowded street.
After running to the podium.
Mayor Harold Washington proudly
displayed a street sign that will be
used to rename part of Lake Shore
Drive in honor of the late Bears'
founder, George S. Halas.
Walter Payton was the only one of
the Bears' nine Pro Bowl players
turning out for the homecoming
celebration. Not attending because of
the Feb. 2 game at Honolulu were
Jimbo Covert, Jay Hilgenberg, Rich
ard Dent and Mike Singletary, all Pro
Bowl starters, and Dave Duerson,
Otis Wilson, Dan Hampton and Jim
McMahon, all reserves for the all-star
game.
Students at two private schools —
Gordon Technical High School in
Chicago and at Immaculate Concep
tion High School in Elmhurst — were
given the day off.
But classes were held at the city's
public schools — including Lane Tech
and Crane Tech high schools, provid
ing band music for the parade and
rally.
Robert Kelley, director of the
Bureau of Management Information
for Chicago's public schools, ac
knowledged that some students
would opt for the parade instead of
afternoon classes.
"I think if I were a kid, I'd do it,"
he said.
Celebration of Chicago's long
awaited championship began when
the game ended Sunday night. About
10,000 fans hit the streets of a
popular North Side bar district, clog
ging traffic, tossing firecrackers and
singing the Bears' praises until
daylight.
About 75 people were arrested,
most on disorderly conduct charges,
said patrolman John McAllister. An
gelo Capua, 54, of Berwyn, an em
ployee of WMAQ-TV, was hit by a
car and suffered a broken leg, author
ities said. He was in fair condition
Monday at Northwestern Memorial
Hospital.
Although Chicago baseball teams
have come close, the city had not had
a national champion in a major sport
since 1963, when the Bears defeated
the New York Giants in the National
Football League championship game,
before the Super Bowl was in
augurated.
