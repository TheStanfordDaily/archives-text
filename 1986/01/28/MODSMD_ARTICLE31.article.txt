## Second-ranked Florida leads the pack 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
"1 wouldn't be satisfied unless we
finished in the top three," Stanford
Golf Coach Tim Baldwin said before
the Oklahoma State Intercollegiate
women's golf tournament.
With one round left to play in the
54-hole tournament in Guadalajara,
Mexico, Stanford has its work cut out
for it to live up to Baldwin's hopes.
The Cardinal has staggered to a two
round score of 629, leaving it in a tie
with Texas Christian University for
11th place out of 15 teams.
The local contingent from the Uni
versity of Mexico trails the pair in a
tie for 13th place.
Florida, ranked No. 2 nationally,
leads the pack with a team score of
593. Eighth-ranked Southern Meth
odist University is eight strokes off
the pace at 601, with top-ranked
Tulsa right behind at 602.
Georgia (605) and Lamar (608)
round out the top five.
Leading Florida is the one-two
punch of Lisa Stanley and Karen
Davies, who are tied with Lamar's
Leslie Price for the individual lead at
146. Another threesome, Tulsa's

Melissa McNamara, Texas' Sue
Ginter and SMU's Tammy Hen
ningsen is nipping at their heels at
147.
Georgia's Stefanie Lowe rests
alone in seventh place with a score of
148, and SMU's Martha Foyer fol
lows her in eighth place at 149.
Stanford was ranked third nation
ally and first in the Far West region of
the NCAA going into the tourna
ment, but has not received strong
performances from any member of
the squad.
"We are consistently playing
poorly," Baldwin said.
Kathleen McCarthy led the Card
inal with a two-round total of 155,
recording a team-low round of 76 on
Sunday, followed by Clare Dolan and
Kathy Kostas with scores of 158.
Trish McGonigle shot 160 and Kay
Cornelius, ranked eighth in the na
tion individually, recorded a total of
162.
In its four previous tournaments
Stanford did not finish lower than
fourth, including a first-place finish in
its own tournament last November.
The Cardinal may be discovering,
however, that there really is no place
like home.
