# Berry discloses Pat drug problem
## New England players vote to submit to urinalysis testing 
### 
BOSTON (AP) — At least five New England
Patriots have a serious drug problem and five to
seven more are suspected to have a problem.
Coach Raymond Berry told The Boston Globe in a
copyright interview in today's editions.
"I would say we may be 28th in the league as far
as this problem goes, but there are at least five
players we know who have a serious problem and
five to seven more whom we suspect very
strongly," Berry said.
The identifications of the players, who Berry said
include at least four starters, were not released.
"We have a situation that exists here that we feel
is intolerable. It has been going on for a year, and I
had to weigh the damages of doing something
about it immediately by going public," Berry said.
"We felt with the season going the way it had, we
had to keep our eye on the bull's-eye. That's why
we didn't do anything before. But our bull's-eye
looking is over," Berry said Monday, a day after
the Patriots' 46-10 Super Bowl loss to the Chicago
Bears.

"It's time to do something about this problem,
and it cannot be done in secret," Berry said.
After being addressed Monday in New Orleans
by Berry about the extent of the problem — specif
ically, the use of cocaine, the Globe said — and the
possible consequences, the team members huddled
for nearly two hours in their hotel with player rep
resentative Brian Holloway and his assistant, Ron
Wooten.
At the meeting, members of the American Foot
ball Conference champions voted to become the
first NFL team to accept voluntary drug testing, the
Globe and other sources said. Of 59 players on the
roster, seven voted against the plan. Several
abstained, the newspaper said.
When the team returned at 11 p.m. yesterday to
Logan International Airport, Berry was asked if
any players were going to be suspended as a result
of the problem.
"Not necessarily," he said. "All of us understand
what the world is about today. It's just something
we have to deal with."

Among the seven in opposition to the plan were
Holloway and Wooten, both of whom opposed the
testing on collective bargaining grounds.
The National Football League Players Associa
tion, the players' union, has long opposed spot
testing or any type of urinalysis examination for
drug use except in cases where the team physician
perceives an individual problem or a player has
previously tested positive.
Eight NFL teams requested that their players
take post-season drug tests this year, and all
refused until the Patriots announced their compli
ance with Berry's request.
"Many of the players involved are ones with im
portant roles on this team. We can't afford to lose
them. We don't want to see players traded because
of a drug problem," Wooten said.
"What we decided to adopt was a voluntary
drug-testing program that will be regular and fre
quent enough to prevent anyone from slipping
through undetected," he added.
