# Golfers in fifth spot entering second day
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
The Stanford men's golf team will be shooting for the bronze when it begins
play today in the final round of the 54-hole UC-Santa Barbara Tournament in
Santa Barbara.
Playing yesterday in "shotgun" fashion, as Stanford Golf Coach Tim Schaaf
termed the rigors of playing 36 holes in one day, the 16th-ranked Cardinal is in
fifth place with a score of 760. Stanford is well behind team leaders USC (the
top-ranked team in the country) and Fresno State, which shot 731 and 732,
respectively.
However, the team finds itself in the midst of a dogfight for third place, as
eight teams are within 1 1 strokes of each other. Cal State-Dominguez Hills is
in third place at 753, and Oregon State is in fourth at 755.
Rounding out the top 10 after Stanford are Long Beach State, Cal State-
Northridge, New Mexico State, UCSB and UC-Irvine.
"I'd say our scoring today was a team effort — nobody really played well,"
Schaaf said. "Not one of our players came near his potential. It was just one of
those days when everybody, with the exception of Carl Wagner, played
poorly."
Wagner began the day as perfect as the weather on the par-72 Sandpiper
poll Course, coming in at three-under-par on the first nine holes. He finished
the morning round with a score of 71, and then shot a three-over-par 75 in the
afternoon to end the day in a tie for seventh place at 146.
Don Walsworth shot 1 50 for the two rounds, and freshman Roger Miraglia,
starting in his first intercollegiate tournament, shot 154.
According to Schaaf, the scores of Rich Marik, Brad Geer and Casey Pittock
(also making his first start), also fell below their expectations.
"Realistically, we can't catch USC or Fresno State, but our goal is third
place, Schaaf said. "We feel we're one of the top three teams in the tourna
ment."
He added, "Its going to take a little better golf. We didn't even scratch the
surface of how we should play."
