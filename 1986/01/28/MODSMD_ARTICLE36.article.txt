Crisis imminent, Sikhs seize temple
NEW DELHI — India's troubled Punjab State appeared headed for
another crisis yesterday after armed Sikh militants seized control of the
Golden Temple complex in Amritsar and the government of Prime Min
ister Rajiv Gandhi failed to meet a deadline in its agreement with Sikh
political leaders.
For the first time since the bloody June 1984 Indian Army raid on the
Golden Temple, Sikhism's holiest shrine, militants seeking an indepen
dent Sikh homeland in the Punjab gained control of the temple.
About eight million Sikhs live in Punjab, India's most prosperous
agricultural state. So do at least six million Hindus who find themselves
increasingly alienated from the Sikh community.
For several months after a July 1985 peace accord between Gandhi
and leaders of the mainstream Sikh political party, the Akali Dal, Pun
jab remained relatively quiet. However, in recent weeks tensions have
been building again, particularly last week after a New Delhi judge sen
tenced three Sikhs to death by hanging for their role in the October 1984
assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Rajiv Gandhi's mother.
Visitors yesterday to the nearly 400-year-old temple — which is
named for an ornate gold-plated building at its center, surrounded by a
reflecting pond — said that several hundred Sikh youths were in the
grounds, most of them armed with swords and shotguns. Saffron pen
nants, a symbol of the separatist Sikh state of Khalistan, flew from the
fortified walls.
The actions by the militants have drawn angry response from Sikh po
litical leaders and moderates. At a meeting yesterday in Chandigarh, the
state capital that Punjab shares with the neighboring state of Haryana,
leaders of the Akali Dal party condemned the seizure of the temple
complex as "part of a big conspiracy to destroy the Sikh faith."
Most of the militants appeared to be followers of the Sikh fundamen
talist leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. Bhindranwale, a charismatic
leader with long flowing hair tied in a royal blue turban, was killed in the
1984 army raid, in which the government says 491 other Sikhs died.
Honduran president asks for aid
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras — Jose Azcona took office as president
of Honduras yesterday in a ceremony that marked the first time in 53
years that one elected civilian succeeded another as chief executive.
In his inaugural address, Azcona called for measures to ease the na
tion's foreign-debt burden and to promote exports. He offered few clues
about his position on foreign policy, although he said that Honduras
would maintain its "unchanging friendship" with the United States.
Azcona, 59, whose silver hair and erect bearing give him a states
manlike appearance, has a reputation for personal honesty. Departing
President Roberto Suazo Cordova was known for political wheeling and
dealing.
"I am not going to tolerate immorality in my government, nor lazi
ness," Azcona said. That line received loud applause from the crowd at
the windswept National Stadium.
Vice President George Bush headed the delegation from Washington
that attended the ceremony. Bush also attended the inauguration of
Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo on Jan. 14.
U.S. officials lauded this inauguration, like Cerezo's, as evidence that
democracy was taking root in a region where the armed forces histori
cally have dominated politics. In both Honduras and Guatemala,
however, the military remains a powerful limit to presidential power.
Haiti claims secret police abolished
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Haiti's president-for-life, Jean-Claude
Duvalier, announced the formal abolition of his government's secret
police during the weekend in a new effort to satisfy critics here and in
Washington.
But new anti-government demonstrations erupted in several towns,
including the country's second city. Cap Haitien, where heavily armed
troops fired tear gas at several thousand stone-throwing protesters.
The city's prefect was attacked as demonstrators surged through the
narrow streets, spray-painting slogans on walls and calling for the presi
dent to resign and for the army to help them overthrow the government.
Most of the city's shops shut after threats to burn them.
The protests coincided with the arrival at nearby Labadie of 1,200
cruise passengers for the delayed inauguration of a much criticized
tourist project there. A Cayman Islands-registered firm linked to the
American-Norwegian Royal Caribbean cruise line has been granted a
20-year concession at minimal rates. A newspaper here described the
contract as "scandalous" and demanded its cancellation "in the national
interest."
The project, replacing an earlier proposal by a French-Haitian consor
tium that would have provided 400 permanent jobs and extensive
benefits for the local economy, was signed under the recently disgraced
and sacked finance minister, Frantz Merceron.
The announced abolition of the secret police, which many Haitians
greeted with skepticism, was part of an extensive military reshuffle in
volving the retirement of 12 senior officers, including rft commanders of
the country's main military unit, the Casernes Dessalines battalion, of
the Leopards antisubversion force, and of the small air force and navy.
Chairmen oppose covert Angolan aid
Chairmen oppose Angolan aid
WASHINGTON — The chairmen of the Senate and House intelli
gence committees have decided to oppose covert military assistance to
noncommunist forces fighting in Angola and are urging the Reagan Ad
ministration instead to seek to convince Congress of the need for an
open assistance program.
The bipartisan advice from Sen. David Durenberger (R-Minn.) chair
man of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and his counterpart
in the House, Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.) came as the Administration
indicated yesterday that it still prefers a new covert-aid program to the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) headed
by Jonas Savimbi, who arrives in Washington today for an intensive two
week lobbying campaign for U.S. support.
Durenberger said in an interview yesterday that he felt "fairly
strongly" that any U.S. aid to UNITA "ought to be overt" and approved
by Congress. He said he is pressing the Administration "to go that
route."
That sentiment was echoed by Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), ranking
minority member of the Senate intelligence committee, who said, "If
we're going to get involved in these kinds of activities, then we ought to
do it overtly, not covertly."
Arms dealers desire sales in China
PEKING — Arms merchants representing some of the world's
leading defense companies have descended on Peking for the first large
scale international defense exhibition to be held here.
U.S. companies have the heaviest representation of foreign firms dis
playing weapons at the exhibition, which opens today and runs until Feb.
2. But they face sharp competition in some areas from French and West
German firms. More than 160 companies from 1 7 countries and regions
are participating. Products on display include aviation equipment,
missiles and defense electronics.
The debate over how far the Chinese will go in purchasing western
defense equipment goes back more than a decade. The Chinese are
noted for doing much window shopping but little buying. But because of
a few sales and the knowledge that the Chinese armed forces need new
equipment, the merchants keep coming.
The most recent significant development in this controversial and
sometimes lucrative field is a Reagan Administration decision to seek
congressional approval for the sale of radar and navigational equipment
to help modernize the Chinese Air Force's F-8 jet fighter plane.

cruise passengers for the delayed inauguration of a much criticized
tourist project there. A Cayman Islands-registered firm linked to the
American-Norwegian Royal Caribbean cruise line has been granted a
20-year concession at minimal rates. A newspaper here described the
contract as "scandalous" and demanded its cancellation "in the national
interest."
The project, replacing an earlier proposal by a French-Haitian consor
tium that would have provided 400 permanent jobs and extensive
benefits for the local economy, was signed under the recently disgraced
and sacked finance minister, Frantz Merceron.
The announced abolition of the secret police, which many Haitians
greeted with skepticism, was part of an extensive military reshuffle in
volving the retirement of 12 senior officers, including rft commanders of
the country's main military unit, the Casernes Dessalines battalion, of
the Leopards antisubversion force, and of the small air force and navy.
Chairmen oppose covert Angolan aid
Chairmen oppose Angolan aid
WASHINGTON — The chairmen of the Senate and House intelli
gence committees have decided to oppose covert military assistance to
noncommunist forces fighting in Angola and are urging the Reagan Ad
ministration instead to seek to convince Congress of the need for an
open assistance program.
The bipartisan advice from Sen. David Durenberger (R-Minn.) chair
man of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and his counterpart
in the House, Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.) came as the Administration
indicated yesterday that it still prefers a new covert-aid program to the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) headed
by Jonas Savimbi, who arrives in Washington today for an intensive two
week lobbying campaign for U.S. support.
Durenberger said in an interview yesterday that he felt "fairly
strongly" that any U.S. aid to UNITA "ought to be overt" and approved
by Congress. He said he is pressing the Administration "to go that
route."
That sentiment was echoed by Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), ranking
minority member of the Senate intelligence committee, who said, "If
we're going to get involved in these kinds of activities, then we ought to
do it overtly, not covertly."
Arms dealers desire sales in China
PEKING — Arms merchants representing some of the world's
leading defense companies have descended on Peking for the first large
scale international defense exhibition to be held here.
U.S. companies have the heaviest representation of foreign firms dis
playing weapons at the exhibition, which opens today and runs until Feb.
2. But they face sharp competition in some areas from French and West
German firms. More than 160 companies from 1 7 countries and regions
are participating. Products on display include aviation equipment,
missiles and defense electronics.
The debate over how far the Chinese will go in purchasing western
defense equipment goes back more than a decade. The Chinese are
noted for doing much window shopping but little buying. But because of
a few sales and the knowledge that the Chinese armed forces need new
equipment, the merchants keep coming.
The most recent significant development in this controversial and
sometimes lucrative field is a Reagan Administration decision to seek
congressional approval for the sale of radar and navigational equipment
to help modernize the Chinese Air Force's F-8 jet fighter plane.
Crisis imminent, Sikhs seize temple
NEW DELHI — India's troubled Punjab State appeared headed for
another crisis yesterday after armed Sikh militants seized control of the
Golden Temple complex in Amritsar and the government of Prime Min
ister Rajiv Gandhi failed to meet a deadline in its agreement with Sikh
political leaders.
For the first time since the bloody June 1984 Indian Army raid on the
Golden Temple, Sikhism's holiest shrine, militants seeking an indepen
dent Sikh homeland in the Punjab gained control of the temple.
About eight million Sikhs live in Punjab, India's most prosperous
agricultural state. So do at least six million Hindus who find themselves
increasingly alienated from the Sikh community.
For several months after a July 1985 peace accord between Gandhi
and leaders of the mainstream Sikh political party, the Akali Dal, Pun
jab remained relatively quiet. However, in recent weeks tensions have
been building again, particularly last week after a New Delhi judge sen
tenced three Sikhs to death by hanging for their role in the October 1984
assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Rajiv Gandhi's mother.
Visitors yesterday to the nearly 400-year-old temple — which is
named for an ornate gold-plated building at its center, surrounded by a
reflecting pond — said that several hundred Sikh youths were in the
grounds, most of them armed with swords and shotguns. Saffron pen
nants, a symbol of the separatist Sikh state of Khalistan, flew from the
fortified walls.
The actions by the militants have drawn angry response from Sikh po
litical leaders and moderates. At a meeting yesterday in Chandigarh, the
state capital that Punjab shares with the neighboring state of Haryana,
leaders of the Akali Dal party condemned the seizure of the temple
complex as "part of a big conspiracy to destroy the Sikh faith."
Most of the militants appeared to be followers of the Sikh fundamen
talist leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. Bhindranwale, a charismatic
leader with long flowing hair tied in a royal blue turban, was killed in the
1984 army raid, in which the government says 491 other Sikhs died.
Honduran president asks for aid
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras — Jose Azcona took office as president
of Honduras yesterday in a ceremony that marked the first time in 53
years that one elected civilian succeeded another as chief executive.
In his inaugural address, Azcona called for measures to ease the na
tion's foreign-debt burden and to promote exports. He offered few clues
about his position on foreign policy, although he said that Honduras
would maintain its "unchanging friendship" with the United States.
Azcona, 59, whose silver hair and erect bearing give him a states
manlike appearance, has a reputation for personal honesty. Departing
President Roberto Suazo Cordova was known for political wheeling and
dealing.
"I am not going to tolerate immorality in my government, nor lazi
ness," Azcona said. That line received loud applause from the crowd at
the windswept National Stadium.
Vice President George Bush headed the delegation from Washington
that attended the ceremony. Bush also attended the inauguration of
Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo on Jan. 14.
U.S. officials lauded this inauguration, like Cerezo's, as evidence that
democracy was taking root in a region where the armed forces histori
cally have dominated politics. In both Honduras and Guatemala,
however, the military remains a powerful limit to presidential power.
Haiti claims secret police abolished
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Haiti's president-for-life, Jean-Claude
Duvalier, announced the formal abolition of his government's secret
police during the weekend in a new effort to satisfy critics here and in
Washington.
But new anti-government demonstrations erupted in several towns,
including the country's second city. Cap Haitien, where heavily armed
troops fired tear gas at several thousand stone-throwing protesters.
The city's prefect was attacked as demonstrators surged through the
narrow streets, spray-painting slogans on walls and calling for the presi
dent to resign and for the army to help them overthrow the government.
Most of the city's shops shut after threats to burn them.
The protests coincided with the arrival at nearby Labadie of 1,200
cruise passengers for the delayed inauguration of a much criticized
