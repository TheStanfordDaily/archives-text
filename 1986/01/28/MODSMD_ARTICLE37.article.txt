# Exxon, Arco to pay heavy penalties
## 
### 
NEW YORK — Atlantic Richfield agreed yes
terday to pay $315 million in restitution and fines
to settle a federal suit alleging that the Los
Angeles-based company violated federal oil-price
controls in crude-oil trades between March 1978
and January 1981.
Separately, the Supreme Court declined to
review a lower-court decision that fined Exxon
$2.1 billion for overcharging customers for crude
oil pumped from the sprawling Hawkins Field oil
properties nearly Tyler, Texas. The sum will be
divided among the 50 states to fund energy conser
vation programs, with the largest, $200 million,
going to California.
The two cases were among about 400 that are
still pending from the seven-year period when
domestic oil prices were governed by complex rules
promulgated by the U.S. Department of Energy.
The Arco agreement settled a case in which the
energy agency alleged that the company had col
lected $240 million in illegal charges through a se
ries of two-way trades. The agency contended that
the oil company sold price-controlled domestic
nrnHe nil to customers who promised, in turn, to

sell unregulated foreign crude to Arco at a dis
count.
The Energy Department had sought $499 mil
lion from Arco. and last year rejected an Arco offer
to settle for $225 million. The $315 million in
cludes $313 million in restitution and $2 million to
satisfy the government's claims that the oil com
pany should also be fined.
Arco admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement
agreement, which will not be final until the Energy
Department has solicited public comments and
held a public hearing.
Last summer, Arco agreed to pay $65.7 million
to settle separate Energy Department claims that it
had violated price rules on crude and refined petro
leum products in the early 19705, shortly after
federal price controls were imposed. Late Monday,
federal and Arco officials said they were unable to
immediately provide further details of those allega
tions.
Arco's provision for the settlement brought a net
$ 164 million after-tax charge for the quarter ended
Dec. 31, causing Arco's net income for the period

to drop 50 percent to $142 million, the company
said in an earnings report that was also released
yesterday
Exxon said it will pay $895.5 million in restitu
tion, plus interest that brings the total charge to
$2.1 billion. However, an Exxon spokesman noted
that Exxon will recoup a portion of taxes it paid on
the overpriced crude, and excess royalties it paid to
owners of the oil field property.
When those savings are considered, Exxon ex
pects its net cost to amount to about $1 billion, ac
cording to the spokesman. She noted that the oil
giant has set aside reserves to cover the charge, and
said the penalties would not figure in the com
pany's soon-to-be-released 1985 earnings results.
In a statement, Exxon Chairman Clifton C. Gar
vin said the company was "extremely disap
pointed" in the Supreme Court's ruling, which he
charged "continues a trend of judicial rulings un
favorable to the oil industry."
Garvin said the federal price control rules in
volved myriad legal issues which the oil companies
struggled to interpret, but which were often rein
terpreted later by federal officials.
