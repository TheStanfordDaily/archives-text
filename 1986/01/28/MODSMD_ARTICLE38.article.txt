# Thatcher denies information-leak charge

### 
LONDON — British Prime Mini
ster Margaret Thatcher, seeking to
ride out the gravest political crisis she
has faced in more than six years in
power, yesterday rejected opposition
charges that she was personally in
volved in a decision to leak confiden
tial government information.
Speaking in an emergency debate
in Parliament, the prime minister
conceded that her Conservative gov
ernment had mishandled aspects of
the protracted Westland helicopter
affair, which already has led to the
resignations of two senior ministers.
But, despite repeated protests and in
terruptions from her left-wing oppo
nents, she denied that she is guilty of
any wrongdoing.
Yesterday's debate in a tense,
overflowing House of Commons had
the hallmarks of a great parliamen
tary occasion, with Thatcher as the
main protagonist. Faced by an oppo
sition onslaught on her judgment and
integrity, the prime minister
succeeded in rallying Conservative
members of Parliament behind her
but failed to quell growing criticism
about her own actions and those of
her closest advisers in the month-long
controversy.
What began as an internal Cabinet
dispute over the financial rescue of
the bankrupt Westland helicopter
company has escalated into a major
political challenge to Thatcher with
nearly daily revelations about ques
tionable political activity and deep
divisions within her government.
Although most commentators here
doubt that Thatcher's position as

prime minister is in any immediate
danger, given the solid Conservative
majority in Parliament, the consensus
is that her authority has been
seriously and perhaps permanently
weakened. Her standing in the
opinion polls has plummeted, with
the Observer newspaper reporting
last weekend that about 43 percent of
Britons believed she should resign
because of the Westland affair.
The opposition censure motion was
defeated by a majority of 160 after
Thatcher's main Conservative party

critic, former defense minister Mi
chael Heseltine, announced that he
would vote with the government.
Heseltine resigned from the Cabinet
on Jan. 9 after accusing Thatcher of
practicing arbitrary and authoritarian
methods of government.
The main point at issue in yester
day's three-hour debate, which oppo
sition leaders .described as a par
liamentary "trial" of Thatcher, was
the leaking to the press on Jan. 6 of a
confidential letter from the govern
ment's chief law officer that was used

to discredit Heseltine. Thatcher
conceded last week that the letter was
leaked on the instructions of her close
political ally, former trade and indus
try secretary Leon Brittan, with the
approval of her own private office.
Under Britain's restrictive "official
secrets" legislation, which Thatcher
has pledged to enforce, the unaut
horized leaking of information is a
criminal offense here. There is also a
strict Cabinet rule against publicizing
the private advice of government le
gal officers.
Thatcher, who was repeatedly in
terrupted by jeers and catcalls from
the opposition but cheered on by her
fellow Conservatives, yesterday said
that she did not learn of the Jan. 6
leak until the following day. She also
insisted that she did not learn of her
trade secretary's involvement in the
affair until receiving the results of an
official inquiry on Jan. 22.
Brittan was forced to resign last
Friday in response to criticism among
rank-and-file Conservative members
of Parliament for his handling of the
affair. His action left Thatcher, who
became Conservative leader 10 years
ago. directly in the political firing
line.
Opposition leaders yesterday ex
pressed incredulity at the prime mini
ster's insistence that she had been
kept in the dark by her senior offi
cials. The leader of the centrist Social
Democratic party, David Owen, said
he feels that if her version of events
was true then the officials concerned
should be dismissed.
