Court on church/state
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court ruled
unanimously yesterday that the constitutional
separation of church and state does not prohibit
public financial aid to a disabled person studying
to become a minister.
The court, upholding the Reagan Administra
tion and several religious organizations, over
turned a decision by the Washington state Su
preme Court that found such assistance by the
state violated the Constitution's mandate against
government establishment of religion.
As they have in previous church-state cases,
the justices drew a distinction between aid to a
religious individual and aid to a religious in
stituiton.
A Washington state program, providing voca
tional assistance to all eligible disabled students,
"is in no way skewed towards religion" and "is
not one of the ingenious plans" for improperly
channeling state aid to sectarian schools. Justice
Thurgood Marshall wrote for the court.
In an important environmental decision, the
Supreme Court also ruled Monday that states
may prevent bankrupt companies from evading
the cost of toxic waste cleanups by abandoning
the site.
The justices, by a vote of 5-4. upheld a lower

court ruling that barred a bankruptcy trustee
from abandoning waste disposal sites in New Jer
sey and New York that were contaminated with
hazardous materials.
Speakes denies spy story
WASHINGTON — The White House yester
day strongly denied that a previously unknown
high-ranking KGB officer had defected from the
Soviet Union to the West last year, a denial that
added a new touch of mystery to Washington's
latest spy story.
U.S. News and World Report said in yester
day's issue that the defector had been a major
general in the KGB, the Soviet secret police, and
had brought "extremely valuable" information to
the West. The magazine's account said this defec
tor, labeled "the fifth man," was higher ranking
than the four spies that the Central Intelligence
Agency acknowledges fled to the West last year.
In an unusually flat denial, White House
spokesman Larry Speakes said yesterday, "That
story is not correct." When Speakes was then
asked which "aspect" of the story he was
denying, he replied, "The whole thing."
Reporters asked additional questions, and
Speakes persisted in his denial, saying, "This
KGB defector that was described in U.S. News
and World Report is not so."

Bolt delays shuttle
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — A single, cross
threaded bolt and tricky crosswinds combined
yesterday to force yet another departure delay
for the space shuttle Challenger and its much bal-
Iyhooed passenger. New England schoolteacher
Christa McAuliffe. The setback threatens an am
bitious attempt to gain a close-up look at Halley's
comet.
Postponement came three hours after a sched
uled 9:37 a.m. EST launch. While NASA offi
cials blamed winds, precious time was lost when
technicians were forced to wield a hacksaw and
power drill against a common, four-inch bolt at
tached to a hatch door handle.
Stocks still edge forward
NEW YORK — The stock market chalked up
its third straight gain yesterday amid hopes that
lower oil prices would give a lift to the economy.
The advance stood up even though oil prices
rebounded a bit in commodity markets after their
sharp decline of late.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
27.64 points last Thursday and Friday, climbed
another 7.68 to 1,537.61.
