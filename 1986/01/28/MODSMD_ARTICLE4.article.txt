# Peppers burn hole in Concert Network's budget

It's been nearly two weeks since the Red Hot Chili Peppers
rocked Memorial Auditorium, but the damages caused by the
group are still burning a hole in the pocket of the Stanford Con
cert Network.
During the Jan. 17 concert, rowdy fans caused an estimated
$1,700 worth of damage to Mem Aud, knocking down a rail
around the orchestra pit and tearing a curtain draped over it.
"Picking that group to play in Mem Aud was not the best deci
sion to make," although it was a learning experience, according
to Concert Network Director Michael O'Hara.
Because of the damage to Mem Aud, and because the Peppers

show lost money for tne Network, O'Hara said his group is plan
ning to "take money out of our reserve account."
O'Hara predicted that the Peppers show would not inhibit
future Network efforts to bring concerts to campus.
"We plan to subsidize any losses in Mem Aud by making
money on shows in Frost (Amphitheater), which have in the past
been very successful," O'Hara said. "The chances for concerts at
Stanford have not been crushed. The only thing this sliow has af
fected is th'c lUea ot doing rock shows in Mem Aud.
"I think (University officials) see the way we conducted our
selves as well-organized," he said.
Suzanne Becker, adviser to the Network and Tresidder pro
gram director, concurred. "Fortunately, I think people through
out the department and people who have been involved in it (the
show) have been very level-headed. ... We have some examin

ing to do about throwing rock 'n' roll concerts in Mem Aud," she
said.
O'Hara called the show "very successful from a production
and security standpoint. The security team responded well to
controlling the crowd, and, in general, we kept to our schedule."
The problems that plagued the Network's first Mem Aud pro
duction have not put a damper on the organization's drive to
bring quality shows to the Stanford community, according to Be
cker. She pointed out that on May 10 and 11, the Grateful Dead
will perform in Frost Amphitheatre.
Last year's Dead show "went very well," she said.
Becker was also optimistic about bringing Windham Hill to
Stanford. The Network would like to make Windham Hill and
the Grateful Dead annual acts to which they can add other shows
that are "popular throughout the campus," she said.
