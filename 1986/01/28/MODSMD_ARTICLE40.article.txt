Voyager discovers rings
PASADENA — Voyager 2 has found broad
bands of fine dust between the tinted black rings
circling Uranus, and the outermost ring is made
up of 3-foot chunks, scientists said yesterday.
They also said the length of a day on Uranus,
the time it takes to make a complete rotation on
its axis, is about 16 hours, 48 minutes, but could
be as little as 16 hours, 30 minutes or as much as
17 hours and six minutes.
All nine of Uranus' previously known rings —
they were discovered from Earth in 1977 — and
a 10th discovered by Voyager lie within the
broad bands of fine particles.
The picture revealing the dust bands, transmit
ted to Earth on Sunday, was taken with a 96-

second exposure when Voyager was about
155,000 miles behind Uranus.
'Olympic' ban affirmed
SAN FRANCISCO — For the second time, a
federal appeals court yesterday upheld the U.S.
Olympic Committee's right to stop sponsors of an
international athletic competition for
homosexuals from calling it the Gay Olympics.
A 1978 federal law gives the USOC the sole
right to the commercial use of the word
"Olympics" to promote any product or athletic
event, said the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
The three-judge panel rejected arguments by
San Francisco Arts & Athletics, sponsor of the
event, that the USOC should have to prove that
the name confused the public, that the USOC

discriminated by allowing non-homosexual
groups to use the word "Olympics," and that
freedom of speech was violated.
Writer Hubbard dies
LOS ANGELES — L. Ron Hubbard, the sci
ence fiction writer who founded the controversial
Church of Scientology three decades ago, has
died, the church announced yesterday night. He
was 74.
The reclusive Hubbard, who had not been seen
in public since 1980, did not control the church
and its corporations for the past few years, said
the Rev. Hebcr Jentzsch, president of the Church
of Scientology International.
Hubbard died of a stroke Friday at his ranch
near San Luis Obispo. 150 miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles, Jentzsch said.
