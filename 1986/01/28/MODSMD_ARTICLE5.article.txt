### CHARLES SEAVEY Staff writer 
This is the second of two articles
on the issue of strategic defense.
Dr. Edward Teller, an outspoken
advocate of strategic defense, takes
a position opposing that of
Wolfgang Panofsky, whose views
appeared in The Daily in Novem
ber.
Dr. Edward Teller, known as
"father of the hydrogen bomb,"
has been actively involved in
physics since the 19205. He has
received numerous honorary

Feature

degrees and awards and is the au
thor of several books. He is best
known for his work on the atomic
and hydrogen bombs at Columbia
University and Los Alamos, N.M.
from 1941 to 1951 and his associ

Recently, Teller has become
more involved in the political
sphere while concentrating less on
pure science. He has been a mem

boards and an active advocate of
such things as nuclear energy and
strategic defense. Teller has been
a senior fellow at the Hoover In

defense research and expressed his
doubt that negotiations with the
Soviet Union could result in
meaningful arms reductions. Tel
ler also repeated his piea for the
"opening up" of U.S. strategic
defense research.
Treaties vs. defense
Teller's ideas on what is the best
way to reduce the threat of nuclear
weapons are directly opposed to
those which Wolfgang Panofsky,
director of Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC), voiced
last November. Panofsky said a
defense that takes into account
Soviet counter-defensive
measures would be impossible. He
emphasised negotiations as the
primary means for reducing the
threat of nuclear armaments.
Teller, on the other hand,
stressed that an effective defense
which takes into account possible
counter-measures is possible and
that meaningful arms reduction
negotiations with the Soviet Union
are impossible as long as the
U.S.S.R. remains a "closed soci
ety."
Teller disagreed with those who
say that defense-based stability is
