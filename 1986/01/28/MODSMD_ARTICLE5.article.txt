### CHARLES SEAVEY Staff writer 
This is the second of two articles
on the issue of strategic defense.
Dr. Edward Teller, an outspoken
advocate of strategic defense, takes
a position opposing that of
Wolfgang Panofsky, whose views
appeared in The Daily in Novem
ber.
Dr. Edward Teller, known as
"father of the hydrogen bomb,"
has been actively involved in
physics since the 19205. He has
received numerous honorary

Feature

degrees and awards and is the au
thor of several books. He is best
known for his work on the atomic
and hydrogen bombs at Columbia
University and Los Alamos, N.M.
from 1941 to 1951 and his associ
ation with the Manhattan Project.
Recently, Teller has become
more involved in the political
sphere while concentrating less on
pure science. He has been a mem
ber of federal defense advisory
boards and an active advocate of
such things as nuclear energy and
strategic defense. Teller has been
a senior fellow at the Hoover In
stitution since 1975.
In an interview with The Daily
last week. Teller advocated an in

crease in U.S. funding of strategic
defense research and expressed his
doubt that negotiations with the
Soviet Union could result in
meaningful arms reductions. Tel
ler also repeated his piea for the
"opening up" of U.S. strategic
defense research.
Treaties vs. defense
Teller's ideas on what is the best
way to reduce the threat of nuclear
weapons are directly opposed to
those which Wolfgang Panofsky,
director of Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC), voiced
last November. Panofsky said a
defense that takes into account
Soviet counter-defensive
measures would be impossible. He
emphasised negotiations as the
primary means for reducing the
threat of nuclear armaments.
Teller, on the other hand,
stressed that an effective defense
which takes into account possible
counter-measures is possible and
that meaningful arms reduction
negotiations with the Soviet Union
are impossible as long as the
U.S.S.R. remains a "closed soci
ety."
Teller disagreed with those who
say that defense-based stability is
not feasible and argue that while the United
States is developing its defense the Soviets
will be learning how to undermine it. Teller
explained that a defense that takes into ac
count possible counter-measures is possible.
"We should look for defenses which are
effective, where the counter-measures
against them are more difficult than the
deployment of defenses, and where,
therefore, the defense will win. ... In trying
to do the research, we should look for the
kinds of systems where the counter
measures are difficult," he said.
Theory vs. reality
Teller said that criticisms concerning the
possibility of counter-measures, such as
those voiced by Panofsky, should be con
structive rather than critical of defense as a
whole.
" Panofsky's criticism, which is welcome,
should be a positive criticism where he helps
us to eliminate the poorer approaches and to
perfect the better ones. He has arrived at his
conclusion that there are no better ap
proaches in a very much shorter time than,
for instance, I have spent in trying to think
of a variety of defenses. And strangely
enough, or, in a way, consistently enough,
Panofsky argued 16 years ago — as today —
that defenses will never be effective.
"I claim that some of us have worked on it
a long time, and our opponents have come
to their conclusions as though it were a gen
eral theorem. Theorems do exist in physics,
but do not exist with the same completeness
in military matters," he said.
The obvious choice
Teller said he is in favor of increased
spending for strategic defense research
primarily because it "makes sense" and be
cause the Soviets are already surpassing
U.S. efforts with their own defense research
and deployment.
"To work for defense is the most obvious
thing to do. We are spending now something
like two percent of military expenditure on
defense. 1 believe that is much too little, and
not only should we continue it, it's badly
needed that we step it up. . . . It is common
sense that we do it. If they do it and we
don't, then in addition to common sense it
becomes insanity not to do it,"he said.
Teller emphasized that the Soviets are
ahead of the United States in the develop
ment of a strategic defense system. "On our
initiative, they (the Soviets) signed a limita
tion on defense in 1972 which allowed one
place to be defended in the United States
and one in the Soviet Union.
"We deployed a defense (a missile site)
around Grand Forks, N.D., and then
abandoned it as useless. The Russians

deployed (a missile site) around Moscow
and upgraded it twice. We don't know how
effective it is, but it is operational, and they
may have hardware to copy it in many places
that could be rapidly deployed.
"The only thing that cannot be rapidly
deployed is the radar that goes with it. That
(the radar), they have started to deploy .. ~
which is against the treaty," he said.
Teller also pointed out an inconsistency in
Soviet policy.
"(The Soviets) have argued for defense all
along. Then, in March 1983, when Reagan
said that we should do research on defense,
within three days they started to oppose it
and have opposed it ever since, while they
continue to build up their own defense at a
rate considerably more expensive than
ours," he said.

In line with this observation. Teller
added, "We talk about parity in offense.
The public hardly knows about parity in
defense. . . . Those who criticize the Ameri
can expenditure on defense should say
something about the Russian expenditure
rather than to ignore it. That is not the only
reason, but it makes the counter-argument
somewhat peculiar."
"We should be open"
Teller said that he strongly opposed the
present U.S. policy of secrecy with regard to
our knowledge of Soviet defense.
"(The Soviets) already have developed
their defenses, and they are way ahead of us.
We have said that, but we have not given all
the detailed data about it, which we should.
And I agree that our policy of secrecy where
we are trying not to talk about Russian
secrets, or talk about them only partially, is
not justified," he said.
Teller said he is also opposed to the U.S.
government's secrecy of its own defense re

search. "We should be open. 3ut we are not.
That is one of our big mistakes and continu
ing mistakes," he said.
" Pop-up" for now
On the subject of methods of defense,
Teller stressed he does not presently support
a defense deployed in space, but instead
favors a "pop-up" defense.
"I am not advocating deployed objects in
space because they seem to be expensive to
put up and easy to destroy. A pop-up system
cannot be destroyed without attacking the
United States. . . . We can notice a massive
launching of missiles in many ways. When
the missiles are launched, we can pop up the
defensive system. This is the obvious way to
start on defense.
"To deploy satellites, and, if they are
damaged, to deploy more satellites, is possi
ble provided we find ways to deploy
satellites very cheaply or provided some
other ingenious means are discovered. . .
(Space-based defense) is a possibility. It is
not a reality. And as far as I am concerned, I
have never supported it,"he said.
Meaningful negotiations implausible
While confident that we can develop an
effective defense, Teller expressed doubts
that it is possible to have meaningful arms
reduction negotiations with the Soviets. He
said that a major reason for this doubt is our
inability to verify the number and type of
nuclear explosives that the Soviet Union
possesses.
"The Soviets are talking on the basis of a
controlled country in which any step of
verification is centrally directed. We are
talking from the point of view of an open so
ciety where real secrets cannot be kept.. . .
To have a formal arms reduction agreement
on this basis is like talking mathematics be j
tween two deaf mutes who have not agreed
on the symbols they are going to use.
Criticisms aren't valid
Teller rejected other criticisms of pro
posed strategic defense systems.
He did not agree with the "spinning
missile " concept, which holds that the
missiles would be spinning around so
quickly that lasers would "bounce off' of
them.
"There is nothing impermeable. You can
use lasers with such short bursts that during
the burst time, the spinning does not count.
"The most difficult part of defense is apt
to be defense against (ballistic) missiles," he
noted. "If we can do that, it is very likely
that we can have defense against anything
else, partly by the same means, partly by dif
ferent means."

something about the Russian expenditure
rather than to ignore it. That is not the only
reason, but it makes the counter-argument
somewhat peculiar."
"We should be open"
Teller said that he strongly opposed the
present U.S. policy of secrecy with regard to
our knowledge of Soviet defense.
"(The Soviets) already have developed
their defenses, and they are way ahead of us.
We have said that, but we have not given all
the detailed data about it, which we should.
And I agree that our policy of secrecy where
we are trying not to talk about Russian
secrets, or talk about them only partially, is
not justified," he said.
Teller said he is also opposed to the U.S.
government's secrecy of its own defense re

search. "We should be open. 3ut we are not.
That is one of our big mistakes and continu
ing mistakes," he said.
" Pop-up" for now
On the subject of methods of defense,
Teller stressed he does not presently support
a defense deployed in space, but instead
favors a "pop-up" defense.
"I am not advocating deployed objects in
space because they seem to be expensive to
put up and easy to destroy. A pop-up system
cannot be destroyed without attacking the
United States. . . . We can notice a massive
launching of missiles in many ways. When
the missiles are launched, we can pop up the
defensive system. This is the obvious way to
start on defense.
"To deploy satellites, and, if they are
damaged, to deploy more satellites, is possi
ble provided we find ways to deploy
satellites very cheaply or provided some
other ingenious means are discovered. . .
(Space-based defense) is a possibility. It is
not a reality. And as far as I am concerned, I
have never supported it,"he said.
Meaningful negotiations implausible
While confident that we can develop an
effective defense, Teller expressed doubts
that it is possible to have meaningful arms
reduction negotiations with the Soviets. He
said that a major reason for this doubt is our
inability to verify the number and type of
nuclear explosives that the Soviet Union
possesses.
"The Soviets are talking on the basis of a
controlled country in which any step of
verification is centrally directed. We are
talking from the point of view of an open so
ciety where real secrets cannot be kept.. . .
To have a formal arms reduction agreement
on this basis is like talking mathematics be j
tween two deaf mutes who have not agreed
on the symbols they are going to use.
Criticisms aren't valid
Teller rejected other criticisms of pro
posed strategic defense systems.
He did not agree with the "spinning
missile " concept, which holds that the
missiles would be spinning around so
quickly that lasers would "bounce off' of
them.
"There is nothing impermeable. You can
use lasers with such short bursts that during
the burst time, the spinning does not count.
"The most difficult part of defense is apt
to be defense against (ballistic) missiles," he
noted. "If we can do that, it is very likely
that we can have defense against anything

Dr. Edward Teller
Hoover Fellow
This is the second of two articles
on the issue of strategic defense.
Dr. Edward Teller, an outspoken
advocate of strategic defense, takes
a position opposing that of
Wolfgang Panofsky, whose views
appeared in The Daily in Novem
ber.
Dr. Edward Teller, known as
"father of the hydrogen bomb,"
has been actively involved in
physics since the 19205. He has
received numerous honorary

Feature

degrees and awards and is the au
thor of several books. He is best
known for his work on the atomic
and hydrogen bombs at Columbia
University and Los Alamos, N.M.
from 1941 to 1951 and his associ
ation with the Manhattan Project.
Recently, Teller has become
more involved in the political
sphere while concentrating less on
pure science. He has been a mem
ber of federal defense advisory
boards and an active advocate of
such things as nuclear energy and
strategic defense. Teller has been
a senior fellow at the Hoover In
stitution since 1975.
In an interview with The Daily
last week. Teller advocated an in

crease in U.S. funding of strategic
defense research and expressed his
doubt that negotiations with the
Soviet Union could result in
meaningful arms reductions. Tel
ler also repeated his piea for the
"opening up" of U.S. strategic
defense research.
Treaties vs. defense
Teller's ideas on what is the best
way to reduce the threat of nuclear
weapons are directly opposed to
those which Wolfgang Panofsky,
director of Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC), voiced
last November. Panofsky said a
defense that takes into account
Soviet counter-defensive
measures would be impossible. He
emphasised negotiations as the
primary means for reducing the
threat of nuclear armaments.
Teller, on the other hand,
stressed that an effective defense
which takes into account possible
counter-measures is possible and
that meaningful arms reduction
negotiations with the Soviet Union
are impossible as long as the
U.S.S.R. remains a "closed soci

Teller disagreed with those who
say that defense-based stability is
not feasible and argue that while the United
States is developing its defense the Soviets
will be learning how to undermine it. Teller
explained that a defense that takes into ac
count possible counter-measures is possible.
"We should look for defenses which are
effective, where the counter-measures
against them are more difficult than the
deployment of defenses, and where,
therefore, the defense will win. ... In trying
to do the research, we should look for the
kinds of systems where the counter
measures are difficult," he said.
Theory vs. reality
Teller said that criticisms concerning the
possibility of counter-measures, such as
those voiced by Panofsky, should be con
structive rather than critical of defense as a
whole.
" Panofsky's criticism, which is welcome,
should be a positive criticism where he helps
us to eliminate the poorer approaches and to
perfect the better ones. He has arrived at his
conclusion that there are no better ap
proaches in a very much shorter time than,
for instance, I have spent in trying to think
of a variety of defenses. And strangely
enough, or, in a way, consistently enough,
Panofsky argued 16 years ago — as today —
that defenses will never be effective.
"I claim that some of us have worked on it
a long time, and our opponents have come
to their conclusions as though it were a gen
eral theorem. Theorems do exist in physics,
but do not exist with the same completeness
in military matters," he said.
The obvious choice
Teller said he is in favor of increased
spending for strategic defense research
primarily because it "makes sense" and be
cause the Soviets are already surpassing
U.S. efforts with their own defense research
and deployment.
"To work for defense is the most obvious
thing to do. We are spending now something
like two percent of military expenditure on
defense. 1 believe that is much too little, and
not only should we continue it, it's badly
needed that we step it up. . . . It is common
sense that we do it. If they do it and we
don't, then in addition to common sense it
becomes insanity not to do it,"he said.
Teller emphasized that the Soviets are
ahead of the United States in the develop
ment of a strategic defense system. "On our
initiative, they (the Soviets) signed a limita
tion on defense in 1972 which allowed one
place to be defended in the United States
and one in the Soviet Union.
"We deployed a defense (a missile site)
around Grand Forks, N.D., and then
abandoned it as useless. The Russians

deployed (a missile site) around Moscow
and upgraded it twice. We don't know how
effective it is, but it is operational, and they
may have hardware to copy it in many places
that could be rapidly deployed.
"The only thing that cannot be rapidly
deployed is the radar that goes with it. That
(the radar), they have started to deploy .. ~
which is against the treaty," he said.
Teller also pointed out an inconsistency in
Soviet policy.
"(The Soviets) have argued for defense all
along. Then, in March 1983, when Reagan
said that we should do research on defense,
within three days they started to oppose it
and have opposed it ever since, while they
continue to build up their own defense at a
rate considerably more expensive than
ours," he said.

In line with this observation. Teller
added, "We talk about parity in offense.
The public hardly knows about parity in
defense. . . . Those who criticize the Ameri
can expenditure on defense should say
something about the Russian expenditure
rather than to ignore it. That is not the only
reason, but it makes the counter-argument

therefore, the defense will win. ... In trying
to do the research, we should look for the
kinds of systems where the counter
measures are difficult," he said.
Theory vs. reality
Teller said that criticisms concerning the
possibility of counter-measures, such as
those voiced by Panofsky, should be con
structive rather than critical of defense as a
whole.
" Panofsky's criticism, which is welcome,
should be a positive criticism where he helps
us to eliminate the poorer approaches and to
perfect the better ones. He has arrived at his
conclusion that there are no better ap
proaches in a very much shorter time than,
for instance, I have spent in trying to think
of a variety of defenses. And strangely
enough, or, in a way, consistently enough,
Panofsky argued 16 years ago — as today —
that defenses will never be effective.
"I claim that some of us have worked on it
a long time, and our opponents have come
to their conclusions as though it were a gen
eral theorem. Theorems do exist in physics,
but do not exist with the same completeness
in military matters," he said.
The obvious choice
Teller said he is in favor of increased
spending for strategic defense research
primarily because it "makes sense" and be
cause the Soviets are already surpassing
U.S. efforts with their own defense research
and deployment.
"To work for defense is the most obvious
thing to do. We are spending now something
like two percent of military expenditure on
defense. 1 believe that is much too little, and
not only should we continue it, it's badly
needed that we step it up. . . . It is common
sense that we do it. If they do it and we
don't, then in addition to common sense it
becomes insanity not to do it,"he said.
Teller emphasized that the Soviets are
ahead of the United States in the develop
ment of a strategic defense system. "On our
initiative, they (the Soviets) signed a limita
tion on defense in 1972 which allowed one
place to be defended in the United States
and one in the Soviet Union.
"We deployed a defense (a missile site)
around Grand Forks, N.D., and then
abandoned it as useless. The Russians

deployed (a missile site) around Moscow
and upgraded it twice. We don't know how
effective it is, but it is operational, and they
may have hardware to copy it in many places
that could be rapidly deployed.
"The only thing that cannot be rapidly
deployed is the radar that goes with it. That
(the radar), they have started to deploy .. ~
which is against the treaty," he said.
Teller also pointed out an inconsistency in
Soviet policy.
"(The Soviets) have argued for defense all
along. Then, in March 1983, when Reagan
said that we should do research on defense,
within three days they started to oppose it
and have opposed it ever since, while they
continue to build up their own defense at a
rate considerably more expensive than
ours," he said.

In line with this observation. Teller
added, "We talk about parity in offense.
The public hardly knows about parity in
defense. . . . Those who criticize the Ameri
can expenditure on defense should say
something about the Russian expenditure
rather than to ignore it. That is not the only
reason, but it makes the counter-argument
somewhat peculiar."
"We should be open"
Teller said that he strongly opposed the
present U.S. policy of secrecy with regard to
our knowledge of Soviet defense.
"(The Soviets) already have developed
their defenses, and they are way ahead of us.
We have said that, but we have not given all
the detailed data about it, which we should.
And I agree that our policy of secrecy where
we are trying not to talk about Russian
secrets, or talk about them only partially, is
not justified," he said.
Teller said he is also opposed to the U.S.
government's secrecy of its own defense re

search. "We should be open. 3ut we are not.
That is one of our big mistakes and continu
ing mistakes," he said.
" Pop-up" for now
On the subject of methods of defense,
Teller stressed he does not presently support
a defense deployed in space, but instead
favors a "pop-up" defense.
"I am not advocating deployed objects in
space because they seem to be expensive to
put up and easy to destroy. A pop-up system
cannot be destroyed without attacking the
United States. . . . We can notice a massive
launching of missiles in many ways. When
the missiles are launched, we can pop up the
defensive system. This is the obvious way to
start on defense.
"To deploy satellites, and, if they are
damaged, to deploy more satellites, is possi
ble provided we find ways to deploy
satellites very cheaply or provided some
other ingenious means are discovered. . .
(Space-based defense) is a possibility. It is
not a reality. And as far as I am concerned, I
have never supported it,"he said.
Meaningful negotiations implausible
While confident that we can develop an
effective defense, Teller expressed doubts
that it is possible to have meaningful arms
reduction negotiations with the Soviets. He
said that a major reason for this doubt is our
inability to verify the number and type of
nuclear explosives that the Soviet Union
possesses.
"The Soviets are talking on the basis of a
controlled country in which any step of
verification is centrally directed. We are
talking from the point of view of an open so
ciety where real secrets cannot be kept.. . .
To have a formal arms reduction agreement
on this basis is like talking mathematics be j
tween two deaf mutes who have not agreed
on the symbols they are going to use.
Criticisms aren't valid
Teller rejected other criticisms of pro
posed strategic defense systems.
He did not agree with the "spinning
missile " concept, which holds that the
missiles would be spinning around so
quickly that lasers would "bounce off' of
them.
"There is nothing impermeable. You can
use lasers with such short bursts that during
the burst time, the spinning does not count.
"The most difficult part of defense is apt
to be defense against (ballistic) missiles," he
noted. "If we can do that, it is very likely
that we can have defense against anything
else, partly by the same means, partly by dif
ferent means."
