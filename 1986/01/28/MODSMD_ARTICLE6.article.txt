# Protesters' trial postponed until April

### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Representatives of 21 students ar
rested last quarter for protesting Uni
versity investments in South Africa
yesterday delayed their scheduled
jury trial at San Jose Municipal Court
by requesting that the proceedings be
carried out in Palo Alto.
"We want to be tried by people
who have a bearing on whether our
rights in the community have been
violated," senior David Romo said
yesterday.
The jury trial will commence April
2 in either San Jose or Palo Alto
Municipal Court, pending a Feb. 25
hearing in which the students' request

will be considered, a San Jose
Municipal Court spokesperson said
yesterday.
Romo, along with graduate stu
dents Eric Diesel and Brad
Hightower, has chosen to represent
himself at the impending trial.
"By representing myself 1 thought I
could focus on the question of justice
rather than legal technicalities. An at
torney would have to bend toward
those technicalities," Romo said.
Diesel, echoing Romo's comments,
said yesterday that he feels "able to
express why (I am innocent) to a
jury."
Senior Robby Perkins, who yester
day was denied University compensa
tion for alleged physical abuse suf

fered at the hands of Stanford police
and Santa Clara County sheriff s offi
cers following an Oct. 11 sit-in
protest, was represented in absentia
by an attorney.
"It would pose hardships on us to
have to appear in San Jose," Perkins
said yesterday. "It's more fair to try
any alledged crime in the location in
which it occurred."
One of the arguments on which the
students may base their defense is
that the initial protests — and ensuing
arrests — took place because the
Stanford administration allowed the
students "no real access to the
decision-making body of the Univer
sity," Romo said.
"I don't believe it's a crime to

peacefully protest apartheid, in any
sense of the word 'crime'," Perkins
said.
Perkins added that he and his at
torney had not discussed a specific
defense strategy for the April trial.
Romo expressed disatisfaction at
the University's decision to adopt a
neutral position concerning any
punitive action toward the protesters,
thereby allowing any reprimand to
stem from the courts.
"The University is passing the
buck," Romo said, adding that Palo
Alto Judge Stephen Manley at a Dec.
6 hearing had expressed a desire to
reach a compromise with the Univer
sity.
