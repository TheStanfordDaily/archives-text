# AIDS conference succeeds despite turnout

### RICK KUWAYTI Staff writer 
Stanford's four-day symposium on Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome, "AIDS Chal
lenge," came to a close Friday night with a panel
discussion that featured Rep. William Dannemeyer
(R-Fullerton).
Stanford junior Meg Richman organized the
symposium, which was sponsored by the Program
in Human Biology. Richman, a double major in
human biology and economics, said the program
sought to educate the community about the social
issues of AIDS as well as the medical truth about
the disease.
Thomas Mcßride, associate dean at Stanford
Law School and moderator of Friday night's event,
praised Richman's effort. "It is a singular contribu
tion she has made," he said. According to Mcßride,
Richman's efforts to bring about the symposium

"in the finest traditions of undergraduate
education . .. she has recognized that learning is
teaching and teaching is learning."
Gerard Koskovich, a graduate student in art his
tory and long-time gay activist here, said he was
"utterly staggered by Meg Richman's efforts and
her success."
"She created an event which was magnificent in
every way," said Koskovich. Koskovich said he is
aware of at least seven similar conferences held at
other universities and colleges, including San Fran
cisco State and San Jose State. "In terms of the
range of topics covered, the significance of the
speakers, and the quality of discourse, Stanford was
vastly superior," Koskovich said, adding that he
believed the symposium was of national impor
tance.
Richman said she was happy with the way the
symposium turned out. "I think the whole thing
came off very well . . . people have been very

excited about it and the support was great," she
said.
But Richman joined several other symposium
participants in expressing disappointment in the
low student turnout during the four days of events.
"It was done for the students ... it was to their
benefit to come," she said.
"Whatever you feel should be the public policy
to the disease, you have to base it on fact," Rich
man said. She added, "The only way you can obtain
those facts is to listen to the experts. Otherwise the
policy will end up in discrimination of someone."
Although Friday night's discussion drew a
capacity crowd in Annenberg Auditorium, Kos
kovich estimated that members of the gay commu
nity made up one-half of the audience.
"I was deeply saddened to see that non-gay
people who have a chance to learn and to protect
themselves before the disease has the
kind of impact it has had on the gay

community don't seem to be bother
ing," Koskovich said.
Despite the low student atten
dance, participants in the symposium
believe that there is a future for
similar events at Stanford.
According to Dr. Merton

Bernfield, Knowles professor of
human biology and moderator of
Wednesday night's discussion,
student-sponsored events such as the
AIDS symposium are very important.
"They have a feel which the faculty
cannot provide," he said.
