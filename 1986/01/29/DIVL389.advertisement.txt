Branner Presents . . .
HERB CAEN
Author of the three dot local interest column that appears six days
a week in the San Francisco Chronicle and has earned him the
nickname of "Mr. San Francisco" Mr. Caen is in his 47th year of
this column that has been said to be "the most widely read column
west of the Mississippi." He will be speaking on his experiences in
journalism.
Come see if he'll answer the age old question, "Is Herb Caen's
column next to the Macy's ad or is the Macy's ad next to
Herb Caen's column?"
