The Challenger space shuttle dis
aster must not deter the United States
from continuing its exploration of
new frontiers in space, a Stanford
Electronics Laboratory engineer said
yesterday.
The benefits of gaining knowledge
outweigh the risks of experimenta
tion, asserted Michael Wiskerchen,
director of the Stanford University
Network for Space Telescience Ap
plications Research (SUNSTAR).
"This nation was founded on the
principle ... of taking risks," he said.
Wiskerchen, asked whether the
crash was anticipated, said, "We cal
culate the probability of a fatal acci
dent occurring," adding that scientists
and engineers have estimated the
chance of a calamity during a launch
as one in 100.
But he emphasized that NASA
should and will continue 'its space
shuttle programs after it concludes a
thorough investigation into yester
day's tragedy.
Wiskerchen, speaking to 160 stu
dents packed into Florence Moore's
Cardenal Lounge, said the disaster
