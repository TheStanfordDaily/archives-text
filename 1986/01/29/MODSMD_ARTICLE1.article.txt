# Challenger explodes after take-off
## Scientist sees serious impact on NASA 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
The Challenger space shuttle dis
aster must not deter the United States
from continuing its exploration of
new frontiers in space, a Stanford
Electronics Laboratory engineer said
yesterday.
The benefits of gaining knowledge
outweigh the risks of experimenta
tion, asserted Michael Wiskerchen,
director of the Stanford University
Network for Space Telescience Ap
plications Research (SUNSTAR).
"This nation was founded on the
principle ... of taking risks," he said.
Wiskerchen, asked whether the
crash was anticipated, said, "We cal
culate the probability of a fatal acci
dent occurring," adding that scientists
and engineers have estimated the
chance of a calamity during a launch
as one in 100.
But he emphasized that NASA
should and will continue 'its space
shuttle programs after it concludes a
thorough investigation into yester
day's tragedy.
Wiskerchen, speaking to 160 stu
dents packed into Florence Moore's
Cardenal Lounge, said the disaster

morning. An emergency rescue mission turned up no sur
vivors ; all aboard are presumed dead. The cause of the explo
sion is still under investigation by NASA.
marked a "sad day" for the United
States and its space exploration pro
grams, and noted that he was a good
friend of one of the shuttle's pas
sengers, Judith Resnik.
The Challenger disaster will
"seriously impact" the space shuttle
program, and NASA will certainly
not launch another shuttle until it
completes its investigation, said Wis
kerchen, a member of the NASA
Space Station Task Force.
He noted also that the Challenger
explosion destroyed a $1 billion com
munication satellite aboard, and that
the disaster might delay other space
missions for longer than a year, spe
cifically the launch of a planet orbiter
called Galileo.
Yesterday's mission was particu

larly important because the Chal
lenger crew included the first private
citizen in space, school teacher
Christa McAuliffe, Wiskerchen said.
Asked whether NASA should or
would bar private citizens from future
shuttle flights, Wiskerchen offered a
firm "no."
"A human life is a human life.
There are no test pilots anymore.
They're people like you and me.. ..
They're scientists and engineers."
Wiskerchen said that although the
Challenger disaster marks a setback
for U.S. science and technology, he is
not overly concerned that the United
States will lose valuable ground in
space exploration competition with
the Soviet Union.
Soviet scientists cooperate willingly
with the United States and, as a rule,
share "need-to-know" information
quite liberally, he said. "We never
have any trouble working with the
Russians science-to-science."
