With the shock and sorrow that accompanied yester
day's tragic shuttle accident, it is difficult to remain ob
jective. Yet keeping things in perspective is important.
The seven astronauts who gave their lives for
America's space program were dedicated professionals
committed to the future of space exploration. The
greatest disservice we could do them is to turn our back
on space and let their sacrifice be wasted.
The overwhelming media blitz of the next few days
will undoubtedly push the spectacular successes of
Voyager ll's encounter with Uranus off the front pages
and obscure the fact that NASA's space progranvhas
been one of the safest and most successful endeavors
the federal government has ever undertaken.
But NASA is dying. Voyager II was launched over
nine years ago. The last American left the moon in
1975. Since then, NASA's budget has dropped steadily
to today's meager level. Numerous planned space pro
grams — including a probe to study Halley's Comet
and a manned mission to Mars — have been postponed
or cancelled for lack of funds. The space shuttle pro
gram itself was slated for cancellation until the Depart
ment of Defense stepped in and took over. Now, over
half the money for the shuttle program comes from the
Pentagon and many of the flights are defense oriented.
We are increasingly focusing on the "practical"
aspects of space: Star Wars, spy satellites, space manu
facturing. "Pure" space exploration and research are
nearly extinct. Ingoring the fact that these programs
more than paid for themselves through the increased
GNP generated by their scientific advances, there is an
even larger consideration.

For many Americans, space represented more than
just a new arena for the arms race. Space was interna
tional cooperation; space was the hope for a better
world; space was the future. Space harkened back to a
youthful president and the idealism of his era. It
reminded us of a time when people believed they could
make the world a better place.
In the "me" decade of the '70s and now in the
"yuppie" decade of the '80s, it has become fashionable
to laugh at the naivete and idealism of the early days of
space exploration. And as those hopes have died, so
has our space program.
There is nothing wrong with attempting to utilize the
practical aspects of space. But space exploration once
meant much more to America, and it can again. The
excitement generated by the shuttle progam is an indi
cation that space has not completely relinquished its
hold on our imaginations. It is time for us to rededicate
ourselves to the peaceful aspects of space and space ex
ploration, even at the risk of further tragedies.
In light of impending budget cuts, this will not be
easy. In fact the trend is in the other direction. There
are those who argue that we must solve our problems
here on earth before we can afford exploration in
space.
Certainly there are domestic and social problems
that require more attention, but we cannot allow these
concerns to prevent us from pushing ahead. It is not a
question of whether we can afford a civilian space pro
gram, but a question of whether we can afford to be
without one.
Those aboard the Challenger would probably agree.
