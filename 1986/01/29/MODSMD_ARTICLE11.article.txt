So I open The Daily today and find
out that people who I don't even
know are talking about me. The com
ments of Gina Hernandez in yester
day's Daily article about the new con
stitution stated that since I was white,
I was insensitive to the needs of
minority groups. Now, anyone who is
accused of racism would probably im
mediately respond with the somewhat
cliched "I lived with a black
roommate for two years" or'T partic
ipated in apartheid protests" or "I
shook Bishop Tutu's hand." But that
is the same kind of one-dimensional
categorization that makes racism so
abhorrent — assessing people with
out regard to them as individuals but
merely, as I was (to the effect) — well
she's white, so she's against
minorities, but she's a woman so
that's not so bad.
What I resent the most, I guess, is
the omissions. The new constitution
was authored by many people. Too
many to list, and I'm not even going
to give you a hint as to what their eth
nic makeup was. Although I am a
woman, I reserved my input mostly
for graduate representation isues. I
am one of the first graduate students
in a very long time to be a member of
the Council of Presidents (COP), and
given the status of graduate student's
rights on this campus, I feel that is my
primary responsibility. Andy Frisch
(COP member) is our Woman's Cen
ter representative. Ask them how
sensitive he is.
The most disheartening aspect of
all this constitutional debate is that no

one has mentioned how representa
tive the old system was, or how fair it
is to minority student groups. Ask
Eric Diesel himself. He has been one
of the most vocal critics of the senate,
once even attempting to stage a sit-in
to protest a funding decision. How
many black senators do we have
now? Ask any member of a student
group who has been forced to watch
their needs ignored as their budgets
were sent around to three different
committees, ask them how fair that
was. And ask any of the three white
male COP members who went to jail
to protest the beating of Robby
Perkins how empathetic they are to
the needs of the few.
Whether the constitution is old or
new, it is the student body who
decides who their elected representa
tives are. I am greatly saddened by
the implication that the choice given
to my fellow students is black or
white. Decisions about important stu
dent issues are never so clear cut.
And despite the remarks of a few,
poorly informed people, I still have
faith in Stanford students to be able
to make decisions for themselves in
matters that are mostly gray.

In yesterday's Daily editorial, a
positive message was put out about
what Bishop Desmond Tutu stood for
— freedom — and called for — ac
tion. However, The Daily's descrip
tion of the liberation organizations in

Azania, took on the wording and
sentiment that the Botha and Reagan
regimes are promoting. Although
Tutu, the United Nations, the Organ
ziation of African Unity and the vast
majority of Black South Africans,
refer to Nelson Mandela as
"president" and the banned African
National Congress and Pan Africanist
Congress as legitimate liberation or
ganizations, The Daily chooses lan
guage used by the illegitimate apart
heid regime. The Daily tells us of the
efforts of the South African govern
ment to monitor Tutu's addresses
which, in the words of the edit board
"are becoming more favorable
toward black terrorist organizations."
I doubt The Daily would call the Af
ghan rebels, or members of the
French resistance "terrorist," but
some now see fit to use the words of
the very government they appear to
be opposed to.
It is not out of a naive surprise that
I write this letter. The words of the
Botha regime are best transmitted
through the efforts, unwitting or not,
of the Western press, including our
campus publications. However, if the
editorial staff at The Daily truly
wishes to support the efforts of the
oppressed people of South Africa,
then as an anti-apartheid activist, I
suggest the presentation of all aspects
of the struggle be presented in a more
objective manner, with appropriate
language utilized. If The Daily sees fit
to use the term "terrorist" let them
use it the way the oppressed South
African people use it: to describe the
apartheid regime.

know are talking about me. The com
ments of Gina Hernandez in yester
day's Daily article about the new con
stitution stated that since I was white,
I was insensitive to the needs of
minority groups. Now, anyone who is
accused of racism would probably im
mediately respond with the somewhat
cliched "I lived with a black
roommate for two years" or'T partic
ipated in apartheid protests" or "I
shook Bishop Tutu's hand." But that
is the same kind of one-dimensional
categorization that makes racism so
abhorrent — assessing people with
out regard to them as individuals but
merely, as I was (to the effect) — well
she's white, so she's against
minorities, but she's a woman so
that's not so bad.
What I resent the most, I guess, is
the omissions. The new constitution
was authored by many people. Too
many to list, and I'm not even going
to give you a hint as to what their eth
nic makeup was. Although I am a
woman, I reserved my input mostly
for graduate representation isues. I
am one of the first graduate students
in a very long time to be a member of
the Council of Presidents (COP), and
given the status of graduate student's
rights on this campus, I feel that is my
primary responsibility. Andy Frisch
(COP member) is our Woman's Cen
ter representative. Ask them how
sensitive he is.
The most disheartening aspect of
all this constitutional debate is that no

one has mentioned how representa
tive the old system was, or how fair it
is to minority student groups. Ask
Eric Diesel himself. He has been one
of the most vocal critics of the senate,
once even attempting to stage a sit-in
to protest a funding decision. How
many black senators do we have
now? Ask any member of a student
group who has been forced to watch
their needs ignored as their budgets
were sent around to three different
committees, ask them how fair that
was. And ask any of the three white
male COP members who went to jail
to protest the beating of Robby
Perkins how empathetic they are to
the needs of the few.
Whether the constitution is old or
new, it is the student body who
decides who their elected representa
tives are. I am greatly saddened by
the implication that the choice given
to my fellow students is black or
white. Decisions about important stu
dent issues are never so clear cut.
And despite the remarks of a few,
poorly informed people, I still have
faith in Stanford students to be able
to make decisions for themselves in
matters that are mostly gray.

Change language
of apartheid issue
In yesterday's Daily editorial, a
positive message was put out about
what Bishop Desmond Tutu stood for
— freedom — and called for — ac
tion. However, The Daily's descrip
tion of the liberation organizations in

Azania, took on the wording and
sentiment that the Botha and Reagan
regimes are promoting. Although
Tutu, the United Nations, the Organ
ziation of African Unity and the vast
majority of Black South Africans,
refer to Nelson Mandela as
"president" and the banned African
National Congress and Pan Africanist
Congress as legitimate liberation or
ganizations, The Daily chooses lan
guage used by the illegitimate apart
heid regime. The Daily tells us of the
efforts of the South African govern
ment to monitor Tutu's addresses
which, in the words of the edit board
"are becoming more favorable
toward black terrorist organizations."
I doubt The Daily would call the Af
ghan rebels, or members of the
French resistance "terrorist," but
some now see fit to use the words of
the very government they appear to
be opposed to.
It is not out of a naive surprise that
I write this letter. The words of the
Botha regime are best transmitted
through the efforts, unwitting or not,
of the Western press, including our
campus publications. However, if the
editorial staff at The Daily truly
wishes to support the efforts of the
oppressed people of South Africa,
then as an anti-apartheid activist, I
suggest the presentation of all aspects
of the struggle be presented in a more
objective manner, with appropriate
language utilized. If The Daily sees fit
to use the term "terrorist" let them
use it the way the oppressed South
African people use it: to describe the
apartheid regime.
