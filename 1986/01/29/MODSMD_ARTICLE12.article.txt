## Murals illustrate past repression 
### 
Tom De Paul's viewpoint (The Daily, Jan. 27)
entitled "Racist murals persuaded no one" con
tained several distortions and accusations which
we, as members of MEChA (Moviento Estudiantil
Chicano de Aztlan) and members of the Chicano
community at Stanford, feel the need to respond to.

Each year Zapata and the Chicano community
face attacks on the murals which exist in Casa
Zapata. And each year, the community is forced to
defend them as important political and cultural
expressions. The murals at Zapata have a right to
exist; this is not an issue that is open for debate and
we will not even discuss it here. What we do want
to discuss are the accusations of "racism," the
trivialization of the conditions in South Africa and
Central America, and De Paul's attempt to define
"legitimate political interaction."
The fundamental point which De Paul fails to
understand is that Zapata's murals arc expressions
which have been born out of a history of the
oppression of the Chicano people. This is impor
tant. It is not "racism"' which compels us to view a
white police officer as a threat; it is based on what
is a concrete, day-to-day reality for Chicanos. as
well as other Third World people, in this country or
on this campus, for that matter. Ask those black
and Chicano students who have been stopped on
campus and carded for no apparent reason why
they might view the police with apprehension.
Their views are not expressions of racism, they are
the result of direct experience.
De Paul not only attacks the mural as a form of

art and cultural and political expression, he also at
tempts to minimize the seriousness and actuality of
the current situations in South Africa and Central
America as well as U.S. invovement in the two
areas. De Paul said we were attempting to enligh
ten the student body on "the 'atrocities' occurring
in South Africa and the 'crimes' being committed
by Reagan Administration policy in Central
America . . . In using this tone, De Paul
trivializes the political situation in South Africa and
Central America by implying that it is merely an
"alleged" situation. The reality, however, is that

Each year Zapata and the Chicano community face
attacks on the murals . . . And each year, the
community is forced to defend them as important
political and cultural expressions.

the crises in both of these areas of the world are
documented daily and are of legitimate concern to
the international community.
Finally, De Paul attempts to define the
parameters of "legitimate political interaction" for
those who have disagreements with, and seek to in -
fluence. U.S. domestic and foreign policy. In doing
so. De Paul has left out, and in fact negates, those
forms which are most available and have tradition
ally been used by Chicanos and other oppressed
people. These include sit-ins, murals, blow-outs,
walk-outs, strikes, etc.
Contrary to De Paul's confused and naive per

ception of how policy at home and abroad is
changed, we have proven the effectiveness of these
and other forms of struggle in winning our
demands. Can De Paul deny the impact on U.S.
policy of the civil rights and anti-war movements of
the '60s? Closer to home, Casa Zapata, El Centro
and the many of the Chicano students you see on
campus would not be here today if it weren't for the
use of such tactics 10 or 15 years ago.
These gains were not won through having
"brown faces in high places" or through contribu
tions to local politicians. They were won through

the pressures applied by our community.
In closing, we would like to point out that people
like De Paul, who claim we have done him and his
conservative cohorts a favor, have, in reality, done
us a favor. The solidarity among minority groups
has been, and is, growing. This is at least partially
due to the racist and narrow-minded attacks on our
culture, theme houses and communities by in
viduals such as De Paul.
