# Peronism alive in D.C.
## 
### 
Most American liberals predicted that President
Reagan's economic plan, announced in the 1980 election,
could not possibly work. Six years later, they are at a loss
to explain our booming economy and the President's con
sequent enormous popularity. But Reagan's secret is not
new. Juan Peron used it to stay in power in Argentina
from the mid-1940s to 1955.
Today South America is just another part of the Third
World to most Americans, sturggling with a crushing
foreign debt and an ingloriously repressive past. It was not
always so. South America early in this century was the
great frontier which this country had ceased to be. Eager
European immigrants poured into South America, and

the local economies showed impressive signs of develop
ment. The southern cone of that continent was the sit 6 of
exciting literary and cultural ferment. After World War 11,
more than a few Americans thought South America
would surprass Europe as a center of world power and in
fluence. And to everyone, Argentina was the jewel of
South America.
It was not be be. Juan Peron came to power in Argen
tina by opposing the traditional poltical elite. He had a
glamorous actress wife and a populist following start
lingly like that of our current president. Peron's main
constituency were businessmen who did not want to fund
a large government, but he could not afford to alienate
workers who demanded the benefits of a welfare state.
Moreover, Peron was committed to a useless military
build up which enhanced the popularity of his Peronism in
the name of nationalism.
Peron's way out of those dilemmas then is Reagan's
way out today. Peron spent far more than his government
taxed, and he ran up a huge national debt. This financial
stimulus created almost a decade of economic "good
times," which made Peron hugely popular.
Peronist Argentina borrowed most of its money from
abroad. Similarly, the United States in the past five years
has squandered a huge international surplus, and has
become a debtor nation for the first time in 60 years. The
driving force behind the American debt is Reagan's defi

cit. Despite Reagan's promises of balanced budgets, he
quickly tripled the highest annual deficit of any of his
predecessors, and this year, despite the booming eco
nomy, the deficit will be a record $210 billion. Reagan, in
five years, has run up a bigger government debt than his
39 predecessors ran up in 192 years.
Of course, eventually Argentina had to pay up. Peron,
like Reagan, bought present prosperity with future
misery. Most of South America copied Peron, and as a
result, the whole debt-ridden continent slid into the ranks
of the under-developed nations, while much of the world
surged into prosperity in the '60s.
This year, like the last four years, Reagan is running a
deficit that works out to about a $1,000 per person, per
year. We, the young, will be the ones to pay it back. It
seems to be settled Administration policy to loot the
future. Reagan proposes to cut programs, such as the
Women-Infants-Children (WIC) feeding program, which
will save several times their current cost in reduced future
government expenditures â€” health care in the case of the
WIC. From NASA to the National Direct Student Loan,
the concept of investing for the future is entirely absent
from the Reagan Administration. As University President
Donnald Kennedy has noted, we are engaged in a massive
shift of resources in our society from the young to the old.
America has more stable political institutions than did
Argentina, and one assumes we can avoid the slide into
military dictatorship which accompanied and followed

Peron, like Reagan, bought
present prosperity with
future misery.

Peron. Perhaps our economy will prove more resilient as
well, but the point is the economy is being manipulated
for the polticial benefit of the Republican Party, to the
long-term detriment of the country as a whole. Peron
remained popular in Argentina through the '70s, and
only in the past few years have Argentines realized the full
gravity of what he did to them. Reagan has not discovered
a new elixir; his is the tried and true economics of
demogoguery. Those of us under 30, like it or not, will pay
in ways we cannot yet even imagine.
