# Sympathy, grief expressed by all

### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer with wire reports 
Members of the Stanford community and people across
the country reacted with grief and shock yesterday to the
news of the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger and
the death of its seven crew members on the 25th shuttle
mission.
The explosion, which occurred 74 seconds after takeoff
from Cape Canaveral, Fla., was the first in-flight disaster
in 56 American-launched, manned space missions.
Among the crew members was Christa McAuliffe, 37, a
high school social science teacher from New Hampshire
who was the first private citizen selected to fly on the
space shuttle.
The disaster left several Stanford-related shuttle proj
ects in a state of limbo, although members of the commu
nity involved in the projects said their interests were
dwarfed by the loss of life on the flight.
Michael Wiskerchen, director of the Stanford Univer
sity Network Space Telescience Applications Research
(SUNSTAR), was a friend of astronaut Judy Resnik, 36,
who was killed yesterday.
Wiskerchen called the explosion a "sad tragedy," add
ing that "we all knew this was going to happen . . . and it
happened."
NASA is "extremely concerned about safety," Wisker
chen added, although he said NASA will have to do some
"strenuous soul searching" about the program's future.
He said despite the dangers of the shuttle program, he
considers "the risk (of the program) worth taking."
