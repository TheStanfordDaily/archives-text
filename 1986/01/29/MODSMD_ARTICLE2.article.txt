# Sympathy, grief expressed by all

### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer with wire reports 
Members of the Stanford community and people across
the country reacted with grief and shock yesterday to the
news of the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger and
the death of its seven crew members on the 25th shuttle
mission.
The explosion, which occurred 74 seconds after takeoff
from Cape Canaveral, Fla., was the first in-flight disaster
in 56 American-launched, manned space missions.
Among the crew members was Christa McAuliffe, 37, a
high school social science teacher from New Hampshire
who was the first private citizen selected to fly on the
space shuttle.
The disaster left several Stanford-related shuttle proj
ects in a state of limbo, although members of the commu
nity involved in the projects said their interests were
dwarfed by the loss of life on the flight.
Michael Wiskerchen, director of the Stanford Univer
sity Network Space Telescience Applications Research
(SUNSTAR), was a friend of astronaut Judy Resnik, 36,
who was killed yesterday.
Wiskerchen called the explosion a "sad tragedy," add
ing that "we all knew this was going to happen . . . and it
happened."
NASA is "extremely concerned about safety," Wisker
chen added, although he said NASA will have to do some
"strenuous soul searching" about the program's future.
He said despite the dangers of the shuttle program, he
considers "the risk (of the program) worth taking."
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Felix Zajac was
Resnik's Ph.D. adviser while she was studying elec
trical engineering at the University of Maryland.
Zajac was out of town and unavailable for com
ment yesterday.
Holt Ashley, a professor in aeronautics and
astronautics, called yesterday's accident "a very,
very terrible tragedy."
Ashley, an adviser to NASA since 1952, headed
a group of researchers that developed the thermal
protection system for the first shuttle Columbia.
"It is absolutely remarkable" that there haven't
been other accidents, Ashley said, adding that
NASA has been "extremely cautious" in their
launchings.
Space travel is "hazardous . . . you can't expect it
to be perfect on all occasions," Ashley said.
Jeff Morgan, a research associate at the Stanford
Electronics Laboratory, said the Hubble Space
Telescope project he is involved in will probably

"be delayed considerably" by the explosion.
The telescope was originally scheduled to fly on
the space shuttle in August 19N6, Morgan said. It is
"almost certain that (the project) won't happen at
this time," he said, adding that it could be
postponed one to two years.
"At this point in time, [delays] aren't really our
major interest," Morgan said, stressing that he was
more concerned with the death of the crew mem
bers.
The Stanford Alumni Association released a
statement yesterday expressing sorrow over the
tragedy and its intentions to continue its recently
announced plans to sell tickets on the space shuttle
in 1987 at $50,000 a seat.
"With the rest of the world today, our thoughts
are with the families and friends of the astronauts
who died aboard the Challenger this morning. We
have not abandoned our plans to include space
travel among our travel/study offerings when it is
appropriate to do so. The safety of our passsengers
will continue to be, as it always has been, our
foremost concern," the association's release stated.
The explosion captured the attention of the rest
of the country as many students across campus

watched televised reports of the accident through
out the day.
"We mourn the death of seven heroes," said
President Reagan, who postponed until Tuesday
his State of the Union address scheduled for last
night.
The president, in a televised statement delivered
from the Oval Office, reaffirmed his commitment
to the shuttle program.
"We will continue our quest in space. There will
be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and,
yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers
in space," Reagan said.
The exact cause of the explosion was not given
by NASA officials, although slow-motion televi
sion footage appeared to show an initial explosion
in one of two peel-away boosters, igniting the
shuttle's external gas tank.
The explosion occured as astronauts were begin
ning to throttle their engines up to maximum
thrust. Before the explosion, the engines had run at
the 60 percent level for 30 seconds in order to
reduce the forces of gravity during the liftoff.
Challenger, a $1.2 billion spacecraft and one of
four NASA ships to fly, was on its 10th flight.

(SUNSTAR), was a friend of astronaut Judy Resnik, 36,
who was killed yesterday.
Wiskerchen called the explosion a "sad tragedy," add
ing that "we all knew this was going to happen . . . and it
happened."
NASA is "extremely concerned about safety," Wisker
chen added, although he said NASA will have to do some
"strenuous soul searching" about the program's future.
He said despite the dangers of the shuttle program, he
considers "the risk (of the program) worth taking."
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Felix Zajac was
Resnik's Ph.D. adviser while she was studying elec
trical engineering at the University of Maryland.
Zajac was out of town and unavailable for com
ment yesterday.
Holt Ashley, a professor in aeronautics and
astronautics, called yesterday's accident "a very,
very terrible tragedy."
Ashley, an adviser to NASA since 1952, headed
a group of researchers that developed the thermal
protection system for the first shuttle Columbia.
"It is absolutely remarkable" that there haven't
been other accidents, Ashley said, adding that
NASA has been "extremely cautious" in their
launchings.
Space travel is "hazardous . . . you can't expect it
to be perfect on all occasions," Ashley said.
Jeff Morgan, a research associate at the Stanford
Electronics Laboratory, said the Hubble Space
Telescope project he is involved in will probably

"be delayed considerably" by the explosion.
The telescope was originally scheduled to fly on
the space shuttle in August 19N6, Morgan said. It is
"almost certain that (the project) won't happen at
this time," he said, adding that it could be
postponed one to two years.
"At this point in time, [delays] aren't really our
major interest," Morgan said, stressing that he was
more concerned with the death of the crew mem
bers.
The Stanford Alumni Association released a
statement yesterday expressing sorrow over the
tragedy and its intentions to continue its recently
announced plans to sell tickets on the space shuttle
in 1987 at $50,000 a seat.
"With the rest of the world today, our thoughts
are with the families and friends of the astronauts
who died aboard the Challenger this morning. We
have not abandoned our plans to include space
travel among our travel/study offerings when it is
appropriate to do so. The safety of our passsengers
will continue to be, as it always has been, our
foremost concern," the association's release stated.
The explosion captured the attention of the rest
of the country as many students across campus

watched televised reports of the accident through
out the day.
"We mourn the death of seven heroes," said
President Reagan, who postponed until Tuesday
his State of the Union address scheduled for last
night.
The president, in a televised statement delivered
from the Oval Office, reaffirmed his commitment
to the shuttle program.
"We will continue our quest in space. There will
be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and,
yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers
in space," Reagan said.
The exact cause of the explosion was not given
by NASA officials, although slow-motion televi
sion footage appeared to show an initial explosion
in one of two peel-away boosters, igniting the
shuttle's external gas tank.
The explosion occured as astronauts were begin
ning to throttle their engines up to maximum
thrust. Before the explosion, the engines had run at
the 60 percent level for 30 seconds in order to
reduce the forces of gravity during the liftoff.
Challenger, a $1.2 billion spacecraft and one of
four NASA ships to fly, was on its 10th flight.
