# Hey, like,4 Paly Girls' are people, too
## 
### SCOTT ROTH Staff writer 
You've seen them. You've no
doubt heard of them. You may have
even talked to one. Just when you
thought it was safe to go back to par
ties, the Peninsula's equivalent of the
Valley Girl appears — the Paly Girl.
Paly girls, juniors and seniors from
Palo Alto High School, have become
somewhat of a fixture on campus.
They can be found working at the
Bookstore, the Track House and
Tressider. At some fraternities, they
have become as commonplace as
warm beer.
This fall, Paly girl s were forever
immortalized when they appeared in
"Gaieties." They were portrayed as
giggling children wearing ultra-chic
designer outfits and spouting such
phrases as, "Omigod."
The Paly Girls in "Gaeties" were,
admittedly, stereotypical. But are any
of these stereotypes really true?
One must first ask what the
stereotypical Paly Girl looks like.
Generally, her clothes have to be
new, loose-fitting and brightly
colored. Stirrup pants, long under
wear, paisley shirts and long coats are
the norm. At least 20 black rubber
bracelets, a la Madonna, are dc
rifiueur. The hair must be layered,
and mousse should be amply applied.
How does the stereotypical Paly
Girl act?
The key word here is "hyper
kinetic." Speech should be rapid and
ceaseless. Hands should constantly
accentuate whatever is being sajd.
She should speak loudly and laugh
among her friends, but remain some
what subdued around the "guys." She
should have a wine cooler in hand
(Bartles and Jaymes is preferred) and
carry a purse.
How much of this stereotype is

true? That varies with who you talk
to.
Senior Megan Swezey attended
Paly before coming to Stanford and
works with several local high school
girls at the Bookstore. Swezey had a
different view of the Paly students
here on campus.
"First off, I think that people
should refer to them as women," she
said. "After all, they are mostly 17
and 18 years old. Saying that they're
girls just isn't fair. 1 think Paly gets a
bum rap just because it's close by.
There are a lot of women from Gunn
and other places around here.
"As far as the stereotypes go, well,
1 can't say that it (the "Paly Girl"
stereotype) is completely true. There
are plenty of people at Paly who don't
fit it. There are also women here who
do."
High school girls are very
noticeable at Stanford parties. Most
people here agreed that they come
because the Palo Alto area offers
little to do on weekends.
Some students, perhaps unsurpris
ingly, do not welcome Paly Girls on

campus. Jerry Masters, a fifth-year
senior, thought that they pose a haz
ard to fraternities. "It has been our
policy at parties to let only Stanford
students in. If we see someone that
doesn't look like he or she belongs,
we ask them to leave."
Masters explained that high school
students could get the house in trou
ble.
"If someone were to get drunk at a
party and have an accident, not only
could we but the University could be
held liable," he noted. "This is why
we try to police ourselves."
Others find the high school women
less of a problem. Junior Mike Tuchin
said he finds them "quite amusing to
talk to at parties."
Still others have no opinion at all.
"I don't comment about Paly girls,"
senior Curt Cook commented.
Swezey finds it amusing to run into
the Paly women.
"A lot of these people I tutored
when I was in high school," she said.
"I watched them grow up, and now I
think it's funny to watch them at par
ties "

Swezey echoed another obvious
concern about the young women who
come to parties. Many, she feels, are
abused.
"Most women come to parties
thinking that they're going to meet an
exciting older college guy. Most of
the guys 1 see them talking to are
drunk and are hitting on them. I fear
that they will get sexually abused by
insincere guys. It's for this reason that
1 dislike having the girls around,"
Swezey said.
With so much being said about
these Paly High women, how do they
feel about it?
Christina Peck is a senior at Paly
High School. She works in the
Bookstore as a cashier at the candy
counter.
Peck is definitely not a stereotype.
For starters, she dresses quite con
servatively. Dressed in jeans and a t
shirt. Peck seems somewhat shy and
reserved in her speech. She doesn't
carry a purse or wine cooler either.
Peck is one of five high school girls
who work at the Bookstore, two of
whorri nttCpd "••I*' She hcf \vorb

at the Bookstore because it is enjoy
able and convenient.
"The reason I got a job at the
Bookstore is the job itself. I like the
hours, its close to home and con
vienient, and I like the people."
She emphasized the fact that she
doesn't go to many parties. If she
does, it is "just to dance."
Peck said people from the local
area go to Stanford parties because
there is little to do in Palo Alto, ex
plaining that the chance to meet new
people and to go to a big party was
exciting.
"Most girls will go to the parties in
hopes to find an older guy, but the
fact that there is ample free alcohol
doesn't hurt, either," Peck said.
On the other side of this stereotypi
cal fence is "Heather," who agreed to
an interview provided her last name
was not mentioned. Appearing at a
Stanford party. Heather could easily
be mistaken for another Stanford stu
dent, but when she said she lived "in
Paloma in Wilbur," she gave herself
away.

Heather, indeed, goes to Paly. She
looks it, too. She sports the übiqui
tous black stirrup pants, baggy coat
and wears her hair in a layered, frizzy
mess.
She said women from local high
schools come to parties for a change
of pace.
"There are only so many movies
that you can see," she noted. "Going
to the New Varsity or a school dance
gets old real quick. Here we can see
new people, go dance and have fun."
Heather did not have a wine
cooler. Instead she was chugging a
vodka Collins. She said the alcohol is
one reason she and her friends come.
"Of course the fact that there are
free drinks makes coming more fun. 1
don't like to drink a lot or get drunk,
though," Heather explained.
But if the Inter-Fraternity Coun
cil's policy only allows Stanford stu
dents into on-campus parties, how
did she get in?
It was a combination of things, she
explained rapidly with enough hand
gestures to wipe out the entire lly
population of Santa Clara County.
"Well, you just have to wait "til, ya
know, there's a big crowd going in. If
that doesn't work, you just smile at
the pledges, and they should let you
in. They always like more girls
around."
She admitted, though, that "there
are certain parties where you just
can't get in."
Heather said she personally has not
dated any Stanford guys, but if the
opportunity presents itself....
"Oh sure. We always look. A lot of
the time my friends do meet a guy. If
a cute, nice guy were to ask me out, I
think I probably would say 'yes.'
"In fact, we usually try to go to the
frat parties. We can find out when
they are since they're every Wednes
day and Thursday. There are also
more guys and drinks there."
