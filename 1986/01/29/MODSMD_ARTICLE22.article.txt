## Type A personality linked to childhood New light shed on aggressive people 
### VERONICA SHIM 
Type A behavior — a symptom fre
quently associated with heart disease
patients and often described as
"hostile," "aggressive" and
"competitive" — seems to originate
in childhood, according to Carl
Thoresen, a professor of education
and psychology at Stanford.
According to the studies, Type A
individuals are "aggressively involved
in a chronic, incessant struggle to
achieve more and more in less and
less time, and if required to do so,
against the opposing efforts of other
things or other persons."

Overall, the Type
As were more
anxious and in
tense ...

However, adults are not the only
ones who are affected by this harmful
pattern, said Thoresen. Many
children, too, display some of these
same Type A behaviors.
Thoresen, a fellow at the Center
for Advanced Studies in the Behav
ioral Sciences, and his Stanford as
sociates — Jean Grubb Eagleston,
Kathy Kirmil-Gray, Lorchen Heft,
Bruce Arrow and Paul Bracke —
began their research on child stress in
1981 by examining over 750 fifth,
seventh and ninth grade children
from 19 different schools in San
Francisco. Their discoveries were re
ported at the American Psychological
Association's annual meeting in Los
Angeles in August, 1985.
Type A personalities are con
trasted by Type B individuals, who
generally are more relaxed, less com
petetive and less tense than Type As.
To screen the children, personal in
terviews, mailings, questionaires
and a newsletter were employed.
Type A children did not show any dif

ferent physical signs than those
shown by Type B peers. Signs of
stress such as sleep disturbance and
muscle tension, however, were more
common in Type A children.
These symptoms are also shared by
adult Type A subjects. Headaches,

sore throats and illnesses of all kinds
were more common in the Type A
children than in the Type B kids.
Nevertheless, there was no difference
in school attendance.
High levels of anxiety or depres
sion, which aren't found among adult

Type As, were felt by a large number
of Type A children. Insecurity was
also common. Type As are constantly
worried about proving their worth,
even more than has been observed in
adult Type As, Kirmil-Gray said.
The children were asked, for exam

pie, "whether they were suspicious of
other people and their motives; how
mad they got if someone cut in front
of them in line .... and did they
make sarcastic comments, keep it all
inside, or yell and scream?" It was
found that Type A children tend to
get angrier more often and for longer
periods of time, but they were more
likely to keep their anger to them
selves.
The development of plaque in the
coronary arteries and deterioration of
the cardiovascular system can be in
stigated by this suppressed anger.
Overall, the Type As were more anx
ious and intense, had lower self
esteem and reported more up and
down emotions than did the Type Bs.
To study the influence of parents
on the Type A children's develop
ment, Bracke studied the parents of
the youngest children in the group,
the fifth graders. Questionnaires and
structured interviews on chronic
stress were used, as well as lab studies
in which the children were given two
specific tasks while their parents were
invited to participate.
Bracke discovered that Type A
boys in the study were more likely to
have Type A fathers, even though it
was not the case for Type A girls. Al
though parents of Type A children
did not expect more from their
children, the children themselves
believed that their parents expected
the very best.
While parents of Type A children
were more demanding and competi
tive, the parents of Type B children
gave more autonomy to their
children. Interestingly, the Type A
children did not do better on the
"Overall, the project revealed that
high Type A kids appear to be strug
gling a lot more than (their) peers,"
Thoresen said. "They push harder,
but, contrary to popular assumptions,
there is no evidence whatsoever that
they do any better in school ..."
He also commented that these fin
dings should be reassuring to parents,
for many parents have misconcep
tions that their children have to be
hard-driving to succeed and they
need to constantly push their
children. "(The) parents' role should
be to give their children love, accep
tance and social support. ..."
Thoresen said.
