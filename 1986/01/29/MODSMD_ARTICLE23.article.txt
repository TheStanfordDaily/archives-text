# Crystals created anew
## 
### 
New man-made crystals,
never before seen in nature, are
being created and studied at a
new laboratory at Stanford
using an advanced technique
for growing near-perfect crys
tals called molecular beam
epitaxy (MBE).
These crystals may be the
next generation of
microelectronic devices that
companies will be trying to
manufacture 10 to 15 years
from now, according to James
Harris, Stanford professor of
electrical engineering and
director of the new solid-state
lab that is affilliated with Stan
ford's Center for Integrated
Systems and devoted to MBE
research.
By growing crystals a single
atomic layer at a time, MBE
allows scientists to create
"artificial" crystals with ex
tremely small dimensions. Con
sequently, the electrons exhibit
quantum mechanical properties
that scientists can now explore,
Harris said.
Quantum theory explains the
behavior of matter at the
molecular and atomic levels.
Before advanced MBE tech
nologies were developed, these
properties had only been hy
pothesized, Harris explained.
Their demonstration "is why it
is an extremely exciting field
right now," he added.
MBE was originally
developed for growing and
studying gallium arsenide, a
semiconductor similar to
silicon.
The MBE techniques for
studying gallium arsenide have
evolved to encompass the new
quantum mechanical structures
that are now at "the real fore
front of semiconductor re
search," Harris said.
With MBE, a substrate wafer
whose atoms form a regular
patterned array is used to in
itiate the growth of the syn
thetic crystals.
