# Scientists bone up on analyzers' potential
## Instrument could monitor disorders here and in space 
### DAVID LIPPEAT Editorial staff 
A Stanford engineer and a NASA
physiologist have collaborated to
design a bone analyzer that they hope
will help doctors deal not only with
bone diseases and disorders here on
earth, but in space as well.
This prototype analyzer promises
to give the first non-invasive, quan
titative measures of bone health.
Prolonged bed rest and chronic

The point of using the analyzer is to
measure the functional properties of
bone.

limb pain can lead to little or no use
of the limbs. Similarly, the lack of
gravity in space can leave bones with
nothing to work against. These condi
tions, as well as a disorder in women
known as osteoporosis, can lead to
the loss of bone matter in the limbs.
And it is with these types of disorders
that the bone analyzer promises to of
fer the most help.
According to Dr. Charles Steele of
Stanford, co-inventor of the
analyzer, bones stop lengthening by
adolescence, but cells within bone

tissue are constantly breaking down
and re-assembling the mineral matrix
of the skeleton.
Regular activity and usage of the
limbs prompts hormones to keep the
rate of rebuilding as high as the rate
of dismantling, Steele said. When a
person is kept up in space, or in bed,
there is no load on the bones.
Osteoporosis also involves a faster
breakdown than regrowth rate. This
can cause brittle bones and what is
known as 'dowager's hump' in a large

number of women past menopause.
The bone analyzer should be able
to detect these harmful bone losses
earlier than other methods such as X
rays or photon absorption, because it
directly tests the strength of bones,
Steele explained.
Dr. Donald Young, a NASA
physiologist at the Ames Research
Center in Mountain View, said in an
interview that the point of using the
analyzer is to "measure the functional
properties of bone — how stiff
(strong) the bone is."

Analysis begins when a patient's
limb is positioned in front of the
analyzer, which is mounted on a drill
press stand. A fingertip-sized probe
then presses and vibrates against the
long bone of the forearm or leg.

causing the bone to vibrate in
response. This vibration is channeled
by a force transducer and ac
celerometer into a microprocessor
system.
A mathematical algorithm then

takes the force and acceleration ap
plied to the bone into account and
measures the displacement and fre
quency of vibration of the bone. "It's
like measuring the force it takes to
pull a spring," Young said.
The data thus obtained translates
into stiffness or strength. From this
result, a quantitative measure of bone
loss can be determined, which is
much more useful than the
generalized information obtainable
through conventional methods.
At present, the analyzer can only
measure long bones in the body be
cause they have little skin and fat
over them and because they roughly
conform to the laws of engineering
beam theory.
Young said that NASA has been
interested in bone loss in space for
the last eight to 10. Past American
astronauts have experienced a 9 per
cent bone loss after an 84-day stay in

space, he added. This could cause
fractures. With all of the current talk
about space stations, which would in
volve much longer stays in space, the
bone analyzer could become an im
portant tool for the maintenance of
astronauts' health.
In the past few years there has been
an increase in more earthbound,
clinical interest in an analyzer as its
application to bone measurements in
bedridden and diseased patients has
become apparent. This is where Stan
ford, and Steele, stepped in. Along
with him came Dr. Donald Nagel and
Dr. David Schurman, both of the or
thopedics department at Stanford.
They have been involved in the proj
ect for some time.
Although more clinical research
needs to be done on the analyzer, Dr.
Young concluded that the device
could be out on the market "within
two or three years."

The data thus obtained translates
into stiffness or strength. From this
result, a quantitative measure of bone
loss can be determined, which is
much more useful than the
generalized information obtainable
through conventional methods.
At present, the analyzer can only
measure long bones in the body be
cause they have little skin and fat
over them and because they roughly
conform to the laws of engineering
beam theory.
Young said that NASA has been
interested in bone loss in space for
the last eight to 10. Past American
astronauts have experienced a 9 per
cent bone loss after an 84-day stay in

space, he added. This could cause
fractures. With all of the current talk
about space stations, which would in
volve much longer stays in space, the
bone analyzer could become an im
portant tool for the maintenance of
astronauts' health.
In the past few years there has been
an increase in more earthbound,
clinical interest in an analyzer as its
application to bone measurements in
bedridden and diseased patients has
become apparent. This is where Stan
ford, and Steele, stepped in. Along
with him came Dr. Donald Nagel and
Dr. David Schurman, both of the or
thopedics department at Stanford.
They have been involved in the proj
ect for some time.
Although more clinical research
needs to be done on the analyzer, Dr.
Young concluded that the device
could be out on the market "within
two or three years."

bone disorders such as fractures and osteoporosis.
