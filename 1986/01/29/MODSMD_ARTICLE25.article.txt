## UOP to challenge unbeaten batsmen

might learn something about his ballclub today
as Stanford hosts the University of the Pacific at
Sunken Diamond at 2 p.m. Then again, may
not.
Sure, it may rain and the game could be
called. But even if the weather obliges and the
teams get in their nine innings, there's not much
that can be proven by playing a non-conference
team like UOP. Last year the Tigers posted only
16 wins in 52 games.
UOP simply plays a different brand of
baseball than Stanford. Hush now, but Tiger
baseball could be called "bush league."
Whether Stanford drubs the Tigers, which is
likely, or whether the teams play a tight game,
as they did in last year's 5-4, 10-inning Stanford
win, it'll be a comparison of apples with
oranges.
Just how much would it really mean if today's
starter for Stanford, Kevin Kunkel, throttles the
Tigers? After all, UOP's top returning hitters
are third baseman Vince Brigman, who leads
the team with his unlofty .249 clip, and center
fielder Bill Waggoner, who is not far behind at
.237.
"I really don't have much of a feel for it (his
team)," Marquess said. "It'll take two or three
weeks before we really know something. ... I
don't expect to learn that much today."
And what if it's a close game or UOP, by
mini-miracle, wins? Well, in last year's game at
Stockton, Stanford was saved only by a Rick
Lundblade lOth-inning homerun. And after
that near debacle, the Cardinal went on to place
fifth in the country after holding the No. 1
ranking going into the College World Series. So

much for drawing conclusions from games with
UOP.
But anyway, the game must go on.
It turns out that the Tigers are a lot like San
Jose State, a team Stanford beat twice last
weekend. "They're the caliber of San Jose
State," Marquess said. "Maybe they have better
pitching, but I really don't know much about
them."
The Tigers haven't named a starting pitcher,
but because this will be their opening game and
because a win over Stanford could very well
make their year, UOP will likely throw its
ace, Mike Pitz. Pitz redshirted last year but re
corded 104 strikeouts as a freshman in 1984.
Kunkel gets Marquess' nod and a chance to
redeem himself. In Friday's game in San Jose,
Kunkel finished up for Stanford starter and win
ner Jack McDowell. Through three innings of
work, he surrendered four runs on four hits and
three walks. Two of those hits were long
doubles.
"He didn't pitch well," Marquess said. "But
he was one of our best pitchers in the fall. If he
has another bad outing, then we might be con
cerned."
And that's the significance of today's game. If
Kunkel pitches well, it won't mean much â€” he
should against a UOP-type team. But if he's
knocked around, then Marquess' pitching staff
could be in trouble. After McDowell, who is
already being touted as an All-America candi
date, there are a lot of question marks.
One of those is Rob Wassenaar, who, like
Kunkel, was hit hard by the Spartans. Marquess
said Wasenaar, Stanford's second starter, would
pitch today. His performance could also tell
much about Stanford's starting rotation.

any luck against University of the Pacific, a team that won
only 16 of 52 games last year.

Stanford all-America candidate John Ramos gets a break
here, but it's unlikely the heavily-favored Cardinal will need
Card notes
Even at this early stage of the
season, there are already signs that
this year's team is very different from
last year's. During the two weekend
games with San Jose, the Cardinal
stole eight bases and hit only one
homerun. "Most definitely we'll run
more," Marquess said. "It's a combi
nation of less power and more team
speed."
The battle for the starting shortstop
spot rages on. "(David) Esquer didn't
do anything to hurt himself over the
weekend," Marquess said of the
junior who started both SJSU games.
"But Kenny (Green) came in the
game Saturday and made some great
plays. The position won't be decided
for at least a month."
Marquess is happy with the play of
his new leadoff man, left fielder Walt
Harris. Harris got five hits in nine
trips to the plate, scored four runs
and stole a pair of bases. "He was a
bright spot for us offensively,"
Marquess said.
