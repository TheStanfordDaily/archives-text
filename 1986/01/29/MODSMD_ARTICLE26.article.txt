## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
After knocking itself out of title contention with mediocre play in the first
two rounds, the Stanford men's golf team battled back yesterday to take third
place at the UC-Santa Barbara Tournament in Santa Barbara.
The 16th-ranked Cardinal shot 381, the second lowest team score in the
third round, to vault from fifth place to third over Cal State-Dominguez Hills
and Oregon State. Stanford's team score of 1,141 left it far behind the leaders,
however.
Fresno State outdueled top-ranked USC in a close finish to win the event,
besting the Trojans by two strokes, 1,111 to 1,113. Fresno State shot 379 to
the Trojans' 382 in the final round to take the crown.
Long Beach State rose from sixth place to fourth, edging OSU by a stroke
(1,147 to 1,148). Dominguez Hills toppled from third place to sixth by shoot
ing 397 yesterday, but they still squeaked by New Mexico State by a shot.
San Jose State, California and UCSB were all within two strokes of each
other in rounding out the top ten.
The final standings were a case of individuals taking charge for their teams.
Fresno State's Tim Loustalot shot a 73, just one over par, to capture top spot
on the individual charts, while USC's Sam Randolph, former U.S. Amateur
champion and the leader after two rounds, struggled to a 79 and fell into a tie
for fifth.
Aiding his own team's cause, Stanford's Carl Wagner complemented his
first-round 71 Monday with a 73 yesterday, climbing from a seventh-place tie
after two rounds to a second-place tie with Fresno State's Terrence Mitchell.
Jim Erikson gave Fresno State three of the tournament's top four players by
finishing at 220. Three Trojans, Mike Blewett, Brian Henninger and Randolph
were knotted together at 221.
Wagner was not alone in leading Stanford's comeback. Don Walsworth shot
a 74 yesterday to end up at 224. Roger Miraglia capped a fine first intercol
legiate start by stroking a 75, concluding the tourney at 229.
Rich Marik's 233, Brad Geer's 238 and Casey Pittock's 241 completed
Stanford's scoring.
The squad travels today to Tucson, where the Cardinal will begin play to
morrow in the 54-hole Conquistador Intercollegiate, sponsored by Arizona.
Though the team seemed to be sluggish Monday coming back after a three
month layoff, Stanford will have to be back on the right track to meet the chal
lenge of playing six rounds in six days.
