# Underdog St. Mary's on tap for Stanford spikers
## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball
team will try to make it two league
wins in a row against nationally
ranked squads when it takes on
20th-ranked St. Mary's tonight in
Moraga at 7:30 p.m. The Cardinal
easily downed No. 13 Cal-State
Northridge 15-7, 16-14, 15-2 Mon
day night for the team's first win.
And last night at Moraga, the
Northridge squad defeated the
Gaels 15-9, 15-6, 15-8 to improve
its record to 1-1. St. Mary's is now
0-1 in California Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association (CIVA)
play and 1-3 overall after non
conference losses to UC-San Diego
and Sacramento State. The Gaels'
lone win came against Santa Clara.
Senior middle blocker John Buf
fington had eight kills for
Northridge, and all of the outside
hitters had hitting percentages over
.400. Senior Chuck English, an all
conference outside hitter who
missed the Stanford match, played
in just one game for Northridge and
had no kills.
St. Mary's was also without the
services of two of its top players,
however, as both Paul Beardon and
Kevin Maguire sat out the match.
Neither will see action against Stan
ford. For the Gaels, David Ott had
nine kills and Chris Cochran and
Rick Geweche each had six.
St. Mary's Volleyball Coach
Eugene Glazenberg, a former Sov
iet national player and coach, said
of his team, "They didn't play very
well. We didn't have our best hit
ters — our first line-up wasn't on
the court."
This is the first year in the CIVA
for the Gaels and the first time they
have been able to offer scholarships
to recruits because volleyball at St.
Mary's has been a club sport in the
past. The key word for the squad is
inexperience.
"We have some good players,'"
said Glazenberg, "but I don't think
we can have really good results this
year. We don't have enough experi
ence. Next year we hope to finish in
the middle of the league, but this
year we'll probably be near the bot
tom."
Glazenberg brings new expertise
to the St. Mary's program,
however, and he already has one
recruiting class to his credit. Fresh
man setter Greg Hurd from
Hacienda Heights is one, in partic
ular, who stands out.
"Since this is St. Mary's first year
in the league, we don't know much
about them" Stanford Volleyball
Coach Don Shaw said. "I know
before when we've played them
they were so out of control that we
worried about our players' safety,
but after one year with their new
coach, there is a huge difference.
He has made them into a techni
cally sound volleyball team.
"St. Mary's is not really strong,
but they have better athletes and
it's tough to know what to expect.

We can't take then too lightly. It's a
league game, and we have to treat it
like a league game," Shaw added.
Last year, the Cardinal faced the
Gaels once and defeated them in
three straight games. Stanford will
again be relying on the talents of
senior outside hitter Chris Braun,
who is leading the team in kills with
34, and senior All-CIVA and Ail-
American Jon Root, who is second
with 32. Sophomore Scott Fortune
has 29.
"We'll try and see what we can
do against Stanford," Glazenberg
said. "We know it is a strong team
and in good condition. We need
good blocking and good serving.
We have to break down their pass
ing game."
Despite the Gaels' youth, the
squad is ranked 20th in the nation.
Perhaps this is just another indica

tion of how dominant CIVA teams
are in NCAA volleyball. Neverthe
less, Stanford cannot afford to let
down in tonight's match. Its unde
feated record and a fifth-place spot
in the polls are at stake.
The top ten teams in the nation,
according to the latest NCAA
coaches poll, are:. No. 1, Pep
perdine; No. 2, UCLA; No. 3,
USC; No. 4, UC-Santa Barbara;
No. 5, Stanford tied with Hawaii;
No. 7. George Mason; No. 8, Penn
State; No. 9, Cal State-Long
Beach; No. 10, Ball State.
The second ten are, in order: San
Diego State, Ohio State, Cal-State
Northridge, East Stroudsburg State
(yes. East Stroudsburg State), In
diana. Purdue, Loyola Marymount,
UC-San Diego, Navy and St.
Marv's.

Stanford will attempt to set up its third win of the year in Moraga
against St. Mary's. The Gaels are 1-3 and ranked 20th in the nation
while the Cardinal is tied for fifth nationally with Hawaii. Neverthe
less, "We can't take them too lightly," Stanford Volleyball Coach

ranked squads when it takes on
20th-ranked St. Mary's tonight in
Moraga at 7:30 p.m. The Cardinal
easily downed No. 13 Cal-State
Northridge 15-7, 16-14, 15-2 Mon
day night for the team's first win.
And last night at Moraga, the
Northridge squad defeated the
Gaels 15-9, 15-6, 15-8 to improve
its record to 1-1. St. Mary's is now
0-1 in California Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association (CIVA)
play and 1-3 overall after non
conference losses to UC-San Diego
and Sacramento State. The Gaels'
lone win came against Santa Clara.
Senior middle blocker John Buf
fington had eight kills for
Northridge, and all of the outside
hitters had hitting percentages over
.400. Senior Chuck English, an all
conference outside hitter who
missed the Stanford match, played
in just one game for Northridge and
had no kills.
St. Mary's was also without the
services of two of its top players,
however, as both Paul Beardon and
Kevin Maguire sat out the match.
Neither will see action against Stan
ford. For the Gaels, David Ott had
nine kills and Chris Cochran and
Rick Geweche each had six.
St. Mary's Volleyball Coach
Eugene Glazenberg, a former Sov
iet national player and coach, said
of his team, "They didn't play very
well. We didn't have our best hit
ters — our first line-up wasn't on
the court."
This is the first year in the CIVA
for the Gaels and the first time they
have been able to offer scholarships
to recruits because volleyball at St.
Mary's has been a club sport in the
past. The key word for the squad is
inexperience.
"We have some good players,'"
said Glazenberg, "but I don't think
we can have really good results this
year. We don't have enough experi
ence. Next year we hope to finish in
the middle of the league, but this
year we'll probably be near the bot
tom."
Glazenberg brings new expertise
to the St. Mary's program,
however, and he already has one
recruiting class to his credit. Fresh
man setter Greg Hurd from
Hacienda Heights is one, in partic
ular, who stands out.
"Since this is St. Mary's first year
in the league, we don't know much
about them" Stanford Volleyball
Coach Don Shaw said. "I know
before when we've played them
they were so out of control that we
worried about our players' safety,
but after one year with their new
coach, there is a huge difference.
He has made them into a techni
cally sound volleyball team.
"St. Mary's is not really strong,
but they have better athletes and
it's tough to know what to expect.

We can't take then too lightly. It's a
league game, and we have to treat it
like a league game," Shaw added.
Last year, the Cardinal faced the
Gaels once and defeated them in
three straight games. Stanford will
again be relying on the talents of
senior outside hitter Chris Braun,
who is leading the team in kills with
34, and senior All-CIVA and Ail-
American Jon Root, who is second
with 32. Sophomore Scott Fortune
has 29.
"We'll try and see what we can
do against Stanford," Glazenberg
said. "We know it is a strong team
and in good condition. We need
good blocking and good serving.
We have to break down their pass
ing game."
Despite the Gaels' youth, the
squad is ranked 20th in the nation.
Perhaps this is just another indica

tion of how dominant CIVA teams
are in NCAA volleyball. Neverthe
less, Stanford cannot afford to let
down in tonight's match. Its unde
feated record and a fifth-place spot
in the polls are at stake.
The top ten teams in the nation,
according to the latest NCAA
coaches poll, are:. No. 1, Pep
perdine; No. 2, UCLA; No. 3,
USC; No. 4, UC-Santa Barbara;
No. 5, Stanford tied with Hawaii;
No. 7. George Mason; No. 8, Penn
State; No. 9, Cal State-Long
Beach; No. 10, Ball State.
The second ten are, in order: San
Diego State, Ohio State, Cal-State
Northridge, East Stroudsburg State
(yes. East Stroudsburg State), In
diana. Purdue, Loyola Marymount,
UC-San Diego, Navy and St.
Marv's.

Stanford will attempt to set up its third win of the year in Moraga
against St. Mary's. The Gaels are 1-3 and ranked 20th in the nation
while the Cardinal is tied for fifth nationally with Hawaii. Neverthe
less, "We can't take them too lightly," Stanford Volleyball Coach
Don Shaw said.
The Stanford men's volleyball
team will try to make it two league
