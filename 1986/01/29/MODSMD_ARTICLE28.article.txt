# Cardinal falters in tourney
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
The nation's three top women's
golf teams competed this week in the
Oklahoma State Intercollegiate in
Guadalajara, Mexico, and the results
were nearly predictable.
Top-ranked Tulsa finished first.
Second-ranked Florida finished
second.
Third-ranked Stanford finished â€”
in a tie for 12th.
Despite Kathleen McCarthy's
strong play in yesterday's final round,
the Cardinal could not salvage any
thing from the tournament as they
ended up deadlocked with the Uni
versity of Mexico with a 54-hole total
of 931.
Tulsa, trailing Florida in third place
by nine strokes going into the final 18
holes, shot 282 as a team to capture
the tournament by a six-stroke mar
gin over the Gators.
Georgia, also playing strongly in
the final round, took third place with
a team score of 893, while Southern
Methodist fell from second to fourth,
finishing at 901.

after the second round) divided fifth
place between them at 221.

impressive 70 yesterday, but it only
brought her up to a tournament total
of 225. The rest of her Cardinal
teammates finished far behind her.
Kathy Kostas shot a 78 and Clare
