# Ryan shuffles into Philly

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Philadelphia Eagles owner
Norman Braman confirmed early this morning that
Chicago Bears defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan signed
a contract yesterday to become head coach of the Eagles.
"I can confirm that we've signed Ryan," Braman said
when reached by phone at his Miami home early today.
Eagles General Manager Harry Gamble said lengthy
negotiations yesterday ended with Ryan's signing a five
year contract. The signing came two days after the Bears
won the National Football League title with a 46-10 vic
tory over the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl.
Bears spokesman Bryan Harlan said Ryan had two
seasons to go on his current contract with the Bears. He
would not reveal how much the defensive coach was being
paid.
"Buddy had an escape clause in his contract which
allowed him to break the agreement if he was offered a
head coaching job," said Harlan, who added that Bears
president Mike McCaskey did not try to talk Ryan into
staying.
"It's pretty tough to deprive a man of his career ad
vancement," said Harlan.
Ryan, who will be 52 on Feb. 17, has been with the
Bears for eight years as defensive coordinator. In that
time, Chicago has ranked in the NFL's top 10 defensively
six times.
Asked after the Super Bowl whether he was ready for a
head coaching job, he said, "I've been ready for 20
years."
Saints name Mora
NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The New Orleans Saints
plucked Jim Mora from the ranks of the United States

Football League yesterday and gave him the task that six
other coaches have failed to do in 19 years: win with the
hapless National Football League team.
"In Jim Mora, we have a man who has won and knows
what it takes to have a winner," Saints owner Tom Ben
son said. "He's won everywhere he's been. He's also the
kind of person we need for our team, our fans and our
city."
Mora, 49, replaces Wade Phillips, who had a 1-3 record
after his father, Bum, resigned in late November with the
team at 4-8.
The 5-11 finish was the Saints' second-worst in Phillips'
five seasons at New Orleans, which never has had a win
ning season since the franchise was formed in 1967.
The Saints fired Wade Phillips and most of his staff Jan
22.
Excluding Wade Phillips and three other interim ap
pointments, Mora becomes the seventh head coach hired
by the Saints.
Like Bum Phillips before him. Mora brings a winner's
credentials to New Orleans. He coached the USFL's Stars
to 52 victories over three years, including consecutive
league championship victories the past two seasons, first
at Philadelphia, then at Baltimore.
Mora's contract with the Stars expired Jan. 17, and the
speculation was that he would become head coach for the
NFL's Philadelphia Eagles. When that deal fell through,
Mora was reported to be headed for New Orleans.
That report was further fueled by disclosures that Mora
had been interviewed by Benson Jan. 13 and by General
Manager Jim Finks Jan. 21.
Finks said Mora's contract was for four years — "and
that's one more year than I have."
