## $25 million in major cutbacks to be made by April 1 
### ALLISON HARTWELL Editorial staff 
Stanford Hospital officials, responding to shorter
hospital stays and a declining demand for in-patient
care, yesterday announced they will make $25 mil
lion in cutbacks by April 1.
The cuts will be made in both personnel and pro
grams, according to Hospital Deputy Director
William Arnold.
"We don't have specific areas targeted right
now," Arnold said, adding that the hospital will
conduct a "detailed assessment" of all departments
through the month of February.
The cutbacks will not be made in areas affecting
patient care, he said.
According to Arnold, the hospital will take a
"collaborative approach" to the cutbacks, incorpo

rating input from all departments. Middle manage
ment will be heavily involved in making layoff deci
sions, he said.
In the last four years, the average length of stay
at Stanford Hospital dropped from 6.8 to 6.3 days,
and patient days — the total number of days spent
in the hospital by all the hospital's patients each
year — went from 156,654 to 140,552, excluding
newborns.
Spyros Andreopoulos, the hospital's director of
communications, said the cuts were necessary to
make the hospital competitive in prices and
services. "The Bay Area has too may beds," An
dreopoulos said. "In comparison to similar hospi
tals, Stanford has a higher ratio of full-time person
nel to patients."
The reductions are part of a three-year effort by

the hospital to reduce its budget, Andreopoulos
said.
Arnold said the goal of the program will be to
create a "leaner, more efficient hospital." Cuts in
personnel will be "selective," not across-the-board,
to allow for decisions to be made on a departmental
basis.
The cuts will have "no impact at all" on the
hospital's $114 million modernization plan to be
completed in 1987, Arnold said.
The budget reduction measures are partially in
response to the recent Gramm-Rudman federal
legislation that calls for automatic cutbacks in fund
ing to balance the budget, Arnold said.
According to Arnold, staff layoffs are being con
ducted in a "massively caring approach." The
hospital administration will "assist (the laid-off
workers) in terms of severence," he said.
