CANTON, Ohio (AP) — Paul
Hornung, whose Golden Boy image
was tarnished in the 1960s when it
was disclosed he had bet on NFL
games, finally made it to the Pro
Football Hall of Fame on his 15th try.
Fourteen times previously, the
former Green Bay Packers halfback
failed to get enough support for the
Hall.
But yesterday, when the results of
this year's voting were announced,
the votes were there, and Hornung
was elected with four other former
National Football League greats:
quarterback Fran Tarkenton,
halfback Doak Walker and defensive
standouts Willie Lanier and Ken
Houston.
They will be enshrined at
ceremonies next summer.
"I've been very optimistic in the
past, and I've learned not to be too
optimistic," Hornung said. "This
year, it seemed, everybody was telling
me that 1 had an excellent opportu
nity; I was getting closer. It seems like
there was more calls from the media

this year, so where there's a little
smoke there's fire.
"In December, I was inducted into
the College Football Hall of Fame.
Now in January, it tops it off with the
professional Hall of Fame. I couldn't
be happier."
Others also made no secret of their
joy.
"I'm elated," said Houston, who
played as a defensive back for the
Houston Oilers and the Washington
Redskins.
"It's fantastic," said Willie Lanier,
a linebacker for the Kansas City
Chiefs, saying notification of his in
duction gave him a "very rewarding
and refreshing feeling."
Houston became the eighth defen
sive back from the modern era and
the fifth safety to win induction. In 14
seasons, he garnered 49 interceptions
and established an NFL record by
running nine back for touchdowns.
Lanier was the second Kansas City
Chief player — after Bobby Bell — to
make it to the Hall and the eighth
linebacker from the modern era. In

11 seasons, he intercepted 27 passes
for 440 yards and two touchdowns.
Hornung became the 10th member
of the 1961 Green Bay Packers to be
inducted into the Hall. A Heisman
Trophy winner at Notre Dame, he
was a two-time NFL MVP. From
1959 through 1961, while playing for
Green Bay Coach Vince Lombardi,
he led the NFL in scoring for three
consecutive seasons.
Tarkenton became the first player
with any significant playing time with
the Minnesota Vikings to gain entry
into the Hall. He also played for the
New York Giants.
Over his 18-season career, he
amassed NFL career-record passing
totals of 6,467 attempts and 3,686
completions for 47,003 yards and 342
touchdowns.
Walker, who played six seasons
with the Detroit Lions in the 19505,
made the initial list of candidates as a
nominee of the Old-Timers Commit
tee, which studied players with
qualifications dating back primarily
before 1961.
