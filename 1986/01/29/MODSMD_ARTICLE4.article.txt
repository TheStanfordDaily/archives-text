# Filipinos rip Marcos' government
## 
### LARRY WEBER Editorial Staff 
The totalitarian character of Ferdinand Marcos'
government in the Philippines emphasizes the ur
gency of the upcoming Feb. 7 presidential election
in that country and its potential for mockery, ac
cording to a one-time Filipino government bureau
crat.
Wilfredo Manrique, a former secretary to the
Bishop of the Committee on Social Development
in the Philippines, told a Stanford audience of 20
that the hope of a free and democratic Philippines
lies with Marcos' opposition leader Corazon
Aquino.
He said her victory, if allowed by the dictatorial
Marcos to stand, would redirect the Pacific island
country's interests away from Washington, D.C.
and toward home. This change would address the
social, economic and political injustices charac
terizing Filipino life under Marcos' rule.
"Marcos has continually looked for his support
in the United States government rather than in the
Filipino people," Manrique said.
This practice forces the Philippines to withstand
the presence of two U.S. military bases and

gives Marcos discretion over U.S. aid, he said.
In outlining the social realities existing in the
Philippines, both Manrique and Marga Ortigas, a
Filipino student in the Graduate School of Business,
cited the self-interest of the Marcos govern
ment as the hindrance to the welfare of Filipinos.
"In our country, 60 percent of the people die
without receiving any medical attention," Man
rique said. "Zero point five percent of the
Philippines gross national product goes to medical

aid. One dollar gets spent on health for every nine
spent on defense," he added.
According to Ortigas, Marcos has rewritten the
Filipino constitution, which was originally modeled
after the U.S. Constitution, to empower his own of
fice with law-making authority. A parliament
exists, but its legislation is discarded according to
Marcos' whims, she added.

GSB student Marga Oritgas and Wilfredo Manrique, a former Filipino bureaucrat, discuss the
potential pitfalls of the upcoming Filipino elections and the consequences of an Aquino or
Marcos victory, in the Green Room of the Sterling Quad dining area yesterday afternoon.
Ortigas said that although Marcos
appointed his Supreme Court justices
in the same manner as a U.S.
president would, he required them to
sign undated resignation letters.
The rural population, which is 75
percent of the total population, is
subjected to consistent military sur
veillance by Marcos' army, Ortigas
said.
If an individual complains, he will
not find a judge to support him, she
said. He is probably too poor to bribe
him, she continued, and his witnesses
may disappear forever as the result of
what Filipinos call "salvaging."
Rural people, therefore, rely on
communist militiamen to avenge the
brutality of Marcos' army, Ortigas
said. She said it is not unusual for a
communist to behead a Marcos sol
dier accused of harming rural
Filipinos and write the reason for
revenge on the body.
Manrique cited several names of
people he knew had disappeared in
the hands of the army, including a
doctor who was accused of anti
government activity for treating
wounded communist soldiers.
He said that in 1984, 600 "non
combatant" individuals were victims
of military-caused deaths, while 400
people were tortured and 100 disap
peared.
