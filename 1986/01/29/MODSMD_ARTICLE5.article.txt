### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night
confirmed membership of the Spe
cial Investigative Committee and
approved Program Board recom
mendations for funding requests
made by student groups.
By a voice vote, senators unani
mously approved the nomination
of George Pegelow, a Stanford
karate instructor, and French Prof.
Ray Giraud to the ASSU Special
Investigative Committee. The
committee, which also includes Bi
ology Prof. Dow Woodward and
four ASSU senators, was formed
last October to investigate charges
against Stanford police of alleged
brutality. The charges stem from
the Oct. 11 arrest of students pro
testing the University's investment
in South Africa-related compan
ies.
In related action, the senate

delayed a bill that would allocate
money from the ASSU discretion
ary account as a loan to the inves
tigative committee. Members of
the committee requesting the loan
plan to buy T-shirts and sell them
at a profit to raise money for their
investigation. John van Loben
Sels, co-author of the bill, also
proposed that funds be allocated
from the Program Board instead
of the discretionary account.
Senators opposed to the bill
argued that Program Board funds,
which pay for operating expenses
of student programs and organiza
tions, should not be used for
ASSU government purposes.
Van Loben Sels stressed the ex
pediency of allocating money from
the Program Board, but offered a
counterproposal that asked the
Appropriations and Finance Com
mittees to look into possible fund
