# ASSU confirms SIC members
## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night
confirmed membership of the Spe
cial Investigative Committee and
approved Program Board recom
mendations for funding requests
made by student groups.
By a voice vote, senators unani
mously approved the nomination
of George Pegelow, a Stanford
karate instructor, and French Prof.
Ray Giraud to the ASSU Special
Investigative Committee. The
committee, which also includes Bi
ology Prof. Dow Woodward and
four ASSU senators, was formed
last October to investigate charges
against Stanford police of alleged
brutality. The charges stem from
the Oct. 11 arrest of students pro
testing the University's investment
in South Africa-related compan
ies.
In related action, the senate

delayed a bill that would allocate
money from the ASSU discretion
ary account as a loan to the inves
tigative committee. Members of
the committee requesting the loan
plan to buy T-shirts and sell them
at a profit to raise money for their
investigation. John van Loben
Sels, co-author of the bill, also
proposed that funds be allocated
from the Program Board instead
of the discretionary account.
Senators opposed to the bill
argued that Program Board funds,
which pay for operating expenses
of student programs and organiza
tions, should not be used for
ASSU government purposes.
Van Loben Sels stressed the ex
pediency of allocating money from
the Program Board, but offered a
counterproposal that asked the
Appropriations and Finance Com
mittees to look into possible fund
ing alternatives for the Investigative
Committee. The amended proposal
passed by a 12-2 margin and the com
mittee's findings will be reported at
the senate's Feb. 11 meeting.
A bill aimed at interpreting the
ASSU Constitution's provision for
the placement of special fees on the
ballot passed, clearing up questions
concerning divided budgets. Groups
seeking to place a special fee on the
ballot may use only that part of their
most recent divided special fee re
quest that was approved by the stu
dent body.
Senator Jim DeLaHunt, co-author
of the bill, cited The Daily's attempt
to use last year's divided special fee
figure of $40,000 as a basis for this
year's expenses, when the student
body voted for only half of the re
quested $40,000. The senators

agreed last night that The Daily
would be allowed to base this year's
request only on the money that was
approved last year.
In other aetion, the senate ap
proved the Program Board's funding
recommendations for campus organi
zations. Stanford Out of South
Africa's (SOSA) request for funds to
purchase the anti-apartheid film
"Last Grave at Dimbaza" was
rejected. The senate denied the re
quest because the board has "doubly
frozen" SOSA's budget account due
to the disarray of SOSA's financial
records.
By a margin of 12-5, the senate
agreed to allocate the money to Club
Ujamaa, which will buy the film for
general student use pending an inves
tigation into the proposed sellers of
the film.
The ASSU special election will
continue through today and the
results will be released tonight.
