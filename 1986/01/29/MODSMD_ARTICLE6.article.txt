Imagine having the chance to
spend a year with the U.S. public ser
vant you most admire â€” at someone
else's expense. The John Gardner
Fellowship Program has made this
possible for three Stanford graduates.

Feature

The Gardner Fellowship was estab
lished last year to encourage able stu
dents to pursue public service careers.
It provides funding for three students
from Stanford and three students
from Berkeley to spend a year with a
mentor of their choice who works in
the public sector.
The fellowship honors John

Gardner, a distinguished public ser
vant and an alumnus of both Stanford
and Berkeley. Gardner is the former
Secretary of Health, Education and
Welfare, and he is credited with the
founding of the White House Fellow
ship Program. He also founded Com
mon Cause, a Washington-based po
litical action committee.
Class of 1985 graduate Peter
Sidebottom, a pubic policy major, is
one of the the first recipients of the
fellowship. He holds the title of Spe
cial Assistant to Mayor Henry Cis
neros of San Antonio, Texas. After
reading about and following Cisneros
for over four years, Sidebottom now
has the opportunity to work for him.
