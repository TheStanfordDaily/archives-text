Imagine having the chance to
spend a year with the U.S. public ser
vant you most admire — at someone
else's expense. The John Gardner
Fellowship Program has made this
possible for three Stanford graduates.

Feature

The Gardner Fellowship was estab
lished last year to encourage able stu
dents to pursue public service careers.
It provides funding for three students
from Stanford and three students
from Berkeley to spend a year with a
mentor of their choice who works in
the public sector.
The fellowship honors John

Gardner, a distinguished public ser
vant and an alumnus of both Stanford
and Berkeley. Gardner is the former
Secretary of Health, Education and
Welfare, and he is credited with the
founding of the White House Fellow
ship Program. He also founded Com
mon Cause, a Washington-based po
litical action committee.
Class of 1985 graduate Peter
Sidebottom, a pubic policy major, is
one of the the first recipients of the
fellowship. He holds the title of Spe
cial Assistant to Mayor Henry Cis
neros of San Antonio, Texas. After
reading about and following Cisneros
for over four years, Sidebottom now
has the opportunity to work for him.
Sidebottom finds Cisneros appeal
ing for a number of reasons, but
mainly for his pragmatic approach to
politics.
"He is highly innovative in his ap
proach to delivering services to the
people who need them and at the
same time spurring economic
growth," he says.
Cisneros' outstanding credentials
were also a factor in Sidebottom's
decision. The mayor holds a doc
torate in public administration and
has served on such national commit-

his work.

tees as the Kissinger Commission on
Central America. Currently, Cisneros
serves as the head of the National
League of Cities.
Sidebottom describes his work with
the mayor as "crisis management,"
since there is such immediacy in his
job. He has vivid memories of the
rapid pace of his first day.
He was picked up at the airport and

rushed off to do advance work with
some members of the mayor's office.
Later, he was asked to sit in on a city
council meeting and attend to some
other responsibilities.
It wasn't until the following day
that Sidebottom was able to meet his
boss. At first, Sidebottom was
stunned by the experience, but admits
now that the fast-paced life of the of
fice immediately captured his inter
est.
Since Sept., Sidebottom has been
able to involve himself in a number of
issues and activites. He has done
everything from answering con
stituent mail and drafting statements
on such issues as immigration to plan
ning for the upcoming South Texas
Economic Development Program.
In addition, he has had the
privilege to participate in planning for
the Feb. visit of Prince Charles to San
Antonio.
Sidebottom considers himself quite
lucky to have been given the opportu
nity to work with such an encouraging
man as Cisneros. He regularly travels
with Cisneros around the country to
see how other cities are dealing with
the same issues that confront San An
tonio.
Although Sidebottom has not yet
committed himself to a specific career
choice, he says that he has benefitted
tremendously from the opportunities
opened to him from the fellowship.
"The fellowship has opened my
eyes to what is possible in public ser
vice," he says."It has given me a
glimpse of what it is possible to ac

complish in the public sector. . . . The
Gardner Fellowship is an opportunity
to step to the top of the public service
ladder."
In addition to Sidebottom, Class of
1985 graduates Janet Lynch and
Jerry Cacciotti also recieved the

Gardner Fellowship. Both Lynch and
Cacciotti decided to pursue their op
portunities in Washington D.C.
Lynch is working in the office of Sen.
Gary Hart on issues relating to arms
control, and Cacciotti is working with
Rep. Lee Hamilton on issues pertain

ing to international relations.
For those students who are inter
ested in being a fellowship recipient,
move quickly, because time is run
ning out.
Applications are due Feb. 14 and
can be obtained from Jeanne Halleck

in the Public Service Center at Owen
House. Each applicant must write
two 500 word essays and submit two
letters of recommendation.
As it has for Sidebottom, a fellow
ship may whet your appetite for a
career in public service.
