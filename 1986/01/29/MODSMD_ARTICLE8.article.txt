# Research reveals careerism views

Women undergraduates at Stanford outnumber
men more than two-to-one among "intellectuals,"
while men dominate the category of "careerist" by
a similar margin, according to a study by Stanford
researchers released yesterday.
The study also showed that a majority of ethnic
minorities tend to be "strivers," students who seek
to combine career goals with a variety of intellec
tual experiences not necessarily related to a future
job. The largest groups of strivers include the
children of doctors and the offspring of clerical and
blue-collar workers.
The findings of the study, conducted by Psychia
try Prof. Herant Katchadourian and John Boli, re
search coordinator for the Office of Undergraduate
Research, appear in their recently published book,
"Careerism and Intellectualism Among College
Students." Major collaborators include Nancy Ol
sen, research and editorial consultant; Raymond
Bacchetti, vice provost for management; and Sally

Mahoney, associate provost and registrar.
According to Katchadourian, the Stanford under
graduate population may appear to be
homogeneous as far as Scholastic Aptitude Test
scores and academic background is concerned, but
"there is more diversity than meets the eye," he
said.
A 27-member interviewing team met individu
ally with 400 students starting in 1977, the control
groups freshman year, until graduation in June,
1981. Interviewers identified and analyzed aca
demic and career concerns throughout the four
years.
Researchers found students tend to follow one of
the following four paths during their undergraduate
careers at Stanford:
• The Careerists — Throughout college, this group
tends to remain relatively fixed in purpose. They
"stop out" of school less often than their peers and
are less likely to become involved with faculty or
engage in extracurricular activities.
• The Intellectuals — Intellectuals find it harder to
settle on career choices than other students, and

they tend to stop out more, though for short peri
ods of time. Intellectuals tend to be strong in both
verbal and mathematical ability, but gravitate more
toward humanities or social science majors.
• The Strivers — Often interested in more than one
major field, strivers tend to congregate in business,
law and engineering more than intellectuals, but
they make more varied choices than the careerists.
Ethnic minorities are most prevalent here.
• The Unconnected — The unconnected have the
strongest academic backgrounds overall. They
major in the humanities and natural sciences more
than other students, and tend to avoid inter
departmental programs. Their career choices are
quite varied, and stem more from default than ac
tive choice.
Mahoney said the impact of the study while it
was being conducted should not be underes
timated. While no major changes in the education
process here are likely to take place following the
release of the data, she said the findings were one
factor that "brought the '70s to an end and brought
a more structured curriculum to the '80s.
