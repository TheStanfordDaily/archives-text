# Vietnam haunts protesters, vets

### JOHN FOSTER 
There were but a few winners —
and a lot of losers — as a result of the
Vietnam War, according to speakers
at a forum on the Vietnam generation
last night.
The forum, part of a fall quarter
SWOPSI course, was titled "The
Vietnam Generation — Can There
Be Reconciliation?" The six mem
bers of the panel, including three
Vietnam veterans and three former
war activists, discussed their ignor
ance of the politics of the war before
a crowd of 25 at Toyon Hall.
"The only winners were an elite
group of white men," said Ron Glass,
a former protester at Harvard Uni
versity.
That theme was echoed by Grace
Sevy, who organized the forum along
with seven members of her fall quar
ter SWOPSI class. Sevy is a San
Francisco-based free-lance writer and
instructor.
"The Vietnam veterans are seen as
scapegoats for the United States' first
loss," she said, adding that she ques
tioned whether Americans can recon
cile the division between the soldiers
and the activists.

But David Josephson, an activist at
Oregon State University in the mid
'6os and a former ASSU guest pro
fessor, assured that both the activists
and the soldiers were thrown into
roles by those who were not experi
encing the war. With this sense of
hopelessness, he added, "The notion
that we were antagonistic against
each other is false."
Steve Castille, who entered the war
at the age of 17, said he appreciated
the fact that the activists had the
courage to stand up for what they
believed in. He said that he never
really thought about the politics of
the war, and felt it was great that
someone else had the foresight he
lacked.
Another veteran, Larry Vasonic,
agreed with Castille's opinion that
most youths did not view the war
seriously. As a 1965 high school
graduate, he joined the ROTC just
because "it was the thing to do."
Vasonic later saw action as a member
of President Lyndon Johnson's first
military force of 125,000.
Mike Blecker, who said that at the
time he thought the war would just
end next week, also reiterated this
naivete. He said he decided to enlist

in the army to look sharp and be
tough like his friends.
As he left Vietnam, Blecker said he
felt the futility of the war, "All those
people I had killed never changed
anything but me."
According to Josephson, Stanford
played a fundamental role in the
protest movement. In fact, the
SWOPSI program is a direct out
growth of the Vietnam War, he said.
"The reason the (war) resistance
movement did so well is because it
was all over the country," he added.
Alan Engleberg, a protester at

Cornell, said he had personal reasons
for avoiding the war. He said he saw
the war as immoral, yet he did not
want to ruin his life by being incar
cerated as a consciencious objector.
Instead, he became a high school
teacher in New York City so he could
get his draft deferred.
According to Blecker, the U.S.
government "washed their hands of
you (the veterans)." Castille added
that the soldiers were sent home, and
what they found there was isolation.
The government told them they were
saviors for fighting for their country.

gave them a medal if they killed
someone, never debriefed them when
they returned yet expected them to
return peacefully to American sense
of justice.
As a final injuctice, he stated that
the government later eradicated all
medical benefits promised to the
Vietnam veterans.
Senior Robin Fritts, a member of
the SWOPSI course entitled "The
American Experience in Vietnam"
scheduled for this spring, said the
panel showed the "lessons of Viet
nam are still applicable today."
