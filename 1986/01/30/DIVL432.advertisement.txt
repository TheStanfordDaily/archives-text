HERB CAEN
Author of the three dot local interest column that appears six
days a week in the San Francisco Chronicle and has earned
him the nickname of "Mr. San Francisco." Mr. Caen is in his
47th year of this column that has been said to be "the most
widely read column west of the Mississippi." He will be
speaking on his experiences in journalism.

Come see if he'll answer the age old question, "Is Herb
Caen's column next to the Macy's ad or is the Macy's ad next
to Herb Caen's column?"
