# Space research will continue, experts say

I uesday's space shuttle disaster will delay important
scientific research but should not irreparably harm the
U.S. space program, experts here said yesterday.
"Its the kind of setback that tends to get people more
interested (in the space program). I hope it's something
that will spur us on rather than slow us down," said Todd
Hoeksema, a research associate at the Stanford
Electronics Laboratory whose solar research will be
delayed because of the shuttle disaster.
"For now, everything is just going to take longer to get
into space," he said.

The accident could mean no further space shuttle
launches in 1986 and, if a major flaw in the shuttle is
found, U.S. space research could be stalled until the end
of the decade, NASA officials said yesterday.
The accident could delay several experiments important
to Stanford scholars, including a telescope to watch Hal
ley's Comet, the Galileo probe to Jupiter and the Ulysses
mission to the sun's north pole, researchers said.
The programs will be delayed because future shuttle
flights have been postponed until an investigation of the
accident is completed, and because the shuttle fleet has
been reduced from four to three spacecraft, Hoeksema
explained.
Another devastating effect of Tuesday's accident was
the loss of a communications satellite aboard the Chal

lenger. Scientists had been counting on the satellite to
double the present communications capibility for experi
ments, according to Peter Banks, professor of electrical
engineering.
The $1.2 billion space shuttle Challenger exploded 74
seconds after lift-off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., killing all
seven crew members. The incident was the first in-flight
disaster in 56 manned U.S. missions.
"Most former astronauts said it would happen sooner
or later," said Wolfgang Panofsky, director emeritus of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
The space shuttle has been "a fantastic success," but
NASA is not "ready to crank up again rapidly. NASA has
a limited budget and is probably going to have to devote
funds to getting well." Panofsky added.

Asked whether the disaster would create a negative
image of the space program. Mechanical Engineering
Prof. Holt Ashley responded, "People don't stop flying in
planes because there is an accident. . . . The space pro
gram is going to have failures." Holt was the head of a
commision that evaluated the shuttle's thermal protection
system in preparation for the first shuttle flight in 19S1.
"What you see is a reaction . . . all the way from
politicians to scientists, that we must not stop work in
space science," Ashley continued.
Bruce Murray, a former director of the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, concurred with Stanford
scholars.
