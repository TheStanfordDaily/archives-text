# Space research will continue, experts say

### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff With wire reports 
I uesday's space shuttle disaster will delay important
scientific research but should not irreparably harm the
U.S. space program, experts here said yesterday.
"Its the kind of setback that tends to get people more
interested (in the space program). I hope it's something
that will spur us on rather than slow us down," said Todd
Hoeksema, a research associate at the Stanford
Electronics Laboratory whose solar research will be
delayed because of the shuttle disaster.
"For now, everything is just going to take longer to get
into space," he said.

The accident could mean no further space shuttle
launches in 1986 and, if a major flaw in the shuttle is
found, U.S. space research could be stalled until the end
of the decade, NASA officials said yesterday.
The accident could delay several experiments important
to Stanford scholars, including a telescope to watch Hal
ley's Comet, the Galileo probe to Jupiter and the Ulysses
mission to the sun's north pole, researchers said.
The programs will be delayed because future shuttle
flights have been postponed until an investigation of the
accident is completed, and because the shuttle fleet has
been reduced from four to three spacecraft, Hoeksema
explained.
Another devastating effect of Tuesday's accident was
the loss of a communications satellite aboard the Chal

lenger. Scientists had been counting on the satellite to
double the present communications capibility for experi
ments, according to Peter Banks, professor of electrical
engineering.
The $1.2 billion space shuttle Challenger exploded 74
seconds after lift-off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., killing all
seven crew members. The incident was the first in-flight
disaster in 56 manned U.S. missions.
"Most former astronauts said it would happen sooner
or later," said Wolfgang Panofsky, director emeritus of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
The space shuttle has been "a fantastic success," but
NASA is not "ready to crank up again rapidly. NASA has
a limited budget and is probably going to have to devote
funds to getting well." Panofsky added.

Asked whether the disaster would create a negative
image of the space program. Mechanical Engineering
Prof. Holt Ashley responded, "People don't stop flying in
planes because there is an accident. . . . The space pro
gram is going to have failures." Holt was the head of a
commision that evaluated the shuttle's thermal protection
system in preparation for the first shuttle flight in 19S1.
"What you see is a reaction . . . all the way from
politicians to scientists, that we must not stop work in
space science," Ashley continued.
Bruce Murray, a former director of the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, concurred with Stanford
scholars.
"I liken the whole thing to the Apollo fire" that
killed three astronauts on a launch pad 19 years ago.
"That was a terrible blow. We picked ourselves up and
went on to do the greatest achievement ever in space —
humans going to the moon," Murray said.
"I think the same thing will happen here. We'll pick
ourselves up with resilience, push ahead with the pro
gram, and eventually Americans will go to Mars," he
added.
The accident has far-reaching consequences for the mil
itary, according to Panofsky and Coit Blacker, associate
director of the Center for International Security and Arms
Control here.
"The military had a major reliance on the shuttle. . . .
Because of delays, there will be a tremendous struggle be
tween military and civilian uses for the shuttle," Panofsky
said.
The competition between civilians and the military is
already extreme, according to Panofsky. When the shuttle
program was conceived, between 50 and 60 flights per
year were planned, but now only about 15 flights per year
were scheduled before the accident, he said.
Blacker stated, "I don't think the impact (on the mili
tary) will be direct, but it will be real nonetheless, specifi
cally on SDI." The Strategic Defense Initiative is the
Reagan Administration's research program to develop a
space-based, anti-missile defense system.
The space shuttle was used for SDI-related work last
fall, and more research was scheduled for future flights,
Blacker said.
The accident may cast doubts on the ability of the
United States to produce a system as technologically ad
vanced as SDI, he added.
The shuttle is seen as the "flagship of U.S. technology."

A mishap with the shuttle is damaging because "SDI will
require technology way beyond what we already possess,
and the defensive shield is seen as "possible only because
of U.S. science," Blacker said.
The disaster will "serve to make people more cau
tious," he said.
Blacker said he does not believe the Soviet Union
will interpret the accident as a major defeat for U.S. tech
nology.
"1 don't think [the Soviets] will take pleasure (in the ex
plosion) or that they would view it as a setback in compe
tition for us. It's happened to them before,' Blacker said,
referring to three deaths aboard a Soviet spacecraft in
1971.
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev sent a letter of con
dolence to President Reagan yesterday.
Another "fundamental issue" raised by the accident is
the question of whether space missions should be manned
or unmanned, Panofsky said.
"Man is not as essential as he seems (in space missions).
Manned missions have P.R. value, but unmanned mis
sions have greater scientific value," said Panofsky, who
described himself as a proponent of unmanned spacecraft.
The cause of the explosion remains a mystery, but Ash
ley said that a "sensible analysis" is that a leak opened in
the shuttle's external fuel tank.
Tapes of the explosion showed that "there was a flame
which could have been coming from the rocket booster,
but probably came from the main fuel tank," according to
Ashley.
"There was something letting [hydrogen fuel escape
and] burn. That went on for probably a second before the
explosion," said Ashley, noting that any theory at this
point is "pure hypothesis."
"There is a pretty good chance of finding out" what
caused the explosion by analyzing data transmitted be
tween the shuttle and ground control prior to the accident,
Ashley said.

Prof. Holt Ashley responded, "People don't stop flying in
planes because there is an accident. . . . The space pro
gram is going to have failures." Holt was the head of a
commision that evaluated the shuttle's thermal protection
system in preparation for the first shuttle flight in 19S1.
"What you see is a reaction . . . all the way from
politicians to scientists, that we must not stop work in
space science," Ashley continued.
Bruce Murray, a former director of the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, concurred with Stanford
scholars.
"I liken the whole thing to the Apollo fire" that
killed three astronauts on a launch pad 19 years ago.
"That was a terrible blow. We picked ourselves up and
went on to do the greatest achievement ever in space —
humans going to the moon," Murray said.
"I think the same thing will happen here. We'll pick
ourselves up with resilience, push ahead with the pro
gram, and eventually Americans will go to Mars," he
added.
The accident has far-reaching consequences for the mil
itary, according to Panofsky and Coit Blacker, associate
director of the Center for International Security and Arms
Control here.
"The military had a major reliance on the shuttle. . . .
Because of delays, there will be a tremendous struggle be
tween military and civilian uses for the shuttle," Panofsky
said.
The competition between civilians and the military is
already extreme, according to Panofsky. When the shuttle
program was conceived, between 50 and 60 flights per
year were planned, but now only about 15 flights per year
were scheduled before the accident, he said.
Blacker stated, "I don't think the impact (on the mili
tary) will be direct, but it will be real nonetheless, specifi
cally on SDI." The Strategic Defense Initiative is the
Reagan Administration's research program to develop a
space-based, anti-missile defense system.
The space shuttle was used for SDI-related work last
fall, and more research was scheduled for future flights,
Blacker said.
The accident may cast doubts on the ability of the
United States to produce a system as technologically ad
vanced as SDI, he added.
The shuttle is seen as the "flagship of U.S. technology."

A mishap with the shuttle is damaging because "SDI will
require technology way beyond what we already possess,
and the defensive shield is seen as "possible only because
of U.S. science," Blacker said.
The disaster will "serve to make people more cau
tious," he said.
Blacker said he does not believe the Soviet Union
will interpret the accident as a major defeat for U.S. tech
nology.
"1 don't think [the Soviets] will take pleasure (in the ex
plosion) or that they would view it as a setback in compe
tition for us. It's happened to them before,' Blacker said,
referring to three deaths aboard a Soviet spacecraft in
1971.
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev sent a letter of con
dolence to President Reagan yesterday.
Another "fundamental issue" raised by the accident is
the question of whether space missions should be manned
or unmanned, Panofsky said.
"Man is not as essential as he seems (in space missions).
Manned missions have P.R. value, but unmanned mis
sions have greater scientific value," said Panofsky, who
described himself as a proponent of unmanned spacecraft.
The cause of the explosion remains a mystery, but Ash
ley said that a "sensible analysis" is that a leak opened in
the shuttle's external fuel tank.
Tapes of the explosion showed that "there was a flame
which could have been coming from the rocket booster,
but probably came from the main fuel tank," according to
Ashley.
"There was something letting [hydrogen fuel escape
and] burn. That went on for probably a second before the
explosion," said Ashley, noting that any theory at this
point is "pure hypothesis."
"There is a pretty good chance of finding out" what
caused the explosion by analyzing data transmitted be
tween the shuttle and ground control prior to the accident,
Ashley said.
I uesday's space shuttle disaster will delay important
scientific research but should not irreparably harm the
U.S. space program, experts here said yesterday.
"Its the kind of setback that tends to get people more
interested (in the space program). I hope it's something
that will spur us on rather than slow us down," said Todd
Hoeksema, a research associate at the Stanford
Electronics Laboratory whose solar research will be
delayed because of the shuttle disaster.
"For now, everything is just going to take longer to get
into space," he said.

The accident could mean no further space shuttle
launches in 1986 and, if a major flaw in the shuttle is
found, U.S. space research could be stalled until the end
of the decade, NASA officials said yesterday.
The accident could delay several experiments important
to Stanford scholars, including a telescope to watch Hal
ley's Comet, the Galileo probe to Jupiter and the Ulysses
mission to the sun's north pole, researchers said.
The programs will be delayed because future shuttle
flights have been postponed until an investigation of the
accident is completed, and because the shuttle fleet has
been reduced from four to three spacecraft, Hoeksema
explained.
Another devastating effect of Tuesday's accident was
the loss of a communications satellite aboard the Chal

lenger. Scientists had been counting on the satellite to
double the present communications capibility for experi
ments, according to Peter Banks, professor of electrical
engineering.
The $1.2 billion space shuttle Challenger exploded 74
seconds after lift-off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., killing all
seven crew members. The incident was the first in-flight
disaster in 56 manned U.S. missions.
"Most former astronauts said it would happen sooner
or later," said Wolfgang Panofsky, director emeritus of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
The space shuttle has been "a fantastic success," but
NASA is not "ready to crank up again rapidly. NASA has
a limited budget and is probably going to have to devote
funds to getting well." Panofsky added.
