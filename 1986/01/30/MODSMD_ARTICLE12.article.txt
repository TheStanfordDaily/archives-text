## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Zapata's right to paint 
### 
Without neccessarily condoning their message, we
commend the seven artists and other members of the
Casa Zapata dormitory for the successful production of
their mural, "Spirit of Hoover," which was unveiled
last week.
The subject matter of the mural is obviously contro
versial, but the undergraduate artists who produced it
as a part of a SWOPSI course taught by Zapata Resi
dent Fellow Jose Antonio Burciaga showed good
judgement and fairness in their decision to place the
work on the walls of a University residence.
In a graphic fashion, the mural has provoked
thought and discussion about the Hoover Institution
and a wide range of other issues. In this respect, the
mural is a good thing, whether one agrees with its anti-
Hoover message or not.
But the unveiling of the "Spirit of Hoover" raises
another important question. Is a university dormitory
the appropriate place to express so strong a political
message?
While it is obviously wrong to suppress freedom of
expression, there is some case against the expression of
political messages in a dorm environment.
After all, a dorm is, in a sense, like a home, and
don't we all have the right to address or not address
political issues in our own home?
Even though Casa Zapata is an ethnic theme house,

not everyone living there has chosen to do so, and it
can be reasonably assumed that not all of Zapata's res
idents have the same political sympathies.
But Burciaga and his class wanted to make the mural
a "community project," and they have succeeded. The
subject matter of the mural was discussed openly at
dorm meetings, according to Burciaga, and all resi
dents were offered a chance to speak up on the isssue.
In addition, a rough draft of the mural was posted in
Zapata a week before the actual painting commenced
in mid-October, and it was left there until the end of
last quarter. Beneath the rough draft, a sheet was
placed for the residents to offer their comments, even
anonymously.
Burciaga made it clear that everyone in the dorm ap
proved of the political message in the work. Given
those facts, there is no problem with the presentation
of their political message in their dorm, and the actions
of Zapata should serve as a good precedent for other
dorms or groups who wish to act similarly.
Granted, not all messages can be condoned by a
majority opinion within the environment in which they
are presented. But in Zapata's case, where the message
is strictly political and appears to reflect the feelings of
all the residents, there is no conflict with its presenta
tion in a dorm. In fact, such action should be ap
plauded.
