## Farm gets passing grade 
### 
I am amazed and confused by R. Richard Banks' appli
cation of his personal disillusionment to his judgement of
undergraduate education at Stanford and other American
unviersities in his column, "Stanford Lacks Academic
Rigor" (The Daily, Jan. 27). This institution obviously
does not live up to Banks' rigorous standards, but he fails
to prove how academics on The Farm reflect mediocrity.
Is it the "we'll take anyone" admissions policy, the
average or dull faculty and staff or solely a highly corn-

PERI Z. HANSEN

plex and sometimes confusing grading system that has dis
appointed Banks? I do not believe that a proper apprecia
tion of extremely competitive admissions, a world
renowned faculty, and other limitless academic resources,
as well as beautiful surroundings constitutes "prevailing
elitist sentiment." This is a unique and superior institu
tion, and an understanding of this idea is in no way
demeaning; it only reflects discernment and humility —
certainly more humility than that of someone who labels
an education at Stanford "mediocre."
Concerning Stanford's grading system, I doubt that
many students or faculty members favor the implementa
tion of a rigid percentage grading scale or any other means
that would supposedly inhibit "grade inflation." What
standard or concrete measurement can account for those
factors which rightly stir our so-called "elitism?" This is
not a community college, nor should its grading system at

tempt to emulate one. There are two ends to a grading
spectrum. Banks mentions "inflation," but what about its
polar opposite, "deflation?" A perfectly respectable B on
a Stanford transcript, inflated or not, would most prob
ably be an A at a truly mediocre university.
Just as the meanings of letter grades and GPAs fluc
tuate among schools, so does the significance of a degree
— but not in the sense in which Banks implies. He
assumes that a "prestigious Stanford degree" evokes
some generic sense of awe and amazement in those who
see it neatly typed on a resume or hanging squarely on an
office wall. How is this phenomenon possible if the degree
is truly the product of a mediocre institution? A Stanford
degree may receive a justified appreciation on its own be
half, but more important, we must remember that it is
the product of an individual's capabilities, motivation and
expectations; a degree is not the product of a university.
Just as the significance of a degree may vary among uni
versities, it will also do so among graduates from the same
school because we are individuals. Does Banks measure
the value of an education according to the amount of rev
erence evoked by a paper degree? So what if an individual
chooses to "just coast to graduation?" There are always
those who seek to achieve no more than the satisfaction of
the minimal standards.
btanforu lias not met banks expectations. That is the
only justifiable conclusion of his column. His personal dis
illusionment should not, however, be confused with the
quality of an undergraduate education at Stanford.
