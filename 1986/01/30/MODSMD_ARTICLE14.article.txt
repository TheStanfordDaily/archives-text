No easy answers
to S. Africa crisis
Most people feel revulsion and in
dignation at South Africa's system of
apartheid. I find I hear a lot of
protest, though, without any discus
sion of how actually to move away
from apartheid.
The easiest solution for an Ameri
can to consider is a constitutional
democracy with equal civil and politi
cal liberties for all, including, of
course, universal sufferage. It would
last until the first vote was taken.
Africa has the worst record of
oppression of minorities of any con
tinent. Put the blame on colonialism,
wherever you like, the fact remains:
Africa's record of inter-tribal oppres
sion must disgust the staunchest
apologist. The continent's lone white
tribe could not expect any better were
they to give up power to the majority.
A large group oppressing a small
one is not morally superior to a small
group oppressing a large one. The
moral legitimacy of majority rule is a
means for deciding what equal treat
ment before the law all citizens will
receive. It depends crucially on the
preservation of rights and liberties,
and it assumes one people, however
diverse, who accept and desire a com
mon destiny. It has no legitimacy as a
means for one group to dis
enfranchise another.
Robert Mugabe's drive to establish
a one-party state in Zimbabwe, dis
enfranchising Zimbabwe's second
largest tribe, indicates what the
prospects for political and civil
liberties would be under majority rule
in South Africa.
So what is the answer?
There are six times as many blacks,
"coloreds" and "Asians" in South
Africa as there are whites. Thus, give
each of the oppressed one-sixth of a
vote in a parliamentary democracy.
Look at the logic of it. There are
two groups, both of which would
oppress the other if they could. The
answer is to give them parity, so that
they are forced to compromise with

each other if they are to accomplish
anything.
Obviously, the result is still racist.
Racism is a fact in South Africa. It
must be taken into account in devis
ing a way out of oppression.
Those who don't agree with me
that this would be a good system until
the two sides learn to accommodate
each other must admit that it would
be a step in the right direction (since
blacks, "coloreds" and "Asians"
presently have no vote in South
Africa).
Why would the whites accept it?
They wouldn't, but they ought to, be
cause if things come to a head the
whites must either lose South Africa
or commit genocide, which President
Botha has said he is willing to do.
I know some observers who believe
India will deliver a nuclear warhead
on Johannesburg if a genocide does
take place. I would think a lot of
white South Africans must hope for
some other solution.

Death penalty is
just punishment
I am writing in response to the edi
torial entitled "Stop the Death
Penalty" (Daily, Jan. 21). Certainly,
the most difficult part of criticizing
this editorial is deciding where to
begin. As a reminder, the article dealt
with the execution, on Jan. 10, of
James Terry Roach. The author of
the article claims that because Roach,
"May have been suffering from a
mentally debilitating genetic disor
der," he should not have been ex
ecuted for his rape, murder and later
mutilation of a South Carolina
woman. By later mutilation, I mean
that Roach actually returned to the
scene of the crime after some time to
further his heinous act. One point the
author mentions is that prison should
be a place of reform not punishment.
Reform? How, I ask. does one reform
a person suffering from a mentally

debilitating genetic disorder? This
question is overlooked by the author.
The Daily goes on to say that the
evidence regarding whether or not
the death penalty is an effective
deterrent is inconclusive. For that
matter, the use of reform is also ques
tionable; evidenced by the fact that a
large percentage of crimes are
commited by repeat offenders. The
author then avers that "no one has
the right to sentence a criminal to
death." And yet, criminals wield the
right tQ sentence their victims to
death: in Roach's victim's case, a
death far more brutal, excruciating
and dehumanizing that the one he
himself experienced. Another bril
liant line reads, "... it is wrong for
courts to condemn one in the interest
of 'the people' ". What then, is the
function of the courts? The article
also expresses the belief that a disad
vantage of capital punishment is that
it gives the justice system a "punitive
image." That would truly be a shame
if the word "Justice" in the Justice
System began to refer to granting
justice to the innocent victim rather
than a convicted criminal who, by
taking another's life, has sacrificed his
right to live within the bounds of
human society. We must question
here whom the Justice System
represents and defends: the criminal
or the victim?

Attentive readers of The Daily will
notice that the undersigned were
recently involved in a somewhat
acrimonious exchange of letters to
the editor. Since then, we have gotten
together, talked and come to an un
derstanding.
There is a lesson here that others in
the Stanford community might like to
take to heart.
