# Of peace and T.H. White
## 
### 
T.H. White is not often taken seriously. Because he
lived through the two great wars of this century, and yet
chose to hole himself away and write about the old sen
timental romance of King Arthur and the Round Table,
he is largely considered a minor figure by literary scholars.
Which is not to say that his books are ignored by the
reading public; I count myself among many who have
enjoyed the entertainment of his fiction. But for the very
reason that this fiction springs from myth and fancy,
White is labeled as appropriate for children's bookshelves
but not for college classrooms.
Cleaning my particular bookshelves over the holidays, I
stumbled upon my volumes of White and reread what I
consider his most accomplished prose — "The Book of
Merlyn." This work is full of all the fairytale touches

which have labeled him a cult writer — wizards, magic
and talking animals — but from that background emerges
an undeniable relevancy and urgency of tone. For in 1941,
when the nations had plunged themselves into yet another
dreadful global war, White stepped out of the time of his
tory to write a symposium on mankind, a symposium at
tended not by policy specialists nor arms experts, but by a
weary mythological king, his childhood tutor and mem
bers of the animal kingdom.
The book's events take place on the eve of the final col
lapse of Camelot. Merlyn comes to Arthur's tent and
whisks him away to a badger's cave, where the animals
have assembled to examine the nature of what it is to be
human and why this definition has forever included a
proclivity to contend in warfare. What makes this confer
ence novel is that man is scrutinized not as a superior
being, but as one of the over 250,000 species which in
habit the earth. And in order to sharpen the tool with
which the king sees the world and man's place in it, Mer
lyn changes him into animal form, first an ant, then a
white-fronted goose.
As an ant, Arthur is tossed into a society founded upon
the state's preeminence over the individual. The mem
bers of this society share common food stores and work in
organized labor groups. No concept of personal need or
desire exists, nor does a sense of the imagination. While
Arthur struggles under the oppression of this socialism,
Merlyn explains to the animals that there was once a
thinker named Marx who, although a brilliant economist,
was a very poor judge of human nature. Marx conceived
the perfect society communistic, yet misunderstood man's
makeup — that he is not simply a duplicate of his neigh
bor, that he is at his best when confronting life in his indi
vidual struggle. (The wizard lives backward in time and is
thus familiar with contemporary history. We have to give
White this little bit of license.)
Merlyn snatches the king from the ant-state moments
before it is to go to war with another colony over a ques
tion of threatened national interests. When Arthur has

returned to human form, Merlyn lectures him on the old
one-eyed monster: "It is nationalism," he says,"the
claims of small communities to parts of the indifferent
earth as communal property, which is the curse of man. It
is the ants and bees, with their communal stomachs and
territories, and the men, with their national property, who
slit each other's throats."
The wizard then sends Arthur off to fly with the white
fronted geese. The geese have no centralized government
nor any national possessions; they believe the earth
belongs wholly to itself. Their highest order of group
living is the family. They count among their boons of exis
tence travel, health, honor, love, comradeship, music and
poetry. They do not war. The geese value, above all, the
sanctity of the individual and his right to find his own
truth. Their society flourishes peacefully upon a principle
of personal freedom, where each bird's sense of morality
and justice is formed from within, not without. They are
anarchists.
Restored to his old self, Arthur is prepared to complete
his tutelage. These last chapters are where White's voice —
the writer now speaking through the tutor, Merlyn —
comes to us with all the urgency of a man, who, watching
World War II from his workshop window, is desperately
searching for an instrument to express, perhaps for the
last time, the collected truths of human harmony, the old
and bitter lessons learned from ages of hostility. Merlyn
instructs Arthur on the finer points of the human brain
and nervous system: its ability to act like a two-way mir
ror, to differentiate itself from the world at large, and the
necessity for it to specialize in individualism. Collectivism
of any sort is not adapatable to the human mind, and it in
evitably leads to one form or another of systematic vio
lence. White's privy council, after pondering furiously the
problem of man, adjourns the day's session with a recom
mendation of absolute anarchism.
Last November, the two leaders of the world's super
powers met in Geneva to discuss the very same issues that
Arthur and his panel of animals passionately analyzed —
namely, how not to blow ourselves up. However, when
Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev came to the bargaining
table, they addressed each other not as individuals but as
nations, as the United States and the Soviet Union, for in
our world we live by collectivism. They did not meet to
read and interpret literature, and certainly they did not
debate the merits of the white-fronted geese. I, for one,
cannot imagine them talking to wizards. And quite likely,
it never occurred to either gentleman that the human, not
withstanding the ant and the bee and a few other excep
tions, is the only species of life on this planet which
huddles itself into separate nation-states.
Rather, they went to Switzerland with a different set of
vocabularies. They spoke with practical words and artic
ulated in earnest their concerns about nuclear arsenals
and military research. They operated in the world of fact,
not fancy, and this is probably as it should be. For we do
live in the time of history, not in the time of nature, and
the problems these stumbling giants we call nations pose
are not hypothetical speculations but immediate worries.
T.H. White's 20th-century plea for anarchism may not be
a workable solution to our dilemma, but his invitation to
sit in symposium should not be dismissed.
