# Paul wins a round in tenure suit
## 
### MARY YUH Senior staff writer 
A California magistrate last week ordered the
appointment of a third party to read the 11 evalua
tion letters of Diana Paul, a former Stanford assis
tant professor in religious studies who filed suit in
1984 eharging the University with racial and sexual
discrimination in denying her tenure.
"We just received the decision and haven't had
the chance to review and analyze it," Susan De
Jongh-Kearl, associate staff counsel for the Univer
sity, said yesterday.
Magistrate Wayne Brazil of the Northern Dis
trict of California ordered the attorneys for Stan
ford and Paul to meet and agree on a neutral party
who will read and summarize the letters, according
to Paul's attorney, Mari Mayeda.
Stanford has 10 days to appeal the decision,
Mayeda said. An appeal would be heard by Robert
Aguilar, a federal judge.
The University probably will decide by the end
of the week whether or not it will appeal, according
to De Jongh-Kearl.
"I would feel very comfortable bringing the case
before court" if the University appeals the order,
Mayeda said. "1 think we have a strong case."
Paul's suit, asking for tenure or review of her
tenure candidacy, claims that she was unjustifiably
denied access to her tenure file, which contains let
ters from 1 1 experts evaluating her scholarship.
Her attorneys, Mayeda and Brad Seligman, have
been trying to obtain Paul's file as they prepare her
case for trial, expected to begin in mid-June.
The full file is necessary to evaluate completely
the fairness of the tenure denial, according to En
glish Prof. Ronald Rebholz, Paul's faculty adviser
during her grievance proceedings against the Uni
versity.
Whether or not Paul's attorneys will push to see
the letters themselves "depends on what the sum
mary (prepared by the third party) looks like,"
Mayeda said.
The summaries prepared by the University and
given to Paul quoted the letters of evaluation, but
"it is impossible to tell the context of any of these
remarks," Rebholz said earlier this month.
A Religious Studies Department committee
composed of five tenured men unanimously denied
Paul tenure in February 1983.
Paul was not rated as "outstanding" in either
teaching or research, the two categories in which a
tenure candidate is judged. An "outstanding" in
either of the categories is required for tenure.
Paul, who is part Japanese, "was subjected to a
lot of racist and sexist remarks" while at Stanford
and was criticized for focusing her scholarship on
women, according to Mayeda.
