## CAMPUS COMPENDIUM 
### 
Why?
A great college tradition has come to a clothe. Not wan
ting to be caught with his pants down, Purdue University
President Steven Beering succumbed to university pres
sure and banned the ever-popular "Nude Olympics."
Beering believes this event, which started as a male prank
in the late 19505, poses both a health hazard to the stu
dents and creates a rather improper image of this Big Ten
School.
"When you've got 300 people running around stark
naked at minus 50 degrees, you run the major risk of
frostbite and losing tips of noses, fingers, genetalia (sic),
breasts, toes and so on," Beering was quoted as saying in
The Michigan Daily.
Why not?
You're hungry. God, you're hungry. And, okay, you're
a little wasted. You're in Bloomington, Ind., and it's the
night of your 19th birthday.
You're in a restaurant. Your buddies are with you. But
the menu . . . there's nothing there but hamburgers,
steaks, hot dogs, fries! You want something else. You
begin tiptoeing toward the kitchen door. You want . . .
A five-pound bag of cheddar cheese substitute, an or
ange and a bottle of ketchup.
Indiana University student Kevin Keeley spent five
hours in jail last Monday after stealing the above three
items from the refrigerator of a downtown Bloomington
restaurant. He was caught in the act by the restaurant's
burly night manager, who sat on top of Keeley until the
police arrived.
Keeley was charged with attempted theft, illegal con
sumption of alcohol and, after failing a dexterity test in
the jail, public intoxication. He was released Tuesday

morning after posting a $2,000 bond.
Oh, please. . .
Nobody knows what winters on the East Coast do to
warp students' thinking capabilities, but the pranks at uni
versities back there are just weird. Take, for example, the
target of one particular hoax — the American Whig-
Cliosophic Society at Princeton. They were preyed upon
by none other than the University of Pennsylvania's
Philomathean Zellosphic Society.
It seems that there appeared across the Princeton
campus a poster announcing the opportunity to try out for
the game show "The Wheel of Fortune" and meet co-host
Vanna White. The location of this rare event was the
Whig-Clio Society's offices. The name to call for further
information was Phil Zello (get it?) and the number was
that of Whig-Clio president Ken Menken.
Well, an estimated 100 people showed up for this
meeting that never occured and poor Ken had over two
hours of answering machine tape devoted to students' in
quiries. The Whigs were not happy campers.
Now, it seems that the basis of this prank stems from an
ongoing rivalry between these two debating teams (ah, so
that's the reason for their pretentious society titles). The
Princetonians, obviously embarassed over the fact that
they had been had, vowed revenge. Their plan — to sue
the Pennsylvanians, dropping the litigation just before the
trial. The plan, however, was leaked, by none other than
"out of answering machine tape" Ken, who naively
divulged the entire scheme while reassuring what seemed to
be a patriotic Princetonian eager to avenge his honor.
That student turned out to be Eugene Bolt, president of
the Philomathean Zellosphic Society. Stupid. Stupid.
