# Orchestra offers Mozart, Brahms

Mozart's exultant Piano Concerto in F (K. 549)
and Brahms tragic Symphony Number One in C
Minor were featured in the San Francisco Sym
phony's Jan. 22 performance, led by guest conduc
tor Stanislaw Skrowaczewski. Pianist Peter Serkin
joined the symphony for the concerto and principal
cellist Michael Grebanier was featured in William
Schuman's "A Song of Orpheus."
The 19th of Mozart's piano concertos, K. 549 is
one in a series of 11 that he penned in a two-year
span. This period coincided with the peak of
Mozart's popularity in Vienna and with a string of
other bright, optimistic concerti. It is a cheerful
work, rapid in its military precision.
An unusual feature of this concerto is that the
piano is frequently cast in the role of accompanist
to the orchestra, supplying only simple triplet fig
ures. Piano and orchestra do not often share the
spotlight in Mozart's work or in the romantic con
certi which were to follow in the next century.
Serkin's solo performance was remarkable for its
lightness and lyrical character. He articulated the
phrases so smoothly that the piano almost sang. It
sounded as if he were producing a smooth melodic
line without individual notes. The continuity of
Serkin's phrasing made the concerto fluid,
diminishing its martial qualities.
This continuity within and between the phrases
required Serkin to sacrifice some of the available
dynamic range, but the approach worked. For ex
ample, the piano enters the first movement with
four phrases in which the second bar has the same
rhythm as the first. By connecting the two bars with
legato and playing the second more softly than the
first, the second bar was made to sound more like
an echo than a reply. This made the phrase follow

more coherently from beginning to end.
Skrowaczewski's handling of the orchestra con
trasted with Serkin's style of solo playing. He used
more staccato phrasing and made cleaner breaks
between the phrases, and drew out important
phrases in the winds to counterpoint the piano.
Skrowaczewski concluded the program with a
highly colored rendition of Brahms' First Sym
phony in C minor. The work is long, large and gen
erally tragic in mood. The great fourth movement
contains a few bursts of dazzling light, but con
cludes with a feeling of dejection and defeat.
Skrowaczewski's interpretation lacked a vision of
the work as a whole. While he showed a wide range
of color, dynamics and emotions, he did not seem

to be going anywhere. It was as if he had conducted
each page of the score as a separate work. The or
chestra charged into crescendo after crescendo,
each much like the one before, and it soon became
tiresome.
Principal cellist Michael Grebanier was the
soloist in the opening work, Schuman's "A Song of
Orpheus, Fantasy for Cello and Orchestra."
The eerie voice of the cello dominated the work,
as the orchestra mostly supplied light accompani
ment with little musical substance. Grebanier
played the haunting melodies darkly and ex
pressively, scaling the full range of the cello.
Skrowaczewski supplied background carefully and
with respect.
