# 'Trip' goes to cinematic dead end

### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
Watching Peter Masterson's film of
Horton Foote's "The Trip to Bounti
ful" is like experiencing sensory
deprivation. Foote's script was
originally a 1953 one-hour television
play, and even then it must have been
a long hour.
Yet audiences might feel comforta
ble with the movie precisely because,
like TV, it doesn't demand one's full
attention. You may want to bring a
book and a reading light to it, and
look up every few minutes to catch
Geraldine Page looking sly and
grandmotherly cute. Masterson
knows he's got an Oscar-caliber

actress here (she might get yet an
other nomination for this), and he
takes advantage of it sticking her in
literally every scene. With Foote's
material, that cuts both ways.
His play is about Carrie Watts
(Page), who lives with her downtrod
den son, Ludie (John Heard), and his
obnoxious wife, Jessie May (Carlin
Glynn), in Houston in 1947.
There are some tensions in this
living situation which we are immedi
ately let in on, and the family
squabbles seem ripe to explode into
some big revelations, right out of bad
Tennessee Williams or William Inge.
They never do, and all of the tensions
remain just as we see them at the
beginning; they're always comfor

tably on the surface.
Right away we learn that Jessie
May doesn't like Mother Watts'
pouting, running around or hymn
singing (this little detail should set off
warning bells: morally uplifting plot
ahead). Jessie May repeats these
charges many times in the movie, and
she even ticks them off at the end, in
case we had forgotten them.
Her dwelling on these things is
supposed to indicate that she's self
centered and not understanding, but
Page's hymn singing truly is insuf
ferable, as are her bustling around
and pouting.
These mannerisms, plus some
reminiscing and wise reflection, are
all she has to do in this role, which she

performs as if she thought it really
were award-worthy. Page makes the
most of her baggy face for smiles or
dejected looks, but Mother' Watts is
not, to put it kindly, a role which an
actor can grow in, and Foote's ma
terial is not just repetitive, it's old hat
from the beginning. It's grandmother
schtick.
We're stuck with Mother Watts on
her journey of discovery to her
hometown of Bountiful, where she
hopes to recapture her more pleasant
and prosperous past. On the way she
meets a nice sheriff (Richard Brad
ford), and an extremely nice young
girl named Thelma (Rebecca DeMor
nay), who admires Watts' hymn sing
ing.
