# Surrealist art turns new lens on world
## 
### MARK TOMPKINS Staff writer 
A nude woman, her arms im
possibly elongated, sits on a divan
and reclines into eternity. A hand
explodes as it opens a door. A
wooden, machine-gun-like
sculpture sits placidly and out of it
grow organic shapes that resemble
the female breast.
These are just a few of the
bizarre images in the "L'Amour
fou: Photography and Surrealism"
exhibition at San Francisco's
Museum of Modern Art. Consist
ing of over 200 photographs from
the '20s and '30s, the exhibit will
run until Feb. 16. This is a collec
tion of photographs well worth
seeing, for the best of these images
offer nothing less than a new way
of looking at the world.
The Surrealist movement offi
cially began in 1924, when the poet
Andre Breton published the "First
Surrealist Manifesto," a work
which advocated the exploration
of dreams and the irrational in
everyday life. Taking their cue
from Sigmund Freud, Breton and
his followers devoted themselves
to mapping out man's uncon
scious, what they called the
"psychopathology of everyday
life." This referred to the way
in which ordinary objects come to
represent and reveal man's inner
desires.
In this context, reality becomes
a "forest of signs," and anything
can stand for anything else. But in
their experiments with the camera,
the Surrealists were not content to
simply photograph recognizable
objects and assign meaning to
their images afterwards. Instead,
they quickly set about developing
the techniques of double expo
sure, solarization, and
photomontage. A new language
was created, one which distorted,
symbolized and fragmented the
mundane.
But one's first impression of the
exhibit may be that the Surrealists
were not the high-minded ex
plorers of the unknown they made
themselves out to be. Instead, they
were a bunch of naughty fellows

who liked to take dirty pictures.
Here the female body is treated in
a variety of manners, from the
amusing to the vaguely unnerving.
It is in the fetish-like work of
Hans Bellmer that nudity becomes
almost grotesque. Bellmer's
obscure objects of desire include
dolls with dismembered limbs and
eyes in their stomachs, as well as a
pelvis with two sets of legs, one
male and the other female. These
are not photographs for the faint
of-heart or the easily offended.
But only a few of the photos in
this exhibit are disturbing or un
pleasant. Many of them show an
engagingly whimsical sensibility
and are quite funny, such as Rene
Magritte's "Paris (Opera)," from
1929. In the background an ornate
gothic building sinks into a field,
while in the foreground several
cows munch grass contentedly,
oblivious to the calamity taking
place behind them.
Georges Hugnet's"Modern En
ergy" (1936) is also amusing: two
women stand at a phone booth on
a rocky beach, while behind them
a gigantic flower rises out of the
tide. And then there is a 1933
piece by Brassai, the veritable
thigh-slapper of the exhibition.
The photo shows a wad of tooth
paste blown up many times
beyond normal size, while the title
reads, "Involuntary Sculpture:
The morphological happenstance
of oozed toothpaste doesn't
escape fine and ornamental
stereotype." Like the rest of the
Surrealists, Brassai was no dour
academic.
There are more photos by the
American Man Ray than anyone
else in the show, but every one
deserves its place. His "Minotaur"
(1933) shows a headless male
torso, shot and lit in such a way
that it has all the primal force of a
creature from ancient Greek
myth.
The Surrealist movement's ex
periments in photography have
traditionally been given short
shrift by art historians. This ex
hibit may help to change all that. It
lingers in the mind long after
wards, like a dream.
