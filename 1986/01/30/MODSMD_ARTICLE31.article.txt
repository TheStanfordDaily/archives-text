## Looking for the big return Riviera-bound Card primed to avenge '85 disappointment 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
The Stanford women's tennis team
commences what Coach Frank Bren
nan labels "our toughest year so far"
with opening-round action today in
the Riviera Collegiate Invitational in
Pacific Palisades.
"We don't really have any weak
spots on our schedule," Brennan said
as he sat in his office above the varsity
tennis courts Tuesday.
The Cardinal will be tested imme
diately in Riviera, an individual
tournament lasting through Sunday,
with several of the nation's finest
players competing in both singles and
doubles.

"Most of the good schools will be
there, with the exception of the
Florida schools," Brennan said.
Indeed, defending-champion USC,
No. 3 Texas, No. 5 Trinity, UCLA,
San Diego State and California will
all convene this weekend at Riviera.
And Stanford will see all of these
schools at least once later in the year
as well.
But don't start feeling sorry for
Brennan. He's certainly not feeling
sorry for himself. There's a reason for
his übiquitous grin. Playing a rigorous
schedule is the least Brennan could
do with the talent and depth he has at
his disposal this season.
The pollsters have recognized the
Cardinal's potential, ranking them

No. 1 with USC in the preseason poll.
And, though he knows that a long
season awaits his team, Brennan
would not trade places with any coach
in the nation.
"I'm very optimistic," he said. "We
have the players who are capable of
winning the national championship."
Prospects were not so bright last
May. The top-seeded Cardinal had
been eliminated in the NCAA quar
terfinals by a finely-tuned Trinity
team. "We might have been a little
too relaxed, but they played ab
solutely spectacularly," Brennan said.
"They sensed an upset."
Much of the disappointment from
the team results was alleviated by the
performance of senior Linda Gates in
the individual competition. Gates
defeated Trinity's Gretchen Rush for
the singles championship and
combined with Leigh Anne Eldredge
to capture the doubles title.
Gates, however, graduated in June,
leaving a major spot to fill on the
roster. Despite her graduation,
Brennan believes that this year's
Cardinal may yet compare favorably
with last year's team.
"Linda is quite a loss; she had a
pretty awesome record," Brennan
said. "(But) we're probably a little bit
stronger this season. We did well
recruiting. We were very fortunate."
Fortunate may be an understate
ment. The Cardinal brought in two of
the top three recruits in the nation —
Marianne Werdel and Eleni
Rossides.
Werdel, whose sister Alyce is a
senior on the Stanford team, was the
top recruit in the United States. She is
expected to make an immediate im
pact, as her No. 9 preseason national
ranking shows.
Werdel has won 18 national titles,
played in the main draw of the U.S.
Open and has defeated such profes
sionals as Carling Bassett and Bonnie
Gadusek.
Rossides, a native of Washington,
D.C., was a key recruit for the Card
inal, according to Brennan. "We had
an inside track on Werdel because
her sister goes here, but we were very
fortunate to pick up Rossides," Bren
nan said. "She was checking out Eas
tern schools, but finally she saw the
light."
Like Werdel, Rossides played in

the U.S. Open last summer. She is
No. 11 in the preseason individual
rankings.
Joining Rossides and Werdel in the
Stanford lineup will be a strong re
turning cast, led by junior Patty Fen
dick, a two-time Ail-American.
Fendick was 29-3 last season and
will play No. 1 singles and No. 1
doubles — with Eldredge — this year
for the Cardinal.
"I consider her to be the best
player in the country right now,"
Brennan said, adding that her No. 4
preseason rating is "kind of silly."
Eldredge, Rossides and Werdel
will play in the top four behind Fen
dick. Junior Stephanie Savides and
sophomore Kay Tittle — both
starters last season — will play at No.
5 and No. 6, respectively.
While the Cardinal singles lineup
has both experience and depth, the
doubles teams present a few ques
tion marks for Brennan, one of
which is how to replace Gates.
"Linda was simply the best doubles
player the last two years," Brennan
said.
Fendick and Eldredge were one of
the top tandems in the nation two
years ago, but last year they were split
up to allow Eldredge to play with
Gates. Brennan does not believe that
the year interruption will hurt the
two, though.
Marianne Werdel and Tittle will
play together, as will sophomore Cari
Hagey and Savides, to form the other
doubles teams. Werdel and Tittle
have not played much together, nor
nave Hagey and Savides. Thus, Bren
nan will be closely following the prog
ress of these teams. "If they can work
together, we should have an awesome
team," he said.
According to Brennan, another
factor in Stanford's season will be the
play of the freshmen.
"1 used to think if players had
played in the French Open and
Wimbledon before coming here, they
were veterans," Brennan said. "But I
found out that during their first col
lege match, they're a nervous wreck.
"It's a new experience, and you're
representing the school," he added.
"The college crowds are more vocal,
also. It's not a polite country-club at
mosphere."
Last season, the Cardinal had trou

ble with individual members compet
ing intensely to move up on the team
ladder. But this year s squad is more
relaxed.
"The challenge matches were not
as tense this year," Brennan said.
"There was more of a loose attitude
before the matches.
"This team is getting along pretty
well," he added. "What we try to in
still in the players is that they are
playing for Stanford."
Whether or not the Cardinal can
claim the national title again — and
thus avoid being upset in the early

rounds of the playoffs like last year —
remains to be seen. But everyone in
volved is confident.
"We're dead even right now with
USC," Brennan said. He then added,
however, "1 think we're due, and the
players feel that way.
"A lot of them are still pumped up
over the Trinity match (last year in
the playoffs)," he said. "I hear them
grumbling, '1 can't wait to play
Trinity'.
"We always have a chance to win it
(the championship)," Brennan said.
"We always expect to win it."

The potent 1984 doubles team of Leigh Anne Eldredge and Patty Fen

No. 2 singles for Stanford, teamed with Linda Gates to win the NCAA
doubles title.

ment. The Cardinal brought in two of
the top three recruits in the nation —
Marianne Werdel and Eleni
Rossides.
Werdel, whose sister Alyce is a
senior on the Stanford team, was the
top recruit in the United States. She is
expected to make an immediate im
pact, as her No. 9 preseason national
ranking shows.
Werdel has won 18 national titles,
played in the main draw of the U.S.
Open and has defeated such profes
sionals as Carling Bassett and Bonnie
Gadusek.
Rossides, a native of Washington,
D.C., was a key recruit for the Card
inal, according to Brennan. "We had
an inside track on Werdel because
her sister goes here, but we were very
fortunate to pick up Rossides," Bren
nan said. "She was checking out Eas
tern schools, but finally she saw the
light."
Like Werdel, Rossides played in

the U.S. Open last summer. She is
No. 11 in the preseason individual
rankings.
Joining Rossides and Werdel in the
Stanford lineup will be a strong re
turning cast, led by junior Patty Fen
dick, a two-time Ail-American.
Fendick was 29-3 last season and
will play No. 1 singles and No. 1
doubles — with Eldredge — this year
for the Cardinal.
"I consider her to be the best
player in the country right now,"
Brennan said, adding that her No. 4
preseason rating is "kind of silly."
Eldredge, Rossides and Werdel
will play in the top four behind Fen
dick. Junior Stephanie Savides and
sophomore Kay Tittle — both
starters last season — will play at No.
5 and No. 6, respectively.
While the Cardinal singles lineup
has both experience and depth, the
doubles teams present a few ques
tion marks for Brennan, one of
which is how to replace Gates.
"Linda was simply the best doubles
player the last two years," Brennan
said.
Fendick and Eldredge were one of
the top tandems in the nation two
years ago, but last year they were split
up to allow Eldredge to play with
Gates. Brennan does not believe that
the year interruption will hurt the
two, though.
Marianne Werdel and Tittle will
play together, as will sophomore Cari
Hagey and Savides, to form the other
doubles teams. Werdel and Tittle
have not played much together, nor
nave Hagey and Savides. Thus, Bren
nan will be closely following the prog
ress of these teams. "If they can work
together, we should have an awesome
team," he said.
According to Brennan, another
factor in Stanford's season will be the
play of the freshmen.
"1 used to think if players had
played in the French Open and
Wimbledon before coming here, they
were veterans," Brennan said. "But I
found out that during their first col
lege match, they're a nervous wreck.
"It's a new experience, and you're
representing the school," he added.
"The college crowds are more vocal,
also. It's not a polite country-club at
mosphere."
Last season, the Cardinal had trou

ble with individual members compet
ing intensely to move up on the team
ladder. But this year s squad is more
relaxed.
"The challenge matches were not
as tense this year," Brennan said.
"There was more of a loose attitude
before the matches.
"This team is getting along pretty
well," he added. "What we try to in
still in the players is that they are
playing for Stanford."
Whether or not the Cardinal can
claim the national title again — and
thus avoid being upset in the early

rounds of the playoffs like last year —
remains to be seen. But everyone in
volved is confident.
"We're dead even right now with
USC," Brennan said. He then added,
however, "1 think we're due, and the
players feel that way.
"A lot of them are still pumped up
over the Trinity match (last year in
the playoffs)," he said. "I hear them
grumbling, '1 can't wait to play
Trinity'.
"We always have a chance to win it
(the championship)," Brennan said.
"We always expect to win it."

Patty Fendick, a two-time All-American, is ranked fourth in the nation
entering the 1986 season. The possibility that three players might be
better than Fendick is "kind of silly," according to Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan.

The potent 1984 doubles team of Leigh Anne Eldredge and Patty Fen
dick will be reunited this season. Last year, Eldredge, who also plays
No. 2 singles for Stanford, teamed with Linda Gates to win the NCAA
doubles title.
The Stanford women's tennis team
commences what Coach Frank Bren
nan labels "our toughest year so far"
with opening-round action today in
the Riviera Collegiate Invitational in
Pacific Palisades.
"We don't really have any weak
spots on our schedule," Brennan said
as he sat in his office above the varsity
tennis courts Tuesday.
The Cardinal will be tested imme
diately in Riviera, an individual
tournament lasting through Sunday,
with several of the nation's finest
players competing in both singles and
doubles.

"Most of the good schools will be
there, with the exception of the
Florida schools," Brennan said.
Indeed, defending-champion USC,
No. 3 Texas, No. 5 Trinity, UCLA,
San Diego State and California will
all convene this weekend at Riviera.
And Stanford will see all of these
schools at least once later in the year
as well.
But don't start feeling sorry for
Brennan. He's certainly not feeling
sorry for himself. There's a reason for
his übiquitous grin. Playing a rigorous
schedule is the least Brennan could
do with the talent and depth he has at
his disposal this season.
The pollsters have recognized the
Cardinal's potential, ranking them

No. 1 with USC in the preseason poll.
And, though he knows that a long
season awaits his team, Brennan
would not trade places with any coach
in the nation.
"I'm very optimistic," he said. "We
have the players who are capable of
winning the national championship."
Prospects were not so bright last
May. The top-seeded Cardinal had
been eliminated in the NCAA quar
terfinals by a finely-tuned Trinity
team. "We might have been a little
too relaxed, but they played ab
solutely spectacularly," Brennan said.
"They sensed an upset."
Much of the disappointment from
the team results was alleviated by the
performance of senior Linda Gates in
the individual competition. Gates
defeated Trinity's Gretchen Rush for
the singles championship and
combined with Leigh Anne Eldredge
to capture the doubles title.
Gates, however, graduated in June,
leaving a major spot to fill on the
roster. Despite her graduation,
Brennan believes that this year's
Cardinal may yet compare favorably
with last year's team.
"Linda is quite a loss; she had a
pretty awesome record," Brennan
said. "(But) we're probably a little bit
stronger this season. We did well
recruiting. We were very fortunate."
