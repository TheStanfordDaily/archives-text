And so the Super Bowl has come and gone. Complete, unmitigated
domination. Truly sad. Camera angles brought us glum-looking Patriots
staring down at artificial ground. The grass was dead and so was New
England.
Fear not, Patriot fans. As Steve Miller so insightfully says, "Time
keeps on slippin' (and slippin") into the future." Definitely words to live
by-
Patriot fans can now rest easy, comfortably assured that Steve has
guaranteed them a repeat performance in the future. The horror, the
horror.
Unfortunately, another football game awaits us all this Sunday â€” the
NFL Pro Bowl. If it's not domination, ineptitude and boredom will
suffice. Sure, call me a space cowboy; it won't matter. Final score: NFC
11, AFC 6.
The highlights of the game will be a seven-yard scamper called back
because of holding and a 65-yard punt.
Rivalry exists between the two conferences, but this game certainly
doesn't showcase it. What does become apparent is how far an all-star
offense can progress after a week's worth of practice. Rome wasn't built
in a day, and Steve didn't compose an album in a day, then again

The defenses will be sound, only because of the predictability of the
offenses. There will not be any Buddy Ryan systems, only the ones
charted in Pop Warner. The placekicker will be the MVP.
The roar of the crowd will be stifled by its solitude. No "The Fridge
needs a repairman" signs or slogans about being number one. The Wave
will mimic a cesspool. The entire game will be one large mirage. The illu
sion will not be football.
Thankfully, Steve's future provides another all-star game, worthy of
its name. The NBA All-Star Game, the East versus the West. James
Worthy, The Doctor, Magic Johnson. It all happens Feb. 9 in Dallas.
This annual aerial show is, without doubt, the best of any all-star game.
Baseball fans will whimper a bit at that last statement, but then again,
who can take them seriously when someone like Kansas City's Steve
(Bye-Bye) Balboni starts in the World Series?
Granted, the NBA has Milwaukee's gravity reconfirmer Paul Mokeski
to hide, but he stays firmly-rooted on the pine as a third-string center.
And when he does play, he II run around a bit.
It's doubtful Mokeski will be named to either All-Star lineup (he's in
eligible for the Western Conference team). Others have already been se
lected in what promises to be an entertaining contest.
The game is a two-hour promotion of NBA basketball. High-flying
dunks, turnaround jumpers and sky hooks will pretty much characterize
this offensive spectacle.
Unlike the baseball or football all-star games, neither dull moments
nor dull hours, as the case may be, surface in this basketball ex
travaganza. These players are exceptionally-gifted athletes in a sport
