# Cardinal wastes no time vs. Gaels
## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
Last night in Moraga, the Stanford men's volley
ball team shocked no one by defeating St Mary's
and upping its record to 3-0 overall, 2-0 in Califor
nia Intercollegiate Volleyball Association play. The
suprising part was how quickly the Cardinal was
able to down the Gaels, who dropped to 1-4 overall
and 0-2 in league.
Stanford took the first game 15-5 in just 12
minutes. In that one, the Cardinal jumped out to an
11-0 lead before allowing St. Mary's to score.
In the second game, the Gaels held their only
lead in the entire match — 1-0 on a service ace.
Stanford, however, went up 9-1 and cruised to a
15-2 win.
It was the longest game of the match — 17
minutes.
The third game followed the same basic pattern.
The Cardinal took a 12-2 lead and went on to win
15-3. The final game lasted 13 minutes.
Apart from the brevity of the match, the Stan
ford victory was not unexpected. Not only is this
the Gaels' first year in the CIV A, the top volleyball
conference in the country, but it is also their first
season as a varsity team. Recruiting just began last
year at the school, as volleyball has been a club
sport in the past.
Also, St. Mary's was without the services of two
of its top players, Paul Beardon and Kevin
Maguire, who both should be back in action next
week.
"They missed their two best players," Stanford
Coach Fred Sturm said. "Few teams can afford
that."
But another reason for Stanford's easy victory
was the outstanding play of the Cardinal spikers
themselves. The hitting percentage for the entire
squad was .438, which is almost unheard of in col
legiate volleyball. That would be somewhat compa
rable to a baseball team composed completely of
.400 batters.
St. Mary's, on the other hand, had a team hitting
percentage of .073.
For the Cardinal, senior outside hitters Chris
Braun and Jon Root continued to lead the offen
sive attack, as each picked up eight kills. Senior
Brett Monello and sophomore Scott Fortune each
had six. Stanford came up with 10 service aces in
the match, five by Fortune.
Despite the ease of the Cardinal win, the St.
Mary's team has improved dramatically under the
direction of former Russian player and coach
Eugene Glazenberg. Now that they play in the
CIVA and are developing into a more sound squad,
the Gaels are no longer a pushover.
"In years past we have played loosely and didn't
take St. Mary's too seriously," Braun said. "This
year we took them seriously because they are a
much improved team.
"In the past, we've taken the first two games,
then relaxed in the third game and they've caused
us problems," Braun added. "Tonight we came out
and played consistently, as the results show. We
realize they will be much better when we play them

at Maples."
"Everyone played well tonight; it was a team ef
fort." said Sturm. "You've got to give Stanford
credit, they never let them (the Gaels) in the
match. I understand there are a lot of new faces on

(St. Mary's) team; it will take them time to gel.
Stanford just played well from start to finish."
The Cardinal's next match is at UC-Santa Bar
bara next Wednesday. The Gauchos are ranked
fourth in the nation.

Setter Steve Modory and outside hitter Stephen Blue barely broke a sweat in last night's 42-
minute match against St. Mary's. There were some moments of suspense, however. The Gaels
did have the lead at one point. They opened up the second game with a 1-0 lead.
