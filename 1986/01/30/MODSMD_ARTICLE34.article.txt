# Men gymnasts rise to top spot in nation
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
It is often said that the best things
in life are worth waiting for. In the
case of Stanford Men's Gymnastics
Coach Sadao Hamada, the wait was
14 years long, but the Cardinal men
tor's patience has finally paid off.
For the first time ever, Stanford has
the No. 1 men's gymnastics team in
the nation.
The team gained the top spot on
the strength of last weekend's upset
of UCLA, now ranked No. 2. The
Cardinal recorded a team score of
278.20, the highest total in the
country this year, to oust the Bruins,
who scored 276.9.
What made the triumph even more
impressive was that it was accom
plished at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion,
which usually is as hard on opposing
gymnastics teams as it was on basket
ball teams during the John Wooden
era.
Once Stanford's 278.20 score was
in the books, the No. 1 ranking was
inevitable. The ratings are based on

each team's top performance of the
season.
"This is the best team Stanford has
ever fielded," Hamada said. "We still
have plenty of room for improve
ment, but I think this team has the
potential to win the national champi
onship."
Both last year, when the Cardinal
established itself as a national power
with a seventh-place NCAA finish,
and last weekend may be instrumen
tal in bringing not only the 1986 title
to Stanford but future championships
as well.
"Last year, because we did so very
well, we were able to recruit well,"
Hamada said. "It (the No. 1 ranking)
will help the whole future develop
ment of the Stanford gymnastics
team."
Freshmen Andy Ropp and Scott
Schaffer have provided depth, but the
mainstays of the team have been vet
erans. "(Junior) Randy Besosa and
(senior) Jon Louis are definitely our
leaders, and (senior) Gary Smith had
some tremendous performances last
weekend," Hamada said. "Those
three guys are our key guys."

Led by junior Randy Besosa, the Stanford men's gymnastics team has
pummelled the opposition all season. The Cardinal is 6-0 and has
vaulted to the No. 1 spot in the nation for the first time ever. Obviously,
the squad has not been horsing around.
