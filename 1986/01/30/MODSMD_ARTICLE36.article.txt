# Men to tee off in Tucson
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Hoping to repeat the strong play of Tuesday's final
round of the UC-Santa Barbara Intercollegiate, the Stan
ford men's golf team takes to the greens today in the
Michelob National Invitational in Tucson, Ariz.
The Cardinal rallied to finish third in the UCSB tourna
ment but faces tough competition today on the 7,000-
yard, par-72 Tucson National Golf Club course.
"It's a stronger field (than at UCSB)," Stanford Coach
Tim Schaaf said. "It's much more of an intersectional
field. We're facing teams quite a bit out of our district.
The University of North Carolina, for example, we'll be
facing for only the second time since I've been here.
"It's an opportunity to strengthen, or weaken for that
matter, our position in the national rankings," he said.
The featured team in the 54-hole tournament is top
ranked USC. Though the Trojans lost in Santa Barbara by
two strokes to Fresno State, they still finished a whopping
28 shots ahead of third-place Stanford.
USC is led by Sam Randolph, who carries a host of
honors, including 1985 U.S. Amateur Champion, 1985
NCAA runner-up, and low scoring amateur at the 1985
Masters. However, Randolph shot a 79 in the final round
in Santa Barbara that contributed to USC's downfall,
proving that he is not infallible.

Stanford will counter with Carl Wagner, who tied for
second place at the UCSB tournament by firing a total of
219, two strokes better than Randolph. Don Walsworth.
who notched a 74 on Tuesday, also figures to be in the
thick of things.
Other worthy linksters playing this weekend are
Arizona State's Rich Beitz, Texas-El Paso's Rick Todd,
Ariror»cic' Curart7 Orpoon's Georee Davis. UNCTs
Greg Parker and last year's tournament winner, Mike
Springer of host Arizona.
The rest of Stanford's lineup includes Rich Marik, Brad
Geer, Roger Miraglia and Casey Pittock. For the latter
two, this has been their first week of intercollegiate play.
"Casey and Roger have both shown very strong im
provement over the fall in breaking into the lineup,"
Schaaf said.
"They may find it an overwhelming experience,"
Schaaf added, "(though) they've actually been playing
pretty well. You may see a funny score here or there, but
it's definitely not a weak lineup."
Miraglia shot a fine round of 75 on Tuesday to finish
the tournament at 229, the third lowest total on the team.
Pittock's three-day total was 241.
It should be noted that nearly all of the Cardinal's low
individual scores were compiled in that final round. The
squad will have to continue to play well, and avoid the in
consistent play of the tournament's first two rounds, if it
hopes to find success in Arizona.
