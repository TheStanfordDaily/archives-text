# Giants will stay

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€”
The San Francisco Giants an
nounced yesterday they will play
their 1986 schedule in windy,
foggy Candlestick Park, despite
owner Bob Lurie's vow last year
that the team would never take the
field there again.
"We've been struggling with
this thing too long a time," said
Lurie from the Spyglass Hill Golf
Course at Pebble Beach, where he
was practicing for the AT&T
Pebble Beach Pro-Am. "Now we
just want to sell tickets and have a
competitive team."
In a statement released earlier,
Lurie said he felt last October that
nothing could have made him
keep his team at Candlestick for
another season.
Why the change in attitude?
"Two things have occurred
which have caused me to change
my mind: First, I firmly believe an
agreement is within reach that will

lead to construction of a new
downtown stadium; second, new
president and general manager Al
Rosen and new manager Roger
Craig have brought a promise of
excitement to the team that Bay
Area fans deserve to see," the
statement said.
On the golf course, Lurie said
negotiations with the city have
made progress.
"We're negotiating with the
mayor to get a place we can
survive in," he said. "Our last
meeting was on Saturday. There
has been progress.
"I'm concerned with the public
and want them to understand that
we want to stay in San Francisco
and the Bay Area. ... We plan to
stay here."
Mayor Dianne Feinstein wished
the team well, and said she was
"delighted to hear the news that
the Giants will remain at Candles
tick Park for the 1986 season."
