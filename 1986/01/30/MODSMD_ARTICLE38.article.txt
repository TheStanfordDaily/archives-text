# Rain cancels baseball game
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
Yesterday's game between Stan
ford and the University of the Pacific
was cancelled due to rain.
But fear not, Tiger boosters, UOP
has been granted a return engage
ment. The Tigers, 16-36 a year ago,
and the Cardinal will make up the
rainout here on April 16 at 2:30 p.m.
The weather spoiled Kevin
Kunkel's chance to start on the
mound for Stanford and perhaps win
a spot in the starting rotation. Rob
Wassenaar was also slated to pitch, as
was freshman Brian Keyser.
They'll have to wait at least until
Friday, when Stanford begins a three
game weekend series with Fullerton
State at Sunken Diamond.
Card notes
Cardinal Coach Mark Marquess
has named junior Al Osuna as his
starter for Saturday's game against
Fullerton.
