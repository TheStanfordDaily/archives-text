New government controls Uganda
KAMPALA, Uganda — Before several thousand jubilant Ugandans
who filled a plaza still littered with the spent shell casings of his invasion,
Yoweri Museveni was sworn in yesterday as president and declared that
he represented a break from Uganda's bloody tradition of government
sponsored murder.
Bodies of soldiers of the undisciplined Ugandan army that had long
terrorized the country's civilians lay in shallow graves and on roadsides
on the outskirts of Kampala, where they fell to the guerrilla forces of
Museveni, a former high school teacher who fled to the bush five years
ago to fight what he called an "evil" regime.
With a legacy of two decades of government-condoned looting and
rape and an estimated half-million countrymen killed by armies of a se
ries of dictatorships, residents of Kampala were saying yesterday that
they were both grateful and amazed at the disciplined behavior of
Museveni's forces.
The 41-year-old guerrilla leader, who proudly says he modeled his
fighting techniques after Cuba's Fidel Castro, said in his inaugural
speech that "nobody should state that what is happening today, what has
been happening in the last few days, is a mere change of guards."
"I think this is a fundamental change in the politics of our country," he
said.
But other than promising to guarantee human rights and to quash the
tribal and religious rivalries that have been a source of much of Uganda's
violent history, Museveni's speech contained few details about what kind
of government he will create. He promised a return to parliamentary
democracy, but gave no timetable for elections, and he has not yet ap
pointed new government ministers.
It is estimated that in the past 20 years, under the regimes of presi
dents Idi Amin and Milton Obote, about half a million Ugandans were
killed, most of them by soldiers and security officials. In that time, most
of the country's public works were destroyed.
Rebels now control S. Yemen
ADEN, South Yemen — The stench of death still lingers in the shut
tered streets of the South Yemeni capital, but rebel forces have crushed
all opposition by the forces of deposed strongman Ali Nasser Hasani and
are consolidating their authority after the brief but devastating civil war
in the Middle East's only Marxist state.
A new provisional government under interim President Haider Abu
Bakr Attas, who was prime minister under Hasani, is in full control of
Aden and claims to have authority throughout the countryside, including
the key province of Abyan, Hasani's last bastion of support.
The port of Aden, littered with the blackened hulks of sunken vessels,
reopened Sunday. By Monday, the first planeloads of food and medical
supplies were arriving from Moscow aboard special Aeroflot fights.
There they found a capital still bearing the scars of nearly two weeks
of fierce fighting that was touched off, according to authoritative sources
here, when Hasani tried to eliminate his political opponents in a pre
emptive attack Jan. 13.
The number of dead is believed by local observers to exceed 12,000.
The bodies have been buried in two mass graves, but the stench of rot
ting flesh still pervades many areas of the city.
Authoritative sources added that Moscow is supporting the new gov
ernment now that it appears to be firmly in control.
The composition of the new government, however, is still not clear.
Attas, who was in India and then flew to Moscow when the fighting
erupted, returned Monday to head the new government in line with an
agreement secured by Moscow among the rebel factions.
However, he is described by one knowledgeable source as a
"compromise interim figure" while the new government, which is being
called simply as the "collective leadership" is being formed.
Arab gunman attacks Israelis
JERUSALEM — An Arab gunman slipped across the Jordan River
and ambushed an Israeli army patrol early yesterday, killing two soldiers
and wounding two others before he was shot and killed, the Israeli mili
tary command announced.
It was the most serious such incident on the border with Jordan in al
most five years, and it may increase tension between Israel and Jordan at
a time when the United States is trying to arrange peace negotiations be
tween the two.
An Israeli army statement said the gunman carried papers "which give
rise to the possibility that he was a soldier in the Joidanian army." It said
the attacker "crossed the river near an outpost of the Jordanian army."
A military spokesman said it was not clear whether the man had help
in infiltrating into Israeli-occupied territory and that it was not uncertain
that the papers he carried were genuine.
The early morning attack came as Jordan's King Hussein met in Am
man for a fourth straight day with Yasser Arafat, chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organization. The two men are said to be seeking a
common position on Washington's effort to get discussions going on a
comprehensive Middle East peace.
In an apparent attempt to retaliate against terrorism, Israeli warplanes
bombed the sprawling Palestinian refugee camp of Ain Hilweh near
Sidon in southern Lebanon Wednesday, killing five persons and injuring
six, radio stations reported here.
The jets struck at 6:25 a.m., 24 hours after Israeli military sources re
ported that a large number of Palestinians had returned to south
Lebanon.
It was the first time the camp had been raided since Israeli forces
withdrew from Sidon in March 1985.
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, on a visit to Berlin, justified the
raid as a blow to a "center of terrorists." He pointed out two Israeli sol
diers had been killed on the Jordanian border during the day. The sol
diers were killed shortly after the raid took place.
Israeli would take all steps to deter such deaths, he said. Asked by
Deutsche Presse-Agentur if such strikes endangered his initiative for
peace talks with Jordan, Peres replied that he still had to obtain details
of yesterday's action.
Firms accused of violating ban
TRIPOLI, Libya — Four major American oil companies operating
here have stopped shipping Libyan crude, but in effect have undercut
President Reagan's embargo by "loaning" or selling their production to
other oil companies, diplomats and industry sources said yesterday.
Libyan, West German, Italian and other oil companies have taken
over the roughly 20 percent share of Libya's production involving
American firms, according to the sources, who requested anonymity.
They said this allowed Libya to maintain its output of 1.2 million barrels
per day.
The arrangements technically complied with the president's executive
order to end all American transactions with Libya, the sources said, but
violated its spirit. This puts the Administration in "an embarrassing sit
uation," a source said, following the European Community's rejection
Tuesday of U.S. demands that its members embargo Libyan oil.
"The net result is that the action of the American companies," a
Western oil official said, "is having absolutely no effect on Libya's over
all income from oil export." Almost all Libyan oil is exported to Europe,
Africa and Asia. Now awaiting what the sources termed imminent State
Department approval, the deal on passing along production involves Oc
cidental, Amerada Hess, Conoco and Marathon.
Grace, a fifth American oil company that accounts for less than a
tenth of the American companies' estimated total production of 240,000
barrels a day here, apparently is not party to the deal.
