# Voyager data reveals methane clouds

A layer of methane clouds lies deep within
the atmosphere of the planet Uranus, a team
of Stanford researchers reported yesterday.
The researchers, who studied data col
lected from the radio transmissions of the
NASA probe Voyager 2, also determined
that at least one of the rings of the giant
planet is composed of dark particles more
than one meter in diameter.
G. Leonard Tyler, research professor of

electrical engineering, said the radio signals
from Voyager managed to penetrate the top
cloud layer of Uranus and discern different
atmospheric layers.
Data was obtained as Voyager passed be
hind the planet. Radio signals from the
spacecraft were beamed back toward the
earth and passed through the edge of
Uranus' cloud layer, diffracting or bending
as they went. By determining the pattern in
which the signals were blocked and measur
ing the amount of diffraction which oc
curred, the scientists have begun to deter

mine the distribution, nature and density of
the material in the clouds.
The same technique was used to deter
mine the size of the particles in the largest of
the planet's rings, named epsilon.
Von Eshleman, professor of electrical en
gineering and one of the members of the re
search team, said that preliminary results
show that a large methane cloud deep within
the atmosphere completely encircles the
planet. The cloud's temperature seems to be
about -191° C (approximately -312° F).
Eshleman said that radio signals with

varying wavelengths were beamed through
Uranus' epsilon ring. The pattern of distur
bance of the signals indicates that the ring
particles are comparatively larger than the
signal wavelengths, or about one meter in
diameter and larger.
"It's conceivable that these particles are
mostly methane ice," Eshleman said. The
reason that the particles are so dark, he spec
ulated, could be that radiation from space
has changed some of the methane in the par-
