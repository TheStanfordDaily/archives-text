# S. Africa limits political freedom
## Buttons, bumper stickers, T-shirts now illegal in South Africa 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Political
badges, bumper stickers and T-shirts were
outlawed yesterday by the police in Cape Town in
advance of the opening session tomorrow of the
South African parliament.
Brigadier Chris Swart, the Cape Town police
commissioner, banned until mid-February the dis
play or distribution of "any placard, banner,
sticker, pamphlet, clothing or similar object on or
in which any viewpoint of a political nature or in re
lation to any system of government or constitu
tional policy is expressed, advocated or
propagated."
Under South Africa's six-month-old state of
emergency, which gives the police virtually martial
law powers, anyone convicted of violating Swart's
order may be jailed for up to 10 years and fined the
equivalent of $10,000. Swart's order may not be
challenged in court under the emergency regula
tions.
So sweeping is Swart s decree — only
newspapers are exempt — that anyone guilty of
violatina it rould be arrested, prosecuted and im

prisoned, almost summarily, under South Africa's
severe security laws. This could include anyone
wearing a popular badge that urges "Make love,
not war," or a popular T-shirt from the United
Democratic Front coalition of anti-apartheid
groups that shows a white hand clasping a black
one.
Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, leader of the liberal
white opposition Progressive Federal Party,
denounced the action as "probably the most absurd
and ridiculous instruction ever issued by this gov
ernment."
Slabbert accused the government of attempting
to curtail criticism of it during parliamentary
debate on its basic policies. President Pieter Botha
is scheduled to open the parliamentary session to
morrow with a speech outlining his plans for fur
ther political reforms, which are to be debated over
the next 10 days.
Louis le Grange, the minister for law and order,
refused earlier yesterday to lift the state of emer
gency in the Cape Town area before the parliamen
tary meeting. Opposition members had objected to

meeting under such conditions and to the suspen
sion of South Africa's limited civil rights.
"When it is clear that law and order is being
maintained, it will be considered," Le Grange said.
"That time hasn't arrived yet."
Swart, who before Christmas prohibited caroling
and candlelight services as subversive, and later
defended the indefinite detention without trial of
11- and 13-year-old boys as necessary for state se
curity, was personally named to the Cape Town
post by Le Grange to crack down on opposition
groups there.
Slabbert, who in parliamentary debate will focus
on the state of emergency, the continued unrest
and the government's failure to implement broader
reforms, commented: "Has this government any
idea how ridiculous it must be for a South African
to have to explain this action to intelligent people
elsewhere in the world? I always try to comfort
myself that this government cannot come up with
anything more stupid than they have just done, but
they always manage to disappoint me."
