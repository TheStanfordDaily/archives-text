# Lyng nominated for agriculture post
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan announced yesterday that he
would nominate fellow Californian
Richard Lyng, a longtime Republican
ally and policy adviser, to succeed
John Block as secretary of
agriculture.
Lyng, who resigned as deputy sec
retary a year ago to set up a consult
ing firm, is expected to win easy con
firmation in the Senate, where he is
popular and well-regarded.
In an Oval Office meeting to pres
ent Lyng to the news media, Reagan
said farmers would have a "sound
and solid friend" in Lyng as he moves
to administer new farm laws that
"will help get farming more into the
market economy and rectify some of
the things that have been wrong."

Administration sources indicated
that the choice of Lyng — easy-going
and politically low-profile —
reflected a desire to avoid more
animosity in the economically
troubled Midwestern farm states,
where many GOP House and Senate
candidates expert difficulty in fall
elections.
Reagan's selection of Lyng
heightened speculation that John
Norton, deputy secretary who has
major farming interests in California
and Arizona, would be pressured out
of the administration and replaced
with a more politically palatable
Midwesterner.
Norton, in lowa and unavailable
for comment, has indicated that he
might leave Washington because of

economic difficulties on his farms, al
though he also was interested in
succeeding Block.
Capitol Hill sources are floating the
name of Duane Acker, president of
Kansas Stale University, as a new
deputy secretary.
Block, who will leave the adminis
tration Feb. 14, increasingly had been
criticized by farm-belt Republicans as
a political liability as he spearheaded
the White House drive to lower
federal farm-support spending and
make U.S. crops more competitive
overseas.
That tension was noted yesterday
by Rep. Edward Madigan (111) top
Republican member of the House
Agriculture Committee.
Madigan said he hopes that Lyng

"will be able to be more effective
politically than (Block) was" because
of Lyng's longstanding ties to
Reagan.
Block, who reportedly will take a
job next month with a food-trade as
sociation here, "applauded"
Reagan's choice of Lyng as "a
proven, experienced, highly capable
individual."
Lyng, 67, was director of the Cali
fornia agriculture department when
Reagan was governor. Lyng was an
assistant agriculture secretary in the
Nixon administration and an
agriculture adviser in Reagan's 1980
presidential campaign. He became
deputy secretary, second in command
at the Agriculture Department, in
1981.
