Tax panel airs concern
WASHINGTON — Members of the Senate
Finance Committee, hearing from three
economists that tax revision would depress busi
ness investment, expressed strong fears yesterday
about the economic effects of the House-passed
tax overhaul bill.
Although their comments raised fresh doubts
about whether the committee can reach agree
ment, Chairman Bob Packwood (R —Ore.) con
tinued to assure reporters that the committee will
easily approve a bill acceptable to President
Reagan.
As the committee opened a series of hearings
on tax overhaul, most members expressed con
cern that the House bill would undermine the in
ternational competitiveness of U.S. industry.
They challenged Reagan's goals of dramatically
reducing tax rates and shifting some of the
income tax burden away from individuals to cor
porations.
The Finance Committee is expected to begin
drafting its own tax bill in early March. Changing
the House bill to satisfy the wishes of Reagan and
Senate tax writers could cost as much as $ 130 bil
lion over five years, according to Administration
officials.
Reagan seeks more aid
WASHINGTON — Members of Congress ex
pressed outrage yesterday when they were told
that the Reagan Administration plans to seek
more than $1 billion in additional foreign aid at a
time when domestic programs are being cut.
William Schneider, undersecretary of for
security assistance, touched off the controversy
by telling members of the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee during a closed hearing that the
increased aid request will be part of the fiscal
1987 budget President Reagan intends to submit
next week.

Schneider declined to disclose how much addi
tional money the administration would request,
according to those who attended the hearing. But
members of the committee later obtained a copy
of a draft proposal from the State Department
calling for a $1.3 billion increase in foreign assis
tance in fiscal 1987 — including a 100 percent in
crease in military aid for the Philippines.
A spokesman for Sen. Richard Lugar (R-
Ind.), chairman of the Foreign Relations Com
mittee, said committee members told Schneider
they were shocked that the Administration would
seek an increase in foreign aid at the same time
that Congress is committed to trimming up to
$70 billion from the federal budget under the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
Presser may be guilty
CLEVELAND — Federal prosecutors, strug
gling to keep their labor fraud case against
Teamsters president Jackie Presser alive at a time
when they still had not been told the full truth
about the FBl's role in the controversial affair,
warned in a secret memorandum that the FBI
might have created problems which could — and
ultimately did — permit the union leader to go
free.
Expressing concern that failure to indict Pres
ser could tarnish the integrity of the Justice De
partment and the Reagan Administration, the
prosecutors raised the possibility that FBI agents
might have overstepped their authority if they
had promised the union boss immunity from pro
secution.
Shuttle debris found
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — The Coast
Guard Cutter Point Roberts docked at the small
Air Force Station here late yesterday to unload
600 pounds of green, white and black debris.
The cutter Dallas later reported finding a

cone-shaped object, not immediately identified.
Dozens of pieces of the shuttle have been
found floating in the ocean, including several
large ones. The largest so far, about 15 by 15
feet, looks like aluminum, according to Air Force
Master Sgt. Charles Miller. "But most of them
are small, some are pipe-shaped, some are
definitely tiles and a lot of it is a styrofoam-type
material."
NASA spokesmen said they "cannot say" what
parts of the shuttle assembly the pieces came
from because they have not been studied by
specialists yet.
"They've only been handled, so far, by sailors
and wharf hands and truck drivers," said Air
Force Col. Bob Nicholson.
"Specialists trained in sorting through debris
can tell more than you or I can believe," said an
Air Force spokesman.
No items linked to the shuttle crew — helmets,
clothing — have been found.
The haul from the sea will help piece together
the mystery of the explosion, much as in an
airplane crash, he said. It can help pinpoint the
areas that may have been distorted or disin
tegrated when hit first and hardest by the explo
sion. Fractures can point to places of special
stress or to the explosion itself. Distortion of
pieces can fill in further detail on the character of
the blow out.
Stocks finish mixed
NEW YORK — The stock market finished
mixed yesterday after flirting with new highs
early in a turbulent session.
The New York Stock Exchange had its busiest
day in nearly 18 months, and its third most active
ever, as traders sought to assess the outlook for
interest rates.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose
2.52 to 1,558.94, recording its fifth straight gain.
But some other, broader market measures tilted
slightly to the minus side.
