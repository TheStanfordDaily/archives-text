Hostage-taker charged
MARTINEZ — A man who used a gun
to force a nurse to remove his 69-year-old father
from a life support system has been charged with
voluntary manslaughter in his death.
District Attorney Gary Yancey said yesterday
that Edward Baker's father "had a reasonable
and significant chance of recovery" from cancer
of the esophagus before Baker forced the
removal of a respirator that was helping the older
man breathe.
Baker, 37, remained free on $10,000 bond
yesterday. Yancey said he would be arraigned on
the new charge on Feb. 4.
Baker earlier was charged with assault with a
firearm and false imprisonment of Florence
Deßego, the nurse at whose head he allegedly
pointed a loaded .38-caliber pistol.
Police say Baker entered Brookside Hospital
in San Pablo on Dec. 21 and took the nurse

hostage while oidcring a second nurse, Jackie
Higginbotham, to disconnect the respirator and
let his father "die with dignity." Police said his
father, Edward Baker, died within minutes.
Bell wants to up rates
SAN FRANCISCO - Pacific Bell asked the
state Public Utilities Commission yesterday to
reconsider a decrease it ordered in telephone
rates earlier this month and instead raise the
average customer's bill by about $1 a month.
The effect of the request is to delay the effect
of the PUC action by at least two months. The
commission's order had been scheduled to take
effect Feb. 9 and lower the average Pacific Bell
phone bill by three cents. The company has 9
million customers.
Pacific Bell said the PUC had made factual and
mathematical errors adding up to $213 million.
If the PUC allowed all the requested changes,

the net effect would be a rate increase of about 4
percent, or $1 a month on the average bill, said
Mike Revelle, Pacific Bell's executive director
for state regulatory programs.
The company had applied for a rate increase of
$471 million, or 12.83 percent. The PUC
rejected the request on Jan. 10 and ordered a
decrease, saying the company was seeking ex
cessive profits for stockholders and could cut
costs in operations, maintenance and labor.
The commission actually ordered a reduction
of nearly $124 million, to be partly offset by a
$94 million increase aproved earlier to pay for
long-distance companies' access to local phone
lines.
Weather now in Update
Showers are expected today and tonight
throughout much of the Bay Area, with highs in
the 50s and lows tonight in the 40s.
