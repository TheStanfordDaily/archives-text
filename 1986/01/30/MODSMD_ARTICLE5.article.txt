# This directory is notable

Rock 'n roll lore, it seems, is full of
chance meetings that lead to stardom.
The Beatles, Bruce Springsteen and
the E Street Band, The Who — all
got their start, legend has it, with
fateful meetings in sweaty bars.

But if junior Steve Hays has any
thing to say about it. meetings of
musicians in the future — around
Stanford at least — will involve less
chance and more planning.
Mays has been in White Plaza for
the last few days collecting signups

for the Stanford Musicians' Direc
tory, which will make it easier for
"musicians to find each other and or
ganize groups," according to Hays.
"The directory will be a listing of
musicians in the Stanford area," he
said. It will be available at the Stan
ford Information Shelf in Meyer
when it is completed.
Hays, who plays saxophone and
keyboards for "The Altar Boys," a
local band, said he got the idea
for such a directory when he tried to
start a new band of his own and
realized that "there was no real place
to go."
He decided on the idea of a
musicians' directory after he had tried
several other methods of advertising

and found that none were effective.
"I did everything, including plaster
ing the campus with flyers," he said.
"There are a lot of people out there
who want to be in a band." he ex
plained. "Hopefully, this directory
will help them find other musicians
with ideas and interests similar to
their own."
"It's a community kind of thing.
Basically, I'm doing this as a
service," he added, explaining that
the directory could also be used "as a
party resource."
"I've had a few people helping me,
but basically it's been a one-man
show putting this thing together,"
Hays said. He also noted that he is in
the process of organizing the Stanford
Musicians Directory into a registered
student group in order to get ASSU
funding.
According to Hays, 175 musicians
have signed up to be listed in the
directory so far. Each person that
signs up must fill out a "Musician In
formation Sheet."

When the project is finished
(sometime late next week, according
to Hays), all the sheets will be
available in Meyer. On the sheet will
be such information as the respon
dent's musical interests, ability and
experience.
Hays noted that the directory "is
shaping up to be pretty diverse."
"Professors, students, just random
people from the area (have signed
up)," he said. "And not all of them
are rock 'n' roll musicians, either.
More than one person wanted to play
Irish Celtic music."

Hays also noted that there is a
"whole range of seriousness" among
those who signed up. "Some people
are really into it,"he said. "But a lot
of people aren't willing to give a big
time commitment, especially around
Stanford."
As to whether his idea will spawn
the supergroup of the 19905, Hays is
hopeful.
"I'm hoping to be one of those
groups," he said.
Hays said he will continue to
take signups for the directory today
and tomorrow, weather permitting.
