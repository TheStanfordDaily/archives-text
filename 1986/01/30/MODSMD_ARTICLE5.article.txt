# This directory is notable

Rock 'n roll lore, it seems, is full of
chance meetings that lead to stardom.
The Beatles, Bruce Springsteen and
the E Street Band, The Who — all
got their start, legend has it, with
fateful meetings in sweaty bars.

But if junior Steve Hays has any
thing to say about it. meetings of
musicians in the future — around
Stanford at least — will involve less
chance and more planning.
Mays has been in White Plaza for
the last few days collecting signups

for the Stanford Musicians' Direc
tory, which will make it easier for
"musicians to find each other and or
ganize groups," according to Hays.
"The directory will be a listing of
musicians in the Stanford area," he
said. It will be available at the Stan
ford Information Shelf in Meyer
when it is completed.
Hays, who plays saxophone and
keyboards for "The Altar Boys," a
local band, said he got the idea
for such a directory when he tried to
start a new band of his own and
realized that "there was no real place
to go."
He decided on the idea of a
musicians' directory after he had tried
several other methods of advertising

and found that none were effective.
"I did everything, including plaster
ing the campus with flyers," he said.
"There are a lot of people out there
who want to be in a band." he ex
plained. "Hopefully, this directory
will help them find other musicians
with ideas and interests similar to
their own."
"It's a community kind of thing.
Basically, I'm doing this as a
service," he added, explaining that
the directory could also be used "as a
party resource."
"I've had a few people helping me,
but basically it's been a one-man
show putting this thing together,"
