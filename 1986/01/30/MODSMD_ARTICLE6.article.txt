# Scholar: Whites will concede rule

South African whites will let a black government
come to power in their country before allowing racial
tensions there to "explode," visiting scholar
Masipula Sithole said yesterday.
Sithole is the senior lecturer of political science at
the University of Zimbabwe and is dean of that
school's faculty of social studies.
In his speech yesterday at the Bechtel International
Centers Africa Table, Sithole pointed out that the
whites in South Africa are a group of "rational"
people. He said that "they will sec that their survival is
threatened." and will ask themselves, "Is this a cause

worth dying for?"
Sithole predicted that the whites will decide black
rule is better than "dying or a racist cause, since they
are hardly a suicide squad."
He stressed, however, that the whites will not gain
this insight instantly. To emphasize his point he
compared the South African situation to that of Zim
babwe in the late 19705.
There, blacks overcame white rule, but were assisted
by three conditions. In Zimbabwe there was a
"military stalemate, an economic squeeze and a domi
nant third party" who directed negotiations between

the two sides.
In South Africa, these conditions do not exist to the
degree necessary for settlement, according to Sithole.
The South African government has a strong military,
while the blacks have no unified forces. Instead, they
rely on sporadic riots to attract attention.
The United States is applying some economic pres
sure, he said, but the South African economy is largely
self-sufficient and is not ready to collapse.
In addition, the powerful, aggressive third party that
Sithole claims is necessary for settlement of the conflict
is not present. In Zimbabwe, Britian had this role.
He said that Bishop Desmund Tutu's visit to
America, which included his stop at Stanford, was di
rected at placing the U.S. into the position of
negotiator.
