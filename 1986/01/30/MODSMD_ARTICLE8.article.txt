## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
The ASSU special elections Tues
day and yesterday showed a "good
turnout" according to Maria Hun
talas, elections commissioner in
charge of operations. Preliminary
election results will be announced at
noon today.
Huntalas said more students than
usual voted in this special election,
which included plans for a new ASSU
constitution and a move to divest
ASSU funds in companies that do
business in South Africa.

"Special elections turnouts are
usually not good," she said. Huntalas
added that yesterday's rain did not
seem to affect the number of students
voting.
"People are going to get to the
polls regardless. 1 can see where the
rain might have made the poll sites
harder to see, since they were under
canopies or overhangs, but I don't
think that stopped people from
voting," she said.
Senate Chair Carey White offered
an estimation that "a couple of
thousand" of students voted in this
week's elections. He said a more ac

curate figure will be available today
when preliminary results are an
nounced.
White said the Elections Commis
sion "did an excellent job," even
though none of the commissioners
had any previous experience organiz
ing an election.
White also lauded the Stanford
Christian Fellowship (SCF) for doing
a "great job" working at the poll
sites. The Elections Commission con
tracts the SCF every year for poll
watching. and this year marked ex
ceptional efficiency in the voting
process, according to White.
