The five women sat perched on the edge of
a table, wearing white adidas sweatsuits and flash
ing smiles. The ears and eyes of the other 35
women in the room were cast upon them, silently
absorbing every word that was said.
The women in the crowd came to Branner Hall
last night to hear this year's Dollies tell what it
takes to become one of the five most recognized
women at Stanford. The informational meeting
was the first in a series of events that lead to the
selection of next year's Dollies by members of
The Band on March 1.
The Dollies told the hopeful women that ex
tensive dancing ability is not essential for being
selected as a Dollie.
"That (dance training) doesn't mean any
thing,' said Dollie Arija Bareikis, encouraging
the women to "definitely try (to be a Dollie), it's
fun to try."
Dollie Jeanine Gaylord told women who have

no dancing experience not to "get scared away by
that at all."
Two qualities that do seem to count toward
being a Dollie, however, are camaraderie and an
understanding that the Dollies are a part of The
Band.
"Basically and most importantly, we are mem
bers of The Band," Bareikis said, adding that
"being a Dollie is being part of The Band."
"We've had a great year, because we all made
an effort to get along with The Band added
Dollie Anne O'Brien.
And while Bareikis told the audience that
being a Dollie was "a wonderful experience,"
senior Laurie Elliott, the only Dollie this year
who is not a sophomore, cautioned the women
about the sizeable time commitment that comes
with the job.
Elliott said the Dollies practice three hours a
day, five to seven days a week during the spring,
and they work out four times a week for four
hours a day during the fall.

The days of home football games are often the
most hectic, Elliott said, stating that in addition
to performing during the game, the Dollies
practice in the morning and perform again in
rallies after the game. She said the Dollies also
perform at alumni functions and at rallies away
from the University.
Elliott called being a Dollie "an academic
strain," noting that she took 12 units during the
fall quarter, including the two units she received
for being a Dollie.
Oaylord explained the Dollies' summer activi
ties, noting that this year's group arrived at the
University on Aug. 14 to stay with "Dollie
families. . . who live around this area."
While Gaylord called the summer experience
"a blast," she added that the women worked on
routines six hours each day during the month.
"We make up all our routines. We don't have
a coach like a lot of other schools do," said Dollie
Susan Inge, noting that each year's Dollies create
new routines in addition to four or five routines
that are passed along each year.
