# Traces of chemicals present in wells

Tests of well water from the Barron
Park residential area in Palo Alto
have revealed traces of toxic chemi
cals, but in concentrations well within
state safety limits, according to Uni
versity Property Manager Lisa Bur
nett:
The contamination is linked to the
site of Watkins-Johnson Co., a
private research company that leases
land from the Stanford Research
Park, an industrial area near Barron
Park. The contamination was first de
tected in June 1984, when the com
pany found unsafe levels of three
toxic chemicals near an underground
gas tank.
The tests at Barron Park, per
formed three weeks ago on six wells,
were ordered to determine whether
the contamination has spread to
nearby residential well water.
The water at the Watkins-Johnson
site contained trichloroethyline
(TCE), trichloroethane (TCA),
dichloroethylene and freon 113.
TCE, TCA and dichloroethylene are
known to be carcinogenic.
The Barron Park tests revealed
three wells with TCE in levels ranging
from .65 to 2.2 parts per billion
(ppb). Acceptable levels of the
chemical set by the California De
partment of Health Services (DOHS)
is 5 ppb.
The tests showed no dichloroet
hylene or freon present in the resi
dential wells, and the the amount of
TCA found ranged from .09 to 3.6
ppb.
Traces of chloroform,
tetrachloroethylene, tetrac
horoethane, dichloropropene and
dibromochloromethane were also
found in the water samples.
Of the toxics found in the Barron
Park wells, the TCE level was nearest
to the upper limit set by the Califor
nia Department of Health Services.
Although the University has of
fered to re-test the three TCE
contaminated wells at the
homeowners' request, further testing
"is not required," according to Jen
nifer Gates, a University environmen
tal specialist.
The contamination "is not an ob
vious hazard," she added.
The DOHS "has not pinpointed"
the exact source of contamination at
the Watkins-Johnson site, Burnett
said, adding that "we hope (DOHS
officials) will upgrade the testing" on
the Stanford Research Park contami
nation in the near future, Burnett
said.
The report has been sent to the
DOHS in Berkeley, which will be re
sponsible for determining whether
any health hazard exists, Burnett
said.
A letter containing the results of
the tests was hand-delivered yester
day to Barron Park residents. Burnett
said.
