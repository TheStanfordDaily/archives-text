Despite efforts by the Pretoria government to
control the growth and influence of black labor un
ions, the recently consolidated black labor move
ment in South Africa will continue to be an increas
ingly important element in the anti-apartheid
movement, a Stanford professor said yesterday.
Law Prof. William Gould, who was denied a visa
by the South African government in his last at
tempt to visit the country, stated that the black
trade union movement "will be an important part,
if not the dominant part, of the black political op
position, which cannot be eliminated as much as
the South African government would will it."
Speaking before an audience of 25 at the Bechtel
International Center, Gould said the recent forma
tion of the Congress of South African Trade Uni
ons (COSATU) is indicative of the increasing anti
government political involvement of black unions.
Gould emphasized that as the first national fed
eration of black trade unions, COSATU, which
represents 500,000 of the 600,000 black workers in
union* called for divestment of foreign com

panies in South Africa.
In violation of South African law, "The leader
ship of COSATU called for divestment publicly . . .
and advocated direct political involvement . . .
when the organization was formed," Gould noted.
Providing a brief history of the black labor move
ment, Gould said the South African government
has had a "double-barreled" response to black un
ions. While the South African government has
facilitated black trade union growth through labor
law reform, granting black workers the right to or
ganize and join unions, a "vast arsenal" of other
laws has been used to limit the power and scope of
black unions, Gould said.
Gould specifically cited influx control laws,
which allow the government to fire and deport
striking workers to the so-called tribal homelands,
or Bantustans. Referring to Bishop Desmond
Tutu's Jan. 21 speech at Stanford, Gould said strik
ing black workers have been "dumped into the
homelands," imprisoned and tortured.
Gould maintained that despite government at
tempts to control the black labor movement, black

unions continue to increase in size and power. Ac
cording to Gould, membership in black unions has
increased from 50,000 in 1977 to 600,000 today,
while work stoppages due to strikes have increased
four times during the same period.
"Clearly, the black trade union movement, in
spite of the law .. . and the intentions of the gov
ernment ... is not weak," Gould said.
Gould said the U.S. labor movement has shown
little support for the black trade union movement
in South Africa. He asserted that the AFL-CIO has
a foreign policy orientation that largely ignores the
black labor movement in South Africa.
"The AFL-CIO, which would be the natural
basis for coordination between the American labor
movement and the South African trade union
movement .. . has had a foreign policy which eu
phemistically is quite conservative and right-wing
and which today is in line with much of the foreign
policy of the Reagan Administration," he said.
"The labor movement within South Africa
deserves attention; it will, hopefully, receive in
creasing attention as time goes on," he added.
