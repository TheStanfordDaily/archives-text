A guest of a Columbae House resident collapsed Wednesday night
after an apparent drug overdose, according to Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington.
David Tom, a resident of the East Bay, was taken to the emergency
room of Stanford Hospital after paramedics found him unconscious at
Columbae. He is now in the psychiatric ward of the hospital, according
to Carol Paine, the head nurse of the unit.
Both the hospital and his physician yesterday refused to comment on
his condition.
Herrington said that before Tom collapsed, he was seen at Tresidder
Union "acting strangely" and "didn't know what he was talking about."
