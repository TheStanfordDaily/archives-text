# University solves budget
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
Stanford has successfully balanced its $270.2 million
operating budget for the ninth consecutive fiscal year, ac
cording to the University's annual financial report.
The streak is expected to end next year, however, as
Provost James Rosse announced earlier this month that
the latest long-range financial forecast indicates substan
tial budget cuts will be needed to help close multi-million
dollar deficits in the next two fiscal years.
Although the operating budget represents only about
38 percent of the University's $705 million consolidated
budget, it is important because of the concentration of
overhead services it contains, Rosse said.
The operating budget includes almost all University
operations, maintenance and administrative costs, as well
as 44 percent of total instructional expenditures. ,
In addition to achieving a balanced operating budget,
the annual financial report shows the market value of the
University endowment also topped the $1.2 billion mark.
To insure that endowment returns continue to provide 12
to 13 percent of the operating budget, the University
limits current payout of endowment returns to the opera
ting budget to 4.75 percent of the market value of the en
dowment principle.
The 4.75 percent payout is a "trade-off' between
venHv marker performance and cost increases in the Uni-

versity budget, according to Harry Turner, University as
sociate treasurer.
The University also reinvested $99.4 million in realized
capital gains and $6.1 million of investment income back
into the endowment during the past year. This reinvest
ment is necessary to maintain the purchasing power of the
remaining endowment, Turner said.
The University investment strategy also reflects a need
to "hedge" against the decreasing rate of U.S. inflation,
Turner said.
According to Turner, investment in domestic and gov
ernment securities such as U.S. Treasury bonds will pro
vide a fixed yield as well as a source of capital gains in a
market of declining interest rates.
The Board of Trustees has also approved plans to diver
sify endowment investments, increasing overall portfolio
returns with only a small corresponding increase in risk.
According to William Massy, University vice president
for business and finance, this strategy has increased the
probability of superior returns, compared to a typical
portfolio of large capitalization stocks, bonds and cash.
"This is the result of including in the portfolio invest
ments that do not perform in lockstep with the more con
ventional stock and bond markets," Massy told the Uni
versity News Service. Long-term portfolio targets include
increased investments in assets such as venture capital and
real estate equity.
