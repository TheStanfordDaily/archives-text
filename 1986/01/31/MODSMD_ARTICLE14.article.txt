# Defense takes resources
## Physician says arms race endangers global health 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
Because the world is diverting re
sources away from health services
in order to fuel the arms race, "we
are in the midst of a modern
plague," Dr. Victor Sidel said in a
speech last night.
There are severe health conse
quences merely from the prepara
tion for a nuclear conflict, Sidel said
at a presentation sponsored by the
Stanford, Mid-Peninsula and South
Bay chapter of Physicians for Social
Responsibility (PSR).
As a result of U.S.-Soviet arms
build-up, money, along with scien
tific, engineering and technical re
sources, is being diverted from
health services and efforts to im
prove the quality of life, Sidel told
about 60 people at Campbell Reci
tal Hall.
Sidel, a professor at the Mon
tefiore Medical Center in New
York, is president-elect for the na
tional organization of PSR. His
term begins next year.
"PSR is in no way against secur
ity for the nation," he said. PSR's
goal is to obtain that security in a
manner that will not aggravate
existing social and economic prob
lems, Sidel added.
This country's commitment to
improving health and living condi
tions for the poor has been
diminished, Sidel said, pointing to
the budget cuts affecting health ser
vice programs throughout the na
tion.
The problem is not restricted to
this country, however. It affects de

veloping nations along with the rest
of the world, he said.
Sidel said it is hard to conceive of
the enormity of the arms race's ef
fect on the world. "Statistics are
difficult to relate to people," he
said.
To illustrate his point, Sidel
brought out a metronome set at one
beat per second. "With each click a
child either dies or is permanently
maimed by a disease that could
have been prevented by immuniza
tion or improved living conditions,"
he said as the metronome began
beating.

Sidel left the machine running
throughout the rest of the presenta
tion.
He also attempted to show what
could be accomplished with money
currently being spent on defense
throughout the world.
For the same amount of money
spent each hour on defense, health
officials were able to wipe out
smallpox, he said.
The cost of a new 81-B bomber
is twice the amount of money that
has been spent on measles immuni
zation over the last 17 years, he
said.
