## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Refugees need sanctuary 
### 
Americans love to hear about communist defectors.
When Soviet, Chinese or East European refugees flee
to the United States seeking asylum, America rolls out
the red carpet. Press conferences, receptions and a
warm welcome into the American fold often greet
these fugitives from the East.
Sadly, the United States' treatment of the growing
tide of refugees from oppression in its own hemisphere
has been quite different. For the most part, political
fugitives from such "friendly" nations as Guatemala
and El Salvador face not press conferences, but
deportation.
A growing number of U.S. religious groups, cities
and student organizations have declared themselves
"sanctuaries" for homeless Central American
refugees. Such sanctuaries offer financial assistance
and, in some cases, "safe" housing for refugees.
Last week, here at Stanford, a small group of stu
dents announced plans to begin a campaign to have
Stanford officially designated a sanctuary zone. The
group plans to organize a petition drive to have a sanc
tuary referendum placed on the ASSU general election
ballot this spring. In consideration of the grossly unjust
and inhumane immigration policies of our government,
we support this effort.
According to figures from the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS), the United States ad
mitted 33 percent of the Polish applicants for asylum
during fiscal 1984, 41 percent of the Afghan appli
cants. Over 60 percent of Iranian refugees were of
fered asylum. During the same period, less than 3 per
cent of Salvadorans who applied for asylum were ap
proved. Among Guatemalan applicants, less than 1
percent were granted asylum. The rest were turned
away.
These figures clearly show that our government is
playing politics with human misery. Each year the
federal government arrests and deports hundreds of
Central American refugees who have fled to this
country seeking asylum. For many of these refugees,
return to their homeland means persecution, torture
and even death. Citing serious concern for the fate of
Salvadoran refugees returned against their will to El

Salvador, Amnesty International has come out in
strong opposition to such deportations.
The Reagan Administration has chosen a politically
convenient, but morally deplorable course of action.
Having pledged support to repressive authoritarian
regimes such as those in El Salvador or Guatemala, our
government simply ignores the fact that serious repres
sion exists in those nations. The Administration has
turned a blind eye to the likely persecution suffered by
many of those refugees it regularly returns to Central
America.
We feel that such a policy insults the very ideals of
individual rights upon which our nation was founded.
Refugees, regardless of their political orientation or
country of origin, are human beings. To deport them to
possible torture or death violates the most basic stand
ards of human compassion.
Begun in 1982, the sanctuary movement now claims
close to 300 organizations nationwide. In 1984, the
graduate student union at UC-Riverside became the
first student organization to declare a sanctuary. Since
then, sanctuaries have been declared by student groups
at several U.S. colleges and universities, among them
UC-Berkeley, UC-Fresno, UC-San Diego and the
University of Colorado-Boulder.
Unfortunately, in material terms, the effectiveness
of a sanctuary at Stanford is likely to be very limited.
Given the already cramped student housing conditions
here, sheltering refugees on campus will prove to be, at
best, very difficult. Although the Stanford sanctuary
may indeed be able to assist in fundraising for larger
sanctuary projects, its contribution will undoubtedly be
small
However, the real value of a Stanford sanctuary is
not material. Rather, it is symbolic. By joining the
growing number of sanctuary organizations, Stanford
will be making an active statement condemning our
government's intolerably unjust treatment of Centra!
American refugees.
And condemn it we must. Sadly, we as a nation are
responsible for much of the misery and repression
which has driven these refugees from their homes. We
cannot, in good conscience, ignore their plight.
