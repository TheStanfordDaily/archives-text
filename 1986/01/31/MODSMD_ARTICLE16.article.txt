Zapata artwork is
well worth a look
Casa Zapata is my home, and the
home of 90 other undergraduates, of
whom 40 percent are "Hispanic".
Contrary to popular myths of
"reverse racism" and "animositic
segregation," Zapatistas (as the resi
dents call themselves) compose a
family.
Like many other homes, our walls
are graced with artwork, primarily
murals. Murals are a form of artistic
expression, indigenous to Chicanos
and Chicano culture. They are an
outward manifestation of the artist's
perception of the Chicano experi
ence, in terms of local, national and
global issues. Murals stand for a
dream of fundamental transforma
tion, not mere cosmetic reform.
A mural is bright, bold and graphic.
Its powerful imagery is designed to
cause viewers to catch their breath,
forcing them to question and ponder
the messsage therein. It is for this rea
son that most murals are untitled.
This is not to say, however, that the
artist never has a central message in
mind. Case in point, the large murals
in the dining hall, which Tom De Paul
referred to in his Viewpoint (Daily,
Jan. 27). The artist's name is Zarco

Guerrero, a muralist from Mexico,
whose purpose was to indict advertis
ing in Mexico. The red paint dripping
from the border symbolizes blood
and indicates that the three images
are of one woman at various stages of
her life. The first figure is a Mexican
woman, in the flower of her youth.
She is, however, bombarded by the
description of beauty as the fair
blonde Spanish woman, promulgated
in Mexican advertising. This false
image causes the woman to lose pride
in her Mexican/Indian ancestry; thus,
she is faceless. Too late, she returns
to her former self, haggard and old.
Murals are supposed to foment dis
cussion and are open to many inter
pretations. Murals are thought
provoking artwork, and isn't that one
of the purposes of a liberal educa
tion? Let your thoughts be further
provoked, come to Casa Zapata and
see all the murals yourself.

Cat painting was
thoughtless, wrong
We would like to extend a state
ment regarding the incident of animal
abuse that took place at a Stanford

design loft paint room Oct. 31, 1985.
There have been many people both
inside and outside the loft community
concerned by our behavior. We hope
that this statement will clarify the cir
cumstances surrounding this unfor
tunate incident.
We were in the paint room and so
was Bondo, the cat. We thought at
the time, "Gee, wouldn't that cat
look good with a purple tail." The
paint was there and we thought that
Bondo would not be harmed as long
as we did not get the paint on his skin.
At no time was the cat "dipped in
paint," and only his extremities, his
tail and feet, were painted. We
watched him to make sure he was not
eating the paint off and we left him a
bowl of dog food.
We would like to sincerely
apologize to all members of the Stan
ford community. Our actions were
not consistent with our love of
animals and respect for other's prop
erty. We are both pet owners and at
no time wished to torture or cause
pain to the cat or to any humans.
With the clarity of hindsight, we now
recognize that our actions were ir
responsible, thoughtless and harmful.
We are thankful that the cat is now in
good health, although our contrition
remains genuine and heartfelt.
