## Costa Rica election a hopeful sign 
### 
During the late 1950s and early '60s, policy
makers in Washington started to pay close atten
tion to the socio-politicial conditions of the nations
of Latin America. Cuban leader Fidel Castro had
scared many observers in the United States who
feared that the revolutionary movement he headed
in Cuba would trigger leftist insurrections through
out the continent. The Kennedy Administration or
ganized the Alliance for Progress to promote eco
nomic development and democratic reforms as an
attempt to prevent another Cuban Revolution from

taking place in Latin America. Eventually, the
United States lost interest in the region as the Viet
nam War became more complex. Nevertheless,
after the Sandinistas overthrew Nicaraguan dic
tator Anastasio Somoza in 1979, the State Depart
ment once again began to worry about the prob
lems that some of its southern neighbors faced.
The victory of the Sandinista forces has trans
formed the central part of the American continent
into a vital interest zone for the United States. The
U.S. government fears that other countries in the
isthmus might soon fall under control of communist
groups. The press presently has a number of jour
nalists working in the isthmus because of the pres
ence of U.S. military forces in the area and the
large amounts of economic and military aid that the
Reagan Adminsitration provides to certain groups
in Central America. Most of the coverage that the
media puts forth deals with images and descriptions
of poverty, political turmoil, civil strife, labor un
rest. destruction and death. But not all the issues

related to Central America have such negative con
notations. Good news comes from Costa Rica, a
Central American country that on Feb. 2 will rein
vigorate its democracy when citizens go to the polls
to elect representatives at the presidential,
legislative and municipal levels.
During election time a festive atmosphere
prevails in Costa Rica. Everywhere people talk
about politics and interrelated subjects such as the
economy, national security, the lack of popular
housing and allegations of governmental corrup
tion. Throughout the territory houses display party
symbols while car owners drive around with pictur
esque flags. The electoral process certainly im
presses foreign observers who try to identify the
reasons why a tradition of democratic government
has developed solely in Costa Rica and not in the
rest of Central America.
Costa Rica's colonial experience differed from
that of its neighbors. The kingdom of Spain showed
no interest whatsoever in a small and poor colony
where conquerors could not find any gold, silver or
other valuables to take back to Europe. The tradi
tional authoritarian ideas that the Spanish brought
to the New World hardly penetrated Costa Rica's
political thinking. Once Spain granted indepen
dence in 1821, the people repeatedly attempted to
establish mechanisms that would permit a demo
cratic political system to function. Nevertheless,
they had to wait a long time until a stable
democracy emerged. By the '40s the pillars that
would support Costa Rica's current political
structure were already in place. The country just
needed the wisdom and pragmatism of Rafael A.
Calderon Guardia and Jose Figueres, two of the

most important statesmen in the history of Costa
Rica.
Calderon Guardia, head of the nation from 1940
to 1944, introduced during his tenure the social
guarantees legislation. This set of egalitarian laws
prevented the social polarization of the society and
permitted the formation of a large middle class.
Fugueres reorganized the country after he emerged
triumphant from the 1948 civil war. Following a
short transitional period, he returned the
presidency to civilian hands. But before Figueres
stepped down he had dissolved the armed forces
and had convoked the National Assembly to word
a constitution that would institute democracy as the
political system of the state. Among other things,
the constitutional letter stresses civil rights, the in
violability of private property and freedom of ex
pression though lack of prior censorship. It hails
education as free and mandatory, and universal
suffrage as a right and a civic duty.
People who believe in democracy should rejoice
at the electoral tournament that will soon take
place in Costa Rica. This small, resource-poor
country demonstrates that underdevelopment does
not preclude the establishment of democratic in
stituions. Costa Rica's political system has not only
given its citizens the highest standards of living in
Central America, but has also saved them from the
bloody-armed conflicts that are presently being in
flicted on the other nations in the isthmus. The next
Costa Rican government must have the courage to
approach complex national problems with feasible
and intelligent solutions. Otherwise, the attain
ments of the past decades could rapidly crumble.

taking place in Latin America. Eventually, the
United States lost interest in the region as the Viet
nam War became more complex. Nevertheless,
after the Sandinistas overthrew Nicaraguan dic
tator Anastasio Somoza in 1979, the State Depart
ment once again began to worry about the prob
lems that some of its southern neighbors faced.
The victory of the Sandinista forces has trans
formed the central part of the American continent
into a vital interest zone for the United States. The
U.S. government fears that other countries in the
isthmus might soon fall under control of communist
groups. The press presently has a number of jour
nalists working in the isthmus because of the pres
ence of U.S. military forces in the area and the
large amounts of economic and military aid that the
Reagan Adminsitration provides to certain groups
in Central America. Most of the coverage that the
media puts forth deals with images and descriptions
of poverty, political turmoil, civil strife, labor un
rest. destruction and death. But not all the issues

related to Central America have such negative con
notations. Good news comes from Costa Rica, a
Central American country that on Feb. 2 will rein
vigorate its democracy when citizens go to the polls
to elect representatives at the presidential,
legislative and municipal levels.
During election time a festive atmosphere
prevails in Costa Rica. Everywhere people talk
about politics and interrelated subjects such as the
economy, national security, the lack of popular
housing and allegations of governmental corrup
tion. Throughout the territory houses display party
symbols while car owners drive around with pictur
esque flags. The electoral process certainly im
presses foreign observers who try to identify the
reasons why a tradition of democratic government
has developed solely in Costa Rica and not in the
rest of Central America.
Costa Rica's colonial experience differed from
that of its neighbors. The kingdom of Spain showed
no interest whatsoever in a small and poor colony
where conquerors could not find any gold, silver or
other valuables to take back to Europe. The tradi
tional authoritarian ideas that the Spanish brought
to the New World hardly penetrated Costa Rica's
political thinking. Once Spain granted indepen
dence in 1821, the people repeatedly attempted to
establish mechanisms that would permit a demo
cratic political system to function. Nevertheless,
they had to wait a long time until a stable
democracy emerged. By the '40s the pillars that
would support Costa Rica's current political
structure were already in place. The country just
needed the wisdom and pragmatism of Rafael A.
Calderon Guardia and Jose Figueres, two of the

most important statesmen in the history of Costa
Rica.
Calderon Guardia, head of the nation from 1940
to 1944, introduced during his tenure the social
guarantees legislation. This set of egalitarian laws
prevented the social polarization of the society and
permitted the formation of a large middle class.
Fugueres reorganized the country after he emerged
triumphant from the 1948 civil war. Following a
short transitional period, he returned the
presidency to civilian hands. But before Figueres
stepped down he had dissolved the armed forces
and had convoked the National Assembly to word
a constitution that would institute democracy as the
political system of the state. Among other things,
the constitutional letter stresses civil rights, the in
violability of private property and freedom of ex
pression though lack of prior censorship. It hails
education as free and mandatory, and universal
suffrage as a right and a civic duty.
People who believe in democracy should rejoice
at the electoral tournament that will soon take
place in Costa Rica. This small, resource-poor
country demonstrates that underdevelopment does
not preclude the establishment of democratic in
stituions. Costa Rica's political system has not only
given its citizens the highest standards of living in
Central America, but has also saved them from the
bloody-armed conflicts that are presently being in
flicted on the other nations in the isthmus. The next
Costa Rican government must have the courage to
approach complex national problems with feasible
and intelligent solutions. Otherwise, the attain
ments of the past decades could rapidly crumble.
