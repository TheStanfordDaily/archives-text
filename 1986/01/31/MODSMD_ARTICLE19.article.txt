# SDI key to arms control
## 
### 
Arms control isn't a particularly inspiring subject. It's
much easier to get inflamed over world hunger and apart
heid — the consensus is fairly solid that they're bad. Even
so, because of the catastrophic potential of nuclear weap
ons, arms control ranks high among the important issues
of our time.
It is an especially pertinent issue right now because in
Washington the debate is really heating up among the
many actors who shape arms control policy. The people
who comprise the policy-making bureaucracy hold a wide

range of viewpoints, and they're all busy gearing up for,
and arguing about, the second Reagan-Gorbachev sum
mit. You have your Caspar Weinbergers and Richard
Perles who have made it implicitly (if not explicitly) clear
that they have little use for arms control. You also have
your George Shultzes and Paul Nitzes who, while
hardline, see the value in mutually limiting nuclear arsen
als. This disparate group has reached new heights in bu
reaucratic bickering, and no effective leader has yet
emerged who can take charge of the decision-making
process.
The discord in this bureaucracy is especially strong right
now because the Shultz-types see the next summit as an
opportunity to reach an agreement with the Soviets while
the Weinberger-types are running scared that an agree
ment will be reached, and are doing their best to sabotage
potentially negotiable arms proposals.
It is not too difficult to discern that the chances for the
successful conclusion of an arms control treaty are not
very great. However, there are reasons for some hope.
Because of the president's insistence on proceeding with
the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), and the Soviet's
vehemence on wanting us to give it up, SDI has become
the ultimate bargaining chip.
Any self-respecting advocate of arms control should be
drooling over Reagan's present bargaining position. Talk
about bargaining from strength — Reagan has the Soviets
making offers that come close to being amusing. The
Soviets can make radical proposals because every one of
them contains the provision that the United States must
give up SDI, a provision which virtually assures Reagan's
rejection of the offer. So even if they throw in a promise
to change over to a multi-party system, they know we will

continue to refuse.
Right now two major obstacles preclude the Adminis
tration from presenting a negotiable offer at Geneva.
They are the president's uncompromising stance on SDI,
and the fact that Reagan's truculent arms control bureau
cracy can't produce a coherent strategy.
Hopes for progress on a treaty lie in two possible moves
by Reagan: negotiating limits on SDI, and allowing one
advisor (who desires a treaty) to take control of the White
House arms control apparatus. (Reagan can't take control
himself because, to put it kindly, his intellectual grasp of
the subject is marginal at best.)
Given Reagan's personal love affair with his "peace
shield," it seems far-fetched to expect that he would make
a complete turn-around in his policy and allow limits on
SDI. However, there are precedents for this sort of con
tradictory behavior — take the metamorphosis of U.S.
policy toward South Africa. Also, Reagan still seems to be
thinking of SDI as a defense for the entire country. Per
haps if he notices that all his advisers have given up
"defending the people" for the more practical task of
defending missiles, he may begin to realize that he has not
found a way out of the "balance of terror".
Although unlikely, it is possible that one person may
yet be able to take charge of the arms control bureaucracy
— the new National Security Adviser Admiral Poindex
ter. He hasn't had a very high profile so far, but he was
only recently appointed to office and is probably getting
his bearings. Of course, it is hard to tell at the moment on
what side of the fence he will end up. There are those who
hope that he will ally himself with Schultz and Nitze, and
demonstrate an expertise that will earn him Reagan's sup
port. By gaining influence with the president, he also may
be in a position to educate him about SDI.
Gorbachev has most recently proposed that the nuclear
powers of the world disarm by the year 2000. Although
the offer was probably submitted mainly for public rela
tions purposes, that doesn't mean that the Soviets aren't
sincere in wanting a treaty. It would be to their definite
advantage to ratify one so that they could divert valuable
capital away from defense and use it to help build their
faltering economy.
It is ironic that while we have such a great opportunity
to negotiate a significant arms control agreement, we have
so little political will to back it up. But there is a spark of
hope: many people close to the President say that he's a
tough negotiator but knows when to cut a deal. And it's
very possible that Reagan wants to cap his presidency with
a treaty of real substance. (The one thing we can count on
about Reagan is his desire to make a great impression on
the public.) Most importantly, he hold the most valuable
card in the game: SDI.
