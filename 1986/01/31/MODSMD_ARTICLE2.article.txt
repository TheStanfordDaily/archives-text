# Poet Young shares his work and life

### LESLIE KAUFMAN 
Al Young, a Bay Area writer and
poet, proved to his small but
receptive audience in Toyon Hall
last night that he has, indeed, a vast
array of talents.
Young's presentation, part of the
ASSU's Speakers Bureau weekly
series on Bay Area writers, ranged
from singing songs by such 1960s
top-40 groups as the Angels and

the Shirelles, to discussing the
meaning of creation.
The 46-year-old Young also
reflected on his life by frequently
interspersing personal anecdotes
between his readings.
"I've always had the desire to use
language that is both imaginative
and communicative," Young said.
"I try to invest everything I write
with poetic spirit. It is the natural
human way of expressing ourselves.
"In this era of specialization we
tend to relegate people to fields: den
tist, lawyer, scientist — I think this is
wrong. I think we are all artists," he
added.
Young said that not only is poetry a
natural extension of humans, but that
creation is equivalent to the poetic
output of a divine being. He added
that contemporary society's "creative
outlet" is being stifled by its
"schizophrenia of the young Ameri
can nation," the threat of nuclear war

and its mental barriers due to the
stress of modern day activity.
Young said, "In Eskimo, the word
that means 'to make poetry' is the
same word that means 'to breathe.'
Creativity and life are linked."
In addition to being an an active
poet, novelist and essayist, Young is a
small-press editor and screen writer.
One of the most respected writers in
the Bay Area, he is probably best
known as the author of the screenplay
"Bustin' Loose" that starred Richard
Pryor.
Of his diverse activities, Young
said, "I could never quite make up
my mind what I wanted to do."
Young said he has been writing
since the age of five. Born and raised
in the South, he is the oldest of seven

children. Young said his writings
were greatly influenced by the oral
tradition of southern blacks and his
works are filled with slices of south
ern black dialogue.
He said that his childhood experi
ences of racism are also incorporated
in his writing.
Young has received many honors,
including the Wallace Stegner Fel
lowship, which brought him to Stan
ford to teach in 1966. He has also
taught at Berkeley.
"The purpose of the Bay Area Se
ries is to bring excellent but lesser
known artists to campus," said
Speakers Bureau Chairman Dixon
Osborn. "What we are trying to do is
make poetry more accessible to stu
dents."
