## Noodles: a ramentic longing 
### MARILYN WANN Editorial staff 
"Hi Mom looka me I'm on TV, well, almost, can you
hear me this Times Roman stuff isn't very big - wait a min
ute, let me start a real paragraph and Til tell you what I'm
doing here no kidding 'Come On Down' my announcer's
saying, and I'm running out of breath up here anyway."
It's all my mother's fault that I'm talking to you about
ramen and writing sentences that look rather like ramen
noodles here in the historic first inches of a new column.
I told my editors that I would discuss whatever aspects
of Stanford life inspire me with about 20 inches of incisive
commentary every week. Oh well. There are really no
excuses, only explanations:
You see, Mom isn't the type to send caloric care
packages; she plays bridge with a quorum of PTA alums
instead.
So of course, she goes to the Price Club. You know, the
new suburban mecca-in-a-warehouse that delivers bulk
goods on a forklift at 1968 prices.
Following this kinked progression of noodle logic to its
steamy end, I now possess a 12-pack of Maruchan Orien
tal Noodle Soup/Ramen Supreme, chicken flavor no less.
No advertising here, the Store already sells four or five
cases of the stuff a day.
That's 24 packets a case, or 120 bowlfuls to you and me
and Mike Daley who delivers Reese Finer Foods' prod
ucts to campus.
Ramen is a Chinese loanword in Japanese that
describes the "ra" variety of noodle, or "men."
I heard once that Japanese bachelors have been known
to overdose on these modern conveniences, succumbing
to a fatal form of waxy build-up. Maybe Mom's trying to
kill me.
I can just see the mini-series possibilities now:
"RAMEN — the saga of two noodle-crossed lovers, all
star cast headed by Richard Chamberlain and Julia Child.
They met over the schools of Fotomat-sushi floating in
their jacuzzi at a chic Palo Alto sushi bar and went on to
build a worldwide soybean empire, full of intrigue and
carbohydrates."
It doesn't take a Bene Gesserit to know that beginnings
are tricky times, and here I am fantasizing about pasta.

So, salutations! I'm your columnist, Marilyn Wann, and
today we'll be considering the ramen controversy: Is it
really just one long noodle scrunched up in a bag? How
long is that noodle and just where do they hide the ends?
Phil Donahue won't even tackle this touchy subject,
and here 1 am, without so much as a microphone with
which to gesticulate, much less a mixed panel of ramen ex
perts and addicts.
The ramen proliferation among students is one of the
great mysteries of our age, almost as inexplicable as the
fact that The Daily, which runs an average of 12 pages,
sponsors no less than 14 columns with their attendant
columnists.

WANNDERINGS

While it's been scientifically proven that the standard
record has 2.067 grooves, one on each side and a little
margin for error, the statistics coming out of ramen re
search these days aren't so conclusive.
Picture the wise old Tootsiepops owl sucking an endless
noodle into his primly pursed beak. Never a chewy center
to reward his efforts. Do we really want to perpetuate
such cruelty on animal test subjects?
The topic is more serious than you probably think,
though. Just imagine all those hot pots in Flo Mo, the Mr.
Coffees in Governor's Corner, espresso machines on the
Row and kitchenettes in Mirrielees, all boiling away at
this curly stuff that looks like a mix between toothpaste
and pubic hair.
1 wonder what sort of cavity creeps the Crest Kids
would have to combat if they ate ramen all the time in
Toothopolis. A new porn genre is born.
So, in lieu of champagne (The Daily is on a budget, you
know), I'll break a ceremonial package of ramen noodles
on the prow of my column, inaugurating its maiden
voyage with my dinner-in-your-dorm-room recipe:
Boil two cups of water with your choice of small heating
appliance. Following instructions on back of plastic bag,
add cancer-causing seasoning packet, neon yellow Kraft
mustard and Bob Ostrow's Monterey Jack cheese to taste.
Julia Child would wiggle a noodle at the cameraman
and say, "Now isn't that lovely?"

excuses, only explanations:
You see, Mom isn't the type to send caloric care
packages; she plays bridge with a quorum of PTA alums
instead.
So of course, she goes to the Price Club. You know, the
new suburban mecca-in-a-warehouse that delivers bulk
goods on a forklift at 1968 prices.
Following this kinked progression of noodle logic to its
steamy end, I now possess a 12-pack of Maruchan Orien
tal Noodle Soup/Ramen Supreme, chicken flavor no less.
No advertising here, the Store already sells four or five
cases of the stuff a day.
That's 24 packets a case, or 120 bowlfuls to you and me
and Mike Daley who delivers Reese Finer Foods' prod
ucts to campus.
Ramen is a Chinese loanword in Japanese that
describes the "ra" variety of noodle, or "men."
I heard once that Japanese bachelors have been known
to overdose on these modern conveniences, succumbing
to a fatal form of waxy build-up. Maybe Mom's trying to
kill me.
I can just see the mini-series possibilities now:
"RAMEN — the saga of two noodle-crossed lovers, all
star cast headed by Richard Chamberlain and Julia Child.
They met over the schools of Fotomat-sushi floating in
their jacuzzi at a chic Palo Alto sushi bar and went on to
build a worldwide soybean empire, full of intrigue and
carbohydrates."
It doesn't take a Bene Gesserit to know that beginnings
are tricky times, and here I am fantasizing about pasta.

So, salutations! I'm your columnist, Marilyn Wann, and
today we'll be considering the ramen controversy: Is it
really just one long noodle scrunched up in a bag? How
long is that noodle and just where do they hide the ends?
Phil Donahue won't even tackle this touchy subject,
and here 1 am, without so much as a microphone with
which to gesticulate, much less a mixed panel of ramen ex
perts and addicts.
The ramen proliferation among students is one of the
great mysteries of our age, almost as inexplicable as the
fact that The Daily, which runs an average of 12 pages,
sponsors no less than 14 columns with their attendant
columnists.

While it's been scientifically proven that the standard
record has 2.067 grooves, one on each side and a little
margin for error, the statistics coming out of ramen re
search these days aren't so conclusive.
Picture the wise old Tootsiepops owl sucking an endless
noodle into his primly pursed beak. Never a chewy center
to reward his efforts. Do we really want to perpetuate
such cruelty on animal test subjects?
The topic is more serious than you probably think,
though. Just imagine all those hot pots in Flo Mo, the Mr.
Coffees in Governor's Corner, espresso machines on the
Row and kitchenettes in Mirrielees, all boiling away at
this curly stuff that looks like a mix between toothpaste
and pubic hair.
1 wonder what sort of cavity creeps the Crest Kids
would have to combat if they ate ramen all the time in
Toothopolis. A new porn genre is born.
So, in lieu of champagne (The Daily is on a budget, you
know), I'll break a ceremonial package of ramen noodles
on the prow of my column, inaugurating its maiden
voyage with my dinner-in-your-dorm-room recipe:
Boil two cups of water with your choice of small heating
appliance. Following instructions on back of plastic bag,
add cancer-causing seasoning packet, neon yellow Kraft
mustard and Bob Ostrow's Monterey Jack cheese to taste.
Julia Child would wiggle a noodle at the cameraman
and say, "Now isn't that lovely?"
