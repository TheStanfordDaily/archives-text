# Chronicle columnist Herb Caen converses candidly
## 
### KRISTEN BROWN 
When San Francisco Chronicle col
umnist Herb Caen took to the
podium last night in Branner lounge,
he told the capacity crowd that he was
unprepared, as usual.
"I don't do much speaking. I don't
like to speak," he said.
Actually, Caen seemed to be en
joying himself immensely. For almost
an hour, he took cracks at everyone
and everything that came to mind, in
cluding his very own, The Chronicle.
In an attempt to explain the news
paper, Caen said that it is an "unusual
paper. Very successful. It mirrors the
city, a strange city with no particular
focus."
"There was a period when The
Chronicle was a normal newspaper,
and it almost went out of business,"
he said.
While Caen might enjoy entertain
ing, as he did last night, he is far from
the image of the confident, crowd
pleasing politician.
He stands about 5-foot-11 and is
distinguishable by two definite
patches of silver wiry hair that frame
his head, leaving a vacant strip of skin
at the center.
"I don't look too bad, do I?" he
asked the crowd at Branner. A virtual
old-timer at The Chronicle, Caen has
has been writing his column for 47
years.
He proceeded to talk about his
start in journalism.
Caen grew up in Sacramento,
which he described as a place that
"makes you want to get the hell out."
His first experience with the newspa

per business came at age 16, when he
worked for a local Sacramento news
paper.
How did he get the job?
"Pure luck," he said, joking that
luck is the only thing that has guided
him through life.
"I was on the police beat. At 18 I
covered hangings, and I have been
anti-capital punishment ever since."
In 1936 he went to San Francisco
to write a radio column for The
Chronicle. A couple of years later, he
asked if he could write a daily column
about the city. His superior wondered
if he would find enough things to
write on.
At Branner last night, Caen fielded
questions from the enthusiastic audi
ence, and he often interrupted his
answers with colorful anecdotes.
Caen said that people often ask
him, "After you write your column,
what do you do the rest of the day?"
He said he on a typical day he
arrives at work at 9 a.m., reads his
mail and surveys his desk debris.
Then 11 a.m. rolls around, and he
thinks, "tommorrow's story hasn't
been written yet." Panic sets in.
"Being insecure, I get this feeling
that I'm not going to make it, that I
won't think of anything. Then I write
the column."
He added, "The real work begins. I
go to lunch. About 5:30,1 split. I start
running around town. That's my life.
I love it."
Caen's talk in Branner was often as
sporadic and rambling as his columns.
He defended himself against those
who think his columns are too short
to matter.

"I like short items myself. I have a
short attention span," he said. "I'm
only proud of myself when 1 take a
story that somone might write three
paragraphs on and condense it to
three sentences."
How long does it take him to put
together one of his daily columns?
"Well," he said, "it usually takes
an hour-and-a-half; if it's thoughtful,
an hour and 75 minutes. The Sunday

column is a real dog because I have to
write it on Tuesday."
That's why he calls it his "deep
thinking" column, because he finds it
difficult to write Sunday's news on a
Tuesday.
Asked to describe "Lady DiFi"
(his nickname for San Francisco's
mayor), he said that "she pretends to
be anti-high-rise but she isn't; her
husband's tall. He likes to climb Mt.

Everest — I guess it's warmer up
there
Caen also mentioned that his
column often incites piles of mail.
One reader wrote him that the only
reason he has a column is because
Macy's cannot afford a full-page ad.
Caen noted that he's been sued
many times for invasion of privacy,
and once for libel, "and I've lost them
all."

Caen also discussed his family.
Even though his son is a student at
Stanford, Caen claimed that his
"heart is in Berkeley."
"He (Caen's son) disappeared into
KA's. I haven't seen him since. Now
he's on sabbatical in San Francisco.
He sleeps until noon, then he gets up
and reads The San Francisco
Chronicle for an hour. I couldn't do
that if 1 tried."

covered hangings, and I have been
anti-capital punishment ever since."
In 1936 he went to San Francisco
to write a radio column for The
Chronicle. A couple of years later, he
asked if he could write a daily column
about the city. His superior wondered
if he would find enough things to
write on.
At Branner last night, Caen fielded
questions from the enthusiastic audi
ence, and he often interrupted his
answers with colorful anecdotes.
Caen said that people often ask
him, "After you write your column,
what do you do the rest of the day?"
He said he on a typical day he
arrives at work at 9 a.m., reads his
mail and surveys his desk debris.
Then 11 a.m. rolls around, and he
thinks, "tommorrow's story hasn't
been written yet." Panic sets in.
"Being insecure, I get this feeling
that I'm not going to make it, that I
won't think of anything. Then I write
the column."
He added, "The real work begins. I
go to lunch. About 5:30,1 split. I start
running around town. That's my life.
I love it."
Caen's talk in Branner was often as
sporadic and rambling as his columns.
He defended himself against those
who think his columns are too short
to matter.

"I like short items myself. I have a
short attention span," he said. "I'm
only proud of myself when 1 take a
story that somone might write three
paragraphs on and condense it to
three sentences."
How long does it take him to put
together one of his daily columns?
"Well," he said, "it usually takes
an hour-and-a-half; if it's thoughtful,
an hour and 75 minutes. The Sunday

column is a real dog because I have to
write it on Tuesday."
That's why he calls it his "deep
thinking" column, because he finds it
difficult to write Sunday's news on a
Tuesday.
Asked to describe "Lady DiFi"
(his nickname for San Francisco's
mayor), he said that "she pretends to
be anti-high-rise but she isn't; her
husband's tall. He likes to climb Mt.

Everest — I guess it's warmer up
there
Caen also mentioned that his
column often incites piles of mail.
One reader wrote him that the only
reason he has a column is because
Macy's cannot afford a full-page ad.
Caen noted that he's been sued
many times for invasion of privacy,
and once for libel, "and I've lost them
all."

Caen also discussed his family.
Even though his son is a student at
Stanford, Caen claimed that his
"heart is in Berkeley."
"He (Caen's son) disappeared into
KA's. I haven't seen him since. Now
he's on sabbatical in San Francisco.
He sleeps until noon, then he gets up
and reads The San Francisco
Chronicle for an hour. I couldn't do
that if 1 tried."

San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen's humor delighted a capacity crowd in Branner Lounge last night.
When San Francisco Chronicle col
umnist Herb Caen took to the
podium last night in Branner lounge,
he told the capacity crowd that he was
unprepared, as usual.
"I don't do much speaking. I don't
like to speak," he said.
Actually, Caen seemed to be en
joying himself immensely. For almost
an hour, he took cracks at everyone
and everything that came to mind, in
cluding his very own, The Chronicle.
In an attempt to explain the news
paper, Caen said that it is an "unusual
paper. Very successful. It mirrors the
city, a strange city with no particular
focus."
"There was a period when The
Chronicle was a normal newspaper,
and it almost went out of business,"
he said.
While Caen might enjoy entertain
ing, as he did last night, he is far from
the image of the confident, crowd
pleasing politician.
He stands about 5-foot-11 and is
distinguishable by two definite
patches of silver wiry hair that frame
his head, leaving a vacant strip of skin
at the center.
"I don't look too bad, do I?" he
asked the crowd at Branner. A virtual
old-timer at The Chronicle, Caen has
has been writing his column for 47
years.
He proceeded to talk about his
start in journalism.
Caen grew up in Sacramento,
which he described as a place that
"makes you want to get the hell out."
His first experience with the newspa

per business came at age 16, when he
worked for a local Sacramento news
paper.
How did he get the job?
"Pure luck," he said, joking that
luck is the only thing that has guided
him through life.
"I was on the police beat. At 18 I
covered hangings, and I have been
anti-capital punishment ever since."
