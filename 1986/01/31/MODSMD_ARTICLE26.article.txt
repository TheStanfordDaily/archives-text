Dreamchild (1985)
Stanford Theater, Palo Alto
Gavin Millar directed and Dennis
("Pennies from Heaven") Potter
wrote this fairy tale with an adult
sensibility. Alice Hargreaves (Coral
Browne) arrives in New York in
1932 to celebrate the centenary of
the birth of the Rev. Charles
Dodgson (lan Holm, in flashbacks),
a.k.a. Lewis Carroll. She was the
real-life Alice of Carroll's "Alice in
Wonderland" books, and her arrival
in the New World triggers her ambi
valent recollections of her relation
ship with Dodgson. The movie puts
us inside the old Alice's thought
processes, as she imagines herself as
a child with Dodgson and, in the
movie's most inspired moments,
with his Wonderland creatures.
Through her filtered visions of her
past, we see Dodgson's tremendous
love for her as a child, and his ter
ribly apprehensive genius and wit.
The movie is beautifully crafted,
subtle and intelligent; Millar is most
assured with the transitions from
fantasy to reality to imagined
reality. The filmmakers stumble a
bit with a 1932 romance subplot.
Coral Browne and lan Holm have
never been better, and Amelia
Shankley is enchanting as the preco
cious young Alice; the creatures are
from Jim Henson's muppet shop.

Miracle in Milan (1951)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The director, Vittorio De Sica,
and the screenwriter, Cesare Zavat
tini, were famous for shattering neo
realist pictures like "Shoeshine" and
"The Bicycle Thief' when they took
a holiday with this enchanting fan
tasy, based on Zavattini's novel
"Toto the Good." De Sica's
humanism and his keen eye for so
cial injustice are still in evidence,
but the style is a wild blend of
slapstick magic and social satire: fur
collared rich men bicker over land
like bulldogs growling and yapping
at each other, lovers swing from
poles and turn somersaults, a bal
loon seller in danger of floating
away with his wares is fed bread by
his neighbors to weigh him down.
This movie achieves what Jean
Giraudoux attempted in "The Mad
Woman of Chaillot." Francesco
Golissano plays Toto, the saintly
idiot who saves his community,
Brunella Bovo plays the girl he loves
and Emma Grammatica gives a
joyous performance as the merry,
magical old woman who raises Toto.
Plays Thursday with "La Dolce
Vita."

The Color Purple (1985)
Century 10, Mountain View
Steven Spielberg directed this
candy-coated adaptation of Alice
Walker's Pulitzer Prize winning
novel, and he transmutes both
Walker's powerful emotional force
and her blatant female chauvinism.
In the book, set among black
sharecroppers in Georgia in 1909,
all of the men are either op
pressively loutish or properly
cowed, and all of the women are
loving, sisterly and long-suffering.
Speilberg doesn't change this basic
dialectic, but he does turn the men
into ineffectual, occasionally comi
cal buffoons and he gives the ma
terial a "Song of the South" patina.
This is a movie-movie black South,
where even the cornstalks seem
primed for the camera. Walker's
original characters were little more
than one-dimensional, but what
Spielberg does with them here is still
slightly insulting; he has them falling
through roofs and blowing apart
stoves and the net result is we care
about them as we might care about
Disney's animated critters. The
mostly faithful screenplay is by
Menno Meyjes, and Whoopi
Goldberg as Celie does as well as
possible under Spielberg's direction.
With Margret Avery, Danny
Glover, Willard Pugh and Oprah
Winfrey, whose heroically powerful
Sophia is the best thing about the
movie.

King of Hearts (1967)
Cubberley Auditorium
Many people have an inexplicable
fondness for this benign satirical
comedy about a French town taken
over by the insane. (In the early
'70s, one revival house in
Cambridge, Mass. ran it for two
years, and you could never get in on
a weekend without standing in line
for an hour.) The director, Philippe
De Broca, has made much better
movies; in this one, he takes
delicacy to a fault. With Alan Bates,
Pierre Brasseur, Jean-Claude
Braily, Genevieve Bujold, Francois
Christophe and Adolfo Celi (a
classy cast).
Plays tonight.

Twice in a Lifetime (1985)
Old Mill Six, Mountain View
This family drama about adultery
and divorce uses '70s self-analysis
pedantry to justify '50s (and '80s)
small town family and community
cliches, making it a truly intolerable
hybrid. Gene Hackman is Harry, a
Seattle steelworker who abandons
his family for a barmaid (Ann-
Margret), and the movie presents
his bailing out as the best solution
for everybody. Colin Welland's
script also puts this family's ag
gressively middle-class values on a
pedestal, so both Harry and we
aren't meant to question them,
we're meant to admire them. The
movie avoids all ugly emotions by
cutting away from the key con
frontational scenes, because other
wise we might not buy its pop
psycho-platitudes about life, love
and fulfillment. For a great movie
on the same theme, see "Shoot the
Moon." Directed by Bud Yorkin,
with Ellen Burstyn as the drippy
devoted wife, Amy Madigan as the
upset daughter, Ally Sheedy and
Brian Dennehy.
Plays this week.
El Norte (1984)
Cubberley Auditorium
Two young Guatemalans, brother
and sister, whose village has been
wiped out by the army, use their
godmother's pitiful savings to travel
into Mexico and — illegally — into
California, the land of promise the
Guatemalans call "el norte" (the
north). The story is an authentic
tragedy, and one admires Gregory
Nava, the director, and his wife,
Anna Thomas, the screenwriter
(they co-produced the picture), for
their persistence in working on a
project of such questionable com
mercial potential. But devotion and
integrity and right-mindedness don't
necessarily produce good movies,
and "El Norte" is an enervating
one, featuring those noble peasant
icons who have been with us since
the intellectuals of the left invented
them in the 19305. Zaide Silvia
Guitierrez and David Vallalpando
play the immigrants.
Plays this Tuesday.

The Rules of the Game (1939)
French House
"One starts with the environment
to arrive at the self," wrote Jean
Renoir. "I remain a man of the
nineteenth century, and I need ob
servation as a point of departure."
Having chronicled the death throes
of the European aristocracy in
"Grand Illusion," Renoir set this
film, made two years later, among
the new aristocracy in France: the
nouveaux riches, for whom love is
game with a fixed set of rules, and to
break them — as the anachronistic,
romantic aviator Jurieu (Roland
Toutain) does — is in bad taste and
therefore not to be tolerated.
Renoir's strategy for approaching
his subject triumphs; "Rules of the
Game" is both a social and a psy
chological drama, and one of the
three or four greatest movies ever
made. And it's one that was almost
lost to us forever — the original
negative was destroyed by the Nazis
and the film was reassembled from
bits and pieces in the fifties. Renoir
worked with Carl Koch on the
screenplay (based loosely on Alfred
de Musset's "Les Caprices de
Mariannes"); Claude Renoir shot it;
Coco Chanel designed the costumes.
The superlative cast includes Marcel
Dalio (he played the Jew, Rosen
thal, in "Grand Illusion"), Nora
Gregor, Mila Parely, Odette
Talazac, Julien Carette, Paulette
Dubost and Renoir himself.
Plays this Wednesday.
The Seven Samurai (1954)
New Varsity
Akira Kurosawa's lusty, spectacu
lar adventure, set amid the civil wars
in sixteenth-century Japan. A com
munity of farmers, slowly starving
under the double burden of land
taxes and the raids of brigands, hires
samurai to protect them, and swords
really start to fly. The characters
have a funny, foolish braggadocio,
and the actors (Toshiro Mifune,
Takashi Shimura, Yoshio Inaba,
etc.) give stylized performances
reminiscent of the silent comedies
(though they have their origin in
Kabuki theatre). The real star, of
course, is Kurosawa, who displays
the kind of witty mastery of film
technique that makes audiences
grin.
Plays this Wednesday.

Jagged Edge(l9Bs)
Memorial Auditorium
If you already know the plot of
this suspense thriller/courtroom
drama, then there's little reason to
see the movie; plot is all there is to
it. Richard ("Return of the Jedi")
Marquand directs as if he were
punching a time clock — style and
invention are not in his contract —
but he does achieve a certain
streamlined, brutal effectiveness; he
knows how to make you jump. Jeff
Bridges (as a newspaper manager
accused of murdering his wife) and
Peter Coyote (as the slimy D.A.)
give very competent performances,
but their characters function strictly
within the context of the film;
they're engineered to keep the story
moving. Everything is limited in this
way, so the shocks don't stay with
you the way they do with the best of
Hitchcock or De Palma. Glen Close
gives a mannered, uninspired per
formance as the defending attorney,
and Robert Loggia does exactly the
opposite as her private eye assistant.
Plays this Sunday.
Stop Making Sense (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jonathon Demme's film of the
Talking Heads' appearance at the
Pantages Theatre in Hollywood in
December '83, with a brilliant vir
tuoso performance by the lead
vocalist/songwriter David Byrne. No
rock performer since the young
Mick Jagger can have demonstrated
such an overwhelming combination
of precisely directed energy, razor
wit and versatility. With his mon
goose neck and scarecrow body, his
hair slicked back except for a furtive
patch that explodes over one eye, he
looks like a demented Walker Evans
figure, but everything he does is
funny. He never stops mocking him
self; he can be science-fiction hero
and villian, mutant, devil and evan
gelist, nerd and obsessive, and yet
remain the crown prince of non
sense, a New Wave Edward Lear.
Demme's direction of the film is not
merely a matter of taste and tact; he
constructs the movie the way Byrne
constructed the concert, on a
theatrical/cinematic metaphor that
peaks in the "Stop Making Sense"
number, "Girlfriend is Better,"
when Byrne thrusts his mike in front
of a techie creeping around on
stage with a lighting instrument and
then points the mike at the camera
— at us. The other members of the
band — Jerry Harrison, Chris
Frantz, Tina Weymouth, Bernie
Worrell, Alex Weir, Steve Scales,
Ednah Holt and Lynn Mabry —
each demonstrate a distinctive per
sonality. Byrne wrote most of the
songs, which have dry, sneaky word
game lyrics that bounce off each
other like billiard balls and veer into
unanticipated directions. An ecstatic
film.
Plays tonight and tomorrow with
the 19th Internatioal Tournee of
Animation.

Prizzi's Honor (1985)
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
This John Huston black comedy
aims to be a darkly funny parody of
the "Godfather" movies, with the
family squabbles, double crosses
and triple crosses twisted into lyrical
comic finagling. The screenplay, by
Janet Roach and Richard Condon
(from his book), never quite fulfills
the promise of this conception; the
movie seems over-plotted, and the
best ideas are underdeveloped. This
isn't really the fault of Huston, who
at 75 displays more energetic skill
than most directors half his age, but
the tone grows wobbly toward the
end, primarily because the
filmmakers don't give their two
main characters — hitpeople Char
ley Partanna (Jack Nicholson) and
Irene Walker (Kathleen Turner) —
enough comic personality to grab us.
Their relationship isn't very well
developed and doesn't make a lot of
sense; it's a real distraction from the
marvelous dirty doings of the sup
porting cast, which are clearly closer
to Huston's heart. William Hickey
as Don Corrado Prizzi, the wizened
and cackling godfather of the Prizzi
mob, is a joy, and Anjelica Huston
(John Huston's daughter) is the
delightfully wicked little hellcat,
Maerose (she's Charley's former
wife, and she's out to get him). With
Robert Loggia and John Randolph.

Sweet Dreams (1985)
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
The life of country western singer
Patsy Cline is simply and straight
forwardly told in this movie biog
raphy, which spans her life from
1956 to 1963. The complexity and
drama come from our caring about
Patsy and her husband Charlie, and
credit for this is due to two mar
velous performances from Jessica
Lange and Ed Harris. These two ac
tors have volatile energies that
match, and they imbue their charac
ters with a wholehearted openness
and simplicity; these two don't need
dramatic artifice to carry us along.
Lange brings such conviction to
Patsy's homespun sentiments about
wanting a house, a good husband
and a family, that when we hear the
real Patsy Cline actually singing
about these values, the conviction
we hear in her voice seems to grow
naturally out of Lange's character
(though the songs, which Lange lip
syncs, have been Dolbyized to in
human perfection). Ed Harris turns
in another wonderful performance,
poosibly his best; this actor has been
so good in recent movies, he's like
an American lan Holm. He balances
Charlie's unpredictable, violent
temper with an unexpected tender
ness and warmth. Directed by Karel
Reitze, and written by Robert
Getchell. With Ann Wedgeworth as
Patsy's mother.
Plays this week with "Prizzi's
Honor."
