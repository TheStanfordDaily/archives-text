## Applewood transcends the traditional pizza 
### LIZ EGAN TIM HARTMAN 
Applewood Inn
1001 El Camino Real
How about a Polish pizza for a
change — garnished with sauerkraut,
Polish sausage, red onion and garlic?
Or, for those of you who prefer
something more domestic, the Alas
kan pizza is flavored with smoked sal
mon, red onion, parsley and egg.
If you are celebrating a special oc
casion, why not sip champagne while
dining on a caviar pizza?
Whatever your pizza desires may
be, chances are that hosts Bela and
Inge Kardos at the Applewood Inn
can accommodate your particular
tastes. If pizza is not your favorite,
they offer a variety of pastas, soups,
salads, crepes, sandwiches and veal
dishes, all at a reasonable price.
Located at 1001 El Camino Real in
Menlo Park, the hustle and bustle of
the "El" is forgotten as soon as one
enters this European-style restaurant.
Hanging plants and ivy adorn the
wood-paneled walls, which are
generously plastered with German

signs advertising the array of im
ported beers served at the Ap
plewood.
Seven varieties of domestic beer
are also available on tap, if one
prefers to buy American. And any
beer will accent your pizza — which is
probably not news to most of you.
The Applewood Inn is a place to be
aggressively adventurous about ex
perimenting with new pizza combina
tions. Of course, all the standard
favorites are available, but so are
pastrami, shrimp, capers, clams, ar
tichokes, avocados, etc.
We ordered the pizzas at the
counter, as well as some soup and
salad, then proceeded to the bar.
The beverage selection process was
just as difficult as the choice of pizza
— in addition to beer, they offer
wine, champagne, espresso and soft
drinks.
Plenty of tables and booths were
available, with most patrons concen
trated near the two televisions at the
time to witness the Bears' domination
over the Patriots. But, when our
number was called, it was the food
that caught our attention .. . more

than the lopsided game.
The Hungarian goulash soup
($1.25 a cup) boasted generous
chunks of tender beef and a nice sam
pling of vegetables, accented by a
light yet hearty broth.
The salad ($2.50) would have
made a fine exhibit in a horticulture
class, as it contained almost every

vegetable ever seen in a salad.
The blue cheese dressing won't win
any awards though. It more closely
resembled a ranch dressing textured
with cottage cheese than the expected
blue variety. It wouldn't be classified
as a house specialty, but it was easily
palatable.
The langos (or Hungarian garlic

bread), however, is a specialty,
and we would recommend it most
adamantly. Two large cloves of fresh
garlic accompany this slightly salted
and piping hot deep-fried dough, and
one can season the langos to any
degree of strength.
Our pizzas arrived straight from
the oven before the appetizers could
be finished. Your reviewers opted for
two different combinations —
avocado, mushroom and artichoke
($5.75) and clam and artichoke ($5).
Both pizzas were excellent, though
the latter would have to take the
prize.
The crust was cooked to a perfect
consistency — slightly crispy on the
bottom, while still hot and a bit chewy
in the middle. The mozzarella cheese
and toppings were applied
generously, and the tomato sauce had
a pleasant, yet not overpowering, zest
to it.
Officially, our pizzas were the small
(10-inch) size, but hunger was cer
tainly not an issue upon completing
our meal. For the bigger eaters, five
sizes of pizza are available — all the
way up to 18-inchers. Prices for piz

zas with one topping range from
$4.25 to $13.25.
And if you don't want pizza, there
are plenty of other inviting entrees.
Hamburgers, Polish sausage with
sauerkraut, or sandwiches might ap
peal to you ($2.75 to $4.25). If not,
try the veal ($8.50) or the pasta
($4.50 to $530).
Pizza was our only choice because
of the special limited Sunday menu,
but we happen to know that the
crepes at Applewood are delicious
specialties — and a rare item around
the Stanford area. Stuffed with
turkey, ham, shrimp or mushroom in
a white Bechamel sauce, the crepes
are served in pairs for $2.25.
There are also dessert crepes
(blintzes) with cottage cheese for the
same price.
All the food at Applewood is
served with disposable plates and sil
verware. The European-style restau
rant offers take-out service for any
item on the menu. But we recom
mend that you dine there and enjoy
the pleasant atmosphere . . . espe
cially if you've had enough of food
service pizza.
