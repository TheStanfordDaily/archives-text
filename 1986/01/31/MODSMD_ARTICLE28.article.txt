# Hodgepodge in San Jose
## 
### LISA LYNCH Editorial staff 
When my parents were driving me from the airport to
Stanford at the beginning of my freshman year, my
mother had her first sight of the highway sign "San Fran
sisco/San Jose" on Route 101. She immediately burst into
song.
The resulting scuffle (which ensued after I tried to
muffle the last few bars of "Do You Know The Way To
.. by clapping my hand over her mouth) made me
swear I'd never go to San Jose. Soon after arriving at
Stanford I discovered that the place seems to have the
reputation of the McDonald's of Bay Area cities, so it
wasn't hard to keep away.
Last weekend, spurred by the announcement of a Com
puter Arts Festival taking place throughout the city, I
made my first visit to downtown San Jose. I took a friend
along to help me explore the place, so we decided to
devote equal time to the art exhibits I wanted to see and
to San Jose's biggest tourist attraction (tourist trap?) the
Winchester Mystery House.
We tried to ease our way into the city by having brunch
somewhere in between Palo Alto and San Jose. I chose
the Rancho Grandview, which is perched high in the San
Jose Foothills, near the summit of Mt. Hamilton Road
(take the Alum Rock Parkway exit on 101 and then turn
off on Mt. Hamilton).
The drive up to the restuarant was breathtaking, though
twisty. But don't worry — if you have a weak stomach, it
will have plenty of time to settle before you eat, because
the Rancho takes forever to serve their food. Luckily the
wait stimulated our appetites, because the food certainly
didn't — my little packages of Smucker's grape jelly were
buried in my "tomato" omelette (Heinz ketchup, 1
believe), my Wonder Bread toast was too dry, and my
friend's Eggs Benedict had an indescribably bland sauce.
It wasn't bad food, if you're a fan of diners that don't
think they're diners, and the view from the big plate-glass
windows almost made up for the "Looking for Mr. Good
bar" decor. Make reservations; this place seems popular
with the locals.
After eating, we headed down into the city. I saw a lot
of what I expected to see — flat dirty streets lined with
psuedo-Spanish architecture, drunks leaning on signposts,
deserted stores. But standing in contrast to the non
descript, run-down parts of the city are many beautiful (or
interesting) modern buildings and several breathtaking
older ones. San Jose State University is the oldest Califor
nia university; The Peralta Adobe and St. Josephs Church
are also wonderful old buildings. The San Jose Court

house, Convention Center and Civic Center have all been
erected in recent years; their huge, white, post-modern
presences further reinforce the architectural anarchy.
After trying to find a parking space (impossible and ex
pensive) we wandered through what's being billed as San
Jose's "New Downtown"; a neighborhood attempting a
cultural revival. There are numerous small restaurants, a
cafe/bookstore appropriately called The Phoenix, and an
excellent revival movie-house, Camera Three, whose
movie schedule rivals any I've seen in the Bay Area.
We headed for the art musuem, which had two exhibits
I wanted to see: an enchanting exhibit of children's art en
titled SPLASH, and selections from San Jose State's
CADRE exhibit. CADRE is an acronym for Computers
in Art Design-Research and Education, whatever that
means. This is the second CADRE festival; the first, in
1984, was also in San Jose.
A tour of the CADRE exhibits is an intriguing intro
duction to computer culture. Everythine,insm computer
portraiture and "fine art" to fractal geofhetry and talking
telephones is included, the work of East and West Coast
artists, research scientists, designers and architects.
Unfortunately, to see the whole exhibit you have to hop
around from place to place, and that isn't too easy to do,
given the aforementioned parking problems and
sometimes confusing city layout. If you have the time and
the interest, there are six exhibits continuing through
early February.
San Jose State University has computer games, includ
ing one created by Lucasfilm game division, and an ex
hibition entititled "Fractals, A New Geometry for Visual
Art."
San Jose Museum of Art: A design/architecture exhibit
using computer-aided form and computer-aided videos by
East Coast artist John Logue, who does a series of 30-
second portraits of artists such as Philip Glass.
Triton Museum of Art: More computer videos, these by
Max Akmy and Jon Sanborne.
San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art: "The Artist
and the Computer — New Portraiture."
The San Jose Art League: "Personal Computers and
Fine Art"; experimental and explorative art created on
Apple and Macintosh computers.
I imagine the CADRE exhibits will go a long way
toward alleviating one of San Jose's greatest hangups —
its image problem. Having a bad image is a bad enough
thing, but San Jose doesn't seem to have any image at all.
San Fransisco has its bridge, Carmel its twisty trees,
Berkeley has Berkeley, even Oakland has made the press
for not having anything there. San Jose has a tacky song
about its name, but no real recognizable monument.

Some of the CADRE artists' exhibit chose to address
this problem, particularly Jerry Yaznkawa, whose work is
on exhibit at the San Jose Museum of Art. Yaznkawa has
created what he feels is an equivalent (roughly) of either
the Eiffel Tower, the Golden Gate Bridge or the Seattle
Space Needle. His idea is to place two neon arcs — one
red and one blue — along a particularly graceful curved
stretch of San Jose's Central Freeway. The resulting
"environmental light sculpture" is presented both in a
scaled model and in large computer-generated
photographs. It is rather impressive — one imagines the
arcs charmingly haloed by evening fog or morning smog.
By the time we finished looking at children's drawings
and computer videos, we had barely enough time to catch
the last guided tour at the Winchester Mystery House.
Luckily it was easy to find, crouching nervously in the
middle of a group of shopping malls and fast-food places
at the edge of the downtown area. I'd be nervous too; the
neighborhood has changed a lot since Sarah Winchester
began her 38-year, 160-room project.
According to legend, Sarah was told by spirits that the
deaths of her son and husband were brought about by the
angry spirits of those killed by the Winchester rifle. She'd

be the next to go if she didn't build continuously, accord
ing to their specifications. She built until her death in
1922, and the resulting weirdly appealing structure can be
seen every day except Christmas, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., if you
purchase a 65-minute guided tour.
The tours are heinously expensive — $8 with a $l-off
coupon you can pick up at any Tourist Information Center
— but if you're a connoisseur of kitsch it's worth it. Our
tour guide had a marvelous way of bulging her eyes out
whenever she showed us anything that seemed particu
larly mysterious, such as stairs that lead up to the ceiling,
chimneys that don't pierce the roof and the continous
repetition of the number" 13."
After our tour, we debated whether to buy something
from the Mystery House Gift Shop, such as a Rambo
bumpersticker or Winchester wool-blend sweater. My
friend chose a souvenir that represented perfectly our ex
periences in San Jose — a plastic Winchester Mystery
House ruler with designs that change when you tilt the
ruler towards or away from you.
Like San Jose, it was a perfect blend of education, ugli
ness, utility, weirdness and kitsch.

windows almost made up for the "Looking for Mr. Good
bar" decor. Make reservations; this place seems popular
with the locals.
After eating, we headed down into the city. I saw a lot
of what I expected to see — flat dirty streets lined with
psuedo-Spanish architecture, drunks leaning on signposts,
deserted stores. But standing in contrast to the non
descript, run-down parts of the city are many beautiful (or
interesting) modern buildings and several breathtaking
older ones. San Jose State University is the oldest Califor
nia university; The Peralta Adobe and St. Josephs Church
are also wonderful old buildings. The San Jose Court

house, Convention Center and Civic Center have all been
erected in recent years; their huge, white, post-modern
presences further reinforce the architectural anarchy.
After trying to find a parking space (impossible and ex
pensive) we wandered through what's being billed as San
Jose's "New Downtown"; a neighborhood attempting a
cultural revival. There are numerous small restaurants, a
cafe/bookstore appropriately called The Phoenix, and an
excellent revival movie-house, Camera Three, whose
movie schedule rivals any I've seen in the Bay Area.
We headed for the art musuem, which had two exhibits
I wanted to see: an enchanting exhibit of children's art en
titled SPLASH, and selections from San Jose State's
CADRE exhibit. CADRE is an acronym for Computers
in Art Design-Research and Education, whatever that
means. This is the second CADRE festival; the first, in
1984, was also in San Jose.
A tour of the CADRE exhibits is an intriguing intro
duction to computer culture. Everythine,insm computer
portraiture and "fine art" to fractal geofhetry and talking
telephones is included, the work of East and West Coast
artists, research scientists, designers and architects.
Unfortunately, to see the whole exhibit you have to hop
around from place to place, and that isn't too easy to do,
given the aforementioned parking problems and
sometimes confusing city layout. If you have the time and
the interest, there are six exhibits continuing through
early February.
San Jose State University has computer games, includ
ing one created by Lucasfilm game division, and an ex
hibition entititled "Fractals, A New Geometry for Visual
Art."
San Jose Museum of Art: A design/architecture exhibit
using computer-aided form and computer-aided videos by
East Coast artist John Logue, who does a series of 30-
second portraits of artists such as Philip Glass.
Triton Museum of Art: More computer videos, these by
Max Akmy and Jon Sanborne.
San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art: "The Artist
and the Computer — New Portraiture."
The San Jose Art League: "Personal Computers and
Fine Art"; experimental and explorative art created on
Apple and Macintosh computers.
I imagine the CADRE exhibits will go a long way
toward alleviating one of San Jose's greatest hangups —
its image problem. Having a bad image is a bad enough
thing, but San Jose doesn't seem to have any image at all.
San Fransisco has its bridge, Carmel its twisty trees,
Berkeley has Berkeley, even Oakland has made the press
for not having anything there. San Jose has a tacky song
about its name, but no real recognizable monument.

Some of the CADRE artists' exhibit chose to address
this problem, particularly Jerry Yaznkawa, whose work is
on exhibit at the San Jose Museum of Art. Yaznkawa has
created what he feels is an equivalent (roughly) of either
the Eiffel Tower, the Golden Gate Bridge or the Seattle
Space Needle. His idea is to place two neon arcs — one
red and one blue — along a particularly graceful curved
stretch of San Jose's Central Freeway. The resulting
"environmental light sculpture" is presented both in a
scaled model and in large computer-generated
photographs. It is rather impressive — one imagines the
arcs charmingly haloed by evening fog or morning smog.
By the time we finished looking at children's drawings
and computer videos, we had barely enough time to catch
the last guided tour at the Winchester Mystery House.
Luckily it was easy to find, crouching nervously in the
middle of a group of shopping malls and fast-food places
at the edge of the downtown area. I'd be nervous too; the
neighborhood has changed a lot since Sarah Winchester
began her 38-year, 160-room project.
According to legend, Sarah was told by spirits that the
deaths of her son and husband were brought about by the
angry spirits of those killed by the Winchester rifle. She'd

be the next to go if she didn't build continuously, accord
ing to their specifications. She built until her death in
1922, and the resulting weirdly appealing structure can be
seen every day except Christmas, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., if you
purchase a 65-minute guided tour.
The tours are heinously expensive — $8 with a $l-off
coupon you can pick up at any Tourist Information Center
— but if you're a connoisseur of kitsch it's worth it. Our
tour guide had a marvelous way of bulging her eyes out
whenever she showed us anything that seemed particu
larly mysterious, such as stairs that lead up to the ceiling,
chimneys that don't pierce the roof and the continous
repetition of the number" 13."
After our tour, we debated whether to buy something
from the Mystery House Gift Shop, such as a Rambo
bumpersticker or Winchester wool-blend sweater. My
friend chose a souvenir that represented perfectly our ex
periences in San Jose — a plastic Winchester Mystery
House ruler with designs that change when you tilt the
ruler towards or away from you.
Like San Jose, it was a perfect blend of education, ugli
ness, utility, weirdness and kitsch.

When my parents were driving me from the airport to
Stanford at the beginning of my freshman year, my
mother had her first sight of the highway sign "San Fran
sisco/San Jose" on Route 101. She immediately burst into
song.
The resulting scuffle (which ensued after I tried to
muffle the last few bars of "Do You Know The Way To
.. by clapping my hand over her mouth) made me
swear I'd never go to San Jose. Soon after arriving at
Stanford I discovered that the place seems to have the
reputation of the McDonald's of Bay Area cities, so it
wasn't hard to keep away.
Last weekend, spurred by the announcement of a Com
puter Arts Festival taking place throughout the city, I
made my first visit to downtown San Jose. I took a friend
along to help me explore the place, so we decided to
devote equal time to the art exhibits I wanted to see and
to San Jose's biggest tourist attraction (tourist trap?) the
Winchester Mystery House.
We tried to ease our way into the city by having brunch
somewhere in between Palo Alto and San Jose. I chose
the Rancho Grandview, which is perched high in the San
Jose Foothills, near the summit of Mt. Hamilton Road
(take the Alum Rock Parkway exit on 101 and then turn
off on Mt. Hamilton).
The drive up to the restuarant was breathtaking, though
twisty. But don't worry — if you have a weak stomach, it
will have plenty of time to settle before you eat, because
the Rancho takes forever to serve their food. Luckily the
wait stimulated our appetites, because the food certainly
didn't — my little packages of Smucker's grape jelly were
buried in my "tomato" omelette (Heinz ketchup, 1
believe), my Wonder Bread toast was too dry, and my
friend's Eggs Benedict had an indescribably bland sauce.
It wasn't bad food, if you're a fan of diners that don't
think they're diners, and the view from the big plate-glass
windows almost made up for the "Looking for Mr. Good
