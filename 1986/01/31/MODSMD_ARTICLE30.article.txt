## A.C.T.'s 'You Never Can Tell' dwells on Shaw gimmicks 
### PETER MORGAN Staff writer 
"This family is no place for a father!" exclaims one of the characters at the
height of the excitement in George Bernard Shaw's "You Never Can Tell,"
which opened Tuesday at American Conservatory Theatre.
Fathers and family, husbands and wives, children and society are the selec
ted topics for Shaw's roving critical eye. Known as the "talky" major dramatist
of the modern era, Shaw often minimized plot in presenting his views on the
evils of contemporary society.
A lifelong socialist (founder of the Fabians), Shaw advocated women's
rights, sexual freedom and a multitude of other positions aimed at tearing
down the stuffy Victorian society he felt modern England had outgrown.
Shaw was a great social agitator, no doubt, but his plays often drag on end
lessly with monologues of social comment and little action in between. Even
character portrayal, which Anton Chekhov created with minimal on-stage ac
tion, seems a minor consideration in comparison to Shaw's designs of changing
the world. The "play of ideas" was Shaw's invention, and understandably so.
As a result, Shavian plays are a game of hit and miss in terms of
producability. "St. Joan," "Major Barbara," "Pygmalion," "Heartbreak
House," "Misalliance" and "Arms and the Man" have all been produced with
great success. Other plays lack the fluidity or drive of these and seem
impossible to present without the audience falling asleep.
"You Never Can Tell," a light comedy about sex and marriage, falls some
where between these two extremes.
The plot, if it can be called such, revolves around the Clandon family. Mrs.
Clandon has raised her three children (Dolly, Phil, and Gloria) by herself in
the "modern way" ever since her husband left her 18 years before. The long
lost father appears accidentally at lunch one day during the Clandon's seaside
vacation. The conflict between the mother and father about their past, the

children and the role of women becomes the showcase for Shaw's views about
raising children.
Interwoven with the debate over custody of Dolly and Phil (the young
children) is the courtship of Gloria (the eldest) by Valentine, a "five-shilling"
dentist with a penchant for modern women who practices near the Clandons'
hotel. Their conflict over "scientific" and "sentimental" love becomes another
showcase, this time for the author's views on love and marriage.
In the end, all is resolved by the appearance of Mr. Bohun, an insightful and
egotistic lawyer-turned-psychiatrist who is the son of the ever-present head
waiter of the hotel. The waiter, like many servants in plays, steals the show
with his comic wit and insight into the lives of his masters.
Of the two plots, Gloria and Valentine's is easily the stronger. Their argu
ments and declamations on "modern" love capture Shaw at his best: playful,
light, comic and intellectually engaging.
In contrast, the dialogue between Dolly, Phil and the parents plods along
heavily, with very little interesting to add. This is Shaw at his worst, when he
treats the drama as essay. With an uneven balance of stimulating subject mat
ter, this play needs a delicate touch in production.
Delicacy, unfortunately, is something A.C.T. did not bring to their produc
tion. The performance felt less like an intriguing discussion of love, marriage
and family than a self-conscious display of "doing" Shaw as an exercise in
style.
I find more and more that A.C.T. shows are belaboredly "stylistic," whether
the company is staging Shakespeare, Wilder, Shaw or a new playwright. In the
present case the show felt, in every aspect from acting and directing to
costumes and music, like an isolated "style" to be admired with the detach
ment one displays toward a museum exhibit.
The biggest problem, maybe the only one, was that the production
desperately fought to make the wordiness of the text light and fluid. This is the
right approach to producing Shaw, but only if the final product actually is light

and fluid.
The A.C.T. show was not, and because of it much of the evening became a
display of British accents, character acting and comic bits.
The battle against the text showed in the acting ensemble's nervousness.
Even for an opening night, it was startlingly high. Scot Bishop, as in earlier
shows, seemed vocally tense and unable to enjoy the playfulness of his charac
ter. William McKerghan as the father and Drew Eshelman as the family lawyer
both hid in the stock antics of character comedy without much laughter in
return for it.
Although highly energetic as the young Dolly, Michelle Casey seemed more
like a modern American girl than a turn-of-the-century Victorian. This might
be director Janice Hutchins' intention (Dolly is, after all, a "modern" child),
but it clashed rather awkwardly with the period costumes and the movement of
the other cast.
The show does have its strengths, however. William Paterson calmly and
confidently plays the waiter. Although this is an "audience-pleaser" part that
really can't fail, Paterson's relaxed performance, unlike the other tense ones,
allows us to relax and enjoy ourselves.
More impressive even than Paterson's performance was Mark Murphey's in
the role of Valentine. This is not a "stacked" role, so Murphey's success with
the audience was all the greater. Of the many cast members that stumbled on
lines, Murphey was the only one who incorporated his mistake into his charac
ter and maintained the flow of the dialogue. This calmness and confidence sup
ported his entire performance, and his "duets" with Gloria were both the fun
niest and the most stimulating parts of the production.
If an amateur company or university had done this show, I would be ranting
and raving about its high quality. As the most reputable of Bay Area theaters,
however, I, like most people, set high expectations for A.C.T. Unfortunately,
they were not met by this production.
