## Card hoops going in opposite directions Men heading north on the Oregon trail

It's revenge time for the Stanford men's basketball
team tonight as the Cardinal travels to Eugene's McAr
thur Court to face Oregon in a Pacific 10 Conference
matchup. Tip-off is at 7:30 p.m.
Eleven days ago the Ducks came into Maples Pavilion
and handed Stanford an 83-69 loss. It was Oregon's only
Pac-10 victory in eight tries so far this season, and came at
the end of a stretch that saw the Cardinal play three games
in five days.
Since then, the Ducks have had a hard time of it, losing
four straight â€” to Washington and Washington State at
home, and at Arizona State and Arizona. They are all
alone in the league basement at 1-7, 6-12 overall.

Stanford is coming off its biggest win of the season, a
76-70 decision at home against UCLA last Thursday. The
Cardinal is now in a four-way tie for fifth place with
UCLA, Arizona State and USC. Stanford is 3-4 in the
Pac-10, 9-10 overall.
The Cardinal seems to be healthy for this weekend, al
though seniors Steve Brown and Earl Koberlein are both
out for the season. Novian Whitsitt, who missed four
games with a pulled back muscle, returned to action
against UCLA and popped in 19 points. Andy Fischer's
ribs and Howard Wright's ankles are still sore, but both
will play.
Freshman Todd Lichti is slated to start again at guard,
putting Fischer into the lineup at small forward and
leaving Whitsitt coming off the bench. Lichti remains
Stanford's leading scorer, averaging 16.6 points per out
ing, including 15 against Oregon the first time around.
In that game, Oregon guard Anthony Taylor poured in
24 points to help down the Cardinal. Taylor leads the
Ducks with a 17.1 points-per-game average.
Ducks Coach Don Monson has held a jinx over the
Cardinal, winning all five of his encounters with Tom
Davis' Stanford teams. The Cardinal's last win came three
years ago in Eugene, when it shot a Pac-10 record 77 per
cent from the field to win 80-74.
Sunday the Cardinal heads an hour up old Highway 99
to Corvallis to face Oregon State. The Beavers are slump
ing a bit, having lost their last three games after a 4-0 start
