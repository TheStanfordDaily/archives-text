# Women traveling to Tempe to take on the Sun Devils
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
Last fall, before even the most
scrupulous Stanford student started
preparing for midterms, Stanford
Basketball Coach Tara VanDerveer
was already talking about report
cards.
These gauges, however, had noth
ing to do with the classes the mem
bers of the Stanford women's basket
ball team were taking. She was refer
ring to future rematches against
early-season opponents; contests that
would mark Cardinal improvement
during the course of this season.
This Saturday, following tonight's
game against the Arizona State Sun
Devils in Tempe, Ariz., the Stanford
Cardinal will travel to Tucson to
receive its first report card of the
season, a repeat showdown against
the Arizona Wildcats.
Last November, in the champion
ship game of the Anheuser-Busch
Tip-Off Classic at San Jose State,
Wildcat guard Lava Acosta, as she
had done during the entire second
half, ran in and around the Stanford
defense on her way to the winning
layup with seven seconds remaining.
Stanford had led at one juncture by
11 points, but Lava's second-half
eruption spearheaded the Wildcats'
resurgence.
This year Acosta is still burning op
posing defenses. The 5-foot-7 junior
guard is the Wildcats' leading scorer
at 16.9 points per game. Other offen
sive contributors include forward
Yolanda Turner, at 14.9 per game,
and guard Kirsten Smith, at 11.3.
According to Stanford Asst. Coach
Julie Plank, the Cardinal won't show
Arizona any new looks but will hope
a tough man-on-man defense can
contain Acosta. This tough task will
fall into the hands of Virginia Sourlis
and standout defensive guard Erica
Mueser.
The Cardinal eagerly awaits the
Wildcat rematch but will first have to
check the potent offensive attack of
Arizona State tonight. The Sun
Devils' 80.4 points per game average

makes them one of the top 10 offen
sive teams in the nation.
Leading the potent Arizona State
offense is junior forward Sherry
Poole, who averages 14.9 points per
game. Two other juniors, forward
Shamona Mosley and guard Robin
Connolly, are the next top net
burners, at 13.5 each. Mosley also
leads the team in rebounds with 6.9
boards per contest.
"We're going to play man-to-man
(defense)," Plank said. "They have
excellent outside shooters. USC tried
to play a zone against them and they
buried everything. We thought our
tougher game would be on Saturday,
but ASU beat Arizona at Arizona so
that may not be the case."

The Cardinal (11-8). having lost its
