# Men's golf tied for 10th in tight Tucson tourney
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
The key word describing the first round of the Mich
elob National Invitational yesterday in Tucson is
"bunched". For both teams and individuals, scores
were so bunched together that the results are very
much up in the air.
One conclusion that could be drawn is that the Stan
ford men's golf team is tied for 10th place out of 15
teams with the University of the Pacific with a score of
379. But that position is deceiving, as the Cardinal is
only seven strokes out of fourth place and only 20 be
hind tournament leader Arkansas.
"We're moving in the right direction," Stanford
Coach Tim Schaaf said.
Arkansas' team score of 359 was described by
Schaaf as "exceptional." Schaaf said he had expected
the scores of second-place Arizona State or third-place
North Carolina (364 and 365, respectively) to be more
typical of the leader.
Texas Christian sits atop the group of eight that fol
lows UNC with a score of 372. New Mexico State and
Texas-El Paso are just one stroke behind at 373.
Oregon is in seventh place at 375, followed by USC
at 377, host school Arizona at 378, Stanford and UOP.
"We're obviously way behind Arkansas," Schaaf
said. "But (with) two rounds to go, we're not out of it.
Neither is anybody else.
"It's harder for a team to play really hot for three
days," he said. "The pressure is on longer. There are

still 10 scores left to count. (Also), the rain can make
things move around even more."
To illustrate how well things went for Arkansas, con
sider that John Sadie, the sixth man on their six man
team, shot a four-under-par 68 to lead the individuals.
In second place is Arizona State's Rich Beitz with a
score of 70, and then, a bunch â€” Texas-El Paso's Rick
Todd, UNC's John Hughes and Greg Parker,
Colorado's Kevin Bolles, Arkansas' John Daly and
New Mexico State's Roger Good, all at 71. Five more
players followed at 72.
Stanford's scores did not defy the trend. Carl Wag
ner and Roger Miraglia, with rounds of 75 and 78,
respectively, were the bookends surrounding scores of
76 by Don Walsworth, Brad Geer, Rich Marik and
Casey Pittock.
"Almost everybody today had potentially a much
better round going," Schaaf said. "In Santa Barbara
(the team's previous tournament), we were pretty
much carried by Carl Wagner's effort. Don Walsworth
played reasonably well, but the rest did not do as well
as expected. We kind of squeaked into third.
"We did not have the one or two low scores you
need to win the tournament," he added. "Everyone
played steadily (though), which is a good thing."
Some of the players had poor individual holes, which
caused their final scores to belie the quality of their
overall play. Walsworth, for example, had double and
triple bogies on two of the first three holes, but then
shot one under par the rest of the round.
