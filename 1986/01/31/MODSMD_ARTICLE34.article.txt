# Gymnasts test top rating
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
For the first time in the history of
men's gymnastics at Stanford, the
team is ranked No. 1 in the country.
So the gymnasts should be really
excited, right? They should be more
committed than ever to really excel,
right?
Wrong.
What does this No. 1 ranking
mean? "Nothing," Cardinal Coach
Sadao Hamada said, "We just try our
best."
"It doesn't mean anything," agreed
co-captain Jon Louis. "The only thing
it means is that we're on the right
track."
While the ranking won't affect the
Stanford gymnasts, it will affect the
opposition and judging. The Cardinal
will be treated with more respect than
ever before.
"They (opponents) will be in
timidated," lx>uis said. "They'll also

want to beat us more."
Speaking on the effect on judging,
Hamada said, "There may be some
(effect); they usually have their own
opinions. Certainly, it's not going to
go against us."
The teams which will give Stanford
its first test since the rankings camc
out are Nebraska, Minnesota and
California. This weekend's competi
tion will also include Fullerton State
and New Mexico, but they are not ex
pected to provide much of a chal
lenge.
This weekend has a catch, though.
The Cardinal must not only travel
down to Fullerton for tonight's meet,
but must then fly back to face Califor
nia in Berkeley on Saturday night.
Hamada thinks that this could have
definite impact on tomorrow's com
petition. "If my guys are tired, and
Berkeley gives a good performance,
we could be in trouble."
The Bears will be led by sopho
more John Omori. A U.S. National

Team member, Omori is at his best
on the parallel bars, having captured
the Pacific 10 Conference title last
year.
Stanford will be in some trouble,
regardless of travel, when it faces
perennial powerhouse Nebraska this
evening. The Cornhuskers, ranked
No. 5 in the nation, have boasted
many Olympians in their history and
have the 1985 individual all-around
NCAA champion, Wes Suter, this
season. Other standouts include Tom
Schlesinger and Kevin Davis.
Although they are not in the top 10
nationwide, Minnesota could also
prove a tough team to beat, according
to Hamada. "If they put their
strongest team in, they can be as good
as Nebraska." he said. Up to this
point, the Gophers have not entered
their top team in a meet.
Despite going into what Hamada
called the team's "toughest
weekend," the team is relaxed.
"We're a pretty casual team." co
captain Mark Arnold said.
