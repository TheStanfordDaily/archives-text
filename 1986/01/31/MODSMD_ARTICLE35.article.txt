# Baseball out for today
## Fullerton series threatened by bad weather 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
Take one step outside, and it
should be as clear as day why baseball
wasn't meant to be played during the
winter months. In a word — rain.
Look at it this way. Ever get
physics and English majors together
in the same room? Nothing much
goes on, right?
Well, that's about as well as
baseball and rain mix. Combine those
two and what have you got? A whole
lot of nothing.
There will be nothing played at
Stanford's Sunken Diamond today. If
the weather had cooperated, the
Cardinal would have hosted Fullerton
State at 2 p.m. in the first game of a
three-game weekend series.
It would have been a match be
tween a Fullerton team that's ranked
No. 10 in the country, according to
the ESPN/Collegiate Baseball Poll,
and a Stanford squad that is No. 11.
And it would have been a chance for
each team to test its new players
against major college competition.
Fullerton, like Stanford, has plenty
to prove. Gone are third baseman
John Fishel, who hit .331 last year
with 19 homeruns and 85 RBI, and
Shane Turner, .406 and 46 RBI. That
leaves only Jeff Garcia, a second
team All-Pacific Coast Athletic Asso
ciation performer, as the only big
name from a 1985 team that finished
36-32-1 overall.
The Titans were expected to start
Mike Harkey, 3-4 with a 3.69 ERA a
year ago, today. Mike Belanger, 9-5
with 4.47 ERA, and Gil Villanueva
were penciled in as Saturday's and
Sunday's pitchers.
"Win or lose, we're excited about
playing," Fullerton Coach Augie
Garrido said. "Either way, we'll get
much needed information from the
Stanford series about our team."
That is, of course, if the Titans ever
leave the Los Angeles area.
As things stand now, the teams will
be lucky to get any games in at all.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said
yesterday that he would decide early
this morning whether Fullerton
should make the trip north from Or
ange County.
If both Marquess and the weather
permit, the teams will try to play a
doubleheader Saturday starting at
noon and then a single game Sunday
at 1 p.m. That's if Sunken Diamond
can be made fit for play. "If we can
get the field ready, we might be able

to play some baseball," Marquess
said.
Stanford's facility is renowned for
its resiliency and drainage capacity,
but one has to wonder whether it can
withstand four or five days of rain.
Garrido, at least, is eager to play
this weekend. "The status is that
we're making every attempt to get the
series in," he said. "I'm excited for
our players to get a chance to play."
Marquess, for his part, seemed am
bivalent. "It's (the weather) not
ideal," he said, "but no one else is
playing, either. We've already gotten
in a couple of games — no one else
has," referring to last weekend's pair
of Stanford wins against San Jose
State.
Marquess intends to stick with his

starting rotation. That means Jack
McDowell, 1-0 on the year, will start
the first game of Saturday's twinbill.
A 1 Osuna, 1-0, will start the second
game while Rob Wassenaar will pitch
in Sunday's finale.
Card notes
If Fullerton doesn't come north but
the weather clears and Sunken Dia
mond is ready for baseball, Marquess
said that Stanford might contact a
local team to play either Saturday or
Sunday. There is no word on possible
opponents.
Fullerton's Mike Belanger is the
son of former major league star Mark
Belanger. The elder Belanger was a
Gold Glove shortstop with the Bal
timore Orioles.

permit, the teams will try to play a
doubleheader Saturday starting at
noon and then a single game Sunday
at 1 p.m. That's if Sunken Diamond
can be made fit for play. "If we can
get the field ready, we might be able

to play some baseball," Marquess
said.
Stanford's facility is renowned for
its resiliency and drainage capacity,
but one has to wonder whether it can
withstand four or five days of rain.
Garrido, at least, is eager to play
this weekend. "The status is that
we're making every attempt to get the
series in," he said. "I'm excited for
our players to get a chance to play."
Marquess, for his part, seemed am
bivalent. "It's (the weather) not
ideal," he said, "but no one else is
playing, either. We've already gotten
in a couple of games — no one else
has," referring to last weekend's pair
of Stanford wins against San Jose
State.
Marquess intends to stick with his

starting rotation. That means Jack
McDowell, 1-0 on the year, will start
the first game of Saturday's twinbill.
A 1 Osuna, 1-0, will start the second
game while Rob Wassenaar will pitch
in Sunday's finale.
Card notes
If Fullerton doesn't come north but
the weather clears and Sunken Dia
mond is ready for baseball, Marquess
said that Stanford might contact a
local team to play either Saturday or
Sunday. There is no word on possible
opponents.
Fullerton's Mike Belanger is the
son of former major league star Mark
Belanger. The elder Belanger was a
Gold Glove shortstop with the Bal
timore Orioles.

second game of Stanford's twinbill with Fullerton State. The Titans are
