# Women swimmers to battle ASU
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff writer 
T he undefeated Stanford women's
swimming team returns to DeGuerre
Pool today after four meets on the
road, hosting Arizona State at 2 p.m.
1 he Cardinal, 4-0 overall and
ranked third in the preseason polls,
returned from last weekend's trip
down south with victories over USC
(103-37) and UCLA (102-38).
Arizona State, unranked in the
preseason polls, will be facing some

tough competition this afternoon
when it takes on the Cardinal. In both
of last weekend's meets, Stanford
captured 12 of 16 events.
"Basically, we are training right
through this meet," Coach George
Haines said. "We will be taking the
meet seriously, but our eyes may be
looking a little ahead to Texas and we
want to train for that. Whatever hap
pens today happens; we aren't going
to stress over it too much."
So far this season the Cardinal's
victories have been blazoned with

teamwork. Already seven individuals
and four relays have qualified for this
year's NCAA Championships in a
total of 16 events.
It would be easy to say that the
Cardinal is led by one or two key
swimmers, but, fortunately, that is
hardly true. Seniors Diana Zock,
Kathy Smith and Patty Gavin, junior
Susan Rapp, sophomores Stacy
Shupe, Stephanie Norton and Jenn
ifer Pokluda and freshmen Jenna
Johnson, Aimee Berzins and Mi
chelle Donahue have all been contri

buting to this season's successful
record.
Arizona State's top swimmer is ex
pected to be junior Teri Baxter, an
All-American in the 100 and 200-
yard breaststroke events. Baxter, who
finished seventh in both the 100 and
200-meter breaststrokes in the 1984
Olympic Trials, should be the only
challenger to Stanford's Smith.
Smith, holding the Cardinal's best
times in both the 100 (1:03.49) and
the 200 breaststrokes (2:18.56), has
qualified for the NCAAs in both
events. According to Haines, the 100
breaststroke race between Smith and
Baxter should be a good one. The
200 breaststroke will not be swum
today.
In the butterfly events, Arizona
State will have Caroline Cast and
Beda Leirvaag facing off against
Stanford's Susan Rapp and Jenna
Johnson, among others. Leirvaag
qualified last year in the 200 butterfly
and the 200 and 400 individual med
leys.
Johnson, a 1984 Olympic medalist,
has thus far qualified for three
NCAA events, while Rapp, also an
Olympian, has qualified for two.
"Jenna will start off with the 100
free as her first race and she should
be pretty fresh," Haines said. "She
should have a pretty good race
there."
In the freestyle events, Haines will
be looking for good times from Ber
zins, Michelle Chapman and Dana
Anderson.
In the backstroke events, junior
Stephanie Lister, an NCAA qualifier
last year in the 100, should be the
only competition presented by
Arizona State for Stanford's
Donahue, Gavin and Pokluda.
Arizona State's 200-medley-relay
team is also expected to give the
Cardinal a good race.
