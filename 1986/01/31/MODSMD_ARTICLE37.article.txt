### BRANDI WATSON Staff writer 
The Stanford sailing team will be on the road this weekend, taking 16
sailors to compete in the South Series 1 and 2 Regatta to be held on Mis
sion Bay in San Diego.
The Cardinal, a member of the Northern California division, will be
sailing against Southern California division schools this weekend, giving
it practice in its winter offseason.
"This regatta enables us to sail against the best competition in our dis
trict," Coach Joe Petrucci said. "But if we do poorly, we do poorly. It
doesn't matter."
The team has declared winter quarter its offseason in order to allow
sailors to concentrate on academics before the rigorous practice and
competition schedule in the spring. Even without mandatory practices
now, Petrucci has high expectations for his team.
"I know we'll be in the top three, and 1 hope to be in the top two,"
Petrucci said. "Our main competition is UC-lrvine and USC.
"If we beat UCI and USC we go up in the rankings a few notches, and
if we don't, we stay where we are," Petrucci said. "It is an inexorable war
in that respect."
Neither the Stanford team nor any of the other schools in the regatta
will have coaches in attendance. All the coaches will be taking part in a
National Coaches Conference held at the same time.
