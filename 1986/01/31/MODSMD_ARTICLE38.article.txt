# McCarthy earns honor
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
The top honor for individuals in
women's college golf, a position on
the Curtis Cup Team, was awarded
to Stanford's Kathleen McCarthy
this week.
Every two years, the U.S. Golf
Association names eight women to
the team which meets a squad from
the British Isles. In 1984, Stan
ford s Joanne Pasillo, who also won
a U.S. Amateur Championship,

was named to play in the Cup.
"It's pretty exciting," McCarthy
said yesterday."I kind of had an
idea I had a good chance of being
on it. I didn't want to get too
excited 'til I heard the news."
McCarthy was ranked the fourth
best amateur in the United States
by Golf Digest last year. She won
the Women's Western Amateur
tournament in Ann Arbor, Mich, in
1985. In 1984, her freshman year,
she was named a first-team Ail-
American, and reached the second

team last year.
"I remember a couple of years
ago when this was one of my
goals," McCarthy said. "It's some
thing that no one can take away
from me.
"(The tournament) is closest to
the Olympics in golf in my eyes,"
she said. "It's my biggest achieve
ment so far."
Her teammate, Trish McGonigle,
praised McCarthy for her ac
complishment.
"Kathleen works really, really
hard at it (golf), and I think she
deserves it," McGonigle said. "She
had a rough fall, but she's come
back really strong.
"She hits the ball really hard and
long; she's a very intimidating
player," McGonigle added. "She
really is an awesome putter. She
displays a lot of confidence on the
course."
McGonigle also was confident
about her teammate's prospects on
the professional circuit, which
McCarthy is planning to join in the
fall of 1987.
"Right now, what it takes on the
tour is the mental edge,"
McGonigle said, "and I think Kath
leen does have it."
As for the Curtis Cup this year,
the 36-hole tournament will be
played Aug. 1-2 at the Prairie
Pines Country Club in Hutchinson,
Kan.
"We'll all probably get to the site
a few days early," McCarthy said.
"I've never been to Kansas, but if
the USGA picks (the course), it's
gotta be a good one.
"The United States won last
year," she said, "(but) the British
players are good."
McCarthy will be joined on the
team by Arizona State's Danielle
Ammaccapane, Mississippi State's
Kim Williams, Florida's Leslie
Shannon, Furman's Dotti Pepper,
North Carolina's Candy Kessler,
Tulsa's Kim Gardner and Georgia's
Cindy Scheyer.
