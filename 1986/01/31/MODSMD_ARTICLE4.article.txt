# Police put DUs on hold

### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
Stanford police shut down a party at the Delta Upsilon
fraternity early yesterday morning after tracing a phone
call jamming the 911 emergency number to the DU
house.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Marvin Moore, a
call "tying up a police emergency line" originated from a
phone located in the DU house. He said that after 911
was dialed, the phone was apparently taken off the hook.
"We got there (at the DU house) at about 1:05 a.m.
and decided to close the party up because it had gone a
little too far," he said.
Moore, who said the incident demonstrated a "total
lack of any sense of responsibility," noted that no arrests
h;tve been made because police have been unable to de

termine exactly who was responsible for placing the call.
Diana Conklin, assistant dean of Student Affairs and
Row Office director, said the action "shows an attitude
that I find disturbing in the extreme." She said she plans
to meet with fraternal affairs adviser Joe Pisano today to
discuss the incident
Pisano was unavailable for comment yesterday.
Sophomore David Supple, a Delta Upsilon resident
who answered the bouse phone yesterday, said, "It's un
fortunate that the incident happened."
Noting that a phone is "right in the middle of the party
area in the house," Supple said, "There is no proof that it
was someone (Hung) in the house and I don't think
anyone in the house would do something like that."
The incident is to be investigated further by the Row
Office and the Fraternal Affairs Office.
