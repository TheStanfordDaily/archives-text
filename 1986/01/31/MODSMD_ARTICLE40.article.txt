## 
### PETER CASTILLO Staff writer 
Be prepared to see some real wrestling action, not Hulk
Hogan, as the Cardinal returns to the Farm to host Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo tomorrow at 7 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion for a rare home meet.
Stanford has never beaten Cal Poly and will be the defi
nite underdog again tomorrow night, as Neil Wartnik
(126 pounds) and Jeff Bradley (134 pounds) are out of
the lineup with jammed necks. Filling in for the Cardinal
will be Stephen Bishko at 126 pounds and Sam Sunshine
at 134 pounds.
At the Southern California Duals on Jan. 19, Stanford
captured fifth, while Cal Poly took fourth.
"Cal Poly would have an advantage, even if we were
healthy, but we would have been competitive if those two
were not injured," Coach Chris Horpel said. "The team
attitude is good and if we get pumped, we can make it
competitive."
Horpel said that because it is very hard to diagnose
Wartnik and Bradley's type of injury and the only
treatment is rest, he does not know when they might
return to the lineup. The two are running and lifting

weights, but are unable to practice.
"It is hard to say, but at this point Bradley chances for
coming back for the Pac-10 Championships are good.
Also, he needed a break for physical and mental reasons,"
Horpel said. "Neil is having to deal with a new injury and
he is really concerned. I am not sure if he'll return, but 1
am hopeful.
"Rust could be a big problem, for there is only one
thing that prepares you to wrestle and that is wrestling.
Neil needs the time on the mat. Bradley might be able to
handle the time off."
The feature match of the evening will be at 177 pounds,
as Stanford's Dave Lee faces Mark Tracy. Tracy won All-
American honors last year at 190 pounds and is ranked
among the best in the nation. Cal Poly Coach Lennis
Cowell said that Tracy moved up a weight last year to help
the team and that he is much stronger at 177 pounds.
An interesting match will be at heavyweight, as the
Cardinal's Kurt Kassulke wrestles Ben Lizama. kassulke
will be giving up more than 50 pounds to Lizama, who
weighs about 250 pounds. To compensate for the differ
ence, Horpel has been going over "big guy" techniques
with Kassulke.
