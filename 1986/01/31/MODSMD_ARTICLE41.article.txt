### AMY FRANCETIC Staff writer 
The Stanford men's swim team
begins its Pacific 10 Conference dual
season today as it hosts the Arizona
State Sun Devils in DeGuerre Pool at
2 p.m.
Enthusiastic about getting his up
perclassmen into the racing mode,
Coach Skip Kenney said, "We're
looking forward to the competition.
Their strengths and weaknesses
match ours, so it should be a good
workout."
Senior co-captain Mike Reynolds
said, "ASU will give us the opportu

nity to fine tune our skills in each of
our events. A number of upperclass
men haven't raced since November."
Arizona State has the potential to
dole out some quick races. Benny
Neilson, from Sweden, is ranked third
globally in the 200 butterfly, and
Scott Brackett promises to heat up
the distance freestyle events. Last
year at Arizona, Brackett beat Stan
ford's Jeff Kostoff in the 1,000
freestyle.
"They're pretty good mid-season
swimmers," Reynolds said.
With a meet record in the 200 but
terfly last weekend in Dallas, sopho

more Anthony Mosse has shown he is
swimming some of his best times
ever. "I've trained hard, and I'm
more mentally keen this year," Mosse
said. "But, ASU may be unpredicta
ble."
Both the men's and women's swim
teams will be competing in the same
pool today, and Kenney said, "We're
hoping for some nice weather and a
good crowd."
Card notes
The Stanford relays, scheduled for
Sunday, have been canceled.
