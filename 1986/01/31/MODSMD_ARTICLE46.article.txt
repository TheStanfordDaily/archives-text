# Gymnasts host powerful ASU
## 
### TRACY POTTER 
It takes more than talented individ
uals to make up a winning team ... it
takes spirit.
The Stanford women's gymnastics
team is going into its first home meet
of the season at Maples Pavilion
tonight at 7:30 with lots of both.
Successful recruiting by Stanford
Coach Homer Sardina the last few
years has brought some gifted gym
nasts to the Stanford squad, including
sophomore Beth Pope, one of the na
tion's top performers, and freshman
Jinny Rhee, a top recuit for this year.
Pope, who suffered an unfortunate
knee injury in last week's meet
against UCLA, is due to undergo sur
gery today. "It's a blow, she's one of
our finest gymnasts. You don't
replace gymnasts like that over

night," Sardina said.
It is still unclear whether Pope will
be out for the season.
Freshman Rhee, also nursing an
ankle injury this week, will compete
tonight, and is a strong contender for
an all-around victory. Other Stanford
all-around contenders include sopho
more Alison McGann, and freshmen
Cheryl Doo and Sheryl Evenson.
Talent isn't the Cardinal's only as
set. The young team has "a certain
chemistry ... it's hard to put into
words. Team pride — they have it,"
Sardina said.
Such energy will be useful tonight
against third-ranked Arizona State.
Particularly strong ASU gymnasts to
watch include Lisa Zeist, the 1985
NCAA champion on the balance
beam, and Jackie Brummer, 1984
NCAA uneven bars winner.

Stanford can't afford an uneven performance from Alison McGann if it
expects to beat Arizona State, which boasts two past NCAA individual
champions.

uals to make up a winning team ... it
