### 
Jono Tunney and Chuck Gil
lingham, two highly-sought foot
ball players from Bellarmine Prep,
have undoubtedly put a smile on
Stanford Coach Jack Elway's face
by verbally committing to Stan
ford.
Gillingham was only able to
play one game last season due to
a foot injury but was named a
first-team All-Peninsula tight end
his junior year.
The 6-foot-4, 240-pound Gil
lingham is expected to play defen
sive end for the Cardinal and is
also a standout in the classroom
with a 3.5 grade point average.
Gillingham, who also visited
USC, Navy and UCLA, said
"I didn't have the schools ranked
1-2-3-4, but when Stanford told
me I was admitted, it felt really
good. So I said yes."

The decision to attend Stanford
was an easy one for Tunney also.
"1 pretty much knew I was going
to Stanford from the beginning,"
the 6-2, 220-pounder from Mill
Valley said. "My dad went there,
and I've been going to games there
all my life. And I have a little
brother, so I want to stay close to
home."
Tunney was named a first-team
All-Peninsula linebacker two
years in a row and will help offset
the loss of graduating inside
linebackers Jack Gilmete and
Matt Soderlund.
Both players are expected to put
their verbal commitment into
writing on Feb. 12, the first day
national letters of intent can be
signed.
