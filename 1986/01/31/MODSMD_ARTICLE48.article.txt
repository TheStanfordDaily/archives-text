Libya withdraws sanction demands
TUNIS, Tunisia — Strong Arab resistance, especially that of Saudi
Arabia, forced Libya to withdraw demands for economic sanctions
against the United States at a special meeting of Arab League foreign
ministers here last night, according to conference sources.
The Libyan government of Col. Moammar Khadafy had called the
meeting to seek a concerted Arab plan to hit back at the United States
for its economic sanctions and military threats against Libya in the wake
of terrorist attacks Dec. 27 at the Rome and Vienna airports.
Saudi Arabia reportedly refused to send its minister until Libya
backed down on its demands. According to a senior Western diplomat
with close ties to Arab leaders, the Saudis softened the pill for Libya by
promising to make up for any Libyan economic losses caused by the U.S.
actions as a gesture of Arab solidarity. Any such losses are expected to
be minimal.
President Reagan earlier this month ordered an economic boycott of
Libya and U.S. naval maneuvers off its shores on the basis that Khadafy
had supported Palestinians who conducted the attacks. Most of Libya's
trading partners have applied only limited sanctions.
Libyan Foreign Minister Ali Treiki presented his proposals to counter
U.S. actions at a press conference before the Arab League meeting.
Among the measures he said he would propose to the conference were
for Arab governments to pull their money out of U.S. banks, reduction
of Arab imports from the United States and a boycott of American
airlines, shipping firms or oil companies that are complying with
Reagan's boycott of Libya.
But moments after the conference opened, with a strong denunciation
of U.S. policy by Arab League Secretary General Chadli Klibi, Treiki
withdrew his proposals and asked the conference to decide for itself
what measures might be taken, according to Arab sources.
War blamed on party infighting
MOSCOW — A South Yemeni diplomat here said yesterday that the
brief but destructive civil war in his home country was prompted by dif
ferences over policies in the ruling Socialist Party, the economy and the
exercise of authority, rather than intertribal or foreign policy differences
as recent reports have suggested.
Charge d'affaires Saif Saal Khlid said the country's acting president,
Haidar abu Bakr Attas would keep ousted strongman Ali Nasser
Hasani's policy of improving relations with other Arab states.
Earlier reports had suggested that Hasani, himself a Marxist, had
stirred up opposition from harder-line Marxists by seeking to improve
relations with conservative and pro-Western Arab states such as Saudi
Arabia.
At a news conference, the Yemeni spokesman also contradicted some
western press reports that the clash had revolved around intertribal con
flicts.
Saif Saal insisted that fewer than 10,000 persons were killed in the
two-week street fighting but he provided no estimate of casualties. A
detailed report on casualties will be released later, he said. In Aden,
South Yemen's capital, observers had estimated the death toll at 12,000.
Marcos expands election board
MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos yesterday
named two additional members of the government's commission on
elections, fulfilling a long-delayed pledge just eight days before the pres
idential elections.
"I understand that some of my friends at the U.S. Embassy said that I
have not complied with my promise.. .." Marcos said in announcing his
choices at the conclusion of a speech here. Earlier in the week, U.S. Am
bassador Stephen Bosworth cited the delayed appointments among
areas "in which action has fallen short of what many consider desirable."
The appointees are Jaime Layosa, who has been executive director of
the commission, and Ruben Agpalo, a lawyer in private practice. The
appointments brought the commission to a full membership of nine, the
majority of whom are still considered Marcos supporters. The commis
sion controls the procedures for the Feb. 7 presidential elections in
which Marcos, opposed by Corazon Aquino, is seeking re-election.
Also yesterday, Marcos counterattacked critics in the United States,
accusing them of fabricating evidence against him about his "hidden
wealth" abroad and warning that lawsuits could be filed against his
detractors.
Marcos blamed his current difficulties with Washington on "some
bureaucrats and some members of Congress." He said President Reagan
had been misinformed about the situation in the Philippines by intelli
gence reports.
The Philippine leader also dismissed charges by political opponents
that his ruling party is preparing to cheat massively in a Feb. 7 presiden
tial election. He said the allegations reflected the opposition's
"anticipation of a political debacle," and he predicted a landslide vic
tory.
Ugandan leader names cabinet
KAMPALA, Uganda — Uganda's new president, Yoweri Museveni,
made his first Cabinet appointments yesterday and said that he would
retain the key defense minister's job until order had been restored in the
war-torn East African country.
Samson Kisekka, a 73-year old doctor and one of Museveni's close
friends, was named as prime minister. Kisekka had worked in Nairobi,
Kenya, as external coordinator and spokesman of the National Resis
tance Army which overthrew the six-month old military council here
Saturday.
Professor Pontiano Mulema is the new minister of finance. He was a
member of the opposition Democratic Party under the government of
President Milton Obote, who was overthrown by the military council in
July last year.
A statement from the presidential office said that 83 ministers would
be sworn in once the entire Cabinet had been named.
Museveni has already announced plans for a broad-based government
and Western-style parliamentary democracy. He said that he would try
to rebuild the country's shattered economy using elements of both
capitalism and socialism.
Americans reluctantly leave Libya
TRIPOLI, Libya — Many remaining Americans reluctantly left Libya
yesterday — 24 hours ahead of President Reagan's deadline — as the
U.S. 6th Fleet wound up week-long exercises near the disputed Gulf of
Sidra.
Perhaps 100 American oilmen — ranging from field hands to execu
tives — and a few wives boarded a variety of Europe-bound flights.
Especially galling to several departing American oilmen was the
knowledge that their well-paid jobs here were being taken by British or
Canadian counterparts, leaving them unemployed in a contracting U.S.
and world oil market.
"I'm hauling bottonl out of here and going to Dallas," said a 60-year
old driller, "where I guess I get to go on the dole."
He and a colleague from Oklahoma, on a flight bound for nearby
Malta, declined to give their names.
Other oil workers suggested that some of those requesting anonymity
in talking to newsmen were doing so to avoid alerting U.S. authorities if
they did return here.
The U.S. oil workers' departure, if definitive, was viewed by Western
diplomats as more likely to harm Col. Moammar Khadafy's regime than
the threat — or even use — of military force.

"I'm hauling bottonl out of here and going to Dallas," said a 60-year
old driller, "where I guess I get to go on the dole."
He and a colleague from Oklahoma, on a flight bound for nearby
Malta, declined to give their names.
Other oil workers suggested that some of those requesting anonymity
in talking to newsmen were doing so to avoid alerting U.S. authorities if
they did return here.
The U.S. oil workers' departure, if definitive, was viewed by Western
diplomats as more likely to harm Col. Moammar Khadafy's regime than
the threat — or even use — of military force.
Libya withdraws sanction demands
TUNIS, Tunisia — Strong Arab resistance, especially that of Saudi
Arabia, forced Libya to withdraw demands for economic sanctions
against the United States at a special meeting of Arab League foreign
ministers here last night, according to conference sources.
The Libyan government of Col. Moammar Khadafy had called the
meeting to seek a concerted Arab plan to hit back at the United States
for its economic sanctions and military threats against Libya in the wake
of terrorist attacks Dec. 27 at the Rome and Vienna airports.
Saudi Arabia reportedly refused to send its minister until Libya
backed down on its demands. According to a senior Western diplomat
with close ties to Arab leaders, the Saudis softened the pill for Libya by
promising to make up for any Libyan economic losses caused by the U.S.
actions as a gesture of Arab solidarity. Any such losses are expected to
be minimal.
President Reagan earlier this month ordered an economic boycott of
Libya and U.S. naval maneuvers off its shores on the basis that Khadafy
had supported Palestinians who conducted the attacks. Most of Libya's
trading partners have applied only limited sanctions.
Libyan Foreign Minister Ali Treiki presented his proposals to counter
U.S. actions at a press conference before the Arab League meeting.
Among the measures he said he would propose to the conference were
for Arab governments to pull their money out of U.S. banks, reduction
of Arab imports from the United States and a boycott of American
airlines, shipping firms or oil companies that are complying with
Reagan's boycott of Libya.
But moments after the conference opened, with a strong denunciation
of U.S. policy by Arab League Secretary General Chadli Klibi, Treiki
withdrew his proposals and asked the conference to decide for itself
what measures might be taken, according to Arab sources.
War blamed on party infighting
MOSCOW — A South Yemeni diplomat here said yesterday that the
brief but destructive civil war in his home country was prompted by dif
ferences over policies in the ruling Socialist Party, the economy and the
exercise of authority, rather than intertribal or foreign policy differences
as recent reports have suggested.
Charge d'affaires Saif Saal Khlid said the country's acting president,
Haidar abu Bakr Attas would keep ousted strongman Ali Nasser
Hasani's policy of improving relations with other Arab states.
Earlier reports had suggested that Hasani, himself a Marxist, had
stirred up opposition from harder-line Marxists by seeking to improve
relations with conservative and pro-Western Arab states such as Saudi
Arabia.
At a news conference, the Yemeni spokesman also contradicted some
western press reports that the clash had revolved around intertribal con
flicts.
Saif Saal insisted that fewer than 10,000 persons were killed in the
two-week street fighting but he provided no estimate of casualties. A
detailed report on casualties will be released later, he said. In Aden,
South Yemen's capital, observers had estimated the death toll at 12,000.
Marcos expands election board
MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos yesterday
named two additional members of the government's commission on
elections, fulfilling a long-delayed pledge just eight days before the pres
idential elections.
"I understand that some of my friends at the U.S. Embassy said that I
have not complied with my promise.. .." Marcos said in announcing his
choices at the conclusion of a speech here. Earlier in the week, U.S. Am
bassador Stephen Bosworth cited the delayed appointments among
areas "in which action has fallen short of what many consider desirable."
The appointees are Jaime Layosa, who has been executive director of
the commission, and Ruben Agpalo, a lawyer in private practice. The
appointments brought the commission to a full membership of nine, the
majority of whom are still considered Marcos supporters. The commis
sion controls the procedures for the Feb. 7 presidential elections in
which Marcos, opposed by Corazon Aquino, is seeking re-election.
Also yesterday, Marcos counterattacked critics in the United States,
accusing them of fabricating evidence against him about his "hidden
wealth" abroad and warning that lawsuits could be filed against his
detractors.
Marcos blamed his current difficulties with Washington on "some
bureaucrats and some members of Congress." He said President Reagan
had been misinformed about the situation in the Philippines by intelli
gence reports.
The Philippine leader also dismissed charges by political opponents
that his ruling party is preparing to cheat massively in a Feb. 7 presiden
tial election. He said the allegations reflected the opposition's
"anticipation of a political debacle," and he predicted a landslide vic
tory.
Ugandan leader names cabinet
KAMPALA, Uganda — Uganda's new president, Yoweri Museveni,
made his first Cabinet appointments yesterday and said that he would
retain the key defense minister's job until order had been restored in the
war-torn East African country.
Samson Kisekka, a 73-year old doctor and one of Museveni's close
friends, was named as prime minister. Kisekka had worked in Nairobi,
Kenya, as external coordinator and spokesman of the National Resis
tance Army which overthrew the six-month old military council here
Saturday.
Professor Pontiano Mulema is the new minister of finance. He was a
member of the opposition Democratic Party under the government of
President Milton Obote, who was overthrown by the military council in
July last year.
A statement from the presidential office said that 83 ministers would
be sworn in once the entire Cabinet had been named.
Museveni has already announced plans for a broad-based government
and Western-style parliamentary democracy. He said that he would try
to rebuild the country's shattered economy using elements of both
capitalism and socialism.
Americans reluctantly leave Libya
TRIPOLI, Libya — Many remaining Americans reluctantly left Libya
yesterday — 24 hours ahead of President Reagan's deadline — as the
U.S. 6th Fleet wound up week-long exercises near the disputed Gulf of
Sidra.
Perhaps 100 American oilmen — ranging from field hands to execu
tives — and a few wives boarded a variety of Europe-bound flights.
Especially galling to several departing American oilmen was the
knowledge that their well-paid jobs here were being taken by British or
Canadian counterparts, leaving them unemployed in a contracting U.S.
and world oil market.
"I'm hauling bottonl out of here and going to Dallas," said a 60-year
old driller, "where I guess I get to go on the dole."
He and a colleague from Oklahoma, on a flight bound for nearby
Malta, declined to give their names.
