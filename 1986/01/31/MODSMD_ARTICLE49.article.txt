# Part of shuttle fuselage recovered

### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — Coast Guard
search teams yesterday recovered a large chunk of
the fuselage of the space shuttle Challenger and re
ported spotting thousands of other pieces of the
wreckage at sea, including what the Coast Guard
believed was part of the craft's cockpit.
The segment of the fuselage, the central body
section of the shuttle, was the most significant dis
covery in the intensive search operation that was
launched immediately after the Challenger ex
ploded 74 seconds into its flight late Tuesday
morning.
The fuselage section was hauled aboard the
Coast Guard cutter Dallas and was expected to be
unloaded near Cape Canaveral late last night.
"They said it took everything they had to get it up
there on the cutter, so it must be fairly large," a
spokesman said of the section.
The Dallas also reported that sonar sweeps have
detected a "large object or objects" lying on the
ocean floor beneath where the floating fragment of
the fuselage was located, according to Coast Guard
Lt. Cindr. Jim Simpson.
Simpson said the Dallas had requested Navy
divers to descend to the site to investigate. Mean

while, other ships that can pull large objects from
the sea are being sent to help the Dallas retrieve
the floating debris.
The Dallas made the reports by radio from out in
the Atlantic, where the search operation is cen
tered. Investigators for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration cautioned that until they
could see the wreckage, especially what was des
cribed as being part of the cockpit, they could not
confirm precisely what had been found.
NASA officials also confirmed that a 6-by-4-
inch bone and tissue fragment, with a piece of
fabric attached to it, had washed ashore about 30
miles south of the cape yesterday. But they said
there was no way to determine immediately
whether it had come from one of the bodies of the
seven Challenger crew members who were killed in
the explosion.
In Houston, NASA officials spent the day pre
paring for today's memorial service for the seven
crew members. President Reagan and his wife,
Nancy, will attend the half-hour service, along with
a contingent of at least 24 senators and 55 House
members.
Reagan, speaking before the Conservative Politi

cal Action Conference last night in Washington,
D.C., said of the shuttle crew: "We know now that
God holds them close; and we pray He will comfort
their grieving loved ones. And we are aware too of
our own duty — to them and to their memory. We
must continue."
The National Transportaion Safety Board
(NTSB) sent two of its top investigators to Cape
Cavaveral yesterday to aid NASA in its probe of
Tuesday's disaster. All pieces of the Challenger
that are recovered are being brought to a central
location and impounded for use in the investigation
that is under way.
Yesterday's sightings were the first reports that
anything substantial might have remained intact
after the massive explosion that destroyed the
Challenger and brought the nation's costly and am
bitious manned space program to a halt. Until
yesterday, search crews had reported finding only
much smaller fragments from the shuttle.
The recovery of any part of the cockpit intact
might aid efforts to unravel the final, fatal seconds
of the 74-second Challenger flight. However,
NASA officials cautioned that there is no cockpit
instrument that would have survived intact.
