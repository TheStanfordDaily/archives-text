# Constitution turned down
## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
Voters in this week's ASSU special elections narrowly defeated a proposal
for a new student body constitution and advised the ASSU to divest its funds
from the University's investment pool, the elections commissioner announced
yesterday.
A proposal to have students set the association fee in an election each year
was also defeated, while voters approved a modification in the Nominations
Committee members' term of office.
The proposed constitution, which was endorsed by 62.2 percent of the
voters, fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass. Out of 1,737 votes
cast, 1,080 went in favor of the new constitution, with 657 opposed.
Council of Presidents (COP) member Tim Ouirk, who helped write the pro
posed constitution, said he was "stunned" at the constitution's defeat.
"I had no idea anyone would react so negatively to the constitution," he
said.
The proposed constitution would have changed the ASSU Senate from a
single legislative branch of 20 voting and 20 non-voting members to a
legislature composed of two boards, each with nine voting members and one
chair. Also, the number of COP members would have decreased from four to
three.
Quirk said that despite the defeat, the election results indicate "the majority
of the students don't want the senate to stay the way it is."
COP member Mike Collins, who also co-authored the new constitution, said
the percentage of votes in favor shows "a healthy vote of confidence."
"It's a damned shame there was no two-thirds vote, but it's satisfying that so
many students want the present constitution to change," Collins said.
Collins said the constitution's defeat is "a demonstration of how deadly last
minute criticism can be." He referred to a meeting on Monday in which mem
bers of campus minority-interest groups drafted an informal statement oppos
ing the new constitution on the grounds that it would discriminate against
minority groups.
In the statement, which was published in Tuesday's Daily, the students
claimed that the new consitution would restrict access by minority-interest
groups to the ASSU appeals system. They also said the writers of the constitu
tion did not consult minority groups as to the content of the proposal.
Black Student Union Chair Steve Phillips said last night that "certain
measures in the proposed constitution, including the decrease in COP mem
bers, effectively locked out a portion of the community." Phillips added that
election results indicated a "sentiment for change," but that in order to create
an acceptable alternative, writers of the constitution should "find a way to
eliminate the more undemocratic aspects of the proposed constitution."
Collins said, "The complaints levied against the constitution were unfair, but
they were very excellently timed to crush the constitution."
When asked if he plans to reformulate a new constitution, Collins said, "1
don't know. Maybe something in the spring, but I really couldn't say at this
point."
COP member Andy Frisch said that "the biggest mistake we could make
would be to keep the constitution the way it is." Both he and Ouirk expressed
hope that efforts at revising the current constitution will continue/
In reference to the divestment referendum, which was approved by 63.1
percent of the votes cast, Quirk said,
"I can't believe that 665 people voted
against divestment." He said the wor
ding of the referendum probably
caused the high number of anti
divestment votes.
On the ballot, students opposed to
divestment had to vote "yes," while
students supporting divestment voted
"no."
Quirk said he believes "people
want divestment more than this elec
tion shows. It still sends a message to
the University, because we're going

to get divestment."
Eric Diesel, treasurer of the Coali
tion Against Apartheid and member
of Stanford Out of South Africa, con
curred, saying "divestment would
have passed by more if the wording
on the ballot hadn't been so confus
ing."
Collins explained that the result of
the voters' advice for divestment will
be the formation of a senate commit
tee to study what can be done with
the money now being held in the Uni
versity investment pool. In the spring
elections students will decide if the
ASSU should divest from the Univer
sity pool, he said.
Commenting on the defeat of the
proposal to have the student body set

the association fee in spring elections
each year, Collins said, "I can't say
I'm disappointed."
According to Frisch, students set
ting the fee would have been success
ful with the new constitution, "but
under the old system, it could have
destroyed some student groups."
Frisch referred to the problem
pointed out by Diesel in his statement
against the amendment, which was
published in the ASSU Election
Handbook.
Diesel wrote that the amendment
"would have students vote on funding
for student groups without knowing
which groups and which programs
would be wiped out until after it is too
late."

tion Against Apartheid and member
of Stanford Out of South Africa, con
curred, saying "divestment would
have passed by more if the wording
on the ballot hadn't been so confus
ing."
Collins explained that the result of
the voters' advice for divestment will
be the formation of a senate commit
tee to study what can be done with
the money now being held in the Uni
versity investment pool. In the spring
elections students will decide if the
ASSU should divest from the Univer
sity pool, he said.
Commenting on the defeat of the
proposal to have the student body set

the association fee in spring elections
each year, Collins said, "I can't say
I'm disappointed."
According to Frisch, students set
ting the fee would have been success
ful with the new constitution, "but
under the old system, it could have
destroyed some student groups."
Frisch referred to the problem
pointed out by Diesel in his statement
against the amendment, which was
published in the ASSU Election
Handbook.
Diesel wrote that the amendment
"would have students vote on funding
for student groups without knowing
which groups and which programs
would be wiped out until after it is too
late."
Voters in this week's ASSU special elections narrowly defeated a proposal
for a new student body constitution and advised the ASSU to divest its funds
from the University's investment pool, the elections commissioner announced
yesterday.
A proposal to have students set the association fee in an election each year
was also defeated, while voters approved a modification in the Nominations
Committee members' term of office.
The proposed constitution, which was endorsed by 62.2 percent of the
voters, fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass. Out of 1,737 votes
cast, 1,080 went in favor of the new constitution, with 657 opposed.
Council of Presidents (COP) member Tim Ouirk, who helped write the pro
posed constitution, said he was "stunned" at the constitution's defeat.
"I had no idea anyone would react so negatively to the constitution," he
said.
The proposed constitution would have changed the ASSU Senate from a
single legislative branch of 20 voting and 20 non-voting members to a
legislature composed of two boards, each with nine voting members and one
chair. Also, the number of COP members would have decreased from four to
three.
Quirk said that despite the defeat, the election results indicate "the majority
of the students don't want the senate to stay the way it is."
COP member Mike Collins, who also co-authored the new constitution, said
the percentage of votes in favor shows "a healthy vote of confidence."
"It's a damned shame there was no two-thirds vote, but it's satisfying that so
many students want the present constitution to change," Collins said.
Collins said the constitution's defeat is "a demonstration of how deadly last
minute criticism can be." He referred to a meeting on Monday in which mem
bers of campus minority-interest groups drafted an informal statement oppos
ing the new constitution on the grounds that it would discriminate against
minority groups.
In the statement, which was published in Tuesday's Daily, the students
claimed that the new consitution would restrict access by minority-interest
groups to the ASSU appeals system. They also said the writers of the constitu
tion did not consult minority groups as to the content of the proposal.
Black Student Union Chair Steve Phillips said last night that "certain
measures in the proposed constitution, including the decrease in COP mem
bers, effectively locked out a portion of the community." Phillips added that
election results indicated a "sentiment for change," but that in order to create
an acceptable alternative, writers of the constitution should "find a way to
eliminate the more undemocratic aspects of the proposed constitution."
Collins said, "The complaints levied against the constitution were unfair, but
they were very excellently timed to crush the constitution."
When asked if he plans to reformulate a new constitution, Collins said, "1
don't know. Maybe something in the spring, but I really couldn't say at this
point."
COP member Andy Frisch said that "the biggest mistake we could make
would be to keep the constitution the way it is." Both he and Ouirk expressed
hope that efforts at revising the current constitution will continue/
In reference to the divestment referendum, which was approved by 63.1
percent of the votes cast, Quirk said,
"I can't believe that 665 people voted
against divestment." He said the wor
ding of the referendum probably
caused the high number of anti
divestment votes.
On the ballot, students opposed to
divestment had to vote "yes," while
students supporting divestment voted
"no."
Quirk said he believes "people
want divestment more than this elec
tion shows. It still sends a message to
the University, because we're going

to get divestment."
