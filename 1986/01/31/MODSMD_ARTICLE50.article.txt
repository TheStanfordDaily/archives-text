# Trade deficit last year was record high
## Democrats intend to make imports and exports an issue in mid-term races 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The United
States suffered the highest interna
tional trade deficit in its history last
year as the difference between what
Americans sold overseas and the
foreign goods they bought soared to a
record $148.5 billion, the Commerce
Department announced yesterday.
The massive trade deficit marks a
dramatic turnabout in U.S. interna
tional competitiveness over the past
decade. Until 1977, the United States
never ran a trade deficit that
exceeded $10 billion.
The new trade deficit, which is
$25.2 billion greater than the 1984
record of $123.3 billion, is expected
to intensify congressional pressure for
tougher trade laws to limit imports
and increase overseas sales of U.S.
goods.
Congressional Democrats yester
day signaled their intention to try to
make the trade deficit an issue in this
year's miH-tprm rnrr>c Thp Demo

cratic Leadership Council unveiled a
new trade bill sponsored by Sen.
Lawton Chiles (D-Fla.) and Rep.
Daniel Mica (D-Fla.) and supported
by such possible Democratic presi
dential contenders as former Virginia
governor Charles Robb. The bill
would toughen laws against unfair
trade practices.
And in a mailgram advising Demo
crats that GOP candidates are vulner
able on trade. Rep. Tony Coelho (D-
Calif.) chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee,
said, "This is a key jobs and pro-
America issue for the Democrats in
1986."
Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) called
the deficit "a national disgrace,"
while Rep. Don Bonker (D-Wash.)
said the figures show that President
Reagan's trade initiatives "do not
make a serious effort to address our
spiraling trade problems."

Meanwhile, the Reagan Adminis
tration released a favorable economic
report yesterday showing that the in
dex of leading indicators rose 0.9 per
cent in December, the strongest gain
in four months. Higher stock prices,
an increase in building permits and a
longer factory workweek were cited
by the Commerce Department for the
gain in the index, which often fores
hadows changes in overall economic
activity.
The December trade deficit of
$17.4 billion dashed optimistic
predictions by some economists of a
turnaround because of the recent fall
in the dollar. Not only was the
December deficit the highest of the
year, but it was $5.4 billion greater
than the $12 billion average for the
first 11 months.
In the only direct Administration
comment on the trade deficit. White
House spokesman Larry Speakes

predicted the gap would start to nar
row "no later than the second half of
this year".
"We continue to believe that the
combined effect of the declining dol
lar, coupled with stronger growth
prospects overseas, should begin to
show a reduction," Speakes contin
ued.
But Jerry Jasinowski, executive
vice president and chief economist of
the National Association of Manufac
turers, said the December trade defi
cit shows "the decline in the dollar
has had no impact yet. . . . We won't
see any meaningful trade improve
ment until late this year."
The high dollar is blamed by most
economists for causing the surging
trade deficit by raising the cost of
U.S. products so they become un
competitive overseas while making
imports more attractive to Americans
by lowering their prices.
