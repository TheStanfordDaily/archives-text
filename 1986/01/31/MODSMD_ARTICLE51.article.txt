Cuts to cause disruption
WASHINGTON — The first round of
Gramm-Rudman spending cuts, which will throw
a $1 billion punch at the massive Health and
Human Services Department, appear likely to
force sharper program disruptions than White
House budget officials have forecast.
"This will be very painful," William Lukhard,
commissioner of the Virginia Social Services De
partment, said of a coming $6.5 million cutback
in HHS funds for a wide range of social services
in his state.
Less day care for children of th ■ working poor,
fewer investigations of adult and child abuse,
reduced foster child services — those are the
prospects that Virginia and other states face
beginning March 1, when 4.3 percent across-the
board cuts in federal domestic programs become
effective.
"Four years ago, we took a 22 percent cut,"
Lukhard noted. "The fat is out of it. We're down
to the bone."
He has a lot of company. Although Social Se
curity benefits are exempt from cuts, officials
predict less daring research on Alzheimer's and
other diseases, smaller fuel-bill subsidies for the
poor, fewer vaccinations for children, slower test
ing of new food and drug products and shorter
hospital stays for Medicare patients.
And federal officials, who have spent a confus
ing month determining how to implement the
first round of cuts mandated by the new Gramm-
Rudman budget-balancing law, say the second
round in the fall could be several times worse be

cause the projected deficit for fiscal 1987, which
begins ori Oct. 1, is about $50 billion greater than
the Gramm-Rudman ceiling.
Kissinger Eyes Race
NEW YORK — Former Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger announced yesterday that he is
considering running for governor of New York
State, raising the possibility that Gov. Mario
Cuomo, a potential 1988 Democratic presiden
tial contender, could face a real re-election chal
lenge in November.
"Republican leaders have urged me to run for
governor," Kissinger said in a statement issued
by the New York office of his consulting firm. "I
had not previously considered standing for
elective office, but I am complimented by their
request and I feel I owe them a consideration of
their views. 1 '
Kissinger met last week with Republican
strategists associated with two of his former men
tors — Former President Richard Nixon and the
late Gov. Nelson Rockefeller. Republicans have
been openly scrambling to find a candidate to
oppose Cuomo — who has already raised $9 mil
lion for his campaign and who has more than a 70
percent approval rating in the polls.
But, strategists familiar with Kissinger's think
ing said that it appeared very unlikely to them
that he would enter the race. One called it
"nothing more than a flirtation."
Nevertheless, some Republicans were elated
by the announcement. "I believe Henry Kis

singer would be a formidable candidate and one
who could win," said State Senate Majority
Leader Warren Anderson.
$4.3 Billion for SDI
WASHINGTON — President Reagan's pro
posed $311 billion defense budget for fiscal 1987
will include a $4.3 billion request for develop
ment of the "Star Wars" space defense program,
an increase of more than 50 percent over the cur
rent fiscal year, congressional sources said yester
day.
The "Star Wars" request likely will be one of
the most controversial items in a defense pro
posal that also is expected to include a 100 per
cent increase in the development of the small,
single-warhead Midgetman missile, funding for
21 additional MX missiles and resumption of
anti-satellite (ASAT) missile tests.
Market Closes Mixed
NEW YORK — The stock market was mixed
yesterday in the face of some selling that ended a
five-session winning streak for the Dow Jones in
dustrial average.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
more than 5 points in early trading, was off 6.76
at 1,552.18 by the close. The average's record
closing peak of 1,565.71 was reached on Jan. 7.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
slowed to 125.34 million shares from Wednes
