Eastwood for mayor
CARMEL — Actor Clint Eastwood is aban
doning his Dirty Harry and Bronco Billy roles to
take a stab at the part of small-town mayor.
Eastwood, 55, filed papers yesterday to run for
mayor of Carmel, a picturesque city on the Mon
terey Peninsula that Eastwood has called home
for 14 years.
"Our village faces some fundamental problems
which are not being solved by our current mayor
and city council,' Eastwood wrote in a candi
date's statement that was part of his filing. He
also submitted a nomination paper signed by 20
Carmel residents.
"I'd like to get away from the negative attitude
of this council regime," the tough-guy actor told
the Monterey Herald at City Hall.
Eastwood said he prefers diplomacy as a
means of solving problems and labeled the cur
rent council and mayor "litigious."
The actor, who has made a career of playing
hard-bitten heroes not afraid to take the law into
their own hands, is among three challengers

facing incumbent mayor Charlotte Townsend.
If he is victorious in the April 8 election,
Eastwood said he would cut back on activities
with his motion picture company, Malpaso Pro
ductions.
Million dollar settlement
SANTA ROSA — A woman who shared the
life of Korbel champagne baron Adolf Heck for
23 years, notwithstanding his ongoing marriage,
will get $3.5 million in the settlement of a
palimony suit filed after his death.
Attorney Marvin Mitchelson, who pioneered
palimony litigation in the widely publicized case
of actor Lee Marvin, represented Veronica Ann
Miramontez in her battle for a bigger share of
Heck's fortune.
He said yesterday he thinks the settlement is
the highest ever in a palimony case: "It's the larg
est one I know of, and I have cases in 28 states."
Mitchelson said both sides were anxious to
avoid a public court battle,"So, it's probably bet-

ter not to have to light it all out.
The family's attorney, George Hoffman, said
the litigation "would have been a very long, com
plicated and personal" fight and would have re
quired the expensive process of tracing owner
ship of assets gathered over 23 years.
The settlement approved this week by Sonoma
County Superior Court Judge Bryan Jamar ends
the $40 million suit filed by the 50-year-old
plaintiff.
Storm hits Southland
LOS ANGELES — A winter storm that hit
Southern California claimed at least five lives in
rain-related accidents, set off a mudslide that
destroyed a home and prompted an evacuation
and sparked scattered power outages yesterday.
The storm that dumped 1.2 inches of rain on
downtown Los Angeles and up to five inches in
the nearby mountains occurred was the first of
three storms forecast for the state in the next few
days.
