# ASSU freezes SOSA allocation for misuse of funding
## 
### MARY K. McDEVITT Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Program Board, which annually
determines the allocation of more than
$100,000 to student organizations, last week
froze the accounts of Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA) and the Stanford Debate Club
pending investigation of misuse of funds.
The board also froze the accounts of 30 other
groups, charging that they did not file financial
forms required under written contracts with the
ASSU.
According to Program Board Director
Eugene Chen, the restrictive measures were
taken to protect the money of students, who are
required to submit approximately $16 quarterly
at registration for student fees.
Chen said the board froze the accounts of
SOSA, a group organized last spring to urge the
University the divest from its holdings in South
African-related companies, because SOSA
spent money on unapproved expenses.
Chen said the board approved SOSA's $900
budget for two speaking events fall quarter. The

group spent a portion of the allocation on the
reimbursement of a member for more than
$100 for black balloons used at Commence
ment last year and $175 for the publication
costs of the journal "Connections," Chen said.
The Stanford Debate Club, whose funds were
also frozen, simply overspent its allocation, he
said. Both groups signed contracts in October
that could require them to return all their allo
cated funds to the board, but a less punitive
settlement will probably be reached within the
next few weeks, Chen said.
The problems with SOSA, the Stanford
Debate Club and the other groups stem in part
from poor understanding of and adherence to
ASSU contracts, difficulties in intra-group com
munication, and questionable financial account
ability, he said.
"It seems like the group (SOSA) is not quite
organized with respect to (its) finances," Chen
said, adding that "they are not alone."
SOSA member Eric Diesel agreed, admitting
that SOSA does not have centralized banking,
and account actions are poorly recorded. "We
have no way of knowing exactly how funds were

spent because there are no records available,"
he said.
Other groups face similar problems. The
ASSU offers a handbook to group treasurers
outlining guidelines for efficient banking, hints
for saving money on common expenses such as
printing and postage and an explanation of the
ASSU funding process, Chen said.
"If a group really wants to know what to fill
out and how to do things, they can find out,"
Chen said.
"We try to help our groups. We ask them to
fulfill certain rules, just as if we were giving
money to a friend," he added.
Chen said knowledge and practical experi
ence limitations are underscored by poor com
munication within groups.
"Unfortunately organizations are not like
people," Chen said. "It's harder to communi
cate. . . . And that has caused lots of problems.
That's what's happening to SOSA, I think," he
said.
Diesel and SOSA Treasurer Rick Motamedi
ascribed similar inadequacies within the Pro
gram Board.

SOSA's accounts were frozen last quarter be
cause of board errors, Motamedi said.
"Basically (the board has) misplaced our
(financial budget) forms . . . about four times
last quarter," he said. "I'm a little skeptical
about (its) reasons (for freezing the accounts)."
Diesel said that a communication void exists
between the Program Board and the student
groups, and that the root of the fund mix-ups
lies in the board.
"This is more of a problem with the ASSU
red tape than something specific to SOSA," he
said.
Chen admitted that "sometimes (the board)
is not the most efficient." But Diesel, who
served on the Program Board last year, "should
know what to do and who to talk to," Chen said.
The student-run board freezes accounts "for
the mutual benefit of students," said Mary
Thurber, ASSU Senate representative to the
board. "Freezing is not an act of hostility,
they're just being concerned about the students'
money. . . . We're all from the same boat," she
said.
