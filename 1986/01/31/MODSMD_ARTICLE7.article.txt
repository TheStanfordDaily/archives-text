# Tutu footage causes Tuesday Films controversy
## 
### STEVE STREED Staff writer 
The director of the Tuesday Films series has
charged the University with seeking to block the
group's efforts to broadcast a tape of last week's
campus speech by South African Bishop Desmond
Tutu, and a University official has responded by
saying Tuesday Films did not follow official proce
dure in its efforts to secure the tape.
The Tuesday Films director, graduate student
Eric Diesel, said the University canceled the fund
raiser because it wanted to thwart Tuesday Films'
intention to fund a proposed ASSU review com
mission aimed at investigating alleged police
brutality during an Oct. 1 1 sit-in protesting Stan
ford's South Africa-related investments.
Tuesday Films had also planned to use proceeds

from the screening to help pay for the defense of
students arrested in the Old Union demonstrations,
Diesel said.
Diesel said Tuesday Films will "probably sue the
University for the loss of funds incurred" from the
canceled showing of Tutu's speech.
Mary Lou Allen, director of the Stanford In
structional Television Network (SITN), which
taped the Tutu address, said the content of the
speech had nothing to do with SITN's not providing
a tape to Tuesday Films.
"Eric Diesel never asked permission to use the
tape. . . . Ironically, we're doing this (taping
campus speeches) for the students. We've worked
with Diesel several years before. . . . We probably
could have made it available.
"But we wouldn't have allowed him to charge"

admission to the screening, Allen said.
To publicize the Tutu screening, Tuesday Films
distributed 10,000 fliers advertising the two video
to-screen viewings, which were to be shown in Ter
man Auditorium on Tuesday, Diesel said. Admis
sion was to be $2 for students and $4 for non
students.
On Monday, Diesel filed a complaint with the
Ombudsperson's Office, saying he had gone
through all the procedures he thought were re
quired to ensure Tuesday Films could use the Tutu
tape at the Terman screening.
Allen said SITN is planning to broadcast the
Tutu speech during spring quarter for SUNeT, a
University educational cable television channel
