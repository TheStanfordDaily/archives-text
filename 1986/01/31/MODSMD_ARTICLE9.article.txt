# Panel discusses Philippine election

"The upcoming Philippine elec
tions have shown that the extent of
dissatisfaction and anger of the
Filipino people is wide and deep,"
said Joel Rocamora of the Philippine
Resource Center at Berkeley.
Rocamora was one of four
speakers who discussed the elections
at a forum sponsored by the Stanford
Filipino Association. He compared
the "media hype" surrounding the
elections to that of the Super Bowl
and suggested that the real meaning
of this election has been ignored.
Joining Rocamora on the panel
were Angel Castro, media affairs offi
cer at the Philippine consulate in San

Francisco; Ruben Mallari, past chair
man of the Ninoy Aquino movement,
an organization backing opposition
candidate Corazon Aquino in the
elections; and Gaston Ortiga, repre
sentative from the movement for the
Free Philippines, another pro-
Aquino group.
Rocamora called the Feb. 7 elec
tion a "public relations" exercise en
gineered by Philippine President Fer
dinand Marcos. "Marcos wishes to
gain a modicum of legitimacy in the
international world," he said.
He said the U.S. government con
tinues to support the Marcos govern
ment "although the U.S. media has
managed to expose Marcos as the
liar, cheat and thief that he is."
Rocamora suggested that the Reagan

Adminstration must not consider it in
its best interest to instigate a change
in leadership in the Philippines at the
current time.
Castro said he believes the two
major problems facing the new ad
ministration are the unhealthy eco
nomy and the growing insurgency in
the Philippines. The healing of these
two problems are central to Marcos'
platform, he said.
Ruben Mallari outlined Aquino's
platform. He said an Aquino govern
ment would dismantle the dictator
ship of Marcos, free the media,
reform the current government ma
chinery and write a new constitution
which would insure basic rights to the
Filipino people, striving to promote
"the freedom, dignity and improve

ment of the quality of life of the
Filipino people."
Ortiga said his group also supports
Aquino but suggested the futility of
her cause by saying, "She is trying to
win an election and remove the dic
tator but has to play by the rules of
this same dictator."
"A direction of change must occur
in the condition of the Filipino
people, from a condition of power
iessness to an improved position in
society," Ortiga said.
Ortiga stressed the significance of
the election rather than the actual
outcome. He said the response and
the enthusiasm of the Filipino people
to this election marks "a significant
step toward making themselves a free
people."
