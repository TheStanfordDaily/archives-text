# New tax bill
## Stanford may lose millions 
### CHRIS PAGE 
Stanford University may be denied
between $5 and $13 million in federal
reimbursement for research costs if
the tax-reform legislation pending in
Congress is passed, according to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy.
In a letter sent last month to the
Stanford Board of Trustees, Kennedy
stated: "Higher education came out a
heavy loser in the tax bill that passed
the House." The bill is a result of the
new Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
Balanced Budget Amendment.
If enacted, the tax-reform legisla
tion will severely restrict the author
ity of private universities to issue tax
exempt revenue bonds. Money from
such bonds is used to finance partially
the construction of educational
facilities.
The bill would also reduce deduc
tability of appreciated assets, mostly
real estate and securities, which make
up a substantial portion of donations
to the University. The result, accord
ing to Kennedy, would be a
"profound discouragement to the do
nation of such assets" to Stanford.
Such restrictions would put Stan
ford and other private educational in
stitutions at a "conspicuous disadvan
tage" to their public counterparts,
Kennedy told the Faculty Senate on
Nov. 7, 1985. Public universities have
unlimited borrowing abilities and tax
supported capital expenditures.
In addition, the proposals would
subject scholarships and fellowships
to new taxation and would impose
additional requirements on pension
programs maintained by universities
"Although there is great uncer
tainty about how the budget process
will fare under Gramm-Rudman,
education and research are highly
vulnerable," Kennedy said.
"Virtually all the federal funds
coming to Stanford" and other uni
versities are in the 27 percent of the
federal budget subject to automatic
cuts under the balanced budget
amendment, according to Kennedy.
The new law requires cuts in gov
ernment programs to meet declining
deficit targets with the goal of a zero

deficit in 1991. In a Feb. 3 article in
U.S. News and World Report, it was
estimated that if changes in federal
spending followed their predicted
course under Gramm-Rudman, aid to
colleges and students would be cut by
$600 million by 1988. This sum is al
most half of the total 1985 allocation
for all universities.
Stanford and other private univer
sities are actively lobbying Congress
against the bill, but they have had
little success so far.
