# New tax bill

Stanford University may be denied
between $5 and $13 million in federal
reimbursement for research costs if
the tax-reform legislation pending in
Congress is passed, according to Uni

"profound discouragement to the do
nation of such assets" to Stanford.

education and research are highly
vulnerable," Kennedy said.
