# Students reach out to make a difference
## 
### LESLIE KAUFMAN Staff writer 
If campus seemed a little empty Saturday, it wasn't
mere hallucination.
Three hundred Stanford students left campus to "reach
out and make a difference" in the lives of people in neigh
boring communities as part of the University's second
Reach Out Today Project of this acedemic year.
The students were involved in more than 20 volunteer
community service projects ranging from companionship
to the elderly to administrative help for the American
Red Cross.
The goal of Reach Out Today is to expose people to the
rewarding nature of volunteer work, according to Nina
Teicholz, campus coordinator for the project.
"Stanford is such a beautiful and idyllic place that it is
easy to ignore the rest of the community. . .. Our lives
here on campus are almost necessarily selfish, so that it
feels wonderful to be part of helping others," Teicholz
said.
Because volunteer work has a reputation for being iso
lated drudgery, Reach Out Tody is concerned with
making sure that volunteers have fun, Teicholz added.
"We want to show students that there are people out
there [who] need help, but we also want students to have
positive experieneces so we emphasize the social aspects."
Accordingly, individual projects are undertaken by
dorms so students can participate with friends.
Some dorm projects, such as fund-raising raffles and
restoration work, did not entail human contact, but the
most popular projects involved interrelations with other
people, Teicholz said.
During fall quarter, Branner organized a field day and
barbecue for about 50 children from East Palo Alto. "We

had so much fun that we almost got more out of it then the
kids. Peole just couldn't wait to do it again this quarter,"
said Xavier Briggs, Branner's volunteer coordinator.
Briggs added that he thought it was the personal contact
that made the difference. "I think everyone really enjoyed
seeing the kids. It is much more satisfying then just voting
and sending money out to a charitable organization and
people you'll never meet."
On the whole, Teicholz called Saturday's project a suc
cess. "All the dorms that participated fall quarter came
back this quarter. People really seemed enthusiastic," she
said.
Community reactions have also been very positive and
Stanford students were well received, according to Teic
holz.
"The community responds to our volunteering. They
really like having us." she said.
Though the community may enjoy Stanford volunteers,
dorm project coordinators complained that many of the
larger businesses in the area resisted giving support to the
project through donations.
"We were able to give them only short notice, and a lot
of the big chains seemed really unwilling to help.. . .
Small businesses were very generous, though. They gave
us as much as they could. The manager at Cooley Market
just let us go in and take what we needed for the barbecue
â€” food, drinks, ballons, everything," Briggs said.
University President Donald Kennedy has praised such
projects as Reach Out Today.
"Work in the community can be just as dynamic,
valuable, rewarding and exciting as what happens on
campus. Our society's problems demand creative solu
tions, and there is no better time to start to contribute
than during student years," Kennedy has said.
