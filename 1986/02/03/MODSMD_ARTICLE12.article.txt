## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Aid policy discriminates 
### 
In order to receive the benefits of government, you
must play by the rules.
This logic is reflected in the federal regulation that
requires college students to state that they have regis
tered with the Selective Service to receive federal fin
ancial aid. To get federal dollars, students must abide
by federal regulations.
But this policy is fundamentally discriminatory. The
neediest male college students are subjected to closer
governmental scrutiny than others who, by law, should
be abiding by the regulation but who are not being sub
jected to such examination.
Last week, the Department of Defense and the De
partment of Education announced that they were
teaming up to catch non-registrants. The Department
of Education will be providing the Selective Service
with the names of students who have applied for
federal financial aid this year so that the Selective Ser
vice can make a comparison between its list of
registrants and the list of aid applicants.
As it stands, male college students who lack the
money to pay Stanford's tuition — which is one of the
highest in the nation — are penalized because they

need financial assistance. Wealthier students are not
subjected to such governmental scrutiny and neither
are those men who choose not to attend college.
Women are also unaffected by the policy, since they
are exempt from registration. Finally, the policy dis
criminates against minorities, since minorities are dis
proportionately represented among those needing fin
ancial aid.
Stanford has long been opposed to this regulation,
and it has allowed men who object to registration on
grounds of conscience to get loans or work study in
stead of federal assistance. As Director of Financial
Aid Robert Huff said last week, "We try through our
own resources to allow a student to continue his educa
tion. ... If a student can't, as a matter of conscience,
sign up for federal aid, then Stanford will replace that
aid from its own funds."
But the University shouldn't have to compensate for
discrimination in federal aid. The federal government
should either seek a uniform application of the regula
tion and require all students who enroll in college to
check the "yes, I am registered for the draft" box, or it
should formulate a non-discriminatory policy.
