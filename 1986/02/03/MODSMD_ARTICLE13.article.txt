Gorbachev would
be a poor speaker
As graduating seniors, we'd like to
register our opposition to the short
sighted proposal to invite Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev to
be our Commencement speaker.
Given that the idea of bringing Gor
bachev here in June sounds exciting
at first, we hope our classmates will
take a minute to consider the implica
tions of this idea.
First of all, Gorbachev can't speak
English. Has this occurred to those
who are so avidly promoting his invi
tation? Do seniors really want to
spend their graduation exercise lis
tening to a speech read by a Soviet
translator? We can't think of any
thing more boring.
Second, the Soviet leader is a much
more irrelevant choice as a Com
mencement speaker than has been
suggested. By the nature of his posi
tion, Gorbachev will not come to
Stanford to address students, parents
and faculty. As in any speech by a
world leader, Gorbachev's comments
would be directed to the inevitably
enormous number of television, radio
and newspaper reporters who would
be here. Our graduation would be
nothing but the backdrop for an in
ternational media event.
All of the attention that Stanford
would receive in the event of a Gor
bachev visit seems to be what
motivates those who are pushing the
idea. The editorial entitled "Invite
Soviet Leader" (Daily, Nov. 25)
argued that "hosting Gorbachev
would be a real coup for Stanford." Is
that a good reason for asking him to
be our graduation speaker? We think
not.
Finally, there are huge logistical
problems that such a visit would en
tail. The campus would be teeming
with Secret Service men; searching
the thousands of people entering the
stadium could take hours. In the not

unlikely event that world affairs
prevent Gorbachev from showing up
on the appointed day, we would have
a second-choice speaker, perhaps a
retired chemistry professor.
Why not make our first choice a
sensible one? Someone like Bill
Cosby, who is also under considera
tion, would be ideal. Cosby holds a
Ph.D. in education and is clearly ca
pable of giving a substantive, relevant
speech. Furthermore, he is witty, ac
cessible and has no political agenda
which it is his job to defend. We think
such a person could be a vastly
preferable graduation speaker to the
Soviet leader, and we hope
that those responsible for deciding
whom to invite will consider the full
effects of their decision from the
standpoint of the graduating seniors.

Apartheid larger
than liberal label
In Kenneth Fenyo's column,
"Leftists are most oppressive"
(Daily, Jan. 21), he makes the
mistake that many have made regard
ing protests of South Africa's apart
heid policies. He accuses those pro
testing of hypocrisy because they
don't also protest oppression of Mis
kito Indians in Nicaragua and other
violations of human rights throughout
the world. Most of us are concerned
about these people and have been
particularly dismayed to see the San
dinistas abandon some of their
revolutionary ideals.
The reason that we single out
South Africa and the Philippines is
that they are military, political and
economic allies of the United States.
Furthermore, Stanford invests in
companies that exploit the mineral
and labor resources of these

countries. This translates into a
strong link between us and the
oppression that occurs there. The
Board of Trustees has said that we
must separate economic policy from
social policy. This is an abhorrent at
titude for a self-described "liberal"
institution to take.
Also, Fenyo's use of the term
"liberal" to describe those who are
concerned about apartheid is an in
sult. The issue transcends labels. We
are the vast majority of Americans.
We are people with consciences.
Fenyo is an economics major. Maybe
he could work to develop economies
that don't have to exploit people to
function. That would be something
we could all support.

Victims give their
thanks for support
We are residents in an Escondido
Village apartment which was
damaged in the fire last Sunday.
We would like to take this opportu
nity to thank all the wonderful, kind
people, many of them not even
known to us, who offered us every
kind of assistance imaginable and
even organized a collection for those
families affected. We feel loathe to
accept this money, but as we cannot
return it, we will use it, with much
thanks, for the necessary cleaning and
replacing of damaged possessions.
Our appreciation is also due to
those firemen, policemen and person
nel from Escondido Village Housing,
who performed their various func
tions speedily and efficiently and for
feited their enjoyment of the Super
Bowl in the process.
The warmth and generosity of so
many people in the Stanford commu
nity has turned this frightening exper
ience into a positive one for us.
