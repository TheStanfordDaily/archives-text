## Flaky Bush bad presidential pick 
### 
As a Democrat, I'm praying that the Republicans
nominate George Bush as their presidential candi
date in 1988. It will be a deeply enjoyable spectacle
to see this charlatan get the comeuppance he
deserves.
1 have not always been a Bush-hater. In 1980 he
struck me as a refreshingly moderate voice in the
Republican Party. We Democrats loved it when he
rightly called Ronald Reagan's campaign nostrums
"voodoo economics." Next to the horror of the
"Cowboy from California," Bush seemed to represent
the essence of respectable, dependable statesman
ship. It's strange how time alters one's perspectives.

These days, everyone is scratching their heads
over why President Reagan's popularity among
blacks, of all people, has suddenly shot up to record
levels. Many blacks, I think, have finaiiy realized
what took me a long time to figure out (and what I
think many of my fellow liberal Democrats would
still be loath to admit): that Reagan has earned our
affection and trust as a decent, honest leader.
I disagree as strongly as ever with most of his
policies, but I have come to realize that Reagan
says what he means, plays fair and has demon
strated a firm grasp of the art of compromise. What
I'm trying to say is, the man is hard to hate. Like
Dwight Eisenhower in the late 19505, Reagan is
now an elder statesman, his last political race over,
a man above politics. Also like Eisenhower in the
'50s, his heir-apparent is a vice president who
represents all that is shifty, shallow and con

temptible in American politics.
If Bush were just flaky, I would merely feel con
tempt for him. But he is, unfortunately, more than
a political chameleon par excellence. That there is a
more sinister side to his flakiness became apparent
in a now-almost-forgotten incident in the 1984
presidential campaign.
During 1984, while most political commentators
attempted to interpret Bush's unusual arm-waving
gesticulations, I was profoundly angered by his fa
mous smear against Walter Mondale: that Mondale
had said the Marines killed in Lebanon in 1983 had
"died in shame." Mondale, of course, never said or
implied anything of the kind. He criticized Reagan
for sending the Marines into Lebanon, and he cer
tainly implied that Reagan's "policy" was shameful
and ill-conceived. But to accuse Mondale, a
thoughtful man and a skillful politician, of casting
aspersions on soldiers who died in the service of
their country was not only outrageous, but ludi
crous.
Bush's zealous insistence on defending and
repeating this charge revealed the twin aspects of
his benighted political persona. On the sinister side,
by implying that any criticism of Reagan's military
policies amounted to stabbing in the back our boys
in the field, he sought to make Mondale look like a
traitorous wimp. Punishing dissenters on foreign
policy by questioning their loyalty and patriotism is
a familiar tactic. Bush's flaky side was revealed,
however, in the hilariously inept ways he attempted
to back up his smear against Mondale, including
Xeroxing pages out of dictionaries and handing
them to reporters (as if the definition of "shame"
were at issue, rather than who Mondale called

shameful).
Well, he's at it again, as I learned on picking up
the paper recently. New York Gov. Mario Cuomo
recently denounced ethnic slurs against Italian-
Americans and complained about commentators
who said he, as an Italian-American, had no chance
at becoming president. Bush couldn't pass this one
up. At a dinner for New York conservatives, he
lambasted Cuomo for "telling us to ignore the mil
lions of blacks, Jews, Irish, Italians, Latins and
Poles who shattered the bonds of discrimination
and built this great country with their hard work
and talent" Even for a master of devious obscurity
like Bush, this was a piece de resistance. But I think
his flakiness predominated this time. His statement
was so bizarre and incomprehensible that I must
confess I am at a loss to discern any calculable evil
intention behind it.
What is clear to me, after reviewing the career of
our contemptible vice president, is that he is not
merely a shallow political huckster with no discer
nible ideological convictions. Bush is a politician
who takes special delight in seizing upon and will
fully distorting the words of others, in the most dis
honest, shameless and self-serving way imaginable.
The only consolation is that he is so laughably in
competent at playing the demagogue that he is
bound to self-destruct eventually. Sooner or later,
one of his free-wheeling smear attacks is going to
backfire on him, with fatal political results. As a
Democrat, I hope it happens after he is nominated
in 1988. As an American, I don't think it can hap
pen too soon.
