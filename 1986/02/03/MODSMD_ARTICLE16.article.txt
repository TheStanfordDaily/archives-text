# Death is correct penalty

Terry Roach, a 25-year-old convicted murderer, was
electrocuted on Jan. 10 for a crime he committed when he
was still a minor. The press mourned this misguided youth
who was tragically cut down in his prime. The unfortunate
victim of our inhumane and merciless society was repen
tant and resigned as he met his untimely fate. Several
humanitarians have decried the punishment as immoral
and unjust. The Daily called for an end to capital punish
ment— not just for juveniles but for all criminals.

Roach was convicted for raping and killing a South
Carolina girl and murdering her companion. This occurs
so frequently in our society that the words have lost their
sting. Let's look a bit closer at his crime. While Tommy
Taylor and Carlotta Hartness were parked in a car, Roach
fired three bullets into Taylor's skull. He dragged Hart
ness, who was 14 years old, out of the car, threw her to the
ground and savagely raped her. She begged desperately
for her life. Hartness' head was marked with an "X," and
she was forced to lie naked on the ground. Roach then
fired five bullets into her body, ending her life. I per
sonally feel neither sadness nor remorse that Roach was
executed.
The fact that Mother Teresa, Jimmy Carter and U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar sent last
minute pleas to the South Carolina governor is meaning
less. Had Hartness' parents made the same pleas, that
would have been significant. They did not. The decision to
execute Roach was made with considerable scrutiny. It is
the extensive review and appeals process that makes capi
tal punishment more expensive in tax dollars than life im
prisonment.
Capital punishment should not be used often or capri
ciously. The juvenile criminals on death row are not there
for jaywalking or parking violations. Ronald Ward, 16, is
facing death in Arkansas for stabbing a 12-year-old boy
and brutally murdering two women in their 70s. James
Trimble is awaiting death in Maryland for raping a 22-
year-old woman, beating her with a baseball bat and slit
ting her throat when he was 17. The death penalty is right
fully reserved only for the most heinous and detestable
crimes.
The U.S. justice system is repeatedly being proven
soft and ineffective. Citizens lose faith and vigilantes like
Bernard Goetz become heroes. After several years in
prison, convicted killers like Theodore Streleski are back
on the streets and featured on our late-night talk shows.
Charles Manson was first eligible for parole in 1978. The

odds that Roach would have again roamed freely are quite
high. What becomes more important: the life of Roach or
the life of his next victim?
Aside from having a responsibility to the criminal, the
justice system has an obligation to provide retribution for
the victim and some assurance that the same crime will
not occur again.
Admittedly, studies conflict concerning the effect of
capital punishment as a deterrent, and our system is based
on reform and rehabilitation. Unfortunately, there will be
some failures. Some individuals will not reform, and at
some point society must decide that enough effort has
been expended. What should happen to the convicted
murderer who kills or rapes a second or third time? How
should we handle the prisoner who murders his fellow
inmates or kills a prison guard?
Some claim we do not have the right, in a moral and
civilized society, to end another person's life. It is,
however, ethically acceptable to keep this same individual
in a cage for the remainder of his life with minimal food,
no privacy, wretched squalor and the constant danger of
sexual assault and physical violence. Which punishment
seems more "cruel and unusual"?
Opponents want to abolish the death penalty because it
is discriminatory. The statistics which show that minorities
who commit serious crimes — especially when the victim
is white — more often receive the death penalty are a
serious indictment of our justice system. The solution,

important: the life of Roach
or the life of his next victim?

though, is more even-handed sentencing, not abolition of
the punishment. If more blacks receive speeding tickets
than whites, the answer is not to stop issuing speeding
tickets.
The disposition of such despicable and uncivilized
crimes as rape, murder, kidnapping and treason is not
easy or pleasant for a moral and civilized society.
However, it is unrealistic for society to declare that no
crime is so serious and no act is sufficiently barbarous to
ever warrant the death penalty. After considerable delib
eration and a fair trial, Roach died a swift and painless
death free of cruel and degrading humiliation. Carlotta
Hartness cannot make the same claim.
