## Seniors test luck outside of class 
### MAUREEN MORAN 
Senior Casino Night was an evening filled with
high energy and surprises as 800 sharply dressed
seniors exchanged $ 11 tickets at the door for
souvenir shot glasses and stacks of poker chips.
The brightly lit gambling floor was matched by
giant floating dice, festive balloons, a long buffet

stacked with elegant hors d'oeuvres and dozens
of felt-top gambling tables. Behind these tables
were the familiar faces of faculty and staff mem
bers turned into shifty-eyed dealers for the night.
Since 1978, the Alumni Association has spon
sored a casino night in honor of Stanford's
graduating senior class, and every year the
popular event has quickly sold out. This year, in

order to accommodate 300 more people. Casino
Night was moved from the traditional Menlo
Circus Club location to the Hyatt Palo Alto.
"There still weren't enough tickets to go
around," said Senior Activities Director Jeff
McColloch, underscoring the popularity of the
event. "Seniors were looking for extra tickets
everywhere and even calling me in search of
more."
And it is no wonder that many were
desparately hunting for tickets. Those lucky
enough to go said the event was a huge success.
"I wished it (Casino Night) could have lasted
all night," senior Sherri Wiemers said. Many of
her classmates agreed.
The presence of former Dean of Admissions
Fred Hargadon, the man who "let them in," gave
the night an unexpected nostalgia for the Class of
1986. Sporting a Casino Night name tag en
dorsed with his famous interjection "Great,"
Hargadon, or Dean Fred as he is known, walked
amongst the tables talking to members of one of
the last classes he welcomed to the Farm.
Most seniors spent the night stacking up their
chips at the blackjack tables, getting their
pictures taken by the army of roving photogra
phers or hitting the dance floor to be rocked by
the mixes of DJ Vinnie Politan, also a senior.
At midnight, both elated and disappointed
gamblers were asked to turn in their winnings for
raffle tickets. For the next hour, everyone
anxiously pressed around the DJ booth, while
Senior Class President Pat Shannon drew win
ning numbers from a giant craps die and dis
tributed prizes to the lucky ticket holders.
The prizes, all donated by local merchants, in
cluded hot tubbing for two, dinners for two, free
video rentals and record albums, and the old fa
vorite, Dutch Goose T-shirts. The grand prize
was a $50 dinner at Scott's Bar and Grill.
Although most seniors went home from their
gambling adventure empty handed, Senior
Casino Night was a chance to enjoy each other's
company, take some riskless chances and go
crazy on the dance floor. All career dilemmas
were forgotten and graduate school worries were
shelved as seniors made enjoying the festivities
their first priority.
