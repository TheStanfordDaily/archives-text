# Long live Lake Lag
## 
### KELLY SUND Staff writer 
For those of you praying to see
water in Lake Laganita in some form
other than small mud puddles, rain
dances are no longer a necessity.
The University's water department
will begin filling Lake Lag by the
second or third week in February, ac
cording to a spokesman from the
water department.
The starting of the pumps is contin
gent upon the completion of the rein
forcement of the dam that encircles
the lake, he said. This statement con
tradicts the popular belief that insuf
ficient rainfall has delayed the filling
of the lake. Filling has started over
winter break in the two years previ
ous to this, some have said.

The dry lake had started to create a
mild panic in some residents of
lakeside houses. Due to their close
proximity to Lake Lag, these
residences usually require low spring
quarter housing draw for assignment
to them.
Senior Sydney Smalley was glad to
hear that the lake would soon be
filled, because she considers it "one
of the major landmarks at Stanford."
Lakeside Lambda Nu resident
Betsy Swan was also happy to hear
that the lake would be filled, because
it "changes the whole atmosphere
around here. It makes it so peaceful,
quiet.. . decadent."
"Everything I associate with the
lake is good," sophomore Adrian
Chan said. "The lake is spring quar
ter. It means sunshine."

With the filling of Lake Lag to commence soon, bikers like Palo Alto
resident Tony Dragavon will not have the opportunity to wheel through
a semi-dry lake bed.
