## Clements whines a little bit in 'The Dogs' 
### JEAN KANE 
"The Dog Is Us"
By Marcelle Clements
Viking Penguin, 1985
Much like witnessing one s own father make a spectacle
of himself— say, by overhearing him absently hum a se
lection from "Oklahoma" at a funeral of state — the ex
perience of hearing a sympathetic commentator unwit
tingly lampoon your convictions provokes embarrassment
as well as dismay.
But a relative is easily enough jabbed in the ribs.
Retribution is harder to come by when the offender is far
out of reach. Thus, in her recent collection of essays, "The
Dog Is Us," journalist Marcelle Clements frustrates the
reader more often than she pleases him. Her sometimes
inept exposition often undermines her astute perceptions.
Most of the 15 pieces in the collection have appeared as
features in such publications as Rolling Stone, Esquire
and the Village Voice. The subjects include the morality
of the nylon zipper, the psychology of Sting and the
virtues of occasional sloth. Though Clements doesn't
unite her essays with a central theme, she often focuses
upon issues of conscience, especially as they relate to her
generation and its discontents.

According to the author, many of her peers, now in
their mid-30s, are still engaged in the moral quest they
began in the halcyon days of the mid-19605. The dance
has disappeared, but the melody lingers on — quietly.
The book's curious title, in fact, is taken from an essay
that examines such prototypical '60s dopers in light of
their current abandoment of marijuana.
The "dog" of the essay is the person who always wan
dered into the room — while Clements and her friends

The subjects include the morality of the nylon zipper, the
psychology of Sting . . .

were getting stoned — and performed some small action
that provoked a drug-induced epiphany or just a lot of
giggling.
"Some people used to lie down, look out their window,
and laugh because their whole universe was the dog," Cle
ments writes. "But the point is that this was my genera
tion's idea of having a good time: to take note of the ab
surd and laneh at it."

When they grow older, Clements and her friends dis
cern the state of their own "doggy" lives at such moments,
and they aren't laughing any longer. Dope, Clements says,
makes us realizes that the dog is us.
The author's speculations on the various reasons for
this phenomenon are interesting, if occasionally obvious.
Nowhere, however, does she note the irony of what she
says is her peer's usual reaction when faced with this
realization — to change their recreational drug rather

than alter the unacceptable circumstances of their lives.
Nonetheless, the title essay is more balanced than most
of the other pieces. A piece such as " Rise of the Mutant
Elite," in which Clements bemoans the current social
climate, suffers from the ills of its title. It is indulgent and
full of the sophomoric hyperbole often found in Top-40
lyrics.
The author is justifiably distressed by the blind op

timism and narrow vision of the body politic, as are a lot
of people. But she quickly trivializes her outrage through
her choice of supporting anecdotes and observations. Too
many of these are drawn from the parochial sphere of the
New York freelance writer, a person who objects to such
barbarisms as "talking bottom line."
The reader, however, is left with the impression that
these clashes of taste have less to do with the decline of
civilization than with a regrettable, but fairly obvious, fact
of adult life: Jobs, like subway cars, bring us into intimate
contact with people we'd prefer not to know.
Prolonged whining about such misfortune is rarely in
teresting unless accomplished with a good deal of wit or
style. Clements doesn't supply enough of either.
In the book's best pieces, Clements reports and inter
pets. "What Happens To Pretty Girls" examines the ef
fect of advertising's demand for ever-younger models on
the lives of teenagers. And "A Soldier's Life" describes
the existence of the author's Nicaraguan counterpart, a
young career woman who has become a Sandinista.
Both articles confront the ways in which we participate
in these destructive, seemingly remote situations. Cle
ments usually asks the right questions, but she most often
convinces us of the answers when she begins with facts
rather than ruminations.

Nowhere, however, does she note the irony of what she
says is her peer's usual reaction when faced with this
realization — to change their recreational drug rather

than alter the unacceptable circumstances of their lives.
Nonetheless, the title essay is more balanced than most
of the other pieces. A piece such as " Rise of the Mutant
Elite," in which Clements bemoans the current social
climate, suffers from the ills of its title. It is indulgent and
full of the sophomoric hyperbole often found in Top-40
lyrics.
The author is justifiably distressed by the blind op

timism and narrow vision of the body politic, as are a lot
of people. But she quickly trivializes her outrage through
her choice of supporting anecdotes and observations. Too
many of these are drawn from the parochial sphere of the
New York freelance writer, a person who objects to such
barbarisms as "talking bottom line."
The reader, however, is left with the impression that
these clashes of taste have less to do with the decline of
civilization than with a regrettable, but fairly obvious, fact
of adult life: Jobs, like subway cars, bring us into intimate
contact with people we'd prefer not to know.
Prolonged whining about such misfortune is rarely in
teresting unless accomplished with a good deal of wit or
style. Clements doesn't supply enough of either.
In the book's best pieces, Clements reports and inter
pets. "What Happens To Pretty Girls" examines the ef
fect of advertising's demand for ever-younger models on
the lives of teenagers. And "A Soldier's Life" describes
the existence of the author's Nicaraguan counterpart, a
young career woman who has become a Sandinista.
Both articles confront the ways in which we participate
in these destructive, seemingly remote situations. Cle
ments usually asks the right questions, but she most often
convinces us of the answers when she begins with facts
rather than ruminations.
