# German Gunter Grass fuses art and politics

### SUSAN MANN 
"On Writing and Politics, 1967-83"
By Gunter Grass
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $13.95
American writers are usually
purists. When they are not pounding
their typewriters, they teach at the
local university or contribute to the
literary supplements. European writ
ers, on the other hand, often fuse
politics and literary criticism. "On
Writing and Politics," a collection of
speeches and essays by the well
known West German writer Gunter
Grass, illustrates this fusion at its

finest.
Grass won international acclaim
with the publication of his first book,
"The Tin Drum," in 1959. Since
then, the originality and range of his
work as poet, novelist, playwright and
essayist have established him as one
of the most important European writ
ers of his generation.
Grass' literary fame has allowed
him to startle audiences across
Europe. He once opened a speech to
a Yugoslavian writers' association by
announcing that he opposed revolu
tion and revolutionary literature,
"the rhapsodist's snorting hob
by-horse."
While accepting a literary prize in

Rome, Grass explained his work,
"The Destruction of Mankind has
Begun": " A future will only be possi
ble again when we ... do what, as
guests on this orbiting chunk of na
ture, we owe one another ... relieve
one another of fear by disarming to
the point of nakedness."
Grass' essay on Franz Kafka turns
into an examination of the proliferat
ing bureaucracies of both Germanies.
Later, he attacks new security tech
nologies — computer banks,
electronic identity cards and wire taps
— as a "soundless, foolproof system
that purports to protect the citizen by
encroaching on his rights . . . that may
well protect democracy to death."

Grass' attacks have the verve and
serious wit of the best editorials with
some of the poet's richness of meta
phor. The freshness of his style jars us
into renewed horror at events like the
Holocaust, whose details have
become numbingly familiar.
Grass has earned the right to speak
on such matters. Since the early
19605, he has done day-to-day and
occasional full-time political work for
the German Social Democrats. He
has chronicled the demise of the Jews
of his native city of Danzig and
publicly admitted that, had he been a
few years older, he might have partic
ipated in Nazi crimes.
Outside of Europe, Grass seems to

lose this self-critical awareness, and
his accounts of his travels are the
weakest essays in the book. After an
eight-day visit to Nicaragua, Grass
lauds the Sandinistas' "early Chris
tian simplicity and directness." He
praises their humane penology and
relocation of Indians.
Grass then compares the Sandinis
tas to the Solidarity movement and
tells the Pope their revolution should
be his. Grass might have condemned
U.S. intervention in Nicaragua with
out conferring sainthood on a culture
he does not know and a people whose
language he cannot speak.
Nonetheless, the essay on
Nicaragua, "Superpower Back

yards,' and its companion piece
about nuclear proliferation, "On the
Right to Resist," hammer home an
important message. Many Europeans
like Grass dismiss the United States
in anger and disgust as the mirror
image of the Soviet Union. The iden
tity is exaggerated, but the questions
it raises about the validity of our cur
rent foreign policy and arms buildup
should be answered.
Grass portrays a threatened world,
but his essays do not darken the
reader's view. In the energy and wit
of his satire lurks a warm, human
hope that well-chosen words have
power and that the problems we face
will find at least partial solutions.
