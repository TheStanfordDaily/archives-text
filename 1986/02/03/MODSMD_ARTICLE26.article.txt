"Hwaet!"
By Peter Glassgold
Sun & Moon Press, $6.95
"Hwaet!" A horde of ruffians stampedes through the
countryside, bawling rhythmic war songs and sporadically
knifing rival gangs. These are the Germanic tribes who, a
thousand years ago, inhabited the English countryside.
They may have been barbarians, but they were also the
first people to speak a language recognizable as English.
Each tribe had a cheerleader called a scop —
etymologically, the word means "scoffer." In a joking,
verbose way, the wop yelled in praise of the valour of the
tribe's men and the beauty of the women, and he shouted
insults at its enemies.
The alliterative chants have four strong beats in each
line, and the wo/' begins each recital with a ritual shout of,
"Hwaet\"
"Hwaet!" is also the title of a hook by Peter Glassgold
which contains translations of modern American poems
into the tribe's language. Old English. The idea is to teach
us something about the nature of present-day poetry. But
it's also a lot of fun, kind of like visualizing Ronald
Reagan dressed in a toga.
You don't need to know any Old English to enjoy this
book. The original poems and their translations are
printed on facing pages. There's a helpful note on the
pronunciation of Old English in the preface, though it
would have been a good idea to explain more about the
vowel sounds. With a little practice, you'll soon find your
self reciting Old English fluently.
Glassgold has a hidden agenda, a fervent belief that
American poetry should be 100 percent American. He
refuses to translate any verse by W.H. Auden or T.S. Eliot

— both of whom have imitated Old English verse torms
— on the grounds that the one was born in England and
the other one died there.
Glassgold thinks modern American poetry at its best
preserves the "purity and clarity of . . . American
speech." He also thinks poems of this kind will come
across very well in Old English, because they aren't de
pendent on a flashy verbal surface or word play.
A manifesto for Glassgold's favorite type of poetry
could be this extract from a poem by Denise Levertov,
which he translates elegantly and straightforwardly. "I
would like to make .. . / poems direct as what the bird
said, / hard as a floor, sound as a bench, / mysterious as the
silence when the tailor / would pause with his needle in the
air."
The fact is, though, that the sort of simplicity which
Glassgold admires is characteristic neither of modern
American poetry nor of the modern English language.
Ever since Shakespeare, writers have jumped from the
grandiloquent words of Latin origin to the blunter Ger
manic words in order to give greater force to each.
Similarly, poems in the U.S. tradition move between two
voices, the one orotund and rhetorical, the other "just
plain folks."
This is true, for instance, in one of Ezra Pound's poems,
"In a Station of the Metro." In its entirety, the poem
reads: "The apparition of those faces in the crowd: / Pe
tals on a wet, black bough."
Glassgold translates the second line with ease, but he
has difficulty finding an Old English equivalent for
"apparition." In a footnote, Glassgold argues that this
shows the first line is "un-English" and,"It was the
second, more thoroughly 'Saxon' line which came full
blown to the poet."
According to Pound himself, however, both lines came

with equal difficulty. What Glassgold fails to appreciate is
that the homespun second line stands out by contrast to
the more abstract first line.
There are also some contextual problems with the
translations. Hard Germanic words can have a shock
value in modern English, but the contrast just isn't there
when everything is in Old English. An example is a surreal
poem by Jerome Rothenberg, "A Poem in Yellow After
Tristan Tzara." It ends: "O dizzy human heart / my yellow
dingdong." The alliterative jangle doesn't stand out much
in the Old English translation.
The ultimate in untranslatable poems is surely one by
Marianne Moore, in which she ironically addresses a
steamroller which is crushing everthing in its path. "Were
not impersonal judgement in aesthetic / matters a metap
hysical impossibility, you might fair achieve it." Abstract
reflections were quite beyond the simple-minded Anglo-
Saxons.
Glassgold battles valiantly to translate this. One back
translation of Glassgold's translation of the italicized sec
tion above reads: "Not-one's-own-doom in
understanding-ish in-things, an out-wit-ly un-might
ness." Needless to say, it doesn't have quite the same ring.
As an Old English poem in its own right, Glasgold's
best translation is that of Wallace Stevens' "Anecdote of
the Jar:" "I placed a jar in Tennessee / An round it was,
upon a hill. / It made the slovenly wilderness / Surround
that hill . . . ." The calm straightforwardness of the poem
carries across the language barrier.
This is a poem which matches Glassgold's ideal of
"pure" American language. Reading it in Old English
makes one realize that the Anglo-Saxons may have been a
bunch of gangsters, but they were also hicks, simple
country folk who might fit in well in rural Tennessee.

You don't need to know any Old English to enjoy this
book. The original poems and their translations are

would have been a good idea to explain more about the
vowel sounds. With a little practice, you'll soon find your
self reciting Old English fluently.
Glassgold has a hidden agenda, a fervent belief that
American poetry should be 100 percent American. He
refuses to translate any verse by W.H. Auden or T.S. Eliot

— both of whom have imitated Old English verse torms
— on the grounds that the one was born in England and
the other one died there.
Glassgold thinks modern American poetry at its best
preserves the "purity and clarity of . . . American
speech." He also thinks poems of this kind will come
across very well in Old English, because they aren't de
pendent on a flashy verbal surface or word play.
A manifesto for Glassgold's favorite type of poetry
could be this extract from a poem by Denise Levertov,
which he translates elegantly and straightforwardly. "I
would like to make .. . / poems direct as what the bird
said, / hard as a floor, sound as a bench, / mysterious as the
silence when the tailor / would pause with his needle in the
air."
The fact is, though, that the sort of simplicity which
Glassgold admires is characteristic neither of modern
American poetry nor of the modern English language.
Ever since Shakespeare, writers have jumped from the
grandiloquent words of Latin origin to the blunter Ger
manic words in order to give greater force to each.
Similarly, poems in the U.S. tradition move between two
voices, the one orotund and rhetorical, the other "just
plain folks."
This is true, for instance, in one of Ezra Pound's poems,
"In a Station of the Metro." In its entirety, the poem
reads: "The apparition of those faces in the crowd: / Pe
tals on a wet, black bough."
Glassgold translates the second line with ease, but he
has difficulty finding an Old English equivalent for
"apparition." In a footnote, Glassgold argues that this
shows the first line is "un-English" and,"It was the
second, more thoroughly 'Saxon' line which came full
blown to the poet."
According to Pound himself, however, both lines came

with equal difficulty. What Glassgold fails to appreciate is
that the homespun second line stands out by contrast to
the more abstract first line.
There are also some contextual problems with the
translations. Hard Germanic words can have a shock
value in modern English, but the contrast just isn't there
when everything is in Old English. An example is a surreal
poem by Jerome Rothenberg, "A Poem in Yellow After
Tristan Tzara." It ends: "O dizzy human heart / my yellow
dingdong." The alliterative jangle doesn't stand out much
in the Old English translation.
The ultimate in untranslatable poems is surely one by
Marianne Moore, in which she ironically addresses a
steamroller which is crushing everthing in its path. "Were
not impersonal judgement in aesthetic / matters a metap
hysical impossibility, you might fair achieve it." Abstract
reflections were quite beyond the simple-minded Anglo-
Saxons.
Glassgold battles valiantly to translate this. One back
translation of Glassgold's translation of the italicized sec
tion above reads: "Not-one's-own-doom in
understanding-ish in-things, an out-wit-ly un-might
ness." Needless to say, it doesn't have quite the same ring.
As an Old English poem in its own right, Glasgold's
best translation is that of Wallace Stevens' "Anecdote of
the Jar:" "I placed a jar in Tennessee / An round it was,
upon a hill. / It made the slovenly wilderness / Surround
that hill . . . ." The calm straightforwardness of the poem
carries across the language barrier.
This is a poem which matches Glassgold's ideal of
"pure" American language. Reading it in Old English
makes one realize that the Anglo-Saxons may have been a
bunch of gangsters, but they were also hicks, simple
country folk who might fit in well in rural Tennessee.

"Hwaet!"
By Peter Glassgold
Sun & Moon Press, $6.95
"Hwaet!" A horde of ruffians stampedes through the
countryside, bawling rhythmic war songs and sporadically
knifing rival gangs. These are the Germanic tribes who, a
thousand years ago, inhabited the English countryside.
They may have been barbarians, but they were also the
first people to speak a language recognizable as English.
Each tribe had a cheerleader called a scop —
etymologically, the word means "scoffer." In a joking,
verbose way, the wop yelled in praise of the valour of the
tribe's men and the beauty of the women, and he shouted
insults at its enemies.
