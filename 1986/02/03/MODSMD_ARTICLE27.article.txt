## Upset of OSU puts Card in Pac-10 race 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
CORVALLIS, Ore. — It had been
21 years, but the Stanford men's bas
ketball team was not living in the
past.
The Cardinal hadn't swept a road
trip in the state of Oregon since 1965,
but Stanford Coach Tom Davis
wasn't dwelling on that fact this
weekend.
"To tell you the truth, I hadn't
even thought about it," Davis said
yesterday, moments after his team
posted its biggest victory of the
season, defeating Oregon State here,
56-52.
After a 73-69 overtime win Friday
at Oregon, the Cardinal now finds it
self in a tie for third place in the
Pacific 10 Conference with the
Beavers and California at 5-4.
The Bears had a chance to be all
alone in third, but they lost to Oregon
yesterday 60-54.
Stanford is now 11-10 overall,
while Oregon State falls to 9-8. Both
are two games behind first-place
Washington, which lost Saturday to
second-place Arizona, 70-57.
"It was a really big game for us,"
said guard Todd Lichti, who led a
balanced Cardinal attack with 13
points. "Now we're in the thick of
things in third place, and that's where
we want to be. We really couldn't be
happier with this trip."
"It's a phenomenal achievement
when you consider we've lost our top
guard and our top forward," Davis
said, referring to Steve Brown and
Earl Koberlein, both of whom are out
for the season.
The Cardinal led from start to
finish, surprising the Beavers by
opening a 33-23 halftime lead that
caused the crowd of 7,892 at Gill
Coliseum to boo its team as the half
ended.

"1 think we came ready to play and
didn't let up all game," Lichti said.
"I feel sorry for the student body
and for our fans for the performance
we displayed today," said Oregon
State Coach Ralph Miller, the win
ningest active coach in NCAA Divi
sion I basketball.
The Cardinal shut down center
Jose Ortiz, the 22-year-old rookie
from Cayey, Puerto Rico, in the first
half. Ortiz scored only two points in
the half, though he came on to finish
with 17. The 6-foot-10 Ortiz entered
the game with a 19.2 point-per-game
average.
"We really just played him straight
up, laid off on the outside guys and
gave him a little extra attention,"
Davis said. "It was nothing special;
we just played hard. I thought
Howard Wright and Greg Butler, a
freshman and a sophomore, really did
a good job on him."
"That's the kind of defense Jose is
going to face all year, so he'd better
get used to it," Miller said. "Anytime
you have a good post man, a team
like Arizona or Stanford is going to
collapse on him. He's got to catch the
ball and kick it back out."
On offense the Cardinal relied on
penetration by Lichti and guard
Novian Whitsitt and strong rebound
ing by Wright and Butler. Lichti
finished with 13 points, and the
others had 11.
"I think their defense allowed us to
do it a little more," Lichti said, ex
plaining the drives inside. "They tried
to force us to run our offense outside
to force some turnovers, but they left
a lot of holes."
"They scored 14 points off our
backboard," Miller said, "ten in the
second half. That's the most anyone's
scored off our backboard this year.
And we only scored four off theirs."
Wright finished with nine
rebounds, and Butler had eight as

Stanford outrebounded Oregon State
33-24.
With just over three minutes to go
and Stanford holding on to a four
point lead, Andy Fischer fired up a
25-foot prayer as the shot clock
expired that Butler was around to an
swer, putting in the rebound and an
ensuing free throw to make it 49-42
Stanford.
Ortiz scored on a tap-in to cut it to
five, and after Ramee was whistled on
a disputed double-dribble call, guard
Darrin Houston popped a jumper to
close the margin to 49-46 with 1:46
left.
Ramee came back after taking 20
seconds off the clock to hit both ends
of a one-and-one and make it 51-46,
and OSU proceeded to miss four
chances to cut it back to three.
Lichti canned a pair of free throws
with 51 seconds left, and a wide-open
Fischer went the distance with an out
let pass from Wright to open a 55-46
lead.
But it wasn't over yet. Darryl
Flowers hit an easy lay up as the Card
inal defense backed off to avoid a
three-point play. Steve Woodside
made a steal, and Van Anderson
scored on the layup to close it to 55-
50 with 15 seconds left.
Fischer's inbound pass then went
over the endline untouched, giving
the Beavers the ball back under their
own basket. Ortiz scored right away
inside to close it to 55-52, but Lichti
hit a free throw with nine seconds left
to close the scoring.
"We didn't deserve to catch up,"
Miller said. "Stanford controlled this
game all the way. They certainly
deserved to win this game. They out
played us in every area of fundamen
tal basketball. If a team does that,
they should win, and they did."
Davis was a pleasant contrast to the
somber Miller. "I couldn't have been
more pleased with the poise of this

group, considering their inexperi
ence," he said. "1 couldn't have been
prouder of how we played today."
Davis was also proud Friday night,
when Stanford avenged an earlier 83-
69 loss to Oregon and posted its 73-
69 victory in Eugene before 7,368 at
Mc Arthur Court.

The win was the first in overtime
for Stanford since a 93-91 victory
over USC in the final game of the
1979-80 season. The Cardinal had
lost seven straight in OT since then,
including a 76-75 loss to Seton Hall
and a 67-65 double-overtime loss to
Maryland this season.

This one was in doubt until Wright
hit a turnaround five-footer with the
shot clock about to expire to give the
Cardinal the four-point lead with
nine seconds left in overtime. Butler
had gotten the ball in the right corner
and appeared ready to shoot it, but
instead fed Wright for the hoop.
"I knew the guy behind me thought
that G.B. had taken the shot, so he
was looking to screen me out,"
Wright said. "I got the ball and
turned to shoot as quick as I could."
Oregon guard David Girley sent
the game into the extra period when
he hit a 20-foot jumper from the
circle with seven seconds left to tie it
at 67-67. Wright had made his first
big play of the game about a minute
and-a-half earlier. After Lichti tied
things at 65-65 with 1:45 left, Wright
decoyed the Ducks into thinking for
ward Anthony Taylor was open for a
easy layup off an inbound. Wright in
tercepted the pass, and then scored
the go-ahead basket off a rebound
with 39 seconds left.
"I think (Asst. Coach) Gary Close
did an excellent job of preparing
them for that play," Davis said of his
scout team coach. "The Gray Team
gave us exactly what Oregon would
do."
In the overtime, Butler hit a pair of
free throws with 3:20 left, and Ramee
hit two with 1:03 left to give Stanford
a 71-67 lead.
Anthony Taylor, who had scored
24 points in the Ducks' win at Maples
Pavilion, but was held to 16 Friday,
scored on a drive to cut the lead to
71-69 with 54 seconds to go.
With the 45-second clock this year,
that meant Stanford had to shoot by
the nine-second mark, and the Ducks
decided not to foul Stanford. They
hadn't counted on Wright.
"I felt we would rebound the ball
and get a shot," Oregon Coach Don
Monson said, defending his strategy.

With the help of the fine overall play of forward Greg Butler (with ball),
Stanford was able to wrestle wins away from Oregon and Oregon State.
Over the weekend, Butler scored 25 points, grabbed 14 rebounds and
had a game-clinching assist on Friday against the Ducks.

Flowers hit an easy lay up as the Card
inal defense backed off to avoid a
three-point play. Steve Woodside
made a steal, and Van Anderson
scored on the layup to close it to 55-
50 with 15 seconds left.
Fischer's inbound pass then went
over the endline untouched, giving
the Beavers the ball back under their
own basket. Ortiz scored right away
inside to close it to 55-52, but Lichti
hit a free throw with nine seconds left
to close the scoring.
"We didn't deserve to catch up,"
Miller said. "Stanford controlled this
game all the way. They certainly
deserved to win this game. They out
played us in every area of fundamen
tal basketball. If a team does that,
they should win, and they did."
Davis was a pleasant contrast to the
somber Miller. "I couldn't have been
more pleased with the poise of this

group, considering their inexperi
ence," he said. "1 couldn't have been
prouder of how we played today."
Davis was also proud Friday night,
when Stanford avenged an earlier 83-
69 loss to Oregon and posted its 73-
69 victory in Eugene before 7,368 at
Mc Arthur Court.

The win was the first in overtime
for Stanford since a 93-91 victory
over USC in the final game of the
1979-80 season. The Cardinal had
lost seven straight in OT since then,
including a 76-75 loss to Seton Hall
and a 67-65 double-overtime loss to
Maryland this season.

This one was in doubt until Wright
hit a turnaround five-footer with the
shot clock about to expire to give the
Cardinal the four-point lead with
nine seconds left in overtime. Butler
had gotten the ball in the right corner
and appeared ready to shoot it, but
instead fed Wright for the hoop.
"I knew the guy behind me thought
that G.B. had taken the shot, so he
was looking to screen me out,"
Wright said. "I got the ball and
turned to shoot as quick as I could."
Oregon guard David Girley sent
the game into the extra period when
he hit a 20-foot jumper from the
circle with seven seconds left to tie it
at 67-67. Wright had made his first
big play of the game about a minute
and-a-half earlier. After Lichti tied
things at 65-65 with 1:45 left, Wright
decoyed the Ducks into thinking for
ward Anthony Taylor was open for a
easy layup off an inbound. Wright in
tercepted the pass, and then scored
the go-ahead basket off a rebound
with 39 seconds left.
"I think (Asst. Coach) Gary Close
did an excellent job of preparing
them for that play," Davis said of his
scout team coach. "The Gray Team
gave us exactly what Oregon would
do."
In the overtime, Butler hit a pair of
free throws with 3:20 left, and Ramee
hit two with 1:03 left to give Stanford
a 71-67 lead.
Anthony Taylor, who had scored
24 points in the Ducks' win at Maples
Pavilion, but was held to 16 Friday,
scored on a drive to cut the lead to
71-69 with 54 seconds to go.
With the 45-second clock this year,
that meant Stanford had to shoot by
the nine-second mark, and the Ducks
decided not to foul Stanford. They
hadn't counted on Wright.
"I felt we would rebound the ball
and get a shot," Oregon Coach Don
Monson said, defending his strategy.

With the help of the fine overall play of forward Greg Butler (with ball),
Stanford was able to wrestle wins away from Oregon and Oregon State.
Over the weekend, Butler scored 25 points, grabbed 14 rebounds and
had a game-clinching assist on Friday against the Ducks.
CORVALLIS, Ore. — It had been
21 years, but the Stanford men's bas
ketball team was not living in the
past.
The Cardinal hadn't swept a road
trip in the state of Oregon since 1965,
but Stanford Coach Tom Davis
wasn't dwelling on that fact this
weekend.
"To tell you the truth, I hadn't
even thought about it," Davis said
yesterday, moments after his team
posted its biggest victory of the
season, defeating Oregon State here,
56-52.
After a 73-69 overtime win Friday
at Oregon, the Cardinal now finds it
self in a tie for third place in the
Pacific 10 Conference with the
Beavers and California at 5-4.
The Bears had a chance to be all
alone in third, but they lost to Oregon
yesterday 60-54.
Stanford is now 11-10 overall,
while Oregon State falls to 9-8. Both
are two games behind first-place
Washington, which lost Saturday to
second-place Arizona, 70-57.
"It was a really big game for us,"
said guard Todd Lichti, who led a
balanced Cardinal attack with 13
points. "Now we're in the thick of
things in third place, and that's where
we want to be. We really couldn't be
happier with this trip."
"It's a phenomenal achievement
when you consider we've lost our top
guard and our top forward," Davis
said, referring to Steve Brown and
Earl Koberlein, both of whom are out
for the season.
The Cardinal led from start to
finish, surprising the Beavers by
opening a 33-23 halftime lead that
caused the crowd of 7,892 at Gill
Coliseum to boo its team as the half
ended.

"1 think we came ready to play and
didn't let up all game," Lichti said.
"I feel sorry for the student body
and for our fans for the performance
we displayed today," said Oregon
State Coach Ralph Miller, the win
ningest active coach in NCAA Divi
sion I basketball.
The Cardinal shut down center
Jose Ortiz, the 22-year-old rookie
from Cayey, Puerto Rico, in the first
half. Ortiz scored only two points in
the half, though he came on to finish
with 17. The 6-foot-10 Ortiz entered
the game with a 19.2 point-per-game
average.
"We really just played him straight
up, laid off on the outside guys and
gave him a little extra attention,"
Davis said. "It was nothing special;
we just played hard. I thought
Howard Wright and Greg Butler, a
freshman and a sophomore, really did
a good job on him."
"That's the kind of defense Jose is
going to face all year, so he'd better
get used to it," Miller said. "Anytime
you have a good post man, a team
like Arizona or Stanford is going to
collapse on him. He's got to catch the
ball and kick it back out."
On offense the Cardinal relied on
penetration by Lichti and guard
Novian Whitsitt and strong rebound
ing by Wright and Butler. Lichti
finished with 13 points, and the
others had 11.
"I think their defense allowed us to
do it a little more," Lichti said, ex
plaining the drives inside. "They tried
to force us to run our offense outside
to force some turnovers, but they left
a lot of holes."
"They scored 14 points off our
backboard," Miller said, "ten in the
second half. That's the most anyone's
scored off our backboard this year.
And we only scored four off theirs."
Wright finished with nine
rebounds, and Butler had eight as

Stanford outrebounded Oregon State
33-24.
With just over three minutes to go
and Stanford holding on to a four
point lead, Andy Fischer fired up a
25-foot prayer as the shot clock
expired that Butler was around to an
swer, putting in the rebound and an
ensuing free throw to make it 49-42
Stanford.
Ortiz scored on a tap-in to cut it to
five, and after Ramee was whistled on
a disputed double-dribble call, guard
Darrin Houston popped a jumper to
close the margin to 49-46 with 1:46
left.
Ramee came back after taking 20
seconds off the clock to hit both ends
of a one-and-one and make it 51-46,
and OSU proceeded to miss four
chances to cut it back to three.
Lichti canned a pair of free throws
with 51 seconds left, and a wide-open
Fischer went the distance with an out
let pass from Wright to open a 55-46
lead.
But it wasn't over yet. Darryl
Flowers hit an easy lay up as the Card
inal defense backed off to avoid a
three-point play. Steve Woodside
made a steal, and Van Anderson
scored on the layup to close it to 55-

while Oregon State falls to 9-8. Both
are two games behind first-place
Washington, which lost Saturday to
second-place Arizona, 70-57.
"It was a really big game for us,"
said guard Todd Lichti, who led a
balanced Cardinal attack with 13
points. "Now we're in the thick of
things in third place, and that's where
we want to be. We really couldn't be
happier with this trip."
"It's a phenomenal achievement
when you consider we've lost our top
guard and our top forward," Davis
said, referring to Steve Brown and
Earl Koberlein, both of whom are out
for the season.
The Cardinal led from start to
finish, surprising the Beavers by
opening a 33-23 halftime lead that
caused the crowd of 7,892 at Gill
Coliseum to boo its team as the half
ended.

"1 think we came ready to play and
didn't let up all game," Lichti said.
"I feel sorry for the student body
and for our fans for the performance
we displayed today," said Oregon
State Coach Ralph Miller, the win
ningest active coach in NCAA Divi
sion I basketball.
The Cardinal shut down center
Jose Ortiz, the 22-year-old rookie
from Cayey, Puerto Rico, in the first
half. Ortiz scored only two points in
the half, though he came on to finish
with 17. The 6-foot-10 Ortiz entered
the game with a 19.2 point-per-game
average.
"We really just played him straight
up, laid off on the outside guys and
gave him a little extra attention,"
Davis said. "It was nothing special;
we just played hard. I thought
Howard Wright and Greg Butler, a
freshman and a sophomore, really did
a good job on him."
"That's the kind of defense Jose is
going to face all year, so he'd better
get used to it," Miller said. "Anytime
you have a good post man, a team
like Arizona or Stanford is going to
collapse on him. He's got to catch the
ball and kick it back out."
On offense the Cardinal relied on
penetration by Lichti and guard
Novian Whitsitt and strong rebound
ing by Wright and Butler. Lichti
finished with 13 points, and the
others had 11.
"I think their defense allowed us to
do it a little more," Lichti said, ex
plaining the drives inside. "They tried
to force us to run our offense outside
to force some turnovers, but they left
a lot of holes."
"They scored 14 points off our
backboard," Miller said, "ten in the
second half. That's the most anyone's
scored off our backboard this year.
And we only scored four off theirs."
Wright finished with nine
rebounds, and Butler had eight as

Stanford outrebounded Oregon State
33-24.
With just over three minutes to go
and Stanford holding on to a four
point lead, Andy Fischer fired up a
25-foot prayer as the shot clock
expired that Butler was around to an
swer, putting in the rebound and an
ensuing free throw to make it 49-42
Stanford.
Ortiz scored on a tap-in to cut it to
five, and after Ramee was whistled on
a disputed double-dribble call, guard
Darrin Houston popped a jumper to
close the margin to 49-46 with 1:46
left.
Ramee came back after taking 20
seconds off the clock to hit both ends
of a one-and-one and make it 51-46,
and OSU proceeded to miss four
chances to cut it back to three.
Lichti canned a pair of free throws
with 51 seconds left, and a wide-open
Fischer went the distance with an out
let pass from Wright to open a 55-46
lead.
But it wasn't over yet. Darryl
Flowers hit an easy lay up as the Card
inal defense backed off to avoid a
three-point play. Steve Woodside
made a steal, and Van Anderson
scored on the layup to close it to 55-
50 with 15 seconds left.
Fischer's inbound pass then went
over the endline untouched, giving
the Beavers the ball back under their
own basket. Ortiz scored right away
inside to close it to 55-52, but Lichti
hit a free throw with nine seconds left
to close the scoring.
"We didn't deserve to catch up,"
Miller said. "Stanford controlled this
game all the way. They certainly
deserved to win this game. They out
played us in every area of fundamen
tal basketball. If a team does that,
they should win, and they did."
Davis was a pleasant contrast to the
somber Miller. "I couldn't have been
more pleased with the poise of this

group, considering their inexperi
ence," he said. "1 couldn't have been
prouder of how we played today."
Davis was also proud Friday night,
when Stanford avenged an earlier 83-
69 loss to Oregon and posted its 73-
69 victory in Eugene before 7,368 at
Mc Arthur Court.

The win was the first in overtime
for Stanford since a 93-91 victory
over USC in the final game of the
1979-80 season. The Cardinal had
lost seven straight in OT since then,
including a 76-75 loss to Seton Hall
and a 67-65 double-overtime loss to
Maryland this season.

This one was in doubt until Wright
hit a turnaround five-footer with the
shot clock about to expire to give the
Cardinal the four-point lead with
nine seconds left in overtime. Butler
had gotten the ball in the right corner
and appeared ready to shoot it, but
instead fed Wright for the hoop.
"I knew the guy behind me thought
that G.B. had taken the shot, so he
was looking to screen me out,"
Wright said. "I got the ball and
turned to shoot as quick as I could."
Oregon guard David Girley sent
the game into the extra period when
he hit a 20-foot jumper from the
circle with seven seconds left to tie it
at 67-67. Wright had made his first
big play of the game about a minute
and-a-half earlier. After Lichti tied
things at 65-65 with 1:45 left, Wright
decoyed the Ducks into thinking for
ward Anthony Taylor was open for a
easy layup off an inbound. Wright in
tercepted the pass, and then scored
the go-ahead basket off a rebound
with 39 seconds left.
"I think (Asst. Coach) Gary Close
did an excellent job of preparing
them for that play," Davis said of his
scout team coach. "The Gray Team
gave us exactly what Oregon would
do."
In the overtime, Butler hit a pair of
free throws with 3:20 left, and Ramee
hit two with 1:03 left to give Stanford
a 71-67 lead.
Anthony Taylor, who had scored
24 points in the Ducks' win at Maples
Pavilion, but was held to 16 Friday,
scored on a drive to cut the lead to
71-69 with 54 seconds to go.
With the 45-second clock this year,
that meant Stanford had to shoot by
the nine-second mark, and the Ducks
decided not to foul Stanford. They
hadn't counted on Wright.
"I felt we would rebound the ball
and get a shot," Oregon Coach Don
Monson said, defending his strategy.

With the help of the fine overall play of forward Greg Butler (with ball),
Stanford was able to wrestle wins away from Oregon and Oregon State.
Over the weekend, Butler scored 25 points, grabbed 14 rebounds and
had a game-clinching assist on Friday against the Ducks.
