# McDowell shuts down Spartans
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Editorial staff 
Considering it was a last-minute pickup game with a non-conference op
ponent, the Stanford baseball team did a pretty respectable job Saturday.
On a muddy, slippery Sunken Diamond, the Cardinal squashed San Jose
State for the third time this season, as sophomore Jack McDowell scattered
three hits en route to a 5-0 complete-game win. Stanford scraped out only
seven singles, but aggressive baserunning turned those hits into a safe cushion
for McDowell.
The Cardinal (3-0) had been scheduled to meet 1 lth-ranked Fullerton State
this weekend, but the heavy rains kept the Titans from making the trip. When
the clouds took a brief respite on Saturday, Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
whipped up a two-game series with the Spartans (0-3). Yesterday's game with
San Jose State was rained out.
"It was a real casual game," said left fielder Walt Harris, who rapped out
two singles, stole three bases and scored twice on Saturday. "I don't know if
everyone was really prepared to play with the rain and everything."
"It was better than not playing anyone at all," catcher John Ramos said.
Ramos equalled Harris with two hits and an RBI. "I've been getting kind of
anxious just sitting around waiting to play," Ramos added.
Ramos opened the scoring almost singlehandedly in the second inning. He
singled, stole second, advanced to third on a wild pitch and came home on a
double-play grounder. And in the next inning, Harris did a little run
manufacturing of his own.
Harris lined a single and moved to third on a stolen base and a passed ball.
After Ruben Amaro walked, the stage was set for one of the Cardinal's pet
plays.

Using primarily his slider and split-fingered fastball, Stanford pitcher
Jack McDowell threw a three-hit shutout in the Cardinal's 5-0 win over
San Jose State on Saturday. It was McDowell's second win of the
season.
As Amaro took off for second,
Harris began walking toward the
plate. The San Jose State catcher
jumped up and faked a throw to
second, then, confused, threw behind
Harris to third base. Harris scored
easily and Amaro rolled around to
third, eventually coming home on a
throwing error by the Spartan second
baseman.
"Qne of our main emphases this
year is to try to make the other team
make mistakes," Harris said.
The Cardinal added a pair of insur
ance runs in the eighth on four hits,
one of them a line-drive single by
Ramos that brought Amaro across
for the game's only "clean" RBI. By
that time, however, it was clear that
McDowell would not need any more
help.
Just as he had last Friday in San
Jose, the 6-foot-5 sophomore baffled
the Spartan hitters with his slider and
a mean split-fingered fastball. He
threw just over 100 pitches and
looked, in Ramos' words, in "mid
season form."
