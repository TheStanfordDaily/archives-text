# McDowell shuts down Spartans

### GEOFF SANBORN Editorial staff 
Considering it was a last-minute pickup game with a non-conference op
ponent, the Stanford baseball team did a pretty respectable job Saturday.
On a muddy, slippery Sunken Diamond, the Cardinal squashed San Jose
State for the third time this season, as sophomore Jack McDowell scattered
three hits en route to a 5-0 complete-game win. Stanford scraped out only
seven singles, but aggressive baserunning turned those hits into a safe cushion
for McDowell.
The Cardinal (3-0) had been scheduled to meet 1 lth-ranked Fullerton State
this weekend, but the heavy rains kept the Titans from making the trip. When
the clouds took a brief respite on Saturday, Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
whipped up a two-game series with the Spartans (0-3). Yesterday's game with
San Jose State was rained out.
"It was a real casual game," said left fielder Walt Harris, who rapped out
two singles, stole three bases and scored twice on Saturday. "I don't know if
everyone was really prepared to play with the rain and everything."
"It was better than not playing anyone at all," catcher John Ramos said.
Ramos equalled Harris with two hits and an RBI. "I've been getting kind of
anxious just sitting around waiting to play," Ramos added.
Ramos opened the scoring almost singlehandedly in the second inning. He
singled, stole second, advanced to third on a wild pitch and came home on a
double-play grounder. And in the next inning, Harris did a little run
manufacturing of his own.
Harris lined a single and moved to third on a stolen base and a passed ball.
After Ruben Amaro walked, the stage was set for one of the Cardinal's pet
plays.
