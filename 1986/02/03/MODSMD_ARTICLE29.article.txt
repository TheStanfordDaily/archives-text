# Swimmers sink Arizona St.
## Men rain all over Sun Devils in Friday's 73-40 rout 
### AMY FRANCETIC Staff writer 
Although the rainy weather made the specta
tors soggy, it didn't seem to dampen the spirits of
the Stanford men's swim team Friday afternoon
in DeGuerre Pool. They not only squashed
Arizona State 73-40, but they even managed to
break some records and record some NCAA
qualifying times in the downpour.
The 400-yard medley relay team, composed of
Jay Mortenson, John Moffet, Pablo Morales and
John Hodge, started the meet off right by splash
ing past ASU to win with a time of 3:20.70. They
swam nearly 12 seconds faster than the Sun
Devils and qualified for the NC A As.
Junior Jeff Kostoff anticipated some heat from
ASU's Scott Brackett, who had held the best

1,000 freestyle time in the nation. But Kostoff
kicked past Brackett and everyone for an easy
first-place finish and a new pool record of
8:54.61, breaking his old record set in 1984 by .2
seconds.
"I hadn't swam the 1.000 freestyle since last
year, but 1 had a rough idea of what I wanted to
do. I could've gone a little bit faster," Kostoff
said.
Kostoff displayed similar speed and endurance
in the 500 freestyle later in the meet. He won
with a NCAA qualifying time of 4:22.58. "Jeffs
way ahead of where he was last year at this time,
mentally and physically," Stanford Assistant
Coach Ted Knapp said.
Morales, a junior, performed characteristically
by winning both of his events. He posted a
1:50.19 in the 200 individual medley and a

1:46.82 in the 200 butterfly. Teammate Anthony
Mosse swam a close second t'l : 47.79) in the 200
butterfly.
Knapp was pleased with the races that fresh
men Hodge, Dave Schraven and Kurt Kroesche
swam Friday. "All three have showed two-to
three second improvements from meets earlier in
the year," Knapp said.
The Cardinal divers also seemed unaffected by
the wind and rain. Seniors Thor Johnson and
Tom Rothenbucher placed first and second,
respectively, in both the three-meter and one
meter board events. "They're improving all the
time. We shouldn't have any trouble getting to
the NCAAs," diving Coach Rick Schavone said.
Next up for Stanford is a frosh dual meet at
Hayward this Friday. And in two weeks, the
Cardinal travels to Southern California to face
USC and UCLA.
