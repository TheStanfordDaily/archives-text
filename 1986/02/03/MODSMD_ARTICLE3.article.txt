# Coffee House is flourishing
## 
### MIA MANZULLI 
Fliers demanding a boycott of the for
merly student-run Coffee House flooded the
campus last quarter and cries of protest were
heard when Saga Corp. took control, but the
Coffee House has not been severely af
fected, according to employees.
During fall quarter, "Business was down
because of the boycott. Now, it's up and as
good as last winter quarter, maybe bet
ter. . . . Saga is doing a pretty good job,"
said Maria Botte, a student manager at the
Coffee House.
Four months have passed since a group of
students initiated a boycott that they hoped
would cripple Saga's business and bring
about the return of student operation.
Despite the controversy surrounding
Saga, the Coffee House appears to be thriv

ing, according to senior Mark Juretic.
"There seems to be more or less the same
people there. There is no doubt that it's dif
ferent, but it hasn't changed that much. . . .
You cannot get a table there at 11:00,"
said Juretic, adding that the Coffee House is
as busy as ever.
"It seems to be a pretty popular place.
The live entertainment on the weekends
tends to attract a lot of customers," said
Sarah Brody. a new employee at the Coffee
House.
Business has not been lacking, according
to employee Caroline Mosley. "Lunch hour
and weekend evenings are pretty crowded,
especially when they have live bands," Mos
ley said.
Following last summer's takeover by
Saga, some students were upset about Saga's

efforts to change the Coffee House atmos
phere.
One regular patron, Anne Fischer, said
many students who had gathered at the Cof
fee House last year were not going anymore.
"(Now) a lot of them are coming back. .. .
It's a great place," Fischer said.
Although the atmosphere is less casual,
the change has not been as noticeable in the
last few weeks, said Fischer, concluding that
"in many ways it's the same."
The customers are different, according to
Botte. "It's a different crowd. It is more
diverse," she said.
In response to Saga management of the
Coffee House, a group of students last quar
ter began the Espresso Bar, an alternative
coffee house in the Bechtel International
Center. However, that attempt to
take business away from the Coffee
House has not been successful, Botte
said.
The customers "want us here all
day. We have regular entertainment
that they don't have," she said.
