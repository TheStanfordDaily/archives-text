### INGRID SEYER Staff writer 
Despite a week of long, hard
workouts, the Stanford women's
swimming team had little difficulty
knocking off Arizona State 86-27
Friday afternoon. The No. 2 Card
inal (5-0), in the middle of training
for next Saturday's meet against No.
1 Texas, captured 11 of 13 events
and finished first and second in five
of them.
The only events Stanford
dropped were the one- and three
meter diving competitions.
Entering the meet, Stanford
Coach George Haines commented
that because many of the swimmers
would be tired due to the hard train
ing, he was not sure how to spec

ulate on the team s times. As it
turned out, most of the women's
times belied the earlier long work
outs.
Freshman Jenna Johnson set a
new De Guerre Pool record in the
100-yard freestyle, as she turned in
an NCAA qualifying time of 50.09.
The previous record of 50.58, set in
1984, was held by Agneta Erickson
of Texas.
Johnson, who also swam on the
victorious 400 freestyle relay team
(3:26.93), has now qualified for
four NCAA events.
The Cardinal had one double
winner in junior Susan Rapp, who
won the 400 individual medley
(4:25.78) and the 100 butterfly
(56.46) in back-to-back events.
Other winners for the Cardinal

were Stacy Shupe, Aimee Berzins,
Diana Zock, Jennifer Pokluda,
Dana Anderson and Kathy Smith.
Shupe, a sophomore, won the
1,000 freestyle ( 10:03.76) and
placed second to Anderson in the
500 freestyle (4:54.57).
Berzins captured her victory in
the 200 freestyle (1:51.31), swam
the second leg of the 400 freestyle
relay and placed second in the 100
freestyle.
Senior co-captain Diana Zock
won the 50 freestyle (24.29) and
anchored the 400 free relay. Ander
son won the 500 freestyle (4:53.98).
Pokluda clocked a time of 58.61
in the 100 backstroke to take that
event, while also swimming the first
leg of the winning 200 medley relay.

Smith, the team's other co
captain, defeated ASU's highly
touted Teri Baxter to win the 100
breaststroke with a time of 1:05.24,
.42 seconds ahead of Baxter.
In the diving competition, Leslie
Kleinheksel placed second in the
one-meter event (255.35) for Stan
ford, followed by teammate Kim
Jones (245.20).
In the three-meter event Simone
Levant earned a second-place finish
for the Cardinal (263.20), and
Jones once again placed third
(259.85).
The Cardinal will host the No. 1-
ranked Texas Longhorns this Satur
day at noon in DeGuerre. Texas,
last year's NCAA champion,
defeated Stanford last year at
Texas, 88-52.
