# Stanford tennis absent in finals
## Lots of victories but no titles for Cardinal down south 
### TOM SENF Editorial Staff 
Unlike the new engineering requirements, the
Stanford women's tennis team had a lot of breadth,
but not much depth, last weekend at the Riviera
Collegiate Invitatonal in Pacific Palisades.
Although many Stanford players advanced far
into the tournament, there wasn't a single member
of the Cardinal remaining going into today's finals
in both singles and doubles. The finals were to have
been played yesterday, but they were delayed a day
because of rain on Saturday.
Top-seeded Gretchen Rush of Trinity and No. 2
seed Caroline Kuhlman of USC will meet in the
singles final, with Rush and Ann Hubert taking on
Kuhlman and Dena Levy for the doubles title.
As expected, Patty Fendick went the furthest
among the Cardinal entrants, advancing to the
semifinals before falling to Kuhlman 6-0, 7-5.
Fendick, the No. 3 seed, was impressive on her
way to the semis, eliminating four straight oppo

nents in straight sets. She beat UCLA's Debbie
Ceccado 6-2, 6-3, then she knocked off Bettina
Wieneke of U.S. International University 6-1, 6-3.
After a 6-4, 6-1 win over San Diego State's Cyn
thia MacGregor in the third round, Fendick
eliminated teammate Kay Tittle 6-2, 6-1 in the
quarterfinals.
Tittle, who was unseeded entering the tourna
ment. upset Hubert, the eighth seed. 6-3, 7-5 in the
first round. She then beat Kristi Niles of Loyola-
Marymount 6-0, 7-5 and USC's Maeze Quinlan 2-
6, 7-5, 6-1 before losing to Fendick.
Junior Leigh Anne Eldredge was also a quarter
finalist. After a shaky 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-1 in the tie
breaker) win over Alissa Finnerman of California.
Eldredge. the sixth seed, rolled over Levi 6-2, 6-2
and Joanie Urban of UCLA 6-3, 6-4. She then
took the first set from Kuhlman before falling 1-6,
6-1, 6-3.
A pair of Stanford freshmen were able to break
into the victory column early in their collegiate
careers. Both Marianne Werdel and Eleni Rossides

won two matches before bowing out. Werdel
knocked off USC's Jinny Purdie 7-5, 6-3 and Heat
her Ettus of Cal 6-4, 6-4.
Russides eliminated both Mary Torres of Cal 6-
4, 6-2 and teammate Can Hagey 7-5, 6-1 before
losing to Rush.
Hagey defeated Susan Bryan of Texas 7-5, 6-1 in
the first round.
The Cardinal's other two entrants, Stephanie
Savides and Alyce Werdel, were beaten early.
Savides fell in the second round to No. 7 seed Karin
Shin of Cal, while Werdel lost in the first round to
Trinity's Donna Klepac 6-4, 6-4.
Stanford had two doubles teams in the semis, but
neither could advance. After losing the first set 7-6
to Rush and Hubert, the Cardinal's top team of
Fendick and Eldredge was forced to retire because
of a foot injury to Fendick.
In the other semi, Stanford suffered a
heartbreaking setback, as Savides and Hagey lost a
third-set tiebreaker to Kuhlman and Levy. The
final score was 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (7-5).
