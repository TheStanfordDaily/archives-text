# Card gymnasts settle for a split
## Men handle Berkeley after upset loss to New Mexico 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Friday night, while Stanford, Nebraska and
Minnesota kept a close eye on each other in a
five-team men's gymnastics meet at Fullerton
State, New Mexico slipped by everybody to win
the competition and shock the No. 1 Cardinal.
"We never really thought of New Mexico to be
that tough,'' Stanford Coach Sadao Hamadasaid.
"Our focus was to beat Nebraska and Minne
sota."
The Cardinal did do that, and quite convinc
ingly. After New Mexico's winning score of
277.7, it was Stanford with 276.15, the Cornhus
kerswith 273.8, the Gophers with 271.Sand host
Fullerton at 265.01.
Hamada said the Cardinal performed well, but
slipped up on one apparatus. "We really per
formed very poorly on the pommel horse." Ac
cording to Hamada, it was this single event which

decided Friday's fight for first.
"They beat us by 1.6 overall," he said. "If we
did a little better job on the horse, it would have
been much closer. I think we would have won the
meet."
Starring individually for the Cardinal at Fuller
ton was U.S. National Team member Jon Louis.
Louis won the all-around with 55.85 points, in
cluding a 9.8 on the high bar â€” Stanford's top
single-event score of the season thus far.
Louis edged New Mexico's Stuart Butler by
.05 points, although he said he did not know the
two were involved in a close duel. "I didn't even
expect to win. My purpose was to go through
with clean routines and work towards a good
team score."
Meanwhile, last year's NCAA individual all
around champion, Nebraska's Wes Suter, was
not even a factor. In fact, according to Louis, the
Cornhuskers as a whole did not really appear to
be into the meet.

"1 hey have a reputation of hitting when they
have to," he said.
Besides Louis' performance on the high bar,
Stanford also got especially tine routines out of
Mike Matzek on the floor (9.5) and Randy Be
sosa on the parallel bars (9.65). Besosa, who has
been the team's all-around leader this season, did
not go through with all six events in this meet due
to a slight case of the flu.
In Berkeley on Saturday night, Stanford went
to 10-1 on the season with a 274.4-267.9 victory
over California in a very tightly judged meet.
Besosa came back to win the all-around with
55.7 points and Matzek continued his impressive
weekend with a third place all-around finish. Be
sosa's 9.75 on the parallel bars was the competi
tion's highest score.
The team highlight of Saturday's meet was a
score of 47.8 on the high bar, which, Hamada
said, is the highest single-event team score in the
nation this year.
