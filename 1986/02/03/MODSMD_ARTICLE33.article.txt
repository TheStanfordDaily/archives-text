Spectators saw a dazzling show at
the Stanford women's gymnastics
meet against Arizona State in Maples
Pavilion Friday night.
Although ASU carried away a vic
tory with an overall team score of
181.9, Stanford was not faraway, tal
lying 175.3 overall.
"I was happy with some events, a
little disappointed with others," Stan
ford Coach Homer Sardina said.
"Overall, I think we're doing a pretty
good job. We're a young team, and
that was our first home meet."

The Cardinal was strong in the
vault and the floor exercise, but suf
fered some substantial point deduc
tions on the uneven bars. "That's an
area we'll really want to work on,"
Sardina said.
Senior co-captain Pam Blom
agreed. "On bars, no one really had it
together," she said. "But I think we
did really well on the vault. We
started off really well."
ASU provided some tough compe
tition. In the individual all-around, it
was 1985 NCAA balance beam
champion Lisa Zeis who stood out.
With top scores of 9.65 on the beam
anH Q fis in fhe floor exercise, Zeis

took the all-around title with a score
of 37.55.
Teammate Jackie Brummer was
secpnd with an overall total of 37.05.
"Those girls were lean and mean,"
Sardina said of the Sun Devil squad.
ASU now has a 5-0 record.
Particularly fine performances for
the Cardinal were turned in by fresh
men Cheryl Doo, with a personal
best overall score of 35.25, and Sheri
Evenson, with an overall total of
35.10.
Freshman Jinny Rhee, one of the
team's most talented gymnasts, suf
fered falls on the beam that, accord

ing to Sardina, "were very atypical
for her. She is nursing an ankle in
jury, however."
Sophomore Beth Pope, also one of
the team's top performers, is still suf
fering from a knee injury which oc
curred in a floor exercise competition
a few weeks ago. Whether or not she
will undergo surgery is still being
decided.
Overall, the Cardinal seemed to
feel positive about the meet. "The
team we were up against was really
tough, but we made a good start,"
Blom said. "We had lots of energy,
and I think we'll only improve."
