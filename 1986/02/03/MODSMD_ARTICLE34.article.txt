# Women hoopsters drop two in Ariz.

### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer
and Arizona Coach Wendy Larry
have a lot in common.
Both assumed the precarious task
of rebuilding losing programs this
year after coaching in the secure
confines of highly successful pro
grams last year â€” VanDerveer at
Ohio State and Larry as assistant
coach for last years NCAA cham
pion Old Dominion.
Both coach teams that are pres
ently on the road to respectability.
However, after beating the Cardinal
for the second time this season Satur
day night, 69-58, it appears as though
the Wildcats deserve a little more
respect.
- Larry's team is now 14-5 and is
currently working its way up the Pac-
West ladder at 2-2.
The loss to Arizona and the 70-58
defeat at the hands of Arizona State
on Friday increased Stanford's losing
streak to five games, while keeping
the Cardinal winless in four confer
ence matchups.
As with the final scores, the scripts
in each of the two games this
weekend were nearly identical: Stan
ford fell behind early and could not
catch up.
"One of our biggest problems is
that we've gotten down quickly,"
VanDerveer said. "I think at one
point we were down by 16 against
ASU. You just can't do that and ex
pect to win."
The early deficit had little to do
with a lack of intensity on the part of
the Cardinal.
"We came out strong," Stanford

guard Virginia Sourlis said, "but we
weren't forcing them to do what we
wanted them to do."
The Cardinal had enough trouble
doing what it wanted to do, namely,
rebound.
The Sun Devils (10-6, 3-1 in con
ference play) outrebounded the
Cardinal 45-32, while the Wildcats
enjoyed nearly the same advantage,
especially on the offensive boards.
For Stanford, forced to shoot from
the outside in the face of a 3-2
Wildcat zone, this advantage proved
especially damaging.
"It wasn't so much the 3-2 zone as
it was we weren't getting any second
or third shots," VanDerveer said.
"We'd take a decent first shot and
then that was it."
Meanwhile, Arizona, led by Card
inal nemesis Lava Acosta, didn't need
too many second shots. The Wildcats
shot a blistering 56 percent from the
floor in the first half. During this first
stanza, Acosta was perfect on seven
attempts from the Field on her way to
a game-high 26 points.
"They've won some games, so
they're playing with much more con-
Fidence than when we last played
them (a 69-68 Cardinal loss in No
vember)," VanDerveer said. And in
praise of Larry, she quipped, "I don't
know how they could have been 7-21
last year with essentially the same
players."
On a positive note: Stanford junior
Erica Mueser, according to VanDer
veer, enjoyed one of the team's best
all-around games of the season
against Arizona State. She added 10
points to her normal exceptional de
fensive effort. Jill Yanke led Stanford
with 16 points against the Sun Devils.
