Continuing to show signs of prog
ress after a three-month hibernation,
the Stanford men s golf team, with a
score of 1,119, finished seventh
among a strong field in the 54-hole
Michelob National Invitational,
which concluded Saturday in Tucson,
Ariz.
Arizona State outdueled Arkansas
to take the tournament by two
strokes, 1,096 to 1,098. Top-ranked
USC finished third at 1,101 despite
trailing Stanford with nine holes to
go.
In 10th place after the first round,
the Cardinal rose to as high as fifth by
shooting eight under par on the first
nine holes Saturday, a performance
that Stanford Coach Tim Schaaf said
was reminiscent of Stanford's victory

in the tournament it hosted last fall.
"We saw how well we could play
on the front nine," Schaaf said. "We
didn't sustain it on the back nine, but
I certainly think we can.
"(USC and Texas Christian)
played great on the back nine," he
said. "We were ahead of them at the
turn. They (USC) beat us by 18
strokes. . . . That was really some
thing."
Recording his lowest tournament
score in months, Don Walsworth led
the Cardinal with a score of 219. Carl
Wagner, Rich Marik and Brad Geer
each recorded totals of 223, under
scoring the team effort theme in Stan
ford's performance.
Continuing the golf program's
tradition of roughing it on the road,
the Cardinal next plays Feb. 12-14 at
the John Burns tourney in Oahu.
