# Cardinal ties Cal Poly
## 
### PETER CASTILLO Staff writer 
It did not look good for the Stanford wrestlers going
into Saturday's dual meet against Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo, primarily due to neck injuries to Jeff Bradley
(134 pounds) and Neil Wartnik (126 pounds) that
forced them out of the lineup.
The other wrestlers, however, responded with in
spired performances as the Cardinal tied the Mustangs
26-26, Stanford's best performance ever against San
Luis Obispo.
San Luis Obispo spotted Stanford six points by for
feiting at 118 pounds, but it soon regained those when
Ernie Geronimo (126 pounds) pinned Dave Bishko.
And the Mustangs took a 12-6 lead when Wayne Nis
hiura (134 pounds) registered a technical fall, 17-1,
against Sam Sunshine.
In a very physical match, Stanford's Mark Alex (142
pounds) dominated Gheith Effarah 15-0 to score a
technical fall. Alex, having dropped a weight class, was
credited by Stanford Coach Chris Horpel for doing the
extra work needed to make himself a better wrestler.
Stanford's Jeff Hazard (150 pounds) overcame an 8-
2 first-period deficit to tie Malcolm Boykin 10-10 at

the end of two periods. The match came down to the
last 30 seconds, when Boykin scored a reversal and a
two-point near fall for a 14-13 lead. Hazard came back
with a reversal, but in the final seconds Boykin
returned the favor with another reversal to win 16-15.
Pete Rogers (158 pounds) gave Stanford a 17-15
lead by soundly defeating Lance Cowart 14-2. The
Mustangs regained the lead 20-17 as Anthony Romero
defeated Eric Harber, 21-9.
In a tactical move, San Luis Obispo Coach Lennis
Cowell forfeited Mark Tracy, ranked fourth in the na
tion at 177 pounds, due to a shoulder injury.
Horpel did not know about the forfeit until it was
time for Tracy to wrestle Dave Lee, ranked 10th at 167
pounds, because he saw Tracy pin his San Jose State
opponent Friday night. The reason that Cowell waited
was to prevent Horpel from switching Lee and Harber.
At 190 pounds, San Luis Obispo's David Lenham
pinned Terry Mclntyre.
The Mustangs held a 26-23 lead going into the
heavyweight match between Stanford's Kurt Kassulke
and Ben Lizama. Lizama, at 250 pounds, had a 50-
pound advantage over Kassulke. However, Kassulke
was able to use his quickness to pull out a 10-10 vic
tory, giving Stanford the tie.
