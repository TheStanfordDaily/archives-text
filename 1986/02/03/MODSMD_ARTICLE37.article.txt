Demonstations declared in Haiti
ST. MARC, Haiti — Following a rough wooden casket held aloft by
two young men, a procession of anti-government demonstrators yester
day chanted and danced down St. Marc's main street to a lively calypso
drumbeat.
Hand lettering on the casket said "Jean-Claude, you're place is in
here." When the casket-bearers broke into a spirited jig, the crowd
whooped and cheered. The procession was part of a weeklong wave of
protest demonstrations against the authoritarian government of Presi
dent Jean-Claude Duvalier.
At least 20 people have been killed around Haiti during eight days of
disturbances and riots that have produced the most serious threat to the
stability of the government of this impoverished Caribbean country since
Duvalier became president in 1971.
Duvalier imposed an official state of siege Friday amid widespread but
false rumors that he had fled the country. The demonstrations have con
tinued.
Authorities declared a curfew from 7:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. Yesterday in
the northern coastal city of Cap Haitien, apparently to keep people from
congregating at churches. Cap Haitien, where eight people have been
killed, is the nation's second-largest city.
The government also issued an order prohibiting foreign journalists
from traveling to the provinces without official permission. Two Ameri
can television crews were detained for five hours after they tried to drive
out of Port-au-Prince.
Mobs in St. Marc, a shabby port city of 25,000 about 60 miles north of
Port-au-Prince, have burned the houses of some government officials
and sacked warehouses, carrying away food, medicine and building ma
terials.
Shcharansky may be freed in swap
BONN, West Germany — Soviet Jewish dissident Anatoly
Shcharansky and an unspecified number of imprisoned Western agents
will be swapped for 12 East Bloc spies being held in the West in the big
gest such exchange since World War 11, the mass-circulation Bild news
paper reported today.
Bonn government spokesman Juergen Findeisen declined to comment
on the report. Officials of the U.S. Embassy here and the U.S. mission in
West Berlin were not available for comment.
West German officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, dismissed
the report. They said no spy swap negotiations were being held.
In its report, Bild cited "high Soviet sources" as the basis for its report
and said that the exchange will take place in the next few days, probably
at the Glienicke Bridge, which crosses into East Germany from south
western West Berlin and which has been the locale for previous spy
swaps.
According to the Bild report, Washington and Bonn wanted dissident
physicist Andrei Sakharov, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate living in inter
nal exile in Gorky, to be included in the exchange, but the Soviets
refused.
Costa Rican election shows hostility
SAN JOSE, Costa Rica — This Central American nation voted noisily
for its president yesterday, ending a long electoral campaign that
reflected this country's growing hostility toward Marxist-led Nicaragua.
Altogether, an estimated $1 million Costa Ricans cast ballots to
choose among six presidential candidates on the ballot. However, only
two of the candidates were considered serious contenders: Oscar Arias
from the National Liberation Party and rival Rafael Angel Calderon of
the Social Christian Unity Party.
The winner will replace Luis Alberto Monge, a National Liberation
leader who is finishing a four-year term and could not legally be a candi
date to succeed himself. Seats in the Legislative Assembly and city hall
posts were also at stake.
Of the two leading candidates, Arias, 44, picked up strength in recent
weeks, observers said, mainly by overcoming intraparty squabbles and
emphasizing peace with Costa Rica's neighbors.
Calderon, 36. was more bellicose toward the Sandinista government
of neighboring Nicaragua. That stance, along with his offer of more clear
cut changes in domestic policies, may have unnerved Costa Rica's
middle-of-the road voters.
Oil producers set off price war
KUWAIT — Long threatened by potential spillover from the Iranian-
Iraqi conflict, Arab petroleum producers of the Persian Gulf have set off
a price war of their own in a desperate gamble to discipline an increas
ingly chaotic international crude oil market.
Directed by Saudi Arabia, the other gulf producers — Kuwait, the
United Arab Emirates and Qatar — have abandoned their traditional
avoidance of confrontation to swamp an already glutted international oil
market with the world's most inexpensive-to-pump crude.
With the boom years of the 1970s now a receding memory. Saudi
Arabia felt constrained to act by such ugly reminders of financial ill
health as last year's $24 billion government budget deficit.
With belt-tightening visible in the 3 1 percent drop in Saudi imports in
the first half of 1985 and mountains of unpaid bills, the royal family em
barked reluctantly on the price war to provide money to keep the lid on.
To varying degrees throughout the gulf, Arab producers and their
citizens have come to accept as conventional wisdom that demand —
and a return to anything like the old price level — may not recover until
the mid-'9os.

Brazil acts to halt price increases
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil — Brazil's finance minister, reacting to a
record monthly increase of 16.2 percent in the cost of living, has adopted
drastic measures to halt the inflationary issuance of new money.
The rise in the official consumer price index for Januaiy pushed
Brazil's annual rate of inflation to 238 percent. An earlier official esti
mate of the January inflation rate, put out recently by the Brazilian In
stitute of Statistics, indicated that it would be only 15.7 percent.
The government's first reaction to the January inflation figures was to
freeze the prices of rice, beans, bread and beef. Then President Jose Sar
ney refused to transfer scheduled payments to Brazilian states and cities.
Rising inflation in Brazil has been worrying foreign creditors and has
delayed refinancing of the country's $100 billion foreign debt, the
world's largest.
Nobel laureate Alva Myrdal dies
Alva Myrdal. 84. who won a 1982 Nobel Peace Prize for her tireless
efforts as an advocate of world disarmament, and who also was a learned
and compassionate voice in the fields of education, women's rights and
social welfare, died Saturday in a hospital in suburban Stockholm.
She was the wife of Gunnar Myrdal, a co-winner of the 1974 Nobel
Memorial Prize in Economic Science. They were married in 1924.
Over the years, Myrdal had served at the United Nations, was
Sweden's ambassador to India, had served as a Social Democrat in the
Swedish parliament, and as minister of disarmement and church affairs
in the Swedish cabinet. As a teacher and writer, she had a profound in
fluence on the debate surrounding her country's pioneering efforts in so
cial welfare.
The citation for her Nobel Prize, which she shared with Mexican
diplomat Alfonso Garcia Robles. said that she had opened the eyes of
the world to the threat of the arms race. Her other awards included the
first Albert Einstein Peace Prize in 1980.
