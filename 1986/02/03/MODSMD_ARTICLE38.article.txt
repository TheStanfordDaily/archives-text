# Power struggle in S. Yemen

ADEN, South Yemen — A government headed
by hard-line Marxist Haidar Abu Bakr Attas ap
peared firmly in control of this Arabian Peninsula
country yesterday after the defeat of former Presi
dent Ali Nasser Mohammed, who reportedly tried
to eliminate his political rivals last month in a pre
emptive wave of assassinations at a specially
summoned meeting of the Politburo.
In an acknowledged effort to portray
Mohammed as the architect of a brutal wave of po
litical killings, government officials yesterday took
visiting Western journalists on a tightly controlled
tour of sites where Mohammed's bodyguards al
legedly machine-gunned his rivals after
Mohammed had called them to a Politburo meeting
and then left town to await the outcome.
The most gruesome sight was the bullet-riddled
Politburo conference room, still blood-soaked and
reeking of death — and left untouched as a grisly
monument to the slain leaders.
Mohammed, who reportedly was at his home in
Abyan Province, 50 miles east of Aden, at the time
of the slayings, was said to have since fled South
Yemen.
Attas, who was prime minister in Mohammed's

faction-ridden government, was abroad when the
fighting broke out and went promptly to Moscow.
He returned here Jan. 25 and has taken over as
provisional president of the country, which, under a
succession of leaders, has remained a staunch So
viet ally for the past 17 years.
Aden's seaport, from which thousands of foreig
ners were evacuated under fire last month, is open
again, and the international airport reopened
briefly late Saturday night as the only surviving jet
liner of South Yemen's national airline made a
blacked-out landing to evade a possible missile at
tack.
Although there are signs that widespread fight
ing occurred throughout Aden, the damage does
not nearly match the descriptions given by Western
diplomats after they tied the capital two weeks ago.
Casualty figures were said by Yemeni officials to be
only a fraction of the 10,000 reported dead during
the first days of the street battles.
The Politburo slayings were accompanied by a
wave of political assassinations in Aden in which,
officials said, at least 50 high-ranking party figures
died.

According to government officials, Mohammed
called for a meeting of the 11-member Politburo at
10 a.m. on Jan. 13, and then two hours before its
scheduled start he left for his home province,
leaving his Mercedes and a contingent of his per
sonal bodyguards at the secretariat.
Four Mohammed allies on the Politburo also
failed to show up at the meeting. But six other un
suspecting members, all critics of the president,
gathered at the long, U-shaped conference table,
drinking tea and chatting among themselves as they
waited for their president, according to government
officials and witnesses who were in the compound.
While the Politburo members waited, one of the
president's bodyguards, named Hassan, entered
and put Mohammed's briefcase by his seat at the
head of the conference table, Hubaishi said.
A few minutes later, he said, Hassan returned,
aimed a sub-machine gun at Antar and emptied the
magazine of 40 rounds. Simultaneously, gunfights
broke out in a corridor between Mohammed's
bodyguards and secretariat guards as Qassim drew
a revolver and killed Hassan before dying himself,
along with Hadi.
