# Cause of explosion theorized
## 
### 
When the space shuttle Challenger
exploded 73 seconds after liftoff last
Tuesday, the proximate cause was a
massive malfunction of one of the two
solid rockets designed to boost the
shuttle to an altitude where its own
engines can complete the task of lif
ting it into orbit.
That is the conclusion that is widely
being drawn from both the initial
videotapes of the explosion and the
new film released by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administra
tion (NASA) Saturday evening. Both
clearly show flames surrounding the
booster at locations where flames
should not be.
Those flames somehow triggered
an explosion of the massive external
fuel tank that carried the liquid hy
drogen and liquid oxygen for the or
biters own engines. That explosion
destroyed Challenger, killing its
seven crew members.
The ultimate cause of the disaster
lies elsewhere, however, somewhere
along the path by which a few tons of
metal were slowly converted into the
largest solid-fuel rocket flown by
man. Precisely where the fault oc
curred may not be known for quite
some time, as William Graham, act
ing NASA administrator, suggested

yesterday.
The solid rocket boosters (SRBs)
are an outgrowth of the rockets
originally designed for the

Minuteman and Poseidon C 3
missiles. NASA chose the solid fuel
technology for its shuttle boosters,
because it was thought they would be

much safer than liquid fuel rockets.
The initial stages of manufacture of
the SRBs take place at the Thiokol
Chemical Corp. division of Morton
Thiokol Corp. at its plant in Bing
ham, Utah.
The Challenger explosion occurred
during that part of the flight, about
one minute after liftoff, when the
craft is undergoing the maximum
physical stress caused by the combi
nation of the thrust from the engines
and the resistance from dense air near
the earth's surface. If, in fact, the
SRBs were vibrating much more than
normal, all components of the
propulsion system would have been
subjected to unanticipated — and
potentially lethal — stress.
Presumably as a result of that
stress, at approximately 58.32
seconds after liftoff — according to
the pictures released by NASA Satur
day — a small hole appeared in the
side of Challenger's right-hand SRB
from which flames emerged. The
flames seemed to be near the area
where two segments had been joined
together at Kennedy, but it is not
clear if the rupture was at the fill
joint seam or simply close to it, as
Graham pointed out.
