## 
### KELLY SUND Staff writer 
Nathan Selden, a senior majoring
in human biology, has been named
Stanford's 26th recipient of the Mar
shall Scholarship for study in Great
Britain.
Selden, who said he was "just ec
static" and "a little surprised" at re
ceiving the award, plans to do
graduate work at the University of
London with the possible goal of a
master s degree in biological anthro
pology.
Established in 1953 by the British

government, the scholarship com
memorates the U.S. Marshall plan,
which sent financial and material aid
to European countries after World
War 11.
The scholarship provides two
years of tuition, room, hoard, fees
and books at any British university, as
well as two round-trip air fares and a
personal stipend.
The application process consists of
a detailed application, an initial
screening by a panel at the applicant's
college and an interview for regional
finalists. Out of 800 applicants
nominated by their colleges, 30 were
selected to receive the scholarship.
Selden commented that the appli
cation process "made applying to
med school look like fun."
While at Stanford, Selden has
served as a student adviser for the
human biology program, on the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies, as
president of the Phi Kappa Psi frater
nity, as a KZSU disc jockey and as
resident assistant at Grove-Lasuen
House.
Selden said he thought his partici
pation in several competitive summer
grant research internships was in
strumental in his selection.
Upon his return from Great Brit
ain, Selden plans to attend medical

school. He then hopes to practice in
ternal medicine and become involved
in the ethical and public policy
aspects of medicine.
