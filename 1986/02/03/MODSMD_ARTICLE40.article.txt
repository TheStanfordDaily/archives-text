Soviet proposal opposed
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administra
tion is opposed to the comprehensive test ban
proposed by the Soviets because the National
Weapons Laboratories have designed nuclear
bombs of such fragile sophistic tion that they
must be constantly tested, according to a Depart
ment of Defense official.
Frank Gaffney, deputy assistant secretary of
defense for nuclear forces and arms control
policy, asserted that the designers of the United
States' current nuclear arsenal "did not empha
size aspects of warhead design which would en
hance weapon endurance in a no-test environ
ment."
Defense hike expected
WASHINGTON — President Reagan's fiscal
1987 budget is expected to propose Defense De
partment spending increases of nearly 40 percent
over five years, plus a hefty boost for the space
program. But most civilian agencies would be cut
substantially or frozen in place, according to
budget documents obtained by The Washington
Post yesterday.

The documents confirm that Reagan, when he
presents his budget proposals tomorrow, will in
sist on a continuous military buildup over the
next five years while tightening the noose around
civilian programs, except for Social Security and
a few select others.
The documents did not spell out which pro
grams within a department would be cut, but
reports have circulated that the president would
seek major reductions in some Medicare pay
ments in an effort to slow the program's growth,
cuts in medical research, cuts in Amtrak and
various housing and loan and community aid pro
grams.
Missile to be developed
WASHINGTON — Despite questions about
the Midgetman missile's ability to survive Soviet
defenses and mandatory budget cuts, the Pent
agon is planning to begin full-scale development
of the weapon next year and will seek a 300 per
cent increase in its funding over the next two
years, a senior Pentagon official said yesterday.
The Pentagon's plans, contained in budget and
other documents that Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger will make public this week,

advance the expected recommendations of a
Pentagon advisory panel and would keep work
on the weapon on schedule for an initial deploy
ment in December 1992.
U.S. redeploys carriers
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administra
tion plans to resume its war of nerves against
Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy by sending the
aircraft carriers USS Coral Sea and USS Saratoga
back to the Gulf of Sidra area next week, admin
istration officials said yesterday.
In his State of the Union address tomorrow
night, President Reagan may spotlight that he is
turning up the heat by declaring the United
States has no intention of recognizing Khadafy's
claim that the entire gulf falls within Libyan
waters.
Such language was put in at least one draft of
the president's speech, officials said. But no mat
ter whether Reagan mentions il in his speech, the
policy decision to send the carriers closer to
Libya has been made, the officials said, setting
the stage for some highly visible gunboat
diplomacy.
