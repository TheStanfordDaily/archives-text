Oil spill investigated
SAN FRANCISCO — The U.S. Coast Guard
reported yesterday it may have traced the source
of some of the oil that spilled into the three dif
ferent Pacific Ocean slicks and hurt more than
300 birds.
An investigator from the Coast Guard's
marine safety office flew over the sight of a spill
discovered Saturday about 13 miles west of Point
Ano Nuevo, about 25 miles south of San Fran
cisco, said Lt. J.G. Patrick Trapp.
One of the new spills was in a small, globule
covered area near Pescadero Point, about 20
miles south of San Francisco, according to Trapp.
The second covered a diameter of approximately
200 yards near a sea buoy slightly more than
eight miles west of the Golden Gate Bridge, he
said.
"The marine safety office feels they have a
lead on a ship that was allowed to go out at that
general time," said Trapp in reference to the time
the spill was reported.
Quarter-sized globs of oil were reported was
hing up on beaches from Marin Beach to Ocean

Beach in San Francisco yesterday, and rescue
workers helped retrieve oil-coated birds from
Linda Mar to Monterey Bay, officials said.
Security found lax
SAN DIEGO — General Dynamics' Convair
division, which makes the Cruise Missile, vowed
yesterday to beef up security and take discipli
nary action against any laxity after a federal audit
rated its security unsatisfactory.
However, company spokesman Jack Isabel
denied a New York Times report yesterday that
Convair had lost its security clearance.
According to the Times, which said it obtained
confidential company memos, McSweeny said
the unsatisfactory rating came as a result of mis
sing classified documents, inadequate efforts to
find them, failure to report missing documents
and failure to control classified hardware.
The memo said the loss of security clearance
would mean no new contracts could be awarded
to Convair and that requests for individual
clearances would not be processed, the Times

said. But the company apparently could continue
to work on existing contracts, the paper said.
S.F. gains new convent
SAN FRANCISCO — The Society of the Mis
sionaries of Charity, the order of famous Calcutta
nun Mother Teresa, has instituted its first North
American noviate with 42 novices here, a San
Francisco newspaper reported yesterday.
The sisters, who wear white saris instead of
nuns' habits or more modern apparel preferred
by some in other church orders, have attracted
attention in the Valencia Street neighborhood
where they have quietly opened up a soup
kitchen and women's shelter in a three-story,
Tudor-style building, said the San Francisco Ex
aminer.
