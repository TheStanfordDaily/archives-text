# Kaplan says ASSU slanted his report
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Law Prof. John Kaplan last week charged an
ASSU investigative committee with making
"flat factual misstatements" in its criticism of
his report regarding alleged police brutality at
Stanford last October.
The student/faculty committee, which is plan
ning a separate investigation of the matter, had
issued a report on Jan. 15 complaining that
Kaplan's investigation — conducted at the re
quest of University President Donald Kennedy
— reveals "complete faith in the statements of
police officers and mistrust of student tes
timony."
In a Jan. 23 letter to the committee, Kaplan
refuted the charges, stating that the inves
tigative body distorted his views with
"misstatements (that) can only be deliberate."
"My point is not that I have been charged
with bias. That is a question of opinion and can
easily be charged of anyone with whom one dis
agrees," Kaplan told ASSU senators in his let
ter. "My charge is more simple and serious. It is
that your committee report is full of flat mis
statements which distort what my report does
say."
Kaplan said yesterday that he was "stunned"
at the committee's charges.
"If [the Senate committee] shows no more in
tegrity than this, then they shouldn't be trusted
with anything," Kaplan said.
Commenting on earlier statements made by

faculty committee member Dow Woodward
that the group was "simply interpreting the
Kaplan report in the way in which we read it,"
Kaplan said that he "didn't know which is the
more clear intention: that Woodward did read
the report that way, or that he knew better."
Woodward, a biology professor, said last
night his belief in Kaplan's bias remains un
changed.
"The committee's report, overall, was indica
ting that . . . student opinion was not taken
seriously (in Kaplan's report). I think his letter
to the committee said the same thing."
Kaplan emphasized that his complaint lay not
with the committee's accusations of bias but
with what he feels are strong inaccuracies in its
analysis of his report. His letter lists several spe
cific examples taken from the committee's
report, including an instance where he is
charged with "dismissing" the evidence of
senior Robby Perkins, who was allegedly
mistreated at the hands of Stanford and Santa
Clara County police. According to Kaplan, his
report quotes Stanford Police Sgt. Nick Brunot
dismissing Perkins' statements.
"There is no point where I disbelieve student
testimony," Kaplan said.
Kaplan also criticized Woodward's attack on
the absence of proposed disciplinary action in
his report.
"If the purpose of the committee is to recom
mend disciplinary action for (Stanford) police
based on what I found, then [the
committee] should be called 'The
Committee to Get (Stanford Police
Chief) Marvin Herrington,' " Kaplan
said.
Student committee member Carey
White said last night, however, that
the issue of bias was of secondary im
portance with regard to the planned
investigation.
"We recognize that Prof. Kaplan is
extremely qualified," said White,
chair of the ASSU Senate. "But
there's only one of him. The idea is to
have more than one opinion. That's
what the true criticism of the Kaplan
report was meant to be."
Organization of the review com
mission was approved last month by
the ASSU Senate.
