# 200 layoffs planned in Hospital cutback

### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
Approximately 200 Stanford Hospital
workers will be laid off in an effort to save $25
million in the 1986-1987 fiscal year, the hospi
tal's director of finance announced Thursday.
"Well over 200 â€” a substantial number" of
employees will be laid off so the hospital can
"remain financially strong," according to David
Sakai.
The announcement came two days after
hospital officials sent letters to employees re
vealing a $25 million cut from a $210 million
operating budget by April 1. Officials had not
stated at that time how many employees they
would lay off.
The budget cut is the hospital's response to
declining income due to shorter patient hospital
stays, falling demand for in-patient care and
cutbacks in federal funding because of the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill, which calls for
cuts to balance the federal budget, according to
hospital officials.
The cuts were necessary to make the hospital
competitive in prices and services, according to
Spyros Andreopoulos, director of the Medical
Center News Bureau.
In the last four years, the average length of a
patient's stay at Stanford Hospital dropped
from 6.8 to 6.3 days, and the total number of
days spent in the hospital by all hospital patients
went from 156,654 to 140,552.
The hospital cannot afford to raise prices, ac
cording to Hospital President Sheldon King.

The hospital's prices are comparable to those
of the hospital at UC-San Francisco, which is
often compared with the Stanford Hospital.
With an average daily charge of $1,498 per pa
tient, Stanford Hospital is considered the most
expensive in Santa Clara County. Santa Clara
Valley Medical Center charges $1,251, while
community and tax-supported district hospitals
cost $ 1,000 or less.
"Because we are a teaching hospital, there
will always be a cost differential, but it has to be
seen by both patients and insurers as reasonable
and worth the cost," King said.
The cuts will not affect the hospital's $114
million modernization plan, scheduled to be
completed in 1987.
In deciding where to make cuts, hospital offi
cials considered several options, according to
King.
"Despite the social value of some of these ap
proaches, we agreed we'd merely postponed the
inevitible.... As a philosophy for the institu
tion, it's our responsibility to make sure that
those individuals who still have a place at Stan
ford Hospital after the reductions take place are
here as full participants and not penalized by
uncertainty," King said.
"When you postpone decisions of this sort for
too long, it means also that you are making cuts
in an unplanned way and often sacrificing
services that are important," he added.
The 663-bed hospital employs 4,239 people,
including part-time workers. About 1,000
physicians also work at the hospital but will not
be affected by lay-offs.
