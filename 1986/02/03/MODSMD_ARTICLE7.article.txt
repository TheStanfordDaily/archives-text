# Graduate tuition tax credits end
## 
### KEITH SEINFELD Staff writer 
Approximately 700 Stanford
graduate students should be
prepared to pay at least $84 each in
additional taxes on every paycheck,

Education Watch

an official in the University's ac
counting office told a forum at the
Law School last week.
"We need to make some prudent
plans, since the law is in effect and it
presumably will remain in effect,"
Chris Canelles said to the gathering.
Iris Brest of the University's legal
office said that "the question is not

really 'why are they suddenly
taxed," but 'why weren't they previ
ously taxed?'" She explained that
the provision which had exempted
many graduate students from
paying taxes on tuition credits
"expired at the end of 1985 and was
not renewed (as has become the
tradition) by Congress."
The bulk of those affected are
master's candidates in all depart
ments and School of Engineering
graduate students, Associate Dean
of Graduate Studies Karlene
Dickey said. The expired provision
had applied to tuition credits from
any research assistantships and
teaching assistantships which are
not required as part of the degree.

The University has plans to begin
withholding taxes on the value of
these tuition credits beginning
spring quarter.
"The tax law requires withhold
ing tax due as you go along ....
There is a penalty if this is not done
properly," Canelles said."Stanford
is required by the IRS to declare the
tuition and to withhold taxes for the
moment."
Jacyn Mitchell, of the Public Af
fairs Office, told the crowd that she
believes "the issue will be consid
ered again soon, probably as part of
a larger package of provisions . ..
and if it is extended, it will probably
be made retroactive. The University
is working with a variety of groups

towards getting some changes
made." She added that letters from
individual constituents often have
much greater effect on legislators.
The University has no plans to
compensate the affected graduates
through raises, Dean of Graduate
Studies Elizabeth Traugott said.
Traugott said that since the law af
fects each individual differently, and
the University cannot consider the
external demands on every student
when setting wages or credits, there
would be serious equity questions
with compensating for certain taxes.
If the exemptions are not reinstated,
accomodations possibly could be
made next fall by changing degree
requirements.
