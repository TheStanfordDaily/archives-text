# Study says microcomputers may help people lose weight

### KRISTEN BROWN 
The fight against obesity may
have acquired a new weapon — the
microcomputer.
In a recent Stanford study, six
overweight patients equipped with
a microcomputer system lost about
2.5 times as much weight as six
patients in the control group who
relied on self-monitoring, accord
ing to Drs. C. Barr Taylor and W.
Stewart Agras of the Laboratory
for the Study of Behavioral
Medicine at the Medical Center.
The volunteers in the experimen
tal group, who were about 35 per
cent overweight, sported battery
operated computers that were small
enough to be carried all day in a
pouch slung over the shoulder.
While remaining cautious about
the results because of the small
number of subjects involved,
Taylor and Agras are hopeful that
the study may have important im
plications for the treatment of
obesity and other health problems.

A contemporary direction of be
havioral medicine emphasizes in
dividualized programs to change
health care behavior. and
computer-assisted therapy may
open new avenues for research in
behavioral medicine, according to
Taylor.
"The ambulatory computer's that
give immediate feedback allow
people to set defined goals," said
Taylor, adding that microcomputer
therapy has the potential to in
dividualize behavior change with a
relatively low-cost tool.
"We call the [program] a self
monitoring control. The computer
gives [patients] immediate feed
back about what they are doing and
reinforcement. ... If you give
people immediate feedback it's
much easier to change their behav
ior," Taylor said.
Subjects entered codes into the
computer for the foods they were
about to eat, and the computer cal
culated total calories for meals and

snacks. It would then relate to the
patients the percentage of their
daily intake goal that was used and
the permitted remaining caloric
intake.
If their self control was within
limits, the computer would praise
subjects with the message:
"Fantastic, you are doing well."
If the data indicated that caloric
intake had exceeded daily limits,
the computer instructed patients to
stop eating and recommended al
ternative behaviors.
The patients also recorded physi
cal activity and compared it to daily
exercise goals.
In the control group, volunteers
entered similar codes for self
monitoring, but they recorded the
data in hand-written form.
While the computer-assisted vol
unteers could quickly analyze their
code values in their portable com
puters, the members of the control
group had to tally these values by
hand.
