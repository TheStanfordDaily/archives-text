### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff With wire reports 
President Reagan yesterday named Applied Physics
Prof. Arthur Walker, Jr. to serve on a 12-member com
mission which will examine the cause of last week's explo
sion of the space shuttle Columbia.
Walker, a specialist in solar astronomy, said he was con
tacted from the White House Sunday by William Graham,
acting administrator for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA), and asked to serve on the
committee.
Walker said he was "honored" by his selection and
"pleased to be able to be helpful at this point in time."
The independent commission is scheduled to replace an
interim NASA body formed immediately after last Tues
day's accident. Members were instructed to report within
120 days to begin reviewing results of other studies and
preparing a report for Reagan.
Graham said the committee will attempt to find the
source of the malfunction that led to the explosion and
prevent a recurrence.
"We don't look like we're going to have to go back to
the design process and envision re-configuring the system
or making a very fundamental design changes. What we're
looking at here is a question of making sure the difficulty
that occurred is corrected. . . and will never happen
again," Graham said.
In announcing the committee, Reagan stated, "We owe
it to [the seven astronauts killed in the explosion] to con
duct this investigation so that future space travelers can
approach the conquest of space with confidence and
America can go forward with enthusiasm and optimism
which has sparked and marked all of our great undertak
ings."
The commission will review NASA information but can
also seek data elsewhere, according to former Secretary of
State William Rogers, the committee's chairman.
Walker said that he had not yet received information on
when or where the committee will begin meeting but
added that it is scheduled to give a report to Reagan in
four months.
He said that it is premature to speculate on the possibil
ity of finding the source of the explosion.
Walker said he has been involved in several past space
experiments and NASA committees, including a group of
scientists that advised NASa\ on the construction of a
space station and one that advised NASA on the priorities
for space exploration. He has also served as an adviser to
the Air Force on techniques for development of a
satellite-based nuclear explosion detection system and
other satellite problems.
Besides Walker and Rogers, the panel will include: Neil
Armstrong, commander of Apollo 11; Chuck Yeager,
retired Air Force brigadier general; and Sally Ride, a mis
sion specialist on the June 1983 voyage of the Challenger
and the first woman in space.
