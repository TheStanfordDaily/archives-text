# Speaker says peace has dim future in Colombia

### CHRIS SAUCEDO 
Peace between the Colombian government and
guerrilla groups appears unlikely in the near future, a
native Colombian studying here said yesterday.
In a speech at Bechtel International Center, Felipe
Jamarillo, a doctoral candidate at the Food Research
Institute, said his country has been plagued by war
since the 19405, and the formation of the national gov
ernment in 1958 has helped little. The formation of the
national government in 1958 was the result of 20 years
of civil war between liberal and conservative factions.
According to Jamarillo, guerrillas appeared after the
formation of the national government because the gov
ernment failed to fufill the peoples' needs. He listed
poverty, social injustice and land concentration as
some of the reasons for the ongoing civil unrest.
Jamarillo said the only recent efforts to reconcile the
guerrillas with the government occurred in 1982, when
President Belisario Betancur began talking to guerrilla
groups and invited them to form legitimate political
parties and run in the upcoming elections.
He believes the prospects for guerrilla groups to ob
tain real political clout are "pessimistic" because they
lack voter support. Even the largest guerrilla group,
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, will be
hard-pressed to find political support, he said.

According to Jamarillo, some guerrilla groups have
already withdrawn their support of Betancur's peace
efforts and returned to their old ways. In particular, he
cited the April 19 Movement, or M-19, which was re
sponsible for the November takeover of the Colom
bian Palace of Justice in Bogota. That attack left nearly
100 dead, including several members of the country's
supreme court.
Jamarillo predicted that Betancur's peace efforts
have weakened his popularity enough to prevent any
possibility that he will seek re-election. He said Betan
cur's peace initiatives faced difficulties from the start,
especially a lack of support among the country's politi
cal leaders.
"The peace process has been attacked by both
sides," Jamarillo said. "Guerrillas label those who join
Betancur as sellouts, and the structural reforms are
blocked in Congress, especially land reform." The
guerrillas want land and political recognition that the
established groups are loath to give, and neither group
trusts the other, he said.
Jamarillo said he believes Betancur's peace in
itiatives will be tested in this year's election. If people
vote for a candidate who will follow Betancur's lead,
then the mandate will be to attempt to reconcile the
two groups; otherwise fighting will resume.
