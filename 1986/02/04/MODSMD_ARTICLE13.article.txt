## An Independent Newspaper Racist charges are false 
### 
The ASSU constitution that was recently proposed
and rejected has been labeled as racist by minority
groups on campus. Any charges of racism must be
treated with the utmost seriousness and objectively
evaluated in order to determine if such an assessment
is merited. In this case, the evidence clearly indicates
that allegations of racisism are simply unjustified.
Racist in intent? The individuals who wrote the pro
posed constitution have proved beyond the shadow of
a doubt that they are committed to eradicating racism.
The ASSU has successfully proposed a referendum to
divest its funds from companies doing business in
South Africa and has established a committee to fur
ther investigate the charges of police misconduct on
campus. Indeed, three Council of Presidents (COP)
members were arrested for participating in a demon
stration protesting apartheid and racist police brutality
and all three have fully accepted the scholastic and le
gal consequences of their participation. Above all, they
graced the proposed constitution with the written phil
osophy, "Love one another."
Racist in effect? Good intentions are admittedly
never enough, but the effect of the constitution would
not have been racist. The constitution would have
eliminated bureaucratic slowdowns by cutting down on
the excessive number of ASSU members and cutting
out the cumbersome bylaws. It would not have created
the risk of centralized control: the legislative branch
would have been able to override any veto of the
three-member COP.
The changes would not have precluded minorities
from obtaining funding for their organizations or from
beinp elected to the ASSU. New bylaws could have

provided for a fair and efficient Program Board and for
equitable elections of graduate representatives. One
COP member stated that those asserting that the pro
posed constitution was racist in effect were "labeling
this campus as racist and not crediting it the intelli
gence to vote for the best candidates."
Are Stanford students racist? There is substantial
evidence to the contrary. We need only to cite the ex
amples of Stanford students' actions: the significant
and sustained representation in the Peace Corps, the
continued efforts against apartheid, the successful or
ganization of last year's "You Can Make a Difference"
campaign to demonstrate concern for Ethiopian
famine victims, the participation in volunteer groups
like the Reach Out Today activities in East Palo Alto
last weekend, and the fact that the majority of students
voted for ASSU divestment. In fact, elected minorities
have formerly been statistically "over-represented" in
the ASSU. In 1983, minorities constituted 50 percent
of the undergraduate senators and alternates elected.
Everyone, minorities included, knew that the COP
intended to revamp the ASSU. The COP ran on the
platform of abolishing the senate. The proposed con
stitution was not written surreptitiously — many con
tributed to it. Minority groups had adequate opportu
nity to offer their input. Whether the writers should
have actively consulted minority groups is question
able. The fact remains that the majority (62.2 percent)
of students are dissatisfied with the current constitu
tion. Efforts to replace the constitution should
therefore continue, and any charges of racism should
be justified or dropped.
