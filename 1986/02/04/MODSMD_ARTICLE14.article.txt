SOSA records
lack organization
We would like to clarify a few
points made in The Daily article of
Jan. 31 entitled "ASSU freezes
SOSA allocation for misuse of fund
ing." These are:
• The Program Board did not freeze
30 student organization accounts.
Rather, they were frozen by the Of
fice of the Financial Manager because
the groups had not filed the quarterly
financial statements in accordance
with the "ASSU Funding Agree
ment." The Program Board did
freeze the accounts of Stanford Out
of South Africa (SOSA) and the
Debate Club, pending investigation
of misused funds. The Program
Board and Office of the Financial
Manager acted independently in this
case.
• Out of the approximately $16 col
lected from each student on the per
mit to register (PTR), only $4 goes to
the Program Board to be eventually
allocated to groups like SOSA.
• Contrary to what the SOSA Trea
surer has said, the Board did not
"misplace" SOSA's forms "about
four times last quarter." In fact,
SOSA did not file the required docu
ments in the Office of the Financial
Manager until last week. The Pro
gram Board is not involved in this
process.
• SOSA requested and received stu
dent funds from the Program Board
specifically for "Rallies, Debates,
Forums, and Speakers." Expenses on
black balloons, a newspaper and a

band were certainly not authorized by
the representatives of the student
body, the ASSU Senate.
•In a funding agreement signed on
Oct. 7, 1985, SOSA specifically
agreed to: comply fully with all terms
of its funding allocation; spend all
funds, regardless of the source, in ac
cordance with the approved budget;
gain ASSU approval in advance for
any changes in the budget; and not
spend any funds on unauthorized ex
penses.
SOSA also agreed that if the above
conditions were violated, their ac
count would be frozen and they might
be required to return allocated funds
to the Board.
In light of the above, we would like
to offer the following suggestions:
• If SOSA has "no way of knowing
exactly how funds were spent because
there are no records available," we
suggest that they begin to keep
records. There are indeed things
called receipts.
• To bridge any void between the
Board and SOSA, the Board of
Directors and staff of the Financial
Manager do hold regular office hours
at the ASSU Office. SOSA should
take advantage of this, just as many
other student groups do.
It is unfortunate that a student or
ganziation such as SOSA should have
its allocation frozen because it cannot
manage its funds in the appropriate
manner. We have allocated sutdent
funds to SOSA for valuable, educa
tional programs on the simple condi
tion that these funds are indeed spent
on such programming. Rather than
complaining about supposed inade
quacies in the Program Board and the

ASSU, SOSA should now straighten
its records and continue its
praiseworthy efforts to education the
Stanford community about divest
ment from South Africa.

Well, Bishop Tutu spoke the other
day at Stanford, and gave an insight
ful and inspirational address to us all.
Unfortunately, his speech was marred
by the panelists who spoke before
him. While the majority of the
speakers gave an objective, though
somewhat hackneyed, presentation of
the state of affairs in South Africa,
students Alice Stauffer and Joseph
Edozian displayed to me hypocrisy at
its worst.
They did not find it sufficient to
denounce the University's invest
ments in South Africa, but felt it ne
cessary to slander the University itself
and its administrators as immoral,
"Reaganistic" and even evil. Thus, I
would ask these two students and the
multitude of cheering supporters that
lauded their opinions: "Why then, do
you attend Stanford?" Ultimately,
our investments in this university sup
port the administration of our inter
ests in South Africa.

divestment effort
Well, Bishop Tutu spoke the other
day at Stanford, and gave an insight
ful and inspirational address to us all.
Unfortunately, his speech was marred
by the panelists who spoke before
him. While the majority of the
speakers gave an objective, though
somewhat hackneyed, presentation of
the state of affairs in South Africa,
students Alice Stauffer and Joseph
Edozian displayed to me hypocrisy at
its worst.
They did not find it sufficient to
denounce the University's invest
ments in South Africa, but felt it ne
cessary to slander the University itself
and its administrators as immoral,
"Reaganistic" and even evil. Thus, I
would ask these two students and the
multitude of cheering supporters that
lauded their opinions: "Why then, do
you attend Stanford?" Ultimately,
our investments in this university sup
port the administration of our inter
ests in South Africa.
