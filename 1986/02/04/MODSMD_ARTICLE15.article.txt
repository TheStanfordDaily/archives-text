## Corporate mentality threatens democracy 
### 
One thing I have run into at Stanford which con
tinually startles me is the skepticism of so many
people about the effectiveness of democracy. One
would tiiink that the people at Stanford would be
continually pushing for more and more democracy.
But this is not the case. I think this lack of faith in
democracy at Stanford is part of a larger tendency
throughout the United States to see our form of
democracy as a deficient form of government.
The United States was founded on the idea that
nobody has a right to wield power over a group of
people, but that the people themselves should

MIKE TARPEY

make their own decisions and choose their own
government. This is a great idea, but our founders
failed to see the problems democracy would face in
a society where the corporation is the main form of
production and organization, and where wealth is
very unequally distributed.
Within a corporation, the workers produce the
wealth, the executives make decisions about how
and where it will be sold, and the board of directors
make the important decisions about what direction
the corporation will take. The board of directors
and, to a small extent, the executives exercise all
the power over how the corporation is run. while
the workers arc essentially powerless in this
respect.
These types of relations between people within
the corporation have been transferred to almost all
forms of organization within our society, including
our government. The majority of Americans are in

the role of the worker, in the sense that they feel —
and virtually are — powerless to make their voices
heard. This is obvious if you take one look at
Congress. How many of its members are poor
people or former workers? How much attention is
paid to the needs of poor people?
There is a small group of rich businessmen who
command an incredible amount of influence, using
their money to get candidates elected and bills
passed. This small group of people is far more pow
erful than those within the society who are not rich.
All of these factors together produce a large
amount of dissatisfaction among people with our
government, as well as doubts about the validity of
our democracy as a form of government.
These same attitudes are present here at Stan
ford. In a society where the corporation is the
model organization, the University is also organ
ized and run like a corporation. The Board of Trus
tees is a small group of rich businessmen who exer
cise complete power over all members of the Stan
ford community. The University administration,
like the executives of a corporation, carry out the
wishes of the board, and the workers and students,
like the workers at a corporation, follow the rules
that are made for them, while playing no role in the
decision-making process on important issues. It is
clear that this type of system is decidedly un
democratic.
The corporate mentality has so pervaded
people's attitudes that many members of the Stan
ford community, even some of those who are com
pletely powerless, believe that such a situation is a
just and fair one. Talk to many Stanford students,
and they will tell you that students and workers

should pipy no role in the decision-making process,
and that a small group of rich businessmen has the
right to exercise complete control over where tui
tion money is invested, how little money is paid to
workers, which courses are taught, etc. After all,
they say, what do workers and students know about
how to run a university?
This view denies the main premises of
democracy: that power concentrated in the hands
of a few is dangerous, and that people have a right
to participate in the process of decision making
when the issues involve them.
Given this situation, how do we restore a belief
in democracy? At the national level, we may want
to work towards making the United States more of
a participatory democracy and less of a representa
tive one. In addition, we may want to push for the
decentralization of our government. Ideally,
federations of small community democracies could
one day replace one huge national democracy.
At Stanford, students and workers can work for
the abolition of the Board of Trustees and the es
tablishment of true participatory democracy, or at
least for student and worker representation on the
Board of Trustees. Until we can win those victories,
though, we must employ the methods of all who are
disempowered.
Like the workers at a corporation, we need to
band together and threaten the University with
non-cooperation, strike, or constant harassment
until we arc able to achieve our goals.

their money to get candidates elected and bills
passed. This small group of people is far more pow
erful than those within the society who are not rich.
All of these factors together produce a large
amount of dissatisfaction among people with our
government, as well as doubts about the validity of
our democracy as a form of government.
These same attitudes are present here at Stan
ford. In a society where the corporation is the
model organization, the University is also organ
ized and run like a corporation. The Board of Trus
tees is a small group of rich businessmen who exer
cise complete power over all members of the Stan
ford community. The University administration,
like the executives of a corporation, carry out the
wishes of the board, and the workers and students,
like the workers at a corporation, follow the rules
that are made for them, while playing no role in the
decision-making process on important issues. It is
clear that this type of system is decidedly un
democratic.
The corporate mentality has so pervaded
people's attitudes that many members of the Stan
ford community, even some of those who are com
pletely powerless, believe that such a situation is a
just and fair one. Talk to many Stanford students,
and they will tell you that students and workers

should pipy no role in the decision-making process,
and that a small group of rich businessmen has the
right to exercise complete control over where tui
tion money is invested, how little money is paid to
workers, which courses are taught, etc. After all,
they say, what do workers and students know about
how to run a university?
This view denies the main premises of
democracy: that power concentrated in the hands
of a few is dangerous, and that people have a right
to participate in the process of decision making
when the issues involve them.
Given this situation, how do we restore a belief
in democracy? At the national level, we may want
to work towards making the United States more of
a participatory democracy and less of a representa
tive one. In addition, we may want to push for the
decentralization of our government. Ideally,
federations of small community democracies could
one day replace one huge national democracy.
At Stanford, students and workers can work for
the abolition of the Board of Trustees and the es
tablishment of true participatory democracy, or at
least for student and worker representation on the
Board of Trustees. Until we can win those victories,
though, we must employ the methods of all who are
disempowered.
Like the workers at a corporation, we need to
band together and threaten the University with
non-cooperation, strike, or constant harassment
until we arc able to achieve our goals.
