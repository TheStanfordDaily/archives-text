Whatever happened to the halcyon days of "The Won
derful World of Disney"; when Sundays at 7 p.m. was
declared the sacred hour; when Winnie the Pooh would
come to life and sing "Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston
Pie" and always manage to find himself in precarious situ
ations (usually involving a pot of honey) at which time he
would invariably exclaim in that endearing and unimpos
ing tone of voice, "Oh dear": and when Christopher
Robin, in remedying the situation, would try to suppress
(unsuccessfully, too) his giggling, and in adoration, would
admonish the bear with "Oh Pooh."
How I would rush through dinner, leaving my milk un
finished, but never my eggplant — I never could get away
with not finsihing the eggplant — just to catch the opening
seconds of the weekly show: Tinkerbell flying from Dis
ney scene to Disney scene; I never tired of it. I remember
hoping every week that "Pollyanna" would come on, or
maybe the "Parent Trap"; .. . perhaps even a cartoon.
Whatever happened to Dawn dolls and Pop Rocks?
Ditto pants (I never wore them; my mother thought they
were obscene), embroidered jeans, Pet Rocks, G.I. Joe
and Speed Racer?

Ah, I remember the days when Thursday nights were
such a drag, because my parents liked to watch "The Wal
tons"; when the "Brady Bunch" was my favorite show,
because Greg was cute (this was before he got the perm). I
still remeber the remorse I felt upon learning of the
demise of the "Brady Bunch"; I even recall my surprise at
the announcement of the broadcast of the last" Waltons"
episode. What was going to happen to Thursday night?
Who was going to say "Goodnight, John-Boy?"
During vacation, I asked Andrea, my sister (seven —
"almost eight," she claims), what she wanted for
Christmas. A Hello Kitty pencil set?
"Hello, Kitty! Where have you been? That's so old!"
"Okay, What do you think of Cabbage Patch Dolls?"
Laugh, laugh, giggle, laugh, laugh.
"I see. How about .. .." Too late. She had already run
off the catch the latest episode of "Transformers"
(whatever they are) ... or was it "He-Man and His Dog
Spot?" I ended up giving her nightgowns and books.
At the same time, I could not help feeling just a bit up
tight. "I'm too young to feel this old," I kept saying to
myself — more to reassure than to complain. For me the
phenomenon of the "generation gap" had always been
defined in a parent-child context, never in a sibling-sibling
context, and I felt uncomfortably ignorant and out of
touch, or as I would have expressed it 10 years ago, very
"out of it."
And yet, now when I reflect upon last Christmas, I dis
tinctly remember Andrea asking me: what is"A-P-A-R-
T-H-E-I-D"; why is it spelled so funny; is it important? I
told her as much as she wanted to hear; then she flippantly

said "Oh," as if I had taken up too much of her time, and
the PacMan computer game was impatiently calling her. I
cannot criticize her obvious disinterest in the matter.
At her age, I could have cared less who won the Viet
nam War. I remember the night President Nixon resigned:
I strolled into the TV room, remarked at how funny he
looked when he bent his head down so that you could see
his shiny forehead, then promptly left the room when I
didn't incite a response from my serious-looking parents; 1
thought they had had a fight.
Later, I thought I had been somehow deprived of the
opportunity to experience the national insecurity and po
litical tumult of the early 19705. I even believed that I had
to have been somewhat mentally deficient not to recogr
nize the significance of what Walter Cronkite was saying
as pictures of dead bodies flashed across the television
screen. And it seemed too easy to excuse my blatant disin
terest by saying that I was merely too young. But that way
the case.
And now, 1 have issues at my disposal — the injustice of
apartheid, the horror of the Ethiopian famine, the inter
national problem of the terrorist, the never-ceasing quesr
tion of arms control. )•*
I have always been apathetic. I recognized this nation's
bicentennial only by collecting the neat quarters that were
circulated during that year of celebration. I still don't
realize half the things that are going on in this world. And
yet, I do feel like I am somewhat redeeming myself for
those years of indifference and my uncaring attiude.
Sitting in Terman Auditorium waiting to hear Bishop
Desmond Tutu speak, I felt like I was finally taking ad
vantage of what is happening now. By "taking advan
tage," I mean trying to understand the significance of cur
rent events. This is my age; it is my turn to understand
what is happening in the world. I sometimes remark that it
is a pity that my sisters cannot watch "The Brady Bunch"
or "The Waltons" of "The Wonderful World of Disney."
It is a pity that they never played with "Slime" or Dawn
dolls.
Although it is strange to think that I took advantage of
the TV years that "The Brady Bunch" was broadcast, it
actually does make a bit of sense. Although I may be per
verting the phrase a bit, "seize the day" does apply. I am
finally learning to seize the opportunities, to become con
cerned about and understand what Dan Rather is saying
every night. It may seem absurd to compare the transience
of television shows and fads to the temporary nature of
important issues, whether it be political, economic, or so
cial; however, to a political, economic, and social
neophyte like me, it is an analogy which makes a poignant
statement.
Years from now when I remember the days compact
disc players cost an overwhelming $200 and tuition at
Stanford was a mere $16,000, I will recall the important
issues of the time with the same grateful sentimentality
and nostalgia with which I look back on the days of Dis
ney. I know, though, that some things will never change:

Robin, in remedying the situation, would try to suppress
(unsuccessfully, too) his giggling, and in adoration, would
admonish the bear with "Oh Pooh."
How I would rush through dinner, leaving my milk un
finished, but never my eggplant — I never could get away
with not finsihing the eggplant — just to catch the opening
seconds of the weekly show: Tinkerbell flying from Dis
ney scene to Disney scene; I never tired of it. I remember
hoping every week that "Pollyanna" would come on, or
maybe the "Parent Trap"; .. . perhaps even a cartoon.
Whatever happened to Dawn dolls and Pop Rocks?
Ditto pants (I never wore them; my mother thought they
were obscene), embroidered jeans, Pet Rocks, G.I. Joe
and Speed Racer?

Ah, I remember the days when Thursday nights were
such a drag, because my parents liked to watch "The Wal
tons"; when the "Brady Bunch" was my favorite show,
because Greg was cute (this was before he got the perm). I
still remeber the remorse I felt upon learning of the
demise of the "Brady Bunch"; I even recall my surprise at
the announcement of the broadcast of the last" Waltons"
episode. What was going to happen to Thursday night?
Who was going to say "Goodnight, John-Boy?"
During vacation, I asked Andrea, my sister (seven —
"almost eight," she claims), what she wanted for
Christmas. A Hello Kitty pencil set?
"Hello, Kitty! Where have you been? That's so old!"
"Okay, What do you think of Cabbage Patch Dolls?"
Laugh, laugh, giggle, laugh, laugh.
"I see. How about .. .." Too late. She had already run
off the catch the latest episode of "Transformers"
(whatever they are) ... or was it "He-Man and His Dog
Spot?" I ended up giving her nightgowns and books.
At the same time, I could not help feeling just a bit up
tight. "I'm too young to feel this old," I kept saying to
myself — more to reassure than to complain. For me the
phenomenon of the "generation gap" had always been
defined in a parent-child context, never in a sibling-sibling
context, and I felt uncomfortably ignorant and out of
touch, or as I would have expressed it 10 years ago, very
"out of it."
And yet, now when I reflect upon last Christmas, I dis
tinctly remember Andrea asking me: what is"A-P-A-R-
T-H-E-I-D"; why is it spelled so funny; is it important? I
told her as much as she wanted to hear; then she flippantly

said "Oh," as if I had taken up too much of her time, and
the PacMan computer game was impatiently calling her. I
cannot criticize her obvious disinterest in the matter.
At her age, I could have cared less who won the Viet
nam War. I remember the night President Nixon resigned:
I strolled into the TV room, remarked at how funny he
looked when he bent his head down so that you could see
his shiny forehead, then promptly left the room when I
didn't incite a response from my serious-looking parents; 1
thought they had had a fight.
Later, I thought I had been somehow deprived of the
opportunity to experience the national insecurity and po
litical tumult of the early 19705. I even believed that I had
to have been somewhat mentally deficient not to recogr
nize the significance of what Walter Cronkite was saying
as pictures of dead bodies flashed across the television
screen. And it seemed too easy to excuse my blatant disin
terest by saying that I was merely too young. But that way
the case.
And now, 1 have issues at my disposal — the injustice of
apartheid, the horror of the Ethiopian famine, the inter
national problem of the terrorist, the never-ceasing quesr
tion of arms control. )•*
I have always been apathetic. I recognized this nation's
bicentennial only by collecting the neat quarters that were
circulated during that year of celebration. I still don't
realize half the things that are going on in this world. And
yet, I do feel like I am somewhat redeeming myself for
those years of indifference and my uncaring attiude.
Sitting in Terman Auditorium waiting to hear Bishop
Desmond Tutu speak, I felt like I was finally taking ad
vantage of what is happening now. By "taking advan
tage," I mean trying to understand the significance of cur
rent events. This is my age; it is my turn to understand
what is happening in the world. I sometimes remark that it
is a pity that my sisters cannot watch "The Brady Bunch"
or "The Waltons" of "The Wonderful World of Disney."
It is a pity that they never played with "Slime" or Dawn
dolls.
Although it is strange to think that I took advantage of
the TV years that "The Brady Bunch" was broadcast, it
actually does make a bit of sense. Although I may be per
verting the phrase a bit, "seize the day" does apply. I am
finally learning to seize the opportunities, to become con
cerned about and understand what Dan Rather is saying
every night. It may seem absurd to compare the transience
of television shows and fads to the temporary nature of
important issues, whether it be political, economic, or so

neophyte like me, it is an analogy which makes a poignant
