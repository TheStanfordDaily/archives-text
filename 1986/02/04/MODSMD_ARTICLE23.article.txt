### CHRIS MYERS Staff writer 
Welcome to the Volume 189 edi
tion of Bug Me. Most of you know
what this column is all about. The
name is self-explanatory: you are
invited to bug me about anything that
bugs you, or anything that you're just
curious about.
In the past, most questions have
dealt with some aspect of Stanford,
ranging from peculiarities of the
campus to the bizarre origins of stu
dent traditions. Just about any ques
tion is fair game, as long as it's at least
mildly answerable.
Feel free to make your questions as
serious or as frivolous as you like. I
have a particular affinity for mind
lessly obscure trivia, especially about
Stanford history, so questions of that
nature are quite welcome. I may not
be able to answer all of them, but I'll
try, and I'll have fun in the attempt.
I'm a decidedly non-technical per
son, but please ask those questions
anyway. I'll just defer to better minds
than my own, aijd we'll get the an
swer.
At the very least, this column
should be informative. Hopefully, it
will occasionally also be entertaining
or fascinating or fun or just silly.
Sometimes, it will be all those things,
and then it will virtually border on the
sublime. Maybe.
I'd like to see Bug Me evolve to a
point where if — heaven forbid! —
I'm completely stumped by a ques
tion, I'll offer it up to you, The Daily
readership, and if you know the an
swer, or the source of an answer, you
can write in and as a reward you'll

get a tree official Bug Me T-shirt and
an all-expenses-paid weekend for two
in the luxurious Daily office, and
gradually a die-hard Bug Me reader
ship will rise from the ashes of ignor
ance, and then a Bug Me cult, and I'll
get a Pulitzer Prize, and every week
I'll go on a stream-of-consciousness
ramble like this one.

Enough of this. Please, write in!
Bug me! Ultimately, the quality and
flavor of Bug Me will depend on you,
oh gracious readers. Be imaginative;
have fun at my expense. I pledge
myself to the untiring pursuit of
knowledge, no matter how ridiculous
it may be.
And now to clean some skeletons
out of my file drawer and answer a
question left over from the last
volume.
I may be missing something funda
mental, but in the food service lines in

Wilbur Hall the drink dispensers are
placed at the end of the cafeteria -style
line so that the lines are constantly
held up as people serve themselves
beverages. Hotli the luishers and the
queue often have to stand still while
waiting for one person fun her lip the
way to serve himself. Is this intended
as a way to slow down ravenous stu
dents and hyperactive hashers '.'

No, you're not missing anything
fundamental. However, the Wilbur
food service lines are — namely, ex
tra drains. The problem dates back to
the '50s, when Wilbur Hall was first
built (and opened as an all-male
residence) in September 1955. Back
then beverage dispensers weren't as
prevalent as today, so there wasn't a
crowding problem in the beverage
area, according to Wilbur Food Ser
vice manager Debbie Derana.
"1 agree, it's terrible, but we're lim
ited in our physical resources,"
Derana said.
One possible solution is to move
the beverages into the dining area.
Progress was made in that direction
last year when electrical outlets were
added to the dining area. But there
aren't any drains there, either, and
little prospect of any in the future.
As for putting more drains into the
serving line itself, that's not looming
in the future either. According to
Derana, putting new drains in would
entail cutting through the existing
stainless steel service structure, and
that would be very expensive. And
tuition would go up. and everyone
would complain a lot more about that
than they ever would about waiting in
line in the Wilbur dining hall.
