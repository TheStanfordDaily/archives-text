## 'Amen Corner' enraptures with gospel, jazz 
### MARK TOMPKINS Staff writer 
Nothing carries emotion so well as
music, nor is there anything that can
console a troubled spirit quite like it.
The characters in James Baldwin's
"The Amen Corner" know this; they
know that whether it be jazz or gospel
spirituals, music will always be some
thing they can turn to for hope.
For Harlem congregation leader
Sister Margaret Alexander (Monica
Lytle), the spirituals that she and her
flock sing so fervently are the most
joyous means of communicating with
God. But for her musician son David
(Nathaniel Crowell), it isn't enough
to play in church services. Jazz has
grabbed hold of him. Only when he's
playing piano in the smoky clubs
downtown does he feel fully alive.
Margaret hates jazz, and refuses to
allow David's expression through it,

fearing that he'll end up like his
father Luke (Stephen Randall). Luke
had left home years before, clinging
to the dissipated life of an unsuccess
ful jazz musician on the road. David
has to go downtown on the sly, and
there he becomes an entirely new,
hipper and happier person. In the
clubs he picks up music tips and easy
women, and also comes across his
father for the first time in 10 years.
The main concern of "The Amen
Corner" is the decline and fall of
Margaret's orderly existence. Her son
David ignores her preaching, her con
gregation needs constant tending, and
there's additonal church business to
be done in Philadelphia.
Her worries culminate upon Luke's
arrival on her doorstep, half-dead
and doggedly unrepentant. As a
result, Margaret's gossipy congrega*
tion takes note of how their

seemingly infallible moral leader can
not even hold her own family to
gether. It is decided that Margaret
should be relieved of her duties.
Music is present throughout "The
Amen Corner," which is a good
thing, since it is hardly a flawless
drama. The first act opens in a dusty

Fortunately, the actors are able to
maintain the choir's high standards.
Particularly good are Crowell as
David, the young piano player caught
between two worlds, and Randall as
Luke. Randall's carefully understated
tone is right in keeping with Luke's

little church, but the choir sings with
enough exuberance to fill the Sistine
Chapel with lusty sound. Singers
Carla Pipion, Martin Jackson, Essie
Dowdell and Theda Jackson give off
a contagious enthusiasm that carries

burned-out character.
Luke and David have a long scene
in Act 2 in which the father tells his
son, "You have to learn to live with
the things that hurt you in life." It's a
key moment in the play and it works

well, thanks to adept acting by the
two men.
All of the supporting players per
formed well, but the standouts are
Christy Lynn Brown and Brett
Mahoney as the married couple Sister
and Brother Boxer.
Brother Boxer is the member of
the flock who is dearly tempted to
stray from the path of righteousness,
and he can never quite keep from
saying the wrong thing at the worst
possible moment. Mahoney gives an
extremely funny performance.
Lytle handles the difficult role of
Sister Margaret admirably, success
fully taking on the challenges in
herent in Baldwin's script. As
Baldwin writes her, Margaret is re
quired to strike the single note of
near hysteria throughout Acts 2 and
3, so she has nowhere to go by the
play's climax.
There are too many scenes with the

words 'Big Confrontation' writ large
all over them, and Margaret appears
in every one. These scenes slow the
play's two-and-a-half-hour running
time, and when they lurch to a halt,
the audience is exhausted.
As directed by Sandra Richards,
"The Amen Corner" is a production
whose visuals superbly reinforce its
content. The sets and costumes build
a worn-out, worn-down atmosphere,
which is reflected in Baldwin's char
acters.
As I have mentioned before, the
music is the show's main attraction.
The play moves outside of plot reality
and jumps into real life in its musical
finale, as drummer Evan David Allen
and trumpeter George Rice Jr. strut
their stuff with real aplomb.
"The Amen Corner" will run Feb.
5-8 in the Nitery at 8 p.m. Tickets are
$4.
