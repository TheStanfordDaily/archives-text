# 'Runaway Train' travels nowhere
## 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
"Runaway Train" belongs to that sub
genre of violent action pictures which trades
heavily in existential machismo. John
Milius' "Conan" is an unavoidably campy
movie of this type, and at a key moment in
"Runaway Train," the anti-hero Manny
(Jon Voight) speaks the Nietzsche-by-way
of-Conan line, "That which does not kill me
makes me stronger."
No doubt Conan and Manny function
brilliantly in a world ruled solely by brute
force, but when the directors of their
respective movies try to impose their model
on the real world, these he-men come off
looking more like little boys in oversized
bodies. And that's a good simile for
"Runaway Train" itself.
The story begins at a federal penitentiary
in Alaska, where Manny, an
"everycriminal," has been welded into his
cell for three years. He is released from the
cell on humanitarian grounds, and he im
probably escapes with a young inmate. Buck
(Eric Roberts).
The warden, Ranken (John P. Ryan)
wants Manny dead, and his pursuit is clearly
meant to carry a cosmic significance; theirs
is an eternal conflict, but what does it all
mean? It means an excuse for some relent
less action when Manny and Buck hop on a
train, which turns into a runaway when the
engineer croaks.

Fatalism weighs very heavily in movies
like this one. Life is nasty, brutish and short
for Manny's kind, and he is, of course,
doomed from the outset. Manny may have
been born in prison; you can't picture him
free, outside, living like any ordinary human
being. So when he sees the soon-to-be
runaway in a trainyard and he knows that
"that's the one — that's the one we're gonna
take," we know that it will become yet an
other prison for him.
But the director Andrei Konchalovsky
and the writers Djordje Milicevic, Paul Zin
del and Edward Bunker can't leave it at
that; they have to pile all kinds of other
metaphors on the runaway train, and soon
it's so loaded down with meaning it's a
wonder it can move at all.
The train becomes an unstoppable force
as it accumulates the debris through which it
plows, so that it soon looks like a long
snooted behemouth raging across the barren
Alaskan landscape. Konchalovsky has a
nifty image with this train, and he knows
how to use it. He could be a great action
director, and he stages movement well in the
difficult, confining locations of the train and
the prison, but he and the writers think their
spiffy images and situations can hold more
meaning than they do.
So when Ranken and Manny finally get
together on the train, and the people at the
station's computer switchboard are lament
ing, "All this technology, and we still can't
stop it," we in the audience are kept busy
trying to sort out the mixed metaphors.

The movie sells the train as the modern
world as a prison as an eternal battleground,
and we the people are all ruthless bloodied
criminals fighting the system, because that's
what we're fated to do; or something. The
movie starts piling up every existential ac
tion cliche on film, and it quickly derails.
There's not much to say about the perfor
mances, except that they get more frenetic
and ridiculous as the movie progresses.
Voight tries to overact his way out of a bad
casting decision, and as he gets more (and
worse) lines towards the end, his perfor
mance degenerates into pure camp.
In the film's most absurd scenes, Manny
gets to teach Buck about what he should do
with his life, and gets to shout his defiance at
Ranken overhead (in a helicopter pursuing
the train). In general, the louder and more
emotional Voight gets, the worse he
becomes. Eric Roberts takes his cue from
Voight, as does Ryan.
Rebecca DeMornay is a tomboy sidekick
onboard the train, and her role is an after
thought; this is not, to put it mildly, a movie
with any kind of female perspective.
The original screenplay for "Runaway
Train" was by Akira Kurosawa, and if one
strips away Konchalovsky and Co.'s macho
posturing and dumps a couple of greater
meanings, the material might work as a
small, tight action film with ideas that grow
out of the central situation. But "Runaway
Train" is a bloated adventure. Like
"Conan," it is overstuffed with pretentious
silliness.

force, but when the directors of their
respective movies try to impose their model
on the real world, these he-men come off
looking more like little boys in oversized
bodies. And that's a good simile for
"Runaway Train" itself.
The story begins at a federal penitentiary
in Alaska, where Manny, an
"everycriminal," has been welded into his
cell for three years. He is released from the
cell on humanitarian grounds, and he im
probably escapes with a young inmate. Buck
(Eric Roberts).
The warden, Ranken (John P. Ryan)
wants Manny dead, and his pursuit is clearly
meant to carry a cosmic significance; theirs
is an eternal conflict, but what does it all
mean? It means an excuse for some relent
less action when Manny and Buck hop on a
train, which turns into a runaway when the
engineer croaks.

Fatalism weighs very heavily in movies
like this one. Life is nasty, brutish and short
for Manny's kind, and he is, of course,
doomed from the outset. Manny may have
been born in prison; you can't picture him
free, outside, living like any ordinary human
being. So when he sees the soon-to-be
runaway in a trainyard and he knows that
"that's the one — that's the one we're gonna
take," we know that it will become yet an
other prison for him.
But the director Andrei Konchalovsky
and the writers Djordje Milicevic, Paul Zin
del and Edward Bunker can't leave it at
that; they have to pile all kinds of other
metaphors on the runaway train, and soon
it's so loaded down with meaning it's a
wonder it can move at all.
The train becomes an unstoppable force
as it accumulates the debris through which it
plows, so that it soon looks like a long
snooted behemouth raging across the barren
Alaskan landscape. Konchalovsky has a
nifty image with this train, and he knows
how to use it. He could be a great action
director, and he stages movement well in the
difficult, confining locations of the train and
the prison, but he and the writers think their
spiffy images and situations can hold more
meaning than they do.
So when Ranken and Manny finally get
together on the train, and the people at the
station's computer switchboard are lament
ing, "All this technology, and we still can't
stop it," we in the audience are kept busy
trying to sort out the mixed metaphors.

The movie sells the train as the modern
world as a prison as an eternal battleground,
and we the people are all ruthless bloodied
criminals fighting the system, because that's
what we're fated to do; or something. The
movie starts piling up every existential ac
tion cliche on film, and it quickly derails.
There's not much to say about the perfor
mances, except that they get more frenetic
and ridiculous as the movie progresses.
Voight tries to overact his way out of a bad
casting decision, and as he gets more (and
worse) lines towards the end, his perfor
mance degenerates into pure camp.
In the film's most absurd scenes, Manny
gets to teach Buck about what he should do
with his life, and gets to shout his defiance at
Ranken overhead (in a helicopter pursuing
the train). In general, the louder and more
emotional Voight gets, the worse he
becomes. Eric Roberts takes his cue from
Voight, as does Ryan.
Rebecca DeMornay is a tomboy sidekick
onboard the train, and her role is an after
thought; this is not, to put it mildly, a movie
with any kind of female perspective.
The original screenplay for "Runaway
Train" was by Akira Kurosawa, and if one
strips away Konchalovsky and Co.'s macho
posturing and dumps a couple of greater
meanings, the material might work as a
small, tight action film with ideas that grow
out of the central situation. But "Runaway
Train" is a bloated adventure. Like
"Conan," it is overstuffed with pretentious
silliness.
