# Comedy and tragedy mix in 'The Sea'
## 
### PETER MORGAN Staff writer 
The Berkeley Repertory Theatre
continues to live up to its reputation
as the best theater in the Bay Area
with its newest production, Edward
Bond's "The Sea." It is the strongest
entry of the Rep's season so far, and
definitely one of the best shows I've
seen this year.
This is a curious state of affairs
since the play has a very loose plot
and obviously stated theme. Bond is
one of the "angry young men" of
Britain who, in the late 19505, wrote
plays about rebellion against the es
tablished social order.
Focusing on social inequality, Bond
has become famous for both his view
of theater as a way of changing soci
ety and his controversial ways of im
plementing this view. He caused
momentous scandal in "Saved," in
which several thugs stone a baby to
death on stage. The lawsuits that fol
lowed led to the abolition of govern
ment censoring of plays.

"The Sea," however, is one of
Bond's more subdued works, one in
which he attempts to stimulate
change through humor. The play, set
in 1907, is about a shipwrecked
young man named Willy who is
washed ashore near a small village on
the east coast of England. While
waiting for the official inquest into
the death of his shipmate, a native of
the village, Willy gets to know the in
habitants.
The play is really less about him
than the villagers, who seem peaceful
enough but actually fight great an
guish and frustration in their daily
lives.
Above all, the local draper, Mr.
Hatch, and the well-to-do Mrs. Rafi
are the focus of Bond's observation.
Their relationship is an antagonistic
one between fawning clerk and de
manding client, and this antagonism
takes its toll when Mrs. Rafi pushes
Hatch too far.
In addition to these central charac
ters are the destitute beachcomber
Evens and Rose, the fiance of Willy's

drowned friend. Evens lives in a little
hut and is Bond's spokesman. Rose
melancholily embodies the "woman
of death" who has no future but
loneliness.
While this may sound very heavy
and poetic (and many elements of the
show are), the majority of this play is
taken up with raucous laughter. Even
though it lasts for nearly three hours,
the evening whizzes by with the antics
of Mrs. Rafi and Hatch. Each have
their troupe of comic underlings to
command: Rafi has her cousins,
friends and maids and Hatch has the
local ragamuffins who make up the
Coast Gaurd.
The women's absurd rehearsal of
"Orpheus" is a direct descendant of
"Pyramus and Thisbe" from
"Midsummer's Night Dream," and
their confusion later during the fu
neral ceremony is some of the fun
niest black humor around.
If this were not enough. Hatch and
his cronies are convinced Willy is a
space alien scouting out the town for
invasion. Hatch's orations on the evils

of space aliens and their sly tailing of
Willy have to be seen to be believed.
Unfortunately, Rafi's demands on
Hatch finally take their toll and his
mind snaps. At the end of the first
act, in an intense performance by
Laurence Ballard, he changes from
buffoon to manic killer, something
out of "Sweeney Todd."
This is the mix of broad farce and
sober poeticism that Bond captures
so well in "The Sea." The play sways
back and forth between these two
tones, one absurdly entertaining and
the other quietly menacing. Even the
scene shifts performed by the sup
porting cast capture the silliness
among the young girls and the
menace when the sailors get in their
way.
In the end we find that what makes
Hatch and Mrs. Rafi so funny is also
what makes them so dangerous.
These two embody the choice be
tween "madness and discipline" that
the present world offers to Willy and
Rose (who develop a love relation
ship between sight gags). The close of
the show finally brings out Bond's
point, as stated by Evens, for all the
lunacy we have seen: the world is sick
and must change to get healthy.
The Rep's ensemble acting is as
solid as ever — Ballard's Hatch and
Shirley Jac Wagner's Mrs. Rafi stand
out in particular. But the really tre
mendous aspect of this show is the ac
complishment of the designers. The
Rep has surpassed even its "normal"
excellence in sets, lighting, music and
costumes. Willy and Rose move
silently in creamy whites amongst the
textured and worn "sea clothes" of
the locals and the rich dresses of the
women. The set is overshadowed by a
huge green "frame" which looks out
onto a stunning sea and sky, and
transforms quietly and magically into
a multitude of settings.
Above all, though, is the enchant
ing music of Todd Barton. He and
sound designer James Leßrecht
deserve full honors for creating a
mood and world that conjures the sea
in all its forms. From the opening
storm sequence to the delicately
peaceful ending, the beauty and
power of this music perfectly en
hances the play.
To put it simply, the Rep has done
it again. If you want to see a show
that meanders a bit but is hilariously
intense, this is it. It is one of the few
plays or productions I know of that
successfully entertains and agitates at
the same time, an unsettling but
enthralling thought for commercial
theater.

Hatch finally take their toll and his
mind snaps. At the end of the first
act, in an intense performance by
Laurence Ballard, he changes from
buffoon to manic killer, something
out of "Sweeney Todd."
This is the mix of broad farce and
sober poeticism that Bond captures
so well in "The Sea." The play sways
back and forth between these two
tones, one absurdly entertaining and
the other quietly menacing. Even the
scene shifts performed by the sup
porting cast capture the silliness
among the young girls and the
menace when the sailors get in their
way.
In the end we find that what makes
Hatch and Mrs. Rafi so funny is also
what makes them so dangerous.
These two embody the choice be
tween "madness and discipline" that
the present world offers to Willy and
Rose (who develop a love relation
ship between sight gags). The close of
the show finally brings out Bond's
point, as stated by Evens, for all the
lunacy we have seen: the world is sick
and must change to get healthy.
The Rep's ensemble acting is as
solid as ever — Ballard's Hatch and
Shirley Jac Wagner's Mrs. Rafi stand
out in particular. But the really tre
mendous aspect of this show is the ac
complishment of the designers. The
Rep has surpassed even its "normal"
excellence in sets, lighting, music and
costumes. Willy and Rose move
silently in creamy whites amongst the
textured and worn "sea clothes" of
the locals and the rich dresses of the
women. The set is overshadowed by a
huge green "frame" which looks out
onto a stunning sea and sky, and
transforms quietly and magically into
a multitude of settings.
Above all, though, is the enchant
ing music of Todd Barton. He and
sound designer James Leßrecht
deserve full honors for creating a
mood and world that conjures the sea
in all its forms. From the opening
storm sequence to the delicately
peaceful ending, the beauty and
power of this music perfectly en
hances the play.
To put it simply, the Rep has done
it again. If you want to see a show
that meanders a bit but is hilariously
intense, this is it. It is one of the few
plays or productions I know of that
successfully entertains and agitates at
the same time, an unsettling but
enthralling thought for commercial
theater.

Laurence Ballard plays "Hatch," a man convinced that invasion from outer space is imminent, in Berkeley
Repertory Theatre's production of Edward Bond's "The Sea."
The Berkeley Repertory Theatre
continues to live up to its reputation
as the best theater in the Bay Area
with its newest production, Edward
Bond's "The Sea." It is the strongest
entry of the Rep's season so far, and
definitely one of the best shows I've
seen this year.
This is a curious state of affairs
since the play has a very loose plot
and obviously stated theme. Bond is
one of the "angry young men" of
Britain who, in the late 19505, wrote
plays about rebellion against the es
tablished social order.
Focusing on social inequality, Bond
has become famous for both his view
of theater as a way of changing soci
ety and his controversial ways of im
plementing this view. He caused
momentous scandal in "Saved," in
which several thugs stone a baby to
death on stage. The lawsuits that fol
lowed led to the abolition of govern
ment censoring of plays.

"The Sea," however, is one of
Bond's more subdued works, one in
which he attempts to stimulate
change through humor. The play, set
in 1907, is about a shipwrecked
young man named Willy who is
washed ashore near a small village on
the east coast of England. While
waiting for the official inquest into
the death of his shipmate, a native of
the village, Willy gets to know the in
habitants.
The play is really less about him
than the villagers, who seem peaceful
enough but actually fight great an
guish and frustration in their daily
lives.
Above all, the local draper, Mr.
Hatch, and the well-to-do Mrs. Rafi
are the focus of Bond's observation.
Their relationship is an antagonistic
one between fawning clerk and de
manding client, and this antagonism
takes its toll when Mrs. Rafi pushes
Hatch too far.
In addition to these central charac
ters are the destitute beachcomber
Evens and Rose, the fiance of Willy's

drowned friend. Evens lives in a little
hut and is Bond's spokesman. Rose
melancholily embodies the "woman
of death" who has no future but
loneliness.
While this may sound very heavy
and poetic (and many elements of the
show are), the majority of this play is
taken up with raucous laughter. Even
though it lasts for nearly three hours,
the evening whizzes by with the antics
of Mrs. Rafi and Hatch. Each have
their troupe of comic underlings to
command: Rafi has her cousins,
friends and maids and Hatch has the
local ragamuffins who make up the
Coast Gaurd.
The women's absurd rehearsal of
"Orpheus" is a direct descendant of
"Pyramus and Thisbe" from
"Midsummer's Night Dream," and
their confusion later during the fu
neral ceremony is some of the fun
niest black humor around.
If this were not enough. Hatch and
his cronies are convinced Willy is a
space alien scouting out the town for
invasion. Hatch's orations on the evils

of space aliens and their sly tailing of
Willy have to be seen to be believed.
Unfortunately, Rafi's demands on
Hatch finally take their toll and his
mind snaps. At the end of the first
