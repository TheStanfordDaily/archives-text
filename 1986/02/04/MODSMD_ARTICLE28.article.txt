# Women preserve women's greatest

### PAT FREYTAG 
The adjectives "eclectic and
electric" appear at the top of the
Bay Area Women's Philhar
monic's (8.A.W.P.) letterhead. It
seems a fitting description for the
only professional orchestra in the
country which seeks to promote
the works and artistry of both past
and contemporary women com
posers, conductors and
performers. .
Its driving spirit and primary
goal is to project and elevate
women composers to their rightful
place in classical music lore by
presenting their long-neglected
works. By selecting and perform
ing the best by women, B.A.W.P.
certainly offers an "eclectic" and
potentially "electrifying" body of
music.
Since its founding in 1980 by
Miriam Abrams, Nan Washburn
and Elizabeth Min, the Women's
Philharmonic has dedicated itself
to a constant and detailed investi
gation of overlooked works and
biographical anecdotes of women
composers from all over the world.
B.A.W.P. has been so successful in
its research that it has become a
national resource center for many
orchestras seeking to perform
traditionally inaccessible works by
women.
Often, when parts of particular
pieces or works are lost or
damaged, a careful and diligent ef
fort in editing and reconstruction
is necessary in order to render
them performable. Washburn, ar
tistic and research director, is fre
quently consulted on matters of
scoring and orchestration by musi
cal directors, for she is chiefly re
sponsible for the restitution of
such pieces.
For example, a suite from the
ballet-heroique, "Les Genies", by
Mile. Duval (7-1769) has been
lost to history. Yet an artistically
reconstructed version of the suite
arranged by Washburn will be one
of the highlights of B.A.W.P.'s
second concert this season.
Duval's four-act ballet (with
prologue) was the first work by a
woman to be performed at the
Paris Opera (1738).
To complement the ballet suite,
B.A.W.P. will perform "Sinfonia

and Aria Syreny" from Francesca
Â»Caccini*s "La Liberazione De
Ruggiero Dale'lsola D'Alcina."
The Italian singer and composer is
best known for this "ballcto,"
which was commissioned and per
formed in honor of the forthcom
ing visit of a Polish prince to Italy
(1625).
The B.A.W.P. program, entitled
"Baroquan Treasures," will also
include a concerto for two violins
by Vivaldi, which was written to
be performed by women virtuosi.
"Le Sommeil D'Ulisse," a can
tata by Elizabeth Jacquet de la
Guerre, and "Sinfonia In C" by
Marianne Martinez will conclude
the program. Martinez, an
eighteenth-century Austrian
harpsichordist and pianist, took
lessons under Haydn and once
played a four-hand Mozart sonata
with the composer.
In addition to preserving the ex
traordinary work of women from
the past. B.A.W.P. hopes to con
tinue to provide as much exposure
to women conductors as possible.
For its second concert,
B.A.W.P. has invited Tamara
Brooks as its guest conductor.
Brooks is the Music Director and
Conductor of the Mendelssohn
Club of Philadelphia. She also
serves as President of the New
School of Music and is the founder
and Director of Sequcnza, a pro
fessional Philadelphia chamber
ensemble.
B.A.W.P. celebrates its fifth an
niversary this season, and already
it has received two awards from
the American Society of Com
posers, Authors and Publishers
(ASCAP) and the American Sym
phony Orchestra League for its
excellence in the programming of
contemporary music. It has also
been invited to perform in
Australia in 1988 during the
country's bicentennial celebration
as well as in Kenya during the
Conference on Women.
Interested listeners can catch
"Baroquan Treasures" on Feb. 7
at the First Congregation Church
on Dana and Durant Streets in
Berkeley, and on Feb. 8 at the
McKenna Theater at San Fran
cisco State University. Both per
formances begin at 8 p.m.
