## What the university does with its money How would you invest the endowment pool? 
### KEN SAWYER Editorial staff 
This is the second article in a two
part series on what the University does
with its endowment money.
What would you do if you had the
responsibility of investing $981 mil
lion for Stanford University? Perhaps
you would invest in some Charmin to
replace the so-called "toilet paper" in
the dorms. Perhaps you would buy
some Jaguars to replace those
mundane University Chevettes. Per
haps you might even splurge ($9Bl
million is a lot of money) and put a
hot tub or two into some of the
dorms.
However, the Office of the Trea
surer, more frequently called Stan
ford Investments, has decided to pur
chase things that don't have quite the
appeal of Charmin, Jaguars and hot
tubs. With its $981 million, Stanford
has purchased domestic and interna
tional equities, made fixed income in
vestments, and invested in venture
capital. Pretty exciting stuff, eh?
That's what I thought as I sat across
from University Treasurer Rod
Adams at the Stanford Investment
office on Hamilton Street in Palo
Alto. But, as I soon found out, invest
ments that sound boring can turn out
to be exciting money makers.
• "We here at Stanford Investments
are charged with the task of investing
the University's endowment money
and making sure it maintains its real
value," Adams said. When donors
endow money, they don't want to find
out that it has all disappeared in a few

years. This means that hot tubs and
Jaguars are out and domestic equities
and venture capital are in.
Deciding just how much of these
things are in is Stanford Investments'
main job. In the office, there are a
number of people qualified in a wide
variety of areas. Some, like Adams,
specialize in venture capital. Others
specialize in domestic equities, or
fixed income investments, or real
estate.
Each specialist has a good idea of
how well their area is expected to fare
over the short and long run. Depend
ing on these forecasts, Stanford In
vestments decides where to put its
money. Harry Turner, a bond special
ist (bonds are loans to companies
which pay interest, greater than that
paid by banks, and are considered a
"fixed income" investment), ex
plained how his recent projections in
fluenced the overall strategy of the
office.
"It is my personal responsibility to
look for what the bond market is ex
pected to do," he said. "The bond
market today is excellent — better
than most of the past 100 years. It is
offering a very high real rate of
return."
Adams concurred, adding, "What
is more, the stock market cycle is well
advanced. Because of this, we hope to
take some of the money we currently
have in stocks (domestic equities) and
move it into bonds. This adjustment
will protect us over the next year."
Stanford, as of Sept. 30, 1985, had
about 48 percent of the $981 million
endowment invested in domestic
equities. Because of the new projec

tions, plans call for 9 percent of the
endowment to be moved from
domestic equities into domestic and
international fixed income (bonds).
This will leave about 25 percent in
domestic fixed income and 5 percent
in international fixed income.
Stanford Investments does not ac
tually decide which stocks to sell or
which bonds to buy. That task is left
up to outside managers. In the case of
bonds, Rosenberg Capital Manage
ment in San Francisco makes all the
decisions. Stanford Investments
chose to delegate the responsibility to
Rosenberg because of its excellent
performance in the past.
Of course, there are many instruc
tions given to managers investing
money for the University. Rosenberg
Capital Management is instructed
with respect to the credit quality of
the bond (companies that might go
broke have low credit ratings), the
yield of the bond (how much interest
is being paid, and the maturity date)
and when the principal will be
returned.
Stanford Investments keeps a
watchful eye on all its managers. Risk
and performance are two things the
office watches closely. Investing in
many risky companies may offer the
possibility of high returns but may
also put a large portion of the Univer
sity's endowment in jeopardy.
Despite this caution, Stanford aims
for a very high real rate of return
(return after inflation). Managers
must sometimes aggressively invest
for the University to bring in these
high returns. Stanford Investments

constantly monitors the managers,
making sure that they meet the stand
ards and achieve the goals set for
them.
So far, Stanford has been very suc
cessful. The University hopes to have
a 6.75 percent return after inflation
— an ambitious goal by any investor's
standards. Slightly less than half of
the 6.75 percent is used for current
expenses, while the rest is returned to

the endowment pool.
Adams remarked, "Through rein
vestment of the income which we do
not pay out we hope to maintain the
real value of the endowment. In other
words, the endowment money should
be able to buy the same basket of
goods year after year."
Historically, Stanford has been one
of the best universites at investing its
money. In fact, Stanford does so well

that income generated by the invest
ments contribute over 20 peicent of
the annual expense fund.
Indeed, while domestic equities,
venture capital, and fixed income in
vestments don't sound like such a
good way to spend money when
compared to Jaguars and hot tubs,
the income they provide is essential
to the University's financial well
being.

also put a large portion of the Univer
sity's endowment in jeopardy.
Despite this caution, Stanford aims
for a very high real rate of return
(return after inflation). Managers
must sometimes aggressively invest
for the University to bring in these
high returns. Stanford Investments

constantly monitors the managers,
making sure that they meet the stand
ards and achieve the goals set for
them.
So far, Stanford has been very suc
cessful. The University hopes to have
a 6.75 percent return after inflation
— an ambitious goal by any investor's
standards. Slightly less than half of
the 6.75 percent is used for current
expenses, while the rest is returned to

the endowment pool.
Adams remarked, "Through rein
vestment of the income which we do
not pay out we hope to maintain the
real value of the endowment. In other
words, the endowment money should
be able to buy the same basket of
goods year after year."
Historically, Stanford has been one
of the best universites at investing its
money. In fact, Stanford does so well

that income generated by the invest
ments contribute over 20 peicent of
the annual expense fund.
Indeed, while domestic equities,
venture capital, and fixed income in
vestments don't sound like such a
good way to spend money when
compared to Jaguars and hot tubs,
the income they provide is essential
to the University's financial well
being.

This is the second article in a two
part series on what the University does
with its endowment money.
What would you do if you had the
responsibility of investing $981 mil
lion for Stanford University? Perhaps
you would invest in some Charmin to
replace the so-called "toilet paper" in
the dorms. Perhaps you would buy
some Jaguars to replace those
mundane University Chevettes. Per
haps you might even splurge ($9Bl
million is a lot of money) and put a
hot tub or two into some of the
dorms.
However, the Office of the Trea
surer, more frequently called Stan
ford Investments, has decided to pur
chase things that don't have quite the
appeal of Charmin, Jaguars and hot
tubs. With its $981 million, Stanford
has purchased domestic and interna
tional equities, made fixed income in
vestments, and invested in venture
capital. Pretty exciting stuff, eh?
That's what I thought as I sat across
from University Treasurer Rod
Adams at the Stanford Investment
office on Hamilton Street in Palo
Alto. But, as I soon found out, invest
ments that sound boring can turn out
to be exciting money makers.
• "We here at Stanford Investments
are charged with the task of investing
the University's endowment money
and making sure it maintains its real
value," Adams said. When donors
endow money, they don't want to find
out that it has all disappeared in a few

years. This means that hot tubs and
Jaguars are out and domestic equities
and venture capital are in.
Deciding just how much of these
things are in is Stanford Investments'
main job. In the office, there are a
number of people qualified in a wide
variety of areas. Some, like Adams,
specialize in venture capital. Others
specialize in domestic equities, or
fixed income investments, or real
estate.
Each specialist has a good idea of
how well their area is expected to fare
over the short and long run. Depend
ing on these forecasts, Stanford In
vestments decides where to put its
money. Harry Turner, a bond special
ist (bonds are loans to companies
which pay interest, greater than that
paid by banks, and are considered a
"fixed income" investment), ex
plained how his recent projections in
fluenced the overall strategy of the
office.
"It is my personal responsibility to
look for what the bond market is ex
pected to do," he said. "The bond
market today is excellent — better
than most of the past 100 years. It is
offering a very high real rate of
return."
Adams concurred, adding, "What
is more, the stock market cycle is well
advanced. Because of this, we hope to
take some of the money we currently
have in stocks (domestic equities) and
move it into bonds. This adjustment
will protect us over the next year."
Stanford, as of Sept. 30, 1985, had
about 48 percent of the $981 million
endowment invested in domestic
equities. Because of the new projec

tions, plans call for 9 percent of the
endowment to be moved from
domestic equities into domestic and
international fixed income (bonds).
This will leave about 25 percent in
domestic fixed income and 5 percent
in international fixed income.
Stanford Investments does not ac
tually decide which stocks to sell or
which bonds to buy. That task is left
up to outside managers. In the case of
bonds, Rosenberg Capital Manage
ment in San Francisco makes all the
decisions. Stanford Investments
chose to delegate the responsibility to
Rosenberg because of its excellent
performance in the past.
Of course, there are many instruc
tions given to managers investing
money for the University. Rosenberg
Capital Management is instructed
with respect to the credit quality of
the bond (companies that might go
broke have low credit ratings), the
yield of the bond (how much interest
is being paid, and the maturity date)
and when the principal will be
returned.
Stanford Investments keeps a
watchful eye on all its managers. Risk
and performance are two things the
office watches closely. Investing in
many risky companies may offer the
possibility of high returns but may
also put a large portion of the Univer
sity's endowment in jeopardy.
