# Funds proposed for global studies
## 
### ANDREW CROSBY 
Gov. George Deukmejian recently recom
mended that $480,000 in state funds be directed
toward the California International Studies Proj
ect. The project is intended to fight the high level of
"global illiteracy" that persists among California's
schoolchildren.
This joint effort between state government, uni
versities and community would aim at establishing
a network of international studies resource centers,
with centers to be based in various colleges and
universities throughout California. The project was
introduced in the last session of the California
Legislature by Assemblyman Sam Farr (D-
Carmel).
According to Ron Herring, associate director of
Stanford's Center for Research in International

Studies (CRIS) and one of the program's strongest
supporters, the centers will be designed "to support
the teacher who would like to learn and grow and
become more skilled."
Proponents of the plan hope to establish six
resource centers initially and then to raise this
number to 18 over a three-year period.
Each resource center would provide teachers
from surrounding school districts with training de
signed to improve both their methods of teaching
and their own understanding in areas such as inter
national studies, foreign language and economics.
Herring said that while the governor's recom
mendation is significant, it does not guarantee state
participation in the project. The recommendation
must still be reviewed by program and finance com
mittees in the Senate and Assembly.
However, the allocation of state funds seems

likely provided a major shortfall in state revenues
does not occur before the budget bill is sent to the
governor. Furthermore, Herring said. "There has
been a recent groundswell of statewide support for
the program" emanating from diverse elements
within the community.
In expectation of funding approval, the state De
partment of Education is preparing a request for
proposals from four-year colleges and universities
wishing to manage the project. Selection for this
position is the first in a number of steps necessary
to initiate the project in September.
Stanford intends to submit an application in
hopes of being chosen as the managing institution
for the program. According to Herring, the Univer
sity is the ideal candidate for this position. The
