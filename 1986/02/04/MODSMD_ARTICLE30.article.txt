## Pac-10 race up for grabs 
### 
Welcome to the midway point of the Pacific 10
Conference basketball season, and a special
welcome to the Stanford Cardinal, which finds itself
in third place after nine games.
Sure, the Cardinal is tied with Oregon State and
California for third, and sure, its 5-4 conference
record is barely above the mediocrity of the .500
mark. But who woulda thunk it'd happen wit dem
guys?
And who would've expected the Cardinal to
defeat UCLA and Oregon State on consecutive
weekends, with the OSU win coming in Corvallis?

Stanford to finish ninth this year.

And seemingly not the Stanford fans, who
behaved with exemplary politeness as the Cardinal
was in the process of knocking off the Bruins in
Maples Pavilion a couple of weeks ago. They
couldn't even fill Maples for the game, then
proceeded to sit quietly through the victory and exit
quietly afterward.
Maybe there was an excuse — a team with a 2-4
conference record at the time that had just lost at
home to Oregon, the worst team in the Pac-10. But
there is none now. For whatever reason — be it the
greatness of the Cardinal, the lack of greatness of
the Pac-10, or both — Stanford is in the middle of
the conference race.
This week the newly resurgent Cardinal hosts a
pair of games — against Arizona State on Thursday
and Arizona on Saturday. There is no excuse for
subdued crowds anymore, especially when the
Wildcats visit Saturday.
Arizona is coming off a 13-point upset win at
conference-leading Washington this weekend, and
is the only Pac-10 team to receive a vote in the As
sociated Press Top 20 poll. On top of it all, Tucson's
McKale Center is the toughest Pac-10 arena Stan
ford's had to play in to date, and that crowd cer-
