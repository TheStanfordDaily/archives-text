## Pac-10 race up for grabs 
### 
Welcome to the midway point of the Pacific 10
Conference basketball season, and a special
welcome to the Stanford Cardinal, which finds itself
in third place after nine games.
Sure, the Cardinal is tied with Oregon State and
California for third, and sure, its 5-4 conference
record is barely above the mediocrity of the .500
mark. But who woulda thunk it'd happen wit dem
guys?
And who would've expected the Cardinal to
defeat UCLA and Oregon State on consecutive
weekends, with the OSU win coming in Corvallis?
Certainly not the conference coaches, who picked
Stanford to finish ninth this year.

And seemingly not the Stanford fans, who
behaved with exemplary politeness as the Cardinal
was in the process of knocking off the Bruins in
Maples Pavilion a couple of weeks ago. They
couldn't even fill Maples for the game, then
proceeded to sit quietly through the victory and exit
quietly afterward.
Maybe there was an excuse — a team with a 2-4
conference record at the time that had just lost at
home to Oregon, the worst team in the Pac-10. But
there is none now. For whatever reason — be it the
greatness of the Cardinal, the lack of greatness of
the Pac-10, or both — Stanford is in the middle of
the conference race.
This week the newly resurgent Cardinal hosts a
pair of games — against Arizona State on Thursday
and Arizona on Saturday. There is no excuse for
subdued crowds anymore, especially when the
Wildcats visit Saturday.
Arizona is coming off a 13-point upset win at
conference-leading Washington this weekend, and
is the only Pac-10 team to receive a vote in the As
sociated Press Top 20 poll. On top of it all, Tucson's
McKale Center is the toughest Pac-10 arena Stan
ford's had to play in to date, and that crowd cer-


JOHN LIS
tainly didn't hurt the Wildcats in
defeating the Cardinal last month,
77-69.
But, still, you gotta admit. . .
What's disappointing about the
Cardinal's surprising climb into the
Pac-10's first division is the lack of
outstanding company. It's like going
to a departmental sherry hour when
only the TA's show up.
The Pac-10 is not an outstanding
basketball conference this season. It
is a balanced conference. It is a com
petitive conference. It is an interest
ing conference. It is an unpredictable
conference. It is an exciting confer
ence. But it is not a good conference.
Look at the AP Top 20 in this sec
tion. Look for a Pac-10 team. None
there. Arizona is the only team to get
a vote this week — one vote. Good
for a tie with Cleveland State and
Pepperdine for 39th.
The conference's performance in
the NCAA tournament hasn't been
anything exciting, either. Four teams
in the tournament last year. An 0-4

record. The conference hasn't been
above .500 in the tournament since
1980.
And the highlight of last year's
postseason was when UCLA won the
National Invitational Tournament
with a victory over Indiana, the
seventh-place team in the Big Ten.
With the NCAA now taking 64 teams
for its tournament, that means that
UCLA was undisputably one of the
top 65 teams in America.
Still, Oregon State Coach Ralph
Miller believes that the NCAA will
take three teams from the Pac-10 this
year. And from where it is right now,
the Cardinal has as good a shot as
anyone to be that third team.
Predict not, lest ye eat crow
Every year, the Pac-10 coaches are
asked to predict how the conference
race will finish. Their preseason
choices show just how unpredictable
this league is.
League-leader Washington was
indeed chosen to finish first. Second
place Arizona, however, was picked
eighth, and third-place Stanford was
picked ninth.
At the other end, ninth-place
Arizona State was tabbed to finish

second. The Sun Devils have been
plagued by absent players for aca
demic and other reasons, but that
seems part of the routine in Tempe.
Predictions from here? No way.
Not even on Stanford. We're talking
about a team that has beaten Oregon
State in Corvallis, dealt Arizona State
its only loss all season in Tempe,
beaten UCLA, and, of course, lost at
home to Oregon. If you figure it out,
tell me.

Granted Eugene, Ore., isn't a very
big place, and there aren't that many
flights out of the place. So that ex
plains why Stanford's plane out of
Oregon Sunday was so packed.
Included on the flight were the Cal
basketball team, leaving after its loss
to Oregon on Sunday, with Coach
Lou Campenelli; Dick Kuchen, the
former Cal coach whom Campenelli
replaced, who is now a commentator
for Lorimar, which televised the
Stanford-Oregon State game Sunday;
two of the officials who worked that
game, including the ever-popular
Booker Turner; and, of course, the
Stanford team.

the Pac-10, or both — Stanford is in the middle of
the conference race.
This week the newly resurgent Cardinal hosts a
pair of games — against Arizona State on Thursday
and Arizona on Saturday. There is no excuse for
subdued crowds anymore, especially when the
Wildcats visit Saturday.
Arizona is coming off a 13-point upset win at
conference-leading Washington this weekend, and
is the only Pac-10 team to receive a vote in the As
sociated Press Top 20 poll. On top of it all, Tucson's
McKale Center is the toughest Pac-10 arena Stan
ford's had to play in to date, and that crowd cer-

tainly didn't hurt the Wildcats in
defeating the Cardinal last month,
77-69.
But, still, you gotta admit. . .
What's disappointing about the
Cardinal's surprising climb into the
Pac-10's first division is the lack of
outstanding company. It's like going
to a departmental sherry hour when
only the TA's show up.
The Pac-10 is not an outstanding
basketball conference this season. It
is a balanced conference. It is a com
petitive conference. It is an interest
ing conference. It is an unpredictable
conference. It is an exciting confer
ence. But it is not a good conference.
Look at the AP Top 20 in this sec
tion. Look for a Pac-10 team. None
there. Arizona is the only team to get
a vote this week — one vote. Good
for a tie with Cleveland State and
Pepperdine for 39th.
The conference's performance in
the NCAA tournament hasn't been
anything exciting, either. Four teams
in the tournament last year. An 0-4

record. The conference hasn't been
above .500 in the tournament since
1980.
And the highlight of last year's
postseason was when UCLA won the
National Invitational Tournament
with a victory over Indiana, the
seventh-place team in the Big Ten.
With the NCAA now taking 64 teams
for its tournament, that means that
UCLA was undisputably one of the
top 65 teams in America.
Still, Oregon State Coach Ralph
Miller believes that the NCAA will
take three teams from the Pac-10 this
year. And from where it is right now,
the Cardinal has as good a shot as
anyone to be that third team.
Predict not, lest ye eat crow
Every year, the Pac-10 coaches are
asked to predict how the conference
race will finish. Their preseason
choices show just how unpredictable
this league is.
League-leader Washington was
indeed chosen to finish first. Second
place Arizona, however, was picked
eighth, and third-place Stanford was
picked ninth.
At the other end, ninth-place
Arizona State was tabbed to finish

second. The Sun Devils have been
plagued by absent players for aca
demic and other reasons, but that
seems part of the routine in Tempe.
Predictions from here? No way.
Not even on Stanford. We're talking
about a team that has beaten Oregon
State in Corvallis, dealt Arizona State
its only loss all season in Tempe,
beaten UCLA, and, of course, lost at
home to Oregon. If you figure it out,
tell me.

Granted Eugene, Ore., isn't a very
big place, and there aren't that many
flights out of the place. So that ex
plains why Stanford's plane out of
Oregon Sunday was so packed.
Included on the flight were the Cal
basketball team, leaving after its loss
to Oregon on Sunday, with Coach
Lou Campenelli; Dick Kuchen, the
former Cal coach whom Campenelli
replaced, who is now a commentator
for Lorimar, which televised the
Stanford-Oregon State game Sunday;
two of the officials who worked that
game, including the ever-popular
Booker Turner; and, of course, the
Stanford team.
Welcome to the midway point of the Pacific 10
Conference basketball season, and a special
welcome to the Stanford Cardinal, which finds itself
in third place after nine games.
Sure, the Cardinal is tied with Oregon State and
California for third, and sure, its 5-4 conference
record is barely above the mediocrity of the .500
mark. But who woulda thunk it'd happen wit dem
guys?
And who would've expected the Cardinal to
defeat UCLA and Oregon State on consecutive
weekends, with the OSU win coming in Corvallis?
Certainly not the conference coaches, who picked
Stanford to finish ninth this year.

And seemingly not the Stanford fans, who
behaved with exemplary politeness as the Cardinal
was in the process of knocking off the Bruins in
Maples Pavilion a couple of weeks ago. They
couldn't even fill Maples for the game, then
proceeded to sit quietly through the victory and exit
quietly afterward.
Maybe there was an excuse — a team with a 2-4
conference record at the time that had just lost at
home to Oregon, the worst team in the Pac-10. But
there is none now. For whatever reason — be it the
greatness of the Cardinal, the lack of greatness of
the Pac-10, or both — Stanford is in the middle of
the conference race.
