# Freshman Lichti leads surprising Card
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Staff writer 
Todd Lichti has set some simple but
lofty goals for himself.
"I just want to be the best player I can
be, make it into the pros. I guess be an Ail-
American, but be an Ail-American on a
winning team," he says.
Stanford fans are especially hopeful that
the 6-foot-4 freshman will meet the last
goal — bringing a winning team to the
Farm. Indeed, a lot of expectations are res
ting on the play of Lichti and fellow fresh
man standout Howard Wright.
But if Lichti feels any pressure at being
the future of Stanford basketball, it doesn't
show.
"Todd has been besieged by publicity,
but it doesn't seem to bother him," Stan
ford Coach Tom Davis said. "He takes it in
stride, and it doesn't change him."
"At first the pressure was there, playing
in front of all the people, but as time went
on, it got easier," Lichti said. "I wouldn't
say it's a big problem. You just go out
every night and play your game."
And when Lichti just goes out and plays
his game, he does some very impressive
things.

So far this season, he is averaging 16.5
points and 4.6 rebounds per game (16.7
and 3.9 in the Pacific 10 Conference
season), with single-game highs of 30 and
seven, respectively.
His scoring average and torrid .561 field
goal percentage are both in the top five in
the Pac-10.
With an arsenal ranging from net
seeking jump shots to ferocious drives
through the key, Lichti has clearly estab
lished himself as the big gun of the Card
inal offense.
None of this has come as a surprise to
Davis, who sees more good things ahead
for Lichti.
"The coaches felt Todd would be a force
for us," Davis said. "He didn't start at the
beginning of the season because not start
ing takes a lot of pressure off. But it
became clear that both he and Howard
(Wright) deserved to start."
Lichti's high school career made it quite
clear that he would be a force in college.
Playing for Mt. Diablo High School in his
hometown of Concord, Lichti was team
captain and MVP for three years running.
His senior year, he rang up 24.1 points, 12
rebounds and five assists per game, ear
ning first team All-State honors. Lichti

also qualified for the state track finals in
three events (long jump, triple jump and
400-meter dash), and was named East Bay
Athlete of the Year.
The Long Beach Press Telegram named
Lichti the sixth-best player in the West,
and last summer he was chosen for the
West squad of the National Sports Festival
(one of only two high school players placed
on the team).
With a 3.98 grade point average, Lichti
was the perfect athlete for Stanford. And it
seems that Stanford was the perfect school
for Lichti.
"I got offers from most of the Pac-10
schools, but it all seemed to come together
here," Lichti said. "1 like the coaches, the
people are great, the atmosphere is laid
back and the education is hard to pass
up."
Lichti also relished the idea of helping
develop a winning tradition at Stanford.
"I thought I could help the team, help
build a better program here," he said.
His teammates already appreciate
Lichti's contributions to the Cardinal.
"Todd has proven that he s one of the
most important facets of our team," junior
Novian Whitsitt said. "Besides his obvious
shooting ability, he's a great rebounder

and a solid defensive player in our zone
defense.
Lichti first played organized basketball
in first grade, but growing up in an athletic
family with three brothers (two older), he
undoubtedly touched the roundball a few
years before that.
His many years of playing probably ac
count for his confidence, which Lichti con
siders one of his greatest strengths.
"My confidence is a strong point,
knowing that I can do it. I know I can go
out and play with anybody," he said.
But while Lichti is confident, there
doesn't seem to be any danger of him be
coming complacent.
"I'm sure Todd has his goals set very
high. He'll be his own worst critic," Davis
said.
Davis said Lichti has "just scratched the
surface of his talent."
"He's got a lot of room for improve
ment," Davis said. "He's got to develop
the team things — passing, screening, cut
ting off screens, using his teammates —
and the defensive things."
And what if Lichti develops all those
things?
Davis has confidence in his freshman.
"He has a chance to achieve greatness."

beginning of the season because not start
ing takes a lot of pressure off. But it
became clear that both he and Howard
(Wright) deserved to start."
Lichti's high school career made it quite
clear that he would be a force in college.
Playing for Mt. Diablo High School in his
hometown of Concord, Lichti was team
captain and MVP for three years running.
His senior year, he rang up 24.1 points, 12
rebounds and five assists per game, ear
ning first team All-State honors. Lichti

also qualified for the state track finals in
three events (long jump, triple jump and
400-meter dash), and was named East Bay
Athlete of the Year.
The Long Beach Press Telegram named
Lichti the sixth-best player in the West,
and last summer he was chosen for the
West squad of the National Sports Festival
(one of only two high school players placed
on the team).
With a 3.98 grade point average, Lichti
was the perfect athlete for Stanford. And it
seems that Stanford was the perfect school
for Lichti.
"I got offers from most of the Pac-10
schools, but it all seemed to come together
here," Lichti said. "1 like the coaches, the
people are great, the atmosphere is laid
back and the education is hard to pass
up."
Lichti also relished the idea of helping
develop a winning tradition at Stanford.
"I thought I could help the team, help
build a better program here," he said.
His teammates already appreciate
Lichti's contributions to the Cardinal.
"Todd has proven that he s one of the
most important facets of our team," junior
Novian Whitsitt said. "Besides his obvious
shooting ability, he's a great rebounder

and a solid defensive player in our zone
defense.
Lichti first played organized basketball
in first grade, but growing up in an athletic
family with three brothers (two older), he
undoubtedly touched the roundball a few
years before that.
His many years of playing probably ac
count for his confidence, which Lichti con
siders one of his greatest strengths.
"My confidence is a strong point,
knowing that I can do it. I know I can go
out and play with anybody," he said.
But while Lichti is confident, there
doesn't seem to be any danger of him be
coming complacent.
"I'm sure Todd has his goals set very
high. He'll be his own worst critic," Davis
said.
Davis said Lichti has "just scratched the
surface of his talent."
"He's got a lot of room for improve
ment," Davis said. "He's got to develop
the team things — passing, screening, cut
ting off screens, using his teammates —
and the defensive things."
And what if Lichti develops all those
things?
Davis has confidence in his freshman.
"He has a chance to achieve greatness."

Todd Lichti, the heavily recruited swingman from Concord, has played a key role in Stanford's turnaround from last year's finish in the Pac-10 cellar.

Todd Lichti has set some simple but
lofty goals for himself.
"I just want to be the best player I can
be, make it into the pros. I guess be an Ail-
American, but be an Ail-American on a
winning team," he says.
Stanford fans are especially hopeful that
the 6-foot-4 freshman will meet the last
goal — bringing a winning team to the
Farm. Indeed, a lot of expectations are res
ting on the play of Lichti and fellow fresh
man standout Howard Wright.
But if Lichti feels any pressure at being
the future of Stanford basketball, it doesn't
show.
"Todd has been besieged by publicity,
but it doesn't seem to bother him," Stan
ford Coach Tom Davis said. "He takes it in
stride, and it doesn't change him."
"At first the pressure was there, playing
in front of all the people, but as time went
on, it got easier," Lichti said. "I wouldn't
say it's a big problem. You just go out
every night and play your game."
And when Lichti just goes out and plays
his game, he does some very impressive
things.

So far this season, he is averaging 16.5
points and 4.6 rebounds per game (16.7
and 3.9 in the Pacific 10 Conference
season), with single-game highs of 30 and
seven, respectively.
His scoring average and torrid .561 field
goal percentage are both in the top five in
the Pac-10.
With an arsenal ranging from net
seeking jump shots to ferocious drives
through the key, Lichti has clearly estab
lished himself as the big gun of the Card
inal offense.
None of this has come as a surprise to
Davis, who sees more good things ahead
for Lichti.
"The coaches felt Todd would be a force
for us," Davis said. "He didn't start at the
beginning of the season because not start
ing takes a lot of pressure off. But it
became clear that both he and Howard
(Wright) deserved to start."
