# Unbeaten batsmen to host Dons
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
Stanford's baseball team doesn't
have San Jose State to kick around
anymore.
After recording three wins in three
tries against the Spartans over the last
week and a half, the Cardinal, 3-0 on
the year, will have to try its hand
against some different competition.
Not necessarily better competition,
just different.
At Sunken Diamond today at 2
p.m. the Cardinal hosts the Univer
sity of San Francisco. Last year, the
Dons finished 22-28 overall and fifth
in the West Coast Athletic Confer
ence with a 9-15 mark.
Even though last year's USF team
didn't raise many eyebrows, things
have gotten worse for the Dons. Chris
Kroener, last year's WCAC leading
hitter with a .411 batting average,
was lost to graduation, as were Wade
Giesen, .343 with 28 RBI, and Dave
Sheldon, .339 with 16 homers and 64
RBI.
That doesn't leave much. There's
third baseman Ray McDonald, .301
with 23 RBI, and outfielder Rich
Herbert, .287 with four homers and
27 RBI, but that's about it.
USFs sixth-year Coach Ken Bow
man hopes to make up for the lack of
pop in his lineup with basepath trick
ery. "Team speed is our greatest as
set," Bowman said. Infielder Angelo
Martin is the Dons' leading returning
base stealer with 115 thefts last year.
Bowman may be able to com
pensate for his team's punchless bats
with strategy, but when it comes to
pitching, there isn't much he can do.
It's a choice between Paul Bartkey, 0-
3 last year with a 4.70 ERA, and
George Kanto, 3-7 and 6.30.
Bowman hadn't announced who
would have a chance to face Stan
ford's lineup today.
Cardinal Coach Mark Marquess,
on the other hand, has already given
junior A 1 Osuna today's start. Osuna
pitched 5 1/3 innings of shutout relief
to earn a win against SJSU just over a
week ago.

Osuna's back on the Farm after
spending his sophomore year down
south at Cerritos Junior College.
There he compiled a 10-1 record and
led his team to the California state
championship.
Stanford Asst. Coach Dean Stotz,
for one, has noticed a change in
Osuna's pitching.
"He's definitely improved, but I
don't know if it's his work in Los An
geles," Stotz said. "I think it's a natu
ral course of maturity with Al."
In any case, Stotz wanted to play
some baseball, especially after the
recent rash of rain. "We just want to
play," he said. "We need a chance to
look at a number of pitchers and get
some definition of just how they're
doing."
Card notes
Stotz said he expects Stanford's
bats to come alive soon.
The Cardinal has scored 21 runs in
its three games. Last year, the team
averaged 9.8 runs per game. Stanford
has also been outhit in two of its three
games so far.
"I think we're going to be a much
better hitting team than we've
shown," Stotz said. "On the other
hand, we'll score plenty of runs even
though we don't get a lot of hits."
Stanford's pitching staff hasn't
allowed a run in 18 innings. That
counts Jack McDowell's nine shutout
innings Saturday and the last nine in
nings of Stanford's 13-inning 8-6 win
against SJSU on Jan. 25.
Much of Stanford's lineup has yet
to produce as expected. But catcher
John Ramos and left fielder Walt
Harris have been on fire. Harris has
at least two hits in each of Stanford's
three games, going 7-of-13 on the
year. Besides his .538 batting
average, Harris is five-for-five when
stealing bases.
Ramos, the cleanup hitter, has at
least one RBI in every game to go
with his .400 batting average (6-for
-15).

tries against the Spartans over the last
week and a half, the Cardinal, 3-0 on
the year, will have to try its hand
against some different competition.
Not necessarily better competition,
just different.
At Sunken Diamond today at 2
p.m. the Cardinal hosts the Univer
sity of San Francisco. Last year, the
Dons finished 22-28 overall and fifth
in the West Coast Athletic Confer
ence with a 9-15 mark.
Even though last year's USF team
didn't raise many eyebrows, things
have gotten worse for the Dons. Chris
Kroener, last year's WCAC leading
hitter with a .411 batting average,
was lost to graduation, as were Wade
Giesen, .343 with 28 RBI, and Dave
Sheldon, .339 with 16 homers and 64
RBI.
That doesn't leave much. There's
third baseman Ray McDonald, .301
with 23 RBI, and outfielder Rich
Herbert, .287 with four homers and
27 RBI, but that's about it.
USFs sixth-year Coach Ken Bow
man hopes to make up for the lack of
pop in his lineup with basepath trick
ery. "Team speed is our greatest as
set," Bowman said. Infielder Angelo
Martin is the Dons' leading returning
base stealer with 115 thefts last year.
Bowman may be able to com
pensate for his team's punchless bats
with strategy, but when it comes to
pitching, there isn't much he can do.
It's a choice between Paul Bartkey, 0-
3 last year with a 4.70 ERA, and
George Kanto, 3-7 and 6.30.
Bowman hadn't announced who
would have a chance to face Stan
ford's lineup today.
Cardinal Coach Mark Marquess,
on the other hand, has already given
junior A 1 Osuna today's start. Osuna
pitched 5 1/3 innings of shutout relief
to earn a win against SJSU just over a
week ago.

Osuna's back on the Farm after
spending his sophomore year down
south at Cerritos Junior College.
There he compiled a 10-1 record and
led his team to the California state
championship.
Stanford Asst. Coach Dean Stotz,
for one, has noticed a change in
Osuna's pitching.
"He's definitely improved, but I
don't know if it's his work in Los An
geles," Stotz said. "I think it's a natu
ral course of maturity with Al."
In any case, Stotz wanted to play
some baseball, especially after the
recent rash of rain. "We just want to
play," he said. "We need a chance to
look at a number of pitchers and get
some definition of just how they're
doing."
Card notes
Stotz said he expects Stanford's
bats to come alive soon.
The Cardinal has scored 21 runs in
its three games. Last year, the team
averaged 9.8 runs per game. Stanford
has also been outhit in two of its three
games so far.
"I think we're going to be a much
better hitting team than we've
shown," Stotz said. "On the other
hand, we'll score plenty of runs even
though we don't get a lot of hits."
Stanford's pitching staff hasn't
allowed a run in 18 innings. That
counts Jack McDowell's nine shutout
innings Saturday and the last nine in
nings of Stanford's 13-inning 8-6 win
against SJSU on Jan. 25.
Much of Stanford's lineup has yet
to produce as expected. But catcher
John Ramos and left fielder Walt
Harris have been on fire. Harris has
at least two hits in each of Stanford's
three games, going 7-of-13 on the
year. Besides his .538 batting
average, Harris is five-for-five when
stealing bases.
Ramos, the cleanup hitter, has at
least one RBI in every game to go
with his .400 batting average (6-for
-15).

Lee Plemel will finally get to see something besides San Jose State batters tomorrow
when the Cardinal takes on San Francisco. Stanford's first three games, all wins, were
against SJSU.
