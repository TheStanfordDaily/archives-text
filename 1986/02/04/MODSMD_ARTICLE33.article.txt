# No. 1 netters to face SJSU
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Three years ago, Stanford Coach Dick Gould's
tennis team featured four whiz-kid recruits. Fresh
men John Letts, Dan Goldie, Eric Rosenfeld and
Jim Grabb led the upstart Cardinal team to the
1983 NCAA National Championship, defeating
No. 1-ranked Southern Methodist by a 5-2 score.
During the celebration on the courts in Athens,
Ga., Rosenfeld summed up the key to the season:
"We had no real pressure on us from the start. We
were just happy to be here and we were ready to
play."
As Stanford prepares to open its 1986 season
today with a 2 p.m. match at San Jose, those four
players are all seniors, and this time they do have
the pressure of being the top-ranked teaman the na
tion.
"We have everyone back from last year except
Derrick Rostagno, who joined the pro circuit,"
Gould said yesterday."And we'll miss him. But we
have the four seniors who won it all as freshman,
finished a close second as sophomores and had a
shot to win last year."
That shot ended abruptly as the Cardinal bowed
out to host Georgia in the second round of the
NCAA tournament.
"We were disappointed in our tourney perfor
mance last year, and I think that loss gave us some
extra resolve to win it this year," Gould said. "We
have a nucleus of five experienced starters, and 1
think our doubles teams will be much improved."
The four seniors may also feel some extra pres
sure to repeat the feat of their freshman year.
"Psychology will be a key for us â€” if we play to
defend (the No. 1 ranking), we won't win," Gould
said. "Another key will be how well we can handle
adversity. If we can handle playing on slower courts,
away crowds and any injuries, then we'll be in good
shape. I think we've improved tremendously over
the off-season."
Gould is also thrilled by the high quality of col
lege tennis throughout the country this year.
"In the 19 years I've been here, this is probably
the best field of college teams I've seen," Gould
said. "The scholarship limitations (each school can
only give out a total of five scholarships, but can
split the scholarships up) have created parity. I can
see any one of eight teams winning it all this year."
"Already sixth-ranked Clemson has beaten SMU
(No. 2) and Pepperdine (No. 5), and they'll prob
ably move up to second in the next rankings,"
Gould said.
The Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Association's
pre-season poll predicts that the Cardinal will take
it all. Stanford is ranked first with 196 votes, edging
out SMU by five votes and UCLA by iO. USC and
Pepperdine round out the top five.
As far as individuals go, Stanford players repre
sent a good portion of the top players in the
country. The Cardinal has five singles players
ranked in the top 50, including Goldie at No. 2 and
Grabb at No. 3. Goldie and Grabb team up to form
the seventh-ranked doubles team, and Letts and
sophomore Patrick McEnroe make up the 13th
ranked duo.
Goldie has been Stanford's No. 1 singles player
for the past two years and held the top ranking in
the nation throughout most of last year. This year,
however, he'll be pushed by teammate Grabb.
After Goldie and Grabb, the third,
fourth, and fifth spots will probably
be filled by Rosenfeld, Letts and
McEnroe, though not necessarily in
that order.
Rosenfeld enters the season with a
singles ranking of 27. The senior from
Media, Penn., posted a 21-6 dual
meet in 1985, and according to
Gould, has "improved his serve and
volley game to complement his out
standing ground strokes."
Letts is ranked 38th in singles and
is coming off a unique fall season. He
attended Stanford's overseas pro
gram in Tours, France and planned to
take it easy as far as tennis went. The
court beckoned, however, and the
senior ended up playing the
European satellite circuit, defeating
five players ranked in the world's top
200.
Finally, McEnroe was the hottest
player at the end of the season last
year. The sophomore won 18 out of
his final 19 matches, and holds the
49th ranking in the country.
Juniors Mark Jacobson and Scott
Moody will vie for the sixth singles
spot. Both will play tomorrow against
San Jose State, because Grabb will sit
out.
Junior Andy Sands and freshman
Curtis Dunn round out Stanford's ten
man roster.
Stanford will face a SJSU squad
today that has improved its stock of
players since last season. The Spar
tans welcome four transfer students
from Foothill Junior College, which
won the junior college national cham
pionship last year.
