Skiing
Sunday's snowstorm in the Sier
ras made for poor visibility on the
roads. On the ski slopes of Echo
Summit, however, one thing was
clear: with only three weeks until
the National Collegiate Ski Associ
ation Championships, the women
of the Stanford Ski Team needed
fast finishes to retain their top spot
in the league.
Second-ranked California looked
tough in the slalom, but the Stan
ford women hung on for a crucial
win. Liz Atkinson placed first, fol
lowed by seniors Mardi Dier and
Katherine Strickler, who finished
fifth and eighth. Freshmen Shelley
St. Laurent and Kari Bohlke ex
emplified the team's extraordinary
depth, both finishing in the top 10.
Sophomore Alex Weiher came in
14th.
In the men's competition, Stan
ford's A-Team finished third, be
hind Sierra and Berkeley. Sopho
more Tim Nolan, with two aggres
sive runs, took sixth place overall,
followed by senior Griff Steiner in
12th, RincaDelts Brad Swett and
Chip Hazard in 13th and 16th, and
Mark Handley in 19th.
On Saturday, in one of the rare
B-Team races, the Cardinal men
had only one finisher, but Stan
ford's women finished first.
Capturing first and second place
for the B-Women, were veterans
Mary Boyce and Julie Kohnen.

Rookies Elizabeth Hoffman and
Noelle Veale came in seventh and
ninth place, respectively.
The lone finisher for the B-Men
was Dale Wang, who lost a ski on
his second run, forcing him to crawl
through the last few gates.
Badminton
Stanford's Joy Kitzmiller
captured the women's singles
championship and teamed with
former Cardinal Coach Danny
Rubin to finish second in the mixed
doubles at the Golden Bear Open
badminton tournament this
weekend at Berkeley.
Kitzmiller defeated Linda
Safaric, 11-8, 8-11, 12-10 in the
championship match of the tourna
ment, which was open to commu
nity badminton players as well as
collegiate players.
In the C division of the women's
singles, the Cardinal's Tertia Belt
reached the semi-finals before
losing.
Also participating this weekend
for Stanford were Hassan Alam,
Paul Gellert, Joe Pinter, Tim
Softley and Benjy Wincure.
"This is the first tournament of
the season and we have some new
players out," Kitzmiller said. "We
saw much improvement from
match to match. We're really
looking forward to playing in Davis
next weekend."

The competition next weekend at
the Davis Intercollegiate will not be
as tough, according to Kitzmiller,
because the field will be limited to
collegiate players. The tournament
will be important, however, as it
marks the first NorCal league
encounter for the Cardinal.
Women's Rugby
The challenge for the Cardinal
women's rugby team has not been
winning, but simply fielding enough
players.
In its last match on Jan. 25, the
Cardinal, playing shorthanded be
cause of injuries, was shut out by a
strong San Jose team. "They beat
us rather convincingly," Lisa Yan
ney said.
"San Jose is probably the best
team in the league," Anne Latham
added.
Next Saturday, Stanford hosts
Santa Cruz at Maloney Field at 11
a.m. Unfortunately, the same prob
lem that plagued the Cardinal in
the San Jose match will most likely
be evident again.
"We'll probably have to play
short again unless we can recruit
somebody," Latham said. "But we
haven't been too successful at
that."
Santa Cruz should not pose the
same threat as San Jose, however.
"I don't think they have very many
people," Latham said.
