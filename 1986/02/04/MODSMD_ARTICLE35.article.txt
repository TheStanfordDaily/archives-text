# Sailors open season

### BRANDI WATSON Staff writer 
The Stanford sailing team not
only had a great time escaping the
rain in sunny San Diego but sailed
impressively as well, placing high
in the South Series 1 and 2
Regatta this weekend.
The Cardinal finished third
overall on Saturday behind USC
and San Diego State. On Sunday it
took a close second, just one point
behind USC.
"We did fairly well," sailor
Kristen Boyles said. "The
team was pretty happy about the
whole thing."
The Stanford team'entered two
varsity boats each day in a field of
about 15 schools. On Saturday the
team of Dan Buckstaff and Susie
Pritchett took second in the A
division while Rich Bergsund and
Marika Fussganger captured third
in the B-division. Their combined
scores moved the Cardinal into
third.

"We've been having optional or
once a week practices, so we had
to get used to the boats again,"
Boyles said.
Sunday's results came down to
the last race with Stanford battling
USC for first. The Cardinal put up
a fight but was not strong enough
for the experienced Trojan team,
which took the race and the
regatta.
On Sunday, the team of Drew
Gashler and Boyles took second in
the A-division while Bergsund and
Fussganger won the B-division to
lift Stanford into second place
overall.
The Cardinal was impressive in
beating UC-Irvine, a team ranked
above it, on both days. It was es
pecially gratifying considering the
squad had no coach. Stanford
Coach Joe Petrucci, along with
coaches from other schools, was
attending a conference elsewhere.
"There was no pressure because
there were no coaches," sailor
D.J. Berinstein said. "It was fun."
