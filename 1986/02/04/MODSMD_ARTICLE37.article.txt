Mandela rejects freedom proposal
CAPE TOWN, South Africa — Winnie Mandela, wife of the im
prisoned black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela, yesterday rejected a
South African government proposal to free her husband, serving a life
sentence for sabotage, in exchange for two prominent Soviet dissidents
and a South African commando captured in Angola.
Emerging from Pollsmoor Prison here after seeing her husband,
Winnie Mandela said of the proposal: "It is not even worth reacting
to. . . . It is just part of this gigantic ploy to present the government as
human, wanting to give the people of this country and the international
community the impression that it has human considerations on political
matters, which it has not."
Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress at the time
of his arrest in 1962, was officially informed of the government proposal,
made Friday by President Pieter Botha when he opened the annual ses
sion of the South African Parliament. But Winnie Mandela said they had
not discussed it seriously.
"We have lived with this thing for far too long to attach any signifi
cance to what the government says," she said, referring to repeated sug
gestions in the past two years that the black nationalist leader, now 67,
was about to be freed.
The initial reaction among diplomats to Botha's proposal was dis
belief. Over the weekend Angola and the Soviet Union both rejected the
offer. 112
Protests threaten Haitian regime
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Deep-seated anger over widespread
unemployment, abject poverty and the extravagant life style of second
generation dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier have spilled over in brazen
displays of popular opposition in recent days in this country where public
protests once were virtually unknown.
After nearly three decades of repression by the Duvalier family,
crowds led mostly by young males in their teens or twenties have taken
to the streets even at the risk of retaliation by the state's security appara
tus. In the tiny village of St. Marc, center of some of the most persistent
protests, Haitians interviewed over the weekend were unusually out
spoken in their criticism of Duvalier's rule.
"We are suffering," a 29-year-old man said. "There is nothing here.
Nothing but unemployment. You are dead if you stay here (in Haiti)."
He added, echoing a feeling voiced by many in St. Marc: "We will
continue until he falls."
Another young man with a beard spoke in broken French:
"Everybody is against the regime.. .. Everybody feels the same. All over
the country, everyone feels the same."
These young men insisted on remaining anonymous. Their candor still
was tempered by fear of the dreaded Volunteers for National Security,
popularly known as the Ton-Tons Macoutes, or "bogeymen," in the
Creole spoken by the vast majority of the population,
Here in the capital, where the level of unrest has become an important
indicator of Duvalier's hold on power, the situation appeared to have
calmed since Friday. The president made a symbolic show of force by
riding through the downtown streets yesterday in a heavily armed
motorcade, and the government-run radio reported that cheering
crowds received him.
But the interviews in St. Marc illustrated a widespread belief that
Duvalier's days in power are numbered — in months, if not weeks —
and a popular determination to continue the protests until he does fall.
There was a widely voiced sentiment that the United States should play a
role in forcing the president from power and in setting up a democratic
form of government.
Aquino wants economic reforms
MANILA, Philippines — Presidential candidate Corazon Aquino,
calling herself "a crusading housewife" and the "unorthodox choice of
an oppressed people," told several thousand partisan business leaders
yesterday that she is not as naive and noncommittal as her critics charge.
She outlined several specific acts she would take in her first 100 days as
president.
In her last major address before Friday's special election, Aquino
sought to portray her opponent. President Ferdinand Marcos, as "a
Filipino pharaoh" who has built "a pyramid of disgrace" and kept his
people "chained to their misery" for the 20 years he has been in office.
"When Mr. Marcos began his rule in 1965, our country was touted as
the economic miracle of Asia, next only to Japan," Aquino told the
American, European and Filipino Chambers of Commerce after lunch in
Manila's Makati business district.
"Today we have earned the unflattering title of the basket case of
Southeast Asia. In 20 years Mr. Marcos has stripped legitimate
entrepreneurs of their ability to compete, and has rewarded his friends
with fiefdoms which have enabled them, like vampires, to suck the life
blood of a once-vigorous economy."
Aquino, who has no experience in government, pledged that if she was
elected she would repeal all new fuel, electricity and business turnover
taxes, make seeds and fertilizers tax-exempt to ease the plight of the
country's farmers, and dismantle government-sanctioned monopolies
run by Marcos' friends in the Philippine coconut and sugar industries.
The 53-year-old widow of Benigno Aquino Jr., the slain opposition
leader, also vowed that in her first 100 days she would reinstate the
suspended right of habeas corpus to help free hundreds of political
prisoners detained by the Marcos government, abolish Marcos' costly
Office of Media Affairs, which often dictates policy to the nation's press
and television, and streamline the armed forces so they could perform
better against an expanding Communist insurgency in the country. '
Asked after her speech how she planned to deal with the insurgency,
which reportedly involves 15,000 armed rebels in all 73 Philippine
provinces, Aquino said she would offer the rebels amnesty in exchange
for a six-month cease-fire. She said she was confident that the rebels
would agree, because "I am more trustworthy than Mr. Marcos."
"However, if they do not do so," she added, "then I will have to use the
military force on them."
OPEC fails to reach market accord
VIENNA — Oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Export
ing Countries (OPEC) meeting here yesterday failed to agree on a plan
to claim a bigger share of the world market, amid signs of increasing dis
cord within the 13-member cartel.
The meeting of a special five-nation subgroup, appointed in Decem
ber to determine OPEC's "fair share" of the declining market, is due to
meet again today.
Meanwhile, a rump meeting of hard-line OPEC dissidents Libya. Iran
and Algeria gathered in Tripoli to protest the approach taken in Decem
ber, which has sent world oil prices spiraling down 40 percent.
In the only official statement to emerge here yesterday. Venezuela's
oil minister and current OPEC president, Arturo Hernandez Grisanti.
said the organization was "aware of its responsibility in the defense of
market stability and in the interests of its members."
The prime mover behind the market strategy has been Saudi Arabia.
By last summer, the Saudis had dropped their own production to as low
as 2 million barrels a day to keep prices stable. The Saudis charge non-
OPEC member Britain has increased its North Sea production at
OPECs expense.
Meanwhile, others have moved on their own. Over the weekend, it
was reported that Nigeria intends to boost output to maximum levels to
counteract the impact of lower prices on government revenues.
Venezuela and non-OPEC member Mexico, two of Latin America's big
gest debtors, agreed to join together in a "flexible pricing and sales
policy." Mexico cut its price by $4 a barrel, and Venezuela by $3.
