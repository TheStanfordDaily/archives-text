# Soviet dissident may be freed in swap
## 
### 
BONN, West Germany â€” West
German sources confirmed yesterday
that a major spy exchange will take
place soon involving the imprisoned
Soviet dissident Anatoly
Shcharansky.
In Washington, sources within the
Reagan Administration confirmed
that a swap of some sort was in the
works but were unable to confirm
that Shcharansky would be included.
U.S. officials refused to comment
on the record concerning the reports.
Secretary of State George Shultz, in
terviewed on .ABC-TV's "Good
Morning America," said, "There is
no subject that we have worked on
harder or that I think makes more
difference to people in the West . ..
than release of dissidents in the So
viet Union."

But when asked about the reported
trade, he said, "I have no comment at
all."
White House press secretary Larry
Speakes and State Department
spokesman Charles Redman echoed
the "no comment" line.
Similarly, a West German govern
ment spokesman, Friedhelm Ost,
would only comment that, "We don't
want to say anything at the moment,"
But West German officials ad
mitted privately that a deal is in the
making.
The first hint of such an exchange
had appeared in yesterday morning's
issue of the daily Bild, which said that
it would take place within the next
few days. Reagan Administration
sources are reported to have indi
cated that a swap would take place

Feb. 11 in West Berlin. But according
to sources here, the date may be
moved forward now that the news has
been leaked by what Bild said were
"high Soviet sources."
Reporters and television teams
began making arrangements to be in
place near the Glienicke Bridge,
which crosses from East Germany
into southwest Berlin and has been
the scene of previous exchanges be
tween East and West.
The deal involving Shcharansky is
reported to have been worked out by
officials in Washington, Bonn, East
Berlin and Moscow. The West Ger
man sources that confirmed plans for
the exchange did not say how many
people are involved, but they said
that Shcharansky will be among
them.

Shcharansky, 37, a computer ex
pert and human rights activist, was
sentenced in 1978 to 13 years in
prison for allegedly working with the
Central Intelligence Agency. At the
time of his arrest, President Carter
denied that he was an American
agent. Shcharansky too denied it. He
said that his only offense was trying to
emigrate to Israel.
According to the article in Bild,
Shchraransky's health is rapidly
deteriorating.
Bild said that the Western govern
ments sought to include in the ex
change Andrei Sakharov, the Nobel
Prize-winner physicist who has been
sentenced to internal exile at Gorky.
But the Soviet authorities, Bild said,
flatly refused to allow him to leave
the countrv
