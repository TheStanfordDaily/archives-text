# Boosters suspected in shuttle disaster
## 
### 
Challenger's solid-fuel rocket
boosters, which are suspected of in
itiating the explosion that destroyed
the spacecraft, were so near their
minimum allowable temperature just
before launch that investigators are
now trying to determine if freezing
temperature played a role in the acci
dent.
Specifications for launching the
shuttle call for. the internal tempera
ture of the rocket structure and
propellent to be between 40 and 90
degrees Fahrenheit, according to
technical data provided by Morton
Thiokol, manufacturer of the solid
rocket.
The air temperature on the eve of
the launch at the Kennedy Space
Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla.,
reached a low of 24 degrees. The
temperature at launch was 32
degrees. But the rockets are 12 feet

thick and the rubbery rocket propel
lent is a good thermal insulator, so
the internal temperature changes
very slowly.
Nevertheless, the boosters sat
outside in the cold so long that inves
tigators are now examining whether
key portions of the rockets may have
fallen below the minimum specifica
tions, according to a Morton Thiokol
expert at Kennedy Space Center.
Officials of Morton Thiokol, based
in Brigham, Utah, denied that the
shuttle was launched when internal
rocket temperatures were below al
lowable limits. "There is no chance it
could have been near 40 degrees,"
said Gil Moore, director of external
relations for Thiokol.
There have been persistent reports
that Rockwell officials advised
NASA last Tuesday morning, just
before the Challenger launch, to

delay the mission because of weather
conditions.
Other theories of what caused the
rocket motor malfunction concern
faulty seams, flawed casings and
poorly packed fuel.
"Also, CBS reported last night that
a former solid rocket test engineer,
Richard White, said the reusable
rockets have a history of cracks and
corrosion problems in their aft skirts,
the large structure on the rocket that
rests on the launchpad.
The theory that cold weather
played a role is being considered by
teams at both Kennedy Space Center
and Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala.
Temperatures below design limits
may cause solid fuel to crack or sepa
rate from the case of the rocket, re
sulting in a possible burn-through of
the case, a Marshall expert told the

Los Angeles Times.
One of the booster rockets is
thought to have experienced such a
burn-through of its outer wall, send
ing a white hot plume of flame against
shuttle's exterior fuel tank, which
contained hydrogen and oxygen, or
detonating an explosive self-destruct
device. The latest evidence suggests
that the self-destruct device was
detonated, according to Marshall in
vestigators.
Moore said the internal tempera
ture changes very slowly because the
solid rockets contain one million
pounds of propellent, a significant
mass that would take "hours if not
days" to drop below 40 degrees.
NASA declined a Times request to
provide additional information re
garding temperatures, saying that all
such information had been im
pounded by the investigation team.
