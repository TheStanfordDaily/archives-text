# Rights forum is planned

### STEVE STREED Staff writer 
The newly formed Committee to
Humanize Stanford, which met for
the first time Jan. 24. has announced
plans for an April "Humanizing Stan
ford" forum in which community
members will discuss the administra
tion's relationship to faculty, stafl and
student concerns.
ASSU Senator Joel Bellenson, who
helped found the committee and co
authored a petition last tall to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
calling for a University-wide forum in
which community members could air
their differences and approach solu
tions to campus issues, is hoping

Humanizing Stanford will serve to
remedy what he pereeives as a
"communication breakdown" be
tween the administration and the
community.
"We felt that the University has a
policy of respecting human rights as
stated in a number of places (in Uni
versity publications) . . . and we felt
that there were a lot of cases when
the University has violated . . . the
principal of human rights," Bellenson
said.
The forum will deal with University
employee-employer relations, includ
ing the University's relationship to
the United Stanford Workers union
(USW), the University's relation to
minorities, police harassment and

governing bodies within the Univer
sity such as the ASSU, Bellenson
said.
William Massy, vice president for
Business and Finance, is one of the
University officials expected to take
part in the forum.
"I don't think (that the University
has) . . . violated the principles of
human rights at any time, and I don't
think (University) President
(Donald) Kennedy thinks so either,"
Massy said.
Kennedy, who has also agreed to
participate in the forum, was not
available for comment yesterday.
The committee hopes to have both
Massy and Kennedy present at the
forum, as well as Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons and a member of
the Board of Trustees, Bellenson
said.
While both Kennedy and Massy in
tend to participate in the forum, the
Dean of Student Affairs' Office is
unsure whether Lyons will participate
in the forum.
Bellenson said there is a pattern to
the way in which the University acts
in relation to certain community
groups and that the administration
has not been "doing what it should"
with respect to these groups.
Massy said the administration has
in the past respected individual
groups within the University commu
nity and that he thinks the adminis
tration's policies are "enlightened."
Bellenson said that the University's
stance on the collective bargaining of
USW is one of several "serious devia
tions from principles of human
rights."
Massy did not comment on
whether the University's relation to

its workers was a serious deviation
from principles of human rights.
Bellenson said that he thought the
alleged beating by police of senior
Robby Perkins during an anti
apartheid sit-in Oct. 11 was one ex
ample of the divisiveness he thinks
the committee feels exists in the Uni
versity.
Massy did not comment on the al
leged police brutality.
Massy said that USW talks were
being held when he agreed to partici
pate in the forum and that he thought
then that the relation of the Univer
sity to its employees would be dis
cussed in the forum.
Mary Ann Tenuto, a member of
the staff council of USW, said that the
USW welcomed a chance to partici
pate in the forum. USW already
knows which of its members will be in
the forum, she said.
Bellenson said that the goal of the
forum is not to provide a place for
gripes to be aired but rather a place
where problems can be discussed and
"productive solutions can be pro
posed."
Massy said that he thought a
forum's purpose is not to provide so
lutions to difficulties but to talk about

them. But if the panel at the forum
agrees on some concrete action as a
solution to the problems discussed,
"we will certainly act on them," he
said.
Bellenson said the committee
wanted administrators "capable of
giving answers" at the forum. He said
that it was sad to see controversy be
tween the University and the USW
nearly every year, and that dialogue
might be a more positive approach
toward heal the divisiveness that the
committee feels exists there.
The University is "prepared to go
in and discuss whatever it is the
people want discussed," Massy said.
In the petition sent to Kennedy last
fall, a group of students, faculty and
staff called for University administra
tors to participate in a public forum,
citing a September speech in which
the president urged incoming fresh
men to "question authority."
Kennedy wrote back to the group
saying he would participate in a
public forum. He said those who
signed the letter should form a com
mittee to help facilitate the forum and
proposed the names of several
people who might help serve on the
commmittee.

Massy did not comment on
whether the University's relation to

its workers was a serious deviation
from principles of human rights.
Bellenson said that he thought the
alleged beating by police of senior
Robby Perkins during an anti
apartheid sit-in Oct. 11 was one ex
ample of the divisiveness he thinks
the committee feels exists in the Uni
versity.
Massy did not comment on the al
leged police brutality.
Massy said that USW talks were
being held when he agreed to partici
pate in the forum and that he thought
then that the relation of the Univer
sity to its employees would be dis
cussed in the forum.
Mary Ann Tenuto, a member of
the staff council of USW, said that the
USW welcomed a chance to partici
pate in the forum. USW already
knows which of its members will be in
the forum, she said.
Bellenson said that the goal of the
forum is not to provide a place for
gripes to be aired but rather a place
where problems can be discussed and
"productive solutions can be pro
posed."
Massy said that he thought a
forum's purpose is not to provide so
lutions to difficulties but to talk about

them. But if the panel at the forum
agrees on some concrete action as a
solution to the problems discussed,
"we will certainly act on them," he
said.
Bellenson said the committee
wanted administrators "capable of
giving answers" at the forum. He said
that it was sad to see controversy be
tween the University and the USW
nearly every year, and that dialogue
might be a more positive approach
toward heal the divisiveness that the
committee feels exists there.
The University is "prepared to go
in and discuss whatever it is the
people want discussed," Massy said.
In the petition sent to Kennedy last
fall, a group of students, faculty and
staff called for University administra
tors to participate in a public forum,
citing a September speech in which
the president urged incoming fresh
men to "question authority."
Kennedy wrote back to the group
saying he would participate in a
public forum. He said those who
signed the letter should form a com
mittee to help facilitate the forum and
proposed the names of several
people who might help serve on the
commmittee.
The newly formed Committee to
Humanize Stanford, which met for
the first time Jan. 24. has announced
plans for an April "Humanizing Stan
ford" forum in which community
members will discuss the administra
tion's relationship to faculty, stafl and
student concerns.
ASSU Senator Joel Bellenson, who
helped found the committee and co
authored a petition last tall to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
calling for a University-wide forum in
which community members could air
their differences and approach solu
tions to campus issues, is hoping

Humanizing Stanford will serve to
remedy what he pereeives as a
"communication breakdown" be
tween the administration and the
community.
"We felt that the University has a
policy of respecting human rights as
stated in a number of places (in Uni
versity publications) . . . and we felt
that there were a lot of cases when
the University has violated . . . the
principal of human rights," Bellenson
said.
The forum will deal with University
employee-employer relations, includ
ing the University's relationship to
the United Stanford Workers union
(USW), the University's relation to
minorities, police harassment and

governing bodies within the Univer
sity such as the ASSU, Bellenson
said.
William Massy, vice president for
Business and Finance, is one of the
University officials expected to take
part in the forum.
"I don't think (that the University
has) . . . violated the principles of
human rights at any time, and I don't
think (University) President
(Donald) Kennedy thinks so either,"
Massy said.
Kennedy, who has also agreed to
participate in the forum, was not
available for comment yesterday.
The committee hopes to have both
Massy and Kennedy present at the
forum, as well as Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons and a member of
the Board of Trustees, Bellenson
said.
While both Kennedy and Massy in
tend to participate in the forum, the
Dean of Student Affairs' Office is
unsure whether Lyons will participate
in the forum.
Bellenson said there is a pattern to
the way in which the University acts
in relation to certain community
groups and that the administration
has not been "doing what it should"
with respect to these groups.
Massy said the administration has
in the past respected individual
groups within the University commu
nity and that he thinks the adminis
tration's policies are "enlightened."
Bellenson said that the University's
stance on the collective bargaining of
USW is one of several "serious devia
tions from principles of human
rights."
