Cracks in 747 fuselages
WASHINGTON — Warning that the problem
could lead to a crash, the government ordered an
emergency inspection of Boeing 747 jumbo jets
yesterday after severe cracks were found in the
fuselages of some planes, including one instance
in which three parts of a fuselage frame were
found to be "essentially severed."
The Federal Aviation Administration, which
issued the order, stopped short of grounding the
nation's Boeing 747 commercial airfleet. The
Boeing Co. in Seattle and three of the largest
airlines which use Boeing 747s said the inspec
tions could be completed without disrupting
domestic or foreign schedules.
Any cracked parts discovered during the in
spections must be "repaired or replaced prior to
further flight," the FAA said in its "emergency
airworthiness directive," an order which has the
force of law.
Boeing played down the seriousness of the
cracks. "We are calling this a 'non-emergency'
situation," company spokesman David Jiminez
said. Another Boeing spokesman, Jack Gamble,
called the cracks "minor little things." He said
they would have no effect on the operation of the
aircraft and would not "compromise the integrity
of the airframe."
Allocations to be shifted
WASHINGTON — Administration officials,
scrambling to soften the impact of spending cuts
under the new Gramm-Rudman balanced
budget law, are hoping to avoid rigid across-the
board reductions by shifting funds from one pro
gram to another.

But the emerging strategy, which came to light
yesterday as federal agencies gave further details
of $11.7 billion worth of pending trims, could
ignite a confrontation on Capitol Hill if it is seen
as a way of subverting the law's intent, a key
member of Congress warned.
Most defense programs are supposed to be cut
by 4.9 percent and most non-defense programs
by 4.3 percent when the first round of Gramm-
Rudman cuts, covering the last seven months of
fiscal 1986, take effect March 1.
However, budget officials at eight departments
and the Environmental Protection Agency said
they will seek to "reprogram," or shift, funds to
avoid perverse consequences or preserve certain
priorities endangered by .the equal cutting of all
programs.
Burger against elections
SAN DIEGO — U.S. Chief Justice Warren
Burger said yesterday that he categorically
opposes the use of elections as a tool for selecting
the nation's judges.
Burger, responding to a question from students
at the University of San Diego School of Law
about the retention vote on California Chief
Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, said he is not
familiar enough with the issues surrounding the
state's Nov. 4 judicial election to comment di
rectly on Bird's campaign to retain her job.
But he criticized the idea that judges should
somehow strive to be representative of society or
that they should be selected on that basis. Burger
said the only concept judges should represent is
"integrity."
"I am against the election of judges in any state

under any circumstances," Burger told about 200
students and instructors.
Reagan to cut transit
WASHINGTON — President Reagan's fiscal
1987 budget will propose a severe cutback in
federal money available for road, bridge and
transit projects, according to congressional
sources.
The budget, to be released tomorrow, will con
solidate a variety of separate federal highway and
transit aid programs into two major block grants,
both of which would be financed at levels well
below current appropriations, sources said.
It would also prohibit transit systems in large
cities from using federal transit money to under
write operating costs, a policy that the Reagan
Administration has long advocated but Congress
has consistently thwarted.
"That will be bone-crushing to our transit sys
tems," said Jayne Kirkpatrick, a spokeswoman
for the American Public Transit Association. She
noted that some large systems pay for half their
operations with federal subsidies.
Market hits new high
NEW YORK — The stock market kept sur
ging ahead yesterday, establishing new highs in
buying attributed to falling oil prices, lower inter
est rates and signs of a robust economy.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
18.81 points on Friday, climbed another 23.28 to
1,594.27. That marked the average's biggest
single-day gain since it rose 23.97 points last
Dec. 13.
