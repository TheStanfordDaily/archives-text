Manson to skip hearing
SAN OUENTIN — Mass murderer Charles
Manson, convicted 15 years ago of the brutal
massacre of pregnant actress Sharon Tate and six
other people, is expected to boycott his parole
hearing today, according to his attorney.
Manson, 51, told officials he did not want an
attorney tor the sixth parole hearing on his life
sentence, but the state Board of Prison Terms ap
pointed one for him.
"I didn't want to take any chances that a psy
chological or legal problem could arise where he
could claim that he wasn't represented by an at
torney," said Gilbert Saucedo, executive officer
of the board.
Attorney Sean Claymore, who will represent
Manson, said yesterday that he's never met his
client.
"I went to see him in December and he didn't
appear at the interview," Claymore said. "He
told his counselor that he didn't want to be part
of the process that keeps him in prison. I have not
received a response to a letter I wrote him."
Claymore said he doesn't expect Manson to
appear at the hearing, but will argue for parole
anyway.
Manson boycotted his last hearing in Decem
ber 1982 and was denied parole for three years
under a new state law allowing up to three years
between parole hearings for multiple killers. Pre

viously, Manson had mandatory hearings every
year since 1978.
Manson last appeared before the board in No
vember 1981 and said, "1 don't particularly care
to go out on parole."
Dominelli pleads guilty
SAN DIEGO — Former financier David
Dominelli admitted in court yesterday that he
was part of a plot to illegally finance Roger
Hedgecock's successful 1983 campaign for
mayor.
Dominelli. already serving a 20-year federal
prison term for detrauding investors of $80 mil
lion, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy.
Hedgecock was convicted by a jury last October
in the campaign finance case.
Hedgecock, who was tried separately, resigned
as mayor an hour before his Dec. 10 sentencing
on perjury and conspiracy charges.
Dominelli, founder of the now-bankrupt J.
David & Co. investment firm, entered the guilty
plea to the state charge as part of a plea bargain
arrangement. In return, 14 perjury counts against
Dominelli were dropped.
Presiding Municipal Court Judge Frederic
Link sentenced Dominelli to two years in state
prison. The state sentence is to run concurrently
with Doniinelli's federal term, which stemmed

from the multimillion-dollar collapse in 1984 of
Dominelli's La Jolla-based money trading opera
tion.
Hedgecock, who is free on recognizance while
appealing his conviction, denounced Dominelli's
courtroom admission.
