# Seniors invite Soviet leader
## 
### MORTY POSNER Editorial staff 
After months of private delibera
tion and public debate on campus, the
senior class presidents yesterday
mailed an invitation to Mikhail Gor
bachev expressing their "deepest
hope" that the Soviet leader "could
attend and take part in" Commence
ment but leaving open an offer "to
tour and speak at Stanford as your
plans permit."

The invitation, which was signed by
senior class presidents Leslie Darwin,
Kim Oden, Patrick Shannon and
Stephen Smith, was prefaced by a
cover letter dated Jan. 27 from Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
that does not specifically refer to
Commencement.
"The invitation carries with it the
strong desire of many of the students
here for you to visit our campus,"
Kennedy said in the letter, adding, "I
wish to also add my own hope that
you will consider this invitation
seriously, if the opportunity coincides
with your visit to the United States."
According to Kennedy's special as
sistant, Marlene Wine, the invitation
was not linked to Commencement.
"The likelihood (of a Gorbachev

visit coinciding with Commencement)
is so slim that there is no expectation
he could accept," Wine said. She said
the issue of who will be the Com
mencement speaker has not been
finalized.
The exact date of Gorbachev's trip
to this country for a follow-up
meeting to last fall's Geneva summit
remains uncertain. At a Jan. 7 news
conference, President Reagan said
this year's summit in the United
States "might be in late June, in the
summer," but added that "someone
on their side has suggested later in the
fall."
Shannon said that because the
Gorbachev visit is more likely to be in
the fall than in the summer, when the
seniors would have already
graduated, the invitation is not aimed
at landing the Soviet leader as a Com
mencement speaker.
About 500 seniors last fall signed a
petition to invite Gorbachev to speak
at Commencement. The petition was
authored by four Roble resident as
sistants.
Shannon said that the senior class
presidents did not want to develop a
faction in the senior class, preferring
to combine efforts with the authors of
the petition, who he said have "no
