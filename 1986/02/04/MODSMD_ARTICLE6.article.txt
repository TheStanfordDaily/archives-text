# Speaker addresses shuttle explosion

### LINDSAY BUTLER 
While President Reagan's Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI) is likely to
be unaffected by last week's explo
sion of the space shuttle Challenger,
other scientific projects in space may
have to be postponed indefinitely, a
UC-Berkeley history professor said
in a speech at Branner Hall last night.
Walter MacDougal said that al
though the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) may
not be immediately threatened, the
Challenger explosion may cause set
backs in many other programs, such
as the space telescope and the space
station. Because the shuttle is now
"in limbo," plans to transport a high
power telescope that would allow sci
entists to "see to the end*of the uni
verse" may have to be postponed in
definitely.
Plans for a manned space station
are also likely to be put on the back
burner, MacDougal said. l, lf
Congress is looking for a sacrificial
lamb to punish NASA for (the acci
dent), and to find an area for budget
cuts, plans for the space station will
go," he said.
But SDI research is not in jeopardy
as a result of the explosion, Mac-
Dougal said. Because research is still
basically in the preliminary stages,
only "minor" SDI experiments will
be delayed by the Challenger explo
sion. The major controversy will
come when test satellites are

developed and ready for deployment,
he said.
MacDougal said that because
Americans have come to rely on the
dependability of the U.S. space pro
gram. the Challenger explosion was a
particular ■shock.
"We identify with the space pro
gram not just because of the ad
venture, the amusement, and our
pride in it, but also because it
represents a sort of hope that we can
manage the problems of our age,"
MacDougal said. The shuttle was one
of the few government programs that
"we thought we could do right and
control, and even it blows up in our
faces," he said.
However, MacDougal added that
the accident will likely have much less
of a detrimental effect on the future
of the NASA than might be expected
due to the strong support for the
space program, especially among
American youth.
According to MacDougal, "Young
people seem to be the most excited
about the possibilities of space, from
the space shuttle to the space station,
even to 'Star Wars,' " the Reagan
Adminstration's proposed anti
ballistic missile defense system for
mally known as SDI.
In a question-and-answer session
after his talk, MacDougal centered on
SDI, saying the maturation of laser
technology has made defensive
weaponry a reachable goal.
