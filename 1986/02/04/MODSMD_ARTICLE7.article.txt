Kate Kelly, KPIX weekend anchorwoman and 1978
Stanford graduate, reads her script in silence and plays
with the collar of her peach silk blouse. She picks up

her rose-colored lip gloss and drops the case. Checking
her hair and makeup in a compact miror, she notices a
spot on her shoulder.
"I just got dirt on my blazer," she says to Doug
Murphy, co-anchorman. "I never saw it. That's okay."
15 seconds to air.
Murphy picks up the phone at his side that is usually
hidden from the cameras and calls the news desk.

"I don't understand page 10," he says."The
story makes no sense." He crosses the questionable
sentence out on his script seconds before the camera
goes on.
Sportscaster Joe Fonzi comes into the studio during
the commercial break and asks Murphy if he can have
a sip from his water cup.
"I'll break your neck." Murphy says.
"Take mine," Kelly says."I never drink it."
Fonzi asks the cameramen if they can see his shoes
right now. He has on white Nikes and worn jeans un
der a corduroy blazer and red tie.
"Next time wear some long pants," a cameraman
jokes. "It looks pretty silly in those bermuda shorts."
Kate introduces Fonzi on the air and stumbles over
the sentence, "The Rams literally ran away with the
game."
With the camera now safely on
Fonzi, Kelly shakes her head and rolls
her eyes at the one hitch in her
delivery. Earlier she had
mispronounced "Kern County." She
writes a note to Murphy as Fonzi
talks over the football highlights.
It reads, "My brain's not working
tonight."
With the broadcast over, Kelly
stretches her arms and judges herself
harshly.
"I was having a hard time with this
collar," she says. "1 haven't worn this
shirt and it didn't work and it was pis
sing me off.
"And my hair was falling down on
one side. . . . And I wasn't reading
very well. It was just one of those
nights when it wasn't really great. . ..
I'm just writing it off to not feeling
too great.
"In the end they were saying 'get
out, get out, get out.' We ran out of
time a lot faster than we should have
so I just had to edit as I was reading,
dropping a sentence."
At 28 Kelly is one of the youngest
news broadcasters in the Bay Area,
and it is her poise as much as her
smooth voice and California good
looks that accounts for her meteoric
rise in the profession.
Almost every telecast confronts the
KPIX news broadcasters with last
minute changes in the script, story or
der and stage direction. Kelly works
at an occupation in which last-minute
changes could mean embarrassment
before hundreds of thousands of
viewers. But rather than as a threat,
Kelly sees them as a challenge.
"It definitely keeps us lively, keeps
us going fast," she says. "When
there's a jolt (in the routine) it gets
the adrenaline going."
Kelly masks her success secrets in
humbleness. She attributes her rise to
the fifth-largest television market in
the country to good luck and timing,
rather than talent.
"I lucked out," she says simply.
Wendy Tokuda, weeknight anchor
woman and Kelly's mentor, has
noticed something special about
Kelly.
"She's real bright," Tokuda says.
"She has a very effective style and she
really comes across. It's a very sub
jective call. Whatever it is, Kate has
it."
"And she's very pretty," she adds.
To those who are familiar with

Kelly's captivating voice, gleaming
eyes and compelling smile, Kelly's
rise needs no explanation.
San Francisco Chronicle writer
Gerald Nachman, in a 1985
Christmas column, included Kelly as
one of his top three "inspiring spirits
who brought good cheer throughout
the year."
Nachman wished Kate Christmas
blessings "for just being there each
night when I come home."
Fortunately for Nachman, Kelly
doesn't have plans to leave the Bay
Area. "This is my home," says Kelly,
who is unmarried and heralds from
Marin County.

Kelly's poise,
smooth voice and
California good
looks account for
her meteoric rise
in the profession.

Kelly earned a bachelor's degree in
communication here at Stanford in
1978. Jules Dundes, director of the
Mass Media Institute, taught Kelly
when she was an undergraduate and
remembers her as " bright and eager."
Like many in the television busi
ness, Kelly started at the bottom. Her
first broadcast position was with a
small station in Redding, Ca., in
1978. The experience she got that
year was worth a lot more than her
$9,000 annual salary.
"I went to a small town right out of
school and a lot of people aren't will
ing to do that," Kelly says. "A lot of
students . . . want to stick near home,
near a big city where their friends are,
be around civilization, instead of
packing it up and going to some little
tiny place they've never seen before."
In Redding, Kelly learned to work
with all the equipment and began to
shoot, produce and edit her own ma
terial. There she learned to be cool
under the hot studio lights and in
front of the unblinking cameras. And
she got the mistakes out of her sys
tem. She led off her first show with
"Good morning" when it was a
nighttime broadcast.
After a year she moved to a larger
station in Austin, Texas, before com

ing "home" to San Francisco.
Kelly looks thinner, taller and even
more attractive in person than on the
television screen, and her eyes really
are a breathtaking green. Her on-the
air makeup covers numerous light
freckles. She brushes aside the impor
tance of makeup.
"You give it about 10 minutes and
that's it," she said. But she admits her
looks are a part of her success.
"Well, you're in a visual business,
so sure, that is going to be a factor,"
she said. But, "there are a lot of
beautiful people, much more beauti
ful than I am.
"When you're a blond-haired
woman, you are stereotyped right off
the bat," she added. "You have to
work very hard to be credible, for
anyone to even take you seriously.
It's the same with men. Pretty men in
this business have a hell of a time get
ting their credibility because people
will tend to stereotype you — Ken
and Barbie, you know — and not
look at the hours you work or how
serious you are at what you do."
Kelly seems more serious and less
animated on-the-air than in person.
Off-the-air she jokes frequently and
stomps her feet and pulls at her hair
to stress a point. With all her respon
sibility and glamour, she still retains a
youthful charm.
"When you're on-the-air people
will see a very limited range of you.
They're not going to see you very
happy, they're not going to see you in
tears. They're going to see you within
this range of emotion, because that's
your job.
"It takes a while on television to
get comfortable with yourself, with
just being yourself. But as the years
go on, you're more yourself, and I
think as you're more yourself and
you're more comfortable, the emo
tions with your stories are more real.
It's not consciously learned, I don't
think."
She admits she sometimes feels
constrained by her television person
ality.
"It's not like you can go dance on
table tops. There are some limita
tions. It's often very nice to go out of
town.
"On days off I sometimes wear
glasses and won't curl my hair and
won't have all this makeup on. And
people don't recognize me then."
It's not that Kelly's afraid to be
seen. "I just keep a low profile. You
know, I am that way. I just prefer to
be not in public. . . . Sure they tell

you that you are always representing
the station. But I don't think I was
going to do anything that crazy
anyway."
Kelly's life is less glamorous than
some people think, she said. The
work just takes up too much of her
time and energy. On days off, she
catches up with her dry cleaning and
bank errands. Her willingness to give
all of herself to her work has brought
her to near the top of a prestigious
profession. And the ambition still
burns. She still has a lot to learn, she
explained. Interviewing on-the-air
without a script is still a scary
proposition, she said. And writing
crisp, clear copy under deadline pres
sure can still be a struggle.
And yet with all that ambition,
Kate is acutely aware of her good
fortune. With poise and the right
looks, she may have been born to be a
rising star. But there is still vul
nerability underneath, the vul
nerability of the typical 28-year-old.
When asked about her goals, she
shook her head and said with a frantic
gesture, "This is all I can handle right
now."
