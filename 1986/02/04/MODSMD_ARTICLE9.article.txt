The following is the text of the letter sent yesterday by the senior class
presidents to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev:
Dear Mr. General Secretary,
On behalf of the Leland Stanford Junior University graduating class of
1986, we are proud and delighted to invite you to visit our campus and
address our student body. It is our deepest hope that you could attend
and take part in our June 15, 1986 Commencement ceremonies.
However, since the date of your visit to the United States remains uncer
tain, we extend to you an open invitation to tour and speak at Stanford
as your plans permit.
As a recognized leader in both education and research, our university
has retained a strict dedication to academic freedom while developing
close ties with American diplomacy and American defense. For these
reasons, we believe that our class represents many who will be influential
in the world of tomorrow. As the leader of one of the world's most pow
erful nations, you will watch our generation come of age in the political
and cultural arenas. In the years to come, we hope to demonstrate our
desire to cooperate with the Soviet people in improving the relations be
tween our two countries. A better understanding of you and your people
is an essential step toward this goal. We believe an opportunity to hear
your hopes and dreams for our future leaders can only encourage and
endorse the peaceful co-existence of the USA and USSR on all frontiers.
We wish to reaffirm our principle desire that you visit Stanford
whenever your schedule allows. We eagerly await your response.
Sincerely,
Class Presidents of 1986
Leslie Darwin
