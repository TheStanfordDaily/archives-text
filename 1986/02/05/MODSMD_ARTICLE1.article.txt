# Tenure denial sparks debate
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior start writer 
1 he Stanford History Department's decision last week
to deny tenure to Asst. Prof. Stephen Ferruolo has an
gered some students and caused faculty members to
criticize new requirements for University faculty seeking
tenure.
Despite a unanimous recommendation by a History
Department review committee to grant Ferruolo tenure, a
majority of the department faculty voted against the pro
posal, according to History Prof. Paul Seaver, a member
of the three-person committee.
Seaver said that Ferruolo's performance in the class
room is "fantastic, above question" and that he is rated
extremely highly in course evaluations.
Ferruolo's area of specialization is medieval history.
"The crucial point was in the area of scholarship,"
Seaver said, adding that he felt the quality of Ferruolo's
published material to be "very considerable."
Junior Abe Wu, a resident of Potter House where Fer
ruolo is a resident fellow, said yesterday that the History
Department's decision had shocked and angered students.
"People here think he should have gotten it," Wu said.
"It's a crock," said Potter resident Frank Knifsend. "He
was one of the best lecturers I've ever had. He gives so
much more than so many other professors I know."
History Prof. Gavin Langmuir, also a member of the
review committee, said yesterday that recent criteria for
tenure review, formulated by Dean of Humanities Norm
Wessells, possibly discriminates against scholars in certain
fields.
"It's much tougher in the area of scholarship,"
Langmuir said.
He said this was the first instance in which the History
Department had employed the new standards, which re
quire outside scholars to evaluate the tenure candidate's
work by comparing it with top scholars in the same field.
According to Langmuir, one new requirement demands
that the candidate have widened or changed his discipline
in a significant manner through superior scholarship.
"In the sciences, that can be done,"
Langmuir said. "In medieval history,
it's very hard to demonstrate that
stage. The way the letter is stated, it
makes it much harder for outside
scholars to recommend anyone for
tenure."
Langmuir said the new criteria
stems from University efforts to at
tract only world-renowned scholars
to the campus.
"We're trying to be a first-rate
University of stars, and that
sometimes leads to problems, espe

cially in certain fields," Langmuir
said.
Wessells said yesterday, however,
that the guidelines are not new.
"What we tried to do is re
articulate a whole variety of things,
(including) more precisely what we
mean by distinction in scholarship,"
Wessells said, adding that he has not
yet received information regarding
the History Department's decision.
The process of tenure in general
does not emphasize classroom perfor
mance sufficiently, Ferruolo said
Sunday, adding that he was not plan
ning to file a grievance suit.
Ferruolo was unavailable for com
ment yesterday.
