Richard LaPiere, professor
emeritus of sociology who served on
the Stanford faculty from 1929 to
1965, died of cancer at his campus
home Sunday. He was 86.
A social psychologist, LaPiere
worked on theories of collective be
havior, social change and the relation
between behavior and attitudes.
LaPiere graduated Phi Beta Kappa
in economics from Stanford in 1926,
earned a masters degree in 1927 and
doctorate in sociology in 1930. In
1927-28, he studied at the London
School of Economics and Political
Science.
LaPiere was the author of several
books, including a "Theory of Social
Control," for which he conducted a

nine-month study in Europe follow
ing World War 11. In it, he developed
an integrated theory of the nature of
social control based on findings made
during the war, including studies of
methods used by Nazis in occupied
countries. He also examined social
control in small groups in diverse set
tings, including industry.
In 1960 he received the Award of
the American Academy of Public Af
fairs for "The Freudian Ethic," pub
lished because he felt Freudianism
was replacing the American ethic of
enterprise, individual responsibility
and self-reliance.
He Co-authored "Social Psychol
ogy" with Stanford Psychology Prof.
Paul R. Farnsworth in 1936. It was
one of the most important social psy

chology tests, influencing research for
decades.
In addition to the several textbooks
and numerous articles on sociology,
LaPiere was author of two novels â€”
"When the Living Strive," about San
Francisco's Chinatown, and "Son of
Han," about China in 1937.
A popular teacher at Stanford, "he
enjoyed shocking students and
making them think," according to
Sociology Prof. Sanford Dornbusch.
When the Sociology Department ex
panded in 1959, LaPiere was "always
helpful to newcomers and pleased
with Stanford's new emphasis on
sociology," Dornbusch added.
The Sociology Department is plan
ning a memorial service.
