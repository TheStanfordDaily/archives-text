Hie Metropolitan Life Foundation has awarded $20,000 to Stanford's
owe Student Health Center for continued development of Health
et, a campus computer network that will answer students' questions
about health-related topics.
Tom Robinson, a student at the Stanford Medical School and chief
project developer, said the program is being designed to "help people
improve their own health behaviors."
The Health-Net database will operate through the LOTS computer
system and will contain information on about 75 health subjects ranging
sexually-transmitted diseases and contraceptives to eating disor-
Students will be able to type questions anonymously into the network
and have them answered within 24 hours by Cowell doctors and health
care professionals.
The advantage of this type of system is that "it's anonymous and non
threatening," Robinson said.
Robinson is currently testing Health-Net on a group of randomly
selected students. If the tests prove positive, the system will be made
available to all students on campus by the end of this academic year, ac
cording to Robinson.
It depends on how bug-free we find (the program). .. and if we find
student interest in it, said Dr. Paul Walters, director of Cowell and
principal faculty investigator of Health-Net.
Stanford was one ot six universities this year to receive Metropolitan
Life Foundation Awards in Personal Health Management. The awards
honor innovative and diverse health education programs for college stu
dents.
