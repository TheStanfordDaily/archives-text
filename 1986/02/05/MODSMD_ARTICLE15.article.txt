# West Bank discussed

### NANCY HENRY 
The Israeli public is split over the
future of the occupied West Bank, a
situation that is not likely to change in
the near future, an Israeli journalist
said here last night.
Amos Levav told a small audience
in Cardenal House that the West
Bank — Judea and Sumaria to the re
ligious factions who want to annex it
— is a volatile area that has created a
significant division of opinion among
Israelis themselves.
Levav, a correspondant for an Is
raeli evening newspaper, Ma'ariv,
spent five years covering the West
Bank. He is currently taking a three
year leave of absence to act as a
shaliach, or cultural attache,
representing Israel in an unofficial
capacity to American Jews.
In an interview before the speech,
Levav said that in his two-and-a-half
years in the Bay Area he has seen "a
huge amount of ignorance" on issues
pertaining to the Middle East. Be
cause he sees his role as one of elim
inating ignorance, Levav spent much
of his talk last night giving a brief
summary of Israeli history and recent
events in the Middle East.
"As an objective journalist, I will
give you both sides of the coin, but I
will not hide my own opinion," he
said.
Members of the Likud and other

right-wing factions believe the West
Bank must be annexed for security
reasons, while members of the Labor
Party and other left-wing groups fear
that if the West Bank becomes part
of Israel, an emerging Arab majority
will eradicate Israel's status a "Jewish
State."
The problem is further complicated
by the religious settlers who claim
that the land, which has unique his
torical and religious importance, was
given to them by God and cannot be
taken away by the state. Since 1967,
the area has been the site of tension
and violence between Arabs and
Jews.
Levav said he supported the Camp
David proposal, which called for a
five-year period of autonomy for the
area, triggering a lively discussion
with students about the West Bank,
terrorism and the Middle East in gen
eral.
This, according to Cardenal resi
dent assistant Ashleigh Head, was
precisely what this talk and others on
the Middle East scheduled for the
next few weeks are designed to do.
She said Cardenal chose the
Middle East for discussion "because
it is such a hot topic in the news,"
adding that the series, which is co
sponsored with Residential Educa
tion, aims to present issues that will
stimulate debate in student
