President Reagan is a master at painting a picture.
And, last night in his State of the Union address, he
covered the political canvas with the vision of the fam
ily picnicking beneath clear blue skies. Yet like an Im
pressionist painter, his enticing image of the family is a
blurred representation of reality.
While many have prospered under the Reagan Ad
ministration, an unacceptably large number of families
struggle on the borderline of society, fighting to
survive.
Hoping to help the poor "escape the spider web of
dependency" and gain their emancipation from
welfare, Reagan proposed in his address a study of the
welfare system. While there are certainly many causes
of destitution, one of the primary factors which keeps
many of the poor from escaping the cycle of poverty is
a lack of education for those at the lower end of the
economic spectrum. Yet, Reagan's policies have
devastated the educational opportunities for the poor.
Last night, the president, citing, among other statis
tics, the rise in SAT scores, hailed the "Renaissance"
in the educational system. The Reagan educational
policy, however, has focused more on rising standards

than on improving the quality of academics. This em
phasis on competition and achievement alone has led
to a sharp increase in the number of dropouts.
Reagan talked long on the benefits of a strong
defense, but the multimillion dollar defense buildup
has deprived other programs of much needed funds.
For example, vocational and remedial educational pro
grams which directly aid those with the most pressing
educational needs have been subject to sharp budget
cuts.
In his State of the Union address, Reagan said the
welfare system "should be judged by how many
become independent of welfare." The surest way to
eliminate the need for welfare is to ensure the poor a
quality education. Reagan's educational policies lead
to the education of the elite at the expense of those
who most need academic instruction.
Reagan's vision of the family is both idealistic and
lacking. Education is the key to enabling families to
overcome the cycle of poverty. To date, Reagan's edu
cational improvements have been superficial at best.
What is needed is action, not images, policy, not paint.
