# Non-activism needn't prod guilt
## 
### 
I always felt guilty when I walked by the mini
shantytown in White Plaza. Unlike some of my more ded
icated fellow students, I opted not to spend a night or even
an hour there to dramatize my sympathy for the plight of
black South Africans and my support for their cause. In
stead, I did as I often do when confronted with the
realities of student activism, be it a rally, a sit-in or a poli
tical organization meeting: I stood back and watched with
admiration and respect those whose commitment was
strong enough to make tangible their convictions, and
then slunk away, embarrassed, a delinquent avoiding the
attention of moral truancy officers.
It is an unsettling thing, this notion of social responsibil
ity and the moral obligations of the privileged. Every day
we are reminded of it. It is not enough, we are told by The
Daily editors, to go to Bishop Tutu's speech and give him
a standing ovation — we must commit ourselves to
change. It is not enough, we are told by nearly everyone
ever involved in public service, to recognize and deplore
injustice and inequity — we must act to eradicate them.
And who can argue? The logic is inescapable. Whether
liberal or conservative, moderate or radical, ours is useless
virtue unless we put our money and/or time where our
ideals are. Put up or shut up.
Unfortunately, a lot of people — at Stanford and else
where — do shut up, verbally and mentally. They pour
their energies into "just doing a good job" and managing
their personal lives (both admittedly difficult undertak-

ings), neatly divorcing activity from belief and responsibil
ity from conviction. Many of us do not fit into this cate
gory, however. We are liberals (or conservatives, or per
mutations thereof) of the Coffee House variety. We are
concerned, informed, sincere in our convictions, happy to
discuss our views over cappuccino, and only occasionally
seen at a rally or demonstration. We share something with
those who accept no responsibility at all: we place our
personal goals before our obligations to others. The ugly
word "hypocrite" leaps to mind. If we do not count our
selves among the active few — if those of us for divest
ment are not members of Stanford Out of South Africa
(SOSA), those of us for President Reagan not
members of the Stanford Republicans, those of us for ra
cial equality not active participants in the Black Student
Union — are not our beliefs and ideals mere pretention?
I think not. It may be self-rationalization, but I suspect
that succumbing to peer pressure to become student ac
tivists may not, in the long run, be much better than suc
cumbing to peer pressure to engage in less noble activities.
Those pressured into action sometimes gain insights they
had never before considered and become as committed as
those who (directly or indirectly) pressured them, but a
good many are less convinced of the rightness of their
cause than convinced that their social status will suffer due
to non-participation. Of course, some action is better than
no action, and one cannot deny that when numbers are
needed, it doesn't matter who's more committed, as long
as every half-convinced body is present and accounted
for. Still, the dishonesty of this jump-on-the-bandwagon
mentality can ultimately undermine activism.
Shaky motivations contribute to the trendiness of social
causes. Inevitably the glamour dulls and conviction fal
ters. People return home to pursue individual activities
lacking in ideological or moral fervor, leaving a small
number of truly motivated people to carry on alone. We
need not look too far to find examples of this
phenomenon: contrast the pro-divestment student move
ment of last spring with that same movement today.
This is not to contend that those who protested Stan
ford's South African investments in the Quad last year
were wholly insincere or that their actions are necessarily
tarnished; surely there are a number of reasons why par
ticipation has declined. Flagging enthusiasm due to ques
tionable motivation is but one of these. I mean only to
suggest that we reconsider what we mean by action and
how that concept applies to each of us. Part of the guilt
some of us may feel in the presence of activists stems from
our narrow definition of activism.
We are not all suited to passing out leaflets, organizing
sit-ins and giving speeches at rallies. We may not believe
in the efficacy of such actions. We may be personally un
comfortable with what such activities require of us. We
may have any number of reasons for lending little more
than moral support to those engaged in what is tradition
ally considered activism. Given the fact that half-hearted
commitment is unlikely to do anyone much good, I
believe these reasons are plausible and absolve us of guilt

when we refuse to spend the night in White Plaza shan
tytowns. Lest the more lazy among us sigh in relief and
close the paper, however, I hasten to add that these
reasons in no way relieve us of the obligation to act upon
our ideals.
Action can mean many different things. If, for example,
we consider racial equality to be our ideal, we are not
bound only or even primarily to traditional modes of ac
tivism. A black personnel manager who makes a special
effort to help his fellow blacks into management positions
in his firm contributes as much, in his own way, as the
NAACP official who leads marches on city hall. More
generally, the apolitical artist — actor, poet or musician —
whose work inspires, enriches and enlightens us can be
considered an activist of sorts as well. In a similar manner,
the student who dedicates most of her time and energy to
the pursuit of good grades may not appear to have a tre
mendous sense of social responsibility. But if she hopes to
use those grades to attain some position in society that will
allow her to affect or influence changes in accordance with
her ideals, is she shirking her moral obligations? Again, I
think not.
The point is that both the apolitical artist and the tradi
tional activist make a contribution; in different ways, both
efforts are indispensable. The fight for ideals and the
struggle to better the lot of humanity is carried out on
many fronts. We best serve the promotion of our prin
ciples by finding a way to do so in a way with which we are
comfortable, within the context of our personal pursuits.
Like it or not, we live in a culture which has conditioned
us to place a premium on our individual desires. Rather
than bemoaning such tendencies, we can redirect them.
We can pursue that most elusive of goals — unity in diver
sity. We can learn to walk the fine line between personal
and social responsibility.
Richard Bach capsulizes the paradox in his novel
"Illusions," when the central character (a retired messiah,
no less) says, "Anybody who's ever mattered ... anybody
who's ever given any gift into this world has been a
divinely selfish soul, living for his own best interest."
Bach's statement could be interpreted as a justification for
the abandonment of all social responsibility in favor of
selfish desires, but what he means is that you must be true
to yourself in order to be true to others. You must know
what you truly desire; you must understand where your
talents lie and how you can best make use of them for

We need not suppose that
personal goals must be for
saken in deference to moral
obligation. Social responsi
bility is personal responsibil
ity; if what you do affects
society, what you do affects
yourself.

your own self-realization if you are to give of yourself
without hidden motives and self-destructive guilt. There is
no inherent contradiction between this principle and so
cial responsibility. Even the most selfless must derive
some personal satisfaction from their sacrifice.
Those who we recognize as having done most to help
their fellow man— the Mother Theresas, the Martin Lut
her Kings and Mahatma Gandhis — have done so not be
cause of guilt or pressure, but of their own volition; surely
they gained a measure of personal growth and fulfillment
in the course of their labors.
Thus we need not suppose that personal goals must be
forsaken in deference to moral obligation. Social respon
sibility is personal responsibility; if what you do affects so
ciety, what you do affects yourself. If you examine with a
clear head and a critical eye the content and consequences
of your actions and find them to truly serve your interests
(one cannot be serving one's interests by violating one's
principles), then it is not only possible to serve others
while serving yourself, it is almost impossible not to do so.
It is easy to jump on the bandwagon and swallow whole
the latest in social cause chic, even if your heart is not in it.
It is still easier to do nothing and feel guilty about it. Nei
ther course is sufficient. You can and should put yourself
— as fully and completely as possible — into every en
deavor, lest in the end, you serve no one.

I always felt guilty when I walked by the mini
shantytown in White Plaza. Unlike some of my more ded
icated fellow students, I opted not to spend a night or even
an hour there to dramatize my sympathy for the plight of
black South Africans and my support for their cause. In
stead, I did as I often do when confronted with the
realities of student activism, be it a rally, a sit-in or a poli
tical organization meeting: I stood back and watched with
admiration and respect those whose commitment was
strong enough to make tangible their convictions, and
then slunk away, embarrassed, a delinquent avoiding the
attention of moral truancy officers.
It is an unsettling thing, this notion of social responsibil
ity and the moral obligations of the privileged. Every day
we are reminded of it. It is not enough, we are told by The
Daily editors, to go to Bishop Tutu's speech and give him
a standing ovation — we must commit ourselves to
change. It is not enough, we are told by nearly everyone
ever involved in public service, to recognize and deplore
injustice and inequity — we must act to eradicate them.
And who can argue? The logic is inescapable. Whether
liberal or conservative, moderate or radical, ours is useless
virtue unless we put our money and/or time where our
ideals are. Put up or shut up.
Unfortunately, a lot of people — at Stanford and else
where — do shut up, verbally and mentally. They pour
their energies into "just doing a good job" and managing
their personal lives (both admittedly difficult undertak-

ings), neatly divorcing activity from belief and responsibil
ity from conviction. Many of us do not fit into this cate
gory, however. We are liberals (or conservatives, or per
mutations thereof) of the Coffee House variety. We are
concerned, informed, sincere in our convictions, happy to
discuss our views over cappuccino, and only occasionally
seen at a rally or demonstration. We share something with
those who accept no responsibility at all: we place our
personal goals before our obligations to others. The ugly
word "hypocrite" leaps to mind. If we do not count our
selves among the active few — if those of us for divest
ment are not members of Stanford Out of South Africa
(SOSA), those of us for President Reagan not
members of the Stanford Republicans, those of us for ra
cial equality not active participants in the Black Student
Union — are not our beliefs and ideals mere pretention?
I think not. It may be self-rationalization, but I suspect
that succumbing to peer pressure to become student ac
tivists may not, in the long run, be much better than suc
cumbing to peer pressure to engage in less noble activities.
Those pressured into action sometimes gain insights they
had never before considered and become as committed as
those who (directly or indirectly) pressured them, but a
good many are less convinced of the rightness of their
cause than convinced that their social status will suffer due
to non-participation. Of course, some action is better than
no action, and one cannot deny that when numbers are
needed, it doesn't matter who's more committed, as long
as every half-convinced body is present and accounted
for. Still, the dishonesty of this jump-on-the-bandwagon
mentality can ultimately undermine activism.
Shaky motivations contribute to the trendiness of social
causes. Inevitably the glamour dulls and conviction fal
ters. People return home to pursue individual activities
lacking in ideological or moral fervor, leaving a small
number of truly motivated people to carry on alone. We
need not look too far to find examples of this
phenomenon: contrast the pro-divestment student move
ment of last spring with that same movement today.
This is not to contend that those who protested Stan
ford's South African investments in the Quad last year
were wholly insincere or that their actions are necessarily
tarnished; surely there are a number of reasons why par
ticipation has declined. Flagging enthusiasm due to ques
tionable motivation is but one of these. I mean only to
suggest that we reconsider what we mean by action and
how that concept applies to each of us. Part of the guilt
some of us may feel in the presence of activists stems from
our narrow definition of activism.
We are not all suited to passing out leaflets, organizing
sit-ins and giving speeches at rallies. We may not believe
in the efficacy of such actions. We may be personally un
comfortable with what such activities require of us. We
may have any number of reasons for lending little more
than moral support to those engaged in what is tradition
ally considered activism. Given the fact that half-hearted
commitment is unlikely to do anyone much good, I
believe these reasons are plausible and absolve us of guilt

when we refuse to spend the night in White Plaza shan
tytowns. Lest the more lazy among us sigh in relief and
close the paper, however, I hasten to add that these
reasons in no way relieve us of the obligation to act upon
our ideals.
Action can mean many different things. If, for example,
we consider racial equality to be our ideal, we are not
bound only or even primarily to traditional modes of ac
tivism. A black personnel manager who makes a special
effort to help his fellow blacks into management positions
in his firm contributes as much, in his own way, as the
NAACP official who leads marches on city hall. More
generally, the apolitical artist — actor, poet or musician —
whose work inspires, enriches and enlightens us can be
considered an activist of sorts as well. In a similar manner,
the student who dedicates most of her time and energy to
the pursuit of good grades may not appear to have a tre
mendous sense of social responsibility. But if she hopes to
use those grades to attain some position in society that will
allow her to affect or influence changes in accordance with
her ideals, is she shirking her moral obligations? Again, I
think not.
The point is that both the apolitical artist and the tradi
tional activist make a contribution; in different ways, both
efforts are indispensable. The fight for ideals and the
struggle to better the lot of humanity is carried out on
many fronts. We best serve the promotion of our prin
ciples by finding a way to do so in a way with which we are
comfortable, within the context of our personal pursuits.
Like it or not, we live in a culture which has conditioned
us to place a premium on our individual desires. Rather
than bemoaning such tendencies, we can redirect them.
We can pursue that most elusive of goals — unity in diver
sity. We can learn to walk the fine line between personal
and social responsibility.

comfortable with what such activities require of us. We
may have any number of reasons for lending little more
than moral support to those engaged in what is tradition
ally considered activism. Given the fact that half-hearted
commitment is unlikely to do anyone much good, I
believe these reasons are plausible and absolve us of guilt

when we refuse to spend the night in White Plaza shan
tytowns. Lest the more lazy among us sigh in relief and
close the paper, however, I hasten to add that these
reasons in no way relieve us of the obligation to act upon
our ideals.
Action can mean many different things. If, for example,
we consider racial equality to be our ideal, we are not
bound only or even primarily to traditional modes of ac
tivism. A black personnel manager who makes a special
effort to help his fellow blacks into management positions
in his firm contributes as much, in his own way, as the
NAACP official who leads marches on city hall. More
generally, the apolitical artist — actor, poet or musician —
whose work inspires, enriches and enlightens us can be
considered an activist of sorts as well. In a similar manner,
the student who dedicates most of her time and energy to
the pursuit of good grades may not appear to have a tre
mendous sense of social responsibility. But if she hopes to
use those grades to attain some position in society that will
allow her to affect or influence changes in accordance with
her ideals, is she shirking her moral obligations? Again, I
think not.
The point is that both the apolitical artist and the tradi
tional activist make a contribution; in different ways, both
efforts are indispensable. The fight for ideals and the
struggle to better the lot of humanity is carried out on
many fronts. We best serve the promotion of our prin
ciples by finding a way to do so in a way with which we are
comfortable, within the context of our personal pursuits.
Like it or not, we live in a culture which has conditioned
us to place a premium on our individual desires. Rather
than bemoaning such tendencies, we can redirect them.
We can pursue that most elusive of goals — unity in diver
sity. We can learn to walk the fine line between personal
and social responsibility.
Richard Bach capsulizes the paradox in his novel
"Illusions," when the central character (a retired messiah,
no less) says, "Anybody who's ever mattered ... anybody
who's ever given any gift into this world has been a
divinely selfish soul, living for his own best interest."
Bach's statement could be interpreted as a justification for
the abandonment of all social responsibility in favor of
selfish desires, but what he means is that you must be true
to yourself in order to be true to others. You must know
what you truly desire; you must understand where your
talents lie and how you can best make use of them for

your own self-realization if you are to give of yourself
without hidden motives and self-destructive guilt. There is
no inherent contradiction between this principle and so
cial responsibility. Even the most selfless must derive
some personal satisfaction from their sacrifice.
Those who we recognize as having done most to help
their fellow man— the Mother Theresas, the Martin Lut
her Kings and Mahatma Gandhis — have done so not be
cause of guilt or pressure, but of their own volition; surely
they gained a measure of personal growth and fulfillment
in the course of their labors.
Thus we need not suppose that personal goals must be
forsaken in deference to moral obligation. Social respon
sibility is personal responsibility; if what you do affects so
ciety, what you do affects yourself. If you examine with a
clear head and a critical eye the content and consequences
of your actions and find them to truly serve your interests
(one cannot be serving one's interests by violating one's
principles), then it is not only possible to serve others
while serving yourself, it is almost impossible not to do so.
It is easy to jump on the bandwagon and swallow whole
the latest in social cause chic, even if your heart is not in it.
It is still easier to do nothing and feel guilty about it. Nei
ther course is sufficient. You can and should put yourself
— as fully and completely as possible — into every en
deavor, lest in the end, you serve no one.
