Sanctuary effort
not just symbolic
In your Jan. 31 editorial, you
"come out" in support of the sanctu
ary movement. But you openly limit
yourselves — and Stanford's appro
priate response — to symbolic sup
port. Stanford dorms are crowded —
by your standards, anyway; the
ASSU would not likely provide
money for anything but Xeroxing an
nouncements to "discuss the issue" or
hear a sanctuary leader's speech; it is
unlikely students could be persuaded
to donate $5 to the cause — if only
for a lack of persuaders.
But come on, churches offering
sanctuary in their basements do not
offer as an excuse for nonaction that
they do not have enough beds; they
offer to satisfy the pressing needs of
food, shelter and protection from ar
rest. Stanford has more sheltered
floor space than a hundred churches,
to say nothing of its acres of possible
campsites. Further, Stanford could
contribute significant material aid to
existing sanctuary efforts. Perhaps
dorms with baking traditions could
each pledge to deliver 10 loaves a day
to a local sanctuary; perhaps students
could supervise and do the janitorial
work associated with an on-campus
shower facility; perhaps giving Sal
vadorans English lessons and such
practical advice as the whereabouts of
free legal aid for their asylum re
quests could earn an extra academic
credit in courses focusing on Latin
American politics.
Sadly, but perhaps typically for
Stanford students, you express your
solidarity only after the involvement of
so many other cities and campuses
has guaranteed that this is a safe
cause to join — even a chic one. Yes,
President Ronald Reagan plays
foreign policy politics with human
misery, but don't you play symbolic
politics with the same human misery?

Foul-ups at Flicks
have gone too far
It happened again.
I was anticipating it, too. I said to
my friends at dinner, "I hope they
screw up again at the Flicks, so I still
have reason to write that letter to The
Daily." I'd wanted for a while now to
write a scathing complaint about the
recent series of mess-ups at the Sun
day Flicks, but it took until now for

me to be angry enough to do it. Every
other time something went wrong I
would sit low in my seat and tremble
with frustration, wanting to do some
thing like throwing open the door to
the projection booth with a look of
desperation and my fists high in the
air, screaming at the top of my lungs.
I get emotional about film. I love
film; I like to lose myself in a film, so
when anything interrupts the experi
ence I get really upset. When they ap
parently lost one projector during
"Cocoon," and had to turn on the
lights five times for five minutes at a
time, so they could take off one reel
and load the next one, I grew a knot
in my stomach from frustration.
Anyway, I went to the 7 p.m.
showing of "Jagged Edge." When the
Columbia Pictures logo appeared on
the screen unframed, cut into dis
placed halves, I knew the agony was
about to begin. Approximately 20
minutes into the film the picture died
and the sound glugged to a halt. I was
used to this kind of mishap — exactly
the same thing happened repeatedly
throughout "Prizzi's Honor" the
week before — a loose wire or some
thing that they had a whole week to
fix. The picture went back on, for
about three seconds, and then it went
off and this time, stayed off. The au
dience groaned and waited. I com
mented to a friend, "I heard this
movie has lots of suspense. I realize
now that the suspense is wondering
how the projectionist will screw up,
and exactly when it will happen." A
Flicks person went on the PA after
about five minutes and explained
there were technical difficulties. The
audience was beginning to forget en
tirely what the movie was about and
instead started killing time by tossing
paper wads at each other.
Approximately 15 minutes later
the film went on and the audience re
immersed itself in it. Still the agony
was not over, as the projectionist kept
forgetting to focus the film and it took
five minutes of sporadic prodding
from the audience to get him to check
the focus each time.
I heard once that it's hard to get
into the projectionist's union.
I realize that projector mishaps are
as common and generally accepted in
the Sunday Flicks as paper planes and
yelling things out loud. I also realize
the ASSU admission price of a bit
over a dollar per show is a bargain,
and that we inevitably get what we
pay for. But whoever is responsible
for these often inexcusable mistakes
should realize there are some audi
ence members who do not wish to put
up with such consistent crap. If it
keeps going like this, every season

pass buyer could soon be justified in
asking for a full refund.
So clean up your act, guys. Fix
those projectors, even if it means
jacking up next quarter's admission
price to pay for it. Ask the projec
tionist to kindly watch the film every
now and then to make sure the image
is focused.
No, I won't be asking for my
refund, even if the Flicks would give
me one. I like the movies too much to
miss them. I am especially looking
forward to "Amadeus." But I swear,
if something big goes wrong in the
middle of that one . . . God forbid,
someone's going to get hurt.

SOS A funds story
sensationalist
The headline for the front-page ar
ticle on Jan. 30 was, "ASSU freezes
SOSA allocation for misuse of fund
ing.'' The second paragraph of the
piece began, "the board also froze the
accounts of 30 other groups .. ." The
contrast speaks for itself. Why should
this article have been given such an
accusatory headline?
The headline implied that Stanford
Out of South Africa (SOSA) had
misused funds — but the article said
that while SOSA may have spent
about $275 on items not specifically
included in its budget, its only real
crime was not to have filed its finan
cial statement on time. The headline
singled out SOSA — but the article
said that 29 other groups had exactly
the same problem. The serious ac
cusation in the headline was in no
way supported by the facts.
The freezing of ASSU accounts, as
the article suggested, is in fact a
rather routine thing. It happens to
most student groups sooner or later,
and to some groups embarrassingly
often. Typically, as in this case, it has
nothing to do with "misuse of funds."
Anyone involved with ASSU funding
knows this — but the casual reader of
The Daily's headlines may not.
The Daily is beginning a new
volume, with a new editorial staff. It
is a shame to begin with this sort of
sensationalist stuff, while more sub
stantial news goes unnoticed. Above
this article, buried in a piece titled
"Constitution turned down," was the
news that 63.1 percent of voters sup
ported the divestment referendum.
How about it, editors? Where's the
news?
