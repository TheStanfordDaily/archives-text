## Bulletin's new staff has new approach 
### LAIE CAINDEC Staff writer 
Although they do not realize it yet, they are the
first. What next year's entering freshmen will see in
their mail this summer will be the result of the first
major change in the history of the freshman bulle
tin "Approaching Stanford." Exactly how they will
take to it has yet to be seen.
What originated as a student protest movement
has undergone more changes in the past six months
than it had in the previous 10 years.
Due to a major changeover of the controlling
hand of this annual bulletin, Stanford's Class of
1990 will be "Approaching Stanford" a little dif
ferently than previous classes have.
The magazine initially was meant to provide en
tering freshmen with an unedited version of the
honest thoughts freshmen had of their first year.
The excerpts in the bulletin contained both good
and bad views of the University, and provided frosh
with a look at some of the choices other freshmen
made during their first year here.
The brochure that welcomes new freshmen to
the Farm has changed from being student-operated
to being University-operated. When the magazine
was student-operated, Undergraduate Adviser
Kathy Thoelecke supervised its operation. Now,
the managing editor of the brochure is Ellen Wood,
special assistant to the dean of Humanities.
Wood said that she feels she is responsible for
the new issue of " Approaching Stanford" and that
she feels responsible to the student community.
"My job is to ask the questions and compile all
the answers; to provide the discipline and the over
view necessary to this undertaking; to guide and
direct," she said.
But according to Rod Searcey, a Stanford
graduate who wrote for the bulletin last year,
" 'Approaching Stanford' has lost its youthful ex
uberance." He said he sees this as the main draw
back to having the freshman guide under the direc
tion of the Humanities Department.
Wood and this year's staff of five students,
however, would disagree. By putting
"Approaching Stanford" into the hands of the ad
ministration, she said, the new edition is better. It
benefits from the insight of her 10 years of teaching
undergraduates, and will also gain a measure of
consistency and diversity.
"In the past, it was too casual to the point of of
fending some people. We want to make it more
realistic," Wood said.

She said that modernizing "Approaching Stan
ford" was the key change of the new edition. Wood
said that the guide should reflect the "California at
mosphere" of Stanford. "We are guiding, keeping
in mind the interests of the group we're serving,"
she added.
Included in the changes that the new
"Approaching Stanford" faces, Wood said, is that
now students are getting paid — "that's a major
change." Benefiting from this change is a group of
five students that Wood selected largely on the
basis of their diversity.
This year's staff includes a transfer student, a stu -
dent who stopped out for a year, a varsity athlete
and a sophomore.
One of the students on the staff, Ulysses Llull, a
senior majoring in electrical engineering, voiced his
belief that the new brochure is more cohesive.
"What we tried to do was unify those voices into a
chorus of 'we,' not just a lot of separate Ts,' " he
said.
The remaining four students on the
"Approaching Stanford" staff are Squeaky Payer,
Kate Stovel, Bryan Walser and Tom Lampert.
"The diversity of this staff reflects our purpose of
reflecting the broad view of what frosh may expect
to find," Llull said. "We want to be open to new
possibilities."

The word Llull used to describe this is "friendly,
in a first-person sort of way."
"The purpose of 'Approaching Stanford' was al
ways to welcome freshmen and to express our
welcome. We can only hope that it reflects this,"
Wood added.
Wood and her staff concentrated primarily on
revising the volume of "Approaching Stanford"
which concerns the non-academic life of a fresh
man. This portion, "Approaching Stanford I," is
undergoing revisions which would "reflect current
Stanford students' faces, and interests, as well as
public service opportunities and dorm-based frosh
courses — residential aspects of education," she
said.
Although it may sound as if the new issue will
gain in unity, diversity and in more accurately
reflecting reality, there is a voice of dissent.
"It's lost a lot of its spirit," said Searcey. "When
it was done by an all-freshman staff, it was a lot
more interesting."
" 'Approaching Stanford' is supposed to stand
out — this is the students' voice. Now it's just an
other University voice," Searcey said.
The final judges of the magazine, however, will
be next year's entering frosh. And no one is saying
how they will react.
