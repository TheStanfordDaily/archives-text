# Bike-Aid '86: Stanford students pedal for progress
## 
### CHARLES SEAVEY Staff writer 
If you happened to be in the Bech
tel International Center at the end of
last August, you may have noticed
two men sitting together on a couch
thinking, and you may have won
dered what they were thinking about.
The two men were Stanford stu
dents Nazir Ahmad and Shaun Skel
ton, and the question that they were
pondering was how to get college stu
dents involved on a national level in
raising awareness of the needs of de
veloping countries.
The idea which came to them that
day was Bike-Aid, a cross-country
bicycle trip with a twist. Their
brainstorm was to have a trip that
would have not one but six routes.
Students would start in Seattle,
Portland, San Francisco, Los An
geles, Houston and Tampa and con
verge in Washington, D.C. From
Washington the groups would bike en
masse to the United Nations in New
York.
Ahmad and Skelton were hoping
that such a trip would allow students
from all over the country to come into
contact with people all over the
country; when they converged in
Washington for the trip to New York,
they would be unifying not only
themselves, but every person they

had touched along the way.
Now, six months and a lot of work
later, their dream has become reality.
Bike-Aid '86 will begin June 16 and
culminate in New York City on Aug.
11.
With five Stanford students and 20
other volunteers nationwide working
on the project full-time, Bike-Aid has
become big-time and big news.
Numerous celebrities have become
patrons of Bike-Aid, including five
time Olympic Gold Medalist Eric
Heiden and Sens. Edward Kennedy
and Bill Bradley.
The trip has been planned down to
the finest detail by its national coord
inators, Stanford students Ellen
Jones, Danyelle O'Hara, Frances
Constantino, Nazir Ahmad, Shaun
Skelton and Brian Bauer and
alumnus Joel Treisman.
Skelton, a doctoral candidate in en
gineering and public policy and foun
der of the successful Stanford Volun
teer Network, is the head coordinator
of the project. Ahmad, who has pre
viously worked with the United Na
tions University, Oxfam and the
World Bank, is the co-founder of the
Overseas Development Network
(ODN), the organization sponsoring
Bike-Aid.
Skelton emphasized that the trip
will not be overly strenuous and could
be accomplished by most anyone.

Covering a daily average of 60 miles,
the bikers will he on the road only
four or five hours a day. Injured or
fatigued bikers will be able to ride in
trucks leading and following the
groups.
The routes have been planned
down to the "shortest backstreet of
the smallest town" by bike racer
Bauer, a senior. The San Francisco
group will pass through cities such as
Denver, St. Louis and Cincinnati on
its way to Washington.
Skelton and Ahmad said that they
hoped that the trip will help combat
world poverty in two ways. First, they
said, it will raise funds; each biker will
solicit enough sponsors and
hometown support to raise between
$1,000 and $5,000. The two said that
they expect the trip as a whole to
raise at least $ 1 million.
Skelton and Ahmed also explained
that they expect the trip to raise
awareness. Through personal contact,
slide shows in each town and exten
sive media attention, the problems of
developing countries will be brought
to the attention of the American
public, they said.
Eighty percent of the money raised
by Bike-Aid will go to self-initiated
self-help projects in developing
countries. These projects are differ
ent from relief aid because they are
planned and carried out by those who

are being aided. According to Skelton
and Ahmad, such projects are, along
with simple relief, the most valid and
helpful sort of aid for developing
countries.
As Skelton said, "We don't like a
situation where an American
agriculture adviser goes into a devel
oping country and says, 'Whether you
know it or not, you need this fertilizer
and this irrigation system.' (The
people in that country) know better
than anyone else what they need, and
in fact what they think they need is
usually a lot less costly than what we
think they need."
Ahmad agreed, "There are many
paths to progress. You have to be
sensitive to cultures, to histories. You
must be sensitive to development, not
just to your own concept of develop
ment."
The remaining 20 percent of the
Bike-Aid proceeds will be split be
tween college fellowships for young
people from developing countries to
come to U.S. universities, and sup
port for development projects in im
poverished areas within the United
States.
In addition to the practical effects
of raising awareness and raising
money, the trip will also have a sym
bolic message. "The trip is symbolic
of development in general. For in de
velopment, you have to follow differ
ent paths to the same goal," Ahmad
said, "you have to work hard; and
you have to know where you are
going.
"By ending at the U.N., which is

despite its faults the only truly inter
national forum, we are affirming that
we are all coming together and that
the cause we are advocating
transcends limited perspectives," he
added.
The trip is officially sponsored by
the ODN. The ODN began two years
ago when Ahmad and his brother
Kamal decided to form a national stu
dent organization committed to con
structive approaches to ending world
poverty.
Kamal, a Harvard student, formed
an East Coast chapter called the In
ternational Development Forum at
Harvard, and Ahmad formed a chap
ter at Stanford called the Stanford In
ternational Development Organiza
tion (SI DO).
Since then, over 40 universities
across the United States have formed
ODN chapters. All of these chapters
will be involved with Bike-Aid, and it
is through the ODN that the proceeds
of the trip will be distributed to self
help projects.
The trip's coordinators noted that
it is not necessary to bike all 3,300
miles of the trip to help the cause.
One could join the group for a day or
two as it passes through his or her
home town or use the trip as an alter
nate means of returning home for the
summer. As one participant said,
"It's a lot cheaper than a plane
ticket." 1
Moreover, biking on the trip is not
the only way people can help out with
the effort, Bike-Aid organizers
stressed. Help in the planning and

preparation stages of the trip is
needed right now. Students who want
to help out should go to the Bike-Aid
office on the second floor of Owen
House and talk to Skelton.
In addition, Ahmad and Skelton
said that invaluable assistance can he
given when the bikers bike through
one's part of the country this summer.
By organizing a slide show, dinner or
a place for the bikers to sleep, one
could not only help the bikers along
their journey but also help them to
touch more people.
Those who plan to participate in
Bike-Aid claimed that rewards of the
trip will be many: an ability to effec
tively and concretely help people in
developing countries, a chance to see
one's own country by bike and a
chance to meet and interact with
hundreds of different people along
the way.
Some Bike-Aid participants said
that they had been planning to bike
across the countiy anyway. For them,
Bike-Aid is an excellent opportunity
because it will give them a purpose
for their trip, people to bike with and
an organized route with places to eat
and sleep along the way.
Individuals or groups of friends
who would like to participate in all or
part of Bike-Aid should send $5 to:
Bike-Aid '86, P.0.80x 2306, Stan
ford, Calif., 94305. The $5 goes
toward the cost of printing and send
ing out the registration materials.
Discount bicycles and return air
fares are available for those par
ticipating in the trip.

one's part of the country this summer.
By organizing a slide show, dinner or
a place for the bikers to sleep, one
could not only help the bikers along
their journey but also help them to
touch more people.
Those who plan to participate in
Bike-Aid claimed that rewards of the
trip will be many: an ability to effec
tively and concretely help people in
developing countries, a chance to see
one's own country by bike and a
chance to meet and interact with
hundreds of different people along
the way.
Some Bike-Aid participants said
that they had been planning to bike
across the countiy anyway. For them,
Bike-Aid is an excellent opportunity
because it will give them a purpose
for their trip, people to bike with and
an organized route with places to eat
and sleep along the way.
Individuals or groups of friends
who would like to participate in all or
part of Bike-Aid should send $5 to:
Bike-Aid '86, P.0.80x 2306, Stan
ford, Calif., 94305. The $5 goes
toward the cost of printing and send

Discount bicycles and return air

Bike-Aid '86 organizers, from left to right: Shaun Skelton, Joel Triesman, Brian Bauer, Danyelle O'Hara,
Nazir Ahmad and Ellen Jones. The cross-country trek will originate from seven different cities nationwide
and end at the United Nations building in New York City.

If you happened to be in the Bech
tel International Center at the end of
last August, you may have noticed
two men sitting together on a couch
thinking, and you may have won
dered what they were thinking about.
The two men were Stanford stu
dents Nazir Ahmad and Shaun Skel
ton, and the question that they were
pondering was how to get college stu
dents involved on a national level in
raising awareness of the needs of de
veloping countries.
The idea which came to them that
day was Bike-Aid, a cross-country
bicycle trip with a twist. Their
brainstorm was to have a trip that
would have not one but six routes.
Students would start in Seattle,
Portland, San Francisco, Los An
geles, Houston and Tampa and con
verge in Washington, D.C. From
Washington the groups would bike en
masse to the United Nations in New
York.
Ahmad and Skelton were hoping
that such a trip would allow students
from all over the country to come into
contact with people all over the
country; when they converged in
Washington for the trip to New York,
they would be unifying not only
themselves, but every person they

had touched along the way.
Now, six months and a lot of work
later, their dream has become reality.
Bike-Aid '86 will begin June 16 and
culminate in New York City on Aug.
11.
With five Stanford students and 20
other volunteers nationwide working
on the project full-time, Bike-Aid has
become big-time and big news.
Numerous celebrities have become
patrons of Bike-Aid, including five
time Olympic Gold Medalist Eric
Heiden and Sens. Edward Kennedy
and Bill Bradley.
The trip has been planned down to
the finest detail by its national coord
inators, Stanford students Ellen
Jones, Danyelle O'Hara, Frances
Constantino, Nazir Ahmad, Shaun
Skelton and Brian Bauer and
alumnus Joel Treisman.
Skelton, a doctoral candidate in en
gineering and public policy and foun
der of the successful Stanford Volun
teer Network, is the head coordinator
of the project. Ahmad, who has pre
viously worked with the United Na
tions University, Oxfam and the
World Bank, is the co-founder of the
Overseas Development Network
(ODN), the organization sponsoring
Bike-Aid.
Skelton emphasized that the trip
will not be overly strenuous and could
be accomplished by most anyone.

Covering a daily average of 60 miles,
the bikers will he on the road only
four or five hours a day. Injured or
fatigued bikers will be able to ride in
trucks leading and following the
groups.
The routes have been planned
down to the "shortest backstreet of
the smallest town" by bike racer
Bauer, a senior. The San Francisco
group will pass through cities such as
Denver, St. Louis and Cincinnati on
its way to Washington.
Skelton and Ahmad said that they
hoped that the trip will help combat
world poverty in two ways. First, they
said, it will raise funds; each biker will
solicit enough sponsors and
hometown support to raise between
$1,000 and $5,000. The two said that
they expect the trip as a whole to
raise at least $ 1 million.
Skelton and Ahmed also explained
that they expect the trip to raise
awareness. Through personal contact,
slide shows in each town and exten
sive media attention, the problems of
developing countries will be brought
to the attention of the American
public, they said.
Eighty percent of the money raised
by Bike-Aid will go to self-initiated
self-help projects in developing
countries. These projects are differ
ent from relief aid because they are
planned and carried out by those who

are being aided. According to Skelton
and Ahmad, such projects are, along
with simple relief, the most valid and
helpful sort of aid for developing
countries.
As Skelton said, "We don't like a
situation where an American
agriculture adviser goes into a devel
oping country and says, 'Whether you
know it or not, you need this fertilizer
and this irrigation system.' (The
people in that country) know better
than anyone else what they need, and
in fact what they think they need is
usually a lot less costly than what we
think they need."
Ahmad agreed, "There are many
paths to progress. You have to be
sensitive to cultures, to histories. You
must be sensitive to development, not
just to your own concept of develop
ment."
The remaining 20 percent of the
Bike-Aid proceeds will be split be
tween college fellowships for young
people from developing countries to
come to U.S. universities, and sup
port for development projects in im
poverished areas within the United
States.
In addition to the practical effects
of raising awareness and raising
money, the trip will also have a sym
bolic message. "The trip is symbolic
of development in general. For in de
velopment, you have to follow differ
ent paths to the same goal," Ahmad
said, "you have to work hard; and
you have to know where you are
going.
"By ending at the U.N., which is

despite its faults the only truly inter
national forum, we are affirming that
we are all coming together and that
the cause we are advocating
transcends limited perspectives," he
added.
The trip is officially sponsored by
the ODN. The ODN began two years
ago when Ahmad and his brother
Kamal decided to form a national stu
dent organization committed to con
structive approaches to ending world
poverty.
Kamal, a Harvard student, formed
an East Coast chapter called the In
ternational Development Forum at
Harvard, and Ahmad formed a chap
ter at Stanford called the Stanford In
ternational Development Organiza
tion (SI DO).
Since then, over 40 universities
across the United States have formed
ODN chapters. All of these chapters
will be involved with Bike-Aid, and it
is through the ODN that the proceeds
of the trip will be distributed to self
help projects.
The trip's coordinators noted that
it is not necessary to bike all 3,300
miles of the trip to help the cause.
One could join the group for a day or
two as it passes through his or her
home town or use the trip as an alter
nate means of returning home for the
summer. As one participant said,
"It's a lot cheaper than a plane
ticket." 1
Moreover, biking on the trip is not
the only way people can help out with
the effort, Bike-Aid organizers
stressed. Help in the planning and

preparation stages of the trip is
needed right now. Students who want
to help out should go to the Bike-Aid
office on the second floor of Owen
House and talk to Skelton.
In addition, Ahmad and Skelton
said that invaluable assistance can he
given when the bikers bike through
one's part of the country this summer.
By organizing a slide show, dinner or
a place for the bikers to sleep, one
could not only help the bikers along

the ODN. The ODN began two years
ago when Ahmad and his brother
Kamal decided to form a national stu
dent organization committed to con
structive approaches to ending world
poverty.
Kamal, a Harvard student, formed
an East Coast chapter called the In
ternational Development Forum at
Harvard, and Ahmad formed a chap
ter at Stanford called the Stanford In
ternational Development Organiza
tion (SI DO).
Since then, over 40 universities
across the United States have formed
ODN chapters. All of these chapters
will be involved with Bike-Aid, and it
is through the ODN that the proceeds
of the trip will be distributed to self
help projects.
The trip's coordinators noted that
it is not necessary to bike all 3,300
miles of the trip to help the cause.
One could join the group for a day or
two as it passes through his or her
home town or use the trip as an alter
nate means of returning home for the
summer. As one participant said,
"It's a lot cheaper than a plane
ticket." 1
Moreover, biking on the trip is not
the only way people can help out with
the effort, Bike-Aid organizers
stressed. Help in the planning and

preparation stages of the trip is
needed right now. Students who want
to help out should go to the Bike-Aid
office on the second floor of Owen
House and talk to Skelton.
In addition, Ahmad and Skelton
said that invaluable assistance can he
given when the bikers bike through
one's part of the country this summer.
By organizing a slide show, dinner or
a place for the bikers to sleep, one
could not only help the bikers along
their journey but also help them to
touch more people.
Those who plan to participate in
Bike-Aid claimed that rewards of the
trip will be many: an ability to effec
tively and concretely help people in
developing countries, a chance to see
one's own country by bike and a
chance to meet and interact with
hundreds of different people along
the way.
Some Bike-Aid participants said
that they had been planning to bike
across the countiy anyway. For them,
Bike-Aid is an excellent opportunity
because it will give them a purpose
for their trip, people to bike with and
an organized route with places to eat
and sleep along the way.
Individuals or groups of friends
who would like to participate in all or
part of Bike-Aid should send $5 to:
Bike-Aid '86, P.0.80x 2306, Stan
ford, Calif., 94305. The $5 goes
toward the cost of printing and send
ing out the registration materials.
Discount bicycles and return air
fares are available for those par
ticipating in the trip.
