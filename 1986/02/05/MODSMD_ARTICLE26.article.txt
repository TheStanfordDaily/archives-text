## Exotic expeditions offer scientific study 
### ROBIN DENNINGS 
A local program can match anyone with the expedition of his choice, and
provide the opportunity for travel to the far corners of the world in the name of
scientific research.
The University Research Expedition Program (UREP) began 10 years ago
at UC-Berkeley to finance research expeditions while giving the general public
a chance to do current research in exotic places with Berkeley scholars.
For contributions ranging from $485 to $1,675, the expeditioner can do
anything from exploring the mating behavior of Little Blue penguins in
Australia to diving off the coast of Fiji to study sponges that secrete cancer
inhibiting chemicals.
According to Rebecca Simon, information coordinator of the program,
UREP establishes a mutually beneficial relationship between the public and
UC scholars. ... Projects couldn't go into the field without the participants."
The contribution covers a share of research expenses as well as food and ac
commodations during the expedition. A limited number of scholarships
(deadline for scholarship application is March 15) ranging from 30 to 50 per
cent of the contribution cost are available to registered students at any college
or university.
"Once in the field, accommodations range anywhere from thatch huts to
hotels to tents," said Rebecca Simon. "In the summer for approximately three
weeks, six to eight amateur expeditioners can explore their choice of one of 26
different research projects spanning from archaeology to zoology. For the
most part, no special skills or talents are required aside from a healthy
curiosity."
Simon admitted that she was proud of the new Science to Service Humanity
and Research for the Environment (SHARE) project, which is under the
UREP program. "It's a new type of UREP project this year in collaboration
with scientists and governments in host countries," she said.
SHARE does research in such areas as the disappearing Tanzanian rain for
est where the local government does not have the budget to sponser the proj
ect, Simon added.
