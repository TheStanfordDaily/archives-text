# Kidney patients get more than a hot bath
## 
### JENNIFER SMITH Editorial Staff 
Stanford area urology patients are
now able to take advantage of a new,
nonsurgical technique to destroy kid
ney stones through shock wave litho
tripsy.
This procedure, which shatters
often-painful kidney stones in about
an hour, is available at the Northern
California Kidney Stone Center in
Los Gatos, established nearly a year
ago by Stanford Medical School
graduates.
In the past, the surgical procedure
to remove kidney stones has required
lengthy periods of hospitalization for
recoveiy. The enormous advantage of
the lithotripsy treatment is the quick

recovery rate. People are able to
resume normal activities in just a few
days.
Shirley Kraus of the Stanford
Medical Center said that although the

Up to 3,000 shock waves can be generated by the
treatment, and each one is like a painful slap in the back.

new procedure can cost up to $7,000,
"when one considers time lost from
work and the costs of hospitalization
[with surgical removal], the new

treatment is much more cost
effective."
With lithotripsy, patients are
placed in a warm bathtub and are put
under general anesthesia. Using X-

rays, doctors locate the kidney stones
and properly position the patient so
the kidney stones will directly receive
the force of shock waves.

These waves are created from
sparks emitted from an electrode at
the bottom of the bathtub. They pass
through the tissue to shatter the kid
ney stones.

Five hundred and fifty people
have already benefited from this new
treatment at the center, opened by
Drs. Kersten Kraft and Robert Dale

and operating under the medieal di
rection of Dr. Duncan Govan, profes
sor of urology at the Stanford Medi
cal School.
Because this is the only lithotripter
machine not in a specific hospital,
"Physicians from all over are able to
send their patients to the center,"
Kraus said.
UC-San Francisco and Los Gatos
Community Hospital have also
recently purchased lithotripter
machines, which cost nearly $2 mil
lion each.
Up to 3,000 shock waves can be
generated by the treatment, and each
wave is like a painful slap on the
back. As a result, 50 percent of the
patients experience some pain follow -

ing lithotripsy.
And 20 percent of the patients
have required brief hospital stays,
due to complications with the anes
thesia or with unusually complex
stones. In cases where the patient has
other health problems such as heart
disease, asthma or only one function
ing kidney, hospitalization may also
be necessary.
About 10 percent of the U.S. pop
ulation develops kidney stones, which
are most commonly calcium deposits.
Usually the body is able to eliminate
them with the urine. But for about 30
percent of these people, the stones
are enlarged to the point where they
are unable to pass through the
urethra and can create infections and
severe pain.
