# Stanford sanctuary sought
## 
### LAIE CAINDEC Staff writer 
A group of students has taken another
step in an effort to declare Stanford a sanc
tuary for Central American refugees by
securing a referendum in the ASSU general
elections this spring.
"We're planning a two-pronged attack,"
said freshman Max Peltz, a member of the
group. The plan consists of the ASSU refer
endum in the spring and a "special elec
tion," which group members say they plan
to petition for as soon as they agree on a
written policy.
The special election, for which the group
has yet to set a date, would be aimed at at
tracting more attention to the movement,
Peltz said.
If Stanford is declared a sanctuary,
leaders of the student group say they will
provide temporary housing for refugees and
plan for them to speak to students to in
crease public awareness of their plight in
Central America.
Nine students convened at El Centro

Chicano last week to discuss the petition and
the policy statement to accompany it at the
special election. During the meeting, group
members rephrased sentences in the policy
that they believed might imply politically
biased views.
"The sanctuary movement is seeking to
uphold the law which the United States is
breaking," said group member Lynn
Marcus, a senior. That law, the 1980
Refugee Act, says the United States will
grant political asylum to refugees facing
danger of persecution upon returning to
their home country.
Leaders of the sanctuary movement say
the United States discriminates in its appli
cation of the Refugee Act. They point out
that while 60 percent of Iranians who apply
are granted political asylum, more than 97
percent of Salvadorans seeking sanctuary
are refused. Fewer than 1 percent of
Guatemalan refugees are granted protection
for political reasons.
"By declaring Stanford a sanctuary, we
can help refugees, which will show the U.S.
that we do not support their actions," said

group member Stacey Ley ton, a sophomore.
Leyton said that although group members
are willing to accept any legal responsibility
for sheltering refugees, they intend to take a
primarily humanitarian stance without delv
ing too much into the political aspects of
their actions. The risk of legal action against
the sanctuary movement at Stanford is "not
that great," she said.
According to Stanford Police Chief Mar
vin Herrington, legal jurisdiction in sanctu
ary cases would be left to the Santa Clara
County district attorney and the Palo Alto
City Council. Since Stanford is a private en
tity, it would not have jurisdiction on a mat
ter that involved federal laws, he said.
Legal or not, group leaders say they have
laid out a five-fold plan that includes volun
tary service from students in established
community sanctuary programs, sending
money back to imprisoned refugees, acquir
ing temporary accommodations for
refugees, gathering financial aid for commu
nity programs, and conducting testimonials
so refugees can speak to Stanford students.
