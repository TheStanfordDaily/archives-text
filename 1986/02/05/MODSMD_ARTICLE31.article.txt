### 
The not-so-sea-trusty self-suckling senate harse bin
sucking tharselves agin an' bin de-bait-in tither or neigh t'
select ye senior clarse pressidentz by preferential balast, uh,
that be preferential ballots, matey. (That means ye list ye
rank choices by preference.) Thar be those what thinks this
measure could do away wif costly run-offs. Then thar be
those what thinks such ballots are too complicated for those
such as yeselves. What think ye o' dis, me main matey? Sail
ye way o'er t' ye senate an' tell 'em, but remember ye, they
don' possess but ye mentalities o' tomato-tossin'
sea-toddlers. An', arsewhile remember ye, don' fergit t'
swashbuckle ye sea-belt.
