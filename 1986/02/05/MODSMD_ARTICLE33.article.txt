Ye pirate lord Carey White notifees ye that he'll award ye
first five sea-students who contact 'im by flare or
elsesuchwise on ye phone at 326-3473 and quizziker t'
orate at the Senate's open forum. And not only is Lord
White a whily williker, but he'll also present ye wit 5 for
bishing minutes in front of ye most ornery dumbly-founded
horde of sea-senators ever t' open their mangy mud-lickin'
mouths. Yessir, sea-scum, ye can tell 'em anything ye heart
do desire: Tell 'em how bad they are, tell 'em they shoulda
met a ferocious fate a long sea-time ago. Tell 'em t' go suck
seaweed. Anything, me lads 'n lassies. Gee ahead, blast ye
trap!
