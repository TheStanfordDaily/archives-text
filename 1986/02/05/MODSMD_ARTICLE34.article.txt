# ASSURE Walks the Plank
## 
### 
Have you seen those red
buses that drive around at
night with nobody in them?
Ever wonder where they go?
Well, why don't you get on
one and find out.
Yeah, they only come every
30 minutes. Great record for
guys, not so great for buses.
But we can't afford anything
more frequent â€” unless you
want to vote it a larger fee.
Don't worry, we won't ask
you to.
ASSURE was a good idea
but not enough people use
the service to justify spending

$39,000 a year (right now,
the average cost per rider is
$ 15.00). We will be cancelling
the 6pm-12am bus service the
end of the quarter. If this pis
ses anyone off (like the 3
people who've ridden it this
year) please feel free to call up
your senators and presidents
and complain.
Oh, well. Thanks for giving
it a try. We'll start looking at
alternative methods of pro
viding night-time transporta
tion for students. If you have
any ideas, let us know. How
about a student luge service?
Or maybe an underground
railroad? Maybe a student
donkey-ride service? You tell
us.
