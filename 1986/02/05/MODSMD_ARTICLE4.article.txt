taker may soon render the pencil
and-paper, fill-in-the-oval method
of evaluating competency in math
and English obsolete at some U.S.
colleges and universities.
Following four years of joint re
search and development with the
Educational Testing Service

(ETS), the College Board in New
York City began marketing its
"Computerized Placement Tests"
early last month. The tests —
which run on International Busi
ness Machines Corp. equipment
and compatible systems — test
reading comprehension, sentence
skills, arithmetic and elementary
algebra.
It is not yet clear what effect, if
any, the new tests will have at
Stanford. Currently the University
uses only scores on the Advanced
Placement Test to place students
in and exempt them from introduc
tory aourses. The computer tests,
however, have been tried out at 17
two- and four-year colleges and uni
versities nationwide.
Roberta Kline, a senior research
assistant with ETS, said the advan
tages of the new tests are threefold:
the tests adapt to individual skill
levels; the amount of time involved in
taking and scoring tests has been cut
down; and the tests allow for greater
flexibility for test-takers and adminis
trators.
A student begins a test in each of
the four modules by answering a ran
dom question selected by the com
puter. "The first question that is dis
played to the student test-taker is
drawn at random from a pool of
middle difficulty questions," Kline
said.
Based on the response to the first
question, the computer selects an
other question of a greater or lesser
level of difficulty. If the student
responds incorrectly to the first ques
tion, the next will be from a lower
skill level; but if the student gives the
correct answer, questions get increas
ingly difficult.
"Because the system is adaptive
and it zeros in on [students'] own skill
levels, it's better able to evaluate
across the spectrum of skills.... It
presents to the student items well
suited to his or her ability level,"
Kline said.
Unlike traditional standardized
placement tests that ask students to
answer a series of questions in each
category from a range of skill levels,
the Computerized Placement Tests
ask fewer questions, geared specifi
cally to the individual student test
taker.
In addition to "providing better es
timates of [students'] skill levels,"
Kline said the adaptive nature of the
tests makes the most of the time a
student spends taking a placement
test. Students are less likely to be
bored or frustrated by questions that
are too easy or too difficult.
The goal is to streamline
placement-test taking and take away
some of the anxiety at the same time.
The Computerized Placement Tests
take about an hour and a half to com

plete (if all four sections are taken) —
approximately an hour less than it
takes to complete traditional place
ment exams.
According to Lucky Abernathy,
director of the College Board, "It
means a much more efficient use of
student time in the testing, and it
makes for much more flexible admin
istration."
Test developers see flexibility as a
distinct advantage of the new College
Board tests. Because of the in
dividualized method of testing, Kline
said it could be possible to administer
it on a walk-in basis, or to smaller
groups of students, rather than ad
ministering pencil-and-paper tests en
masse to entire classes of entering
freshmen.
In addition to the Computerized
Placement Tests, the College Board
and ETS have begun development of
a similar diagnostic test, designed to
analyze in depth a student's math and
verbal skills within the four
categories. According to Kline, re
search has been nearly completed,
and developers "are gearing up for
field testing now."
"From our placement test, you're
not going to know which question [a
student] answered right or wrong,
you're just going to end up with a
score," based on which administra
tors can assign students to appropri
ate courses, Kline said.
Abernathy said the diagnostic test
will be much more comprehensive,
and will be used primarily after en
rollment in a class to enable a profes
sor to evaluate the needs and prog
ress of individual students. The tests
will be available sometime after the
fall of 1987.
"In the diagnostic test we will have
about 40 comprehensive sub-tests
that go into detail" within the four
math and verbal areas tested in the
placement tests, Abernathy said. "It
will be a teaching tool as well as a
diagnostic tool. ... It gives not a
score, but it gives information relative
to particular skills and weaknesses
students have," he said.
For example, whereas the place
ment tests give an overall score in
each category, the diagnostic test
would show within the arithmetic cat
egory whether a particular student
had mastered fractions, decimals and
percentages adequately, or if further
work was needed in some areas.
