In our recent special elec
tion this student body had an
opportunity to make a pow
erful statement to both the
administration of this univer
sity and the government of
South Africa. A strong turn
out at the polls would have
assured the quick passage in
the senate of legislation cal
ling for the immediate di
vestment of over $ 1 million in
student funds now invested
through the university in cor
porations propping up the
South African government.
Now we will have more of a
fight on our hands.
It is not often that the

ASSU senate has an oppor
tunity to be a truly represen
tative body on any issue. The
divestment of student funds
from Stanford's investment
pool was just such a rare
issue. A million dollars is a lot
of money by anyone's stan
dards, and South Africa is an
important issue in the world
today by any definition.
When all this is taken into ac
count, I find it difficult to be
lieve that no more than 15%
of our student body has any
opinion on this question.
Over 63% of the voters fa
vored divestment of student
funds — certainly a clear
mandate — but we need your
continued input. In the com
ing weeks the senate will
hotly debate this issue and we
need to hear frpm you. Call
senators — talk to them when
you see them. Make them ac
countable to you for their
vote. Bishop Tutu praised us
for our activism and we pat
ted ourselves on the back. The
time for action is at hand
now. Show the senate you
give a damn what we do with
your money.
Senator John van Loben Sels
