## Osuna, longball lift Cardinal over USF 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
Yesterday's 12-6 Stanford win over
the University of San Francisco at
Sunken Diamond came close to
answering a few questions about the
Cardinal baseball team.
There was some doubt about the
balance of the Stanford pitching staff.
After all, the team could only boast
two left-handed pitchers, one of
whom is a freshman who has never
faced college hitters. The other, al
though he's a junior, didn't pitch on
the Farm last year.

And it's a baseball truism that an
effective pitching staff should have a
nice mix of lefties and righties.
Well, some of those doubts were
dispelled yesterday.
A 1 Osuna, one of Stanford's two
southpaws, announced loud and clear
his intention to crack the Cardinal
rotation for good.
Osuna, in his first start this year,
went six innings, surrendering three
hits and three runs to notch his
second win of year. That makes him,
along with All-America candidate
Jack McDowell, one of two Stanford
pitchers to record wins so far.

And get this, he did it without his
best "stuff."
"Today his fastball was a little up,"
catcher John Ramos said. "I think he
threw better against San Jose State a
couple of weeks ago, but at times
today his slider was unbelievable."
Against the Spartans on Jan. 25,
Osuna pitched 5 1/3 innings of
shutout relief in Stanford's 13-inning
8-6 victory.
"My slider felt pretty good, espe
cially on most of the strikeouts,"
Osuna said. "I struck out a couple of
righties with it."
Besides his sharp-breaking slider,

Osuna tossed in a few changeups to
fool the Dons' hitters. "If I can mix it
(the changeup) in, I can save my arm
and keep them off balance," Osuna
said.
Osuna cruised through the first
three innings without giving up a hit
but ran into trouble in the fourth.
With one out and runners on first and
second, USFs cleanup hitter, Chris
Gaggero, drove a 1-0 pitch over the
right-field wall for a three-run homer.
"It was a mistake on my part,"
Osuna said. "My slider was up, which
didn't help, and it didn't break, which
didn't help either."
After Gaggero's blast, Osuna
settled down to retire the last eight
men he faced before leaving after the
top of the sixth. By that time, Stan
ford's bats had answered a few ques
tions of their own, staking the Card
inal to a 8-3 lead.
Before yesterday, Stanford had
shown all the earmarks of a team that
would have to scratch and claw for
most of its runs. The Cardinal, which
last year hit .315 as a team, had hit
only .275 through three games.
What's more, in two of those three
games, Stanford's opponents had out
hit the Cardinal.
And the loss to graduation of last
year's team and league leader in
home runs, Rick Lundblade, left a 25-
home run hole in the middle of the
Stanford lineup. Stanford, a team
which last year pounded 80 dingers,
had only one before yesterday.
Well, after yesterday, all that can
be forgotten. This team does pack
some punch.
The Dons' pitching staff went a
long way toward burying any rumors
that the Stanford team is a bunch of
"Punch-and-Judy" hitters. It was
around the third inning that Stanford
fans started to forget Lundblade.
With one out and shortstop
Ken Green on second, left fielder
Walt Harris lashed a two-run homer
off USF starter and loser Duffy
Aceret, 0-1.
"It was big, fat, waist-high fastball
— a bad pitch," Harris said. "He was

behind in the count and had to come
in with the fastball."
One out later, center fielder Mark
Davis drove reliever Paul Bartke's 2-
0 pitch high against the scoreboard in
left.
The blasts staked the Cardinal to a
7-3 lead.
On the day, Stanford rapped out 12
hits, four of which were for extra
bases. Add that to 12 walks and a hit
by pitch, and you've got a potent of
fense.
Card notes
Stanford hosts San Jose State today
at Sunken Diamond in a game begin
ning at 2 p.m. The game does not ap
pear on schedules distributed before
the season. The Cardinal has already
beaten the Spartans three times this
year. Coach Mark Marquess has

named senior Kevin Kunkel as his
starting pitcher.
Neither Lee Plemel nor Steve
Chitren pitched well in relief of
Osuna yesterday. Plemel surrendered
three runs in two innings of work, and
Chitren gave up a hit and a walk in
the ninth inning.
"Plemel wasn't sharp," Marquess
said, "neither was Chitren. We'll
have to keep running guys out there
to see who can get it done."
Harris suffered a slightly sprained
ankle yesterday while sliding into
second base on a steal attempt. He
doesn't expect to miss any action.
The Cardinal plays a three-game
series this weekend against visiting
UC-Santa Barbara. The Gauchos are
listed among Baseball America's
Teams to Watch. Friday's game is
scheduled to start at 2 p.m.

Center fielder Mark Davis helped the Cardinal upend the USF Dons yesterday at Sunken Diamond. Davis
had two hits, including his first home run of the season, scored two runs, had two RBIs and stole two bases.
However, he did not keep a box score and sold no programs.

Although he made two errors in Stanford's 12-6 win over USF yester
day, David Esquer is still, along with Ken Green, a candidate for the
starting shortstop job. Esquer did help his cause with a base hit in his

Osuna tossed in a few changeups to
fool the Dons' hitters. "If I can mix it
(the changeup) in, I can save my arm
and keep them off balance," Osuna
said.
Osuna cruised through the first
three innings without giving up a hit
but ran into trouble in the fourth.
With one out and runners on first and
second, USFs cleanup hitter, Chris
Gaggero, drove a 1-0 pitch over the
right-field wall for a three-run homer.
"It was a mistake on my part,"
Osuna said. "My slider was up, which
didn't help, and it didn't break, which
didn't help either."
After Gaggero's blast, Osuna
settled down to retire the last eight
men he faced before leaving after the
top of the sixth. By that time, Stan
ford's bats had answered a few ques
tions of their own, staking the Card
inal to a 8-3 lead.
Before yesterday, Stanford had
shown all the earmarks of a team that
would have to scratch and claw for
most of its runs. The Cardinal, which
last year hit .315 as a team, had hit
only .275 through three games.
What's more, in two of those three
games, Stanford's opponents had out
hit the Cardinal.
And the loss to graduation of last
year's team and league leader in
home runs, Rick Lundblade, left a 25-
home run hole in the middle of the
Stanford lineup. Stanford, a team
which last year pounded 80 dingers,
had only one before yesterday.
Well, after yesterday, all that can
be forgotten. This team does pack
some punch.
The Dons' pitching staff went a
long way toward burying any rumors
that the Stanford team is a bunch of
"Punch-and-Judy" hitters. It was
around the third inning that Stanford
fans started to forget Lundblade.
With one out and shortstop
Ken Green on second, left fielder
Walt Harris lashed a two-run homer
off USF starter and loser Duffy
Aceret, 0-1.
"It was big, fat, waist-high fastball
— a bad pitch," Harris said. "He was

behind in the count and had to come
in with the fastball."
One out later, center fielder Mark
Davis drove reliever Paul Bartke's 2-
0 pitch high against the scoreboard in
left.
The blasts staked the Cardinal to a
7-3 lead.
On the day, Stanford rapped out 12
hits, four of which were for extra
bases. Add that to 12 walks and a hit
by pitch, and you've got a potent of
fense.
Card notes
Stanford hosts San Jose State today
at Sunken Diamond in a game begin
ning at 2 p.m. The game does not ap
pear on schedules distributed before
the season. The Cardinal has already
beaten the Spartans three times this
year. Coach Mark Marquess has

named senior Kevin Kunkel as his
starting pitcher.
Neither Lee Plemel nor Steve
Chitren pitched well in relief of
Osuna yesterday. Plemel surrendered
three runs in two innings of work, and
Chitren gave up a hit and a walk in
the ninth inning.
"Plemel wasn't sharp," Marquess
said, "neither was Chitren. We'll
have to keep running guys out there
to see who can get it done."
Harris suffered a slightly sprained
ankle yesterday while sliding into
second base on a steal attempt. He
doesn't expect to miss any action.
The Cardinal plays a three-game
series this weekend against visiting
UC-Santa Barbara. The Gauchos are
listed among Baseball America's
Teams to Watch. Friday's game is
scheduled to start at 2 p.m.

Center fielder Mark Davis helped the Cardinal upend the USF Dons yesterday at Sunken Diamond. Davis
had two hits, including his first home run of the season, scored two runs, had two RBIs and stole two bases.
However, he did not keep a box score and sold no programs.


Mike Topolovac/Daily
Although he made two errors in Stanford's 12-6 win over USF yester
day, David Esquer is still, along with Ken Green, a candidate for the
starting shortstop job. Esquer did help his cause with a base hit in his
only at bat.
Yesterday's 12-6 Stanford win over
the University of San Francisco at
Sunken Diamond came close to
answering a few questions about the
Cardinal baseball team.
There was some doubt about the
balance of the Stanford pitching staff.
After all, the team could only boast
two left-handed pitchers, one of
whom is a freshman who has never
faced college hitters. The other, al
though he's a junior, didn't pitch on
the Farm last year.

And it's a baseball truism that an
effective pitching staff should have a
nice mix of lefties and righties.
Well, some of those doubts were
dispelled yesterday.
A 1 Osuna, one of Stanford's two
southpaws, announced loud and clear
his intention to crack the Cardinal
rotation for good.
Osuna, in his first start this year,
went six innings, surrendering three
hits and three runs to notch his
second win of year. That makes him,
along with All-America candidate
Jack McDowell, one of two Stanford
pitchers to record wins so far.

And get this, he did it without his
best "stuff."
"Today his fastball was a little up,"
catcher John Ramos said. "I think he
threw better against San Jose State a
couple of weeks ago, but at times
today his slider was unbelievable."
Against the Spartans on Jan. 25,
Osuna pitched 5 1/3 innings of
shutout relief in Stanford's 13-inning
8-6 victory.
"My slider felt pretty good, espe
cially on most of the strikeouts,"
Osuna said. "I struck out a couple of
righties with it."
Besides his sharp-breaking slider,

Osuna tossed in a few changeups to
fool the Dons' hitters. "If I can mix it
(the changeup) in, I can save my arm
and keep them off balance," Osuna
said.
Osuna cruised through the first
three innings without giving up a hit
but ran into trouble in the fourth.
With one out and runners on first and

Gaggero, drove a 1-0 pitch over the
right-field wall for a three-run homer.
