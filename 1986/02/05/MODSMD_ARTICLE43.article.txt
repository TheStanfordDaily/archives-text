### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Stanford center Howard Wright
was named the Pacific 10 Conference
Player of the Week for his efforts in
the Cardinal's victories last weekend
at Oregon and Oregon State.

In those two games the freshman
from San Diego averaged 14.5 points
and 7.5 rebounds and shot 63 percent
from the floor as Stanford swept both
games in the state of Oregon for the
first time in 21 years.
Wright scored a game-high 18

points and pulled down six rebounds
as Stanford opened the trip with a 73-
69 victory in overtime over Oregon.
In that game, he had a key steal
with just over a minute left in regula
tion and the game tied, then iced the
victory with nine seconds left in
overtime when he hit a turnaround
five-footer as the shot clock was ex
piring.
Against Oregon State, Wright
scored 11 points and snagged nine
rebounds in the 56-52 victory, Stan
ford's first in Corvallis since 1975.
He also bore most of the responsi
bility for defending against Beaver
center Jose Ortiz, holding Ortiz to
only two points in the first half as the
Cardinal opened a 10-point halftime
lead.
Wright is the first Stanford player
to be named conference Player of the
Week since Keith Jones was so
honored on Feb. 20, 1984. John
Revelli was also named that season.
Wright has started 19 of the Card
inal's 21 games so far this season,
averaging 9.3 points and 6.3
rebounds. He is Stanford's leading
rebounder.
The 18 points at Oregon tied his
career high, set earlier this season
against Yale.
He is second only to Todd Lichti in
minutes played, averaging 28 per
game, and the team leader in blocked
shots with 27.
