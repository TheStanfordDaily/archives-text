# Tennis begins with win over Spartans
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Although there weren't any delays,
the Stanford men's tennis team was
still a bit edgy to get the 1986 season
underway.
The No. 1-ranked Cardinal squad
did just that yesterday afternoon with
a 7-2 victory over the host San Jose
State Spartans.
"We really needed a match to get
us going." Coach Dick Gould said.
"And luckily we came out of it basi
cally unscathed."
The Cardinal sailed through its first
five singles matches without losing a
set. Stanford senior Dan Goldie, the
second-ranked player in the nation,
defeated Malcolm Allen 6-3, 6-4 in
the First singles match.
"It's good to start off on the right
foot — winning in straight sets,"
Goldie said. "I didn't want to go for
too much in the first match of the
season. I just wanted to play consis
tently."

Allen turned in a fine performance,
too.
"1 thought he played well for a
freshman, especially since it was only
his second collegiate match," Goldie
said.
Allen's efforts seem even more im
pressive when you consider he was
playing one of the top college seniors
in the country.
"San Jose is much stronger than
they have been in the past," Gould
said. "Still, they're a young team, and
they're rather new to major college
tennis matches."
With Stanford's Jim Grabb sitting
out the contest with a groin injury,
senior Eric Rosenfeld played in the
second spot for the Cardinal and
defeated Nelson Banes 6-3. 7-6.
Fellow senior John Letts defeated
Mark Murphy, the Pacific Coast Ath
letic Association's defending singles
and doubles champion, by a score of
6-2, 6-3.
The most lopsided victory of the
day occurred in the fourth singles
slot. Cardinal Patrick McEnroe beat
Marcello Telia in straight sets, 6-1, 6-
2. Dating back to last season, the
Stanford sophomore has now won 19
out of his last 20 college matches.
Stanford junior Scott Moody
clinched the victory for Coach Gould's
squad with a 6-4, 6-3 win over Spar
tan Bob Hepner.
San Jose's first win of the match
came in number six singles, as Spar
tan Tom Sheehan came from behind
to knock off Cardinal junior Mark
Jacobson, 1-6, 6-2, 6-3.
"That surprised me," Gould said.
"He (Jacobson) won the first set so
easily, and the next time 1 turned
around he had lost the second set. He
said he had some bad service games
in that set, but he almost came back
to win it."
The Cardinal did not breeze
through the doubles matches in the

same manner that it took the singles.
Because Stanford's seventh-ranked
doubles team of Goldie and Grabb
did not play, the I3th-ranked team of
Letts and McEnroe played first
doubles and defeated Murphy and
Paul Carbone 6-4, 7-6.
Next the Cardinal team of Rosen
feld and Moody lost a set but still
pulled out the victory over Telia and
Layne Lyssy by a tally of 6-2, 4-6, 6-
4.
In No. 3 doubles, San Jose's Allen
and Hepner defeated Cardinal
players Jacobson and junior Georgie
McKee, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.
"We were a little rusty on
doubles," Gould said last night.
"Between the rains we've been
playing mostly singles ladder matches
in practice, but tomorrow we'll be
practicing doubles."
Dan Goldie will miss practice this
week because he will be playing in the
Ail-American Indoor Championships
in Houston beginning Thursday.
Goldie won that tournament last year
by defeating Georgia's Michael
Pernfors 6-3, 6-2.

day occurred in the fourth singles
slot. Cardinal Patrick McEnroe beat
Marcello Telia in straight sets, 6-1, 6-
2. Dating back to last season, the
Stanford sophomore has now won 19
out of his last 20 college matches.
Stanford junior Scott Moody
clinched the victory for Coach Gould's
squad with a 6-4, 6-3 win over Spar
tan Bob Hepner.
San Jose's first win of the match
came in number six singles, as Spar
tan Tom Sheehan came from behind
to knock off Cardinal junior Mark
Jacobson, 1-6, 6-2, 6-3.
"That surprised me," Gould said.
"He (Jacobson) won the first set so
easily, and the next time 1 turned
around he had lost the second set. He
said he had some bad service games
in that set, but he almost came back
to win it."
The Cardinal did not breeze
through the doubles matches in the

same manner that it took the singles.
Because Stanford's seventh-ranked
doubles team of Goldie and Grabb
did not play, the I3th-ranked team of
Letts and McEnroe played first
doubles and defeated Murphy and
Paul Carbone 6-4, 7-6.
Next the Cardinal team of Rosen
feld and Moody lost a set but still
pulled out the victory over Telia and
Layne Lyssy by a tally of 6-2, 4-6, 6-
4.
In No. 3 doubles, San Jose's Allen
and Hepner defeated Cardinal
players Jacobson and junior Georgie
McKee, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.
"We were a little rusty on
doubles," Gould said last night.
"Between the rains we've been
playing mostly singles ladder matches
in practice, but tomorrow we'll be
practicing doubles."
Dan Goldie will miss practice this
week because he will be playing in the
Ail-American Indoor Championships
in Houston beginning Thursday.
Goldie won that tournament last year
by defeating Georgia's Michael
Pernfors 6-3, 6-2.
