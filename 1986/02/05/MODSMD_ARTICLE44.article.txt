# Tennis begins with win over Spartans

### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Although there weren't any delays,
the Stanford men's tennis team was
still a bit edgy to get the 1986 season
underway.
The No. 1-ranked Cardinal squad
did just that yesterday afternoon with
a 7-2 victory over the host San Jose
State Spartans.
"We really needed a match to get
us going." Coach Dick Gould said.
"And luckily we came out of it basi
cally unscathed."
The Cardinal sailed through its first
five singles matches without losing a
set. Stanford senior Dan Goldie, the
second-ranked player in the nation,
defeated Malcolm Allen 6-3, 6-4 in
the First singles match.
"It's good to start off on the right
foot â€” winning in straight sets,"
Goldie said. "I didn't want to go for
too much in the first match of the
season. I just wanted to play consis
tently."

Allen turned in a fine performance,
too.
"1 thought he played well for a
freshman, especially since it was only
his second collegiate match," Goldie
said.
Allen's efforts seem even more im
pressive when you consider he was
playing one of the top college seniors
in the country.
"San Jose is much stronger than
they have been in the past," Gould
said. "Still, they're a young team, and
they're rather new to major college
tennis matches."
With Stanford's Jim Grabb sitting
out the contest with a groin injury,
senior Eric Rosenfeld played in the
second spot for the Cardinal and
defeated Nelson Banes 6-3. 7-6.
Fellow senior John Letts defeated
Mark Murphy, the Pacific Coast Ath
letic Association's defending singles
and doubles champion, by a score of
6-2, 6-3.
