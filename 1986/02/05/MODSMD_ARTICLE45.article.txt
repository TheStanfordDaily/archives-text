# Jordan moves to another court
## 
### SCOTT ROTH Staff Writer 
Ex-Stanford tennis star Barbara Jordan has
spent most of her life on the court. But that's
going tochange a little in the future. Now she will
spend more time in court than on it.
Jordan, you see, has put the big-money, high
pressure world of professional tennis on hold in
order to pursue a law degree at UCLA.
After coming to the Farm in 1975 from King of
Prussia, Pa. as one of the first women ever to be
granted a tennis scholarship, she went on to win
one NCAA championship and finish second
twice. She also garnered All-America honors
three years running. Her NCAA title, oddly
enough, came in doubles with her sister Kathy
rounding out the duo.
After graduating early in 1979, Jordan made
the jump to the pro ranks to seek fame and
fortune. Like many other top college players, the
move was not only expected, it was natural.

"I turned pro mainly because I wanted to,"
Jordan explained. " I had played in a lot of tour
naments during summer break. I was well
attuned to life on the circuit. I also wanted to
travel."
Soon after her debut, Jordan rose about as
high as one can by defeating Hana Manlikova
and Sharon Walsh to win the Australian Open, a
Grand Slam tournament, in 1980. Yet Jordan
soon became disillusioned with the pros.
"My first match was in Oakland against Chris
Evert," Jordan said. "I was excited and thought a
bunch of people from Stanford would come up,
but that didn't happen. I was surprised that there
was so little camaraderie. No one talked. It was
strange.
"Living out of a suitcase can get to you. By the
time you get home and have your film developed,
it's time to leave again."
With tennis becoming less fun, Jordan decided
to cut down on her pro career. She chose to put
her economics degree to work and go to law

school. She is now in her second year.
"Right now I'm working as an extern in the
San Francisco District Attorney's office. I'm
working in the Consumer Fraud department,"
Jordan said. "In the future I think I'd probably
like to go into private practice. I don't think I'd
ever go into corporate law."
After attending Stanford as a student-athlete
and competing against the likes of Martina Nav
ratilova and Evert-Lloyd, attending law school
would be a breeze, right? Wrong.
"Law school is both fun and difficult," Jordan
explained. "In college, there are a lot more mid
terms and papers. Here (at UCLA) a class might
only have one paper due at the end of the term.
It's hard to get any feedback on how you are
doing."
Her success in the classroom and on the court
comes as no surprise to Anne Gould, former
women's tennis coach. Jordan was an example to

to win the national doubles crown. "Barb was a tremendous compet

others around her.
"Barb was a tremendous competi
tor. She would never give up," Gould
said. "I can remember many matches
when she'd be way down, but she'd
scratch and claw her way back in. She
worked hard and led the others by ex
ample. Barb was definitely an integral
part of the team."
With law taking up most of her
time, Jordan still has not ruled out
more pro tennis.
"I never really quit," Jordan said.
"I just slowed down a bit. Last sum

mer 1 played in the team tennis
league. I'd like to do that again.
"I'd also, if I had more time, like to
get into the tour again, but that re
quires more time. You have to
practice a lot more."
After being away from Stanford,
Jordan had some advice for those still
here.
"While I was here, I was in a rut,
kind of. I'd go to class, go to practice
and home to study," she said. "I
didn't get a chance to enjoy the place.
I hope that those who are here really
get a chance to take advantage of the
surroundings."
