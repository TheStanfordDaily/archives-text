# Volleyball trip opens tonight
## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball team meets its toughest competition of
the year as it travels south this week on a six-day, four-match road trip.
The fifth-ranked Cardinal puts a 3-0 overall record on the line, includ
ing a 2-0 mark in California Intercollegiate Volleyball Association
(CIVA) play.
Those two conference victories came against two of the weakest
squads in the CIV A, however. Cal-State Northridge, though No. 13 in
the nation, is ninth in the 11-team league, and new member St. Mary's is
in last place, despite holding the 20th spot in the country.
Stanford certainly looked impressive in those first two conference out
ings, coming back from a 6-0 deficit in the second game against
Northridge to earn a 15-7, 16-14, 15-2 triumph. The win over the Gaels
was even more decisive, as the Cardinal took less than 45 minutes to
finish the match and surrendered only 10 points in the process.
In fact, Stanford has outscored its opponents 15.1 to 5.5 in games this
season. But the team will be hard-pressed to maintain that kind of
scoring ratio this coming week.
Tonight the Cardinal faces UC-Santa Barbara, currently ranked No. 4
in the Tachikara-Coaches Top 20 Poll, one spot above Stanford. On
Friday the squad goes against No. 9 Long Beach State, then faces No. 11
San Diego State on Saturday.
Stanford wraps up the long trip with a visit to Pepperdine, the top
team in the country and the defending national champion.
The team makes two four-match journeys south every year, both for
academic and financial reasons. These extended road trips put the team
at a slight disadvantage with regard to the rest to the league.
"If we can split our eight matches in Southern California," Co-coach
Don Shaw said, "we have a good chance of making the playoffs. This is
definitely a critical road trip."
UC-Santa Barbara will be led by two-time All-American Jared Hof
fman, from Independence, Mo., who led the team in kills last year. "He
is very stable," Gaucho Coach Ken Preston said. "We expect him to give
us another good year."
"UCSB is always extremely well-coached," Shaw said, "but it's hard
to say. A couple of their starters have been out. They have a lot of depth,
but they lost three starters from last year, so there is also a lot of inex
perience.
"This Stanford group has been together for awhile, and will have more
experience on the floor. We have to hope that UCSB will make more
mistakes."
All-America candidates Chris Braun, Jon Root and Scott Fortune
continue to lead the Cardinal attack. Senior outside hitter Braun has 25
kills in conference action, followed by Root with 23 and Fortune with
21. Braun also tops the squad with a .431 hitting percentage, while Root
has a .419 percentage and Fortune is at .313, Stanford's team percentage
is .320.
