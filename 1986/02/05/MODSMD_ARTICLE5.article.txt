# Future of Theta Delts threatened by Res Ed
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
The future of Theta Delta Chi "as a
recognized, housed fraternity must be ques
tioned" in light of "behavioral and other kinds
of problems" shown by the fraternity's mem
bers, according to Diana Conklin, assistant dean
of Student Affairs and director of the Row.
"It appears that Theta Delts feel they can do
or say anything, with impunity. That attitude,
left unchanged, will spell the death of your fra
ternity on this campus," Conklin stated in a let
ter sent Jan. 29 to Theta Delt President Jim
Flanigon.
Conklin said in the letter that she intends to
meet with Flanigon "soon" to discuss what she
called "very serious concerns about the present
and future of your fraternity."
Flanigon said yesterday he would not com
ment on the letter until he meets with Conklin.
The letter cites nine specific problems involv
ing the fraternity, including "extraordinary
destructiveness" to the house, a $29,113 debt as
of Jan. 6, and a Jan. 24 incident at Branner Hall
involving pledges that was "too repulsive to ap
pear in this letter."
Conklin did not specify any action that the
University would take against the fraternity.

Gary Shumway, the Theta Delt resident assis
tant, said he was "surprised to get the letter,"
but added that the fraternity will "make any
changes so we can satisfy the University."
Theta Delt House Manager Greg Baty said
that rather than dropping all the charges on the
fraternity in one letter, Conklin should have in
formed the fraternity as the problems arose.
"We need to know that it's a problem before
we can stop it," Baty said, adding that problems
involving the fraternity are "usually individual
acts" that can be dealt with more easily on an
individual basis.
Baty said that fraternities are dealt with more
severely for making noise during various activi
ties than are other students and student organi
zations, noting that the Band can greatly disturb
residences during the week prior to Big Game
or during rallies across campus without punish
ment.
"They look at us as these big, ugly guys,"
Baty said, referring to the University's attitude
toward fraternity members.
Baty called the fraternity's debt "a problem
that is being taken care of," noting that the red
ink accrued over the past three or four years as
some members of the fraternity left
the house or graduated without
paying bills.
Baty noted that it is hard to tell a
fellow fraternity member that he
can't graduate because he has not
paid house fees or other fraternity
related bills.
"It's hard to come down on them,"
he said.
In addition to the fraternity's debt,
Conklin said that "no other group on
campus comes close to the
destructiveness and ill-treatment of
the house as evidenced in Theta
Delts' behavior." She added that
"residents have caused serious fire
and safety hazards in the house."
Norm Robinson, associate dean of
Student Affairs, concurred with Con
klin, saying that the fraternity's mem
bers "just don't take care of (the
house)."
Conklin said yesterday that she
"really didn't want to describe in
great detail" the incident at Branner
Hall that apparently involved one of
the dorm's female residents and a

group of Theta Delt pledges.
Brook Binley, the Branner resident
identified by Conklin as involved in
the incident, said the pledges "were
just stopping by. It was totally harm
less."
Binley, who received a copy of the
letter, declined further comment until
she meets with Conklin.
In another charge against the fra
ternity. Conklin said the Theta Delts
"routinely harass residents of Kappa
Sigma and cause damage to their
house and to members' personal
property. One example of many is the
Theta Delt tradition of filling a
garbage can with the vomit of Theta
Delts, then emptying the can on the
front door step and surrounding en
virons of the Kappa Sig house."
Conklin also said in the letter that
"despite at least two requests from the
fraternal affairs adviser, the president
of Theta Delt has declined to meet
with Joe Pisano."
Pisano said yesterday that he has
scheduled a meeting with Flanigon
today to discuss Conklin's letter and
talk "about the status of Theta Delts
in general."
There is "some real serious need
for us to work together," Pisano
added.
