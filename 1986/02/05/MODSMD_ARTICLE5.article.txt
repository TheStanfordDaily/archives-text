# Future of Theta Delts threatened by Res Ed

### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
The future of Theta Delta Chi "as a
recognized, housed fraternity must be ques
tioned" in light of "behavioral and other kinds
of problems" shown by the fraternity's mem
bers, according to Diana Conklin, assistant dean
of Student Affairs and director of the Row.
"It appears that Theta Delts feel they can do
or say anything, with impunity. That attitude,
left unchanged, will spell the death of your fra
ternity on this campus," Conklin stated in a let
ter sent Jan. 29 to Theta Delt President Jim
Flanigon.
Conklin said in the letter that she intends to
meet with Flanigon "soon" to discuss what she
called "very serious concerns about the present
and future of your fraternity."
Flanigon said yesterday he would not com
ment on the letter until he meets with Conklin.
The letter cites nine specific problems involv
ing the fraternity, including "extraordinary
destructiveness" to the house, a $29,113 debt as
of Jan. 6, and a Jan. 24 incident at Branner Hall
involving pledges that was "too repulsive to ap

Conklin did not specify any action that the
University would take against the fraternity.

Gary Shumway, the Theta Delt resident assis

but added that the fraternity will "make any
changes so we can satisfy the University."
Theta Delt House Manager Greg Baty said
that rather than dropping all the charges on the
fraternity in one letter, Conklin should have in
formed the fraternity as the problems arose.
"We need to know that it's a problem before
we can stop it," Baty said, adding that problems
involving the fraternity are "usually individual
acts" that can be dealt with more easily on an
individual basis.
Baty said that fraternities are dealt with more
severely for making noise during various activi
ties than are other students and student organi
zations, noting that the Band can greatly disturb
residences during the week prior to Big Game
or during rallies across campus without punish
ment.
"They look at us as these big, ugly guys,"
Baty said, referring to the University's attitude
toward fraternity members.
Baty called the fraternity's debt "a problem
that is being taken care of," noting that the red
ink accrued over the past three or four years as
