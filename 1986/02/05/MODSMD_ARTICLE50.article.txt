In the race for the Peninsula's
top three high school football
prospects, Stanford has made a
clean sweep.
Mark Hanson, a 6-foot-4 defen
sive lineman from St. Francis High
School, committed verbally on
Monday to enroll at Stanford. Last
week both Jono Tunney and
Chuck Gillingham of Bellarmine
Prep decided to play for the Card
inal.
Hanson, who is expected to play
linebacker for Stanford Coach
Jack Elway, is an extremely ver
satile athlete. In addition to being
the Peninsula's Defensive Player
of the the Year, he also played
tight end for the Lancers.
He is currently playing basket
ball and will compete in track in
the spring â€” as a 235-pound
sprinter.

For Hanson, the grandson of
former Stanford Baseball Coach
Dutch Fehring, the decision to at
tend Stanford was an easy one. He
lives just three miles from Stan
ford Stadium.
"I've been a Stanford fan since I
was born," Hanson said. "I guess
you could say Stanford is in my
blood. 1 told the recruiters that if I
was accepted academically and of
fered a scholarship, 1 would most
likely accept."
When informed Friday night
that he had been accepted, Han
son said yes.
Though close to 40 schools
made inquiries about him, Hanson
limited his recruiting trips to Stan
ford, California and an unofficial
visit to Santa Clara. He cancelled
trips to Arizona, Arizona State
and San Diego State.
