Israel intercepts Libyan plane
JERUSALEM — Israeli air force planes, hoping to capture Palestin
ian terrorist leaders, intercepted a Libyan executive jet in international
air space near Cyprus yesterday and forced it to land at a military air
base here, but did not find the wanted men on board.
The Israeli military command said that it had acted because the
Libyan jet "was suspected to be cariying persons who were involved in
planning attacks against Israel." It did not identify those actually on
board, but said all had been freed.
State-run Tripoli radio said that Abdullah al-Ahmar, assistant secre
tary general of Syria's ruling socialist Baath party was among the pas
sengers, but it did not identify the others.
Syria condemned the interception as "air piracy" and a threat to civil
aviation, and it called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security
Council to condemn Israel.
In Washington, U.S. officials denied that the United States played a
role in the interception.
Pentagon spokesman Robert Sims said, "There was no U.S. military
involvement at all." A State Department official added that Libyan
charges of U.S. assistance to the Israelis are "a crock." He added, "We
had no foreknowledge or involvement in any shape or form."
As for the incident itself, the official said, "We don't have enough in
formation to react at this time."
Officials here refused to say specifically who they believed to be on
board the Libyan jet, but the target was rumored to be Abu Nidal, head
of a group said to be responsible for the Dec. 27 terrorist attacks at the
Rome and Vienna airports. Twenty persons died in those rifle and hand
grenade assaults, including five Americans and four terrorists.
Both the United States and Israel have charged that Libyan leader,
Col. Moammar Khadafy was implicated in the airport attacks.
Aquino rally attracts huge crowd
MANILA, Philippines — Supporters of opposition presidential candi
date Corazon Aquino paralyzed central Manila yesterday afternoon and
evening with the largest rally of her campaign as the country prepared
for voting on Friday.
Crowd estimates ranged from hundreds of thousands to 1.5 million in
the downtown Luneta Park. Many observers agreed that it was the larg
est concentration since Pope John Paul ll's visit to the same park in
1981, when perhaps 2 million gathered. The turnout for the 1983 fu
neral of Aquino's slain husband, Benigno, held elsewhere, drew the
most recent comparable crowd.
President Ferdinand Marcos, campaigning for re-election, is to hold
his final rally tonight, also in Luneta Park. Election law specifies that
campaigning must halt one full day before the election.
Marcos generally has drawn smaller and less enthusiastic crowds than
Aquino — or than he did in past campaigns of his 20 years in the
presidency. Nevertheless, his party organization is considered con
siderably stronger.
Tension rises in Haiti's capital
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Shops and businesses closed early yes
terday afternoon, again raising the level of tension in the capital on this
fifth day of Haiti's state of siege. Some opposition leaders suggested the
closings were part of an organized protest that could escalate, while
others said shop owners were afraid of another outburst of violence.
Most attention yesterday, however, continued to center on conflicting
reports on the number of casualties from the recent outburst of domestic
violence.
There were also reports — unable to be independently confirmed —
that roaming squads of security forces have been combing slum areas of
the capital at night, forcibly removing people from their homes.
The number of casualties from the disturbances that began 10 days
ago has been a source of continuing confusion, with opponents of
President-for-life Jean-Claude Duvalier suggesting that his regime has
resorted to widespread repression in stopping the violence and maintain
ing his grip on power.
This recent round of protests, which first erupted in Cap-Haiten and
Gonaive, have been the most serious and widespread in the two genera
tions of Duvalier dictatorships.
Nissan to aid Korean company
TOKYO — Nissan Motor Co. announced yesterday that, beginning
next year, it will supply Daewoo Motor Co. of South Korea, a joint
venture company in which General Motors owns a 50 percent equity
share, with the technology to manufacture vans and advice on the pro
duction of 1-ton trucks.
Engines made by Isuzu of Japan, in which GM owns a 34.2 percent
share, will be used in the new van. It will be modeled after Nissan's
Vanette, which can carry up to nine passengers, the company said.
Future exports of the van and the truck, which Daewoo will develop
independently with advice from Nissan, were not ruled out. Daewoo,
however, will be obliged to consult with Nissan before undertaking any
exports, a Nissan spokesman said.
Through its involvement with Daewoo. Nissan will obtain what it
called "a window on developments in the fast-growing South Korean
automotive industry." Daewoo, the only South Korean automotive com
pany that has had no ties to a Japanese car maker, will gain access to
Japanese manufacturing technology.
OPEC meeting ends inconclusively
VIENNA, Austria — As oil prices dropped below $15 a barrel in
major markets yesterday, a special committee meeting of the Organiza
tion of Petroleum Exporting Countries ended inconclusively, with oil
ministers deciding that OPEC must increase its production ceiling but
not saying what the new ceiling should be.
No great price drop is expected for consumers, analysts cautioned.
Gasoline and heating-fuel prices to consumers are based largely on long
term contracts for oil purchases, which still reflect last fall's prices. While
the drop in futures prices suggests an eventual lowered cost to consu
mers. oil company pricing policies could prevent that.
The question of where to set the new OPEC ceiling — and the disa
greement it has provoked within the organization — appeared increas
ingly moot as leading OPEC producer Saudi Arabia already has more
than doubled its output over the last several months.
While the 1981 self-imposed ceiling of 16 million barrels of day is still
official OPEC policy, current daily production is estimated at about 18.4
million barrels, with at least 5 million coming from the Saudis.
Nations disagree on S. Africa
LUSAKA, Zambia — The joint meeting of frontline and Common
Market foreign ministers ended here yesterday with the parties ap
parently failing to agree on positive steps to deal with the apartheid
regime in South Africa.
The 18 delegations agreed on the need to take positive measures to
force South Africa to dismantle apartheid and introduce a dialogue be
tween government leaders and leaders of the majority blacks with a view
to establishing a democratic government. But they differed on the issue
of economk: sanctions and support for rebel movements.
While the frontline states, the black-ruled nations bordering South
Africa, advocated punitive economic sanctions against their white-rule
neighbor, most of the Common Market ministers, particularly British
Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, were reported to have insisted on
waiting for the findings of a special Commonwealth panel.
