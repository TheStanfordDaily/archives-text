# Mandela may gain freedom
## 
### 
CAPE TOWN. South Africa —
South Africa's leading financial news
paper, Business Day, quoted an
unnamed senior figure in the ruling
National Party yesterday as saying
that a Cabinet majority backed by
President Pieter Botha was now in fa
vor of releasing African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela
from prison and that he could be free
before Easter.
The report filled expectations here
that Botha's offer last Friday to free
Mandela was more than a public
relations ploy.
Conversations with National Party
members of Parliament and speeches
by Cabinet ministers this week indi
cate, however, that if Mandela is
released it will not be with a view to
negotiating with him and his

outlawed African nationalist move
ment about South Africa's future.
Instead, the white minority govern
ment seems to be considering his
release as part of a strategy aimed at
neutralizing the ANC, while seeking
to draw the more moderate Zulu
leader, Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, into
negotiations for a new constitution
that would give the black majority a
role in the running of the country for
the first time.
A series of speeches by senior gov
ernment members, including Defense
Minister Magnus Malan, has
denounced the ANC in even more
vehement terms than usual. Tuesday
Malan also warned neighboring black
countries in a speech in Parliament
that South Africa might launch more
cross-border raids if they did not ac
cept an offer by Botha to join South

Africa in establishing an organization
to supervise regional security.
The spate of warnings and denun
ciations seemed designed to put the
ANC beyond the pale as an organiza
tion to be negotiated with, and set the
stage for an intensified counterinsur
gency drive against it.
The thinking appears to be that
Mandela can be "demythologized" if
he is released and then seen to be
unable to bring about any dramatic
political transformation, while But
helezi is seen making progress in the
negotiations.
After an initial period, during
which his release might cause a surge
of black expectations, his image
would begin to fade and so help bring
about the decline of the ANC, the
thinking goes.
There are also fears of what would

happen should Mandela, who is 67
and recently underwent surgery for
the removal of his prostate gland, die
in prison. This could trigger large
scale unrest and, in the words of one
party sources, "give him eternal life."
The speculation follows Botha's
announcement Friday that he was
prepared to negotiate for Mandela's
release on humanitarian grounds if
the Soviet Union freed dissidents
Anatoly Scharansky and Andrei Sak
harov and Angola returned a South
African soldier, Wynand du Toit,
who was captured during a com
mando raid in that country last year.
Observers here believe Botha had
inside knowledge of these negotia
tions when he made his statement,
deliberately setting conditions he
knew might be met.
