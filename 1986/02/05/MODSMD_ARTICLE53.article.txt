# Reagan on State of the Union
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan issued a
sweeping call last night in his fifth State of the Un
ion message for an "agenda for the future" that in
cludes many of his past proposals plus new federal
studies on the problems of poverty, catastrophic ill
ness and currency instability.
In a nationally televised speech that celebrated
American accomplishments and purposefully
avoided painful budgetary details, the president
urged Congress to cut the domestic budget and
continue to increase military spending.
He also appealed for passage of "an historic tax
reform providing new opportunity for all" and
repeated his opposition to tax increases, even
though earlier in the day he had opened the door to
a possible imposition of an oil import fee.
The president pledged his support for arms con
trol and said that "if the Soviet government wants
an agreement that truly reduces nuclear arms, there
will be an agreement."
Reagan made no mention of the Jan. 15 proposal
by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev calling for
staged reductions of U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsen
als leading to the total elimination of them by the
end of the century.
Reagan's speech was postponed a week because
of the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger.
Opening his address, Reagan said Americans
"mourn and honor the valor of our seven Chal
lenger heroes. And I hope we are now ready to do
what they would want us to do — go forward
America, reach for the stars." Later in the speech,
Reagan promised: "We are going forward with our
shuttle flights; we are going forward to build our
space station."

Reagan said that the budget he will submit to
Congress today "will meet the Gramm-Rudman-
Hollings target for deficit reductions; meet our
commitment to ensure a strong national defense;
meet our commitment to protect Social Security

and the less fortunate; and, yes, meet our commit
ment not to raise taxes,"
The president's preference for reductions in
domestic rather than military spending was strongly
emphasized in a passage in which he spoke of the
"Soviet drive for domination" and said, "The
Soviets must know that if America reduces her
defenses, it will be because of a reduced threat, not
a reduced resolve."
Reagan repeated his appeal for a missile defense
plan, which he referred to as "a security shield
(that) can one day render nuclear weapons ob
solete and free mankind from the prison of nuclear
terror." The Soviets have insisted that the pro
posal, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), is a
barrier to an agreement limiting offensive nuclear
weapons, and domestic critics of the plan have
questioned its feasibility.
Of the new proposals made by Reagan last
night, the potentially most far-reaching is a year
long study he ordered undertaken by the White
House Domestic Council headed by Attorney Gen
eral Edwin Meese. The president said this study
will evaluate programs and develop "a strategy for
immediate action to meet the financial, educa
tional, social and safety concerns of poor people."
The president's other new proposal, one he has
favored since he was governor of California, is a
study that will be directed by Health and Human
Services Secretary Otis Bowen on ways to provide
affordable health insurance for Americans "whose
life savings would otherwise be threatened when
catastrophic illness strikes." The Administration is
expected to ask Congress soon to expand Medicare
to cover catastrophic illness costs for the elderly.
