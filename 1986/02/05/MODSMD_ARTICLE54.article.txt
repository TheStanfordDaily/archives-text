Senate approves sale
WASHINGTON — In a long-awaited victory
for the Reagan Administration, the Senate yes
terday approved the sale of Conrail, the
government-owned freight railroad, to Norfolk
Southern for $ 1.2 billion.
By a vote of 54-39, the Senate »>ent the contro
versial measure creating the nation's largest rail
merger to the Democratic-controlled House,
where opponents of the sale have vowed to con
tinue their fight.
Shuttle was troublesome
WASHINGTON — Even before the destruc
tion last week of the space shuttle Challenger, the
nation's pre-eminent space program was beset
with serious financial and bureaucratic problems,
including reluctant customers, extraordinary cost
overruns and a White House determined to make
the shuttle pay for itself, according to govern
ment documents and informed officials.
There is no evidence tying the Jan. 28
catastrophe to NASA's drive to lower costs and
increase the number of launches.
Meanwhile investigators in Florida may be
closer to determing the cause of the explosion as

one of two solid rocket boosters from the space
shuttle Challenger was believed to have been de
tected on the seafloor yesterday by a National
Aeronautics and Space Administration recovery
ship.
Espionage trial opens
ALEXANDRIA, Va. — Lawyers for retired
CIA analyst Larry Wu-Tai Chin acknowledged

improve Sino-American relations, not to harm
U.S. security.
As Chin's espionage trial opened in federal
district court, defense attorney Jacob Stein ad
mitted that one of the documents was President
Nixon's secret communique to Congress on the
eve of the U.S. rapprochement with China

land, construct new embassies and rebuild
facilities at 66 locations around the world, includ
ing $89 million for a new office building chancery
in Vienna, $83.4 million for a new embassy in Tel
Aviv and $41 million for a consulate building in
