Manson denied parole
SAN QUENTIN — Charles Manson, serving a
life term for the massacre of actress Sharon Tate
and six others, was denied parole a sixth time
yesterday after telling a parole board he would
pursue his dream of a violent revolution if
released.
Manson, 51, wearing a blue swastika on his
forehead and long, graying hair and beard, said
he spends his time in prison making scorpion
dolls which give "the power of the revolution to
the people."
If paroled. Manson said, he'd "probably join
the revolution down south somewhere and try to
save my life on the planet Earth. I might go to
Libya. I might go see the Ayatollah (leader of
Iran). I might go to France, catch somebody in
France I'm upset with."
Manson. who will not be eligible for another
parole hearing for three years, had told prison of
ficials he planned to boycott the hearing before a
panel of the state Board of Prison Terms as he
did the last time in 1982. He changed his mind

yesterday morning after writing a rambling, often
incoherent 20-page speech on a yellow legal pad
the night before.
Manson had told prison officials he did not
want an attorney for the hearing, but the state as
signed him one to avoid the possibility of later
complaints.
Manson and four members of his so-called
"family" of followers were convicted in the Au
gust 1969 Los Angeles slayings of Tate, four of
her guests and two other people in a separate at
tack the following night.
FBI disclosure is sought
PICO RIVERA — A coalition of religious
groups supporting sanctuary for Central Ameri
can refugees says it will try to force the govern
ment to disclose any infiltration of the sanctuary
movement.
Chainsaws were often used during a spate of
church break-ins in 11 U.S. cities over the past
15 months. The burglaries mostly have involved

rifling of files but rarely theft.
More than 300 churches nationwide have ex
tended sanctuary to refugees of political strife in
Central America in violation of federal immigra
tion law.
The Interfaith Task Force on Central America
will file for disclosure under the Freedom of In
formation Act, spokeswoman Sister Jo' Ann de
Quattro said yesterday. The task force wants to
know if the break-ins involved covert activity by
such agencies as the FBI or Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
FBI and INS officials alike called allegations of
their agencies' involvement in such break-ins ab
surd.
Cloudy weather today
Cloudy today, with a chance of sprinkles or
light rain in the early morning, then partial clear
ing this afternoon. Highs in the mid sds to lower
60s.
