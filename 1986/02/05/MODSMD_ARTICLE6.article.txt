# Seniors praise education, criticize frosh advising
## 
### ALLISON HARTWELL Editorial staff 
Members of the Class of '85 are pleased with
the quality of their education here but dis
satisfied with the advising system, according to a
survey released yesterday.
Fifty-three percent of those who responded
to the University's annual Senior Survey rated
the overall quality of their undergraduate edu
cation at Stanford as "excellent," with 44 per
cent giving it a "good" rating and 3 percent
giving it an "average" rating.
Five years ago, 35 percent of the seniors rated
Stanford "excellent."
The survey was distributed last spring to
graduating seniors, approximately one-third of
whom replied.
Audrey Bernfield, director of Undergraduate
Advising, questioned the Senior Survey's
validity because of the number of seniors who
participated.
"I think the people who have had a successful
experience ... or who already have a job"
would be more likely to complete the survey, the
said, adding that the survey "does not necessar
ily reflect the students as a whole."
She said that she hoped "the other 77 per
cent" of the students were also pleased with
their undergraduate education.
Forty percent of those surveyed gave their
freshman advisers a "very poor" or "poor"
rating, while 31 percent checked an "excellent"
or "very good" rating.
Seniors gave advisers in their major field a
slightly better rating, with 40 percent receiving
an "excellent" or a "very good" rating, and 32
percent receiving a "poor" or "very poor"
rating.

Bernfield said that, on the whole, she is "very
pleased" with the advising system, adding that
"every year we've improved advising." She said
the Undergraduate Advising Center conducted
its own survey of freshmen and sophomores last
year, which revealed positive attitudes toward
advising, adding that recent improvements in
advising would not be reflected in the Senior
Survey.
Carolyn Lougee, associate dean of
Humanities and Sciences, said that the Univer
sity is "reconsidering the questions" used in the
survey to better reflect changes in curriculum
and "in our aspirations for undergraduate edu
cation."
Lougee also said the small number of seniors
responding to the survey is "disturbing." She
said questionnaires may be passed out to this
year's graduating class when they get their
diplomas to increase participation in the survey.
Overall, the seniors surveyed said they were
very pleased with the faculty. Ninety-two per
cent of those questioned gave the faculty an
"excellent" or "very good" rating "as scholars
and researchers," with 66 percent giving the
same rating to faculty "as teachers."
Fifty-seven percent of the seniors planned
full-time work, while 31 percent planned full
time study after graduation.
Seniors with very low or very high parental
incomes were more likely to pursue full-time
work after graduation than those with average
parental incomes, while those seniors with par
ents in the middle-income bracket were more
likely to seek further education, the survey said.
Those who majored in civil engineering, earth
sciences and economics were more likely to
pursue employment after graduation
than seniors in biology, chemistry,
languages or English.
According to the survey, the
seniors with lower grades planned to
pursue full-time employment, while
those with higher grades were more
likely to continue their education.
Almost 60 percent of the senior
women and 55 percent of the senior
men planned to work full-time, while
one-third of the men and 28 percent
of the women planned to attend
graduate school, the survey said.
Fifty-five percent of blacks,
Chicanos and native Americans who
responded to the survey said they
planned to work full-time after
graduation, compared to 61 percent
of the Caucasians surveyed.
Generally, seniors were pleased
with teaching assistants, with 42 per
cent of those surveyed rating "the
general quality of TAs" as "very
good," 37 percent as "average," 9
percent as "excellent" and 9 percent
as "poor."
