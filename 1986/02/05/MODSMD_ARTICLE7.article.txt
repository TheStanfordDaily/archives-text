# Frosh may hear more about honor code
## 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
In its monthly meeting yesterday,
the Stanford Honor Code Commis
sion set aside discussion of code vio
lations to examine efforts for educat
ing more people about the code.
Chemistry Prof. Hans Andersen, a
member of the commission, said the
most important "generic question"
facing the group is how to dis
seminate information about the
Honor Code to the public.
"Instead of looking for new things
that we should publicize, we should
figure out how to publicize what
we're already charged with publiciz
ing," Andersen said.
The commission is working to bet
ter inform freshmen about the Honor
Code before and after their arrival at
the University.
Mike Schiller, a graduate student
who sits on the commission, said "at
least a minimal effort" should be

made to include mention of the
Honor Code during freshman orien
tation.
Sally Cole, the University's judicial
affairs adviser, objected to Schiller's
proposal, stating that it would take
too long to implement and would not
have any immediate impact on
publicity efforts.
"You're talking about a require
ment that (would be) so different
from the approach we've taken with
respect to anything that it would be a
policy change," she said.
Sophomore Keith Nashawaty, an
other member of the commission,
suggested that freshmen be informed
about the Honor Code during quiet,
informal meetings with their aca
demic advisers. He noted that such
meetings would be more effective
than discussing the code during orien
tation, when Honor Code informa
tion could easily be buried in the mass
of other orientation materials.

Spreading information through ad
visers "is one way to make it so you
don't have someone before a packed
crowd on the first day when nobody's
hearing what anybody's saying,"
Nashawaty said.
"We're talking about getting (Law
Prof.) John Kaplan or someone to
give an anecdote about why the
Honor Code is important. Advisers
could do that in a small group where
they have everybody's attention,'' he
added.
"As a freshman last year, (I felt)
there was always that kind of ambigu
ous cloud hovering over everything,'*
Nashawaty said. "There really is
something to be said about educating
people (as to) just what the Honor
Code is about."
The report investigating the viola
tions of the Honor Code in last
spring's Psychology 1 course is still in
draft form, according to Cole, who is
writing the report. She urged the

commission to concentrate on issues
independent of her report and its
ramifications until it is completed.
Ten students were charged in No
vember with cheating in Prof. Philip
Zimbardo's Psychology 1 class, with
two cases pending review.
Member John Goheen, special as
sistant to the ombudsperson, sugges
ted that the faculty's observance of
the Honor Code should also be
reviewed, in light of rumors about
faculty members unnecessarily proc
uring examinations.
Cole said that James Lyons, dean
of Student Affairs, will send letters to
incoming freshmen in April or May
informing them about details of the
Honor Code. The letters will be in
cluded in one of the general informa
tion packets new students receive
when they commit to register.
Cole said she didn't know whether
the mailing effort was a result of
recent Honor Code violations, but
added that it "might have" been.
