The problems in the Middle East can be solved by
"cooperation and development of the moral beliefs for
the people," according to Salah Feteih, a doctoral can
didate in aeronautics and astronautics.
In a discussion held in Sterling Quad last night,
Feteih outlined certain objectives that, if achieved,
would strengthen the Middle Eastern countries.
"The first objective would be to satisfy the moral
needs of the people; they are used to a certain way of
life and cannot be convinced to change their society"
because an outside force demands it, Feteih said.
Other objectives include "the self-sufficiency of the
countries, the development of education, the establish
ment of a minimum standard of living and a sense of
justice, especially in the area of income distribution,"
Feteih said.
Feteih, who is from Egypt, said efficiency is "very
low" in the Middle Eastern countries, adding that

countries should consolidate their resources, share ex
periences and work together to improve the economic
situations of their countries.
According to Feteih, the countries experience enor
mous debts because of several reasons: "The first rea
son is the corruption of the leaders; a lot of money goes
into the country and then disappears. Second, every
country is trying to do everything on its own; they need
to work together. Third, no leader has been elected by
true freedom of choice (of the people). Fourth, a loss
of confidence exists among the people," he said.
Hussein Al-Hussein, a doctoral candidate in electri
cal engineering from Jordan who also spoke at the dis
cussion, said that "The people (in the Middle East)
cannot separate their political beliefs from their faith."
Some of the problems in the Middle East can be at
tributed to the"the division of the Middle East into 22
countries," Hussein said. These countries should share
their experiences and pool their abilites in the political
and economical realm, he added.
