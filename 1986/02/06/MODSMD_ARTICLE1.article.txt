The Kappa Alpha fraternity has
not been punished for a Jan. 26 dis
turbance at a San Francisco hotel that
led to the arrests of three students,
and the fraternity is expected to han
dle the matter internally, according to
Fraternal Affairs Advisor Joseph
Pisano.
Two students were charged with
battery, disturbance of the peace and
indecent exposure after swimming
nude across a pool in the Fairmont
Hotel's Tonga room and subse
quently resisting hotel security guards
who attempted to restrain them and a
third student.
The incident occured at a celebra
tion ending "KA Fun Week."
Pisano met yesterday with KA
President George LeMaitre to deter
mine a course of action regarding the
incident. Pisano said he felt measures
taken within the fraternity would
prove most effective.
Disciplinary action "means more to
individuals if it comes internally,"
Pisano said. "What better way to
show that the house doesn't condone
such activity than by handling it
themselves?"
Pisano said LeMaitre had sched
uled an appointment with the man
agement of the San Francisco Fair
mont and that members involved
planned to write letters of apology to
the hotel.
Fairmont Hotel representatives
could not be reached for comment.
Pisano said he had not yet dis
cussed the matter with the Inter- Fra
ternity Council and could not deter
mine whether punitive action would
be directed toward the KAs.
Ajsst. Dean of Residential Educa
tion Tirana Conkh'n. who was in
formed of the arrests last week, said
yesterday she had discussed the mat
ter with Pisano, but the two had not
decided upon a possible official
response to the incident.
