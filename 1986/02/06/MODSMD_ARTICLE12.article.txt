# Credit unions getting popular
## 
### RICK KUWAYTI Staff Writer 
At a time when federal loans and
grants for higher education are being
cut back, students at campuses across
the country are turning to campus
credit unions as an alternative source
of funding.
According to the National Credit
Union Association, students on 12
college campuses, including UC-
Berkeley, have been granted federal
charters to run credit unions. Similar
charters are being sought by students
at 40 other colleges around the na
tion, including Harvard, Columbia
and Cornell.
"We're a student-run financial in
stitution," said Lawrence Orecklin,
the president of the Cal Berkeley
Federal Credit Union. Orecklin, a
senior in economics, conceived the
idea in the summer of 1984.
"We didn't feel the banks in the
area were serving the needs of the
students," he said.
Today, six months after it opened
its doors, Orecklin says the Cal
Berkeley Federal Credit Union has
assets of $500,000 and about 750
members.
Originally, Orecklin tried to con
vince Stanford students to begin a
student-run credit union here, but he
was not successful.

One of the reasons the Stanford
plan failed was the existence of the
Stanford Federal Credit Union,
Orecklin said.
In December 1984, the Stanford
Federal Credit Union expanded its
field of membership to include under
graduate students.
"Stanford students have a credit
union— this is it," said Warren Mar
shall, president of the credit union,
which is located on Pampas Lane
near the fire station. Marshall
believes the credit union is very ad
vantageous to students.
"What [the students] are looking at
is the ability to save and borrow
money at a very low rate, because the
credit union is member-owned and
operated," Marshall said.
"Credit unions are really financial
co-ops — whatever money our mem
bers save is loaned out," Marshall
said. "We have money to lend
because the Stanford community
is so large."
Although the Stanford Federal
Credit Union is not student-operated,
Marshall emphasized that a student
could conceivably serve on the Board
of Directors which operates the credit
union. "The capability of being on
the leadership of the credit union is
there," he said.
Adele Gonzalez, the credit union's
vice president of marketing, estimates

that about 1,000 of the credit union's
18,000 members are undergraduates.
"We're here to help them with their
finances," she said.
Becoming a member of the Stan
ford Federal Credit Union is easy, ac
cording to Gonzalez. Members must
be Stanford students, faculty, staff, or
their relatives, she said.
After paying a one-time $5 mem
bership fee, the member must open a
$50 minimum savings account, and
then the member can take advantage
of all the credit union's services, Gon
zalez said.
Marshall says the credit union is a
non-profit organization. "Everybody
changes fees. .. . The whole concept
of our fees is for service, not for
profit," he said, adding, "Banks are
out for profit. We offer the same
services as they do, but we're not out
for a profit."
According to Marshall, the Stan
ford Federal Credit Union will be of
fering federally guaranteed student
loans in September. The credit union
currently offers computer loans and
new and used car loans for students,
Marshall said. "It's more difficult to
get a used car loan at a bank or a
savings and loan. ... We do that
here," he said, adding that most loans
are approved within 24 hours.


The proposed site of the addition to the Graduate School of Business has some concerned that the building
will "destroy the integrity of this park land" and "set the worst kind of precedent."
