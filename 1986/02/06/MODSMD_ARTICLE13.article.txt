The loss of seven lives and a $1.2 billion spacecraft
in last week's explosion of the space shuttle Challenger
has raised many questions about the wisdom and
feasibility of space research programs. The Reagan
Administration and the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration are determined to press on with
research after a careful investigation of the tragedy,
but now is an ideal time to question more deeply the
role and objectives of the U.S. space program.
While it is important that the nation devote a great
deal of energy to solving critical problems here on
earth, we must also forge ahead with peaceful and sen
sible exploration of space. Space represents the un
known, a place where people of all nations can work
together to further man's knowledge and improve his
way of life. The public outpouring of emotion at the
shuttle disaster is proof of the widespread interest in
space and what it represents.
However, space research for military purposes —
such as that for the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI)
— is entirely unacceptable given the risks of a system
infinitely more complex than the space shuttle. The
space shuttle is representative of America's most ad
vanced technology; if it cannot be perfected, what can
we expect from a space program on the level of SDI?
Any system designed to create a defensive umbrella
against incoming missiles must be 100 percent success
ful, or it will not be successful at all; one nuclear
weapon could cause unprecedented and unacceptable
destruction of lives and property.

We must also question the wisdom of continuing
SDI research given the potential political ramifications
of a program so destabilizing to arms control efforts
with the Soviet Union.
A defensive system has never been developed that
has not been overcome by a corresponding buildup of
offensive weapons on the other side. SDI would force
the Soviets to match the United States step for step,
further escalating the arms race at a great cost to
citizens on both sides.
The Soviet Union has already expressed great con
cern over SDI, seeing the program as a provocative
measure that will lead to the militarization of space.
The United States may be able to get deep cuts in So
viet weapons if only it would put SDI on the bargaining
table, thereby ending a dangerous program while re
ducing some of the 50,000 nuclear warheads in the
world today.
The space program and the military have tradition
ally been closely linked. Indeed, it was the military that
saved the space shuttle when some questioned its
worth during development. The link must be broken,
so that productive, peaceful work can continue, and
destabilizing military research that threatens human
existence can be stopped.
Military space research is not worth the political, fin
ancial or human cost. If anything good can come of the
disaster and the loss of seven brave individuals, per
haps it will be a sensible reformulation of our space
program.
