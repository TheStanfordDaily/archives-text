Limit democracy
to leash interests
In his viewpoint article (Daily, Feb.
4), Mike Tarpey states that our par
ticular form of democracy is spoiled
by the power of special interests
(which he identifies solely with big
business). I agree that special inter
ests are a problem, but the solution is
not to widen the scope of democracy.
What you would get, at best, is
oppression by the majority; it is
oppression either way. The genius of
the Founding Fathers was not, as Tar
pey says, in establishing democracy,
but rather in limiting the democracy
they established. Their fault was that
they did not limit it enough.
Tarpey's advocacy of com
munitarian socialism, though he ex
plicitly avoids the "S" word, deserves
special comment. As Michael Walzer
argues in "Beyond The New Left," a
communitarian socialist community
would soon find itself ruled by an ac
tivist elite. Furthermore, whenever
one body, the government, controls
the means of production, there is no
room for dissent. As Trotsky said
(roughly), "He who does not
cooperate shall not eat."
What we need is not more
democracy, but less. Not the rule of
men, but the rule of law. A govern
ment's function should be to protect
the rights of each person to his life,
liberty and property, and to allow
people to trade freely in pursuit of
their own self-interest. In such a sys
tem, the special interests could not
use the power of government to get
fat at other people's expense.

Rawls misses U.S.
history of racism
This is a reply to A. Rawls' letter
(Daily, Jan. 30).
Mr. Rawls had the audacity to
accuse Africans of what he termed
the worst record on the oppression of
minorities. Given that Africans have
borne the brunt of oppression for
centuries, nothing could be more ar
rogant than his accusation.
Is it not a fact that in the United
States, the land of the "free," millions
of black Americans were forced, un
der threat of lynching, to vote for
their bitterest enemies, such as Sen.
Bilbao? Who is responsible for the
massacre of Indians in the U.S.? Did
we not all witness spontaneous crude
racism in Philadelphia a few months
ago? With that kind of record, who is
Mr. Rawls to point an accusing finger
at Africa?
Africans have only just emerged
from the heat of oppression per
petrated upon them by the self
proclaimed Western democracies.
This emergence is still incomplete, as
in most of Africa, minorities still
monopolize economic wealth and the
best educational facilities.
I urge Mr. Rawls to help Africans
in Azania fight off domination by the
very same Europeans we welcomed
to our continent as they strode in with
their bibles.

DUs got bum rap
This letter is in response to an arti

cle appearing on the front page of
The Daily on Jan. 31, entitled "Police
Put DUs on Hold." According to the
article, police had to close down a
party at the house because of an ap
parent prank phone call that
"originated from a phone located in
the DU house." The call tied up the
police 911 emergency line.
To clear up the facts, the police did
not shut down the party. House mem
bers voluntarily closed the bar and
turned down the music 20 minutes
after the police arrived. Secondly, the
members of the fraternity are capable
of entertaining themselves in a fpr
more constructive manner than by
jeopardizing the Stanford commu
nity. Any one of the guests could
have used the public pay phone lo
cated in the middle of the party area
to perform the act. We think it would
behoove responsible individuals
within the administration to
thoroughly assimilate the facts of in
cidence as they actually happened
before jumping to hasty conclusions
as to the guilt or character of a group
of people.
Furthermore, we find it disturbing
that The Daily continually sensation
alizes rather mundane events and, in
the process, only reinforces its
reputation as a bastion of mediocre
journalism. Surely The Daily can find
more noteworthy items to put on its
front page, thereby enhancing its ef
fectiveness, credibility and reputa
tion. Perhaps the new editors of this
volume will take heed of this sugges
tion and improve the quality of The
Daily where other editors have failed.

by the power of special interests
(which he identifies solely with big
business). I agree that special inter
ests are a problem, but the solution is
not to widen the scope of democracy.
What you would get, at best, is
oppression by the majority; it is
oppression either way. The genius of
the Founding Fathers was not, as Tar
pey says, in establishing democracy,
but rather in limiting the democracy
they established. Their fault was that
they did not limit it enough.
Tarpey's advocacy of com
munitarian socialism, though he ex
plicitly avoids the "S" word, deserves
special comment. As Michael Walzer
argues in "Beyond The New Left," a
communitarian socialist community
would soon find itself ruled by an ac
tivist elite. Furthermore, whenever
one body, the government, controls
the means of production, there is no
room for dissent. As Trotsky said
(roughly), "He who does not
cooperate shall not eat."
What we need is not more
democracy, but less. Not the rule of
men, but the rule of law. A govern
ment's function should be to protect
the rights of each person to his life,
liberty and property, and to allow
people to trade freely in pursuit of
their own self-interest. In such a sys
tem, the special interests could not
use the power of government to get
fat at other people's expense.

Rawls misses U.S.
history of racism
This is a reply to A. Rawls' letter
(Daily, Jan. 30).
Mr. Rawls had the audacity to
accuse Africans of what he termed
the worst record on the oppression of
minorities. Given that Africans have
borne the brunt of oppression for
centuries, nothing could be more ar
rogant than his accusation.
Is it not a fact that in the United
States, the land of the "free," millions
of black Americans were forced, un
der threat of lynching, to vote for
their bitterest enemies, such as Sen.
Bilbao? Who is responsible for the
massacre of Indians in the U.S.? Did
we not all witness spontaneous crude
racism in Philadelphia a few months
ago? With that kind of record, who is
Mr. Rawls to point an accusing finger
at Africa?
Africans have only just emerged
from the heat of oppression per
petrated upon them by the self
proclaimed Western democracies.
This emergence is still incomplete, as
in most of Africa, minorities still
monopolize economic wealth and the
best educational facilities.
I urge Mr. Rawls to help Africans
in Azania fight off domination by the
very same Europeans we welcomed
to our continent as they strode in with
their bibles.

DUs got bum rap
This letter is in response to an arti

cle appearing on the front page of
The Daily on Jan. 31, entitled "Police
Put DUs on Hold." According to the
article, police had to close down a
party at the house because of an ap
parent prank phone call that
"originated from a phone located in
the DU house." The call tied up the
police 911 emergency line.
To clear up the facts, the police did
not shut down the party. House mem
bers voluntarily closed the bar and
turned down the music 20 minutes
after the police arrived. Secondly, the
members of the fraternity are capable
of entertaining themselves in a fpr
more constructive manner than by
jeopardizing the Stanford commu
nity. Any one of the guests could
have used the public pay phone lo
cated in the middle of the party area
to perform the act. We think it would
behoove responsible individuals
within the administration to
thoroughly assimilate the facts of in
cidence as they actually happened
before jumping to hasty conclusions
as to the guilt or character of a group
of people.
Furthermore, we find it disturbing
that The Daily continually sensation
alizes rather mundane events and, in
the process, only reinforces its
reputation as a bastion of mediocre
journalism. Surely The Daily can find
more noteworthy items to put on its
front page, thereby enhancing its ef
fectiveness, credibility and reputa
tion. Perhaps the new editors of this
volume will take heed of this sugges
tion and improve the quality of The
Daily where other editors have failed.
