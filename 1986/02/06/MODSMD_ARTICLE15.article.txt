## Idealists must retain convictions 
### 
When I came to Stanford I carried a bright, bur
ning torch. It was the light of Truth and Justice, and
1 held it aloft before me as the symbol of what I
would accomplish. I came to this great temple of
Enlightenment to be made wise in the ways of
Power and Right, that I might stride forth one day
to end all the Wrongs and Injustices that I saw,

LORNE NEEDLE

smiting Evil forever from the world. The poor and
oppressed would flock to me as I wielded my di
ploma: slaying brutal dictators, driving corrupt,
manipulative multinationals to their bloated knees,
dispensing food, human rights, political power,
equitable distributions of income and minimum
standards of living to all who had awaited them so
long.
I believed that. Seriously. Maybe not on such a
grand scale, but I knew that one day oppressors,
landlords and Republicans would tremble in fear at
the mention of my name. It's easy for a young
idealist to believe that his or her forthrightness, in
tegrity and dedication will guarantee instant access
to the means to cure this world's ills.
I don't think that any more. I still want to see
everyone's life made better, but I have no idea how
to do it. At first it is a heady thing to learn so much
in poli sci, history and Western Culture classes
about how the current world developed. Then you
start to learn about how things are now, and it isn't
a party anymore. Boy, in my high school history
classes the world got brighter and righter every day
as the United States of America grew and spread.
Boy, modern medicine, communications, agricul

tural techniques and other technology were
making life better for just about everyone. Then
Professor Reality strolled into class, shook my hand
with a smile, and offered to show me the pictures
he carried around in his wallet. That's when I
started to ache.
Is it really true? Are there more starving
wretches on this earth than ever before, and are
their numbers growing even as their bellies shrink
and their brains rot from malnutrition? Are the rich
getting richer in Third World countries while the
common people suffer, and is the world becoming
more of an angry, armed camp each day? Well, at
least America can spread some good in the gloom
and doom, and improve things. No? You mean the
Indians weren't happy to move onto the reserva
tions, that we annihilated them to get control of this

I'm left feeling very
empty . . .

country? Are the same elite that have power in
repressive countries really in control of the power
in this country, and are they using it to further their
ends at our expense? Isn't the government stepping
in to keep those multinational corporations from
exploiting the resources and peoples of weaker
countries? How can we be propping up autocratic
regimes for their strategic and economic value to
us, even as we claim to be defending the rights and
liberties of their peoples? Well, we must be doing it
for their own good in the long run, and anyway

Americans wouldn't vote for any government that
did such things. Is it really happening that the cur
rent administration is working to undermine every
noble accomplishment of the last 100 years,
and is it true that the vast majority of Americans
support its efforts? Are people really so narrow and
selfish that they don't care, and so blind that they
don't realize that they will only suffer from it in the
long run?
Yes. Yes, there is no force of good in my world
that can stand up to all the overwhelming forces of
bad. Yes, things will continue to get worse, and
people will get more and more self-centered and
stupid. We at universities may care, and may think
about solutions to the world's problems, but the
vast majority of people do not and will not consider
anything but how to get richer and keep my stink
ing hands off of what is rightfully theirs. Oh — they
want to get those Commies, too.
I still care, and I still wish something could be
done to improve this poor world. However, I think
even a tiny bit of progress would be a hell of an ac
complisment, and I doubt even that will come. I
have no answers right now, just a bunch of agoniz
ing facts to weigh me down. The pleasure of hurling
them in the face of Reagan and the rest of the bad
guys is small and doesn't last very long. I'm left
feeling very empty most of the time.
How about you? I don't mean to rain on your
parade. This is not a call to give it up and go home.
It is the duty of every feeling human being to try to
improve the lot of his or her fellows, and if I have
any message at all, it's to keep at it. But, to those
idealists who are scared, depressed, and dreading
the future: you're not alone. So what do we do?

noble accomplishment of the last 100 years,
and is it true that the vast majority of Americans
support its efforts? Are people really so narrow and
selfish that they don't care, and so blind that they
don't realize that they will only suffer from it in the
long run?
Yes. Yes, there is no force of good in my world
that can stand up to all the overwhelming forces of
bad. Yes, things will continue to get worse, and
people will get more and more self-centered and
stupid. We at universities may care, and may think
about solutions to the world's problems, but the
vast majority of people do not and will not consider
anything but how to get richer and keep my stink
ing hands off of what is rightfully theirs. Oh — they
want to get those Commies, too.
I still care, and I still wish something could be
done to improve this poor world. However, I think
even a tiny bit of progress would be a hell of an ac
complisment, and I doubt even that will come. I
have no answers right now, just a bunch of agoniz
ing facts to weigh me down. The pleasure of hurling
them in the face of Reagan and the rest of the bad
guys is small and doesn't last very long. I'm left
feeling very empty most of the time.
How about you? I don't mean to rain on your
parade. This is not a call to give it up and go home.
It is the duty of every feeling human being to try to
improve the lot of his or her fellows, and if I have
any message at all, it's to keep at it. But, to those
idealists who are scared, depressed, and dreading
the future: you're not alone. So what do we do?

When I came to Stanford I carried a bright, bur
ning torch. It was the light of Truth and Justice, and
1 held it aloft before me as the symbol of what I
would accomplish. I came to this great temple of
Enlightenment to be made wise in the ways of
Power and Right, that I might stride forth one day
to end all the Wrongs and Injustices that I saw,

smiting Evil forever from the world. The poor and
oppressed would flock to me as I wielded my di
ploma: slaying brutal dictators, driving corrupt,
manipulative multinationals to their bloated knees,
dispensing food, human rights, political power,
equitable distributions of income and minimum
standards of living to all who had awaited them so
long.
I believed that. Seriously. Maybe not on such a
grand scale, but I knew that one day oppressors,
landlords and Republicans would tremble in fear at
the mention of my name. It's easy for a young
idealist to believe that his or her forthrightness, in
tegrity and dedication will guarantee instant access
to the means to cure this world's ills.
I don't think that any more. I still want to see
everyone's life made better, but I have no idea how
to do it. At first it is a heady thing to learn so much
in poli sci, history and Western Culture classes
about how the current world developed. Then you
start to learn about how things are now, and it isn't
a party anymore. Boy, in my high school history
classes the world got brighter and righter every day
as the United States of America grew and spread.
Boy, modern medicine, communications, agricul

tural techniques and other technology were
making life better for just about everyone. Then
Professor Reality strolled into class, shook my hand
with a smile, and offered to show me the pictures
he carried around in his wallet. That's when I
started to ache.
Is it really true? Are there more starving
wretches on this earth than ever before, and are
their numbers growing even as their bellies shrink
and their brains rot from malnutrition? Are the rich
getting richer in Third World countries while the
common people suffer, and is the world becoming
more of an angry, armed camp each day? Well, at
least America can spread some good in the gloom
and doom, and improve things. No? You mean the
Indians weren't happy to move onto the reserva
tions, that we annihilated them to get control of this

country? Are the same elite that have power in
repressive countries really in control of the power
in this country, and are they using it to further their
ends at our expense? Isn't the government stepping
in to keep those multinational corporations from
exploiting the resources and peoples of weaker
countries? How can we be propping up autocratic
regimes for their strategic and economic value to
us, even as we claim to be defending the rights and
liberties of their peoples? Well, we must be doing it
for their own good in the long run, and anyway

Americans wouldn't vote for any government that
did such things. Is it really happening that the cur
