# Of trains and friendships
## 
### 
During the winter months, a ceiling of dense, leaden
clouds unrolls over the Netherlands. The sky seems ab
normally close overhead, tangible and cold; the city is like
a vast cave lined with dirty cotton. Trains run twice daily
from the Amsterdam central station to the main Bahnhof
in West Berlin.
The 12-hour ride is monotonous and grey, only miles of
unnaturally flat, watersoaked farmland filling the train
windows.
My memory of the weekend in Amsterdam is al
ternately quite vivid, and then strangely incomplete, shot
through with distortions and amnesiac lapses produced by
extreme fatigue and indiscriminate drug use. There are six
of us from Stanford on the train, enough to fill a compart
ment, and we have by tacit agreement fallen into an un
readable silence, into which I laugh periodically.
Two of us leave the compartment for some air, and
while I peer out the window, my friend finds another
American, a young woman in blue jeans, roughly our age,
neatly dressed, smiling and collegiate-looking. Black hair,

green down vest. Broad face with strong bones and good
skin, dominated by wide, dark eyes. I don't speak to her,
but when my friend leaves abruptly, we are left with each
other.
Her name is Barbara, and she's from Chicago. Her par
ents are Japanese, but she's American. We talk about how
at First she was worried about (traveling alone, but how it's
been no problem, really, because travelers are all in the
same boat, aliens by deFinition, and so they're nice to one
another for the short time they have together, and how
their similar problems and rituals and appurtenances
(money belts, train schedules, language barriers, clean un
derwear) all coalesce into a common culture of sorts. We
talk about her public policy major at the University of
Chicago, and how she wants to go to South America to
learn Spanish, and maybe eventually biz school. We verge
on getting personal. "Last summer," she says,"I was in
volved in something illegal." She doesn't elaborate, and
she doesn't seem bothered that this revelation might make
me think badly of her. "Drugs?" I ask. "No, no, no" she
says quickly. We move on to other things. World views.
Questions of existence and meaning. Standard "strangers
on a train" conversation.
She knows no German. I tear out a sheet of notebook
paper and write out some words and phrases, stuff she can
use to get around Berlin. Bitte: Please. Danke\ Thank you.
Entschuldigung: Excuse me.
As Fm writing, a furiously drunken German crashes
through the door and thumps down beside us. We decide
to visit the dining compartment, six cars away. He follows.
Arguing rapidly in viscous Berlin German, the man
breathes raw alcohol on me and cups my neck per
suasively. "Kein Deutsch," I say, exaggerating my Ameri
can intonation. "No German." No dice. He continues to
babble at me, without pity or apparent design. Barb grabs
my elbow and tries to get us through the narrow door, but
the man's blocking the way. He is large. We have reached
an impasse.

Suddenly Barbara reaches into her vest, pulls out my
lexicon. "Entschuldigung," she reads. She speaks the
word in a tone somewhere between deference and con
tempt and even I look at her for a second. The man
widens his eyes and steps away from the door. Barbara
glances down at the sheet again, and then up into the
man's eyes. "Danke," she says crisply. We walk through
the door.
When we arrive, she goes to meet the people she's
staying with in the main train station. I've written her
number down, and we've agreed to go to a cafe or
museum in Berlin. She's leaving on Thursday, so I'll call
before then. Her family, a young German couple, begins
to walk toward us, but I am too tired for introductions
right now. "I'll call you," I say and begin to move away.
There is a brief look of consternation on her face as I start
off, but she quickly corrects it, says goodbye, and turns
her attention to her new friends.
On Tuesday evening, I call the number she gave me. A
man answers. I ask, in my pathetic German, to speak with
Barbara. "You're American?" he answers in English. I
concede this. Barbara, he tells me, had a friend in Munich
she wanted to visit, and decided to leave a few days early.
There is a silence as I digest this. "Hello?" he says. Does
he have an address for her, I want to know? No, but per
haps his girlfriend does. I can call back later if I like. I
thank him and hang up.
I never called back. Part of it was that I knew Barbara
probably hadn't given them her address. She'd found
these people through a reference service, and had only
used them as a place to stay for a couple of days. It
seemed unlikely that the three of them would become pen
pals on that basis.
I told this story to my friend Michael several days later,
as we were walking down the Kurfurstendamm. My talk
was aimless and remote. "If I'd even called a day earlier,
you know?"
"I don't understand why this is bothering you," he said.
"No, I don't either. Maybe it's just being back in Berlin;
two million Germans, one less American. This isn't making
any sense, I know." There is a longish silence. "I mean,
people come and go, and there's always people you meet
once and never see again, but... I guess the context was
what made it seem so stark." It sounds hollow as I say it. I
grope for a metaphor to augment or clarify my thoughts:
what — spray in the ocean? Spray flung up into the air for
a moment, then falling back. Trying to get one of those
drops back out.. .
"Did you really like her?" Mike asks me.
"It wasn't a romantic thing, I just, yes, I really liked her,
and it's just that.. . chances are I'll probably never . .."
My hands made a gesture of futility.
"You don't know her last name?" I shook my head.
"But she's at University of Chicago, right, and she's
probably got a Japanese last name. Get a directory and
check all the Barbaras who — "
"She graduated. She was a senior last year. She's
graduated now."
Michael thought for a minute. Hands deep in his over
coat pockets, he shrugged. "I think you're up a creek."
We kept walking.
"That's too bad," he said finally.
"Yeah. It just seems like ..." I thought about it for a
moment, and after a while, the word came to me. "It
seems wasteful," I said.
Michael smiled, still looking down at the pavement. A
crinkle of vague empathy touched his eyes; then he shook
his head. "You can't dwell on that stuff, though," he said.
"No, you really can't," I agreed.
