# CAMPUS COMPENDIUM

### 
Just when you thought you'd heard it all
First, there was Band Aid. Then Live Aid, then
Farm Aid, and now ...
Beer Aid.
It had to happen. Sooner or later, a bunch of college
guys looking for an excuse to party would be sitting
around, picking the lint from between their toes, and
"We Are The World" would come on the radio.
("Heyyy! Wait a minute, guys! 1 got a great idea!")
Last Saturday night, four roommates in a UC-Santa
Barbara apartment raised a whopping $250 dollars for
the USA for Africa relief fund by throwing a campus
wide bash they called "Beer Aid." Two hundred
UCSB students came to party down for starving
Africans, philanthropically draining one keg and 28
cases of beer before police broke up the fundraiser just
before midnight.
The roommates raised money by charging 50 cents
per beer and $8 for a custom-made Beer Aid T-shirt,
in which the"i" in Aid is a bottle of Budweiser.
"With Live Aid and everything, it just kind of
dawned on us to do this," said Rob Ackles, one of the
party organizers. "First of all, we love to have a great
party. Second, if we're gonna party, we might as well
do it for a good cause.
"We party a lot in this house," Ackles continued,
"and I and all my roommates are pretty strong
believers in stopping not only world hunger, but apart
heid too."
Nelson Mandela's problems are over.
The partygoers were, for the most part, enthusiastic
about the event. (Of course, they were interviewed
while the party was going on.)
"It's always good to party for charity, to get drunk
for a cause," sophomore Scott Sokol said.
"I'm having a blast," junior Alan Peterson said.
"They'd party anyway, so it's cool to do it for a good
reason."
Only one partier, identified in the Santa Barbara
Daily Nexus as Susan, questioned the reason for hold
ing the event. "It's a good idea," she said timidly, "but
people are so wasted that they won't remember what
they did the night before."
Probably not But host George Alexander was still
high on the whole thing the next day.
"It was the most unbelievable party I've ever seen in
my two years living here," he exulted. "There were
only six desks smashed and no police for a long time."
Who knows, maybe Bob Geldof would have ap
proved.

. . . There's always more
How weird is Berkeley? Listen to this.
Some writer for the Daily Californian went for a
stroll around campus the other day to ask all the
strangers he met the following question: If you could
ask a stranger any question, what would it be?
Okay, that's weird enough. But as you might expect,
the answers transcended weird. Here are a few of the
best:
"Who is your favorite existential saint? I have Bill
Russell and Santa Claus — they play without a god but
they are in god space."
— Jonathan Montague, writer
"Which would you rather do, slide naked down a fifty
foot razor blade Or suck all the snot out of a dog's nose
until its head collapses?"
— Westin Fivecoat, senior
"What were you before you were born? That's an Old
Zen quote, so don't attribute it to me. Or when did you
stop caring about your grades? What's the most impor
tant ice cream you've ever eaten? When's the last time
you've seen a sunset?"
— Anonymous 7th-year art student
"I wouldn't ask people questions on the street. I don't
even want to see my name in print."
— Name withheld by request
"What are you doing here?"
— Scott Brooks, wealthy man about town
"If you could go up to a complete stranger and ask him
or her a question, what would it be?"
— Some smart aleck who doesn't deserve the satisfac
tion of seeing his name in the paper
Sometimes, you wonder why they even bother
