## Slow-burning Dresher ignites Stanford 
### LISA LYNCH Editorial staff 
I've come to the conclusion that
there are a lot of people desperately
seeking a satisfying avant-garde ex
perience — people who attend end
less computer-these and video-thats,
and wind up wondering if perhaps
avant-garde art is called avant-garde
because you aren't supposed to un
derstand it or enjoy it until years after
having experienced it.
Well, good news. There are still
things that haven't been done over
and over, yet are immediately moving
and enthralling despite their
"newness." Watching the Paul Dres
her Ensemble's Saturday night per
formance at Dinkelspiel, I found
myself thinking, "Now why hasn't
this been done before?" instead of
simply "What are they doing?"
The ensemble includes the young
composer Paul Dresher, drummer
Gene Reffkin and tenor Rinde Eck
ert. Dresher is known for his works in
chamber and orchestral composition,
experimental music and theater, live
electronics and ensemble perfor
mances. He draws on a variety of
music traditions — notably Eastern,
classical, contemporary rock and jazz
— and describes himself as a "pre
maximalist" (as opposed to a post
minimalist).
Eckert is the newest member of the
trio; he has been working with Dres
her since 1980. In addition to his
work with the Dresher Ensemble, he
has been involved with George
Coate's "How" trilogy, and has writ

ten and starred in several recent Bay
Area performances.
The performances began with
Dresher playing solo. He was then
joined by Reffkin, and finally, the trio
played as a unit.
Two pieces at the beginning of the
evening flexed the technical muscles
of Dresher's tape-processing ma
chine, an instrument which permits
live multi-track recording, mixing,
processing and immediate playback
of any sounds produced on stage.
This sort of machine was pioneered

by Robert Fripp of King Crimson and
Fripp/Eno fame; it creates a litany of
effects, from the saccharine to the
painful, and is probably one of the
most anal approaches imaginable to
the making of live music. It's the mis
sing link between live performance
and recorded music, entirely
computer-generated.
The first piece, "Dark Blue Cir
cumstances," was written by Dresher
for solo electric guitar and tape
processer. Dresher, standing coolly
amidst a sea of electronic apparatus,

began his piece so slowly it was a mo
ment before the audience realized he
wasn't simply playing the same chord
over and over.
The music almost seemed to want
to listen to itself, so carefully were the
notes drawn out, echoed and layered
over. One of the qualities of a tape
feedback device is that it allows the
musician to be an audience for the
piece while it is being performed.
Dresher was both performer and
detached observer. His posture
during the piece reminded me of a

lecture/demonstration by Fripp I'd
attended several weeks earlier. Fripp,
the consummate English gentleman,
used his tape-loop device as a
medium for the "gentlemanly"
playing of rock music. "Dark Blue
Circumstances" was a high-tech bal
lad with that same quality.
The second piece ("Destiny")
moves much more quickly. In fact, it
reminded me of an action/adventure
score for a frenetic movie. But
whereas a movie score can be trusted
to provide a predictable beat, Dres

her and Rifkin occasionally
sabotaged the smooth, fast surface of
"Destiny" by playing out of sync. The
slightly "off parts of the piece,
produced by either out-phase intru
sions by the tape-processing machine
or by a shift in the rhythms of the
performers themselves, added an in
teresting jazz-like quality to the
piece.
Both instrumental pieces were
compelling, but they were technical,
not emotional experiences. I found
myself admiring them rather than
being moved by them, much in the
way I'd admired George Coate's
recent multi-media RAREAREA yet
felt distanced from the performance.
That emotional distance vanished as
soon as tenor Rinde Eckert walked
onstage during "Was Are, Will Be,"
the third piece.
Eckert played the role of Bob, a
"bewildered man of the '80s." He
came on stage dressed in a suit and tie
and began shouting nonsense at the
audience, much in the manner of the
RAREAREA performers. However,
Eckert's direct, confrontational
delivery made the audience really
care about what he was saying, even
when it wasn't making any sense.
Nonsense words quickly turned
into a sung and spoken monologue,
and it was through this monologue, as
well as Eckert's dynamism, that the
audience was drawn into Bob's world.
It wasn't what Bob said that worked

jointed snatches of conversation), but
rather the way the words were
packaged by Eckert's marvelous
voice. Dresher and Reffkin provided
a seamless frame for the tenor's
monologue, and then, toward the end
of the piece, the instrumentation
stopped and Eckert's voice alone —
layered and returned to the audience
through the tape processer — created
the music. It was the ultimate in a
cappella. Eckert revealed himself as
an authentic one-man band.
"Slow Fire," the final piece of the
evening and the longest, is the first
part of an opera which premiered last
Nov. 8 at Los Angeles' Mark Taper
Forum. It is a continuation and a
fleshing-out of Bob's story; once
again, Eckert is the life force of the
performance. His character is a
demon possessed by technology and
weaponry (the title refers to a type of
rifle fire). Bob isn't anyone we
haven't seen before, but Eckert
proves that there can be an absolutely
fresh presentation of a hackneyed
character.
The set for "Slow Fire" was mini

mal — a series of doors that fall down
to reveal what seems to be a highway
and a screen hanging between plat
forms on which Dresher and Reffkin
are perched. Props appear out of
nowhere and pretend to be nothing
but props. A telephone emerges,
rising from the midst of Dresher's
keyboards. A suitcase appears and is
filled with floodlights.
Eckert sings about paranoia, nos
talgia and neurosis. At one point he
is driven into a frenzy because he
can't remember whether he's locked
his black Volvo (what will happen to
his sheepskin seat covers?). He con
tinually refers to his childhood expe
riences with cars and real estate (a
friend suggesting at one point that he
was trying to "buy his farm," a Mid
western euphemism for death).
Finally, though Eckert was a
crazed, desperate man. he was also
funny. His body movements, facial
expressions and the slightest inflec
tions of his voice evoked sustained
laughter — proof that the performer
had total control over his audience.
But though 1 felt controlled by Eck
ert, I didn't feel manipulated — I was
so caught up in his performance that I
was willing to let him take charge of
my reactions. As "Slow Fire" ended,
I felt burned out, but greatly moved.

processer. Dresher, standing coolly
amidst a sea of electronic apparatus,

began his piece so slowly it was a mo
ment before the audience realized he
wasn't simply playing the same chord
over and over.
The music almost seemed to want
to listen to itself, so carefully were the
notes drawn out, echoed and layered
over. One of the qualities of a tape
feedback device is that it allows the
musician to be an audience for the
piece while it is being performed.
Dresher was both performer and
detached observer. His posture
during the piece reminded me of a

lecture/demonstration by Fripp I'd
attended several weeks earlier. Fripp,
the consummate English gentleman,
used his tape-loop device as a
medium for the "gentlemanly"
playing of rock music. "Dark Blue
Circumstances" was a high-tech bal
lad with that same quality.
The second piece ("Destiny")
moves much more quickly. In fact, it
reminded me of an action/adventure
score for a frenetic movie. But
whereas a movie score can be trusted
to provide a predictable beat, Dres

her and Rifkin occasionally
sabotaged the smooth, fast surface of
"Destiny" by playing out of sync. The
slightly "off parts of the piece,
produced by either out-phase intru
sions by the tape-processing machine
or by a shift in the rhythms of the
performers themselves, added an in
teresting jazz-like quality to the
piece.
Both instrumental pieces were
compelling, but they were technical,
not emotional experiences. I found
myself admiring them rather than
being moved by them, much in the
way I'd admired George Coate's
recent multi-media RAREAREA yet
felt distanced from the performance.
That emotional distance vanished as
soon as tenor Rinde Eckert walked
onstage during "Was Are, Will Be,"
the third piece.
Eckert played the role of Bob, a
"bewildered man of the '80s." He
came on stage dressed in a suit and tie
and began shouting nonsense at the
audience, much in the manner of the
RAREAREA performers. However,
Eckert's direct, confrontational
delivery made the audience really
care about what he was saying, even
when it wasn't making any sense.
Nonsense words quickly turned
into a sung and spoken monologue,
and it was through this monologue, as
well as Eckert's dynamism, that the
audience was drawn into Bob's world.
It wasn't what Bob said that worked

jointed snatches of conversation), but
rather the way the words were
packaged by Eckert's marvelous
voice. Dresher and Reffkin provided
a seamless frame for the tenor's
monologue, and then, toward the end
of the piece, the instrumentation
stopped and Eckert's voice alone —
layered and returned to the audience
through the tape processer — created
the music. It was the ultimate in a
cappella. Eckert revealed himself as
an authentic one-man band.
"Slow Fire," the final piece of the
evening and the longest, is the first
part of an opera which premiered last
Nov. 8 at Los Angeles' Mark Taper
Forum. It is a continuation and a
fleshing-out of Bob's story; once
again, Eckert is the life force of the
performance. His character is a
demon possessed by technology and
weaponry (the title refers to a type of
rifle fire). Bob isn't anyone we
haven't seen before, but Eckert
proves that there can be an absolutely
fresh presentation of a hackneyed
character.
The set for "Slow Fire" was mini

mal — a series of doors that fall down
to reveal what seems to be a highway
and a screen hanging between plat
forms on which Dresher and Reffkin
are perched. Props appear out of
nowhere and pretend to be nothing
but props. A telephone emerges,
rising from the midst of Dresher's
keyboards. A suitcase appears and is
filled with floodlights.
Eckert sings about paranoia, nos
talgia and neurosis. At one point he
is driven into a frenzy because he
can't remember whether he's locked
his black Volvo (what will happen to
his sheepskin seat covers?). He con
tinually refers to his childhood expe
riences with cars and real estate (a
friend suggesting at one point that he
was trying to "buy his farm," a Mid
western euphemism for death).
Finally, though Eckert was a
crazed, desperate man. he was also
funny. His body movements, facial
expressions and the slightest inflec
tions of his voice evoked sustained
laughter — proof that the performer
had total control over his audience.
But though 1 felt controlled by Eck
ert, I didn't feel manipulated — I was
so caught up in his performance that I
was willing to let him take charge of
my reactions. As "Slow Fire" ended,
I felt burned out, but greatly moved.
I've come to the conclusion that
there are a lot of people desperately
seeking a satisfying avant-garde ex
perience — people who attend end
less computer-these and video-thats,
and wind up wondering if perhaps
avant-garde art is called avant-garde
because you aren't supposed to un
derstand it or enjoy it until years after
having experienced it.
Well, good news. There are still
things that haven't been done over
and over, yet are immediately moving
and enthralling despite their
"newness." Watching the Paul Dres
her Ensemble's Saturday night per
formance at Dinkelspiel, I found
myself thinking, "Now why hasn't
this been done before?" instead of
simply "What are they doing?"
The ensemble includes the young
composer Paul Dresher, drummer
Gene Reffkin and tenor Rinde Eck
ert. Dresher is known for his works in
chamber and orchestral composition,
experimental music and theater, live
electronics and ensemble perfor
mances. He draws on a variety of
music traditions — notably Eastern,
classical, contemporary rock and jazz
— and describes himself as a "pre
maximalist" (as opposed to a post
minimalist).
Eckert is the newest member of the
trio; he has been working with Dres
her since 1980. In addition to his
work with the Dresher Ensemble, he
has been involved with George
Coate's "How" trilogy, and has writ

ten and starred in several recent Bay
Area performances.
The performances began with
Dresher playing solo. He was then
joined by Reffkin, and finally, the trio
played as a unit.
Two pieces at the beginning of the
evening flexed the technical muscles
of Dresher's tape-processing ma
chine, an instrument which permits
live multi-track recording, mixing,
processing and immediate playback
of any sounds produced on stage.
This sort of machine was pioneered

by Robert Fripp of King Crimson and
Fripp/Eno fame; it creates a litany of
effects, from the saccharine to the
painful, and is probably one of the
most anal approaches imaginable to
the making of live music. It's the mis
sing link between live performance
and recorded music, entirely
computer-generated.
The first piece, "Dark Blue Cir
cumstances," was written by Dresher
for solo electric guitar and tape
