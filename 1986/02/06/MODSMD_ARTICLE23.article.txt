The rating scale: from one to five stars, with five being the best
Selected cuts from these albums will be played tomorrow on KZSU at 6 p.m.

The Femmes are composed of 37
radical, submachine gun-toting
feminists seeking to destroy any and
all books which refer to generic per
sons as "he" instead of "he or she."

Actually, that's not true. They're
really three guys from Minneapolis
who wear three-foot-long fish on
their arms for their back cover pix.
They are also great at writing quirky,
somehow engaging songs that borrow
on former blues, rock 'n' roll or punk
themes. If we had to compare them
with anybody, it'd be the Velvet Un
derground. These are songs that fol
low the path of the Talking Heads i{i
making lyrically very weird, but at the
same time very relevant, songs.
(Actually, the Heads' guitarist Jerry
Harrison produces and plays a little
on this album.) Listen: "What's
best/Lifelessness/My doll is
dead/Listen to the song/Sing along."
Or from"I Held Her in My Arms":
"I'm gnawing on the knowledge/That
I have been burnt." Their sound is
sparse and rock 'n' roll, never a musi
cal assault, but it's definitely guitar
based, and they can be very melodic.

Best of all, this is an original
band which continues to put out fun,
relevant songs that make a real con
tribution to music. Old fans won't be
disappointed.
Various Artists — "Pretty in Pink"
★ ★★★ (half)
First of all, there are 28, count 'em,
28 pictures containing some portion
of Molly Ringwald on the cover. That
might t>e worth eight bucks right
there, teen-idol fans. But the real
surprise comes after you stop staring
at Molly and open the thing up.
That's right, there's no light in
strumental background music on the
record! (Apparently Molly read our
"Breakfast Club" review. Way to go,
Mol.) But don't get too excited about
the potential of a soundtrack album
without filler, however revolutionary
the concept may seem. Songs from
0.M.D., INXS, Jesse Johnson, and

the Smiths are solid, but not classics.
The one exceptional track is New Or
der's "Shell-Shock," a song that
should have been included in "Low-
Life." Echo and the Bunnymen's
"Bring On the Dancing Horses" ap
pears for some reason, and all of the
rest (including a disappointing Psych

Furs self-covered title track) round
out the usual forgettable-but-benign
tracks section. The rest you can just
cut out of the vinyl with a razor blade.
For those of you who haven't learned
by now to never pay full price for
soundtracks, the combination of solid
songs, teen-hipness and Mollypix
should prove to be less embarrassing
than usual.
Mason Ruffner —"Mason Ruffner"
iririr
It wasn't our fault that we picked
up this record. A man in a yellow suit
outside Tower Records threatened to
throw a pot of boiling-hot Texas chili
on us if we didn't buy it. Well, that to
tally screwed our plans to review the
new Peter Frampton album, so here it
is: Mason Ruffner. He just so hap
pens to be a guitar player. Rock 'n'
roll mania, man. Yet another Texas
guitarist plowing on a Fender

Stratocaster. But is he different,
Mom? Yes. He's not as good a
guitarist (at least not as fast) as all the
others, and he sings worse. His voice
is that country-and-western Texas
drawl you've all heard before. Well
then, why did we give him three stars
instead of one? Because he plays a
real old guitar; we just happen to like
old beat-up guitars. It makes this guy
sound like Chuck Berry, which is veiy
pleasing. He can also write
remarkably good tunes that sound
very 1950s at times, and very Dylan
at others. This album treads a fine
line between blues and standard rock
n' roll, and only once does it sound
like cliche rock. It ain't Dylan or 8.8.
King or Stevie Ray Vaughan, but it's
very satisfying. Also, the guy with the
chili made us give it three stars. Jerk.
