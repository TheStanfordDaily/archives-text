# Windham Hill trio fails jazz test
## 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
The tribe of artists at Windham Hill is
renowned for consistently putting out music it
would prefer to call "unclassifiable." The concert
Friday night by Ira Stein and Russel Wilder in
Tresidder's Oak Lounge approached that defini
tion, not because it transcended barriers, but be
cause it defied being called music at all.
The press release announcing the arrival of the
duo (with newly added drummer Kurt Wortman)
seemed proud to trumpet the fact that the
group's "combination of synthesizer, piano and
oboe distinguishes their music from more tradi
tional jazz." That statement is a lot truer than it
sounds. Stein and Wilder seemed bent on flout
ing every stylistic convention that has been estab
lished in the history of the form.
But this didn't add up to much in the end. Stein
and Wilder's sound was, quite simply, an effort to
fuse jazz and post-punk that didn't come off.
There was only one quiet moment during the
whole performance the audience could truly
savor, and that was a brief piano solo by Stein in
the middle of a dense morass of sound. If
Windham Hill is associated with quiet mood

music, this group certainly disabused its audience
of that notion.
The problem rested both in the lack of unity in
the group's sound and in the misguided style the
group used to express itself.
The musicians seemed determined to top each
other from the very first flick of the synthesizer
switch. Stein, with amazingly theatrical flourishes
of his hands and bobs of his head, turned on his
synth at the beginning of each piece as if he were
concentrating on a complicated Chopin piece. All
he was doing was switching on a program he had
obviously prewritten for the occasion.
The synth pieces didn't match the traditional
instruments by any stretch of the imagination
either. They were calculated imitations of
whooshing, thunking, prison-cell pop-synth
rhythms such as those popularized by groups like
Depeche Mode and Tears for Fears. Overarching
a wall of sound created by a disoriented combina
tion of piano, oboe and drums, the synth sounds
just gave the audience a headache instead of
bringing it into the melody.
Adding to the post-punk sound was Wortman,
who beat his drums leadenly and mechanically.
He looked like a three-year-old banging a trash
can lid with a two-by-four. I suppose this harsh
sound would be considered "tight" in a band like

the Violent Femmes or the Fall, but the audience
came to listen to jazz, not new wave. The drums
were obnoxious and detracted from the sound
more than any other element of the group's
music.
One piece in particular, at the beginning of the
one-and-a-half-hour set, exemplified the failure
of this trio to elicit jazz from their instruments.
Stein started out with a synth riff that sounded
like the Police's "Synchronicity I" as if played by
a salesman in a shopping-mall organ store.
Wortman started trying to be the next Phil Col
lins, beating his drums more to the tune of "I
Don't Care Anymore" than to any original beat.
The oboe came in, squawking its notes out, for
getting all subtlety.
The audience was optimistic, and it tried its
best to become part of the sounds coming from
the instruments. Several people jerked their
heads and twiddled their thumbs in rhythm to the
music. The effect was more robotic than spontan
eous, however, and the same could be said for
the evening.
Stein and Wilder were sponsored by Student
Arts at Stanford (STARTS), which will be
showcasing another evening jazz performance in
Oak Lounge Feb. 21. The sextet, A Little Night
Music, will be on stage at 8 p.m.
