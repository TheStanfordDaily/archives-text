## Arizona St. next foe for red-hot Cardinal 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
It was almost two years ago that the Stanford
men's basketball team last had a game that
could be described as crucial. In that 1983-84
season, the Cardinal took 1 record up to
Oregon with a possible berth in the National In
vitational Tournament waiting if the Cardinal
could defeat the Ducks and wrap up a 20-win
season.
It was not to be. Oregon ran away with a 91-
71 decision. Stanford finished 19-12, and the
Cardinal watched the NIT on television.
Sportswriters tend to overuse the word
"crucial." So, Tom Davis, how important is
tonight's 7:30 game against Arizona State in
Maples Pavilion?
"Arizona State is a crucial game for us," the
Stanford coach said.
After a stretch in which it lost four of five
games and was looking up at the leaders in the
Pacific 10 Conference with a 2-4 record, the
Cardinal has rebounded to win its last three
games.
Included in the streak was Sunday's 56-52
win at Oregon State that put Stanford into a
third-place tie with the Beavers and California.
In past years, a Stanford team beating UCLA
and Oregon State would have been shocking.
No more. Welcome to the Pac-10, the land of
parity, the league that Pete R'ozelle would love.
"I think you saw evidence of how balanced
this league is," Davis said. "There's not that
much difference from top to bottom. It means a
heck of a race."

And Stanford is right in the middle of that
race. Don't ask how, don't ask why. The
nightmare of last year's 3-15 conference
schedule is over, and the Cardinal is talking
once again — dare we say it — about playing
basketball after the regular season is over.
The depressed state of the Pac-10 this season
won't help Stanford, though. Arizona is the only
Pac-10 team to receive a vote in the Associated
Press Top 20 poll — only one vote.
"I have no idea," Davis said when asked how
many Pac-10 teams will go to the NCAA tourn
ament. "We had four in last year, and I think at
least two will go, so it's probably somewhere in
between there. It'll depend on how teams do
down the stretch. If some team gets hot and gets
some national recognition, it'll help the league."
It's also harder for a school not recognized as
a basketball power to get into the tournament.
Selection committees look at UCLAs and
Oregon States; they don't look at Stanfords.
"We've got to finish third or better to go,"
Davis said. "I think we have a shot at that. We
know we're young and inexperienced, so we
need a good effort every time out. We can beat
anyone in the league if we play well; if we don't,
we can lose to anyone. We have nothing to
dominate other teams with."
Guard John Paye thinks the Cardinal may
have to do better than that to make the NCAA
postseason party. "They'll probably only take
two teams for the NCAA because the Pac-10
hasn't been getting many accolades this year,
and they'll probably take two teams for the

NIT, so we've got to finish in the top
four to go to a tournament," he said.
And this weekend is shaping up as
the first test for the Cardinal in the
role of contender. The Sun Devils
have been beset with problems, but
have been playing improved basket
ball as of late, while Arizona is com
ing off a 70-57 victory over league
leading Washington in Seattle and is
only a half-game out of first.
"1 don't think we can rest on our
laurels," Paye said. "If we win two
this weekend, we're in second place.
If we lose two, we may be out of it."
Stanford, 5-4 in Pac-10 play, 11-10
overall, faces an Arizona State team
that has been up and down this
season — up at home and down on
the road. Two weeks ago, the Sun
Devils swept Oregon and Oregon
State at home. Last week, they lost to
Washington and Washington State on
the road.
Arizona State is 9-1 at home — the
only blemish being a 66-59 loss to
Stanford last month — and 0-9 on the
road, 9-10 overall and 3-6 in the Pac
-10, good for ninth place.
The Sun Devils have lost sopho
more forward Chris Sandle, who
flunked out of school and transferred
to Texas-El Paso last month. His last
game at ASU was against Stanford,
and he scored 21 points in that losing
effort.
Center Eric Holloway, who has
missed the last four games with a
pulled groin muscle, is expected back
tonight. Holloway had been averag
ing over 11 points per game before he
was hurt. Tarre Isiah has replaced

Holloway and is expected to start
tonight.
The Arizona State program
received a bit of stability when Steve
Patterson was formally hired on Jan.
24 as head coach for this season and
next. Patterson had previously
been the interim coach after Bob
Weinhauer departed over the sum
mer.
"We've been attempting to operate
on the long term, yet not knowing
about the long term has been diffi
cult," Patterson said. "When the an
nouncement was made, a cloud was
lifted. We're not looking toward the
end of January or the end of the
season — we're looking ahead."
Patterson inherits some of the
legacy of the Weinhauer era, though,
having to operate with a ban on
recruiting for all of 1986. Still, he
does have one of the best guard tan
dems in the league to work with.
"They have maybe the quickest
backcourt in the league with Steve
Beck and Arthur Thomas," Davis
said.
Beck has always been a thorn in the
Cardinal's side. Though only averag
ing 12 points a game this year, he
popped in 22 against Stanford in
Tempe.
"Steve Beck has really given us a
lift lately," Patterson said. "With the
loss of our leading scorer (Sandle),
everyone's got to pick up the slack,
and Steve Beck has produced and
picked up the slack. He's played well
against Stanford, and we hope that
continues."
There are still plenty of student
tickets available for tonight's game,
which will be broadcast on KCBS
(740 AM) and KZSU (90.1 FM).

Arizona State is 9-1 at home — the
only blemish being a 66-59 loss to
Stanford last month — and 0-9 on the
road, 9-10 overall and 3-6 in the Pac
-10, good for ninth place.
The Sun Devils have lost sopho
more forward Chris Sandle, who
flunked out of school and transferred
to Texas-El Paso last month. His last
game at ASU was against Stanford,
and he scored 21 points in that losing
effort.
Center Eric Holloway, who has
missed the last four games with a
pulled groin muscle, is expected back
tonight. Holloway had been averag
ing over 11 points per game before he
was hurt. Tarre Isiah has replaced

Holloway and is expected to start
tonight.
The Arizona State program
received a bit of stability when Steve
Patterson was formally hired on Jan.
24 as head coach for this season and
next. Patterson had previously
been the interim coach after Bob
Weinhauer departed over the sum
mer.
"We've been attempting to operate
on the long term, yet not knowing
about the long term has been diffi
cult," Patterson said. "When the an
nouncement was made, a cloud was
lifted. We're not looking toward the
end of January or the end of the
season — we're looking ahead."
Patterson inherits some of the
legacy of the Weinhauer era, though,
having to operate with a ban on
recruiting for all of 1986. Still, he
does have one of the best guard tan
dems in the league to work with.
"They have maybe the quickest
backcourt in the league with Steve
Beck and Arthur Thomas," Davis
said.
Beck has always been a thorn in the
Cardinal's side. Though only averag
ing 12 points a game this year, he
popped in 22 against Stanford in
Tempe.
"Steve Beck has really given us a
lift lately," Patterson said. "With the
loss of our leading scorer (Sandle),
everyone's got to pick up the slack,
and Steve Beck has produced and
picked up the slack. He's played well
against Stanford, and we hope that
continues."
There are still plenty of student
tickets available for tonight's game,
which will be broadcast on KCBS
(740 AM) and KZSU (90.1 FM).
It was almost two years ago that the Stanford
men's basketball team last had a game that
could be described as crucial. In that 1983-84
season, the Cardinal took 1 record up to
Oregon with a possible berth in the National In
vitational Tournament waiting if the Cardinal
could defeat the Ducks and wrap up a 20-win
season.
It was not to be. Oregon ran away with a 91-
71 decision. Stanford finished 19-12, and the
Cardinal watched the NIT on television.
Sportswriters tend to overuse the word
"crucial." So, Tom Davis, how important is
tonight's 7:30 game against Arizona State in
Maples Pavilion?
"Arizona State is a crucial game for us," the
Stanford coach said.
After a stretch in which it lost four of five
games and was looking up at the leaders in the
Pacific 10 Conference with a 2-4 record, the
Cardinal has rebounded to win its last three
games.
Included in the streak was Sunday's 56-52
win at Oregon State that put Stanford into a
third-place tie with the Beavers and California.
In past years, a Stanford team beating UCLA
and Oregon State would have been shocking.
No more. Welcome to the Pac-10, the land of
parity, the league that Pete R'ozelle would love.
"I think you saw evidence of how balanced
this league is," Davis said. "There's not that
much difference from top to bottom. It means a
heck of a race."

And Stanford is right in the middle of that
race. Don't ask how, don't ask why. The
nightmare of last year's 3-15 conference
schedule is over, and the Cardinal is talking
once again — dare we say it — about playing
basketball after the regular season is over.
The depressed state of the Pac-10 this season
won't help Stanford, though. Arizona is the only
Pac-10 team to receive a vote in the Associated
Press Top 20 poll — only one vote.
"I have no idea," Davis said when asked how
many Pac-10 teams will go to the NCAA tourn
ament. "We had four in last year, and I think at
least two will go, so it's probably somewhere in
between there. It'll depend on how teams do
down the stretch. If some team gets hot and gets
some national recognition, it'll help the league."
It's also harder for a school not recognized as
a basketball power to get into the tournament.
Selection committees look at UCLAs and
Oregon States; they don't look at Stanfords.
"We've got to finish third or better to go,"
Davis said. "I think we have a shot at that. We
know we're young and inexperienced, so we
need a good effort every time out. We can beat
anyone in the league if we play well; if we don't,
we can lose to anyone. We have nothing to
dominate other teams with."
Guard John Paye thinks the Cardinal may
have to do better than that to make the NCAA
postseason party. "They'll probably only take
two teams for the NCAA because the Pac-10
hasn't been getting many accolades this year,
and they'll probably take two teams for the

NIT, so we've got to finish in the top
four to go to a tournament," he said.
And this weekend is shaping up as
the first test for the Cardinal in the
role of contender. The Sun Devils
have been beset with problems, but
have been playing improved basket
ball as of late, while Arizona is com
ing off a 70-57 victory over league
leading Washington in Seattle and is
only a half-game out of first.
"1 don't think we can rest on our
laurels," Paye said. "If we win two
this weekend, we're in second place.
If we lose two, we may be out of it."
Stanford, 5-4 in Pac-10 play, 11-10
overall, faces an Arizona State team
that has been up and down this
season — up at home and down on
the road. Two weeks ago, the Sun
Devils swept Oregon and Oregon
State at home. Last week, they lost to
Washington and Washington State on
the road.
Arizona State is 9-1 at home — the
only blemish being a 66-59 loss to
Stanford last month — and 0-9 on the
