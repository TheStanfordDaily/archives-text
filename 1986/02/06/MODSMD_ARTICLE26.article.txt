## Arizona St. next foe for red-hot Cardinal 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
It was almost two years ago that the Stanford
men's basketball team last had a game that
could be described as crucial. In that 1983-84
season, the Cardinal took 1 record up to
Oregon with a possible berth in the National In
vitational Tournament waiting if the Cardinal
could defeat the Ducks and wrap up a 20-win
season.
It was not to be. Oregon ran away with a 91-
71 decision. Stanford finished 19-12, and the
Cardinal watched the NIT on television.
Sportswriters tend to overuse the word
"crucial." So, Tom Davis, how important is
tonight's 7:30 game against Arizona State in
Maples Pavilion?
"Arizona State is a crucial game for us," the
Stanford coach said.
After a stretch in which it lost four of five
games and was looking up at the leaders in the
Pacific 10 Conference with a 2-4 record, the
Cardinal has rebounded to win its last three
games.
Included in the streak was Sunday's 56-52
win at Oregon State that put Stanford into a
third-place tie with the Beavers and California.
In past years, a Stanford team beating UCLA
and Oregon State would have been shocking.
No more. Welcome to the Pac-10, the land of
parity, the league that Pete R'ozelle would love.
"I think you saw evidence of how balanced
this league is," Davis said. "There's not that
much difference from top to bottom. It means a
heck of a race."

And Stanford is right in the middle of that
race. Don't ask how, don't ask why. The
nightmare of last year's 3-15 conference
schedule is over, and the Cardinal is talking
once again — dare we say it — about playing
basketball after the regular season is over.
The depressed state of the Pac-10 this season
won't help Stanford, though. Arizona is the only
Pac-10 team to receive a vote in the Associated
Press Top 20 poll — only one vote.
"I have no idea," Davis said when asked how
many Pac-10 teams will go to the NCAA tourn
ament. "We had four in last year, and I think at
least two will go, so it's probably somewhere in
between there. It'll depend on how teams do
down the stretch. If some team gets hot and gets
some national recognition, it'll help the league."
It's also harder for a school not recognized as
a basketball power to get into the tournament.
Selection committees look at UCLAs and
Oregon States; they don't look at Stanfords.
"We've got to finish third or better to go,"
Davis said. "I think we have a shot at that. We
know we're young and inexperienced, so we
need a good effort every time out. We can beat
anyone in the league if we play well; if we don't,
we can lose to anyone. We have nothing to
dominate other teams with."
Guard John Paye thinks the Cardinal may
have to do better than that to make the NCAA
postseason party. "They'll probably only take
two teams for the NCAA because the Pac-10
hasn't been getting many accolades this year,
and they'll probably take two teams for the
