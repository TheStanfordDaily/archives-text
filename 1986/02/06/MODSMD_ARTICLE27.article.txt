# Card takes fifth straight
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
It was the same old song out at Sunken
Diamond yesterday afternoon.
San Jose State University, a team that
has become something of a Stanford whip
ping boy, was in town to play a baseball
game. And for the fourth time in the last
two weeks, the Spartans were sent on their
merry way to San Jose after a lopsided
loss.
This time the Cardinal beat SJSU by a
8-4 count. Stanford now stands at 5-0, and
the Spartans, who have yet to play a team
other than the Cardinal, are 0-4.
Thankfully, it seems that this song is fi
nally over: yesterday was the grand
finale. The teams are not scheduled to
meet again this year.
Stanford began the scoring in the bot
tom of the second. With catcher John

Ramos on second after being hit by Spar
tan starter and loser Larry McEvoy, and
Lance Shebelut on first after singling,
right fielder Toi Cook grounded a run
scoring single into left.
Shebelut, who advanced to third on
Cook's base hit, scored when the next bat
ter, Mike De√üenon, grounded out to
second. Mark Machtolf drove in Cook
with a sacrifice tly to left.
Through three innings, starter Kevin
Kunkel throttled SJSU hitters, giving up
only a pair of hits and a walk. "I think I
did really well," he said. "I was using
mostly my slider and my sinker was pretty
good. Those two pitches were enough."
But Kunkel ran into some trouble in the
top of the fourth.
He walked Earl Bowles, then gave up a
double to designated hitter Jeff Nollette.
That put runners on second and third with
no outs.

Bowles scored on Terry Conway's
ground out, Nollette moving to third. Nol
lette came across when Ramos threw the
ball errantly down the third base line.
"I'm happy with my performance,"
Kunkel said, "although in that last inning I
was a little tentative."
As it turned out, the fourth was
Kunkel's last inning. Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess had decided before the game
that Rob Wassenaar and Kunkel would
share duties against the Spartans.
In relief of Kunkel, Wassenaar logged
four innings of work and surrendered one
run on two hits to notch his first win of the
year. Along the way he struck out three
and did not walk a batter.
"Today was a little bit better than last
time," Wassenaar joked afterward, refer-
