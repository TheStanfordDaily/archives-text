### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
Last night in Santa Barbara the Stanford men's volley
ball team won its fourth match in a row, upsetting No. 4
UC-Santa Barbara, 15-10, 15-10. 17-15. The Cardinal,
tied for fifth in the nation with Hawaii, improved its
record to 3-0 in California Intercollegiate Volleyball As
sociation play, while UCSB dropped to 6-2 overall and 0-
1 in the league.
The match was more difficult than any of Stanford's
previous outings this season. The Cardinal, going into last
night's contest, was averaging 15.1 points per game to 5.5
for the opposition.
Last week, the squad needed less than three quarters of
an hour to down last-place St. Mary's, but last night it
took the Cardinal over two hours to defeat the Gauchos.
It was the first time in recent history that Stanford has
emerged victorious against UCSB at Santa Barbara.
Senior outside hitter Chris Braun again led the Cardinal
in kills with 27, more than doubling his season total in
conference play. He currently has 52 kills in CIV A action.
All-American Jon Root followed with 17 kills, while
sophomore Scott Fortune had 15.
UCSB was led by two-time All-American setter Jared
Hoffman, who recorded 25 kills.
Stanford finished with a team hitting percentage of
.306, while the Gauchos hit for just a .205 percentage.
UCSB also made 14 service errors on the night, displaying
the inexperience of a team that lost three starters from last
year.
With last night's win, the Cardinal opened up the first
match of a four-game Southern California road trip. Stan
ford Co-Coach Don Shaw said the Cardinal would have to
win half of its games on this trip in order to make the
playoffs.
The squad goes on to face ninth-ranked Long Beach
State tomorrow night and No. 11 San Diego State on Sat
urday. Stanford winds up the six-day journey against
defending national champion Pepperdine Monday night.
