# A 						night spent watching intramurals in Maples Pavilion
## Every basketball team could use a J-Coach 
### 
The scene is Maples Pavilion. The sport is
presumably basketball.
The heavy, metal back door of Maples —
the intramural gateway to hoop heaven — is
flung open by what appears to be a large
solitary figure.
He slow ly saunters into the light with a par
ticular swagger that suggests that this man en
joys the inside game of basketball.
He looks to be a shade under six feet tall.
He's bespectacled and sports a barbed-wire
type beard. It's not a particularily pretty
growth, but it does have a certain regal
quality, as those facial follicles menacingly jet
out like sabers ready for attack.
He possesses a fairly stocky build, much
akin to a troll on steroids. A determined look
of ferocity stretches across his face, disturbed
only by an occasional twitching grimace. He
seems ready to play.
Unquestionably, though, there lingers a

little doubt about how much this man has to
offer the game of basketball. Does he have a
sky hook? Does he have a jumper? Can he
dribble— that is. the basketball?
Admittedly. I had some grave reservations,
but I waited before drawing any concrete con
elusions. After all, it's difficult to judge a troll
by his beard.
His teammates call him J-Coach. Pele. Tat
too, Sade and J-Coach. Fine company. Few
people have earned the honor of a one-letter
nickname. No one calls President Reagan
"The Big R." Perhaps this J-Coach player
was a ringer. I was confused.
The pregame layup drill did little to shed
any light on what this J-Coach could actually
accomplish on the court. A brick here, a brick
there. It looked hopeless.
But then, suddenly, just before the start of
the game. J-Coach offered a baby jump hook.
The cords ripped. Bedlam? Will J-Coach start

speaking in tongues? Not one sign of hysteria.
He just picked up the ball with a causal air
of indifference and trotted to the bench. Nary
a sheepish grin creased his face.
The game commenced in the usual way.
Some turnovers, traveling calls and a few bas-

kets. Still, there was no J-Coach. He sat on
the sidelines, cheering on his teammates with
throaty, hormonal voice projections.
Finally, it came to pass. J-Coach ran onto
the court. His teammates shouted approval

while J-Coach adjusted his game face.
In approximately five game minutes of ac
tion. J-Coach made his mark. His dominant
trademark was the personal foul — three to
be exact. He did snare a rebound, and fol
lowed it with a strong outlet pass.
After the game, his stats were not splendid.
Zero points, one rebound and three fouls. But
there was a certain driven beauty to his game.
He made things happen. No opposing player
went unturned. A scrapper to the end.
His teammates seemed to appreciate his ef
forts. "J-Coach works so hard on the court
that you just don't want to let him down.'"
junior Erik Giske said.
"I've never seen him down. He plays with
an upbeat, positive attitude." junior Sam
McAdam said. "As far as ability, he tries real
hard not to make the mistakes — constantly
tries to learn the game."
And how would J-Coach assess his overall

game? "I play aggressively all the time."
And his physical attributes? J-Coach smiled
a little and glanced down at his shoes, shaking
his head."Can I get back to you on that?" he
said with a laugh. Every team should have a J-
Coach.
Tragically, however, not every team does.
These teams are undefeated.
At the midpoint of the B-league season. 14
teams boasted unblemished records.
According to IM staffer Charley Montoya,
the Theta Delts are the odds-on favorite to
capture the B-league championship. The
Dekes are also considered a strong contender,
while Toyon II and the Branner Reruns were
viewed as darkhorses.
Other teams to watch include: Dosa
Gomads, Dolphins, Skip's Choice, Club
Ujamaa, Park Avenue and Small Faces.
On a darker note, the Shooting Pearls are
0-3.

throaty, hormonal voice projections.
Finally, it came to pass. J-Coach ran onto
the court. His teammates shouted approval

while J-Coach adjusted his game face.
In approximately five game minutes of ac
tion. J-Coach made his mark. His dominant
trademark was the personal foul — three to
be exact. He did snare a rebound, and fol
lowed it with a strong outlet pass.
After the game, his stats were not splendid.
Zero points, one rebound and three fouls. But
there was a certain driven beauty to his game.
He made things happen. No opposing player
went unturned. A scrapper to the end.
His teammates seemed to appreciate his ef
forts. "J-Coach works so hard on the court
that you just don't want to let him down.'"
junior Erik Giske said.
"I've never seen him down. He plays with
an upbeat, positive attitude." junior Sam
McAdam said. "As far as ability, he tries real
hard not to make the mistakes — constantly
tries to learn the game."
And how would J-Coach assess his overall

game? "I play aggressively all the time."
And his physical attributes? J-Coach smiled
a little and glanced down at his shoes, shaking
his head."Can I get back to you on that?" he
said with a laugh. Every team should have a J-
Coach.
Tragically, however, not every team does.
These teams are undefeated.
At the midpoint of the B-league season. 14
teams boasted unblemished records.
According to IM staffer Charley Montoya,
the Theta Delts are the odds-on favorite to
capture the B-league championship. The
Dekes are also considered a strong contender,
while Toyon II and the Branner Reruns were
viewed as darkhorses.
Other teams to watch include: Dosa
Gomads, Dolphins, Skip's Choice, Club
Ujamaa, Park Avenue and Small Faces.
On a darker note, the Shooting Pearls are
0-3.
