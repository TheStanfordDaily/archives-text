# COP calls for policy review
## 
### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP) yesterday proposed that the
Honor Code Commission be made
responsible for reviewing the Policy
on Campus Disruption (PCD) and
other policies on student mis
behavior.
In a letter to University President
Donald Kennedy, the COP stated,
"The PCD should be addressed by an
educational body which is charged
with considering problems and raising
awareness of student governance
policy through a joint student
faculty-administration effort."
Believing that "the Honor Code
Commission (HCC) can fulfill that
educational function," the COP pro
posed the HCC be charged by the
COP and the Office of the President
"to permit and support discussion
and educational activities regarding
the PCD and its relationship to the
Honor Code and the entire body of
regulations governing student behav
ior."
Commenting on the relationship
between the PCD, the Honor Code
and the Fundamental Standard, Judi
cial Affairs Officer Sally Cole said.

"There is a relationship in that they
all concern student behavior. .. . The
PCD has a separate history, but the
process of trying it is exactly the same
as the Honor Code because they both
deal with student behavior."
The PCD was created in 1967 by
the University administration "to
protect itself against strident protest
of the status quo. One application of
the policy authorizes expulsion or
probation for non.-violent, non
destructive activism such as'sit-ins' at
University facilities," according to
HCC Chairman Jon Adelstein.
"The civil liberty of Stanford stu
dents is threatened by the Policy on
Campus Disruption," Adelstein said.
"The PCD is intended to curb stu
dents' expression of differences with
the University."
While Adelstein said he
"recognizes the legitimacy of police
action that is taken against activities
like sit-ins," he objects to the PCD
being used by the University to in
timidate and discourage students
from expressing themselves.
The PCD "imposes sanctions for a
particular form of expression" and
"punishes in order to deter protest.
The intent cannot be to restore order
to the scene of a disruption since

police arrests, not campus policy, ful
fill that function,," Adelstein said.
The COP has requested that Ken
nedy respond to the letter before Feb.
12, the date of the next HCC
meeting.
