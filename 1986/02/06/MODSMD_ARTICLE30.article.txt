Four Stanford women's tennis players will leave the
Farm this weekend for individual tournaments, returning
next week as the Cardinal's dual-match season gets under
way.
Junior Leigh Anne Eldredge is involved in opening
round action today in the Rolex National Indoor Cham
pionships in Houston, Texas. Junior Patty Fendick and
freshman Marianne Werdel leave tomorrow for Boca
Raton, Fla., to play in the Lipton Professional Tourna
ment. And freshman Eleni Rossides is currently in Boca
Raton attempting to qualify for the Lipton.
Eldredge, who teamed with Linda Gates last year to
win the doubles championship at the Rolex tournament,
will be in the singles draw this year, by virtue of winning
the Rolex regional competition.
"She (Eldredge) will not be one of the top seeds, but
she'll certainly be in the top eight," Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said. "She could do something."
Fendick, Stanford's No. 1 singles player and the fourth
ranked player nationally, injured her foot during the
doubles semifinals of the Riviera Tournament last
weekend, forcing her to default the match. Fortunately,
the injury appears to have healed quickly.
" Her foot was very tender when she was on the court,"
Brennan said. "But she made a miraculous recovery. The
next day sh" /as walking around fine."
Brennan said he expects Fendick to be one of the top
collegiate women in the nation this season, though she did
lose in the singles semifinals at the Riviera to USC's
Caroline Kuhlman by scores of 6-1 and 7-5.
Down match point at 5-1 in the second set, Fendick
fought back tenaciously to even the match at 5-5 before
falling to Kuhlman, who went on to capture the tourna
ment title. "It was a real good comeback," Brennan said.
"Patty felt good that she was able to keep her head on
straight."
Werdel, the nation's top recruit last year, was a bit of a
disappointment at the Riviera, according to Brennan.
"Marianne was the only one who didn't have a real good

tournament for us," he said. "But she had a lot of pressure
on her. She's from that area."
Werdel began the tournament in fine fashion, winning
her first two matches with relative ease. But in the third
round, after winning the first set 6-2 and taking a quick
lead in the next set, she lost the form that has earned her
18 national titles, and dropped the second and third sets
by scores of 6-2 and 6-3.
For Brennan, the most pleasantly surprising aspect of
the Riviera Tournament was Kay Tittle. The Cardinal's
No. 6 singles player registered the biggest upset of the
tournament, knocking off eighth-seeded Ann Hubert of
Trinity.
Tittle, who last season was beset by knee problems,
continued to play strongly throughout the weekend.
Down 2-6, 0-4 to USC's Maeze Quinlan in the third
round. Tittle fought back to advance to the quarterfinals
by taking the second and third sets, 7-5 and 6-1.
Tittle was eventually eliminated 6-2, 6-1 in the quarter
finals by Fendick. By this time, however, she had shown
that, despite playing at No. 6 for the Cardinal, she must be
reckoned with. "Kay probably had the best tournament
for us," Brennan said.
Though the Cardinal did not bring home any individual
titles, Brennan was more than satisfied with the team's
play at the Riviera. "We would have liked to be around
for the finals, but it was a real nice showing for Stanford.
"1 thought we came out looking pretty good," he
added. "We put the fear of God into some teams. When
you have your No. 6 player pull off a couple of upsets, you
show your depth."
Brennan was equally pleased by the play of the Card
inal doubles teams, which he sees as the key to Stanford's
success this season. The No. 1 doubles team of Fendick
and Eldredge lost the first set of their semifinal match to
Hubert and Gretchen Rush of Trinity, 7-6, before they
had to default because of Fendick's injury.
Stanford's No. 2 doubles squad, junior Stephanie
Savides and sophomore Cari Hagey, also advanced to the
semifinals, losing a thrilling match to Kuhlman and Dena
Levy of USC in a last-set tie-breaker.
The scores of the match were 3-6, 6-
2, 7-6(7-5).
Brennan indicated that the Card
inal is looking forward to opening its
home season next week with matches
against Santa Clara and San Jose
State. "We're anxious to get going
now," he said.
Card notes
On the men's side of the court, No.
2 ranked Dan Goldie will represent
Stanford in the All-American Indoor
Championships in Houston today
through Sunday. Goldie won the
tournament last year by defeating the
eventual 1985 NCAA singles cham
pion Mikael Pernfors 6-3, 6-2.
If Goldie continues winning
throughout the tournament, he'll play
one match today, two tomorrow, one
Saturday and one Sunday.
The Cardinal men's team opens up
its home season Tuesday afternoon
by hosting Georgia Tech at 1:30.
