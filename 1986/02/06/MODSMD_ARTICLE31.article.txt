UNION DALE, N.Y. (AP) â€”
Stanford freshman Debi Thomas
began her chase after Tiffany Chin s
national title yesterday by edging the
defending champion in the compul
sory figures at the National Figure
Skating Championships.
Thomas, 18, placed first in two of
the three required figures to collect
107.10 points and 12 ordinals. Chin
was second with 104.60 points and 20
ordinals after she botched the final
figure, a forward change loop.
"I held it together and now I know
I can be relaxed on the ice," Thomas
said. "This was the worst group of fig
ures for me.
"I'm proud of myself for not letting
my nerves take over. This gives me
lots of confidence."
Thomas, second to Chin in the
1985 Nationals, has since won at the
National Sports Festival, Skate
America and St. Ivel, England, the
last two major international events.
Chin, 18, of Toluca Lake, Calif.,
was making her first appearance in
competition since last March, when
she placed third in the World Cham
pionships. Since then, she was
sidelined by a muscle imbalance and
also changed coaches from John
Nicks to Don Laws.
The compulsory figures account for
30 percent of the total score.
