# Card softballers to open season
## 
### ANDREA JONES 
The 1986 Stanford women's
softball season opens today with a 1
p.m. doubleheader against San Jose
State at Baylands Field in Palo Alto.
Under the direction of Stanford
Coach Kathy Lincoln, the Cardinal
enters its second season as a varsity
sport. This season, Lincoln looks
forward to expanding and improv
ing the program.
" Our goal is to be a national con
tender," Lincoln said. "Right now
we are in the building stage, and our
immediate goal is to recruit well and
to improve upon last year's record."
Last year the Cardinal's record
was 13-53 in the very competitive
Western Collegiate Athletic Associ
ation. This season the team will
compete in the tough Pac-West
Conference, which includes UCLA,
USC, Arizona and Arizona State.
Next year, softball and all of Stan
ford's women's sports will be com
peting in what will be a newly
created Pacific 10 Conference for
women. The female version of the
Pac-10 will include all of the current
conference schools.
"We will win a lot more this
season," Lincoln said confidently.
"The team is better prepared over
all and knows its opponents better."
This season, instead of an ex
hausting 66-game schedule, the
team will play 19 or 20
doubleheaders during the regular
season, which begins today and runs
through May 6. Another change for
the Cardinal will be the location of
the home games. Instead of Roble
Field, all home games will be played
at Baylands.
A major difference between the

program last year and this year is in
the size of the coaching staff, which
has increased to include Asst.
Coach Tami Brown, Pitching Coach
Dawn Becker and Conditioning
Coach Maureen Sullivan.
Lincoln is very pleased with her
staff. "I feel this is the best staff in
Northern California," she said.
Among the returning players this
season are twin sisters Lisa and
Laura Buchanan. Lisa will be the
team's top pitcher and Laura will
start again at shortstop. Sharing the
mound with Lisa will be junior
Betsy Watson. Watson's confidence
and control of her pitches are her
two strongest assets.
Christy Fiscalini, a junior, will be
at third base. Lincoln said of her
star players, "Arguably, they may
be the best at their positions in the
entire league."
Senior Kathy Dominguez is an
outstanding defensive first baseman
and will start at that spot again this
season. Karen "K.K." Bush, also a
senior, will return for the Cardinal
in the outfield. Bush was named
Stanford's most improved player of
the 1984 season.
Sophomores Maria De La Rosa
and Colleen Nyilis will fill in the
outfield along with junior Margaret
Pezzini and freshman Maria
Dell' Oca. Sharing the job of catcher
will be freshman Vija Brookshire
and senior Tish Peterson. Peterson
will also work in the infield for the
Cardinal.
"I think we're on the right track
now," Lincoln said. "We're confi
dent that we can put together a pro
gram that will do Stanford proud."
