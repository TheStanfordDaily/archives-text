Baby Doc invokes emergency decree
FORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Facing an economic crisis caused by
the political tension that has shaken Haiti, embattled President-for-life
Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier yesterday invoked an emergency
decree to threaten fines or prison for businessmen who refuse to reopen
their shops and factories.
Shopkeepers had begun closing Tuesday, reportedly after receiving
telephoned threats against their property. Yesterday, many seemed to
comply with the new order and opened their businesses, but the govern
ment here faced a potentially more severe economic threat as crucial
light industries responded to the pressures of political unrest.
More than 200 plants operate here, taking advantage of Haiti's low
wages to assemble items for re-export, mostly to the United States. The
plants, which with tourism are the main sources of foreign exchange,
began closing Tuesday after some reportedly received threats.
Some assembly firms have lost contracts because of the unrest and
some foreign managers have left the country, according to foreign
analysts. There were reports yesterday that the little remaining invest
ment capital in Haiti was draining away.
Armed security personnel walked the streets of the business district
yesterday morning, informing store owners about the decree and the
possible penalties unless they opened.
Israeli interception outrages Arabs
AMMAN, Jordan — A wave of outrage swept through the Arab
world yesterday, uniting moderate states with radicals in denunciation of
the Israeli interception of a Libyan executive jet.
There was also significant condemnation of the incident from
America's European allies.
British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe said the interception of the
Libyan jet by Israeli fighters Tuesday "was without justification." Howe
said the action "sets a dangerous precedent which appears to have been
in contravention of international law."
The Belgian government also criticized the Israeli action, but said it
also condemns "all actions that have helped create a climate which
allows such events." sh Rare Arab Accord
The Arab world, which is normally divided into bickering factions by
most issues, showed rare unanimity in condemning the interception as an
act of air piracy.
The Libyan Grumman Gulfstream II jet, with Syrian and Lebanese
passengers returning to Syria from a conference in Tripoli. Libya, was
intercepted near Cyprus Tuesday, under the mistaken belief that Pales
tinian guerrilla leaders were on board. It was forced to land at an Israeli
air base, where it was held for five hours before being released to con
tinue on to Damascus.
Shultz praises Gorbachev plan
WASHINGTON —Secretary of State George Shultz, in the Reagan
Administration's most favorable assessment of a Soviet proposal in
years, yesterday called Mikhail Gorbachev's latest arms control plan "an
advance ... a good sign . . . good-sounding words."
Answering questions from the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
Shultz said that President Reagan and his advisers have not yet decided
on a formal response to the Soviet leader s Jan. 15 proposal for the
eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons.
But, after years of abstract discussion on how to end the threat of nu
clear arms, Shultz said that it is time for the U.S. government to begin a
systematic study of the security implications of a post-nuclear world in
which riflemen, tanks, high-explosive bombs and other conventional
arms would become the ultimate weapons.
"Before we get to anywhere near that end point... I think we have to
look very carefully at what the conditions will have to be to make a non
nuclear world a safe and stable world," he said.
Shultz answered questions from the committee for three hours in a
hearing that ranged across all aspects of foreign policy. The session was
intended to give Shultz an opportunity to justify the State Department's
$22.6 billion budget, reflecting an increase of more than $2 billion over
the current fiscal year— one of the few boosts reflected in Reagan's new
spending program.
Half million attend Pope's mass
MADRAS, India — Preaching religious freedom for all creeds and
the right to proselytize them. Pope John Paul II flew here yesterday to
pray on a small hilltop where, according to tradition. St. Thomas the
Apostle was martyred after introducing Christianity to India.
Heading into southern India, the heart of Indian Christianity, on the
fifth day of his 10-day tour of the country, John Paul was greeted in this
city of cotton mills and film studios on the Bay of Bengal by the largest
and most enthusiastic crowds of his visit.
Thousands lined the highway from the airport to Mount St. Thomas.
Tens of thousands gathered on the rocky hillside to receive a blessing
from the pope and about a half million people attended an outdoor mass
at a beach on the edge of the city.
The theme of the pope's visit to this capital of Tamil Nadu province
was tied to Thomas and his legendary arrival in southern India in 52
A.D. to bring the new Christianity to south Asia.
In acknowledgment of the tensions between Hindus and Christians,
which date from Thomas' time and continue today, the pope reaffirmed
the importance of religious tolerance and freedom.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Afghan rebels have executed eight Af
ghan soldiers they captured in eastern Afghanistan last week, the Rebel
Afghan Islamic Press Agency reported yesterday.

Third straight bombing in Paris
PARIS — A bomb exploded at a prominent Paris landmark for the
third evening in succession yesterday, raising fears that France may have
become the target of Middle East terrorists seeking to secure the release
of Arab prisoners from French jails.
The bomb, which went off in a large sports store in the shopping mall
known as Les Halles, injured at least nine persons. A total of 22 people
have now been injured since the present wave of bombings began Mon
day evening with an attack on a shopping gallery off the Champs-
Elysees.
According to the Paris newspaper Le Monde. French intelligence ex
perts believe that the new wave of bombings could be intended to bring
pressure on the Socialist government to negotiate the exchange of
French hostages in Lebanon with criminals convicted of terrorist crimes
in French jails.
