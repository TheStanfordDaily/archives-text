MANILA, Philippines â€” President Ferdinand
Marcos put the nation's military forces on "full
alert" today, the eve of the presidential election,
after accusing his political opposition of inciting
trouble.
The government radio said all leaves and fur
loughs were canceled for the Philippines' armed
forces, numbering more than 200,000, as of noon
today.
Although the armed forces are customarily put
on alert at election time, Marcos' action coincided
with previous warnings that he wOuld crack down
on instigators of violence.
In a final campaign appearance yesterday,
Marcos called on backers of opposition candidate
Corazon Aquino to "stop what they have begun,"
referring to minor street violence that marked the
last day of electioneering.
Spokesmen for the Aquino camp said they
feared Marcos might use the incidents of stone
throwing and random scuffles between supporters
of the two candidates to justify canceling the elec
tion.
Gen. Fabian Ver, the armed forces chief, said
some members of civilian militia units would be
allowed to retain weapons in "areas where their

presence is needed" because of activity by commu
nist insurgents. The militia units, many of them
with limited training, have been blamed for some
human rights abuses.
Ver s regular forces were deputized earlier as
election peacekeepers, while the paramilitary units
were not. He said those allowed to keep arms
would not have any role in the voting process.
The military has been accused in past elections of
intimidating opposition supporters.
Marcos accused his opponents yesterday of
sowing hatred and revolution during the bitter
campaign. Aquino called him an old dictator whose
time has passed.
Speaking in a Manila park during a heavy rain,
Marcos addressed these remarks to Aquino and her
supporters: "Slow down, you children of little
brains, you're no match for the administration.
"I ask my opponents to stop what they have
begun. You have sowed an atmosphere of hatred,
anger and revolution. Now I say to you, the govern
ment of the Philippines is not defenseless," Marcos
said on the last day of campaigning.
Marcos, 68, has been in power since 1965 and
ruled by martial law for eight years beginning in
1972.
