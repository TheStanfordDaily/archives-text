# Reagan budget faces a tough road
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan, clinging to his own deeply
felt priorities despite mounting Con
gressional demands for change, yes
terday unveiled a $994 billion spend
ing blueprint that would raise next
year's defense budget by $34 billion
above current levels and cut $24 bil
lion from health care, education,
housing, transportation and other
domestic programs.
The White House budget for fiscal
1987, which begins Oct. 1, is de
signed to meet the $ 144 billion deficit
target required by the Gramm-
Rudman balanced budget act without
raising taxes or limiting Social Secur
ity benefits.
And, tacitly recognizing that
Congress has previously rejected
many of the proposed cuts in domes
tic spending, the Administration held
out hope that no further spending
cuts of such magnitude would be re
quired to achieve a balanced budget
by 1991.
"If Congress signs off on the presi
dent's budget," said White House
budget director James Miller 111, "we
don't have to take the so-called bat}
medicine but once."

That prognosis rests, however, on
an assumption that there will be
robust economic growth uninter
rupted for the next five years — a
record of sustained prosperity that
would be without precedent for the
United States since World War 11.
In any case, there is scant evidence
that Congress is going to accept the
president's budget as presented.
Many of the programs marked for the
budget knife — like Amtrak rail sub
sidies, small business loans and sup
port for mass transit construction —
continue to have strong support in
Congress. Other White House
proposals aimed at selling off major
chunks of federal property and auc
tioning part of its loan portfolio to the
highest bidder are likely to be greeted
with skepticism.
Even before yesterday, when
Reagan officially disclosed his new
budget, lawmakers began arguing
that the White House proposal would
be "dead on arrival."
The president's spending blueprint
for fiscal 1987 meets the $144 billion
deficit target of the new Gramm-
Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing
law by proposing $38 billion worth of

spending cutbacks and service
charges, many of them previously
rejected by Congress.
The Administration would kill
many domestic programs, slash even
more of them, shift others to state
and local governments and, in a
major initiative, sell a wide array of
federal assets, such as government
owned oil fields. Activities ranging
from hydroelectric-power delivery to
housing and crop insurance would be
taken over by the private sector.
Hardly a domestic program, from in
fant feeding to health care for the el
derly, would emerge unscathed.
Amtrak subsidies and other mass
transit aid, legal assistance for the
poor, the Small Business Administra
tion, housing construction, agricul
tural extension services, two criminal
justice programs, Export-Import
Bank direct loans, Urban Develop
ment Action Grants (UDAG) and
economic-development programs
would be eliminated, along with the
nearly century-old Interstate Com
merce Commission and a veterans'
education program that is less than a
year old.
Heavy new cuts would be made in

such major programs as Medicare
and Medicaid. Able-bodied welfare
recipients would have to accept jobs;
Medicare recipients would have to
pay higher premiums; at least 1 mil
lion college students would lose
federal aid.
The budget proposes to continue
the military buildup at a rate of 8 per
cent after inflation (from $286.1 bil
lion to $320.3 billion), increase
spending for foreign security assis
tance and space exploration, and
protect the politically sensitive Social
Security program.
While the proposal meets the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings targets,
with $400 million to spare for next
year and a surplus of $1.3 billion by
fiscal 1991, Reagan's budget was
based on optimistic economic
forecasts that anticipate robust
growth and declining unemployment,
inflation and interest rates over the
five-year period.
Under a less optimistic scenario
that could include a recession before
the decade is out, as some economists
foresee, the deficit-reduction targets
could be missed by significant
amounts.

from hydroelectric-power delivery to
housing and crop insurance would be
taken over by the private sector.
Hardly a domestic program, from in
fant feeding to health care for the el
derly, would emerge unscathed.
Amtrak subsidies and other mass
transit aid, legal assistance for the
poor, the Small Business Administra
tion, housing construction, agricul
tural extension services, two criminal
justice programs, Export-Import
Bank direct loans, Urban Develop
ment Action Grants (UDAG) and
economic-development programs
would be eliminated, along with the
nearly century-old Interstate Com
merce Commission and a veterans'
education program that is less than a
year old.
Heavy new cuts would be made in

such major programs as Medicare
and Medicaid. Able-bodied welfare
recipients would have to accept jobs;
Medicare recipients would have to
pay higher premiums; at least 1 mil
lion college students would lose
federal aid.
The budget proposes to continue
the military buildup at a rate of 8 per
cent after inflation (from $286.1 bil
lion to $320.3 billion), increase
spending for foreign security assis
tance and space exploration, and
protect the politically sensitive Social
Security program.
While the proposal meets the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings targets,
with $400 million to spare for next
year and a surplus of $1.3 billion by
fiscal 1991, Reagan's budget was
based on optimistic economic
forecasts that anticipate robust
growth and declining unemployment,
inflation and interest rates over the
five-year period.
Under a less optimistic scenario
that could include a recession before
the decade is out, as some economists
foresee, the deficit-reduction targets
could be missed by significant
amounts.
