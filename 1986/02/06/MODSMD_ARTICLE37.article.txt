Arrow jet had problems
WASHINGTON — The Federal Aviation Ad
ministration found numerous and recurring
safety problems in Arrow Air jetliners months
before a company plane crashed last December
in Canada, killing 248 U.S. soldiers and eight
crew members, an FA A official told a House
subcommittee yesterday.
But the FA A failed to report its findings to a
Pentagon agency chartering Arrow Air planes to
transport U.S. troops, said Anthony Broderick,
FA As associate administrator for aviation-safety
standards.
Broderick acknowledged that FA A officials
responsible for monitoring safety standards of
the commercial planes chartered by the Military
Airlift Command failed to correctly interpret a
1976 regulation requiring them to notify MAC
"whenever a potential problem is discovered,
particularly involving safety." FA A officials mis
takenly thought they were obligated only to
report an airliner if its certification was

suspended or revoked, said Broderick. "It's clear
to me we haven't understood this regulation as
people thought we should have."
Broderick's testimony came during the first
day of hearings by the House Armed Services
Committee's subcommitee on investigations
prompted by the Dec. 12 crash in Gander, New
foundland. of an Arrow Air DC-8 jetliner carry
ing troops home for the holiday from peace
keeping chores in Egypt to Fort Campbell, Ky.
AIDS report ordered
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, vowing
to keep the fight against AIDS one of the na
tion's top health priorities, announced yesterday
that he has directed the surgeon general to
prepare a major federal report on the deadly
disease.
"We are going to continue to develop and test
vaccines, and we're going to focus also on pre
vention," Reagan told employees of the Depart

ment of Health and Human Services at a rally to
promote his budget initiatives.
White House and public health officials said
the president decided it was time to take "an aut
horitative look" at AIDS in an effort to reduce
public fears and misconceptions about the
disease. They said they hope the report, des
cribed as "a primer" to be completed in two to
three months, will prove to be a watershed event
in public thinking about AIDS, much as the sur
geon general's report on smoking has defined
that issue since the 19605.
In his fiscal 1987 budget, Reagan asked for
$203 million for AIDS research and education.

NEW YORK — The stock market showed no
consistent trend yesterday as investors awaited

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
closed at 1,593.12, down .11 from Tuesday.
