Fiedler tapes heard
LOS ANGELES — Reporters listened yester
day to the recorded voice of an Ed Davis sup
porter telling how a backer of Rep. Bobbi Fiedler
approached him to see if Davis would quit the
U.S. Senate race.
It was the first of several hours of taped con
versations turned over to Fiedler, who made the
tapes public. She is charged with trying to lure
Davis out of the GOP primary with an offer of
$100,000 to pay off Davis' campaign debt.
Meanwhile, the district attorney's office
released a grand jury transcript and tapes that led
to Fiedler's indictment. District attorney's
spokesman Schuyler Sprowles said that since
Fiedler's attorneys released the tapes, his office
saw no problem with releasing the grand jury
transcripts.
Huddling over huge audio speakers, reporters
at the Sportsman's Lodge in Studio City got the
first close look yesterday at the political corrup
tion investigation as it unfolded.
Fiedler, in Washington for the president's
State of the Union address, said she was confi
dent after reviewing the tapes that she would be
cleared of the charge. Both Davis and Fiedler
want the GOP nomination to challenge incum
bent Democrat Alan Cranston in the fall.

Oscar nominations
HOLLYWOOD — As expected, Steven Spiel
berg's "The Color Purple" and Sydney Pollack's
"Out of Africa" dominated the 1985 Academy
Awards nominations, announced yesterday by
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences. Each film received nominations in 11
categories, including that of best picture.
Spielberg, Pollack and 79-year-old John Hus
ton, who directed the dark gangster comedy
"Prizzi's Honor," were regarded as sure bets for
director nominations, especially after being
nominated last week, along with Peter Weir
("Witness") and Ron Howard ("Cocoon"), for
the Directors Guild of America award.
The academy's directors excluded Howard, as
well as Spielberg, from their final slate and in
stead selected Japan's 76-year-old master Akira
Kurosawa (" Ran") and Brazil's Hector Babenco
("Kiss of the Spider Woman").
Besides "The Color Purple" and "Out of
Africa," the best picture nominees were
"Witness," "Kiss of the Spider Woman" and
"Prizzi's Honor."
There were a few surprises in the acting
categories, as well, notably the inclusion of James
Garner ("Murphy's Romance"), for a perfor
mance that received very little Oscar support
from its releasing studio, Columbia Pictures, and
Jon Voight ("Runaway Train"), considered a

long shot even though his performance was trum
peted almost daily in Hollywood trade-paper ads
taken out by Cannon Films.
Other nominees included:
Actor: Harrison Ford, "Witness"; James
Garner, "Murphy's Romance"; William Hurt,
Kiss of the Spider Woman"; Jack Nicholson,
'Prizzi s Honor ; Jon Voight, "Runaway Train."
Actress: Anne Bancroft, "Agnes of God";
Whoopi Goldberg, "The Color Purple"; Jessica
Lange, "Sweet Dreams"; Geraldine Page, "The
Trip to Bountiful"; Meryl Streep, "Out of
Africa."
Supporting Actor: Don Ameche, "Cocoon";
Klaus Maria Brandauer, "Out of Africa";
William Hickey, "Prizzi's Honor"; Robert Log
gia, "Jagged Edge"; Eric Roberts, "Runaway
Train."
Supporting Actress: Margaret Avery, "The
Color Purple"; Anjelica Huston, "Prizzi's
Honor"; Amy Madigan, "Twice in a Lifetime";
Meg Tilly, "Agnes of God"; Oprah Winfrey,
"The Color Purple."
