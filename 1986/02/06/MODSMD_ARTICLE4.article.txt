Amid criticism that the new building will
destroy the "integrity" of the park surrounding
the Oval, the Graduate School of Business's
planned addition will be considered for final
funding approval by the Board of Trustees
Monday.
Stanford Planning Dire':tor Phi? WiUftms said
that this is the last of three approval stages for
new buildings and is normally devoted exclu
sively to budget questions. But he added that
"because it has been controversial, I am going
to be prepared to review the design issues in

volving sighting and appearance, although these
have already been approved."
When finished, the proposed U-shaped build
ing will intersect Memorial Way and sit astride
Lasuen Street. The north wing will extend 80
feet into one of the wooded areas surrounding
the oval, or roughly a quarter of the distance

integrity of the campus."
Turner told Kennedy that Leland Stanford
and Frederick Law Olmstead, who created the

land — a great front garden, in effect, spanning
the full width of the Outer Quad. All other
spaces in the vicinity of the Quad were con

burner ndded that crossing Lasuen ''would
destroy the integrity of this pasVumd M 'tfs well as
setting "the worst kind of precedent. Once the
hitherto sacrosanct boundaries of the park are
violated, the way is open for further encroach
ments."

Paul Johnson, the associate dean for adminis
tration at the business school, said the upcoming
funding review will be merely the final step in a
routine series of approval procedures stretching
over the last four years.
"Sighting and design approval were given last
year. . . . These issues (that Turner and others
raised ) were discussed at prior meetings and this
plan was given approval," Johnson said.
