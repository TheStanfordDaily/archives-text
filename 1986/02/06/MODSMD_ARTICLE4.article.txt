# GSB addition up for final trustee approval
## 
### KEITH SEINFELD Staff writer 
Amid criticism that the new building will
destroy the "integrity" of the park surrounding
the Oval, the Graduate School of Business's
planned addition will be considered for final
funding approval by the Board of Trustees
Monday.
Stanford Planning Dire':tor Phi? WiUftms said
that this is the last of three approval stages for
new buildings and is normally devoted exclu
sively to budget questions. But he added that
"because it has been controversial, I am going
to be prepared to review the design issues in

volving sighting and appearance, although these
have already been approved."
When finished, the proposed U-shaped build
ing will intersect Memorial Way and sit astride
Lasuen Street. The north wing will extend 80
feet into one of the wooded areas surrounding
the oval, or roughly a quarter of the distance
from Lasuen to Palm Drive.
The most vocal criticism of this plan has come
HftTOJlcs 4 ' -"'eh/ and Art
Histoiy Prof. Paul Turner, an expert on the his
tory of American campus design. In a letter to
University President Donald Kennedy made
availible to the Stanford News Service, Turner
said the project is "a grave threat to the physical

integrity of the campus."
Turner told Kennedy that Leland Stanford
and Frederick Law Olmstead, who created the
original campus plan, "designated the area be
tween Lasuen Street and Lomita Drive as park
land — a great front garden, in effect, spanning
the full width of the Outer Quad. All other
spaces in the vicinity of the Quad were con
ceived as potentially usable, but not this park."
burner ndded that crossing Lasuen ''would
destroy the integrity of this pasVumd M 'tfs well as
setting "the worst kind of precedent. Once the
hitherto sacrosanct boundaries of the park are
violated, the way is open for further encroach
ments."

Paul Johnson, the associate dean for adminis
tration at the business school, said the upcoming
funding review will be merely the final step in a
routine series of approval procedures stretching
over the last four years.
"Sighting and design approval were given last
year. . . . These issues (that Turner and others
raised ) were discussed at prior meetings and this
plan was given approval," Johnson said.
_ Williams weed, adding, "There have been
etianges all through the project — just before
Christmas we reviewed the most recent objec
tions. At that time we kept the basic sight deci-
sion.. . but simplified the design to be
more in line with Stanford architec
ture. I guess you could call it tuning
up." They also decided on a small
modification that will allow the reten
tion of some of the existing parking
on Lasuen, Williams said.
Kennedy was out of town and
unable to comment on the proposal,
but Assistant to the President Bob

Hamrdla said, "It is a project being
put forward through the usual proce
dures. The President's Office has no
direct connection with the process,
but several committees looked at it,
including the University Committee
on Land and Building Develop
ment," which is composed of students
and faculty.
Director of Facilities and Services
Amy Blue, who will present the fin
ancial proposal to the trustees, said
the final cost of the addition will be
$18.1 million, of which $1.4 million
will go toward financing.
Explaining the function of the up

coming review, Blue said, "As we
move along in a project, and before
we actually go out to bid, we go to the
trustees for final funding approval.
We will be presenting our fundraising
strategy and an assurance of how we
will pay any loans."
Once the trustees' final approval is
given, the contract can be put out to
bid. "All of the details, documenta
tion and such are within six to eight
weeks of asking contractors to bid on
the project," Johnson said.
Williams said, "If funding is ap
proved, construction should begin in
late April or May."
