# SOAR ski shop funding blocked
## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
In a move that has forced students to confront
fundamental policy questions concerning the al
location of special fee money, the ASSU Senate
Appropriations Committee has blocked efforts by
the Stanford Outdoor Activities and Recreation
Club (SOAR) to gain funding for expansion of
their services.
The appropriations committee has issued a pre
liminary rejection of SOAR's proposed fee assess
ment, which prevents SOAR's special fee request
from being placed on the ballot in the spring elec
tions. SOAR's fee assessment requested $3,000 for
the "one-time capital expense" of ski equipment.
SOAR planned to rent skis, boots, bindings and
poles at prices lower than rentals available off
campus to Stanford students.
SOAR Student Coordinator Kent Borowick said
SOAR's expansion into ski rental is "a good
idea that should have been thought of 10 years

ago." He expressed surprise at the appropriations
committee's decision not to recommend to the
ASSU Senate that SOAR's special fee request be
honored.
Senate Chair Carey White indicated that the ap
propriations committee based its decision on the
premise that the money allocated to SOAR "would
benefit only those renting skis."
White said the appropriations committee has
faced three other requests for special fees that
would serve only a select group of students. Special
fee money granted to Women Defending Them
selves, The Stanford Quad and The Stanford Glee
Club "would clearly be subsidizing only specific
people," White said.
"The cost to serve those who would benefit from
this money is too high per student to justify these
special fees," White said.
Borowick said that to claim the cost per capita is
too high for students is "ludicrous when we're
talking about a one-time capital expense." He
claimed that after three years, the money students

save by renting ski equipment at lower prices from
SOAR will have paid back the $3,000 special fee.
"Students should have the right to decide
whether the special fee will cost too much, rather
than have the ASSU block the request before the
students have any say in the matter," Borowick
said.
White said he had suggested to SOAR that the
money needed for expansion come from ASSU
loans or a loan from Tresidder Union.
Borowick claimed the cost of a loan from the
ASSU would "eliminate SOAR's ability to provide
a cheap alternative to market prices in ski rentals." 1
He indicated that interest charges on a loan would
be high enough that SOAR would have to raise its
ski rental prices higher than they wanted in order to
pay back the loan and the interest incurred on the
loan. Borowick said the cheaper prices SOAR
would offer is "an important point in the program"
SOAR has proposed.
ASSU senator Jim DeLaHunt
questioned the idea that SOAR
"would need to offer lower prices as
well as convenience in its rentals."
"They should do a good business
merely because of the convenience of

SOAR's location on campus. Why is
it necessary that they have services
below the market rate?" he said.
DeLaHunt also pointed out that in
the past the ASSU has considered
SOAR "a department of Tresidder
Union" because Tresidder provides
space, staffing and office expenses to
SOAR.
