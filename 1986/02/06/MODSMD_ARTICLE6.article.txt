strikers, Alvarez said.
Police have arrested and beaten
strikers on charges of violence and vi

the strikers, and the companies tell
them," Murillo said.
Hearings are being held this week
in Watsonville regarding the claims

The workers are protesting the rejec
tion of their requests for unemploy
ment compensation in court and are
considering filing a lawsuit, she said.
