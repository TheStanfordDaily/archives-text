# Living off campus has its advantages

When junior Anna Maria
Cortes drew 4,946 (out of 5.000)
in last spring's Draw, her hopes for
on-campus housing, except as a
walk-on in the fall, vanished. Be
cause Stanford does not guarantee
four years of housing to its under
graduates, bad luck in the Draw
has forced many students like
Cortes to seek off-campus
housing.

Feature

Surprisingly, almost all of the
exiles interviewed enjoy their off
campus lifestyles and generally
recommend the experience. Al
though off-campus students live
far away, they enjoy what most
dorm dwellers cannot — privacy
and a sense of home.
Rodger Whitney, asistant dean
and director of the Stanford
Housing Center, estimated that
about half of the 700 off-campus
undergraduates would have
preferred to live on campus.
"Accomodating all students
with campus housing is a high
Stanford priority," Whitney said.
However, until proposed housing
facilities are built, many more un
dergraduates and graduates will
reluctantly discover life beyond El
Camino Real.
Cortes said that had she known
how pleasurable her off-campus
life was going to be. she might not

have been so unhappy after pick
ing her high Draw number. But
finding a good off-campus house
or apartment demands much time
and effort, she adds.
Furthermore, acording to Nancy
Kikuchi, supervisor of Stanford's
Off-Campus Rental and Housing
Office, many house owners prefer
to rent to families rather than to
students. Kikuchi said that, unlike
many universities, "Stanford has
no ghettos."
Nonetheless, Kikuchi said that
in the fall, students can find off
campus housing in less than two
weeks. Rooms in houses with lim
ited privileges average about $250
a month and houses to share
average $350. Kikuchi added that
women seem to have less difficulty
than men in finding sharing situa
tions.
To avoid the fall rush, Cortes
began looking during the summer.
After about a month of searching,
Cortes and her four friends found
a five-bedroom house in Menlo
Park. Cortes pays $285 a month in
rent and can bike to Stanford in 10
minutes.
She and her housemates love
off-campus life.
"No one organizes your life like
in a dorm," she says.
Cortes said that she sleeps bet
ter and enjoys living near "real
people — families with children
and dogs." The contrast of off
