# Living off campus has its advantages

When junior Anna Maria
Cortes drew 4,946 (out of 5.000)
in last spring's Draw, her hopes for
on-campus housing, except as a
walk-on in the fall, vanished. Be
cause Stanford does not guarantee
four years of housing to its under
graduates, bad luck in the Draw
has forced many students like
Cortes to seek off-campus
housing.

Feature

Surprisingly, almost all of the
exiles interviewed enjoy their off
campus lifestyles and generally
recommend the experience. Al
though off-campus students live
far away, they enjoy what most
dorm dwellers cannot — privacy
and a sense of home.
Rodger Whitney, asistant dean
and director of the Stanford
Housing Center, estimated that
about half of the 700 off-campus
undergraduates would have
preferred to live on campus.
"Accomodating all students
with campus housing is a high
Stanford priority," Whitney said.
However, until proposed housing
facilities are built, many more un
dergraduates and graduates will
reluctantly discover life beyond El
Camino Real.
Cortes said that had she known
how pleasurable her off-campus
life was going to be. she might not

have been so unhappy after pick
ing her high Draw number. But
finding a good off-campus house
or apartment demands much time
and effort, she adds.
Furthermore, acording to Nancy
Kikuchi, supervisor of Stanford's
Off-Campus Rental and Housing
Office, many house owners prefer
to rent to families rather than to
students. Kikuchi said that, unlike
many universities, "Stanford has
no ghettos."
Nonetheless, Kikuchi said that
in the fall, students can find off
campus housing in less than two
weeks. Rooms in houses with lim
ited privileges average about $250
a month and houses to share
average $350. Kikuchi added that
women seem to have less difficulty
than men in finding sharing situa
tions.
To avoid the fall rush, Cortes
began looking during the summer.
After about a month of searching,
Cortes and her four friends found
a five-bedroom house in Menlo
Park. Cortes pays $285 a month in
rent and can bike to Stanford in 10
minutes.
She and her housemates love
off-campus life.
"No one organizes your life like
in a dorm," she says.
Cortes said that she sleeps bet
ter and enjoys living near "real
people — families with children
and dogs." The contrast of off
campus life reminds her "that Stan
ford isn't the only thing."
Even though Cortes has a car, she
said that she doesn't participate in
campus life as much as she would
like. She said that next year she will
return to on-campus living, but highly
recommends the off-campus lifestyle.
Although junior Pam Price reluc
tantly moved into her Menlo Park
house near the Dutch Goose after
bad luck in the Draw, she likes off
campus life. Price pays $375 to share
a five-bedroom house with friends.
Besides the obvious benefits of
having a private bedroom, Price en
joys "the feeling of coming home."
Price also likes to grocery shop, cook
and be able "to go to the kitchen
without getting all dressed up in the
morning."
However, Price said that off
campus living has a few drawbacks.
Although she has a car, she still said
living off campus is inconvenient.
Price also does not like having her
landlady's parents living in a Win
nebago parked in the driveway.

"They're very grouchy," she said.
Price will also live on campus next
year. She recommended off-campus
life as a "learning experience" and as
a way to deepen friendships with
housemates.
Not all students leave campus be
cause of bad luck in the Draw. Many
leave voluntarily in pursuit of more
privacy, autonomy, better food, a
home for their pet or to live with
friends.
Senior Kiki Kelble planned to
spend senior year off campus. Ac
cording to Kelble, off-campus life is
"a good balance between school and
home." She enjoys her housemates
and still keeps in touch with her
campus friends. But Kelble agreed
that a car is a necessity if living off
campus.
Fed up by what she calls
"outrageous food service" and "life
in the trailers," junior Allison Reid
left campus without any regrets.
After a four-month search, Reid
found a nice two-bedroom apartment
near Kepler's in Menlo Park for $375
per month, which she shares with a
non-student. To get back and forth

from campus, she bikes or drives.
Unlike some off-campus students,
Reid in no way feels isolated from
campus life or friends. She also likes
having a cat; dorms don't allow pets.
Like Reid, junior Geordie McKee
also voluntarily chose off-campus life.
McKee shares a two-bedroom apart
ment near the Hyatt Palo Alto with a
classmate. Although he has more
privacy and sleeps better than ever,
McKee, like Price, misses the con
venience of living on campus. He has
a car, but he says that battling the
stop and go traffic of El Camino tires
him. And while McKee welcomes off
campus life as a relief from noisy
dorm life, he recognizes its serious so
cial drawbacks.
Unfortunately, Stanford cannot ac
commodate all those who wish to live
on campus. Fortunately, many stu
dents who have no other choice dis
cover the advantages of off-campus
living. Perhaps, if Stanford were
closer both physically and culturally
to Palo Alto, Mountain View and
Menlo Park, even more students
would seek an existence beyond the
confines of Res Ed.
