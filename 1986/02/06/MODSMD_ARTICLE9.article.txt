# Officials worried by midweek parties
## 
### MIA MANZULLI 
Parties at Stanford are starting earlier and ear
lier in the week and several residential adminis
trators are worried about the effect on students'
studies and dormitory responsibilities. But this
trend is not noticeable at other universities con
tacted, according to student affairs departments
at those schools.
Muriel Whitcomb, assistant dean of students in
charge of student organizations and student ac
tivities at Princeton University, said, "Student
government parties and class parties are held on
Friday and Saturday nights . . . occasionally on
Thursdays." There are no fraternities at Prince
ton, but "the eating clubs hold parties on
weekends," she said.
According to Whitcomb, there is no regulation
concerning midweek parties, but there is also no
desire to have them. She said there is "no inter
est, really" in parties on Wednesday
nights."[Party hosts] want to guarantee crowds,
so they hold them on weekends."
Hal Reynolds, student affairs officer at UC-
Berkeley, said fraternities and sororities gener
ally hold parties on Thursday nights. Cal has "no
policy for parties," Reynolds said.
Since fraternities and sororities are off
campus, parties fall under the jurisdiction of the
city. However, Cal is taking "an active role in
working with the frats to develop party rules,"
said Reynolds, adding that a revised version of
these rules is currently in effect.

Archie Ebbs, Harvard University's dean of
students, declined to comment.
At Stanford, many of the administrators who
oversee residential issues are concerned about
the growing trend.
Diana Conklin, Stanford assistant dean of stu
dent affairs and director of the Row, called the
Wednesday night parties at Stanford "a real bad
idea. ... They seem as if they would be dis
ruptive to people who are studying."
There are plans "to talk to the frats to see if we
can convince them" to put an end to these par
ties, Conklin said.
Wednesday night parties pull people away
from residence activities, according to Conklin.
"People going to midweek parties are likely to
wind up paying for it academically. That's not
very wise," she said.
Norm Robinson, associate dean of Student Af
fairs, concurred with Conklin, saying these par
ties are "not a great idea." However, he is not
calling for "prohibition."
According to Robinson, the University has
tended not to regulate parties. "Instead, we rely
on the students, individually and collectively, for
good judgment decisions. This (midweek parties)
doesn't seem to be a wise one," he said, adding
that he hopes the students realize the conse
quences of their actions.
Branner Hall Resident Fellow Kennell Jackson
called midweek parties "a devastating thing."
Jackson said he feels fraternities have a right to
hold parties but fears they "might be getting

ripped off. They are being used for their social
life."
All who attend are not attracted to joining the
fraternities, according to Jackson, who said that
he is "puzzled as to what the impact is on frat
life."
"Generally, too much attention is given to par
ties," said Serra Resident Fellow Bob Kieft. I
don't care when they happen." However, he ob
served that "too many students I know study fit
fully. The existence of parties encourages that. I
don't know if anything can be done to stop it."
Kieft added that he would not favor legislation
regulating party times. He said he does not feel
parties are causing a decrease in house meetings
and activities."People who don't come aren't
going to come anyway," Kieft said.
But Branner Resident Assistant Tony James
said, "We have 10 o'clock meetings and people
are getting ready for 10 o'clock parties." James
has "noticed a big push for parties to start on
Wednesdays ... it's a recent push."
Members of fraternities have different
opinions on midweek parties.
Delta Upsilon has posted fliers advertising
"the 5-Day Weekend," but DU President Bob
Davenport said, "Our Wednesday night parties
are designed to be a break in the week of study
ing. . . . They are not designed to start the
weekend earlier."
Phi Delta Theta President Todd Seidner said
he does not "consider Wednesday as a part of the
weekend."

All who attend are not attracted to joining the
fraternities, according to Jackson, who said that
he is "puzzled as to what the impact is on frat
life."
"Generally, too much attention is given to par
ties," said Serra Resident Fellow Bob Kieft. I
don't care when they happen." However, he ob
served that "too many students I know study fit
fully. The existence of parties encourages that. I
don't know if anything can be done to stop it."
Kieft added that he would not favor legislation
regulating party times. He said he does not feel
parties are causing a decrease in house meetings
and activities."People who don't come aren't
going to come anyway," Kieft said.
But Branner Resident Assistant Tony James
said, "We have 10 o'clock meetings and people
are getting ready for 10 o'clock parties." James
has "noticed a big push for parties to start on
Wednesdays ... it's a recent push."
Members of fraternities have different
opinions on midweek parties.
Delta Upsilon has posted fliers advertising
"the 5-Day Weekend," but DU President Bob
Davenport said, "Our Wednesday night parties
are designed to be a break in the week of study
ing. . . . They are not designed to start the
weekend earlier."
Phi Delta Theta President Todd Seidner said
he does not "consider Wednesday as a part of the
weekend."
