# Cosby is seniors' first choice
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
University senior class presidents
have asked University President
Donald Kennedy to invite ac
tor/comedian Bill Cosby to speak at
this year's graduation ceremony, re
sponding to a poll circulated last quar
ter that indicates that Cosby is the
number one choice of Stanford
seniors.
"Kennedy is sounding out the op
tions right now," Senior Class Presi
dent Patrick Shannon said yesterday.
"He's doing all the leg work."
Senior Class President Leslie Dar
win said that Kennedy's office has
been in contact with Cosby's agent
but that an invitation has not yet been
sent.
"Nothing definite has been done as
far as I know," Darwin said.
Seniors who responded to a poll
circulated by the senior class presi
dents rated Cosby, who currently
stars in the top-rated "The Cosby
Show," as their preferred choice as a
graduation speaker, with Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev and ABC
anchorman Ted Koppel placing
second and third respectively. Other
contenders in the poll were former
CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite,
South African Bishop Desmond Tutu
and President Reagan.
"I think Cosby's an acceptable
choice," Shannon said. "Stanford stu
dents want to be entertained."
Shannon denied rumors that Cosby
would agree to speak only if he
received an honorary degree from the
University, which is contrary to Uni
versity policy.
"The way I understand it, that
started as a joke stemming from
Ronald Reagan's refusal to speak at
Harvard without receiving an
honorary degree," Shannon said.
Senior Class President Kim Oden
said yesterday she was excited by the
decision to invite Cosby.
"I'd be thrilled if he came. He's in
telligent, funny and someone who
could really inspire people," Oden
said.
Gorbachev was issued an invitation
Feb. 3 by the senior class presidents
to speak at the Commencement cere
mony, prefaced by a cover letter by
Kennedy expressing students' "strong
desire" for a visit from the Soviet
leader.
But according to the Feb. 5 Penin
sula Times Tribune, a spokesman for
the Soviet Embassy in Washington,
D.C. said Gorbachev will "probably
not" be able to fit such a visit into his
schedule of future visits to the United
States. The spokesman said, however,
that he was stating his own opinion
and not that of the Soviet govern
ment.
Shannon told The Daily last week
that because Gorbachev's planned
follow-up summit meeting with
Reagan will likely be next fall, the in
vitation is not specifically aimed at
landing the Soviet leader as a Com
mencement speaker.
Kennedy's special assistant, Mar
lene Wine, would be responsible for
negotiating a Cosby visit subsequent
to an invitation from Kennedy. In an
interview last night, Wine said a
response from Cosby could be ex
pected "relatively soon" if and when
an invitation is sent.
She added that it would be "a lot
easier to get Cosby" than to have
Gorbachev visit the University.
