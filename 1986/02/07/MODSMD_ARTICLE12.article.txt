# Scientists find carcinogen clue

Stanford researchers say they have dis
covered a more accurate method of identify
ing chemicals that have the potential to
cause cancer.
"It's a new way to approach mutation in
human cells," said Dr. Michele Calos, an as
sistant professor of genetics at Stanford
Medical School and one of the developers of
the test.
The standard method of studying danger
ous compounds uses recordings of changes
only in bacteria. The new method examines
substances' harmful effects directly in
human cells.
The process can be carried out completely
in laboratory "test tubes" without the need
to expose animals to chemicals, another
standard procedure for detecting hazardous
substances, according to its developers.
The key to the new method is that scien
tists use a transportable piece of DNA as the
mutation target. This piece of DNA is a bac
terial gene whose structure down to the last
atom is already known.
Scientists take the gene„ put it into a type
of human cell, then expose the cell to the
chemical. After a few days, a mutation
forms and the DNA is removed. It is then
placed back into bacteria to be observed.
"We're shuttling this gene from one cell
to another," Calos said.

The reason the gene is placed back into
the bacteria is that it divides much faster
than when it stays in a human cell. The num
ber and nature of the resulting mutations
can be more easily detected and analyzed
when in bacteria.
However, by letting the gene mutate for
awhile in a human cell, researchers can get a
"more accurate picture of what's going on,"
Calos said.
"Bacteria is the same as human cells in
many ways . . . but also very different," she
added. The new test combines the best of
both worlds — the speed of the old bacteria
test, called the Ames Test, as well as the
precision obtained by using cells from
humans.
"What we're really trying to do is model
the human organism in tissue culture be
cause we obviously won't do these kinds of
experiments directly on people," Calos ex
plained.
The test can also measure effects of other
mutagenic agents such as ultraviolet light
on human cells, and it could be useful for
studying chemicals that people have claimed
can prevent cancer, she said.
The research conducted so far has used
embryonic human cells. Calos said studies
are now looking at mutations of white blood
cells and liver cells.
Although the new test requires further
development and study before its powers
are fully evaluated, it is expected to be of in

terest to the pharmaceutical, pesticide and
other chemical industries that are required
to document the dangers of chemical com
pounds they produce.
The test also may be a valuable basic re
search tool for scientific molecular under
standing of mutation and certain rare ge
netic cancer-causing diseases.
Eventually, the method "might be a bet
ter way to screen compounds that might be
cancer-causing," Calos said. "More impor
tantly, it will aid in helping to understand
the fundamental molecular biology of can
cer."
An article describing an early version of
the test method was published in the
December issue of the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.
Calos' co-authors on the article are Dr.
Jane Lebkowski, a former Stanford postdoc
toral researcher; Suzanne Clancy, a
graduate student and Dr. Jeffrey Miller of
UCLA. Others involved in the work are
Bob Dußridge, a graduate student, Michele
Schwartz, a medical student, and Peter
Tang, a research assistant.
Since that article was written, Calos and
her group have refined the test system to be
faster and more sensitive. Research by Bill
Sugden at the University of Wisconsin
played a vital role in the new refinements,
Calos said.
