Today is the day of the Philippine elections. This is a
critical turning point for both the Philippines and for
the future of U.S. policy in the region. The election
represents the first serious challenge that President
Ferdinand Marcos has allowed since imposing martial
law in 1972, and it opens up the possibility of political,
economic and military reforms in a nation burdened
with a $26 billion debt and an array of corrupt,
monopolistic economic practices.
For the United States, this election highlights a
growing uncertainty as to how to handle its former
colony and longstanding ally, and concern over the se
curity of two of its most crucial military installations.
Given the history and the nature of the relationship
between the United States and the Philippines,
whatever actions we do or do not take with regard to
this election cannot but help to influence its outcome.
The objectives of the United States have not changed
since the turn of the century, when we took possession
of the islands and sought to establish a stable, pro-
American society.
We wanted to enhance our geopolitical position and
military power through access to strategically valuable
bases, and we have continued to pursue this policy.
The United States is the second largest employer in the
Philippines, and our two major military bases, Clark
Field and Subic Bay, are only the most prominent of a
wide array of U.S. interests in the archipelago. In many
ways, the United States has never left the Philippines.
Because of these facts, the United States has tre
mendous economic and political influence in the
Philippines. But we have remained reluctant to use this
power to push for reforms. Despite 15 years of martial

law, a rapidly deteriorating economy, rising poverty
and a mounting foreign debt, the United States has
taken no action to change the situation in the
Philippines. It was only concern over a mounting com
munist insurgency which finally motivated the United
States to push Marcos for reforms. The result of this
U.S. pressure is clear: our actions were instrumental in
forcing Marcos to call for early presidential elections.
But U.S. pressure should not stop here.
The presidential elections today are only the first
step in a process of change in the Philippines, and our
response is crucial. Although President Reagan ap
parently holds the view that U.S. assistance to the
Philippines should be maintained in any case, the
United States should use this opportunity to reconsider
its foreign aid policy in the Philippines, which includes
$102.7 million in military aid and $125.7 million in
economic help. Regardless of who wins the elections,
aid should be contingent upon the implementation of a
variety of economic, political and military reforms. The
United States should use its political and economic
power to influence "this major friend and ally" in or
der to ensure that long-awaited and much-needed
reforms proceed as quickly as possible.
Presidential candidate Corazon Aquino summarized
the situation when she said, "I would like to believe
that America is interfering for good reasons and that
she will continue to tell the Marcos administration how
very concerned she is for us to have clean and honest
elections so that we can have a peaceful transition of
power."
The United States should take this opportunity to
prove that she is right.
