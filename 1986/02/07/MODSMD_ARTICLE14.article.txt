SDI is a bad idea
Nancy Latham's column of Jan. 31
("SDI Key to Arms Control"),
espousing the "bargaining chip"
rationale for the Strategic Defense
Initiative (SDI), only underscores the
absurdity of President Reagan's
defense policy.
SDI, claims Latham, has two possi
ble uses: defense of our strategic
land-based missiles, and leverage
against the Soviets at the Geneva
"umbrella talks." The first use of SDI
sounds suspiciously like the
Safeguard anti-ballistic missile system
President Nixon deployed in 1971
that was subsequently outlawed in
SALT I. Reagan is toeing a very thin
line with the 1972 ABM treaty if he
indeed intends SDI to protect our
ICBM forces.
It is the second use of SDI, as a
bargaining chip, that appears even
more dubious. MIRVs, cruise missiles
and many other destabilizing arms
technologies that were once touted as
a means to induce Soviet reductions.
Whenever the United States has per
ceived the Soviets as having a tech
nolgocial edge (witness the 1960
"missile gap" and the 1980 "window
of vulnerability"), we have responded
with massive infusions of American
investment in defense technology to
meet the challenge. Why should we
expect the Soviets' response to SDI to
be any different?
Indeed, coupled with Regan's in
vestment in first-strike weapons such
as the MX and Trident 11, SDI can
only increase the likelihood of a
preemptive strike by the Soviets.
Reagan's defense policy is at best

confused; at worst, inflammatory and
destructive. Arms control negotia
tions won't succeed with the flashy
"big stick" policy of the Reagan Ad
ministration. Rather, technological
parity, verifiability and quiet
diplomacy are all prerequisites for
successful arms control. We must
wake up and acknowledge the fraud
that is SDI.

Flicks are bargain
Come on, pal, let's not get
melodramatic. Senior Ron Herbst's
letter of Feb. 5 about screw-ups at the
Sunday Flicks struck me as a little
farcical. It didn't take me a year and a
half of attendance to figure out that
the Flicks offer a last chance to
escape for a couple hours before the
beginning of a new week, a play
ground for overgrown kindergar
teners, a forum for frustrated com
edians and, consequently, a less than
ideal setting in which to "lose
[oneself] in a film."
Why haven't we seen more letters
from people complaining about the
Flicks projectionists' frequent
boners? Because people who pay
$1.50 (30 percent of admission at
most local theaters and 27 perent of
admission at the new theater in
Mountain View with the pretty foun
tain) to see recent major motion
picture releases don't expect to see an
undamaged film run by professional
film technicians. To twist an overused

cliche, "There's no such thing as a
free movie" or, at the heart of the
matter, "you get what you pay for."
Herbst mentioned his anticipation
of the upcoming screening of
"Amadeus". Let me tell you, sir, 1
dug deep and saw the movie when it
was in the theaters, and it is excellent.
My advice to you is to wait for a re
release or to invest in a VCR, and so
avoid "the consistent crap" which
reeks weekly in Mem Aud.

SOAR story erred
I feel compelled to correct two of
the more egregious misstatements in
your article about SOAR's Special
Fee request:
• SOAR is asking for $24,067, not
$3,000 as your article states.
• The senate cannot "block"
anybody's special fee request or
"prevent" it from getting on the bal
lot. Special fee requests are put on
the ballot by petition; senate ap
proval merely reduces the number cf
signatures required.
I could also point out that, when
you ran the article, the Appropria
tions Committee recommendation was
not final and the senate had not even
met to make the binding decision, but
compared to the above that's just
quibbling.
