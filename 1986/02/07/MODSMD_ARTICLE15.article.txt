## Hospital layoffs deserve attention 
### 
After I learned of Stanford Hospital's planned
budget cuts, I kept imagining a fired nurse's final
work day: a gathering of personal effects, perhaps a
farewell party and sad goodbyes to co-workers and
patients who'd been on the ward for a while, and
then a solitary walk, first past some gardeners roll
ing out the new spring "alumni sod," then by a few
scientists discussing the escalating cost of DNA
restriction enzymes, and finally by the naked steel
and concrete of the hospital's massive building
project. In the face of unemployment, bewilder
ment begets resentment.

"Downsizing the hospital" was the ironic title of
Hospital President Sheldon King's memo to all
employees, distributed Jan. 28. He explained that
"to adapt to the realities of the hospital situation,
we must cut $25 million from the hospital budget."
Drops in the patient census, federal funding and in
surance reimbursement had supposedly forced the
hospital's hand. That hand carries not a scalpel, but
a hatchet.
The other hand carries a tool box. some con
struction equipment and a work order for $114
million in hospital modernization. "We are for
tunate that it is going well," continued King's same
memo, "because it represents the future of Stan
ford University Hospital. It will correct most of the
problems with the present facility; it will provide
comfortable, attractive surroundings for our
patients and their families; and it will make all our
jobs easier." It will also make "all our jobs" fewer.
To make such comparisons expresses an appro

priate exasperation without admitting political
naivete. Only with slick but traditional ledger work
— separating operating expenses from captital
growth expenses — can such measures be justified.
Whether they can be justified in terms of human
loss is another question, and I am most distressed
by The Daily's lack of reporting in this regard.

Will patient care and teaching programs suffer as
cuts are made and morale sinks to an all-time low?
What programs specifically will be cut? Are the
straits so dire?

After a long series of exposes on Stanford Hospi
tal Management, which failed to expose the im
pending personnel cuts. The Daily's Jan. 29 report
on the matter read like a hospital press release. The
headline, "Hospital prunes programs" failed to
convey what the University's own Campus Report
mustered: "Hospital to reduce staff, trim $25 mil
lion." The Daily article merely reports the hospital
administration's fait accompli, concluding with
Deputy Director William Arnold's dubious asser
tion that the layoffs will be conducted with a
"massively caring approach." I am not soothed or
convinced — we are reminded far too often of
Stanford's corporate face — and I am surprised
The Daily has failed in subsequent reports (Feb. 3)

to survey this gold mine of controversy. Where are
the quotes, even anonymous ones, from those offi
cials or employees who dispute the administration?
Where are the follow-up editorials? Such decisions
are always internally volatile, then announced as if
they were non-controversial, sad-but-necessary
facts of life. Will patient care and teaching pro-

grams suffer, as cuts are made and employee
morale sinks to an all-time low? Who will stay and
who will go? What programs specifically will be
cut? Is the economic analysis of the situation cor
rect — are the straits so dire? And is the remedy
appropriate, especially concomitant with continued
massive hospital expansion? I have a reflexive an
swer to most of these questions that can be tem
pered — or supported — only with some public dis
closure by the hospital administration and some in
vestigative reporting by the press. The Stanford
community deserves a complete and ongoing anal
ysis of these issues.
