# Real disaster not covered
## 
### 
"That's a part of human nature," my sister exasperat
ingly responded to my complaints and criticisms. "People
are like that and they always will be."
"Perhaps it is human nature," I argued angrily,"and
maybe people will always be like that. But I still don't like
it."
That conversation combined with the explosion of the
space shuttle last week to determine my topic for this
column. I hadn't planned to write on this but those two
events compelled me to. In turn, the resolution to write
the column spurred me to think more about what my
sister had said.
By now, the tragedy of the space shuttle has been
seared into everyone's mind. The explosion catapulted
into the lives of Americans through headlines and photos
in probably every major newspaper in the country. Presi
dent Reagan postponed his State of the Union address.

Memorials were held by the hundreds in cities across the
country. On the day of the explosion, even the soap
operas, the daily "fix" for millions of Americans, were
withheld to bring news of the historic tragedy. The
country experienced a collective grief resulting from the
explosion of the shuttle and the death of its seven pas
sengers.
That's what my sister was referring to as a part of
human nature: the tendency to react with such intense,
and in my opinion excessive, grief to sudden and unex
pected national tragedies such as the shuttle explosion,
while not reacting nearly as strongly to other tragedies of
equal or greater significance.
Why is that, I wonder? Certainly, the shuttle disaster is
much less of a tragedy than some events that will never
capture the front page of the largest papers in the country.
Surely, there are more important things— or there should
be more important things — on the national agenda than
putting people in space.
The shuttle explosion made front page news for several
consecutive days, and it will make many more front page
appearances over the next few months. But what have you
heard about the infant mortality rate in inner-city
Detroit? When was the last time that was on the front
page? You'll probably never see that statistic splattered
across front pages. The infant mortality rate in inner-city
Detroit is the highest in this country, in fact one of the
highest in the industrialized world. Many of the Third
World countries which we pity and sometimes seek to
help, actually have lower infant mortality rates than inner
city Detroit. This is the most appalling of the unheralded
tragedies, but there are many others.
For example, in many large urban areas such as
Cleveland, Chicago and Detroit, the percentage of blacks
and Hispanics who drop out of high school approaches 50
percent. A startling statistic to be sure. What happens
after they leave school is an even sadder tale than the fact
that so many drop out in the first place.
A friend of mine, troubled by the shuttle accident, ex
plained to me that a primary reason the shuttle explosion
was such a tragedy is because it represents such an enor

mous loss of human potential. That's a good point: the
shuttle passengers were no ordinary collection of people.
They were brilliant and accomplished researchers and sci
entists. Yet in terms of human potential, the proportion of
black and Hispanic students not finishing high school
represents an immeasurably greater national loss.
Why, then, does the shuttle explosion exert such a
vigorous hold on our national attention? It has to do in
part, I think, with the suddenness and rarity of the explo
sion and the chronic nature of infant death and high
school attrition. Ironically, the very reason that infant
mortality in Detroit and high school drop outs in inner
cities are such tragedies — their persistence and high fre
quency of occurrence — are the same reasons that we
don't notice them. They have become an ordinary and ac
cepted part of our lives which, because they happen so of
ten and so regularly, we give little attention. Whereas the
shuttle explosion shocked us into awareness, these chronic
problems have numbed us toward indifference. As my
sister said, "It's human nature," to overlook and ignore
atrocities when they are so common as to become
mundane.
There's at least one other reason, also related to human
nature, why the shuttle explosion evokes such intense
grief and disbelief. We vest great national pride in the
space program. Even more than it advances science and
technology, the space program symbolizes our national
pride, our ego. The great push to put a man on the moon,
for example, had little to do with advancing science (after
all, they did nothing more than a finely made robot could
have done), but rather was an expression of our desire to
demonstrate our national prowess: to inflate our already
huge national ego by pumping the iron of technological
advance and flexing the muscles of achievement, so to
speak.
The shuttle failure, at the very least, tarnishes, and per
haps even dents the shield of invincibility and om
nipotence that has inhabited and surrounded our national
self. The reaction has been as if the shuttle faffure was not
only a national tragedy, but a national affront as well.
That's understandable: we take pride in the space pro
gram. Conversely, we do not take pride in poor people,
whether they be men, women or children; their condition
in no way effects our sense of self. We identify our nation
not with the uneducated youth that fill its corners and
prisons or with the children that die because of poor
prenatal nutrition or inadequate medical care, but with a
glamorous and extravagant program that wants to put a
handful of Americans in orbit to experience the thrill of
outer space. Sad but true.
This attitude is not unique to America. Many countries
prefer to flaunt the symbols of national greatness and
achievement rather than attend to the unglamorous con
siderations of working to educate, nourish and fulfill the
basic human needs of the nation's people. "Baby Doc"
Duvalier, president of Haiti (one of the poorest nations in
the Western world), is known for lavish and opulent par
ties. And Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos is re
ported to have a fashionable townhouse in Manhattan
filled with more than $1 million in art and antiques.
Having written the column and thought much about my
conversation with my sister, I can still hear the words ec
hoing in my ear as I hung up the phone: "That's a part of
human nature. People are like that and they always will
be."
"Perhaps," I reply, the anger in my voice turned to
reluctant resignation.
