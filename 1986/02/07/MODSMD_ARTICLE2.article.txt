# Mopedaling to class

### TAMAR SEIVER 
The stereotype of the Stanford
lifestyle virtually takes place on a
moped.
Those college guide books all
rhapsodize about how Stanford

Feature

students zip about the campus on
their mopeds in the warm Califor
nia sun. However, the guides ex
plain that students who simply
pedaled their mopeds like bicycles
were more prevalent than those
who used motor power.
Well, that fad has passed, but

the presence of mopcds and motor
scooters has only increased. This
year, especially, a "moped boom"
has hit the Farm — the sight of
seven or eight red Vivas all parked
together in a line outside the Cor
ner Pocket or west entrance of
Meyer is not uncommon.
Why all of the sudden "moped
madness?" Owners cite many
reasons.
Sophomore Laura Morrow, for
instance, explained that she uses a
moped to get to her off-campus
job because it is cheaper than a
car. She also mentioned her dis
taste for car sickness.
Others need mopeds to get to
campus from their off-campus homes,
like senior Peter Coward did last
year.
Moped lovers also expounded
upon the many advantages of owning
a moped.
The machines are great for getting
around campus, especially if the
driver is adept at dodging the campus
police while riding on the sidewalks.
Parking for a moped or scooter is
always available, on and off campus,
and owners particularly appreciate
this when going to the movies or just
running errands in downtown Palo
Alto.
Furthermore, a moped can handle
a lot more baggage than people think.
Morrow once took a trip and loaded
her Puch with a suitcase, two riders,
and three sleepingbags. At other
times, she has transported scuba gear
and groceries.
However, she and other moped or
scooter owners conceded that owning
a moped has its downside too.
In the rain they suffer. Although
helmets prevent the rain from throw
ing its cold pellets into their faces and
many moped-riders wear two rain
coats, often the water will just sit in
their laps, and on their legs, especially
on scooters. Many moped or scooter
owners wear rain pants to prevent
getting soaked to the bone.
"Bollards are the bane of scooter
drivers," claimed sophomore Dave
Dunshee. Scooters are wider than
bicycles, and so the potential for
losing a few appendages when ap
proaching bollards is constant.

Both moped and scooter drivers
complained that back seat riders
make the obstacle even more perilous
by waving their arms and shouting di
rections at the last minute. Thus it is
even harder for the driver to maintain
balance and navigate down the
middle.
Preferences for mopeds or scooters
often run deep in owners. One owner
of a red Honda Spree expressed his
strong disdain for any other brand of
moped.

Many Stanford
students take their
mopedaling
seriously.

Junior Nicole Freeman, who owns
a powder blue 1963 Vespa 150 and
happily spends much time fixing it up
as if it were an old car, protested
against the "new, cheap and plastic"
Japanese scooters. "I hate them," she
said.
Similarly, the rift between Vespa
enthusiasts and Honda-lovers is a big
one. A senior and a freshman inter
viewed had opposing viewpoints.
The senior extolled the dependa
bility of Hondas and the confidence a
Honda driver has that his scooter will
start faithfully.

The freshman, on the other hand,
sang of the pleasure to be had from
the Vespa's cool status and mystique.
It is a common attitude that the
Vespa scooter is the ideal, the elite, a
collector's item.
According to Todd Pugsley,
manager of the Effortless Bike in
Palo Alto, the very high quality of the
Puch has made it the most popular
moped for a long time. Although this
shop does not sell scooters, he sug
gested that the most popular was the
Honda Spree.
Not everybody, though, sees
mopeds as the wave of the future.
All this hysteria has gone largely
unnoticed by Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons. He was suprised to hear
that there seemed to be more motor
bikes than ever this year and said that
no unusual problems have arisen as a
result.
"Everyone has been very good
about keeping out of the paths desig
nated just for pedestrians," he com
mented. "If anything, there is one less
problem — I sold mine," he said,
noting that "it is quicker to get from
one place to another on a bicycle."
But the definite campus trend is
toward mopeds. More and more of
ten the noisy machines will come
from far behind and pass you on your
bicycle. The billowy clothes and dark
sunglasses will buzz by while you
peddle furiously with elastic rubber
bands around your ankles to save
your pants from grease.
Invariably, you will arrive at class
only to see them calmly and neatly
settled, their pen poised on a clean
sheet of paper — and the top of their
hair standing straight up, as if they
had just stepped out of a wind tunnel.
