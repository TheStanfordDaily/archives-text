## The 						writing on the stalls 
### MARILYN WANN Editorial staff 
There are probably several professors on this campus
who wouldn't believe me when 1 say that the truth about
female sexuality, and women's minds in general, is not to
be found in Freud's writings, but on the bathroom walls in
places like Meyer Library and Tresidder.
Freud himself would probably dismiss me as anal
retentive.
Nonetheless, plenty of women have spent plenty of time
collaborating on this segmented mural of a sort, and al
though 1 didn't find even one mention of Hoover Tower
or the good fellows inside it, I think the statements on reli
gion, money and, yes, sex were humorous and insightful
enough to be worthwhile reading for the male population
around here.
The idea here is to improve understanding between the

sexes — letting taboos break where
they may — by answering the ques
tion from the little guy with the
cigar, "What do women want?"
It isn't an easy thing to find out.
You can maybe guess how silly it
felt standing behind a closed stall
door scribbling down the wise epi
thets clustered around a half-full
roll of toilet paper. I flushed every
once in a while, just to keep the
woman next door from suspecting.
I know what 1 want to do right
now, and that's tell you about my
favorite bits of wall wisdom instead
of trying to concoct another Freud
joke.
On a wall that was otherwise cov
ered with smudged philosophizing,
this refreshingly bold admission:
"Pardon my ignorance, I've never
read Wittgenstein."

Taking courage from its neighbor, this remark sneered,
"Only at Stanford would there be a conversation about
T.S. Eliot in a bathroom stall."
Don't assume that the discourse behind the door
marked "Women" is always so intellectual. One woman
apologized all over the wall about a previous quasi
profundity she had written after spending nine hours on a
Mac, concluding, "I'm feeling faint. I'm going to go now.
If I don't get some food I'll never make it to Flicks!"
Another woman had similarly well-established
priorities when responding to a scrawled "Help!" She
advised, "Go to the Redwoods. Go to the beach. Walk in
the hills behind Stanford. Just DON'T JOG!" That's the
type of wisdom I could live by.
About half the messages were questions. "Why do stu
dents write extensively on the walls during Dead Week?"
Because they don't want to write all those term papers or
study for hours in Meyer's ugly orange chairs, is my guess.
The bathroom walls themselves were a frequent topic:
"I had heard such things about the Meyer bathroom walls.
I'm so disappointed."
Of course, that particular stall had recently been sanded
down to its virginal, grey-painted form, drawing such
comments as "censorship" and the reply, "Yes, we had a
great dialogue about orgasm going on here. Why have you
erased our sexuality? Please let's start again."
A nearby rebuttal pointed out, "They erase so we CAN
start again. That's life." I don't know how much the Uni
versity's housekeeping personnel considers freedom of
speech issues or the cyclical nature of all good things when
patrolling restrooms, but it's a possibility.
Other possibilities to ponder: "Is God dead? Let us first
establish if he ever lived. There cannot be death
without life. Does existence equal life? Does/did God ever
exist?"
None of the answers actually addressed the question.
"What a tired subject," drawled one lazy script. Another
questioned the use of the word, "he," while a third, obvi
ously not a Hum Bio major, proclaimed, "God's coming
and she's pissed."

As the reader soon discovers, this is impossible. "The
urethra closes during orgasm."
So much for religion. The topic is quickly changed to
Dollies.
"Stanford Dollys rule!" proclaims a blue felt tip, to the
general disdain of a serious ball point. "Hate to be the one
to break it to you women (girls?) but the plural of Dolly is
Dollies."
Someone with a blue pen wondered who had written
the first exclamation, maybe a Paly High cheerleader?
Right, perhaps it was one who was in Meyer doing re
search for her home economics class.
Money jokes were a little bitter, too. One woman
wanted to know if anyone had ever heard the joke about
the rich Stanford student, answering her own query,
"Neither have I." Another cynic replied that she had
never heard of a poor one.
One conclusion was that "Being rich must be a Stanford

pre-requisite," while someone else
elaborated, "Owning a PC at Stan
ford is no longer a convenience but
is quickly becoming a necessity."
Now that we've gone through
women's attitudes toward money
and religion, I guess the only other
taboo subject left to talk about is
sex. Although one woman urged,
"Sex is a wonderful thing, but don't
attach too much importance to it,"
the comments about men and the
contributors' attendant relations
therewith easily occupied half the
wall space that I toured.
One amateur surveyor wanted to
know when her peers had lost their
virginity.
One woman replied, advocating a
form of salutary sex. "I think it is
unhealthy for a person not to have
sex before their mid-20s as so many

people seem to get so hung up over sex."
This was a rather moderate viewpoint considering two
nearby comments.
"My God! I thought I was the only virgin on campus!"
exulted one happy abstainer.
Her neighbor, however, sounded like Dr. Ruth Wes
theimer in heat as her rounded scrollwork exhorted, "I
love sex and have had a healthy sex life since age 13.
Relax, be happy and be true to yourself. Do what you
want, not what you think you should do to please others."
Other informal survey results to the question, "What do
you think about 69?" indicated that three out of four
women responded, "YES," the fourth saying, "NO." I
guess that means 75 percent of women think about 69,
huh?
Now we come to my first ethical impasse as a columnist.
I must decide whether or not to make use of a word begin
ning with "112." Yes, that one. Help me out, here; my
Mom's reading this.
Let's just agree to say some other, more innocuous
four-letter transitive verb like "bake," for instance, every
time that other one occurs. Thanks for being so under
standing.
Now then, I'm afraid the comments I found on bath
room walls will not, as I promised, explain all women,
considering the following extreme experiences of sex.
"Is 'baking' a Stanford tradition?" one woman wanted
to know, while another complained, "No, this school is
sadly Platonic. Or am I just missing out?"
One woman's comment was generally recognized as a
universal wisdom, so I'll try to come to a close with it. She
wrote, "True, to 'bake,' to make love and to have sex are
very different things."
But wait, I'm not done yet. Let me play Freud again for
a minute and address the male population at Stanford.
One of the commentators I read wanted to know, "Is the
graffitti in the men's toilet as focused on sex as is ours?"
Well, guys, to paraphrase, "What do you write?"
