## Gung Hay Fat Choy! — Happy Chinese New Year! 
### 
That s a common greeting you 11 be hearing around Chinatown - it means
"wishing you happiness and prosperity."
This Sunday, the festivities begin, marking the beginning of the Chinese calen
dar year 4684 or what is known as "The Year of the Tiger."
In C hina s ancient lunar calendar, every 12 years completes a cycle similar to
the western 12-month Zodiac cycle. Every year symbolizes an animal - the
animal that, according to legend, came forth and honored Buddha at his request.
Each year is also said to embody the spirit of its designated animal. Last year
■was the Year of the Ox. The ox was to bring peace and calm. The animal sym
bolizes hard work, and prosperity was supposed to have come to those who
labored.
This year, according to the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the tiger should
bring strength and courage. The tiger ranks as the king of land beasts in China.
Although the official new year starts at midnight tomorrow, the festival
doesn't begin until Feb. 28.
San Irancisco, the home of the hemisphere's largest Chinese community, will
be the site of the famous Golden Dragon Parade.
Fu, the dragon, will be making his rounds at 7 p.m. on March 8. Thousands
of people will be lining the streets watching the parade. Fu starts his trip at Mar
ket and 2nd Streets, continues down Market to Stockton, Post and Kearney, and
he ends at Columbus and Kearney.
You can't miss this wild occasion, according to the man at the Chinese Cham
ber of Commerce, who also added that it only lasts about two hours.
If you can 7 make the parade, at least celebrate by trying out a new Chinese
restaurant. The three reviews here might give you some ideas.
Again . . . Happy Chinese New Year!
