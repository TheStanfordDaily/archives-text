Recommended activities after
dining at Yuen Yung's include: idle
chatting, relaxation and watching
television. Do not attempt any physi
cal exertion after the pleasurable and
filling experience of dining in this
Chinese restaurant.
Approximately 35 tables occupy
the spacious main dining room at
Yung's, which is attractively
decorated in subtle Chinese decor.
An assortment of families, students
and business types filled the dining
room last Tuesday night. The atmos
phere lends itself best to small group
dining, rather than an intimate dinner
for two.
The extensive menu featured a
wide variety of soups, appetizers and
main dishes, as well as a fine selection
of the chef s specials.
We started with an order of hot
and-sour soup ($4.50), which arrived
promptly. In fact, the service was ex
cellent during the entire meal.
Compared with the hot-and-sour
soup we've had elsewhere, Yung's
was a bit on the thin side, although
the broth was appealingly seasoned.
Next came the "small" assorted hot
plate ($7.95), which actually con
sisted of a very generous selection of
appetizers.
The fried won tons were excellent
— very light and crispy. The rumaki,
liver and water chestnuts, wrapped in
bacon and deep fried, was a new ex
perience for both of us. The unusual
combination of flavors was tasty yet a
bit on the heavy side.
The fried prawns were juicy, yet
unfortunately overshadowed by a
thick and soggy batter. The paper
wrapped chicken garnered our unani
mous approval, however. It was
seasoned with a terryaki-like sauce.
The barbequed spareribs, fortun
ately not smothered in sauce, were

permitted to stand on their own merit
with just a hint of sweet and sour.
Lastly, we found the egg rolls very
flavorful but a tad oily. However, the
best was yet to come.
For main dishes, we eventually
decided upon General Cho's chicken
($7.50), beef with asparagus ($6.95)
and prawns with lobster sauce
($7.50). All three were delivered
steaming hot, appearing almost too
attractive to eat.
General Cho's chef sure knew what
he was doing when he created this ap
petizing dish. The tender chicken
cubes and scallions were sauteed in a
spicy pepper sauce, with a hint of
honey and butter flavor peeking
through. If you like spicy food this is a
must, but watch out for the hidden
red peppers.
The prawns in lobster sauce, served
with onions and green peppers, were
well- prepared, but not particularly
memorable. The prawns were plenti
ful and juicy, and the vegetables
crisp, yet the sauce lacked distinction.
This could be, however, because it
was flanked by two delicious compet
itors.
Our mouths still water when we
recall the taste-bud sensation brought
on by the beef and asparagus.
Cooked in their own natural juices,
the beef was lean and tender and the
asparagus crisp and fresh. It is diffi
cult to conceive of returning to Yuen
Yung's without ordering this dish
again.
Along with our fortune cookies and
doggie bag came a bill for $35 —
quite reasonable, considering the ex
travagant meal we consumed.
To celebrate Chinese New Year, a
special "Tiger Dinner," featuring
bird's nest soup, Mongolian beef and
prawns with candied walnuts, is being
offered for $12.50 per person (for
groups of two or more) until March 2.
"Happy Lunches," including soup,
fried won ton, dim sum and fried or
steamed rice, start at $4.50.
Take-out food is also available. So
whatever your budget, we're confi
dent you can have an enjoyable meal
at Yuen Yung's.
