"Better than most."
This was the comment most often repeated
between mouthfuls of great Chinese food
during dinner at the Grand China Restaurant
last week. My two guests and I didn't say much
else that evening.
Close to campus, the Grand China Restau
rant is located on El Camino Real just beyond
San Antonio Road (in other words, past Tower
Records).
The restaurant's exterior is unimpressive, but
the dining room's decor creates "a touch of
China in the midst of Silicon Valley." Well, sort
of.
If you're looking for "intimate dining,"
Grand China is not your best bet. I did not feel
cramped by all the tables around me, however,
even though nearly every table was occupied
with other victims of "Chinese food
withdrawal."
The service at Grand China is efficient, but
subdued and impersonal. I noticed the waiter
wrote our order in Chinese — this is the real
thing! He seemed baffled by the amount of food
the three of us ordered. But, hey, we were
hungry.
And the food was great. We ordered bean
curd soup, which consisted of tofu and black
fungus (for a little crunch), with egg dropped in.
The soup was hot and tasty, although perhaps a
little bland. My guests made use of some Kik
koman's soy sauce — to give it an extra zip.

Next came the mu shu pork, which was a
fairly typical rendition of that dish. Only four
pancakes were provided to wrap the pork in,
which caused some problems between three
people, since each of us wanted seconds.
The next three dishes earned the enthusiastic
approval of my companions, who until now had
kept up a pleasant conversation about chemistry
and physics.
Szechuan beef was the first "great" dish to
arrive, and it was a very simple one: strips of
beef and green bell peppers with red peppers
and a very spicy sauce. Be warned, however,
this is a hot dish! I revelled in the spiciness,
though, feeling the burning sensation travel
from my tongue to my throat to my ears. 1 rarely
find Szechuan beef in restaurants that is spicy
enough for my tastes. 1 found it at Grand China.
Next came scallops with water chestnuts.
This dish also included some vegetables, one of
which we identified as celery, all covered by a
light, white sauce that had sesame oil in it. This
dish was fantastic and had a surprising number
of scallops, which are usually skimped on in
dishes like this.
The last dish, black mushrooms and cabbage,
served with a white glaze sauce, was pretty
popular with my two dining companions. 1
found it a bit bland, especially after the Szec
huan beef.
Of course, we had steamed rice, which was
the perfect consistency for Chinese food:
slightly sticky and soft. The entire meal came to
$30, which is a great buy considering how much
food we got. A couple could easily get a satisfy
ing meal at Grand China Restaurant for $5 to
$7 each.
I highly recommcnd Grand China Restaurant
for those seeking an inexpensive place to get
Chinese food that's "better than most."
