So, you and your date are all dressed up, you've got the
trusty credit card in pocket, and satiating your hunger is
the foremost thing on your mind.
"Where do you want to eat?"
"Oh, 1 don't know. Let's just head down the 'El' and
find some place new."
"Hey, I've got an idea. Since it's Chinese New Year,
let's eat at Peng's."
When we arrived at Peng's restaurant, we were
promptly greeted by the maitre d', and seated in an ele
gant dining room. We ordered some drinks and glanced at
our surroundings.
The dark, wood-paneled walls were decorated with
gold-inlaid carvings of various birds and beasts. "Musak"
wafted through the air, which was permeated with the tan
talizing smells of garlic and ginger.
The menu at Peng's is quite impressive, featuring over
100 items. All of your standard Chinese favorites are
there: mu shu pork, broccoli with beef, chicken with
snow peas, sweet and sour pork, etc.
An impressive list of specials is also available — such
dishes as Peking beef ("grilled over an open fire until the
skin is crisp and golden") and General Tso's prawns
("flame sauteed" with green peppers in a tangy, hot pep
per sauce). «
And so, as our cocktails arrived, we managed to make
the difficult decision concerning what to order.
The cocktails were most attractively presented, gar
nished with fruit slices and the classic miniature umbrella.
The pina colada was simply yummy, and the Blue Hawaii,
made with vodka, Hawaiian juices and Blue Curacao,
resembled a tasty and colorful vodka sour. But before we
could seriously dent them, our appetizers came.
The pu pu platter (serves two for $7.50) provided us
with the opportunity to sample six different hot items. The
centerpiece consisted of two skewers of terryaki beef,
along with some pineapple and green peppers, sizzling on
a small, flaming grill. It was as good as it sounds, and it
was the single appetizer that we would most recommend.
The fried wonton was saved by the hot mustard sauce.
The fried vegetarian crab looked like crab, but it tasted
like crispy hash browns.
The deep-fried shrimp ball, however, was succulently
juicy and spicy. The sweet and sour spareribs were good,
but we're not rushing a letter home about them. Last, but
certainly not least, was the spring roll. It was excellent —
the filling was flavorful, and the outside was crispy.
Next came our soups: won ton, as well as hot-and-sour
soup with shrimp. If I had to choose between these two, I
would opt for the hot-and-sour soup. The broth of the
won ton soup was a bit overpowering, while the hot-and
sour soup was thick and complex — containing egg. mush
rooms, vegetables, shrimp as well as other unidentifiable
additions one expects in such a soup.
The maitre d' served the next course, shredded chicken
with mandarin pancake ($10.50). Chef Peng must have
been pleased with himself the first time he concocted this
combination of chicken, shredded broccoli and black
mushroom, with a hint of carrot, all sauteed together in a
delicious sauce and rolled into thin pancakes at the table.
Our other main course was the sauteed lobster with
spicy ginger sauce for $12.50. For the first 30 seconds,
after the platter was placed on the table, we both just sat
and stared.
There he sat — the shiny, red lobster — his head intact
and feelers in midair. The rest of the lobster was cut up
into finger-length chunks, and the whole creation was
smothered in a wonderfully exotic, spicy sauce.
As taste goes, the lobster was fantastic— succulent and
juicy. But we had a little trouble getting to the meat
through all the sauce. Wouldn't recommend the dish to
someone wearing white.
The whole bill came to just a little over $40 — 10 per
cent was subtracted for all customers this week to
celebrate the new year.

rooms, vegetables, shrimp as well as other unidentifiable
additions one expects in such a soup.
The maitre d' served the next course, shredded chicken
with mandarin pancake ($10.50). Chef Peng must have
been pleased with himself the first time he concocted this
combination of chicken, shredded broccoli and black
mushroom, with a hint of carrot, all sauteed together in a
delicious sauce and rolled into thin pancakes at the table.
Our other main course was the sauteed lobster with
spicy ginger sauce for $12.50. For the first 30 seconds,
after the platter was placed on the table, we both just sat
and stared.
There he sat — the shiny, red lobster — his head intact
and feelers in midair. The rest of the lobster was cut up
into finger-length chunks, and the whole creation was
smothered in a wonderfully exotic, spicy sauce.
As taste goes, the lobster was fantastic— succulent and
juicy. But we had a little trouble getting to the meat
through all the sauce. Wouldn't recommend the dish to
someone wearing white.
The whole bill came to just a little over $40 — 10 per
cent was subtracted for all customers this week to
celebrate the new year.
