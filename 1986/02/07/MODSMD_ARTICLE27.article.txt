## 'Best' pokes fun at glory days, games 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
"The Best of Times" brings to
gether some of the brightest young
talent in Hollywood, so is it really
a surprise that it's wonderful?
Maybe. These are hard times for
creative filmmakers, particularly
for those interested in comedies
that don't involve Steven Spiel
berg, teenagers or former
"Saturday Night Live" members
acting like teenagers.
It would be easy to see director
Roger Spottiswoode, after the
enormous artistic success and
commercial failure of his "Under
Fire," being shunted into a project
his heart wasn t in, a project where
it would have been easy not to do
his best.
But — perhaps because he's
working with Ron Shelton again
(who wrote "Under Fire"), who
himself is working on a project he
wants to do — both men display
an energy and creativity that we
haven't seen in comedies since last
summer's "Back to the Future."
And like the director and co
writers of that film (Robert
Zemeckis and Bob Gale), it looks
as if, at last, Spottiswoode and
Shelton have a solid commercial
hit.
If "The of Times" isn't as
prodigious an achievement as
"Under Fire," that's the nature of
the material. No doubt Shelton
and Spottiswoode sold this
project to Universal as a football
comedy, and, sure enough, the last
twenty minutes of the movie
features a rowdy, funny game,
complete with slow motion action
and the big, last second play on
which everyone's hopes depend.
But before you blanch at the
prospect of another "Longest
Yard," know that what makes this
movie special is what comes
before the big game. Shelton's ma
terial grew out of his personal ex
periences with the community of
Taft, California, and a certain in
sight into what football might
mean for a small town that is per
petually second best in a high
school rivalry with their larger

neighbor, Bakersfield. The movie
isn't so much about the game of
football as about the psychology
that goes into the game — football
is shown here as the rallying point
for a community, and, by comic
extension, as the be-all and end-all
for one person in that community.
That person is Jack Dundee
(Robin Williams), who dropped a
crucial pass 12 years ago in the
game that could have turned Taft
around after a millenium of being
dumped on (there's a brief, dismal
history of Taft given at the begin
ning of the film). That flubbed
pass has left Jack in spiritual tor
ment; he believes that no one in
Taft has forgotten it — that it
taints everyone's dealings with
him — and he's absolutely right.
The movie is about his, and the
town's, chances for redemption,
through a restaging of the pivotal
1972 game between Taft and
Bakersfield.
One of the central delights of
this movie is in seeing two
filmmakers, who so brilliantly
served up the distinctions, sub
tleties and moral confusion of
Third World revolutions in
"Under Fire," doing the same, al
beit comically, for the psychology
of small-town life in California.
It would be too easy for Spottis
woode and Shelton to focus solely
on the men (as in "The Longest
Yard"), to turn everyone into guf
fawing, beer-commercial bar pa
trons, or to include fewer charac
ters and motivations than they do.
If they did all this, the movie
would still probably be an enor
mous success (perhaps even a big
ger one).
But "The Best of Times" starts
with Jack, his tolerant, no
nonsense wife El ly (Holly
Palance) and his overbearing
father-in-law (Donald Moffat),
and then it keeps adding charac
ters. Soon the filmmakers are jug
gling so many perspectives on life
in Taft that they've created a
living, breathing community —
one with a history, and one with a
mission.
