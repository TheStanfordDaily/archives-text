## 'Best' pokes fun at glory days, games 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
"The Best of Times" brings to
gether some of the brightest young
talent in Hollywood, so is it really
a surprise that it's wonderful?
Maybe. These are hard times for
creative filmmakers, particularly
for those interested in comedies
that don't involve Steven Spiel
berg, teenagers or former
"Saturday Night Live" members
acting like teenagers.
It would be easy to see director
Roger Spottiswoode, after the
enormous artistic success and
commercial failure of his "Under
Fire," being shunted into a project
his heart wasn t in, a project where
it would have been easy not to do
his best.
But — perhaps because he's
working with Ron Shelton again
(who wrote "Under Fire"), who
himself is working on a project he
wants to do — both men display
an energy and creativity that we
haven't seen in comedies since last
summer's "Back to the Future."
And like the director and co
writers of that film (Robert
Zemeckis and Bob Gale), it looks
as if, at last, Spottiswoode and
Shelton have a solid commercial
hit.
If "The of Times" isn't as
prodigious an achievement as
"Under Fire," that's the nature of
the material. No doubt Shelton
and Spottiswoode sold this
project to Universal as a football
comedy, and, sure enough, the last
twenty minutes of the movie
features a rowdy, funny game,
complete with slow motion action
and the big, last second play on
which everyone's hopes depend.
But before you blanch at the
prospect of another "Longest
Yard," know that what makes this
movie special is what comes
before the big game. Shelton's ma
terial grew out of his personal ex
periences with the community of
Taft, California, and a certain in
sight into what football might
mean for a small town that is per
petually second best in a high
school rivalry with their larger

neighbor, Bakersfield. The movie
isn't so much about the game of
football as about the psychology
that goes into the game — football
is shown here as the rallying point
for a community, and, by comic
extension, as the be-all and end-all
for one person in that community.
That person is Jack Dundee
(Robin Williams), who dropped a
crucial pass 12 years ago in the
game that could have turned Taft
around after a millenium of being
dumped on (there's a brief, dismal
history of Taft given at the begin
ning of the film). That flubbed
pass has left Jack in spiritual tor
ment; he believes that no one in
Taft has forgotten it — that it
taints everyone's dealings with
him — and he's absolutely right.
The movie is about his, and the
town's, chances for redemption,
through a restaging of the pivotal
1972 game between Taft and
Bakersfield.
One of the central delights of
this movie is in seeing two
filmmakers, who so brilliantly
served up the distinctions, sub
tleties and moral confusion of
Third World revolutions in
"Under Fire," doing the same, al
beit comically, for the psychology
of small-town life in California.
It would be too easy for Spottis
woode and Shelton to focus solely
on the men (as in "The Longest
Yard"), to turn everyone into guf
fawing, beer-commercial bar pa
trons, or to include fewer charac
ters and motivations than they do.
If they did all this, the movie
would still probably be an enor
mous success (perhaps even a big
ger one).
But "The Best of Times" starts
with Jack, his tolerant, no
nonsense wife El ly (Holly
Palance) and his overbearing
father-in-law (Donald Moffat),
and then it keeps adding charac
ters. Soon the filmmakers are jug
gling so many perspectives on life
in Taft that they've created a
living, breathing community —
one with a history, and one with a
mission.
There's more than a hint of plain
ness and predictability in the ma
terial. We get the town hooker (an
en 6 a ging Margaret Whitton), we get
a comical men's lodge club, we get
new wave brats who don't connect
with their parents (or anything else).
But Shelton throws us a curve by
making it all seem funny and fresh
and (surprise!) human. To find better
comic dialogue — dialogue that
humanizes the characters at the same
time it gets a laugh — one would have
to go all the way back to Preston
Sturges (especially the Sturges of
"Miracle of Morgan's Creek," which
was set in a town much like Taft).
There's a lot of Sturges' influence
in this film; Shelton perfectly
captures his uncanny combination of
warmth and satiric bite, and, as
Sturges used to, the filmmakers have
cast actors who each have a distinc
tive physical presence and style. Yet,
despite the fact that the performers
make an immediate impression, we
grow into the characters they're
portraying. They don't leap out and
bombard us with instant schtick.
Williams is playing a role which
makes fewer creative demands on
him than his character in "Moscow on
the Hudson," but he doesn't let his
four-square, three-piece suit-and-tie
image hold him back. Jack Dundee is
in a spiritual trap; the attitudes and
values of an entire community have
him in a vise, and when Taft's resi
dents make off-hand references to his
ultimate failure, you can see hiin
flinch.
Williams' glasses seem to empha
size the broad squishiness of his face,
as if this mental burden were weigh

ing on him and squashing his head.
And though Williams is by far the
most wildly improvisational actor in
this movie, he doesn't hog the screen
with his talent. He subsumes his own
comic persona (though not to the ex
tent he did in "The World According
to Garp" and "Hudson") by channel
ing his manic energies into Jack's
obsession.

Jack is a straight-laced, intelligent
guy who just has one demon — but
it's a whopper. He sits in his office
playing and replaying the videotape
of his blooper, and he continually
refers to the "demon ball-carriers of
the past." Jack combines single
mindedness with verbosity (at one
point, he spins a million meaningless
wil.itions on the topic of the Middle

East as a swamp), yet Williams some
how manages to make this combina
tion funny.
The one, unavoidable mistake the
material requires is that he play the
last 20 minutes in football gear, and
that's a strait-jacket on Williams'
creativity. It turns him into just an
other indistinguishable, bulky clown.
It's a little demeaning to see Robin

Williams rolling in the mud like any
other ex-jock turned movie star.
If Kurt Russell were any less of a
performer, his role would shrivel next
to Williams'. As Reno Hightower,
Russell looks a little too fit to play an
ex-football hero gone to seed, and the
filmmakers don't give him comic
zingers to match Williams. But Rus
ssell's timing and delivery were honed

as a teenager in a dozen Disney
movies, and perfected in his only
other comedy, "Used Cars" (in which
he obliterated his Disney image with
a burst of vulgar comic energy).
Reno is a slobby romantic; he
paints impressionist art on the sides
of vans, and loves his wife, Gigi
(Pamela Reed), in a very off-hand
way. He's casual and sincere, and just
wants to be left alone. He's a nice
guy. So near the end, when he turns
into a jerk of a football stud in the big
game, the transformation is a
hilarious reminder that the glory days
may have been more insufferable
than we remember.
At a time when movies are again
selling contact sports as the modern
test of a man's mettle (" Youngblood"
is only the latest example), it's
refreshing to see a female perspective
on this foolishness. "The Best of
Times" also stars Reed, who as a
comedienne has a controlled wacki
ness — she's like a rational Goldie
Hawn. She and Palance's Elly (who is
the most down-to-earth of the bunch,
and therefore, perhaps, also the least
interesting) deal with their husbands'
obsessions with frankness and a kind
of lived-in dismay.
They have no idea how these
boy/men can keep living in the past,
but at the same time, they aren't
above their husbands' rather attrac
tive craziness. When they call them
"phony-virile macho poseurs,"
there's a trace of admiration in their
scorn (though it's for the men's
bodies, not their sensibility).
"The Best of Times" is about the
attractiveness of a distant past. The
joke is that the people of Taft never
had that past, but they can still
celebrate the fact that they almost did
— once.

father-in-law (Donald Moffat),
and then it keeps adding charac
ters. Soon the filmmakers are jug
gling so many perspectives on life
in Taft that they've created a
living, breathing community —
one with a history, and one with a
mission.
There's more than a hint of plain
ness and predictability in the ma
terial. We get the town hooker (an
en 6 a ging Margaret Whitton), we get
a comical men's lodge club, we get
new wave brats who don't connect
with their parents (or anything else).
But Shelton throws us a curve by
making it all seem funny and fresh
and (surprise!) human. To find better
comic dialogue — dialogue that
humanizes the characters at the same
time it gets a laugh — one would have
to go all the way back to Preston
Sturges (especially the Sturges of
"Miracle of Morgan's Creek," which
was set in a town much like Taft).
There's a lot of Sturges' influence
in this film; Shelton perfectly
captures his uncanny combination of
warmth and satiric bite, and, as
Sturges used to, the filmmakers have
cast actors who each have a distinc
tive physical presence and style. Yet,
despite the fact that the performers
make an immediate impression, we
grow into the characters they're
portraying. They don't leap out and
bombard us with instant schtick.
Williams is playing a role which
makes fewer creative demands on
him than his character in "Moscow on
the Hudson," but he doesn't let his
four-square, three-piece suit-and-tie
image hold him back. Jack Dundee is
in a spiritual trap; the attitudes and
values of an entire community have
him in a vise, and when Taft's resi
dents make off-hand references to his
ultimate failure, you can see hiin
flinch.
Williams' glasses seem to empha
size the broad squishiness of his face,
as if this mental burden were weigh

ing on him and squashing his head.
And though Williams is by far the
most wildly improvisational actor in
this movie, he doesn't hog the screen
with his talent. He subsumes his own
comic persona (though not to the ex
tent he did in "The World According
to Garp" and "Hudson") by channel
ing his manic energies into Jack's
obsession.

Jack is a straight-laced, intelligent
guy who just has one demon — but
it's a whopper. He sits in his office
playing and replaying the videotape
of his blooper, and he continually
refers to the "demon ball-carriers of
the past." Jack combines single
mindedness with verbosity (at one
point, he spins a million meaningless
wil.itions on the topic of the Middle

East as a swamp), yet Williams some
how manages to make this combina
tion funny.
The one, unavoidable mistake the
material requires is that he play the
last 20 minutes in football gear, and
that's a strait-jacket on Williams'
creativity. It turns him into just an
other indistinguishable, bulky clown.
It's a little demeaning to see Robin

Williams rolling in the mud like any
other ex-jock turned movie star.
If Kurt Russell were any less of a
performer, his role would shrivel next
to Williams'. As Reno Hightower,
Russell looks a little too fit to play an
ex-football hero gone to seed, and the
filmmakers don't give him comic
zingers to match Williams. But Rus
ssell's timing and delivery were honed

as a teenager in a dozen Disney
movies, and perfected in his only
other comedy, "Used Cars" (in which
he obliterated his Disney image with
a burst of vulgar comic energy).
Reno is a slobby romantic; he
paints impressionist art on the sides
of vans, and loves his wife, Gigi
(Pamela Reed), in a very off-hand
way. He's casual and sincere, and just
wants to be left alone. He's a nice
guy. So near the end, when he turns
into a jerk of a football stud in the big
game, the transformation is a
hilarious reminder that the glory days
may have been more insufferable
than we remember.
At a time when movies are again
selling contact sports as the modern
test of a man's mettle (" Youngblood"
is only the latest example), it's
refreshing to see a female perspective
on this foolishness. "The Best of
Times" also stars Reed, who as a
comedienne has a controlled wacki
ness — she's like a rational Goldie
Hawn. She and Palance's Elly (who is
the most down-to-earth of the bunch,
and therefore, perhaps, also the least
interesting) deal with their husbands'
obsessions with frankness and a kind
of lived-in dismay.
They have no idea how these
boy/men can keep living in the past,
but at the same time, they aren't
above their husbands' rather attrac
tive craziness. When they call them
"phony-virile macho poseurs,"
there's a trace of admiration in their
scorn (though it's for the men's
bodies, not their sensibility).
"The Best of Times" is about the
attractiveness of a distant past. The
joke is that the people of Taft never
had that past, but they can still
celebrate the fact that they almost did
— once.

edy about a football player with an obsession — redeeming a flub he
made in a game a decade ago.
"The Best of Times" brings to
gether some of the brightest young
talent in Hollywood, so is it really
a surprise that it's wonderful?
Maybe. These are hard times for
creative filmmakers, particularly
for those interested in comedies
that don't involve Steven Spiel
berg, teenagers or former
"Saturday Night Live" members
acting like teenagers.
It would be easy to see director
Roger Spottiswoode, after the
enormous artistic success and
commercial failure of his "Under
Fire," being shunted into a project
his heart wasn t in, a project where
it would have been easy not to do
his best.
But — perhaps because he's
working with Ron Shelton again
(who wrote "Under Fire"), who
himself is working on a project he
wants to do — both men display
an energy and creativity that we
haven't seen in comedies since last
summer's "Back to the Future."
And like the director and co
writers of that film (Robert
Zemeckis and Bob Gale), it looks
as if, at last, Spottiswoode and
Shelton have a solid commercial
hit.
If "The of Times" isn't as
prodigious an achievement as
"Under Fire," that's the nature of
the material. No doubt Shelton
and Spottiswoode sold this
project to Universal as a football
comedy, and, sure enough, the last
twenty minutes of the movie
features a rowdy, funny game,
complete with slow motion action
and the big, last second play on
which everyone's hopes depend.
But before you blanch at the
prospect of another "Longest
Yard," know that what makes this
movie special is what comes
before the big game. Shelton's ma
terial grew out of his personal ex
periences with the community of
Taft, California, and a certain in
sight into what football might
mean for a small town that is per
petually second best in a high
school rivalry with their larger

neighbor, Bakersfield. The movie
isn't so much about the game of
football as about the psychology
that goes into the game — football
is shown here as the rallying point
for a community, and, by comic
extension, as the be-all and end-all
for one person in that community.
That person is Jack Dundee
(Robin Williams), who dropped a
crucial pass 12 years ago in the
game that could have turned Taft
around after a millenium of being
dumped on (there's a brief, dismal
history of Taft given at the begin
ning of the film). That flubbed
pass has left Jack in spiritual tor
ment; he believes that no one in
Taft has forgotten it — that it
taints everyone's dealings with
him — and he's absolutely right.
The movie is about his, and the
town's, chances for redemption,
through a restaging of the pivotal
1972 game between Taft and
Bakersfield.
One of the central delights of
this movie is in seeing two
filmmakers, who so brilliantly
served up the distinctions, sub
tleties and moral confusion of
Third World revolutions in
"Under Fire," doing the same, al
beit comically, for the psychology
of small-town life in California.
It would be too easy for Spottis
woode and Shelton to focus solely
on the men (as in "The Longest
Yard"), to turn everyone into guf
fawing, beer-commercial bar pa
trons, or to include fewer charac
ters and motivations than they do.
If they did all this, the movie
would still probably be an enor
mous success (perhaps even a big
ger one).
But "The Best of Times" starts
with Jack, his tolerant, no
nonsense wife El ly (Holly
Palance) and his overbearing
father-in-law (Donald Moffat),
and then it keeps adding charac

of vans, and loves his wife, Gigi
(Pamela Reed), in a very off-hand
way. He's casual and sincere, and just
wants to be left alone. He's a nice
guy. So near the end, when he turns
into a jerk of a football stud in the big
game, the transformation is a
hilarious reminder that the glory days
may have been more insufferable
than we remember.
At a time when movies are again
selling contact sports as the modern
test of a man's mettle (" Youngblood"
is only the latest example), it's
refreshing to see a female perspective
on this foolishness. "The Best of
Times" also stars Reed, who as a
comedienne has a controlled wacki
ness — she's like a rational Goldie
Hawn. She and Palance's Elly (who is
the most down-to-earth of the bunch,
and therefore, perhaps, also the least
interesting) deal with their husbands'
obsessions with frankness and a kind
of lived-in dismay.
They have no idea how these
boy/men can keep living in the past,
but at the same time, they aren't
above their husbands' rather attrac
tive craziness. When they call them
"phony-virile macho poseurs,"
there's a trace of admiration in their
scorn (though it's for the men's
bodies, not their sensibility).
"The Best of Times" is about the
attractiveness of a distant past. The
joke is that the people of Taft never
had that past, but they can still
celebrate the fact that they almost did
— once.

edy about a football player with an obsession — redeeming a flub he
made in a game a decade ago.
"The Best of Times" brings to
gether some of the brightest young
talent in Hollywood, so is it really
a surprise that it's wonderful?
Maybe. These are hard times for
creative filmmakers, particularly
for those interested in comedies
that don't involve Steven Spiel
berg, teenagers or former
"Saturday Night Live" members
acting like teenagers.
It would be easy to see director
Roger Spottiswoode, after the
enormous artistic success and
commercial failure of his "Under
Fire," being shunted into a project
his heart wasn t in, a project where
it would have been easy not to do
his best.
But — perhaps because he's
working with Ron Shelton again
(who wrote "Under Fire"), who
himself is working on a project he
wants to do — both men display
an energy and creativity that we
haven't seen in comedies since last
summer's "Back to the Future."
And like the director and co
writers of that film (Robert
Zemeckis and Bob Gale), it looks
as if, at last, Spottiswoode and
Shelton have a solid commercial
hit.
If "The of Times" isn't as
prodigious an achievement as
"Under Fire," that's the nature of
the material. No doubt Shelton
and Spottiswoode sold this
project to Universal as a football
comedy, and, sure enough, the last
twenty minutes of the movie
features a rowdy, funny game,
complete with slow motion action
and the big, last second play on
which everyone's hopes depend.
But before you blanch at the
prospect of another "Longest
Yard," know that what makes this
movie special is what comes
before the big game. Shelton's ma
terial grew out of his personal ex
periences with the community of
Taft, California, and a certain in
sight into what football might
mean for a small town that is per
petually second best in a high
school rivalry with their larger

neighbor, Bakersfield. The movie
isn't so much about the game of
football as about the psychology
that goes into the game — football
is shown here as the rallying point
for a community, and, by comic
extension, as the be-all and end-all
for one person in that community.
That person is Jack Dundee
(Robin Williams), who dropped a
crucial pass 12 years ago in the
game that could have turned Taft
around after a millenium of being
dumped on (there's a brief, dismal
history of Taft given at the begin
ning of the film). That flubbed
pass has left Jack in spiritual tor
ment; he believes that no one in
Taft has forgotten it — that it
taints everyone's dealings with
him — and he's absolutely right.
The movie is about his, and the
town's, chances for redemption,
through a restaging of the pivotal
1972 game between Taft and
Bakersfield.
One of the central delights of
this movie is in seeing two
filmmakers, who so brilliantly
served up the distinctions, sub
tleties and moral confusion of
Third World revolutions in
"Under Fire," doing the same, al
beit comically, for the psychology
of small-town life in California.
It would be too easy for Spottis
woode and Shelton to focus solely
on the men (as in "The Longest
Yard"), to turn everyone into guf
fawing, beer-commercial bar pa
trons, or to include fewer charac
ters and motivations than they do.
If they did all this, the movie
would still probably be an enor
mous success (perhaps even a big
ger one).
But "The Best of Times" starts
with Jack, his tolerant, no
nonsense wife El ly (Holly
Palance) and his overbearing
father-in-law (Donald Moffat),
and then it keeps adding charac
ters. Soon the filmmakers are jug
gling so many perspectives on life
in Taft that they've created a
living, breathing community —
one with a history, and one with a
mission.
There's more than a hint of plain
ness and predictability in the ma
terial. We get the town hooker (an
en 6 a ging Margaret Whitton), we get
a comical men's lodge club, we get
new wave brats who don't connect
with their parents (or anything else).
But Shelton throws us a curve by
making it all seem funny and fresh
and (surprise!) human. To find better
comic dialogue — dialogue that
humanizes the characters at the same
time it gets a laugh — one would have
to go all the way back to Preston
Sturges (especially the Sturges of
"Miracle of Morgan's Creek," which
was set in a town much like Taft).
There's a lot of Sturges' influence
in this film; Shelton perfectly
captures his uncanny combination of
warmth and satiric bite, and, as
Sturges used to, the filmmakers have
cast actors who each have a distinc
tive physical presence and style. Yet,
despite the fact that the performers
make an immediate impression, we
grow into the characters they're
portraying. They don't leap out and
bombard us with instant schtick.
Williams is playing a role which
makes fewer creative demands on
him than his character in "Moscow on
the Hudson," but he doesn't let his
four-square, three-piece suit-and-tie
image hold him back. Jack Dundee is
in a spiritual trap; the attitudes and
values of an entire community have
him in a vise, and when Taft's resi
dents make off-hand references to his
ultimate failure, you can see hiin
flinch.
Williams' glasses seem to empha
size the broad squishiness of his face,
as if this mental burden were weigh

ing on him and squashing his head.
And though Williams is by far the
most wildly improvisational actor in
this movie, he doesn't hog the screen
with his talent. He subsumes his own
comic persona (though not to the ex
tent he did in "The World According
to Garp" and "Hudson") by channel
ing his manic energies into Jack's
obsession.

Jack is a straight-laced, intelligent
guy who just has one demon — but
it's a whopper. He sits in his office
playing and replaying the videotape
of his blooper, and he continually
refers to the "demon ball-carriers of
the past." Jack combines single
mindedness with verbosity (at one
point, he spins a million meaningless
wil.itions on the topic of the Middle

East as a swamp), yet Williams some
how manages to make this combina
tion funny.
The one, unavoidable mistake the
material requires is that he play the
last 20 minutes in football gear, and
that's a strait-jacket on Williams'
creativity. It turns him into just an
other indistinguishable, bulky clown.
It's a little demeaning to see Robin

Williams rolling in the mud like any
other ex-jock turned movie star.
If Kurt Russell were any less of a
performer, his role would shrivel next
to Williams'. As Reno Hightower,
Russell looks a little too fit to play an
ex-football hero gone to seed, and the
filmmakers don't give him comic
zingers to match Williams. But Rus
ssell's timing and delivery were honed

as a teenager in a dozen Disney
movies, and perfected in his only
other comedy, "Used Cars" (in which
he obliterated his Disney image with
a burst of vulgar comic energy).
Reno is a slobby romantic; he
paints impressionist art on the sides
of vans, and loves his wife, Gigi
(Pamela Reed), in a very off-hand
way. He's casual and sincere, and just
wants to be left alone. He's a nice
guy. So near the end, when he turns
into a jerk of a football stud in the big
game, the transformation is a
hilarious reminder that the glory days
may have been more insufferable
than we remember.
At a time when movies are again
selling contact sports as the modern
test of a man's mettle (" Youngblood"
is only the latest example), it's
