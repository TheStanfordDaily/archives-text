# Oscar nominations yield surprises
## 
### JAMES LUJAN Editorial staff 
As you no doubt have heard, the
nominations for the 1985 Academy
Awards were announced Wednesday.
The Oscars have traditionally been
revered as the most honored symbols
in the entertainment industry. Al
though every year is saturated by
"best" awards from motley organiza
tions, the Oscars have the distinction
of standing tall as the most pres
tigious barometer of quality in the
performing arts world.
For the most part, the Academy

usually makes pretty decent selec
tions. However, the members are
human, and they can have their ob
jectivity compromised by various so
cial, political and economic factors.
As a result, it's important to be aware
of the fact that the Academy does not
have the last word on quality. Just be
cause the Academy votes a movie as
best picture, it obviously doesn't
mean that it is the best picture.
Even though the Academy may not
be a barometer of objectivity, the
awards are attentively watched by the
moviegoing public. With all this in
mind, let's take a look at a few of this
year's nominations.
Let's begin with the nominations
for best directing. The biggest
surprise, this year, came not from

who was nominated but from who
was omitted — namely, Steven Spiel
berg for his work in "The Color
Purple." In all, "The Color Purple"
scored 11 nominations, including best
picture. How it could do all this and
not even net a directing nod is a mys
tery indeed. It almost seems as if
Spielberg was deliberately snubbed.
In all fairness, the directors who
were nominated are all respectable
choices. As the director of such clas
sics as "The Maltese Falcon" and
"The African Queen," John Huston
has had a long, distinguished career,
and with his work in "Prizzi's

Honor," he shows no signs of slowing
down. Huston's toughest competitor
seems to be Sydney Pollack for his
monumental achievement in "Out of
Africa." Pollack, who also was re
sponsible for "Tootsie," is very suc
cessful in creating an intimate
romance in front of the sprawling
backdrop of Africa; his nomination is
well deserved.
Australian director Peter Weir was
understandably recognized for his su
perb accomplishment in "Witness."
In this film. Weir proves himself to be
a master of the detective thriller, suc
cessfully combining elements of
suspense and romance in the setting
of Amish country.
Out of all the directing nomina
tions, perhaps the most pleasing is to

see Akiro Kurosawa given the nod
for "Ran," his King Lear-based epic.
The surprise nominee this year is Ar
gentine Hector Babenco for "Kiss of
the Spider Woman." Although
Babenco did a thoroughly competent
job, Spielberg arguably deserved the
nomination more. Apparently, the
Director's Guild of America agrees.
Their nominations this year, in addi
tion to Spielberg, are Huston, Weir,
Pollack and Ron Howard for
"Cocoon." If Spielberg happens to
win, it will be the first time in Guild
history that a Director's Guild winner
failed even to be nominated for an

Oscar.
Anjelica Huston — looking to
team up with her father John in what
could be an Oscar family sweep — is
heading the list for best supporting
actress. Her wickedly funny perfor
mance in "Prizzi's Honor" has
already won her several prizes and
she seems to be the best bet for the
Oscar. Her stiffest competition is
coming from Oprah Winfrey for her
powerful showing in "The Color
Purple." Winfrey's portrayal of an
iron-willed black woman was one of
the best aspects of the movie. Mar
garet Avery scored another best
actress nod for "The Color Purple"
for her sensitive performance.
Nominee Amy Madigan's perfor
mance in "Twice in a Lifetime" was

one of the more notable elements in
an otherwise one-note movie. It was a
good piece of acting, but not good
enough to deserve a nomination. It
got one, anyway. The final nominee is
Meg Tilly for "Agnes of God." She
recently won a Golden Globe for her
performance, though some people
aren't sure why. It was a stagey per
formance in an even more stagey
film. All in all, Anjelica Huston looks
to be the heavy favorite to win her
first Oscar.
The race for best supporting actor
is a bit more interesting. Klaus Maria
Brandauer of "Out of Africa" is the

front runner here. He has already
won almost every award imaginable
for his potrayal as Meryl Streep's
seedy, unfaithful yet sympathetic hus
band. But William Hickey is another
favorite for his wonderfully raspy role
as an aging mafia boss in "Prizzi's
Honor." Also receiving a deserved
nomination is Don Ameche for his
lively appearance in "Cocoon."
One surprise nomination was
Robert Loggia for "Jagged Edge."
and another went to Eric Roberts of
"Runaway Train." Roberts' perfor
mance was at times frenetic, loud
mouthed and grating. Even more sur
prising was that the Academy ignored
Christopher Lloyd's winning charac

terization in "Back To The Future."
The most suspenseful race, as usual, is the
best actress category. Actually, it's not really
that suspenseful. Meryl Streep is the clear-cut
winner for "Out of Africa." They should just
retire the trophy in her name until she stops
making movies. In "Out of Africa," she
proves she can master any foreign accent she
wants and she does it superbly. If Streep is to
be upset, it will probably be by Geraldine
Page for "The Trip to Bountiful." Page has
been up for Oscars seven times before, and
this may be the time that the Academy
decides to recognize her for her long, distin
guished career.
Another potential upset candidate is
Whoopi Goldberg for her unforgettable film
debut as Celie in "The Color Purple." Al
though Jessica Lange was quite good as Patsy
Cline in "Sweet Dreams," she really doesn't
stand a chance against her aforementioned

competition. The other nominee is Anne
Bancroft for "Agnes of God;" she has been
much better. The surprise omission is Cher
for her work in "Mask."
The two leaders of the pack for the best ac-

Actually, (the race for the best actress Oscar isn't) really that
suspenseful. Meryl Streep is the clear-cut winner for 'Out of Africa.'

tor Oscar are William Hurt for "Kiss of the
Spider Woman" and Jack Nicholson for
"Prizzi's Honor." Cannes and the L.A. Film
Critics have already bestowed honors upon

Hurt for his marvelous performance as a
homosexual prisoner who expresses himself
through the old movies he admires. In turn,
Nicholson has been singled out by the New
York Critics and the Hollywood Foreign

Press (Golden Globes) for his wonderfully
goofy performance as a mafia hit man.
Nicholson should be the pick here. Al
though its not his best performance, it's his

most daring and Nicholson pulls it off success
fully. Other pleasing nods went Harrison
Ford, who was recognized for his strong, low
key performance in "Witness," and Jon
Voight, nominated for his atypical, daring

though overacted role in "Runaway Train."
The big surprise nomination came from James
Garner for "Murphy's Romance." All in all, it
was kind of a dry year for lead actors, so there

weren't any real suprise omissions in this cate
gory.
This year's Academy Award nominations
for best picture have pretty much been men
tioned already: "The Color Purple," "Kiss of
the Spider Woman," "Out of Africa,"
"Prizzi s Honor" and "Witness." The surprise
nomination this year is "Kiss." It's to the
Academy's credit that they had the guts to
nominate a foreign film over a box office fa
vorite like "Back To The Future."
The three front runners appear to be "The
Color Purple," "Out of Africa" and "Prizzi's
Honor." The lack of a directing nomination
has crippled Spielberg's film chance of win
ning, and although it is a superb effort, "Out
of Africa" is much too long and plodding to
win the Oscar. Although "The Color Purple"
should win, chances are "Prizzi's Honor" will
instead.
Perhaps the best movie of all, but it doesn't
stand a chance of winning, is "Witness."
The 58th Academy Awards presentation
will be televised from the stage of the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on March 24. Be
sure to place all your bets before then.
