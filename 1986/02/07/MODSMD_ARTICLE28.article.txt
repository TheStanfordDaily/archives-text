# Oscar nominations yield surprises

As you no doubt have heard, the
nominations for the 1985 Academy
Awards were announced Wednesday.
The Oscars have traditionally been
revered as the most honored symbols
in the entertainment industry. Al
though every year is saturated by
"best" awards from motley organiza
tions, the Oscars have the distinction
of standing tall as the most pres
tigious barometer of quality in the
performing arts world.
For the most part, the Academy

usually makes pretty decent selec
tions. However, the members are
human, and they can have their ob
jectivity compromised by various so
cial, political and economic factors.
As a result, it's important to be aware
of the fact that the Academy does not
have the last word on quality. Just be
cause the Academy votes a movie as
best picture, it obviously doesn't
mean that it is the best picture.
Even though the Academy may not
be a barometer of objectivity, the
awards are attentively watched by the
moviegoing public. With all this in
mind, let's take a look at a few of this
year's nominations.
Let's begin with the nominations
for best directing. The biggest
surprise, this year, came not from

who was nominated but from who
was omitted — namely, Steven Spiel
berg for his work in "The Color
Purple." In all, "The Color Purple"
scored 11 nominations, including best
picture. How it could do all this and
not even net a directing nod is a mys
tery indeed. It almost seems as if
Spielberg was deliberately snubbed.
In all fairness, the directors who
were nominated are all respectable
choices. As the director of such clas
sics as "The Maltese Falcon" and
"The African Queen," John Huston
has had a long, distinguished career,
and with his work in "Prizzi's

Honor," he shows no signs of slowing
down. Huston's toughest competitor
seems to be Sydney Pollack for his
monumental achievement in "Out of
Africa." Pollack, who also was re
sponsible for "Tootsie," is very suc
cessful in creating an intimate
romance in front of the sprawling
backdrop of Africa; his nomination is
well deserved.
Australian director Peter Weir was
understandably recognized for his su
perb accomplishment in "Witness."
In this film. Weir proves himself to be
a master of the detective thriller, suc
cessfully combining elements of
suspense and romance in the setting
of Amish country.
Out of all the directing nomina
tions, perhaps the most pleasing is to

see Akiro Kurosawa given the nod
for "Ran," his King Lear-based epic.
The surprise nominee this year is Ar
gentine Hector Babenco for "Kiss of
the Spider Woman." Although
Babenco did a thoroughly competent
job, Spielberg arguably deserved the
nomination more. Apparently, the
Director's Guild of America agrees.
Their nominations this year, in addi
tion to Spielberg, are Huston, Weir,
Pollack and Ron Howard for
"Cocoon." If Spielberg happens to
win, it will be the first time in Guild
history that a Director's Guild winner
failed even to be nominated for an

Oscar.
Anjelica Huston — looking to
team up with her father John in what
could be an Oscar family sweep — is
heading the list for best supporting
actress. Her wickedly funny perfor
mance in "Prizzi's Honor" has
already won her several prizes and
she seems to be the best bet for the
Oscar. Her stiffest competition is
coming from Oprah Winfrey for her
powerful showing in "The Color
Purple." Winfrey's portrayal of an
iron-willed black woman was one of
the best aspects of the movie. Mar
garet Avery scored another best
actress nod for "The Color Purple"
for her sensitive performance.
Nominee Amy Madigan's perfor
mance in "Twice in a Lifetime" was

one of the more notable elements in
an otherwise one-note movie. It was a
good piece of acting, but not good
enough to deserve a nomination. It
got one, anyway. The final nominee is
Meg Tilly for "Agnes of God." She
recently won a Golden Globe for her
performance, though some people
aren't sure why. It was a stagey per
formance in an even more stagey
film. All in all, Anjelica Huston looks
to be the heavy favorite to win her
first Oscar.
The race for best supporting actor
is a bit more interesting. Klaus Maria
Brandauer of "Out of Africa" is the

front runner here. He has already
won almost every award imaginable
for his potrayal as Meryl Streep's
seedy, unfaithful yet sympathetic hus
band. But William Hickey is another
favorite for his wonderfully raspy role
as an aging mafia boss in "Prizzi's
Honor." Also receiving a deserved
nomination is Don Ameche for his
lively appearance in "Cocoon."
One surprise nomination was
Robert Loggia for "Jagged Edge."
and another went to Eric Roberts of
"Runaway Train." Roberts' perfor
mance was at times frenetic, loud
mouthed and grating. Even more sur
prising was that the Academy ignored
Christopher Lloyd's winning charac
