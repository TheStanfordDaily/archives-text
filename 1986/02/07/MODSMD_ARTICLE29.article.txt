The Home and the World (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Personal revolution in the lives of
the characters mirrors a national
uprising against British cultural im
perialism. in acclaimed Indian direc
tor Satyajit Ray's wonderful movie.
Ray uses his characters and their
private dialogues to illustrate the
differing factions and principles in
the Swadeshi movement — a revo
lution attempting to restrict the sale
of foreign goods in Bengal. But Ray
never turns his people into mere
spokesmen for causes. In a style that
might be described as painterly, Rav
creates characters in which gentle
warmth, passion and understanding
combine to form fully imagined
human beings. Revolutionary San
dip (Soumitra Chatterjee),
maharajah Nikhil (Victor Banjeree.

of "A Passage to India") and his
wife Bimala (Swatilekha Chatter
jee) play out the confilcts between
intuition and education, tradition
and revolution, and they display
varying degrees of depth, in accor
dance with Ray's sympathy to their
ideas and beliefs. Banjeree's Nikhil
radiates an almost mystical intelli
gence, which suffuses his wife as she
listens to him; it's quite different
from the fiery passion of Sandip,
and these two men and their power
ful personalities pull on her emerg
ing political consciousness. The
relationships, and their expansion
into a metaphor for the needs of a
delicate, deeply traditional culture
like India's, are beautifully ren
dered. With subtitles.
Plays Sunday through Tuesday
with "Heat and Dust."
Z(1969)
La Maison Francaise
"Z" opens with the opposite of a
disclaimer; words on the screen an
nounce that any resemblence of the
following people and events to ac
tual people and events is absolutely
intentional. This movie, directed by
Greek exile Costa-Gavras and
scripted by Spanish writer Jorge
Semprun (from a book by Vassili
Vassilikos), is based on the political
assassination of the anti-fascist peace
spokesman Gregorios Lambakis in
Salonika in 1965, and it's a perfect
example of what happens when a
major artist devotes every ounce of
his skill and energy to honing a com
pelling piece of political

propaganda. The movie is en
gineered to indict the supremely
corrupt fascist regime that became
entrenched in Greece in 1967, and
though there have been faster, more
violent thrillers since "Z," none
have been propelled by the same
degree of moral urgency and convic
tion. Whatever your feelings about
its blatant and extremely effective
efforts to sell its political point of
view, it's still a hell of a movie, and it
makes Costa-Gavras's more recent,
much acclaimed "Missing" look
anemic.

Love and Death (1975)
Cubberley Auditorium
This is a funny Woody Allen
movie, but its snob appeal is a put
off; you can't help being conscious
of the bewilderment of moviegoers
not aware of the references to Dos
toevsky, Chekhov and Tolstoy in
many of Allen's jokes. This is the
closest film equilalent to a play like
Tom Stoppard's "Travesties." With
Diane keaton, Jessica Harper and
talented young Alfred Lutter, who
played Ellen Burstyn's son in "Alice
Doesn't Live Here Anymore."
Plays tonight.
Last Tango in Paris (1973)
The Red Vic, San Francisco
Bernardo Bertolucci's study of a
neurotic sexual relationship be
tween a middle-aged man — a one
time Bohemian whose wife has just

committed suicide — and a young
French bourgeoisie may be the
greatest film of the last 20 years. No
one has ever explored sexuality in
movies in as intimate and unrelent
ing a manner. Bertolucci and Mar
lon Brando, who plays the tragic
hero, are surely the most amazing
director-actor combination since D.
W. Griffith and Lillian Gish. To
describe what Brando does for this
movie would require searching for
new superlatives. With Maria
Schneider, Jean-Pierre Leaud,
Maria Michi and Massimo Girotti;
screenplay by Bertolucci and Franco
Arcalli; photographed by Vittorio
Storaro; music by Gato Barbieri.
The paintings in the opening credits
are by Francis Bacon.
Plays Tuseday and Wednesday.
The Elephant Man (1980)
UC-Berkeley Theatre, Berkeley
David Lynch's remarkable movie
about John Merrick, the "Elephant
Man," a human being hideously
deformed since birth. The
screenplay by Christopher DeVore,
Eric Bergren and Lynch is strong
and unsentimental, but the film is
romantic — in the truest sense. Its
subject is the triumph of the human
spirit over the horrors of birth and
environment. John Hurt is superb as
Merrick; Anthony Hopkins, more
restrained than usual, is surprisingly
effective as Frederick Treves, the
London doctor who "discovers"
him. Freddie Francis' magnificent
black and white photography em

phasizes the symbols of the Indus
trial Revolution; the film looks like
Dickens might have directed it.
With fine supporting performances
by John Gielgud and Wendy Hi Her.
Plays tommorow with "Freaks."
Amarcord (1975)
Camera One, San Jose
The opening sequence of this
childhood reminiscence — a joyous
bonfire-lit festival in a small town —
is better than any portion of any Fel
lini film in so long that one hopes for
a return to the warmth and unaf
fected vaudeville humor of his pre
"Dolce Vita" period. But despite
some funny moments (notably a
group masturbation in a parked car)
and a breathtaking walk through the
fog, "Amarcord" is, in its way, as
extravagently self-conscious and
grotesque as most of his other
pictures of the 1960s and '70s.
There is a particularly ludicrous
scene involving a dwarf nun; Fellini
uses freaks so gratuitously that it's a
wonder he can get any of them to act
for him anymore.
Plays Tuesday with "Miracle in
Milan."
The Trip to Bountiful (1985)
Park Theatre, Menlo Park
Watching this Peter Masterson
film of a Morton Foote 1953
teleplay is like experiencing sensory
deprivation. Since nothing surpris
ing or dramatic ever happens, the
movie has a drawn out quality, yet

people might feel comfortable with
it precisely because, like TV, it
doesn't demand one's full attention.
The story is about grandmotherly
Carrie Watts, who journeys to her
hometown of Bountiful, Texas,
where she hopes to recapture a
more pleasant and prosperous past.
Geraldine Page's Oscar nomination
for her performance here is a
dubious distinction; she scores
points for acting sly and cute, but
her role is not, to put it kindly, one
which an actor can grow in. Foote's
material is not just repetitive, it's
old hat from the beginning; it's
grandmother schtick. The pace is
torpid, and Masterson's directing
style is so static and enervating that
the editing glitches — cutting away
from or to a character too soon —
stick out a mile. With John Heard,
Carlin Glynn and Richard Bradford.

Freaks(l932)
UC-Berkeley Theatre, Berkeley
Tod Browning's chiller, set in the
tantalizing milieu of the circus,
begins with a prefatory title that
begs compassion for the typically
mocked and mistreated unfor
tunates compelled to seek employ
ment as sideshow freaks. But the
horror of the picture — and it is one
of the scariest movies Hollywood
has ever produced — is the function
of the very deficiences and distor
tions that we were told should make
us sympathetic to these creatures.
Willis Goldbeck and Leon Gordon
adapted the fatuous, amatuerish
script from a Tom Robbins story
called "Spurs." Olga Baclanova
plays the cheap, manipulative circus
star who marries one of the
"freaks," cuckolds him and elects
herself the target of a monstrous
revenge. Wallace Ford and Leila
Hyams co-star.
Plays tomorrow with " The Ele
phant Man."
Back to the Future (1985)
Old Mill Six, Mountain View
Robert Zemeckis (director) and
Boh Gale (co-writer) team up again
for the first time since their terrific
"Used Cars" (1980), and though
their material here has less vulgar
energy and bite, it still has their un
flagging innovation in setting up
gags. This time-travel fantasy satiri

cally cross-references the consumer
cultures of the 1950s and '80s, hut
it's mostly about the Oedipal com
plexities of teen-aged Marty McFly
(Michael J. Fox) going back in time
and meeting his teen-aged parents.
Typically for Zemeckis and Gale,
the comic structure is incredibly in
tricate, with jokes that set up rever
berations throughout the movie;
you have to pay attention to catch
everything. There are some very
funny performances, notably by
Fox, Cristopher Lloyd and Crispin
Glover, who does some undefinably
hilarious things as Marty's dad. With
Lea Thompson.

This is Spinal Tap
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Rob Reiner's slight, often
hilarious parody of heavy-metal
rock features Christopher Guest,
Michael McKean and Harry Shearer
(in a walrus moustache) as the main
members of the group whose des
cent from fame this mock documen
tary chronicles. (They also
collaborated with Reiner on the
screenplay.)
Plays tonight and tomorrow with
"After Hours."
Jewel of the Nile (1985)
Century 10, Mountain View
This sequel to director Robert
Zemeckis and writer Diane
Thomas's "Romancing the Stone" is
a rather dry, redundant reworking
of the tricks in the original. Joan
Wilder and Jack T. Colton
(Kathleen Turner and Michael
Douglas again) are on their world
cruise, and, as a fairy tale couple,
they need a fairy tale adventure to
give their relationship a boost. It
comes in the form of a sinisterly
charming prince (Spiros Focas). The
silly, clumsily staged reprise of the
original's opening sequence sets the
tone for the rest of the movie, and
Danny DeVito's one-note perfor
mance for "Romancing" is given
more play here. This is symptomatic
of producer and star Douglas' sense
of humor and creativity. Directed by
Lewis Teague and written by Mark
Rosenthal & Lawrence Konner,
who mostly discard the female sen
sibility of the original.
Plays this week.
