## Missed foul shots doom Cardinal, 77-75 Beck does in Card â€” again 
### TOM GILLESPIE 
As last night's Stanford-Arizona
State basketball game wound down to
its crucial moments, there was no
doubt who the Sun Devils were
looking to pull the game out. With
his outstanding play in recent Pacific
10 Conference games and his history
of reserving his best games for Stan
ford, junior guard Steve Beck was the
man. To no one's surprise, he
responded with 28 points, many of
them coming on clutch jump shots
and free throws, including the game
winning basket.
Beck has simply been on fire of
late. After getting off to a relatively
slow start in Pac-10 play, he has been
in double figures for five consecutive
games going into last night, including
a 27-point effort against Oregon
State and a 28-point game against
Washington. In those five games,
Beck has been shooting 54 percent
from the field, with most of his shots
coming from the outside.
In addition to his fine recent Pac
-10 play, Beck has made a career out
of playing against the Cardinal. In his
six games against Stanford, he has
scored at least 20 points in every con
test, and he has shot a torrid 66 per
cent from the floor and 93 percent
from the line. Going into last night's
ballgame, the Cardinal were all too
aware that Beck was the player they
had to stop.
As the final 77-75 outcome indi
cated, they failed in their crucial task.
Though not that much of a force in
the first half (he had a quiet 10 points
at the break), Beck saw the ball more
and more down the stretch, despite
Stanford's efforts to keep it out of his
hands.
In the last three minutes of regula
tion, Beck tossed in eight points to
help pull ASU even, and in the
overtime period, he scored four more
prior to his game-winner. Obviously,
he was the player with the hot hand
and the one who the Sun Devils
wanted taking the final shot. "I really
felt good towards the end of the
game. I was asking for the ball, and I
