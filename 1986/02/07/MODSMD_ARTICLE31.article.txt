## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Arizona State guard Steve Beck hit
a 20-foot jumper with seven seconds
remaining to lead the Sun Devils to a
77-75 overtime victory over Stanford
last night in front of a stunned crowd
of 6,272 at Maples Pavilion.
Following a missed front end of a
one-and-one by Stanford guard Todd
Lichti with 54 seconds left, Arizona
State used the full 45 seconds on the
shot clock before Beck clinched the
victory with his jumper from the top
of the key.
"We wanted to get it to him on the
baseline," Arizona State Coach Steve
Patterson said, "but they were
shadowing him, so he had to come
out and get it. He made a great move
to get open for the shot.
"He's responding to all the adver
sity this season and playing better and
better, and he won it for us tonight."
"The play was designed to go
baseline," Beck said. "I was just
trying to follow the play. When I got
the ball, I saw the clock said seven
seconds, so I let it go.
"I've been shooting well the last
couple of ballgames, so I've just been
firing it up."
Beck finished with 28 points to
lead all scorers. He scored six of the
Sun Devils' seven points in overtime.
Stanford pushed the ball upcourt
after Beck's shot. Novian Whitsitt
missed an 18-footer with three
seconds remaining and got the
rebound, but time expired before he
could get off a second shot.
"We had decided if we had a good
shot, we'd come down and get it, and
we were very pleased with the shot,"
Stanford Coach Tom Davis said of
Whitsitt's effort. "That was probably
as good a shot as we could've gotten
off a timeout.
"I think if you get one good shot
under those circumstances where
Novian got it, you've got to take it."
With the loss, Stanford falls into a
fifth-place tie in the Pacific 10 Con
ference with California and Washing
ton State at 5-5. The Cardinal is 11-
11 overall and saw an end to its three
game winning streak.
A victory would have put the Card

inal all alone in third place in the Pac
-10, only one-and-one-half games be
hind league-leading Arizona.
The victory was the first for
Arizona State on the road in 10 tries.
The Sun Devils are in eighth place
with a 4-6 record, 10-10 overall. The
win avenges their only loss at home, a
66-59 decision to Stanford last
month.
Stanford opened a 70-62 lead with
1:55 left in regulation when center
Howard Wright hit both ends of a
one-and-one, and then the Cardinal
went scoreless for the duration while
Arizona State scored eight straight
points.

Guard Bobby Thompson got the
Sun Devils into overtime with some
late heroics. With Stanford leading
70-68 with 37 seconds left in the
second half, Thompson drove the
middle to tie it at 70-70, but missed
the free throw and a possible three
point play.
Beck had a chance to win it in
regulation when the Sun Devils got
