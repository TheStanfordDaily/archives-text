# Sun Devils steal overtime victory
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Arizona State guard Steve Beck hit
a 20-foot jumper with seven seconds
remaining to lead the Sun Devils to a
77-75 overtime victory over Stanford
last night in front of a stunned crowd
of 6,272 at Maples Pavilion.
Following a missed front end of a
one-and-one by Stanford guard Todd
Lichti with 54 seconds left, Arizona
State used the full 45 seconds on the
shot clock before Beck clinched the
victory with his jumper from the top
of the key.
"We wanted to get it to him on the
baseline," Arizona State Coach Steve
Patterson said, "but they were
shadowing him, so he had to come
out and get it. He made a great move
to get open for the shot.
"He's responding to all the adver
sity this season and playing better and
better, and he won it for us tonight."
"The play was designed to go
baseline," Beck said. "I was just
trying to follow the play. When I got
the ball, I saw the clock said seven
seconds, so I let it go.
"I've been shooting well the last
couple of ballgames, so I've just been
firing it up."
Beck finished with 28 points to
lead all scorers. He scored six of the
Sun Devils' seven points in overtime.
Stanford pushed the ball upcourt
after Beck's shot. Novian Whitsitt
missed an 18-footer with three
seconds remaining and got the
rebound, but time expired before he
could get off a second shot.
"We had decided if we had a good
shot, we'd come down and get it, and
we were very pleased with the shot,"
Stanford Coach Tom Davis said of
Whitsitt's effort. "That was probably
as good a shot as we could've gotten
off a timeout.
"I think if you get one good shot
under those circumstances where
Novian got it, you've got to take it."
With the loss, Stanford falls into a
fifth-place tie in the Pacific 10 Con
ference with California and Washing
ton State at 5-5. The Cardinal is 11-
11 overall and saw an end to its three
game winning streak.
A victory would have put the Card

inal all alone in third place in the Pac
-10, only one-and-one-half games be
hind league-leading Arizona.
The victory was the first for
Arizona State on the road in 10 tries.
The Sun Devils are in eighth place
with a 4-6 record, 10-10 overall. The
win avenges their only loss at home, a
66-59 decision to Stanford last
month.
Stanford opened a 70-62 lead with
1:55 left in regulation when center
Howard Wright hit both ends of a
one-and-one, and then the Cardinal
went scoreless for the duration while
Arizona State scored eight straight
points.

Guard Bobby Thompson got the
Sun Devils into overtime with some
late heroics. With Stanford leading
70-68 with 37 seconds left in the
second half, Thompson drove the
middle to tie it at 70-70, but missed
the free throw and a possible three
point play.
Beck had a chance to win it in
regulation when the Sun Devils got
the ball back on a steal, but his
jumper with three seconds left didn't
fall.
Stanford's foul shooting, which had
been a strong point of the team, fal
tered in the final one-and-one-half
minutes of regulation and the five
minute overtime. Andy Fischer and
Keith Ramee both missed front ends
at the end of the second half, and
Lichti missed three free throws in
overtime.
"We couldn't quite put it away,"
Davis said.
Lichti's misses were particularly
surprising. The freshman had come
on to be one of the Cardinal's most
dependable free throw shooters in the
clutch, but he missed a pair with 1:47
left in overtime and Stanford clinging
to a 73-71 lead, and then he missed
the front end with 54 seconds left and
the game tied 75-75.
"You look at that and say, 'That
wasn't a very good game for Todd.'
Then you look at the line and see that
he was 10-of-18 and scored 23
points," Davis said.

Following Lichti in the scoring
column for Stanford was Whitsitt,
who finished with 21, including 14 in
the first half.
Stanford's press gave the Sun
Devils problems throughout the
game, forcing 19 turnovers, including
12 steals — five by Fischer — a five
second inbound violation and a 10-
second backcourt violation.
"The press really hurt us," Patter
son said. "We must've given up 14 or
16 points because of it."
Stanford was hurt inside when cen
ter Howard Wright fouled out with
4:29 to go in the overtime. Wright
scored 13 points, pulled down eight
rebounds and blocked three shots on
the night.
"I thought the crucial point was
when Wright fouled out," Patterson
said. "He did a super job on the
boards and with those fall-away jump
shots."
Until Thompson tied it in the final
minute, the game had last been tied at
49-49 with 13:27 left in the second
half, when the Cardinal began to pull
away.
Stanford led by as many as 10 in
the first half, but the Sun Devils
managed to close the deficit to 40-34

at halftime. They tied it at 40-40 in
the first two minutes, and the lead
changed hands for the next five
minutes.
In the overtime, Whitsitt laid in a
feed from Ramee to give Stanford a
75-73 lead, but Beck came back with
a 15-footer to tie it at 75-75 with
1:25 left.
