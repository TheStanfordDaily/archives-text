# Stanford to meet UCSB
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
Stanford's real baseball season starts today. Forget
those cakewalks against San Jose State and the Univer
sity of San Francisco; they were just warmups.
This weekend's three-game set with UC-Santa Bar
bara promises to be the genuine article. It'll be baseball
like it's meant to be played.
Jack McDowell, 2-0, is scheduled to start today's 2
p.m. game at Sunken Diamond for Stanford. Although
official word wasn't received, the Gauchos will likely
go with senior right-hander Mike Tresemer, 9-5 last
year with a 2.91 ERA. Tresemer started for UCSB
against USC earlier this year and gave up four runs on
six hits through five innings.
Games are slated to start tomorrow and Sunday at 1
p.m.
The Cardinal's five games to date — four with SJSU
and one with USF — were gimmes. The Gauchos, 2-0
on the year, will give Stanford Coach Mark Marquess'
team its first test of the year. They'll be the first team
Stanford will play that's already won a game.
"They're a real good team," Marquess said. "They'll
be really tough. They're the strongest team we'll play

so far."
UCSB finished 37-22-2 overall a year ago and 16-14
in the Pacific Coast Athletic Association. And, accord
ing to sixth-year Coach AI Ferrer, this year's team is
improved.
"On paper we look better than we have in the past,"
Ferrer said. "I believe our pitching looks deeper, our
catching looks solid and overall our lineup is very
strong."
And UCSB handed Stanford one of its 15 losses last
year winning 4-2 in the teams' only meeting.
Although the Gauchos lost plenty to graduation —
gone is first baseman Dave Stewart (.395, 1 1 HR and
60 RBI) and third baseman Bill Geivett, the PCAA's
leading hitter a year ago with a .411 average — a lot of
talent returns.
Shortstop Erik Johnson (.353,9,48), center fielder
Vance Pasqua (.315,8,38) and Mark Leonard
(.348,4,23) anchor the Gaucho attack. Ferrer also at
tracted some talent from local junior colleges. Quinn
Mack, who hit .378 at Cerritos, could crack the lineup
in right field. >
"They expect to do very well," Marquess said.

Doug Robbins couldn't get out of the way of this one, but the sturdy catcher appeared to be unhurt as he
trotted down to first.
