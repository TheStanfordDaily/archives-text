# Softballers drop doubleheader to Spartans in season opener
## 
### ANDREA JONES 
A weak offense proved to be the Stanford Softball
team's downfall yesterday, as it opened the 1986 season
by dropping a doubleheader to San Jose State 2-1 and 1-
0.
In the first game, the Cardinal committed four errors
which allowed SJSU to collect two unearned runs.
Trailing 1-0 in the bottom of the second inning, Stan
ford's first three batters rallied to load the bases. Fresh
man Vija Brookshire walked with two outs which allowed
leadoff batter Christy Fiscalini to score Stanford's only
run. On the next play, shortstop Laura Buchanan
grounded out ending the inning for the Cardinal and
leaving three players on base.
In game two, the Cardinal played some really tough
defense.
However," We need to tune up on our offensive skills,"
sophomore left-fielder Maria De La Rosa said after the 1-
0 loss.
"Our defense is really strong," said junior Betsy Wat
son, who pitched the second game for the Cardinal. "Our
offense is really strong too, we just didn't get the hits at
the right time." N
In the top of the fourth inning, in an attempt to make a
play at third base, Fiscalini injured her knee and had to sit
out the remainder of the game. Last season, Fiscalini had

surgery on her knee, but the word on this injury is that it is
only a sprain.
Alison Selleck replaced Fiscalini and made a diving
catch to end the inning. The heroics continued in the top
of the fifth inning when sophomore Maria De La Rosa
made a spectacular diving catch in left field. De La Rosa's
grab was the second out of the inning and took the steam
out of an apparent Spartan rally.
Stanford had an opportunity to tie the score in the bot
tom of the sixth inning. Leadoff batter K.K. Bush got to
first on an error by the Spartan first baseman. She ad
vanced to third on sacrifice bunts by Brookshire and
Laura Buchanan. With two outs, De La Rosa hit a solid
line drive which would have brought Bush home easily,
however, the Spartan shortstop made a tremendous play
and ended Stanford's comeback effort
Despite the twofold loss, the Stanford players were
pleased with yesterday's game.
"We did a lot of things we would have been afraid to do
last year; today's game was a real confidence builder," De
La Rosa said.
Junior Lisa Buchanan, who started at pitcher in the first
game, was particularly pleased with her performance on
the mound.
"I've worked on some new pitches and they're really
starting to come around, especially the curve," Buchanan
said.
