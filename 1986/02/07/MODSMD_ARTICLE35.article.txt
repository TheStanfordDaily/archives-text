### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
Stanford's Dan Goldie breezed
past Houston's unheralded Brent
Saigeon 6-2, 6-4 yesterday to open
the defense of his singles title in the
Rolex National Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships in Houston.
But the Cardinal's Leigh Anne
Eldredge, ranked No. 7 in the
women's draw, was upset by North
western's Diane Donnelly 6-1, 7-5 in
other first round action.
Goldie, seeded No. 2 behind Cali
fornia's Steve DeVries, told Stanford
Men's Coach Dick Gould that he
played as well as he needed to in or
der to win. "Dan said he played
pretty routinely," Gould said.
Gould said he had not heard of

Saigeon oetore, but he speculated
that Saigeon was entered in the
tournament as a gratuity to Houston,
the host school.
Goldie will play in the second
round this morning against Clemson's
Matt Ochesky. Should he win that
match, Goldie will play later in the
day in the quarterfinals. The semi
finals will take place tomorrow, and
the tournament will conclude with
championship action Sunday.
"From now on, the competition
gets pretty tough," Gould said.
"These are the guys he'll have to beat
in the nationals."
Gould mentioned that Goldie's
back and legs were less than 100 per
cent prior to yesterday's match, but
he was not adversely affected during
the match. "It will be interesting to

see how they hold up with two
matches tomorrow," Gould said.
Eldredge, who teamed with Linda
Gates last season to capture the
Rolex doubles crown, will bring home
no titles this year.
"She was obviously playing a girl
she should have beaten," Stanford
Women's Coach Frank Brennan said.
"She got there (Houston) in plenty of
time and had time to practice. She
just couldn't get started. The match
was over before she knew it."
Donnelly was a "respectable" op
ponent, according to Brennan, "but
she should not have beaten Leigh
Anne."
"That's what happens when you
don't have the coach with you,"
said Brennan, who did not ac
company Eldredge to Houston.
