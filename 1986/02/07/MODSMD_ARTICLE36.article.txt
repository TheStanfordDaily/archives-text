# Swimmers to face 'horns

Last Friday's meet against Arizona State was supposed
to be little more than a workout in front of spectators for
the Stanford women's swimming team. Instead, the team
was in top form, crushing the Sun Devils 86-27 to boost
the Cardinal's dual meet record to 5-0.
The ASU meet was basically preparation for tomor
row's clash with No. 1 Texas at DeGuerre Pool. The first
gun goes off at noon.
The Longhorns, winners of the last two NCAA cham
pionships, are dead-set on making 1986 their third
straight title year. Last season, Texas set an NCAA
scoring record with 643 points — 637 of which were
scored by returing swimmers.
Stanford was beaten fairly easily by Texas last year in
Austin, 88-52, but the Cardinal came out on top at home
in 1984, 79-61. However, the Longhorns do have a his
tory of strong swimming at DeGuerre — Texas swimmers
hold seven pool records.
According to Stanford Coach George Haines, the
Longhorns have the ability to swim away and hide from
his third-ranked Cardinal. "He (Texas Coach Richard

Quick) has got the kind of team that it they swim well,
they could make it a pretty one-way meet, Haines s <iid.
Indeed, Quick does have quite a bit ot talent at his dis
posal, including 15 All-Americans, four of whom were
Olympians in 1984. The team is led by sophomore Tiffany
Cohen, probably the most dominant distance freestyler in
the nation.
Cohen, who took two gold medals in Los Angeles, was
the 1984-85 Collegiate Swimmer of the Year, winning
NCAA titles in the 500 and 1,650-yard freestyles. She
also finished second in the 400 individual medley and tilth
in the 200 freestyle.
Stanford will try to upset Texas with a balanced attack
which includes eight swimmers who have already qualified
for the NCAA championships. The hottest Cardinal right
now is freshman Jenna Johnson, who has qualified in tour
individual events and four relays.
Although he would love to topple the nation s No. 1
team, Haines is keeping his eye on the war — the NC AAs
in March — rather than on Saturday's battle. "I'm point
ing more toward NCAAs than to this meet," Haines said.
"Winning or losing won't make a difference tor the
NCAAs.
"But that would be great if we won."
