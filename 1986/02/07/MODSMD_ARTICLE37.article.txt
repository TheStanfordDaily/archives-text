This weekend, the fifth-ranked Stanford men's
volleyball team will face two more tough opponents
as it continues its four-match, six-day road trip.
The Cardinal, following an upset win over No. 4
UC-Santa Barbara on Wednesday night, is cur
rently 4-0 overall and 3-0 in California Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association play. It took the
team over two hours to down the Gauchos 15-10,
15-10, 17-15.
Tonight, Stanford meets Long Beach State,
ranked ninth nationally. The 49ers, under fifth
year coach Ray Ratelle, are 2-1 overall and 1-1 in
C IVA action. Last week, the squad lost to No. 3
USC in three games, but on Wednesday, Long
Beach beat No. 13 Cal State-Northridge 15-12,15-
10, 15-8.
The 49ers are a very young team, with no seniors
in the starting lineup. That is, they are young unless
\ou consider the fact that the team's top player is
25-year-old sophomore Ali Tazerouni, a member

of the Iranian National Team.
The 6-foot-6, 198-pound middle blocker led the
team in kills against Northridge with 16, and he had
12 against the Trojans the week before. A virtual
unknown before this season, Tazerouni is prone to

rookie mistakes, and he has made 14 hitting errors
in his last two matches. His hitting percentage is
below .290.
Other players to watch on the squad include
junior middle blocker Andreas Koch, who had
eight kills in the Northridge game, junior setter
Alan Jane and sophomore outside hitter Rick Arce.

"Long Beach is the weakest team we face on this
trip," Stanford Co-coach Don Shaw said, "but
they can beat anyone in the conference. Without
Ali, Long Beach is a mediocre team. He brings the
other players up to a higher level. They can be dan
gerous."
Tomorrow, the Cardinal will face a very different
opponent in San Diego State. With five senior
starters, the Aztecs are a team laden with experi
ence.
The Aztecs' experience was evident last week
when SDSU took defending national champion
Pepperdine to five games before losing 15-5, 15-4,
13-15, 14-16, 15-9. The Waves justified their top
rank in the nation Wednesday night by defeating
No. 2 UCLA in four games.
San Diego State Coach Mark Warner, now in his
second year, has taken the Aztecs to a 1-1 record
overall and 0-1 in the league, and they are ranked
11th in the nation.
SDSU will play UCSB tonight and take on Stan
ford tomorrow night. The Cardinal will then go on
to meet league-leading Pepperdine Monday night.
