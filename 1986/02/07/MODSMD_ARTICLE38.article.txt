# Young swimmers to meet Hay ward
## Card heads east 
### AMY FRANCETIC Staff writer 
Sandwiched between two
weekends of intense competition,
a meet with Cal State-Hayward
will offer the Stanford mens swim
team an opportunity to catch its
breath. And tomorrow, the Card
inal will do just that, traveling
north to Hayward to swim against
the Division 111 squad.
Hayward is a smaller and less
competitive team compared to the
kind of conference competition
Stanford is used to seeing. "We're
only sending eight men," Asst.
Coach Ted Knapp said. "Of the
men who are participating, several
swimmers are trying to get a place
with the travelling team, and the
others are swimming because they
haven't had much opportunity to

compete in the past dual meets.
"We exposed some decent times
against Arizona State last
weekend, and I hope that the team
doesn't lose their momentum
swimming with a slower team,"
Knapp added.
Freshman Andrew Parnell ex
plained that the coaches are using
the Hayward meet to decide who
will accompany the team to
UCLA next weekend.
"I hope to take a few seconds
off of my 50 and 100 freestyle
times," Parnell said. "We've
changed our training from long
distances to sprints since winter
break, and the shorter distances
are helping me a lot."
While a few swimmers will be
racing Hayward, the rest of the
team will be entertaining some
visiting recruits.
