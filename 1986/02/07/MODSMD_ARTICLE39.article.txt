# Cardinal to run in Idaho in the Boise Invitational
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
This weekend 30 of Stanford's
track and field athletes will be taking
a long bus ride to Boise, Idaho where
they will compete in the first annual
Boise Invitational.
The trip to Boise will take 15
hours, but for the relatively inexperi
enced Stanford squad, the chance to
compete should be worth the trouble.
Stanford Coach Brooks Johnson is
looking at the meet as a chance for
some of his new athletes to get a taste
of collegiate competition. Because at
tendance is optional for the proven
varsity athletes, some will be making
the trip and some will not.
Pole vaulters John Gash and Dave

Pickett will be trying to better the
NCAA pole vault standard of 17-
feet, 3-inches, and Idaho natives
D.D. Harris and Lisa Bernhagen will
brave the bus ride for a trip home.
Bernhagen, who two weeks ago
won the prestigious LSU Invitational,
will take part in her specialty, the
high jump. At this point, Harris is still
uncertain which event he'll enter.
But for the most part, Johnson con
siders the trip "a reward for some of
the kids. It's a low-key thing, a
chance to get to know each other bet
ter, an opportunity for kids who
wouldn't get to travel."
Teams taking part in the meet will
be Stanford, Boise State, Sacramento
State, Idaho and Idaho State. Also
competing will be a few athletes from

Washington State and Olympic triple
jumper Al Jovner, who will forgo his
specialty and enter the 55-meter
hurdles.
The premier event of the meet, ac
cording to Boise State Sports Infor
mation Director Cheryl Kvasnicka,
should be the men's high jump. Six
athletes with previous bests of seven
feet or better, Stanford's Brian Mar
shall included, will vie for the crown.
The meet will also be somewhat of
a landmark event for Idaho, as it
marks the first big indoor meet in the
state's history. Boise State's track,
just recently completed, is the first of
its kind in Idaho. If everything goes
well, as Kvasnicka hopes, Boise State
would like to host three or four major
events a year.
