As Filipinos tally the votes from their first
presidential election in nearly two decades,
Stanford scholars and Filipinos in the Uni

fraudulent victory for President Ferdinand
Marcos over opposition candidate Corazon
Aquino.
"There have been well-founded charges
of cheating," said Ramon Abrocosa, a
former assistant professor of engineering at
the University of the Philippines who is cur

announcement Tuesday that he will order
the Philippine military to guard polling

intends to tamper with the election.
"(Marcos) will try to cheat . . , he has done

"75 percent support" of (Corazon) Aquino
in the Philippines, "Marcos will win because
of cheating."

in today's election would be "a miracle."
Aquino, widow of assassinated opposition
leader Benigno Aquino, heads a coalition of
opposition groups seeking to unseat Marcos,
who has ruled the Philippines since 1965.

Marcos, facing mounting unrest at home and

probably not resort to serious manipulation

stench of fraud" will put a "real constraint
on (Marcos) to do this thing fairly," Myers
said.
However, Myers, who has written on
Philippine economic problems, predicted
