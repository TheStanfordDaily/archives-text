# Scholars, Filipinos see Marcos win

As Filipinos tally the votes from their first
presidential election in nearly two decades,
Stanford scholars and Filipinos in the Uni
versity community foresee a clear, but likely
fraudulent victory for President Ferdinand
Marcos over opposition candidate Corazon
Aquino.
"There have been well-founded charges
of cheating," said Ramon Abrocosa, a
former assistant professor of engineering at
the University of the Philippines who is cur
rently studying at Stanford. He said Marcos'
announcement Tuesday that he will order
the Philippine military to guard polling

places represents a clear indication that he
intends to tamper with the election.
"(Marcos) will try to cheat . . , he has done
(it) before, and he will do it again,"
Abrocosa said.
Dr. Ruben Mallari, a Park
physician and an official in the apti-Marcos
Ninoy Aquino Movement, said that despite
"75 percent support" of (Corazon) Aquino
in the Philippines, "Marcos will win because
of cheating."
According to Mallari, an Aquino victory
in today's election would be "a miracle."
Aquino, widow of assassinated opposition
leader Benigno Aquino, heads a coalition of
opposition groups seeking to unseat Marcos,
who has ruled the Philippines since 1965.

Marcos, facing mounting unrest at home and
increasing pressure from the United States
to reform his authoritarian rule, called the
current election in a surprise move in
December.
According to Raymond Myers, a Hoover
senior research fellow and curator of the in
stitution's East Asian library, Marcos will
probably not resort to serious manipulation
of the election process. The fear of a "huge
stench of fraud" will put a "real constraint
on (Marcos) to do this thing fairly," Myers
said.
However, Myers, who has written on
Philippine economic problems, predicted
that Marcos will likely win in any case
because of his elaborate "Tammany
Hall machine" of political patronage.
According to Myers, the Marcos poli
tical machine is especially strong in
the countryside where the "partial
success of land reform" has built sig
nificant support for Marcos.
Manuel Gaspai, a Filipino doctoral
candidate in food research here, said
his personal experience working for
the Philippine government has shown
him how well Marcos is able to
"manipulate the machinery" of gov

ernment in the Philippines. "As a
former rural development officer ...
I know (how Marcos can) use the
government to campaign for him,"
Gaspai said. "He will make himself
win."
Speaking "as a political scientist,
not a (Philippine) scholar," Political
Science Prof. Jan Triska anticipated
that the outcome of today's election is
not likely to have a serious impact on
U.S. policy toward the Philippines.
Even if Marcos wins the election
fraudulently, "the United States can
not do more than try to stop some
funds," he said.
According to Myers, if Aquino
wins, she will probably be
"overwhelmed by problems." Nei
ther Aquino nor Marcos is going to
"build a democracy . . . (or) a
pluralist society," he said.
