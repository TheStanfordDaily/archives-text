# Grapplers trek south to Biola as regular season winds down
## 
### PETER CASTILLO Staff writer 
After months of training and competition, the Stanford
wrestling team's regular season is nearing a climax, and
the Pacific 10 Championships lie only three weeks away.
This weekend's competition will be extremely important
for the Cardinal in preparation for the Pac-lOs.
Stanford takes on Northern Arizona tonight at Biola
College in La Mirada, and then tomorrow, the Cardinal
begins the Biola Invitational. The Biola will feature all the
California wrestling schools plus Arizona State and Brig
ham Young.
Stanford Coach Chris Horpel said he expects to beat
Northern Arizona, "but we will have to wrestle well, since
they are a fair team."
"I think that four guys who have been consistent
wrestlers, Jeff Bradley, Dave Lee, Pete Rogers and Kurt
Kassulke, stand a good chance to do well and have some
thing to spring into the Pac-lOs," Horpel said. "The
others 1 hope will benefit from the competition and be
able to identify problems."
The only injured Cardinal is 126-pound Neil Warnik,

who has a jammed neck. Jeff Bradley (134 pounds)
returns to the lineup after a week's layoff.
Horpel noted that it is the first time that Bradley has
looked good since the beginning of the season, and he
hopes Bradley can return to his early seaon form when he
completely dominated opponents.
Horpel is also interested in seeing how Mark Alex (142
pounds) fares. In the past month, Alex has shown consid
erable progress. Against Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo last
Saturday, he physically dominated his opponent and
looked very sharp technically.
Some tough competition will be awaiting Dave Lee at
167 pounds. Darryl Pope, from Cal State-Bakersfield,
and Fresno State's Fred Little have given Lee a lot of
trouble this season in some great matches.
"A tournament is a very drawn-out affair. You look for
people to have the right attitude. Some wrestlers are bet
ter in tournaments while others are in dual meets. Consis
tency is the key," Horpel said.
"Some wrestlers get psyched out looking ahead and
then lose in the first round. You need to focus on your
match and not get distracted by all that is going on around
you," he added.
