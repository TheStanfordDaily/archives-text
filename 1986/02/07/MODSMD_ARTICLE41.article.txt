## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer With wire reports 
Tomorrow holds a tougher op
ponent in store for the Stanford
men's basketball team as first-place
Arizona visits Maples Pavilion for a
3 p.m. contest.
The two teams met back on Jan.
9 in Tucson, and the Wildcats
emerged with a 77-69 victory in
front of 10,471 at McKale Center.
Arizona has compiled a 7-2
record in the Pac-10, a half-game
ahead of Washington. In the big
gest game in the conference to date,
the Wildcats beat the Huskies in
Seattle 70-57 last Saturday.
Last night in Berkeley, guard
Craig McMillan scored 21 points,
15 of them in the first half, to lead
the Wildcats to a 61 -52 victory over
California.
Arizona took control of the game
for good late in the first half when
McMillan scored six straight points
to give the Wildcats a 29-20 edge.
Bv the half, Arizona led 34-26.
Freshman Sean Elliott added 15
points for Arizona, which improved
to 16-6 overall and 7-2 in the
league. The victory was Arizona's
11th in its last 13 games.
Meanwhile, Washington fell to
UCLA in Pauley Pavilion last night
94-89, moving the Wildcats into
first place. In that game. Reggie
Miller scored 34 points for UCLA
as Washington needed a rebound
basket by Shag Williams as regula
tion time ran out to tie the game at
75-75.
UCLA, behind Miller and
Jerome "Pooh" Richardson, ran off
to an 88-81 lead in the first 3:41 of
overtime, and Washington never
recovered.
In the other Pac-10 game yester
day, Washington State defeated
USC in Los Angeles, 77-75 in
overtime.
Arizona is 16-6 overall, the best
overall record in the conference. At
home Arizona has been unbeatable
so far, with a 5-0 record at McKale
Center, probably the most in

timidating arena in the league.
Guard Steve Kerr has consis
tently played well against Stanford,
scoring a career-high 24 points last
month against the Cardinal to pace
the Arizona attack. His previous
career high of 23 came against
Stanford last year. He is averaging

almost 15 points per game this
season.
Arizona Coach Lute Olson is 46-
33 since coming to Tucson from
lowa, where he led the Hawkeyes
to a Final Four appearance. Olson

Neil Johnson and Todd Lichti combined for 29 points last night
against Arizona State. The Cardinal will need continued produc
tion from the pair tomorrow against league-leading Arizona.
said of Kerr, "He never loses concen
tration, the kids respect him, and if
you give him an inch, he'll knock your
eyeballs out."
In the earlier meeting, the Wildcats
took away the Cardinal's inside game
and forced Stanford into a perimeter
shooting offense. Center John Edgar,
though only 6-foot-6, was the key,
holding Stanford center Howard
Wright scoreless for 17 minutes, until
Wright left the game with a sprained
ankle early in the second half.

At the other end, Elliot went inside
for the Wildcats and came away with
20 points. He is averaging 15.6 points
per game to lead Arizona.
For the Cardinal, freshman Todd
Lichti scored 19 points in the losing
effort. Earl Koberlein, who is out for
the rest of the season with ligament

Tomorrow holds a tougher op
ponent in store for the Stanford

9 in Tucson, and the Wildcats
emerged with a 77-69 victory in

Arizona has compiled a 7-2
record in the Pac-10, a half-game
ahead of Washington. In the big
gest game in the conference to date,

Seattle 70-57 last Saturday.
Last night in Berkeley, guard

15 of them in the first half, to lead
the Wildcats to a 61 -52 victory over
California.

for good late in the first half when
McMillan scored six straight points
to give the Wildcats a 29-20 edge.
Bv the half, Arizona led 34-26.
Freshman Sean Elliott added 15
points for Arizona, which improved
to 16-6 overall and 7-2 in the
league. The victory was Arizona's
11th in its last 13 games.
Meanwhile, Washington fell to
UCLA in Pauley Pavilion last night
94-89, moving the Wildcats into
first place. In that game. Reggie

as Washington needed a rebound
basket by Shag Williams as regula
tion time ran out to tie the game at
75-75.
UCLA, behind Miller and
Jerome "Pooh" Richardson, ran off
to an 88-81 lead in the first 3:41 of
overtime, and Washington never
recovered.
In the other Pac-10 game yester
day, Washington State defeated
USC in Los Angeles, 77-75 in
overtime.
Arizona is 16-6 overall, the best
overall record in the conference. At
home Arizona has been unbeatable
so far, with a 5-0 record at McKale
Center, probably the most in

timidating arena in the league.
Guard Steve Kerr has consis
tently played well against Stanford,
scoring a career-high 24 points last
month against the Cardinal to pace
the Arizona attack. His previous
career high of 23 came against
Stanford last year. He is averaging

almost 15 points per game this
season.

33 since coming to Tucson from
lowa, where he led the Hawkeyes
to a Final Four appearance. Olson


Todd Sitrin/Daily
Neil Johnson and Todd Lichti combined for 29 points last night
against Arizona State. The Cardinal will need continued produc
tion from the pair tomorrow against league-leading Arizona.
said of Kerr, "He never loses concen
tration, the kids respect him, and if
you give him an inch, he'll knock your
eyeballs out."
In the earlier meeting, the Wildcats
took away the Cardinal's inside game
and forced Stanford into a perimeter
shooting offense. Center John Edgar,
though only 6-foot-6, was the key,
holding Stanford center Howard
Wright scoreless for 17 minutes, until
Wright left the game with a sprained
ankle early in the second half.

At the other end, Elliot went inside
for the Wildcats and came away with
20 points. He is averaging 15.6 points
per game to lead Arizona.
For the Cardinal, freshman Todd
Lichti scored 19 points in the losing
effort. Earl Koberlein, who is out for
