# Card looks to break losing streak
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
The most astute basketball obser
ver could posit many reasons why the
Stanford women's basketball team
cannot seem to bring a halt to its cur
rent losing streak. In all his expertise,
this same hoops aficionado, however,
would never dream that amnesia was
the real reason behind the five-game
skid.
"You kind of forget how to win, or
think of how it felt to win," guard
Virginia Sourlis said after Stanford's
latest defeat, Saturday's loss to the
Arizona Wildcats in Arizona.
With «f»ven games left in the

season, six of them against teams that
have already beaten the Cardinal,
Stanford needs to take a quick re
fresher course in winning or it may be
in danger of posting its third con
secutive below .500 season.
In her final season at Stanford,
Sourlis is the only starter who would
remember when the Cardinal last
enjoyed a winning season, a 19-16
record in the 1982-83 campaign, her
freshman year.
There's a sense of urgency when
Sourlis talks about her final days on
the Farm.
"This is my last year," Stanford's
career-assist leader said, "so there's

not that much time for me. It's not
difficult for me to get up for a game."
Due to an illness, she had to miss
most of Stanford's practices this
week, but you can bet that when the
Cardinal suits up against the Fresno
State Bulldogs tomorrow night at
Maples Pavilion, Sourlis will be ready
to play.
Stanford (11-10) will attempt to
avenge a 64-50 loss to the Bulldogs in
the championship game of the
Nevada-Reno Invitational Tourna
ment in Reno last January.
According to Sourlis, Fresno State
will undoubtedly test Stanford's
outside shooting game.

"They're going to play a 3-2
(defense), so people are going to have
to be shooters," she said. "Teams are
thinking that a 3-2 zone is the way to
play Stanford, and they have been
successful. We're going to have to
learn how to beat the 3-2. We have to
start putting them in from the cor
ners."
The Cardinal corners belong to for
ward Kami Anderson. Since return
ing from a stress fracture 12 games
ago, the 6-foot-1 sophomore has
averaged 1 1 points per game for the
Cardinal. In a recent conference
game against the fifth-ranked USC
Trojans, Anderson contributed a
game-high IK points for the Stanford.
