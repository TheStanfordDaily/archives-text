# Gymnasts host Cardinal Classic
## 
### TRACY POTTER Staff writer 
For women's gymnastics fans, the 1986 Cardinal
Classic promises to be quite a show.
The teams competing tonight at 7:45 in Maples
Pavilion include Stanford, Fullerton State, Oregon
and the defending Canadian national champion,
the University of Alberta.
And some of the stiffest competition should
come from the Titans, according to Stanford Coach
Homer Sardina. "Fullerton has not been out of the
top three (nationally) — except for last year when
they finished sixth — in the last 10 years," he said.
"They have great recruiting, four to five coaches
and work out six hours a day."
Leading the Fullerton squad will be senior AII-
American and 1985 Western Collegiate Athletic

Association all-around champion Taunia Rogers
and junior Tami Elliot, a top American finisher in
the World University Games.
Oregon also boasts some talented gymnasts, in
cluding freshman Nicky Eden, whose top all
around score this year is a 37.75.
"Eden's top all-around score is higher than Lisa
Zeis'," Sardina said. "Oregon could be a threat."
ASU's Zeis swept the all-around competition at the
Cardinal's first home meet last weekend.
Alberta's mainstay seems to be its experience.
The squad is dominated by seniors and is "much
older than ours," Sardina said. "But they have less
depth."
Despite the lack of experience, Stanford still
promises to have some fine performances tonight.
Competing for the all-around title will be sopho
more Alison McGann and freshmen Cheryl Doo

and Sheri Evenson.
Freshman Jinny Rhee, who scored the highest
Stanford all-around total this year (35.85) in last
Friday's meet against ASU, will probably not com
pete in the all-around tonight due to a minor ankle
injury. "We know she'll work (uneven) bars
though," Sardina said.
"The key for us tonight is whether or not we hit
bars. If we hit bars, I think we can hit (the balance)
beam," he said. "And like every meet, I expect us
to hit bars. 1 still think we're capable of scoring a
180."
The status of talented sophomore Beth Pope is
still unknown. Injured in a floor exercise routine at
UCLA two weeks ago, Pope will undergo knee sur
gery some time next week. "We've really got until
April, and there's a distinct possibility that she can
come back." Sardina said.
