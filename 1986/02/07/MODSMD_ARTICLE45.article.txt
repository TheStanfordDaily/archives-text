# Fencers joust UCSC

### LISA MARTINEZ Staff writer 
The calendar has changed since
the Cardinal fencing teams last
faced UC-Santa Cruz, but the
song Stanford Coach Buzz Hurst
has been singing has not.
The men's and women's fencing
teams will travel to Santa Cruz for
a rematch tomorrow at 1 p.m., and
as usual, Hurst and his club are
confident of victory.
"This is the same team we
defeated a month ago," Hurst
said, "but they were missing their
top epee fencer, Bryn Kanar. He'll
give them added strength in epee
and will certainly make it more of
a challenge for our epee team."
However, Hurst doesn't believe
that this will affect the outcome of
the match. "Our sabre team is
much better than last time." Hurst
said. "Goorno, Levitan and
Cramer comprise a sabre team
that is head and shoulders above
anyone else in the region. 1 don't
think that their added strength in
epee will make up for our strength
in sabre.
"The interesting matchups will
be between the two men's foil
teams. Santa Cruz beat us 5-4 in
foil the last time we fenced them,
but that was after Chris Gillen quit
and the foil team was regaining
their identity," Hurst said.
Gillen, one of the team's top
fencers, decided to leave the team
shortly after the beginning of this
quarter.

"With the added experience of
two major weekends and eight or
nine tough opponents, I think our
foil team will beat them this time,'
Hurst said. "It won't be easy, but I
certainly don't anticipate any diffi
culty."
Elliott Cheu, men's foil captain,
has been a major force behind the
team's success, and last weekend,
he took second in the Piller Open
Foil Championships, the most
prestigious tournament in the bay
area, according to Hurst.
"He incurred his only loss
against a former U.S. National
champ," Hurst said.
Hurst also has little doubt about
the success of the women's team in
this matchup. "They defeated
Santa Cruz 13-3 earlier this
season, and they have gotten much
stronger over the past month," he
said. "Jennifer Yu, women's foil
captain, is 42-0 on the season.
Holly Taylor, our No. 2, is 36-4
and Alison Reid, No. 3, is 37-6."
Hurst said he is extremely
pleased with Alyson Yarus, holder
of the "crucial" No. 4 spot. "She is
the unsung heroine of the
women's team. With a record of
21-18, she's won over 50 percent
of her bouts in a job that only re
quires a 25 percent success rate.
"We're also going to try to sub
stitute as much as we can to give
our two newcomers, Vickie Levin
and Vered Sharon, some experi
ence," Hurst added.
