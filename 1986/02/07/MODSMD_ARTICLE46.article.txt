Gorbachev meets with Kennedy
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev told Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.) today that the next Soviet-American summit must
produce practical results in arms control or it would make no sense.
Gorbachev's view was reported by Tass, the official news agency, after
Kennedy met with the Kremlin chief on nuclear disarmament and other
issues.
Mere recognition of the danger of a nuclear war no longer is enough,
Gorbachev was quoted by Tass as telling his American visitor.
Gorbachev agreed at last November's summit meeting with President
Reagan in Geneva to hold a second meeting this year in the United
States. No date has been set for the second summit, however.
Kennedy, who was a presidential contender in 1980 but has taken
himself out of contention for the 1988 race, is on a three-day visit to
Moscow as a guest of the Soviet parliament. He told reporters in ad
vance he would not comment in Moscow on the meeting with Gorba
chev.
Before meeting Gorbachev, the senator praised exiled nuclear
physicist Andrei Sakharov at a meeting with scientists during which he
also said that the United States and the Soviet Union were on the verge
of a "decisive breakthrough" in arms control.
Kennedy saluted Sakharov, who was banished to the city of Gorky in
1980 after years of campaigning for human-rights causes, during a talk
at the elite Academy of Sciences.
Sakharov, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 but is now almost
never mentioned in the Soviet Union, has kept his membership in the
academy despite his removal from Moscow.
Pik Botha forsees political change
CAPE TOWN, South Africa — Foreign Minister Roelof "Pik" Botha,
defending the South African government's proposed political reforms,
said yesterday that his country could be governed in the future by a black
president provided there is an agreement protecting the rights of the
white minority.
Botha, going further than any Cabinet minister has dared to go before,
said he saw a black-led government as the "inevitable result in the
future" if President Pieter Botha's new proposals on power-sharing are
accepted by South Africa's black majority and become the basis for a
new constitutional system.
As for himself. Foreign Minister Botha told foreign correspondents,
he would have "no objection whatsoever" to serving under a black pres
ident. "If it is in terms of structures jointly agreed, how can 1 be
opposed?" he asked.
Other Cabinet ministers and President Botha himself have empha
sized the far-reaching nature of the new proposals, put before the South
African Parliament here last week. But until the foreign minister spoke
up yesterday, none had been willing to accept that this country, ruled by
whites for three centuries, could have a black-majority government.
"As long as we can agree in a suitable way on the protection of
minority rights without a racial sting," the foreign minister said, "then it
would possibly become unavoidable that in the future you might have a
black president of this country. If blacks share in the power of this
country, that to me becomes the inevitable result in the future, as long as
the minorities feel safe."
What his government opposes, he continued, is any system, especially
one-man, one-vote in a unitary state where blacks outnumber whites
five to one, that does not include "full protection of minorities."
This would include preservation of their residential areas, school sys
tems and other cultural facilities, all presumably racially segregated, and
a constitutional guarantee ensuring that the majority would not overrule
their agreed political rights.
Arabs condemn Israeli interception
AMMAN, Jordan — A wave of outrage swept through the Arab
world Wednesday, uniting moderate states with radicals in denunciation
of the Israeli interception of a Libyan executive jet.
There was also significant condemnation of the incident from
America's European allies.
British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe said the interception of the
Libyan jet by Israeli fighters Tuesday "was without justification." Howe
said the action "sets a dangerous precedent which appears to have been
in contravention of international law."
The Belgian government also criticized the Israeli action, but said it
also condemns "all actions that have helped create a climate which
allows such events."
The Arab world, which is normally divided into bickering factions by
most issues, showed rare unanimity in condemning the interception as an
act of air piracy.
The Libyan Grumman Gulfstream II jet, with Syrian and Lebanese
passengers returning to Syria from a conference in Tripoli, Libya, was
intercepted near Cyprus Tuesday, under the mistaken belief that Pales
tinian guerrilla leaders were on board. It was forced to land at an Israeli
air base, where it was held for five hours before being released to con
tinue on to Damascus.
Syrian officials immediately assumed a leadership role in condemning
the hijacking. "This hijacking is new evidence of the state terrorism
practiced by Israel since its inception," said Abdulla Ahmar, the assis
tant secretary general of Syria's ruling Baath Party, who was the top
ranking passenger on the diverted jet.
Spy exchange to occur next week
WARSAW, Poland — A major East-West spy exchange will take
place Tuesday, Polish government spokesman Jerzy Urban told Western
newsmen here yesterday.
In reply to a question. Urban confirmed that the exchange, which
reportedly would involve the prominent Soviet dissident Anatoly
Shcharansky, "will take place next Tuesday."
He said that a Pole, Lt. Col. Jerzy Kaczmarek, who was arrested last
March in West Germany, would be one of those freed.
Iranian attack on tanker kills six
MANAMA, Bahrain — Four crewmen were killed and two others
seriously injured yesterday in the worst tanker attack in the Persian Gulf
so far this year.
The attack, believed to be carried out by Iranian helicopters, left the
21,500-ton Maltese tanker Avocat in flames about 60 miles northeast of
Oatar.
The official Oatar news agency said 33 survivors had been picked up
by a ship sailing in the vicinity while Oatar air force rescue teams
plucked two Filipino seamen out of the water. Both were hospitalized in
serious condition, it said.
Lloyds of London, the British insurance firm, reported earlier that
four crew members had been killed in the missile attack. The four, offi
cially listed as missing, were Indian nationals. •
Gulf shipping sources said the helicopters had apparently been aiming
to kill, in contrast to a dozen ship attacks by Iraq and Iran since the
beginning of January that caused only slight damage and no casualties.
The nature of the attack marked a nasty twist in the tanker vendetta
between Iran and Iraq, which in recent months had been little more than
a nuisance to each other's shipping traffic.
Iraq is widely believed, however, to have succeeded last month in dis
rupting Iran's vital Ganaveh pipelines, which feed the main export ter
minal at Kharg Island.
The Iranians have retaliated by a new round of ship attacks on the
Arab side of the Gulf, directed mainly against ships frequenting Saudi
and Kuwaiti ports.

serious condition, it said.
Lloyds of London, the British insurance firm, reported earlier that
four crew members had been killed in the missile attack. The four, offi
cially listed as missing, were Indian nationals. •
Gulf shipping sources said the helicopters had apparently been aiming
to kill, in contrast to a dozen ship attacks by Iraq and Iran since the
beginning of January that caused only slight damage and no casualties.
The nature of the attack marked a nasty twist in the tanker vendetta
between Iran and Iraq, which in recent months had been little more than
a nuisance to each other's shipping traffic.
Iraq is widely believed, however, to have succeeded last month in dis
rupting Iran's vital Ganaveh pipelines, which feed the main export ter
minal at Kharg Island.
The Iranians have retaliated by a new round of ship attacks on the
Arab side of the Gulf, directed mainly against ships frequenting Saudi
and Kuwaiti ports.
Gorbachev meets with Kennedy
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev told Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.) today that the next Soviet-American summit must
produce practical results in arms control or it would make no sense.
Gorbachev's view was reported by Tass, the official news agency, after
Kennedy met with the Kremlin chief on nuclear disarmament and other
issues.
Mere recognition of the danger of a nuclear war no longer is enough,
Gorbachev was quoted by Tass as telling his American visitor.
Gorbachev agreed at last November's summit meeting with President
Reagan in Geneva to hold a second meeting this year in the United
States. No date has been set for the second summit, however.
Kennedy, who was a presidential contender in 1980 but has taken
himself out of contention for the 1988 race, is on a three-day visit to
Moscow as a guest of the Soviet parliament. He told reporters in ad
vance he would not comment in Moscow on the meeting with Gorba
chev.
Before meeting Gorbachev, the senator praised exiled nuclear
physicist Andrei Sakharov at a meeting with scientists during which he
also said that the United States and the Soviet Union were on the verge
of a "decisive breakthrough" in arms control.
Kennedy saluted Sakharov, who was banished to the city of Gorky in
1980 after years of campaigning for human-rights causes, during a talk
at the elite Academy of Sciences.
Sakharov, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 but is now almost
never mentioned in the Soviet Union, has kept his membership in the
academy despite his removal from Moscow.
Pik Botha forsees political change
CAPE TOWN, South Africa — Foreign Minister Roelof "Pik" Botha,
defending the South African government's proposed political reforms,
said yesterday that his country could be governed in the future by a black
president provided there is an agreement protecting the rights of the
white minority.
Botha, going further than any Cabinet minister has dared to go before,
said he saw a black-led government as the "inevitable result in the
future" if President Pieter Botha's new proposals on power-sharing are
accepted by South Africa's black majority and become the basis for a
new constitutional system.
As for himself. Foreign Minister Botha told foreign correspondents,
he would have "no objection whatsoever" to serving under a black pres
ident. "If it is in terms of structures jointly agreed, how can 1 be
opposed?" he asked.
Other Cabinet ministers and President Botha himself have empha
sized the far-reaching nature of the new proposals, put before the South
African Parliament here last week. But until the foreign minister spoke
up yesterday, none had been willing to accept that this country, ruled by
whites for three centuries, could have a black-majority government.
"As long as we can agree in a suitable way on the protection of
minority rights without a racial sting," the foreign minister said, "then it
would possibly become unavoidable that in the future you might have a
black president of this country. If blacks share in the power of this
country, that to me becomes the inevitable result in the future, as long as
the minorities feel safe."
What his government opposes, he continued, is any system, especially
one-man, one-vote in a unitary state where blacks outnumber whites
five to one, that does not include "full protection of minorities."
This would include preservation of their residential areas, school sys
tems and other cultural facilities, all presumably racially segregated, and
a constitutional guarantee ensuring that the majority would not overrule
their agreed political rights.
Arabs condemn Israeli interception
AMMAN, Jordan — A wave of outrage swept through the Arab
world Wednesday, uniting moderate states with radicals in denunciation
of the Israeli interception of a Libyan executive jet.
There was also significant condemnation of the incident from
America's European allies.
British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe said the interception of the
Libyan jet by Israeli fighters Tuesday "was without justification." Howe
said the action "sets a dangerous precedent which appears to have been
in contravention of international law."
The Belgian government also criticized the Israeli action, but said it
also condemns "all actions that have helped create a climate which
allows such events."
The Arab world, which is normally divided into bickering factions by
most issues, showed rare unanimity in condemning the interception as an
act of air piracy.
The Libyan Grumman Gulfstream II jet, with Syrian and Lebanese
passengers returning to Syria from a conference in Tripoli, Libya, was
intercepted near Cyprus Tuesday, under the mistaken belief that Pales
tinian guerrilla leaders were on board. It was forced to land at an Israeli
air base, where it was held for five hours before being released to con
tinue on to Damascus.
Syrian officials immediately assumed a leadership role in condemning
the hijacking. "This hijacking is new evidence of the state terrorism
practiced by Israel since its inception," said Abdulla Ahmar, the assis
tant secretary general of Syria's ruling Baath Party, who was the top
ranking passenger on the diverted jet.
Spy exchange to occur next week
WARSAW, Poland — A major East-West spy exchange will take
place Tuesday, Polish government spokesman Jerzy Urban told Western
newsmen here yesterday.
In reply to a question. Urban confirmed that the exchange, which
reportedly would involve the prominent Soviet dissident Anatoly
Shcharansky, "will take place next Tuesday."
He said that a Pole, Lt. Col. Jerzy Kaczmarek, who was arrested last
March in West Germany, would be one of those freed.
Iranian attack on tanker kills six
MANAMA, Bahrain — Four crewmen were killed and two others
seriously injured yesterday in the worst tanker attack in the Persian Gulf
so far this year.
The attack, believed to be carried out by Iranian helicopters, left the
21,500-ton Maltese tanker Avocat in flames about 60 miles northeast of
Oatar.
The official Oatar news agency said 33 survivors had been picked up
by a ship sailing in the vicinity while Oatar air force rescue teams
plucked two Filipino seamen out of the water. Both were hospitalized in
serious condition, it said.
Lloyds of London, the British insurance firm, reported earlier that
four crew members had been killed in the missile attack. The four, offi
