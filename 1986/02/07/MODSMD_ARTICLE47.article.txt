# Fraud mars Philippine voting
## 
### 
MANILA, Philippines — Four
people were killed stealing ballot
boxes, the government said, and a
military alert was extended when mil
lions of Filipinos voted today for a
president — Ferdinand Marcos, ruler
for 20 years, or Corazon Aquino,
widow of his assassinated rival.
A military "red alert" due to run
out at noon was extended indefinitely
to deal with the violence and cheat
ing.
Even befoit the polls opened at 7
a.m., both sidss reported fraud and
harassment. There were stories of
men brandishing rifles and firing in
the air to scare waiting voters, stolen
ballot boxes and votes being bought
for as little as $1.
"It's a mess, fraud all over," said
Ching Montinola, a press spokes
woman at Aquino headquarters.
Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.),
chairman of a U.S. presidential
delegation sent to observe the voting,
toured Tarlac and Pampanga
provinces north of Manila this morn
ing and encountered dozens of
reports of what he called
"administrative irregularities."
Some missing ballots were re
ported, and there were allegations
that some poll watchers were in
timidated by pro-Marcos paramilitary
troops and that soldiers were being
transported in troop trucks from poll
ing place to polling place, voting at
each.
The stakes for the United States
are high. The two military bases here,
Clark and Subic, are the largest U.S.
overseas bases. There has also been
increasing concern within the Reagan
Administration about Marcos' com
mitment to major economic and mili
tary reforms needed to combat a
spreading communist insurgency and
slumping economy that have left the
Philippines far behind its neighbors in
Southeast Asia.
Amid tensions that appear to be
peaking after a bitter two-month
campaign, the armed forces yesterday
went on "red alert" throughout the
country with an officially announced
mission to ensure orderly and peace
ful voting. Opposition spokesmen re
ported activities by armed groups in

several parts of the country allegedly
involving preparations for cheating
and intimidation of voters.
Polls opened at 7 a.m. yesterday (3
p.m. PST) and closed at 3 p.m. (11
p.m. PST) in 86,023 voting places.
Voting is by paper ballot and official
election results are proclaimed by the
National Assembly. A citizens'
watchdog group that is conducting an
unofficial "quick count" expects to
announce returns as they come in,
with at least half the vote expected to
be counted by early evening.
The government's quick count,
being managed by the Commission
on Elections, will be tabulated in a
gleaming auditorium at the Interna
tional Convention Center beside
Manila Bay. The floor of the room is
lined with 105 new personal com
puters, bought in Taiwan at $1,200
each. In one section stand 19 telex
machines to receive vote reports from
the provinces. Electronic display
boards will record the results.
Across the city at La Salle College
in Greenhills, the private tabulators
of the National Citizens Movement
for Free Elections (NAMFREL) will
count the vote in simpler surround
ings.
Operating about 100 IBM PCs on
loan from private companies, the
group's volunteers will record the
vote and mark the running results on
tally boards along the walls.
"These will be parallel and simulta
neous operations," said Danze
Santos, finance chairman for the
citizens group, on an inspection visit
to the government quick-count
headquarters. "I feel comfortable
with the arrangements. Otherwise we
would not have gotten together" to
share data reported from provincial
voting centers.
At La Salle, however, Christian
Monsod, the group's secretary gen
eral, was wary of potential problems.
He said his operation will switch to its
own power source on election night
"as a precaution."
At the election commission's oper
ation, Hermengildo Estrella, a con
sultant from First Data Corp., des
cribed how the computer program
would watch for signs of fraud.

"If there is a discrepancy, the
screen will blink at the operator," he
said. The computer is programmed to
catch:
An unlisted precinct reporting
votes, a precaution against so-called
"ghost precincts," fictitious polling
place.
Precincts reporting their totals
twice or more.
Totals exceeding the number of
registered voters in a precinct.
"Statistical improbabilities," — for
instance, a precinct's total votes
exceeding the expected turnout.
Estrella said the citizens group
across town probably has
programmed similar checks. But as of
Wednesday, he said, neither side had
seen the other's programming.
The efforts to prevent fraud will be
concentrated in the polling and
tabulation centers across the country.
Besides poll monitors from
NAMFREL and the candidates' sup
porters. there are one group of inter
national observers and a 20-member
official delegation from the United
States.
"There is a 50-50 chance of these
elections being clean and honest,"
said Jose Concepcion Jr., chairman of
the citizens group.
The armed forces deputy chief of
staff, Lt. Gen. Fidel Ramos, said
Thursday that 51 persons had been
killed since Dec. 6 in 103 incidents of
election-related violence. He said
81,000 soldiers and police had been
deployed to safeguard the election,
which is subject to disruption in more
than 3,000 "hot spots" in 65 of the
archipelago's 74 provinces.
Each side is predicting victory in
the poll, the first genuine presidential
election to be held in the Philippines
in nearly 17 years. The election
comes at a time of "unprecedented
crisis" in the Philippines and entails
both enormous risks and significant
opportunities for its democratic insti
tutions, according to a recent report
to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
Political turmoil has continued un
abated since the 1983 assassination of
opposition leader Benigno Aquino,
the economy remains mired in its

worst crisis since World War 11, and
the communist insurgency aims to
pull the country out of its alliance
with the United States and dismantle
the two U.S. bases here.
"Cory" Aquino, the widow of
Benigno Aquino, blames these prob
lems squarely on what she calls 20
years of Marcos' pharoah-like rule
and asserts that her moral leadership
will turn the situation around.
Marcos called the early election
more than a year before his current
term is due to expire to "seek a new
mandate" for his beleaguered leader
ship. After initially acknowledging
that "the issue is Marcos," he began
attacking his opponent as a political
neophyte who would lead the country
of 54 million people into chaos and
communism.
Believing this strategy to have been
effective, Marcos' ruling New Society
Movement forecasts a comfortable
win for the president with 56 percent
of the vote. Marcos' running mate is
Arturo Tolentino.
The opposition predicts a
"landslide" for Aquino with 60 to 70
percent of the vote, but warns that
the election could be stolen for
Marcos through massive fraud. She is
running with former Sen. Salvador
Laurel. Independent observers agree
that much will depend on the ability
of Marcos' vaunted political machine,
built up in the 1970s while he ruled
the country under martial law, to
deliver the vote through its control of
patronage and the various levers of
power.
On the eve of the election the op
position charged that moves were
already under way to stuff ballot
boxes, switch electoral returns, in
timidate voters and thwart the poll
watching activities of the independent
citizens' group. The new charges
buttressed a statement yesterday by
the archbishop of Manila, Cardinal
Jaime Sin, that "terrible stories"
about the election campaign caused
him to wonder whether Filipinos
were facing a presidential election or
a "contest between good and the
forces of evil." Sin called the election
"the most crucial in the nation's his
tory."
