Offshore leases limited
WASHINGTON — Secretary of the Interior
Donald Hodel, under pressure from conser
vationists and California congressmen, an
nounced a revised offshore oil leasing program
yesterday that eliminates or defers lease sales in
28 areas of scenic beauty or of doubtful mineral
value.
Eleven newly excluded areas are off Califor
nia, while the remainder lie along the Atlantic
coast or just beyond the shores of Alaska, Wash
ington. Oregon, Texas and Louisiana.
In announcing revisions to a lai jer leasing plan
he proposed last March. Hodel said he would
continue consultations with an 18-member con
gressional delegation from California and other
coastal states to resolve the sensitive issue of how
to further limit offshore exploration.
"I have kept faith with opponents of offshore
oil drilling in California," he told a news confer
ence in explaining that he was excluding areas
both north and south of Santa Cruz and Santa
Rosa islands, off Ventura County in Southern
California.
Farther north, other excluded areas are adja
cent to San Francisco Bay and Monterey Bay, of
fshore from Big Sur and in the vicinity of Cordell
Bank and the Point Reyes Wilderness Area north
of San Francisco. Because of Navy anti
submarine weapons testing, an area southwest of
San Nicolas Island, off Orange County in South
ern California, also is being excluded from oil
leasing. Hodel said.

FA A orders inspections
WASHINGTON — The Federal Aviation Ad
ministration yesterday ordered the nation's
airlines to begin inspecting a widely used Pratt &
Whitney jet engine for possible cracks that could
lead to a rupture of the outer case of the combus
tion chamber.
The FAA directive applies to most versions of
Pratt & Whitney's JTBD engine, the basic engine
used by virtually all major U.S. airlines for their
Boeing 727, Boeing 737 or DC-9 aircraft.
Fatigue in high-stress areas could cause cracks
and rupture the case, leading to engine shut
downs in flight, release of the engine cowling or
damage to the airframe, the FAA's airworthiness
directive said.
Budget bill scrutinized
WASHINGTON — As federal agencies
grudgingly earmarked the first $11.7 billion in
spending cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction act, a three-judge panel
prepared to decide today whether to undo their
labors — and very likely spark a political panic —
by ruling the law unconstitutional.
The ruling of the U.S. District Court panel,
which automatically will be appealed to the Su
preme Court, opens what some call the most
ominous legal battle between the White House

and Congress since the Watergate era.
Constitutional experts, led by Harvard Law
School Prof. Laurence Tribe, call that
characterization "a grotesque exaggeration." But
if one measures its impact on people instead of
the law books, Tribe and others conceded yester
day, the Gramm-Rudman decision could well be
historic.
In its ruling today, the special panel likely will
decide only narrow questions. One is whether
Congress violated the Constitution s checks and
balances on the three branches of government by
granting control of the budget-cutting machinery
to three unelected officials: the White House
budget director, the head of the Congressional
Budget Office and the comptroller general.
Market tops magic 1,600
NEW YORK — Stock prices crossed another
symbolic milestone yesterday when the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials finished above the
1,600-point level for the first time, but the
broader market showed a mixed performance
and some analysts said Wall Street ended its ses
sion in an uncertain mood.
After a seesaw day in which the Dow Jones in
dustrials swung more than 20 points, Wall
Street's best-known indicator closed at 1,600.69,
up 7.57, breaking the previous record of
1,594.27 set on Monday.
