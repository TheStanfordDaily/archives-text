Toxic waste plan passed
SACRAMENTO — The Legislature yesterday
sent Gov. George Deukmejian a toxics agency
reorganization plan he says he'll veto, while the
Assembly killed the governor's rival plan because
its regulatory board would be industry
dominated.
Sen. Art Torres of Los Angeles, author of the
Democratic reorganization bill, called Deuk
mejian's management of toxic programs "a dis
aster and getting worse every day. . .. We have
inaction, indecision and perhaps malfeasance,"
he said, referring to an FBI probe of the pro
gram.
"This bill is a political statement," said Assem
bly Republican Leader Patrick Nolan of
Glendale. "It is not a serious attempt to deal with
the toxic problems of our state."
The votes to send Torres' bill, SB 1048. to the
governor were 44-25 in the Assembly and 21-18
in the Senate. The Assembly vote was along
party lines, but in the Senate four members of the
Democratic majority — Ruben Ayala of Chino,
Henry Mello of Watsonville, Robert Presley of

Riverside and Walter Stiern of Bakersfield —
voted against the bill.
The Assembly then voted 44-29, also along
party lines, to reject the governor's plan, known
as Governor's Reorganization Plan No. 2. That
plan would have automatically taken effect Sun
day, if not rejected. Only one house needs to
reject a governor's plan to reorganize part of the
executive branch to prvent the plan from going
into effect.
Fiedler publicizes tapes
LOS ANGELES — Tapes used to indict Rep.
Bobbi Fiedler revealed no specific offer to pay a
GOP Senate rival's campaign debts in exchange
for his withdrawal from the race. But her top aide
is heard discussing how to provide funds he called
"help" rather than payment.
Fiedler (R-Calif.) and aide Paul Garke, her
fiance, are to enter pleas today to the Jan. 23 in
dictment alleging they offered to cover state Sen.
Ed Davis' $100,000 campaign debt in return for
his dropping out of the June GOP primary.

The tapes, which Fiedler released Wednesday,
were secretly recorded by Davis' campaign
manager, Martha Zilm.
On them, Fiedler says she did not have in mind
a direct exchange of money for Davis'
withdrawal. But the tapes contain no clear state
ment of her contention that she believed Davis
had decided to drop out before any offer was
made, rendering the legal issue moot.
The tapes also appear to contradict Zilm's con
tention that she never led the Fiedler campaign
to believe Davis had decided to withdraw.
Prosecutors say an initial offer was made in
October or early November 1985, when Fiedler
supporter Arthur Pfefferman phoned Davis
backer George Moss. With the district attorney
involved, conversations were recorded between
Nov. 25 and Jan. 12.
