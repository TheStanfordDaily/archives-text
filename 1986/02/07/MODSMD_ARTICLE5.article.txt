The tax reform package now pending in the U.S. Senate
may have damaging effects on Stanford, University offi
cials warned at yesterday's meeting of the Faculty Senate.
Approved by the U.S. House of Representatives Dec.
17, the tax reform measure would be especially damaging
amid the "specter" of reduced federal support for educa
tion as Stanford and other institutions grapple with the ef
fects of the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing amend
ment, according to Robert Freelen, University vice
president of public affairs.
Back from a trip to Washington to sound out congres
sional opinion on issues important to Stanford, Freelen
said Congress was under "enormous pressure" from Pres
ident Reagan and the public to produce a tax reform
package that is fair, simple and revenue neutral.
Language in the tax reform measure now being consid
ered by the Senate Finance Committee includes restric
tions on the ability of private colleges and universities to
issue tax-exempt revenue bonds, increased taxation of
charitable gifts of appreciated assets and new regulations
on pension programs. The measure reclassifies some
forms of student scholarships and financial aid as taxable
income.
If the Congress does not successfully meet the first-year
deficit limit of $50 billion, the automatic budget-cutting
effects of the Gramm-Rudman amendment would pose
"severe consequences" for the University, said Larry
Horton, associate vice-president for public affairs.
Although the cuts are not specifically targeted at pro
grams important to research universities, Horton said a
majority of these programs are included in the 25 percent
portion of the budget subject to cuts. Notable exceptions
are Department of Defense and Department of Energy
research, categories where budget increases are an
ticipated.
Freelan said new legislative initiatives by state and local
governments may also adversely affect the University. In
Sacramento, the state Assembly is now considering legis
lation giving private citizens the right to inspect animal re
search facilities, a restructuring of the Cal Grant scholar
ship program and revisions in medical insurance and toxic
waste policies, he said.
University officials said they will work in close coopera
tion with various university and educational associations
as well as conduct personal meetings with government of
ficials to voice their concern over the effects of these
proposals.
The senate also heard a report from the Committee on
Libraries presented by History Prof. Judith Brown. Major
items of the report included continued conversion to the
Socrates computerized card catalogue and the eventual
automation of the entire library system.
The Stanford library system currently holds over 5.3
