# University, USW differ on contract interpretation

leaders are "beginning to identify
problems" with the the interpretation
of the three-month-old contract be
tween the University and the union,
according to Assoc. Staff Counsel
Mary Ann Tenuto.
"Problems are just beginning. We
don't know how big they will be,"
Tenuto said.
Tenuto, the union's chief
negotiator in last year's contract

talks, stressed that the USW has not
finished investigating complaints by
the bargaining unit. "At this point
we're not prepared to say that there is
a problem that can't be resolved," she
said.
Staff Counsel Priscilla Wheeler,
chief negotiator for the University
last year, agreed that there have been
no glaring problems in the first three
months of the new contract. The Uni
versity is pleased with the fact that
"there have not been any serious
problems," she said.
In November, the bargaining unit

voted 457-185 to accept the contract
after a long period of negotiations. At
the time, USW leaders said they
would sign the contract but would
protest the implementation of the
more controversial clauses, including
those restricting job security and un
ion access to USW members during
working hours.
Tenuto said there had been few
problems regarding the job security
issue, except for some layoffs in the
computer center.
Union access, on the other hand, is
one of the problems that has cropped

up in the USW investigaton of worker
complaints, Tenuto said. "We are
concerned about representation
rights in the new contract," she
added.
Currently, union stewards cannot
leave their work area to visit other
USW members unless they are in
volved in a grievance procedure,
Tenuto said, adding that this is a new
reading of the contract language.
But the University disagrees that
there is a problem in the interpreta
tion of the contract.
The union "is saying that they

don't like it, but that's the agreement
we negotiated," Wheeler said.
The union has also raised questions
about the amount of time stewards
are allowed to leave work to speak
with union members and representa
tion for bargaining unit members in
grievance procedures. In both cases
the University says that the USW
concerns are not founded in the con
tract language.
"The University is proceeding un
der the language that we negotiated,"
Wheeler said.
But Tenuto said the two sides are
also having problems that were not
addressed in the contract negotia
tions.

One problem that has arisen, ac
cording to Tenuto, is the University's
refusal to schedule grievances for ar
bitration, the final step of the griev
ance procedure.
Wheeler defended the University's
arbitration policy, saying that the two
sides agreed to eliminate the backlog
of grievances from the old contract
before addressing new disagree
ments.
The University is also giving top
priority to any major grievance — a
firing, for example — regardless of
when it was filed, Wheeler said.
But Tenuto said the University's
reluctance to address current issues
showed the administration "doesn't
seem to have a willingness to solve
problems."
