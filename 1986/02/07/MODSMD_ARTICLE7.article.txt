### KENNETH FENYO Staff writer 
The United States will not negotiate with the
Nicaraguan government unless U.S. interests in the
region are secured, a Reagan Administration offi
cial said here last night.
William Brownfield, special assistant to the un
der secretary of state for Latin America and Car
ribean Affairs, said that the Nicaraguan govern
ment "is absolutely determined to maintain itself in
power."
Joining Brownfield in the discussion in Toyon
Hall was Ricardo Espinosa, a consular official for
the Nicaraguan Embassy in Washington, D.C., who
said that Nicaragua "is willing to establish dialogue
but on the basis of mutual respect and understand
ing."
Nicaragua is "not a communist government,"
Espinosa said, adding that the Sandinistas "present

a different alternative in which we (are) treated
with the respect all nations should have."
Espinosa said that the U.S. actions toward
Nicaragua are a form of state terrorism. .Stressing
the illegality of the U.S. support of the contras, he
said that the U.S. position in the Nicaraguan con
flict is not only inconsistent with the United Na
tions charter, but also with the internal laws of the
United States.
"What right has the United States to dictate in
ternal affairs in Nicaragua/' Espinosa asked, add
ing that the Latin American problem is one that
should be solved by Latin Americans.
Brownfield defended the U.S. support of the
contras, saying that they are fighting to change a
system which they view as intolerable.
"They are willing to kill and be killed." he said.
Brownfield said that any agreement between the
United States and Nicaragua would have to take
into account the grievances of the contras. "The

Sandinista government will have to make the deci
sion to talk to the people who are making war in
their countryside," he said.
Both Espinosa and Brownfield expressed the
hope that a diplomatic solution could be found to
the crisis in the region.
Espinosa said his country fully supported the
Contadora process â€” an effort by several Latin
American countries to establish peace in the
region.
Claiming that the United States forced other
Central American nations to object to the Con
tadora proposals, Espinosa blamed the Reagan
Administation for the failure of the Contadora
proposals made to date.
"The United States should refrain from influenc
ing these governments and try to lead them along
to find diplomatic solutions," he said.
