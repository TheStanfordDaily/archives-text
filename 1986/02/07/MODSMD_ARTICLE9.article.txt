# Can people rule themselves?
## Yale Prof, says U.S. has become a 'universal' democracy 
### CHRIS SAUCEDO 
'"Democracy, or rule by the people, can be justified
only on the assumption that ordinary people are qualified
to govern themselves," visiting Yale Political Science
Prof. Robert Dahl said here yesterday.
In the first annual Wesson lecture on the problems and
prospects of democracy, Dahl said all people are capable
of judging what affects their own interests and well-being.
"No person in general is a better judge of your own
good. Therefore, you should take care of yourself," he
said.
A past president of the American Political Science As
sociation, Dahl is a member of the National Academy of
Sciences, the American Philosophical Society and the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The Wesson
lecture is named in honor of Robert Wesson, a Hoover
senior research fellow who established the series.
Dahl said he believes that in every democracy, citizens
must meet an "acceptable standard" in order to partici
pate in decision making. He described the standard as the
ability of individuals to judge what is in their own self
interest. The way in which the standard is set makes the
society exclusive or universal by deciding which citizens
can take part in it.
According to Dahl, exclusive democracies are op
pressive because they prevent people who are capable of
self-judgement from participating in government. "The
validity and value of democracy depends on the range of
citizens involved," he said.
Dahl used the United States to illustrate the difference
between universal and exclusive democracies by saying
that until recently, this country was not a universal
democracy because it did not allow blacks or women to

vote. In contrast, the only citizens who cannot vote today
are those incapable of deciding what benefits them, such
as children and the mentally handicapped. Therefore, the
United States now qualifies as a universal democracy.
Dahl said democracies such as South Africa and North
ern Ireland are oppressive because a sizable proportion of
the population is not allowed to decide what is best for
themselves. These exclusive democracies ignore the prin
ciples of equal intrinsic worth — that all individuals are
equal regardless of race or gender — and personal
autonomy, or the idea that no one can govern for some
one else better than the individual would govern himself.
According to Dahl, exclusive democracies replace per
sonal autonomy with paternalistic authority. "After all, it
is surely reasonable to think that a great many people may
be confused or even mistaken about their own good," he
said. Unfortunately, there are few individuals who can
work successfully for others, and for these individuals it is
difficult to judge what is good for someone else, even
when they are children or mentally handicapped, he said.
Dahl said there is a "hierarchy of needs," — after basic
needs have been met — and it is difficult to decide which
are more important without having "an intimate knowl
edge of the self."
Making decisions for someone else is difficult because
the needs of an individual are difficult to understand and
continually shift, and conflicts between an individual's
wants and beliefs make decisions even more difficult, he
said.
"The individual has a knowledge of (himself) that is su
perior to others," Dahl said. "Would slaves and women
protect their own interests as well or better than others?"
He answered by saying that if people have equal and in
trinsic worth they should be taken into account equally
