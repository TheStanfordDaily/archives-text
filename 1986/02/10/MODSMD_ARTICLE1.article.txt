The University is "giving serious
consideration" to establishing an ad
visory body that would make policy
recommendations to the Stanford
Police Department, according to
ASSU Senate Chair Carey White.
A group of ASSU senators met
Friday with University President
Donald Kennedy, Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons and John
Schwartz, vice president and general
counsel, to discuss the formation of a
police review commission the senate
proposed in November.
White said Kennedy was "opposed
to a formal police review commis

that it "was a lot more responsive (to
the ASSU proposal) than we were ex

White said that the advisory board
would be "more of a liaison, not a
judiciary body. . . . The only power it
would have would be its resources."
Such resources would include staff
to organize meetings, write letters
and "publicize problems," White
said.
The board would "lobby the police
and (Santa Clara) county sheriff . . .
to get policies changed," White said.

White, the board probably would not
act on the charges of alleged brutality
against the Stanford Police Depart

Sheriffs Office. The charges stem
from the Oct. 11 and Oct. 14 arrests
of students protesting the Univer
sity's investments in South African
related companies.
White said he hopes the board
would "get the police to cooperate
with the goals of the community and
