# Police advisory board proposed
## 
### ALLISON HARTWELL Editorial staff 
The University is "giving serious
consideration" to establishing an ad
visory body that would make policy
recommendations to the Stanford
Police Department, according to
ASSU Senate Chair Carey White.
A group of ASSU senators met
Friday with University President
Donald Kennedy, Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons and John
Schwartz, vice president and general
counsel, to discuss the formation of a
police review commission the senate
proposed in November.
White said Kennedy was "opposed
to a formal police review commis
sion" because it would be seen as an
adversary to the police and
"counterproductive." Rather, Ken
nedy favored an advisory body that
would make positive suggestions to
the police, White said. Kennedy
declined to comment Friday.
Undergraduate Senator John Van
Loben Sels, who attended Friday's
meeting, said the administration
"didn't see a need for a committee as
we (the ASSU) saw it," but added
that it "was a lot more responsive (to
the ASSU proposal) than we were ex
pecting."
White said that the advisory board
would be "more of a liaison, not a
judiciary body. . . . The only power it
would have would be its resources."
Such resources would include staff
to organize meetings, write letters
and "publicize problems," White
said.
The board would "lobby the police
and (Santa Clara) county sheriff . . .
to get policies changed," White said.
According to Van Loben Sels and
White, the board probably would not
act on the charges of alleged brutality
against the Stanford Police Depart
ment and the Santa Clara County
Sheriffs Office. The charges stem
from the Oct. 11 and Oct. 14 arrests
of students protesting the Univer
sity's investments in South African
related companies.
White said he hopes the board
would "get the police to cooperate
with the goals of the community and
The board would contain represen
tatives of faculty, students, workers,
salaried staff and "ask for a lot of in
put from police," White said. It
would make recommendations "in
the fashion that (Law Prof. John)
Kaplan did," according to White, but
from a "broader base."
At the request of Kennedy, Kaplan
conducted an investigation in No

vember of the charges against the
Stanford police and the Santa Clara
County sheriff s officers.
Both members of the senate and
Kennedy will be ironing out a formal
structure for the board with a more
detailed description of its responsi
bilities and then will meet again this
week, White said.
Schwartz said that the discussion
"gravitated toward an advisory body"
but said nothing concrete was
decided.
The idea of establishing a board is
"very worthwhile thinking about,"

Schwartz said. However, it is "hard to
predict what's going to happen next
week."
According to Van Loben Sels, the
senate will postpone any action on
the board until Kennedy meets with
the senators.
White said the ASSU wants some
sort of police commission "so badly
that we may end up accepting a pep
squad," and said he hopes an advi
sory board would be taken seriously.
Lyons could not be reached for
comment last night.
