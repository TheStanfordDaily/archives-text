# Speaker says goal of racism is continuation of white race
## 
### CHRIS PAGE Staff writer 
Because only one-tenth of the world population is
white, the white race must attempt to dominate other
races to avoid genetic destruction, a noted black psychia
trist said Friday night at Annenberg Auditorium.
Dr. Francis Cress Welsing, author of "The Cress The
ory of Color Confrontation," told the audience that rac
ism is the "patterns of perceptions, language and actions
.. . the goal of which is white survival."
Welsing's speech was part of a panel discussion that
ended a day of activities at the Black Liberation Month
Conference. The event, held in Tresidder Union, was
sponsored by the Black Community Services Center
(BCSC).
Welsing said blacks do not understand the true reason
behind the racism that restricts their freedom.
Blacks greet each other with "What's happening?" be
cause "we don't know what's going on," she said.
Welsing said blacks must understand that the terms
"discrimination," "apartheid" and "prejudice" mean
"white supremacy."
"I'm not talking about hate, I'm talking about fact," she
said.
Black unemployment and lack of education, she said, is
a result of the white race's need to dominate. Blacks are

continually told they are at a disadvantage because of eco
nomic and educational factors, but, according to Welsing,
these result from the white fight for genetic survival.
"I respect the (Ku Klux Klan) and the Nazis," Welsing
said. "Not for their ideology, but for their willingness to
come out and say what the issue really is — white survival
against the insurgence of color."
"We cannot have white supremacy and have justice. . . .
One-tenth of the world population should not rule," she
said.
Welsing was joined in the discussion by Samuel Yette, a
professor of journalism at Howard University in Washing
ton, D.C., who said the black fight for civil rights in the
1960s was "a First Amendment revolution."
"The true value of the First Amendment is that a
minority view can become a majority view because the
minority is allowed to be heard," he said.
"We haven't cleared up everything," Yette said. "But
something has happened." As an example of progress, he
cited the fact that major U.S. cities, including Los Angeles
and Chicago, have black mayors.
Other speakers included Dr. Mary Rhodes Hoover,
professor of black studies at California State University at
Long Beach, and M'akhoba Maloba, a speaker at the
recent Bishop Desmond Tutu program at Stanford. Exiled
South African poet Dennis Brutus was scheduled to at
tend the conference but did not appear due to illness.
