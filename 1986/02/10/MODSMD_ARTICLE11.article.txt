After 28 years of Duvalier despots, Haiti has finally
embarked on the road to democracy. The corrupt
Duvalier dictatorships held Haiti in a stagnant state of
economic depression and political repression. When
tensions rose, vicious Tontons or "bogeymen" would
kill indiscriminately, and thousands would seek refuge
in the United States.
This pattern began to crumble as the recent unor
ganized uprisings screamed to a crescendo of in
tolerance for Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier's
depotism. In their usual manner, the bogeymen at
tempted to combat this dissent by randomly killing
protesters. Over 50 people have been killed in the past
two weeks in protests in Port-au-Prince. As it became
evident that the Duvalier regime was doomed, despite
Duvalier s President-for-Life title, the United States
prudently assisted in the transition of power. Foreign
aid was partially suspended and Duvalier was flown on
a U.S. Air Force jet to France under temporary
asylum.
The prospect for a democratic Haiti looks good.
Haiti is now controlled by a six-man council headed by
the Army Chief of Staff, Lieut. Gen. Henri Namphy,
who has stated that the military is not entertaining po

litical ambitions. The council, which includes two
civilians— the Minister of Public Works and the chair
man of the Haitian Human Rights Commission — has
freed over 20 political prisoners and has announced
the establishment of a 16-member cabinet to ad
ministrate Haiti until elections are held.
However, the transition period has been far from
perfect. Indeed, at least a dozen Ton tons were slain in
violent reprisals last Friday. One was reported to have
been burned and buried alive. Such vengeful displays
will only prove counterproductive to the quest to end
the terror that has reigned in Haiti. Namphy and the
Catholic Church have both called for "calm and
serenity." An American Embassy spokesman set the
goals of "economic development in the context of
respect for human rights."
The Haitian example of U.S. support for the benign
disposal of an unpopular despot should be the stan
dard. Quiet coups like this one in Haiti are always
preferred to covert military support for insurgents and
mercenaries. Our commitment to spreading democracy
has been successfully demonstrated in Haiti and we
must now meet the challenge of maintaining that
democracy.
