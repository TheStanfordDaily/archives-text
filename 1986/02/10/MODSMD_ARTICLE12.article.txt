Tutu speech film
should be shown
Last Tuesday night, we thought we
were going to sec a film of Bishop
Desmond Tutu's speech at Stanford.
We had learned about the film from
official Graduate Student Association
fliers that had been widely dis
tributed. We set aside time to see the
film, and we were particularly excited
because we had been unable to obtain
tickets to see him in person. Unfor
tunately, the University would not let
the Graduate Student Association
show the film.
We were outraged at being denied
the opportunity to see and hear this
Nobel Prize-winner's speech to the
Stanford community concerning
South Africa and how we as U.l>.
citizens and members of a U.S. uni
versity affect the situation there.
It seems particularly ironic that one
week the University would invite
Tutu and film his talk, and then the
next week deny people who were
unable to see him in person the
chance to see the film.
We hope the University will allow
and encourage students to see the
film in the future; however, this ex
perience in itself struck a blow to our
faith in Stanford's commitment to a
free and open academic communtiy.
In this case, a student group en
deavored to show the film and gave
advance notice on the fliers that there
would be a charge for admission. In
addition, the flier stated that the
proceeds would go to defend the per
sons who were arrested for sitting-in
at the administration building. We
feel this is within the Graduate Stu
dents Association's legitimate rights.
Furthermore, we feel it is the Uni
versity's responsibility to make the
film of Tutu's speech available to all
members of the Stanford community.
As another week goes by since Tutu's

speech, we and others are eagerly
waiting.

Non-activism
implies assent
Darieck Scott seems to have his no
tions of personal responsibility, social
responsibility and activism a bit
confused. He says: "Social responsi
bility is personal responsibility; if
what you do affects society, what you
do affects yourself." Such circular
reasoning distorts the simple fact that
what you do, or do not do, for that
matter, directly affects society.
Taking action on your beliefs and
goals for society w ill certainly have an
impact of some sort on the people
around you.
In the same way, taking no action
at all is a statement which spefcks just
as clearly as carrying banners.
Keeping in mind the various forms of
activism for social change, it is clear
that non-action, no matter how you
slice it, is complacency and accep
tance of the status quo. What good is
having a sense of social responsibility
when by non-action you
demonstratively accept the evils
which you claim to have a conscience
about? To answer one of Scott's
examples, one is not exonerated be
cause, when concentrating solely on
getting good grades, one plans to act
on one's belief in the future.
When speaking of acting in self
interest Scott writes: ". . . it is not
only possible to serve others while
serving yourself, it is almost
impossible not to do so." The absur
dity of this statement is rather striking
and will take only brief comment to
counter. Think for a moment about

the de-humanizing exploitation by
capitalists of workers in the Industrial
Revolution. Industrialists of the 19th
century were well aware of the
"content and consequences" of their
actions, just as corporations operat
ing today in South Africa know that
although apartheid is a crime against
black workers they will reap huge
profits from their labor and so cer
tainly serve their interest in profits. It
would be wonderful if everybody's
self interest coincided with what is
best for society as a whole, but then
there would be no need for social ac
tivism, would there?
Finally, 1 would like to say a few
words in response to Scott's insinua
tions about people involved in the
divestment/anti-apartheid movement
at Stanford. I have to say that 1 am
really getting tired of the complaints
of peer pressure and accusations of
insincerity which are leveled afc&taft-r
ford Out of South Africa (SOSA) by
people who are not at all acquainted
with the organization. If Scott knew
SOSA at all he would know that it is a
strong organization with nearly as
many fully committed participants as
it had in the spring last year. He
would know that within SOSA there
is great respect for the decision of
each individual as to the amount of
time and effort she/he is willing to
contribute and for the manner in
which that pei~son wishes to act.
Like Scott, people interested in
ending apartheid know that some
people are more comfortable with
one mode of action than another and
SOSA does not dictate the actions of
individuals. There is no question in
my mind that those active in SOSA
today participate out of a genuine vi
sion of social justice and I think it un
fair that Scott questions their convic -
tion without personal knowledge of
that about which he writes.
