## We must stop patronizing the Third World 
### 
I recently judged at a high school debate tourna
ment where students were given a Current events
topic and 30 minutes to prepare a speech.
As always. Central America was a hot topic. I ex
pected to see many speeches recommending a wide
range of U.S. policies for this troubled region. To
see these high schoolers" perspective on how to
make such decisions was a truly enlightening exper
ience — it taught me a great deal about the way the
mainstream news media can shape the entire
debate around a subject.

What did these students consider when judging
the advisability of our current policy? They talked
about U.S. security, about our strategic interests,
about Nicaragua being a Soviet puppet and El Sal
vador facing the same future if the FDR/FMLN
(the politico-military opposition) were to win. 1
guess it shouldn't surprise me — after all. they get
their information and perspective largely from
Time magazine and Newsweek, no champions of
oppressed people anywhere — but it shocked me to
hear an entire debate about the fate of the Central
American people without any discussion what
soever of what the people of Central America want
for themselves.
The American media now simply reiterates the
perspective of the Reagan Administration in its
characterization of events in El Salvador. The
FDR FMLN is portrayed as a puppet of Nicaragua.
Cuba and the Soviet Union: its base of support
among the population is denied or disguised. We.
the innocent readers unreasonably expecting some
objectivity, are led to believe the Department of

State's characterization of this group; they are
"interested only in obtaining power through brute
force." 1
Hut let's examine the origins of the FMLN to un
derstand it better. The groups that make up the
FMLN were born in response to the brutal repres
sion of the Catholic Church's attempts to organize
the rural population.
Change in El Salvador is desperately needed. A
Cornell University study estimated that it has the
highest percentage of landless and near-landless
people in the world. Unemployment in San Sal
vador runs at about 50 percent. Widespread il
literacy, poor health, lack of education and other
manifestations of abject poverty run rampant. To
begin resolving these conditions, the FMLN makes
just two demands before it will lay down its arms:
one. a restructuring of the army that has killed
thousands of civilians over the past six years; and
two. the right of all people to fully participate in the
political process so that elections will really be
meaningful. Do we really oppose such legitimate
demands?
It is from these people, the victims of an unjust
and rigid social order, that the FDR/FMLN gets its
support. The poor of El Salvador don't need a
Soviet to tell them that they have needs that aren't
being met. The FMLN survives becaue it responds
to popular needs. Guillermo Ungo. a former refor
mist who now is with the FDR said: "The Sal
vadoran war is a people's war, fought under ad
verse conditions, that can be sustained and ad
vanced only with the support of the people."
The FMLN's practice speaks for itself. Ml we
have to do is look at the "liberated zones.'' areas of
the country which are controlled by the guerrilla
forces. In these areas, the people govern them

selves. Free elections are held., Health and educa
tion arc the top priorities. People live without fear
of violence, at least when the government planes
aren't bombing them.
But again. I guess I really shouldn't be surprised
that the government and the media ignore the
popular support for the FMLN. \fter all, it's noth
ing new. We in the United States seem to have an
incredibly difficult time believing that the people of
the Third World can organize themselves and form
democratic, responsive political institutions in op
position to U.S. domination.
Resistance in South Africa? Must be the Soviets
stirring up some trouble. Blacks in the United
States making too much noise? Guess they've been
led astray again by Jesse Jackson and Louis Farrak
han. who seem to possess an uncanny ability to ma
nipulate crowds.
Our arrogance and paternalism is astounding.
Do we ever stop to think that maybe these people
have some legitimate demands? That maybe they
make their decisions all by themselves, just like
white grownups do. and they decided to oppose the
United States?
We must change the way that we look at move
ments for social change. Instead ol viewing every
thing as some sort of power game between the
United States and the Soviet Union, we need to
recognize the desire of the peoples of the Third
World for independence and self-determination.
This will require a radical change in our decision
making framework. First and foremost, we have to
stop intervening in countries like Fl Salvador and
let these people choose their own futures. They can
do it without our help.

tion arc the top priorities. People live without fear
of violence, at least when the government planes
aren't bombing them.
But again. I guess I really shouldn't be surprised
that the government and the media ignore the
popular support for the FMLN. \fter all, it's noth
ing new. We in the United States seem to have an
incredibly difficult time believing that the people of
the Third World can organize themselves and form
democratic, responsive political institutions in op
position to U.S. domination.
Resistance in South Africa? Must be the Soviets
stirring up some trouble. Blacks in the United
States making too much noise? Guess they've been
led astray again by Jesse Jackson and Louis Farrak
han. who seem to possess an uncanny ability to ma
nipulate crowds.
Our arrogance and paternalism is astounding.
Do we ever stop to think that maybe these people
have some legitimate demands? That maybe they
make their decisions all by themselves, just like
white grownups do. and they decided to oppose the
United States?
We must change the way that we look at move
ments for social change. Instead ol viewing every
thing as some sort of power game between the
United States and the Soviet Union, we need to
recognize the desire of the peoples of the Third
World for independence and self-determination.
This will require a radical change in our decision
making framework. First and foremost, we have to
stop intervening in countries like Fl Salvador and
let these people choose their own futures. They can
do it without our help.

I recently judged at a high school debate tourna
ment where students were given a Current events
topic and 30 minutes to prepare a speech.
As always. Central America was a hot topic. I ex
pected to see many speeches recommending a wide
range of U.S. policies for this troubled region. To
see these high schoolers" perspective on how to
make such decisions was a truly enlightening exper
ience — it taught me a great deal about the way the
mainstream news media can shape the entire
debate around a subject.

What did these students consider when judging
the advisability of our current policy? They talked
about U.S. security, about our strategic interests,
about Nicaragua being a Soviet puppet and El Sal
vador facing the same future if the FDR/FMLN
(the politico-military opposition) were to win. 1
guess it shouldn't surprise me — after all. they get
their information and perspective largely from
Time magazine and Newsweek, no champions of
oppressed people anywhere — but it shocked me to
hear an entire debate about the fate of the Central
American people without any discussion what
soever of what the people of Central America want
for themselves.
The American media now simply reiterates the
perspective of the Reagan Administration in its
characterization of events in El Salvador. The
FDR FMLN is portrayed as a puppet of Nicaragua.
Cuba and the Soviet Union: its base of support
among the population is denied or disguised. We.
the innocent readers unreasonably expecting some
objectivity, are led to believe the Department of

State's characterization of this group; they are
"interested only in obtaining power through brute
force." 1
Hut let's examine the origins of the FMLN to un
derstand it better. The groups that make up the
FMLN were born in response to the brutal repres
sion of the Catholic Church's attempts to organize
the rural population.
Change in El Salvador is desperately needed. A
Cornell University study estimated that it has the
highest percentage of landless and near-landless
people in the world. Unemployment in San Sal
vador runs at about 50 percent. Widespread il
literacy, poor health, lack of education and other
manifestations of abject poverty run rampant. To
begin resolving these conditions, the FMLN makes
just two demands before it will lay down its arms:
one. a restructuring of the army that has killed
thousands of civilians over the past six years; and
two. the right of all people to fully participate in the
political process so that elections will really be
meaningful. Do we really oppose such legitimate
demands?
It is from these people, the victims of an unjust
and rigid social order, that the FDR/FMLN gets its
support. The poor of El Salvador don't need a
Soviet to tell them that they have needs that aren't
being met. The FMLN survives becaue it responds
to popular needs. Guillermo Ungo. a former refor
mist who now is with the FDR said: "The Sal
vadoran war is a people's war, fought under ad
verse conditions, that can be sustained and ad
vanced only with the support of the people."
The FMLN's practice speaks for itself. Ml we
have to do is look at the "liberated zones.'' areas of
the country which are controlled by the guerrilla
forces. In these areas, the people govern them

selves. Free elections are held., Health and educa
tion arc the top priorities. People live without fear
of violence, at least when the government planes
aren't bombing them.
But again. I guess I really shouldn't be surprised
that the government and the media ignore the
popular support for the FMLN. \fter all, it's noth
