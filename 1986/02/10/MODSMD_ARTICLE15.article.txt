# Inviting Gorbachev irresponsible
## 
### 
Just a few days ago the presidents of the senior class
sent a letter to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev inviting
him to speak at their commencement this spring. One
sometimes wonders how individuals are selected for invi
tation. Occasionally it is difficult to discern why an invitee
is deserving of the honor and why his or her remarks
would be especially valuable. 1 don't think, however, that
choosing a deserving speaker has ever proved impossible.
At least until now.
Gorbachev. What makes him deserving of the honor of
an invitation to speak ai Commencement? Perhaps it is
the ideals he represents. Or maybe the admirable ac
complishments his life reflects? Somehow neither of these
possibilities seems likely. The ideals of the young adults

he would address are alien to him. He knows nothing of
the spectrum of ideas to which they have been exposed,
nothing of the intellectual f&cduift th£y have enjoyed at
Stanford. He knows nothing of the emotions and choices
these seniors face as they leave Stanford and nothing of
the bpportunities open to them as citizens of a free nation.
The only attribute that might make a man like Gorba
che\ eligible to speak is that he currently leads a country
powerful enough to destroy the United States. Indeed, it
is doubtful that the seniors would have sought Gorba
chev's presence if he did not command arsenals of nuclear
and conventional weapons large enough to destroy the
United States and the rest of the free world. Inviting a
Gorbachev without weapons would be little different from
inviting a North Vietnamese or South African leader.
By inviting Gorbachev, the seniors have honored a ter
rorist and oppressor. He has risen to the ranks of eligible
"respectable" world leaders simply by amassing arsenals
that threaten the free world's security. Should the posses
sion of stockpiles of weapons qualify a man for a com
mencement speech?
Many feel - mistakenly— that we must honor Gorba
chev in order to peacefully co-exist with him and his
nation. On the contrary, we should never endorse or
legitimize Gorbachev and his activities b\ honoring him in
any way. Certainly we should respect him — but only be
cause of the awesome power he commands. Certainly we
should deal wiih him — but strictly on business terms and
only because we must. To behave otherwise toward a
leader who is such an utter enemy of freedom would both
compromise our values and betray the millions of op
pressed people in the Soviet Union and around the world.
Why did the seniors invite Gorbachev, then? What

moved them to compromise their respect for liberty and
deny their commensurate distaste for oppression? Both
fear and the will to disbelieve have much to do with the
answer.
The thought of the existence of a power capable of an
nihilating our population is unsettling. Ihe reality of it is
frightening. And yet all of us in the United States live with
it every day. We live with the knowledge that a small
group of men halfway around the world control a power
capable of destroying the United States on a whim and in
under an hour.
We do not find it comforting to believe that the men
controlling such power also administer a system which op
presses millions of people, that they fund and train terror
ist groups and nations that murder the innocent, that they
are the most powerful enemies of freedom on earth, and
that their efforts in the world aim to destroy the values we
cherish. For believing such a reality means that we live in
fear of an ominous power over which we have no control.
Obviously, such a reality puts us at great risk and makes
us fearful. We would like not to have to face such a risk or
fear such an ever-present danger.
Indeed, this reality is not pleasant. We all leap to the
opportunity to hide it and make our enemy not appear
like such an enemy anymore. This lets us us all breathe
easier. We find much greater comfort in believing that at
the helm of such a power are amiable men just like our
selves who dress like us, with whom we share tastes in
musfc. whom weVitn get to know find with whom we catj
exchange greetings and build friendships.
It is dangerously easy to lose sight of who Gorbachev
really is, what he represents and what he has worked all
his life to support and promote. It is easy because he has a
nice smile, wears well-tailored suits and seems like an
amiable fellow. Our wish that such a man and such a sys
tem did not' really control such a power makes it doubly
easy.
But the ease with which one can forget who Gorbachev
is and what he represents is no excuse for forgetting. As
lovers of freedom, we cannot grant administrators and
representatives of oppression honor and goodwill. When
we do so. we betray their victims and sacrifice the integrity
of our values.
The senior class presidents have committed just such a
betrayal and sacrifice in honoring Gorbachev with an invi
tation to speak at their commencement. That soon-to-be
graduates of an institution symbolizing the highest ideals
of a freedom-loving people should bestow such an honor
upon Gorbachev and all that he represents is appalling.
1 he senior class presidents have honored the representa
tive of the largest and most influential machine of ter
rorism and oppression on earth with an invitation dripping
with deference and implicit praise.
. In their invitation they represented many and much
more than their senior classmates. I'hey represented all of
Stanford and all that Stanford represents. Their action
was no less than disgraceful, embarrassing and insulting.
