# Shantytown destruction decried as 'racist' action
## 
### CHRIS SAUCEDO 
Early yesterday morning, the shantytown in White
Plaza was destroyed by vandals in an act which has
shocked the black and anti-apartheid communities.
Black Student Union (BSU) President Steve Phillips
called the act "a disgrace, it is a total disregard for those
people struggling to aid the people of South Africa."
The cardboard structure, erected last month before the
visit of South African Bishop Desmond Tutu, was
originally set up by a small group of Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA) members to remind Stanford students of
the oppresive living conditions that blacks cope with in
South Africa, according to Amanda Kemp, a member of
BSU and SOSA.
The shantytown was meant to show unity with South
African blacks while representing the difference between
white and black South Africa, Kemp added.
According to Phillips, the violence of the vandalism
represents the "objective racism" which exists at Stan
ford. This act is an attack against people who are trying to
unite and show solidarity, he said.
"I think its a horrible thing and 1 don't think it's iso
lated. Rascist incidents occur on this campus," Kemp said.
The structure was torn down at approximately 2 a.m.,
according to Sgt. Timothy Hanrahan of the Stanford
Police Department. The chance of finding those respon
sible for the destruction is small because the structure was
located in a public area, making fingerprinting difficult, he
added.
The vandalism "violated the rights of those who in

vested their energies" in building the shantytown, accord
ing Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Ronald Hudson.
Hudson said that if the vandals are Stanford students,
the matter could be dealt with by the Student Affairs Of
fice or by the Judicial Affairs Office.
Special Asst. to the Ombudsperson John Goheen said
that the shantytown was not a part of the University prop
erty, and said that "it is not clear to me if it would be a
violation of the Fundamental Standard."
Hudson said the nature of the vandalism suggests it was
"racially or politically motivated."
Last month, a similar incident occurred at Dartmouth
College, causing the school to shut down classes for a day
and run seminars on racism.
Phillips said he thought the Dartmouth incident may
have inspired the destruction or the shantytown.
According to SOS A member Mary Rose, the students
reacted against shantytown because they don't want to
face problems.
SOS A member Eric Diesel agreed but could not believe
the reaction would be this "violent." Diesel said the van
dalism demonstrates how "the majority of students are
apathetic towards violence towards blacks."
According to Kemp, the vandalism shows lack of
respect for those who are doing something they feel is
worthwhile.
The vandalism is disheartening but it won't stop SOSA,
said Rose. SOSA and the BSU will release statements on
the incident later this week.
