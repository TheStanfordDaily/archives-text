## Men's stalls will tell all 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
"What do you write?" Marilyn Wann asked Stanford
men in her column on bathroom graffiti last Friday. Here
are the answers.
Jokes that are seldom funny. Sketches that rarely could
be termed "Art." Poetry that never scans.
The writing is on the walls, in every men's bathroom at
Meyer Library.
There are the slogans, short and to the point, ranging
from sex to politics, and back to sex.
"Long live AIDS!"
"Napalm sticks to kids!"
"Yes to sodomy!"
There are the slurs, ethnic and religious, sexual and po
litical.
"Wop!"
"Fag!"
"Neo-Nazi!"
And there is dialogue, sometimes funny, sometimes in
sulting.
"Free Nelson Mandela."
Response: "Free Nelson Mandela with every box of
Wheaties you buy."
"Fascists are boring and never get laid."
Response: "I'm a fascist and I get laid."
"I'm a good-looking blond man (in search of a good
looking partner)."
Response: "Meet me by the pool. My name is Narcis
sus."
Some of the most interesting graffiti comes in the form
of charts. Every bathroom seems to have one.
Age, weight, height, one chart requests. Harmless
enough.
Then, length of penis, "Do you masturbate?" and
"How often?"
Male organs of Stanford library-goers range from two
to eighteen-and-one-half inches in length, the surveys say.
I doubt you could find a much better range to choose
from at any other university in the nation. Perhaps U.S.
News & World Report is not the only magazine that
would rank Stanford No. 1.
(It should be noted here, though, that I did not verify
those penis sizes with at least two independent sources, so
take them — the statistics — with a grain of salt.)
All Stanford men who responded to the surveys on
Meyer's bathroom walls, with the exception of one, said
they masturbate. Frequency ranged from twice a week to
four times a day.
Predictably, Meyer bathroom poets like to write about
Stanford women, though not often in a favorable light.
"Stanford girls are like tricycles," reads one comment.
"They're fun to ride, but you wouldn't want to be seen on
one."
If sex is the favorite topic, religion is not far behind. My
favorite example:
"1 am back. First of all, I'm not Christian. I'm Muslim.
Secondly, if I ever find out who called Allah a son-of-a
bitch, I will be obligated, as a Muslim, to kill (you)."
Miscellaneous pithy sayings abound.
Some are trite, such as: "Flush hard. It's a long way to
Stern Food Service."
Others are fresh, such as the warning at the bottom of a
stall door: "Beware of gay limbo dancers."
Above one urinal is written: "The future of America is
in your hands."
Finally, there is the graffiti of the optimist, the Stanford
man hoping for a better world.
"Are you gay?" asks one writer. "I'm not gay and it's
OK if you are. Peace lives on."
Another message is humbling.
"People who go around telling everyone how great
their group is (or putting others down) only do so because
they know that they personally are worthless and need
some way of pretending they aren't."
Someone responded to that message by saying its writer
must surely have a tiny penis.
