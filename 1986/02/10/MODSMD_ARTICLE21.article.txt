# Student volunteers buck the system

### VLADINA HESS 
Picture a room full of noisy students,
balloons, half-eaten pizzas and empty pop
bottles. Suddenly, you hear the clang of a
cowbell ringing and a cheer goes up.
Don't be fooled, though — this is not
just another campus party, and that cow
bell is not the instrument of choice in some
new drinking game. The students in the
room are volunteers raising money for the
Stanford Telethon, one of several student
fund-raising activities on the Farm.
And fund-raising is big business at Stan
ford. According to David Voss, director of
Student Development, solicited funds ac
counted for 44 percent of the University's
1984-85 operating costs, while tuition paid
for 42 percent.
"Student participation in fund-raising is
important," Voss said. "It shows student
support for Stanford, and gets them in
volved in a public service as a student."
Students have been active in fund
raising at Stanford since 1955, when the
senior class started the Heritage Fund as a
class project. The Heritage Fund raises
money for student scholarships from local
businesses and individuals, and students

from all four classes volunteer.
Senior Lynette Wong, who is the Heri
tage Fund student chairman, explained
that student fund-raising "gives one a
chance to be involved with Stanford. We
(the student volunteers) are directly
representing the University when we make
our solicitations."
Wong also noted that student volunteers
get the opportunity to meet a wide variety
of businessmen. The job gives students "a
chance to meet with people who are suc
cessful in business and who are interested
in supporting higher education," she said.
According to Wong, approximately 30 stu
dents are involved with the Heritage Fund
and will contact over 200 corporations and
individuals this quarter.
Another student fund-raising group at
Stanford is the Senior Pledge. While other
fund-raising efforts focus on alumni, the
Senior Pledge "gets students involved in
donating to Stanford by targeting a group
that is about to reach alumni status," said
Senior Pledge student chairman Holly
Harrison, a senior.
Harrison's first experience with student
fund-raising at Stanford came when she
W r>rt-orT or; the Stanford Telethon as a

sophomore. "It (the telethon) was a lot of
fun, and I've been involved ever since,"
she said.
Harrison also noted, however, that stu
dent participation in the University's fund
raising efforts is more than just fun. "We
should look back on our years at Stanford
and think about what we got out of it, and
try to give that opportunity to someone
else," she said.
Currently, there are 30 students on the
Senior Pledge board, and the drive hopes
to net about $125,000 for the Farm by
asking each graduating senior to pledge
$86.
The newest student fund-raising project
on campus is the Stanford Telethon, which
then-student John Blum started in 1983.
After researching the high cost of tuition
for an ASSU task force, Blum discovered
the importance of fund-raising for the Uni
versity and decided to get more students
involved. The first telethon raised over
$80,000.
Last year, the telethon raised over
$140,000 and approximately 250 students
participated. According to this years stu
dent chairman, senior Ricky Rosenkranz.

the Stanford Telethon is popular among
students for many reasons.
"We want to promote student awareness
about the importance of fund-raising to
the University, and this is a fun way to do
it,"he said. "The atmosphere is ecstatic —
like the last minutes of a TV phone-a
thon. One gets a feeling of Stanfordness.
You really identify with the school."
Like Harrison, Rosenkranz first became
involved with student fund raising through
the telethon. "The telethon is a great place
to start," Rosenkranz said, noting that it
usually attracts new students and intro
duces them to student fund-raising at Stan
ford.
This year, the Stanford Telethon is May
12-18, and Rosenkranz expressed his hope
for even greater student involvement.
"This year, we're expecting a really big
turnout," he noted. "It's especially fun
when a dorm or group of friends signs up
for the same shift."
Any student interested in Stanford's
fund-raising efforts — with the Stanford
Telethon, the Senior Pledge or the Heri
tage Fund — can contact David Voss at the
Office of Development in Encina Hall for
more information.

cowbell ringing and a cheer goes up.
Don't be fooled, though — this is not
just another campus party, and that cow
bell is not the instrument of choice in some
new drinking game. The students in the
room are volunteers raising money for the
Stanford Telethon, one of several student
fund-raising activities on the Farm.
And fund-raising is big business at Stan
ford. According to David Voss, director of
Student Development, solicited funds ac
counted for 44 percent of the University's
1984-85 operating costs, while tuition paid
for 42 percent.
"Student participation in fund-raising is
important," Voss said. "It shows student
support for Stanford, and gets them in
volved in a public service as a student."
Students have been active in fund
raising at Stanford since 1955, when the
senior class started the Heritage Fund as a
class project. The Heritage Fund raises
money for student scholarships from local
businesses and individuals, and students

from all four classes volunteer.
Senior Lynette Wong, who is the Heri
tage Fund student chairman, explained
that student fund-raising "gives one a
chance to be involved with Stanford. We
(the student volunteers) are directly
representing the University when we make
our solicitations."
Wong also noted that student volunteers
get the opportunity to meet a wide variety
of businessmen. The job gives students "a
chance to meet with people who are suc
cessful in business and who are interested
in supporting higher education," she said.
According to Wong, approximately 30 stu
dents are involved with the Heritage Fund
and will contact over 200 corporations and
individuals this quarter.
Another student fund-raising group at
Stanford is the Senior Pledge. While other
fund-raising efforts focus on alumni, the
Senior Pledge "gets students involved in
donating to Stanford by targeting a group
that is about to reach alumni status," said
Senior Pledge student chairman Holly
Harrison, a senior.
Harrison's first experience with student
fund-raising at Stanford came when she
W r>rt-orT or; the Stanford Telethon as a

sophomore. "It (the telethon) was a lot of
fun, and I've been involved ever since,"
she said.
Harrison also noted, however, that stu
dent participation in the University's fund
raising efforts is more than just fun. "We
should look back on our years at Stanford
and think about what we got out of it, and
try to give that opportunity to someone
else," she said.
Currently, there are 30 students on the
Senior Pledge board, and the drive hopes
to net about $125,000 for the Farm by
asking each graduating senior to pledge
$86.
The newest student fund-raising project
on campus is the Stanford Telethon, which
then-student John Blum started in 1983.
After researching the high cost of tuition
for an ASSU task force, Blum discovered
the importance of fund-raising for the Uni
versity and decided to get more students
involved. The first telethon raised over
$80,000.
Last year, the telethon raised over
$140,000 and approximately 250 students
participated. According to this years stu
dent chairman, senior Ricky Rosenkranz.

the Stanford Telethon is popular among
students for many reasons.
"We want to promote student awareness
about the importance of fund-raising to
the University, and this is a fun way to do
it,"he said. "The atmosphere is ecstatic —
like the last minutes of a TV phone-a
thon. One gets a feeling of Stanfordness.
You really identify with the school."
Like Harrison, Rosenkranz first became
involved with student fund raising through
the telethon. "The telethon is a great place
to start," Rosenkranz said, noting that it
usually attracts new students and intro
duces them to student fund-raising at Stan
ford.
This year, the Stanford Telethon is May
12-18, and Rosenkranz expressed his hope
for even greater student involvement.
"This year, we're expecting a really big
turnout," he noted. "It's especially fun
when a dorm or group of friends signs up
for the same shift."
Any student interested in Stanford's
fund-raising efforts — with the Stanford
Telethon, the Senior Pledge or the Heri
tage Fund — can contact David Voss at the
Office of Development in Encina Hall for
more information.
