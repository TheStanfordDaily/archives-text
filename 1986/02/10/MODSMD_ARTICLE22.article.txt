## Card knocks Cats out of Pacific 10 lead Stanford bounces back from ASU heartbreak 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
The Stanford men's basketball
team had just beaten first-place
Arizona, 62-56, in front of 7,203 at
Maples Pavilion on Saturday, but the
arena sounded like a Hewlett-
Packard television commercial.
"What if?" was the question of the
day. What if the Cardinal had beaten
eighth-place Arizona State on
Thursday? What if the Cardinal had
held an eight-point lead in the final
two minutes? What if someone could
have hit a free throw to prevent that
game from going into overtime?
The answer: Stanford would have
been all alone in third place, one
game out of the lead.
But instead, the Cardinal merely
had the satisfaction of having
knocked the front-running Wildcats
into second place at 7-3 and the satis
faction of knowing its own postseason
hopes remain well within the realm of
the possible. With the win, Stanford
raised its record to 6-5 in the Pacific
10 Conference and moved into a tie
for fourth place with California, two
games behind first-place Washington.
Stanford is now 12-11 overall.
Arizona falls to 16-7 and a half-game
behind Washington. The Huskies
beat USC Saturday, 70-64, to regain
the league lead. Stanford Coach Tom
Davis wasn't going to dwell on the
"What if?" question. "You can't
think like that or you'll drive yourself
crazy," he said.
Davis did admit that Thursday's
nightmare had not been forgotten,

even with the first-place team in the
league coming in. "We weren't real
concerned with who we were
playing," he said. "We were con
cerned with how we played Thursday
night and that we didn't beat Arizona
State. I think we would have been up
to play anyone today â€” it just hap
pened to be Arizona."
The Cardinal responded with
maybe its finest defensive effort of
the season, holding the Wildcats to
only 20 first-half points en route to a
30-20 lead.
"We identified their shooters bet
ter today," said Stanford guard Keith
Ramee, who finished with eight
points. "If you leave them open,
they're going to put it down. We kept
our hands up on defense and did a
good job on them."
With 9:40 to go in the first half,
Arizona led 16-13, but Stanford ran
off a 21-4 spurt in the next 12
minutes to open a 34-20 lead at the
18-minute mark of the second half.
The Wildcats scored only one basket
in the last nine minutes of that
stretch.
Arizona wasn't quite out of it,
though. Guard Steve Kerr, whose
long-range bombs weren't falling in
the first half, stepped inside Santa
Clara County to shoot in the second
half and helped the Wildcats close to
48-46 with five minutes left. Kerr
finished with 22 points.
Then Howard Wright took over.

The Cardinal overcame an uncharacteristically poor 3-for-10 shooting performance by
freshman standout Todd Lichti to nip Arizona 62-56.
