## Card knocks Cats out of Pacific 10 lead Stanford bounces back from ASU heartbreak 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
The Stanford men's basketball
team had just beaten first-place
Arizona, 62-56, in front of 7,203 at
Maples Pavilion on Saturday, but the
arena sounded like a Hewlett-
Packard television commercial.
"What if?" was the question of the
day. What if the Cardinal had beaten
eighth-place Arizona State on
Thursday? What if the Cardinal had
held an eight-point lead in the final
two minutes? What if someone could
have hit a free throw to prevent that
game from going into overtime?
The answer: Stanford would have
been all alone in third place, one
game out of the lead.
But instead, the Cardinal merely
had the satisfaction of having
knocked the front-running Wildcats
into second place at 7-3 and the satis
faction of knowing its own postseason
hopes remain well within the realm of
the possible. With the win, Stanford
raised its record to 6-5 in the Pacific
10 Conference and moved into a tie
for fourth place with California, two
games behind first-place Washington.
Stanford is now 12-11 overall.
Arizona falls to 16-7 and a half-game
behind Washington. The Huskies
beat USC Saturday, 70-64, to regain
the league lead. Stanford Coach Tom
Davis wasn't going to dwell on the
"What if?" question. "You can't
think like that or you'll drive yourself
crazy," he said.
Davis did admit that Thursday's
nightmare had not been forgotten,

even with the first-place team in the
league coming in. "We weren't real
concerned with who we were
playing," he said. "We were con
cerned with how we played Thursday
night and that we didn't beat Arizona
State. I think we would have been up
to play anyone today — it just hap
pened to be Arizona."
The Cardinal responded with
maybe its finest defensive effort of
the season, holding the Wildcats to
only 20 first-half points en route to a
30-20 lead.
"We identified their shooters bet
ter today," said Stanford guard Keith
Ramee, who finished with eight
points. "If you leave them open,
they're going to put it down. We kept
our hands up on defense and did a
good job on them."
With 9:40 to go in the first half,
Arizona led 16-13, but Stanford ran
off a 21-4 spurt in the next 12
minutes to open a 34-20 lead at the
18-minute mark of the second half.
The Wildcats scored only one basket
in the last nine minutes of that
stretch.
Arizona wasn't quite out of it,
though. Guard Steve Kerr, whose
long-range bombs weren't falling in
the first half, stepped inside Santa
Clara County to shoot in the second
half and helped the Wildcats close to
48-46 with five minutes left. Kerr
finished with 22 points.
Then Howard Wright took over.

freshman standout Todd Lichti to nip Arizona 62-56.
up late to shooting practice, but came
in off the bench to score 11 points.
Wright banked in a five-footer
from the right side, and on Stanford's
next possession he took a feed from

Greg Butler, laid it in, drew Kerrs
fourth foul, and converted the three
point play to give Stanford a 53-46
lead with 3:50 to play.
Arizona never pulled closer than

five again, as Ramee, Todd Lichti and
Terry Taylor all drilled free throws to
keep the Wildcats at bay.
"We're not as good a ballclub as
Arizona," Davis said. "We just
played really well today. We identi
fied their scorers and played with in
tensity."
Arizona Coach Lute Olson, whose
frustration showed when he waived a
white towel at the officials after a par
ticularly questionable call, said, "I
think they were more aggressive, they
played harder and they made more
things happen than we did. They
deserved to win.
"We knew the team that comes out
first and comes after you is going to
win — there's not much difference in
talent in this league. And the home
crowd, when it's as involved as it was
today, doesn't let the home team let
up. I think this conference is so close
games like this are going to happen
all the way through."
At the other end, the Cardinal had
an easier time against the Wildcats
zone defense. "Man-to-man tends to
disrupt us a little more," said guard
Novian Whitsitt, who scored 13
points to lead Stanford. "We play
mostly against the zone in practice, so
we're more used to playing against it.
I'm glad they went back into the
zone, because we were more patient
against it today."
Arizona had taken the first meeting
in Tucson, 77-69, but Whitsitt missed
that game with a pulled back muscle,
and Wright sat out the last 17 minutes
with a sprained ankle. "The differ
ence was that Novian and Howard
played tonight, and we slowed Kerr
down early," Ramee said.
