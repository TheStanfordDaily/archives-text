# Defense contains Arizona marksmen

After Thursday night's disappointing overtime loss to
Arizona State, many wondered how Stanford's men's bas
ketball squad would respond when it had to face Arizona,
the first-place team in the Pacific 10 Conference, only two
days later.
To the delight of the more than 7,000 fans packed into
Maples Pavilion, the Cardinal came out and played some
of its most inspired defense of the season to knock off the
Wildcats by a 62-56 count, thus avenging an earlier defeat
in Tucson and keeping the Cardinal in the thick of the
Pac-10 race.
Early in the game it was clear that the Cardinal had
come to play. Stanford scrapped and hustled and pressed
to keep the Wildcats off balance, and Arizona got off to a
slow start from which it never recovered. Wildcat guards
Steve Kerr and Craig McMillan, who had combined for 36
points in the earlier 77-69 Arizona victory, were forced to
shoot from outside their considerable range, and Stanford
grabbed most of the ensuing rebounds.
The Cardinal held the normally potent Arizona offense
to a .43 1 field goal percentage on the day, well under their
.497 Pac-10 average and even further below the .533
mark they had managed in the game in Tucson. Arizona
had only a .370 shooting percentage at the half, one in
which the Wildcats scored just 20 points.
Cardinal point guard Keith Ramee attributed much of
the success of the defense to the pressure created by the
full-court press. "They usually like to pass over the
press," he said." We wanted Kerr to dribble it up instead,
and it ended up forcing them to start their offense out a (
couple of feet higher. Kerr is deadly from a pretty long
distance, but I think when he's shooting from 30 feet, he's
a little out of his range.
"They seemed to be more worried about beating the
press than setting up their offense. We didn't get that
many steals from the press, but it was definitely a dis
ruptive force," Ramee added.
"A big difference between today's game and
Thursday's game was the fact that the Arizona guards
aren't as good at creating openings on
the dribble as the ASU guards,"
Stanford Coach Tom Davis said.
"Steve Kerr likes to shoot off of a
pass, while Steve Beck can get open
with the dribble. Today, we played an
aggressive zone and didn't let them
get open."
Stanford's inside defenders did
their part as well. Arizona's
frontcourt was never a factor, as the
smaller Wildcats found themselves
overmatched on the boards. Forward
Sean Elliott, Arizona's leading
scorer, was plagued by foul trouble
throughout the game and managed
only eight points, none of them in the
second half.
In contrast to the Arizona State
game, the Cardinal did not suffer a
letdown in intensity at the start of the
second half. Stanford came out in a
man-to-man defense to open the half,
falling back into a zone after a short
time.
"Man-to-man gets you going â€” it
gets your feet moving," Ramee said.
"The difference today was our
maintained intensity and our
rebounding.
Arizona Coach Lute Olson also
gave credit to the Stanford defense.
"In this conference, the team that
comes out the strongest wins," he
said. "There's not that much differ
ence in talent, so whoever is most
hungry wins. Stanford was more ag
gressive and played harder, and they
were the better team today."
