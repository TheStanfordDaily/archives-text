# Homers give Gauchos series
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
Gophers can positively ruin a year's harvest. Just ask
any farmer. Tillers of the land will cringe and fret at the
slightest mention of the little pests.
In baseball gophers can have a similarly pernicious ef
fect — and not only on the grassy green of the field.
"Gopherball," you see, is baseball slang for a home run
pitch.
Ask members of Stanford's pitching staff about gop
hers. or better yet "gopherballs," and they might very well
turn pale, especially after yesterday's 1 1-6 loss to UC-
Santa Barbara at Sunken Diamond.
Like farmers, Stanford's hurlers have found out about
gophers — the hard way.
Six gophers, or more properly gopherballs, combined to
wreck Stanford's Sunday. A Gaucho home run in each of
the first six innings built UCSB's lead to 11-5, and Stan
ford, swinging lifeless bats for much of the afternoon,
couldn't catch up.
With the loss, which followed Saturday's 5-4 Cardinal
win and Friday's 5-1 defeat, Stanford fell to 6-2 overall.
UCSB improved to 4-1. Moreover, it meant that Stanford
dropped its first three-game weekend series in more than
a year.
The Gauchos got things going against starter Kevin
Kurikel right away, with three runs in the first. Leadoff
hitter Quinn Mack, who hit two homers and knocked in
four runs on the weekend, lined Kunkel's second pitch of
the game off the rightfield wall for a double. Mack moved
to third on a groundout and scored on a fly to center.
After a two-out walk to shortstop Erik Johnson, the
Gaucho gophers reared their ugly heads for the first time.
First baseman Greg Vella drove Kunkel's 1-0 offering
over the rightfield fence for a two-run home run."It was a
slider outside," Kunkel said. "He did a really nice bit of
hitting."
After loading the bases with none out in its half of the
inning, Stanford managed only a single tally. Walt Harris
scored from third on John Ramos' groundout to second,
but then Lance Shebelut popped to second and Toi Cook
hit into an inning-ending force play.
Three more Gaucho runs in the second made the score
6-1. Left fielder Brian Bello unloaded on a Kunkel
fastball with one out and a runner on second.
"My fastball was a little up to the lefty," Kunkel said

Lee Plemcl was the only Stanford pitcher to escape the powerful UCSB bats yesterday.
The sophomore pitched three scoreless innings in a losing cause.
