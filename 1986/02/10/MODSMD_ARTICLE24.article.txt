# Homers give Gauchos series
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
Gophers can positively ruin a year's harvest. Just ask
any farmer. Tillers of the land will cringe and fret at the
slightest mention of the little pests.
In baseball gophers can have a similarly pernicious ef
fect — and not only on the grassy green of the field.
"Gopherball," you see, is baseball slang for a home run
pitch.
Ask members of Stanford's pitching staff about gop
hers. or better yet "gopherballs," and they might very well
turn pale, especially after yesterday's 1 1-6 loss to UC-
Santa Barbara at Sunken Diamond.
Like farmers, Stanford's hurlers have found out about
gophers — the hard way.
Six gophers, or more properly gopherballs, combined to
wreck Stanford's Sunday. A Gaucho home run in each of
the first six innings built UCSB's lead to 11-5, and Stan
ford, swinging lifeless bats for much of the afternoon,
couldn't catch up.
With the loss, which followed Saturday's 5-4 Cardinal
win and Friday's 5-1 defeat, Stanford fell to 6-2 overall.
UCSB improved to 4-1. Moreover, it meant that Stanford
dropped its first three-game weekend series in more than
a year.
The Gauchos got things going against starter Kevin
Kurikel right away, with three runs in the first. Leadoff
hitter Quinn Mack, who hit two homers and knocked in
four runs on the weekend, lined Kunkel's second pitch of
the game off the rightfield wall for a double. Mack moved
to third on a groundout and scored on a fly to center.
After a two-out walk to shortstop Erik Johnson, the
Gaucho gophers reared their ugly heads for the first time.
First baseman Greg Vella drove Kunkel's 1-0 offering
over the rightfield fence for a two-run home run."It was a
slider outside," Kunkel said. "He did a really nice bit of
hitting."
After loading the bases with none out in its half of the
inning, Stanford managed only a single tally. Walt Harris
scored from third on John Ramos' groundout to second,
but then Lance Shebelut popped to second and Toi Cook
hit into an inning-ending force play.
Three more Gaucho runs in the second made the score
6-1. Left fielder Brian Bello unloaded on a Kunkel
fastball with one out and a runner on second.
"My fastball was a little up to the lefty," Kunkel said

about his second gopherball. "He hit
it pretty well. Honestly, though, I
really don't know what was going
wrong out there today. They were
just hitting everything I threw up
there."
After a strikeout, consecutive
singles by Johnson and Vella drove
Kunkel, 0-1, from the mound. Fresh
man Brian Keyser, in relief of
Kunkel, walked his first two batters,
the second forcing in a run.
In the third, UCSB played some
more long-ball. Mack, with a runner
on first, reached for an outside pitch
and poked it over the fence to the op
posite field.
"Keyser threw a curve ball that
hung up for me," Mack said. "I kept
my head down, (and) hit it where it
was pitched." Mack's blast made it 8-
1.
While the Gauchos were busy
scoring single runs in the fourth, fifth
and sixth innings — all coming on
solo home runs off Stanford's third
pitcher, Rob Wassenaar — Stanford's
lone murmur came in the bottom of
the fifth. Designated hitter Doug
Robbins lashed a fastball off starter
and winner Dan Peters, 1-0, to left
for a three-run home run.
"Obviously, we hope we'll get bet
ter with the bats," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said, after his team
had been outhit for the third con
secutive day.
"We just aren't getting those hits
with runners in scoring position."
While Stanford couldn't buy a

clutch hit, UCSB couldn't miss, at
least yesterday. "Today when we
swang the bat," Gaucho Coach A 1
Ferrer said, "it was at the pitches we
wanted. We're a good fastball hitting
team, and when we saw Kunkel pitch,
we knew we'd hit him hard.' Indeed,
five of UCSB's home runs were hit
off fastballs.
It was a different story on Satur
day. Stanford's A 1 Osuna baffled the
Gauchos through six-and-two-thirds
innings, striking out five and allowing
two runs on five hits.
Osuna, now 3-0, kept UCSB hit
ters off balance with an assortment ot
fastballs, changeups and sliders. "On
Saturday," Ferrer said, "we went
away from our hitting philosophy. We
decided to be very aggressive, to not
let Osuna get ahead in the count.
That threw us out of our disciplined
hitting mode."
Stanford built a 5-0 lead after five
innings. Two run-scoring doubles to
left by Ramos highlighted Stanford
rallies in the first and fifth innings.
"Both (doubles) were on fastballs,"
Ramos said. "On the first one, the
pitcher (Mike Myers, 0-1) fell behind
in the count so I looked for the
fastball."
In the seventh, Osuna ran into
trouble. Back-to-back Gaucho
singles put runners on first and third.
After Osuna fanned Brian Pace, Scott
Cerny grounded an RBI-single down
the first-base line. When Osuna fell
behind the next batter 2-0, Marquess
went to his bullpen.
Steve Chitren got Robby Barlett to
fly to center, the runner on third
scoring. Then Mack grounded out to
end the Gaucho threat.
The score remained 5-2 until the

UCSB ninth. A single and a double
plated one run and forced Marquess
to go to his bullpen once more. This
time he called on Wassenaar.
Wassenaar, entering with a runner
on second and a two-run cushion,
retired Bello on a grounder to second
for the first out. Then Vella, pinch
hitting for Cerny, lofted a fly to the
foul territory off third base. Mark
Machtolf raced from his third base
position to make an over-the
shoulder grab for the second out.
The game appeared to be over
when the next batter, Barlett, waved
at a 1-2 pitch for strike three. Even
though the ball bounced away from
the catcher, Ramos, he collected it in
time to throw Barlett out at first. But
his toss short-hopped Ron Whit
meyer at first for an error. On the
play Logan scored from third to cut
Stanford's lead to 5-4.
The Gaucho comeback ended
when the next batter, Mack, hit a
one-hopper to the pitcher Wassenaar
who threw to Whitmeyer tor the last
out.
Friday's series opener belonged to
UCSB starter Mike Tresemer, 1-0.
He went all the way, scattering nine
hits and giving up one run while strik
ing out seven.
"The key was just basically getting
ahead," Tresemer said. "That way 1
can make them swing at my pitch."
Stanford's starter, Jack McDowell,
was as overpowering as Tresemer
through his first three innings. But
the middle innings, the fourth and
fifth, were his undoing. Four singles
in the UCSB fourth added up to two
runs, and Mack's opposite-field
home run in the fifth scored two more.

The Gauchos got things going against starter Kevin
Kurikel right away, with three runs in the first. Leadoff
hitter Quinn Mack, who hit two homers and knocked in
four runs on the weekend, lined Kunkel's second pitch of
the game off the rightfield wall for a double. Mack moved
to third on a groundout and scored on a fly to center.
After a two-out walk to shortstop Erik Johnson, the
Gaucho gophers reared their ugly heads for the first time.
First baseman Greg Vella drove Kunkel's 1-0 offering
over the rightfield fence for a two-run home run."It was a
slider outside," Kunkel said. "He did a really nice bit of
hitting."
After loading the bases with none out in its half of the
inning, Stanford managed only a single tally. Walt Harris
scored from third on John Ramos' groundout to second,
but then Lance Shebelut popped to second and Toi Cook
hit into an inning-ending force play.
Three more Gaucho runs in the second made the score
6-1. Left fielder Brian Bello unloaded on a Kunkel
fastball with one out and a runner on second.
"My fastball was a little up to the lefty," Kunkel said

about his second gopherball. "He hit
it pretty well. Honestly, though, I
really don't know what was going
wrong out there today. They were
just hitting everything I threw up
there."
After a strikeout, consecutive
singles by Johnson and Vella drove
Kunkel, 0-1, from the mound. Fresh
man Brian Keyser, in relief of
Kunkel, walked his first two batters,
the second forcing in a run.
In the third, UCSB played some
more long-ball. Mack, with a runner
on first, reached for an outside pitch
and poked it over the fence to the op
posite field.
"Keyser threw a curve ball that
hung up for me," Mack said. "I kept
my head down, (and) hit it where it
was pitched." Mack's blast made it 8-
1.
While the Gauchos were busy
scoring single runs in the fourth, fifth
and sixth innings — all coming on
solo home runs off Stanford's third
pitcher, Rob Wassenaar — Stanford's
lone murmur came in the bottom of
the fifth. Designated hitter Doug
Robbins lashed a fastball off starter
and winner Dan Peters, 1-0, to left
for a three-run home run.
"Obviously, we hope we'll get bet
ter with the bats," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said, after his team
had been outhit for the third con
secutive day.
"We just aren't getting those hits
with runners in scoring position."
While Stanford couldn't buy a

clutch hit, UCSB couldn't miss, at
least yesterday. "Today when we
swang the bat," Gaucho Coach A 1
Ferrer said, "it was at the pitches we
wanted. We're a good fastball hitting
team, and when we saw Kunkel pitch,
we knew we'd hit him hard.' Indeed,
five of UCSB's home runs were hit
off fastballs.
It was a different story on Satur
day. Stanford's A 1 Osuna baffled the
Gauchos through six-and-two-thirds
innings, striking out five and allowing
two runs on five hits.
Osuna, now 3-0, kept UCSB hit
ters off balance with an assortment ot
fastballs, changeups and sliders. "On
Saturday," Ferrer said, "we went
away from our hitting philosophy. We
decided to be very aggressive, to not
let Osuna get ahead in the count.
That threw us out of our disciplined
hitting mode."
Stanford built a 5-0 lead after five
innings. Two run-scoring doubles to
left by Ramos highlighted Stanford
rallies in the first and fifth innings.
"Both (doubles) were on fastballs,"
Ramos said. "On the first one, the
pitcher (Mike Myers, 0-1) fell behind
in the count so I looked for the
fastball."
In the seventh, Osuna ran into
trouble. Back-to-back Gaucho
singles put runners on first and third.
After Osuna fanned Brian Pace, Scott
Cerny grounded an RBI-single down
the first-base line. When Osuna fell
behind the next batter 2-0, Marquess
went to his bullpen.
Steve Chitren got Robby Barlett to
fly to center, the runner on third
scoring. Then Mack grounded out to
end the Gaucho threat.
The score remained 5-2 until the

UCSB ninth. A single and a double
plated one run and forced Marquess
to go to his bullpen once more. This
time he called on Wassenaar.
Wassenaar, entering with a runner
on second and a two-run cushion,
retired Bello on a grounder to second
for the first out. Then Vella, pinch
hitting for Cerny, lofted a fly to the
foul territory off third base. Mark
Machtolf raced from his third base
position to make an over-the
shoulder grab for the second out.
The game appeared to be over
when the next batter, Barlett, waved
at a 1-2 pitch for strike three. Even
though the ball bounced away from
the catcher, Ramos, he collected it in
time to throw Barlett out at first. But
his toss short-hopped Ron Whit
meyer at first for an error. On the
play Logan scored from third to cut
Stanford's lead to 5-4.
The Gaucho comeback ended
when the next batter, Mack, hit a
one-hopper to the pitcher Wassenaar
who threw to Whitmeyer tor the last
out.
Friday's series opener belonged to
UCSB starter Mike Tresemer, 1-0.
He went all the way, scattering nine
hits and giving up one run while strik
ing out seven.
"The key was just basically getting
ahead," Tresemer said. "That way 1
can make them swing at my pitch."
Stanford's starter, Jack McDowell,
was as overpowering as Tresemer
through his first three innings. But
the middle innings, the fourth and
fifth, were his undoing. Four singles
in the UCSB fourth added up to two
runs, and Mack's opposite-field
home run in the fifth scored two more.

"Gopherball," you see, is baseball slang for a home run
pitch.
Ask members of Stanford's pitching staff about gop
hers. or better yet "gopherballs," and they might very well
turn pale, especially after yesterday's 1 1-6 loss to UC-
Santa Barbara at Sunken Diamond.
Like farmers, Stanford's hurlers have found out about
gophers — the hard way.
Six gophers, or more properly gopherballs, combined to
wreck Stanford's Sunday. A Gaucho home run in each of
the first six innings built UCSB's lead to 11-5, and Stan
ford, swinging lifeless bats for much of the afternoon,
couldn't catch up.
With the loss, which followed Saturday's 5-4 Cardinal
win and Friday's 5-1 defeat, Stanford fell to 6-2 overall.
UCSB improved to 4-1. Moreover, it meant that Stanford
dropped its first three-game weekend series in more than
