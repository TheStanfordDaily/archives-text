## 
### MATTHEW BODMAN 
"I had a sneaking suspicion all
week long that they were going to
swim real well," Stanford women's
swimming Coach George Haines
said. His feeling turned out to be cor
rect. as the Cardinal defeated top
ranked Texas by a 82-58 score at
DeGuerre Pool on Saturday.
The meet was a showdown be
tween last year's NCAA champion
Longhorns and the No. 3 Cardinal.
No one went away disappointed, as
six pool records and seven U.S.
leading times were set.
After nine events, the score read
Stanford 44, Texas 35. Both teams
had been swimming to a standoff.
Then came the 200 backstroke. Stan
ford freshmen Michelle Donahue and
Jenny Shannon finished 1-2 to bring
the score to a commanding 52-36.
The Cardinal never looked back, as it
went on to win 12 races out of a pos
sible 16.
Saturday's meet was a showcase for
the outstanding Cardinal freshmen.
They accounted for 48 points and five

victories. "Everybody says we have
the best freshman class in the
country." Haines said. "And today
they went out and proved it."
Jenna Johnson was particularly ex
ceptional. She set two pool records
and set the nation's fastest times in
winning the 100-yard butterfly in
54.57 and the 200 freestyle in
1:46.95. Johnson was also a part of
the 400 freestyle (3:22.65) and 400
medley (3:44.33) relay teams. Both
set pool records and were top times in
the nation.
The Cardinal swimmers excelled in
many other events, led by senior co
captain Kathy Smith. Smith won the
100 breastroke event (1:02.88), set
ting the nation's fastest time. She also
won the 200 breaststroke and partici
pated in the winning 400 medley and
400 freestyle relays.
Sophomore Susan Rapp and fresh
man Aimee Berzins were also out
standing. Rapp capped the meet, w in
ning the 400 individual medley and
clinching the victory for Stanford. She
set the No. 1 time in the nation,
finishing in 4:20.85. Berzins won

both the 50 and 100 freestyle for the
Cardinal.
The Stanford divers contributed to
the victory, winning both the one and
three-meter dives. 1 hey outscored
Texas 13-5. Senior Kirn Jones and
sophomore Leslie Kleinheksel
finished 1-2 in the one-meter event,
while Simone Levant won the three
meter dive.
The Stanford victory offset a fine
performance by Texas sophomore
Tiffany Cohen. She won both the 500
and 1.000 freestyle events, setting a
pool record and top time in the nation
for the 1.000 free (9:42.67).
Texas Coach Richard Quick said of
the Cardinal swimmers, "They were
really great. In some ways 1 was
surprised we could stay with them.
Whenever you have the leadership
and talent of a Susan Rapp and Jenna
Johnson, that's very tough to beat."
The Stanford women improved
their dual meet record to ft-0. Texas
dropped to 5-2. "Stanford and
Florida will have a great battle at the
NCAAs for the championship,"
Quick said.
