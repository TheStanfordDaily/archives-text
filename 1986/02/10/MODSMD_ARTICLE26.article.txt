UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) â€”
Stanford freshman Debi Thomas
triple-jumped her way to the
women's title Saturday, becoming
the first black seniors champion
ever at the National Figure
Skating Championships.
Thomas, of San Jose, landed all
five triples she attempted in her
freestyle program. She skated with
verve and, as she left the ice after
her routine, pumped her arms in
the air in a victoiy salute.
But Thomas could not be cer
tain she was a winner until Caryn
Kadavy completed her program.
Kadavy, skating next, landed three
triple jumps but missed one and
was not nearly as spectacular as
Thomas.
Thomas' victoiy capped a ter
rific year following a second-place
finish to defending champion Tif
fany Chin at the 1985 Nationals.
She won the National Sports Fes
tival and two international events.
Thomas surprised both herself
and her competition by winning
the senior women's crown.
The freshman had been strug
gling throughout her practice ses
sions before the meet at Nassau
Coliseum. She couldn't hit her
jumps and was worried that her
preparation for the event had not
been sufficient. She felt the
combined load of studies at Stan
ford and training might have
detracted from her skating.
But she went on to win the fig
ures and freestyle and finished
second to Kadavy, of Colorado
Springs, Colo., in the short pro
gram. Then she captured the title
with the help of five spectacular

triple jumps in the free skating
program.
Now she leads a strong Ameri
can trio that also includes Kadavy
and Chin into the World Cham
pionships next month at Geneva.
"If I skate like this when my
practices are not working out,
what will I be able to do in the
Worlds with better practices?"
said Thomas, who still seemed
stunned after her history-making
feat.
"The most 1 had landed in
practice this week was three," she
added of the triple jumps. "In
practice, 1 couldn't land five but
my coach said I would need five to
win. I spent the whole day psych
ing myself for five."
It was time well spent. Thomas'
performance earned four 5.9s (out
of a possible 6.0) and she placed
first on seven of the nine judges'
cards.
"She has only done five triples
twice in her life and in practice she
has never done it," said her coach,
Alex McGowan. "Caryn had been
extremely strong in practice and
she put a lot of pressure on us with
those excellent practices."
Kadavy, who finished second
for her biggest success thus far,
landed three of the four triples she
attempted. She will be making her
first trip to the World Champion
ships.
Chin, making her first appear
ance in competition since finishing
third in the 1985 World Cham
pionships 1 1 months ago, was
third. Chin had been sidelined
with a muscle imbalance.
