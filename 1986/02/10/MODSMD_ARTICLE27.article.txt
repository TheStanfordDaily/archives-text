### PETER CASTILLO Staff writer 
As the season winds down, the Cardinal wrestlers
are beginning to rise to the occasion. The team turned
in its best performance this season during this
weekend's competition.
The Cardinal convincingly defeated Northern
Arizona Friday night 30-21 and the next day captured
fifth in the Biola Invational, in La Mirada, Ca.
"We are preparing for the Pac-10championships by
honing techniques and understanding problems we see
reviewing videotapes," Stanford Coach Chris Horpel
said. "I want the wrestlers giving the extra push during
practice. It is easier to give that extra effort since the
season is coming to an end."
After losing the first two matches to the Lumber
jacks, Stanford's Jeff Bradley, at 134 pounds, was win
ning 7-0 in the second period when Steve Smith
defaulted with an injury. Mark Alex (142 pounds) con
tinued the Cardinal comeback as he pinned Jeff Smith

on the first move at the 1:20 mark in the first period.
Stanford took the lead, 18-12, when 150 pounder
Jeff Hazard pinned Geoff Gonzales in the first period
at the 2:15 mark. Pete Rogers (158 pounds) main
tained the Cardinal charge by beating Wayne Garner
in a physical struggle 8-4. Dave Lee, at 150 pounds,
widened Stanford's lead to 27-12, when he scored a
17-2 technical fall over Vince Cornina.
After Terry Mclntyre's 11-5 loss at 177 pounds,
Stanford led 27-15. The Lumberjacks still could have
tied the meet since the Cardinal was forfeiting at
heavyweight, if Mike Thomas could pin Kurt Kassulke
in the 190-pound match. Kassulke foiled their plans,
however, with a 7-4 victory to give Stanford the win
and raise the team's dual meet record to 5-8-1.
In the Biola Invitational, top-seeded Bradley
showed no negative side effects from his week's layoff
because of a neck injury as he captured his weight
class. In the finals Bradley defeated Cal State-
Bakersfield's Rich Baily, 7-2.
