# Educators fear problems of tax reform
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
This is the introduction of a series of articles
focusing on the effects of recent federal tax legisla
tion on the University.
The passage of tax reform and budget-balancing
measures in Congress will force Stanford to con
front "a disturbing array of problems," said Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy in a letter to the
Board of Trustees last month.
Educational institutions around the country face
a myriad of financial difficulties in the wake of HR
3838, a controversial attempt to reform the na
tion's tax code approved Dec. 17 by the U.S.
House of Representatives. Colleges and univer

sities are now gearing up for a massive effort to
persuade Senate Finance Committee members to
modify the House bill as it begins another long
process of consideration and revision before the
entire Senate votes on the bill in August.
Educators are concerned about provisions in the
bill that reduce tax incentives for charitable dona
tions and restrict the ability of private institutions
to use tax-exempt bonds to finance capital im
provements and new building construction.
In addition, the House bill would require sub
stantial reorganization of pension programs main
tained by universities as well as tax all living
stipends and certain tuition benefits.
Universities expect no better news when the full
effects of the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing

amendment are felt in 1987. The amendment, also
approved last year, mandates a balanced federal
budget by 1991 and requires $ 11.7 billion in cuts in
the 1986 fiscal year. Students are already feeling
the pinch through rising application fees for
federally-funded student loans.
A key provision of the amendment was struck
down on Friday when a special federal judicial
panel ruled that the automatic, across-the-board
spending cuts scheduled to take place if Congress
failed to meet deficit reduction targets violated the
constitutional principle of separation of powers.
The decision also allows the amendment to remain
in effect pending an automatic appeal to the Su-
preme Court.
In addition to its legal setback, the
effects of Gramm-Rudman may be
moderated in the future by some
form of tax increase, such as a na
tional "value-added" sales tax or a
tax on energy consumption.
The tax reform bill gained
notoriety not only for the sweeping
changes in the measure, but also from
its celebrated roller-coaster ride
through the House late last year, as
the Reagan Administrations original
proposal was significantly altered in
the House Ways and Means Commit
tee chaired by Rep. Dan Ros
tenkowski (D-lll.).
To the chagrin of many House
Republicans, Reagan and his staff
chose to ignore GOP member's and
negotiated primarily with Ros
tenkowski and key Democrats on the
committee.
The resulting committee version
bore little resemblance to the presi
dent's proposal. The committee ver
sion increased Reagan's proposed top
individual tax rate from 35 to 38 per
cent, still far below the current 50
percent. The version also reduced top
corporate rates from 46 to 36 per
cent, slightly more than the 33 per
cent proposed by the Administration.
Although the Administration ver
sion called for the elimination of the
deductibility of state and local taxes

and a cut in the effective tax rate on
capital gains from 20 to 17.5 percent,
the Ways and Means proposal kept
the state and local tax deduction and
increased the effective top rate on
capital gains to 22 percent.
Despite reservations by White
House advisers and many business
groups about the possible economic
effects of the resulting committee bill,
Reagan reluctantly supported the
measure in hopes that it might be im
proved by the Republican-controlled
Senate Finance Committee before
reaching the Senate floor.
Political analysts agreed that
Reagan's less than hearty support was
also necessary to avoid handing Dem
ocrats a potential political plum ot a
major legislative defeat for the presi
dent with this year's congressional
elections fast approaching.
After Ways and Means approval in
the early morning hours of Nov. 23,
the bill went to the entire House floor
for consideration.
Still smarting from being virtually
ignored by the president and his ad
visers in committee and concerned
that the reform measure would dis
courage investment and leave per
sonal tax rates too high, House
Republicans handed the Administra
tion an embarrassing defeat in a cru
cial procedural vote that would have
allowed debate on the reform mea
sure on the House floor.
Sensing the need to stem the tide of
Republican defections. Treasury Sec
retary James Baker II and White

House Chief of Staff Donald Regan
began urgent meetings with House
GOP leaders, and Reagan later made
an uncharacteristically desperate trip
to Capitol Hill to shore up support for
the ailing measure.
In meetings with House
Republicans, Reagan pledged to veto
any bill that did not contain a $2,000
personal exemption for all middle
income taxpayers, a top individual
rate of 25 percent, and undetermined
"incentives" for industry, placating
many wary congressmen.
Reagan's celebrated powers of per
suasion assuaged enough members to
assure passage by the entire House on
Dec. 17, but in a very uncharacteristic
manner. In keeping with usual proce
dure, the House speaker called for a
voice vote on passage and, despite
many loud "nays," declared the bill
approved.
A surprised Tip O'Neill waited for
opponents of the measure to make
the usual procedural request for a roll
call vote, but the request was not
made by the apparently confused Re
publican leadership.
The bill now awaits action by the
Senate Finance Committee, chaired
by Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), a
GOP moderate who has pledged to
be independent from Administration
"deals." After a committee version is
approved in April, the bill will move
to the Senate floor for consideration,
and Administration officials hope to
secure passage before this year's Au
gust recess.

cent, slightly more than the 33 per
cent proposed by the Administration.
Although the Administration ver
sion called for the elimination of the
deductibility of state and local taxes

and a cut in the effective tax rate on
capital gains from 20 to 17.5 percent,
the Ways and Means proposal kept
the state and local tax deduction and
increased the effective top rate on
capital gains to 22 percent.
Despite reservations by White
House advisers and many business
groups about the possible economic
effects of the resulting committee bill,
Reagan reluctantly supported the
measure in hopes that it might be im
proved by the Republican-controlled
Senate Finance Committee before
reaching the Senate floor.
Political analysts agreed that
Reagan's less than hearty support was
also necessary to avoid handing Dem
ocrats a potential political plum ot a
major legislative defeat for the presi
dent with this year's congressional
elections fast approaching.
After Ways and Means approval in
the early morning hours of Nov. 23,
the bill went to the entire House floor
for consideration.
Still smarting from being virtually
ignored by the president and his ad
visers in committee and concerned
that the reform measure would dis
courage investment and leave per
sonal tax rates too high, House
Republicans handed the Administra
tion an embarrassing defeat in a cru
cial procedural vote that would have
allowed debate on the reform mea
sure on the House floor.
Sensing the need to stem the tide of
Republican defections. Treasury Sec
retary James Baker II and White

House Chief of Staff Donald Regan
began urgent meetings with House
GOP leaders, and Reagan later made
an uncharacteristically desperate trip
to Capitol Hill to shore up support for
the ailing measure.
In meetings with House
Republicans, Reagan pledged to veto
any bill that did not contain a $2,000
personal exemption for all middle
income taxpayers, a top individual
rate of 25 percent, and undetermined
"incentives" for industry, placating
many wary congressmen.
Reagan's celebrated powers of per
suasion assuaged enough members to
assure passage by the entire House on
Dec. 17, but in a very uncharacteristic
manner. In keeping with usual proce
dure, the House speaker called for a
voice vote on passage and, despite
many loud "nays," declared the bill
approved.
A surprised Tip O'Neill waited for
opponents of the measure to make
the usual procedural request for a roll
call vote, but the request was not
made by the apparently confused Re
publican leadership.
The bill now awaits action by the
Senate Finance Committee, chaired
by Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), a
GOP moderate who has pledged to
be independent from Administration
"deals." After a committee version is
approved in April, the bill will move
to the Senate floor for consideration,
and Administration officials hope to
secure passage before this year's Au
gust recess.
This is the introduction of a series of articles
focusing on the effects of recent federal tax legisla
tion on the University.
The passage of tax reform and budget-balancing
measures in Congress will force Stanford to con
front "a disturbing array of problems," said Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy in a letter to the
Board of Trustees last month.
Educational institutions around the country face
a myriad of financial difficulties in the wake of HR
3838, a controversial attempt to reform the na
tion's tax code approved Dec. 17 by the U.S.
House of Representatives. Colleges and univer

sities are now gearing up for a massive effort to
persuade Senate Finance Committee members to
modify the House bill as it begins another long
process of consideration and revision before the
entire Senate votes on the bill in August.
Educators are concerned about provisions in the
bill that reduce tax incentives for charitable dona
tions and restrict the ability of private institutions
to use tax-exempt bonds to finance capital im
provements and new building construction.
In addition, the House bill would require sub
stantial reorganization of pension programs main
tained by universities as well as tax all living
stipends and certain tuition benefits.
Universities expect no better news when the full
effects of the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing

amendment are felt in 1987. The amendment, also
approved last year, mandates a balanced federal
budget by 1991 and requires $ 11.7 billion in cuts in
the 1986 fiscal year. Students are already feeling
the pinch through rising application fees for
federally-funded student loans.
A key provision of the amendment was struck
down on Friday when a special federal judicial
panel ruled that the automatic, across-the-board
spending cuts scheduled to take place if Congress
failed to meet deficit reduction targets violated the
constitutional principle of separation of powers.
The decision also allows the amendment to remain
in effect pending an automatic appeal to the Su-
preme Court.
In addition to its legal setback, the
effects of Gramm-Rudman may be
moderated in the future by some
form of tax increase, such as a na
tional "value-added" sales tax or a
tax on energy consumption.
The tax reform bill gained
notoriety not only for the sweeping
changes in the measure, but also from
its celebrated roller-coaster ride
through the House late last year, as
the Reagan Administrations original
proposal was significantly altered in
the House Ways and Means Commit
tee chaired by Rep. Dan Ros
tenkowski (D-lll.).
To the chagrin of many House
Republicans, Reagan and his staff
chose to ignore GOP member's and
negotiated primarily with Ros
tenkowski and key Democrats on the
committee.
The resulting committee version
bore little resemblance to the presi
dent's proposal. The committee ver
sion increased Reagan's proposed top
individual tax rate from 35 to 38 per
cent, still far below the current 50
percent. The version also reduced top
corporate rates from 46 to 36 per
cent, slightly more than the 33 per
cent proposed by the Administration.

deductibility of state and local taxes
