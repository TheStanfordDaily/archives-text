### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
Not only did the fifth-ranked Stan
ford men's volleyball team lose the
game at No. 9 Long Beach State
Friday, but the Cardinal also lost the
services of All-American Jon Root,
who suffered a sprained ankle.
However, Saturday night Stanford
rebounded with a victory over 11th
ranked San Diego State.
Stanford, 5-1 overall and 4-1 in
California Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association (CIVA) play after the
weekend, lost to the Long Beach
State 49ers (9-3 overall, 2-1 in the
CIV A) in five games, 15-11, 11-15,
12-15, 15-11, 9-15.
The Cardinal aided the Long
Beach cause with I 1 service er
rors and a hitting percentage of only
.226. "We made a iot of hitting er
rors," Stanford team captain Brett
Monello said. "They needed a lot of
help from us to win. Stanford made
mistakes and had an off day
defensively."
Long Beach, on the other hand,
was extremely consistent and had an
incredible defensive effort, acccord
ing to Monello. "We had hot and cold
streaks, we couldn't side out consis
tently," he said. "Long Beach played
its best game of the year, Stanford
played its worst."
As if the loss itself wasn't enough,
senior outside hitter Jon Root went
down with a severe ankle sprain in
the match and will be out for about a
week. The injury to Root, who is
second on the team in kills, could
prove to be a big factor when the
Cardinal takes on top-ranked Pep
perdine this evening.
The injury, which Monello
descibed as "extremely painful," oc
curred during a blocking play when
Root came down on setter Steve
Modory. "Friday night was frustrat
ing," Root said. "That was the first
time 1 went out of a game. It was
tough to see the team go down in the
fifth game."
For Stanford, senior outside hitter
Chris Braun had 19 kills. Sophomore
Scott Fortune recorded 16 kills and
â€¢mior Stephen Blue made 15 kills in

24 attempts for a .541 percentage.
Saturday the Cardinal came up
with a good all-around team effort in
defeating San Diego State 15-7, 15-4,
15-2. The match was impressive for a
number of reasons. Not only was
Stanford without the services of
Root, hut also the Aztecs were com
ing off a win over No. 4 UC-Santa
Barbara the night before, and last
week took Pepperdine to five games.
The match took only 40 minutes,
an amazingly quick time for a col
legiate volleyball contest. The Card
inal beat last place St. Mary's in 42
minutes earlier this year. The loss
dropped San Diego State to 2-2 over
all, 1-2 in the conference.
All-American candidate Braun
again led Stanford with 13 kills. He
also had a .473 average. Middle
blocker Fortune had 10 kills and a

.368 average, while Monello. starting
in place of Root, scored eight kills
and four service aces. Blue again hit
for a very high average, this time ah
incredible .777, as he had seven kills.
The team as a whole had a hitting
percentage of .46K and totaled seven
service aces.
"Steve Modory set a masterful
game, he had their blockeis baffled,"
Monello said. "We got every thing
and minimized our errors.,'l'he key to
the win was our consistency.
"The victory was extremely impor
tant. We have to do as well as we can
without Jon Root: it's nice to know
we can win without him," Monello
added.
"Saturday was our best team effort
this season.' Root said. "Stanford
showed a lot of unity. Brett did a
good job, he took charge and had.the

hot hand. You've got to give him
credit for the organization and team
leadership."
Stanford Co-coach Fred Sturm
called the triumph "the most consis
tent effort from the men's volleyball
team this season."
The squad faces defending national
champion Pepperdine tonight in the
last match of a six-day, four-game
road trip. The Waves arc playing un
der new coach Rod Wilde, who took
over after Marv Dunphy left to take
charge of the U.S. Women's Volley
ball Team.
"Pepperdine has been playing
well," Monello said. "They have a
quick offense and a lot of power.
After Saturday, we're positive about
Pepperdine and we're looking for
ward to the game."
