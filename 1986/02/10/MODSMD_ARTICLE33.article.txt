# Cagers drop another against Fresno State
## Late Stanford comeback falls short 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
For those 7,200 who packed
Maples Pavilion Saturday afternoon,
the Pacific 10 Conference showdown
between Stanford and Arizona
showcased excitement, superb strat
egy and some of the best talent in the
conference, notables like Steve Kerr,
Howard Wright and Novian Whitsitt.
A few hours later, the setting was
the same. Only this time, 200 faithful
fans scattered themselves throughout
the lower bleachers of a nearly empty
Maples Pavilion to watch hoopsters
like Stanford guard Erica Mueser, not
as notable but just as talented, add a
little spice to an already spicy
women's basketball game between
Stanford and the Fresno State Bull
dogs.
All told, a spirited Cardinal come
back in the second half fell short, 65-
62, but Mueser made the stronger
Bulldogs (16-5) feel like they were
lucky to get out of the pound alive.
With 38 seconds left in the game,
Fresno State was trying to protect a
63-61 lead by running as much time
as it could from the 30-second shot
clock.
But before Bulldog standout Shan
non McGee could dribble added pre
cious seconds off the game clock,
Mueser stripped the ball free and fed
a driving Virginia Sourlis, who was
fouled on the way to the hoop.
With four seconds left and the
game hanging in the balance, there's
no one else that Stanford would want
on the foul line other than Sourlis, an
81 percent free throw shooter this
season. Unfortunately, she made only
the second of two attempts, leaving
the Bulldogs in command. Two sub
sequent free throws by 5-foot-4
guard Wendy Martel sealed the Bull
dog victory.

Captained by Martel, the Bulldogs
jumped on top of Stanford, 36-26, in
the first half. She and McGee, shoot
ing over a 3-2 Stanford zone, ac
counted for 23 of Fresno State's first
half points.
"We made some key mistakes, par
ticularly on defense," Stanford Coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "Our zone
didn't match up against their
shooters. We left number 41
(McGee) wide open on two shots."
While Stanford's defense did a bet
ter job at containing Martel and
McGee in the second half, Mueser's
dead-eye shooting from the outside
brought the Cardinal within striking
distance.
Mueser, along with her normal
sturdy defensive effort, canned five of
seven shots from the perimeter
during the second stanza. She
finished with a season-high 16 points.
Sourlis and forward Kami Ander
son also added some vital hoops
down the stretch. Anderson only had
three baskets for the game, but those
came during the waning moments of
the contest when Stanford needed
some crucial shots.
It was Sourlis' rainbow jumper
from what seemed like Mountain
View with 38 seconds remaining that
brought the Cardinal within two. She
finished with 15.
Stanford played the Bulldogs toug
her than it did when it last faced
Fresno State in a 64-50 loss in January.
VanDerveer believed that Mueser
made the difference.
"Erica was sick last time," she said.
"We couldn't match her up against
Martel and that hurt us. Erica's
definitely the best defensive ball
player we have."
The Cardinal returns to action a
week from today, when it meets arch
rival California in a 7:30 p.m. contest
at Maples.
