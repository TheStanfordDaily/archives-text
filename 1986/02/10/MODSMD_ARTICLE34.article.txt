### TRACY POTTER Staff Writer 
South triumphed over North at
the Stanford women's gymnastics
meet in Maples Pavilion Friday
evening.
Four teams competed in the
1986 Cardinal Classic. Highly
regarded Fullerton State edged out
the Cardinal for first, 182.85 to
178.70. Behind the top finishers
were Oregon, with an overall total
of 171.45, and the University of
Alberta with a tally of 165.7.
Fullerton Coach Lynn Rogers
said of the Stanford squad,"They
ran with us for three events. . .it
was impressive. They couldn't have
done that four years ago."
Fullerton junior Callie Glanton
and Stanford freshman Heather
Thomas tied for first place in the
all-around competition with scores
of 37.1. Senior Roni Barrios, also
from Fullerton, tallied a 36.75 all
around total for third.
"Our whole team has gone
through the flu, so we're lucky to be
healthy tonight," said Glanton.
As for the overall performance,
Thomas said, "It felt right; we
just hit. We didn't expect to tie,
though."
The top all-around score for
Stanford was a 35.90 fifth-place
finish by Cheryl Doo. "I'm really
happy — our team is improving
every week," she said. "Our goal is
to make it to NCAAs, and it looks
like we're on our way."
The highest score in any event at
the meet, a 9.7, went to Stanford
freshman Jinny Rhee after a daz
zling performance on the uneven
bars. "I was happy — that was the
highest score I've ever gotten on
bars," Rhee said.
"That Jinny Rhee is something
else," Stanford Coach Homer Sar
dina remarked. Rhee was unable to
compete in the all-around due to a
minor ankle injury.

For Oregon, it was freshman
Nicky Eden who stood out, with
scores of 9.25 in the uneven bars
and the floor exercise. Eden took
fourth place in the all- around com
petition with a total of 35.95.
Sardina's evaluation of the meet
was generally positive. "1 think we
performed better in vault and in the
floor exercise. We had some prob
lems on bars, in spite of two out
standing performances by
Goldsmith and Rhee. All in all,
we're improving on a weekly basis,

and that's something to be proud
of," he said.
"1 sure wish we had Beth and
Jinny in the all-around though,"'
Sardina added. Talented sopho
more Beth Pope injured her knee
in a meet against UCLA three
weeks ago and has been unable to
compete since. It is still unclear
whether or not she will be out for
the season. Rhee, with an ankle in
jury, seems to be recovering and
should be back in the all-around
competition soon.
