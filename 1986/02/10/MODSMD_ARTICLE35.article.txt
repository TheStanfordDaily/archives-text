# Swimmers continue win streak
## 
### AMY FRANCETIC Staff writer 
In a fairly low-key meet Friday, the
Stanford men's swim team destroyed
Hayward State and Sacramento State
at Hayward. Stanford dealt both the
host Pioneers and Hornets losses, 65-
29 and 66-27, respectively. The
Cardinal increased its consecutive
dual meet victory streak to 42.
Only eight men traveled to the Di
vision 111 college this weekend, and of
those eight, sophomore Colin Bole
won two events â€” the 100-yard
freestyle in 40.06 and the 200
freestyle in 1:44.32. "It was a very
casual meet, so the times weren't par
ticularly fast," Bole said.
However, quite a few swimmers
turned in their quickest races of the
year in the Hayward pool. Freshman
Dave Schraven finished first in the
200 individual medley with his
season-best time of 1:56.7.
Schraven also placed second in the
200 breaststroke and swam a leg on
the 400 medley relay which placed
first.
"I was pretty happy with my races
considering the circumstances,"
Schraven said. "It was cold, and we
were swimming without rest after a
week of hard training."
Junior Mike Meyer also swam well
in the 1,000 freestyle to record his
season-best time of 9:38.81. Fresh
man Randy Von Feldt won the 200
backstroke in 2:02.56, and junior
Moffit Timlake went 4:41.26 in the
500 freestyle.
The quartet of Von Feldt, Bart
Wells, Schraven and Andrew Parnell
captured the medley relay for the
Cardinal, while Hayward captured
the 400 freestyle relay. The 400
freestyle relay along with the 50
freestyle and 200 breaststroke were
the only events Stanford failed to win.
