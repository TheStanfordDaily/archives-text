This afternoon the Stanford
women's softball team will have an
opportunity to make its mark in the
winner's circle when it hosts Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo in a 1:30 p.m.
doubleheader at Baylands Field.
The two teams met only once last
season at the Santa Barbara Tourna
ment where the Mustangs beat the
Cardinal in a close game. However,
the players agree that they must in
crease their offensive output in order
to win games this season.
In Thursday's two-fold loss to San
Jose State, the team scored only one
run in 14 innings, on a bases-loaded
walk.
The team has no special plan of at
tack for the Mustangs in today's
game. "They're good hitters and just
a solid team all the way around," Lisa

Buchanan said of Cal Poly. Buchanan
is slated to pitch the first game for the
Cardinal.
Betsy Watson, who will start on the
mound for Stanford in the second
contest described her game plan. "I'll
just throw my normal pitches and let
the defense back me up," she said.
Today's starting lineup will include
senior Allison Selleck at third base in
place of Christy Fiscalini, who injured
her knee Thursday and will be out of
action for some time.
Anna Sanchez will start at first base
for the Cardinal along with Kathy
Dominguez at second and Laura Bu
chanan at shortstop. K.K. Bush, Mar
garet Pezzini and Maria De La Rosa
will start in the outfield.
In keeping with the spirit of the
new season the Cardinal women have
found a new home playing field at
Baylands Field in Palo Alto.
