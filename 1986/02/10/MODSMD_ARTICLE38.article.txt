Hoping to rebound from some rough going in its last tournament, the
Stanford women's golf team begins play in the 54-hole Arizona Intercol
legiate, which runs through Wednesday at the Randolph Golf Course in
Tucson.
The third-ranked Cardinal finished in a 12th-place tie at the Okla
homa State Intercollegiate in Guadalajara, Jan. 26-28, but Coach Tim
Baldwin hoped that a less alien environment would encourage better
results.
"We only had one player who had ever been out of the country (Kay
Cornelius)," Baldwin said. "We were the only team down there that did
not play in the tournament last year. Our performance was pretty good
but we lacked a lot of knowledge.
"(The Arizona) is a familiar tournament for us," he said. "We've
beaten everybody in this field.
"I anticipate strong performances from Arizona State, USC and
UCLA," Baldwin added. "The tournament will be between ASU, USC,
UCLA and Stanford, with Texas as a dark horse."
Rejoining the squad will be Julie Carmichael, who missed the last
tournament because of her business school entrance exams. Curtis Cup
team member Kathleen McCarthy, Kathy Kostas, Trish McGonigle and
Cornelius comprise the rest of the team.
Clare Dolan missed making the team by one shot in a 54-hole
qualifier held last week.
"Since we've been back, each and every girl has worked very hard on
her game," Baldwin said. "We've had very good practices."
