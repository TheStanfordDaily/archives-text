# Card goes to Idaho, notches three firsts

### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
Yesterday afternoon 30 of Stan
ford's track and field athletes took
part in the Boise State Invitational,
Idaho's first indoor track meet ever.
For the Stanford squad, composed
mainly of the team's least experi
enced members, it was a long bus
ride, but it was also a chance to com
pete.
Many of Stanford's top athletes
decided to stay home and train for the
upcoming outdoor season, so the
team wasn't at full strength. But there
were still a few individual athletes
who conquered the thin Idaho air and
competed well.
Hurdler Jay Thorson was the high
est placing male taking second in the
55 hurdles with a time of 7.38
seconds. And in the last event of the
evening, the 1,600 relay, the Cardianl

snatched third with a time of 3:40.7.
It wasn't a bad meet for the Stan
ford men, but they were certainly
outdone by their female teammates.
The Cardinal women also left with
four placewinners, but three of their
athletes found themselves standing in
the winners circle.
Followers of Stanford track have
come to expect good things from
freshman Patty Purpur and high
jumper Lisa Bernhagen, and once
again they weren't disappointed. Pur
pur won the women's shot put with a
throw of 50-foot-8.
Bernhagen, a native Idahoan,
returned home in a grand fashion.
She had no problems winning the
high jump with a leap of 6-feet even.
And in the women's 500 Pam
Board teamed with Michelle
McMahon to take two of the top four
places. Board's time of 1:18.5 earned
her the victory and McMahon's
1:22.1 was good for fourth.
