# Controversial AIDS study
## Hoover fellows asked to consult 
### STEVE STREED Staff writer 
Two Hoover Institution scholars
confirmed yesterday they had been
approached about working as consul
tants on a controversial study to
develop methods of containing
Aquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS) for the military,
according to the University News
Service.
Senior fellows Richard Staar and
Rita Ricardo-Campbell said they
were contacted last fall about per
sonal consulting in political and eco
nomic analyses for a study by the Ad
vanced Investigation of Medical Sci
ence Group and the Institute for Can
cer Research. Both are based at the
Pacific Medical Center in San Fran
cisco.
The Defense Department is con
sidering providing $12.5 million dol
lars for the study, which may require
"extreme public health measures . . .
in direct conflict with the constitu
tion," according to the proposal for
the study by the two groups.
Although the extreme measures
mentioned in the proposal were not
described, a memorandum circ
ulated among the proposal's initiators
at the Pacific Medical Center dis
cussed "mandatory and overt identi
fication" of AIDS victims and a "Star
of David concept," the San Francisco
Examiner reported yesterday.

The proposal mentions "the Con
sultative Group of Senior Scholars,
Hoover Institute, (and) Stanford
University" and says they will be paid
to "assess current knowledge" on
AIDS and study "legal, ethical and
political considerations" of AIDS
containment measures, the Examiner
said.
"This is not a University venture
... if it were, it would require various
approvals which as far as I know have
neither been sought nor granted."
University President Donald Ken
nedy said yesterday in an interview
with the University News Service.
Staar, Ricardo-Campbell and
Hoover Institution Director W.
Clenn Campell stressed that the
Hoover Institution would not be as
sociated with the study.
"We were to do this as consultants
. . . as individuals on our own time, on
weekends . . . this was not to be an
Institution, not a Hoover doing: we
made that clear (to the originators of
the proposal)," Staar said to the news
service yesterday.
In a telephone interview with The
Daily last night, Kennedy said that
the University has "an institutional
policy that faculty and staff can do
consulting on weekends" and on their
own time.
