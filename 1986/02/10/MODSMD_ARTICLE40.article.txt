Spy swap to take place tomorrow
BONN, West Germany — The planned spy swap between East and
West will take place as planned tomorrow on the Glienicke Bridge be
tween West Berlin and East Germany, government sources here told
Deutsche Presse-Agentur, the German news agency yesterday.
It is "very unlikely" that these plans will be changed, sources said.
Several other sites and dates for the swap, involving five Eastern and five
Western agents, had been mentioned recently, after dozens of jour
nalists from all over the world descended on the prospective scene of the
exchange.
It was also confirmed here that the Soviet Union intends to include in
the swap dissident and human-rights activist Anatoly Shcharansky, who
was sentenced to prison and forced labor in the Soviet Union because of
alleged espionage.
But, according to the West German tabloid Bild, Shcharansky will not
be among those exchanged on the Glienicke Bridge, but will be released
in a place not previously used in a spy swap. The report said he was ex
pected to arrive in East Berlin today.
Meanwhile, organizations of Soviet immigrants in Israel said they
were preparing a festive welcome for Shcharansky, and they reported,
although this was not confirmed, that Prime Minister Shimon Peres
would attend.
There were conflicting reports about the whereabouts of
Shcharansky's wife, Avital. The spokesman of one immigrant organiza
tion said Avital had already left Israel for West Germany.
But former Soviet dissidents said she would not be leaving for Europe
until tonight. Avital went into hiding from the press in a kibbutz in
northern Israel when rumors about her husband's imminent release first
started circulating.
Reports here said the Kremlin is planning to include top members of
the West German intelligence agency BND, who have been serving
prison sentences in Eastern bloc countries, in the spy swap.
Former BND agent Christa-Karin Schumann, serving a sentence in
East Germany, who headed Bonn's list for the proposed swap, will not
be included.
The West will release one couple, one ethnic German and one Polish
citizen, all sentenced for spying for the East bloc. The government in
Warsaw, Poland, confirmed reports that Jerzy Kaczmarek, who was ar
rested in West Germany last march, will be among the agents to be
released.
Price war could send oil below $10
MANAMA, Bahrain — An authoritative Middle Eastern oil publica
tion predicted yesterday that the current petroleum price war would last
between three and six months and drive prices below $ 10 per barrel.
The Middle East Economic Survey, based in Nicosia, Cyprus, said
however that a durable settlement was likely to re-emerge at the end,
with the prices of crude oil subsequently stabilizing at a level between
$20 and $25 per barrel.
The publication said that the current price confrontation was being
driven by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, "the key
grouping which alone has necessary oil muscle" capable of affecting con
ditions on the international market.
"They feel that the market-share confrontation — however im
palatable it may be — is in fact the only available alternative which could
lead to the establishment of production discipline among all significant
net exporters of oil, and thus to a restoration and restabilization of prices
at an appropriate level," it said.
The publication said that other countries want an end to the market
vendetta, which is being waged largely against Britain and Norway, non-
OPEC producers of North Sea oil, because of drastically lowered reve
nues and uncertainties about the market.
But it said these countries had no chance of pushing their viewpoints
through without the backing of the Saudi-led group.
The governor of Nigeria's central bank. Alhaji Ahmed, was quoted by
the publication as saying his country "had no other option" than increas
ing its production to meet budgetary requirements.
But he refused to confirm or deny reports that Nigeria had now set
first-quarter production targets close to its capacity of around 2 million
barrels daily, a level that substantially exceeds its 1.3 million barrels per
day share under the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
quota system.
Wife says Mandela will be freed
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Winnie Mandela, wife of im
prisoned African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, for almost
a quarter of a century the symbol of black resistance to South Africa's
apartheid system, said yesterday that his release is only a matter of time.
Although she did not know when her husband would be freed, the
question now is "when" and not "if," Winnie Mandela said on her
return here from a visit to Cape Town's Pollsmoor Prison, where the
black leader is being held. It was her second visit to the prison in less
than a week.
Her optimistic comments and the visits themselves — she plans an
other early next week — added to the growing speculation that the
South African government is actively negotiating terms for Nelson Man
dela's release and that it could come quickly.
"I do not have the slightest idea when or where he will be released,"
Winnie Mandela said, "but he will be released."
Six more blacks, three of them policemen, were killed in the country's
continuing civil strife yesterday.
The policemen were shot and hacked to death as they tried to stop a
fight between about 500 feuding Zulu and Pondo tribesmen at Aman
zimtoti, south of Durban on the Indian Ocean coast. More than 150 per
sons have died in the fighting between the rival tribes there during the
past three months, mostly over the influx of thousands of Pondos
seeking work in Durban, traditionally Zulu territory.
Pope stands firm on birth control
BOMBAY. India — Pope John Paul II restated Roman Catholic
doctrine on birth control and abortion here yesterday firmly putting to
rest fears among some of his more devout followers that he would soft
pedal the issue, a sensitive one in overpopulated India where the govern
ment promotes family planning but where more Catholics than Hindus
reportedly practice birth control.
Before the pope left Rome Jan. 31 for his 10-day "pilgrimage of
peace" in India, a senior Catholic bishop here was quoted as hoping that
John Paul would ignore the subject. In the past, the government has
forced birth control measures on the populace, which has burgeoned
from 480 million when Pope Paul VI visited Bombay in 1964 to 750 mil
lion today.
India still promotes all methods of birth control except forced
sterilization, which the late Sanjay Gandhi, brother of the present prime
minister, pushed to the point of political crisis for his mother, the assas
sinated Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
But despite polite efforts by Indian churchmen during the trip's plan
ning stages to persuade the pope that the subject be avoided. John Paul
repeated exactly what he has said on all of his other trips abroad.
"All human life is sacred from the moment of conception," he told a
Mass for about 200.000 in a Bombay park yesterday."It is the task of all
mankind to reject whatever wounds, weakens or destroys human life —
whatever offends the dignity of i>ny human being."
And to emphasize his total and well-known condemnation of artificial
methods of birth control, even in overpopulated countries, he cited
modern India's most heroic figure. Mohandas Gandhi.
"Suspension of procreation" cannot be achieved "by immoral and ar
tificial checks ... but by a life of discipline and self-control," the pope
said, quoting the great Indian apostle of peace.
