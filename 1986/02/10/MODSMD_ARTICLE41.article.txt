## Vote counters protest election 
### 
MANILA, Philippines — Thirty employees of a
government vote-counting center walked off their
jobs last night to protest what they said was the fal
sification of results from Friday's election contest
between President Ferdinand Marcos and Corazon
Aquino.
The walkout from the counting center of the gov
ernment's Commission on Elections, a Marcos
appointed body known as Comelec, came as the
center's tabulations showed Marcos holding a slim
lead in unofficial returns. The dramatic protest was
the most damaging example to date of massive
election fraud engineered to keep Marcos in power,
opposition leaders said.
A rival count by an independent civic group,
known as Namfrel, which the Marcos government
has been seeking to discredit, puts Aquino ahead
by a substantial margin.
Under Philippine law, the formal canvassing of
election returns will be done by the National As
sembly, which is to meet later today. But the elec
tion commission and Namfrel have been conduct
ing separate unofficial counts since the polls closed
Friday. These counts were intended to establish a
winner in the public mind and allay fears of
manipulation if returns were delayed.
Cardinal Jaime Sin, archbishop of Manila,

praised Namfrel and condemned "widespread dis
enfranchisement of qualified voters" in the elec
tion. He urged students, teachers and laborers to
stay away from classes and jobs today and to con
tinue vigils at vote-counting centers.
In an interview yesterday on ABC-TV, Sen.
Richard Lugar (R-lnd.), who heads a group of 20
U.S. observers sent by President Reagan to moni
tor the elections here, warned that the presidential
election is "teetering on the brink of disaster/'
Marcos, in back-to-back interviews on U.S. tele
vision yesterday, said that there is "no intent to
cancel the elections because of fraud charges." Ap
pearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," Marcos also
said he was "disappointed" at his showing so far in
unofficial returns, but, he said, "this lowering of the
votes for me was due to some anomalies."
He denied allegations of fraud or delay in the
vote count, blaming instead stormy weather in the
Philippines. Manila's weather bureau reported fair
weather in the region.
Last night as of 10:10 p.m. (6:10 a.m. PST),
Namfrel said it had counted returns from 49 per
cent of the precincts and showed Aquino ahead
with 5,576,319 votes to 4,806,166 for Marcos.
Comelec, however, with 28 percent of the
precincts counted, had Marcos leading 3,056,236

to 2,903,348 as of 7 p.m. yesterday (3 a.m. PST).
In the walkout, two representatives of the
employees said early yesterday that they left after a
day of agonizing over the public posting of results
that differed significantly from those they had tab
ulated. Many of the employees were sobbing and
evidently frightened as they left the counting center
and took refuge in a Roman Catholic church.
The employees, most of them computer terminal
operators, appeared before reporters at the church
at about 1:45 a.m. after composing themselves for
more than three hours. Although they were tilmed
and photographed, they declined to give their
names, citing fears for their safety.
"We have walked out for purely professional
reasoas," said a spokeswoman for the group, one of
more than 100 computer terminal operators
recently hired for the "quick count" operation of
the government body reponsible for overseeing
Philippine elections. "We feel that we have been
used."
"We noticed that the generated output was not
the same values as we were inputing," she said.
Other employees told reporters privately that the
mysterious results that initially aroused their
suspicions had added more than 100,000 voU to
Marcos' total.
