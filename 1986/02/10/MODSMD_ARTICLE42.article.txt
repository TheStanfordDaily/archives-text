# Haiti forces round up militia

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti —
Policemen and army troops rounded
up members of Haiti's long-feared
political militia yesterday, saving
some of them from vengeance
minded mobs, as the country's new
government sought to consolidate its
authority.
In morning Masses, the Catholic
Church praised the downfall of Presi
dent Jean-Claude Duvalier, calling
his departure a "national liberation,"
and appealed to the public for peace
and forgiveness. But an unknown
number of militiamen, known as Ton
tons Macoutes, or "bogeymen," were
hunted down and beaten by the
neighbors whom they once
dominated with intimidation and vio
lence.
It was the third day of bloody
retribution in Haitian streets after
Duvalier fled the country for tempo
rary refuge in France before dawn
Friday and a military-led governing
council assumed power.
A foreign diplomat who has been
monitoring developments here said
that the roundup of militiamen by the
security forces is part of efforts by the
government to impose order and con
solidate its power.
Sporadic gunfire was heard in Port
au-Prince throughout yesterday. A
curfew was in force from 2 p.m. to 6
a.m., but it was not being observed
during the afternoon hours of
daylight.

At 4 p.m., light vehicle and
pedestrian traffic moved along city
streets. Soldiers with automatic rifles,
patrolling in pickups, made no at
tempt to clear the streets.
Normally, the streets would have

been filled with people celebrating
the beginning of Haiti's pre-Lenten
carnival, which now has been
postponed indefinitely by the author
ities.
The Tontons Macoutes are the

most obvious target of hate and
reprisals, because for 28 years they
repressed the Haitian people with a
vengeance.
Jean-Claude Duvalier's father,
Francois "Papa Doc" Duvalier
formed a corps of toughs and thugs to
defend his regime after he took office
as an elected president Oct. 22, 1957,
during a period of political turmoil.
They soon were dubbed Tontons
Macoutes.
Tonton Macoute literally means
"Uncle Knapsack" in Creole, the
popular language of Haiti, where the
official language is French. In Haitian
folklore, Tonton Macoute was a giant
who strode from mountain to moun
tain, picking up bad children and put
ting them in his knapsack.
The elder Duvalier's Tontons
Macoutes were distinguished by their
attire — dark glasses, dark suits and
pearl gray homburg hats. Working
without pay, they used brute force to
crush dissidents and extortion to ex
tract a living from the population.
In 1958, after an attempt was made
to overthrow the elder Duvalier, he
created a force of uniformed
militiamen, named the National Se
curity Volunteers and answerable
only to the president, to counter
balance the power of the army. The
Tontons Macoutes were eventually
incorporated into the militia, which
thereafter also became known as the
Tontons Macoutes.
