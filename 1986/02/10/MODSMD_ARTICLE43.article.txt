Shuttle seals were faulty
WASHINGTON — Some of the rubber seals
that protect a space shuttle's booster rockets
from burning through the wall, the kind of prob
lem that apparently doomed Challenger, have
failed at least 12 times on previous missions, cur
rent and former NASA officials said yesterday.
In all previous cases, according to the officials,
backup seals prevented the boosters' white-hot
gases from burning through. Had both rings
failed, the earlier shuttle flights could have sus
tained the kind of booster burn-through that is
thought to have led to the explosion that
destroyed Challenger Jan. 28.
The seals are 12-foot-diameter rings of syn
thetic rubber, called 0-rings, that encircle each
segment of the booster at levels where its seg
ments are joined. Each booster is made up of
four fuel-containing cylindrical segments that are
stacked so that the lip of one segmer.i slides into
a deep groove on the other.
Inside each groove are two O-rings that are
supposed to seal the gap and prevent the

booster's high-pressure exhaust gases from
leaking. The first O-ring is supposed to be suffici
ent, but a secondary O-ring. running parallel to
the first, is installed as a backup if the first burns
through.
Acting NASA administrator William Graham
said yesterday that the plume of flame that burst
through the wall of Challenger's right-hand
booster was at or near the joint between the two
lower segments.
Midgetman is endorsed
WASHINGTON — The chairman of the
House Armed Services Committee yesterday en
dorsed increased spending on the Midgetman
missile, decribing it as a "rare kind of weapon
that should garner support from liberals and con
servatives alike."
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), a longtime advocate
of the Midgetman, released a report by his com
mittee's staff that found the mobile, single
warhead intercontinental ballistic missile to be a

cost-effective competitor to the 10-warhead MX.
Congress has authorized deployment of 50 MX
missiles and initial funding for a successor
weapon popularly dubbed Midgetman.
The staff report found that Midgetman "makes
a significant contribution to closing the window
of ICBM vulnerability" because so many enemy
warheads would be required to assure its destruc
tion.
Klinghoffer widow dies
Marilyn Klinghoffer, whose husband Leon was
murdered in the hijacking of the cruise ship Ac
hille Lauro and who began a campaign to enlist
citizens as "foot soldiers in the battle against ter
rorism," died of cancer yesterday in a New York
hospital. She was 59.
Leon Klinghoffer, 69, was shot as he sat in his
wheelchair and his body dumped overboard
when Palestinian hijackers seized the Italian
cruiseliner last Oct. 7 as it sailed the Mediter
ranean off Port Said, Egypt.
