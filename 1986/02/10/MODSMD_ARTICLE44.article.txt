BODEGA BAY — As an intensive air-sea
search went on, hope faded for the survival yes
terday of four missing people from a freak fishing
boat mishap that killed at least five people and
injured another 22, the Coast Guard reported.
Coast Guard spokesman Grant Bell said at
midmorning there was a "99 percent" probability
that the four missing people had already perished
in the 55-degree waters off Bodega Bay, site of
the Saturday afternoon accident.
Rich Tiesso, owner-operator of the 65-foot
Merry Jane, said the boat left Bodega Bay at 7
a.m. Saturday with 4K passengers and three crew
members
After a day of fishing, the charter boat was in
bound to this colorful little seaport 50 miles
north of San Francisco when a swell estimated as
high as 16 feet smashed into the boat s stern at
4:20 p.m. The vessel was rolled onto its side.

dumping more more than 20 people into the
water, the Coast Guard said.
Bomb squad chief killed
LOS ANGELES — The city's top explosives
expert and his partner were killed defusing a
booby-trapped pipe bomb during an investiga
tion into the shooting of a movie union leader,
Police Chief Daiyl Gates said.
Police bomb squad chief Arleigh McCree, a
world-renowned explosives expert who had as
sisted the investigation of a 1983 Marine bar
racks blast in Lebanon, and partner Ronald Ball
were killed Saturday in the North Hollywood
home of Donnell Morse. It was the first time a
bomb squad officer was killed in the line of duty
in city history. Gates said.
On Sunday, a package designed to look like a
bomb was found in a service station phone booth

five blocks from Morse's home, Sgt. Barry
Romano said. The package, which was detonated
by bomb squad officers, had not been linked to
the fatal explosion and no arrests had been made,
Romano said.
Gates said Saturday's blast, 15 miles north of
downtown, occurred several hours after Morse
was handcuffed and taken in for questioning in
connection with last Wednesday's ambush shoot
ing of Howard Smit, 74, business manager of
Make-up Artists and Hair Stylists Union Local
706. Smit was shot twice in the chest as he left the
union's North Hollywood headquarters, Sgt.
Charles McTaggart said.
