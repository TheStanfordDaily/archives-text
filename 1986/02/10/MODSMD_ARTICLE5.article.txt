# Tuition increase to be discussed
## Approval of 7 percent hike likely 
### MARY YUH Senior staff writer 
Two committees of the Board of
Trustees are expected to recommend
today that the board approve a 7 per
cent increase in undergraduate tui
tion and a 6.8 percent increase in
room and board rates for the 1986-87
school year.
The Committee on Finance and
Administration and the Committee
on Academic Affairs and Develop
ment will make its recommendation
at today's committee meetings. The
full board meets tomorrow.
If approved, tuition for both under
graduates and graduates would rise to
$11,208, up from $10,476. The basic
room rate for student residences with
full University services would rise to
$2,205, while the cost of a 19 meals
per week University Food Service
plan would increase to $2,495.
The committees will also discuss in
creases for the graduate schools. Tui
tion for Medical School would in
crease 9 percent to $13,440 and tui
tion for Law School would increase
6.8 percent to $11,508. Graduate
School of Business tuition would in
crease 9 percent to $12,102. Tuition
for graduate students in engineering
would rise 8.4 percent to $ 11,358.
The two committees are also ex

pected to recommend approval of the
proposed Graduate School of Busi
ness expansion and authorization of a
total budget of $18.1 million for the
project.
The design and site of the building
were approved by the board last year.
The final approval is needed for the
budget.
The three-story building, which
will straddle Lasuen Mall near
Memorial Way, has been criticized as
"a grave threat to the physical in
tegrity of the campus" by Art History
Prof. Paul Turner, an expert on the
history of American campus design.
Because of the criticism, the design
may be reviewed by the board, ac
cording to Bob Freelen, vice presi
dent for Business and Finance.
Whether or not the board will
change its mind and withhold consent
for the project despite its previous
approval depends on the strength of
the arguments against the proposed
building, Freelen said.
"The board is always interested in
hearing the other side of any issue,"
Freelen said.
If approved by the board, construc
tion on the project will begin in May,
with completion scheduled for
December, 1987.
