# Tuition increase to be discussed
## Approval of 7 percent hike likely 
### MARY YUH Senior staff writer 
Two committees of the Board of
Trustees are expected to recommend
today that the board approve a 7 per
cent increase in undergraduate tui
tion and a 6.8 percent increase in
room and board rates for the 1986-87
school year.
The Committee on Finance and
Administration and the Committee
on Academic Affairs and Develop
ment will make its recommendation
at today's committee meetings. The
full board meets tomorrow.
If approved, tuition for both under
graduates and graduates would rise to
$11,208, up from $10,476. The basic
room rate for student residences with
full University services would rise to
$2,205, while the cost of a 19 meals
per week University Food Service
plan would increase to $2,495.
The committees will also discuss in
creases for the graduate schools. Tui
tion for Medical School would in
crease 9 percent to $13,440 and tui
tion for Law School would increase
6.8 percent to $11,508. Graduate
School of Business tuition would in
crease 9 percent to $12,102. Tuition
for graduate students in engineering
would rise 8.4 percent to $ 11,358.
The two committees are also ex

pected to recommend approval of the
proposed Graduate School of Busi
ness expansion and authorization of a
total budget of $18.1 million for the
project.
The design and site of the building
were approved by the board last year.
The final approval is needed for the
budget.
The three-story building, which
will straddle Lasuen Mall near
Memorial Way, has been criticized as
"a grave threat to the physical in
tegrity of the campus" by Art History
Prof. Paul Turner, an expert on the
history of American campus design.
Because of the criticism, the design
may be reviewed by the board, ac
cording to Bob Freelen, vice presi
dent for Business and Finance.
Whether or not the board will
change its mind and withhold consent
for the project despite its previous
approval depends on the strength of
the arguments against the proposed
building, Freelen said.
"The board is always interested in
hearing the other side of any issue,"
Freelen said.
If approved by the board, construc
tion on the project will begin in May,
with completion scheduled for
December, 1987.
In other action, the Committee on
Investments is expected to recom
mend that the former Niven's Market
in the Stanford Shopping Center be
demolished and a multi-tenant build
ing be constructed in its place.
Demolition would begin in April.
The* $7.1 million project includes
renovation of an adjacent unleased
2,100 square feet and construction of
related mall and parking lot improve
ments.
Negotiations are proceeding with
Crate & Barrel, a national
housewares store, for approximately
8,500 square feet on the ground floor
of the proposed building.
The Board of Trustees will discuss
renovation of the Near West Campus

in efforts to produce a single plan for
the region that will do several things.
First, guide the design and con
struction of individual buildings in the
science and engineering area.
Second, provide the practical basis
for fund-raising strategy. Third, and
finally, lead to the optimum planning
and sequencing for housing academic
departments over the next several
years.
A final plan for the 41-acre site
near the Quad, which is designed to
accommodate laboratories, class
rooms for the sciences and engineer
ing departments, is expected to be
brought before the board in Septem
ber.
Acquisition of the Baron Collec
tion of Judaica and Hebraica will be
recommended by the Committee on
Academic Affairs and Development,

along with the Committee on Finance
and Administration. The purchase
will be made with funds from the
Visiting Professorship in Jewish
Civilization endowment fund, estab
lished in 1977 by the Jewish Commu
nity Federation of San Francisco, the
Peninsula and Marin and Sonoma
Counties.
The collection of nearly 20,000
volumes is the life work of Emeritus
Prof. Salo Wittmayer Baron of Co
lumbia University, and it would make
Stanford one of the major American
centers for the study of Jewish history
and culture.
Coincidentally, Amos Funkenstein.
professor of history at UCLA, has
been appointed the Daniel E. Kos
hiland Professor in Jewish Culture
and History. His appointment is ex
pected to be approved by the trus
tees.

today that the board approve a 7 per
cent increase in undergraduate tui
tion and a 6.8 percent increase in
room and board rates for the 1986-87
school year.
The Committee on Finance and
Administration and the Committee
on Academic Affairs and Develop
ment will make its recommendation
at today's committee meetings. The
full board meets tomorrow.
If approved, tuition for both under
graduates and graduates would rise to
$11,208, up from $10,476. The basic
room rate for student residences with
full University services would rise to
$2,205, while the cost of a 19 meals
per week University Food Service
plan would increase to $2,495.
The committees will also discuss in
creases for the graduate schools. Tui
tion for Medical School would in
crease 9 percent to $13,440 and tui
tion for Law School would increase
6.8 percent to $11,508. Graduate
School of Business tuition would in
crease 9 percent to $12,102. Tuition
for graduate students in engineering
would rise 8.4 percent to $ 11,358.
The two committees are also ex

pected to recommend approval of the
proposed Graduate School of Busi
ness expansion and authorization of a
total budget of $18.1 million for the
project.
The design and site of the building
were approved by the board last year.
The final approval is needed for the
budget.
The three-story building, which
will straddle Lasuen Mall near
Memorial Way, has been criticized as
"a grave threat to the physical in
tegrity of the campus" by Art History
Prof. Paul Turner, an expert on the
history of American campus design.
Because of the criticism, the design
may be reviewed by the board, ac
cording to Bob Freelen, vice presi
dent for Business and Finance.
Whether or not the board will
change its mind and withhold consent
for the project despite its previous
approval depends on the strength of
the arguments against the proposed
building, Freelen said.
"The board is always interested in
hearing the other side of any issue,"
Freelen said.
If approved by the board, construc
tion on the project will begin in May,
with completion scheduled for
December, 1987.
In other action, the Committee on
Investments is expected to recom
mend that the former Niven's Market
in the Stanford Shopping Center be
demolished and a multi-tenant build
ing be constructed in its place.
Demolition would begin in April.
The* $7.1 million project includes
renovation of an adjacent unleased
2,100 square feet and construction of
related mall and parking lot improve
ments.
Negotiations are proceeding with
Crate & Barrel, a national
housewares store, for approximately
8,500 square feet on the ground floor
of the proposed building.
The Board of Trustees will discuss
renovation of the Near West Campus

in efforts to produce a single plan for
the region that will do several things.
First, guide the design and con
struction of individual buildings in the
science and engineering area.
Second, provide the practical basis
for fund-raising strategy. Third, and
finally, lead to the optimum planning
and sequencing for housing academic
departments over the next several
years.
A final plan for the 41-acre site
near the Quad, which is designed to
accommodate laboratories, class
rooms for the sciences and engineer
ing departments, is expected to be
brought before the board in Septem
ber.
Acquisition of the Baron Collec
tion of Judaica and Hebraica will be
recommended by the Committee on
Academic Affairs and Development,

along with the Committee on Finance
and Administration. The purchase
will be made with funds from the
Visiting Professorship in Jewish
Civilization endowment fund, estab
lished in 1977 by the Jewish Commu
nity Federation of San Francisco, the
Peninsula and Marin and Sonoma
Counties.
The collection of nearly 20,000
volumes is the life work of Emeritus
Prof. Salo Wittmayer Baron of Co
lumbia University, and it would make
Stanford one of the major American
centers for the study of Jewish history
and culture.
Coincidentally, Amos Funkenstein.
professor of history at UCLA, has
been appointed the Daniel E. Kos
hiland Professor in Jewish Culture
and History. His appointment is ex
pected to be approved by the trus
tees.
