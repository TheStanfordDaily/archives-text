# Trustee says laws don't solve racism
## 
### ANDREA PEIRCE 
"Mankind's most dangerous myth
is the concept of race," Stanford
Trustee James Ware said in a speech
Saturday that concluded a community
conference on racial justice.
The conference, which featured
panel discussions by Stanford faculty
and staff on jobs, education, health
care and the legal system, was atten
ded by East Palo Alto residents, local

employers and community leaders.
The conference was held at the East
Palo Alto Municipal Center.
Ware stressed the life and death
consequences of racism. "What good
is a law against housing discrimina
tion when we have an appalling situa
tion where people live in boxes?" he
asked.
According to Ware, "the legal sit
uation is really a political one, where
politicians decide to enforce — or
•reject — the laws."
. "Laws can break down artificial
barriers," Ware said, but he empha
sized the importance of equality on
the individual level in creating equal
access in the community.
"Look to yourselves," he said.
"Equality starts with each one of us.
"The door of opportunity is there.
-All we have to do is walk through
upright," Ware said of equal access to
social services.
"In the '50s black people could not
walk through. In the '60s some got
through because the federal govern
ment carried them through. But they
couldn't do it all alone.
"And in the'7os and' Bos the door
is still there," Ware said. "But
children are told to go through the
vocational door. Or they can't find
the door because drugs have made
them lose their way. We have to deal
with the conditions to help them walk
through upright."
Unemployment and education are
inextricably linked in the effort to
change conditions, Ware said.
• "The education system reinforces
the concept that America is built by
whites," he said, because it neglects
to recognize the fundamental contri
bution of black people to U.S. his
tory.
Ware turned on a light bulb to
demonstrate what he said is one of
the many incomplete history lessons
taught in American schools — that
Edison, not Louis Howard Lattimar,
a black employee of the Edison com
pany, was the first to patent a mass

produced light bulb.
"It's nice to have Black History
Month," he said, but argued that stu
dents must learn the extent of the
black culture's contribution year
round. "Your struggle is being
undone by the system you've created.
"Prejudice grows out of ignorance.
Right it with education. Let this be a
light that shines in your hearts and re
dedicate yourselves to ending racism
and prejudice," he said.
The panel members, including
Cecilia Burciaga, associate dean of
graduate studies and Dr. Halstead
Holman, professor of medicine, ad
dressed the questions of whether
whites an(L.non-whites have equal
access to services, what barriers exist
and what local improvements can be
made.
The panel concluded that equal

access exists on the philosophical and
conceptual levels, but not in practice.
Barriers include the practice and
policy of private organizations, public
policy, the lack of legal enforcement
and individual ignorance.
Participants stressed the need for
more local citizens to become in
volved in conferences like this one in
order for community action to in
crease. As participant Gertrude
Wilkes said, "There is a crisis in our
education system. We can't wait for a
year to deal with solutions. Let's do
something about it now."
The conference was sponsored by
the Midpeninsula Citizens for Fair
Housing, the Mid-Peninsula YWCA,
the Stanford Mid-Peninsula Urban
Coalition and numerous co-sponsors.
A meeting to plan future action is
scheduled for Feb. 27 at 7:30 p.m. in
the Palo Alto YWCA.
