This year's ASSU Council of Presidents' office
is not, well, your typical office. The door is plas
tered with an Incredible Hulk poster and layers

upon layers of notes on scrap paper. Often.
Tom Waits' tunes emanate from the office's
stereo. Inside is a two-foot plastic He-Man
punching bag, a playful dog named Kesey and a

suitcase with a deadly looking hammer attached.
Also inside may he one, two or maybe
even all four members of the COP, lounging in
the large white hammock suspended from the
ceiling, the bean bags below or working at one of
four desks smothered with things to do.
Like their office, this year's COP — juniors
Mike Collins, Andy Frisch and Tim Quirk and
graduate student Leslie Leland — is atypical. The
four ran on the Hammer and Coffin Slate last
spring and promised a major change in the
ASSU, and "we've kept every single campaign

promise that we made,'* according to Quirk.
The COP's efforts to change things have been
especially evident lately; a special student elec
tion was held two weeks ago. In that election, the
COP's new version of the ASSU constitution was
defeated.
The COP insisted that it is not bitter about the
loss. Indeed, the COP members treat the defeat
with sarcastic good humor. "We're frothing at
the mouth over the defeat but we're going to try
and make friends with everyone again," Collins said.
Quirk added, "1 have not ruled out the possibility of a
military takeover."
However, the group said that it does not appreciate
the accusations of racism with which it has been
charged. "We've never had a problem with that issue
before," explained Frisch. "In fact, Mike, Tim and I
were arrested in October in a demonstration against
apartheid." He referred to the arrests in Old Union on
Oct. 16.
Frisch continued, "The dispute over the constitution
resulted from mutual asininity and a lack of communi
cation between us. The constitution was not intended to
be, nor would it have been, discriminatory,"
On the brighter side, the COP noted that it considers
this year's version of the "ASSU News" a rousing suc
cess. Originally the idea of ASSU Senator Jim
McGrath, Frisch called the news "a pet project working
towards changing the perception of the student commu
nity towards the ASSU."
The Hammer and Coffin COP also emphasized the
fact that its members are students first and student body
presidents second. "Nobody should come into this job
saying 'I'm going to be president,' " Collins explained.
"It should be something you do as a service."
Fellow COP member Quirk agreed. "The real movers
and shakers in the ASSU come into the office and spend
so much time being politicians that they stop being stu
dents," he said. "They get out of touch. It's very impor
tant to continue to be a student as well as serve the
students."
Unquestionably, this year's COP has brought some
radical changes to the ASSU. And the radical policies of
Collins, Frisch, Leland and Quirk are matched by
equally radical personalities.
They have a reputation for being extremely funny and
very opinionated. But, as Leland noted, such a reputa
tion has its disadvantages. "People have slashed us be
cause they don't know whether to take us seriously or
not, and so they don't realize the true value of how
much we have done," she said. "They are distracted by
the insanity of what we do and don't see the con
structive value."

For such diverse personalities, the members of the
COP work together well. All four are good friends, and
they claim that their unity makes them a stronger coun
cil.
"We work together as a COP; the intentions of the
individuals match with the intentions of the group,"
Leland said. "This is unique in respect to many COPs
that simply come together to form a slate. Hey, we even
got arrested together."
The COP definitely has its less serious side. When
asked to describe each other, the group's good-natured
humor was evident.
Frisch was voted "most eclectic," and Collins noted
that "it takes but 17 beers for him to feel even the
slightest bit woozy." Quirk was voted the "lovingly
scruffy faced future filmmaker." Leland was "the mem
ber of the COP that is a woman and has a dog," and
Collins was voted the "fearless leader."
Each member of the COP had similarly whimsical

plans for the future. Quirk said that he wants to be a
"starving artist," and Collins mentioned that he
wouldn't mind being a "rich artist.''
Frisch said that he would like to be a "black
feminist," but Leland had no lofty plans that she was
willing to disclose.
This year's COP claimed that they had learned a lot
from their experiences, and each member offered a par
ting piece of personal philosophy.
"I want to live as an honest man, get all I deserve and
give all I can," Frisch said.
"I came here because I thought I could learn some
thing, not get a good job. I was wrong," Quirk said.
"Besides that, money is a good thing but too many
people think that they deserve it."
"Politenesscounts," Leland added.
And Collins' advice seemed to sum up the attitude of
the whole group. "Have a good time but get out alive,"
he said.
