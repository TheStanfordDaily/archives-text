# Plaza: new cash for sports
## 
### KRISTEN BROWN Staff writer 
In an effort to raise money for
men's and women's athletic scholar
ships, the Stanford Athletic Depart
ment plans to construct "Cardinal
Club Plaza," an 80-by-80-foot ce
ment square to be adorned with in
scribed bricks purchased by donors.
The square, which will also have
tree planters and benches, will sit in
Chuck Taylor Grove behind
DeGuerre Pool at the south entrance
to Stanford Stadium. Dedication
ceremonies are slated for May 1987.
John Kates, director of develop
ment for the Athletic Department,
said yesterday that the department
hopes to sell 10,000 bricks for $100
each by the end of the year.
The Athletic Department "feels
this is a very creative as well as attrac
tive way to raise a significant amount
of money for men's and women's ath
letic scholarships," Kate said.
When asked whether the plaza will
fit into the campus' original Olmstead
plans, Kates said that while the plans
were not specific in that area, "The
plaza definitely adheres to an overall
continuing master plan."
Like other Stanford building
proposals, the Cardinal Club Plaza
plans have been reviewed and ac
cepted by the Office of Development.
They have also been approved by the
Provost's Office, which conducts the
standard approval process for any
major Stanford fund raisers.
The site for the plaza is a dirt cor
ner of Taylor Grove that includes 12
oak trees; all have been incorporated
into the design, according to Cardinal
Club member Nancy Critchfield, who
originated the Cardinal Plaza plan.
This is not the first time Taylor
Grove has been used for fund raising.
Every year fans pay $150 to reserve
pregame parking space there.
According to Eileen Gall, develop
ment secretary in the Athletic De
partment, "These people have been
reserving tailgating spots in Taylor
Grove for years." Some of them ex
pressed concern about whether they
would still have room to park.
Kates said, "The people who have
been tailgating there for years will
still be able to picnic and park there.
The use of the area will be just what it
always has been."
The Athletic Department currently
raises $3 million a year for athletic
scholarships through the Buck Club.
That money plus Stanford endow
ment and interest income bring the
total to $4 million a year.
Even so, the department is not able
to fund the costs of Stanford's 275
scholarship athletes.
Kates said there are possibilities of
using the plaza to raise future funds
by re-opening sales for bricks in up
coming yean;.
When asked if she would purchase
a brick, Stanford alumnus Jan Steele,
said, "Probably. 1 think it's a great
way to raise money. Donors so often
are asked to delve out dollars, but this
way they will get something in
return."
