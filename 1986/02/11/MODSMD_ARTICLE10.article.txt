Low ridership may mean the end of the
ASSURE bus service if the ASSU Senate
decides to discontinue it at a meeting
tonight.
"The senate hasn't decided for sure yet,"
said Leslie Leland, Council of Presidents
(COP) member and an organizer of
ASSURE. "But what's for sure is that if
more people don't use the service, we're
going to discontinue it."
ASSURE, or ASSU Route Extension,

was established to provide a continuation of
services provided by the Marguerite shuttle
service during the day. It is funded by an
ASSU special fee approved last spring.
"The bill will say that we'll discontinue
the service as of the end of winter quarter,"
said ASSU Financial Manager Duncan
Weaver. " Due to the contract, we have to
give 30 days' written notice. So the senate
has to vote on the bill in the next two
meetings. . . probably on the 11th," he said.
"As a rough figure we paid $9,400 last
quarter to St. Clair Transportation Inc., the
company that runs Marguerite. . . . That

works out to about $15.10 per rider,"
Weaver said.
'We were hoping that ASSURE would
take the load off SURE," or Stanford
United for Rape Elimination, Leland said.
"SURE is pretty expensive so this would
have been a cheaper alternative and would
have reached more people if successful."
Organizers of ASSURE are trying to de
termine the cause of the low ridership, ac
cording to Leland. "The route could be the
problem. .. . With the way the campus is set
up, it's not easy to figure out one bus route."
