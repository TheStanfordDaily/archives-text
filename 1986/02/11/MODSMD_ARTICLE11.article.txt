# Senate to vote on special fees
## 
### KELLY SUND Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate will vote tonight to
decide which Special Fees will be placed on
'.ne spring ballot, and what senate recom
mendations will appear alongside the re
quests.
Special Fees are requests made by student
groups for ASSU funding. Groups receive
placement on the ballot if 13 senators vote
accordingly and the group collects 1,200
signatures, or 10 percent of the student
body, on a petition. If the senate does not
anprove the Special Fee, the group can still

obtain a spot on the ballot by collecting
2,400 student signatures. Groups that have
had a Special Fee win by a 60 percent mar
gin in the last three years can get on the bal
lot with 10 percent fewer signatures.
Special Fee requests for 20 student groups
will be voted on tonight. These groups in
clude KZSU, LSJUMB, The Daily, SURE
and the Women's Center. The Stanford
Concert Network and SOAR will be voted
on at the senate meeting Feb. 25.
In cases where the senate feels that only
part of the fee request is deserved, it can
divide the request into two parts. Both parts

are voted on separately by students in the
spring election.
Senate Chair Carey White and Appropri
ations Committee Chair Jim DeLaHunt
both said they thought the fee requests of
KZSU, LSJUMB and The Daily would be
divided.
According to White, members of a group
whose fee request is being split will be per
mitted to speak to the senate during
tonight's meeting. Members of the other
groups present at the meeting may be called
upon by the senate to answer questions, and
any interested parties can address the senate
at 7 p.m., he said.
