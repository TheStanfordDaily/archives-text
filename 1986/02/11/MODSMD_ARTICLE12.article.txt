## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Toughen up frat policy 
### 
Within the past few weeks, three news stories in The
Daily have centered around three separate incidents of
alleged misconduct involving three different fraterni
ties. It is an old problem, and it does not seem to be
getting any better.
Those who were here in the spring of 1984 can recall
the furor that ensued when there was serious talk of
dismantling the fraternity system at Stanford. That
controversy arose when a University task force, com
missioned in November of 1983, delivered a report to
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons.
Among other things, the report recommended that
the University recognize the value provided to students
by fraternities and fraternal organizations and afford
them University support and guidance. However, the
report also urged the University to prohibit assignment
to student housing based on selection. In other words,
it called for an end to the rush process.
Of the six recommendations made by the task force,
Dean Lyons chose to accept only the first — the Uni
versity support of fraternities.
Though fraternities do make a contribution to the
Stanford community, there remain many problems
with the system. In addition to the fact that it is obvi
ously sexist and elitist, the fraternity system, as a
whole, has had a colorful history of behavior that Resi
dential Education has determined inappropriate. In
the past few weeks, the incidents have been more fre
quent than usual.
Res Ed should formulate some set of rules with
regards to fraternity behavior, and make these rules
very clear to all the fraternities. In addition, the Uni
versity owes it to the fraternities to reprimand them as
soon as they step out of line, and it owes it to the rest of
community to impose longer and stiffer

probation periods after blatant episodes of misconduct.
A system of public service for offending fraternities
would also be appropriate.
This point can be exemplified with reference to the
recent incident involving the Theta Delta Chi frater
nity. Res Ed accused the Theta Delts of acting inap
propriately, mismanaging their house funds and
destroying house property.
The Theta Delts may be accused of acting irrespon
sibly, but the University should have stepped in and
notified the house sooner than it did. By dealing with
the incidents individually, as they occurred, the prob
lem could have been greatly reduced or even
eliminated.
While the fraternity system hasn't reached the point
where it should be dismantled, Res Ed must act in a
more stringent manner regarding fraternity mis
behavior. Whatever system of punishments or
guidelines Res Ed has been using, it has been inef
fective. The incidents of misconduct have continued.
The time for warnings, meetings with fraternity
presidents and "internal punishment" is over. There
appears to be a worsening trend regarding fraternity
behavior here, and unless Res Ed begins to clearly
state and impose stiffer penalties for misconduct, it will
continue.
If the fraternity system is not kept in check by a
strong hand, and the incidents continue to get worse —
or even more frequent — then a serious and funda
mental altering of the University fraternity system
would be in order. An increasingly viable considera
tion, should the problem get that bad, would be to fol
low the lead of the Alpha Sig coed fraternity and open
the fraternities up to the Draw.
