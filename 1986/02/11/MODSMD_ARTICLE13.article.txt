Shanty symbols
tarnished campus
The recent destruction of the
former shantytown of White Plaza
has sparked outrage. Calls of racism
and vandalism have been heard. But
the underlying question raised by this
incident is whether such blatant
blemishes upon our beautiful and his
toric,campus should be allowed at all.
How long was the mass of
cardboard planned to remain in
White Plaza? Perhaps until it dried up
and blew away in the wind?
The efforts of the Black Student
Union (BSU), Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOS A) and other student or
ganizations to educate and inform the
at-times apathetic student body of the
horrors of apartheid are admirable.
The shantytown was an excellent ve
hicle for making a valid statement for
a day, or even a week. But one month
later it was simply an eyesore. Could
we not stage daily beatings in White
Plaza to dramatize apartheid? Or why
not let the rubber bullets fly?
Obviously these examples are
ridiculous, but they point out the
shantytown's fallacy.
As usual, when any part of the

apartheid protest system is ques
tioned, the blind rebuke of racism will
be the battle cry for those blinded by
their own special form of bigotry.
Along these lines we anticipate such
accusation will be levied against us,
but we strongly feel the responsibility
to voice our prudent opinions.
So let us continue to make ad
vances toward dismantling the terri
fying specter of apartheid. But we
need not lose sight of reason in our
fight.

Last Monday's front page article on
the Coffee House expressed the idea
that the Coffee House seems to be
doing well. Although the article
wasn't backed by any factual
evidence in regards to current sales at
the Coffee House (which were down
30 percent last quarter), nonetheless,
it is obvious that the Coffee House is
a popular place to get something to
eat. However, the article ex

traneously stated that the student-run
Espresso Bar is directly in competi
tion with the Coffee House.
The Espresso Bar (at the Bechtel
International Center Wednesday
through Friday, 8-11:30 p.m.) has the
atmosphere of an international cafe.
We offer various types of coffees and
freshl>-baked desserts. It was estab
lished to provide the students with an
informal place in which to relax, so
cialize, study or unwind. It is designed
for the needs of the students. The
Espresso Bar has been consistently;
successful in providing multicultural,
live entertainment. Talented mem
bers of the Stanford community have
volunteered their musical specialties
in an effort to perpetuate this opera
tion for the benefit of other students.
The Espresso Bar does not sell
sandwiches, soups, salads or alcoholic
beverages. It does not, therefore,
compete with the Coffee House for
the same market. Our intention is to
keep it as such. The Espresso Bar is
run for students, by students and not
as an attempt to close the Tressidder
Coffee House.
