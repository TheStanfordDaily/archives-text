## Charges of racism have been misinterpreted 
### 
Because this past week's events have been con
fusing and unclearly presented, we, members from
the different Third World organizations on campus,
feel a pressing need to respond. First, we'd like to
clarify the series of events that led to this mess. On
Jan. 27, Eric Diesel's letter to the editor, "New
constitution is unjust, racist," iterated Diesel's per
sonal opinions, not those of any Third World com
munity, on the limited representation and creation

ANDERSON, ET AL.

of the new consitution. That same night, Third
World students, representing only themselves, dis
cussed the pros and the cons of the proprosed con
stituion. All present agreed that there were prob
lems. The Black Student Union (BSU) had already
issued fliers calling it undemocratic.
Unfortunately, the discussion was misinterpreted
and misquoted by Daily reporter Sydney Smith in
her article "Minorities rip constitution." This mis
representation gave rise to Leslie Leland's
response. "COP resents attacks," on Jan. 29. To
our dismay, Leland's comments led her to assume
that these sentiments toward the Council of Presi
dents (COP) were those of entire Third World
communities.
The Daily editorial also mentioned the COP.
Unfortunately, it failed to mention the "joke"
printed in Once Around the Quad (OATQ) Jan.
30: "White Supremists: Meeting in COP office at
4. Bring hoods." Jokes like the above remind us
that we live in a racist society. White supremacy
and hoods remind us of America's shameful past
and bring images of cross burnings, lynchings, bom
bings of churches and the killing of small children
to the minds of people of color. It is not history so
distant or unlikely in the present that we can laugh
about it. Should people laugh or make jokes about
the Holocaust? This is not an issue where only
Third World students are horrified, but also where
white students are equally outraged.
Furthermore, a white man actually went to the
ASSU office, seriously asking about this meeting

for white supremists, showing how our anger about
this lack of sensitivity is justified by reality.
The Daily has played a very irresponsible role in
this situation. As the most accessible source of in
formation and news on campus, we feel that, as re
sponsible journalists, Daily reporters should at
least be clear on the facts in a situation before
writing an editorial.
Since the Third World communities never made
the charge that the proposed constituion is racist, to
expect the Third World communities to substan
tiate and defend this charge is arrogant and
presumptuous. The Daily also sensationalized the
charge of racism, which they themselves created, to
the point of accusing the entire Stanford community
of being racist. To pit the COP and Third World
communities was bad enough, but then to assume
that the COP and the Stanford community are one
and the same, is a gross exaggeration. This only
succeeded in further complicating the issues.

What we are saying is that the actions of The Daily
and the COP were objectively racist.

In addition, perhaps the most blatant act of ir
responsibility was the editorial staff s admittance of
the COP's "White Supremist" meeting notice in
OATQ. We feel that this should never have been
included in OATQ. We take very seriously the in
tention of this ad. We do not find it funny to read
such insensitive and callous things in The Daily.
When such things appear, no matter what the in
tention, it only confuses the difference between
humor and racism. As a result, racist acts can and
have often been excused as "only being funny."
This is a very dangerous misperception to promote.
We are sorely disappointed in The Daily's poor
judgment in this situation.
Finally, regarding The Daily's query "Are Stan

ford students racist?", we say first of all that we
never posed that question. We never accused Stan
ford students in general of being racist. We never
even accused The Daily or the COP of being racist.
What we are saying is that the actions of The Daily
and COP were objectively racist.
The Daily must recognize, however, that racism
does exist in the United States and at Stanford.
Surely, The Daily does not think that Stanford stu
dents are immune to racism. It does not mean that
they are terrible people or racist by nature, just that
they live in a racist society which sometimes in
fluences their behavior. People should not get de
fensive when instances of "racism" are pointed out,
but instead try to learn from a racist incident.
As the editorial correctly mentioned, Stanford
students have certainly done more than most
people in terms of helping people in need. We com
mend "Reach Out Today" and "You Can Make a
Difference" conferences. They are necessary and

helpful. But they are not enough. Charity toward
the powerless is not sufficient. To be a real friend,
you must help them in their struggle to gain power.
The people of East Palo Alto need more than their
houses painted. They need to change the conditions
of the society so that they can have control over
their own destinies.

Jan. 27, Eric Diesel's letter to the editor, "New
constitution is unjust, racist," iterated Diesel's per
sonal opinions, not those of any Third World com
munity, on the limited representation and creation

ANDERSON, ET AL.

of the new consitution. That same night, Third
World students, representing only themselves, dis
cussed the pros and the cons of the proprosed con
stituion. All present agreed that there were prob
lems. The Black Student Union (BSU) had already
issued fliers calling it undemocratic.
Unfortunately, the discussion was misinterpreted
and misquoted by Daily reporter Sydney Smith in
her article "Minorities rip constitution." This mis
representation gave rise to Leslie Leland's
response. "COP resents attacks," on Jan. 29. To
our dismay, Leland's comments led her to assume
that these sentiments toward the Council of Presi
dents (COP) were those of entire Third World
communities.
The Daily editorial also mentioned the COP.
Unfortunately, it failed to mention the "joke"
printed in Once Around the Quad (OATQ) Jan.
30: "White Supremists: Meeting in COP office at
4. Bring hoods." Jokes like the above remind us
that we live in a racist society. White supremacy
and hoods remind us of America's shameful past
and bring images of cross burnings, lynchings, bom
bings of churches and the killing of small children
to the minds of people of color. It is not history so
distant or unlikely in the present that we can laugh
about it. Should people laugh or make jokes about
the Holocaust? This is not an issue where only
Third World students are horrified, but also where
white students are equally outraged.
Furthermore, a white man actually went to the
ASSU office, seriously asking about this meeting

for white supremists, showing how our anger about
this lack of sensitivity is justified by reality.
The Daily has played a very irresponsible role in
this situation. As the most accessible source of in
formation and news on campus, we feel that, as re
sponsible journalists, Daily reporters should at
least be clear on the facts in a situation before
writing an editorial.
Since the Third World communities never made
the charge that the proposed constituion is racist, to
expect the Third World communities to substan
tiate and defend this charge is arrogant and
presumptuous. The Daily also sensationalized the
charge of racism, which they themselves created, to
the point of accusing the entire Stanford community
of being racist. To pit the COP and Third World
communities was bad enough, but then to assume
that the COP and the Stanford community are one
and the same, is a gross exaggeration. This only
succeeded in further complicating the issues.

What we are saying is that the actions of The Daily
and the COP were objectively racist.

In addition, perhaps the most blatant act of ir
responsibility was the editorial staff s admittance of
the COP's "White Supremist" meeting notice in
OATQ. We feel that this should never have been
included in OATQ. We take very seriously the in
tention of this ad. We do not find it funny to read
such insensitive and callous things in The Daily.
When such things appear, no matter what the in
tention, it only confuses the difference between
humor and racism. As a result, racist acts can and
have often been excused as "only being funny."
This is a very dangerous misperception to promote.
We are sorely disappointed in The Daily's poor
judgment in this situation.
Finally, regarding The Daily's query "Are Stan

ford students racist?", we say first of all that we
never posed that question. We never accused Stan
ford students in general of being racist. We never
even accused The Daily or the COP of being racist.
What we are saying is that the actions of The Daily
and COP were objectively racist.
The Daily must recognize, however, that racism
does exist in the United States and at Stanford.
Surely, The Daily does not think that Stanford stu
dents are immune to racism. It does not mean that
they are terrible people or racist by nature, just that
they live in a racist society which sometimes in
fluences their behavior. People should not get de
fensive when instances of "racism" are pointed out,
but instead try to learn from a racist incident.
As the editorial correctly mentioned, Stanford
students have certainly done more than most
people in terms of helping people in need. We com
mend "Reach Out Today" and "You Can Make a
Difference" conferences. They are necessary and

helpful. But they are not enough. Charity toward
the powerless is not sufficient. To be a real friend,
you must help them in their struggle to gain power.
The people of East Palo Alto need more than their
houses painted. They need to change the conditions
of the society so that they can have control over
their own destinies.
