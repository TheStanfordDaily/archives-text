# Rethinking faith over coffee
## 
### 
As the man enters, the wind blows harshly through the
cafe. His black clothes accentuate his thinness. His bony
wrist holds a cigarette, half-burnt. He spots the two deep
in conversation, saunters quietly over to their corner and
deposits his bag beneath the table as he sits.
"Good evening. I am Jof," he says.
Jacob looks at Mary, they look at him.
"Good evening," Jacob says. "We were just talking."
"Of what?" Jof asks.
"Of, well, the spirit, I guess. Religion, meaning, devo
tion. Pretty sophomoric stuff. Not really important at all."
"Oh, I think it is. It really is quite important," Jof says.
Maude, the waitress, brings Jof a coffee cup, offers him
cream and sugar, which he refuses.
"I was just saying," Mary breaks in, "that people
should realize at the base of it all is one God, the Christian
God, and one Lord Jesus. We came from Him, we're
going back to Him, and it is His spirit which pulses

through us in our moments of greatest truth. We need a
return to prayer in this country, we need to honor He who
created us with all our heart and soul. In a rush of technol
ogy and intellectuality we've lost the very thread which
makes us human. We need a reordering of priorities."
"So you want to bring God back to the American cul
ture. How do you proprose to do that? And haven't you
ever heard of religious freedom?"
"I'm not talking about instituting the Christian God.
I'm talking about giving importance to God, in general,
however each person wants to perceive Him. This is a na
tion under God, right? All I'm saying is that we should
once again validate the spirit, not live wholly in the mind.
We need to recognize the Church, accept religion, bring
together the state and Church. Otherwise the moral slide
that we're all on will deposit us at the door of Hell."
"Well, you sure won't find no spirit in the Church,"
Maude comments as she refills their cups. "Spirit is inside
yourself. It sure doesn't happen just on Sundays. Spirit is
about the wonderful feeling you get when you just know
there's something holding you up, and connecting you

with everything and everyone. Can I sit down?"
"Look," Jof says. "It's all about death. You all haven't
realized this yet? It's how you confront death, it seems to
me, that's important. One's realization of the inevitability
of death, the real understanding that it's all going to end,
seems the point. This knowledge of death, the end, eter
nity, lends life its meaning and value and determines our
search. "
They took a moment of silence to honor such profun
dity.
"Hey, Maude, what do you mean you won't find it in a
church?" Mary asks. "Spirit is to be found everywhere,
just as God is," Maude says. "Why go to a church? If your
actions are in the name of God, then all your action is con
secrated action. And if you are a true believer, then all
your thoughts are God-like. Why do we need someone to
tell us what God is when we can feel it inside ourself?"
"Maude, what's in your coffee?"
"Look," Maude says. "It's a different reality. We are all
stuck here in the universe of self-doubt, illusion, external
ities. But there's another world, stripped of all these bar
riers, where illusion is illusion and truth truth, and we can
live presently and not in the future or the past.
The four people all look down at the table for a mo
ment. Maude is the first to raise her head.
"Look, guys, it's really quite simple," Maude says. "We
need to re-invent the world. All of us need to work in our
own individual way to create a new world ruled by one
ideal — a spirit of love, understanding and ultimately,
truth. Why are people so moved by Bishop Desmond
Tutu, do you think? Because he's fighting for this ideal, a
world where everyone is equal because their souls are
equal, where all mankind, regardless of race, class or in
tellect, is joined by the spirit."
"So what do we do?" Jacob asks. "We've been taught
to move people by intellect, logic. That's the vein in which
we communicate with each other. Spirit is for the
churches."
"Why, bring the two together. It's easy. The world is,
after all, not black or white, but grey, isn't it? You know,
there's good and bad, right and wrong, intellect and spirit,
but the true nature of things is somewhere in the middle.
You have to realize both sides as valid before you can see
the truth. I think that's what you can do."
Maude puts her hand on Jacob's shoulder, lifts herself
up, and picks up her coffee.
"It's been nice talking with you. I'll see you next week."
Jof gets up, grinds out the cigarette, and is gone.

"So you want to bring God back to the American cul
ture. How do you proprose to do that? And haven't you
ever heard of religious freedom?"
"I'm not talking about instituting the Christian God.
I'm talking about giving importance to God, in general,
however each person wants to perceive Him. This is a na
tion under God, right? All I'm saying is that we should
once again validate the spirit, not live wholly in the mind.
We need to recognize the Church, accept religion, bring
together the state and Church. Otherwise the moral slide
that we're all on will deposit us at the door of Hell."
"Well, you sure won't find no spirit in the Church,"
Maude comments as she refills their cups. "Spirit is inside
yourself. It sure doesn't happen just on Sundays. Spirit is
about the wonderful feeling you get when you just know
there's something holding you up, and connecting you

with everything and everyone. Can I sit down?"
"Look," Jof says. "It's all about death. You all haven't
realized this yet? It's how you confront death, it seems to
me, that's important. One's realization of the inevitability
of death, the real understanding that it's all going to end,
seems the point. This knowledge of death, the end, eter
nity, lends life its meaning and value and determines our
search. "
They took a moment of silence to honor such profun
dity.
"Hey, Maude, what do you mean you won't find it in a
church?" Mary asks. "Spirit is to be found everywhere,
just as God is," Maude says. "Why go to a church? If your
actions are in the name of God, then all your action is con
secrated action. And if you are a true believer, then all
your thoughts are God-like. Why do we need someone to
tell us what God is when we can feel it inside ourself?"
"Maude, what's in your coffee?"
"Look," Maude says. "It's a different reality. We are all
stuck here in the universe of self-doubt, illusion, external
ities. But there's another world, stripped of all these bar
riers, where illusion is illusion and truth truth, and we can
live presently and not in the future or the past.
The four people all look down at the table for a mo
ment. Maude is the first to raise her head.
"Look, guys, it's really quite simple," Maude says. "We
need to re-invent the world. All of us need to work in our
own individual way to create a new world ruled by one
ideal — a spirit of love, understanding and ultimately,
truth. Why are people so moved by Bishop Desmond
Tutu, do you think? Because he's fighting for this ideal, a
world where everyone is equal because their souls are
equal, where all mankind, regardless of race, class or in
tellect, is joined by the spirit."
"So what do we do?" Jacob asks. "We've been taught
to move people by intellect, logic. That's the vein in which
we communicate with each other. Spirit is for the
churches."
"Why, bring the two together. It's easy. The world is,
after all, not black or white, but grey, isn't it? You know,
there's good and bad, right and wrong, intellect and spirit,
but the true nature of things is somewhere in the middle.
You have to realize both sides as valid before you can see
the truth. I think that's what you can do."
Maude puts her hand on Jacob's shoulder, lifts herself
up, and picks up her coffee.
"It's been nice talking with you. I'll see you next week."
Jof gets up, grinds out the cigarette, and is gone.

As the man enters, the wind blows harshly through the
cafe. His black clothes accentuate his thinness. His bony
wrist holds a cigarette, half-burnt. He spots the two deep
in conversation, saunters quietly over to their corner and
deposits his bag beneath the table as he sits.
"Good evening. I am Jof," he says.
Jacob looks at Mary, they look at him.
"Good evening," Jacob says. "We were just talking."
"Of what?" Jof asks.
"Of, well, the spirit, I guess. Religion, meaning, devo
tion. Pretty sophomoric stuff. Not really important at all."
"Oh, I think it is. It really is quite important," Jof says.
Maude, the waitress, brings Jof a coffee cup, offers him
cream and sugar, which he refuses.
"I was just saying," Mary breaks in, "that people
should realize at the base of it all is one God, the Christian
God, and one Lord Jesus. We came from Him, we're
going back to Him, and it is His spirit which pulses

through us in our moments of greatest truth. We need a
return to prayer in this country, we need to honor He who
created us with all our heart and soul. In a rush of technol
ogy and intellectuality we've lost the very thread which
makes us human. We need a reordering of priorities."
