## The 						Bug's counting up palms for the lore 
### CHRIS MYERS Staff writer 
The hinges on the swinging doors wailed
plaintively as the dark, angular figure strode
in. His spurs jangled and the star on his chest
shone in the dim light. As his long shadow fell
across the room, those inside looked up and
saw the curious gleam in his eye and the stupid
questions in his hand. He was. . . Mr. Bug Me.
Dear Bug Me,
It's time you did some field work. How many
palms line so-named Palm Drive? How old are
they and who put them there? What species are
they?
- "Gregor Samsa''
By the casual tone of your question, Gregor,
you make it sound like you yourself go count
ing things like palm trees (or bollards) all the
time. Well, let me tell you something: some
people have better things to do with their
time.
But not me. There are 133 palm trees on
Palm Drive, counting a few scrawny ones that
look like they were recently transplanted. Of
those, 73 are on the east side of the street,
with only 60 on the west side. Please don't ask
why they're so unevenly distributed.
To find out the origin and species of the
palms, I went to the University Archives,
where librarian Linda Long was an immense
help.
Turns out that the palms are of the species
Phoenix canadensis, better known to you and
me as the Canary Island date palm. According
to Ron Bracewell, in his book "Trees on the
Stanford Campus," the palms are from —
surprise! — the Canary Islands, and are char
acterized by their feather-like leaf structure
and inedible dates that grow in orange
bunches.
The exact age of the palms is a little hazier,
but the daily journals of T.H. Douglas, the
first supervisor of Stanford's nursery, offer
some clues. It seems from Douglas' journals
that most of the trees in the arboretum were
planted between 1889 and 1891. Although he
doesn't specifically mention the palms on
Palm Drive, he does make mention of
"planting date palms in the 'circles' in the
quadrangle."
And at the conclusion of his journals, in late
1891, he makes several references to digging
holes along "Big Tree" Avenue. That may
have been a reference to present-day Palm
Drive, since the original intention of designer
Frederick Law Olmsted and Leland Stanford,

Sr. was to line the avenue with large shade
trees, not palms specifically.
We'll never know, though, since Douglas
aparently stopped keeping a journal after
1891. Oh well, his handwriting was horren
dous, anyway.
But it can probably be safely assumed that
the palms were planted by Douglas roughly 95
years ago.
And there was an exciting sidelight men
tioned in Douglas's journal: on April 29,
1891, President and Mrs. Benjamin Harrison
came to the campus to visit then-Gov.
Stanford, and while they were here, each
planted a sequoia tree in the arboretum.
Dear Bug Me,
A huge camphor tree in the Inner Quad
recently died and was cut down. What did it die
of?
- S.O. Chamness
I have a feeling that T.H. Douglas super
vised the planting of that camphor tree, and
he'd probably be saddened to hear of its
demise.
It seems that the tree fell victim to progress,
if that's what you call the remodeling of the
Inner Quad. According to Herbert Fong, the
University's manager of grounds, the cam
phor tree had to sacrifice several major roots
to accommodate the low-lying walls installed

around the Inner Quad's "islands" during last
year's remodeling effort.
In the aftermath, the tree's bottom was
simply unable to deliver the necessary water to
its top. And so the tree perished from what
Fong referred to as "water-related stress."
Fong also mentioned, however, that another
camphor tree experienced a similar root
severing trauma, but survived admirably and is
still alive and well and living in the Inner
Quad.
Dear Bug Me,
In the walkways around the Quad, I keep
noticing stones with the inscription, "George
Goodman's stone." Who was George Good
man?
- Richard Beigel
This is a very sordid story. After extended
archive research, 1 found that George Good
man was a Republican senator from Nevada in
the 1860s who worked closely with Sen.
Stanford to get the transcontinental railroad
legislation pushed through Congress.
The two men became close friends during
their time together on Capitol Hill. Later,
Goodman's daughter, Patricia became
romantically involved with Leland Junior. She
became pregnant, and in order to keep Good

man quiet, the senior Stanford had to pay him
blackmail money, and later had to promise to
put Goodman's name all over the Inner Quad
of his new University.
And all of that was a bald-faced lie. The
boring truth is that all I could find about
George Goodman was a single card in the Ar
chives' card catalog. The card reads thusly:
"George Goodman manufactured the con
crete for the blocks in the Quad." And there
you have it.
Dear Bug Me,
For quite some time now I have been notic
ing a misspelled street sign at the intersection of
Lomita Drive and Santa Teresa Street. It reads
"Santa Terresa," with two r's. Why does the
University permit this heinous error? Is any
thing being done about it?
- Mack
According to Ralph Buchanan, director of
University Operations, Maintenance and
Utilities, my call was the first he had heard
about the misspelled sign. He said he has
placed a work order to have the sign changed,
and it should be replaced in a few days. Yet
another example of the social influence of Bug
Me.
Keep those questions coming, everybody!
Next week: more questions about buildings
and food.

the palms were planted by Douglas roughly 95
years ago.
And there was an exciting sidelight men

1891, President and Mrs. Benjamin Harrison
came to the campus to visit then-Gov.
Stanford, and while they were here, each
planted a sequoia tree in the arboretum.
Dear Bug Me,
A huge camphor tree in the Inner Quad
recently died and was cut down. What did it die
of?
- S.O. Chamness
I have a feeling that T.H. Douglas super
vised the planting of that camphor tree, and
he'd probably be saddened to hear of its
demise.
It seems that the tree fell victim to progress,
if that's what you call the remodeling of the
Inner Quad. According to Herbert Fong, the
University's manager of grounds, the cam
phor tree had to sacrifice several major roots
to accommodate the low-lying walls installed

around the Inner Quad's "islands" during last
year's remodeling effort.
In the aftermath, the tree's bottom was
simply unable to deliver the necessary water to
its top. And so the tree perished from what
Fong referred to as "water-related stress."
Fong also mentioned, however, that another
camphor tree experienced a similar root
severing trauma, but survived admirably and is
still alive and well and living in the Inner
Quad.
Dear Bug Me,
In the walkways around the Quad, I keep
noticing stones with the inscription, "George
Goodman's stone." Who was George Good
man?
- Richard Beigel
This is a very sordid story. After extended
archive research, 1 found that George Good
man was a Republican senator from Nevada in
the 1860s who worked closely with Sen.
Stanford to get the transcontinental railroad
legislation pushed through Congress.
The two men became close friends during
their time together on Capitol Hill. Later,
Goodman's daughter, Patricia became
romantically involved with Leland Junior. She
became pregnant, and in order to keep Good

man quiet, the senior Stanford had to pay him
blackmail money, and later had to promise to
put Goodman's name all over the Inner Quad
of his new University.
And all of that was a bald-faced lie. The
boring truth is that all I could find about
George Goodman was a single card in the Ar
chives' card catalog. The card reads thusly:
"George Goodman manufactured the con
crete for the blocks in the Quad." And there
you have it.
Dear Bug Me,
For quite some time now I have been notic
ing a misspelled street sign at the intersection of
Lomita Drive and Santa Teresa Street. It reads
"Santa Terresa," with two r's. Why does the
University permit this heinous error? Is any
thing being done about it?
- Mack
According to Ralph Buchanan, director of
University Operations, Maintenance and
Utilities, my call was the first he had heard
about the misspelled sign. He said he has
placed a work order to have the sign changed,
and it should be replaced in a few days. Yet
another example of the social influence of Bug
Me.
Keep those questions coming, everybody!
Next week: more questions about buildings
and food.

The hinges on the swinging doors wailed
plaintively as the dark, angular figure strode
in. His spurs jangled and the star on his chest
shone in the dim light. As his long shadow fell
across the room, those inside looked up and
saw the curious gleam in his eye and the stupid
questions in his hand. He was. . . Mr. Bug Me.
Dear Bug Me,
It's time you did some field work. How many
palms line so-named Palm Drive? How old are
they and who put them there? What species are
they?
- "Gregor Samsa''
By the casual tone of your question, Gregor,
you make it sound like you yourself go count
ing things like palm trees (or bollards) all the
time. Well, let me tell you something: some
people have better things to do with their
time.
But not me. There are 133 palm trees on
Palm Drive, counting a few scrawny ones that
look like they were recently transplanted. Of
those, 73 are on the east side of the street,
with only 60 on the west side. Please don't ask
why they're so unevenly distributed.
To find out the origin and species of the
palms, I went to the University Archives,
where librarian Linda Long was an immense
help.
Turns out that the palms are of the species
Phoenix canadensis, better known to you and
me as the Canary Island date palm. According
to Ron Bracewell, in his book "Trees on the
Stanford Campus," the palms are from —
surprise! — the Canary Islands, and are char
acterized by their feather-like leaf structure
and inedible dates that grow in orange
bunches.
The exact age of the palms is a little hazier,
but the daily journals of T.H. Douglas, the
first supervisor of Stanford's nursery, offer
some clues. It seems from Douglas' journals
that most of the trees in the arboretum were
planted between 1889 and 1891. Although he
doesn't specifically mention the palms on
Palm Drive, he does make mention of
"planting date palms in the 'circles' in the
quadrangle."
And at the conclusion of his journals, in late
1891, he makes several references to digging
holes along "Big Tree" Avenue. That may
have been a reference to present-day Palm
Drive, since the original intention of designer
Frederick Law Olmsted and Leland Stanford,

Sr. was to line the avenue with large shade
trees, not palms specifically.
We'll never know, though, since Douglas
aparently stopped keeping a journal after
1891. Oh well, his handwriting was horren
dous, anyway.
But it can probably be safely assumed that
the palms were planted by Douglas roughly 95
years ago.
And there was an exciting sidelight men
tioned in Douglas's journal: on April 29,
1891, President and Mrs. Benjamin Harrison
