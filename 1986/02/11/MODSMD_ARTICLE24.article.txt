## Latest from Woody's film factory journeys back to New York City real life Allen shares more confident self in 'Hanna' 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
Movie critics have been hailing
"Hanna and her Sisters" as if it were
the second coming. David Ansen in
Newsweek magazine coos over the
characters' "telling" brooches and
"eloquent" raincoats; Vincent Canby
in The New York Times claims
Woody Allen's talent keeps growing
"in the manner of Jack's prodigious
beanstalk." Huh? Once you wipe the
drool from the screen, you'll find a
very entertaining comedy sinking un
der the weight of this silly praise.
I didn't care for "Hanna and Her
Sisters" as much as I did for Allen's
last film, "Purple Rose of Cairo,"
perhaps because "Hanna" doesn't
quite live up to its aspirations of nar
rative scope, while "Purple Rose"
worked brilliantly within its limits.
But critics are so hungry for a movie
they can unequivocally call great,
they're ready to pounce on anything
that appears to have been made with
some adult intelligence and craft.
An Allen picture, made with
complete control and outside the
Hollywood establishment, is by defi
nition a masterpiece.
Allen has stopped begging for this
kind of praise since his sterile
"Interiors" and the self-flagellating
"Manhattan" and "Stardust
Memories." He pulled back after the
excesses of those movies into a string
of small, precious comedies which
peaked with "Purple Rose."
"Hanna" represents a return to the
contemporary world — with all of its
contemporary concerns — for him,
and it's clear that he didn't set out to
make a masterpiece about Allen with
this picture. It took "Zelig,"
"Broadway Danny Rose" and
"Purple Rose" to grow beyond him
self; to diffuse his presence with an
accomplished cinematic technique,
and to focus on characters outside
himself.
Now he's back as the real-world
Woody Allen, but he doesn't put
himself at the center of "Hanna."
Though the the movie is about typical
Allen concerns, we no longer see him
as the tortured artist, wanting to be
serious, forced to be comic. We get
his serious sensibility, but muted and
filtered through a host of different

characters, and made less self
consciously funny.
The story follows the extended
family of Hanna (Mia Farrow) over
the course of a year, from one
Thanksgiving celebration to the next.
The thoughts of her adulterous hus
band, Elliot (Michael Caine), pene
trate the silence before the screen
even lights up; he's after one of
Hanna's sisters, Lee (Barbara Her
shey), who's living with a tem
peramental, domineering artist, Fred
erick (Max von Sydow).
Hanna's other sister, Holly (Diane
Wiest), a cocaine addict, has just
begun a catering service with her
friend April (Carrie Fisher), and in
cidentally competes with Lee for the
attentions of an architect (Sam
Waterston).
Allen himself plays Mickey, a TV
producer, and Allen's most ag
gressively paranoid hypochondriac
yet. Mickey is death-obsessed, Holly
is stability-obsessed and everyone in
this movie is self-obsessed — all ex
cept for the wonderfully secure
Hanna.
The contemporary feel of this
movie is not just grounded in the New
York City locations, beautifully
photographed by Carlos Di Palma;
it's also in the mentality of the char
acters, who are the neurotic artists'
souls we've seen before in Allen.
Their self-absorption, their demand
ing to be taken seriously, their lack of
forgiveness and concern for others
are entertaining and recognizable.
The "we generation" has grown up
and found, if not happiness, the fin
ancial security in which to feel af
fluently unfulfilled.
This is what "Hanna," when it's at
its funny and engaging best, is about.
In the interim between this movie and
his last modern comedy,
"Manhattan," Allen has watched the
cultured egocentrics he describes
(and portrays) so well. They're no
longer worried and jabbering about
their hangups; they've internalized
them, and become so self-centered
they've developed a kind of confi
dence.
In "Hanna," characters like
Caine's Elliot are incapable of being
emotionally damaged (they're psyc
hologically barricaded).

tion extends only so far as his needs;
concerning them he's verbose — a
shallow charmer — and he goes

through elaborate rationalizations to
justify his boobishness. One moment
he and Hanna are "moving apart

from one another," the next it's "I've
betrayed her." Elliot sees his i.n
decisiveness about whom he's hurting
most as a sign of his supreme sensitiv
ity, when all he's really analyzing is
how badly his various options hurt
him.
He and Lee are a perfect match;
she wants out of her relationship with
Frederick because "I'm suffocating. I
want a life, children." These aren't
just convenient cliches for Elliot and
Lee, these are their actual emotions
and notions of fulfillment. There's a
sublimated shock when we recognize
them from earlier Allen movies, but
with an ironic distance and light
parodic twist that doesn't jibe with his
neurotic/defensive sensibility in the
late '70s.
"Hanna" has facets of Allen in
every character; those of his past
films which were more openly per
sonal provide the clues for piecing to
gether the fragments. What is so
surprising and engaging is that here
we see some of Allen even in the silly
characters. Elliot's views on the
women in his life are too close to the
Allen characters in "Annie Hall" and
"Manhattan" not to be funny and
damning at once. Wiest's aimless,
perpetually dissatisfied Holly blos
soms into a charming playwright, and
we can see in her the self-pitying Al
len of "Stardust" made human and
lovable.
He comes closest to making a
mistake in couching his good, noble,
long-suffering side in Mia Farrow;
he's doing for her what he did for
himself in earlier films, and 1 don't
think it works any better here. Hanna
is a maternal saint. Everyone dumps
their emotional problems on her, and
when she cries out "I have needs
too!", we have to applaud this
meager hint of selfishness. It's not a
plum role, and Farrow would do
better by Allen if he would stop
trying to ennoble her. (He couldn't
even give her a happy ending in
"Purple Rose" — that was his rotten
serious side coming through again.)
Allen has stopped trying to en
noble himself. His Mickey practically
represents a step back to an earlier,
simpler stage of despair, where his
fear of death was a combination of
funny and sincere, and it induced a
pang.

At first Mickey's hangups here
seem outside the concerns'of the
other characters, and we're not sure
how he's connected with them. But
his death anxiety and subsequent turn
to various religions is a funny, ex
treme variation on Holly's character,
and ties in with the general themes of
self-absorption and the quintessen
tially Woody Allen search for
meaning.
Those themes help tie together the
prodigiously large cast and intercon
necting storylines, which are a bit un
wieldy for the picture's standard
movie length. The ending comes on a
bit fast, and some of the subplots
seem truncated.
But Allen's directorial skills have
never been more commanding; he
pulls off scenes here that no one
would have guessed at watching his
early '70s comedies. Particularly
well-done are a lunch get-together
with Hanna and her sisters, and a
bookstore meeting between Elliot
and Lee.
Allen's name has come to mean a
special kind of magic for actors, and
he's attracted some great ones here,
with Wiest and Caine being the
standouts. They don't overshadow
the rest of the cast (no one grabs for
big effects in "Hanna"), yet their
characters seem the most fully drawn,
and the funniest.
The biggest problem I have with
this movie is that, for all the confi
dence Allen displays in his move back
into contemporary comedy, self
justifying platitudes lie just beneath
the surface. The big serious moment
comes for Mickey when he sits in a
movie house watching "Duck Soup,"
and decides to go on living because
"Any universe that can give us the
Marx Brothers can't be all bad."
Does anyone really need this life-is
wonderful-if-only-you-laugh pap?
"Hanna and Her Sisters" proves
you don't have to be deadly serious to
make a good film, yet Allen feels he
has to remind himself and us that
comedy is part of what makes life
bearable. The joy of this movie is that
virtually every frame shows him as
more relaxed, more confident in
being funny and serious; we don't
need the explicit comedy-is-good
message to enjoy ourselves, and nei
ther does Allen?

Movie critics have been hailing
"Hanna and her Sisters" as if it were
the second coming. David Ansen in
Newsweek magazine coos over the

"eloquent" raincoats; Vincent Canby

tion extends only so far as his needs;
concerning them he's verbose — a
shallow charmer — and he goes

through elaborate rationalizations to
justify his boobishness. One moment
he and Hanna are "moving apart

from one another," the next it's "I've
betrayed her." Elliot sees his i.n
decisiveness about whom he's hurting
most as a sign of his supreme sensitiv
ity, when all he's really analyzing is
how badly his various options hurt
him.
He and Lee are a perfect match;
she wants out of her relationship with
Frederick because "I'm suffocating. I
want a life, children." These aren't
just convenient cliches for Elliot and
Lee, these are their actual emotions
and notions of fulfillment. There's a
sublimated shock when we recognize
them from earlier Allen movies, but
with an ironic distance and light
parodic twist that doesn't jibe with his
neurotic/defensive sensibility in the
late '70s.
"Hanna" has facets of Allen in
every character; those of his past
films which were more openly per
sonal provide the clues for piecing to
gether the fragments. What is so
surprising and engaging is that here
we see some of Allen even in the silly
characters. Elliot's views on the
women in his life are too close to the
Allen characters in "Annie Hall" and
"Manhattan" not to be funny and
damning at once. Wiest's aimless,
perpetually dissatisfied Holly blos
soms into a charming playwright, and
we can see in her the self-pitying Al
len of "Stardust" made human and
lovable.
He comes closest to making a
mistake in couching his good, noble,
long-suffering side in Mia Farrow;
he's doing for her what he did for
himself in earlier films, and 1 don't
think it works any better here. Hanna
is a maternal saint. Everyone dumps
their emotional problems on her, and
when she cries out "I have needs
too!", we have to applaud this
meager hint of selfishness. It's not a
plum role, and Farrow would do
better by Allen if he would stop
trying to ennoble her. (He couldn't
even give her a happy ending in
"Purple Rose" — that was his rotten
serious side coming through again.)
Allen has stopped trying to en
noble himself. His Mickey practically
represents a step back to an earlier,
simpler stage of despair, where his
fear of death was a combination of
funny and sincere, and it induced a
pang.

At first Mickey's hangups here
seem outside the concerns'of the
other characters, and we're not sure
how he's connected with them. But
his death anxiety and subsequent turn
to various religions is a funny, ex
treme variation on Holly's character,
and ties in with the general themes of
self-absorption and the quintessen
tially Woody Allen search for
meaning.
Those themes help tie together the
prodigiously large cast and intercon
necting storylines, which are a bit un
wieldy for the picture's standard
movie length. The ending comes on a
bit fast, and some of the subplots
seem truncated.
But Allen's directorial skills have
never been more commanding; he
pulls off scenes here that no one
would have guessed at watching his
early '70s comedies. Particularly
well-done are a lunch get-together
with Hanna and her sisters, and a
bookstore meeting between Elliot
and Lee.
Allen's name has come to mean a
special kind of magic for actors, and
he's attracted some great ones here,
with Wiest and Caine being the
standouts. They don't overshadow
the rest of the cast (no one grabs for
big effects in "Hanna"), yet their
characters seem the most fully drawn,
and the funniest.
The biggest problem I have with
this movie is that, for all the confi
dence Allen displays in his move back
into contemporary comedy, self
justifying platitudes lie just beneath
the surface. The big serious moment
comes for Mickey when he sits in a
movie house watching "Duck Soup,"
and decides to go on living because
"Any universe that can give us the
Marx Brothers can't be all bad."
Does anyone really need this life-is
wonderful-if-only-you-laugh pap?
"Hanna and Her Sisters" proves
you don't have to be deadly serious to
make a good film, yet Allen feels he
has to remind himself and us that
comedy is part of what makes life
bearable. The joy of this movie is that
virtually every frame shows him as
more relaxed, more confident in
being funny and serious; we don't
need the explicit comedy-is-good
message to enjoy ourselves, and nei
ther does Allen?

Movie critics have been hailing
"Hanna and her Sisters" as if it were
the second coming. David Ansen in
Newsweek magazine coos over the
characters' "telling" brooches and
"eloquent" raincoats; Vincent Canby
in The New York Times claims
Woody Allen's talent keeps growing
"in the manner of Jack's prodigious
beanstalk." Huh? Once you wipe the
drool from the screen, you'll find a
very entertaining comedy sinking un
der the weight of this silly praise.
I didn't care for "Hanna and Her
Sisters" as much as I did for Allen's
last film, "Purple Rose of Cairo,"
perhaps because "Hanna" doesn't
quite live up to its aspirations of nar
rative scope, while "Purple Rose"
worked brilliantly within its limits.
But critics are so hungry for a movie
they can unequivocally call great,
they're ready to pounce on anything
that appears to have been made with
some adult intelligence and craft.
An Allen picture, made with
complete control and outside the
Hollywood establishment, is by defi
nition a masterpiece.
Allen has stopped begging for this
kind of praise since his sterile
"Interiors" and the self-flagellating
"Manhattan" and "Stardust
Memories." He pulled back after the
excesses of those movies into a string
of small, precious comedies which
peaked with "Purple Rose."
"Hanna" represents a return to the
contemporary world — with all of its
contemporary concerns — for him,
and it's clear that he didn't set out to
make a masterpiece about Allen with
this picture. It took "Zelig,"
"Broadway Danny Rose" and
"Purple Rose" to grow beyond him
self; to diffuse his presence with an
accomplished cinematic technique,
and to focus on characters outside
himself.
Now he's back as the real-world
Woody Allen, but he doesn't put
himself at the center of "Hanna."
Though the the movie is about typical
Allen concerns, we no longer see him
as the tortured artist, wanting to be
serious, forced to be comic. We get
his serious sensibility, but muted and
filtered through a host of different

characters, and made less self
consciously funny.
The story follows the extended
family of Hanna (Mia Farrow) over
the course of a year, from one
Thanksgiving celebration to the next.
The thoughts of her adulterous hus
band, Elliot (Michael Caine), pene
trate the silence before the screen
even lights up; he's after one of
Hanna's sisters, Lee (Barbara Her
shey), who's living with a tem
peramental, domineering artist, Fred
erick (Max von Sydow).
Hanna's other sister, Holly (Diane
Wiest), a cocaine addict, has just
begun a catering service with her
friend April (Carrie Fisher), and in
cidentally competes with Lee for the
attentions of an architect (Sam
Waterston).
Allen himself plays Mickey, a TV
producer, and Allen's most ag
gressively paranoid hypochondriac
yet. Mickey is death-obsessed, Holly
is stability-obsessed and everyone in
this movie is self-obsessed — all ex
cept for the wonderfully secure
Hanna.
The contemporary feel of this
movie is not just grounded in the New
York City locations, beautifully
photographed by Carlos Di Palma;
it's also in the mentality of the char
acters, who are the neurotic artists'
souls we've seen before in Allen.
Their self-absorption, their demand
ing to be taken seriously, their lack of
forgiveness and concern for others
are entertaining and recognizable.
The "we generation" has grown up
and found, if not happiness, the fin
ancial security in which to feel af
fluently unfulfilled.
This is what "Hanna," when it's at
its funny and engaging best, is about.
In the interim between this movie and
his last modern comedy,
"Manhattan," Allen has watched the
cultured egocentrics he describes
(and portrays) so well. They're no
longer worried and jabbering about
their hangups; they've internalized
them, and become so self-centered

he's attracted some great ones here,
with Wiest and Caine being the
standouts. They don't overshadow
the rest of the cast (no one grabs for
big effects in "Hanna"), yet their
characters seem the most fully drawn,
and the funniest.
The biggest problem I have with
this movie is that, for all the confi
dence Allen displays in his move back
into contemporary comedy, self
justifying platitudes lie just beneath
the surface. The big serious moment
comes for Mickey when he sits in a
movie house watching "Duck Soup,"
and decides to go on living because
"Any universe that can give us the
Marx Brothers can't be all bad."
Does anyone really need this life-is
wonderful-if-only-you-laugh pap?
"Hanna and Her Sisters" proves
you don't have to be deadly serious to
make a good film, yet Allen feels he
has to remind himself and us that
comedy is part of what makes life
bearable. The joy of this movie is that
virtually every frame shows him as
more relaxed, more confident in
being funny and serious; we don't
need the explicit comedy-is-good
message to enjoy ourselves, and nei
ther does Allen?

Movie critics have been hailing
"Hanna and her Sisters" as if it were
the second coming. David Ansen in
Newsweek magazine coos over the
characters' "telling" brooches and
"eloquent" raincoats; Vincent Canby
in The New York Times claims
Woody Allen's talent keeps growing
"in the manner of Jack's prodigious
beanstalk." Huh? Once you wipe the
drool from the screen, you'll find a
very entertaining comedy sinking un
der the weight of this silly praise.
I didn't care for "Hanna and Her
Sisters" as much as I did for Allen's
last film, "Purple Rose of Cairo,"
perhaps because "Hanna" doesn't
quite live up to its aspirations of nar
rative scope, while "Purple Rose"
worked brilliantly within its limits.
But critics are so hungry for a movie
they can unequivocally call great,
they're ready to pounce on anything
that appears to have been made with
some adult intelligence and craft.
An Allen picture, made with
complete control and outside the
Hollywood establishment, is by defi
nition a masterpiece.
Allen has stopped begging for this
kind of praise since his sterile
"Interiors" and the self-flagellating
"Manhattan" and "Stardust
Memories." He pulled back after the
excesses of those movies into a string
of small, precious comedies which
peaked with "Purple Rose."
"Hanna" represents a return to the
contemporary world — with all of its
contemporary concerns — for him,
and it's clear that he didn't set out to
make a masterpiece about Allen with
this picture. It took "Zelig,"
"Broadway Danny Rose" and
"Purple Rose" to grow beyond him
self; to diffuse his presence with an
accomplished cinematic technique,
and to focus on characters outside
himself.
Now he's back as the real-world
Woody Allen, but he doesn't put
himself at the center of "Hanna."
Though the the movie is about typical
Allen concerns, we no longer see him
as the tortured artist, wanting to be
serious, forced to be comic. We get
his serious sensibility, but muted and
filtered through a host of different

characters, and made less self
consciously funny.
The story follows the extended
family of Hanna (Mia Farrow) over
the course of a year, from one
Thanksgiving celebration to the next.
The thoughts of her adulterous hus
band, Elliot (Michael Caine), pene
trate the silence before the screen
even lights up; he's after one of
Hanna's sisters, Lee (Barbara Her
shey), who's living with a tem
peramental, domineering artist, Fred
erick (Max von Sydow).
Hanna's other sister, Holly (Diane
Wiest), a cocaine addict, has just
begun a catering service with her
friend April (Carrie Fisher), and in
cidentally competes with Lee for the
attentions of an architect (Sam
Waterston).
Allen himself plays Mickey, a TV
producer, and Allen's most ag
gressively paranoid hypochondriac
yet. Mickey is death-obsessed, Holly
is stability-obsessed and everyone in
this movie is self-obsessed — all ex
cept for the wonderfully secure
Hanna.
The contemporary feel of this
movie is not just grounded in the New
York City locations, beautifully
photographed by Carlos Di Palma;
it's also in the mentality of the char
acters, who are the neurotic artists'
souls we've seen before in Allen.
Their self-absorption, their demand
ing to be taken seriously, their lack of
forgiveness and concern for others
are entertaining and recognizable.
The "we generation" has grown up
and found, if not happiness, the fin
ancial security in which to feel af
fluently unfulfilled.
This is what "Hanna," when it's at
its funny and engaging best, is about.
In the interim between this movie and
his last modern comedy,
"Manhattan," Allen has watched the
cultured egocentrics he describes
(and portrays) so well. They're no
longer worried and jabbering about
their hangups; they've internalized
them, and become so self-centered
they've developed a kind of confi
dence.
In "Hanna," characters like
Caine's Elliot are incapable of being
emotionally damaged (they're psyc
hologically barricaded).
An accountant, Elliot's imagina-

tion extends only so far as his needs;
concerning them he's verbose — a
shallow charmer — and he goes

through elaborate rationalizations to
justify his boobishness. One moment
he and Hanna are "moving apart

from one another," the next it's "I've
betrayed her." Elliot sees his i.n
decisiveness about whom he's hurting
most as a sign of his supreme sensitiv
ity, when all he's really analyzing is
how badly his various options hurt
him.
He and Lee are a perfect match;
she wants out of her relationship with
Frederick because "I'm suffocating. I
want a life, children." These aren't
just convenient cliches for Elliot and
Lee, these are their actual emotions
and notions of fulfillment. There's a
sublimated shock when we recognize
them from earlier Allen movies, but
with an ironic distance and light
parodic twist that doesn't jibe with his
neurotic/defensive sensibility in the
late '70s.
"Hanna" has facets of Allen in
every character; those of his past
films which were more openly per
sonal provide the clues for piecing to
gether the fragments. What is so
surprising and engaging is that here
we see some of Allen even in the silly
characters. Elliot's views on the
women in his life are too close to the
Allen characters in "Annie Hall" and
"Manhattan" not to be funny and
damning at once. Wiest's aimless,
perpetually dissatisfied Holly blos
soms into a charming playwright, and
we can see in her the self-pitying Al
len of "Stardust" made human and
lovable.
He comes closest to making a
mistake in couching his good, noble,
long-suffering side in Mia Farrow;
he's doing for her what he did for
himself in earlier films, and 1 don't
think it works any better here. Hanna
is a maternal saint. Everyone dumps
their emotional problems on her, and
when she cries out "I have needs
too!", we have to applaud this
meager hint of selfishness. It's not a
plum role, and Farrow would do
better by Allen if he would stop
trying to ennoble her. (He couldn't
even give her a happy ending in
"Purple Rose" — that was his rotten
serious side coming through again.)
Allen has stopped trying to en
noble himself. His Mickey practically
represents a step back to an earlier,
simpler stage of despair, where his
fear of death was a combination of
funny and sincere, and it induced a
pang.

At first Mickey's hangups here
seem outside the concerns'of the
other characters, and we're not sure
how he's connected with them. But
his death anxiety and subsequent turn
to various religions is a funny, ex
treme variation on Holly's character,
and ties in with the general themes of
self-absorption and the quintessen
tially Woody Allen search for
meaning.
Those themes help tie together the
prodigiously large cast and intercon
necting storylines, which are a bit un
wieldy for the picture's standard
movie length. The ending comes on a
bit fast, and some of the subplots
seem truncated.
But Allen's directorial skills have
never been more commanding; he
pulls off scenes here that no one
would have guessed at watching his
early '70s comedies. Particularly
well-done are a lunch get-together
with Hanna and her sisters, and a
bookstore meeting between Elliot
and Lee.
Allen's name has come to mean a
special kind of magic for actors, and
he's attracted some great ones here,
with Wiest and Caine being the
standouts. They don't overshadow
the rest of the cast (no one grabs for
big effects in "Hanna"), yet their
characters seem the most fully drawn,
and the funniest.
The biggest problem I have with
this movie is that, for all the confi
dence Allen displays in his move back
into contemporary comedy, self
justifying platitudes lie just beneath
the surface. The big serious moment
comes for Mickey when he sits in a
movie house watching "Duck Soup,"
and decides to go on living because
"Any universe that can give us the
Marx Brothers can't be all bad."
Does anyone really need this life-is
wonderful-if-only-you-laugh pap?
