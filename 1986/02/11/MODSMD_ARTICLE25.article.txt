## Goldman, Sachs offers golden opportunities 
### PHIL BLACK Staff writer 
Most Stanford students have heard
of Goldman, Sachs and Company.
Some might remember the contro
versy surrounding last year's inter
viewing process, while others may
recall discussion of the company's
problems with the Stanford Graduate
School of Business during the 19705.
Most of us, however, when hearing
"Goldman, Sachs and Company,"
think of big-time investment banking
and big-time money. At least, that is
what almost 200 undergraduates at
Stanford and more than 4,000 under
graduates nationwide think, because
they all applied for one of 38 posi
tions with Goldman, Sachs this year.
I talked with Don Cornwell, who is
in charge of divisional hiring, to bet
ter understand what Goldman, Sachs
is and why it is perennially ranked at
the top of the investment banking in
dustry.
Cornwell graduated from Occiden

tal College in 1969 with a degree in
government and went directly to Har
vard Business School, from where he
graduated in 1971. He has been with
Goldman, Sachs since then, and is
currently vice president of corporate
finance.
Cornwell explained why he had
come to Stanford. "Although only
one of every 100 undergraduates ap
plying for a position with us ever
receives a job offer, Stanford Univer
sity ranks as the most consistent
school for us." Last year, five of the
38 analysts were chosen from Stan
ford.
Goldman, Sachs and Stanford first
met in 1980 when Peter Joost, a 1980
Stanford graduate, "walked in from
the street" and applied for a job. His
subsequent job performance, coupled
with that of two 1981 graduates who
also applied on their own, convinced
Goldman, Sachs to initiate its own
screening process at Stanford. Conse
quently, since 1982 Stanford has
been one of 10 schools that Goldman,
Sachs visits to recruit students.
This year, 192 Stanford seniors
wanted to interview with Goldman,
Sachs. Twenty-six of those seniors
"bid" enough points to get on
Goldman, Sachs' two open schedules.
(Each senior is given 1,000 points to
bid, and the highest bidders on each
employer's sheet are placed on the
open schedules). The remaining 166
submitted resumes which Goldman,
Sachs screened before selected an
other 33 to interview.
I asked Cornwell what Goldman,
Sachs looks for in an applicant's
resume. Interestingly, they want

many of the same qualities that the
Stanford Admissions Office wants: a
student who has excelled academi
cally and participated in many extra
curricular activities.
From past experience, Goldman,
Sachs has found that a student who
has been involved in a variety of ac
tivities at college is best able to adapt
to a multi-faceted job at Goldman,
Sachs. While at Stanford you might
juggle 18 units, work at the ASSU,

and play on the rugby team, as an
analyst you might juggle a $500 mil
lion debt offering and a $100 million
initial public offering and perhaps
work on an acquisitions case.
However, resumes well-stocked
with activities are only the first thing
Goldman, Sachs examines. The cru
cial point comes when Goldman,
Sachs gets to meet you in an inter
view. An interview allows the com
pany to look for people they feel will

fit in well with the company.
Cornwell revealed. "We like people
who allow their real self to be seen.
Those who come across as overly
polished interviewers tend not to do
as well as those who are more
genuine, self-confident and down to
earth."
If the competition is so fierce and
your chances of receiving a job are no
better than one in 100, then why
bother interviewing with Goldman,
Sachs?
"It was Goldman, Sachs' reputa
tion, compensation and valuable
work experience that really appealed
to me," said Jeff Schroder, one of the
59 seniors interviewed this year.
Dave Furth, another interviewee,
concurred, adding, "The reputation
that Goldman, Sachs carries is the
main reason I applied."
Indeed, it is widely known that
Goldman, Sachs and Company is one
of the most respected firms on Wall
Street. And, of course, the compensa
tion of approximately $40,000 a year
nicely complements the challenges
that you undertake.
I asked Cornwell that same ques
tion I posed to Schroder â€” why is
Goldman, Sachs so popular among
college seniors? His answer was two
fold.
"Investment banking is a very
high-profile business in the '80s," he
said. "The sex appeal and glamour of
the job naturally garners a large num
ber of applicants. Furthermore, be
cause our positions are for only two
years, many students who hope to ob
tain an MBA are attracted to our fin
ancial analyst position."

Goldman, Sachs can offer a student
a chance to work very closely with
seasoned professionals and become
an integral part of the work and
transactions of the company.
Goldman, Sachs accomplishes that
goal by working on the buddy system.
The analysts receive "hands on"
management training by being as
signed to one other senior person
who works on the projects with them.
Last year a financial analyst played
such an integral role in two separate
mergers involving ABC and RCA
that he was pictured next to John
Weinberger, the chairman of
Goldman, Sachs, in a U.S. News &
World Report article.
The recognition and the satisfac
tion of doing your job well does not,
however, come easily. Many long
days are required of every person in
order to satisfy the clients in a prompt
and efficient way. Consequently, you
might find yourself short of time for
some activities that you would like to
pursue. Cornwell pointed out,
though, that the challenges you face
more than overcome the free time
that you lose.
This was supported by Steve
Pierce, a 1984 Stanford graduate,
who is currently in his second year
with Goldman, Sachs. "The work has
demanded more of my time than
what 1 first expected. However, it has
been much more fun and challenging
than I thought it would be. My job
has made me learn to utilize my free
time in the best way possible.
"If, in 1984, I had to do it all over
again, I would not hesitate to take
Goldman, Sachs' offer."
