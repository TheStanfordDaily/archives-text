## Basketballers need support in Maples 
### 
Something unfortunate has hap
pened in sports in the past several
years: Fans have felt the need to
become more than spectators. They
now feel they must become an inte
gral part of the game.
There has always been the suppor
tive aspect of rooting for a team â€”
cheering your side, exhorting them
and jeering the hated opposition. But
the ideal of sportsmanship seems to
have disappeared.
We have reached the point where a
football crowd feels compelled to
make enough noise that the visiting
team cannot call its signals. And,
more universally, where a basketball
crowd is compelled when the vistors
shoot free throws to scream, wave
arms and even jump on the floor to
distract the shooter.
Not that fans have always behaved
politely. There are plenty of examples
in the past of players having beer
poured on them and having objects
thrown at them, not to mention
having their lives threatened.

Ducky Medwick being ordered out
of left field for the St. Louis Cardinals
by the commissioner during the 1934
World Series for his own safety is one
example that comes to mind. But
most of those were isolated incidents,
the death threats usually the work of
sick individuals.
Today, however, there is a group
psychology inherent in attempting to
influence the outcome of games. The
scoreboard at Gill Coliseum at
Oregon State exhorts "Live End
Zones/Not Dead Zones" when oppo
nents shoot free throws. Cities and
schools are called supportive or not
supportive because of the level of ob
noxiousness they can reach.
Now, after decrying this behavior, I
will encourage Stanford basketball
fans to become more obnoxious and
more intimidating toward visiting
teams.
I don't like to do it. I don't like to
see it. But it is the only way we're
going to even out the imbalance that
would occur otherwise.
In the Pacific 10 Conference, each
basketball team plays the other nine
twice, once at home, once on the
road. Stanford must play nine games
in hostile arenas where fans try to dis
rupt Stanford's free throws and its of
fense, where they try to intimidate
the Cardinal players and the officials.
McKale Center at Arizona is the
ultimate in this type of harassment.
The Wildcat fans challenge every
borderline call that goes against
them, and constantly make a deafen
ing amount of noise whenever the op
position would most want quiet.
When Stanford played at McKale,
Arizona came away with a 77-69 win.
When the teams met here, the Card
inal won 62-56. Granted, not
definitive proof of the benefits of a

loud home cheering section, but the
Wildcats' 5-0 Pac-10 record at home
and 2-3 record on the road also lends
some credence to the idea.
To put the Cardinal on equal
footing with the rest of the league,
Stanford fans must be equally sup
portive. In contrast with the comatose
gathering at the victory against
UCLA two weeks ago, Saturday's
crowd was very vocal.
Arizona Coach Lute Olson said,
"And the home crowd, when it's as
involved as it was today, doesn't let
the home team give up." Olson also
believed the crowd Saturday did in
fluence the officials.
Officials won't admit to ever being
influenced, but Stanford did get the
majority of close calls in that game,
just as Arizona got most close calls in
Tucson.
Actively trying to influence the
outcome of a game may violate the
sense of fair play of many at Stanford.
It violates my own. But in a league
where a crowd influences half the
Cardinal's games in favor of the op
ponent, fairness may only be
achieved by having a Stanford crowd
work in Stanford's favor for the other
half.
Stanford fans could say that their
self-respect prevents them from act
ing like this and that is the important
thing. Losing is a price to pay for
maintaining dignity. Personally, I'd
rather see a winner.
No stigma
In the past few days, the Stanford
men's and women's basketball teams
lost close games when players missed
crucial free throws late in the game.
Thursday, Todd Lichti missed two
free throws with 1:47 left in overtime
and Stanford leading 75-73, then
missed the front end of a one-and
one with the game tied 75-75 with 54
seconds left. Stanford lost to Arizona
State, 77-75.
Saturday, Virginia Sourlis was
fouled and barely missed a layup with
Stanford trailing Fresno State, 63-61,
with seven seconds left. Sourlis
missed the first free throw, and Stan
ford lost, 65-62.
The word that instantly comes to
mind in such an instance is "choke."
It is the worst label one can attach to
an athlete, that he or she chokes in
the clutch. One who misses a crucial
free throw chokes.
There are instances where pressure
situations cause athletes to fail where
they can and have succeeded. I've
had it happen more than I care to re
member.
But we forget that athletes fail
without pressure being a factor. And
we forget that for an athlete to be in a
situation where a contest rests on his
or her efforts, the coach or
teammates must have confidence in
that athlete, confidence that has been
earned. Merely to reach such a point
is a success.
Lichti and Sourlis are the best
players on their respective teams.
They will succeed often in similar sit
uations, because they will be looked
to in similar situations. They are not
stigmatized because of their failures
last week.
