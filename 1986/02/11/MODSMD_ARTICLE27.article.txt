# Netters drop Santa Clara
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
Flaying on the same team as fourth-ranked Patty Fen
dick, ninth-ranked Marianne Werdel, l Ith-ranked Eleni
Rossides and defending NCAA doubles champion Leigh
Anne Eldredge, junior Stephanie Savides and sophomore
Kay Tittle have a tendency to be overlooked.
But yesterday Savides and Tittle got their chance to
play No. I and No. 2, respectively, and led the top-ranked
Stanford women's tennis team to a 9-0 blowout of visiting
Santa Clara.
Normally the fifth and sixth players on the squad,
Savides and Tittle were moved up in the lineup yesterday
with the top four players unable to compete in the
opening dual match. Fendick and Werdel are competing
in the Lipton professional tournament in Boca Raton, Fla.
Rossides was eliminated from the Lipton tournament in
the second qualifying round and might rejoin the Cardinal
lineup for tomorrow's match with San Jose State.
Eldredge returned Sunday night from the Rolex Na
tional Intercollegiate Championships in Houston, but will
not play this week for Stanford. "She needs time to catch
up in her classes after being in Houston," Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan said.
Even without this talented foursome, however, the
outcome of yesterday's match could have been predicted
well before it started. Santa Clara may have produced
Kurt Rambis, but it is not known for churning out tremen
dous women's tennis teams.
Despite the relative lack of an opponent, Brennan was
pleased with what he saw yesterday. "In a match like this,

Senior co-captain Susan Ross made the most of a rare playing opportunity today as she
downed Santa Clara's Maureen Feltz 6-0, 6-2. Stanford easily defeated the Broncos, 9-0.
we're obviously expected to win," he
said. "But you want everyone to play
well and consistently. Today every
one was very consistent with their ef

fort. They didn't let up at the end."
Savides combined a powerful
forehand with an effective net game
to defeat Santa Clara s Tina Crivello
6-1, 6-2. In the No. 2 match, Tittle fi
nessed her way to a 6-0, 6-3 victory
over the Broncos' Jennifer Steen.
Sophomore Can Hagey romped past
Santa Clara's Kathy Voile 6-1, 6-2 to
capture the No. 3 singles match.
Senior Co-captains Elise Werdel
and Susan Ross were victorious at
No. 4 and No. 5 singles, respectively.
Werdel shut out Christine Rehwinkel
and Ross defeated Maureen Feltz 6-
0, 6-2. In the final singles match,
Stanford's Cindy Spiekerman out
played Santa Clara's Amy Leonard 6-
2, 6-1.
By the time the Stanford doubles
team had walked on the courts, the
outcome of the match had already
been decided, but the Cardinal's con
centration remained strong.
Playing at No. 1, Savides and
Hagey quickly disposed of Crivello
and Rehwinkel, 6-1, 6-0. The team of
Ross-Spiekerman was challenged by
Santa Clara's Steen and Voile, but
the Stanford pair prevailed, 6-3, 6-4.

opening dual match. Fendick and Werdel are competing
in the Lipton professional tournament in Boca Raton, Fla.
Rossides was eliminated from the Lipton tournament in
the second qualifying round and might rejoin the Cardinal
lineup for tomorrow's match with San Jose State.
Eldredge returned Sunday night from the Rolex Na
tional Intercollegiate Championships in Houston, but will
not play this week for Stanford. "She needs time to catch
up in her classes after being in Houston," Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan said.
Even without this talented foursome, however, the
outcome of yesterday's match could have been predicted
well before it started. Santa Clara may have produced
Kurt Rambis, but it is not known for churning out tremen
dous women's tennis teams.
Despite the relative lack of an opponent, Brennan was
pleased with what he saw yesterday. "In a match like this,

we're obviously expected to win," he
said. "But you want everyone to play
well and consistently. Today every
one was very consistent with their ef

fort. They didn't let up at the end."
Savides combined a powerful
forehand with an effective net game
to defeat Santa Clara s Tina Crivello
6-1, 6-2. In the No. 2 match, Tittle fi
nessed her way to a 6-0, 6-3 victory
over the Broncos' Jennifer Steen.
Sophomore Can Hagey romped past
Santa Clara's Kathy Voile 6-1, 6-2 to
capture the No. 3 singles match.
Senior Co-captains Elise Werdel
and Susan Ross were victorious at
No. 4 and No. 5 singles, respectively.
Werdel shut out Christine Rehwinkel
and Ross defeated Maureen Feltz 6-
0, 6-2. In the final singles match,
Stanford's Cindy Spiekerman out
played Santa Clara's Amy Leonard 6-
2, 6-1.
By the time the Stanford doubles
team had walked on the courts, the
outcome of the match had already
been decided, but the Cardinal's con
centration remained strong.
Playing at No. 1, Savides and
Hagey quickly disposed of Crivello
and Rehwinkel, 6-1, 6-0. The team of
Ross-Spiekerman was challenged by
Santa Clara's Steen and Voile, but
the Stanford pair prevailed, 6-3, 6-4.

Flaying on the same team as fourth-ranked Patty Fen
dick, ninth-ranked Marianne Werdel, l Ith-ranked Eleni
Rossides and defending NCAA doubles champion Leigh
Anne Eldredge, junior Stephanie Savides and sophomore
Kay Tittle have a tendency to be overlooked.
But yesterday Savides and Tittle got their chance to
play No. I and No. 2, respectively, and led the top-ranked
Stanford women's tennis team to a 9-0 blowout of visiting
Santa Clara.
Normally the fifth and sixth players on the squad,
Savides and Tittle were moved up in the lineup yesterday
with the top four players unable to compete in the
opening dual match. Fendick and Werdel are competing
in the Lipton professional tournament in Boca Raton, Fla.
Rossides was eliminated from the Lipton tournament in
the second qualifying round and might rejoin the Cardinal
lineup for tomorrow's match with San Jose State.
