# Cardinal falls to top-ranked Pepperdine
## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
In its worst performance so far this
season, the fifth-ranked Stanford
men's volleyball team fell to No. 1
Pepperdine, 15-9, 15-5, 15-8 last
night in the final match of a six-day,
four-game road trip.
The Cardinal drops to 5-2 overall,
4-2 in the California Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association (CIVA),
while the Waves remain undefeated,
6-0 overall, 3-0 in conference play.
Playing without senior All-
American Jon Root, who went down
with a severely sprained ankle against
Long Beach State last Friday night,
Stanford managed a hitting percent of
only .011. The Cardinal had 30 kills
but 29 hitting errors.
Defending national champion Pep
perdine, on the other hand, had a
.446 percentage.
The Waves, who beat No. 2 UCLA
in four games last week, are playing
under first-year coach Rod Wilde,
who took over when Marv Dunphy
left to coach the U.S. women's team.
The squad features two Ail-
Americans, Rob Scott and Matt Rigg.
Leading Pepperdine were senior
outside hitter Steve Friedman with 13
kills and Troy Tanner with 11.
For Stanford, senior outside hitter
Chris Braun had 11 kills but 10 hit
ting errors for a .050 hitting
percentage. Sophomore Ail-
American candidate Scott Fortune
followed with eight kills; however
with nine hitting errors, the middle
blocker finished with a -.037
percentage.

It's not known how long Root will
be out for the Cardinal. Early reports
s. id a week and a half, but Root said
Sunday that he may see action against
Loyola Marymount at home this
Friday.
"We'll have to wait and see about
Root," Stanford Co-coach Don
Shaw said. "We don't want him to try
and come back too soon. Volleyball is
not a sport that you can play on a
sprained ankle.

"It'll be tough to play without Jon
if he's going to be out a while. We
don't have the depth or versatility for
one or two guys to have off nights,"
Shaw added.
"Pepperdine's the number one
team, they're real solid. They have a
good team, we have a crippled team.
Under the circumstances, getting two
wins in the four games is okay. A split
on the road anytime is good. The win
over UCSB (last Wednesday) helped

us out, the loss to Long Beach (Friday
night) didn't."
(The Cardinal also beat San Diego
State in three games on Saturday.)
Stanford goes back into action
against Loyola Marymount Friday
night at 7:30 in Maples Pavilion. The
Lions are 7-3 overall and have yet to
see CIVA action but will meet Pep
perdine Wednesday night before
coming north to face the Cardinal.
