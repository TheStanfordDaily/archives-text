Skiing
One champagne cork skipped
down the snow at Incline, followed
by seven women and a few men of
the Stanford ski team after the last
local race of the season. The reason
tor rejoicing was official; the Card
inal women's A-Team had clinched
ths Northern California Division
title and earned a berth in the Na
tional Championships at Killington,
Vt. at the end of the month.
The Farm will be represented out
East by veterans Liz Atkinson,
Aimee Berg, Mardi Dier, Nina
Kazazian, Katherine Strickler, Alex
Weiher and freshman Shelley St.
Laurent
Saturday was slightly less dra
matic as the Stanford women won
another challenging slalom race on
the Tahoe slopes. St. Laurent, At
kinson, and Strickler, by finishing in
fourth, fifth and sixth place,
respectively, overpowered the seven
other teams. Senior Dier placed
11th.
In the giant slalom on Sunday,
California won, edging Stanford by
six points â€” barely denting the
Card's 37-point season lead. St.
Laurent won the race in typical
fashion, followed by sophomore
Weiher and Bohlke, who finished
eighth and 1 Ith.
While the women's team blazed
to glory, the Stanford men's season
fizzled to a halt. In the slalom, only
Tim Nolan and Mark Handley had
clean finishes for the Cardinal,
placing fifth and 17th overall. The
team placed sixth as Stanford's

remaining five racers fell.
In the giant slalom, the men had
more problems. Brad Swett and
Nolan both lost skis on the course,
while Griff Steiner lost his in the
starting gate after a graceful flip.
Stanford came in a disappointing
sixth place overall, despite solid
runs by Chip Hazard, Handley and
Brian Karr, who took eighth. 16th
and 20th place.
Men's Rugby
Last Saturday saw the Stanford's
men s rugby team take the lead for
the first time in the second half only
to lose it and the contest to Santa
Clara.
The Broncos jumped out to an
early 3-0 lead on a penalty field goal
and soon followed that with a try,
yet missed the conversion kick. The
rest of the first half saw both teams
move the ball up and down the field
with neither club able to score.
Santa Clara entered halftime with a
7-0 lead.
The ruggers' previous outing was
three weeks earlier and this was
very apparent in their play during
the first half. Santa Clara was able
to capitalize on early Cardinal er
rors and dominated the entire first
half.
The beginning of the second half
was a complete turnaround. The
Cardinal ruggers marched the ball
at will and took a 9-7 lead on a
penalty kick. But this was the last
lead the team was to see, as Santa

Clara stormed past Stanford to win,
17-9.
In other action, the Cardinal 2
team was victorious against the
Broncos, while the 3 team lost.
Ice Hockey
The Stanford ice hockey team
emerged from its weekend road trip
to southern California frustrated by
four losses and no victories.
The long drive south and the
scheduling of the four games in only
two days took its toll on the Card
inal and led to inconsistent play and
third period fatigue. The team was
also without leading scorer John
Zierk, who is sidelined with appen
dicitis.
The team came out flat Saturday
morning against USC, losing 14-2 in
a game that saw Stanford give up
five goals in the first two minutes.
Later that evening the icemen
faced Fullerton State. Skating with
only two lines, the team tired in the
third period, allowing Fullerton to
turn what had been a tight game
into a 12-4 rout.
On Sunday morning, the team
again lost its legs in the third period
against USC. Despite leading much
of the game behind the solid play of
goalie Burke Thornton, the Card
inal finally succumbed 7-5 due to
several late-game lapses.
The exhausted and battered
skaters took to the ice for the final
time Sunday night for a rematch
against Fullerton. Again fresher

bodies prevailed, as Fullerton won
12-6.
Stanford forward Scott Bommer
led Stanford's offense on the
weekend, notching four goals and
three assists. Bob Mulroy, Scott Til
ley and Dave Wright each netted
three goals.
Badminton
Stanford's Benjy Wincure won
the A men's singles title and teamed
with Tim Softley to capture the A
doubles at the UC-Davis Intercol
legiate Badminton Tournament last
weekend.
In the team results, the Cardinal
finished second behind Davis with
32 points. The tournament signified
the first NorCal league match for
Stanford.
Tertia Belt of Stanford was vic
torious in the B lady singles at
Davis. She also teamed with Softley
to finish second in the A mixed
doubles, barely losing in three
games.
Elsewhere, Stanford's Joy
Kitzmiller strengthened her seeding
for the upcoming U.S. Nationals by
winning the open lady singles and
open lady doubles at the New Eng
land Badminton Championships in
Boston.
Kitzmiller won the championship
singles match convincingly by scores
of 11-2 and 11-3. In doubles, she
teamed with Boston native Barb
McKinley to win the final match.
15-4, 10-15, 15-7.
