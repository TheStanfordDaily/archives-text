# SOSA: shanty will rise again
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Black Student Union (BSU) mem
bers yesterday expressed outrage at
the destruction of the shantytown in
White Plaza, and Stanford Out of
South Africa (SOSA) members have
issued a statement announcing plans
to rebuild and maintain the structure.
"SOSA will not allow this act of
violence to dampen the divestment
movement. We will . . . rebuild the
shantytown as a symbol of the plight
of black South Africans," SOSA
stated.
"We've decided not to back down
to aggressive student behavior,"
SOSA member Joel Bellensen said
yesterday.
Police believe the cardboard and
wood structure built by SOSA mem

bers last month was razed by vandals
early Sunday morning.
BSU President Steven Phillips said
yesterday that members have ex
pressed "anger and a certain amount
of outrage" at the destruction of the
shanty.
"It's an insensitive, physical attack
on the progressive movement," Phil
lips said.
Phillips, a senior, added that while
he could not speculate on whether the
act was racially motivated, the van
dalism remained effectively a racist
act.
"The University is failing in its mis
sion to educate and enlighten people
(about racism)," said Phillips, adding
that the BSU is discussing holding a
forum on campus concerning racism.
