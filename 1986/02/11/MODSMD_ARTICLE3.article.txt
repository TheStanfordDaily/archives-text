## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Black Student Union (BSU) mem
bers yesterday expressed outrage at
the destruction of the shantytown in
White Plaza, and Stanford Out of
South Africa (SOSA) members have
issued a statement announcing plans
to rebuild and maintain the structure.
"SOSA will not allow this act of
violence to dampen the divestment
movement. We will . . . rebuild the
shantytown as a symbol of the plight
of black South Africans," SOSA
stated.
"We've decided not to back down
to aggressive student behavior,"
SOSA member Joel Bellensen said
yesterday.
Police believe the cardboard and
wood structure built by SOSA mem

bers last month was razed by vandals
early Sunday morning.
BSU President Steven Phillips said
yesterday that members have ex
pressed "anger and a certain amount
of outrage" at the destruction of the
shanty.
"It's an insensitive, physical attack
on the progressive movement," Phil
lips said.
Phillips, a senior, added that while
he could not speculate on whether the
act was racially motivated, the van
dalism remained effectively a racist
act.
"The University is failing in its mis
sion to educate and enlighten people
(about racism)," said Phillips, adding
that the BSU is discussing holding a
forum on campus concerning racism.
University President Donald Ken
nedy said yesterday that the van
dalism undermines efforts to edu
cate students about racism.
"I think we need to try to find out
what we can, and discourage any kind
of view that interfering with other
people's (right to express themselves)
is an appropriate mode of discourse,"
Kennedy said yesterday.
"1 think there have been and ought
to continue to be a lot of forums and
approaches to dealing with racism on
campus," Kennedy said, in response
to the BSU's plan.
"1 think this community has done
pretty well about issues like this (in
the past)," Kennedy said.
Stanford Police Sgt. Timothy Han
rahan, who acknowledged Sunday
that chances of locating the people
responsible were "small," was un
available for comment last night.
Students, while differing in their
assessment of the motivations for the
vandalism, have echoed the frustra
tion expressed by BSU and SOS A
members.
Junior Kevin Quinn described the
incident as "major uncool."
Sophomore Chris Corr called the
incident "more thoughtless than ra
cially motivated. .. . Some guys prob
ably got drunk and kicked it over."
