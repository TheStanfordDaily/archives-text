"The competition wasn't all that
tough," Stanford senior Albert Boyce
said. "Everyone sailed pretty well,
and we definitely beat the competi
tion."
The field included 20 boats from
Northern and Southern California di
vision schools. The only school to
even challenge the Cardinal was UC-
Irvine, which placed second.
On Saturday, the team of Drew
Cashier and Kristen Boyles took first

in the A-division for Stanford with
teammates Rich Bergsend and
Marika Fussganger second. The team
of Dan Buckstaff and Susy Pritchett
took first in the B-division, giving the
Cardinal a combined score good
enough for first place overall.
"Dan and Drew sailed really well,"
Boyce said. "Everybody was pretty
happy."
Sunday brought much of the same,
with Buckstaff and Pritchett taking
the A-division and the team of Gash
ler and Boyles grabbing second. In
the B-division, Bergsend and Fus
sganger took first and Boyce and
lima Rodriguez finished third, one
point out of second.
Sailing well on Sunday were
Courtney Biggert, Rona Sisson and
DJ Berinstein, all skippering for the
first time.
"The women's team is up and com
ing," Bergsend said.
The light to medium wind condi
tions provided the teams with a chal
lenge, but the Stanford team was up
to it.
"It was enough wind to be interest
ing," Boyles said. "Stanford really
showed a lot of ability to sail in differ
ent conditions. I think we did well to
adjust to tricky conditions."
This regatta, counting toward the
overall scores for the season, should
boost Stanford in the national
rankings.
