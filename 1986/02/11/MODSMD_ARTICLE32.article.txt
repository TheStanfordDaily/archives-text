# Stanislaus up next

### CHRIS MYERS Staff writer 
If the Cardinal baseball team is
looking for a confidence-booster
after a hard weekend at Sunken
Diamond, this afternoon's 2 p.m.
matchup with the Cal State-
Stanislaus Warriors may be just
what the doctor ordered.
The Cardinal is coming off a tilt
with UC-Santa Barbara that saw
the team drop its first three-game
series in two seasons, bringing
Stanford's overall record to 6-2.
Stanislaus State, meanwhile, is a
Division 111 team making its an
nual foray into Division I play with
Stanford. The Warriors have two
wins and a tie on the year.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
knows very little about the Stanis
laus State team, but said that the
Cardinal will have to play well to
win. Indeed, the Warriors are no
cupcakes, having captured two Di
vision 111 national championships
and two second-place finishes in
the last 10 years
Stanislaus State is led by out
fielder Jeff Hintz and second
baseman Bart McAfee. The War
rior pitching staff is thin this year,
according to team statistician
Dave Gomes, so the Cardinal
batsmen are likely to see more
â™¦jrirv onp rtitrhpr most likelv Tony

Green and Don Cabral.
As for Stanford, Marquess, with
his pitching staff depleted by the
three-game weekend, plans to use
at least three pitchers. Freshman
righthander Steve Chitren will
probably start, with fellow fresh
man righties Brian Keyser and Jim
Price in relief. Chitren and Keyser
have seen only four-and-a-third
innings of action between them so
far this season, and Price has yet to
throw an official pitch.
"The three-game weekend
forces us to use some different
pitchers," Marquess said. "That
will be good for us."
Assessing the Cardinal's perfor
mance after eight games,
Marquess said he likes what he
sees defensively and on the
basepaths but is hoping for im
provement in other areas.
"We're ahead of where I
thought we'd be defensively; we're
playing pretty good defense," he
said. "Offensively, we're behind
schedule, and we're a little behind
pitching-wise. We just haven't put
everything together yet."
As a team, the Cardinal is bat
ting .269 for the season, and the
pitching staff has a combined 4.74
ERA.
On the basepaths, Stanford has
hotfooted it to a prodigious 37 steals
in 43 attempts. The leading thief is
leftfielder Walt Harris, who is a per
fect 10-for-10 in stolen base attempts
going into today's game. In 62 games
last season, Harris had a com
paratively meager 24 steals.
Rightfielder Toi Cook is also perfect
on the basepaths so far, with eight
bases stolen in eight tries.
Today's game will be a much
needed tune-up for Stanford, as it
prepares for this weekend's trip to the
University of Hawaii, where it will
meet the nationally-ranked Rainbows
for a three-game series.
