# Georgia Tech to visit top-ranked Cardinal
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
The No. 1-ranked Stanford men's
tennis team opens its 1986 home
season this afternoon by hosting
Georgia Tech in a 1:30 start on the
Varsity Courts.
The Cardinal is 1-0 so far this year,
having beaten the San Jose State
Spartans last week by a 7-2 score.
Georgia Tech is coming off a 5-3 vic
tory over the Spartans yesterday.
The Yellow Jackets are not ranked
in the top 25, but that fact doesn't
make Stanford Coach Dick Gould
feel any more relaxed.
"They're not in the preseason
rankings, but I think they're better
than that," Gould said. "TTiey have a
good combination of depth, youth
and experience."
Tech is led by Bryan Shelton, who
is ranked 33rd in the nation in singles.
Shelton lost to No. 2-ranked Dan
Goldie of Stanford in the NCAA
tournament last year in three sets.
The two players may have a rematch
tomorrow.
The Yellow Jackets also feature
Ken Thorne, the National Amateur
Champion. Thorne defeated San Jose
State's Nelson Banes yesterday, 6-4,
6-1.
On the other side of the court,
Stanford boasts five out of the 50
highest-ranked singles player in the

country. Goldie, who played five
matches this past weekend while
finishing second at the Rolex Na
tional Intercollegiate Indoor Cham
pionships in Houston, will probably
be rested enough to play today.
Third-ranked Jim Grabb, however,
is an uncertainty for today's match.
The Cardinal senior is recovering
from a slight injury, and Gould said
that he would like to have Grabb at
least play doubles.

action, as Gould's lineup is still un
certain.
Today's match will be a homecom
ing of sorts for Georgia Tech coach
Gery Groslimond. Groslimond was a
member of Stanford's first NCAA
championship team in 1973 under the
tutelage of Gould.
