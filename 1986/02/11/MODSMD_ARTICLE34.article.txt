### LISA MARTINEZ Staff writer 
This weekend, the Stanford fencers scored an over
whelming victory over UC-Santa Cruz, the women crush
ing the Sea Lions 13-3 and the men coming in at 17-10.
According to Stanford Coach Buzz Hurst, "Santa Cruz
(the five-year All-Cal champs) is a balanced and reason
ably strong team. They're not pushovers. For us to beat
them this decisively is a good solid victory."
Despite the absence of No. 3 fencer Alison Reid and
No. 5 Vicki Levin, the Cardinal women dominated the
meet. "This gives an interesting picture of how strongly
the women's team has developed," Hurst said. "With two
of six women out sick, we were still able to beat them with
the same score as we did when we had a full lineup."
Jennifer Yu, women's team captain, was undefeated,
adding to her 46-0 record for the season. Holly Taylor
was also 4-0, compiling a 40-4 season record. "Jennifer
and Holly executed their usual search-and-destroy mis
sion," Hurst said.
"I thought she fenced remarkably well," Hurst said of
No. 6 Vered Sharon who compiled a 2-2 record against
the Sea Lions.
"Santa Cruz has good technique but not a lot of experi
ence," captain Jennifer Yu said. "We fenced really well
even though we were not at full strength."
According to Hurst, the men's teams "put on a good
show Saturday," jumping into the No. 6 position in the

national polls. "Santa Cruz has really improved since last
time. But the issue was really not in doubt after the first
few bouts," he added.
"The key men for this competition were Larry Murk
(epee captain), Andy Goorno (sabre captain) and (No. 2
sabreman) Steve Levitan," Hurst said. "They all came
through with 3-0 records. Vince Bradshaw and Mike
Cramer also did extremely good jobs."
Hurst was particularly pleased with the performance of
the epee team. "Santa-Cruz had a solid epee team," he
said. "Their lead fencer, Bryn Kanar, was extremely dan
gerous. Larry Murk defeated him quite decisively and
Vince Bradshaw did good reliable backup work. Our men
looked very solid and very poised as they brought us a 6-3
victory."
Led by Andy Goorno, 33-2 for the season, the sabre
team was the "juggernaut," according to Hurst, with an 8-
1 overall score. "Sabre did a very good solid job," Hurst
said. "They dominated from the start and maintained con
trol throughout the meet."
The foil team's 6-3 loss came as a surprise to the Stan
ford coach. "Their foil team beat us decisively," Hurst
said. "There is a window of vulnerability in men's foil that
we have to close."
"We were clearly the better team," foil captain Elliott
Cheu commented. "The foil team just had a slight let
down." .
"This was a good job for the Stanford fencing teams,"
sabreman Steve Levitan said. "We really worked hard."
