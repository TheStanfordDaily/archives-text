Haiti leader promises democracy
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, leader of
Haiti's provisional government, promised yesterday to work for the es
tablishment of a "genuine and functional democracy" with popular pres
idential elections.
Namphy called for a more just distribution of national wealth and for
"absolute respect for human rights."
In outlining the four-day-old government's program, Namphy
touched on many of the demands voiced in a wave of popular protests
that led to the downfall Friday of President Jean-Claude Duvalier.
Nevertheless, some Haitians who opposed Duvalier have criticized the
new government because many of its members were associated with the
old regime.
Namphy spoke at the installation yesterday of a new Cabinet. Among
the 13 Cabinet ministers taking office were at least five who had been
high officials under Duvalier.
Duvalier, 34, fled the country before dawn Friday, leaving power in
the hands of a five-member National Government Council. Namphy,
who was armed forces chief of staff under Duvalier, is president of the
council.
Other members include two army colonels and a former Duvalier
public works minister. A third colonel is the council's adviser.
A Haitian journalist with Radio Lumiere, an independent station
operated by Baptists, said yesterday that the reaction of people to the
new government was mixed.
"It is a government without Duvalier but Duvalierism is still there,"
said the journalist, who asked not to be identified by name. "People
want to avoid sparking another fire but to progressively eliminate
Duvalierism."
5 dead in S. African in-fighting
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The charred bodies of five black
men, their arms and legs bound tightly with thin wire, were found
outside Port Elizabeth yesterday on a smoldering pyre of gasoline
soaked tires, the apparent victims of renewed black political in-fighting
there.
The five, burned almost beyond recognition, were presumed to be
members of the small Azanian National Youth Unity group, two more of
whom were hacked with axes and machetes to death Saturday afternoon
in attacks by political rivals.
The seven deaths raised fears of renewed and murderous feuding
among black political groups. Such internecine clashes killed more than
60 blacks, mostly in the Port Elizabeth area.
"This is definitely the worst case we have ever had of this type of mass
killing," Lt. Col. Gerrie van Rooyen, a police spokesman, said in Port
Elizabeth. "You can be certain the killings will not end with this. There
will be reprisals and more reprisals until the whole black community is
virtually at war."
Police meanwhile reported the deaths of nine other blacks in the
country's continuing civil strife, now in its 18th month. Six were killed in
a faction fight between rival clans of Zulus south of Durban, where three
black policemen had been shot and then hacked to death Sunday.
The five blacks who were burned to death in Port Elizabeth's New
Brighton township were believed to have been among the more than 20
abducted Saturday, and police speculated they may have been tried as
government collaborators or perhaps as traitors to South Africa's black
revolution at a "people's court."
The fate of the others who were abducted over the weekend, some off
downtown streets in Port Elizabeth, is still unknown, and rumors circ
ulated wildly yesterday of an imminent reprisal attack.
Nesutu Ntsheta, a spokesman for the newly formed Port Elizabeth
chapter of the Azanian National Youth Unity, charged that local mem
bers of the United Democratic Front, a multiracial coalition of anti
apartheid groups, were attacking his organization's members to prevent
the chapter's formal establishment at the end of this month.
United Democratic Front officials in Port Elizabeth, however, denied
any involvement in the violence, though they described the Azanian Na
tional Youth Unity group as "black supremacist," "splittist" and
"ultimately working for the (apartheid) system."
Iran launches offensive into Iraq
AMMAN, Jordan — Iranian troops crossed a key waterway in south
ern Iraq yesterday, apparently marking the start of a long-expected
Iranian offensive that could be the decisive battle in the 5-year-old Iran-
Iraq war.
A communique issued in Tehran last night said that Iranian forces
seized a "wide area of sensitive and strategic regions" west of the Shatt
al Arab estuary and that the territory remained under Iranian control.
Iraq said that its forces were counterattacking along a broad front in
the region north of the Iraqi city of Basra at the northern end of the Per
sian Gulf. But a communique issued in Baghdad acknowledged that the
Iranians had gained "a shaky foothold in some forward areas" of Iraqi
territory.
There was no independent confirmation of either side's report.
Western military analysts, speaking by telephone from Baghdad, said
the Iranian assault appeared to be the first wave of an expected major
Iranian offensive. The late winter is favored by the Iranians for attacks
because rainfall leaves the region of southern Iraq a quagmire that
makes it difficult for the Iraqis to use their superiority in tanks and other
armor to full advantage.
According to the analysts, the Iranians have massed 250,000 men on
the southern war front for several weeks. The apparent Iranian goal is to
threaten to cut Basra, Iraq's second largest city, from communication
with the rest of the country, which could destabilize the regime of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
Although the Iranian offense was turned back last year, the diplomats
said that the Iraniaas appeared to be far better prepared for the Iraqis in
the current offensive and said that the battle could be a close call for
either side.
Baghdad radio quoted a correspondent for the state-run Iraq News
Agency as saying the Iranians paid a "dear price" in the assault and Iraqi
forces were pursuing the remaining Iraniaas. The correspondent said
that bodies of the dead Iranian soldiers were floating in the waterway.
Scharansky to be freed in spy swap
BERLIN — U.S. officials confirmed yesterday that Anatoly
Shcharansky, the Soviet dissident will be in a group of people to be
freed today as part of an East-West spy exchange.
The transfer is expected to take place at the Glienicke Bridge, which
spans the Havel River between the American sector of West Berlin and
Potsdam in East Germany.
Shcharansky, 38, a Jewish dissident convicted as an agent of the CIA,
is reported to have arrived in East Berlin yesterday preparatory to the
exchange.
Richard Burt, the U.S. ambassador to West Germany, was in West
Berlin last night and is expected to take part in the exchange. It
reportedly will take place late today midway between the eastern and
western terminals of the bridge.
Wofgang Abel, an East German lawyer involved in the arrangements
for the Powers-Abel exchange, has also figured in the present arrange
ments and he too is expected to be on hand for the swap.
Soviet prosecutors charged him with passing information to Western
reporters about the Soviet defense industry, though no details were ever
made public. He was convicted in 1978 and sentenced to 13 years' im
prisonment.
According to West German sources, convicted spies from both sides
of the Iron Curtain are to be released in today's exchange. Except for
Shcharansky's. no names will be made public until after the operation is
completed, they said.

There was no independent confirmation of either side's report.
Western military analysts, speaking by telephone from Baghdad, said
the Iranian assault appeared to be the first wave of an expected major
Iranian offensive. The late winter is favored by the Iranians for attacks
because rainfall leaves the region of southern Iraq a quagmire that
makes it difficult for the Iraqis to use their superiority in tanks and other
armor to full advantage.
According to the analysts, the Iranians have massed 250,000 men on
the southern war front for several weeks. The apparent Iranian goal is to
threaten to cut Basra, Iraq's second largest city, from communication
with the rest of the country, which could destabilize the regime of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
Although the Iranian offense was turned back last year, the diplomats
said that the Iraniaas appeared to be far better prepared for the Iraqis in
the current offensive and said that the battle could be a close call for
either side.
Baghdad radio quoted a correspondent for the state-run Iraq News
Agency as saying the Iranians paid a "dear price" in the assault and Iraqi
forces were pursuing the remaining Iraniaas. The correspondent said
that bodies of the dead Iranian soldiers were floating in the waterway.
Scharansky to be freed in spy swap
BERLIN — U.S. officials confirmed yesterday that Anatoly
Shcharansky, the Soviet dissident will be in a group of people to be
freed today as part of an East-West spy exchange.
The transfer is expected to take place at the Glienicke Bridge, which
spans the Havel River between the American sector of West Berlin and
Potsdam in East Germany.
Shcharansky, 38, a Jewish dissident convicted as an agent of the CIA,
is reported to have arrived in East Berlin yesterday preparatory to the
exchange.
Richard Burt, the U.S. ambassador to West Germany, was in West
Berlin last night and is expected to take part in the exchange. It
reportedly will take place late today midway between the eastern and
western terminals of the bridge.
Wofgang Abel, an East German lawyer involved in the arrangements
for the Powers-Abel exchange, has also figured in the present arrange
ments and he too is expected to be on hand for the swap.
Soviet prosecutors charged him with passing information to Western
reporters about the Soviet defense industry, though no details were ever
made public. He was convicted in 1978 and sentenced to 13 years' im
prisonment.
According to West German sources, convicted spies from both sides
of the Iron Curtain are to be released in today's exchange. Except for
Shcharansky's. no names will be made public until after the operation is
completed, they said.
Haiti leader promises democracy
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, leader of
Haiti's provisional government, promised yesterday to work for the es
tablishment of a "genuine and functional democracy" with popular pres
idential elections.
Namphy called for a more just distribution of national wealth and for
"absolute respect for human rights."
In outlining the four-day-old government's program, Namphy
touched on many of the demands voiced in a wave of popular protests
that led to the downfall Friday of President Jean-Claude Duvalier.
Nevertheless, some Haitians who opposed Duvalier have criticized the
new government because many of its members were associated with the
old regime.
Namphy spoke at the installation yesterday of a new Cabinet. Among
the 13 Cabinet ministers taking office were at least five who had been
high officials under Duvalier.
Duvalier, 34, fled the country before dawn Friday, leaving power in
the hands of a five-member National Government Council. Namphy,
who was armed forces chief of staff under Duvalier, is president of the
council.
Other members include two army colonels and a former Duvalier
public works minister. A third colonel is the council's adviser.
A Haitian journalist with Radio Lumiere, an independent station
operated by Baptists, said yesterday that the reaction of people to the
new government was mixed.
"It is a government without Duvalier but Duvalierism is still there,"
said the journalist, who asked not to be identified by name. "People
want to avoid sparking another fire but to progressively eliminate
Duvalierism."
5 dead in S. African in-fighting
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The charred bodies of five black
men, their arms and legs bound tightly with thin wire, were found
outside Port Elizabeth yesterday on a smoldering pyre of gasoline
soaked tires, the apparent victims of renewed black political in-fighting
there.
The five, burned almost beyond recognition, were presumed to be
members of the small Azanian National Youth Unity group, two more of
whom were hacked with axes and machetes to death Saturday afternoon
in attacks by political rivals.
The seven deaths raised fears of renewed and murderous feuding
among black political groups. Such internecine clashes killed more than
60 blacks, mostly in the Port Elizabeth area.
"This is definitely the worst case we have ever had of this type of mass
killing," Lt. Col. Gerrie van Rooyen, a police spokesman, said in Port
Elizabeth. "You can be certain the killings will not end with this. There
will be reprisals and more reprisals until the whole black community is
virtually at war."
Police meanwhile reported the deaths of nine other blacks in the
country's continuing civil strife, now in its 18th month. Six were killed in
a faction fight between rival clans of Zulus south of Durban, where three
black policemen had been shot and then hacked to death Sunday.
The five blacks who were burned to death in Port Elizabeth's New
Brighton township were believed to have been among the more than 20
abducted Saturday, and police speculated they may have been tried as
government collaborators or perhaps as traitors to South Africa's black
revolution at a "people's court."
The fate of the others who were abducted over the weekend, some off
downtown streets in Port Elizabeth, is still unknown, and rumors circ
ulated wildly yesterday of an imminent reprisal attack.
Nesutu Ntsheta, a spokesman for the newly formed Port Elizabeth
chapter of the Azanian National Youth Unity, charged that local mem
bers of the United Democratic Front, a multiracial coalition of anti
apartheid groups, were attacking his organization's members to prevent
the chapter's formal establishment at the end of this month.
United Democratic Front officials in Port Elizabeth, however, denied
any involvement in the violence, though they described the Azanian Na
tional Youth Unity group as "black supremacist," "splittist" and
"ultimately working for the (apartheid) system."
Iran launches offensive into Iraq
AMMAN, Jordan — Iranian troops crossed a key waterway in south
ern Iraq yesterday, apparently marking the start of a long-expected
Iranian offensive that could be the decisive battle in the 5-year-old Iran-
Iraq war.
A communique issued in Tehran last night said that Iranian forces
seized a "wide area of sensitive and strategic regions" west of the Shatt
al Arab estuary and that the territory remained under Iranian control.
Iraq said that its forces were counterattacking along a broad front in
the region north of the Iraqi city of Basra at the northern end of the Per
sian Gulf. But a communique issued in Baghdad acknowledged that the
Iranians had gained "a shaky foothold in some forward areas" of Iraqi
territory.
There was no independent confirmation of either side's report.
