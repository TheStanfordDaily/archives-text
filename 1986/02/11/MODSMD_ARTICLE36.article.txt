# Philippine assembly begins count
## 
### 
MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine parlia
ment last night officially took over responsibility
for totaling presidential returns and declaring a
winner in a fraud-ridden race between President
Ferdinand Marcos and opposition candidate
Corazon Aquino.
The move by the Batasang Pambansa, or Na
tional Assembly, capped a day of mounting tension
in which one person was killed by sniper fire and
another wounded following an Aquino prayer rally.
An unknown gunman, apparently firing twice
from a building, killed a 20-year-old Aquino sup
porter, Arsenio Toribio, and grazed the forehead
of a woman, Lilibeth Quijano, 19, hospital authori
ties said. The two were riding with about 50 other
people on a flatbed truck used as a stage for
Aquino during the outdoor mass and prayer rally
an hour before, witnesses said. They said Toribio
was shot in the chest through a sign he was holding
that read, "Marcos Concede." Aquino by then was
far from the scene of the shooting.
"We are going to take power," Aquino said in a
speech at the prayer rally, attended by about 5,000
people in the business district of Makati. "The
people have won this election. The only question
left is when I should take power in their name."
She said that if Marcos succeeds in cheating her of
victory, "We must all fear the consequences."
A poll tally by an independent civic group, The
National Citizens Movement for Free Elections,
known as NAMFREL, put Aquino ahead early
today with 6.65 million votes to Marcos' 5.97 mil
lion votes, or about 53 percent to 47 percent with
66 percent of precincts reporting. In a separate
tally for the vice presidential race, Aquino's run
ning mate, Salvador Laurel, was leading with 6.43
million votes to 5.62 million for Marcos' running

mate Arturo Tolentino.
However, a count by the Commission on Elec
tions, or Comelec, the controversial Marcos
appointed body in charge of administering and ar
bitrating elections, had Marcos leading Aquino
narrowly by 3.81 million votes to 3.61 million, or
about 51 percent to 49 percent with 35 percent of
precincts reporting. It also had Tolentino leading
Laurel by 3.59 million votes to 3.46 million votes.
The Comelec count has been discredited by slow
returns and an employees' walk-out over alleged
falsification of results.
A crowd of at least 2,000 Aquino supporters
gathered outside the parliament building last night
for a vigil while the body conducts its count. They
chanted Aquino's nickname, Cory, and booed pro-
Marcos legislators. Riot police equipped with hel
mets, shields and batons, a truck-load of army
troops in combat gear and hundreds of plainclot
hesmen with revolvers bulging at their waistbands
stood ready to intervene.
Opposition and government sources said that the
system heavily favors Marcos, since his New Soci
ety Movement party controls two-thirds of the as
sembly, and challenges are to be settled by majority
vote.
Meanwhile, President Reagan, breaking Admin
istration silence on the Philippine presidential elec
tions, yesterday played down reports of fraud there
and said results so far prove that "there really is a
two-party system, obviously good" in the
Philippines.
Once a government is chosen, "we would like to
have the same relationship — historic relationship
— we've had with the people of the Philippines and
with their government," Reagan told The Wash
ington Post in an interview.
Reagan added, however, that he would reserve

judgment on the degree of fraud until he hears the
report today of a 20-member official observer
delegation headed by Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind).
The Reagan Administration, while expressing
concern about allegations of wholesale fraud in the
Philippine election, signaled that challenger
Corazon Aquino should accept the officially sanc
tioned results and work with the government of
Marcos, if he is declared the winner.
U.S. officials sidestepped questions about
whether corruption should invalidate the election.
Instead, they emphasized the need to avoid street
demonstrations — which Aquino has threatened —
and for both parties to work together.
The question is a tough one, officials said. On
one hand, observer teams including the one that
Reagan himself appointed have reported
widespread vote fraud on Marcos' behalf. On the
other hand, they say, a muddled outcome could dis
rupt Philippine stability, embolden the Communist
New People's Army and imperil the future of two
crucial U.S. bases there.
The Administration's statements yesterday were
aimed at encouraging Marcos to come to terms
with his surprisingly strong opposition and at dis
couraging Aquino from challenging the election
results in away that could disrupt the Philippines, a
strategically placed ally for the United States.
Before the election, Reagan had promised to
push for additional aid to the Philippines if the
elections were seen as free and fair, and officials
said then that Congress was likely to cut aid if they
weren't. White House spokesman Larry Speakes
declined to comment on aid yesterday, and State
Department spokesman Charles Redman said, "It
is simply too early to speculate on these kinds of
scenarios."

lion votes, or about 53 percent to 47 percent with
66 percent of precincts reporting. In a separate
tally for the vice presidential race, Aquino's run
ning mate, Salvador Laurel, was leading with 6.43
million votes to 5.62 million for Marcos' running

mate Arturo Tolentino.
However, a count by the Commission on Elec
tions, or Comelec, the controversial Marcos
appointed body in charge of administering and ar
bitrating elections, had Marcos leading Aquino
narrowly by 3.81 million votes to 3.61 million, or
about 51 percent to 49 percent with 35 percent of
precincts reporting. It also had Tolentino leading
Laurel by 3.59 million votes to 3.46 million votes.
The Comelec count has been discredited by slow
returns and an employees' walk-out over alleged
falsification of results.
A crowd of at least 2,000 Aquino supporters
gathered outside the parliament building last night
for a vigil while the body conducts its count. They
chanted Aquino's nickname, Cory, and booed pro-
Marcos legislators. Riot police equipped with hel
mets, shields and batons, a truck-load of army
troops in combat gear and hundreds of plainclot
hesmen with revolvers bulging at their waistbands
stood ready to intervene.
Opposition and government sources said that the
system heavily favors Marcos, since his New Soci
ety Movement party controls two-thirds of the as
sembly, and challenges are to be settled by majority
vote.
Meanwhile, President Reagan, breaking Admin
istration silence on the Philippine presidential elec
tions, yesterday played down reports of fraud there
and said results so far prove that "there really is a
two-party system, obviously good" in the
Philippines.
Once a government is chosen, "we would like to
have the same relationship — historic relationship
— we've had with the people of the Philippines and
with their government," Reagan told The Wash
ington Post in an interview.
Reagan added, however, that he would reserve

judgment on the degree of fraud until he hears the
report today of a 20-member official observer
delegation headed by Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind).
The Reagan Administration, while expressing
concern about allegations of wholesale fraud in the
Philippine election, signaled that challenger
Corazon Aquino should accept the officially sanc
tioned results and work with the government of
Marcos, if he is declared the winner.
U.S. officials sidestepped questions about
whether corruption should invalidate the election.
Instead, they emphasized the need to avoid street
demonstrations — which Aquino has threatened —
and for both parties to work together.
The question is a tough one, officials said. On
one hand, observer teams including the one that
Reagan himself appointed have reported
widespread vote fraud on Marcos' behalf. On the
other hand, they say, a muddled outcome could dis
rupt Philippine stability, embolden the Communist
New People's Army and imperil the future of two
crucial U.S. bases there.
The Administration's statements yesterday were
aimed at encouraging Marcos to come to terms
with his surprisingly strong opposition and at dis
couraging Aquino from challenging the election
results in away that could disrupt the Philippines, a
strategically placed ally for the United States.
Before the election, Reagan had promised to
push for additional aid to the Philippines if the
elections were seen as free and fair, and officials
said then that Congress was likely to cut aid if they
weren't. White House spokesman Larry Speakes
declined to comment on aid yesterday, and State
Department spokesman Charles Redman said, "It
is simply too early to speculate on these kinds of
scenarios."
MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine parlia
ment last night officially took over responsibility
for totaling presidential returns and declaring a
winner in a fraud-ridden race between President
Ferdinand Marcos and opposition candidate
Corazon Aquino.
The move by the Batasang Pambansa, or Na
tional Assembly, capped a day of mounting tension
in which one person was killed by sniper fire and
another wounded following an Aquino prayer rally.
An unknown gunman, apparently firing twice
from a building, killed a 20-year-old Aquino sup
porter, Arsenio Toribio, and grazed the forehead
of a woman, Lilibeth Quijano, 19, hospital authori
ties said. The two were riding with about 50 other
people on a flatbed truck used as a stage for
Aquino during the outdoor mass and prayer rally
an hour before, witnesses said. They said Toribio
was shot in the chest through a sign he was holding
that read, "Marcos Concede." Aquino by then was
far from the scene of the shooting.
"We are going to take power," Aquino said in a
speech at the prayer rally, attended by about 5,000
people in the business district of Makati. "The
people have won this election. The only question
left is when I should take power in their name."
She said that if Marcos succeeds in cheating her of
victory, "We must all fear the consequences."
A poll tally by an independent civic group, The
National Citizens Movement for Free Elections,
known as NAMFREL, put Aquino ahead early
today with 6.65 million votes to Marcos' 5.97 mil
lion votes, or about 53 percent to 47 percent with
66 percent of precincts reporting. In a separate
tally for the vice presidential race, Aquino's run
ning mate, Salvador Laurel, was leading with 6.43
