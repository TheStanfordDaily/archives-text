# NASA considers unmanned space shots

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. —
The space agency's goal of total
reliance on the shuttle for all space
operations by 1988 is unsafe and
must be abandoned if the nation is to
have a reliable space transportation
program, several senior space agency
safety advisers now say.
In interviews over the past several
days, seven of the outside advisers,
who sit on the 13-member Aerospace
Safety Advisory Panel, said the Na
tional Aeronautics and Space Admin
istration should turn to unmanned,
disposable rockets to put many of its
payloads in orbit and send spacecraft
into deep space.
The panel members — aviation and
aerospace veterans — said NASA's
launch schedule problems, which had
already become severe well before
the Jan. 28 Challenger tragedy, can
not be solved by relying on the shuttle
alone.
"I really think they must look hard

at expendable launch vehicles," said
John Stewart, a panel member.
"Everybody needs to take a deep
breath, swallow their pride and look
again."
"It would have been correct and
sensible to retain a certain number of
(unmanned) rockets," said panel
member Seymour Himmel. "It would
have been better than using a still
developmental orbiter."
Added Stewart, "Don't put people
at risk just to put a routine communi
cations satellite into orbit. In fact, I
think they would have a much better
manned schedule if they did not have
this terrible shuttle schedule."
NASA scheduled 15 shuttle flights
for 1986, 19 in 1987, and 24 a year
into the 19905. But not one member
of the safety panel, which was set up
after the 1967 Apollo capsule fire
killed three astronauts, believes such
a schedule is possible.
The panel has repeatedly cautioned

that it regards the complex shuttle
system as an experimental vehicle un
suited to routine operations.
NASA has set five unmanned
rocket launches for this year, and four
in 1987. "After that, everything goes
on the shuttle," said agency spokes
man Hugh Harris.
The views of the safety panel are
becoming the focus of increasing in
terest as the investigation in the
causes of the Challenger disaster gets
under way.
Panel member John McDonald, an
aviation consultant, said that
"cannibalization" of spare parts from
one orbiter to prepare another for
flight is "a very difficult problem. It is
a small fleet, and impossible (for
NASA officials) to hold the kind of
unlimited inventory of spare parts
they'd like."
NASA decided in the mid-'7os to
turn away from unmanned rockets, in
part because shuttle cost overruns

forced the agency to concentrate on
the reusable orbiter system. But the
debate has simmered for years, and
seems likely to boil again as the
agency's operations come under
scrutiny from Congress and the
Reagan Administration.
Panelist Richard Battin, of the
Charles Stark Draper Laboratory in
Cambridge, Mass., a strong backer of
the shuttle program, said it is his
opinion that "one should not put all
the eggs in one basket. Even Aesop
knew that."
Battin, who was a principal mathe
matician for the Apollo voyages to
the moon, said he strongly favors
building a fifth orbiter.
Said Stewart, an executive of the
Tennessee Valley Authority, "I think
the idea of building a fifth orbiter
deserves very careful study. You
could reopen a lot of expendable
launch vehicle production lines for
that $2 billion orbiter pricetag."
