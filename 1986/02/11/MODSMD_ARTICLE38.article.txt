Tax breaks not effective
WASHINGTON — Five years ago President
Reagan and Congress agreed on a bundle of busi
ness tax breaks designed to promote industrial
expansion, but many major companies that
reaped huge benefits from the 1981 changes ac
tually cut back spending on new jobs and fac
tories, a labor-backed tax reform group charged
yesterday.
Instead of pouring more money into new
plants and equipment, many large companies
spent the tax savings on stock dividends and cor
porate buyouts, the group. Citizens for Tax
Justice, concluded after a survey of 259 Fortune
500 companies.
The analysis, based on corporate annual
reports and other public data, concluded that
corporate income-tax incentives and other
breaks cost the Treasury $120 billion in lost
income-tax revenues annually.
But the breaks failed to trigger the investment

and job booms promised when the tax changes
were enacted, the report said. Among 44
profitable companies that used the tax breaks to
avoid paying any federal income taxes from 1981
to 1984, for example, total investment spending
was 4 percent lower in 1984 than in 1981, and
overall employment was down 6 percent, the
study found.
Chin claims no regrets
WASHINGTON — Larry Wu-Tai Chin, the
former CI A analyst convicted last week of spying
for China for 30 years, described himself yester
day as "a patriotic American" who had no
regrets about handing over classified information
because he believed that he had helped "bring
about the conversion of China from an enemy to
a sworn ally."
Chin, a Chinese translator with the ClA's

Foreign Broadcast Information Service until his
retirement in 1981, told the court that he had
given the Chinese secret information as part of a
personal "mission" to lessen hostility between
the two countries.
He faces a maximum of two life sentences and
83 additional years in prison as well as more than
$3 million in fines as a result of his conviction on
espionage, conspiracy, income tax and financial
reporting laws.
Dow Jones rises again
NEW YORK — Stock prices rose strongly

1,626.38, as a late surge triggered by a drop in in
terest rates nearly doubled early gains.
