US busts LA drug ring
LOS ANGELES — A suspected money laun
dering ring for drug deals was cracked with the
seizure of more than $11.6 million in cash, $20
million worth of cocaine, and the arrest of five
South American men, authorities said yesterday.
The ring was infiltrated by undercover agents
who said the men were able to subvert federaj
currency transaction laws because they had con
nections with a corrupt banker, whom authorities
declined to identify.
Financial institutions also helped by reporting
the unusually large deposits to federal agents,
said U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner. He would not
disclose the names of the banks which
cooperated in the case, and said no more arrests
were anticipated.
The money "represents the largest collective
seizure of cash ever in a single coordinated drug
case," Bonner said at a news conference to an
nounce the arrests. Agents also seized 254
pounds of cocaine.
The five men allegedly operated a money laun
dering organization that received millions of dol
lars from drug deals, according to affidavits filed
in the case. Bonner said the ring made sure the
money got back to international drug cartels.

Dannemeyer quits race
SANTA ANA, — Citing money problems.
Rep. William Dannemeyer, whose controversial
statements on AIDS attracted national attention,
dropped out of the race yesterday for the Repub
lican nomination for the U.S. Senate.
In other developments in the crowded Senate
race, Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike An
tonovich and Assemblyman Bob Naylor of
Menlo Park shared honors as the first
Republicans to formally file papers entering the
race, and Naylor called on Sen. Ed Davis and
Rep. Bobbi Fiedler to both withdraw from the
Senate race "for the good of the party."
Naylor said the indictment of Fiedler for al
legedly offering a bribe to Davis to withdraw
from the race has wounded both politically, as
well as the party, and they both should withdraw
because neither has a realistic chance of defeat
ing Democratic incumbent Alan Cranston.
Dannemeyer said he was quitting the race be
cause he couldn't raise the $2 million he esti
mated would be necessary to conduct a successful
campaign.
The crowded GOP Senate field also hurt his
ability to raise money, the t ullerton Republican
said.

Sebastiani changes race
SACRAMENTO — Winemaker Don Sebas
tiani abandoned his campaign for lieutenant
governor yesterday and entered the race for state
controller with a charge that there are "grave
suspicions of.. . malfeasance in office" by Dem
ocratic incumbent Ken Cory.
Sebastiani cited news accounts of Cory's ap
pointments of political friends to lucrative in
heritance tax appraiser posts.
Cory's spokesman, John Chen, issued a brief
statement saying Sebastiani's remarks were "a
pretty low-level attack."
As an example, Fair Political Practices Com
mission Dan Stanford said, "While President
Reagan and Gov. Deukmejian were supporting a
Martin Luther King holiday, Don voted against a
Martin Luther King resolution and said Dr. King
was a man of questionable motives and question
able associates."
Today's weather
The skies over Stanford will be partly cloudy
today. Cloudiness will increase tonight, as the
high of 58 will fall to a low of around 40.
