# Cosby says no; is Koppel next?

### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
Bill Cosby will not speak at Com
mencement.
The senior class presidents asked
University President Donald Ken
nedy to invite Cosby last week after
an informal poll indicated the com
edian was the first choice among
some seniors.
However, Cosby is already booked
to perform at the Playboy Jazz Fes
tival in Los Angeles on June 15. the
day of Stanford's Commencement,
according to Cosby spokesperson
Julie Phillips.
Senior Class President Patrick
Shannon said "it stands to reason"
that an invitation will now go to
"Nightline" anchorman Ted Koppel,
who finished just behind Cosby and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in a
poll conducted by the senior class
presidents in the fall.
Kennedy, however, declined to say
who will be considered next, com
plaining that publicity surrounding
possible invitations to Gorbachev and
Cosby has put the University in a dif
ficult position.

"I'm afraid this thing (an invitation
to speak) is going to get cold," Ken
nedy said. "Nobody wants to be con
sidered the second or third choice."
A "Nightline" spokeswoman said
yesterday that she did not know if
Koppel had heard from Stanford, but
added that the late-night newsman is
interested in speaking here because
both he and his wife are Stanford
alumni.
Other speakers believed to be
among those under consideration are
President Reagan and former CBS
anchorman Walter Cronkite.
The senior class presidents last
week invited Gorbachev to speak at
Commencement, but left open the
opportunity for him to speak at an
other time if the proposed Reagan-
Gorbachev summit does not occur in
June, as originally planned.
A cover letter from Kennedy
seemed to endorse the seniors' invita
tion but did not specifically refer to
Commencement. However, Univer
sity spokesmen later said Gorbachev
had been issued only an "open invita-
tion," and had not been invited
to speak at Commencement.
A spokesman at the Soviet
Consulate in San Fr-ncisco said
yesterday that it is still too early
to tell if a Gorbachev visit to
the United States would
coincide with the June 15 cere
mony, but said the Soviets will
take the Stanford invitation
seriously.
In recent years, Stanford has
shown a preference for
speakers with ties to the Uni
versity. Rockefeller Founda
tion President Richard Lyman
(1984) was Kennedy's
predecessor as University pres
ident; Secretary of State
George Shultz (1983) is on
leave from a part-time teaching
position at the Stanford
Graduate School of Business;
Supreme Court Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor (1982) is a
Stanford alumna; and former
Deputy Secretary of State War
ren Christopher (1981) is now
president of Stanford's Board
of Trustees.
As a Stanford alumnus, Kop
pel would fit that bill, while
Cosby would have been an un
usual choice in that he is in
volved in entertainment, not
politics, and apparently has no
ties to the University.
Cosby spoke at several
graduation ceremonies last
year, and will speak at Spell
man College and at Meharry
Medical College.
