yesterday from Nankai University in China to
prepare for tonight's production of the Chinese
play 'â€¢Thunderstorm."
"Thunderstorm," a play written by Tsao Yu,

currently the chairman of Chinese languages for
China's university system, will be held in Ster
ling Quad at 8 p.m.
The "Thunderstorm" theater troupe arrived
in the United States Jan. 18 and toured nine
Minnesota college campuses before it arrived at
Stanford. The group will depart for China Feb.
13.
The vice president, Wang Da Sui, declared at
an East House reception yesterday that the
troupe's visit to Stanford has "everything to do
with the 'open door policy' " that Premier Deng

Xiaoping has championed in the People's
Republic for the last 10 years.
China's ministries of culture and education
encouraged Nankai University in planning the
troupe's visit, according to Wang. The govern
ment support reflects China's growing desire to
dissolve "great cultural misunderstandings" be
tween China and the United States, he said.
"The significance of cultural exchange is far
greater than any technological exchange," he
said.
According to Wang, the troupe's tour is the

first ever of its kind. He said he does not know
of any other amateur group from China touring
the states since the Cultural Revolution in the
19605.
Roland Fischer, an American faculty member
of the foreign languages department at Nankai
and the originator of the "Thunderstorm" proj
ect, said the project illustrates "significant at
titudinal changes in China" and is "more than
just a casual university tour."
