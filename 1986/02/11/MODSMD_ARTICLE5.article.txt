### STEVE STREED Staff writer 
The vice president, two professors and a
troupe of 10 student actors arrived at Stanford

P 0 sty r 0

yesterday from Nankai University in China to
prepare for tonight's production of the Chinese
play '•Thunderstorm."
"Thunderstorm," a play written by Tsao Yu,

currently the chairman of Chinese languages for
China's university system, will be held in Ster
ling Quad at 8 p.m.
The "Thunderstorm" theater troupe arrived
in the United States Jan. 18 and toured nine
Minnesota college campuses before it arrived at
Stanford. The group will depart for China Feb.
13.
The vice president, Wang Da Sui, declared at
an East House reception yesterday that the
troupe's visit to Stanford has "everything to do
with the 'open door policy' " that Premier Deng

Xiaoping has championed in the People's
Republic for the last 10 years.
China's ministries of culture and education
encouraged Nankai University in planning the
troupe's visit, according to Wang. The govern
ment support reflects China's growing desire to
dissolve "great cultural misunderstandings" be
tween China and the United States, he said.
"The significance of cultural exchange is far
greater than any technological exchange," he
said.
According to Wang, the troupe's tour is the

first ever of its kind. He said he does not know
of any other amateur group from China touring
the states since the Cultural Revolution in the
19605.
Roland Fischer, an American faculty member
of the foreign languages department at Nankai
and the originator of the "Thunderstorm" proj
ect, said the project illustrates "significant at
titudinal changes in China" and is "more than
just a casual university tour."
"This is a first," Fischer said. "If
you put the group's visit in a picture, I
think you can see that this is an iden
tification of what will start to happen
in the future .. . more students are
going to have this experience and the
door (for Sino-American inter
change) is going to be opened a little
bit wider," he said.
The purpose of performing the play
is "to share some of China" with
Americans, Fischer said. It is apropos
that "Thunderstorm" was chosen for
the tour since the play illustrates uni
versal conflicts that have to do with
family structure, he said.
"Even Americans have these
familial problems . . . (and by watch
ing the play) they can learn some
thing about themselves as well as
China," he said.
Wang Guo Wen, a member of the
troupe, said the play will "give the
people (watching it) a small window
to Chinese culture."
Liu Yan, the troupe's stage
manager, said she thinks China's
"open door" policy "is a very wise
policy" because China needs to be in
troduced to foreign science and tech
nology, she said.
Wang Shao Yung, another troupe
member, said China can learn from
U.S. technological advances.
The greatest challenge facing
China today is to stabilize population
growth, Wang Guo Wen said. He
disagreed with the posture that
Steven Mosher, a former Stanford
doctoral candidate in anthropology,
had taken toward birth control in
China, saying Chinese birth control
policies are both effective and
reasonable.
Mosher, the author of "The Bro
ken Earth," a controversial book
about birth control in China, was ex
pelled from China as a result of his
work and denied a Ph.D. from the
University.
Most of the members of the Nankai
group said they are favorably im
pressed with the hospitality they have
received so far from their hosts in
Minnesota and Stanford. "In Ameri
can films we get the impression that
Americans are cold," said troupe
member Wang Shao Yung. But, "In
America everyone is so friendly," he
said.
The visitors were to sleep at East
House last night, Fischer said.
