Saying that only apathy stands between the po
tential of television and what is now broadcast.
Rep. Timothy Wirth ( D-Colo.) last night called on
Stanford to create a national center for research on
television and society.
The proposed center would study the effects of
television on society, including areas such as
children's television and media coverage of politics
and international terrorism, according to Wirth,
who recently declared his candidacy for the Senate
seat now held by Gary Hart.
Wirth. chairman of the House Subcommittee on
Telecommunications, Consumer Products and
Finance, was the featured speaker at the Depart
ment of Communication's annual Carlos
McClatchy lecture, which was held in the Psychol

ogy Building. The founder of the Fresno Bee,
McClatchy earned a reputation as a hard-hitting
journalist and editor.
"We must now move to make the most of the
medium. . . . The wasteland can be cultivated,"
said Wirth, who received a doctorate from Stan
ford's School of Education.
"This is the perfect place to do it,"he said. "No
other place in the country is doing it, I think."
He noted that the University is surrounded by
academic resources and features an excellent Com
munication Department.
Wirth's speech, "The Television Environment:
Cultivating the Wasteland," lamented the state of
commercial children's television in the country
today.
The gap between the potential of television and
what it now provides viewers is "deepest in the
field of children's television," Wirth said, noting

that television has the potential to simultaneously
educate and entertain children.
The Saturday morning line-up of children's car
toons is now inundated by "the program-length
commercial," Wirth said, pointing out the shows
such as "He-Man and the Masters of the Universe"
are specifically designed to sell a product. "A com
mercial by any other name is still a commerical."
Shows of this type are designed "to enrich the
toymakers," he said.
The sixth-teim congressman also deplored vio
lence on children's programs, stating that cartoons
"dished up the heaviest frequency of violent acts
per hour" for all television shows.
Wirth has proposed a measure in the House that
would require broadcasters to present at least one
hour of programming designed to entertain and ed
ucate children.
