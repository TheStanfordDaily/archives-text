# Tax reform plan concerns universities
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
This is the second in a series of articles focus
ing on the effects of recent federal tax legislation
on the University.
Non-profit institutions around the country
are greatly concerned about elements of the Tax
Reform Act of 1985 (HR 3838) that will
restrict the ability of these organizations to
access tax-exempt bond financing.
Components of the bill passed by the U.S.
House of Representatives on Dec. 17 would
place private colleges under an institutional cap
of $ 150 million of outstanding debt. Institutions
would also be constrained by a ceiling on the ag
gregate dollar amount of non-governmental
bonds issued annually by individual states.
The apparent inequity of the proposal has
also raised controversy, as public colleges and
universities would continue to be able to issue
tax-exempt bonds under existing criteria.
The limitations approved by the House and
now under consideration in the Senate would
seriously impair Stanford's ability to raise
much-needed funds for necessary capital im
provements, according to Harry Turner, Uni
versity deputy treasurer.
"The limitations they are putting in now are
inequitable and would do real damage to Stan
ford's ability to provide new facilities in
response to our need to stay modern and at the
leading edge of technology and academic enter
prise," Turner said.
Because Stanford is considered a non-profit
institution under existing federal standards, the
University is allowed to issue tax-exempt bonds.
These bonds, sold primarily in the public bond
market to individuals and mutual funds, are
considered advantageous by some investors be
cause the interest on the bond is not taxed as
personal income.

Non-profit institutions also consider tax
exempt bond financing because the interest
rates paid to the bond buyer are from 2 to 4 per
cent less than those of the taxable bond market.
When authorizing bond financing, Stanford
effectively "sells" a note to a buyer, with the
proceeds being the equivalent of a large cash
loan. In offering the bond, the University prom
ises to repay the principal, or buyer's cost, plus a
stated interest rate within a fixed schedule.
Unlike bonds issued by UC-Berkeley and
other governmental entities, bonds for private
institutions are issued through the California
Educational Facilities Authority, a state agency
that acts as a "conduit" between the University
and the lender, Turner said.
University bonds are underwritten by L.F.
Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin, an investment
banking firm that gives the University financial
advice and organizes the syndicate of invest
ment bankers who actually purchase the Stan
ford bonds. According to Turner, the cost of un
derwriting, marketing and financial advice
amounts to less than 2 percent of the issue
amount.
The University Board of Trustees authorizes
the amount and projects to be financed with
bonds in close cooperation with the Treasurer's
Office, Rothschild and other University depart
ments, including the legal and controller's
offices.
The proceeds of assuming tax-exempt debt
through the selling of bonds are used by the
University to help finance of construction of
long-life facilities such as academic buildings
and plant improvements, Turner said.
Stanford relies heavily on tax-exempt bonds
because of the increasing difficulty in obtaining
money from other sources. Real-dollar con
struction costs have increased at the same time
real-dollar donations have decreased, and
private donors are often reluctant to give to

large facilities projects.
Stanford's outstanding tax-exempt debt for
educational facilities currently totals approxi
mately $260 million. Turner said.
Stanford issued a record $ 100 million in tax
exempt debt in December alone, partly in a
conscious effort to "pre-fund" more facilities
than usual in anticipation of new restrictions.
Turner said.
The proceeds of the December issue include
approximately $20 million for construction of
new graduate student housing and $ 19.5 million
to help finance the second phase of the $250
million New West Campus redevelopment.
Additional proceeds include $10 million to
help finance construction of a $17.5 addition to
the Graduate School of Business, $10 million
for the Center for Molecular and Genetic
Medicine, a $51 million project slated to begin
this July, $11.5 million for the $17 million
second stage of the Research Animal Facility
and approximately $ 1 million for the new Am
bulatory Surgical Center.
The current tax reform measure places Cali
fornia under a tax-exempt bond cap limiting the
amount of debt to $150 per resident. This for
mula would effectively limit California to $3.3
billion in tax-exempt debt in addition to the
$150 million limit applied to individual institu
tions.
According to Turner, the state cap would
force a priority contest among institutions vying
for shares of the limited total at the state level.
"The result (of the state cap) would be that
Stanford and higher education would be put
into inappropriate competition at the state level
with the politicians for all the other state and
municipal uses of tax-exempt debt," Turner
said.
The institutional cap would immediately af
fect several California colleges and universities,
including Stanford and USC, which rely heavily

on tax-exempt bond financing. This cap particu
larly impairs the ability of these large, private
institutions to issue tax-exempt debt. Turner
said.
"It discriminates against private higher edu
cation because public universities like UC-
Berkeley will continue to have a tax advantage,
(and) it doesn't recognize that the amount of
debt that might seem large to a small institution
may just seem an appropriate size to a large in
stitution," Turner said. "Large private univer
sities, regardless of their need or quality, will be
subjected to damaging discrimination."
The effects of the institutional cap would also
be felt by colleges and universities that do not
compose a significant share of the tax-exempt
bond market. In 1983, California became the
first state in the nation to engage in "pooled"
financing for equipment and facilities using tax
exempt bonds.
Pooled financing allows small colleges to
access credit markets by joining larger institu
tions in a group bond issue. Pooled bonds are a
necessity to small colleges because of the prohi
bitive costs of issuing small, stand-alone bonds
in amounts of $5 million or less. The small col
leges rely on the good credit ratings of USC and
Stanford to minimize costs, Turner said.
According to Turner, pooled bonds con
stituted about $20 million of Stanford's $100
million December issue. "We did exercise a
little 'statesmanship' for the benefit of higher
education by facilitating their ability to get that
debt and get into the market/' Turner said.
According to the Association of Independent
California Colleges and Universities, the exclu
sion of large institutions such as Stanford and
USC from the tax-exempt bond market would
diminish the quality of the existing market pool,
jeopardizing the ability of small colleges such as
Scripps, Mills and Pomona to assume tax
exempt debt.

on tax-exempt bond financing. This cap particu
larly impairs the ability of these large, private
institutions to issue tax-exempt debt. Turner
said.
"It discriminates against private higher edu
cation because public universities like UC-
Berkeley will continue to have a tax advantage,
(and) it doesn't recognize that the amount of
debt that might seem large to a small institution
may just seem an appropriate size to a large in
stitution," Turner said. "Large private univer
sities, regardless of their need or quality, will be
subjected to damaging discrimination."
The effects of the institutional cap would also
be felt by colleges and universities that do not
compose a significant share of the tax-exempt
bond market. In 1983, California became the
first state in the nation to engage in "pooled"
financing for equipment and facilities using tax
exempt bonds.
Pooled financing allows small colleges to
access credit markets by joining larger institu
tions in a group bond issue. Pooled bonds are a
necessity to small colleges because of the prohi
bitive costs of issuing small, stand-alone bonds
in amounts of $5 million or less. The small col
leges rely on the good credit ratings of USC and
Stanford to minimize costs, Turner said.
According to Turner, pooled bonds con
stituted about $20 million of Stanford's $100
million December issue. "We did exercise a
little 'statesmanship' for the benefit of higher
education by facilitating their ability to get that
debt and get into the market/' Turner said.
According to the Association of Independent
California Colleges and Universities, the exclu
sion of large institutions such as Stanford and
USC from the tax-exempt bond market would
diminish the quality of the existing market pool,
jeopardizing the ability of small colleges such as
Scripps, Mills and Pomona to assume tax
exempt debt.
This is the second in a series of articles focus
ing on the effects of recent federal tax legislation
on the University.
Non-profit institutions around the country
are greatly concerned about elements of the Tax
Reform Act of 1985 (HR 3838) that will
restrict the ability of these organizations to
access tax-exempt bond financing.
Components of the bill passed by the U.S.
House of Representatives on Dec. 17 would
place private colleges under an institutional cap
of $ 150 million of outstanding debt. Institutions
would also be constrained by a ceiling on the ag
gregate dollar amount of non-governmental
bonds issued annually by individual states.
The apparent inequity of the proposal has
also raised controversy, as public colleges and
universities would continue to be able to issue
tax-exempt bonds under existing criteria.
The limitations approved by the House and
now under consideration in the Senate would
seriously impair Stanford's ability to raise
much-needed funds for necessary capital im
provements, according to Harry Turner, Uni
versity deputy treasurer.
"The limitations they are putting in now are
inequitable and would do real damage to Stan
ford's ability to provide new facilities in
response to our need to stay modern and at the
leading edge of technology and academic enter
prise," Turner said.
Because Stanford is considered a non-profit
institution under existing federal standards, the
University is allowed to issue tax-exempt bonds.
These bonds, sold primarily in the public bond
market to individuals and mutual funds, are
considered advantageous by some investors be
cause the interest on the bond is not taxed as
personal income.

Non-profit institutions also consider tax
exempt bond financing because the interest
rates paid to the bond buyer are from 2 to 4 per
cent less than those of the taxable bond market.
When authorizing bond financing, Stanford
effectively "sells" a note to a buyer, with the
proceeds being the equivalent of a large cash
loan. In offering the bond, the University prom
ises to repay the principal, or buyer's cost, plus a
stated interest rate within a fixed schedule.
Unlike bonds issued by UC-Berkeley and
other governmental entities, bonds for private
institutions are issued through the California
Educational Facilities Authority, a state agency
that acts as a "conduit" between the University
and the lender, Turner said.
University bonds are underwritten by L.F.
Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin, an investment
banking firm that gives the University financial
advice and organizes the syndicate of invest
ment bankers who actually purchase the Stan
ford bonds. According to Turner, the cost of un
derwriting, marketing and financial advice
amounts to less than 2 percent of the issue
amount.
The University Board of Trustees authorizes
the amount and projects to be financed with
bonds in close cooperation with the Treasurer's
Office, Rothschild and other University depart
ments, including the legal and controller's
offices.
The proceeds of assuming tax-exempt debt
through the selling of bonds are used by the
University to help finance of construction of
long-life facilities such as academic buildings
and plant improvements, Turner said.
Stanford relies heavily on tax-exempt bonds
because of the increasing difficulty in obtaining
money from other sources. Real-dollar con
struction costs have increased at the same time
real-dollar donations have decreased, and
private donors are often reluctant to give to

large facilities projects.
Stanford's outstanding tax-exempt debt for
educational facilities currently totals approxi
mately $260 million. Turner said.
Stanford issued a record $ 100 million in tax
exempt debt in December alone, partly in a
conscious effort to "pre-fund" more facilities
than usual in anticipation of new restrictions.
Turner said.
The proceeds of the December issue include
approximately $20 million for construction of
new graduate student housing and $ 19.5 million
to help finance the second phase of the $250
million New West Campus redevelopment.
Additional proceeds include $10 million to
help finance construction of a $17.5 addition to
the Graduate School of Business, $10 million
for the Center for Molecular and Genetic
Medicine, a $51 million project slated to begin
this July, $11.5 million for the $17 million
second stage of the Research Animal Facility
and approximately $ 1 million for the new Am
bulatory Surgical Center.
The current tax reform measure places Cali
fornia under a tax-exempt bond cap limiting the
amount of debt to $150 per resident. This for
mula would effectively limit California to $3.3
billion in tax-exempt debt in addition to the
$150 million limit applied to individual institu
tions.
According to Turner, the state cap would
force a priority contest among institutions vying
for shares of the limited total at the state level.
"The result (of the state cap) would be that
Stanford and higher education would be put
into inappropriate competition at the state level
with the politicians for all the other state and
municipal uses of tax-exempt debt," Turner
said.
The institutional cap would immediately af
fect several California colleges and universities,
including Stanford and USC, which rely heavily

on tax-exempt bond financing. This cap particu
larly impairs the ability of these large, private
institutions to issue tax-exempt debt. Turner
