A group of Stanford professors yesterday unveiled
the preliminary results of a study indicating that
growth and nutrition deficiencies among Mexican-
American children are linked to the poverty of their
families.
Reynaldo Martorell, associate professor at the Food
Research Institute, said the study is unique because it
marks the first time since public health surveys began
in the early 1960s that the specific health needs of
Hispanic populations have been addressed.
We ve suspected that there are important problems
with health and nutrition in the Mexican-American
population, but it's been really hard to be specific be
cause up to now there haven't been these kinds of
studies," Martorell said.
Martorell worked with Fernando Mendoza and
Ricardo Castillo, both assistant professors of pediatrics
at Stanford Medical School, to compare the results of
their survey with older data from the U.S. Center for
Health Statistics.
The researchers found that there was a "short-and
plump syndrome" among Mexican-American children
from economically deprived backgrounds, with these
children typically being shorter and more overweight
than their counterparts from wealthier families, ac
cording to Martorell.
They also found that poor Mexican-American re
spondents had higher levels of iron deficiency.
