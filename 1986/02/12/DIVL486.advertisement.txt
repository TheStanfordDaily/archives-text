PROGRAM BOARD
Traditionally, the Program Board has not been given
the best of press. A quick review of the ASSU News
Archives points up this unfortunate image problem.
"A sickly sea-gernsey cow heffling its vomit" noted
the Pirate News, labelling its members . .ego quaffing
land dicks." Faint Praise. A "Fire-Spitting, Venom
Dripping (Beast)" berated the November 13th issue;
"The Grinch Who Stole Everything" proclaimed the
Christmas issue. Analysts with a sharp eye for trends
suggest that the Program Board and its members are
not very popular, and indeed that they aren't even
very nice to be around and are by no means the kind
of people that you'd want to take fishing on Labor Day
Weekend.
It doesn't have to be that way. The Program Board
needs a director, a deputy director, and six members
who never to themselves have said "Boy, I'd sure like
to make well-meaning students squirm. That would
just make my day!" A good program board that wants
to support student initiative and get things going could
be so mind-bogglingly wildly exciting that I can hardly
stand it. Think about it. Directors and Deputies apply
to the ASSU, members apply to the Nominations
Commission. Let's get these folks some better press,
and get student groups a rip-roaring advocate. Now
more than ever.
NOM COM
There is an interesting thing about the Nomination's
Commission that sets it apart from a great many things
here at the ASSU. The Nominations Commission is
important. Case in point: were you to ask a random
person in the administration what things of value or
consequence the ASSU accomplishes, those who did
not reply "nothing" would most likely say "the Nomi
nations Commission." Why? NomCom (as all the hep
folks call it) puts students onto University Committees,
everything from the Committee on How To Gouge the Stu
dents Even More Somehow to the Task Force on Just How
Many Buildings Can We Cram Into Any Given Space. As
you can probably imagine, the potential for doing
things of Great Worth are almost limitless. Wield
power. Meet people. Know things. Be the Chair, or be
a member. Maybe Don Kennedy will take you to
Naugles.
PUBLICATIONS BOARD
The Publications Board is the best-kept secret on
campus. Really, I know. I went to one of their meet
ings once. It's like this: because of their name, every
body thinks that the publications board does things
like, you know, help student groups put out
magazines and leaflets and newspapers and things like
that. Nothing could be farther from the truth! They
just use that respectable image as a front. I watched
from the window. The director, wrapped in blood-red
robes, lifted an ivory chalice to his lips and chanted a
toast to the Tri-Lateral Commission as eye-rolling,
pom-pom wielding redheads in leather jerkins writhed
on the floor to the swelling strains of Inna Godda
Davida. There were lights you could taste, sounds you
could touch and . . . well, I've said too much already.
Apply to be director, right away. Just don't tell them
you know. It'll be our little secret.
