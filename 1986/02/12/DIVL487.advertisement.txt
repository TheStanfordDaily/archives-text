## EXTRA!
Hullo. Welcome to this special edition of the ASSU News.
On second thought, fuck off. I don't want you to read this
page. Really.
Why are you still reading? I'm not joking. Go away.
This is a special edition. It's hiring time at the ASSU, and
we've got to advertise all our openings. But you're probably
not qualified. In fact, I'm almost certain you couldn't get
any of these jobs, many of which have salaries, as I might
mention just to make you want the jobs you can't have that
much more. If you were qualified, and I'm not suggesting for
a moment that you are, you could come to the ASSU offices
and pick up an application. But we wouldn't hire you any
way, so don't bother.
FRIENDS AND HELPERS
Don't read this story 'till right before you go to bed. It'll
scare the shit out of you.
My Great-Grandfather told this to me right after he died:
Once upon a time in Nutville Manor, the forest creatures
experienced a severe shortage of forest consumables. (My
great-grandfather was an economist. I liked him anyway.)
Particularly hard-hit was Nutley Squirrel, the Mayor and
head Tree-Climber of the Major. Having buried his entire
nut cache in a merchant marine ship that soon sailed for
Krakatoa, he had no way of ever retrieving that initial nut
deposit. Consequently, Nutley became so peeved that he got
into his nut-powered Squirrelmobile and ran over all the
other citizens of Nutville Manor.
The moral of the story is that, if there had been a Friends
& Helpers (a truly fantastic organization whose volunteers
help the older members of our community with tasks like
shopping, gardening, etc.) affiliate in Nutville Manor, there
never wouldnt've been a forest consumable shortage in the
first place.
My Great-Grand-Father has been dead sometime now,
and doesn't tell this story as frequently. If you become Di
rector of Deputy of this fine organization, maybe he'll never
tell it again.
SPEAKERS BUREAU
Can you articulate the human language? Can you speak?
Are you good at recognizing this quality in other people?
Then you have the potential to become the Director of the
Speakers Bureau. It is a proven fact that people who know
how to talk make more money, on the average, than those
you don't. If you recognize this, you have the potential to
become the Bureau's Business Manager. (This years Biz
Manager received over $50,000 in kickbacks. He can speak
real well.)
Also, if you become Director of the Bureau, you get to
nominate 4 to 8 people to serve as members. Think about
that â€” if you nominated Mikhail Gorbachev, Ronald Re
agan, Martin Sheen, and Twiggy, you won't even have to
worry about asking anybody else to speak. What a deal!
Apply now and receive sizable kickbacks within the next
two weeks, guaranteed!
YOU CAN'T PRINT THAT.
Oh, yes you can. As Editor of the ASSU News, you can
print anything you want. This year, we've had a fine history
of offending people, and we're even being considered for a
Pusslitzer Prize in Mondo-Obnoxiousness. The job basically
involves one night every other week of gathering, writing
and editing the latest news from the Senate. But, then
again, since the Senate won't exist next year, you cna just
spend one night every other week getting shitfaced and
printing nasty things about your roommate or Ella
Fitzgerald.
Be one of The Few. The Loud. The Truly Repulsive. And
remember, if you don't become Editor, your roommate
probably will, and that could be some serious shit comin'
down.
HEED THE CALL-UP
Attention: Absolutely Everyone,
and Especially Those Who Voted
'Nea' On the Late New Constitution
The King is gone, but not forgotten. A healthy majority
sent a message that change is sorely needed, and those
who've voiced opposition seem to agree that the current
system sucks, but just want to be sure that the new sys
tem is perfect for everybody. That is good. That is politics.
And, just like the surgeon general reminds us, quitters
never win.
The Constitution is being revised and will soon be pre
sented in final form. We need, we want, we send out the
call-up for your input. Everyone who voted against it
should call us and tell us exactly why, and what they
would like to see in the final constitution. The worst pos
sible fate would be an endless future with the current
set-up. Remember: Monsters are bad. Read it. Learn it.
Live it.
I mean it. Give us a call, anytime. This is more impor
tant than sleep.

Call us. If you can't get one of us, get the other. Or
write up your ideas and slip 'em under our door. Invite
us to your group's next meeting: Corner us in the street.
Tell us everything we need to know and tell us IN THE
NEXT TWO WEEKS. Let's do it now.
Imagine Nothing Changing. It's easy of you don't try.
