SPECIAL PROJECTS
You're a special person!
That's right. What makes you so special? Everyone has
something that makes them special. Perhaps you have three
heads, or a dog named Bob. The important thing is, you're
special!
That's why you'd make a great Special Projects Manager.
Doesn't that sound fancy! Say it out loud. Dream a little.
Take charge of projects as special as yourself. Things like the
ASSU Linen Service, which sells special sheets for those spe
cial beds; Special Classes, like Bartending, Gourmet Cook
ing, and Crockery Framing; and Refrigerator Rental, which
is self-explanatory. Apply to the ASSU.
LECTURE NOTES /
COPY SERVICE
Imagine my chagrin. I had been sleeping in class for a full
quarter last year when I felt a gentle hand on my shoulder
one morning. It was my professor. "Son," he said to me, "I
think it would only be fair to tell you that we've got a little
tradition we like to practice here." I rubbed my eyes. "Yes
sir. I see sir. What tradition is that?" "Giving tests" he re
plied. "There's a final next week."
"I see" I said. It was clear that a little nose-nudging was in
order. "I want you to know that your History class had been
very insightful."
"Physical Chemistry" he said. "See you on Friday."
I was lucky. I knew what to do. I ran down to the ASSU
Lecture Notes office. "These are only intended as a supple
ment, and do not replace constructive classroom interac
tion" said the helpful Notes employee, and we both doubled
over with laughter at his incisive wit.
One problem solved. The other problem: my whole dorm
had enrolled, but didn't come to class at all 'cause I said,
"Hey, I'll take notes." Luckily, the ASSU bought a giant
copier this year and they can handle any kind of bulk copy
ing you throw their way.
Two hits, no errors. If you would like to manage my two
favorite services, give us your name. And I'll give it to all my
friends.

She's leaving. Fast. Apply to be our Flicks Manager and god

Borgnine sarring in It Came from a Large Bus, or Triumph of
the Swill.

Boathouse. A treat for you and Pauline. Apply now and you

T-SHIRTS
When I was in fifth grade I had a brithday party. This is a
true story. Anyhow, some friend's mother bought this t
shirt with a picture of Vinne Barbarino and the words "Up
Your Nose with a Rubber Hose" on it and made him give it
to me. Something like that's probably happened to you. It
was a stupid shirt, and I didn't want to wear it, but my
friend kept asking why I never wore the shirt he bought me,
so I wore it to school and everyone laughed in my face and
called those annoying names kids in fifth grade are so good
at thinking up.
We sell shirts like that at the ASSU. And visiting grand
mas and granddads and uncles and aunts buy them and give
them to bad grandkids and nephews and nieces on Christ
mas and make the poor kids wear them to school, where
they get laughed off the playground. It all evens out in the
end. Enjoy it. Become the T-Shirts Project Manager. Apply
to the ASSU.
RECYCLE
Remember Ernestine, the pygmie that used to sit on you
and make you eat lima bean stew? She was going to be sus
pended for putting 250 tons of glass, aluminum, and paper
products in the DU's basement and throwing up on it. Well,
she died. She was sunbathing in Florida when a large
solid-fuel rocket booster fell on her. It was a big mess, but
nobody misses her except us. She was our Recycling Project
Manager. If you don't apply, she'll come and visit you in
your dreams and sleep with you. Apply now.
ADVERTISING AGENCY
Step Right Up!
Do you like to sell things (i.e., exam answers, stolen prop
erty, your soul)? When your mom made you a birthday
cake, did you go and sell it to the local bakery? Did you try
to sell your younger brother to a band of gypsies?
If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, you're
eligible to become Project Manager or Business Manager of r
the Stanford Advertising Agency. Become an Ad Man.

very insightful."
"Physical Chemistry" he said. "See you on Friday."
I was lucky. I knew what to do. I ran down to the ASSU
Lecture Notes office. "These are only intended as a supple
ment, and do not replace constructive classroom interac
tion" said the helpful Notes employee, and we both doubled
over with laughter at his incisive wit.
One problem solved. The other problem: my whole dorm
had enrolled, but didn't come to class at all 'cause I said,
"Hey, I'll take notes." Luckily, the ASSU bought a giant
copier this year and they can handle any kind of bulk copy
ing you throw their way.
Two hits, no errors. If you would like to manage my two
favorite services, give us your name. And I'll give it to all my
friends.

T-SHIRTS
When I was in fifth grade I had a brithday party. This is a
true story. Anyhow, some friend's mother bought this t
shirt with a picture of Vinne Barbarino and the words "Up
Your Nose with a Rubber Hose" on it and made him give it
to me. Something like that's probably happened to you. It
was a stupid shirt, and I didn't want to wear it, but my
friend kept asking why I never wore the shirt he bought me,
so I wore it to school and everyone laughed in my face and
called those annoying names kids in fifth grade are so good
at thinking up.
We sell shirts like that at the ASSU. And visiting grand
mas and granddads and uncles and aunts buy them and give
them to bad grandkids and nephews and nieces on Christ
mas and make the poor kids wear them to school, where
they get laughed off the playground. It all evens out in the
end. Enjoy it. Become the T-Shirts Project Manager. Apply
to the ASSU.
RECYCLE
Remember Ernestine, the pygmie that used to sit on you
and make you eat lima bean stew? She was going to be sus
pended for putting 250 tons of glass, aluminum, and paper
products in the DU's basement and throwing up on it. Well,
she died. She was sunbathing in Florida when a large
solid-fuel rocket booster fell on her. It was a big mess, but
nobody misses her except us. She was our Recycling Project
Manager. If you don't apply, she'll come and visit you in
your dreams and sleep with you. Apply now.

SPECIAL PROJECTS
You're a special person!
That's right. What makes you so special? Everyone has
something that makes them special. Perhaps you have three
heads, or a dog named Bob. The important thing is, you're
special!
That's why you'd make a great Special Projects Manager.
Doesn't that sound fancy! Say it out loud. Dream a little.
Take charge of projects as special as yourself. Things like the
ASSU Linen Service, which sells special sheets for those spe
cial beds; Special Classes, like Bartending, Gourmet Cook
ing, and Crockery Framing; and Refrigerator Rental, which
is self-explanatory. Apply to the ASSU.
LECTURE NOTES /
COPY SERVICE
Imagine my chagrin. I had been sleeping in class for a full
quarter last year when I felt a gentle hand on my shoulder
one morning. It was my professor. "Son," he said to me, "I
think it would only be fair to tell you that we've got a little
tradition we like to practice here." I rubbed my eyes. "Yes
sir. I see sir. What tradition is that?" "Giving tests" he re
plied. "There's a final next week."
"I see" I said. It was clear that a little nose-nudging was in
order. "I want you to know that your History class had been
very insightful."
"Physical Chemistry" he said. "See you on Friday."
I was lucky. I knew what to do. I ran down to the ASSU
Lecture Notes office. "These are only intended as a supple
ment, and do not replace constructive classroom interac
tion" said the helpful Notes employee, and we both doubled
over with laughter at his incisive wit.
