# Senate places fees on ballot
## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night con
sidered Appropriations Committee
recommendations to place special fee
requests on the spring ballot. KZSU,
The Daily and the Glee Club are
among those organizations whose fee
requests will be voted on in the April
elections.
KZSU's original fee request, cut by
the Appropriations Committee, was
further reduced during the senate
meeting to a gross special fee of
$54,667. Several senators expressed
concern over the high increase in
KZSUs fee request from last year,
and the issue of money mismanage
ment was raised during debate.
Supporting reduction in KZSU's
special fee, Graduate Senator Eric
Berg claimed that last year's special
fee allocation was misspent. When
the campus station was allocated
$6,000 to buy a mixing console last
year, it spent $14,000 on a new
console, he said.
KZSU Station Manager Lisa Her
nandez, who represented the radio
station at the meeting, claimed that
the $14,000 console "will last for 20
years," which will reduce future spe
cial fee requests.
Hernandez pointed out that
KZSU relies on student income to
continue broadcasting, rather than on
advertisements. Senator Jay
Goldsmith argued that increases in
fund-raising drives and underwriting
could allow KZSU to purchase new
equipment.
The Senate voted to placed a
neutral recommendation for KZSU's
fee request on the spring ejections
ballot.
Senators voted to divide The
Daily's special fee request into two
equal requests for $20,000 each, ex
actly half the $40,000 The Daily will
ask for this year.
Graduate Senator Richard Beigel
objected to the net surplus of
$22,309 that The Daily has budgeted
in its special fee request.
"Why should we be giving them a
$22,000 profit?" he said.
At the meeting, Daily Business
Manager David Benwell argued that
The Daily needs the $22,000 to make

up for a loss of $26,000 last year.
Senator David Porter agreed that
as a private corporation, The Daily
"needs reserves to keep running." He
pointed out that The Daily's $22,000
reserve would be less than one
quarter of its total expenses for the
year.
Former Daily Editor in Chief Troy
Eid, who also attended the meeting,

said he has "never understood the
logic of splitting a budget without
regard to what a group has re
quested."
The senate will recommend that
students vote no on both parts of The
Daily's fee request.
After allowing members of the
Glee Club present at the meeting to

sing for three minutes, senators dis
cussed the club's special fee request
of $9,407 to help subsidize a concert
tour through Eastern Europe next
year. Although doubts were raised as
to whether the ASSU should ask stu
dents to pay for the Glee Club's tour,
the senate decided to allow students
to vote on the issue in the spring elec
tions. The senate will recommend a

no-vote in the ballot.
Other fees that will appear on the
ballot are the Axe Committee's re
quest for $21,363 to cover activity
costs and the Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band's request
for a divided special fee to cover
operating costs and a winter road trip.
The senate also approved funding re
quests from the Police Review Com

mission, contingent upon the board's
ability to produce acceptable by-laws.
The senate will meet next week to ap
prove the board's proposed by-laws.
The senate will recommend that
students vote yes on the Axe Com
mittee's request, yes for the first half
of the band's request, no for the
second half, and yes for the police
review commission.
