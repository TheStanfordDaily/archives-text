# Senate places fees on ballot
## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night con
sidered Appropriations Committee
recommendations to place special fee
requests on the spring ballot. KZSU,
The Daily and the Glee Club are
among those organizations whose fee
requests will be voted on in the April
elections.
KZSU's original fee request, cut by
the Appropriations Committee, was
further reduced during the senate
meeting to a gross special fee of
$54,667. Several senators expressed
concern over the high increase in
KZSUs fee request from last year,
and the issue of money mismanage
ment was raised during debate.
Supporting reduction in KZSU's
special fee, Graduate Senator Eric
Berg claimed that last year's special
fee allocation was misspent. When
the campus station was allocated
$6,000 to buy a mixing console last
year, it spent $14,000 on a new
console, he said.
KZSU Station Manager Lisa Her
nandez, who represented the radio
station at the meeting, claimed that
the $14,000 console "will last for 20
years," which will reduce future spe
cial fee requests.
Hernandez pointed out that
KZSU relies on student income to
continue broadcasting, rather than on
advertisements. Senator Jay
Goldsmith argued that increases in
fund-raising drives and underwriting
could allow KZSU to purchase new
equipment.
The Senate voted to placed a
neutral recommendation for KZSU's
fee request on the spring ejections
ballot.
Senators voted to divide The
Daily's special fee request into two
equal requests for $20,000 each, ex
actly half the $40,000 The Daily will
ask for this year.
Graduate Senator Richard Beigel
objected to the net surplus of
$22,309 that The Daily has budgeted
