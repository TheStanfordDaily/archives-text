# Official discusses Middle East

### LESLIE KAUFMAN Staff writer 
It may have been a cold night outside, but in
Florence Moore Hall last night, student passions were
running hot during a discussion about the current hap
penings in the Middle East.
As part of Cardenal House's series on the Middle
East, Mitchell Eisen, a field coordinator for American
Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), addressed a
tense audience in the Faisan House lounge.
Eisen covered a broad range of topics, concentrating
on peace initiatives and terrorism. Talking specifically
about the much-speculated possibility of peace
negotiations between Israel and Jordan, Eisen
remained hopeful but explained the many constraints
that limit actions toward peace.
"I believe that, deep down, King Hussein of Jordan
wants peace with Israel, but he is under a lot of pres
sure," Eisen said. "He doesn't have a popular mandate
from the people, and he is justifiably worried about his
own political position. (Former Egyptian President
Anwar) Sadat basically paid his life because he was in
strumental in the peace settlement with Israel."
Eisen said that though peace negotiations are always
a complex and difficult process, the Camp David ac
cords proved that peace initiatives are possible, but
they require face-to-face negotiations between leaders.
He heralded Sadat as a leader who showed foresight
and bravery. If there is to be peace, Hussein will have
to be "equally courageous and come forward and deal
with Israel," Eisen said.
"Israel is not going to disappear overnight," he said.
"She is not going to be washed into the sea. She has the
right to exist â€” to exist in peace with her neighbors. If
her neighbors won't even recognize her right to exist, it
makes peace all but impossible.

Eisen denounced the use of terrorism as a political
weapon and said strong action is the way to handle ter
rorism. "The wrong way to deal with terrorism is ap
peasement," he said. "Terrorism is like a new age in
civil warfare, and we must fight back."
Eisen said news media coverage has aided terrorists.
"They use television like a megaphone for their ideas
and demands," he said.
Although Eisen singled out the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO), he condemned all kinds of ter
rorism. "There is nothing that justifies crossing a bor
der into a country, shooting a busload of children, and
then going home and rejoicing. Nothing. I don't care if
you're Arab, Jewish, Latin American or whatever."
Despite strong actions by world leaders, Eisen is
pessimistic about preventing terrorism. "I don't think
there will ever be an end to world terrorism. I hate to
admit that."
Some students objected to Eisen's presentation of the
terrorist situation. Steve Tamari, a graduate student in
history, said, "I lived on the West Bank for two-and-a
half years, and I have some knowledge of the situation
there. A representative of AIPAC is basically a foreign
agent for Israel. He can't be an objective source on ter
rorism."
However, Cardenal Resident Assistant Ashleigh
Head said, "In this series, we are trying very hard to
represent as many points of view as possible. There are
lots of variables involved in this kind of delicate sub
ject, and it is hard to please everybody."
Ricky Rosenkranz, another Cardenal RA,
elaborated on the purpose of the series. "It is our goal
to prevent some of the terrible stereotypes that have
formed about Arabs and about Israelis. Arabs are
good people, and Jews are good people. We want
people to come together and talk.
