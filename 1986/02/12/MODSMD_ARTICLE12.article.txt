# Doctors protest Senate bill
## 
### LIZ EGAN Editorial staff 
Almost 50 faculty members of the Stanford Medical
School have written California state legislators to urge
them to vote against state Senate Bill 1405, which
would give humane officers authority to oversee re
search facilities compliance with laws governing the
use of animals in research.
A humane officer is any private citizen appointed by
a corporation that states as its purpose the prevention
of cruelty to animals.
There s no provision in the bill for our side of the
story ... so its going to end up to be just a way to ha
rass us, said the director of the division of laboratory
animal medicine at Stanford, Dr. Thomas Hamm, Jr.
The bill, introduced by Senate President Pro Tem
David Roberti (D-Los Angeles), has already passed
the Senate. It is expected to be taken up by the Assem
bly Judiciary Committee this month and will go di
rectly to the floor of the Assembly upon committee ap
proval.
The provisions of the bill would expand the law en
forcement powers of private citizens appointed by Cal
ifornia humane societies.
University physicians, as well as many other re
searchers throughout the state, argue that the bill could
cause severe damage to biomedical research in Califor
nia.
David Korn, vice president and dean of the medical
school, summed up many of the objections in a letter
he wrote to the Assembly Judiciary Committee.
According to Korn, SB 1405 would "introduce
humane officers to the conduct of biomedical research
— a role most inappropriate and potentially dangerous
. . . . This bill, in effect, empowers a group of individ
uals philosophically opposed to biomedical research
using animals to disrupt research and to make judg
ments on proper use of anesthetics, analgesics and
other matters requiring substantial technical ex
pertise."
Korn's argument echoes another statement opposing
SB 1405 endorsed by 19 members of the Coalition for
Biomedical Research — a group that includes Stan
ford, the University of California system, the Ameri
can Heart Association and the American Cancer Soci
ety. The coalition summarized its stand by stating,

"Authority over life-saving medical research ought not
to be granted to private groups which may be partisans
in a highly emotional controversy."
According to Hamm, the biggest problem with the
bill is that it doesn't require enough training for the
humane officers.
Opposition to the bill is not directed at the current
powers of these officers, opponents say. The state
ments oppose the extension of the enforcement powers
of the officers.
The coalition called the proposed inspection powers
ironic, because existing laws already provide close
monitoring of the research animals. "Never in history
has more attention been focused on the proper treat
ment of animals in research or on ways of involving the
public in the process of overseeing such research," the
coalition wrote.
"If 1 thought the bill was going to help research or
the animals, then I'd be for it, but it's just another way
of harassment," Hamm said.
However, Sylvia Bancroft of the Humane
Legislative Network (HLN), said,"lt's about tima. . . .
We need a way to inspect these places. I think the bill
should be given a chance."
Bancroft said she would like to see the Animal
Welfare Act — a federal statute designed to protect
laboratory animals — truly enforced with SB 1405.
However, she said if the appointed officers do not have
the proper training, then "they don't have any business
being there."
Groups such as the Peninsula Humane Society,
Santa Clara County Humane Society and the HLN are
not opposed to animal research to benefit human
welfare. Their policy condemns unnecessary cruelty to
the animals and urges researchers to use alternative ex
periments such as computer studies.
Other statements by Stanford physicians included:
• Dr. Samuel Strober, professor of medicine and chief
of the division of immunology: "The use of untrained
personnel to monitor the research is as absurd as
having untrained personnel participate in the re
search."
• Dr. Avram Boldstein, professor of pharmacology:
"If we are to learn more about why people become ad
dicted to drugs, we have to study the addiction process
either in people or in animals. There are no alterna
tives."
