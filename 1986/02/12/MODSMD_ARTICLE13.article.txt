## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Rethink tenure policy 
### 
Recently, the History Department decided not to
recommend tenure to Asst. Prof. Stephen Ferruolo.
Ferruolo's denial calls into question new tenure proce
dures introduced last year by the School of Humanities
and Sciences.
The primary change from the old system concerns
the area of scholarship evaluation. Individual depart
ments vote tenure recommendations based upon:
• Consideration of the candidate's scholarly achieve
ments. This is done by reviewing the candidates pub
lished material, and by soliciting evaluations from ac
knowledged experts in the candidate's field of re
search.
• Student appraisal of the candidate's teaching skill.
Final tenure decisions rest with the Dean of
Humanities and Sciences.
That Ferroulo was denied tenure despite the fact
that he is considered by many to be both a superb
teacher as well as an excellent scholar underscores the
impropriety of the new tenure guidelines.
Under the old system, the letters sent to outside
evaluators asked that the candidate be compared to
leading scholars of comparable age and position in his
field. The new evaluation forms require that the candi
date "must show equivalent potential if not equivalent
accomplishment to those who are setting the standards

of the field regardless of age. Tenured promotions are
given to those . . . scholars who have shown that they
have the capacity to change the character and expand
the paradigms of their disciplines."
In some fields such as medieval history, Ferruolo's
area of research, contributions which "expand the
paradigms" of a field are rarely made at such an early
stage in a tenure candidate's career. Compared to a
field such as mathematics, in which scholarly potential
is revealed at a very early age, the time required to ac
cumulate knowledge and appreciate the nuances of a
topic like medieval history makes immediate and im
portant discoveries more difficult.
Furthermore, while it is admirable to seek higher
standards of scholarship in tenure candidates, the new
requirements are too strict and result in an overem
phasis on scholarship at the expense of teaching. In or
der to meet the strict tenure requirements, otherwise
dynamic teachers will be forced to concentrate their
energies on scholarship. Ultimately, this may reduce
the quality of the teaching students recieve at Stanford.
Though the School of Humanities and Sciences
should be applauded for its desire to ensure that Stan
ford awards tenure to only the finest scholars, the strin
gent new scholarship requirements for tenure will do
more harm than good.
