SOS A decries
shanty destruction
Early Sunday morning the shan
tytown in White Plaza was destroyed.
The shantytown was built by a con
cerned group of students who, feeling
the reality of Black South Africa was
far removed from campus, wanted to
expose the Stanford community to
the ugliness of apartheid.
In South Africa, shantytowns are
built by Black people determined to
keep their families and communities
together despite laws aimed at sepa
rating them. Our shanties
represented our own commitment to
support the struggles of these people
for liberation and survival.
We are both saddened and angered
by this act of violence. We don't want
to speculate as to who committed it
and why; instead we challenge those
responsible to come forth and explain
the meaning of their action.

Columnist reveals
narrowmindedness
Jason Matherly's pronouncement
on the Gorbachev invitation
("Inviting Gorbachev irresponsible,"
The Daily, Feb. 10) can only be des
cribed as narrowminded. While he
criticizes the senior class presidents
for being "embarrassing and insult
ing," he overlooks his own
chauvinism. The most obvious case
for this is his slamming of the Soviets
for possessing the power to destroy
the United States "on a whim," while
the United States is apparently nei
ther so deadly nor so whimsical.
Matherly condemns the "hon
oring" of the Soviet leader be
cause Gorbachev does not know the

ideals and thoughts of today's young,
presumably freedom-loving
Americans. The obvious reply is that
no student is here to have his own
views spoon-fed back to him. Where
does it lead if you refuse to listen be
cause someone has a different or op
posing view?
No one will argue that Gorbachev
came to his present position by being
a "nice guy." However, inflammatory
rhetoric and absolutist stances will
only succeed in compounding existing
problems, not eliminating them.
As for the columnist's comment on
the leaders of South Africa and North
Vietnam (I, for one, was not aware
that Vietnam is still a divided nation):
why shouldn't we hear from those
people, too? The public forum in
America allows anyone to expose his
prejudices and arrogance, as Math
erly demonstrated so convincingly.

Guard free speech
Some of the "free speech" talk
reverberating around the Stanford
campus these days has a disturbing
anti-First Amendment smell about it.
I refer specifically to the controversy
surrounding the false report of a
white supremacy meeting carried by
The Daily (Once Around the Quad,
Jan. 30). Perhaps misleading an
nouncements should not be permit
ted. Much of the criticism, however,
seems premised on a belief that the
announcement should not have been
printed even had such a meeting actu
ally been scheduled.
On the contrary, all views — even
"politically incorrect" ones such as
white supremacy — must be freely
aired if the First Amendment is to
mean anything. I'm not sure why, but
this is a basic concept our friends on

the left seem to have particular diffi
culty understanding.

Angola meddling
shows cowardice
Destruction of the Soweto shacks
in White Plaza — in the darkest hours
of the early morning — was more
than reprehensible. It was an act of
cowardice. No less cowardly are those
members of Congress and the Reagan
Administration who last week wined,
dined and pledged support to Jonas
Savimbi, leader of rebel forces who
are fighting along with South African
troops to undermine the government
of Angola and thereby help tighten
South Africa's illegal hold on neigh
boring Namibia.
As The New York Times of Feb. 10]
pointed out, "By openly joining
Savimbi's cause for no achievable
end, the United States becomes the
strategic ally of a racist state." Ac
cording to the Times, "American
diplomacy has failed to achieve a
multilateral peace settlement in
Southern Africa and finds it easier to
rail against Angola than the true
culprit. South Africa."
The Reagan Administration, in
cluding Secretary of State George
Shultz, knows it is politically danger
ous to openly support South Africa's
apartheid regime. By aiding its sur
rogate forces in Angola, however, the
United States will be providing such
support through the back door. This
is an act of political cowardice that
will have devastating consequences
for the people of Angola. Those at
Stanford who oppose apartheid
should immediately let Congress
know that they also oppose U.S. aid
for South Africa's surrogate forces in
Angola.
