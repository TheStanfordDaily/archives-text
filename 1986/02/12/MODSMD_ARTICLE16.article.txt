## Propaganda distorts terrorism 
### 
It seems that lately we hear the word terrorism used so
often that it has begun to lose its meaning. Webster
defines terrorism as the "use of force or threats to
demoralize, intimidate and subjugate, esp. such use as a
political weapon or policy." Given this definition, how do
we determine what is terrorist activity and what is not? Or
could it be possible that terrorism is in the eye of the be
holder?
1 argue that there are in fact two types of terrorism: in
itiatory and responsive. Initiatory terrorism is that which
is directed towards an adversary without the like having
already been inflicted upon the first actor. Examples of
these types are the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the invasion
of Grenada and the attack on the organization MOVE in
Philadelphia. Note that terrorism can be directed against
individuals and thus apply as well to the Holocaust and
the repulsive treatment of millions of Africans and
African - A mericans.
All of these cases have a similar attribute, the criminal
actor or initiator was not at any time the victim of terrorist
activities from the second party, but was instead the open

aggressor. There are many other examples of initatory
terrorism, but I think the above will suffice to illuminate
the nature of this type.
Responsive terrorism, on the other hand, is more jus
tifiable. It can be regarded as the exercise of the right to
self-preservation. The experiences of Native Americans,
of South African blacks and, controversially so, the ac
tions of Palestinian youths all fall into this category. The
distinguishing feature of responsive terrorism is that the
criminal actor's are resisting an injustice which has been
inflicted upon them for no apparent justifiable reason. In
this case there appears no other means of defense against
an enemy who is committed to the use of terrorism to
oppress the rights of the victim.
Where does all this fit into the recent events and
publicity surrounding "terrorist" activities? First, it is ne
cessary for us to recognize that we live in the era of
propaganda â€” psychological warfare waged on our minds
to gain our allegiance. Therefore it is not surprising that
terrorism is always associated with U.S. adversaries and
never with long-time trading partners like South Africa:
always associated with irrational rebel youths and Muslim
fanatics but never with prudent elderly white politicians or
CIA agents.
Is there a difference in the terrorist activities of the
PLO and those of the CIA? What we must understand is
that it does not matter who is the actor but the type of ac

tion being taken. As I pointed out, there are two types of
terrorist activity: initiatory and responsive. Once we un
derstand the type of terrorism, we will better understand
the motivating factors behind such terrorism. Then, and
only then, will we solve it. Military intervention is at best a
temporary, ego-boosting solution and at worst a cata
strophic endeavor.
In light of these observations, is Libyan President
Moammar Khadafy a terrorist, as our papers incline us to
believe? Indeed he is not, he is merely an advocate of
responsive terrorism. Further, he is the product of a ter
rorist international situation in which there are no clearly
enforceable rules. Mastering the tactics of terrorism
becomes a means of survival, these tactics are manifested
in the actions of Palestinian youths, themselves mere
products of a terrorist environment.

Is there a difference in the
terrorist activities of the
PLO and those of the CIA?
. . . it does not matter who is
the actor but the type of
action being taken.

Currently the United States is the chief supporter of a
South African regime which practices extreme initiatory
terrorism. When majority rule comes to South Africa, will
our papers shout "terrorist" or "pro-communist," when
in fact what the government's policies are doing is produc
ing that which it so vehemently abhors?
Yet the American government does not stand alone in
its morally disgraceful conduct. It is joined by a host of
other governments. In fact, the international system, as
has been remarked, is presently in a state of terrorist ac
tivity manifested in such places as Nicaragua, Angola,
South Africa, El Salvador and South Yemen to name a
few.
We must avoid being victims of the psychological
warfare being waged daily in the press. By doing so we
will develop a better understanding of the world, our
place in it and the responsibility that a potentially "true"
democracy such as the United States must play in world
peace and international unity.
