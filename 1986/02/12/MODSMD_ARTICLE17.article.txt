# Excluding foreign critics damages freedom
## 
### 
Once again this year. Congress is debating im
migration. Again, the debate focuses only on the il
legal immigrants who underpin the economy of
California and much of the rest of the nation.
Therefore, the immigration debate is once again
missing one of the most troubling aspects of the
U.S. immigration system.

ITEM: Farley Mowatt, a Canadian environmen
talist, is banned from speaking in the United States
because of his criticism of the acid rain our country
is dumping on his country.
ITEM: Hortensia Allende, an exiled Chilean
dissident, is barred from speaking in the United
States. In 1973, her husband, the democratically
elected president of Chile, died in the U.S.-backed
coup which established the military dictatorship
which still rules that country.
Neither of the above would-be visitors to our
country wish to stay here. Neither of them are
criminals or terrorists. Both have been denied a
chance to speak in the United States solely because
of their political views. And it gets worse.
ITEM: The United States deported noted Latin
American writer Angel Rama in 1983, after 14
years as a tenured literature professor at the Uni
versity of Maryland, because of supposed evidence
about his political beliefs. Not only was Rama
deported solely for political reasons, but he also
denied that the charge against him (that he had
once been a leftist) was accurate. Rama got

deported without ever having a chance to see and
rebut the alleged evidence against him.
ITEM: The United States denied a transit visa to
Gabriel Garcia Marquez, possibly the greatest
living writer in the world today, when he wanted to
change planes in New York in 1982 on his way to
pick up his Nobel Prize for literature. Garcia Mar
quez is a friend of Cuban President Fidel Castro,
and he opposes the U.S. embargo against Cuba.
The villain here is not just the Reagan Adminis
tration, although it has enforced the exclusion of
"un-American" foreigners more vigorously than
have past administration*. The real villain is a 1952
immigration statute, the McCarran-Walter Act.

If we really believe in liberal democracy (and I do),
we have to believe it cannot be threatened by the
ideas of competing ideologies . . .

This act, passed at the low ebb of reason in the
McCarthy hysteria, bans even the temporary entry
into the United States of many non-violent leftists.
In 1952, many Americans believed that commun
ism would inevitably replace our system of govern
ment unless the very ideas of all leftists (whether
communist or not) could be snuffed out of exis
tence. The McCarran Act is even worse in practice
than it appears. It is enforced largely through secret
CIA reports which generally do not distinguish be
tween social democrats and Leninist revolutionar
ies.
When Colombian President Betancur intervened
on behalf of Prof. Rama. President Reagan himself
learned that the United States could deport people
based solely on their political beliefs. Reagan was
surprised, he said, "because America is a

democracy." Out of the mouths of babes. . . .
Reagan's instincts about political philosophy were
correct, though his constitutional law was not. If we
really believe in liberal democracy (and I do), we
have to believe it cannot be threatened by the ideas
of competing ideologies, even (and especially)
communism.
As John Milton asked, "Let [Truth] and False
hood grapple; who ever knew Truth put to the
worst, in a free and open encounter?" Knowledge
is not advanced by silencing discussion and debate.
These same principles within the United States un
derlie the First Amendment. "Foreign" ideas can
not weaken us; they can only make us wiser. These

principles are so self-evidently obvious as to be al
most cliches.
ITEM: According to KZSU, late last year mem
bers of the English rock band New Model Army
were denied visas for a scheduled U.S. concert
tour. The U.S. government declared that the group
had "no redeeming social value.' Having heard
one song by this group, I can state that they are not
likely to be confused with the League of Women
Voters. But we do not allow Washington to make
aesthetic and intellectual judgments for us in
domestic affairs. Should we allow our government
to protect us from ideas it thinks may harm as,
when those ideas come from beyond our borders?

pick up his Nobel Prize for literature. Garcia Mar
quez is a friend of Cuban President Fidel Castro,
and he opposes the U.S. embargo against Cuba.
The villain here is not just the Reagan Adminis
tration, although it has enforced the exclusion of
"un-American" foreigners more vigorously than
have past administration*. The real villain is a 1952
immigration statute, the McCarran-Walter Act.

If we really believe in liberal democracy (and I do),
we have to believe it cannot be threatened by the
ideas of competing ideologies . . .

This act, passed at the low ebb of reason in the
McCarthy hysteria, bans even the temporary entry
into the United States of many non-violent leftists.
In 1952, many Americans believed that commun
ism would inevitably replace our system of govern
ment unless the very ideas of all leftists (whether
communist or not) could be snuffed out of exis
tence. The McCarran Act is even worse in practice
than it appears. It is enforced largely through secret
CIA reports which generally do not distinguish be
tween social democrats and Leninist revolutionar
ies.
When Colombian President Betancur intervened
on behalf of Prof. Rama. President Reagan himself
learned that the United States could deport people
based solely on their political beliefs. Reagan was
surprised, he said, "because America is a

democracy." Out of the mouths of babes. . . .
Reagan's instincts about political philosophy were
correct, though his constitutional law was not. If we
really believe in liberal democracy (and I do), we
have to believe it cannot be threatened by the ideas
of competing ideologies, even (and especially)
communism.
As John Milton asked, "Let [Truth] and False
hood grapple; who ever knew Truth put to the
worst, in a free and open encounter?" Knowledge
is not advanced by silencing discussion and debate.
These same principles within the United States un
derlie the First Amendment. "Foreign" ideas can
not weaken us; they can only make us wiser. These

principles are so self-evidently obvious as to be al
most cliches.
ITEM: According to KZSU, late last year mem
bers of the English rock band New Model Army
were denied visas for a scheduled U.S. concert
tour. The U.S. government declared that the group
had "no redeeming social value.' Having heard
one song by this group, I can state that they are not
likely to be confused with the League of Women
Voters. But we do not allow Washington to make
aesthetic and intellectual judgments for us in
domestic affairs. Should we allow our government
to protect us from ideas it thinks may harm as,
when those ideas come from beyond our borders?
