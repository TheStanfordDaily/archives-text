## Three Stanford grads attempt Mt. Everest 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
Stanford alumnae have a history of
firsts. Sally Ride was the first U.S.
woman in space and Sandra Day
O'Connor was the first woman on the
U.S. Supreme Court.
And in October, three former
Stanford students may achieve yet
another first. Heidi Benson, Kathryn
Collins and Ellen Lapham may
become the first American women to
climb to the 29,028-foot summit of
Mt. Everest, the world's highest peak.
Five women have stood on the
summit before — one each from
Japan, China and Poland and two
from Germany — but no American
woman has climbed above 28,000
feet, explained Lapham, who
received her MBA from Stanford in
1977.
To all three Stanford graduates,
and the rest of the 18-member team
which includes two other women, the
climb is worth the danger of the
avalanches, crevasses, human error,
minus-30-degree cold, 100-mile-an
hour winds, extreme altitudes and
bland food that an Everest expedition
must confront. According to Benson,
a 1983 graduate in anthropology, one
of every 10 climbers in the Himalayas
has perished.
Lapham said the possibility of be
coming the first American woman on
the summit of Everest makes the ex

pedition worth the risk. At 42, Lap
ham would also be the oldest woman
to ever reach the summit.
"I'm on this team because this is in
spirational. It's inspirational to me,
but 1 know there are a lot of other
women who would like to do things
that are out of the ordinary and diffi
cult — and it doesn't have to be
climbing Everest," said Lapham, who
now lives and trains full-time in Por
tola Valley.
Lapham, who is trying to raise most
of the $500,000 needed for the ex
pedition, said she will serve mostly as
a support climber, carrying loads of
equipment in for those who are estab
lishing the route further up the moun
tain.
However, she added, "I am one of
five women who might make it to the
summit, though I believe that the
other women on the team, two of
whom have much more high altitude
experience, have a much better shot
at being on the first summit teams. So
I might make it in a follow-on team,"
Lapham said. She explained that two
or three climbers at a time will try for
the summit once a camp is established
high on the mountain.
"But obviously, once you get on
the mountain and everyone proves
out how they're doing, you pick the
strongest people to go for the sum
mit. .. . And if I'm really strong —
and I'm working out to be strong —
I'm going to go for the top if at all

possible," she added. Last spring,
Lapham nearly reached the summit
of the 20,300-foot Himalayan peak,
Imja Tse.
Benson is one of those who have
had some considerable high-altitude
experience. She was a member of an
unsuccessful Everest ascent last
spring. "You really can't tell in ad :
vance " Benson said. "I'm keeprfig" v
my fingers crossed. I felt real good on
the last expedition. I also just want to
be part of the expedition that gets the
first (American) woman to the top."
Everest, a massive rock pyramid
straddling the boarder between Nepal
and Tibet, was first climbed in 1953

by an English team. Americans first
achieved the summit in 1963, and the
first woman successfully scaled the
mountain in 1973.
Benson, who is coordinating the
expedition in Salt Lake City, said the
logistics of planning the trip are far
more terrifying than the mountain it
self. Among her responsibilities are
keeping expedition members in
formed, soliciting free equipment and
food and "dealing with the countries"
through which the expedition will
travel. Benson said.
"The worst part is the planning. It's
more horrifying dealing with every
thing ahead of time. . . . One in 10

climbers who go to the Himalayas
dies, but you never think it's going to
be you."
Lapham added that the sense of
team camaraderie among moun
taineers is another reason she joined
the climb. "A lot of climbers I've
talked to have said the same thing:
'We got off the mountain. We may or
may not have made the summit, but
what's wonderful is that we're all still
friends,' " she said. "I've heard that
from . . . some of the top moun
taineers . . . and I've heard it from
people who have been on their first
major expedition.
"It's not just this quest to go throw
yourself against the top of the moun
tain. It's also a very human team en
deavor," Lapham added.
The expedition members are plan
ning to fly from San Francisco to
Beijing, China on Aug. 1. There, the
expedition will clear its equipment
through customs before traveling to
Cheng Du by train in order to see the
Chinese countryside, Benson said.
From Cheng Du, the expedition
will fly to Lhasa — a town 12,500 feet
high in the Tibetan Himalayas —
where some of the members of the
expedition will test the hang gliding
equipment they hope to use on
Everest, Lapham said. The hang
gliding permit issued to the expedi
tion by the Chinese government is the
first such permission ever granted,
she added.

The expedition will then make a
week-long bus journey along a mili
tary access road to the spot where it
will establish base camp, about 9,000
vertical feet below the summit of
Everest, Lapham said.
"By that time, we'll be in the third
week of the expedition, and we'll
spend the next five weeks establishing
(five or six) camps," progressively
higher on the mountain, Lapham ex
plained.
Once on the mountain, the clim
bers plan to ascend to the North Col,
a saddle in a ridge which connects
Everest with a neighboring mountain,
and then to choose between the
North Face and the North Ridge as a
final route to the summit, Benson
said.
In addition to the 18 members of
the team, 19 Sherpas, natives of the
Nepalese Himalayas who have
become extremely adept at assisting
Western expeditions, will help with
climbing and ferrying loads between
camps.
If all goes according to plan, sum
mit bids will take place in the second
or third week of October and, "If
we're sucessful on the summit, then
we'll stick around long enough to
send other teams to the top and then
go back down," according to Lap
ham.
Lapham, however, stressed that the



Stanford alumnae Kathyrn Collins (left), Heidi Benson (above) and El
len Lapham hope to be the first American women to reach Mt.
Everest's peak.

expedition's plans are flexible. "You
could sit for two weeks at base camp
waiting for the weather just to let you
go between camps. You can get stuck
part way up the mountain," she said.
"There's a lot of luck involved.
There's also a lot of luck involved in
how people fare at altitude. What
sickness means at those altitudes is
that people have to stay at base camp
or go back down to a lower altitude,"
she added.
However, she was optimistic about
the team's chances. "An American
woman has yet to make it to the sum
mit, and an American team of women
has yet to make it to the summit. So,
we might just get both accomplished."
The conditions that will confront
the team on Everest will be "really
severe climatically," and disasterous
results are possible because of
"fatigue and the chance of making a
big error," according to Lapham.
Collins, who graduated from Stan
ford Medical School in 1977, will
serve as one of two doctors for the
team. Now the director of the emer
gency department at the Lander
Medical Center in Wyoming, she has
climbed in the Teton Range in
Wyoming as well as in Europe, Africa
and Asia, and she was expedition
doctor for the 1980 American
Women's Expedition to Dhaulagiri I,
a 26,000 foot Himalayan peak.
The specialized equipment that the
team will be using on Everest is
"pretty good," according to Lapham,
though she added she worries her feet
"are going to get pretty darn cold."
"The gear has improved a lot. And,
in fact, one of the things an expedi
tion offers to the world and also to
manufacturers ... is an opportunity
to improve on the technology," Lap
ham said.
Of the $500,000 the expedition is
trying to raise through corporate and
individual contributions, Lapham
said air freight, oxygen supplies and
specialized clothing are the most
costly. Shipping 15 to 20 tons of
equipment and air fare for the team
will cost about $90,000; specialized
oxygen equipment to be used at high
altitude will cost about $20,000; and
clothing about $4,000 per climber.

formed, soliciting free equipment and
food and "dealing with the countries"
through which the expedition will
travel. Benson said.
"The worst part is the planning. It's
more horrifying dealing with every
thing ahead of time. . . . One in 10

climbers who go to the Himalayas
dies, but you never think it's going to
be you."
Lapham added that the sense of
team camaraderie among moun
taineers is another reason she joined
the climb. "A lot of climbers I've
talked to have said the same thing:
'We got off the mountain. We may or
may not have made the summit, but
what's wonderful is that we're all still
friends,' " she said. "I've heard that
from . . . some of the top moun
taineers . . . and I've heard it from
people who have been on their first
major expedition.
"It's not just this quest to go throw
yourself against the top of the moun
tain. It's also a very human team en
deavor," Lapham added.
The expedition members are plan
ning to fly from San Francisco to
Beijing, China on Aug. 1. There, the
expedition will clear its equipment
through customs before traveling to
Cheng Du by train in order to see the
Chinese countryside, Benson said.
From Cheng Du, the expedition
will fly to Lhasa — a town 12,500 feet
high in the Tibetan Himalayas —
where some of the members of the
expedition will test the hang gliding
equipment they hope to use on
Everest, Lapham said. The hang
gliding permit issued to the expedi
tion by the Chinese government is the
first such permission ever granted,
she added.

The expedition will then make a
week-long bus journey along a mili
tary access road to the spot where it
will establish base camp, about 9,000
vertical feet below the summit of
Everest, Lapham said.
"By that time, we'll be in the third
week of the expedition, and we'll
spend the next five weeks establishing
(five or six) camps," progressively
higher on the mountain, Lapham ex
plained.
Once on the mountain, the clim
bers plan to ascend to the North Col,
a saddle in a ridge which connects
Everest with a neighboring mountain,
and then to choose between the
North Face and the North Ridge as a
final route to the summit, Benson
said.
In addition to the 18 members of
the team, 19 Sherpas, natives of the
Nepalese Himalayas who have
become extremely adept at assisting
Western expeditions, will help with
climbing and ferrying loads between
camps.
If all goes according to plan, sum
mit bids will take place in the second
or third week of October and, "If
we're sucessful on the summit, then
we'll stick around long enough to
send other teams to the top and then
go back down," according to Lap
ham.
Lapham, however, stressed that the



Stanford alumnae Kathyrn Collins (left), Heidi Benson (above) and El
len Lapham hope to be the first American women to reach Mt.
Everest's peak.

expedition's plans are flexible. "You
could sit for two weeks at base camp
waiting for the weather just to let you
go between camps. You can get stuck
part way up the mountain," she said.
"There's a lot of luck involved.
There's also a lot of luck involved in
how people fare at altitude. What
sickness means at those altitudes is
that people have to stay at base camp
or go back down to a lower altitude,"
she added.
However, she was optimistic about
the team's chances. "An American
woman has yet to make it to the sum
mit, and an American team of women
has yet to make it to the summit. So,
we might just get both accomplished."
The conditions that will confront
the team on Everest will be "really
severe climatically," and disasterous
results are possible because of
"fatigue and the chance of making a
big error," according to Lapham.
Collins, who graduated from Stan
ford Medical School in 1977, will
serve as one of two doctors for the
team. Now the director of the emer
gency department at the Lander
Medical Center in Wyoming, she has
climbed in the Teton Range in
Wyoming as well as in Europe, Africa
and Asia, and she was expedition
doctor for the 1980 American
Women's Expedition to Dhaulagiri I,
a 26,000 foot Himalayan peak.
The specialized equipment that the
team will be using on Everest is
"pretty good," according to Lapham,
though she added she worries her feet
"are going to get pretty darn cold."
"The gear has improved a lot. And,
in fact, one of the things an expedi
tion offers to the world and also to
manufacturers ... is an opportunity
to improve on the technology," Lap
ham said.
Of the $500,000 the expedition is
trying to raise through corporate and
individual contributions, Lapham
said air freight, oxygen supplies and
specialized clothing are the most
costly. Shipping 15 to 20 tons of
equipment and air fare for the team
will cost about $90,000; specialized
oxygen equipment to be used at high
altitude will cost about $20,000; and
clothing about $4,000 per climber.
Stanford alumnae have a history of
firsts. Sally Ride was the first U.S.
woman in space and Sandra Day
O'Connor was the first woman on the
U.S. Supreme Court.
And in October, three former
Stanford students may achieve yet
another first. Heidi Benson, Kathryn
Collins and Ellen Lapham may
become the first American women to
climb to the 29,028-foot summit of
Mt. Everest, the world's highest peak.
Five women have stood on the
summit before — one each from
Japan, China and Poland and two
from Germany — but no American
woman has climbed above 28,000
feet, explained Lapham, who
received her MBA from Stanford in
1977.
To all three Stanford graduates,
and the rest of the 18-member team
which includes two other women, the
climb is worth the danger of the
avalanches, crevasses, human error,
minus-30-degree cold, 100-mile-an
hour winds, extreme altitudes and
bland food that an Everest expedition
must confront. According to Benson,
a 1983 graduate in anthropology, one
of every 10 climbers in the Himalayas
has perished.
Lapham said the possibility of be
coming the first American woman on
the summit of Everest makes the ex

pedition worth the risk. At 42, Lap
ham would also be the oldest woman
to ever reach the summit.
"I'm on this team because this is in
spirational. It's inspirational to me,
but 1 know there are a lot of other
women who would like to do things
that are out of the ordinary and diffi
cult — and it doesn't have to be
climbing Everest," said Lapham, who
now lives and trains full-time in Por
tola Valley.
Lapham, who is trying to raise most
of the $500,000 needed for the ex
pedition, said she will serve mostly as
a support climber, carrying loads of
equipment in for those who are estab
lishing the route further up the moun
tain.
However, she added, "I am one of
five women who might make it to the
summit, though I believe that the
other women on the team, two of
whom have much more high altitude
experience, have a much better shot
at being on the first summit teams. So
I might make it in a follow-on team,"
Lapham said. She explained that two
or three climbers at a time will try for
the summit once a camp is established
high on the mountain.
"But obviously, once you get on
the mountain and everyone proves
out how they're doing, you pick the
strongest people to go for the sum
mit. .. . And if I'm really strong —
and I'm working out to be strong —
I'm going to go for the top if at all

possible," she added. Last spring,
Lapham nearly reached the summit
of the 20,300-foot Himalayan peak,
Imja Tse.
Benson is one of those who have
had some considerable high-altitude
experience. She was a member of an
unsuccessful Everest ascent last
spring. "You really can't tell in ad :
vance " Benson said. "I'm keeprfig" v
my fingers crossed. I felt real good on
the last expedition. I also just want to
be part of the expedition that gets the
first (American) woman to the top."
Everest, a massive rock pyramid
straddling the boarder between Nepal
and Tibet, was first climbed in 1953

by an English team. Americans first
achieved the summit in 1963, and the
first woman successfully scaled the
mountain in 1973.
Benson, who is coordinating the
expedition in Salt Lake City, said the
logistics of planning the trip are far
more terrifying than the mountain it
self. Among her responsibilities are
keeping expedition members in

food and "dealing with the countries"
through which the expedition will
travel. Benson said.

results are possible because of
"fatigue and the chance of making a
big error," according to Lapham.
Collins, who graduated from Stan
ford Medical School in 1977, will
serve as one of two doctors for the
team. Now the director of the emer
gency department at the Lander
Medical Center in Wyoming, she has
climbed in the Teton Range in
Wyoming as well as in Europe, Africa
and Asia, and she was expedition
doctor for the 1980 American
Women's Expedition to Dhaulagiri I,
a 26,000 foot Himalayan peak.
The specialized equipment that the
team will be using on Everest is
"pretty good," according to Lapham,
though she added she worries her feet
"are going to get pretty darn cold."
"The gear has improved a lot. And,
in fact, one of the things an expedi
tion offers to the world and also to
manufacturers ... is an opportunity
to improve on the technology," Lap
ham said.
Of the $500,000 the expedition is
trying to raise through corporate and
individual contributions, Lapham
said air freight, oxygen supplies and
specialized clothing are the most
costly. Shipping 15 to 20 tons of
equipment and air fare for the team
will cost about $90,000; specialized
oxygen equipment to be used at high
altitude will cost about $20,000; and
clothing about $4,000 per climber.
Stanford alumnae have a history of
firsts. Sally Ride was the first U.S.
woman in space and Sandra Day
O'Connor was the first woman on the
U.S. Supreme Court.
And in October, three former
Stanford students may achieve yet
another first. Heidi Benson, Kathryn
Collins and Ellen Lapham may
become the first American women to
climb to the 29,028-foot summit of
Mt. Everest, the world's highest peak.
Five women have stood on the
summit before — one each from
Japan, China and Poland and two
from Germany — but no American
woman has climbed above 28,000
feet, explained Lapham, who
received her MBA from Stanford in
1977.
To all three Stanford graduates,
and the rest of the 18-member team
which includes two other women, the
climb is worth the danger of the
avalanches, crevasses, human error,
minus-30-degree cold, 100-mile-an
hour winds, extreme altitudes and
bland food that an Everest expedition
must confront. According to Benson,
a 1983 graduate in anthropology, one
of every 10 climbers in the Himalayas
has perished.
Lapham said the possibility of be
coming the first American woman on
the summit of Everest makes the ex

pedition worth the risk. At 42, Lap
ham would also be the oldest woman
to ever reach the summit.
"I'm on this team because this is in
spirational. It's inspirational to me,
but 1 know there are a lot of other
women who would like to do things
that are out of the ordinary and diffi
cult — and it doesn't have to be
climbing Everest," said Lapham, who
now lives and trains full-time in Por
tola Valley.
Lapham, who is trying to raise most
of the $500,000 needed for the ex
pedition, said she will serve mostly as
a support climber, carrying loads of
equipment in for those who are estab
lishing the route further up the moun
tain.
However, she added, "I am one of
five women who might make it to the
summit, though I believe that the
other women on the team, two of
whom have much more high altitude
experience, have a much better shot
at being on the first summit teams. So
I might make it in a follow-on team,"
Lapham said. She explained that two
or three climbers at a time will try for
the summit once a camp is established
high on the mountain.
"But obviously, once you get on
the mountain and everyone proves
out how they're doing, you pick the
strongest people to go for the sum
mit. .. . And if I'm really strong —
and I'm working out to be strong —
I'm going to go for the top if at all

possible," she added. Last spring,
Lapham nearly reached the summit
of the 20,300-foot Himalayan peak,
Imja Tse.
Benson is one of those who have
had some considerable high-altitude
experience. She was a member of an
unsuccessful Everest ascent last
spring. "You really can't tell in ad :
vance " Benson said. "I'm keeprfig" v
my fingers crossed. I felt real good on
the last expedition. I also just want to
be part of the expedition that gets the
first (American) woman to the top."
Everest, a massive rock pyramid
straddling the boarder between Nepal
and Tibet, was first climbed in 1953

by an English team. Americans first
achieved the summit in 1963, and the
first woman successfully scaled the
mountain in 1973.
Benson, who is coordinating the
expedition in Salt Lake City, said the
logistics of planning the trip are far
more terrifying than the mountain it
self. Among her responsibilities are
keeping expedition members in
formed, soliciting free equipment and
food and "dealing with the countries"
through which the expedition will
travel. Benson said.
"The worst part is the planning. It's
more horrifying dealing with every
thing ahead of time. . . . One in 10

climbers who go to the Himalayas
dies, but you never think it's going to
be you."
Lapham added that the sense of
team camaraderie among moun
taineers is another reason she joined
the climb. "A lot of climbers I've
talked to have said the same thing:
'We got off the mountain. We may or
may not have made the summit, but
what's wonderful is that we're all still
friends,' " she said. "I've heard that
from . . . some of the top moun
taineers . . . and I've heard it from
people who have been on their first
major expedition.
"It's not just this quest to go throw
yourself against the top of the moun
tain. It's also a very human team en
deavor," Lapham added.
The expedition members are plan
ning to fly from San Francisco to
Beijing, China on Aug. 1. There, the
expedition will clear its equipment
through customs before traveling to
Cheng Du by train in order to see the
Chinese countryside, Benson said.
From Cheng Du, the expedition
will fly to Lhasa — a town 12,500 feet
high in the Tibetan Himalayas —
where some of the members of the
expedition will test the hang gliding
equipment they hope to use on
Everest, Lapham said. The hang
gliding permit issued to the expedi
tion by the Chinese government is the
first such permission ever granted,
she added.

The expedition will then make a
week-long bus journey along a mili
tary access road to the spot where it
will establish base camp, about 9,000
vertical feet below the summit of
Everest, Lapham said.
"By that time, we'll be in the third
week of the expedition, and we'll
spend the next five weeks establishing
(five or six) camps," progressively
higher on the mountain, Lapham ex
plained.
Once on the mountain, the clim
bers plan to ascend to the North Col,
a saddle in a ridge which connects
Everest with a neighboring mountain,
and then to choose between the
North Face and the North Ridge as a
final route to the summit, Benson
said.
In addition to the 18 members of
the team, 19 Sherpas, natives of the
Nepalese Himalayas who have
become extremely adept at assisting
Western expeditions, will help with
climbing and ferrying loads between
camps.
If all goes according to plan, sum
mit bids will take place in the second
or third week of October and, "If
we're sucessful on the summit, then
we'll stick around long enough to
send other teams to the top and then
go back down," according to Lap
ham.
Lapham, however, stressed that the



Stanford alumnae Kathyrn Collins (left), Heidi Benson (above) and El
len Lapham hope to be the first American women to reach Mt.
Everest's peak.

expedition's plans are flexible. "You
could sit for two weeks at base camp
waiting for the weather just to let you
go between camps. You can get stuck
part way up the mountain," she said.
"There's a lot of luck involved.
There's also a lot of luck involved in
how people fare at altitude. What
sickness means at those altitudes is
that people have to stay at base camp
or go back down to a lower altitude,"
she added.
However, she was optimistic about
the team's chances. "An American
woman has yet to make it to the sum
mit, and an American team of women
has yet to make it to the summit. So,
we might just get both accomplished."
The conditions that will confront
the team on Everest will be "really
severe climatically," and disasterous
results are possible because of
"fatigue and the chance of making a
big error," according to Lapham.
Collins, who graduated from Stan
ford Medical School in 1977, will
serve as one of two doctors for the
team. Now the director of the emer
gency department at the Lander
Medical Center in Wyoming, she has
climbed in the Teton Range in
Wyoming as well as in Europe, Africa
and Asia, and she was expedition
doctor for the 1980 American
Women's Expedition to Dhaulagiri I,
a 26,000 foot Himalayan peak.
The specialized equipment that the
team will be using on Everest is
"pretty good," according to Lapham,
though she added she worries her feet
"are going to get pretty darn cold."
"The gear has improved a lot. And,
in fact, one of the things an expedi
tion offers to the world and also to
manufacturers ... is an opportunity
to improve on the technology," Lap
ham said.
Of the $500,000 the expedition is
trying to raise through corporate and
individual contributions, Lapham
said air freight, oxygen supplies and
specialized clothing are the most
costly. Shipping 15 to 20 tons of
equipment and air fare for the team
will cost about $90,000; specialized
oxygen equipment to be used at high
altitude will cost about $20,000; and
clothing about $4,000 per climber.
