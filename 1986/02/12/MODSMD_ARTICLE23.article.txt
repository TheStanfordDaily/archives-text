# A 						textual look at the Bookstore
## 
### ANDREA ARNOLD 
With tuition as high as it is, the last
thing most students want to do is
spend another $200 on books. We
complain and gnash our teeth, hut
seldom do we look at it from another
point of view: the Stanford
Bookstore's.
In spite of its high costs, the
Bookstore is actually a nonprofit or
ganization. According to Phil
Chiaramonte, assistant general
manager of the Bookstore, the
markup on most textbooks is about
20 percent. That means if the pub
lisher sets the list price for a textbook
at $10, the Bookstore pays $8 for the
book. Chiaramonte noted that occa
sionally a publisher will offer a dis
count — perhaps 40 percent off list
price — and the Bookstore still sells
the books at list price.
According to Chiaramonte, most of
the Bookstore's 20 percent textbook
profit margin goes toward freight
costs. "Although we do have return
privileges with the publishers, we still
have to pay freight back," he noted.
Other profit goes back to the stu
dent in the form of a rebate.
For the past couple of years, stu
dents have received rebates of 14 to
15 percent of their total textbook
purchases. "We have spent over $1
million in the past three years on
rebates," Chiaramonte said.
Of course, not all of the rebates
come from the profits made on
textbooks. According to comptroller
Patrick McDonald, textbooks ac
count for only about 30 percent of the
Bookstore's sales. The other 70 per
cent includes the sale of tradebooks,
supplies, clothing, souvenirs, cards
and other merchandise. There is
about a 40 percent mark-up on these
items.
Even with the Bookstore's low
textbook mark-up, however, the cost
of many textbooks is quite high.
Chiaramonte explained that the mar
ketplace often has a greater say in de
termining a textbook's price than

anything else.
Chiaramonte pointed out that
when a professor decides that he or
she wants to use a certain book for a
class, the Bookstore must go to the
publisher and place the order. "You
know, publishers are in a unique sit
uation," he said. "If a prof wants a
book, the Bookstore must carry it."
Chiaramonte also noted that a pub
lisher can set any price for a book be
cause students are required to buy it.
"I suppose it is a sort of monopolistic
trade," he conceded.
The Bookstore has also reduced
the amount of space allotted to
textbooks on the store floor this year.
Chiaramonte explained that since the
textbook floor space is used only the
first three weeks of each quarter, the
store devised a system of putting the
textbook fixtures on wheels. At the
beginning of each quarter, the
textbooks are wheeled out onto the
floor. Then, as the textbooks sell out,
they are moved to the back shelves
and are consolidated with other aca
demic books.
Chiaramonte said this allows for a
more efficient use of space, as well as
a larger book selection.
The Bookstore is also looking into
the possibility of relocating in order
to increase its space, according to
Chiaramonte. He said Bookstoore
management is presently studying the
feasibility of moving into a site that
would be part of Stanford's planned
Near West development.
"I would say (that a possible
relocation) is a little beyond the
rumor stage, into the investigation
stage," Chiaramonte said. A commit
tee has been appointed to investigate
the advantages and disadvantages of
such a relocation.
"We presently carry about 125,000
book titles in this store,"
Chiaramonte said. "With the
(proposed) new store, we could carry
between 400,000 to 500,000 titles.
This would be another step in our ef
fort to become the biggest and the
best bookstore in the country."
