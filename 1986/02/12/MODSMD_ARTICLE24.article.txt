The first question you have to ask about these
books — the first four volumes of the "Pantheon
Photo Library" — is, why own them?
They're too small to be useful for study — the page
size is only five by seven-and-a-half inches, and be
cause the books are perfect-bound (cut and glued,
rather than stitched), the pages won't lie flat. And a
photographer like Eugene Atget, who was concerned
with detail and whose negatives were 50 percent
larger than the plates in these books, loses much of
his impact when his photographs are shrunk.
These books resemble nothing so much as the tiny
volumes put out by French and German publishers
which contain the entire oeuvre of famous artists —
every painting by Matisse or Chagall, reproduced in
matchbook size. If the Pantheon photo volumes were
this exhaustive, they would have a purpose, but none
of them contains more than 63 plates, so they're not
useful as reference works, either.

The answer, of course, is the price. Photography
books are a major weapon on the battlefield of com
petitive taste, and at $6.95 these volumes represent
the cheapest way yet to get names like Atget and
Cartier-Bresson on your bookshelf or coffee table.
The standard book editions of these photographers'
works — the Museum of Modern Art's Atget series
(788 photographs in four volumes), Delpire's
Cartier-Bresson collection, Aperture's edition of
Frank's "The Americans," MOMA's Walker Evans
and Dorothea Lange monographs — start at $40-
$50. If you don't feel like spending that much on

books, fine. But if you're really interested in photog
raphy, you'd be better off going to a library than
shelling out seven bucks for these paperbacks.
Reinforcing the impression that this series is meant
more for the ego than the eye is the selection of pho
tographers. The first four volumes represent four of
the most popular, widely known and accessible of
"art" photographers (one could argue about Frank's
accessibility, but not his popularity); they have no
other discernible connection. Wouldn't it be more fit
ting for a "photo library" to proceed historically, per
haps, or at least to mix in some lesser known, but
equally deserving, photographers right at the start?

The books, done in matching black covers with
white type, are striking in their own right, and will en
hance most living rooms. They are manufactured in
France under the auspices of the National Center for
Photography, and are the American version of a se
ries already published in France. The introductory es
says appear to suffer from the vagaries of a project
lacking any strong central conception other than the
urge to sell books. The Atget book is prefaced by a
rambling, poorly translated scholarly disquisition on
Atget's relation to the Surrealists and the social di
mension of his work (it has one); the "Photographers
of the Depression" volume by a dry recounting of the
history of the FSA photo unit, which tells us next to
nothing about the individual photographers; Cartier-
Bresson gets a romantic gush about the "eye and the
heart"; and the Frank volume begins with nothing but
a two-page Beat-style essay by Frank himself. Each
of these is fine on its own terms, but shouldn't a
"photo library" be a bit more uniform and attempt to
give one some sort of overall perspective from which
to look at the photographs?
It must be said that there is an alternative to the
Pantheon Photo Library. This series is obviously
meant to undersell the Aperture History of Photogra
phy Series, more than 20 volumes of which have
already been published by Aperture of Millerton,
New York. The Aperture books, which are hardcover
and slightly larger, sell for $12.50. They aren't any
more inclusive than the Pantheon volumes, but they
present the photographs more attractively, are easier
to look at and contain uniformly excellent essays.
(And they look even better on the shelf.) All in all,
you'd be better off spending the extra $6.

The first question you have to ask about these
books — the first four volumes of the "Pantheon
Photo Library" — is, why own them?
They're too small to be useful for study — the page
size is only five by seven-and-a-half inches, and be
cause the books are perfect-bound (cut and glued,
rather than stitched), the pages won't lie flat. And a
photographer like Eugene Atget, who was concerned
with detail and whose negatives were 50 percent
larger than the plates in these books, loses much of
his impact when his photographs are shrunk.
These books resemble nothing so much as the tiny
volumes put out by French and German publishers
which contain the entire oeuvre of famous artists —
every painting by Matisse or Chagall, reproduced in
matchbook size. If the Pantheon photo volumes were
this exhaustive, they would have a purpose, but none
of them contains more than 63 plates, so they're not
useful as reference works, either.

The answer, of course, is the price. Photography
books are a major weapon on the battlefield of com
petitive taste, and at $6.95 these volumes represent
the cheapest way yet to get names like Atget and
Cartier-Bresson on your bookshelf or coffee table.
The standard book editions of these photographers'
works — the Museum of Modern Art's Atget series
(788 photographs in four volumes), Delpire's
Cartier-Bresson collection, Aperture's edition of
Frank's "The Americans," MOMA's Walker Evans
and Dorothea Lange monographs — start at $40-
$50. If you don't feel like spending that much on

books, fine. But if you're really interested in photog
raphy, you'd be better off going to a library than
shelling out seven bucks for these paperbacks.
Reinforcing the impression that this series is meant
more for the ego than the eye is the selection of pho
tographers. The first four volumes represent four of
the most popular, widely known and accessible of
"art" photographers (one could argue about Frank's
accessibility, but not his popularity); they have no
other discernible connection. Wouldn't it be more fit
ting for a "photo library" to proceed historically, per
haps, or at least to mix in some lesser known, but
equally deserving, photographers right at the start?

The books, done in matching black covers with
white type, are striking in their own right, and will en
hance most living rooms. They are manufactured in
France under the auspices of the National Center for
Photography, and are the American version of a se
ries already published in France. The introductory es
says appear to suffer from the vagaries of a project
lacking any strong central conception other than the
urge to sell books. The Atget book is prefaced by a
rambling, poorly translated scholarly disquisition on
Atget's relation to the Surrealists and the social di
mension of his work (it has one); the "Photographers
of the Depression" volume by a dry recounting of the
history of the FSA photo unit, which tells us next to
nothing about the individual photographers; Cartier-
Bresson gets a romantic gush about the "eye and the
heart"; and the Frank volume begins with nothing but
a two-page Beat-style essay by Frank himself. Each
of these is fine on its own terms, but shouldn't a
"photo library" be a bit more uniform and attempt to
give one some sort of overall perspective from which
to look at the photographs?
It must be said that there is an alternative to the
Pantheon Photo Library. This series is obviously
meant to undersell the Aperture History of Photogra
phy Series, more than 20 volumes of which have
already been published by Aperture of Millerton,
New York. The Aperture books, which are hardcover
and slightly larger, sell for $12.50. They aren't any
more inclusive than the Pantheon volumes, but they
present the photographs more attractively, are easier
to look at and contain uniformly excellent essays.
(And they look even better on the shelf.) All in all,
you'd be better off spending the extra $6.
