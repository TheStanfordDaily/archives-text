### JONATHAN TREITEL 
"The Mantle of the Prophet"
Roy Mottahedeh
Simon & Schuster, New York, 1985
In the late spring of 1978, while the
Shah's police were firing on a crowd
in the holy city of Qom, a professor of
Middle Eastern studies at Princeton
named Roy Mottahedeh was
promenading beneath the pseudo-
Gothic arches of the Princeton
campus. At his side was a visitor from
Iran who had studied at a religious
seminary in Qom. The two men were
chatting pleasantly.
"How," asked Mottahedeh, "does
one become a mullah?"
"One begins by learning grammar,
rhetoric and logic."
Mottahedeh instantly recognized
these three subjects as the classical
trivium: the basis of the scholastic
curriculum as it was taught through
out medieval and renaissance
Europe. Thrilled at this discovery of
the unity of Western and Eastern aca
demic life, Mottahedeh retired to his
book-lined office and set about
studying the intellectual antecedents
of Iranian Islam. He spent the next
two years immersed in this work.
Meanwhile, hundreds of demonstra
tors were shot on the streets of
Teheran, the Shah flew out in a
Boeing 747 and Ayatollah Khomeini
flew in.
Mottahedeh's novel, "The Mantle
of the Prophet", is not really a

"novel" in the traditional mold.
There is no climactic plot, no thrilling
car chase and no romantic interest. It
is the biography — interspersed with
factual commentary — of a non
existent Ayatollah called Ali Has
hemi. The hero is born in Qom,
studies Islamic law and methods of
interpretation, becomes a mullah and
is briefly imprisoned by the Shah. But
by the end of the novel, after the
revolution, he is back in Qom with his
nose still in his books.
As a good professor, Mottahedeh
believes in two virtues: social con
science and intellectual earnestness.
His purpose in writing the book was
to demonstrate that these qualities
are honored in Qom just as they are
in Princeton. So Mottahedeh in
vented two symmetrical characters:
Ali Hashemi, who through a study of
Islamic thought comes to support po
litical action against the Shah, and his
friend Parviz, a political activist who
comes to support Islam as a way of
uniting the nation and obtaining so
cial justice.
Through their discussions and the
author's commentary, the reader
comes to understand the fascination
of Islamic academic life and the moti
vation of Iranian revolutionaries.
Unfortunately, the United States
and Iran have more in common than
civil virtues. Princeton is located in
New Jersey, which — so its license
plates proclaim — is The Garden
State. Curious as this may seem to
anyone who has driven along the New

Jersey Turnpike, it reflects an age
long American dream. The first
Puritan settlers along the lush Atlan
tic coast saw it as a paradise; some
even claimed the Garden of Eden was
located there. But there is no Eden
without a Serpent. In the standard

Christian manner, the Puritans lo
cated the Serpent in the souls of the
native Indians, and they set about
converting and/or killing them.
The idea that Satan is somewhere
"out there," just beyond the edge of
the woods, is a fixture in the Ameri
can psyche. To this day, American
politicians seek to locate Satan in
Moscow or Havana or — since 1978
— Teheran. According to Khomeini,

however, it was the United States that
was "The Great Satan."
Ironically, both "paradise" and
"Satan" are ideas that are imported
from Iran. Etymologically,
"paradise" derives from the Persian
word for garden. The Iranian image

of perfection as a verdant oasis
colored the Christian visualization of
Heaven. Satan, too, is an Iranian citi
zen. He swaggered into Judaism and
Christianity from Zoroastrianism, the
religion of pre-Islamic Iran. The
Zoroastrians saw the world as the
product of a struggle between Light
and Darkness.
A millennium after Alexander the
Great conquered Persia, the Muslim

Arabs repeated the feat, battling
along the same trade routes. Modern
Iran still has much in common with
ancient Greece. The bazaar and bath
houses of Teheran are political rally
ing points and debating halls, just like
the agora and public baths where
Socrates and Plato used to hang out.
The Iranian version of Satan is a
hybrid of the Hellenic and the
Zoroastrian one. The Greeks
believed we each have a personal
demon-, a private devil who infuriates
us and inspires us to creativity. In
Iranian tradition, there is a fragment
of Satan within us all. This is the cru
cial difference between American
and Iranian devil worship. Americans
locate Satan outside themselves,
across the border or on the wrong
side of the railroad tracks, but
Iranians feel the need to punish
themselves to become purified.
Most Iranians belong to the Shi'a
sect of Islam. These are the followers
of Ali, the son-in-law of Mohammed.
Ali's son, Hosain, was killed in battle,
and the anniversary of Hosain's death
is still celebrated by Shi'as with a kind
of Passion Play. Hosain is threatened
by the wicked Shemr. The audience
weeps and beats themselves and cries
out in pain. At the moment in the
play when Hosain knows he is going
to die, the actor puts on a white
shroud. In December 1978, when
young men stepped out on the streets
of Teheran in defiance of the Shah's
curfew and knew they would be shot,
they too wore white shrouds.

It is this yearning for penitence and
martyrdom that draws so many
Iranians to volunteer to fight in the
pointless war against Iraq. It also
makes Iranians revel in the hatred
they inspire in the West. And, in a
weird form of suicide, it causes
Iranians to murder those other
Iranians who can be interpreted as
evil versions of themselves, especially
the Bahai who are seen as heretical
Muslims.
Mottahedeh's fictional Ayatollah,
Ali Hashemi, is possibly based on a
real one, Ayatollah Taleqani. In the
novel, Parviz quotes Taleqani: "My
message is shared consultation and
martyrdom."
Hashemi replies: "(Taleqani) told
me he thought the perfect death
would be to die defending someone
oppressed." So the penitential urge
can be a force for good as well as evil.
There is an Islamic tradition which
says that the highest form of love is
the detachment from self as exhibited
by Abraham when he was about to
slay his son Isaac (or Ishmael, in the
Koranic version of the legend). But
the whole point of the story is that
Abraham did not kill his son. One
hopes that Iran also finds some way
of destroying its Satan without
destroying itself.
Americans too should dispose of
their image of the Iranians as a bunch
of devilish barbarians. It is hard to
think of a better way than by reading
this fascinating and elegantly written
book.
