## Archaeologists dig up the distant past on the farm 
### DAVID LIPPEATT Editorial staff 
Have you ever dreamed of discovering a lost city or the
ancient artifacts of a long-gone culture? A group of Stan
ford archaeologists has done just that and quite literally in
Stanford's own back yard.
On university land along a creek bed between the Wil
low Creek Apartments and Children's Hospital (north of
Sand Hill Road), scientists have recently discovered the
remains of an extensive Native American village which
could date back more than 4,000 years.
Barbara Bocek, a doctoral candidate in anthropology
here and the primary director of the excavation, described
the dig as fairly large, covering about eight acres. "It's real
complicated," she said. "The finds extend between 100
and 200 feet out from the creek bed and (some distance)
along it. It's a series of sites — some on the surface, some
deeper."
In recognition of the importance of the discoveries,
Prof. Harumi Befu, chairman of the Anthropology Depart
ment, asked Stanford to halt development on all Univer
sity land within 500 feet of San Francisquito Creek (where
the site is) and on all other creek beds running through
University property.
Stanford officials have agreed to postpone development
and set up a task force to study the matter.
John Rick, assistant professor of anthropology, said
that what has been found to date is primarily prehistoric
refuse — animal bones, carbonized plant materials and
fire-cracked rock (which had been used to heat water).
Various stone tools such as projectile points and scrapers
have also been uncovered .
Initial work on the area began in 1980, but major new
discoveries were made in September. Two complete
burials of Native Americans have been discovered, both
deep down in the soil. One of these has been dated to
around the year 1000 A.D. Other material has revealed
an age of 2,000 years. Bocek expects that the deepest ma
terial, found about 21 feet under the surface, will show an
age of 4,000 to 5,000 years when it is properly analyzed.
Rick explained how material from the dig may reveal a
changing pattern of land ase by early people in the Bay

Area. The diggers are fortunate, he said, because sedi
ment at the site appears to have been laid down rapidly in
the past. This means that the layers of material were cov
ered up quickly before they could be jumbled up too
much by rodents burrowing through the topsoil. The
layers are also widely separated, which allows the ar
chaeologists to more clearly connect a certain settlement
pattern with the environmental conditions extant in the
Bay Area at that particular time.
The long sequence of habitation at the site is unusual

for California, and it affords the Stanford scientists a
unique opportunity to see how the early residents of this
area changed their lifestyles in response to a changing en
vironment — whether the food they ate, for example,
varied with the climate.
"We're trying to plug this site into an overall scheme of
how they used this landscape," Rick said, adding that they
are also looking for seasonal patterns. "We want to know
when were people in what (climatic) zone at what time of
year."

Bocek and a digging staff of approximately 25 students
and faculty have used a number of techniques to find arti
facts and investigate the layout of the site. Originally, they
just collected and noted the position of objects on the
surface. Then they began troweling and shoveling out
three-by-six-foot rectangles of earth, extending several
feet down.
In October, a hydraulic rig was brought in to drill holes
up to 21 feet deep. These holes are 100 feet apart in a grid
pattern. Some of them were later expanded until their
openings were three square feet in size. The work is
"exciting, (but) not always so glamorous," according to
Toby MacCary, one of the students involved in the proj
ect.
Rick said the Stanford officials working with the ar
chaeologists have been "really responsive." A task force
chaired by Statistics Prof. Lincoln Moses has been
meeting for two hours each week to weigh the needs of
the archaeologists and the scientific community at large
versus Stanford's need to build new housing for faculty
and staff.
The current excavation lies in a 45-acre section of land
earmarked for the University's proposed 1,100-unit Stan
ford West housing development. The 500-foot boundary
asked by the archaeologists to limit development would
leave only 14.2 acres of this area for Stanford West.
Rick and Bocek both felt the land can and should be
shared. The bigger question, in Bocek's opinion, is one of
accommodation and adjustment, not whether develop
ment will occur.
The report of the task force, which should be issued in a
few months, will, in addition to offering a recommenda
tion on the Stanford West site, set a general Stanford
policy on the question of archaeological versus institu
tional needs. This will allow for smoother decision
making should a similar situation arise in the future.
And how about the dig? In the spring, Bocek plans to
open up an entire layer, possibly measuring 60 feet across.
She hopes this may reveal the remains of some of the
hearths and even the dwellings that made up the village.
Rick's class, "Archaeological Fieldwork Methods"
(Anthropology 091), will also work on the site. There is
still much that needs to be done.
"It's a lifetime of work out there," Bocek said.
