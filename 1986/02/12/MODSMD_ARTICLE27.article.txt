# Scholar sees possibility of losing tropical species
## 
### 
Approximately one-fifth of all
species of organisms on earth are at
risk of becoming extinct during the
next 10 to 30 years, and if they disap
pear, their potential benefit to
mankind will die with them, accord
ing to Peter Raven, director of the
Missouri Botanical Garden.
A former Stanford faculty member,
Raven is one of the world's leading
tropical biologists, and in 1985 he
was named a Mac Arthur Foundation
fellow. He delivered his warning to
the Winter Colloquium on Popula
tion Studies here Jan. 29.
Not since the end of the Cretaceous

"Unless tropical countries can achieve
social stability it doesn't matter how
much you think about conservation."

period 65 million years ago — when
dinosaurs mysteriously died — has
the world experienced extinction on
such a large scale, he said.
According to Raven, the possibility
of mass extinction is arising because,
with only two important exceptions,

all of the major tropical forests "will
basically have been clear cut within
the next 10 to 30 years," endangering
a vast array of plant and animal life.
Experts estimate that approxi
mately two-thirds of all species of or
ganisms live in the tropics and only
one-third on the rest of the planet.
Tropical forests in the western
Brazilian Amazon and the central
Congo basins are in less danger and
may survive until "the middle of the
next century if we're lucky," Raven
said.
Aerial photographs can give the
impression that tropical forests are

vast areas of monotonous vegetation,
but according to Raven, they contain
organisms that are "far more abun
dant and diverse and engage in far
more complex interactions than or
ganisms in any other part of the
world."

The majority of these organisms
remain undiscovered and unnamed,
he added.
Compared to plants and animals in
the temperate zones, "we know vir
tually nothing" about tropical or
ganisms, Raven said. "Even by the
most optimistic estimates of the
degree of our knowledge, no more
than one out of six of all kinds of
tropical organisms have even been
given a scientific name.
"There is great economic benefit
that could be gained directly for
people both in developed and devel
oping countries" by learning more
about tropical plants and animals, he
added.
Three factors are behind the
destruction of tropical forests, ac
cording to Raven: extraordinarily
rapid growth of population,
widespread poverty and ignorance
about how to manage the forests in
the long term instead of consuming
them for short-term benefit.
Conservation in the tropics is "not
hopeless" but can occur "only if
coupled with development, economic
progress and sustainability," Raven
said. He also said the governments of
tropical countries are aware of their
population problems and aware of
the need to develop sustainable
agricultural and forestry systems.
But these governments find it diffi
cult to cope with the poverty prob
lem, he said. "Unless tropical
countries can achieve social stability,
it doesn't matter how much you think
about conservation or a variety of

other things, you just can't do it."
In addition to negatively affecting
the atmosphere's carbon dioxide
supply, the elimination of tropical
forests is a problem "if you want to
think about how to manipulate tropi
cal vegetation for human purposes,"
Raven said. He advocated "enhanced
efforts" to study tropical biology
from both a scientific and economic
point of view.

Natural substances found in the
tropics are useful in modern
medicine, and they are less expensive
than synthetically manufactured
drugs.
Asked what individuals can do to
help solve the problems, Raven advo
cated promoting internationalism,
and he said it is important to under
stand the interdependency of other
countries and the United States.

Rather than focusing all efforts on
exporting food to these countries,
Raven declared that the developed
countries must help developing
countries achieve "sustainability" in
their agriculture. He suggested devel
oping better agricultural systems so
people who cut forests to create
farmland will not have to move on to
newly-cut forests as rapidly as they do
now.
