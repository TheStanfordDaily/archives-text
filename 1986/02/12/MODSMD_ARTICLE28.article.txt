## Card baseball winsâ€”by 5 touchdowns 
### CHRIS MYERS Staff Writer 
Wipe your feet. Say "Please" and "Thank you." Put your napkin in your lap.
And whatever you do, honey, don't score 35 runs.
The Stanford batsmen were extremely rude guests yesterday, marching into
Cal-State Stanislaus' Warrior Stadium and unloading their cannons for a
school record 35 runs on 34 hits.
To add insult to injury, two Cardinal freshman combined on the mound to
spin a nifty two-hitter at the host team.
When the dust cleared, the scoreboard read like a football score, 35-0, and
the bloodied and beaten Warriors probably wished they had never invited the
nationally-ranked Cardinal over.
The win raised Stanford's season mark to seven wins and three losses. The
Warriors, a Division 111 team, dropped to 2-1-1 on the year.
Things were grim from the beginning. Warrior starter Dan Schmidt was able
to retire only one Cardinal batter before crawling to the dugout with six earned
runs to his name.
And if it rained on Schmidt, it poured on the Warriors' second pitcher, Don
Cabral. He gave up 12 earned runs on 14 hits and endured a nightmare second
inning. In that frame, Cardinal center fielder Mark Davis led off with the
game's only home run and Stanford went on to pile up nine runs on seven
singles, a double, two walks, three steals and two sacrifice flies.
The Cardinal had another nine-run inning in the fourth, and then a five-run
frame in the eighth, highlighted by first baseman Paul Marca's three-run
double.
All told, Stanford sent 19 different men to the plate, compiling a .547 team
batting average in 62 at bats against five Warrior pitchers. The Warrior hurlers
walked a total of 10 batters, and, not to be outdone, the Stanislaus defense
committed five errors in the game.
Toi Cook, Doug Robbins and Ron Witmeyer had four hits each for the
Cardinal, and Robbins had six RBIs. Ten players had more than one hit for
Stanford, and nine had more than one RBI. The Cardinal had five doubles.
The run total fell just one short of the Pacific 10 Conference single-game
record of 36 set last year by Oregon State against Chico State. The NCAA
record is 41, held by both Georgia Tech and Clemson.
The offensive explosion was unexpected at best. The Cardinal was batting
.269 coming into yesterday's game and was averaging a mere 6.6 runs per
game.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess had commented before the game that he
hoped the Cardinal would improve its performance at the plate. He certainly
couldn't have been expecting yesterday's hit parade.
"It was just one of those freaky things," Marquess said. "I've never seen that
happen before, especially with only one home run in the game. It was just con
tagious, and everybody got on a roll.
"The good thing about the game, the key thing, was that we had good pitch
ing, and we played good defense," Marquess said, trying to put the game in
perspective.
The pitching was indeed excellent. Freshman righties Steve Chitren and Jim
Price kept the Warrior batters off the bases throughout the game, giving up
just one hit each and only three walks between them. Chitren started and
threw five innings, striking out six while moving his record to 1-0 for the
season.

those games. Stanford's 35-0 humiliation of Cal State-Stanislaus yester
day was only one run shy of Oregon State's Pac-10 record and six be
