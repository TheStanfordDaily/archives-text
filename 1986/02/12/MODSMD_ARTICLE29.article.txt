## Netters blank Ga. Tech in rain-shortened match 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Rain may ruin a lot of scheduled
tennis for the rest of this week, but
yesterday afternoon the No. 1-ranked
Stanford men's tennis team squeezed
a match in just ahead of the showers
to record a 5-0 victory over the visit
ing Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets.
Stanford senior John Letts finished
a comeback victory over freshman

Mike Chinchiolo to clinch the match
for Stanford only 10 minutes before
the rain began falling.
Cardinal sophomore Patrick
McEnroe posted the first Stanford
win of the day, defeating Richey Gil
bert in the No. 4 singles 6-2, 6-2.
McEnroe made fast work of Gilbert,
cruising by him in just under an hour
with solid, straightforward tennis.
In No. 1 singles, Dan Goldie of
Stanford drilled an ace to win the first

set over Georgia Tech's Bryan Shel
ton, then broke Shelton in the final
game of the match to tally a 6-4, 6-3
victory. The second set was a bit un
usual, as neither player held serve in
the final four games.
Stanford's Eric Rosenfeld wished
that the drizzle could have held off
for at least 10 more minutes. The
Cardinal senior was tied with Kenny
Thorne in a second set tie-breaker at
seven points each when the umpire
called the match due to slippery con
ditions.
Rosenfeld had won the first set 6-3,
and the two players held serve
throughout the second set to force the
tie-breaker.
"I didn't want to stop. We were
both playing well, and I had my
adrenaline going," Rosenfeld said
after the cancellation. "It was slip
pery, but not that dangerous."
Both Rosenfeld and Thorne did do
a little sliding along the baseline
during the tie-breaker.
"It's just really unsatisfying not to
finish the match," Rosenfeld said.
"It's better to either win or lose. But
anyway, 1 don't think it was a bad call
to stop the match."

Stanford 5, Georgia Tech 0
Goldie d. Shelton 6-4, 6-3
Letts d. Chinchiolo 0-6, 6-1, 6-3
McEnroe d. Gilbert 6-2, 6-2
Moody d. Simm 6-2, 6-4
Jacobson d. Paulsen 6-4, 6-2

The No. 3 singles match between
Letts and Chinchiolo could have been
stopped in the first set — not because
of rain, but because of the score.
Chinchiolo took the set 6-0, and a
sluggish Letts looked doomed.
"He (Letts) wasn't playing too
well, and it felt like he was tentative,"
Chinchiolo said.
"I wasn't moving well and I was
late setting up for some reason,"
Letts said. "I think it was a combina
tion of being nervous and not ready
to play."
The senior from Rolling Hills
somehow got himself rolling in the
second set, breaking Chinchiolo's
serve twice to take the set 6-1,
"Coach (Dick Gould) told me to
slow it down after the first set and just
get more balls in the court," Letts ex
plained. "When I did that I was
surprised at the mistakes he
(Chinchiolo) made."
Letts then completed the turn-

Despite dropping the first set to freshman Mike Chinchiolo, Stanford's
John Letts rallied to win the match 0-6, 6-1, 6-3 after he received some
advice from Coach Dick Gould, "Coach (Gould) told me to slow it down

around by taking the third set 6-3.
"One of the things 1 was most
happy about today was John's
achievement," Gould said. "He
started off poor but had the com
posure to bring himself back."
The Cardinal's Scott Moody also
rebounded from a slightly rocky start,
but he did so much more quickly.
In the first game of the fifth singles
match. Tech's Andre Simm broke
Moody's serve. Moody broke right
back in the next game and proceeded
to win the match by a 6-2, 6-4 score.
The junior punctuated his victory by
hitting a smash on match point over
the fence on court four.
In the sixth singles match. Cardinal
Mark Jacobson struggled early
against freshman George Paulsen
before taking control in the eighth
game of the first set.
"From what I saw, Mark was rush
ing himself in the first few games and
pulling off the ball too early," Gould
said. "Once he started staying on the
ball he did all right."
Jacobson won nine out of the last
11 games to win the match by a 6-4,
6-2 score.
Even though Georgia Tech did not
manage to win a match, Gould had
some good words for Yellow Jackets.
"1 was impressed with their perfor
mance. They're a young team, with
two freshman and two sophomores in
the lineup, and their scores weren't
bad," he said.
"They're better than San Jose
State, and LSU on Friday should be
even better, so we are facing a nice
progressive build up of competition,"
Gould continued.
As Gould said, Stanford meets
LSU Friday afternoon. The No. 7-
ranked Tigers will invade Stanford
for a 1:30 p.m. match.

Chinchiolo took the set 6-0, and a
sluggish Letts looked doomed.
"He (Letts) wasn't playing too
well, and it felt like he was tentative,"
Chinchiolo said.
"I wasn't moving well and I was
late setting up for some reason,"
Letts said. "I think it was a combina
tion of being nervous and not ready
to play."
The senior from Rolling Hills
somehow got himself rolling in the
second set, breaking Chinchiolo's
serve twice to take the set 6-1,
"Coach (Dick Gould) told me to
slow it down after the first set and just
get more balls in the court," Letts ex
plained. "When I did that I was
surprised at the mistakes he
(Chinchiolo) made."
Letts then completed the turn-

Despite dropping the first set to freshman Mike Chinchiolo, Stanford's
John Letts rallied to win the match 0-6, 6-1, 6-3 after he received some
advice from Coach Dick Gould, "Coach (Gould) told me to slow it down
after the first set and just get more balls in the court," Letts said.
around by taking the third set 6-3.
"One of the things 1 was most
happy about today was John's
achievement," Gould said. "He
started off poor but had the com
posure to bring himself back."
The Cardinal's Scott Moody also
rebounded from a slightly rocky start,
but he did so much more quickly.
In the first game of the fifth singles
match. Tech's Andre Simm broke
Moody's serve. Moody broke right
back in the next game and proceeded
to win the match by a 6-2, 6-4 score.
The junior punctuated his victory by
hitting a smash on match point over
the fence on court four.
In the sixth singles match. Cardinal
Mark Jacobson struggled early
against freshman George Paulsen
before taking control in the eighth
game of the first set.
"From what I saw, Mark was rush
ing himself in the first few games and
pulling off the ball too early," Gould
said. "Once he started staying on the
ball he did all right."
Jacobson won nine out of the last
11 games to win the match by a 6-4,
6-2 score.
Even though Georgia Tech did not
manage to win a match, Gould had
some good words for Yellow Jackets.
"1 was impressed with their perfor
mance. They're a young team, with
two freshman and two sophomores in
the lineup, and their scores weren't
bad," he said.
"They're better than San Jose
State, and LSU on Friday should be
even better, so we are facing a nice
progressive build up of competition,"
Gould continued.
As Gould said, Stanford meets
LSU Friday afternoon. The No. 7-
ranked Tigers will invade Stanford
for a 1:30 p.m. match.

Eric Rosenfeld was the only Stanford singles player not to win yesterday against Georgia Tech, but not be
cause he was overcome by opponent Kenny Thome. With the score 6-3, 6-6 in Rosenfeld's favor, the match
was cancelled because of slippery court conditions.
Rain may ruin a lot of scheduled
tennis for the rest of this week, but
yesterday afternoon the No. 1-ranked
Stanford men's tennis team squeezed
a match in just ahead of the showers
to record a 5-0 victory over the visit
ing Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets.
Stanford senior John Letts finished
a comeback victory over freshman

Mike Chinchiolo to clinch the match
for Stanford only 10 minutes before
the rain began falling.
Cardinal sophomore Patrick
McEnroe posted the first Stanford
win of the day, defeating Richey Gil
bert in the No. 4 singles 6-2, 6-2.
McEnroe made fast work of Gilbert,
cruising by him in just under an hour
with solid, straightforward tennis.
In No. 1 singles, Dan Goldie of
Stanford drilled an ace to win the first

set over Georgia Tech's Bryan Shel
ton, then broke Shelton in the final
game of the match to tally a 6-4, 6-3
victory. The second set was a bit un
usual, as neither player held serve in
the final four games.
Stanford's Eric Rosenfeld wished
that the drizzle could have held off
for at least 10 more minutes. The
Cardinal senior was tied with Kenny
Thorne in a second set tie-breaker at
seven points each when the umpire
called the match due to slippery con
ditions.
Rosenfeld had won the first set 6-3,
and the two players held serve
throughout the second set to force the
tie-breaker.
"I didn't want to stop. We were
both playing well, and I had my
adrenaline going," Rosenfeld said
after the cancellation. "It was slip
pery, but not that dangerous."
Both Rosenfeld and Thorne did do
a little sliding along the baseline
during the tie-breaker.
"It's just really unsatisfying not to
finish the match," Rosenfeld said.
"It's better to either win or lose. But
anyway, 1 don't think it was a bad call
to stop the match."
