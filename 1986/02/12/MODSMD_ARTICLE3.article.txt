A Hoover Institution senior research fel
low asked to work on a controversial AIDS
study says she has not seen a memorandum
reportedly .circulated by members, o£j&e
project calling for "mandatory and overt
identification" of AIDS victims.
In an interview yesterday, Rita Ricardo-
Campbell said that while she met "very
briefly" last fall with representatives of the
San Francisco-based group seeking funds
for the study, she will not agree to partici
pate in the study until she sees a copy of the
memo.
Sunday's San Francisco Examiner re
ported that the Advanced Investigation of
Medical Science (AIMS), an independent

resesarch organization, has submitted a
$12.5 million proposal to the military for a
study "aimed at proving AIDS is casual!},
transmitted and at devising methods to con
trol the disease that appear to be constitu
tionally questionable."
According to the Examiner.jeport, the
memo suggests a "Star r epi'—
a- reference to the symbol used by Nazi Ger
many to identify Jews — for identifying vic
tims of AIDS (Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome).
"I do not wish to work with any person
that would be interested in that sort of
thing," Ricardo-Campbell said.
However, she said the study is scientifi
cally sound, adding that there was no men
tion of a "Star of David" concept in the pro
posal of the study itself.

The project is "extraordinarily impor
tant," she said. "AIDS is the most important
health problem of the century."
Richard Staar, another Hoover senior re
search fellow approached by AIMS to par
ticipate in the study, said in an interview
Monday that "there's no project as far as

he would accept a position because it was a
hypothetical situation.
"The people came to me last fall . . . and I
never agreed to participate in anything," he
said. "The project hasn't even received
funding yet."
