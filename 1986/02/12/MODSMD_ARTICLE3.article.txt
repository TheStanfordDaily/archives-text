# Fellows downplay involvement in controversial AIDS study
## 
### ALLISON HARTWELL Editorial staff 
A Hoover Institution senior research fel
low asked to work on a controversial AIDS
study says she has not seen a memorandum
reportedly .circulated by members, o£j&e
project calling for "mandatory and overt
identification" of AIDS victims.
In an interview yesterday, Rita Ricardo-
Campbell said that while she met "very
briefly" last fall with representatives of the
San Francisco-based group seeking funds
for the study, she will not agree to partici
pate in the study until she sees a copy of the
memo.
Sunday's San Francisco Examiner re
ported that the Advanced Investigation of
Medical Science (AIMS), an independent

resesarch organization, has submitted a
$12.5 million proposal to the military for a
study "aimed at proving AIDS is casual!},
transmitted and at devising methods to con
trol the disease that appear to be constitu
tionally questionable."
According to the Examiner.jeport, the
memo suggests a "Star r epi'—
a- reference to the symbol used by Nazi Ger
many to identify Jews — for identifying vic
tims of AIDS (Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome).
"I do not wish to work with any person
that would be interested in that sort of
thing," Ricardo-Campbell said.
However, she said the study is scientifi
cally sound, adding that there was no men
tion of a "Star of David" concept in the pro
posal of the study itself.

The project is "extraordinarily impor
tant," she said. "AIDS is the most important
health problem of the century."
Richard Staar, another Hoover senior re
search fellow approached by AIMS to par
ticipate in the study, said in an interview
Monday that "there's no project as far as
>u t*flfcbiiCfeWteflHe said he "couldn't say" if
he would accept a position because it was a
hypothetical situation.
"The people came to me last fall . . . and I
never agreed to participate in anything," he
said. "The project hasn't even received
funding yet."
Staar, an expert in U.S.-Soviet relations
who served as U.S. ambassador to the
Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction
Talks from 1981 to 1983, said his
knowledge of the disease is confined
to "just what has been in the
newspapers."
Although his role in the study was
not explicitly discussed in the meeting
last fall, Staar said "I would assume I
would be involved in what was hap
pening (with AIDS) in foreign
countries."
Ricardo-Campbell said she would
be involved in "cost-benefit" analysis

of the study's impact if she decided to
join the project, noting that she pre
viously conducted economic cost
benefit analyses of the drug Tagamet,
now widely used in treatment of ul
cers.
Ricardo-Campbell denied reports
that her husband. Hoover Institution
Director W. Glenn Campbell, was in
volved in the study. "He has ab
solutely nothing to do with it," she
said.
According to A 1 Marquez, a sur
geon in private practice who serves as
an AIMS consultant, the memo was
"part of the whole project presented

to the Department of Defense."
Marquez declined to comment on
the "Star of David" principle
reportedly mentioned in the memo,
but said "30 percent of us (those
working on the project) are Jewish."
Marquez confirmed that the study
will be searching for the cause of
AIDS in the 6 percent of cases that
cannot be linked to "homosexual
sex" or blood transfusions.
"We should not ignore something
just because it doesn't taste good.
What we need is investigation" into
AIDS, Marquez said.
