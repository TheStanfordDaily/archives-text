# Long hours worth it
## Mitchell led Stanford crew to '64 gold 
### SCOTT ROTH Staff Writer 
Though early morning practice is somewhat of a
ritual for any crew team, the rowers of today have it
easy compared to how two-time Olympian and Stan
ford graduate Kent Mitchell had it.
Mitchell and his teammates were, well, on their own.
To get to practice, the crew had to lash its shell on the
roof of a car, drive to Redwood Shores, climb through
barbed wire fences and practice on its own. No boat
house. No bus. No nothing. You really had to want to
row.
For Mitchell, joining the crew team in 1957 was al
most accidental. Unlike most athletes who compete in
college, he had no experience rowing in high school.
"There was a one-unit P.E. requirement that I had
to fulfill as a freshman," Mitchell explained. "Because
of my size 1 was potentially a coxswain. Coming in, I
knew very little about crewing."
Mitchell caught on quickly though. He soon became
an integral member of the crew. In fact, he was the
team's unofficial coach.
"As the cox, you are the only one in the boat who is
able to see what's going on," Mitchell said. "It's your
responsiblity to pace the stroke and help out the
team."
While Stanford's team did not garner any major col
legiate titles, Mitchell and teammates Conn Findlay

and Ed Ferry went on to bigger and better things. The
three qualified for the 1960 Rome and 1964 Tokyo
Olympiads. Competing in the pair with coxswain divi
sion, the trio picked up a bronze medal in 1960 and
took home the gold in Tokyo.
Training for the Olympics, like rowing on the Farm,
was very individualistic. The team was on its own.
"We did all of our own training," Mitchell said. "All
of the races that we entered were 'open.' We'd put the
boat on the car and drive across the country to com
pete."
While all the rowers were pumping iron and working
out, Mitchell's chief concern was his weight, which he
had to maintain at a scant 108 pounds.
"A cox needs to be as light as possible," Mitchell
said. "It took me about eight months to get down from
130 pounds."
Mitchell then expanded his interest to coaching.
After acting as the U.S. coach, he became the fresh
man coach at Stanford in 1968. Then until 1984, he
coached in some summer programs sponsored by the
University.
"1 like to coach because I like the technical aspects
of the sport," he said. "1 like to help people to go faster
and work less — help them learn the physics of the
sport. Rowing is a clean, pure sport. Learning the tech
nique makes it really pretty."

early-morning workouts at Redwood Shores.
