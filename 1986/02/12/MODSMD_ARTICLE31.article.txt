# SJSU doesn't plan to test Cardinal
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
A rainout appears to be about
the only thing that will keep the
San Jose State women's tennis
team from being annihilated today
when it plays top-ranked Stanford.
But don't expect San Jose Coach
Lisa Beritzhoff to be conducting
any rain dances as her women take
to the Stanford tennis courts at
1:30 p.m.
"I'm just excited about playing
a No. 1 team like Stanford,"
Beritzhoff said. "I hope it doesn't
get rained out."
The Spartans finished second in
the NorPac conference last year
for the first time in the school's

history. Despite losing last year's
top player to graduation, San Jose
still figures to be stronger this
year.
"We have five new players on
the team, (but) we have more
depth this year," Beritzhoff said.
"Down the ladder, we're a
stronger team."
SJSU has won its first two
matches this season, thumping
UC-Davis 7-2 and knocking off
Hawaii 4-2 in a match called be
cause of darkness. Yet, Beritzhoff
has no delusions of the Spartans'
winning streak continuing through
this afternoon's match.
Rather, she is using the match
with the Cardinal as a measuring stick
of sorts. "I'd like to see how we can
do this year as opposed to past
years," Beritzhoff said.
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan ex
plained that San Jose is slightly better
than Santa Clara — whom the Card
inal trounced 9-0 Monday — but
does not stack up to the competition
that Stanford will be facing later this
month.
"What we try to do in the season is
build it up (the competition) match
by match," Brennan said.
As was the case in the Santa Clara
match, junior Stephanie Savides and
sophomore Kay Tittle will be the only
Cardinal regular singles players to see
action this afternoon. Sophomore
Cari Hagey, who teams with Savides
in doubles but normally does not play
singles, will play in both events today.
Junior Leigh Anne Eldredge
"definitely won't play," according to
Brennan. Eldredge, the defending
NCAA doubles champion, asked not
to practice Monday because of a few
minor physical ailments.
The Cardinal's top three singles
players — junior Patty Fendick and
freshmen Marianne Werdel and Eleni
Rossides — traveled to Boca Raton,
Fla. for this week's Lipton Interna
tional Players Championships.
