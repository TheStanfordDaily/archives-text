OAKLAND (AP) — Golden State
center Joe Barry Carroll scored 25
points, and the team with the worst
record in the NBA crushed the
defending champion Los Angeles
Lakers 137-113 Tuesday night.
Although only 16-37 this season,
the Warriors are 2-1 against the
Lakers, who lead the Pacific Division
with a 37-12 irk. Golden State had
lost 15 of its 18 games since a victory
over the Lakers in late December.
Three Golden State guards totalled
62 points. Chris Mullin had 22, Terry
Teagle had 21 and Sleepy Floyd had
19. Floyd scored 12 points and Car
roll had 11 in the third quarter when
the Warriors outscored Los Angeles
36-21 to go ahead 104-81.
The Lakers committed more than
20 turnovers on offense, had several
players in foul trouble during the
game and were charged with five
technical fouls, including two against
Coach Pat Riley.
All-Star center Kareem Abdul-
Jabbar scored 20 points in 23 minutes

of action for the Lakers. He drew his
fourth personal foul in the opening
minute of the third quarter and
played only eight minutes of the
second half. The Lakers' top scorer
was James Worthy with 21 points.
Riley drew two technical fouls in
the final minute of the first half and
was ejected from the game. He was
thrown out by referee Mike Mathis
after objecting to a call by Mathis that
nullified a Los Angeles field goal.
In another big NBA upset, the
Sacramento Kings ended the Boston
Celtics' 13-game winning streak with
a 105-100 triumph in front of a sel
lout crowd of 10,333 at Arco Arena
in Sacramento.
The game was even at halftime, but
a 33-12 tear enabled the Kings to
take an 81-60 lead after three quar
ters.
Mike Woodson led Sacramento
with 27 points, followed by Eddie
Johnson with 22 and LaSalle
Thompson with 21. Larry Bird paced
Boston with 29.
