# Golfers to face stiff opposition on Oahu
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Hawaii is the latest stop for the Stanford
men's golf team, as they open play today in the
54-hole John Burns Invitational at the Ola
Mana Golf Course in Oahu.
The Cardinal faces a competitive field led bu
USC, Arizona State, Fresno State and Okla
homa State. UCLA, Arkansas and Texas-El
Paso are also among the top teams.
"It's a very strong national field," Stanford
Coach Tim Schaaf said before the team left on
Saturday." It would be a very tough tournament
to win, but I certainly feel we can finish among
the leaders."
Schaaf had nothing but praise for OSU and its
top golfer, Scott Verplank.
"They appear to be one of the fine collegiate
teams of all time," he said. "OSU has already
won the Honda Fall Classic, which had all the
top teams — the top 15 teams in the '85 na
tionals, except Stanford."
The Cowboys accomplished that feat without
Verplank, the 1984 U.S. Amateur Champion
and the first amateur to win a major profes
sional tournament (the 1985 Western Open) in
30 years. Verplank has missed some college
tournaments, however, becuase of his playing
on the pro tour.
In addition, OSU won the Honda with only
four golfers. Normally, a team brings five gol

fers and the lowest score is thrown out, but the
Cowboys made every stroke count.
Stanford and OSU have met only once this
season, at the Southwestern tournament last
fall, with the Cardinal finishing forth behind the
tournament-winning Cowboys.
While not conceding the tournament to OSU,
Schaaf was realistic about Stanford's chances.
"Verplank has not been with the team the
whole time," Schaaf said. "If he's there they're
going to be tough.
"For anyone to beat Oklahoma State would
rank as a major upset," he said. "Every
other team is beatable."
Traveling to the Aloha State is the Cardinal
quintet of Carl Wagner, Don Walsworth, Rich
Marik, Brad Geer and Roger Miraglia.
"Carl Wagner has established himself among
the very top West Coast players," Schaaf said.
"Don Walsworth is on his way to doing the
same. Rich and Brad played very solidly this last
tournament.
"I think the outlook is kind of reminiscent of
the fall," he said. "We kept playing better and
better as we went through the fall."
Schaaf also said the squad did not have much
practice time last week, as the players had
studying to catch up on after playing in two
tournaments the previous week. However, be
cause the Cardinal played in a fund-raiser last
week, with a day of pactice before and after, it
shouldn't be too cold in Oahu.
