# Stanford struggling in Arizona tourney
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Plagued by inconsistent play, the Stanford
women's golf team ended play in Tucson
yesterday in an eighth-place tie with the last
round to be played today in the 54-hole
Arizona Intercollegiate.
The Cardinal had only one player, Trish
McGonigle, shoot under 80 yesterday on the
par-72 Randolph Golf Course as it staggered
to a team score of 321 for the day and 632
for the first 36 holes.
Arizona State, which has won its first two
tournaments of the new year, leads Arizona
with a total of 594. However, USC shot a
stellar 292 yesterday, just four strokes over
par as a team, to jump from fourth to second
and stay close to ASU at 598.
UCLA improved one stroke from Mon
day's round but fell into third place with a
score of 599. Host Arizona is in fourth place
at 608, while Texas rose from eighth place
into a fifth-place knot with New Mexico at
623.
Stanford was in seventh place after Mon
day's first round, but it trailed tournament
leader ASU by just 13 shots. However, the
Cardinal did not receive the same strong in
dividual performances yesterday.

Kathleen McCarthy, who was tied for the
individual lead with an even-par 72 on Mon
day, struggled to an 83 in the second round
which knocked her well out of the top ten.
Kay Cornelius, who was also impressive with
a 75 in the first round, shot 80 yesterday,
putting her in a tie for the team lead with
McCarthy at 155.
Julie Carmichael fired an 80 yesterday to
bring her to 162 for the first two rounds.
Kathy Kostas and McGonigle then came in
at 164, with Kostas duplicating her Monday
round of 82 and McGonigle trimming her
first-round 85 to a 79.
Defending NCAA champion Danielle
Ammaccapane of ASU let loose with a 69
yesterday to catapault her into a three-stroke
lead among the individuals at 143. UCLA's
Krystal Parker is in second and USCs Kim
Saiki and ASU's Pam Wright are tied for
fourth at 147.
Wright, a freshman, won the Desert Clas
sic last month and was tied for first in
Arizona with McCarthy after the first round.
U.S. International's Laurette Maritz, with
a pair of 745, is in fifth place, with USC's
Kim Kathreine one shot behind at 149. A
third Sun Devil, Katherine Imrie, and a
second Bruin, Jessica Posner, are tied for
seventh at 150.
