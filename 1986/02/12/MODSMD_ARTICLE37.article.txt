Charges against Walesa dropped
GDANSK, Poland, — A prosecutor dropped criminal charges of
slander against Solidarity leader Lech Walesa on the opening day of his
trial here yesterday, as the government of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski ap
peared to back down from a confrontation that had divided it internally
and threatened its campaign for acceptance abroad.
Prosecutor Raymund Blaszkowski, who had charged Walesa with
slandering officials supervising Poland's parliamentary election last Oc
tober, withdrew his case yesterday afternoon before calling the first wit
ness in a Gdansk provincial court. He said he based his action on
Walesa's statement to the court this morning that he had not intended to
slander anyone.
Walesa, who faced a sentence of up to two years in prison on the
charge, called the move "a sign of hope" and"the first step toward a
reasonable agreement" between the government and society.
"Political trials are not in the interest of Poland," he told a press con
ference. "I am happy that the authorities understood that."
Judge Jerzy Lenarcik accepted the withdrawal of criminal charges but
said that the slander case would remain open for two weeks, allowing the
election officials to file civil claims if they chose. If no claims were filed,
he said, the case would be dismissed.
The dispatch of the criminal case after a day of long delays and only
brief formal activity in the courtroom appeared to put an end to a test of
Walesa that authorities began four months ago and pressed on with
despite the public disagreement of several high officials and diplomatic
pressure that mounted after a trial date was announced last month.
S. Africa denies Mandela's release
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The South African government
yesterday squashed rumors that it could free black nationalist leader
Nelson Mandela as part of the Berlin prisoner exchange, declaring that
the Soviet Union "has not met the conditions" for Mandela's release.
"The president clearly indicated under what circumstances and condi
tions he would be prepared to release Mr. Mandela," South Arican
Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said in Cape Town in reponse to reports
indicating Mandela would soon leave jail.
The reports quoted official "Israeli sources" as saying they expected
South Africa to release Mandela and two convicted spies in the wake of
Soviet dissident Anatoly Shcharansky's departure for the West during an
East-West spy exchange in Berlin.
Coetsee recalled that President Pieter Botha, in a speech Jan. 31, held
out the possibility of freedom for the leader of the banned African Na
tional Congress. But he pointed out that Botha linked such a move to the
release by Moscow of dissident Andrei Sakharov and of captured South
African soldier Wynand Du Toit, in addition to that of Shcharansky.
"The president also made it clear that a positive response (on all three
proposed releases) could form the basis for negotiations between inter
ested governments," Coetsee said. "The position of the South African
government remains.unchanged.
"The release of Mr. Shcharansky has not met the conditions of the
state president. Mr. Mandela can therefore not be released," he said.
Iran claims to have seized Gulf port
AMMAN, Jordan — Iran said yesterday that its forces have captured
what was once Iraq's major Persian Gulf oil port in the second day of an
offensive in which both sides claimed to have inflicted heavy casualties.
Iraq immediately denied as "delirious and groundless" the Iranian
claim to have captured the port of A! Faw, which is 38 miles south of the
Iranian city of Khorramshahr. An Iraqi spokesman said A 1 Faw and an
island in the Shatt al-Arab waterway, which Iran also claimed to have
captured, are "completely under Iraqi forces control."
But the reports of Iran's advances clearly worried other Arab states on
the Gulf, particularly Kuwait, whose capital is only 50 miles from A 1
Faw and which was described by Tehran radio yesterday as a "new
neighbor" of Iran.
"Kuwait condemns and is deeply concerned by Iran's attempts to oc
cupy Iraqi territory," the oil-rich emirate said in a statement. "Its offen
sive threatens security and greatly harms countries in the region."
Kuwait is one of the prime financial backers of Iraq in its five-and
one-half-year war with Iran, which unlike the other gulf countries, is not
Arab. Kuwait and the other Persian Gulf states have been concerned for
several years that Iran's Islamic Revolution could inflame the region.
Baby Doc chose governing council
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Despite his weakened grip on power
during his final days in office, President Jean-Claude Duvalier and his
supporters virtually hand-picked the governing council that succeeded
him, sources in the former government report.
It was also disclosed yesterday that Liberia would grant political
asylum to the deposed Haitian president and his immediate family if
they request it.
A beleaguered but indecisive Duvalier agreed to leave Haiti only
when it became clear that any U.S. backing for his regime had
evaporated, the sources said this week in describing Duvalier's hasty exit
Friday.
The disclosures depict a long-running regime that quickly fell apart
when challenged with street demonstrations. They also help to explain
why the five-member council that replaced Duvalier is made up mostly
of his former supporters.
Duvalier's departure followed a week of uncertainty and in-fighting
among Haitian government officials. Their advice to him ranged from
holding fast in the face of rising public unrest, to calling for elections, to
suggesting that he flee the country.
While at least six other countries have said they would not accept him.
Liberia would grant political asylum to deposed to Duvalier and his im
mediate family if they request it, Liberian Foreign Minister Bernard
Blamo said yesterday in Monrovia, Liberia.
Blamo told Deutsche Presse-Agentur that although Duvalier had not
requested political asylum there, Liberia "will have no objection should
such request be made and forwarded to us."
Duvalier is in temporary exile in southern France after fleeing to that
country on Friday with an entourage including his wife and 22 others.
The French government allowed Duvalier to comc in with the under
standing that he leave within eight days. Even before Duvalier fled,
Switzerland, Greece and Spain said they would not accept him. Later,
Morocco and Gabon also declined.
Second day of strikes hits India
CALCUTTA. India — Life in this normally throbbing East Indian
city virtually came to a standstill yesterday after a call for a general strike
over the government's recent price hikes on essential commodities such
as food and oil.
It was the second strike in India in two days following the govern
ment's sudden decision to sharply raise prices 11 days ago.
A spokesman for the ruling leftist parties that sponsored the strike
said it was "complete and peaceful."
Buses and other vehicles were off the roads, and markets, schools and
businesses remained closed.
In addition, strike-backers blocked rail lines so that trains could not
leave or enter the city, police said.
During a day-long strike on Monday in New Delhi, more than 300
people were injured as police arrested nearly 1.400. About 300 city
buses were damaged by mobs throwing stones and demanding fare cuts.
Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi announced the price increases on
essential commodities including wheat, rice, cooking fuel, petroleum
products and fares, as a way to reduce a budget deficit of $2.8 billion.
