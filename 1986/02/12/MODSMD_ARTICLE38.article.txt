# Shcharansky released in spy swap
## 
### 
WEST BERLIN — Soviet dissident Anatoly
Shcharansky was freed yesterday after nine years in
captivity as part of an East-West prisoner swap that
culminated months of secret bartering and a global
crusade by a wife who had not seen him since the
day after their wedding in 1974.
The 38-year-old computer programmer, who
became a heroic symbol for Soviet human-rights
activists and fellow Jews seeking to emigrate to Is
rael, was released at 11 a.m. local time into the cus
tody of U.S. and West German officials at the
Glienicke bridge checkpoint dividing West Berlin
from East Germany.
About 30 minutes after Shcharansky crossed the
snow-dusted steel span, eight accused or convicted
spies — five detained in the West and three in the
East — were exchanged to complete one of the
most highly publicized spy trades in recent years.
The United States insisted upon the distinction in
timing to underscore its contention that
Shcharansky never served as a Western agent. He
was arrested in 1977 on charges of working for the
Central Intelligence Agency and sentenced later to

13 years in prison.
Looking fit and exhilarated despite his arduous
years of detention in a labor camp, Shcharansky
strolled briskly in the company of U.S. Ambassa
dor Richard Burt to a waiting limousine. His short
frame was draped in a bulky overcoat, but he
betrayed no signs of ill health while being driven to
Tempelhof military airfield.
After changing aircraft because of technical
problems caused by frozen brakes, Shcharansky
was flown out of Berlin aboard a U.S. military
plane to Frankfurt to be reunited with his wife Avi
tal, who emigrated to Israel in 1974 and has con
ducted a tireless campaign to win his freedom. The
couple later continued their journey to Tel Aviv,
where the newly-freed dissident responded in hal
ting Hebrew to an emotional welcome.
Shcharansky told U.S. officials he was removed
from the labor camp a month ago and fed well
before his release. He was quoted as saying that
when Soviet authorities told him the other day he
was being exchanged as a spy, he laughed profusely
out of delight and incredulity over his fate.

The elaborate exchange, witnessed by hundreds
of journalists who had staked out the bridge for
more than a week, was brokered largely by the U.S.
embassies in Bonn and East Berlin and Wolfgang
Vogel, an East German lawyer with close ties to the
Communist leadership in his own country and the
Soviet Union.
A prisoner swap involving Shcharansky was
nearly concluded last fall, before the Soviet-U.S.
summit meeting at Geneva in November, but Mos
cow backed out inexplicably at the last moment, ac
cording to informed sources close to the negotia
tions.
After the summit, Vogel contacted U.S. and
West German officials and said the Soviet Union
no longer held any reservations about an exchange
and was prepared to expedite negotiations leading
to Shcharansky's release.
U.S. and West German officials said they believe
the Kremlin clearly wanted to resolve the
Shcharansky case, which had evolved into one of
Moscow's most embarrassing symbols of human
rights abuses.
