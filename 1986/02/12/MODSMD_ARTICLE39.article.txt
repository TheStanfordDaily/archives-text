# Aquino warns against support of Marcos

### 
MANILA, Philippines — Opposi
tion presidential candidate Corazon
Aquino, in a message intended for
Washington, yesterday warned the
Philippines' friends abroad not to
"support a failing dictator" as the
government media portrayed state
ments by President Reagan and Ad
ministration officials as virtually en
dorsing the re-election of President
Ferdinand Marcos.
"In this time of need we will learn
who our real friends are," Aquino
said, as vote counting continued into
a fifth day after Friday's controversial
election. "Understand that we have
won and we will take power."
Aquino campaign workers said her
remarks came in response to the gov
ernment media's portrayal of state
ments by Reagan and other Adminis
tration officials as continuing support
for him despite widespread charges of
electoral fraud.
Reagan yesterday played down
reports of fraud and said results in the
election so far prove that "there
really is a two-party system, obvi

ously good" in the Philippines.
Commenting on the fraud issue
yesterday, Cardinal Jaime Sin, the
archbishop of Manila and leader of
the Philippines' powerful Roman
Catholic Church, publicly called
Marcos "a liar" for having accused a
citizens' poll-watching group, as well
as priests and nuns, of cheating in the
election.
While publicly insisting that
Aquino has won Friday's election, the
opposition has begun acknowledging
that Marcos is likely to be proclaimed
the winner by the Batasang Pam
bansa, or National Assembly, which
his ruling party controls with a two
third majority.
The process of canvassing vote
counts and declaring a winner inched
forward there yesterday evening, with
the first official opening on the
legislative floor of metal boxes that
contain tally sheets for election
returns. Opposition members who
charge the figures may be fraudulent
fought delaying actions throughout
the eight-hour session.
