# State bill to protect Stanford property
## 
### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
Legislation allowing 7,200 acres of Stan
ford's academic lands to remain under the
jurisdictions of Santa Clara and San Mateo
Counties was introduced yesterday in the
state Assembly by Dominic Cortese (D-
San Jose).
The legislation would prevent college
lands that have been set aside for future
academic use from being annexed to a city
without the consent of the school.
Although the legislation will be applica
ble statewide, it was prompted by the

peculiar situation at Stanford. According
to Cortese, the legislation is aimed at pre
venting Stanford's academic reserves from
being carved up among two counties and
four community spheres of influence.
Currently, Stanford's academic lands
could be annexed, regardless of the Uni
versity's wishes, by four separate commun
ities — Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Woodside
and Portola Valley — with each governing
a portion, according to Andy Doty, Uni
versity director of community relations.
Having lands under up to six juridictions
cnuld make campus planning and services

difficult. Doty said.
The legislation does not include such
areas as the Stanford Shopping Center and
the Stanford Industrial Park, he said.
The University has made formal agree
ments with Santa Clara County. Palo Alto
and the county Local Government Forma
tion Commission regarding land use, an
nexation, planning and development of
University lands. However, no such ar
rangement exists concerning land in San
Mateo County, Doty said.
Two-thirds of the University's lands lie
in Santa Clara County, and the remaining

third is in San Mateo County.
Doty has written to the mayors of the
three San Mateo County communities to
inform them of the legislation.
To illustrate the likelihood of possible
jurisdictional conflicts, Cortese cited the
example of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC), parts of which
would be annexed by three cities.
"Land use within the boundaries of the
campus should be orderly. That is why I'm
intervening," he said. "To have the
campus, which is an integrated plan
ning unit in itself, divided by four
communities just doesn't make for
orderly planning.
"Both the local governments and
the University have a legitimate in
terest in planning decisions made by
each other," Cortese continued.
"They are all impacted by each
other's decisions regarding increased
housing, development and traffic. In
the absence of such an agreement,
however, I think that the University
should be protected by state law,
since all institutions of higher learn
ing are a valuable resource to the
entire state."
