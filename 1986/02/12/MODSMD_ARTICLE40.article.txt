# Reagan to send special envoy to the Philippines
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan, presented with evidence
of widespread ballot fraud in the
Philippines, announced yesterday
that he would send his former
Middle East envoy, Philip Habib,

to Manila to help determine how
the United States should respond
to what he described as a "flawed"
election.

The president also appeared to
back away from previous state
ments that presumed a re-election
victory by Philippines President
Ferdinand Marcos. Noting that the
vote count has not yet been com
pleted, he said that "it is not ap
propriate for the United States to
make such a judgement at this
time."
At the same time, Reagan indi
cated that he was persuaded by
reports of fraud. "It is a disturbing
fact that the election has been
flawed by reports of fraud, which
we take seriously, and by vio
lence," he said.
Habib's scheduled trip, the third
such presidential mission to
Manila in the past four months,
underscores the difficulty that the
United States will face in the
Philippines in the likelihood that
Marcos retains power despite
evidence that his supporters
deprived opposition leader
Corazon Aquino of a fair election.
