NASA claims seals OK
WASHINGTON — A NASA official told a
presidential commission yesterday that the
sealing design for the space shuttle's rocket
boosters was deemed "safe and adequate," but
that after recent ground testing and minor cases
of past-flight erosion, "we felt like it could be im
proved."
"Was it safe to fly?" asked commissioner Neil
Armstrong. "It was," testified NASA's David
Winterhalter.
During the second day of public testimony on
the Jan. 28 explosion that det:oyed Challenger
and killed its seven-member crew, the investigat
ing panel focused on whether NASA had prior
warning of a problem with the design and ma
terial that joined the four segments of its rocket
boosters.
Photographs of the disaster showed a flame ap
parently emerging from the area around one of
the seams on the right rocket booster.
Despite the emphasis on whether the seals
were properly assessed by NASA, commission
and agency officials both said the probe into
Challenger's explosion was not focused exclu
sively on the boosters.
The commissioners returned to concern that
cold Florida weather might have been a factor in
ihe explosion, and one NASA official said the
agency still doesn't know if the flame was "a
cause or an effect."
Lawrence Mulloy, head of the solid booster
program at the Marshall Space Flight Center in
Alabama, told the panel that analyses which fol
lowed each of NASA's 24 successful shuttle

flights had determined erosion had occurred in
six of 171 primary sealing rings.
Poisoning was murder
YONKERS, N.Y. — A woman who died of
cyanide poisoning after taking Tylenol capsules,
leading thousands of stores nationwide to take
them off their shelves, was killed by someone
who put the poison in the package within the last
10 days, a county official said yesterday.
"We are dealing with a case of murder,"
Westchester County Executive Andrew
O'Rourke said at a news conference. No one has
been charged in the slaying of Diane Elsroth, 23,
of Peekskill, who died Saturday at her
boyfriend's home after taking Tylenol from a
newly opened bottle there.
Officials did not pinpoint when the cyanide
was introduced into the capsules, which left the
factory in August. The potassium cyanide would
eat through a gelatin capsule in eight to 10 days,
said County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Millard
Hyland, who appeared with O'Rourke.
An FBI investigation turned up no evidence
that poison had been placed in any packages of
Tylenol other than the one used by Elsroth, said
Joseph Valiquette, an FBI spokesman in New
York.
Despite yesterday's announcement, manufac
turer Johnson & Johnson said it plans to review
how the batch containing the capsules Elsroth
took was manufactured.
Johnson & Johnson has been sealing the necks
and caps of Tylenol bottles and packing each bot

tie in sealed boxes since the unsolved case in
which seven Tylenol users were killed by cyanide
in the Chicago area in 1982.
Storm blasts Northeast
Snow fell a foot deep yesterday in the Ohio
Valley and snarled traffic and closed schools into
New England from a fast-moving storm that left
a white, icy trail all the way back to New Mexico.
A new wave of cold air washed from the
Canadian border into Texas, plunging tempera
tures there to a record-tying low 12 below zero.
It was the second snowstorm in five days for
much of the Northeast.
At least 11 people died this week in accidents
blamed on the weather. The storm spawned tor
nadoes late Monday in Georgia that destroyed
homes and injured several people, and drenched
parts of Florida with heavy rain that caused
flooding.
Stocks slightly lower
NEW YORK — Stock prices drifted lower in a
generally trendless session yesterday, as the mar
ket took a breather from its record climb of the
past three trading days.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which had reached record highs in each of the
three previous sessions and soared more than 33
points in the process, fell 3.56 points to close at
1,622.82 yesterday.
