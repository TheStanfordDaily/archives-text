Fuel tank fire at SFO
SAN FRANCISCO — Damage was estimated
at more than $1 million yesterday in an early
morning fire that sent clouds of smoke from bur
ning fuel and other sources into the air near San
Francisco International Airport in a potentially
disastrous fuel tank farm blaze.
The Shell Oil tank farm just north of the air
port property, storing jet and automobile fuels,
was put out commission "indefinitely" and the
distribution load was shifted to other Shell instal
lations in the area, said Gene Munger, manager
of the company's West Coast public relations.
"There was quite a bit of damage to the tank
structures and piping area, and also an electrical
area," said airport Fire Chief Ray Fandi. describ
ing the 1:2() a.m. blaze.
The fire drew an "Alert Two" response from
the department, the same as an alarm from a
crashed plane.
Munger, who estimated the cash damage, said
the electrical pumping functions at the storage

facility were destroyed, adding that no disruption
of fuel distribution was expected.
Landi said there was at least one explosion, but
that it appeared to be in a drum. The fire was
doused within 45 minutes, but firefighters
remained at the scene throughout the night.
An undetermined quantity of fuel sloshed into
nearby Colma Creek and the Coast Guard was
called in to monitor possible effects on San Fran
cisco Bay, fire officials reported.
Brown sounds off
SACRAMENTO — Gov. George Deuk
mejian "has been hurt (politically), maybe
beyond repair" by his veto of a Democratic plan
to reorganize state toxic waste agencies, Assem
bly Speaker Willie Brown said yesterday.
On another political topic in a Capitol news
conference, the San Francisco Democrat said he
is "an avid supporter of Rose Bird," and that
"it's an insult to the voters" for any politician to

refuse to take a stand on the chief justice's con
firmation election this year.
Asked if that comment applied to his political
allies such as Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who
refuses to discuss Bird, Brown replied it applied
to anyone taking that stand.
Brown's remarks on toxics reinforced the
threat by his Democratic counterpart in the state
Senate, President Pro Tem David Roberti, who
said after the toxics veto Saturday that "this is
going to be a battle cry for us every day, every
month, until we rock (Deukmejian) out of of
fice."
