# Board OKs tuition hike
## 
### MARY YUH Senior staff writer 
The Board of Trustees yesterday approved a 7 percent
increase in undergraduate tuition and a 6.4 percent in
crease in room and board, raising the basic cost of being a
Stanford student by more than $1,000 in 1986-87.
The trustee vote hikes student costs to $15,906 next
year, up from the current price tag of $14,893.
Undergraduate tuition and general graduate tuition will
increase from $10,476 to $11,208. Basic room and board
rates will increase from $4,417 to $4,700, anticipating the
construction of several hundred additional units of
graduate student housing.
Since 1970-71, tuition has increased an average of 10.1
percent annually, slightly faster than the 9.1 percent rate
of increase for personal disposable income nationally.
Owing to the tuition increase, a similar rise in financial
aid is expected, according to Tim Warner, associate
provost of Management and Budget.
The University will continue to meet the demonstrated
financial need of all undergraduates through a combina
tion of loans, jobs, scholarships and grants, and it will also
continue its policy of need-blind undergraduate admis
sions.
Tuition accounts for approximately half of the revenues
in the operating budget, the University's main budget sup
porting academic and staff salaries, maintenance of
campus grounds and buildings and other basic expenses.
The 1986-87 operating budget will go before the board
at its next meeting in March.
The trustees also approved tuition increases for the
graduate schools:
• Law school tuition will rise 6.8 percent, to $11,508 from
$10,776;
• Graduate tuition for the engineering school will rise 8.4
percent, to $11,358 from $10,476;
• Medical school tuition will rise 9 percent, to $13,440
from $12,330;
• Business school tuition will rise 9 percent, to $12,102
from $11,100.
The 6.4 percent increase in basic room and board rates
will apply to all residents, including freshmen, who are re
quired to live on campus, according to the University
News Service.
The increase in room and board
rates will put Stanford in a favorable
position for the possible construction
— within three years — of 640 addi
tional housing units for single
graduate students.
In other action, the board gave
final approval to the planned con
struction of a three-story building for
the Graduate School of Business, an
$18.1 million project that has
generated some controversy.
Art Hisory Prof. Paul Turner and
the Stanford Historical Society have
criticized the building as encroaching
on the University's formal entrance
and violating the original plan created
for Stanford in the late 19th century
by Frederick Law Olmstead.

Because of the criticism, the board
once again reviewed the plan and
design for the new building before
giving approval, according to Phil
William*;, director of the Planning Of
fice
The site and design of the building
were approved by the board last year.
Yesterday's final approval of the
plan and its budget clears the way for
business school officials to obtain bids
for the project. Construction may
begin in May and would be com
pleted by December 1987.
In a meeting with few surprises, the
board approved every recommenda
tion made by its various committees,
including the authorization of a $7.1
million investment in a "street mar
ket" to be constructed at the Stanford
Shopping Center on the site formerly
occupied by Niven's Market.
