Displaying signs reading "H.P. out of South Africa"
and "No computers for apartheid," six students and Sta
tistics Prof. Charles Stein held a demonstration at the gate
of Hewlett-Packard Co. in Palo Alto yesterday morning
to protest that company's financial interests in South
Africa.
The students, all members of Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA), issued a statement saying, "Hewlett-
Packard proudly does $50 million in business in South
Africa per year. Stanford University owns millions of dol
lars worth of H.P. stock and desperately hopes to be
endowed with millions more from the estates of Bill
Hewlett and David Packard. As a direct result, the Trus
tees of Stanford University carefully toe the line drawn by
Hewlett-Packard, so as not to jeopardize any future en
dowments."
The statement concluded: "And if that means com
plicitly in, and tacit support of, apartheid in South
Africa, the Stanford Trustees have clearly said, 'So be
it.' "
Freshman Karin Holl, one of the protesters, character
ized the reaction of Hewlett-Packard employees, most of
whom drove by as they arrived for work at 8 a.m., as
"pretty mixed."
