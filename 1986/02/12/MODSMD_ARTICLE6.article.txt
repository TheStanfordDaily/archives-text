Displaying signs reading "H.P. out of South Africa"
and "No computers for apartheid," six students and Sta
tistics Prof. Charles Stein held a demonstration at the gate
of Hewlett-Packard Co. in Palo Alto yesterday morning
to protest that company's financial interests in South
Africa.
The students, all members of Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA), issued a statement saying, "Hewlett-
Packard proudly does $50 million in business in South
Africa per year. Stanford University owns millions of dol
lars worth of H.P. stock and desperately hopes to be
endowed with millions more from the estates of Bill
Hewlett and David Packard. As a direct result, the Trus
tees of Stanford University carefully toe the line drawn by
Hewlett-Packard, so as not to jeopardize any future en
dowments."
The statement concluded: "And if that means com
plicitly in, and tacit support of, apartheid in South
Africa, the Stanford Trustees have clearly said, 'So be
it.' "
Freshman Karin Holl, one of the protesters, character
ized the reaction of Hewlett-Packard employees, most of
whom drove by as they arrived for work at 8 a.m., as
"pretty mixed."
The reactions ranged from
"thumbs up" to "head shaking" and
one employee said from her car,
"We're glad you're here," Holl said.
The demonstration is part of a
SOS A effort "to try to get out and
educate people," according to
Audrey Ivanetic, a recent Stanford
graduate and one of the protesters.
"Visibility is the best way to show

people that the (anti-apartheid)
movement is still strong," she said.
Spokespeople for Hewlett-Packard
disagreed with the demonstrators'
view of the company.
Of about 3,000 employees at the
company's South Africa branch,
about 50 are "black or mixed race,"
and the company is sponsoring edu
cational programs for blacks, accord
ing to spokesman Gene Endicott.
"We don't sell to any government
agencies involved in enforcing apart
heid," said Endicott, adding that
Hewlett-Packard has "no intention"

of withdrawing its branch from South
Africa.
"We've taken what I believe to be
a very aggressive lobbying position
there (to put pressure on the South
African government to reform racial
laws).... We think that if a company
is going to do business there, it must
play a strong socially responsible
role," said Barbara Kommer,
manager of investor communications.
"Our position is well known: that
we oppose apartheid. And we have
been working to make that position
known," Kommer added.
