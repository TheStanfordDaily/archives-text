"I'm a believer in leverage," said
the new trustee. "I'd rather give to an
organization, for example, that would
find the cure for cancer than to the
American Cancer Society where the
money would go all over."

He talks like a man who believes in
being direct: going to the source and
going to the top.
"Here is where you can make a dif
ference," he said, referring to Stan
ford. "Here is where the research is
happening, the ideas, the develop

ment, the future."
J. Frederick Weintz, Jr., limited
partner at the investment banking
firm Goldman, Sachs & Co., did not
expect to become a trustee of his
alma mater.
One of several hundred former
Stanford students nominated last year
for trustee positions reserved for
alumni, Weintz completed the
lengthy application ("It was like ap
plying to college," he said, grinning.),
but was not initially selected.
"I put [the rejection] out of my
mind," Weintz said. "So I was really
surprised when (Trustee) John
Young called me several months ago
and said 1 had been chosen as a trus
tee. It was out of the blue."

Weintz accepted, and this week at
tended his first Board of Trustees
meeting at Stanford.
"I tell you, I'm a trustee at two
other universities (Norwich Unviver
sity in Vermont and Pace University
in New York) and this place is in
credible. The staff is great. I had a
huge stack of readings that were very
detailed and complete," he said,
holding his hands five inches apart to
indicate the stack's height.
Although he is an active alumnus,
Weintz stressed that he is new to the
board and the issues it faces. He was
somewhat hesitant to talk about top
ics as controversial as divestment and
fraternities at Stanford.
A member of the Theta Chi frater
nity, he said of his experience, "On
balance it was positive, but there
were some negative aspects. I made a
lot of lasting friends, but fraternities
are not terribly conducive to scholar
ship."
Noting that he is not at all involved
in his fraternal alumni organization,
he said,"lt isn't a cosmic thing. I have
better things to be involved in."
Weintz expressed the opinion,
however, that fraternities "can play a
role" in college life.
On divestment, he spoke of his
work at Norwich to illustrate his posi
tion.
Last year he was made head of the
investment committee there and
began looking into the issue of
divestiture from companies that do
business in South Africa.
"There wasn't any student agita
tion about divestment," Weintz said.
Nevertheless, he asked officials at
schools comparable to Norwich what
they did with their endowments and
how they invested the funds.
"I decided that Norwich should
have a position on divestment. I
thought we oughtn't to invest in com
panies that do not abide by the Sul
livan Principles," he said.
The Sullivan Principles are a code
of behavior devised by the Rev. Leon
Sullivan for corporations in South
Africa.
Although the board of trustees at
Norwich is conservative, according to
Weintz, his proposal was passed and
the school sold some of its invest
ments.
Total divestment, however, "is a
very complex issue," Weintz said.
With a South Africa-free portfolio,
"there's the question of profit and
stability. Also, will it make a differ
ence? There's the argument that once
you sell your stock, there's always
someone else who'll buy it."
Referring to the influence of re
sponsibility on one's views, Weintz
said, "Once you become a trustee or
fill some other similar post, the issues
that seemed so black and white ac
quire many shades of gray. There are
more than two sides to everything

and alternatives are numerous."
Asked what motivates him to be so
involved in his alma mater, Weintz, a
1948 graduate who majored in eco
nomics, replied that those who are in
volved when they are in school tend
to maintain ties.
"I was involved as a student, and I
started doing things as an alumnus.
Some fund raising and so on. I just
kept getting in deeper," he said.
As an undergraduate, Weintz was a
member of the Me,n's Glee Club, the
Stanford Choir at Memorial Church
and a representative on the Encina
Executive Committee. He was a
manager for the varsity football team
and during the 1947 season, he cov
ered the team's away games for The
Daily.
"I was an ad hoc sports reporter,"
he said, volunteering the information
as "a piece of trivia."
Now living in Connecticut, Weintz
has hosted receptions for incoming
freshman from that region, taken an
active role in fund raising and is a
member of the Stanford Center for
International Security and Arms
Control.
In addition, his eldest son
graduated from Stanford last year,
and his younger son is currently a
junior here.

To Weintz, "a trustee is a conser
vator of the institution, entrusted
with its long-range viability and
quality and financial stability." As a
member of trustee committees on
budget and academic affairs and de
velopment, Weintz will be consider
ing matters of finance and the expan
sion and addition of University pro
grams and facilities.
In his trustee application, Weintz
wrote that the role of a university is to
be "a leader in teaching, scholarship
and research.. . .
"Stanford should strive to provide
the facilites and environment to max
imize learning, foster research at the
frontiers of knowledge and . . . sup
port those who would creatively at
tack the world's wrongs, attempt to
solve its problems and discover,
preserve or improve upon what
already is good," he wrote.
In addition to his trustee positions,
Weintz is also the director of Guiding
Eyes for the Blind and a member of
the corporation of Greenwich Hospi
tal in Connecticut.
A man with many commitments, he
has placed high priority on being a
Stanford trustee.
"I'm going to give it the time it
needs," Weintz said.
