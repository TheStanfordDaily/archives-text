# Shantytown yields no clues

The chances of identifying the person or persons re
sponsible for vandalizing the shantytown in White
Plaza are slim, a Stanford police captain said yesterday.
Marvin Moore said there "were no witnesses" to
the vandalism, and "no physical evidence to speak
of." He added that because "no California law was vio
lated." there is uncertainty whether "any criminal
charges could be filed."
At about 1:30 a.m. Sunday, Stanford Police Officer
Doug kuffel found that the cardboard and wood
structure, erected last month by members of Stanford
Out of South Africa (SOSA), had collapsed, Moore
said.
SOSA members say they constructed the shan
tytown before the visit of South African Bishop Des

inond Tutu to remind students of the living conditions
blacks face in South Africa.
"No one has come forward as a victim" of the van
dalism, Moore said, adding that no formal complaint
has been filed.
"There is nothing we can do at this point," he said.
Moore said there was "no relationship" between the
vandalism of the shantytown and a Dartmouth inci
dent, in which three wooden shantytown structures
were destroyed last month. After the incident,
Dartmouth closed for a day and students attended
seminars on racism.
Moore said it was unclear if the structure was
"authorized" to be in White Plaza.
According to Paul Szczesiul, assistant director of
Tresidder Union, "any use of (White) Plaza must be
scheduled with Tresidder," adding that scheduling
"was not done in this case."
