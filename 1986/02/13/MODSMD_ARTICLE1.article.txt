# Students to watch Soviet TV
## 
### MARY K. McDEVITT Senior staff writer 
Students next quarter will be able
to look through a "window into the
Russian language and Soviet society"
when segments of domestic Soviet
television are shown in political sci
ence and communication classes.
Broadcasts from programs such as
the Communist Party Congress, to be
highlighted by the speeches of Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev later this
month, will be aired in a Soviet
foreign policy seminar and a broad
cast journalism class this spring, ac
cording to University officials.
Intercepted from a Siberian
satellite, the Soviet programs are in
tended only for domestic consump
tion.
The computer-driven satellite sys
tem opens a "window into the Rus
sian language and Soviet society
which is unthinkable in any other
context," said Prof. Richard Schup
bach, chairman of the Slavic Lan
guages and Literatures Department.
"The cultural value is enormous,"
Schupbach said. "I think it will create
a need for itself, a new area of schol
arly endeavor."
Alexander Dallin, professor of his
tory and political science, described
the viewings as an "experiment" and
said he is not sure how valuable the
programs will be to students.
Access to the broadcasts of the
Communist Party Congress "will help
to try to correct any preconceptions
we might have," Dallin said.
"It will be good as a language
learning tool and for anyone studying
the media," he said. "But if you have
a limited number of class hours, it
could limit class interaction."
Stuart Neubarth, a recent Stanford
graduate in electrical engineering
who developed the prototype inter
ception device, is installing the Soviet
television receiving system at the
University. The project should be
completed by April or May,
Neubarth said.
The new sophisticated "first cabin"
system, which will allow for auto
matic tracking and reception of So
viet signals and require minimal input
for maintenance, will cost nearly
$100,000, according to Schupbach.
The project is funded in part by the
Hoover Institution and the School of
Humanities and Sciences, he said.
The signals will provide a Soviet
channel for SUNet, the Stanford
cable system.
"We want it available to the whole
community on a standard American
television set," Schupbach said.
Some University professors hope
the Soviet system will be the first
of several international systems
available to students, according to
Schupbach.
"We hope to have a center for
people to come in and Hip on the TV
to watch . . . Chinese, Russian.
Japanese, Korean, Spanish (and)
French television," he said.
A cultural and linguistic center of
this type would be established "five
io 10 years down the line." Schup
bach added.
National intelligence and security
agencies have not contacted the Uni
versity with interest in Stanford's
monitoring of Soviet television, but
several universities across the country
have said they want their own track
ing system, according to Schupbach.
"We suspect the [Central Intelli
gence Agency] and [National Security
Agency] intercept Soviet signals,"

Schupbach said. "They must. It's such
an obvious type of thing. .. . It's not
of any consuming novelty to
them. . . .
"But educationally it's amazing.
It's stood the place on its ear," he
said.
Stanford will rebroadcast the sig
nals to UC-Berkeley, San Francisco
State University, California State
University at Hayward and other in
terested institutions, according to

Schupbach and Neubarth.
Schupbach said he doesn't think
the Soviets will take restrictive or
punitive measures against Stanford
for monitoring their broadcast, but
University officials are cautious about
nationwide distribution of the system
because of legal ambiguities.
"Suppose we want to buy
[copyrights]. We must negotiate with
the Soviet Union on who to pay, how
much to pay and when," Schupbach
said.
