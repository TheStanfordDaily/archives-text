# Study says students must think to learn

The road to superior teaching and
learning can be realized if students
are urged to form their own ideas
about what they are studying rather
than merely to memorize material,
according to a team of 10 Stanford in
vestigators.
To maximize the amount of educa
tion that can be accomplished in a
classroom, more thoughtful interac
tion between students and teachers is
needed, said the chief investigators,
Assoc. Prof. Judith Langer and Prof.
Arthur Applebee, both from the
School of Education.
Teachers must become
"collaborators in learning," Langer
said. They must do more than simply
relate facts. They must work students
to encourage them not only to learn
subject matter, but also to become in
dependent and competent thinkers
and learners, she added.
Conducted by the School of Educa
tion, the four-year study involved 18
Bay Area high schools with the
cooperation of 23 teachers. More
than 500 students were interviewed,
and their classes were visited several

times per week over a period of five
months to a year. Two students from
each class were examined extensively
to insure balance in the study.
Noting striking aspects of the find
ings, Langer said, "Most unusual is
our understanding now that writing
has a place in school not only as a skill
.. . but also as a powerful tool that
can assist students in subject matter
learning."
Far more is learned when studying
is accompanied by writing than when
it is not, according to Langer.
"Knowledge grows and changes as
students write about a particular sub
ject. . . . Writing has a place in learn
ing," she added, stating that the
utility of writing goes far beyond its
standard use as simply another form
of expression.
Investigators added that writing is
also essential in avoiding a narrow
focus in education, citing analytical
writing as the key to encouraging stu
dents to rethink material and form
their own thoughts on it. This process
allows students not only to learn ma
terial better, but also to retain the
concepts for a longer period of time,
according to the study.
