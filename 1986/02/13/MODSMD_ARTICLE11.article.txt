## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Reagan's budget is bad 
### 
President Reagan's recently proposed 1987 national
budget has been shot down and called "dead on arri
val" by Congress, but it is the budget itself which is ac
tually the source of violence through its attacks on the
social and economic welfare of this nation.
Throughout his presidency and most recently in the
State of the Union address, Reagan has preached that
the prime responsibility of the government is "defense
— keeping America strong, free and at peace." In or
der to achieve this goal, the 1987 budget calls for an
11.9 percent increase in military spending with the
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) the biggest single
item. Not only would this raise defense spending by
$34 billion above current levels, but military outlays
would account for 28 cents of every federal dollar
spent in 1987, while all other outlays, excluding inter
est payments, would total only 57 cents.
These billions more for weapons programs,
however, result in billions less for other government
programs. Because Reagan insists that there be no tax
increase, and because he argues that he has no choice
but to increase defense spending, domestic social pro
grams must bear all the burden of the cuts required by
the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction act.
Under this budget, $24 billion would be cut from a
whole series of agricultural and soil programs, urban
development action grants and agricultural price sup
ports, not to mention health care, transportation, food

stamps and welfare. There would also be across-the
board cuts in aid to education, job training and social
services programs with deep cuts in college student as
sistance. Aid to middle class students would be almost
eliminated, and two out of every 10 college students
would lose their federal grants and loans.
Despite Reagan's stress on the importance of the
family in his State of the Union address and his claim
that "private values must be at the heart of public
policies," it is precisely the policies of this Administra
tion and the projected effects of this budget which
would do more harm to families than anything else.
Taken together, all the proposed cuts in this budget
constitute a challenge to virtually every domestic pro
gram. This will serve only to drive more families apart
and into difficult economic situations.
This pro-military, anti-social spending budget makes
it clear to the American public where Reagan's
priorities lie. He insists on channeling money to the
Pentagon because he believes defense is one of the
few legitimate areas in which government should take
an active role. We, however, can no longer accept this
vision of the government, just as we can no longer ac
cept Reagan's vision which pretends that we can have
unlimited military spending, unrestrained tax breaks
and a balanced budget at the same time. The prime re
sponsibility of the government should not be defense,
but rather securing and maintaining social and eco
nomic justice for all.
