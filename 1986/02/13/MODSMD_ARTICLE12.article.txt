Shantytown was
no help to Africa
They used cardboard — bicycle
boxes. They built shacks — small ugly
shacks. The shacks were torn down —
they cried "racism!" Why is the
tearing down of shantytown a racist
act?
Some say because shantytown
represents solidarity with the op
pressed people of South Africa. Does
it really? I don't think so. It could
have. It could have if people had lived
there, really showing solidarity. In
stead, they built little cardboard huts
and renamed White Plaza as Black
Plaza. (Incidentally, White Plaza was
named after a man, not a race. It
makes me wonder who the racists
really are on campus.)
Others say it is a racist act because
of the disrespect it shows for the ef
forts of the people who built shan
tytown. This would indeed have been
a good argument if the people who
constructed it deserved any respect
for it. Did they in fact do anything
worthy of respect? Was it really
worthwhile? Who did shantytown
help? Was there a black South
African who gained moral support
from it? Was there a poor child in
Mexico who was encouraged by our
ability to build a house frighteningly
like his? Was a starving mother in
East Palo Alto satisfied with the
knowledge that a cardboard hut was
erected on the Stanford campus? Did
any of these people even know about
shantytown? The answer to all of
these questions is "probably not."
Shantytown may have been in
tended to show solidarity, but it fell
far short. True solidarity is not shown
through grand but futile gestures, but

through a genuine effort to help. The
time used to build a cardboard
eyesore in the middle of a campus
which was meant to be serene and
beautiful could have been used to
help a family that is just as oppressed,
albeit financially instead of politi
cally, in East Palo Alto. However,
such an action would not have been
as grandiose or abstract.
I can't help thinking Stanford Out
of South Africa (SOSA) leaders are
secretly happy that shantytown was
torn down. How long were they going
to leave it there, anyway? Until
apartheid ended? The end of apart
heid won't necessarily end poverty
for black South Africans. So leave it
there until poverty ends? The Uni
versity will look like shantytown by
then, and no one would have been
any better off due to shantytown's
existence.
By questioning the value of shan
tytown, I'm not telling people not to
do anything. I'm just saying don't
make futile gestures.

SOSA, Board are
resolving funding
The ASSU Financial Manager's
Office, the Program Board and Stan
ford Out of South Africa (SOSA)
have met and are resolving matters
concerning SOSA's account with the
ASSU.
SOSA's account was frozen by the
Program Board because ASSU allo
cated money was used for activities
not authorized in the budget. SOSA's
stated intention, however, was to pay
for these expenses with funds from

outside sources, but these were not
received in the ASSU account at the
time. There was no attempt to cover
this up, as is evident from the finan
cial statement, and furthermore this
matter is in the process of being cor
rected.
We hope that previous articles did
not give an impression of controversy
or conflict when there was none.

Coffee ad is insult
There is no excuse for printing such
afi insulting ad as the one For General
Foods International Coffees entitled
"8 ways to get a man to ask you out
again." First of all, women aren't
obliged "to get a man to ask [them]
out." Second, I dislike it when people
imply that women don't know any
thing about sports, or wine or any
thing. It annoys those of us who do.
Worse, I hate it when people imply
that women have to be sycophantic to
earn a man's attention. That is an in
sult to men as well. Finally, the ad is
ineffective. Any sensible person
would not follow the advice given in
items 1-7, so why follow the advice
given in item 8? General Foods is tel
ling us that tempting him with a
Suisse Mocha is as brainless as laugh
ing at jokes with no punchlines.
