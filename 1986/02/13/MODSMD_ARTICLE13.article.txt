## U.S. right helps subvert reform 
### 
I am disgusted, ?.ppalled, ashamed. The right
wing in my country is flushing our moral capital
down the sewer, stuck to a murderer and usurper
named Ferdinand Marcos.
It is clear who won the election in the
Philippines. The New York Times noted the inevi
table logic: "If Mr. Marcos were even close to win
ning honestly, he would by now be trumpeting the
returns." If we believe in democracy the course is
clear. We should go to Corazon Aquino, recognize
her as the legitimately elected president of the
Philippines, and let her know that, at her behest,
we will yank the criminal Marcos out by the scruff
of the neck on two days notice.

ALEXANDER RAWLS

A constitutional transition of power would of
course be preferable. One must remember though,
that the Philippines no longer has a national consti
tution. They have a Marcos constitution — a rub
ber stamp to his despotism, his murdering and now
to his election fraud.
Then, on the television, appears President
Reagan. On the eve of the ballot counting in the
Philippine Parliament, the last hope to deter
Marcos' fraud, Reagan refuses, despite repeated
prodding, to even say that the United States is con
cerned that the counting be fair. Reagan is virtually
encouraging him now to steal the election.
So. is this gargantuan stupidity? Or is it a revela
tion. that the Reagan Adminstration all along was
only hoping that this election would provide some
legitimacy for Marcos, not replace him? I believe

we are seeing just how cynically the Administration
is willing to use the mantle of democracy — every
bit as cynically as Marcos himself.
Reagan followed the line of the day's Wall Street
Journal editorial in defending U.S. acceptance of
whatever outcome the Marcos-controlled parlia
ment delivers. Whatever the fairness of the tally,
say Reagan and the Journal, both candidates
clearly did receive a substantial vote, thus whoever
is declared winner will have a substantial claim to
legitimacy.
Never mind how anyone could want to say this, it
completely ignores half of the election fraud. In au
dition to fraudulent vote counting is vote buying
and, most importantly, intimidation.
The Philippines under Marcos guarantees no se
cret ballot. Filipinos living within the crony fief
doms face huge intimidation and indoctrination,
and they are not the only ones with reason to fear
reprisal.
Without a large captive vote, secured by abuse of
power, there is no reason to believe Marcos would
have won more votes than the number of cronies he
has enriched at the expense of the entire country.
"It simply is not in the U.S. interest" the Journal
claims "to picture Mr. Marcos as some kind of an
ogre, the only obstacle between his countrymen
and a bright and peaceful future." But he is exactly
this.
The Journal, like the rest of the right wing, in
cluding Reagan and many Hoover fellows, ration
alized the situation by returning to the cornerstone
of right wing support for authoritarian regimes.
Vietnam was lost, the claim goes, because of our
failure to stand by an authoritarian ally, the

Marcos-like dictator of South Vietnam, Ngo Dinli
Diem. Vietnam went communist for one very
simple reason: President Roosevelt, who had
refused to let the French go back into Vietnam
after WW 11, died, and an unaware Harry Truman
became president. Understand this. It is very im
portant.
The French fled Vietnam when the Japanese
invaded. A national army of Vietnamese, headed
by one Ho Chi Minh, joined the allies and fought
until the Japanese were driven out. After the war
FDR died, the French went back in, and years later
we took over their colonial war. A lost cause, a
wrong cause, whether our ally was Diem or Thieu.
Of course Ho was a marxist — he was educated
in France. But he was larger than the French idiocy
in every way. quoting our Declaration of Indepen
dence to his people and inquiring after a peacetime
alliance with the United States.
Criminal negligence on the part of the red baiters
in this country forced the Vietnamese to turn to
their long-time enemies the Chinese for help and
ultimately cost Vietnam its bright prospects for
liberty and democracy.
Hoover "scholars" have been spokesmen for
every line of right-wing horseshit. I call on them
now to defend themselves, or utterly reject the
travesties ol judgement and morality we hear from
their compatriots.
Do you hear me Hoover? You like to say how we
aren't helpless in the world. Will you now say we
are helpless to do anything about the criminal
Marcos?
Prove to me you have any right to your influence
in this country. Tell me how not to despise you.

wing in my country is flushing our moral capital
down the sewer, stuck to a murderer and usurper
named Ferdinand Marcos.
It is clear who won the election in the
Philippines. The New York Times noted the inevi
table logic: "If Mr. Marcos were even close to win
ning honestly, he would by now be trumpeting the
returns." If we believe in democracy the course is
clear. We should go to Corazon Aquino, recognize
her as the legitimately elected president of the
Philippines, and let her know that, at her behest,
we will yank the criminal Marcos out by the scruff
of the neck on two days notice.

A constitutional transition of power would of
course be preferable. One must remember though,
that the Philippines no longer has a national consti
tution. They have a Marcos constitution — a rub
ber stamp to his despotism, his murdering and now
to his election fraud.
Then, on the television, appears President
Reagan. On the eve of the ballot counting in the
Philippine Parliament, the last hope to deter
Marcos' fraud, Reagan refuses, despite repeated
prodding, to even say that the United States is con
cerned that the counting be fair. Reagan is virtually
encouraging him now to steal the election.
So. is this gargantuan stupidity? Or is it a revela
tion. that the Reagan Adminstration all along was
only hoping that this election would provide some
legitimacy for Marcos, not replace him? I believe

we are seeing just how cynically the Administration
is willing to use the mantle of democracy — every
bit as cynically as Marcos himself.
Reagan followed the line of the day's Wall Street
Journal editorial in defending U.S. acceptance of
whatever outcome the Marcos-controlled parlia
ment delivers. Whatever the fairness of the tally,
say Reagan and the Journal, both candidates
clearly did receive a substantial vote, thus whoever
is declared winner will have a substantial claim to
legitimacy.
Never mind how anyone could want to say this, it
completely ignores half of the election fraud. In au
dition to fraudulent vote counting is vote buying
and, most importantly, intimidation.
The Philippines under Marcos guarantees no se
cret ballot. Filipinos living within the crony fief
doms face huge intimidation and indoctrination,
and they are not the only ones with reason to fear
reprisal.
Without a large captive vote, secured by abuse of
power, there is no reason to believe Marcos would
have won more votes than the number of cronies he
has enriched at the expense of the entire country.
"It simply is not in the U.S. interest" the Journal
claims "to picture Mr. Marcos as some kind of an
ogre, the only obstacle between his countrymen
and a bright and peaceful future." But he is exactly
this.
The Journal, like the rest of the right wing, in
cluding Reagan and many Hoover fellows, ration
alized the situation by returning to the cornerstone
of right wing support for authoritarian regimes.
Vietnam was lost, the claim goes, because of our
failure to stand by an authoritarian ally, the

Marcos-like dictator of South Vietnam, Ngo Dinli
Diem. Vietnam went communist for one very
simple reason: President Roosevelt, who had
refused to let the French go back into Vietnam
after WW 11, died, and an unaware Harry Truman
became president. Understand this. It is very im
portant.
The French fled Vietnam when the Japanese
invaded. A national army of Vietnamese, headed
by one Ho Chi Minh, joined the allies and fought
until the Japanese were driven out. After the war
FDR died, the French went back in, and years later
we took over their colonial war. A lost cause, a
wrong cause, whether our ally was Diem or Thieu.
Of course Ho was a marxist — he was educated
in France. But he was larger than the French idiocy
in every way. quoting our Declaration of Indepen
dence to his people and inquiring after a peacetime
alliance with the United States.
Criminal negligence on the part of the red baiters
in this country forced the Vietnamese to turn to
their long-time enemies the Chinese for help and
ultimately cost Vietnam its bright prospects for
liberty and democracy.
Hoover "scholars" have been spokesmen for
every line of right-wing horseshit. I call on them
now to defend themselves, or utterly reject the
travesties ol judgement and morality we hear from
their compatriots.
Do you hear me Hoover? You like to say how we
aren't helpless in the world. Will you now say we
are helpless to do anything about the criminal
Marcos?
Prove to me you have any right to your influence
in this country. Tell me how not to despise you.
