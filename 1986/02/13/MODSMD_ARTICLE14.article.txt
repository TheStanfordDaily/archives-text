# Students must find path
## 
### 
In the winter of my freshman year at Dartmouth, I lived
in a dorm on a hill that looked across Dartmouth Row to
the college green. In the morning, as you walked down
from Fayerweather House, past Thorton and Dartmouth
Halls, you would see the green slowly come into view: a
great field of snow, spotted with a few trees and dissected
by pathways. If it was a day on which this snow was fresh,
you might also be struck by the brightness of the early
sunlight bursting off the flakes scattered around you:
hanging from tree branches, falling from rooftops, piled
on steps.
Once down on College Street, with the Row at your
back and Baker Library ahead on your right, the green is
in its fullness before you, the center of activity — the
lifeblood — of the college. It is the field of action, mutable
and moving, and for this reason I always enjoyed a stroll
across it. Especially at night. After hours of reading in the
library, the green offered motion. The air would be light
and cool in my lungs, and the campus dark except for the
light in the library tower.

. Walking slowly and carefully along, I would listen to my
foot crunch loudly against the snow on one of the trails.
The Dartmouth green is covered with these paths, and
even when doing something as simple as returning to the
dorm or going to class, one must choose one's passage.
This is what I admired about the green: its freedom of
movement. Not only were the existent trails an option, but
one could always elect to go one's way and make a sepa
rate route. One maps oneself on college greens.
It is a truth. I believe, that experiencing the locale of a
writer springs him into your awareness. For in New
Hampshire, on those nights when one is going along
quietly by oneself in the lateness, the old sights and
sounds of the countryside are brought to life; and when
approaching a fork in the green, if one is an imaginative
person, one will picture Robert Frost confronted by two
roads diverging in a wood. Frost's voice is everywhere at
Dartmouth — he was a student at the college and
later in his career he lectured there — and the daily exper
ience of nature which he turned into a book of art still
remains to be explored. Diverging paths surround us, and
the Dartmouth stomping ground, with its motions and
trails and lights in deep winter, seemed to me full of the
promise of human self-determination, and, I suppose, of
the capacity of poetry to breathe a magic suggestiveness
over the surface of it all.
But this winter at Dartmouth something was blocking
the fluidity of its pathways. Something was in the way of
free movement. As part of a peaceful protest against
Dartmouth's investments in South Africa, a student group
constructed "shanties" in the center of the college green.

the focal point of its network of trails. Now no one could
cross the green in quite the same fashion.
1 left Dartmouth to come to Stanford this year, so I did
not see the shanties. But 1 imagine that the green's pictur
esque quality must have made the sight of these crum
bling, makeshift shacks, which most blacks in South Africa
call home, all the more of an eyesore, and, consequently,
all the more disturbing. For I had the hope that it would
remind that campus of what I myself was reminded of —
that a black in South Africa cannot feel the surge of
freedom of a college green. He cannot choose his private
way. Under the law of the current South African regime,
he is stripped of the right to define himself. He is forbid
den to exercise the ancient and treasured dream of taking
the stuff of his life and using his will and imagination to
shape it.
In America, albeit we have had and certainly will al
ways have those who want to constrict the movement of
others, more people are more free more of the time; and
this freedom has grounded a significant chapter of our na
tional literature in the right of choice. The symbols of the
choice are the symbols which inspire one to motion: Jay
Gatsby's green light, Ahab's whale, Santiago's marlin. Yet
it would be throwing words away to speak to the Pretoria
government of green lights. And with the black South
African, we cannot share common stories of the freedom
to stand apart, for he stands apart, but not free. For him,
there will be no wonder of stumbling upon diverging paths
in the woods, never the choice to take the road less
traveled.
Perhaps these thoughts were spinning through the
Dartmouth campus this winter. But we all read something
quite different in our newspapers. We read that one dark
night in January a group of students stole quietly up to the
shanties and destroyed them with sledgehammers. We
were told what organization was responsible — The
Dartmouth Review — and for what reasons it acted. The
articles even explained that the school shut down for a day
to hold in-house seminars on what kind of place
Dartmouth had become.
What the newspapers didn't explain was that none of
these facts are very essential. It is not important what offi
cial organization those nightstalkers represent. Nor is it
important what their politics are, or why they felt com
pelled to show their heroism by toppling in darkness what
their shared emotions could not feel in daylight. Rather,
what must be remembered from this incident is nothing
more than the emergence of ugly intolerance. And at
Stanford, where we have recently seen the same lack of
empathy bring down our shanties as well, we must ask
ourselves why, in protesting intolerance thousands of
miles away, we are stunned to discover it in White Plaza.
Perhaps, it is because, like Milton, we fail to recognize
that there is no need to locate the Adversary outside of
Eden. He already exists within. In our own garden.
Two roads diverge in a wood. If we neglect to acknowl
edge the choice — to develop our mutual sympathy here
at home — but instead turn away, then we will leave Stan
ford with valuable degrees and calculating minds, but
bearing hearts absent of the pity and compassion without
which we will be unprepared to inherit our world.

free movement. As part of a peaceful protest against
Dartmouth's investments in South Africa, a student group
constructed "shanties" in the center of the college green.

the focal point of its network of trails. Now no one could
cross the green in quite the same fashion.
1 left Dartmouth to come to Stanford this year, so I did
not see the shanties. But 1 imagine that the green's pictur
esque quality must have made the sight of these crum
bling, makeshift shacks, which most blacks in South Africa
call home, all the more of an eyesore, and, consequently,
all the more disturbing. For I had the hope that it would
remind that campus of what I myself was reminded of —
that a black in South Africa cannot feel the surge of
freedom of a college green. He cannot choose his private
way. Under the law of the current South African regime,
he is stripped of the right to define himself. He is forbid
den to exercise the ancient and treasured dream of taking
the stuff of his life and using his will and imagination to
shape it.
In America, albeit we have had and certainly will al
ways have those who want to constrict the movement of
others, more people are more free more of the time; and
this freedom has grounded a significant chapter of our na
tional literature in the right of choice. The symbols of the
choice are the symbols which inspire one to motion: Jay
Gatsby's green light, Ahab's whale, Santiago's marlin. Yet
it would be throwing words away to speak to the Pretoria
government of green lights. And with the black South
African, we cannot share common stories of the freedom
to stand apart, for he stands apart, but not free. For him,
there will be no wonder of stumbling upon diverging paths
in the woods, never the choice to take the road less
traveled.
Perhaps these thoughts were spinning through the
Dartmouth campus this winter. But we all read something
quite different in our newspapers. We read that one dark
night in January a group of students stole quietly up to the
shanties and destroyed them with sledgehammers. We
were told what organization was responsible — The
Dartmouth Review — and for what reasons it acted. The
articles even explained that the school shut down for a day
to hold in-house seminars on what kind of place
Dartmouth had become.
What the newspapers didn't explain was that none of
these facts are very essential. It is not important what offi
cial organization those nightstalkers represent. Nor is it
important what their politics are, or why they felt com
pelled to show their heroism by toppling in darkness what
their shared emotions could not feel in daylight. Rather,
what must be remembered from this incident is nothing
more than the emergence of ugly intolerance. And at
Stanford, where we have recently seen the same lack of
empathy bring down our shanties as well, we must ask
ourselves why, in protesting intolerance thousands of
miles away, we are stunned to discover it in White Plaza.
Perhaps, it is because, like Milton, we fail to recognize
that there is no need to locate the Adversary outside of
Eden. He already exists within. In our own garden.
Two roads diverge in a wood. If we neglect to acknowl
edge the choice — to develop our mutual sympathy here
at home — but instead turn away, then we will leave Stan
ford with valuable degrees and calculating minds, but
bearing hearts absent of the pity and compassion without
which we will be unprepared to inherit our world.

In the winter of my freshman year at Dartmouth, I lived
in a dorm on a hill that looked across Dartmouth Row to
the college green. In the morning, as you walked down
from Fayerweather House, past Thorton and Dartmouth
Halls, you would see the green slowly come into view: a
great field of snow, spotted with a few trees and dissected
by pathways. If it was a day on which this snow was fresh,
you might also be struck by the brightness of the early
sunlight bursting off the flakes scattered around you:
hanging from tree branches, falling from rooftops, piled
on steps.
Once down on College Street, with the Row at your
back and Baker Library ahead on your right, the green is
in its fullness before you, the center of activity — the
lifeblood — of the college. It is the field of action, mutable
and moving, and for this reason I always enjoyed a stroll
across it. Especially at night. After hours of reading in the
library, the green offered motion. The air would be light
and cool in my lungs, and the campus dark except for the
light in the library tower.

. Walking slowly and carefully along, I would listen to my
foot crunch loudly against the snow on one of the trails.
The Dartmouth green is covered with these paths, and
even when doing something as simple as returning to the
dorm or going to class, one must choose one's passage.
This is what I admired about the green: its freedom of
movement. Not only were the existent trails an option, but
one could always elect to go one's way and make a sepa
rate route. One maps oneself on college greens.
It is a truth. I believe, that experiencing the locale of a
writer springs him into your awareness. For in New
Hampshire, on those nights when one is going along
quietly by oneself in the lateness, the old sights and
sounds of the countryside are brought to life; and when
approaching a fork in the green, if one is an imaginative
person, one will picture Robert Frost confronted by two
roads diverging in a wood. Frost's voice is everywhere at
Dartmouth — he was a student at the college and
later in his career he lectured there — and the daily exper
ience of nature which he turned into a book of art still
remains to be explored. Diverging paths surround us, and
the Dartmouth stomping ground, with its motions and
trails and lights in deep winter, seemed to me full of the
promise of human self-determination, and, I suppose, of
the capacity of poetry to breathe a magic suggestiveness
over the surface of it all.
