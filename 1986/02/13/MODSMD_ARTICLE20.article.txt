## CAMPUS COMPENDIUM 
### 
Enough already
Princetonians just baffle the mind.
Earlier this winter a whopping 85 percent of the
Princeton student body turned out at the polls to fight
a sex-bias suit and keep their Cottage Club what it had
been for 100 years — a selective, all-male eating club.
However, last month the undergraduates were
overruled by the alumni board in charge of the club
and the "Cottage Cheesers," as they are called, were
forced to go co-educational.
"Everyone was walking around the club stunned,"
junior Andy Schneider told The New York Times last
Tuesday.
The Cottage Cheesers soon realized that their
negative attitude might scare the "girls" away.
"We said if we have to have girls, we want great
girls," Schneider said.
Next came the tough part: what makes a great girl?
The Cottage Cheesers spent a great deal of time
deliberating over this issue. Some feminist sympa
thizers were afraid only great-looking girls would be
accepted.
"People know the natural attraction for girls,"
Schneider said.
At last a consensus was reached.
Schneider said the Cheesers decided the girls should
be "genuine girls, honest and friendly all the time . . .
fun loving . . . and pleasant to talk to."
"I'd like to think that they'll be Cottage ladies just
like we're Cottage gentlemen," he added. How quaint.
Now came the fun part: picking the lucky new
Cheeserettes and initiating them into the Club.
The first of the female persuasion to be tossed in the

air (part of the necessary ritual) was Sarah Smith of
Mcßae, Ga., now known as "Sister Smith."
"They handed me a red pen," Smith said. "You
realized you were participating in something momen
tous."
Ah, the sweet smell of history in the making. Kinda
makes you all tingly inside, doesn't it?
What do you make of this, Ms. Steinem?
Oops
S.E. Abrams of The Brown Daily Herald might dis
agree with you. Seems like he ran into a bit of trouble
in an opinions piece that he wrote for the paper the
other week.
Here's his ceremonial letter of apology to The Daily
Herald's readers:
Due to a power failure in the BDH offices, the BDH
staff were unable to delete several potentially offensive
statements in my article entitled "Trials and Tribulations
of a Transfer." I had planned for the omission of the
derogatory presentation of fraternity life, but again, be
cause of complications, I was unable to retract and edit
the statements in time. It is neither my desire nor my in
tent to perpetuate stereotypes or contribute to the aliena
tion of any campus group. The remarks were in bad
taste and should have been eliminated.
Once again, I regret this error and extend my
apologies to any individual or group who may have
taken offense.
- S.E. Abrams
Don't worry S.E., just look at what's going on at
Princeton.
