## Terry Gilliam paints elaborate world of bloated urbanity and fumbling humanity Unconventional 'Brazil' projects imagination 
### LARRY WEBER Editorial staff 
Terry Gilliam's "Brazil" is not set
in South America, though it might as
well be. Whether or not the film's en
vironment is east of Tokyo, west of
London, or dead in the center of
Pittsburgh, Pa., is of no consequence.
In fact, pretend that Brazil, the
United States, Europe and all the
world's modernity were stuffed into a
test tube and mixed, shaken,
reconstituted and projected in its new
form onto tht giant Hollywood
screen, and welcome yourself to the
laboratory of Gilliam's inexorable
imagination.
The film's unique depiction of ram
pant urbanity, bloated bureaucracy
and its effect upon the poor and fum
bling clan of humanity is the direc
tor's satiric contortion of the modern
world.
The relentless and sardonic artistic
vision of "Brazil's" director is not new
to Monty Python fans. Gilliam is and
has been the British comedy troupe's
animator and sole American cohort
since its first convening. Having had a
creative hand in much of Python's
work, including co-direction of the
society-ridiculing standard, "Monty
Python's The Meaning of Life," Gil
liam has asserted that anything held
sacred by the human herd is a hover
ing blimp for the harpoon of his wit.
"Brazil" is laden with Gilliam's
sardonic imaging, which he achieves
primarily through his artist's lens, but
also through his director's sense of
timing the film medium's various ef
fecting elements. A punch of music, a
cut from one scene to another, and a
special effect that ambushes the audi
ence can each squeeze laughs out of a
moment.
Yet "Brazil" does not merely reaf
firm Gilliam's mastery of comic im
aging, as has been previously exhib

ited in his Python contributions and
his last directorial effort, "Time Ban
dits." His new creation rises above
the Python conglomerated-skit for
mat, which relies primarily on the
pure comedic talents of the players
and the director. Rather, "Brazil"
settles Gilliam's vision into the
structure of a powerful story, as pro
vided by his and collaborators Tom
Stoppard and Charles McKeown's
screenplay.
The story is a derivative of George
Orwell's "1984." Government is a
huge beast whose breath is felt by
every individual, and as Orwell's Big
Brother requires the subjection of the
individual will to the will of the state,
the immensity of "Brazil's" govern
ment commands human energy to
maintain it.
However, Brazil's vulnerability to
internal bursts of terrorism — per
petuated by what government
Information Retrieval Director
Eugene Helpmann (Peter Vaughan)
labels "bad sportsmanship" — as well
as the preponderance of T.V. screens
playing old-time movies as opposed to
an immobile slide of Big Brother's
face, puts the film's society in a some
what less developed category than
Orwell's.
As a result, the movie's protagonist,
Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce), is free
to dream of the giant government
monster stopping him from con
sumating with his version of Venus,
whereas Orwell's protagonist, Win
ston, cannot make a move in his mind
without fearing the "thought police."
In contrast to Orwell's stark society,
the objective reality in "Brazil" is so
absurdly littered with grotesque
gadgetry and over-fed urbanity that
Lowry cannot help but retreat into his
elaborately portrayed fantasy world.
Lowry embodies the struggle to or
der an existence that, thanks to Gil

liam's penchant for invention, is
ridiculously unmanageable. He
wanders through his occupational life
in the government's Ministry of In
formation, in which millions of papers
fly through hands and wall pipes (ask
Gilliam) to perhaps end in their
proper places; and through his iso
lated homelife, in which his flat is a
typically " Brazil"-ian menagerie of
fallible automation.
Yet Lowry's immersion in the ab
surd — from his mother's (played by

Katherine Helmond) face-stretching
treatments with her miracle-worker
plastic surgeon/beautician, to his
reliance on the government's bum
bling public service panacea in
famously known as "Central
Services" to fix (sabotage) his failed
monster-of-a-heating system — clouds
the boundary between his perception
of the real world and his protective
fantasy world.
One can trace Lowry's conflict
through the progression of his fanta

sies. His first one is a subconscious
dream, in which he flies like Icarus
meant to fly, towards the suspended
image of his Venus, gently carving the
air in a path to her lips.
This is the only fantasy in which
things are perfect, and as his flight to
his dream woman becomes increas
ingly diverted by monstrous construc
tions and their monster protector (the
personification of government), one
realizes that Lowry's true hope is to
establish a human connection despite
the smothering obesity of his ob
jective world.
As his fantasies creep out of his
sleep and into his waking thoughts, it
becomes clear that his situation is
desperate, and that his detachment
from human beings is hopelessly
rooted in what cannot be overcome:
his reliance on an isolating bureau
cratic job, which is hopelessly insu
lated within a gluttonous government
structure that swallows individual
aspiration.
So when his mother asks him if he
has any ambition or any dreams after
he refuses an offer to transfer from
his job with the Department of
Records to the more prestigious
Bureau of Information Retrieval, he
screams, "No, not even dreams!"
The audience knows that he had his
own dreams prior to their infiltration
by such unsavory image 17 as the gov
ernment monster, and it realizes that
Lowry is increasingly losing his ability
to discern truth from fantasy.
His paranoia peaks when he sees
Jill Layton (Kim Greist), a woman a
lot like the one of his fantasy. In his
desperation, he rushes to tell her he
loves her despite having never met
her.
The story carries through Lowry's
fight to establish a human connection
through a relationship with Jill, and
his attempt to slay the beast of gov
ernment despite his precarious grasp

on reality. It ends with a sobering
reverberation of the futility of his ef
fort, much like the conclusion of Or
well's classic.
As Lowry, Pryce genuinely projects
his character's purity of heart
alongside his overwhelmed senses
and vulnerable mind. When Lowry
moves through "Brazil's" absurd so
ciety as if he were carrying on com
fortably in a normal place to live,
Pryce intensifies the satire inherent in
Gilliam's urban projections and the
irony of Lowry's ultimate inability to
rationally survive the world of" Brazil."
Robert DeNiro drops in and out of
a couple of scenes as Archibald
Tuttle, the heating engineer sought
after by Information Retrieval for
"freelance subversion." He is strong
as usual, and his demise in Lowry's
mind is one of Gilliam's most haunt
ing images.
Gilliam recruited one of his Python
comrades, Michael Palin, to play In
formation Retrieval's inter
rogator/torture specialist Jack Lint.
Palin is brilliant as Lint, a speck float
ing to the top of the government
hierarchy, who is a foil for the
misplaced and detached Lowry.
The true attraction of "Brazil" is its
total conception skillfully ad
ministrated by Gilliam. This film is
not conventional, and this alone is a
statement of praise for anything com
ing from Hollywood's movie assem
bly line. However, it is not surprising
Gilliam had to fight Universal Studios
to get his picture released in its cur
rent form.
After all, it is artistically original,
socially controversial and intellectu
ally satiable. Gilliam has delivered to
us the gift of a unique and dynamic
vision, through his pictures and words,
and rather than wonder when the
next trend-breaking/trend-setting
movie will shine from the screen, we
should go see "Brazil."

treatments from Dr. Jaffe (Jim Broadbent) in Terry Gilliam's "Brazil."
Terry Gilliam's "Brazil" is not set
in South America, though it might as
well be. Whether or not the film's en
vironment is east of Tokyo, west of
London, or dead in the center of
Pittsburgh, Pa., is of no consequence.
In fact, pretend that Brazil, the
United States, Europe and all the
world's modernity were stuffed into a
test tube and mixed, shaken,
reconstituted and projected in its new
form onto tht giant Hollywood
screen, and welcome yourself to the
laboratory of Gilliam's inexorable
imagination.
The film's unique depiction of ram
pant urbanity, bloated bureaucracy
and its effect upon the poor and fum
bling clan of humanity is the direc
tor's satiric contortion of the modern
world.
The relentless and sardonic artistic
vision of "Brazil's" director is not new
to Monty Python fans. Gilliam is and
has been the British comedy troupe's
animator and sole American cohort
since its first convening. Having had a
creative hand in much of Python's
work, including co-direction of the
society-ridiculing standard, "Monty
Python's The Meaning of Life," Gil
liam has asserted that anything held
sacred by the human herd is a hover
ing blimp for the harpoon of his wit.
"Brazil" is laden with Gilliam's
sardonic imaging, which he achieves
primarily through his artist's lens, but
also through his director's sense of
timing the film medium's various ef
fecting elements. A punch of music, a
cut from one scene to another, and a
special effect that ambushes the audi
ence can each squeeze laughs out of a
moment.
Yet "Brazil" does not merely reaf
firm Gilliam's mastery of comic im
aging, as has been previously exhib

ited in his Python contributions and
his last directorial effort, "Time Ban
dits." His new creation rises above
the Python conglomerated-skit for
mat, which relies primarily on the
pure comedic talents of the players
and the director. Rather, "Brazil"
settles Gilliam's vision into the
structure of a powerful story, as pro
vided by his and collaborators Tom
Stoppard and Charles McKeown's
screenplay.
The story is a derivative of George
Orwell's "1984." Government is a
huge beast whose breath is felt by
every individual, and as Orwell's Big
Brother requires the subjection of the
individual will to the will of the state,
the immensity of "Brazil's" govern
ment commands human energy to
maintain it.
However, Brazil's vulnerability to
internal bursts of terrorism — per
petuated by what government
Information Retrieval Director
Eugene Helpmann (Peter Vaughan)
labels "bad sportsmanship" — as well
as the preponderance of T.V. screens
playing old-time movies as opposed to
an immobile slide of Big Brother's
face, puts the film's society in a some
what less developed category than
Orwell's.
As a result, the movie's protagonist,
Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce), is free
to dream of the giant government
monster stopping him from con
sumating with his version of Venus,
whereas Orwell's protagonist, Win
ston, cannot make a move in his mind
without fearing the "thought police."
In contrast to Orwell's stark society,
the objective reality in "Brazil" is so
absurdly littered with grotesque
gadgetry and over-fed urbanity that
Lowry cannot help but retreat into his
elaborately portrayed fantasy world.
Lowry embodies the struggle to or
der an existence that, thanks to Gil

liam's penchant for invention, is
ridiculously unmanageable. He
wanders through his occupational life
in the government's Ministry of In
formation, in which millions of papers
fly through hands and wall pipes (ask
Gilliam) to perhaps end in their
proper places; and through his iso
lated homelife, in which his flat is a
typically " Brazil"-ian menagerie of
fallible automation.
Yet Lowry's immersion in the ab
surd — from his mother's (played by

Katherine Helmond) face-stretching
treatments with her miracle-worker
plastic surgeon/beautician, to his
reliance on the government's bum
bling public service panacea in
famously known as "Central
Services" to fix (sabotage) his failed
monster-of-a-heating system — clouds
the boundary between his perception
of the real world and his protective
fantasy world.
One can trace Lowry's conflict
through the progression of his fanta

sies. His first one is a subconscious
dream, in which he flies like Icarus
meant to fly, towards the suspended
image of his Venus, gently carving the
air in a path to her lips.
This is the only fantasy in which
things are perfect, and as his flight to
his dream woman becomes increas
ingly diverted by monstrous construc
tions and their monster protector (the
personification of government), one
realizes that Lowry's true hope is to
establish a human connection despite
the smothering obesity of his ob
jective world.
As his fantasies creep out of his
sleep and into his waking thoughts, it
becomes clear that his situation is
desperate, and that his detachment
from human beings is hopelessly
rooted in what cannot be overcome:
his reliance on an isolating bureau
cratic job, which is hopelessly insu
lated within a gluttonous government
structure that swallows individual
aspiration.
So when his mother asks him if he
has any ambition or any dreams after
he refuses an offer to transfer from
his job with the Department of
Records to the more prestigious
Bureau of Information Retrieval, he
screams, "No, not even dreams!"
The audience knows that he had his
own dreams prior to their infiltration
by such unsavory image 17 as the gov
ernment monster, and it realizes that
Lowry is increasingly losing his ability
to discern truth from fantasy.
His paranoia peaks when he sees
Jill Layton (Kim Greist), a woman a
lot like the one of his fantasy. In his
desperation, he rushes to tell her he
loves her despite having never met
her.
The story carries through Lowry's
fight to establish a human connection
through a relationship with Jill, and
his attempt to slay the beast of gov
ernment despite his precarious grasp

on reality. It ends with a sobering
reverberation of the futility of his ef
fort, much like the conclusion of Or
well's classic.
As Lowry, Pryce genuinely projects
his character's purity of heart
alongside his overwhelmed senses
and vulnerable mind. When Lowry
moves through "Brazil's" absurd so
ciety as if he were carrying on com
fortably in a normal place to live,
Pryce intensifies the satire inherent in
Gilliam's urban projections and the
irony of Lowry's ultimate inability to
rationally survive the world of" Brazil."
Robert DeNiro drops in and out of
a couple of scenes as Archibald
Tuttle, the heating engineer sought
after by Information Retrieval for
"freelance subversion." He is strong
as usual, and his demise in Lowry's

fight to establish a human connection
through a relationship with Jill, and
his attempt to slay the beast of gov
ernment despite his precarious grasp

on reality. It ends with a sobering
reverberation of the futility of his ef
fort, much like the conclusion of Or
well's classic.
As Lowry, Pryce genuinely projects
his character's purity of heart
alongside his overwhelmed senses
and vulnerable mind. When Lowry
moves through "Brazil's" absurd so
ciety as if he were carrying on com
fortably in a normal place to live,
Pryce intensifies the satire inherent in
Gilliam's urban projections and the
irony of Lowry's ultimate inability to
rationally survive the world of" Brazil."
Robert DeNiro drops in and out of
a couple of scenes as Archibald
Tuttle, the heating engineer sought
after by Information Retrieval for
"freelance subversion." He is strong
as usual, and his demise in Lowry's
mind is one of Gilliam's most haunt
ing images.
Gilliam recruited one of his Python
comrades, Michael Palin, to play In
formation Retrieval's inter
rogator/torture specialist Jack Lint.
Palin is brilliant as Lint, a speck float
ing to the top of the government
hierarchy, who is a foil for the
misplaced and detached Lowry.
The true attraction of "Brazil" is its
total conception skillfully ad
ministrated by Gilliam. This film is
not conventional, and this alone is a
statement of praise for anything com
ing from Hollywood's movie assem
bly line. However, it is not surprising
Gilliam had to fight Universal Studios
to get his picture released in its cur
rent form.
After all, it is artistically original,
socially controversial and intellectu
ally satiable. Gilliam has delivered to
us the gift of a unique and dynamic
vision, through his pictures and words,
and rather than wonder when the
next trend-breaking/trend-setting
movie will shine from the screen, we
should go see "Brazil."
