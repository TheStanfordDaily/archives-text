This week, we have replaced our star rating system with a Republican
rating system. That is as much explanation as you'll get.
Selected cuts from these albums will be played tomorrow on KZSU at 6
p.m.
Falco — "Falco"
Reagan Reagan Reagan Bush
Austrians are clever people. They've found out that the best way for
bands with trite lyrics to elude critical wrath is to sing in foreign lan
guages.
And a band like Falco needs all the lyrical evasion it can get, with
over-long mixes of alyrical songs like "Rock Me Amadeus," "Vienna
Calling" and other poetic atrocities. What, another boring critics' field
day on another nouveau-disco band?
Nope. Not us. We're not proud. Once in a while, pounding drum
machines and Teutonic rapping can be cool. There's some good stuff
here — "melodies" which sustain the songs for as long as they last (but
please don't make them any longer), the German is kind of exotic,
there's a coupla mellow songs, but most of all, ve haff ze danz songs!
And good ones, too.
Falco is one of the most brazen dance bands, coming tight out and tel
ling ya what kind of music it'll be, with descriptive subheadings like "The
Relevant Madhouse Danceteria Jour-Fix-Mix." There's no mistaking
what that will sound like.
Of course, there are people in the music world that take their self
parodies seriously. We hope that Falco's self-aggrandizing, over-mixed,
over-long, not to mention ridiculously-subtitled way-dog-party-dance
stuff is all in fun. We'll laugh (and dance) as long as they do.
Feargal Sharkey, "Feargal Sharkey"
Reagan Reagan Reagan
Well, here's another review of someone trying to make it big the old
fashioned way, by getting as many famous people as possible to help him
out with the album. Feargal Sharkey is of little distinction except for two
things. He was the vocalist of the Undertones, an Irish punk band of ga
rage jam infamy, and he somehow convinced David Stewart of Euryth
mics fame toco-write five songs and produce this album.
If you liked the Undertones, you'll hate, absolutely hate, this record.
This is the stuff of commercialism: songs done with simple synthesizers
and trumpets and standard backbeats about a girl that dumps on him, or
about how a good heart is hard to find these days, or about a girl that
dumps on him, or about trying to find "true love." or about a girl that
dumps on him ... enough said. Not very innovative musically, but
nevertheless, he's got some good pop tunes on the record.
Feargal does have a distinctive voice, a trill tenor with an almost
feminine quality. It's a voice that manages to ride above the music's
limitations and not make you feel so bad about getting the album. You
gotta hope he gets some better songs for his next one, though.
Public Image, Ltd. —"Album"
Reagan Reagan Reagan Kemp
Those of you already into metal-punk can go on out and get this, put it
on loud over your headphones and fry away. For non-anarchists, PIL is
your basic post-punk band, headed by ex-Pistol John "ny Rotten"
Lydon. Lots of guitars, heavy drums and wailin' away vocals. And once
in a while, it's not all that bad, either.
Previous hits like "Public Image," "This is not a Love Song" and
"Bad Life" are the band's strongest, and the pattern of a-few-palatable
songs-per-album-and-the-rest-drive-you -nuts continues.
Lydon's banshee-esque screaming made Time Zone's "World
Destruction" great, but "Album," which is 40 minutes' worth of it. is a
whole new ballgame. Expect all your roommates to leave by the third
song, and the whole dorm to be dark by the middle of side two.
Occasionally, a song here hints toward commercial appeal. But lis
teners shouldn't be fooled. Lydon demonstrates his commitment toward
anti-everythingism all too overtly throughout the record.
Let's not get cynical, though. The Sex Pistols made monotonous
anarchy into platinum, and Lydon knows his roots all right. Cheap shots
at society don't come any cruder, nor any more effective. Primal-rock
fans can have the rare opportunity of owning an album that's as fun to
play as it is to smash. (And Johnny would approve. But you should still
save the cool cover.)
