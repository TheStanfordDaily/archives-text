# 'Gardenia' portrays fall of small Utopia
## 
### PAT FREYTAG 
"We had a class of men once, not
long ago, in whom reverence for all
that was venerable, love for all that
was beautiful, sympathy for all that
was noble in that Old World gave
breath and firmness to their zeal for
the fresher, purer, truer life which
they believed to be found in the
New" (Atlantic Monthly, 1K75). The
four main characters of John Guare's
play "Gardenia" belong to this class
of men and women.
The play tells of a nurse and three
veterans who reject the chaos and op
portunism of post-Civil War New
England and form a socialist
commune on Nantucket Island where
they aim to live "a life of the mind."
The first act opens seven yeais into
their "utopic" lifestyle (June, 1875)
when all things in the perfect insula
tion of Aipotu (Utopia spelled back
wards) begin to deteriorate. Lydie
Breeze, the nurse, is forced to go into
town to earn some badly needed
money by performing the services of
a midwife for an aristocrat.
Joshua Hickman, a literary man
who put the group's experiences into
a journal, receives a scathing letter
from one of the most revered editors
in Boston wherein he demolishes
Hickman's "magnum opus" on the
transcendental purpose of life. This
work has taken the whole seven years
to write; the futility of his effort
makes him deem these the "Sisyphus
years."
Amos Mason, overwhelmed by
physical loneliness and intellectual
boredom, subjects himself to ridicule
by his peers when he participates in
the town carnival.
Dan Grady, a railroad conductor
who has not been seen or heard from
for two months, returns to Aipotu
with a suitcase full of bribe-money
meant for President Ulysses S. Grant.
Drunk from champagne, he
proclaims it to be "untraceable
manna."
With their financial necessities
redressed, it appears as if the four
commune members can continue to
live and work in their model society,
to make it "shine like a beacon to the
world." But their attempt to live a
manifesto in defiance of the social
and political institutions of the time is
soon irreversibly marred by one of
the very institutions they abhor —
money. Money provides opportunity

and opportunism; Aipotu can no
longer exist.
Since its creation, Aipotu is beset
by the institution of marriage as
Lydie and Joshua are forced to wed
so they can buy the land for the
commune. Although at first it is only
a pragmatic arrangement, their mar
riage engenders a jealousy between
Joshua and Dan Grady, Lydie's lover.
Grady, however, manages to con
vince Joshua to tour Europe and the
Far East so that he might see the
worlds of the philosophers he reads.
Joshua soon leaves for "Europe — to
look for gods."
Meanwhile, Amos can no longer
bear the isolation and intellectual
stagnation of the commune, and he
departs from Nantucket to prepare
for law school at Harvard. Dan and
Lydie are left alone, and Aipotu
ceases to exist.
The second act opens nine years
later in Boston (December, 1884).
One of the commune members is
dead; another is in prison. One has
become a prominent lawyer in the
world of corrupt politics and is run

ning for a powerful seat in the Senate.
The last is alone and exiled.
This act is not a resolution of the
story line. Rather, it is an intensifica
tion of the four "utopic" characters'
disintegration as set up in Act One.
The principles for which Aipotu
stands fall prey to what they have at
tempted to reject; the institutions
that allow for the corruption of
human values. By the end, the
idealists are subjugated by the biggest
institution of all — politics.
Under the skilled direction of
Susan Marsden, Sigrid Wurshmidt,
playing the role of Lydie Breeze,
transmits her desperation and sense
of failure as a leader so well that the
viewer is left with a sensation of near
catharsis. Her description of the red
rain from the volcano Krakatoa is es
pecially gripping and terrifying.
Julian Lopez-Morillas, as Amos
Mason, is excellent in transforming his
character from a lost and lonely fool
into a New York lawyer whose quest
for power and prestige disregards
human fragility. His betrayal of the
principles which created Aipotu is

severely felt by the viewer through
the constrast he creates in his charac
ter between the first and second act.
Dennis Barnett convinces the
viewer to side with him by the sin
cerity with which he portrays Joshua
Hickman. Hickman is the most pas
sionate and committed of the charac
ters, and his perseverance and love
for his art can potentially captivate
the viewer. Barnett's sincerity as
Hickman kept the audience in his
confidence, and it is this abiltity to
sustain the audience throughout the
play that renders the end so powerful.
Jack Shearer plays both the role of
Dan Grady and the jailer O'Malley
very well. In both parts he is the
provider of intermittent humor which
allows the audience some distance
from the play's serious and often
profound thematic structure.
"Gardenia" is the second of a four
part series of plays called "The Nan
tucket Cycle." It runs through March
9 at the Eureka Theatre Company,
2730 16th Street at Harrison, San
Francisco. For further information

stands fall prey to what they have at
tempted to reject; the institutions
that allow for the corruption of
human values. By the end, the
idealists are subjugated by the biggest
institution of all — politics.
Under the skilled direction of
Susan Marsden, Sigrid Wurshmidt,
playing the role of Lydie Breeze,
transmits her desperation and sense
of failure as a leader so well that the
viewer is left with a sensation of near
catharsis. Her description of the red
rain from the volcano Krakatoa is es
pecially gripping and terrifying.
Julian Lopez-Morillas, as Amos
Mason, is excellent in transforming his
character from a lost and lonely fool
into a New York lawyer whose quest
for power and prestige disregards
human fragility. His betrayal of the
principles which created Aipotu is

severely felt by the viewer through
the constrast he creates in his charac
ter between the first and second act.
Dennis Barnett convinces the
viewer to side with him by the sin
cerity with which he portrays Joshua
Hickman. Hickman is the most pas
sionate and committed of the charac
ters, and his perseverance and love
for his art can potentially captivate
the viewer. Barnett's sincerity as
Hickman kept the audience in his
confidence, and it is this abiltity to
sustain the audience throughout the
play that renders the end so powerful.
Jack Shearer plays both the role of
Dan Grady and the jailer O'Malley
very well. In both parts he is the
provider of intermittent humor which
allows the audience some distance
from the play's serious and often
profound thematic structure.
"Gardenia" is the second of a four
part series of plays called "The Nan
tucket Cycle." It runs through March
9 at the Eureka Theatre Company,
2730 16th Street at Harrison, San
Francisco. For further information

Jack Shearer, Julian Lopez-Morillas and Dennis Barnett, members of the cast of "Gardenia," express the
frustration occurring as a result of the deterioration of their Utopian vision.
"We had a class of men once, not
long ago, in whom reverence for all
that was venerable, love for all that
was beautiful, sympathy for all that
was noble in that Old World gave
breath and firmness to their zeal for
the fresher, purer, truer life which
they believed to be found in the
New" (Atlantic Monthly, 1K75). The
four main characters of John Guare's
play "Gardenia" belong to this class
of men and women.
The play tells of a nurse and three
veterans who reject the chaos and op
portunism of post-Civil War New
England and form a socialist
commune on Nantucket Island where
they aim to live "a life of the mind."
The first act opens seven yeais into
their "utopic" lifestyle (June, 1875)
when all things in the perfect insula
tion of Aipotu (Utopia spelled back
wards) begin to deteriorate. Lydie
Breeze, the nurse, is forced to go into
town to earn some badly needed
money by performing the services of
a midwife for an aristocrat.
Joshua Hickman, a literary man
who put the group's experiences into
a journal, receives a scathing letter
from one of the most revered editors
in Boston wherein he demolishes
Hickman's "magnum opus" on the
transcendental purpose of life. This
work has taken the whole seven years
to write; the futility of his effort
makes him deem these the "Sisyphus
years."
Amos Mason, overwhelmed by
physical loneliness and intellectual
boredom, subjects himself to ridicule
by his peers when he participates in
the town carnival.
Dan Grady, a railroad conductor
who has not been seen or heard from
for two months, returns to Aipotu
with a suitcase full of bribe-money
meant for President Ulysses S. Grant.
Drunk from champagne, he
proclaims it to be "untraceable
manna."
With their financial necessities
redressed, it appears as if the four
commune members can continue to
live and work in their model society,
to make it "shine like a beacon to the
world." But their attempt to live a
manifesto in defiance of the social
and political institutions of the time is
soon irreversibly marred by one of
the very institutions they abhor —
money. Money provides opportunity

and opportunism; Aipotu can no
longer exist.
Since its creation, Aipotu is beset
by the institution of marriage as
Lydie and Joshua are forced to wed
so they can buy the land for the
commune. Although at first it is only
a pragmatic arrangement, their mar
riage engenders a jealousy between
Joshua and Dan Grady, Lydie's lover.
Grady, however, manages to con
vince Joshua to tour Europe and the
Far East so that he might see the
worlds of the philosophers he reads.
Joshua soon leaves for "Europe — to
look for gods."
Meanwhile, Amos can no longer
bear the isolation and intellectual
stagnation of the commune, and he
departs from Nantucket to prepare
for law school at Harvard. Dan and
Lydie are left alone, and Aipotu
ceases to exist.
The second act opens nine years
later in Boston (December, 1884).
One of the commune members is
dead; another is in prison. One has
become a prominent lawyer in the
world of corrupt politics and is run

ning for a powerful seat in the Senate.
The last is alone and exiled.
This act is not a resolution of the
story line. Rather, it is an intensifica
tion of the four "utopic" characters'
disintegration as set up in Act One.
