# Kiss rocks despite lack of face paint
## 
### LIZ GOODMAN Staff writer 
There are probably more stu
dents out there than would care to
admit who were once fans of the
fire-breathing, blood-spitting and
leather-and-spike-adorned rock
band Kiss. But just as many fans
have undergone a change in their
musical tastes, Kiss too has un
dergone a transformation.
The band that appeared last
week at the Cow Palace projected
a dramatically different image
thc|n the one which gained Kiss its
notoriety.
Since their "unmasking"' in
1983, the members of Kiss have
abandoned the black and white
makeup and combat-ready leath
er stage gear. Their new dress
motif combines a color scheme of
fuchsia, chartreuse and royal blue.
The stage set has also lost the vi
olent, assaulting quality that had
characterized earlier tours. In
stead, last Tuesday's stage set in
cluded a giant lighting rig of the
band's insignia, and this time the
pyrotechnics originated from the
drum riser and the bass guitar
rather than from bassist Gene
Simmon's mouth.
These changes should not come
as a surprise, though. After all, the
band, currently on tour in support
of its 20th album, contains only
half of its original members. Sim
mons and vocalist Paul Stanley
formed Kiss in 1973, and they
have stuck with it through the
departure of drummer Peter Criss
in 1980 and guitarist Ace Frehley
in 1983.
Criss and Frehley have since
been replaced by drummer Eric
Carr and guitarist Bruce Kulick.
The replacements have not
brought about a decline in the
quality of the band's music. In
fact, their last two albums,
"Animalize" and "Asylum," have
added new dimensions to the Kiss
sound.
The new Kiss has, however, met
with a decline in fans. The crowd
last Tuesday night was a disap

pointing 5,700 (the Cow Palace
seats 15,000). But for Simmons
and Stanley, who have played to
more than their share of lull
houses, the financial aspect seems
to have assumed a secondary
priority to the sheer enjoyment of
performing and satisfying their
longtime fans.
Appropriately enough, the band
that opened for Kiss is infamous
for its Kiss-like techniques. The
onstage behavior of Los Angeles
based shock-rock band W.A.S.P.
has included drinking blood from
a skull and throwing raw meat into
the audience.
But just as in the case of Kiss,
the members of W.A.S.P. have
subdued their live performance.
On this tour they chose to have
bigger-than-life-sized plastic ef
figies of the band members'
decapitated heads decorating the
stage.

W.A.S.P., which is comprised of
Blackie Lawless on bass guitar and
lead vocals, Steve Riley on drums
and Randy Piper and Chris
Holmes on lead guitar, was an ob
ject of condemnation during the
congressional hearings on record
ratings last year.
Lawless seemed pleased Tues
day night as he announced to the
audience that during the hearings,
W.A.S.P. had been labeled
"sexual perverts" and "every
mother's worst nightmare." And
from the lyrics on their second ef
fort, 'The Last Command," it is
obvious that the band is not trying
to avoid controversy.
