## Hits and misses for Stanford Cardinal snares star lineman from Cal, but loses others 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff writer 
Yesterday marked the first day that
the country's high school football
recruits could sign national letters of
intent.
All told, the Stanford football pro
gram received 15 written commit
ments from its high school recruits,
nine of whom were from California.
A total of seven different states were
represented by this year's recruiting
class, which Stanford Coach Jack El
way called "a group of great, talented
young men."
"I think the coaching staff did a

tremendous job competing for these
players against the top schools in the
country," Elway said. "There are a
lot of impact players in this group."
According to Cardinal Recruiting
Coach Dick James, Stanford espe
cially solidified its quarterback, of
fensive line and wide receiver posi
tions.
"We wanted to provide ourselves
with some greater quarterback
stability. We have definitely done
that," James said. "We also wanted
the big receiver and added offensive
line depth, and 1 think we've done
that too."
The big receiver James was refer

ring to is Ed McCaffrey, a 6-foot-6,
220-pound receiver from Allen
town, Pa. A Parade All-American
and a Street and Smith's Top 50 selec
tion, McCaffrey chose Stanford over
such perennial powerhouses as Mi
chigan, Notre Dame and Penn State.
With his 4.5 speed in the 40-yard
dash, McCaffrey will most likely be
expected to play wide receiver.
The Cardinal's biggest recruiting
catch may well be offensive lineman
Mike Kohlmoos of Visalia. Re
garded as the No. 2 prospect in the
country by Max Emfinger's Top 100
Football Prospects, Kohlmoos had
earlier made a verbal commitment to
attend California.
Much to the chagrin of the Bears,
the Ail-American Kohlmoos just
recently decided to matriculate at
Stanford.
The 6-5, 250-pound Kohlmoos
cited the "combination of academics,
football, the environment, the people
and the policies" as the swaying fac
tors in his decision. "It (Stanford)
just fit me best," he said.
With John Paye entering his senior
season, a strong desire for a good
quarterback has arisen. The Cardinal
satisfied this need by signing two
highly-touted prospects — Steve
Stark of Mission Viejo and Brian
Johnson of Oakland.
During his high school career.
Stark completed 69 percent of his
passes for over 3,000 yards. Last
year, he was the leading passer in
California and is currently second in
state history.
Johnson, meanwhile, was an All-
Bay Area and All-Oakland Athletic
League selection during his senior
season.
While Stanford benefited greatly
on offense, it suffered some disap
pointment on the defensive side, most

notably failing to sign a defensive
back, a position that has been
suspect throughout the last two years.
The Cardinal did, however, secure
three solid linebackers in Mark Han
son, Chris Hawkins and Jono Tun
ney. Tunney and Hawkins both
earned Honorable Mention in the
Long Beach Press-Telegram Best of
the West for 1986.
Unlike the last two years, Stanford
did not come close to fulfilling its
scholarship allotment.
"We probably could have offered
five more scholarships," James said.
"We recruit the quality student ath
lete. We've always been determined
to have both the student and the ath
lete."
James felt it was too early to make
any predictions about any one player
making an immediate impact, claim
ing "it would be unfair to single out
someone."
Nonetheless, the general consensus
of both Elway and James was that this
recruiting class would compete
favorably for spots on next season's
team.
"If they (the recruits) make it, fine.
If there is any question, they will be
redshirted." Elway said.
The remaining recruits are as fol
lows: Defensive linemen Chuck Gil
ling h a m. Dan Nash and Scott
Palmbush: offensive linemen Darran
Baird and Greg Gerardi; running
backs Jon Volpe and Charlie Young
and outside linebacker Kevin Mes
cher.
Unfortunately, three highly-touted
prospects — two All-Americas and
an Oklahoma All-Stater, were left off
the list.
Ail-American quarterback Billy
Kay, whose top five collegiate choices
were Stanford, Georgia Tech, Notre

Dame, Miami and Alabama, has
pared it down to Alabama or Georgia
Tech, according to Atlanta sources.
Stanford lost Oklahoma running
back Vernon Brown, considered
"one of the top three backs in the

country" by his high school coach, to
Oklahoma State because it was closer
to home.
Adam Cooney, a 6-7. 275-pound
All-American, chose Washington
over both Stanford and California.

A few recruiting prizes may have gotten away, hut yesterday was gener
ally a happy one for Stanford Coach Jack Elway. The Cardinal signed
15 players to letters of intent. Elway called his new charges "a group of
great, talented young men."
