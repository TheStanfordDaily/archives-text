# Is S.I. swimsuit issue sporting? Does it matter?
## 
### 
Marsha Brady, the eldest girl of
the Brady clan, stood reflectively
at the edge of the Brady front
lawn. Her brothers Peter and
Greg, meanwhile, were engaged in
some causal football nearby. The
scene was set. Inevitably, utter
turmoil was soon to transpire.

Quicker than you can say
"Bobby's a stinker," an errant
Peter Brady pass clipped the inno
cent Marsha on the nose, render
ing her snootet bruised and bat
tered. Olfactory oblivion.
The swelling stayed as did the

hurt feelings. Marsha was vic
timized. She fell prey to the of
tentimes obscene world of sports.
I cite this example not to shock
or horrify people, but rather to
provide a contrast to what many
feel is another annual sports
obscenity â€” the Sports Illustrated
Swimsuit Issue.
The third leading seller behind
the Super Bowl and Year in
Review issues, the S.I. swimsuit
issue has achieved a huge follow
ing and status. In response, other
sports magazines have begun to
emulate this traditional winterland
break.
So many people are involved,
perhaps it isn't all that bad, af
terall.

great swimsuits." said senior Kellv
