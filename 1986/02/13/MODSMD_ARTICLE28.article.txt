# Is S.I. swimsuit issue sporting? Does it matter?

### 
Marsha Brady, the eldest girl of
the Brady clan, stood reflectively
at the edge of the Brady front
lawn. Her brothers Peter and
Greg, meanwhile, were engaged in
some causal football nearby. The
scene was set. Inevitably, utter
turmoil was soon to transpire.

Quicker than you can say
"Bobby's a stinker," an errant
Peter Brady pass clipped the inno
cent Marsha on the nose, render
ing her snootet bruised and bat
tered. Olfactory oblivion.
The swelling stayed as did the

hurt feelings. Marsha was vic
timized. She fell prey to the of
tentimes obscene world of sports.
I cite this example not to shock
or horrify people, but rather to
provide a contrast to what many
feel is another annual sports
obscenity — the Sports Illustrated
Swimsuit Issue.
The third leading seller behind
the Super Bowl and Year in
Review issues, the S.I. swimsuit
issue has achieved a huge follow
ing and status. In response, other
sports magazines have begun to
emulate this traditional winterland
break.
So many people are involved,
perhaps it isn't all that bad, af
terall.
"I thought there were some
great swimsuits." said senior Kellv


ERIK
ESELIUS
Campell, who also added that she's
seen more suggestive poses in other
magazines like Cosmopolitan.
Sophomore Caroline Pappajohn
voiced a similiar observation. "It
(cover photo) seemed like it should
have been on Vogue."
Well, Marsha's nose should have
been in medical journals, but it
wasn't. The fact of the matter is that
Elle Macpherson's scantily-clad body
appeared on the front of Sports Il
lustrated, a magazine presumably
geared towards conventionally
accepted sports.
The tie between hockey pucks,
lacrosse sticks and swimsuits is a tad
tenuous. This blatant discrepancy in
theme angers some, yet delights
others.
The real fun begins when S.I.
receives the mail some two weeks
thereafter. Every year the responses,
both positive and negative, are gener
ally predictable.
The Cold Weather Group: Con
gratulations on another fine swimsuit
issue. After three months of shovel
ing snow, a tropical vacation was
much needed. Thanks for the thaw.
Buffalo, New York.
Angry Librarians: An outrage and
a disgrace. Sports 1111 ustrated has
reached a new level of moral
depravity. After seeing this week's
issue, we will no longer carry your
publication on our library shelves.
Think of today's children next time.

Angry Kids in Libraries: We've
heard a lot about the swimsuit issue,
but we can't seem to get our hands on
a copy. We're desperate. Could you
please send about 200 copies.
Thanks. Des Moines, lowa.
The Last Straw Group: I've been a
faithful subscriber to Sports Il
lustrated for the past 20 years, and
never— and I repeat never— have I
seen this magazine reach such lows.
Stick to sports, not smut. Cancel my
subscription. Decatur, Illinois.
One Word Positives: "Fanatastic."
"Wowie." "Hot."
Jerrv Falwell Group: In today's so

eiety, we are incessantly confronted
with morally-repugnant (sic) realities
that are perpetuated by your harmful
glorification of perversity. Perhaps
Sport Illustrated should stop and
reconsider its role as a perpetrator of
pornography. El Paso, Texas.
One Word Negatives:
"Abhorrent." "Disgusting."
"Shameful."
Hormonal Takeover Group: Just
when I thought it would never arrive,
it came. What a godsend. Elle Mac
pherson and Kathy Ireland are out of
this world. This should be biweekly.
Why do you make me suffer so? Give
me more. Boise, Idaho.
The overall ratio of positive com
ments to negative ones will probably
be on the order of seven to three.

In this years swimsuit issue, one
additional letter will address the sub
ject of the loosely-clothed Bora Bora
natives on the following pages.
Speaking of obscene: Ihe final
score read 35-0. My first reaction was
to check the USFL schedule to see
whether preseason began early.
Bowling seemed unlikely and chess
players usually do not play best out ot
69 — it usually takes them a year or
so to finish a seven game series.
Finally, in the far reaches ot my
mind, somewhere in right field, it
dawned on me to investigate the
baseball box scores. Sure enough,
Tuesday's baseball game between
Stanford and Stanislaus State did,
indeed, show a final count ot 35-0.
Abhorrent. Shameful. Let me thaw.


The Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue may be the most talked-about
issue of the year, but another interesting issue comes out two weeks
later, when the reactions to the swimsuits are printed. These letters
usually range from the enthusiastic "Thanks" to the equally enthusiastic
"Cancel my subscription."

(cover photo) seemed like it should
have been on Vogue."
Well, Marsha's nose should have
been in medical journals, but it
wasn't. The fact of the matter is that
Elle Macpherson's scantily-clad body
appeared on the front of Sports Il
lustrated, a magazine presumably
geared towards conventionally
accepted sports.
The tie between hockey pucks,
lacrosse sticks and swimsuits is a tad
tenuous. This blatant discrepancy in
theme angers some, yet delights
others.
The real fun begins when S.I.
receives the mail some two weeks
thereafter. Every year the responses,
both positive and negative, are gener
ally predictable.
The Cold Weather Group: Con
gratulations on another fine swimsuit
issue. After three months of shovel
ing snow, a tropical vacation was
much needed. Thanks for the thaw.
Buffalo, New York.
Angry Librarians: An outrage and
a disgrace. Sports 1111 ustrated has
reached a new level of moral
depravity. After seeing this week's
issue, we will no longer carry your
publication on our library shelves.
Think of today's children next time.

Angry Kids in Libraries: We've
heard a lot about the swimsuit issue,
but we can't seem to get our hands on
a copy. We're desperate. Could you
please send about 200 copies.
Thanks. Des Moines, lowa.
The Last Straw Group: I've been a
faithful subscriber to Sports Il
lustrated for the past 20 years, and
never— and I repeat never— have I
seen this magazine reach such lows.
Stick to sports, not smut. Cancel my
subscription. Decatur, Illinois.
One Word Positives: "Fanatastic."
"Wowie." "Hot."
Jerrv Falwell Group: In today's so

eiety, we are incessantly confronted
with morally-repugnant (sic) realities
that are perpetuated by your harmful
glorification of perversity. Perhaps
Sport Illustrated should stop and
reconsider its role as a perpetrator of
pornography. El Paso, Texas.
One Word Negatives:
"Abhorrent." "Disgusting."
"Shameful."
Hormonal Takeover Group: Just
when I thought it would never arrive,
it came. What a godsend. Elle Mac
pherson and Kathy Ireland are out of
this world. This should be biweekly.
Why do you make me suffer so? Give
me more. Boise, Idaho.
The overall ratio of positive com
ments to negative ones will probably
be on the order of seven to three.

In this years swimsuit issue, one
additional letter will address the sub
ject of the loosely-clothed Bora Bora
natives on the following pages.
Speaking of obscene: Ihe final
score read 35-0. My first reaction was
to check the USFL schedule to see
whether preseason began early.
Bowling seemed unlikely and chess
players usually do not play best out ot
69 — it usually takes them a year or
so to finish a seven game series.
Finally, in the far reaches ot my
mind, somewhere in right field, it
dawned on me to investigate the
baseball box scores. Sure enough,
Tuesday's baseball game between
Stanford and Stanislaus State did,
indeed, show a final count ot 35-0.
Abhorrent. Shameful. Let me thaw.


The Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue may be the most talked-about
issue of the year, but another interesting issue comes out two weeks
later, when the reactions to the swimsuits are printed. These letters
usually range from the enthusiastic "Thanks" to the equally enthusiastic
"Cancel my subscription."
Marsha Brady, the eldest girl of
the Brady clan, stood reflectively
at the edge of the Brady front
lawn. Her brothers Peter and
Greg, meanwhile, were engaged in
some causal football nearby. The
scene was set. Inevitably, utter
turmoil was soon to transpire.

Quicker than you can say
"Bobby's a stinker," an errant
Peter Brady pass clipped the inno
cent Marsha on the nose, render
ing her snootet bruised and bat
tered. Olfactory oblivion.
The swelling stayed as did the

hurt feelings. Marsha was vic
timized. She fell prey to the of
tentimes obscene world of sports.
I cite this example not to shock
or horrify people, but rather to
provide a contrast to what many
feel is another annual sports
obscenity — the Sports Illustrated
Swimsuit Issue.
The third leading seller behind
the Super Bowl and Year in
Review issues, the S.I. swimsuit
issue has achieved a huge follow
ing and status. In response, other
sports magazines have begun to
emulate this traditional winterland
break.
So many people are involved,
perhaps it isn't all that bad, af
terall.

great swimsuits." said senior Kellv

Campell, who also added that she's
seen more suggestive poses in other
magazines like Cosmopolitan.
