# A 						beginner's guide to collegiate sailing

"Watching sailboats race is about
as exciting as watching grass grow or
paint dry."
That's the opinion of many who
know nothing about competitive
sailing, and it might explain why so
few people are familiar with the
sport. In this age of fast-paced spec
tacles, sailing races can be awfully
dull for the crowd.
If, however, you're more of a par
ticipant than a spectator, or if you're
just looking for an alternative to
thrill-a-minute spectator sports, it
may be worthwhile to learn more
about the alluring and addictive
racing that's done in sailboats.
In general, sailboat racing is much
like any other racing sport. The
sport's similarity to auto racing has. in
fact, given a distinctly un-nautical
flavor to today's sailing jargon: racing
sailors talk about who will be "driving
the boat," when it is best to "shift
gears" and the parts of the course
that are the "passing lanes."
As in other racing sports, sheer
velocity — sailors call it boatspeed —
is obviously a key ingredient to a suc
cessful race. Competent racing sailors
normally devote long hours of
practice to improving the speed of
their boats and the efficiency of their
sailing techniques in order to travel
just a fraction of a mile-per-hour
faster on the race course.
What sets sailboat racing apart
from many other racing sports,
thouiih, is the level of stratecv re

quired in competition. Unlike an
auto-racing track, a sailing course
allows the sailors a great deal of
flexibility in determining their route.
The course usually consists of three
buoys floating on the water's surface
and anchored to the bottom, ar
ranged in a triangular pattern. The
sailors must go around the triangle,
but what route they take from corner
to corner (buoy to buoy) is up to
them. Obviously, a straight line is of
ten the quickest path.
Sailboats, however, can't sail di
rectly into the wind, and must instead
zig-zag back and forth (at a 45-
degree angle to the direction they
want to go) in order to travel toward
the wind. This process, called tacking,
is one of the more basic techniques in
sailing.
Racing sailors are always balancing
speed and distance. Often they will
choose a longer route to increase
their speed — a tactic uncommon or
impossible in many other racing
sports. The point is. simply, to reach
the finish before your competitors,
but that simple goal can be met
through a complicated array of tech
niques.
The thirst for victory can also, of
course, bring about foul play. Sail
boat racing confronts the problem not
with referees or judges, but with a set
of rules and a mock court.
The U.S. Yacht Racing Union
maintains a set of very specific rules
that tell the sailor what is. and is not.
allowable during a race. When racing,
violations of the rules are protested
by the sailors who are the victims of
the infraction. Once the racing is
112 inished for the day, a jury then hears
ihe disputes and decides on their
validity.
Sometimes, however, it is unclear
whether rules have been broken. The
racing sailor's constant search for
ways to sail faster often unearths
methods that are questionably legal.

Currently, many space-age materials
being used to build boats and sails are
the center of controversy.
The fairly recent application of
physics to sailing has also been con
troversial; young, athletic sailors have
found ways of shifting their weight
and Happing their sails so that they
can sail past the older generation.
Some of the most talented young
sailors (including some of the best
body-shifters and sail-flappers) can
be found here at Stanford. Members
of the Stanford sailing team, easily
identified by their bright red jackets,
compete against other college sailing

teams across the nation.
Ranked as high as fourth in the na
tion this year, the team is comprised
of 16 two-person crews sailing 13-
foot Flying Junior class sailboats. In
California, each school brings this
type of boat to the weekend regattas
to allow each team to compete in
identical boats with identical sails.
The emphasis is thus placed on tal
ent and physical ability rather than
boat preparation. During the autumn
and spring quarters, the team puts in
10 hours of practice each week in
preparation for its regattas. If those
hours pay off, and Stanford does well
in the regional eliminations, it can ad
vance to the national championships.
College sailing is, however, just
one level of a sport that is popular
around the globe. Recent surveys
show that sailing is the second fastest
growing sport, behind only skiing, in
number of participants.
Those who choose to test their
sailing skill in racing can find compe
tition from the local level on up to the
Olympics.

through a complicated array of tech
niques.
The thirst for victory can also, of
course, bring about foul play. Sail
boat racing confronts the problem not
with referees or judges, but with a set
of rules and a mock court.
The U.S. Yacht Racing Union
maintains a set of very specific rules
that tell the sailor what is. and is not.
allowable during a race. When racing,
violations of the rules are protested
by the sailors who are the victims of
the infraction. Once the racing is
112 inished for the day, a jury then hears
ihe disputes and decides on their
validity.
Sometimes, however, it is unclear
whether rules have been broken. The
racing sailor's constant search for
ways to sail faster often unearths
methods that are questionably legal.

Currently, many space-age materials
being used to build boats and sails are
the center of controversy.
The fairly recent application of
physics to sailing has also been con
troversial; young, athletic sailors have
found ways of shifting their weight
and Happing their sails so that they
can sail past the older generation.
Some of the most talented young
sailors (including some of the best
body-shifters and sail-flappers) can
be found here at Stanford. Members
of the Stanford sailing team, easily
identified by their bright red jackets,
compete against other college sailing

teams across the nation.
Ranked as high as fourth in the na
tion this year, the team is comprised
of 16 two-person crews sailing 13-
foot Flying Junior class sailboats. In
California, each school brings this
type of boat to the weekend regattas
to allow each team to compete in
identical boats with identical sails.
The emphasis is thus placed on tal
ent and physical ability rather than
boat preparation. During the autumn
and spring quarters, the team puts in
10 hours of practice each week in
preparation for its regattas. If those
hours pay off, and Stanford does well
in the regional eliminations, it can ad
vance to the national championships.
College sailing is, however, just
one level of a sport that is popular
around the globe. Recent surveys
show that sailing is the second fastest
growing sport, behind only skiing, in
number of participants.
Those who choose to test their
sailing skill in racing can find compe
tition from the local level on up to the
Olympics.
"Watching sailboats race is about
as exciting as watching grass grow or
paint dry."
That's the opinion of many who
know nothing about competitive
sailing, and it might explain why so
few people are familiar with the
sport. In this age of fast-paced spec
tacles, sailing races can be awfully
dull for the crowd.
If, however, you're more of a par
ticipant than a spectator, or if you're
just looking for an alternative to
thrill-a-minute spectator sports, it
may be worthwhile to learn more
about the alluring and addictive
racing that's done in sailboats.
In general, sailboat racing is much
like any other racing sport. The
sport's similarity to auto racing has. in
fact, given a distinctly un-nautical
flavor to today's sailing jargon: racing
sailors talk about who will be "driving
the boat," when it is best to "shift
gears" and the parts of the course
that are the "passing lanes."
As in other racing sports, sheer
velocity — sailors call it boatspeed —
is obviously a key ingredient to a suc
cessful race. Competent racing sailors
normally devote long hours of
practice to improving the speed of
their boats and the efficiency of their
sailing techniques in order to travel
just a fraction of a mile-per-hour
faster on the race course.
What sets sailboat racing apart
from many other racing sports,
thouiih, is the level of stratecv re

quired in competition. Unlike an
auto-racing track, a sailing course
allows the sailors a great deal of
flexibility in determining their route.
The course usually consists of three
buoys floating on the water's surface
and anchored to the bottom, ar
ranged in a triangular pattern. The
sailors must go around the triangle,
but what route they take from corner
to corner (buoy to buoy) is up to
them. Obviously, a straight line is of
ten the quickest path.
Sailboats, however, can't sail di
rectly into the wind, and must instead
zig-zag back and forth (at a 45-
degree angle to the direction they
want to go) in order to travel toward
the wind. This process, called tacking,
is one of the more basic techniques in
sailing.
Racing sailors are always balancing
speed and distance. Often they will
choose a longer route to increase
their speed — a tactic uncommon or
impossible in many other racing
sports. The point is. simply, to reach
the finish before your competitors,
but that simple goal can be met
through a complicated array of tech
niques.
The thirst for victory can also, of
