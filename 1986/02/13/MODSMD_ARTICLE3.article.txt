### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
" I think 1988 is going to be a brand new ex
perience for everyone. Seeing as how there will
be no incumbent running, the nomination will
be wide open for both parties," a senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution said last night in an in
formal talk on the possibilities in the 1988 pres
idential race.
Martin Anderson, a former domestic policy
adviser to President Reagan, told an audience
of about 50 at Branner that "there will be no
dark horse candidates. People who win party

nominations are the old war horses."
Calling the presidential election "a fascinat
ing process that has enormous impact on what
course this country takes," Anderson said
Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.) would have an edge
because "a big advantage for a candidate is
having run for the presidency before."
"There is a veiy powerful tendency of the
American people to nominate people who have
held some state-wide office." Anderson said,
pointing to the successes of Reagan and former
President Jimmy Carter.
