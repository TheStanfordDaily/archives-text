# Fellow looks at '88 race
## 
### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
" I think 1988 is going to be a brand new ex
perience for everyone. Seeing as how there will
be no incumbent running, the nomination will
be wide open for both parties," a senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution said last night in an in
formal talk on the possibilities in the 1988 pres
idential race.
Martin Anderson, a former domestic policy
adviser to President Reagan, told an audience
of about 50 at Branner that "there will be no
dark horse candidates. People who win party

nominations are the old war horses."
Calling the presidential election "a fascinat
ing process that has enormous impact on what
course this country takes," Anderson said
Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.) would have an edge
because "a big advantage for a candidate is
having run for the presidency before."
"There is a veiy powerful tendency of the
American people to nominate people who have
held some state-wide office." Anderson said,
pointing to the successes of Reagan and former
President Jimmy Carter.
However, Anderson said, "The
economic state is the most accurate
predictor" of a presidential race.
"Whenever the changes in people's
real personal income went up by over
5 percent, the incumbent always
won," he said.
Although Anderson said, "It may
be impossible to predict who's going
to become the next president," he of
fered his predictions for both parties.
For the Democratic Party, Ander
son said, "Ted Kennedy is the most
natural candidate, but he's not run
ning. . . . There is a very good chance
Gary Hart could be the next nominee
from the Democratic Party." Mario

Cuomo, the governor of New York,
also has a chance of receiving the
nomination, according to Anderson.
For the Republicans, Vice Presi
dent George Bush is "clearly the
frontrunner," and Rep. Jack Kemp
(R-New York) is also a possibility,
Anderson said.
Commenting on the role that
image, personality and charisma play
in the election of the president, An
derson said, "I don't think it makes
any difference. The total dominating
factor is their positions on key
domestic issues."
When asked about the relationship
between politicians and their con
stituencies, Anderson said,
"Politicians are extremely sensitive to
their constituencies. They have to be,
or they won't be re-elected."
