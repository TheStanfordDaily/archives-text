While threatening skies and intermittent rainfall forced the cancellation of
yesterday's women's tennis match between top-ranked Stanford and San Jose
State, the Cardinal's Patty Fendick was basking in the sunshine of Boca Raton,
Fla.
Fendick, No. 4 in the collegiate rankings, knocked off professional Anne
White 7-5. 7-5 Tuesday in the first round of the Lipton International Players
Championship.
"I talked to her (Fendick) before the match, and I felt she would win." Stan
ford Coach Frank Brennan said. "Her opponent was beatable even though
she's a great player."
Fendick's teammates received an unexpected day off yesterday, courtesy of
the light rainfall. The match with SJSU has been rescheduled for Feb. 24 at
1:30 p.m.
In other first round action at the Lipton tournament Tuesday, former Card
inal Kate Gompert shocked No. 3 seed Pam Shriver 6-3. 3-6. 6-4.
After playing on the Cardinal's 1982 NCAA championship team. Gompert
turned professional. She played just one year on the pro circuit before deciding
to return to the Farm. The NCAA granted her one year of eligiblity. and Gom
pert used it to help Stanford win the national championship in 1954.
Back on the professional tour. Gompert has moved quickly up the rankings
into the top 20 in the world. Brennan indicated that her victory over Shriver
should move her further up in the rankings.
Another familiar face also won her first-round match Tuesday in Boca
Raton. Palo Alto's Anna Ivan defeated Joanne Russell 6-1. 2-6. 6-4.
Ivan played for Stanford as a freshman last year and was ranked as high as
sixth nationally. But after being suspended by Brennan for. among other
reasons, missing practices, she decided to quit playing for the Cardinal.
Ivan returned to Stanford this fall but has decided to take some time off
from school to compete professionally.
