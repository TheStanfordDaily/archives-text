ATLANTA (AP) — A federal court jury yesterday awarded $2.57
million in hack pay and damages to Jan Kemp, a former English instruc
tor at the University of Georgia who said she was fired for speaking out
against academic favoritism for student athletes.
The six-member U.S. District Court jury found that two Georgia offi
cials — Vice President for Academic Affairs Virginia Trotter and
Developmental Studies Director Leroy Ervin — violated Kemp's right
to free speech by demoting and firing her.
" This is primarily a victory for academic integrity," said Kemp, who
said the award went "beyond my wildest dreams."
According to testimony, the university's admission standards were
lowered for revenue-producing athletes, some athletes were promoted
from the remedial program even if they were not meeting grade require
ments, some were offered individual instruction, and some were given
more than the usual four quarters to get through the remedial program.
State Attorney General Michael Bowers said he had not decided
whether to appeal. The state has 30 days in which to file an appeal.
The award included $79,680 in back pay, $200,000 in compensation
for mental suffering, $ I million for damage to Kemp's reputation, $ 1.5
million in punitive damages against Trotter and $800,000 in punitive da
mages against Ervin.
