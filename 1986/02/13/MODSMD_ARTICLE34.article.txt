# Cardinal golfers mired in middle of the pack
## Men blown into 14th spot in Hawaii 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Winds of up to 50-miles-per-hour
wreaked havoc with the scores of the
first round of the John Burns Invita
tional men's golf tournament on the
island of Oahu, Hawaii.
When the dust settled, the top
ranked team in the nation was tied for
sixth, the tournament's first-place
team was only 22 shots ahead of the
22nd _ team, and a Cardinal
freshman playing in only his third col
legiate tournament led Stanford's in
dividuals by four shots.
Arizona shot 291 on the par-70
Ola Mana Golf Course to lead arch
rival Arizona State and Fresno State
by two strokes. Oklahoma followed
at 294 and San Jose State came in
fifth with a total of 295.
In sixth place was the nation's top
team, Oklahoma State, and the
West's top-ranked team, USC,
knotted at 297.
The 16th-ranked Cardinal is cur
rently in 14th place, with an easy
pathway either up or down the
leaderboard. Stanford trailed
Arizona by only 11 strokes, but led
22nd-place University of San Fran
cisco by only 10.
Stanford freshman Roger Miraglia
was atop the inverted Cardinal ledger
with a round of 72 which placed him
in the top 10 among individuals in the
invite. Another freshman. Brad Geer,
was second on the team at 76.
Don Walsworth and Rich Marik
followed with a pair of 775, and then
Carl Wagner, usually the top man on
the team, came in at 81.
"Our top three men (Walsworth,
Marik and Wagner) played very dis
appointingly for themselves and for
us," Stanford Coach Tim Schaaf said.
"We need them to do better the next

couple of days for us to make up
some ground.
"It's actually a fairly easy layout,"
Schaaf said of the course. "I
would have het the low score would
be a 65. (But) Rogers 72 was out
standing (for today)."
Schaaf would have lost some
money. Lamar's Phil Jones and
Texas-El Paso's Rick Todd lead the
tournament at 69. The quartet of
SJSU's Keir Smith, Arizona's Mike
Springer, ASU's Tom Stankowski

and UC-Santa Barbara's Brad Gal
lagher are nipping at their heels at 70.
Perhaps the top two players in the
nation, OSU's Scott Verplank and
USC's Sam Randolph, finished the
day out of the top 10. U.S. Amateur
Champions in 1984 and 1985,
respectively, the pair was tied at 73.
"It was kind of surprising," Schaaf
said about the day's events. "It's the
kind of course where you can make
up some ground, (but) it was anything
but easy."

Normally Stanford's top player, Carl Wagner had a rough day in the
50-mile-per-hour winds yesterday at the John Burns Invitational on
Oahu, shooting an 81 to finish last among Cardinal golfers.
