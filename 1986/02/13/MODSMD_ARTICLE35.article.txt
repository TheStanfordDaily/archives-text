# Women a disappointing 8th in Ariz.
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Despite playing its best round of
golf yesterday, all the Stanford
women's golf team could do was
break a tie with Lamar and finish all
alone in eighth place in the Arizona
Intercollegiate, which concluded at
the par-72 Randolph Golf Course in
Tucson.
The Cardinal shot 309 as a team
yesterday, a 12-stroke improvement
from Tuesday's round of 321, to
shake Lamar University, but it still
finished 51 swings behind tourna
ment winner Arizona State, 890-941.
The Sun Devils made it three-for
three in tournaments in 1986 as they
withstood a strong challenge from
USC, defeating the Trojans by five
shots. ASU shot only 26 over par for
the whole tournament. By contrast,
Stanford made 33 extra swings in the
second round alone.
"I thought both ASU and USC
played exceptional golf throughout
the tournament," Stanford Coach
Tim Baldwin said. "As a team, we
played poorly.
"However, that's not to discourage
us," he added. "We will come back
and work on our golf and work
towards the next tournament."
Arizona shot 299 yesterday to
finish at 907 and take third place,
while UCLA, in second place after
the first round, settled for fourth at
910.
Texas (924) and New Mexico
(927) finished fifth and sixth,
respectively, with U.S. International
taking seventh at 933. New Mexico
Stite rounded out the top 10 with a
total of 946.
Going into the Arizona tourney,
ASU's Danielle Ammaccapane and
Pam Wright had each won a tourna
ment this year. This week, the prize

went to Ammaccapane, who shot a
7 1 yesterday to defeat her teammate
by five strokes and end up two under
par for the tournament at 214.
Arizona's Kathryn Imrie shot 70 in
the third round to snag third place by
a shot from USIU's Laurette Maritz
and New Mexico's Caroline Keggi,
who both shot 221. Weber
State's Chris Newton then came in at
228, followed by USC's Florie Piono
at 229.
Stanford's Kay Cornelius climbed

hack into the top 10 with a score of
230. The rest of the Cardinal's
finishes were not so lofty, however.
Kathleen McCarthy, who opened the
tournament with an even-par 72.
ended lip tied with Julie Carmichael
at 237. Kathy Kostas' 245 and Trish
McGonigle's 246 completed Stan
ford's scoring.
Stanford, ranked third in the
NCAA, will try to improve next at
the Lady Spartan in Monterey Feb.
28-Mar. 2.
