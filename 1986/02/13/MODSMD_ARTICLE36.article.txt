Shcharansky to continue struggle
JERUSALEM — Released Soviet Jewish dissident Anatoly
Shcharansky spent his first day in Israel yesterday in virtual seclusion
with his wife, Avital, and close friends, discussing his future as a new im
migrant to the Jewish state, as special interest groups and political par
ties began jockeying to enlist his support.
Shcharansky, who was given an Israeli passport and immigrant card
upon his arrival last night, completed registration formalities and spent
much of the day resting from his whirlwind journey from an East Ger
man jail to freedom in West Berlin and, later, a tumultuous reception at
Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport.
The state-run Israeli radio reported last night that in a brief in
terview — the first he has given in nine years — Shcharansky said that
during his time in detention he knew nothing of world events. But he
said that from time to time he could guess at changes in Soviet policy by
the treatment accorded him by the KGB, the secret police.
In the interview, the radio reported, Shcharansky said he in
tended first to relax and then to devote his energies to working for the
release of other Soviet Jews.
The radio said that in the interview, Shcharansky, when asked if he
was instructed by the Soviets about what to say after his release, replied
that throughout his captivity he disobeyed the KGB's orders. He said
that when he was flown to East Germany, he was instructed to walk from
the aircraft in a straight line, but that in defiance he walked away in a
zig-zag course.
Mandela's wife sees hesitation
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa— As predictions swung first one
way then the other about whether South Africa is about to free im
prisoned black leader Nelson Mandela, his wife, Winnie, said yesterday
that she believes the government wants to release him but is hesitating,
fearing the impact that he would have on the black majority population.
She predicted his release would trigger a mass popular response
on the scale of Mohandas Gandhi's protest march to the sea or the
Ayatollah Khomeini's return to Tehran, which would swamp the streets
and "bring the country to a standstill," but that, in her view, the govern
ment needed to free him to reduce international pressure.
Recent comments by government leaders, however, have given the
impression that if Pretoria were to release Mandela, its chief purpose
would be to "demythologize" him.
According to one scenario, if Mandela is released, there would be a
brief and possibly dangerous period of mass excitement, but then the
messianic image and international reputation that he has acquired
through his long imprisonment would begin tofadejwhen it became evi
dent that he could not bring about any dramatic political transformation.
As one senior government legislator put it in a recent conversation,
"Then he will become just another black politician competing for sup
port."
Speaking in an interview, Winnie Mandela said she had no doubts
that the government had decided to release Mandela but she felt it
would be "a matter of months rather than weeks" before he is free.
Winnie Mandela also revealed that her husband would refuse to leave
South Africa as part of a prisoner exchange, which the government is
known to be eager to negotiate, and that if released inside the country he
would resume the leadership of the outlawed African National
Congress, ignoring legal restrictions on it and confronting the govern
ment with the problem of whether to rearrest him.
Top Duvalier aides reportedly here
WASHINGTON — At least three top associates of deposed Haitian
dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier have quietly entered the United States
and are living in anonymous splendor in posh hotels and hideaways,
Haitian activists and other experts said yesterday.
The three, including Duvalier's father-in-law and his former interior
and foreign ministers, arrived here shortly before the man known as
"Baby Doc" flew into exile in France last Friday aboard a U.S. Air
Force cargo plane.
Word of their presence has outraged some Haitian leaders in the
United States, who say U.S. tolerance implies continued support for
Duvalier and his allies, some of whom hold key posts in Haiti's
provisional government.
State Department spokesman Jim Callahan said the department was
unaware that Duvalier's associates were in the United States but added
that it was unlikely they would have been denied entry anyway. U.S. of
ficials in Port-au-Prince and Washington said the three Haitians ap
parently held valid visas that gave them the right to enter the United
States at will.
Libya increases military activity
WASHINGTON'— U.S. Navy jets flying north of the Gulf of Sidra
encountered Libyan aircraft more than a dozen times yesterday as
Libyan forces stepped up their aerial activity while the Navy conducted
maneuvers in the central Mediterranean Sea, Pentagon officials said.
The officials said Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy sent more planes
into the air to meet the F-14s and F-A-18s yesterday than at any point
during another U.S. exercise two weeks ago.
Pentagon officials said the Navy pilots reported no indications of hos
tile action by the Libyans, who turned back toward shore before the in
tercepts became anything more than routine. Electronic equipment in
the U.S. planes can determine whether an approaching aircraft has
aimed its missiles, a step that would be considered hostile.
Two killed in East Beirut blast
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Two women were killed and 16 persons
injured yesterday morning when a bomb exploded near one of President
Amin Gemayel's Phalangist Party offices in mostly Christian East
Beirut, police said.
The bomb was planted outisde a seven-story building in Ain Rem
maneh. close to the Phalangist Party office. The building itself houses a
Phalangist first-aid center on the second floor. Patients and employees at
the first-aid center were reportedly all safe.
The blast occured at 10:05 a.m., according to The Voice of Lebanon,
a Christian radio station, and was the fifth aimed at Phalangist Party
offices since Jan. 14, when Gemeyal refused to endorse the Syrian
sponsored Damascus Agreement signed by Lebanon's three main
militias.
The explosion damaged several floor shops and a movie theater lo
cated in the basement of the targeted building, according to radio
reports.
The Lebanese Forces, a Christian militia, have accused their former
commander, Elie Hobeika, of masterminding the attacks. Hobeika, 29,
was toppled on Jan. 15 by his own chief of staff, Samir Geagia, and the
Phalangist Party militia after he signed a Syrian-forged agreement with
Lebanon's major Moslem factions for new power-sharing in the country.
Iraq shells 'liberated' port ,
TEHRAN, Iran — Iran said yesterday that Iraqi air force planes and
artillery have begun fierce shelling of the "liberated" Iraqi port of Al
Faw.
Iraq, conceding that Iranian invasion forces have crossed the strategic
Shatt al-Arab waterway, vowed massive retaliation inside Iran.
Iran reported that it had shot down a total of 18 Iraqi warplanes since
its forces occupied Al Faw Tuesday on the second day of its invasion of
oil-rich southern Iran. It said its forces were trying to minimize damage
to Al Faw's oil installations "to preserve these for the Iraqi people."

BEIRUT, Lebanon — Two women were killed and 16 persons
injured yesterday morning when a bomb exploded near one of President
Amin Gemayel's Phalangist Party offices in mostly Christian East
Beirut, police said.
The bomb was planted outisde a seven-story building in Ain Rem
maneh. close to the Phalangist Party office. The building itself houses a
Phalangist first-aid center on the second floor. Patients and employees at
the first-aid center were reportedly all safe.
The blast occured at 10:05 a.m., according to The Voice of Lebanon,
a Christian radio station, and was the fifth aimed at Phalangist Party
offices since Jan. 14, when Gemeyal refused to endorse the Syrian
sponsored Damascus Agreement signed by Lebanon's three main
militias.
The explosion damaged several floor shops and a movie theater lo
cated in the basement of the targeted building, according to radio
reports.
The Lebanese Forces, a Christian militia, have accused their former
commander, Elie Hobeika, of masterminding the attacks. Hobeika, 29,
was toppled on Jan. 15 by his own chief of staff, Samir Geagia, and the
Phalangist Party militia after he signed a Syrian-forged agreement with
Lebanon's major Moslem factions for new power-sharing in the country.
Iraq shells 'liberated' port ,
TEHRAN, Iran — Iran said yesterday that Iraqi air force planes and
artillery have begun fierce shelling of the "liberated" Iraqi port of Al
Faw.
Iraq, conceding that Iranian invasion forces have crossed the strategic
Shatt al-Arab waterway, vowed massive retaliation inside Iran.
Iran reported that it had shot down a total of 18 Iraqi warplanes since
its forces occupied Al Faw Tuesday on the second day of its invasion of
oil-rich southern Iran. It said its forces were trying to minimize damage
to Al Faw's oil installations "to preserve these for the Iraqi people."
Shcharansky to continue struggle
JERUSALEM — Released Soviet Jewish dissident Anatoly
Shcharansky spent his first day in Israel yesterday in virtual seclusion
with his wife, Avital, and close friends, discussing his future as a new im
migrant to the Jewish state, as special interest groups and political par
ties began jockeying to enlist his support.
Shcharansky, who was given an Israeli passport and immigrant card
upon his arrival last night, completed registration formalities and spent
much of the day resting from his whirlwind journey from an East Ger
man jail to freedom in West Berlin and, later, a tumultuous reception at
Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport.
The state-run Israeli radio reported last night that in a brief in
terview — the first he has given in nine years — Shcharansky said that
during his time in detention he knew nothing of world events. But he
said that from time to time he could guess at changes in Soviet policy by
the treatment accorded him by the KGB, the secret police.
In the interview, the radio reported, Shcharansky said he in
tended first to relax and then to devote his energies to working for the
release of other Soviet Jews.
The radio said that in the interview, Shcharansky, when asked if he
was instructed by the Soviets about what to say after his release, replied
that throughout his captivity he disobeyed the KGB's orders. He said
that when he was flown to East Germany, he was instructed to walk from
the aircraft in a straight line, but that in defiance he walked away in a
zig-zag course.
Mandela's wife sees hesitation
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa— As predictions swung first one
way then the other about whether South Africa is about to free im
prisoned black leader Nelson Mandela, his wife, Winnie, said yesterday
that she believes the government wants to release him but is hesitating,
fearing the impact that he would have on the black majority population.
She predicted his release would trigger a mass popular response
on the scale of Mohandas Gandhi's protest march to the sea or the
Ayatollah Khomeini's return to Tehran, which would swamp the streets
and "bring the country to a standstill," but that, in her view, the govern
ment needed to free him to reduce international pressure.
Recent comments by government leaders, however, have given the
impression that if Pretoria were to release Mandela, its chief purpose
would be to "demythologize" him.
According to one scenario, if Mandela is released, there would be a
brief and possibly dangerous period of mass excitement, but then the
messianic image and international reputation that he has acquired
through his long imprisonment would begin tofadejwhen it became evi
dent that he could not bring about any dramatic political transformation.
As one senior government legislator put it in a recent conversation,
"Then he will become just another black politician competing for sup
port."
Speaking in an interview, Winnie Mandela said she had no doubts
that the government had decided to release Mandela but she felt it
would be "a matter of months rather than weeks" before he is free.
Winnie Mandela also revealed that her husband would refuse to leave
South Africa as part of a prisoner exchange, which the government is
known to be eager to negotiate, and that if released inside the country he
would resume the leadership of the outlawed African National
Congress, ignoring legal restrictions on it and confronting the govern
ment with the problem of whether to rearrest him.
Top Duvalier aides reportedly here
WASHINGTON — At least three top associates of deposed Haitian
dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier have quietly entered the United States
and are living in anonymous splendor in posh hotels and hideaways,
Haitian activists and other experts said yesterday.
The three, including Duvalier's father-in-law and his former interior
and foreign ministers, arrived here shortly before the man known as
"Baby Doc" flew into exile in France last Friday aboard a U.S. Air
Force cargo plane.
Word of their presence has outraged some Haitian leaders in the
United States, who say U.S. tolerance implies continued support for
Duvalier and his allies, some of whom hold key posts in Haiti's
provisional government.
State Department spokesman Jim Callahan said the department was
unaware that Duvalier's associates were in the United States but added
that it was unlikely they would have been denied entry anyway. U.S. of
ficials in Port-au-Prince and Washington said the three Haitians ap
parently held valid visas that gave them the right to enter the United
States at will.
Libya increases military activity
WASHINGTON'— U.S. Navy jets flying north of the Gulf of Sidra
encountered Libyan aircraft more than a dozen times yesterday as
Libyan forces stepped up their aerial activity while the Navy conducted
maneuvers in the central Mediterranean Sea, Pentagon officials said.
The officials said Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy sent more planes
into the air to meet the F-14s and F-A-18s yesterday than at any point
during another U.S. exercise two weeks ago.
Pentagon officials said the Navy pilots reported no indications of hos
tile action by the Libyans, who turned back toward shore before the in
tercepts became anything more than routine. Electronic equipment in
the U.S. planes can determine whether an approaching aircraft has
aimed its missiles, a step that would be considered hostile.
