# Panel questions safety of new boosters
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The National Aeronautics
and Space Administration's (NASA) aerospace
safety advisory panel yesterday warned of potential
safety problems with a new solid rocket booster
being developed for Air Force space shuttle
launches.
Specifically, the panel said there is uncertainty
about the structural strength of the new rocket
casing, and until the question is settled "with a high
degree of confidence," the booster should not be
used in launching the shuttle, especially from Van
denberg Air Force Base in California.
The new light-weight filament-wound rocket is
still officially scheduled to be used for the first time
in mid-July on the first shuttle launching from the
new Vandenberg launch complex. That schedule
has been made highly uncertain by the Jan. 28
Challenger shuttle disaster, but the U.S. Air Force
is still pressing ahead with preparations to assemble
the solid boosters.
One more test of a solid booster motor like the
one to be flown on the first Vandenberg launching
had been scheduled for today, but was postponed
after the Challenger disaster.

Use of the new booster is crucial to Air Force
plans for the space shuttle because of its require
ment to carry heavy payloads into polar orbit. By
switching from steel canister to the filament casing,
shuttles flying out of Vandenberg will be able to
load an additional 4,600 pounds into their cargo
bays.
A Vandenberg spokesman said yesterday that he
was unable to comment on the report of the NASA
safety panel because officials at the base had not
seen the document.
The caution was raised about the new booster
just a few hours after NASA made public internal
documents showing that it had been concerned for
years about the safety of the intricate components
in the seal between segments of the shuttle's solid
boosters.
In December 1982, NASA officials put synthetic
rubber seals called O-rings in the most sensitive
category of the space shuttle's long "critical items
list," saying that their failure could cause "loss of
mission, vehicle and crew due to metal erosion,
burn-through and probably case-burst resulting in
fire and deflagration."

The heightened concern arose, NASA officials
said yesterday, when it was learned that one of the
two O-rings sealing the seam between booster seg
ments could become unseated in the fraction of a
second as the huge booster ignites and builds to a
thrust of 3.3 million pounds. During that 600 one
thousandths of a second, a "joint rotation phe
nomenon can unseat the secondary O-ring, leaving
the primary ring in the assembly as a "single failure
point." That means that only one quarter-inch ring
would for that split second prevent flame from
reaching the structure of the rocket case.
Still, space agency officials said they believed it
safe to launch the rockets under such conditions
because they had subjected the rings to tests at
pressures more than double those expected during
the 2.09 minutes that the two solid boosters burn
during the shuttle's ascent to orbit.
For the last week, the solid booster has been the
most investigated and discussed of the potential
sources of the Challenger tragedy, but officials re
emphasized yesterday that they had not begun to
zero in on a probable cause of the accident.
