# Aquino urges U.S. not to back Marcos

MANILA, Philippines — Opposi
tion presidential candidate Corazon
Aquino said yesterday that a special
envoy that President Reagan is send
ing to the Philippines would be
welcome, but suggested that U.S.
policy could be helping push the
country toward catastrophe.
In a written statement, Aquino
urged Reagan not to "conspire" with
President Ferdinand Marcos "to
cheat the Filipino people of their
liberation."
Aquino, who has claimed victory
over Marcos in Friday's election, said
she could never be reconciled with
him, as officials in Washington have
suggested be tried. "Too many
people will be dead the moment the
world's head is turned," she said.

Her words matched equally strong
sentiments among many of her fol
lowers. They charged that the United
States is betraying a commitment to
foster democracy in the Philippines
and is tilting toward accepting a
fraudulent Marcos victory as the
counting of votes from the election
continues.
The statement came as the opposi
tion appeared to be losing hope that
Aquino can beat Marcos within the
system. Many members of her camp
have complained that the U.S. stand
is increasing Marcos' freedom to ma
nipulate the vote. Marcos has denied
doing so.
The Philippines parliament,
dominated by his New Society Move

ment party, yesterday continued
the tedious process of opening boxes
containing voting returns and is
widely expected to proclaim Marcos
the winner, perhaps later this week.
Aquino said Reagan's envoy. Am
bassador Philip Habib, would "no
doubt" be welcomed. "I must confess
to some alarm, however, that his last
task for the president was trying to
negotiate an end to Lebanon's civil
war," she said. "I hope neither Mr.
Reagan nor Mr. Marcos is expecting
to see our beloved country go the
same way."
A spokesman for Marcos, mean
while, said the president would
welcome Habib's trip as a chance to
increase U.S. understanding of the
situation here.

U.S. Ambassador Stephen Bos
worth called at Aquino campaign
headquarters Tuesday and again yes
terday, but there was no word on the
substance of his talks.
Aquino said yesterday that a fair
count would show she took between
80 percent and 90 percent of Friday's
vote. But she said her lead was
whittled down by such things as
fraud, intimidation and deliberate
delays of the voting process.
A tally by the government's Com
mission on Elections showed Marcos
in the lead, 6.4 million to 5.9 million.
A separate partial count by the
citizens' group known as Namfrel
showed her leading Marcos, 7.2 mil
lion to 6.5 million, last night.
