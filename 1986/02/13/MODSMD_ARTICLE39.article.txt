Japan extends car limits
WASHINGTON — Japan will extend its vol
untary restrictions on automobile shipments to
the United States for a sixth year in an effort to
dampen trade frictions arising from its $49.7 bil
lion trade surplus with the United States, Admin
istration, congressional and industry sources said
yesterday.
The Reagan Administration and key congres
sional leaders were told by the Japanese yester
day in advance of the announcement in Tokyo
today by Minister of International Trade and In
dustries Michio Watanabe. U.S. officials said the
restraints will remain at their present levels of 2.3
million cars until March 31, 1987.
The Japanese decision comes as the govern
ment of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
seeks to smooth strains in its relations with the
United States, its major political ally and largest
trading partner, to avoid embarrassment during a
planned visit here by Nakasone within the month
and the economic summit scheduled for Tokyo in
May.
It was unclear yesterday night how the Admin
istration will react to the Japanese decision to
continue restraints on auto sales, which runs
against the ideological free-trade orientation of
President Reagan.
But the White House reportedly is concerned
that lifting the restraints would add to protec
tionist pressures in Congress, where Democrats
and Republican lawmakers have grown increas
ingly vocal over job losses and factory closings
because of the United States' record trade deficit
of $148.5 billion in 1985. Lifting the restraints
could add at least $4.5 billion to that deficit.
Defense budget may fall
WASHINGTON — Congress will probably
limit next year's increase in the defense budget to

little more than the inflation rate, a top White
House aide now acknowledges, despite President
Reagan's request for a boost in the Pentagon's
budget of nearly 12 percent.
"I think we'll be very fortunate to see an in
crease ... a real increase" above inflation,
Mitchell Daniels Jr., Reagan's top assistant for
political and governmental affairs, told reporters
yesterday.
"Speaking only for myself," Daniels admitted
that the White House is quite likely to fall far
short of its proposed $320.3 billion defense
spending blueprint and conceded that the
Reagan Administration should expect at best to
win slightly more than 300 billion in fiscal 1987,
which begins Oct. 1.
Instead of talking much about spending
priorities, the White House budget strategy this
year will be to focus its efforts on resisting con
gressional pressure for a tax increase, Daniels
said in two separate sessions with reporters. He
suggested that the White House expects to put
the Democrats on the political defensive during
this year's congressional elections by accusing
them of ultimately intending to boost taxes on
American families.
"The opportunity this year is to remind people
what the other side is saying," Daniels said. A tax
increase, he added, is "the issue of the year.
That's the one we want to keep the focus on."
Secretary fires lacocca
WASHINGTON — Interior Secretary Donald
Hodel fired Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee
lacocca as head of an advisory commission on the
restoration of the Statue of Liberty yesterday,
saying the Administration "would not be
bullied" into keeping him.
Hodel said the firing was necessary because of
the potential for conflict between the Statue of
Liberty-Ellis Island Centennial Commission, a

presidentially appointed panel, and the private
fund-raising foundation that lacocca has headed
for more than three years.
lacocca remains head of the private founda
tion, set up to raise money to restore the
deteriorating American landmarks. The commis
sion essentially recommends how the money
raised by the foundation should be spent.
The announcement drew a quick and forceful
response from lacocca, who has been asked twice
in the last week to relinquish the post and has
twice refused.
"The secretary's statement was off the wall and
in clear contradiction of the facts," lacocca said.
"1 resent any inference on his part of conflict of
interest.
"The truth is that the secretary is in conflict
with his own charter. This is a grab for four years'
worth of contributions by the American people."
Hodel said he had told lacocca of the decision
to fire him Monday, but that lacocca apparently
believed the matter was still under discussion.
Since then, according to Interior Department of
ficials, spokesmen for the Chrysler chairman
have blitzed the department and the White
House with calls insisting that he be retained.
Oil drops, stocks surge
NEW YORK — Refreshed by a one-day
pause, the stock market turned upward on yes
terday, returning to record altitudes on one mar
ket indicator in an advance supported by falling
interest rates and oil prices.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose
7.11 to 1,629.93, breaking the record close of
1,626.38 set on Monday and erasing a slight
decline from the previous session.
Oil prices continued to drop on yesterday, a
factor many investors believe lessens the chances
for high inflation, and helped sustain a mild bond
market rally which pushed long-term interest
rates lower.
