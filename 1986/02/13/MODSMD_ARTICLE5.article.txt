# Stanford could lose $13 million
## Cuts in research-related overhead 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
The University could lose $5-13
million as a result of changes in
federal reimbursement for research
costs that were proposed yesterday in
the Federal Register, a government
publication.
The changes, authored by the
White House's Office of Manage
ment and Budget (OMB), would limit
the amount of administrative over
head costs that universities could
charge to the federal government.
The new rules would apply to all
federally sponsored research grants
and are scheduled to take effect in
two stages. The first stage would
become effective on April 1. A 30-
day period for comment began yes
terday.
Last year, the federal government
reimbursed Stanford for about $60
million in overhead costs. That
process, known in accounting terms
as indirect cost recovery, was one of

the University's largest sources of un
restricted funds, second only to tui
tion and fees.
The money goes into Stanford's
operating budget, which provides the
funds that enable the University to
buy library books and pay provosts —
in short, to function as a university.
In a letter to members of the Board
of Trustees two weeks ago, Stanford
President Donald Kennedy estimated
that the University could lose $5-13
million with a change similar to the
one announced today.
OMB estimates that its proposal
would save the U.S. government
$100 million in fiscal year 1987 and
more than $200 million in fiscal year
1988, making it "consistent with the
president's fiscal year 1987 budget
and the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
'Balanced Budget and Emergency
Deficit Control Act of 1985.' "
In fiscal year 1984, federal pay
ments to universities for overhead
costs were about $1.7 billion, or
about 46 percent of the $3.7 billion
spent by the government on scientific
research, according to the OMB entry
in the Federal Register. Stanford is
the third-largest recipient of that
money.
Carol Scheman of the Washington
based American Association of Uni
versities (AAU) said the Reagan Ad
ministration is "structurally under
funding research. They are trying to
get the same amount of research for a
smaller amount of money." Among
the members of the AAU, the na
tion's oldest academic association,
are Kennedy and the presidents of 53
other public and private research uni
versities.

This "underfunding" will lead to a
reduction in both the quantity and
quality of research done in the United
States, Scheman said. When doing
biomedical research, for instance, re
searchers could perform experiments
using older, less advanced equipment
if they spent more time.
However, this lack of equipment
would be a waste of time and, multi
plied on a national scale, would affect
the quality, scope and pace of re
search conducted in the United
States, she said. "This nation can
trace a lot of its competitiveness in in
ternational markets to advancements
in research" made at universities,
Scheman said.
The rise in indirect costs in recent
years has attracted the attention of
federal agencies and Congress, and
changes to save money have been un
der discussion for several years.

The OMB rule, however, disturbs
many in the research community be
cause it was not formulated in
cooperation with universities.
Scheman said the AAU and
other representatives ot' the research
community have been attempting to
talk to the OMB for months without
success.
The OMB action adds another item
to Stanford's list of Washington
worries — all of which could have
serious consequences.
Larry Horton, associate vice
president for Public Affairs, said that
because of the Gramm-Rudman law
and President Reagan's 1987 budget,
the University could face a net
decline of 27 percent in federal stu
dent aid by the end of this year. Stan
ford will continue to provide all stu
dents with full financial aid, he said,
but that means higher expenditures.
