# Stanford could lose $13 million
## Cuts in research-related overhead 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
The University could lose $5-13
million as a result of changes in
federal reimbursement for research
costs that were proposed yesterday in
the Federal Register, a government
publication.
The changes, authored by the
White House's Office of Manage
ment and Budget (OMB), would limit
the amount of administrative over
head costs that universities could
charge to the federal government.
The new rules would apply to all
federally sponsored research grants
and are scheduled to take effect in
two stages. The first stage would
become effective on April 1. A 30-
day period for comment began yes
terday.
Last year, the federal government
reimbursed Stanford for about $60
million in overhead costs. That
process, known in accounting terms
as indirect cost recovery, was one of

the University's largest sources of un
restricted funds, second only to tui
tion and fees.
The money goes into Stanford's
operating budget, which provides the
funds that enable the University to
buy library books and pay provosts â€”
in short, to function as a university.
In a letter to members of the Board
of Trustees two weeks ago, Stanford
President Donald Kennedy estimated
that the University could lose $5-13
million with a change similar to the
one announced today.
OMB estimates that its proposal
would save the U.S. government
$100 million in fiscal year 1987 and
more than $200 million in fiscal year
1988, making it "consistent with the
president's fiscal year 1987 budget
and the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
'Balanced Budget and Emergency
Deficit Control Act of 1985.' "
In fiscal year 1984, federal pay
ments to universities for overhead
