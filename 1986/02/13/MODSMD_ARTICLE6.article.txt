### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Expelled in 1983 by the Anthro
pology Department for "unethical
behavior" while conducting research
in China, former Stanford graduate
student Steven Mosher will seek
reinstatement by filing a lawsuit this
month against the University.
Mosher additionally has circulated
a letter to members of Stanford's
Academic Council asking for help "in
correcting a wrong done to me by
members of the Anthropology De
partment and the Stanford admini
stration" and soliticing support for a
Steven Mosher Defense Committee.
Mosher said yesterday he felt
the lawsuit would culminate in his
being permitted to complete his doc
toral studies at Stanford.
"I'm going to continue fighting to
get my Ph.D.," Mosher said.
"Eventually the University will come

around and give it to me."
Mosher, whose appeal for
reinstatement was denied last Octo
ber by University President Donald
Kennedy, has claimed that he is being
punished for embarrassing the
Chinese government by revealing its
controversial population control pro
gram. The data Mosher collected
while doing research in China in 1979
and 1980 included photographs of
women in the eighth month of preg
nancy undergoing forced abortions.
The University maintains that
Mosher was expelled for "illegal and
unethical conduct" while in China.
Among other charges, Mosher has
been accused of falsifying a sales
receipt for a University-owned
camera used in his research and then
lying to Kennedy about it.
