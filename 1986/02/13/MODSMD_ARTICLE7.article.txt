# Extraterrestrial phones overtake Stanford
## 
### LISA HERSCHBACH 
So, you think an "E.T. phone" is a machine
used by extraterrestrials to call home? That may
be so, but they have landed at Stanford as part
of the new SL-100 electronic telephone (E.T.)
system that the University is installing.

Feature

The University was virtually forced into the
$20 million project, according to Maureen
Trimm, operations service manager for Com
munication Services. The project requires
rewiring the entire campus with a new conduit
system and furnishing every campus office with

the new, high-tech electronic telephones,
Trimm said.
As of Jan. 1, the old Centrex phones lost all
support from Western Electric â€” which Trimm
said was not surprising "since the Centrex
switch is 1950's technology." Parts to repair the
old system are no longer available and tech
nicians are no longer trained to fix the phones.
Furthermore, the old telephone lines have a
capacity limited to 8,900 phones and the Uni
versity has run out of telephone numbers, she
added.
The new telephones began appearing in
campus offices in late November, and the old
phones are scheduled to disappear in mid-
March. Office desks currently have the squat

black rotary phones, straight out of late-night
"Leave it to Beaver" reruns, sitting side-by
side with the new tan boxes with flashing dia
mond lights, which would be at home on a "Star
Trek" set.
Florence Moore Hall office assistant Laurie
Silver said "things can get kind of hectic
with both phones ringing' at once.
Because learning to use the new phones is an
extensive process, the Stanford community is
being weaned slowly from their ancient system.
The menu of features available on the new
phones is as long as a Western Culture reading
list. It includes "call transfer," "consultation
hold," "speed call," "call forward" and "three
party conference," among other things. In addi

tion, a long code number and a special tone are
required to use one of these features.
Two new prefixes, 723 and 725, will replace
the old 497 prefix. This doubles the capacity of
the system, but also means office staff must look
up new numbers to use the phones. Trimm said
the new numbers will not be available to stu
dents until spring quarter when a new directory
will be published and sold in the Bookstore.
To gain familiarity with the telephones, users
are advised to attend one of the hour-and-a-half
training sessions given by instructors from
Northern Telecom, the company supplying the
system. The session begins with a slide
