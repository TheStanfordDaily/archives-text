# Extraterrestrial phones overtake Stanford
## 
### LISA HERSCHBACH 
So, you think an "E.T. phone" is a machine
used by extraterrestrials to call home? That may
be so, but they have landed at Stanford as part
of the new SL-100 electronic telephone (E.T.)
system that the University is installing.

Feature

The University was virtually forced into the
$20 million project, according to Maureen
Trimm, operations service manager for Com
munication Services. The project requires
rewiring the entire campus with a new conduit
system and furnishing every campus office with

the new, high-tech electronic telephones,
Trimm said.
As of Jan. 1, the old Centrex phones lost all
support from Western Electric — which Trimm
said was not surprising "since the Centrex
switch is 1950's technology." Parts to repair the
old system are no longer available and tech
nicians are no longer trained to fix the phones.
Furthermore, the old telephone lines have a
capacity limited to 8,900 phones and the Uni
versity has run out of telephone numbers, she
added.
The new telephones began appearing in
campus offices in late November, and the old
phones are scheduled to disappear in mid-
March. Office desks currently have the squat

black rotary phones, straight out of late-night
"Leave it to Beaver" reruns, sitting side-by
side with the new tan boxes with flashing dia
mond lights, which would be at home on a "Star
Trek" set.
Florence Moore Hall office assistant Laurie
Silver said "things can get kind of hectic
with both phones ringing' at once.
Because learning to use the new phones is an
extensive process, the Stanford community is
being weaned slowly from their ancient system.
The menu of features available on the new
phones is as long as a Western Culture reading
list. It includes "call transfer," "consultation
hold," "speed call," "call forward" and "three
party conference," among other things. In addi

tion, a long code number and a special tone are
required to use one of these features.
Two new prefixes, 723 and 725, will replace
the old 497 prefix. This doubles the capacity of
the system, but also means office staff must look
up new numbers to use the phones. Trimm said
the new numbers will not be available to stu
dents until spring quarter when a new directory
will be published and sold in the Bookstore.
To gain familiarity with the telephones, users
are advised to attend one of the hour-and-a-half
training sessions given by instructors from
Northern Telecom, the company supplying the
system. The session begins with a slide

presentation showing the first tele
phone system ever installed at Stan
ford. followed by numerous shots of
people using their electronic
telephones and smiling.
Larry Dahl, who works in the
stacks of Green Library and also at
tended the training session, said he
found the "hype and propaganda ob
noxious."
The time remaining in the training
session is then spent getting "hands
on experience" with the phones.
Stanford staff said they found this
part of the session to be much more
helpful than the opening slide show.
In offices around campus, each
desk phone comes equipped with a
"quick reference" instruction card
and pamphlet. And in each depart
ment, a member of the office is ap
pointed Stanford
Telecommunications Activity Repre
sentative (S.T. A.R.) and is equipped
with an especially large library of in
struction material. As a last resort,
Stanford's Communication Services
has special telephone lines, 5-HELP
and 5-INFO, to provide phone aid.
Does all this sound absurdly com
plicated? Most phone users agree that
the complexity of the new system has
made the transition period difficult.
But they have faith that the system,
when familiar and debugged of its
numerous quirks, will be an improve
ment over the old one.
Annie Perkins, office assistant in
the Overseas Studies Department,

said "touchtone is a great addition,"
and likes the direct-dialing feature
which eliminates the 20- to 30-ring
wait for operator-assisted calls.
However, she has a rather large prob
lem now because the international
lines have not been hooked up — a
definite dilemma in the Overseas
Studies office.

The menu of
features available
on the new
phones is as long
as a Western Cul
ture reading list.

Perkins was also dismayed when
the phones were first hooked up, and
the lines for her office were crossed
with those of Stanford News and
Publications. She has kept her sense
of humor, however, and said, "I con
sider myself a pretty smart person
with machines, and I can't figure this

one out. I've lost a number of calls
.. . but I'm sure things will get better,
and it will be an improvement when
it's all set up."
Juanita Nissley, secretary for the
Undergraduate Advising Center, ex
pressed similar sentiments, saying,
"Everyone I've talked to is having
problems, but I'm not upset because
it will take a few months to iron out
the bugs."
Crossed wires, and consequently,
wrong numbers, have also been a
problem for the people in Nissley's
office, but she said "everybody is
working together and things will be
OK. We have a small office, though.
I'm worried about what must be
going on in the large offices."
Eva Motiska is an administrator in
the Economics Department, one of
the larger departments on campus.
Motiska said the discomfort caused
by new phones has kept the staff from
using them.
"The features are unreliable,
working one day and nofthe next,"
Motiska said. In addition, there have
been problems making long distance
calls.
The time needed to look up a new
number, combined with discomfort in
using an unfamiliar machine that of
ten does not work, has meant that
campus offices, in general, continue
to use their old phones for 80 percent
of their calls, Perkins said.
In many cases, offices set up the
new systems to work like the old, not
realizing the potential and abilities of
the new system.
