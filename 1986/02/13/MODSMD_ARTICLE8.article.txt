### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
The Dartmouth College disciplinary commit
tee Tuesday suspended 12 students responsible
for destroying a Dartmouth College shantytown
erected by students to call attention to the
miserable living conditions in South Africa.
Lawyers for some of the suspended students
said, however, that if College President David
McLaughlin did not reverse the suspensions,
they would take the case to court, according to
an article yesterday in The New York Times.
The suspended students plan to appeal the

decision to McLaughlin and expect the issue to
he "resolved in [their] favor," according to
suspended sophomore Werner Meyer.
Just after the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday
last month, the 12 students drove a rented flat
bed truck onto the college green and began dis
mantling the shantytown with sledgehammers.
The town had been built in November by a
group of students advocating divestment of the
college's funds from companies that do business
in South Africa.
A similar shantytown erected last month in
Stanford's White Plaza was razed Sat
urday night, but police are doubtful
about the possibiltiy of apprehending
those responsible.
Meyer offered his
congratulations" to whoever was re
sponsible for the shanty destruction
here.
In response to the Dartmouth inci
dent, members of the Dartmouth
Community for Divestment held a
sit-in in the president's office and re
quested that classes be cancelled for a
day in order to hold a forum on rac
ism, sexism and dissent at the college,
according to The New York Times.
The students decided to tear down

the shanty not because they were
opposed to the anti-apartheid move
ment, but because they felt the shanty
had served its educational function,
according to Meyer.
"We found that the shanties were
stifling debate. .. . They were
counter-productive. . . . [The
destruction] was not politically or ra
cially motivated at all," Meyer said.
The group of students who tore
down the shanty "made no effort to
resist (police) whatsoever. ... When
police came, we informed them of
what we were doing," Meyer said.
A contributing editor for The
Dartmouth Review, Meyer was one
of 10 suspended students who work
for the right-wing campus newspaper,
which is funded by alumni.
