# Drell renews call to release Sakharov
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
The director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)
has called on the Soviet Union to
restore citizenship priviliges to So
viet physicist Andrei Sakharov and
at least to allow he and his wife to
move to Moscow, if not emigrate to
the West.
"Why does the Soviet Union so
cruelly and mercilessly seek to
destroy this scientific giant of whom
they should be so proud as a na
tional treasure, one of the greatest
leaders of their strong scientific
tradition? Do they really feel so
weak as to fear his lone voice?"
Sidney Drell asked Monday at a
New York dinner honoring Sak
harov's wife, Yelena Bonner, who
is in the United States for treatment
of a heart condition.
The winner of the 1975 Nobel
Peace Prize for his opposition to
nuclear weapons, Sakharov was re
sponsible for important
breakthroughs in nuclear fusion

which led to the development of the
first Soviet hydrogen bomb in
1949. Now a vocal opponent of nu
clear weapons, he is rumored to be
under house arrest in the Soviet city
of Gorky.
Sakharov has "the courageous
voice of the conscience of
mankind" and has made "seminal
contributions of crucial importance
to our quest to understand the
evolution of the universe," said
Drell, co-director of the Stanford
Center for International Security
and Arms Control and president of
the American Physical Society in
addition to his post at SLAC.
The Soviet government's argu
ment that Sakharov knows too
many classified secrets to be
allowed to emigrate is no longer
valid, according to Drell.
"Sakharov has not been in contact
with Soviet work on nuclear weap
ons or military systems for 20
years," he said.
"Given such a long lapse of time,
I know of no secrets that he could
bring, even if he were inclined to —

which I very much doubt — that
could in the least compromise So
viet security. But 1 will respond to
Mr. Gorbachev by saying that: If
you refuse to let us welcome the
Sakharovs here in the West with
open arms and hearts — as many of
my collegues and 1, as well as our
universities, are prepared to do —
at least, Mr. General Secretary,
permit Andrei and Yelena to return
to Moscow and restore their
priviliges as Soviet citizens, able to
work and speak out for peace and
contribute to the world of physics,"
Drell said.
