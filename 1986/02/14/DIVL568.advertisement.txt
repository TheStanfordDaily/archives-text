addition to paying for your tuition, required books and fees.
It's all part of the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship Program.
And here is how it works!
If you're selected fora Physician's Scholarship—from the Army, Navy, or Air
Force—you're commissioned as an officer in the Reserves.
While you're in school, you'll serve 45 days a year on active duty, gaining
valuable medical experience. After graduation, you will serve three or more
years, the length depending on the requirements of the Service selected and
years of scholarship assistance received.
As an Armed Forces physician you'll receive officer's pay and benefits, and
enjoy the advantages of working regular hours. You'll also see a diversity of
patients and have opportunities to use sophisticated medical technology.
But most important, while you're in medical school we'll help pay the bills.
