THAT MOVES THE
INDUSTRY AHEAD
As Bill Gates (creator of BASIC
at age 19), now the Chariman of
Microsoft puts it, "There is no
other industry where you can come
up with an idea and a year later you
have 100,000 people sitting happily
using it to get their work done. I'm
having a very good time."
We're looking for Software
Design Engineers who share this
perspective — who have the drive,
the insight, the creativity to shape
the software that will move the
microcomputer industry ahead. And
who enjoy doing it, like Bill does.
You'll work with hardware so
new it hasn't been publicly intro
duced. Work closely with the most
outstanding minds in the business.
Enjoy the freedom of your own
office in our flexible environment.
And relish the challenge of building
your perspective into the most
exciting projects around.

The challenge at the heart of great
computer programming is this: to
make the machine do something it
has never done before. The influ
ence of that effort on the way peo
ple use computers extends deep into
the daily workings of business,
communication, and, increasingly,
everyday life worldwide.
The perspective you take today,
the creativity you apply to pro
gramming now, may very well be
the catalysts for a brand new way of
accomplishing the most routine
tasks. For changing the way people
interact with machines. Or for put
ting a computer on every desktop in
the country.
