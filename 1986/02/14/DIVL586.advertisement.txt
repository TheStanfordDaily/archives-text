The toughest job
you'll ever love

We admit it. It takes a dif
ferent kind of person to be a Peace
Corps volunteer.
We won't mislead you with
glowing pictures of exotic lands. The
hours as a volunteer are long. The
pay is modest. And the frustrations
sometimes seem overwhelming. But
the satisfaction and rewards are im
mense. You'll be immersed in a new
culture, become fluent in a new
language, and learn far more about
the third world — and yourself —
than you ever expected.
You'll also discover that prog
ress brought about by Peace Corps
volunteers is visible and measurable:
Such as health clinics established in
the Philippines; Fresh-water fish
ponds constructed in Kenya; roads
and schools and irrigation systems
built in Upper Volta; tens of thou
sands of people given essential skills
in farming, nutrition, the skilled
trades, business, forestry, and other
specialties throughout the develop
ing world.
Being a volunteer isn't for
everyone, and it isn't easy, but to the
people of the developing nations
who have never before had basic* 4
health care or enough to eat, the
Peace Corps brings a message of
hope and change.
We invite you to look into the
volunteer opportunities beginning in
the next 3-12 months in Africa,
Asia, Latin America, and the Pa
cific. Our representatives will be
pleased to provide you with details.
