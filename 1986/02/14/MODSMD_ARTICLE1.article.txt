# SOS A constructs new shantytown
## 
### CHRIS PAGE Staff writer 
Using stronger and more weather-resistant
materials, members of Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA) rebuilt the White Plaza shan
tytown yesterday, less than a week after its
destruction.
Beams and a steel roof were added to insure
the two buildings do not collapse and to protect
protesters who plan to sleep in the structures.
Construction of a third building is slated for
later this week.
Stanford police have not identified the person
or persons responsible for destroying the
structure, which was discovered in pieces on the
ground at about 1:30 a.m. Sunday, Stanford
Police Capt. Marvin Moore said earlier this
week.
"People's initial reaction is, 'This is ugly,' but
apartheid is ugly," SOSA member Joel Bellen
son said of the shantytown. He added, "This
may be an eyesore, but apartheid is a lifesore."
Construction began at 11:30 a.m. and contin
ued throughout the day. Workers said they
received positive reactions from most passing
students and were assisted by a few. "They just
picked up a hammer and asked, 'What can I
do?' " Bellenson said.

Not all reactions were encouraging. Lisa
Price, who helped with the building, said that
two students confronted builders with questions
such as, "Do you have a permit?" and, "Are
you going to kill the grass?" She said, however,
that after some discussion, even these skeptics
became more sympathetic.
SOSA member Mike Tarpey said that the
buildings were constructed to "keep an aware
ness up." He said that "unless you can picture
apartheid you can't relate to it."
"We need to raise consciousness to a pitch"
where action will occur, Bellenson added.
The buildings were originally built by "just a
group of concerned people," Price said. "This
time it is definitely a SOSA project."
According to Bellenson and Tarpey, the
shantytown symbolizes two things: it shows
Stanford students' support for the fight of black
South Africans against white rule, and recalls
the living conditions of black families in actual
shantytowns on the outskirts of white townships
in South Africa.
SOSA members said that in South Africa,
many black families live in cardboard homes not
unlike the buildings in White Plaza. They move
to the shantytowns in defiance of government

edicts in order to live closer to the fath
ers in those families who work in
white cities. Workers are issued pass
books, which allow them to travel
and live near the city, but their
families are not.
The Stanford shantytown's
destruction was also a symbolic act,
according to SOSA members. In
South Africa, government groups
routinely burn the towns and force
families to leave. However, the blacks
continually return, just as SOSA did.
Price said that although she did not
know the motives behind the destruc
tion of the White Plaza shantytown,
she thought that the action was
"cowardly."
"If they have some point, they
should come out and say it," Price
said.
Bellenson added, "It is not like
they were not aware of what it (the
destruction) meant."
Commenting on South African

President P.W. Botha's recent action
to replace the passbook carried by
blacks with less controversial identifi
cation cards, Bellenson said, "I con
sider apartheid to be our generation's
Nazism. In Germany all people had
IDs, just as in South Africa." He
added that the Jews had armbands,
while today's blacks have identifica
tion cards.
SOSA members have not deter
mined how long the shantytown will
remain in White Plaza. Bellenson and
Tarpey said that the length of its stay
would depend on student reaction
and on the perceived effectiveness of
the structure.
SOSA will station members in
front of the buildings with pamphlets
and a petition, signed by approxi
mately 1,200 Stanford students, de
manding divestment, Tarpey said.
Bellenson and Tarpey also empha
sized that SOSA is seeking criticism
of its shantytown project. He said
that this would allow group members
to assess student reaction to the
structure, and would help them gauge
its impact.

received positive reactions from most passing
students and were assisted by a few. "They just
picked up a hammer and asked, 'What can I
do?' " Bellenson said.

Not all reactions were encouraging. Lisa
Price, who helped with the building, said that
two students confronted builders with questions
such as, "Do you have a permit?" and, "Are
you going to kill the grass?" She said, however,
that after some discussion, even these skeptics
became more sympathetic.
SOSA member Mike Tarpey said that the
buildings were constructed to "keep an aware
ness up." He said that "unless you can picture
apartheid you can't relate to it."
"We need to raise consciousness to a pitch"
where action will occur, Bellenson added.
The buildings were originally built by "just a
group of concerned people," Price said. "This
time it is definitely a SOSA project."
According to Bellenson and Tarpey, the
shantytown symbolizes two things: it shows
Stanford students' support for the fight of black
South Africans against white rule, and recalls
the living conditions of black families in actual
shantytowns on the outskirts of white townships
in South Africa.
SOSA members said that in South Africa,
many black families live in cardboard homes not
unlike the buildings in White Plaza. They move
to the shantytowns in defiance of government

edicts in order to live closer to the fath
ers in those families who work in
white cities. Workers are issued pass
books, which allow them to travel
and live near the city, but their
families are not.
The Stanford shantytown's
destruction was also a symbolic act,
according to SOSA members. In
South Africa, government groups
routinely burn the towns and force
families to leave. However, the blacks
continually return, just as SOSA did.
Price said that although she did not
know the motives behind the destruc
tion of the White Plaza shantytown,
she thought that the action was
"cowardly."
"If they have some point, they
should come out and say it," Price
said.
Bellenson added, "It is not like
they were not aware of what it (the
destruction) meant."
Commenting on South African

President P.W. Botha's recent action
to replace the passbook carried by
blacks with less controversial identifi
cation cards, Bellenson said, "I con
sider apartheid to be our generation's
Nazism. In Germany all people had
IDs, just as in South Africa." He
added that the Jews had armbands,
while today's blacks have identifica
tion cards.
SOSA members have not deter
mined how long the shantytown will
remain in White Plaza. Bellenson and
Tarpey said that the length of its stay
would depend on student reaction
and on the perceived effectiveness of
the structure.
SOSA will station members in
front of the buildings with pamphlets
and a petition, signed by approxi
mately 1,200 Stanford students, de
manding divestment, Tarpey said.
Bellenson and Tarpey also empha
sized that SOSA is seeking criticism
of its shantytown project. He said
that this would allow group members
to assess student reaction to the
structure, and would help them gauge
its impact.
