# SOS A constructs new shantytown
## 
### CHRIS PAGE Staff writer 
Using stronger and more weather-resistant
materials, members of Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA) rebuilt the White Plaza shan
tytown yesterday, less than a week after its
destruction.
Beams and a steel roof were added to insure
the two buildings do not collapse and to protect
protesters who plan to sleep in the structures.
Construction of a third building is slated for
later this week.
Stanford police have not identified the person
or persons responsible for destroying the
structure, which was discovered in pieces on the
ground at about 1:30 a.m. Sunday, Stanford
Police Capt. Marvin Moore said earlier this
week.
"People's initial reaction is, 'This is ugly,' but
apartheid is ugly," SOSA member Joel Bellen
son said of the shantytown. He added, "This
may be an eyesore, but apartheid is a lifesore."
Construction began at 11:30 a.m. and contin
ued throughout the day. Workers said they
received positive reactions from most passing
students and were assisted by a few. "They just
picked up a hammer and asked, 'What can I
do?' " Bellenson said.

Not all reactions were encouraging. Lisa
Price, who helped with the building, said that
two students confronted builders with questions
such as, "Do you have a permit?" and, "Are
you going to kill the grass?" She said, however,
that after some discussion, even these skeptics
became more sympathetic.
SOSA member Mike Tarpey said that the
buildings were constructed to "keep an aware
ness up." He said that "unless you can picture
apartheid you can't relate to it."
"We need to raise consciousness to a pitch"
where action will occur, Bellenson added.
The buildings were originally built by "just a
group of concerned people," Price said. "This
time it is definitely a SOSA project."
According to Bellenson and Tarpey, the
shantytown symbolizes two things: it shows
Stanford students' support for the fight of black
South Africans against white rule, and recalls
the living conditions of black families in actual
shantytowns on the outskirts of white townships
in South Africa.
SOSA members said that in South Africa,
many black families live in cardboard homes not
unlike the buildings in White Plaza. They move
to the shantytowns in defiance of government
