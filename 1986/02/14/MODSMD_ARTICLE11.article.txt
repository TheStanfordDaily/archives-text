# New state seat belt law to be enforced March 1
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
A 60-day grace period designed to increase
awareness about California's new seat belt law
ends March 1 when Stanford police begin is
suing $20 fines to first-time violators of the law.
The law, which took effect Jan. 1, "prohibits
the operation of a motor vehicle unless the
driver and all passengers over the age of four
are restrained by a safety belt," according to a
statement from the Stanford Police Depart
ment's Special Services Unit.
Adherence to the law could possibly have
prevented a potentially serious injury in a two
car accident yesterday at Escondido Village, ac
cording to Special Services Unit Manager Dan
Smith.
The accident involved a five-year-old girl
who was thrown against the windshield of the
car in which she was riding. Her seat belt was
broken prior to the crash and not operable.
The child did not lose consciousness and
escaped serious injury, according to Gabi
Waldherr, records secretary at the Stanford
Police Department.
The child's name has not been released.
The new seat belt law, which Gov. George
Deukmejian authorized in September, states
that all persons 17 and older are responsible for
securing their own seat belts, while younger

riders are considered the responsibility of the
driver. Riders under the age of four are re
quired under another law to sit in child car
seats.
"All vehicle operators are also responsible
for making sure that their vehicle's seat belts are
in working order. The only exceptions are cars
and trucks manufactured before seat belts were
standard equipment," according to the state
ment.
Drivers, however, may not be pulled over
solely for violating the seat belt law.
"If a car is pulled over for another offense,
and if the driver or a passenger is unrestrained
upon the officer's arrival at a point of visual
confirmation, it is assumed that a violation has
occurred," the release states.
During the grace period established by the
California Highway Patrol, Stanford police are
issuing warnings to violators of the law, Smith
said. Police have not yet given citations, he said.
"We do know that awareness about seat belts
is definitely up," Smith said, citing media
coverage of the law during the grace period as a
contributing factor.
Smith said he had no data showing what
percentage of drivers pulled over at the Univer
sity are now violating the law.
California is the 16th state to adopt a manda
tory seat belt law.
