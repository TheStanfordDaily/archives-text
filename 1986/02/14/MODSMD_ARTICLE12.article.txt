## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Shanty rebuilding right

If guests and fish start to go bad after three days,
how long can a cardboard symbol be effective?
When it was first erected, the shantytown in White
Plaza was a good way of bringing the suffering of South
African blacks closer to home. The shacks were so in
congruous with the neighboring structures that they
forced everyone who passed by to give the apartheid
state in South Africa at least a moment's thought.
Whether you spent that moment sneering at the
idealism of Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA) or
pondering your university's investments in that
country, shantytown made you think.
After a while, naturally, the effect of the symbol
began to fade. The cardboard shacks gradually became
a part of the White Plaza scenery, and in doing so, they
lost a good deal of their power to raise conscious
nesses. Even the SOSA members who built shan
tytown seemed to be running out of gas by last Satur
day night, the first night since their construction that
no one slept in the shacks.
That was the night that unidentified vandals
knocked the shanties to the ground. Their motives are
unknown, and they simply don't matter. As Black Stu
dent Union President Steve Phillips said, even if the act
was not racist in intent, it was racist in effect. The van

dals silenced a voice in the chorus of cries against
apartheid, and expressed contempt for the sincere
commitment of the SOSA members who built the
shacks. The fact that shantytown might have been
beginning to grow a little old in no way excuses their
act.
That is why we applaud yesterday's reconstruction of
shantytown in White Plaza. It sends a message to those
who destroyed the shacks and those who wish they
had: SOSA is serious about racism in South Africa and
racism here on campus, and it will keep working until
changes have been made. Once again, the shantytown
symbol is fresh and powerful.
But SOSA must realize that it will not stay that way
for long. Sooner or later, the bikers and pedestrians
will become acclimated to the shacks again, and when
that happens it will be time to take shantytown down.
There are plenty of ways of fighting racism, and there
is no reason to put energy into one that has lost its
power to impress. An alternative might be to follow
the lead of Dartmouth University and hold a day-long
student forum on racism, in the hopes that education
could prevent an act like the destruction of shantytown
from happening again.
In the meantime, though, the shacks are back. And
we're glad.
