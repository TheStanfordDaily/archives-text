## Farm must regain ideals 
### 
1 would like to respond to a recent suggestion that it is
hypocritical to participate in a system, in this case Stan
ford University, with which one has developed fundamen
tal differences. I think this is an important question to
consider because it concerns the relationship of a dissident
to his or her society.
In its founding grant, the ideals of Stanford are made
clear in two short paragraphs. And although it may be un
reasonable to expect ideals to be present realities, there is
no untowardness in expecting that they at least be in a
continual and deliberate process of realization. This is the
basis of my difference, as a concerned student, with this
university. I feel that 1 see well-entrenched tendencies
that seem to lead away from rather than toward those
ideals. In my opinion, it would be a great hypocrisy to sit
silently by and submit, rather than to engage the forces
behind those tendencies in discussion and dialectical
struggle.
In their founding vision. Senator and Mrs. Stanford
were concerned with creating an influence on behalf of
humanity and civilization. Their expressed purpose was to
create a university for the benefit of all humankind. Their
vision was not limited by the borders or values of any
single nation but was based on what they saw to be univer
sal principles of human aspiration. Stanford, in other
words, is a world university and not simply a national
resource for one country. This is why I, as an African, can
speak with the same authority as any American. I am not
here as a guest, but as a member of the family.

This being the case, there is good reason to be con
cerned about ethnocentric bias and an over-preoccu
pation with the industrial economy of the United States. It
is an attitude of cultural hegemony that leads to polariza
tion rather than to understanding between people. What I
have seen here are dangerous tendencies that subvert
Stanford's true nature as a world center of learning and
research for the benefit of all humanity — a civilizing
haven from the coarse tribal instincts of nation-states and
races. We simply cannot allow Stanford to be used as an
instrument by reactionary cabal whose sole purpose is to
remove Stanford from its world-context, and place it in
alignment with the highly hegemonistic ambitions of a
small and racially homogeneous sect of American society.
It was a staunch U.S. patriot and Republican,
President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who warned us in his
farewell address of 25 years ago about the ominous and
growing influence of what he termed "the military
industrial complex." With its fascination for hard technol
ogy. capital intensive science, standardization of human
beings, close-control and big systems, its rise to power was
quite inevitable. There is a quasi-Teutonic grandeur about
big machines and precisely engineered societies — no
chaos and no starkly dissonant opinions, just an even
toned and even-tempered sameness.
At Stanford, many of these qualities seem to be slowly
creeping in. We see a highly visible and extremely arro
gant police force, guns swaying from their hips as they
swagger through the Quad, or sitting there observing,
monitoring you. in smart repose, mounted like gods atop
gleaming red motorbikes, jack boots and microphoned
helmets with shiny darkened visors, oh so macho and so
extreme, maintaining law and order as sirening cop cars
with flashing lights and floodlights case some students on
mopeds and others of us caught in the felonious act of
riding bicyles without headlights on lighted sidewalks,
stopping me for interrogation for being a black man
walking through campus and minding his own business.
We see a so-called "student center" with a cold and unin
viting atmosphere and a coffee house run by a high
handed corporation whose biggest business is with pris
ons. We sec the militarization of research. We watch the
commercialization of science take place in our midst, and
most frighteningly of all, we are eyewitnesses to the indus
trialization of intellect and the standardization of opinion.
We arc in fact historical people. We are watching a
monolithic and anti-human vision of the 21st century
being erected before our very eyes, and yet we refuse to
think about these trends, but quietly join in and become
made into its image.
The education here is moving dramatically from the Big
Picture approach to mechanistic tinkering in the micro
details of technique and unholistic problem-solving tricks.
We are losing our sense of integration and the connection
between our learning and our living. The emphasis is
shifting from learning how to think originally to learning
how to follow instructions, how to be cunning, and how to
employ highly specific tactics to the solution of highly spe
cific and artificially well-defined symbolic problems. This
is wrong. In the real world, contemporary problems do

not come in problem sets or in well-constructed boxes.
They are messy, ill-defined and hazy — without clear-cut
answers. They require us to make original connections, to
discuss discordant values and to wrap our minds in am
biguity. A university with pretensions to excellence should
not be in the business of producing obedient workers and
job seekers. That is the job of factory schools, trade
schools and polytechnical institutes. Given its preten
sions, Stanford's duty is to be educating thinkers, creators,
planners and leaders. It should be empowering its stu
dents with the vitriol of original vision. We are not slaves
for the salt mines. We should be the visionaries who write
the script for the new century. This is what it ought to
mean to be a graduate of a top world university. This is
what it ought to mean to hold a degree from Stanford.
"Why ate we here if'wVdo not like it here?" you ask.
"Why stay in the belly of what we call the beast?" This is a
false dilemma to pose: "Stanford, love it or leave it!" as if
there were no third alternative, the path of growth and
change. If everyone left systems they did not love, and
clung only to those they did love, there would be no inter
action and development on earth. We are here because we
believe strongly in the innate goodness and the fullness of
the only so partially realized ideals and possibilities of
Stanford. We came here not as foes, but as champions of
Stanford's stated virtues. We believe that the projection
of this virtue should be more than just a shimmering and
useful exercise in image-building. And we intend to build
here and to leave not as enemies or as disillusioned alums
but as friends. This is why we take the time and spend the
energy to agitate for change. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,
called himself an American because of the Declaration of
Independence, not because of the reality of Jim Crow. In
the same spirit, we call ourselves Stanfordians.
We must continually and consistently remind ourselves
of Senator and Mrs. Stanford's founding vision of humane
service to humanity in order to truly understand why we
are here, why we should be here, and why we must agitate
for the development of that vision. In a fluid and puzzling
world where people have flexible and situationally
dependent motivations, we can understand that creden
tialization may often be sought at the expense of an eye
opening education. But it is the particular responsibility of
the privileged to try to shape what is in accord with what
ought to be. In this turbulent and uncertain world, educa
tion entails an even greater obligation, for it is the only
light that future leaders will have as their guide. A high
paying job is simply not enough. And if we leaders — all
of us here at Stanford — allow ourselves to become
encrusted with cynicism and opportunism, we can only
guarantee 4hat our self-interest will be harmed as we lead
others — whether as managers, entrepreneurs, doctors,
lawyers, engineers, educators or politicians — into a
future of unthinking graspingness. I think it is more
humble than arrogant to be concerned with larger issues
than one's highly constrained self. This is why I differ so
passionately with what I have seen here at Stanford. But,
more importantly, this is why I remain here.
The fact of the founding vision of a true world center of
civilizing force gives me hope. With a few changes in atti
tude and orientation, Stanford can embody its true virtue.
And it is energizing people like the anti-apartheid protes
tors who will force the realization of this virtue here. They
are the true Stanfordians, they and those who fight in
subtle ways (if only within their private minds) as they
struggle with questions, doubt and the forces of their con
sciences, absent though they may be from the streets or
from Soweto Plaza. Being an energizer does not require
demonstration (it may be silent and private), it only re
quires non-acceptance of and non-cooperation with what
is wrong. Apartheid is only one small part of a vast
panoply of issues. But it is a beginning. And those who
have been touched are most certainly not hypocrites by
remaining here and fighting to change things for the bet
ter. To be a hypocrite is to feign virtues or to broadcast
beliefs that one does not really hold. The very fact that a
dissident is willing to undergo the difficulties, the frustra
tions and the calumnies of non-conformity is a sure sign of
sincerity. There is no comfort in non-conformity. There is
only the inner peace that comes with knowing that you are
acting in accord with your beliefs, that you are being
honest with yourself and with others, that you are not
bowing to conformist pressures, that you are not being a
mass-produced person and ultimately that you are not
being a fake, but — quite simply — that you are simply
being who you really are; and, for that reason, you know
that you most definitely belong because you are most
definitely needed. Society cannot long last without its
dissidents fighting for its ideals, for without them it will
never grow. It will die in stagnation. This is why I am here.
This is why the anti-apartheid protest exists.
Joseph Edozien is the president of the Stanford African
Students' Association.
