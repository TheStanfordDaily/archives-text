# AS AT is threat to peace
## 
### 
Once again, the U.S. public has the opportunity to
watch its government make a series of inane decisions in
volving a weapons system that will end up being more
trouble than it's worth.
This system is the antisatellite weapon (ASAT) — a
weapon designed to attack military satellites. Military
satellites have missions that range from tracking enemy
ships and observing weather conditions to warning of nu
clear missile launches. They are the space-based eyes and
ears of the military, and they are absolutely critical to our
national security. Because each side can see what the
other is doing, surprise attack is impossible. And because
it is impossible, it is extrememly unlikely that either side
would see any advantage in striking first in a crisis.
Since satellites are working for our safety, it would
seem reasonable to expect that the military would avoid
building weapons that could threaten them. No such luck.
We are presently teetering on the edge of an ASAT arms
race.

ASAT development in both the United States and the
Soviet Union dates back to the late 19605. We built a
fairly useless system that we lost interest in during the
'70s, and the Soviets still have a fairly useless system. The
Soviet ASAT has been tested 20 times — 11 times un
successfully. It isn't much of a threat because it has a ter
rible homing device and is very slow. It takes hours to
reach its target, which gives us plenty of time to in
capacitate it or move out of the way. Also, their ASAT
isn't too worrisome because it can't go into very high or
bits, and so threatens very few of our military satellites.
Our most vital ones — early warning satellites, for in
stance — are far out of its reach.
In 1976 the Soviets embarked on a series of ASAT tests
in the attempt to develop a new homing device. Every one
of these tests was a failure, but in 1977 — for obscure
reasons — the Carter Administration declared the Soviet
ASAT operational and chose to develop a new ASAT of
its own. At the same time, the Administration initiated
ASAT negotiations, but these never got very far.
Up until a few months ago, when the Pentagon con
ducted its first test of this new ASAT against a target,
there was a tacit understanding between the U.S. and the
Soviet Union: "We won't test ours if you won't test
yours." Yet the worst-case analysts at the Pentagon had
been busily cooking up terrifying scenarios of Soviet mili
tary superiority in space, and the Administration decided
to go ahead full tilt with the ASAT program. There were

three basic reasons for this decision. 1) The Soviets have
one and we don't. 2) We are proceeding with our AS AT
program in order to demonstrate the resolve that will
bring the Soviets to the bargaining table. Once they get
there we'll work on banning ASATs. 3) If we could ban
them we would, but we can't because there's no way to
verify an ASAT ban.
The Reagan Administration is not widely known for its
flawless logic.
As the situation stands now, the Soviet ASAT poses
little or no threat to our satellites close to the earth, and
absolutely none to our most valuable ones that are
deployed in higher orbits. The ASAT we are testing now,
however, threatens many more vital Soviet military
satellites, because it is much better, and because the
Soviets deploy a majority of their vital satellites in low or
bit, within reach of our ASAT. If we continue to test our
system to the point where it is deployable, there will be no
chance to limit or ban it, because it is so small that it can
be easily hidden. So the Administration's main rationale
for continuing to develop this dangerous weapon — that
an ASAT ban is unverifiable — is a self-fulfilling prop
hecy.
At this point the Soviets will begin working on an en
tirely new kind of ASAT — one that can threaten our
most critical satellites — and the ASAT race will be off
and running with no hope of return.
What is most important to understand is the vital roJe
satellites play in our national security and the threat
ASATs pose to it. It's an irresponsible defense policy for
the Administration to continue testing ASATs while refus
ing to negotiate a treaty limiting or banning them. What's
more, none of the reasons for this policy really holds
water. While it's true that the Soviets have an ASAT sys
tem, to call it operational is an exaggeration and to call it a
threat is paranoia. In either case, upping the ante by de
veloping a much more threatening ASAT of our own is
not the answer to this problem.
Secondly, we don't need to develop an ASAT in order
to bring the Soviets to the bargaining table. They were
willing to negotiate during the Carter Administration, and
have presented two draft treaties to the Reagan clan.
Lastly, it's simply not true that we can't verify an ASAT
treaty. We can never say with 100 percent certainty that
the Soviets are not cheating; after all, some zealously
patriotic Soviet citizen could be hiding an ASAT or two in
his basement. However, we can be sure that any ASATs
they might develop while trying to avoid detection would
be a negligible threat to our satellites.
In any case, it's silly to nitpick over the unlikely possi
bility that the Soviets would bother to cheat in a manner
that couldn't give them any real military advantage. And
this nitpicking is an extremely weak excuse for not going
ahead with the kind of arms control that could enhance
our security by protecting our satellites against future So
viet ASATs.
