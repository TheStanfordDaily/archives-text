Attacks on frats
are unfair, wrong
How thrilling that your editorial
staff has taken time out from pressing
world issues to tackle something
closer to home (The Daily, Feb. 11).
How disappointing that they did so in
such a shallow and whimsical manner.
First and foremost, fraternities are
not "obviously" sexist or elitist.
Whether they are sexist or elitist at all
is a matter for vigorous debate, cer
tainly one that would require more
time and effort than I care to take
here. However, it serves to remind
you that the mere fact fraternities are
all-male organizations does not make
them sexist. That latter notion implies
fraternity members being somehow
"better" than non-members, a theory
both groups would no doubt
strenuously deny in principle. I
wonder why your staff didn't bother
to accuse the so-called "black" fra
ternities of being racist. It certainly
seems to follow the same line of logic.
Secondly, the debate for the last
two years over the future of fraterni
ties at Stanford centered, if my
memory serves me correctly, on their
being in spirit with the goals of
"Residential Education," not
whether there was an effective means
of dealing with isolated instances of
disorderly conduct. To dismantle the
fraternity system, as you so casually
suggest, solely for that reason would
be as much as admitting the Univer
sity's utter impotence in curbing the
type of incidents to which you refer
(and so effectively publicize).
Yes, the Theta Delt situation has
been sloppily handled, but all is far
from lost. The Interfraternity Coun
cil, in particular, has made huge
strides toward providing fraternities

with some measure of self
governance, and the University has
largely kept pace by improving com
munication between their officials
and fraternity members. To talk of
putting fraternities in the housing
draw for the misbehavior of an aber
rant minority is, at best, sensational.
Perhaps I fall victim to that by reply
ing. On the other hand, someone
needs to speak up before those who
know less start to take you people
seriously.

Story on senate
contained errors
1 write to express my disappoint
ment with the article entitled
"University fears effect of tax bill"
(The Daily, Feb. 7). The article re
ported on matters discussed in the
University's Academic Senate
Meeting of Feb. 6. The author incor
rectly summarized the comments I
made in my regular report to the sen
ate. The article stated:
"Provost James Rosse also an
nounced that he will release, at the
beginning of next quarter, a report on
the implementation of the recom
mendations made to alter the rela
tions between the University and the
Hoover Institution.
"The Rosse report will respond to
improper political activy by Hoover.
The allegations were investigated last
year by a senate committee chaired
by Sociology Prof. Sanford
Dornbusch."
In fact, I made no comments that
could be construed to indicate that I
would release a report about altering
relations between the University and

Hoover. Nor will 1 be releasing a
report about improper political activ
ity by Hoover. The total content of
my comments before the senate is
captured by the following paragraph
from the minutes of the meeting
prepared by the academic secretary:
"Provost Rosse opened his report
by responding to the question regard
ing adminstrative progress in imple
menting the recommendations of the
Dornbusch report. He has asked the
Steering Committee to schedule that
report to the senate for the last
meeting of winter quarter or the first
meeting of spring quarter."
As you can see, the meanings are
quite different.

Letter on shanties
misses their point
James Dickey's comments on the
uselessness of the cardboard shan
tytown recently torn down in White
Plaza show that he has missed one of
the major purposes of the shan
tytown. The shantytown, as I see it, is
not simply a show of solidarity with
oppressed South Africans, but also a
constant reminder to us of the condi
tions which face black South Africans
daily. Living on our campus filled
with palm trees, elaborate buildings
and friendly faces, it is easy to forget
the sharply contrasting conditions of
others. Perhaps not all Stanford stu
dents have gotten lost in our isolated
fantasy world, but many have, and
the shantytown is a necessary
reminder that not everyone has it so
good.
The destruction of the shantytown
seems to be an attempt to ignore

reality. If we, as the "future leaders"
of the United States, cannot deal with
the oppressive treatment of others,
the continuance of such realities as
the shantytowns in South Africa ap
pears very likely.

Use academicians
at Commencement
An unfortunate phenomenon on
our campuses is the use of public
lectures for left-wing diatribes, an ex
pression of student "activism." Con
servative speakers are not invited,
and if they are invited by a non
student group they are often har
assed or even warned not to appear.
On complex international issues
about which both sides should be
heard, students show little interest in
experts, of whom we have many on
the faculty. If a department uses its
meager funds to pay a visiting scholar
a small honorarium, an attendance of
10 or less is a common occurrence. At
the same time, activists with access to
abundant student funds pay large
honoraria to individuals who are es
sentially rabble-rousers. This is a
device by which the left replenishes
its funds. A few years ago I wrote to
The Daily suggesting that a maximum
of $100 be set on honoraria, but the
response was zero.
The issue has arisen again with
regard to the Commencement
speaker. Last year a suggestion that
President Reagan be invited was im
mediately turned down for security
reasons (!), so Mario Cuomo was
invited instead to burnish the Demo
cratic Party's image. When Gorba
chev was first proposed, no one raised
the security issue, so he apparently is

persona more grata than Reagan. In
their letter (The Daily, Feb. 3) stu
dents from the Class of '86 brought
up the objection, but their unkind
remark about "a retired chemistry
professor" was unfair. Obviously we
want good speakers, but they are not
unknown in academia. I think of men
like Kenneth Boulding, whose latest
books — "The World as a Total Sys
tem" and "Human Betterment" —
are evidence of his intellectual stat
ure.
I have obtained from the Univer
sity Archives a list of Commencement
speakers since 1892; surprisingly,
such a list is not in print. The older
ones were all academicians or
"intellectuals," or at least not
politicians, although some had a con
servative or liberal bent. While they
could not compete with Bob Hope,
most of the academicians were excel
lent speakers. I have compared notes
with some old-timers; praised as
speakers were David Starr Jordan
(1915,'16) Ray Lyman Wilbur
('21,'26-7,'29,'33-4,'37,'39,'40, '43
— he saved the University thousands
in Commencement honoraria!),
Robert A. Millikan ('23), Isaiah
Bowman ('45), Lee Du Bridge ('47),
Clark Kerr ('52), Barnaby Keeney
('6O), Archibald Cox ('74) and
Daniel Patrick Moynihan ('75).
During the first half century the
speakers were virtually all
academicians, then public figures
predominated, as Commencement
became more of a public relations op
eration. Apart from Herbert Hoover
('25,'35), who spoke as a senior
member of the Stanford family, the
first politician was Charles Percy
('7O) — a distinguished figure whose
daughter was graduating from Stan
ford. In recent years, politicians have
appeared more frequently: e.g.,
Andrew Young ('79) and Mario

Cuomo ('B5). Perhaps the next phase
will be the comedian era — a device
used by some institutions to attract
attention.
Stanford traditionally has not given
honorary degress; this is a useful
shield against insistent pressure to
honor politicians. By politicizing the
Commencement address, the Univer
sity is in fact circumventing or sub
verting this excellent principle. There
are first-class academic speakers,
and, instead of being treated like
second-class citizens, they should give
the Commencement address as repre
sentatives of what universities are
supposed to be all about.
In view of the non-response to my
earlier letter, I can only say of stu
dents, or at least student activists,
"They have ears and hear not." Be
cause of pressure from students, the
record of Stanford Commencements
shows a steady decline from the
original respect for intellectual
achievements which made Stanford
famous.

Matherly correct
on Russian invite
I read your column about the Gor
bachev invitation (Jason Matherly,
The Daily, Feb. 10). I want to com
mend you for your maturity and in
sight. I have been simmering about
the juvenile stupidity displayed by the
class presidents. It is nice to see there
is someone who understands. Please
do not think 1 am putting down young
people. My generation has its full
quota of individuals who refuse to
deal with reality.
