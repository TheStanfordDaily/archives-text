# Davies' rejection shakes History Dept.
## 
### KRISTEN BROWN Staff writer 
A History Department decision to deny
a professorship to visiting Prof. Norman
Davies, the director of Stanford's new
overseas study program in Krakow,
Poland, has shocked and angered faculty
members who say Davies is one of the
world's leading experts on Polish affairs.
The department's refusal to appoint
Davies to a now vacant professorship in
East European studies suggests that the
"department is waiting for 'Jesus Christ" "
to boost the department and its interna
tional reputation, according to a faculty
member in the department who wished to
remain anonymous.
And History Prof. Terence Emmons,
who headed the search committee dedi
cated to filling the professorship, said, "I
think [Davies] is the leading historian of
Poland in the English-speaking world."
Davies, who obtained his doctorate from
the Jagiellonian University in Krakow, is

one of the few people in the free world
whose degree was granted from an Eastern
bloc university.
Davies' book, "Heart of Europe: A
Short History of Poland," made The New
York Times Book Review in the history
category for 1985. In the review, Leszek
Kolakowski, a professor at the University
of Chicago, said: "This is beyond a doubt
not only the best book on Poland in the
English language; it is the book on
Poland."
In reference to the decision, Davies said,
"It is a disappointment for me that Stan
ford will not be going forward with this ap
pointment in East European history.
During my stay at Stanford I realized there
is great interest in East European affairs,
and that student demand was very enthusi
astic, partly because many students trace
their roots to Eastern Europe.
"It seemed to me that East European
studies was one of the areas in the
humanities where Stanford is weak and
where it could have built up its reputation

in the field," he said. "I was also hoping to
help Stanford create a small focus on
Poland studies partly because of the inter
est in the Slavic Department and partly be
cause of the overseas studies program."
The Davies decision came two weeks
before the History Department denied ten
ure to Asst. History Prof. Stephen Fer
ruolo, a move that has stirred controversy
over new requirements for hiring and
tenuring University faculty.
Since the retirement of Emeritus His
tory Prof. Wayne Vucinich in 1978, the
department has had a "long-going com
mitment to finding a professor in East
European Studies," said Prof. Paul Robin
son, chairman of the History Department.
In an interview earlier this week,
Vucinich said, "There is no question that
Davies is a very good scholar. I think most
history professors agree."
The very existence of the Robert
McDonnel Chairmanship for Eastern
European Studies, the seat vacated by
Vucinich, implies the History Department's

responsibility to have at least one profes
sor in the field of Eastern Europe, accord
ing to Emmons.
Four years ago, the department formed
a search committee to recruit a candidate.
History Prof. Alexander Dallin, a member
of the committee, said the group has been
reviewing possible candidates consistently
"for three to four years now."
The committee invited Davies to guest
lecture at Stanford in December 1984.
During the visit, Davies agreed to a year
long visiting professorship in 1985.
The History Department offer included
possibilities of a permanent professorhip,
according to Davies.
At the beginning of this quarter, the
search committee researched and
scrutinized his scholarship and teaching.
"The committee submitted a report and
proposal to hire or fire, and in this case the
committee was proposing he be retained,"
Vucinich said.
"After this was proposed, the
