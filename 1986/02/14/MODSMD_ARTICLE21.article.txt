## A 						proper shopper's art 
### MARILYN WANN Editorial staff 
How many major universities can
you name that are within funnelat
ing distance of a shopping mall?
Not to mention a golf course, an
Americana-ridden Main Street
complete with purple-haired 11-
year-old vagrants and an industrial
park.
It's enough to make a travel
agent charter the nearest L-1011 in
package-planning glee.
Really. You could spend your life
on Stanford-owned land and never
get bored.
As an undergrad, the University
mixes you with all your brilliant
peers and brings the whole beery
soup to a boil of academic fervor.
After graduation, it's a con
venient Bimmer commute into your
hi-tech swivel chair and young
adulthood.
Middle age brings grey-fringed
benefits and the time to peramb
ulate your checkbook down Uni
versity Avenue or play the new
Yuppie Generation version of
Trivial Pursuit. "How many crois
sants did the average Yuppie eat in
1985?" or "What is the leading
cause of Yuppie death? Tofu
poisoning, hardening of the follicles
due to mousse overdose or choking
by collar bar strangulation?"
You can even retire happily here,
waiting until plaid pants with
matching putter covers or
Alzheimer's — whichever comes
first — takes you out of the realm
of the respectably living.
But through it all, there's the
mall.
Shopping should be a distribu
tion requirement, something like
West Coast Culture or the World

Outside the Tank. It takes about
three units' worth of the average
student's time already.
Just try to remember the last
time you went to the mall and
didn't see someone with a Stanford
sweatshirt or backpack. I would
suggest to you that there are as
many student-hours spent there as
in the orange plastic chairs at
Meyer.
And where would you rather be,
sitting on something that is — as
much as you'd like to deny it — or
ange, or standing outside that
French bread and pastry place,
whiffing in the complex carbo
scented air?
I think if I could just stand
outside those doors long enough,
I'd achieve an altered state, or at
least hyperventilate in the process.
I'm just not good in malls. When

masses of mall-literate teenagers
press past me, I realize that evolu
tion has left me behind. While
they're following instinctive migra
tional patterns between Macy's and
The Limited, cycling effortlessly
through the seasonal fashion
changes, I'm getting lost in front of
some anonymous yogurt or ice
cream place.
I'm probably the only person in
the Bay Area who thinks Norney's
is a candy bar with nougat filling.
Don't you think it's an easy
enough mistake to think that the
Gap generally indicates a need for
orthodontia? I never wanted to go
to Banana Republic, either; it
sounded too fattening. And wasn't
Neiman-Marcus the guy who had
that "lean and hungry look" in
some Shakespeare play?
Lost as I get, there's a certain
soothing rhythm to the lifting of
sleeves, the looking at price tags
and sizes, the wrist-testing of
perfumes and the collection of their
little sample vials in intricate
cardboard holders.
It must be Zen.
Not the perfume, I mean the
peace-and-harmony thing — Yoda
with bad teeth and strange syntax,
Fourth of July sparklers dipped in
incense that splutters fumes.
Mall shopping is probably mere
Zen-like than Robert Pirsig's
motorcycles, the bread-buttering
scene in Diva and thrice-daily com
plaints about Food Service all
combined.
So as we enter the last inch of our
discussion on shopping malls, let's
observe a moment of silent medita
tion for Emporium-Capwell, Wool
worth's, Eddie Bauer and all the
other minor materialistic deities of
America.
