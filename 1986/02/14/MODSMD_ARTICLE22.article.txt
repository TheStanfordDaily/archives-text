# Chinese troupe invades Farm
## 
### SARAH LAU 
Officially, the group of 10 students
who performed the play
"Thunderstorm" here Tuesday night
were prominent examples of China's
"open door policy." Unofficially, the
group was here soaking up culture.
"They (the students) really had a
great time," said junior Alex Johns, a
theme assistant at East House,
where the group stayed during its
three-day visit to the Farm.
According to East House resident
Michael Lu, a sophomore, the tour
was"the first time these students
were out of China." Stanford was the
troupe's last stop on a U.S. visit that
brought them to 10 other U.S. uni
versities, all of them in Minnesota.
The Farm left a favorable impres
sion on most of the students. Wang
Guo-wen, who played a 17-year-old
rebel in the play, especially enjoyed
the Rodin sculpture garden. Wang
Shao-yong, who portrayed an old
man in the production, attended an
economics class here and said that he
found it similar to economics classes
at the Nankai University, though he
said that it was "slightly more theo
retical."
Many of the students commented
upon the size of the Stanford campus.
In comparison with Nankai Univer
sity, which is located in China's third
largest city, the Stanford campus is
relatively large and open.
After nearly a month in Minnesota,
the Chinese students were under
standably pleased with the Golden
State's agreeable climate. "They were
really impressed with the California
weather," Johns said.
Although the group performed
only on Tuesday night, they spent
three days in the Bay Area before
they returned to China. According to
Johns, the students spent much of
their free time shopping, attending
classes, and touring the campus. On

Wednesday, the group attended a
reception of Nankai University
alumni in San Francisco.
Some of the students discussed
their impressions of the United
States. Wang Gou-wen said that he
thought President Reagan was

"energetic for his age." Other stu
dents, such as Wang Jing-jing and
Sun Xue-jun, mentioned the the
great resources available to American
students.

Wang Shao-yong noted that his fa
vorite American author was Ernest
Hemingway, mainly because
Hemingway is "so easy to read." In
contrast Shao-yong said that he

found Mark Twain difficult and "too
colloquial."
Residents of East House stressed
that they enjoyed having the foreign
students visit. "We all had a ball,"
said Johns. "The Chinese students
stayed in East House students'
rooms, and everybody had a lot of
fun."
The troupe, which departed for

China yesterday morning, left with
favorable impressions of the United
States. One of the students, Cai Ben
hong, hopes to return to Minnesota
this summer. Others, like Shao-yong,
had no plans to return, but pleasant
memories.
"All people (in America) are com
monly warm-hearted and friendly,"
he noted.
