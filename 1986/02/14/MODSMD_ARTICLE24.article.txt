## Mummenschanz enlivens the junk pile 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
The Mummenschanz dance troupe
quietly walked the line line between
humor and drama in their Memorial
Auditorium appearance on Feb. 4.
The performers took the oddest
combination of costumes and props
and wielded them with a thematic
surety that frequently eludes even the
most seasoned dance groups. That
this confidence shone through and
made an impression on the audience
was largely a result of the topicality of
Mum menscha nz' material.
One of the most obvious hints that
Mummcnschanz wasn't presenting
the ordinary fare troupes usually
present was the complete absence of
music throughout the two hours the
dancers were onstage. Foi these dan
cers, the stage wasn't as much a rep
resentation of a piece of the real
world as it was a game board. And
the game this troupe was playing was
clear from the start.
Two gigantic, mischievous hands
began the show by slowly opening the
curtains — as if some secret were
about to be divulged — and prancing
around the stage. One of them even
ran offstage and pointed with glee at
the audience members in the front
row, scampering up and down the
aisle and jabbing a monstrous index
finger in each viewer's face.
These amusing hands-come-to-life
were more than just diversionary fig
ures, it turned out. The way they
wove in and out of the subsequent
vignettes gave a great deal of insight
into the enormous amount of our per
sonalities that we invest in our hands.
Every gesture made the pair of play
ful white-gloved characters seem
more and more like living beings.

astounding their audience at every
turn.
At almost every turn, anyway. The
first act was chiefly interesting as long
as a new costumed twist came into the
"plot." But eventually, the gyrations
of the coils and balloons grew pre
dictable.
Granted, it was a unique way of
handling the problem of making
movement entertaining. But an hour
of shapes coming onstage and
galumphing around for five minutes
apiece grew tiring. There are only so
many ways of making one theme in
teresting over an extended period of
time, especially when no other diver
sions are there to occupy the audi
ence's attention.

But the theme in itsell once you
could tease it out of the quiet perfor
mance — was oddly engrossing in its
own way. The hands were the com
mon denominator. II it hadn't been
for the way they interacted with the
strange, stubborn black and gray
creatures In shoving them around
once in a while 01 dolloping them
with added "parts" they clearly
disliked having, the first half of the
show would have been wasted.
The theme «>1 the show revolved
around some indefinite composition
about the interplay between
humanity and its technology (as seen
by the entire "cast," which was basi
cally technological flotsam given the
breath of life bv a drunken god). And

to make that concept matter to the
audience, the troupe clearly felt it had
to re emphasize the novelty ol these
bizarre forms b\ throwing them
onstage in different incarnations o\er
and over again.
The problem with this emphasis
was that it brought about a lack of
tension, and it hung heavily in the air
toward the end of the hour. Inert
movement in heavy doses became
stultifying after awhile.
The hands were presented as being
the closest things onstage to
humanity. They clearly pulled the
strings, even when they got into arro
gant mixups that had the more
animalistic shapes rearing on them in
anger. I heir retreat was enhanced b\
the fact that the\ had legs (as well as
swift mentalities) and could scamper
away in time to escape the silent
wrath of the tentacled coils.

The end of the first hour saw the
manual mischief take on a slightly
more sinister tone as a faceless
humanoid (one of the dancers
dressed in a pitch-black body mask
with an impassive metal plate fora
face) ran onstage, immediately fol
lowed by the pair of hands. As the
humanoid staggered about blindly,
the hands played a progressively
teasing game of keep-away with the
humanoid, making it scurry back and
forth between their grasping palms.
The second hour was far more con
trolled than the first because it dealt
less with the repetitive shapes and
more with the next stage in the Mum
mcnschanz evolutionary scale, the
humanoids.

Typical of the ingenuity which
characterized the last half of the per
formance was a scene featuring two
bod\-masked humanoids meeting
each other onstage — one with a wall
socket for a head, and one with an
electrical plug for a head. True, the
audience could predict what was
going to happen, but that fact only
made the union of the two characters
even more charming.
The electrical-plug-headed gu\
sported a flashlight that he flicked on
and off while he was alone onstage.
He threw it into the sidelines when
his mate appeared, and when they
plugged into each other, lights off
stage switched on and off. The whole
scene was calculated to elicit roman
tic noises from the audience, which it
did handily.
Another character livening up this
hour was only a step down from the
hands in terms of cleverness. A
humanoid with a suitcase for a head,
this rogue chased after presumably
female humanoids and beguiled them
into opening his suitcase head.
At one point the suitcase character
charmed a female humanoid (played
by Fressetto) with an assortment of
mirrors, opening his head, pulling out
;i mirror, sticking it on Fressetto's
blank face and having her glance at
herself in another mirror at the bot
tom of the suitcase. She expressed
enthrallment, gesturing with joy and
skipping in place. The wily suitcase
then took out a couple more mirrors
and stuck them to her face for eyes,
mouth and a nose.
Again Fressetto capered about in
ecstasy. Hut for his coup de grace, the
suitcase took out all the rest of his
mirrors and tacked them all over the
humanoid's face, turning what was in
itially ingratiating into something
teetering toward malice. It is that un
dercurrent of playfulness with a mean
streak that carried the show forward.
The most visually exciting part of
the show was saved for the end. The
curtain opened on a looming black
balloon figure with projecting in
dentations for eyes, nose and mouth.
It hovered there indefinitely, then it
started filling up w ith air and expand
ing to fill the entire stage.
The hands came onstage, staring
out at the audience, failing to see the
inflating presence behind them.
When they finally turned around and
saw it. they made leaps of surprise.
I hey began trying to push the shape
backstage, but it just kept surround
ing them like an amoebic blob.
I•ventually. however, the hands got
the balloon back in its place, and the
shape lilted to reveal the dancers in
human form. Bowing before the audi
ence. the sight of the dancers out of
their mechanistic costumes formed
the resolution of the silent tug-of-war
between animation and inertia that
had been going on for the past two
hours.

A bizarre huinanoid (dressed in a pitch-black bo h nuiJ \if It »triny\
silhouette fora head) gambols about onstage
The Mummenschanz dance troupe
quietly walked the line line between
humor and drama in their Memorial
Auditorium appearance on Feb. 4.
The performers took the oddest
combination of costumes and props
and wielded them with a thematic
surety that frequently eludes even the
most seasoned dance groups. That
this confidence shone through and
made an impression on the audience
was largely a result of the topicality of
Mum menscha nz' material.
One of the most obvious hints that
Mummcnschanz wasn't presenting
the ordinary fare troupes usually
present was the complete absence of
music throughout the two hours the
dancers were onstage. Foi these dan
cers, the stage wasn't as much a rep
resentation of a piece of the real
world as it was a game board. And
the game this troupe was playing was
clear from the start.
Two gigantic, mischievous hands
began the show by slowly opening the
curtains — as if some secret were
about to be divulged — and prancing
around the stage. One of them even
ran offstage and pointed with glee at
the audience members in the front
row, scampering up and down the
aisle and jabbing a monstrous index
finger in each viewer's face.
These amusing hands-come-to-life
were more than just diversionary fig
ures, it turned out. The way they
wove in and out of the subsequent
vignettes gave a great deal of insight
into the enormous amount of our per
sonalities that we invest in our hands.
Every gesture made the pair of play
ful white-gloved characters seem
more and more like living beings.

astounding their audience at every
turn.
At almost every turn, anyway. The
first act was chiefly interesting as long
as a new costumed twist came into the
"plot." But eventually, the gyrations
of the coils and balloons grew pre
dictable.
Granted, it was a unique way of
handling the problem of making
movement entertaining. But an hour
of shapes coming onstage and
galumphing around for five minutes
apiece grew tiring. There are only so
many ways of making one theme in
teresting over an extended period of
time, especially when no other diver
sions are there to occupy the audi
ence's attention.

But the theme in itsell once you
could tease it out of the quiet perfor
mance — was oddly engrossing in its
own way. The hands were the com
mon denominator. II it hadn't been
for the way they interacted with the
strange, stubborn black and gray
creatures In shoving them around
once in a while 01 dolloping them
with added "parts" they clearly
disliked having, the first half of the
show would have been wasted.
The theme «>1 the show revolved
around some indefinite composition
about the interplay between
humanity and its technology (as seen
by the entire "cast," which was basi
cally technological flotsam given the
breath of life bv a drunken god). And

to make that concept matter to the
audience, the troupe clearly felt it had
to re emphasize the novelty ol these
bizarre forms b\ throwing them
onstage in different incarnations o\er
and over again.
The problem with this emphasis
was that it brought about a lack of
tension, and it hung heavily in the air
toward the end of the hour. Inert
movement in heavy doses became
stultifying after awhile.
The hands were presented as being
the closest things onstage to
humanity. They clearly pulled the
strings, even when they got into arro
gant mixups that had the more
animalistic shapes rearing on them in
anger. I heir retreat was enhanced b\
the fact that the\ had legs (as well as
swift mentalities) and could scamper
away in time to escape the silent
wrath of the tentacled coils.

The end of the first hour saw the
manual mischief take on a slightly
more sinister tone as a faceless
humanoid (one of the dancers
dressed in a pitch-black body mask
with an impassive metal plate fora
face) ran onstage, immediately fol
lowed by the pair of hands. As the
humanoid staggered about blindly,
the hands played a progressively
teasing game of keep-away with the
humanoid, making it scurry back and
forth between their grasping palms.
The second hour was far more con
trolled than the first because it dealt
less with the repetitive shapes and
more with the next stage in the Mum
mcnschanz evolutionary scale, the
humanoids.

Typical of the ingenuity which
characterized the last half of the per
formance was a scene featuring two
bod\-masked humanoids meeting
each other onstage — one with a wall
socket for a head, and one with an
electrical plug for a head. True, the
audience could predict what was
going to happen, but that fact only
made the union of the two characters
even more charming.
The electrical-plug-headed gu\
sported a flashlight that he flicked on
and off while he was alone onstage.
He threw it into the sidelines when
his mate appeared, and when they
plugged into each other, lights off
stage switched on and off. The whole
scene was calculated to elicit roman
tic noises from the audience, which it
did handily.
Another character livening up this
hour was only a step down from the
hands in terms of cleverness. A
humanoid with a suitcase for a head,
this rogue chased after presumably
female humanoids and beguiled them
into opening his suitcase head.
At one point the suitcase character
charmed a female humanoid (played
by Fressetto) with an assortment of
mirrors, opening his head, pulling out
;i mirror, sticking it on Fressetto's
blank face and having her glance at
herself in another mirror at the bot
tom of the suitcase. She expressed
enthrallment, gesturing with joy and
skipping in place. The wily suitcase
then took out a couple more mirrors
and stuck them to her face for eyes,
mouth and a nose.
Again Fressetto capered about in
ecstasy. Hut for his coup de grace, the
suitcase took out all the rest of his
mirrors and tacked them all over the
humanoid's face, turning what was in
itially ingratiating into something
teetering toward malice. It is that un
dercurrent of playfulness with a mean
streak that carried the show forward.
The most visually exciting part of
the show was saved for the end. The
curtain opened on a looming black
balloon figure with projecting in
dentations for eyes, nose and mouth.
It hovered there indefinitely, then it
started filling up w ith air and expand

and off while he was alone onstage.
He threw it into the sidelines when
his mate appeared, and when they
plugged into each other, lights off
stage switched on and off. The whole
scene was calculated to elicit roman
tic noises from the audience, which it
did handily.
Another character livening up this
hour was only a step down from the
hands in terms of cleverness. A
humanoid with a suitcase for a head,
this rogue chased after presumably
female humanoids and beguiled them
into opening his suitcase head.
At one point the suitcase character
charmed a female humanoid (played
by Fressetto) with an assortment of
mirrors, opening his head, pulling out
;i mirror, sticking it on Fressetto's
blank face and having her glance at
herself in another mirror at the bot
tom of the suitcase. She expressed
enthrallment, gesturing with joy and
skipping in place. The wily suitcase
then took out a couple more mirrors
and stuck them to her face for eyes,
mouth and a nose.
Again Fressetto capered about in
ecstasy. Hut for his coup de grace, the
suitcase took out all the rest of his
mirrors and tacked them all over the
humanoid's face, turning what was in
itially ingratiating into something
teetering toward malice. It is that un
dercurrent of playfulness with a mean
streak that carried the show forward.
The most visually exciting part of
the show was saved for the end. The
curtain opened on a looming black
balloon figure with projecting in
dentations for eyes, nose and mouth.
It hovered there indefinitely, then it
started filling up w ith air and expand
ing to fill the entire stage.
The hands came onstage, staring
out at the audience, failing to see the
inflating presence behind them.
When they finally turned around and
saw it. they made leaps of surprise.
I hey began trying to push the shape
backstage, but it just kept surround
ing them like an amoebic blob.
I•ventually. however, the hands got
the balloon back in its place, and the
shape lilted to reveal the dancers in
human form. Bowing before the audi
ence. the sight of the dancers out of
their mechanistic costumes formed
the resolution of the silent tug-of-war
between animation and inertia that
had been going on for the past two
hours.
