# 'Down and Out': the case of the non-ending
## 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
Like two other newly released comedies —
"The Best of Times" and "Hannah and Her
Sisters" — "Down and Out in Beverly Hills"
has impeccable credentials. Director/writer
Paul Mazursky and co-writer Leon Capetanos
are fresh from their triumph with "Moscow
on the Hudson," and Nick Nolte is one of our
most consistently entertaining and underrated
leading men.
Mazursky was lured to Disney's
Touchstone Films with promises of a
relatively free rein, and if any current director
is likely to do justice to a remake of Jean
Renoir's light farce "Boudu Saved from
Drowning," Mazursky seems the ideal choice.
I haven't seen the original "Boudu," but
Mazursky's deft touch with the characters in
"Moscow" demonstrated a love of human
comedy that matches the sensibility in all of
Renoir's films.
That Mazursky is a decidedly more uneven
talent than Renoir (one of the four or five
greatest filmmakers of all time, by anyone's
standards) is clearly evidenced in "Down and
Out." At once charming and vaguely un
satisfying, the movie never quite develops
beyond its funny early scenes. The filmmakers
seem to run out of ideas about their charac
ters.
The movie opens wonderfully in the swank
shopping district of Beverly Hills, where
mangy Jerry Baskin (Nolte) trundles his shop
ping cart of possessions along streeets which

appear cleaner than himself. The Talking
Heads tune "Once in a Lifetime," which plays
over the credits, wasn't written for these
scenes, but it might have been. We see Jerry's
attachment to his dog — his only companion
— who scrounges in dumpsters with him.
Later that day Jerry naps and wakes to find
that his dog has abandoned him. In despair,
he attempts suicide in the pool of the
Whitemans. But Dave Whiteman (an engag
ingly restrained Richard Dreyfuss) rescues
him and insists that he live with them till he
fully recovers.
The movie is a comedy of contrasts. Jerry is
an irreverent, grungy, vaguely hostile bum
who gradually reveals a surprising back
ground and intelligence. The Whitemans are
staid, dissatisfied nouveau riche Californians
initially shaken by his presence, but driven, by
an undefined sense of guilt, to help him. Jerry
acts as a primal force in this whitewashed en
vironment, and soon he's releasing, and
curing, everyone's pent-up anxieties and
frustrations.
For the first hour, this setup is more than
promising. Richard Penniman (a.k.a. Little
Richard), as the Whitemans' neighbor, has a
very funny speech on their lawn the night
their burglar alarm inadvertently goes off. We
are introduced to the family's hangups, Jerry
quickly enters the scene, and he Soon begins
subverting the Whitemans' cherished values.
In an attempt to get their dog to eat, Jerry
eats dog food; asked to change clothes, he un
dresses in the yard; at lunch with Dave, he

invites a vagrant friend into a posh sidewalk
cafe.
The little incidents seem to be building
towards terrific payoffs, with each Whiteman
wholly deserving his or her comeuppance. But
something strange happens: Mazursky and
Capetanos, having set up their overstuffed
targets for comic destruction, suddenly come
over all warm and human, and the jokes begin
to fizzle.
"Down and Out" treads an uneasy line be
tween all-out satire and humanistic comedy,
and it's easy to see how one might cancel out
the other. The Whitemans are presented as a
silly, shallow family of neurotics, so the movie
doesn't know where to go once Jerry begins
curing their hangups and they turn into ful
filled, mushy rich folks.
Jerry takes Dave Whiteman down to the
beach to meet his vagrant buddies (a nice
scene in itself), but once Dave comes back a
happier, superficially more enlightened man,
the filmmakers don't know exactly what to do
with him. Sexually repressed Barbara
Whiteman is satisfied by Jerry, and afterwards
not even Bette Midler can energize her newly
fulfilled, vacuous persona. It's generally a
mistake to set up caricatures and then try to
humanize them by removing some of the
craziness that makes them funny in the first
place. By the last half of the film, the writers
seem to be undermining their own initial
satiric intentions.
The Whitemans have a definite comic life in
the early scenes. Cinematographer Donald
McAlpine gives their Beverly Hills luxury

lifestyle the look of glazed fruit, which
matches their mentality. The Whitemans are
stoned on wealth. They don't know what to
do with all they have, so they invest in a dog
psychiatrist rather than deal with their dog
themselves, or they hire a guru fora religious
experience a week. They have the money, but
they try too hard to look like they're comfort
able; there's a vaguely dissociated quality
about their living in this big, brightly lit,
white-on-white paradise.
Midler's zany stage presence is much toned
down here, but she still makes the strongest
comic impression of the cast. When the still
repressed Barbara runs about the house, she
hangs on to her jiggling bosom, and Midler
flounces around in a joyous, unself-conscious
parody of a dizzy rich broad. As Max
Whiteman, Evan Richards goes from a home
movies junior Spielberg to a preening movie
queen with adroit skill, and Donald Muhich,
Tracy Nelson and Elizabeth Pena all make
impressions in their minor roles.
Mazursky does a great job of capturing the
rather precarious, profoundly superficial
mental state of the Whiteman family, but he
doesn't go beyond it. A humanist like
Mazursky might balk at an all-out, nasty
satiric attack, but anything else comes across
as light-headed as the Whitemans themselves.
The way "Down and Out" is structured, Jerry
cures the entire family, but because everyone
turns out more or less the same (with some of
their craziness excised), they need repeated
curing, and this leads to repetitive comedy.
Plus, there are so many Whitemans to be

straightened out that we can guess what's
coming with the last couple, so the story ac
quires a stale patina by the last half-hour.
Mazursky has no way to wrap up the movie;
he ends with a big comical chase around the
house, gratuitous fireworks and everyone
winding up in the pool. That finale was old
when the Marx Brothers were starting out.
But the movie has a bigger problem — in
the character of Jerry himself. Nick Nolte is
such a terrific actor that he almost has us
believing that he's portraying a fleshed-out
human being, and Jerry starts out (like every
one else) primed to reveal a full-blown comic
persona beneath the scruffiness and stench.
But too often we have no idea what Jerry
thinks of the Whitemans; he doesn't detest
their values (as Boudu did in the original), but
he subverts them as a matter of course, and
we don't know if he's doing it deliberately or
by reflex, for himself or for them. At one
point, when he heads back to the streets in
disgust, and the Whitemans look after him
with traces of amusement and affection, it's
not clear what their expressions mean. Do
they realize they need him? Thi§ ambiguity
may be deliberate, but it doesn't come across
as terribly clever or profound.
If things were clearer up to this point, an
amibiguous ending could work, but as it is, it
comes across as irresolute and sloppy.
There's such a lack of resolution in "Down
and Out" that the filmmakers' fixation on dog
antics and comic running-around seems a
kind of fudging, a way of getting around some
of the stickier implications of their material.

talent than Renoir (one of the four or five
greatest filmmakers of all time, by anyone's
standards) is clearly evidenced in "Down and
Out." At once charming and vaguely un
satisfying, the movie never quite develops
beyond its funny early scenes. The filmmakers
seem to run out of ideas about their charac
ters.
The movie opens wonderfully in the swank
shopping district of Beverly Hills, where
mangy Jerry Baskin (Nolte) trundles his shop
ping cart of possessions along streeets which

appear cleaner than himself. The Talking
Heads tune "Once in a Lifetime," which plays
over the credits, wasn't written for these
scenes, but it might have been. We see Jerry's
attachment to his dog — his only companion
— who scrounges in dumpsters with him.
Later that day Jerry naps and wakes to find
that his dog has abandoned him. In despair,
he attempts suicide in the pool of the
Whitemans. But Dave Whiteman (an engag
ingly restrained Richard Dreyfuss) rescues
him and insists that he live with them till he
fully recovers.
The movie is a comedy of contrasts. Jerry is
an irreverent, grungy, vaguely hostile bum
who gradually reveals a surprising back
ground and intelligence. The Whitemans are
staid, dissatisfied nouveau riche Californians
initially shaken by his presence, but driven, by
an undefined sense of guilt, to help him. Jerry
acts as a primal force in this whitewashed en
vironment, and soon he's releasing, and
curing, everyone's pent-up anxieties and
frustrations.
For the first hour, this setup is more than
promising. Richard Penniman (a.k.a. Little
Richard), as the Whitemans' neighbor, has a
very funny speech on their lawn the night
their burglar alarm inadvertently goes off. We
are introduced to the family's hangups, Jerry
quickly enters the scene, and he Soon begins
subverting the Whitemans' cherished values.
In an attempt to get their dog to eat, Jerry
eats dog food; asked to change clothes, he un
dresses in the yard; at lunch with Dave, he

invites a vagrant friend into a posh sidewalk
cafe.
The little incidents seem to be building
towards terrific payoffs, with each Whiteman
wholly deserving his or her comeuppance. But
something strange happens: Mazursky and
Capetanos, having set up their overstuffed
targets for comic destruction, suddenly come
over all warm and human, and the jokes begin
to fizzle.
"Down and Out" treads an uneasy line be
tween all-out satire and humanistic comedy,
and it's easy to see how one might cancel out
the other. The Whitemans are presented as a
silly, shallow family of neurotics, so the movie
doesn't know where to go once Jerry begins
curing their hangups and they turn into ful
filled, mushy rich folks.
Jerry takes Dave Whiteman down to the
beach to meet his vagrant buddies (a nice
scene in itself), but once Dave comes back a
happier, superficially more enlightened man,
the filmmakers don't know exactly what to do
with him. Sexually repressed Barbara
Whiteman is satisfied by Jerry, and afterwards
not even Bette Midler can energize her newly
fulfilled, vacuous persona. It's generally a
mistake to set up caricatures and then try to
humanize them by removing some of the
craziness that makes them funny in the first
place. By the last half of the film, the writers
seem to be undermining their own initial
satiric intentions.
The Whitemans have a definite comic life in
the early scenes. Cinematographer Donald
McAlpine gives their Beverly Hills luxury

lifestyle the look of glazed fruit, which
matches their mentality. The Whitemans are
stoned on wealth. They don't know what to
do with all they have, so they invest in a dog
psychiatrist rather than deal with their dog
themselves, or they hire a guru fora religious
experience a week. They have the money, but
they try too hard to look like they're comfort
able; there's a vaguely dissociated quality
about their living in this big, brightly lit,
white-on-white paradise.
Midler's zany stage presence is much toned
down here, but she still makes the strongest
comic impression of the cast. When the still
repressed Barbara runs about the house, she
hangs on to her jiggling bosom, and Midler
flounces around in a joyous, unself-conscious
parody of a dizzy rich broad. As Max
Whiteman, Evan Richards goes from a home
movies junior Spielberg to a preening movie
queen with adroit skill, and Donald Muhich,
Tracy Nelson and Elizabeth Pena all make
impressions in their minor roles.
Mazursky does a great job of capturing the
rather precarious, profoundly superficial
mental state of the Whiteman family, but he
doesn't go beyond it. A humanist like
Mazursky might balk at an all-out, nasty
satiric attack, but anything else comes across
as light-headed as the Whitemans themselves.
The way "Down and Out" is structured, Jerry
cures the entire family, but because everyone
turns out more or less the same (with some of
their craziness excised), they need repeated
curing, and this leads to repetitive comedy.
Plus, there are so many Whitemans to be

straightened out that we can guess what's
coming with the last couple, so the story ac
quires a stale patina by the last half-hour.
Mazursky has no way to wrap up the movie;
he ends with a big comical chase around the
house, gratuitous fireworks and everyone
winding up in the pool. That finale was old
when the Marx Brothers were starting out.
But the movie has a bigger problem — in
the character of Jerry himself. Nick Nolte is
such a terrific actor that he almost has us
believing that he's portraying a fleshed-out
human being, and Jerry starts out (like every
one else) primed to reveal a full-blown comic
persona beneath the scruffiness and stench.
But too often we have no idea what Jerry
thinks of the Whitemans; he doesn't detest
their values (as Boudu did in the original), but
he subverts them as a matter of course, and
we don't know if he's doing it deliberately or
by reflex, for himself or for them. At one
point, when he heads back to the streets in
disgust, and the Whitemans look after him
with traces of amusement and affection, it's
not clear what their expressions mean. Do
they realize they need him? Thi§ ambiguity
may be deliberate, but it doesn't come across
as terribly clever or profound.
If things were clearer up to this point, an
amibiguous ending could work, but as it is, it
comes across as irresolute and sloppy.
There's such a lack of resolution in "Down
and Out" that the filmmakers' fixation on dog
antics and comic running-around seems a
kind of fudging, a way of getting around some
of the stickier implications of their material.
Like two other newly released comedies —
"The Best of Times" and "Hannah and Her
Sisters" — "Down and Out in Beverly Hills"
has impeccable credentials. Director/writer
Paul Mazursky and co-writer Leon Capetanos
are fresh from their triumph with "Moscow
on the Hudson," and Nick Nolte is one of our
most consistently entertaining and underrated
leading men.
Mazursky was lured to Disney's
Touchstone Films with promises of a
relatively free rein, and if any current director
is likely to do justice to a remake of Jean
Renoir's light farce "Boudu Saved from
Drowning," Mazursky seems the ideal choice.
I haven't seen the original "Boudu," but
Mazursky's deft touch with the characters in
"Moscow" demonstrated a love of human
comedy that matches the sensibility in all of
Renoir's films.
