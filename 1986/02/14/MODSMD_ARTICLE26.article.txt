Ran (1985)
Fine Arts Theatre, Palo Alto
This gloss on "King Lear" could
be Akira Kurosawa's answer to the
question that lies at the heart of the
play's mystery: "Is there a cause in
nature that makes these hard
hearts?" Hidetora (Tatsuya
Nakadai) is a warlord who owes his
kingdom to his own bloody con
quests of neighboring lands; two of
his three sons are married to women
who were themselves the spoils of
war and whose families he annih
ilated in order to annex their castles.
In Kurosawa's conception, the
destruction of Hidetora's kingdom is
a direct response to the old chief
tain's brutality and mercilessness.
Kurosawa, now 75, seems to be
saying that if we're going to feel
compassion for Hidetora, it will
have to be because he's old and
weak and mad and helpless, not be
cause he's earned our sympathy.
And we can infer a different but
parallel message about "Ran" itself:
we're going to have to respond to
the film because it is brilliant ant
not because it's likable or exciting or
funny, like Kurosawa's earlier
movies. It's Kurosawa's most
obstinate work, espousing a tough,
unyielding humanism that you have
to wrestle with. But it is brilliant.
Plays this week.

The Shooting Party (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Alan Bridges, a supervisor of
great restraint and intelligence in
"The Return of the Soldier," turns
into a filmmaker with this full-scale
(and remarkably faithful) adapta
tion of Isabel Colegate's fine 1980

novel. Set on the eve of
WWI, this movie uses Jean
Renoir's metaphor of the hunt to il
luminate the state of mind and heart
of the British aristocracy in the last
days of its glory. The writing is
acutely attentive, the acting by a
robust cast (James Mason in his last
movie role, Edward Fox, Cheryl
Campbell, Dorothy Tutin, Robert

Hardy. Judi Bowker and others) as
supple and unself-consciously re
vealing as a great production of
Anton Chekhov.
Plays Monday and Tuesday with
"Wetherby."
M(1931)
Camera One, San Jose
Peter Lorre was a distinguished
German stage actor when he made
this early sound film for Fritz Lang.
(The same year, he starred in the
original production of Odon von
Horvath's "Tales from the Vienna
Woods.") He is so extraordinary
here that one wants to cry out
against the injustices perpetuated
against him in Hollywood, where he
was typed as a horror movie creep.
He manages to make the child mur
derer hero of "M" simultaneously
s\ pathetic and repellent (as Bruce
Davidson would do in his portrayal
of the child molester in "Short
Eyes," 46 years later). "M" is often
thought of as Lang's finest achieve
ment.
Plays Tuesday with "Metropolis."
I)ersu Uzala (1977)
Camera One, San Jose
Akira Kurosawa filmed this
picture in Russia; it is about an
amazing old Mongolian who is hired
as scout fora cartographical expedi

tion and his friendship with the chief
of that expedition. Dersu lives in
perfect harmony with nature; he
teaches the Russians how to reap
her benefits without disturbing her
balance. This is a very unusual
movie: sweet-natured and yet so
grand visually that it takes one's
breath away. Kurosawa and his pho
tographers make woods, snow and
even the embers of a campfire so
vivid that Dersu's insistence that
each is the embodiment of an inde
pendent spirit actually seems likely.
Among a number of great sequences
is one that might have been con
ceived by Hans Christian Anderson:
Dersu saves himself and his new
comrade from the fury of a
snowstorm by building a shelter out
of brush, and as the two men set to
work with apparently superhuman
speed and construct something
strong and astonishingly beautiful
out of nothing, the task takes on a
magical aura.
Plays Sunday through Monday.
Aniadeus (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
Peter Shaffer, who wrote the play
and the movie version, has a knack
for hatching dramatic ideas that
sound fascinating until you examine
them carefully, and he is the shrew
dest of used car salesmen when it
comes to second-guessing his audi
ence. This time the issue is the form
of genius, and he begins with what
seems to.be a revisionist view of mu
sical history's most redoubtable
genius, Mozart (Tom Hulce), whose
gifts are couched in a grotesque
form — a facetious, arrogant,
scatological twit. Shaffer has rigged
it so only Salieri (F. Murray Abra
ham), the official court composer to
Emperor Joseph II of Austria, has
the vision to comprehend the
revolutionary complexity of
Mozart's music, and thus (and this is
Shaffer's prize irony) to acknowl
edge — and rage privately about —

his own pitiful inadequacy. But this
kind of cynical approach to an es
tablished view of greatness is de
mode for the 1980s, and Shaffer
knows it, so he pulls back form
Salieri's envenomed perceptions
halfway through the drama and
shows us what Salieri himself can't
see — that Mozart is no silly,
dimpled weakling, but a man of
passion (and a man of the people,
who adore his music — even though
the aristocracy can't appreciate it).
It must have been the combination
of these deep-seeming popular ideas
and all the period pomp that drew
the director, Milos Forman, to this
project.
Plays this Sunday night.
The Wages of Fear (1953)
La Maison Francaise
In Henri-Georges Clouzot's fa
mous suspense thriller, four men
stuck in a crummy South American
town because of lack of funds agree
to an American oil company's offer
of $2,000 apiece to drive trucks full
of nitro over crude country roads (in
order to combat an oil fire). The
treatment of the careless Americans
is transparent, but the rest of the
movie is wound breathtakingly tight,
laid out with exactitude, and almost
unbearably tense. The film suggest
Camus energized by a first-rate ac
tion director, and the opening
scenes in the sleepy town are like
the early scenes in Huston's
"Treasure of the Sierra Madre."
The drivers are played by Charles
Vanel, Folco Lulli, Peter Van Eyck.
and the young Yves Montand, who
has the presence of a new Jean
Gabin. (Clouzot includes a tribute
to Gabin's greatest role, "Pepe Le
Moko.") Stunningly shot by Ar
mand Thirard, and co-starring Vera
Clouzot (in an ill-conceived role).
Plays this Wednesday night.

Dersu saves himself and his new
comrade from the fury of a
snowstorm by building a shelter out
of brush, and as the two men set to
work with apparently superhuman
speed and construct something
strong and astonishingly beautiful
out of nothing, the task takes on a
magical aura.
Plays Sunday through Monday.
Aniadeus (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
Peter Shaffer, who wrote the play
and the movie version, has a knack
for hatching dramatic ideas that
sound fascinating until you examine
them carefully, and he is the shrew
dest of used car salesmen when it
comes to second-guessing his audi
ence. This time the issue is the form
of genius, and he begins with what
seems to.be a revisionist view of mu
sical history's most redoubtable
genius, Mozart (Tom Hulce), whose
gifts are couched in a grotesque
form — a facetious, arrogant,
scatological twit. Shaffer has rigged
it so only Salieri (F. Murray Abra
ham), the official court composer to
Emperor Joseph II of Austria, has
the vision to comprehend the
revolutionary complexity of
Mozart's music, and thus (and this is
Shaffer's prize irony) to acknowl
edge — and rage privately about —

his own pitiful inadequacy. But this
kind of cynical approach to an es
tablished view of greatness is de
mode for the 1980s, and Shaffer
knows it, so he pulls back form
Salieri's envenomed perceptions
halfway through the drama and
shows us what Salieri himself can't
see — that Mozart is no silly,
dimpled weakling, but a man of
passion (and a man of the people,
who adore his music — even though
the aristocracy can't appreciate it).
It must have been the combination
of these deep-seeming popular ideas
and all the period pomp that drew
the director, Milos Forman, to this
project.
Plays this Sunday night.
The Wages of Fear (1953)
La Maison Francaise
In Henri-Georges Clouzot's fa
mous suspense thriller, four men
stuck in a crummy South American
town because of lack of funds agree
to an American oil company's offer
of $2,000 apiece to drive trucks full
of nitro over crude country roads (in
order to combat an oil fire). The
treatment of the careless Americans
is transparent, but the rest of the
movie is wound breathtakingly tight,
laid out with exactitude, and almost
unbearably tense. The film suggest
Camus energized by a first-rate ac
tion director, and the opening
scenes in the sleepy town are like
the early scenes in Huston's
"Treasure of the Sierra Madre."
The drivers are played by Charles
Vanel, Folco Lulli, Peter Van Eyck.
and the young Yves Montand, who
has the presence of a new Jean
Gabin. (Clouzot includes a tribute
to Gabin's greatest role, "Pepe Le
Moko.") Stunningly shot by Ar
mand Thirard, and co-starring Vera
Clouzot (in an ill-conceived role).
Plays this Wednesday night.

Ran (1985)
Fine Arts Theatre, Palo Alto
This gloss on "King Lear" could
be Akira Kurosawa's answer to the
question that lies at the heart of the
play's mystery: "Is there a cause in
nature that makes these hard
hearts?" Hidetora (Tatsuya
Nakadai) is a warlord who owes his
kingdom to his own bloody con
quests of neighboring lands; two of
his three sons are married to women
who were themselves the spoils of
war and whose families he annih
ilated in order to annex their castles.
In Kurosawa's conception, the
destruction of Hidetora's kingdom is
a direct response to the old chief
tain's brutality and mercilessness.
Kurosawa, now 75, seems to be
saying that if we're going to feel
compassion for Hidetora, it will
have to be because he's old and
weak and mad and helpless, not be
cause he's earned our sympathy.
And we can infer a different but
parallel message about "Ran" itself:
we're going to have to respond to
the film because it is brilliant ant
not because it's likable or exciting or
funny, like Kurosawa's earlier
movies. It's Kurosawa's most
obstinate work, espousing a tough,
unyielding humanism that you have
to wrestle with. But it is brilliant.
Plays this week.

The Shooting Party (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Alan Bridges, a supervisor of
great restraint and intelligence in
"The Return of the Soldier," turns
into a filmmaker with this full-scale
(and remarkably faithful) adapta
tion of Isabel Colegate's fine 1980

novel. Set on the eve of
WWI, this movie uses Jean
Renoir's metaphor of the hunt to il
luminate the state of mind and heart
of the British aristocracy in the last
days of its glory. The writing is
acutely attentive, the acting by a
robust cast (James Mason in his last
movie role, Edward Fox, Cheryl
Campbell, Dorothy Tutin, Robert

Hardy. Judi Bowker and others) as
supple and unself-consciously re
vealing as a great production of
Anton Chekhov.
Plays Monday and Tuesday with
"Wetherby."
M(1931)
Camera One, San Jose
Peter Lorre was a distinguished
German stage actor when he made
this early sound film for Fritz Lang.
(The same year, he starred in the
original production of Odon von
Horvath's "Tales from the Vienna
Woods.") He is so extraordinary
here that one wants to cry out
against the injustices perpetuated
against him in Hollywood, where he
was typed as a horror movie creep.
He manages to make the child mur
derer hero of "M" simultaneously
s\ pathetic and repellent (as Bruce
Davidson would do in his portrayal
of the child molester in "Short
Eyes," 46 years later). "M" is often
thought of as Lang's finest achieve
ment.
Plays Tuesday with "Metropolis."
I)ersu Uzala (1977)
Camera One, San Jose
Akira Kurosawa filmed this
picture in Russia; it is about an
amazing old Mongolian who is hired
as scout fora cartographical expedi

tion and his friendship with the chief
of that expedition. Dersu lives in
perfect harmony with nature; he
teaches the Russians how to reap
her benefits without disturbing her
balance. This is a very unusual
movie: sweet-natured and yet so
grand visually that it takes one's
breath away. Kurosawa and his pho
tographers make woods, snow and
even the embers of a campfire so
vivid that Dersu's insistence that
each is the embodiment of an inde
pendent spirit actually seems likely.
Among a number of great sequences
is one that might have been con
ceived by Hans Christian Anderson:
Dersu saves himself and his new
comrade from the fury of a
snowstorm by building a shelter out
of brush, and as the two men set to
