It is sort of silly to review the fa
mous Fish Market restaurant, as
we're sure that anyone who hasn't yet
eaten there has certainly heard about
it. But if such is not the case, this
column is for you — i.e., unadven
turous freshmen or new transfer stu
dents.
Since the restaurant doesn't take
reservations, one must usually idle
away about 20 minutes before being
seated. Such was the case last Friday
night.
But there is plenty to do while
waiting. One can buy a bottle of wine
(white, of course) for $4.50, enjoy
some fresh shrimp or crab cocktails,

or just check out the wide variety of
seafood sold in the outer market area.
Once seated, we immediately or
dered some appetizers: fresh sashimi
and steamed little-neck clams. That
was when we noticed the fresh sour
dough bread on the table — the kind
that's impossible to stop eating.
However, upon the arrival of our ap
petizers, our attention was diverted
elsewhere.
The sashimi ($5.50), consisting of
Hawaiian Ahi and Japanese Hamachi
(tuna and yellow tail), was fresh and
succulently tender. It was served with
spicy green mustard and soy sauce. If
you enjoy raw fish, you'll love it. And
if you've never tried it, you'll prob
ably still love it.
The steamed clams ($9.50) were
attractively served in a copper pot,
and came with lemon, drawn butter
and a bowl of the water they were
cooked in. We could find no fault

with the clams, but unless you are a
real fan of them, the price could be a
serious deterrent.
Although we had ordered a cup of
clam chowder for the next course, the
busy waitress decided to bring us our
entrees instead. No great catastrophe.
Liz, not a fan of fishy fish, ordered
the skewered combination of arctic
cod, scallops and Mexican shrimp
with green peppers and onions
($9.50).
Tim, a fan of the more daring
seafood items, opted for the Catalina
swordfish ($13.75) on the waitress'
suggestion.
Both entrees included a choice of
au gratin potatoes, parsley potatoes
or fishwife rice and freshly made
coleslaw, cottage cheese or cherry
tomatoes.
The brochette was charcoal-broiled
over mesquite wood, which really

brought out the flavor of the seafood.
The scallops and the shrimp were
both plump and juicy, and dominated
in flavor over the more standard cod.
The rest of the skewer was filled with
vegetables, which added diversity to
the entree, but clearly took second
place to the seafood.
The accompanying fishwife rice
was a perfect compliment to the
skewered combination — a mild rice
with a hint of spice.
The Catalina swordfish, simply
stated, was fantastic. The mesquite
charcoal flavor accented the complex
taste of this moist and meaty fish.
Even Liz (the "non-fishy" lover)
loved it.
The parsley potatoes were cooked
to the perfect consistency, and served
slightly buttered. The coleslaw was as
fresh as the fish, and fortunately mild
enough to not dominate the entree.
The availability of the swordfish is

limited (the Market catches them on
its own boats), so when they have it in
fresh, we would highly recommend it.
Our New England clam chowder
($1.15 — a bargain) arrived just as
we were digging into our entrees.
Since we had both sampled this
specialty before, we immediately
traded forks for spoons and ordered
more sourdough bread.
The Fish Market makes a mean
clam chowder, so inundated with
clam flavor that it must have been
simmered for hours. It supports a
generous population of clams, and
just the right amount of small potato
pieces.
Manhattan clam chowder is also
prepared, as are a host of other items
we wish we could have sampled.
From the Fish Market's own smoker,
salmon ($7.25), albacore ($4.75) or
a variety of other smoked fish is
available.

One can sample three different
types of raw oysters by ordering the
oyster combo ($5.85), or perhaps
some baked shellfish if you prefer.
Seafood salads, including the fa
mous avocado stuffed with crab meat
($7.75), are in abundance. Even
pasta appetizers and fresh steamed
artichokes are included on the menu,
so rest assured that there is something
to please everyone.
We ended our filling meal with two
cups of good cappuccino — a perfect
conclusion.
The staff is efficient and most
friendly, including a few faces you
may recognize on campus. So if you
are interested in an enjoyable lunch
or dinner, the secret is out. The Fish
Market is an excellent restaurant.
To quote an anonymous source we
heard talking on the pay phone as we
were leaving: "You've got to join us
— the menu is fantastic."

The steamed clams ($9.50) were
attractively served in a copper pot,
and came with lemon, drawn butter
and a bowl of the water they were
cooked in. We could find no fault

with the clams, but unless you are a
real fan of them, the price could be a
serious deterrent.
Although we had ordered a cup of
clam chowder for the next course, the
busy waitress decided to bring us our
entrees instead. No great catastrophe.
Liz, not a fan of fishy fish, ordered
the skewered combination of arctic
cod, scallops and Mexican shrimp
with green peppers and onions
($9.50).
Tim, a fan of the more daring
seafood items, opted for the Catalina
swordfish ($13.75) on the waitress'
suggestion.
Both entrees included a choice of
au gratin potatoes, parsley potatoes
or fishwife rice and freshly made
coleslaw, cottage cheese or cherry
tomatoes.
The brochette was charcoal-broiled
over mesquite wood, which really

brought out the flavor of the seafood.
The scallops and the shrimp were
both plump and juicy, and dominated
in flavor over the more standard cod.
The rest of the skewer was filled with
vegetables, which added diversity to
the entree, but clearly took second
place to the seafood.
The accompanying fishwife rice
was a perfect compliment to the
skewered combination — a mild rice
with a hint of spice.
The Catalina swordfish, simply
stated, was fantastic. The mesquite
charcoal flavor accented the complex
taste of this moist and meaty fish.
Even Liz (the "non-fishy" lover)
loved it.
The parsley potatoes were cooked
to the perfect consistency, and served
slightly buttered. The coleslaw was as
fresh as the fish, and fortunately mild
enough to not dominate the entree.
The availability of the swordfish is

limited (the Market catches them on
its own boats), so when they have it in
fresh, we would highly recommend it.
Our New England clam chowder
($1.15 — a bargain) arrived just as
we were digging into our entrees.
Since we had both sampled this
specialty before, we immediately
traded forks for spoons and ordered
more sourdough bread.
The Fish Market makes a mean
clam chowder, so inundated with
clam flavor that it must have been
simmered for hours. It supports a
generous population of clams, and
just the right amount of small potato
pieces.
Manhattan clam chowder is also
prepared, as are a host of other items
we wish we could have sampled.
From the Fish Market's own smoker,
salmon ($7.25), albacore ($4.75) or
a variety of other smoked fish is
available.

One can sample three different
types of raw oysters by ordering the
oyster combo ($5.85), or perhaps
some baked shellfish if you prefer.
Seafood salads, including the fa
mous avocado stuffed with crab meat
($7.75), are in abundance. Even
pasta appetizers and fresh steamed
artichokes are included on the menu,
so rest assured that there is something
to please everyone.
We ended our filling meal with two
cups of good cappuccino — a perfect
conclusion.
The staff is efficient and most
friendly, including a few faces you
may recognize on campus. So if you
are interested in an enjoyable lunch
or dinner, the secret is out. The Fish
Market is an excellent restaurant.
To quote an anonymous source we
heard talking on the pay phone as we
were leaving: "You've got to join us
— the menu is fantastic."

The Fish Market
3150 El Camino Real

It is sort of silly to review the fa
mous Fish Market restaurant, as
we're sure that anyone who hasn't yet
eaten there has certainly heard about
it. But if such is not the case, this
column is for you — i.e., unadven
turous freshmen or new transfer stu
dents.
Since the restaurant doesn't take
reservations, one must usually idle
away about 20 minutes before being
seated. Such was the case last Friday
night.
But there is plenty to do while
waiting. One can buy a bottle of wine
(white, of course) for $4.50, enjoy
some fresh shrimp or crab cocktails,

or just check out the wide variety of
seafood sold in the outer market area.
Once seated, we immediately or
dered some appetizers: fresh sashimi
and steamed little-neck clams. That
was when we noticed the fresh sour
dough bread on the table — the kind
that's impossible to stop eating.
However, upon the arrival of our ap
petizers, our attention was diverted
elsewhere.
The sashimi ($5.50), consisting of
Hawaiian Ahi and Japanese Hamachi
(tuna and yellow tail), was fresh and
succulently tender. It was served with
spicy green mustard and soy sauce. If
you enjoy raw fish, you'll love it. And
if you've never tried it, you'll prob
ably still love it.
