# Cosby won't talk without degree
## 
### ALLISON HARTWELL Editorial staff 
A spokesman for Bill Cosby yesterday
confirmed that University President
Donald Kennedy "has extended an invita
tion" to the comedian to speak at Com
mencement, but said Cosby would not ap
pear unless he is granted an honorary
degree from the University.
David Brokaw said yesterday that Cosby
has an engagement to host the Playboy
Jazz Festival in Los Angeles on June 15,
the same day as Commencement.

However, Cosby "would adjust his
schedule" and speak at graduation "if the
University bestowed an honorary degree,"
he said.
But Stanford does not give honorary
degrees, according to Marlene Wine, spe
cial assistant to Kennedy.
Wine said that if Cosby insists on a
degree, "he will not be coming."
If the University "wants to change its
policy," Cosby will come, Brokaw said, but
"right now we're not coming."
Cosby "appreciates the sentiments of

the (Stanford) students," Brokaw said,
adding that he was "honored" to finish
first in a poll conducted in the fall to deter
mine seniors' preference fora graduation
speaker.
He added that "nobody is more in
demand" than Cosby, and that "at this
point in his career he really deserves" an
honorary degree.
Cosby stars in the prime-time television
program "The Cosby Show."
According to Wine, the University has
received "no formal responses" from
Cosby or Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba

chev, who was invited last week by the
senior class presidents to speak at Com
mencement.
The Gorbachev invitation was left open
for the Soviet leader to visit the University
"as your plans permit."
The Associated Press reported yester
day that Gorbachev was considering com
ing to the United States in July fora sum
mit meeting with President Reagan, but
would make the trip only if significant
progress is reached on arms control before
that time.
