## Stanford hoopsters to face Golden Bears Men journey to Harmon 'Arena' for Pac-10 tilt 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
The place has been known for years as Harmon Gym.
It's an old structure in Berkeley on the campus of the Uni
versity ot California, seating 6,660 people who don't care
much about elbow room. It looks like your high school
gymnasium, only a little bigger â€” unless you're from In
diana, in which case it looks like your high school gym
nasium, only smaller.
It's one of those places that the Harlem Globetrotters
played in when they made those movies in the late '40s, a
small, intimate, cozy little bandbox.
When Coach Lou Campanelli came to Cal this year, he
declared that only high school teams play in gyms. Over
night, it became "Harmon Arena."
Campanelli's name change doesn't change the fact that
the facility is still inadequate for major college basketball,
making Oregon's McArthur Court look lavish in compari
son. Yet such conditions can turn a gym into a pit, a place
with a legendary home-court advantage.
It's into this gym that the Stanford men's basketball
team will take its hopes for postseason play tomorrow
night, as the teams battle for third or fourth place in the
Pacific 10 Conference.
Stanford and Cal are tied for third place in the Pac-10
with UCLA at 6-5, two games behind leaders Wash
ington and Arizona. Stanford is 12-11 overall, while Cal
is 14-7.
The Bears are 10-1 at Harmon, having won their first
nine before losing last Thursday to Arizona, 61-52. Their
83-61 win last Saturday over Arizona State broke a three
game losing streak.
"What we're looking at now is to try to finish in a
postseason tournament," Stanford Coach Tom Davis said.
"Maybe not win the championship, but to go as one of
those teams. To get into the top three is a key goal, and I
think the winner (tomorrow) could have a share of third."
Davis said he expects at least three Pac-10 teams to
receive berths in either the NCAA or National Invita
tional Tournament.
Harmon Gym is sold out for tomorrow night's
encounter, with all 6,660 seats expected to be filled
largely by Bears partisans hoping to turn the place into a
pit. Stanford students without tickets can see the game on
KICU (Channel 36), beginning at 8 p.m. The game is
being telecast nationally by ESPN.
What that national audience will see is a Stanford team
looking to avenge a 75-69 loss to Cal last month at Maples
Pavilion. That loss seemed to put Stanford out of the Pac
-10 race, but the Cardinal has come back with four wins in
its last five games.
In that game, senior Earl Koberlein tore ligaments in
his right knee midway through the first half in avoiding a
collision under the Cardinal basket. Koberlein underwent
surgery that week and is still walking with crutches with
his knee in a brace.

Center Howard Wright has manned the pivot well for Stanford and is one of the reasons the surprising Card
inal finds itself in the upper half of the Pac-10 entering the homestretch of the conference race.
Cal overcame a six-point halftime
deficit and rallied for the victory in
the final four minutes, led by guard
Kevin Johnson. He scored 23 points
to lead all scorers, including eight in
the final four minutes.
The Stanford defense has done well
stopping opponents' inside games,
but has given up points to guards.
Arizona State's Steve Beck scored 2N
points, including the game-winner in
last Thursday's 77-75 overtime loss
to the Sun Devils, and Arizona's
Steve Kerr scored 22 in last Satur
day's 62-56 victory over the Wildcats,

though he was held to six in the first
half.
"With Kerr we did a good job iden
tifying him and took away the jump
shot,'' Davis said. "Steve Beck can
hurt you from outside and driving
inside. Johnson can do the same. I le's
a lot like Beck. But if you give him to
much attention, they've got Leonard
Taylor and Dave Butler, who can
hurt you inside."
Butler, the Bears' starting power
forward, is the brother of Greg But
ler, Stanford's starting forward. He is
averaging 11.5 points and 8.1
rebounds per game. Taylor is scoring
12.3 points and pulling down eight
rebounds an outing.
Johnson combines with Chris

Washington to form one of the quick
est backcourts in the Pac-10.
Guard Todd Lichti, who had 22
points to pace Stanford last month,
remains the Cardinal's leading scorer
with a 16.6-point-per-game average,
seventh in the Pac-10.
Except for the season-long losses
of Koberlein and guard Steve Brown,
the Cardinal is healthy for tomor
row's game. Guard Novian Whitsitt,
who has averaged 14.2 points in his
last five games, missed the first
meeting with a pulled back muscle.
For those who won't be near a tele
vision tomorrow night, the game will
also be broadcast by KCBS (740
AM) and k/SU (90.1 FM).
