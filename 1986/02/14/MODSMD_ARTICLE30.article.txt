## Stanford hoopsters to face Golden Bears Men journey to Harmon 'Arena' for Pac-10 tilt 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
The place has been known for years as Harmon Gym.
It's an old structure in Berkeley on the campus of the Uni
versity ot California, seating 6,660 people who don't care
much about elbow room. It looks like your high school
gymnasium, only a little bigger â€” unless you're from In
diana, in which case it looks like your high school gym
nasium, only smaller.
It's one of those places that the Harlem Globetrotters
played in when they made those movies in the late '40s, a
small, intimate, cozy little bandbox.
When Coach Lou Campanelli came to Cal this year, he
declared that only high school teams play in gyms. Over
night, it became "Harmon Arena."
Campanelli's name change doesn't change the fact that
the facility is still inadequate for major college basketball,
making Oregon's McArthur Court look lavish in compari
son. Yet such conditions can turn a gym into a pit, a place
with a legendary home-court advantage.
It's into this gym that the Stanford men's basketball
team will take its hopes for postseason play tomorrow
night, as the teams battle for third or fourth place in the
Pacific 10 Conference.
Stanford and Cal are tied for third place in the Pac-10
with UCLA at 6-5, two games behind leaders Wash
ington and Arizona. Stanford is 12-11 overall, while Cal
is 14-7.
The Bears are 10-1 at Harmon, having won their first
nine before losing last Thursday to Arizona, 61-52. Their
83-61 win last Saturday over Arizona State broke a three
game losing streak.
"What we're looking at now is to try to finish in a
postseason tournament," Stanford Coach Tom Davis said.
"Maybe not win the championship, but to go as one of
those teams. To get into the top three is a key goal, and I
think the winner (tomorrow) could have a share of third."
Davis said he expects at least three Pac-10 teams to
receive berths in either the NCAA or National Invita
tional Tournament.
Harmon Gym is sold out for tomorrow night's
encounter, with all 6,660 seats expected to be filled
largely by Bears partisans hoping to turn the place into a
pit. Stanford students without tickets can see the game on
KICU (Channel 36), beginning at 8 p.m. The game is
being telecast nationally by ESPN.
What that national audience will see is a Stanford team
looking to avenge a 75-69 loss to Cal last month at Maples
Pavilion. That loss seemed to put Stanford out of the Pac
-10 race, but the Cardinal has come back with four wins in
its last five games.
In that game, senior Earl Koberlein tore ligaments in
his right knee midway through the first half in avoiding a
collision under the Cardinal basket. Koberlein underwent
surgery that week and is still walking with crutches with
his knee in a brace.

Center Howard Wright has manned the pivot well for Stanford and is one of the reasons the surprising Card
inal finds itself in the upper half of the Pac-10 entering the homestretch of the conference race.
