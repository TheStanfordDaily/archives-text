# Women remain at Maples to honor seniors

### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
It's not difficult to imagine how badly Stanford seniors
Judy Griffith and Virginia Sourlis want to beat California.
The Cardinal hasn't defeated the Bears since they've
been on The Farm. In fact, Stanford's last victory over Cal
came during the 1980-81 basketball season; Berkeley has
since won seven in a row.
"It's our last chance to beat Cal," Sourlis said. "I want
to beat them."
Appropriately, Monday evening's confrontation against
the Bears has been deemed 'Senior Night at Maples
Pavilion' as the Stanford women's basketball team hopes
to put an end to more than one losing streak.
Not only does Stanford (11-11) want to break the
streak against Cal that spans the last six seasons, but also
to halt a current six-game skid which began with a 77-59
loss to the Bears three weeks ago.
The Cardinal's last victory was Jan. 17 over St. Mary's,
72-71. Since then, Stanford has not only lost to its
nemesis, Cal, but has dropped its first four Pac-West con
ference games.
The Cardinal's slide began in the second half of the Cal
game when the Bears outscored the Cardinal, 45-28,
turning a tight 32-31 struggle into a rout.
Led by senior Chris Metzger, who shot a perfect six-for
six from the field, Cal frazzled the nets during that second
half. The Cardinal, meanwhile, had difficulty adjusting to
the Bears' 3-2 zone, and, as a result, made only 12-of-35
shots from the floor. Stanford can expect the same
amount of pressure on its outside shooting game Monday
night.
As one would have expected in a game against Stan
ford, Cal supporters came out in full force, and, along with
the Cal Band, made their presence felt, especially during
the decisive second stanza. Sourlis knows how a bois
terous crowd can influence the outcome of a game.
"It's easier to win (when the crowd's behind their
team)," she said. "If you're down, the crowd can get you
going.
"It's tough to play away. They (the crowd) scream at
you and say things that you're not used to hearing."
One thing that the Cardinal isn't used to hearing is a
large, boisterous crowd in Maples Pavilion. But that could
change come Monday when the LSJUMB and 500 kazoo
blowing fanatics arrive to pay tribute to the two seniors
and to help send the Bears reeling into a losing streak of
their own.
"It would really make a difference," Griffith said.
"Having the band there and people from your dorm,
that's great. It makes a huge difference. The adrenalin just
naturally flows.
"I feel we're in the process of turning the program
around," Griffith added. "I wish I were a freshman."
