Palm trees, virgin beaehes on a
summer-like afternoon, a refresh
ing sip on a chilly Pina Colada. Put
'em all together and you've got
heaven on earth.
To a college kid who's tucked
away cramming for those lousy
winter quarter midterms, the list of
delights means only one thing —
spring break in Hawaii.
For more than a few Stanford
students, that "not-so-distant
anymorc" week in late March is
reason enough to keep plugging
away. And, boy, will that wait be
worth it. Hawaii, here we come!
For some among us, however,
the waiting's over. A few fortunate
souls are tasting the Hawaiian
Mango right about now. And, get
this, they'll be there living it up un
til Monday. Lucky sops.

In between the sun and the fun,
though, someone thought it would
be neat for them to play a little
game — nine innings worth of a
game.
The game sure ain't Smashßall;
it's baseball, albeit Hawaiian style.
Stanford's baseball team has
made the long trek to Oahu just to
play a three-game weekend series
with the University of Hawaii. Well
worth it, huh?
Today's game at Rainbow
Stadium — that's right, it's Rain
bow as in "Pot of gold at the end of
the. . — starts at 7 p.m. Tomor
row's game is scheduled for the
same time, and Sunday's will start
at 5 p.m. That leaves the mid-after
noon free for the ballplayers to take
advantage of all that Hawaii has to
offer. Hmm.
It won't be all fun for the Stan
ford players, though. The team, 6-2
on the year and ranked 10th in a

prominent national preseason poll,
should have its hands full with the
Hawaii team. The Rainbows
finished 56-31 overall last year and
15-9 in the Western Athletic Con
ference.
Hawaii, ranked 19th by Baseball
America, is 4-1 so far this year,
having beaten Hawaii at Hilo twice
and and taking two of three from
visiting Arizona State last week.
Stanford and Hawaii didn't meet
last year, but in 1984 they played
five games, four in Hawaii and one
in the College World Series West
ern Regional at Tcmpe, Ariz. The
Rainbows won two of the
preseason games and tied another;
at Tempe, Hawaii prevailed 10-7 in
extra innings.
Stanford's Jack McDowell, 2-1
with a 2.70 ERA on the year, will
face leftv Joey Vierra, 2-0 with a
