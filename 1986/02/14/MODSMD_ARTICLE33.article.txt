Interested in witnessing the two best men's gymnastics
team in the nation compete head-to-head? Interesting in
catching tomorrow's Olympians in action today? Inter
ested in getting their autographs while they are still willing
to give them out?
If you answered "Yes" to any or all of these questions
then there is only one place for you to be tomorrow night
at 7:30, and that is Maples Pavilion.
If you go, y.)U will see No. 1-ranked Stanford face No.
2-ranked UCLA in a sequel to the meet in Los Angeles
three weeks ago in which the Cardinal merited their top
ranking by scoring 278.20 points.
According to Stanford gymnasts, every gymnastics
aficionado in the country is looking forward to tomor
row's contest. "All over the nation, they're going to be

watching this meet," freshman Scott Schaffer said.
The meet differs from the teams' first competition in
many ways. "There's more anticipation for this meet,"
sophomore Mike Matzek said. "When we went down
there we were really underdogs."
In addition, the fact that the meet is at Maples will be a
great benefit for the Cardinal. Home judging "is going to
play a big factor." Cardinal Coach Sadao Hamada said.
"And we will not have to adjust to the equipment."
There will also be the revenge factor. "They want (it) in
a big way." Matzek said. "I don't think we're going to give
it to them."
Neither docs Hamada. He believes that Stanford has an
edge in each event. "But I don't know how well UCLA is
prepared. Our preparation is perfect," he said.
One of the reasons that Stanford's preparation is per-
feet is that it had last weekend off,
giving it a chance to improve on the
pommel horse and practice more dif
ficult routines. "If I'm worried about
one event, that's the pommel. We're
misjudging, off-balance," Hamada
said.
The practice has paid off, though.
"Definitely, I see improvement."
No matter what the result is tomor
row night, the meet will include the
finest gymnastics performed in the
nation so far, according to senior
Gary Smith.
"It's going to be amazing," Matzek
said, "no matter who wins or loses.

Competing all-around for Stanford
will be Randy Besosa, Jon Louis and
Chuck Gerardo. As well, Matzek or
Smith may go six events. For the
Bruins, the leaders will be Rob
Campbell, who edged Besosa at
UCLA, and Brian Ginsberg.
Besosa, Louis, Campbell and
Ginsberg are members of the U.S.
National Team. "If you like Olympic
gymnastics, you should be there,"
Hamada said.
Both squads will be close to full
strength for the meet. Cardinal co
captain Mark Arnold is back from his
shoulder injury and Schaffer, though
unable to compete in the floor due to
a tender ankle, will be going in his
best event thus far this season, the
vault.
