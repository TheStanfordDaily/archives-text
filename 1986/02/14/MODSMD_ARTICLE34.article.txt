Coming off a victory over top-ranked Texas last Satur
day, the undefeated Stanford women's swimming team
takes on California tomorrow. The meet begins at noon
and will be held at DeGuerre Pool.
The Cardinal was in top form in defeating Texas, 82-58.
Stanford is currently 6-0 and ranked No. 3 in the nation.
However, as California women's swimming coach Karen
Moe Thornton said, "We figure Stanford will be ranked
No. 1 now after they beat Texas so handily."
In setting six pool records against Texas, Stanford per
formed at its highest level yet this season. Thornton is
wary of the powerful Cardinal.
"Although we think it will be difficult, if not impossible,
to beat Stanford, we are looking forward to swim against
the best, and that should bring out the best in us,"
Thornton said.
The Cardinal is led by senior Kathy Smith and freshman
sensation Jenna Johnson. Smith set pool records in the
100 and 200-yard breaststroke events last week against
Texas, and she set the No. 1 national time in the 100

breaststroke. Johnson, after setting two pool records and
No. 1 times in the nation against Texas, seems to be just
getting into high gear. She has qualified for the NCAAs in
four individual events and four relays.
The California women are currently 6-1 and ranked
No. 4 in the nation. Their only loss came against Texas.
The team is led by Mary T. Meagher and Conny Van Ben
tum, two of the most dominant swimmers in the nation.
Meagher has held world records in the 100 and 200
butterfly events since 1979. She won three gold medals in
the 1984 Olympics, in the 100 and 200 butterfly and the
400 medley relay. Meagher is the defending NCAA
champion in both butterfly events. She won the 1984-85
Broderick Award as the nation's top collegiate swimmer.
Van Bentum, swimming for Holland in the World Uni
versity Games, won the 100 and 200 freestyle events.
Despite an injury during last year's NCAAs, she still
managed to win the 50-yard freestyle and placed third in
the 100 and 200 freestyle. Van Bentum (90) and Meagher
(84) combined to form the second-highest pair of scorers

in last year's NCAA Championships.
After the emotional victory over
Texas, Stanford has to avoid a let
down against Cal.
"I don't imagine we will be as high
as we were for Texas," Stanford

Coach George Haines said. "It will be
an interesting meet. They have some
outstanding individual swimmers, but
I don't think they have the depth to
beat us."
Although tomorrow's meet is im
portant for the national rankings, the
meet is also an opportunity to qualify
more swimmers for the NCA As.
