# No. 7 Tigers to challenge netters
## Stanford to participate in Nor Cal Invitational later in weekend 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Last week, in the calm of the last day of
preseason tennis practice, Stanford Coach Dick
Gould gave a brief outline of the next month.
"Once we get going, we're going to be playing al
most every day,"he said as he thumbed through
the calendar. "Starting with LSU on the 14th, we'll
be playing in three matches and three tournaments
with only one . . . two, three . . . four days of
practice."
Well, it's the 14th, LSU is here, and at 1:30 p.m.
the No. 1-ranked Cardinal begins that hectic
stretch by hosting the No. 7 Tigers at the Varsity
Courts.
And beginnfng tomorrow, Stanford will partici
pate in the NorCal Intercollegiates at Berkeley. In
the past three years, Stanford seniors Jim Grabb,

Dan Goldie and John Letts have each won the
singles championship in that tournament.
First things first, however, and if the rain holds
off, at least six of the top 50 collegiate singles
players in the nation will take the courts this after
noon. The first singles match will probably feature
No. 2-ranked Goldie against LSU's No. 12-ranked
Fernando Perez.
Goldie, who last weekend finished second in the
Rolex National Intercollegiate Indoor Champion
ships, is 2-0 so far in team match play this year.
Goldie defeated 33rd-ranked Bryan Shelton of
Georgia Tech 6-4, 6-3 on Tuesday.
Perez is a senior from Mexico, and he's a rather
large figure in that country. "The Tiger" was the
Mexican Athlete of the Year in 1983 (the successor
to Fernando Valenzuela), has played Davis Cup for
Mexico since 1980 (he'll be facing Boris Becker of
West Germany next month), and was a silver
medalist in both singles and doubles at the 1983

Pan-American Games.
LSU coach Gerry Simmons will also bring 32nd
ranked Billy Uribe. The sophomore fared well last
year at Stanford, defeating Derrick Rostagno 6-4,
6-2.
Stanford may have to play without third-ranked
Grabb, who, according to Gould, is doubtful for
this afternoon due to a nagging injury.
Gould, however, will still have a rather for
midable arsenal to throw at the Tigers. The No. 27,
38, 49 players in the nation, Eric Rosenfeld, Letts,
and Patrick McEnroe respectively will defend their
cumulative 5-0 match record for the Cardinal
today.
Instead of being intimidated by those numbers,
Simmons is excited about playing Stanford.
"We haven't been tested yet this year, so this is a
good way to start," Simmons said yesterday. "We
also play UCLA on Sunday, so we're going to get in
some tough match play."
