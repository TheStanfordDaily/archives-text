# Swimmers go to LA for southern duals
## 
### AMY FRANCETIC Staff writer 
Leaving its sweethearts behind, the
Stanford men's swim team ventured
down to the heart of Los Angeles yes
terday to face off against UCLA this
afternoon and USC tomorrow.
"We're excited," Asst. Coach Ted
Knapp said. "We've got a lot at stake.
UCLA dealt us our last loss, and
they've only lost once at home."
The Cardinal is riding the crest of a
42-meet winning streak. All but six
swimmers will participate this
weekend, as four of the top five teams
in the conference compete against
each other in southern California.
"Terrible" is the cheery adjective
that Bruins Coach Ron Balatore used
to describe the weather conditions
down at the UCLA pool complex this
weekend. Contrastingly, he used
"fantastic" to describe the current
condition of his swimmers.
"We've been working pretty hard
in preparation for this weekend," he
said. "We'd really like to beat Stan
ford. It's been four years since we've
done that."
UCLA has a 6-3 dual meet record
for 1986 season. Two of the Bruins'
outstanding swimmers are freshmen
Craig Oppel in the 200-yard freestyle
and medal distance races and Ron
Kemp in the 200 and 400 IM and
backstroke races. "We did some good
recruiting," said Balatore, "I'm very
pleased."
UCLA also has some returning
Olympians on the team this year.
Senior Tom Jager placed first at the
NCAAs last year in the 50 freestyle
and the 100 backstroke, two events in
which Stanford lacks depth. And Ital

ian Olympian Giovanni Minervini
ranks second globally in the 100
freestyle.
The Stanford swimmers "expect a
well-organized meet from USC Coach
Peter Daland," Knapp said. "USC is
one of our longest running rivalries.
Daland labeled his team "the
Quantity X" in the weekend-long
swim competition.
"We don't know exactly what
we've got nor how we'll do," said
Daland. "Everyone else has had
major meets, but we haven't had a
good meet in three months. I'm going
to close my eyes and hope for the
best."
USC takes on California Friday
before challenging Stanford.
Daland's hope for this year is to finish
third in conference. Last year the
Trojans wound up fifth overall. "The
Pac-10 Championships will give us a
good idea of where we stand in the
conference," he said.
Some of USC's strong points are
Dave Cademartori, a 1985 finalist in
the butterfly, and Kevin Craig, a
member of last summer's U.S. Stu
dent Games team. Like UCLA, USC
is happy with its freshmen. Nicolai
Klapkarek is a world-class back
stroker from West Germany and Li
Hongping is an Olympic diver from
China.
Again, Daland predicts that the
outcome of the meet will depend on
the weather. "If it storms, we'll have
to move indoors to a pool that we
haven't trained in much lately."
But regardless of the weather,
Daland "anticipates great competi
tion. This weekend brings out the
excitement of coaching — that's what
sports are all. about."
