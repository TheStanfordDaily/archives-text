Playing at home for the first time in
over two weeks, the Stanford men's
volleyball team faces 15th-ranked
Loyola Marvmount in Maples
Pavilion tonight at 7:30
Moth teams are coming off of losses
to top-ranked Pepperdine earlier this
week. The Cardinal went down 15-9,
15-5, 15-8, while the Lions were
beaten 15-12, 15-5, 15-5.
Stanford, with a record of 5-2 over
all and 4-2 in California Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association
(CIVA), is No. 4 in the latest national
poll. All-America candidates Chris
Braun and Scott Fortune lead the
team in kills with 95 and 70.
Senior outside hitter Brett Monello
is first on the team in hitting
percentage with a .333 average.
Junior Stephen Blue follows at .326,
and Braun has a .315 hitting
percentage.
The Cardinal may be without the
services of outside hitter Jon Root
again. The senior All-America candi
date went down with an ankle sprain
against Long Beach State a week ago
and might not see action until Sun
day, when the team faces Pepperdine.
Loyola Marymount is 7-4 overall
