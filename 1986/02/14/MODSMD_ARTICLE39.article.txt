### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
Playing at home for the first time in
over two weeks, the Stanford men's
volleyball team faces 15th-ranked
Loyola Marvmount in Maples
Pavilion tonight at 7:30
Moth teams are coming off of losses
to top-ranked Pepperdine earlier this
week. The Cardinal went down 15-9,
15-5, 15-8, while the Lions were
beaten 15-12, 15-5, 15-5.
Stanford, with a record of 5-2 over
all and 4-2 in California Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association
(CIVA), is No. 4 in the latest national
poll. All-America candidates Chris
Braun and Scott Fortune lead the
team in kills with 95 and 70.
Senior outside hitter Brett Monello
is first on the team in hitting
percentage with a .333 average.
Junior Stephen Blue follows at .326,
and Braun has a .315 hitting
percentage.
The Cardinal may be without the
services of outside hitter Jon Root
again. The senior All-America candi
date went down with an ankle sprain
against Long Beach State a week ago
and might not see action until Sun
day, when the team faces Pepperdine.
Loyola Marymount is 7-4 overall
and 0-1 in conference play under
second year coach Kevin Cleary. The
Lions' top players are junior middle
blocker Ole Sorlie of Hulden, Nor
way, who came up with 15 kills
against Pepperdine, and sophomore
middle blocker Henry Bryan, who
totalled 10 kills against the Waves
while hitting for an average of .409.

"Loyola is a balanced team," Stan
ford Co-coach Don Shaw said.
"They're not as physical as some
teams, but they have some talent."
On Sunday, the Cardinal hosts No.
1 Pepperdine. The defending national
champions are 7-0 overall and 4-0 in
the CIVA under first-year coach Rod
Wilde. The squad features two Ail-
Americans, Robb Scott and Matt
Rigg.
Sunday's match against the Waves
begins at 5 p.m.
