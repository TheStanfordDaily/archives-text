# Shell station loses lease
## 
### KENNETH FENYO Staff writer 
Citing low sales and the high cost
of replacing underground gasoline
storage tanks, the Shell Oil Co. has
opted not to renew its lease with
the Campus Shell, a decision that
may force the service station to
close by the end of this month.
But Gary Andrews, who has
operated the station since 1970, has
proposed to continue operations
through a direct lease with the Uni
versity.
A station attendant, who wished
to remain anonymous, said the

Shell standard for normal gasoline
sales volume was 100,000 gallons a
month. Last fall, the company
withdrew from negotiations over
lease terms, according to Zera
Murphy, associate director for
Lands Mangement.
Andrews said the problem was
not that the volume was too low,
but that the Shell did not believe
that the Serra Street station "had
the potential of some other sta
tions."
Other oil companies contacted
by the University were not inter
ested in leasing the land, Murphy
said. "They considered the gal

lonage volume too low," she said.
Murphy said that the University
owns the land and leases it to Shell.
Shell built all improvements, in
cluding the station and the installa
tion of the storage tanks, she said.
When the lease ends, the
improvements will become the
property of the University. If the
University decides not to lease the
land to Andrews, it could request
that Shell remove all improve
ments, Murphy said.
A new state law requires that un
derground storage tanks be double-
contained — one tank inside another— and
constructed of fiberglas, Murphy said. She
added that the tanks had to contain systems
to monitor for gas leaks.
Murphy said Shell will have to remove the
underground storage tanks at the end of the
month. If the University decides to lease the
land to Andrews, he would be required to in
stall new tanks, Murphy said.
Andrews estimated that the cost of install
ing new tanks would exceed $100,000. The
station would continue to operate the ser
vice and repair facilities through the installa
tion period, but no gas would be sold, he
said.
Shell began operating at the Serra Street

location in 1963. Before that, the station
was located next to the Old Firehouse.
In order for the University to lease the
land to Andrews, he must show that he "can
swing it financially and protect them as far
as their liability is concerned," he said.
Whether Andrews can obtain the proper
liability insurance is of primary concern to
the University, Murphy said. The liability
for the University may be greater in the case
of a service station than with other lands be
cause of the presence of volatile materials,
Murphy said.
Murphy said she was not aware if
Andrews had obtained the liability insur
ance, but that she understood that "he was
working on it."
Andrews said he had secured general
liability insurance, adding that his applica
tion fora hazardous material policy was

pending.
The University has sent Andrews a draft
lease, Murphy said. But she stressed that
this did not mean the University had
decided to lease the land to Andrews. "We
cannot go further without letting him see the
document," she said.
Andrews said he was reviewing the draft
lease.
Murphy said the University and Andrews
were still negotiating. "We are continuing
negotiations with him," she said.
Andrews said that he had "high hopes"
that the University will lease the land to
him. "I think that the University thinks it is
a worthwhile facility," he said.
A decision whether to lease the land to
Andrews was to have been made this week.
But because Andrews is now in the hospital,
a final decision has been delayed.
