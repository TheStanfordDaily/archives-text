# Cardinal faltering in Hawaii tourney
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Wednesday's stormy weather
became beautiful yesterday in the
second round of the John Burns Invi
tational in Oahu. Unfortunately, the
Stanford men's golf team did not
make the same adjustment, as it
swooned into a tie for 17th place with
New Mexico.
Actually, Stanford shot 300 as a
team, two strokes better than Wed
nesday's first round, to give it a two
round total of 602. But with condi
tions improved, other teams made
greater gains, and the Cardinal lost
ground.
USC, for example, went from a
first-round 297 to a score of 277 yes
terday to move from a sixth-place tie
with Oklahoma State into a knot with
Fresno State for the tournament lead
at 574.
Oklahoma is in third place with a
total of 577, two strokes ahead of
top-ranked OSU. They were fol
lowed, in order, by Lamar (581),
Arizona State (582), University of
the Pacific (584), Texas-El Paso
(585) and first-round leader Arizona,
which fell into an eighth-place tie
with UTEP by shooting 304 yester
day.
Lamar's Phillip Jonas fired a 67 to
break a tie with UTEP's Rick Todd
and take sole possession of the indi
vidual lead at 136. Todd is currently
one stroke off the pace, with USC's

Sam Randolph in third place at 139.
"It was more or less a perfect day
â€” we just played poorly," Stanford
Coach Tim Schaaf said. "We played
very raggedly. We'll have to do quite
a bit better tomorrow to move up
much at all."
Freshman Roger Miraglia, the fifth
man on Stanford's five-man squad,
continues to surprise by leading the
Cardinal golfers. Miraglia shot 77
yesterday to give him a two-day score
of 149.
Brad Geer chopped a stroke off of
Wednesday's 76 to put him at 151
after two rounds, while Carl Wagner
came back from an opening-round 81
to record a 72 and tie for third on the
team with Rich Marik at 153. Don
Walsworth's 80 left the junior at 157
for the two rounds.
"Nobody is playing very well,"
Schaaf said, "except Roger deserves a
bit of credit. He played very well
most of today but finished off a bit
weakly.
"Carl Wagner played somewhat
better than yesterday,"he said. "I
think Don has not putted well all
week, (but) it still is an awful high
score fora player as good as he is.
"You can't really single any one
player out," Schaaf continued.
"We're just not playing very sharply
as a group. There's not one player on
the team that would say they are
satisfied with how they have been
playing."
