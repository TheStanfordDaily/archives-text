# Four runners head to Millrose Games
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
If you want to be the best,
you've got to compete with the
best. It may sound like a simple
theory, but it's true.
Tonight, four of Stanford's top
distance runners will take part in
one of the country's best track
meets, the Millrose Games.
Held annually in Madison
Square Garden, the Millrose
Games draw over 19,000 fans, an
almost unheard-of amount for
most track meets, but not Millrose.
It is as Stanford Coach Brooks
Johnson said, "the country's
premier indoor meet."
Representing the Cardinal will
be Jeff Atkinson, Brian Conolly,
Christian Skoog and Brian Pettin
gill, who will team up to run the 4
x 800 meter relay.
All four are, as Johnson said,
"capable" runners, but how they'll
fare is still anyone's guess. They
don't have much of the indoor ex
perience which can be vital to in
door success.
As Johnson said, running in
doors "is so close and tight. It
forces you to learn tactics quickly.
"It's kind of like a crap-shoot.
Sometimes it comes up seven and
sometimes it comes up snake
eyes."
Throw in the fact that the 4 x
800 field reads like a preview of

the NCAA championships, and
one can see that the Cardinal will
have its hands full.
But regardless of how the team
places, Johnson thinks it will be a
valuable trip. "It's just a great ex
perience running in front of that
crowd," he said.
The crowd and the meet will
certainly be a thrill for the run
ners, but they'll have to shake it
off fast, because the weekend's
competition does not end with the
Millrose Games before they return
to the West Coast, the Stanford
harriers will enter another impor
tant competition.
Sunday afternoon, Atkinson,
Conolly and Pettingill will run in
the George Mason Invitational,
which is also a big meet. This time,
though, the Cardinal's main op
ponent will be the clock.
To qualify for the NCAA cham
pionships, a runner has to better
what's known as a qualifying stan
dard. On Sunday, the Cardinal
distance men will be looking to do
just that. It may be the trio's last
chance at qualifying for this year's
championships, so they'll be run
ning hard. Again, how well they'll
do is anyone's guess. Johnson
wasn't making any predictions.
He said that all three are
"capable" of it.
Atkinson will be in the 1,500,
Conolly the 800 and Pettingill the
1,000.
