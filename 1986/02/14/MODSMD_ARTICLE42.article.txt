## 
### PETER CASTILLO Staff writer 
If you are planning to take your valentine out tonight,
what could be more romantic than the two of you going to
see a wrestling meet? You have the chance for that dream
date as Stanford hosts San Jose State tonight at 6 in
Maples Pavilion, in the season finale.
Stanford brings in a 5-8-1 record, while San Jose is 2-9.
It is a pretty even match and could go either way. We
match up fairly well, but I'll have to juggle the lineup to
put out a full team," Stanford Coach Chris Horpel said.
"To win the meet, the wrestlers will have to win the close
matches.
Neil Wartnik is still out at 126 pounds and taking his
place is David Bishko. Horpel is going to weigh in both
Eric Harber and Dave Lee at 167 pounds and Terry
Mclntyre and Kurt Kassuike at 190 pounds. This gives
Horpel the flexibity to change his lineup if the situation
warrants.
Lee will most likely compete at 177 pounds, unless Jack
Norton, one of the Spartans' star wrestlers, competes at
167 pounds. If SJSU brings its bigger heavyweight, Hor
pel will forfeit heavyweight and Kassuike will move down

to 190 pounds.
The flu has been going through the Stanford team, and
Horpel said he is worried that some of his wrestlers might
not have fully recovered yet.
The Spartans' strength is in the lower weight classes, so
the third match of the evening, at 134 pounds, between
the Cardinal's Jeff Bradley and SJSU's Joe Zamlich will
be pivotal if Stanford expects to win.
The Cardinal will have the advantage in the upper
weights as the Spartans are weak in the heavier classes.
"Stanford has been a really tough team this year. It is
hard to judge this meet because it is a strange matchup,"
SJSU Coach Dan Kida said. "Horpel has done an excel
lent job of bringing the program to where it is now."
Horpel said he feels that the team is progressing fine, as
the wrestlers are pushing themselves hard with the season
nearing an end. After Friday's meet, Horpel is giving the
team three days off to recuperate and to prevent the
wrestlers from burning out after a long regular season
with few off-days
This will be the last home meet for seniors Jeff Bradley,
Neil Wartnik, Pete Rogers and Jeff Hazard.
Horpel said he is hoping fora large fan turnout to give
the Cardinal a home court advantage.
