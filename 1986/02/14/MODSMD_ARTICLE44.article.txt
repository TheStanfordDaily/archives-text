US to offer new arms proposal
GENEVA — New U.S. proposals to join the Soviet Union in elimin
ating all intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe, from the Atlan
tic Ocean to the Ural Mountains, will be formally presented here next
week in the nuclear arms talks, U.S. sources said yesterday.
Final details of the new American position will be decided by Presi
dent Reagan after he meets with his two senior arms control advisors,
Paul Nitze and Edward Rowny, who have returned to Washington after
briefing the European allies and Japan on the planned U.S. move.
The U.S. response to an offer, made publicly by Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, to eliminate medium-range missiles in Europe will probably
be presented by Max Kampelman, the chief U.S. negotiator in Geneva,
at a plenary meeting of the two sides yesterday, the sources said.
According to sources here, the response of the European allies to U.S.
plan has been "very solid" in support of what amounts to a return to the
"zero option" proposal on missiles in Europe that the Reagan Admini
stration offered four years ago. At that time, the United States told the
Soviet Union that it was prepared to suspend plans to introduce new
missiles into Europe if the Kremlin would scrap the SS-20 missiles it had
already begun to deploy against Western Europe. The Soviets rejected
that proposal.
In Japan, however, Rowny found strong concern about deployment of
SS-20 missiles in Asia. Sources here say that the Chinese government
has also told Washington that it wants to see a curtailment of missile
deployment in Asia if there is any agreement to scrap the missiles in
Europe.
At a minimum, therefore, the United States is expected to insist in its
new proposals on a 50 percent reduction in Soviet missiles targeted on
Japan and China. The Americans are also expected to reject any Soviet
demand fora reduction in the existing independent nuclear forces of
Britain and France.
Dissatisfaction dawns in Haiti
CAP HAITIEN, Haiti — Jubilation over the fall of a hated dictator
increasingly is shifting toward uncertainty and restiveness among many
Haitian youths upset about the military-dominated provisional govern
ment that has replaced him.
The dissatisfaction, voiced in demonstrations and conversations, arises
from the presence in the new government of military officers and politi
cal figures identified with the former Duvalier regime and a feeling that
change has not come as dramatically or swiftly as expected.
"Duvalier is gone, but the spirit of Duvalierism remains," says a tract
circulating here demanding the departure of a half-dozen ministers and
military officers. "They are the lackeys of foreigners who have been
sucking the country dry."
Although still taking shape, the sense of disappointment appears to be
growing, raising a threat of more street violence such as the protests here
and in other Haitian cities that drove Jean Claude Duvalier from power
last Friday and ended two generations of family dictatorship.
"The situation is still very volatile," said a foreign diplomat in the cap
ital, Port-au-Prince.
In Talloires, France, Duvalier announced yesterday that he had filed a
formal request for political refugee status that would allow him and his
family to remain in France permanently. Duvalier, who has been in the
Alpine resort town with his entourage since his flight from Haiti last
Friday, was officially only on a transit stop in France.
Four Poles endure hunger strike
WARSAW, Poland — The Solidarity underground has appealed to
Western human rights groups to publicize the plight of four imprisoned
activists who have been on hunger strikes for more than 100 days.
Three of the activists have refused to take nourishment since October
and the fourth since November, according to the latest issue of Warsaw's
main underground bulletin, Tygodnik Mazowsze. All are said to have
been kept alive by force-feeding.
The four men, jailed on charges ranging from illegal publishing to at
tempting to overthrow the state, are "demanding humanitarian treat
ment" for themselves and other Polish political prisoners, including the
right to visits by family members, the weekly bulletin said.
It appealed for Western pressure on the Polish government to transfer
the hunger strikers from Rakowiecka Prison in central Warsaw to a civil
ian hospital for intensive therapy.
The Polish government has acknowledged only that one of the
prisoners is on a hunger strike. In response to questions, government
spokesman Jerzy Urban said last week that Czeslaw Bielecki, 38, an ar
chitect and writer, is being "force-fed and is under constant medical
care."
Chemical arms used in gulf war?
TEHRAN, Iran — Iran said yesterday its forces had seized a total of
434 square miles in oil-rich southern Iraq as neighboring Arab nations
called on the U.N. Security Council to schedule an emergency meeting
on the gulf situation and on reports that chemical weapons were being
used.
A new communique by Iran on its 4-day-old invasion said the Iranians
had "smashed" elite Iraqi battalions and were steadily advancing on the
road to Basra, Iraq's second-largest city. It said 32-square miles were
captured yesterday.
The state-run Iraqi news agency said missiles, artillery and air force
planes were forcing Iran to retreat under intense bombardment.
The news agency quoted a military spokesman as saying that Iraqi
warplanes had attacked the airport of Ahvaz, about 75 miles northeast
of Basra, damaging several military transport planes on the ground.
Other Iraqi aircraft bombed the Iranian oil export terminal at Kharg
Island and the adjacent pipeline networks at Ganaveh.
Iran invited foreign correspondents t6 visit the port city of A1 Faw
near the Kuwaiti border, Iraq's only outlet to the gulf, which Iran seized
earlier this week.
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati informed U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar that Iraq was using chemical
weapons and warned that Iran would do the same unless "firm action is
taken within the next few days."
Iran said that in some cases Iraq had used chemical weapons on their
own forces by mistake.
For its part, Iraq accused Iran of using chemical weapons, but no inde
pendent confrontation of either side's assertion was possible.
Greeks strike against pay freeze
ATHENS, Greece — More than 100,000 workers walked off their
jobs yesterday in protest of government austerity measures freezing pay
until the end of 1987.
The construction industry, public transportation and health services
were affected by the strike.
Bus services ground to a halt as 1,500 drivers struck for six hours.
Some 6,000 doctors employed by the state health insurance system
also planned to stay away from work for five days.
France promises weapons to Chad
PARIS — France announced yesterday that it will step up arms ship
ments to its former African colony of Chad following a new offensive by
Libyan-backed rebels against government-held positions.
The Chadian Embassy in Paris announced last night that "Libyan
troops" had attacked a government outpost at Ziguey, south of the 15th
parallel and less than 200 miles from the capital. The report could not be
immediately confirmed.
