# Marcos ahead in Assembly count
## 
### 
MANILA, Philippines — Amid opposition
charges that official, final election returns from
entire provinces and vast districts of Manila are
fraudulent, President Ferdinand Marcos took a
strong lead yesterday in the final tallying of last
week's still-unresolved presidential election by the
Marcos-controlled National Assembly.
With more than half the popular vote tabulated
when the assembly adjourned until later today,
Marcos led challenger Corazon Aquino by 759,000
votes, and the president's parliamentary lieutenant
said that Marcos' supporters expect the president
to be proclaimed winner in "two to three days."
Philippine Assembly Speaker Nicanor Yniguez,
who also served as Marcos' national campaign
manager, made it clear on the assembly floor yes
terday that a proclamation would be made despite
dozens of opposition challenges to the legitimacy of
apparently adulterated official provincial and
municipal vote totals from Marcos strongholds that
together represent millions of votes for the presi
dent.
But Aquino, who has proclaimed herself the vic
tor in the election based on independent tallies that

show her in the lead, declared yesterday that such a
proclamation "would not convince the people" of
Marcos' mandate. And the 53-year-old political
novice called on the president to abdicate and
move out of his posh presidential palace, a sprawl
ing complex many Filipinos see as a symbol of
Marcos' 20 years in power, until "this matter is
settled ... by a wider political exercise."
Only such a resignation, she said, would break
the national anxiety over who won an election held
seven days ago and diffuse some of the swelling po
litical anger in our country," she said, adding that
she "will strain my every nerve to ensure that our
political crisis is resolved without much violence."
Aquino's statement, a toned-down version of
earlier declarations, which indicated that she might
claim her victory in the streets during daily
demonstrations, was seen by many here as an an
swer to President Reagan, who has asked Aquino
and Marcos to work together to peacefully resolve
the current political crisis.
Post-election violence continued yesterday.
Aquino's headquarters announced three additions
to its list of 20 election-related murders since Feb.

6, election eve, almost all of the victims opposition
supporters.
Meanwhile, in Washington, Congress began to
react more strongly to the possibility of Marcos
confirmation. Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, ranking
Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Commit
tee, declared yesterday that "the Philippine people
want President Marcos out and they have elected
Corazon Aquino," and he asked Reagan in a letter
to declare that U.S. aid will end if the will of that
nation's voters is thwarted through fraud.
Nunn's letter, with new statements by Senate
Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Richard
G. Lugar (R-Ind.), added to growing pressure on
Reagan to modify the "hands-off posture that the
White House has taken this week toward fraud in
the Philippine balloting.
Comments by officials with the presidential party
in California, where Reagan is on vacation, sugges
ted the White House stance may have begun to
shift. Sources there said special White House emis
sary Philip Habib will convey to Marcos in private
conversation U.S. "displeasure and disappoint
ment" with the way the elections were conducted.
