# lacocca blasts Interior proposal

### 
WASHINGTON — Chrysler
Corp. Chairman Lee lacocca angrily
declared yesterday that Interior Sec
retary Donald Hodel's abrupt deci
sion to remove him from a commis
sion directing the renovation of the
Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island
"borders on the un-American."
lacocca said he will remain as head
of a separate private foundation that
has raised more than $233 million for
the restoration, and he vowed to bat
tle what he called an Administration
backed proposal to "commercialize"
Ellis Island with a hotel and conven
tion center. The development would
be subsidized by historic-preservation
tax credits, which lacocca called "the
sale of tax shelters to the rich."
"That's not part of the deal we
made with the American people,"
lacocca said. "I said early on, 'over
my dead body.' So now I'm dead."
Hodel announced lacocca's firing
at a hastily called news conference
Wednesday, saying that he had acted
to prevent "potential conflicts of in
terest" between lacocca's dual role as
chairman of the private foundation
and of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Is
land Centennial Commission. The

foundation's role is to raise money,
and the commission is to advise the
Interior Department on how to spend
the money.
Yesterday, in a Detroit news con
ference originally scheduled io dis
cuss Chrysler's fiscal fortunes,
lacocca dismissed both Hodel's argu
ment and reports that the firing was
politically motivated or stemmed
from his well-known differences with
White House chief of staff Donald
Regan.
"I'll be charitable," he said. "If it is
just politics — well, boys will be
boys."
In California, White House spokes
man Larry Speakes also denied that
Regan had anything to do with the
dismissal. "Regan was in Florida and
didn't know anything about it,"he
said.
lacocca also denied that he in
tended to use the Statue of Liberty
centennial celebration next year as a
staging ground for his political ambi
tions, a possibility that Administration
officials said was of concern to Vice
President George Bush.
"I'm not running for anything but
my life," lacocca said.
The "cruncher" that led to the dis

missal, according to lacocca, was his
opposition to the Administration's
plan to "privatize" more than two
thirds of Ellis Island under a proposal
that calls fora luxury hotel and con
vention facilities cheek-by-jowl with
the historic New York landing spot
where millions of immigrants, includ
ing lacocca's Italian parents, flocked
to American shores.
lacocca said he would "do every
thing in my power" as foundation
chairman to fight the proposal. "I am
not about to meekly surrender some
$250 (million to) $300 million to the
National Park Service to do with as it
will," he said. "We will only get to
redo Ellis Island and the statue one
time in our history, and we must do it
right."
A senior park official confirmed
yesterday that the park service
favored an "adaptive use" proposal
that would involve a convention cen
ter and hotel on the 23-acre island.
He said the park service wanted to
restrict restoration of the immigrant
facilities to the largest of more than
two dozen buildings, the "Grand
Hall" where immigrants awaited
word on whether they would be

allowed entry into the United States.
"Our position has been that res
toration of the principal building to il
lustrate the story of Ellis Island is suf
ficient," the official said. "If we had
our way, we'd just let the rest of the
buildings fizzle."
According to the park service,
however, lacocca has a similarly
grand commercial scheme in mind for
Ellis Island — an "ethnic village" that
would be patterned after Colonial
Williamsburg. "An ethnic Dis
neyland, we call it,"the official said.
lacocca referred to the Ellis Island
controversy as a "four-year running
battle" with the park service. None
theless, the hotel proposal apparently
came as a surprise to other Interior
Department officials.
"We were surprised to learn that
they (park-service officials) were so
euphoric over the dismissal," said one
senior department official. "I guess I
can understand his outrage."
Outrage poured from other quar
ters as well. Chrysler officials said
telephone lines at the company's
Highland Park, Mich., headquarters
were jammed with calls protesting
lacocca's firing.
