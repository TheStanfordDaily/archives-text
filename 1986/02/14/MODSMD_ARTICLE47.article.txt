House PAC funds rise
WASHINGTON — Continuing a spiral of in
creasingly expensive campaigns, House members
gearing up for this year's elections received an
average of $118,607 each in 1985, up 44 percent
from 1983, the previous nonelection year, ac
cording to an analysis released today by Common
Cause.
Contributions from political action committees
grew even more sharply, rising 54 percent to an
average $47,653 per congressman, the self-styled
citizens lobby reported.
House incumbents in recent years have tried to
fill their campaign chests earlier in the election
season in hopes that a show of financial strength
will discourage potential rivals.
Poll shows differences
WASHINGTON — The American people dif
fer sharply with President Reagan's proposed
spending priorities for fiscal 1987, with a
majority favoring cuts in the Defense Depart
ment and nearly two-thirds opposing cuts in so
cial programs, according to a Washington Post-

ABC News national opinion poll.
The poll showed that by 68 percent to 30 per
cent, however, the public agrees with the presi
dent that taxes should not be raised to reduce the
federal budget deficit.
They also appear to have a favorable impres
sion of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. By 63
percent to 27 percent, the American people give
him a favorable rating. By 60 percent to 32 per
cent, they say they think Gorbachev is serious
about making progress on arms control, and by
74 percent to 22 percent, they say they favor his
proposal to eliminate all nuclear weapons by the
year 2000.
Terrorists are no threat
WASHINGTON — FBI Director William
Webster said yesterday that the only way terror
ists could "destabilize" the United States "is if
we panic ourselves into taking extraordinarily
repressive measures against a problem that is at
present being fully addressed.
"I know there is a potential for great pressure
to bend the rules and do what's necessary" to
prevent terrorism outbreaks in the United States,

Webster said at breakfast with the Los Angeles
Times' Washington bureau. "We have to keep
reminding ourselves that the terrorist wins
whenever the terrorist succeeds in busting up a
system in a free society.
"It's hard for me to say it isn't coming next
month, because it might," he said. "But on the
basis of the evidence we have, we believe that we
are dealing with the problem appropriately, and
... certainly are not panicked by what's taking
place at the present time."
Webster also disputed the suggestion, heard
both at the White House and in Congress, that
terrorists and drug traffickers have joined forces
to undermine the United States
Market climbs higher
NEW YORK — After meandering for much of
the day, stock prices charged higher late yester
day, boosted by buying programs and optimism
that the stock market's historic rally still has
plenty of steam.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose
15.14 to 1,645.07, breaking the record close of
1,629.93 set in the previous session.
