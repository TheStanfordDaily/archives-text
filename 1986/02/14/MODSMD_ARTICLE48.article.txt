16th victim found in LA
LOS ANGELES — A task force investigating
a series of prostitute murders in the southern part
of the city said yesterday a possible 16th victim
was found, 25 miles away from where most of the
other bodies were dumped.
"We're now faced with possibility that . . . the
suspect from downtown Los Angeles is operating
in the extreme eastern portion of the county,"
said Los Angeles police Lt. John Zorn.
The partially clothed body of Lorna Patricia
Reed, 35, was found Tuesday afternoon in brush
at Bonelli Regional Park, which surrounds Pud
dingstone Reservoir.
An autopsy determined she had been stran
gled, which is consistent with previous killings,
said sheriffs Lt. Gary Vance. Like other victims
she was black and had a history of prostitution.
The time of death was not clear because of cold
temperatures which complicated the usual es
timating procedures, Vance said. The killing may
have occurred late Monday or early Tuesday, he
said.
An anonymous caller who told Pomona police
where to find the body was probably a jogger or
someone walking their dog, Vance said.
"The biggest dissimilarity is we're dealing with

a crime scene that is 25 miles from the area that
we've been dealing with," said Zorn, Vance's
counterpart from the Los Angeles Police Depart
ment's side of the task force.
Investigators were still trying to determine
Reed's whereabouts before the discovery of her
body.
The series of killings of prostitutes believed
slain by the same person dates back to September
1983.
Toxics plans unveiled
SACRAMENTO — Seven toxic waste bills
with industry and environmentalist backing were
unveiled yesterday to encourage new disposal
methods for dangerous chemicals.
The bills, said Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, should
"stop dumping, encourage environmentally safe
treatment technology and rebuild public confi
dence."
The bills, which have bipartisan backing, are
the recommendations of a toxics study conducted
by the Commission for Economic Development,
which the Democratic lieutenant governor chairs.
McCarthy said he hopes, through his bipartisan
and industry-environmentaiist support, to get the

bills passed without involving them in the politi
cal squabble between Democratic lawmakers and
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian over how
the state's toxic agencies should be organized.
"That's the only way we're going to have any
success, given the current atmosphere in
Sacramento," he said.
McCarthy said 50,000 firms in California "use
a lot of chemicals," 5,000 of those large compan
ies. Those firms will have to find new ways to
dispose of their toxic byproducts, because federal
and state law will soon forbid disposal of un
treated waste in landfills.
"Landfills are a dead issue. Landfills are the
dinosaurs of an earlier technological age.
Landfills cannot serve the people any more. They
are not safe. So we must use the technological
brains we have in the private sector," McCarthy
said.
Today's weather
Expect heavy rains throughout the peninsula
today and tonight, with possible flash floods in
some areas and killer squid attacking passing
motorists. Temperatures will be in the mid-60s
with lows in the mid-50s.
