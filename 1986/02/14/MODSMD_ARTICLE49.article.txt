While the memory of "Qf UCHI
originally kepi me on a fejjjK
NOTHING could cool our summer heat
in Newport Beach.
From the ky snow ofTahoe,
to the darkened heck of a limo,
From soothing backrubs,
to steamy hetWubs,
pSfromfinding the Mustang in tow,
to saving every floral bow,
From "dancing in the dark"
in Son Francisco,
to sharing Russian wine-and more
at the Monte Crista,
AND, from tearfully viewing
"Courageous" virtually "fenderless,"
we have never lost that special
"TENDERNESS."
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY, 1986.
