# Happy Valentine's daydreaming
## 
### KELLY SUND Staff writer 
"If you were Cupid and could match up anyone in
the world, who would you unite?"
"What would be the perfect Valentine's Day gift for
you?"
"If you were to be a piece of Valentine's Day candy,
what kind of candy would you be?"

Feature

Pedestrians in White Plaza who had the chance to
answer these questions yesterday mostly paired
celebrities, hoped for flowers and trips and often chose
to be chocolate or heart-shaped candies.
The standard answers were exemplified by sopho
more Sue Anderson, whose ideal gift would exist if
"the man of my dreams came to my door bearing arm
fuls of red roses and announced that he was taking me
on a two-week cruise in the Caribbean."
Anderson paired herself with Aidan Quinn, and
thought that she would be a cinnamon heart.
Despite this general trend in response, some answers
stood out.
Paula Murray, a graphic designer here at Stanford
who said that Jessica Lange has "a continual thing of
having babies by great men," decided to give Lange a
chance at actor Kevin Kline.
Murray thought that her perfect Valentine's Day gift
would be a new VCR to replace the one that was
recently stolen from her.
As for candy, Murray said that she would be a
gummy bear.
A similar sentiment was echoed by sophomore Jose
Macias, who, after much consideration, said he would
be a gummy penguin.
Marias continued that his perfect
Valentine's Day gift would be a half-
Columbian, half-Venezuelan girl with
brown hair and green eyes.
Sophomore Sonia Chalfin said she
would be happy to receive a box of
red hots. Predictably, Chalfin also
said she would be a box of red-hots.
Eric Best, who was just on campus
to eat at Tresidder, had unique
reasoning behind his common answer
that he would be chocolate.
"I don't eat candy," said Best, "but
chocolate, because I used to be a
chocoholic."
Best, who had just seen "Out of
Africa," paired Robert Redford with
Meryl Streep.
Sophomore Julie Becker gave the

romantic response that the perfect
Valentine's Day gift for her would be
one red rose. Becker went on to
match her sister with one of the men
in Phi Sig.
Senior Elizabeth Klainer, who
hoped to win a trip to Hawaii with the
man of her dreams at the Toyon

suitcase party as her Valentine's Day
gift, matched up Jerry Falwell and
Anita Bryant.
Sophomore Ashley Knief paired
Mr. and Mrs. Universe.
Knief also said that if she was a
piece of candy, she would be "a choc

olate orange."
Aristotle Scoledes, a wandering
Democratic candidate for the United
States Senate, said that the best
Valentine's Day gift for him would be
good health for all the members of his
family.
Freshman Greg DeForest said that
if he were to be Valentine's Day
candy, he would be one of the candy
hearts with messages on them.
DeForest generously paired one of
his male friends with the girl of his
dreams.
Bill Bencze, who matched Ronald
Reagan with Jane Fonda, gave the
sleepiest Valentine's wish.
Bencze wished for "guaranteed
quiet at 10 p.m. so I could go to sleep
early."
