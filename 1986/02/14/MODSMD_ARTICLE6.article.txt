# Coffee House group meets

### MARCUS MABRY 
The Coffee House Task Force met
for the first time this week to develop
plans for future student involvement
in the restaurant, prompting an
ASSU official to charge that the
group is a "placebo" to subdue stu
dent criticism of the Saga Corp.-run
enterprise.
The ASSU withdrew all support
from the task force in January when it
became clear the group would be an
ineffectual device to keep students
from realizing they no longer have
significant control over the Coffee
House, according to Council of Presi
dents member Leslie Leland.
"Ostensibly, it looks like a great

opportunity for students (to stay in
volved with the Coffee House), but it
really would be using students be
cause their input would not be
valued," she said.
But Nanci Howe, the Tresidder as
sistant director charged with forming
the task force, said the ASSU's
charges are unfounded.
"The committee will get whatever
information it needs for it to have an
impact," she said. "Nowhere has it
been said that it will not get any infor
mation from the contract, if needed."
Tresidder management last sum
mer proposed establishing a task
force to look into the possible con
tinuation of student participation in
Coffee House management after the

student-run Coffee House, Inc. lost
its bid to Saga. Tresidder maintained
that it still valued student input and
began meeting with ASSU members
during the summer to discuss forming
a task force.
When completed, the task force's
proposals will be presented to Tresid
der Union officials and the Office of
the Dean of Student Affairs. The
nine-member task force consists of
six students and three administrators.
The student participants are not cur
rently active in the ASSU, and none
were approved by the senate.
According to Tresidder's original
draft proposal for the organization,
