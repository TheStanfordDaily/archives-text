# Storm strikes Farm
## Damage to student residences, flooding reported 
### STEVE STREED Staff writer 
The largest Bay Area storm in nearly three years roared
through Stanford this weekend, breaking windows and
causing minor flood damage to several student residences.
Reports of storm-related problems came into the Stan
ford Dispatch Center throughout the weekend, including
flooding of San Francisquito Creek near the Stanford
Credit Union, several broken fire hydrants in different
areas of the University, failed water pressure in Escon
dido Village, a backed-up sewage system in Tresidder Un
ion, power surges, broken lights, false alarms and stuck
elevators, according to Susan Arsenault, lead operator of
Facility Services.
The storm, which is expected to continue through
today, has already dumped more than three inches of rain
on the Peninsula in the past week, prompting the National
Weather Service to issue a flash flood warning on Sunday
for all Bay Area counties except San Francisco.
Water leaked into a third-floor room of Roth House,
and some plaster fell into the room as a result of high
winds backing rainwater against a solar panel support on
the house's sundeck, said Lucy Williams, the facilities
manager of Row and Cluster houses. She added that the
problem was solved by drilling a hole through the support
and letting the standing water drain out into the gutter.
Williams mentioned other leaks in the hallway of Roth
and in a second-floor resident's room.
Joan Petersen, a Roth resident whose third-floor room
is directly under the Roth House sundeck, said she was
sitting in her room when a one-and-a-half-foot piece of
plaster fell from the roof and water started to leak on her
roommate's head.
Petersen's roommate was not available for comment
yesterday.
Petersen said a sloping roof above a third-floor room

was buckling from rain and wind this weekend until a Uni
versity facilities worker placed a plank beneath the
stressed point.
Williams said there is no danger of the Roth House roof
caving in because the house has a tile-roof construction.
Fred Millard, trades and crafts supervisor of Under
graduate Housing, said some undergraduate residences
have been suffering from the storm because "draining
would not take the water away fast enough and drains
backed up and caused some flooding in Wilbur and Stern
. . . (and) some drain lids popped off."
"We had people from Roto-Rooter (clearing out the
sewage system) at Donner House until 12:30 p.m. Friday
night," Millard said. The wind also caused several win
dows to break in Madera House, he said.
Incoming water damaged the Row facility storage room
in the basement of Phi Psi House over the weekend, and a
tree fell down yesterday in front of the driveway at 558
Mayfield, Williams said.
Mike Mussen, house manager at Kairos, said gusts blew
a skylight off of the Kairos roof on Friday, creating a small
hole over the stairway through which some water leaked.
Workers from Row Housing Facilities placed a temporary
cover against the hole, he said.
The wind also broke several windows in Kairos by bang
ing them against their frames, Mussen said.
Ellie Oppenheim, the associate dean and director of
Tresidder Union, said collapsed pipes near the Tresidder
patio caused some rainwater to back up into the union's
kitchen this weekend.
However, Oppenheim said she did not know whether a
Tresidder sewer had backed up.
On Friday, heavy winds destroyed the shantytown in
White Plaza only a day after it had been rebuilt by mem
bers of Stanford Out of South Africa. The shantytown had
been vandalized Feb. 9 and reconstructed with more
heavy-duty materials, including a metal roof.
