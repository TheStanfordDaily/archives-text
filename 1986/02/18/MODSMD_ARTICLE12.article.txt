# Afghanistan fight taken out of 'regional context,' says prof.
## 
### DANA HAIGHT 
Current Soviet involvement in Afghanistan must be un
derstood in its regional context as the outcome of domes
tic politics, a professor from the Naval Postgraduate
School in Monterey said here last night.
In a speech in the Cardenal lounge, Ralph Magnus de
scribed the current unrest in Afghanistan as a "symptom of
a much larger chain of events."
Magnus described Afghanistan in the early 1960s as "a
nice, peaceful, progressive sort of area" with a "liberal
political system" for the region. Both the United States
and the Soviet Union were providing aid to the nation, he
said, but competition in Afghanistan was a "non-issue" of
the Cold War.
According to Magnus, "politically, economically and
militarily, the Afghans were independent but under the
influence of' the Soviet Union. Relations were healthy
enough for the Soviets to use Afghanistan through the
early 1970s as an "example to the entire Third World" of
its magnanimity in providing aid with no strings attached.
The departure of the British from the Persian Gulf and
the Indo-Pakistan War of the early 1970s dramatically al
tered the makeup of the region and forced the Soviets to
re-evaluate their policy in Afghanistan, Magnus said. The
Soviets decided to use Afghanistan as a "stepping stone to
take advantage of any problems" in the region, he added.
But subsequent peace overtures between Afghanistan
and its neighbors minimized opportunities for Soviet in

tervention in the region.
Consequently, the Soviets directed the Afghan Com
munist Party, reunited after a 10-year split, to fulfill its
job "to stage a coup," he said. The Soviets' invasion in
December 1979 was strictly designed to "shore up a col
lapsing goverment that they, of course, had originally in
stalled," he added.
Magnus expressed doubt that the Soviets possess the
"long-staying power" they claim to have in Afghanistan,
adding that the political costs of occupying the country for
years to come cannot justify the potential gains.
He said the increasingly vocal disapproval of the United
States, China and the Islamic states has changed the char
acter of the war in the past year. The Soviets' continued
presence in Afghanistan "expresses the hollowness of
their claims" of good will toward Third World nations, he
said.
In addition, the tenacity of the rebel Mujahidin forces
has inspired the United States and other nations to gal
vanize their verbal commitments with increased financial
support, Magnus said.
The United Nations could assist the rebel cause by
helping to legitimize the Mujahidin regime. Magnus said.
Options include granting the rebels observer status in the
United Nations, which would allow their representatives
to attend U.N. meetings without voting, or possibly at
tempting to expel the Soviet-backed Kabul government
from the U.N. General Assembly.
