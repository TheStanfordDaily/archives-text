The Council of Presidents' recent call to give the re
sponsibility for reviewing the Policy on Campus Dis
ruption (PCD) to the Honor Code Commission (HCC)
makes good sense.
Given the confusion concerning where each arm of
the University's judicial procedure begins and ends, an
initiative that seeks to educate students about Stan
ford's disciplinary policies is an effort whose time has
come.
Established in 1967 — a time of great student unrest
on the campus — the PCD is a code that governs the
conduct of students, staff and faculty in rallies and
demonstrations.
Under the PCD, student demonstrators could con
ceivably be suspended for not leaving "a University
building or facility when asked to do so ... by a mem
ber of the University community acting in an official
role and identifying himself as such." In other words,
participation in campus sit-ins could be just cause for
University judicial action.
While most students have a limited understanding of
the Fundamental Standard, and the Honor Code can
be found on any blue exam booklet, the PCD and its
possible applications are wrapped in relative obscurity.
It was not implemented against anti-apartheid

protesters in October, but uncertainty surrounds the
question of whether the PCD will or will not be
invoked in the future.
As an educational body, the HCC would be well
suited to explain the PCD to students. Established in
1976 by University President Richard Lyman, the
HCC was designed to combat widespread ignorance
about the Honor Code, and it could now do the same
for the PCD.
Granted, the HCC is merely an advisory body — it
would not be able to change the PCD directly, or make
decisions concerning disciplinary actions. But it could
stimulate debate on the PCD, and more importantly, it
could spread understanding about the policy.
In its meeting last month, the HCC discussed ways of
informing students about the code, suggesting an intro
duction to the code at orientation, during dorm
meetings or in private meetings with advisers.
Why not extend this education to include the PCD?
Considering the revived presence of student protest
here at Stanford, it is important that students under
stand the full ramifications of their actions.
If a group such as the HCC is willing to put the time
and energy into studying and reviewing the PCD, then
it should have the opportunity to do so.
