Shcharansky case
merits attention
Most letters on your editorial pages
are written in response to columns,
editorials, or articles in The Daily. I,
however, am writing in response to
the lack of an editorial which, I
believe, should have been included.
The recent release of Soviet Jewish
dissident Anatoly Shcharansky is a
clear victory for human rights. Yet,
when I tell my fellow students that
Shcharansky is free, they reply,
"Shcharansky who?" The Daily,
through its editorial page, has spoken
out against infringement upon human
rights in Central America and, espe
cially, in South Africa. Why, then,
when a triumph is achieved, does The
Daily not acknowledge the event as
such?
Can it be that some people are
"more oppressed" than others? If
student awareness of injustice is im
portant, why, then, does this prime
example not receive proper atten
tion?
The theory of gatekeeping — the
subjective selection of what is news
by the media who report it — is
clearly at work here. When we agree
to fight injustice, we should do it
wholeheartedly, not selectively. That
Jews in the Soviet Union are not per
mitted to emigrate to Israel is impor
tant; that Nelson Mandela may not
return home is important; that El Sal
vadorian peasants are repressed by
the national guard is important. But
none of these events can be consid
ered "more important" than the
others in the quest for human rights.
Anatoly Shcharansky is a symbol of
suffering everywhere. Although the

symbol has been released, the cause
still remains. It should be the respon
sibility of The Daily to inform stu
dents of the injustice of Soviet Jewry
along with its editorial coverage of
other, equally unjust practices in the
world.

I would like to respond to Lome
Needle's viewpoint ("Idealists must
retain convictions," The Daily, Feb.
6) in which he asks how to have con
victions in a troubled world. I don't
pretend to have the answers, but
rather some thoughts on a different
way $9 approach the issue.
Man is imperfect, and thus every
thing man does is necessarily imper
fect. Any attempt to make humanity
the answer to all problems will ulti
mately fail. The problems in life force
us to look outside ourselves, because
we cannot deal with them by our
selves. They force us to look to God,
because if mankind could solve all its
own problems there would be no
need for God.
Needle contradicts himself when he
writes "there is no force of good in
the world" and"it is the duty of every
human to improve the lot of his fel
lows." Carried to its logical conclu
sion, it is not the duty of every man to
improve the lot of his fellows if there
is no force of good in the world, for
what then is the reason? Gilbert
Chesterton said, "When man ceases
to worship God, he does not worship
nothing, he worships anything." Man
is confused because he has convic
tions but nothing to base them on.

Basing ideas on mankind subjects one
to a capricious, impermanent world,
one which shifts with the weather or
the stock market. But there is a force
of good in the world, God.
It is by adding God to the equation,
and looking outside of oneself, that
man can strive for good. There is no
way for a self-centered humanity to
advance. But the "richer, nobler ex
perience" allows one to retain convic
tions and ideas — ones based on God,
not man.
In making this idea more prag
matic, it is important to remember
that good does exist. To say that the
world is completely bad (as Needle
says) is as unrealistic as arguing that
the world is completely good. Few
would argue that the Rev. Martin
Luther King had no positive influence
on racism in the U.S., that the mil
lions of dollars raised to help the Eth
iopians were are wasted and that the
sanctuary movement is incapable of
helping any refugees.
There are great obstacles in the
world, but the impetus for action is
that Dave Kang realizes that he can't
do it alone — without the help of
other people and without God. But
I'm willing to to try because I know
that while the world is impermanent,
my convictions are not. There are
parts of the world without electricity.
Does this argue against the existence
of electricity? There are people with
out ideals — does this argue against
the existence of ideals? I believe not.
Man is "overbuilt" for this world —
he must have enough to live for, not
just enough to live on, and the source
of those ideals and convictions is
God.

nothing, he worships anything." Man
is confused because he has convic
tions but nothing to base them on.

Basing ideas on mankind subjects one
to a capricious, impermanent world,
one which shifts with the weather or
the stock market. But there is a force
of good in the world, God.
It is by adding God to the equation,
and looking outside of oneself, that
man can strive for good. There is no
way for a self-centered humanity to
advance. But the "richer, nobler ex
perience" allows one to retain convic
tions and ideas — ones based on God,
not man.
In making this idea more prag
matic, it is important to remember
that good does exist. To say that the
world is completely bad (as Needle
says) is as unrealistic as arguing that
the world is completely good. Few
would argue that the Rev. Martin
Luther King had no positive influence
on racism in the U.S., that the mil
lions of dollars raised to help the Eth
iopians were are wasted and that the
sanctuary movement is incapable of
helping any refugees.
There are great obstacles in the
world, but the impetus for action is
that Dave Kang realizes that he can't
do it alone — without the help of
other people and without God. But
I'm willing to to try because I know
that while the world is impermanent,
my convictions are not. There are
parts of the world without electricity.
Does this argue against the existence
of electricity? There are people with
out ideals — does this argue against
the existence of ideals? I believe not.
Man is "overbuilt" for this world —
he must have enough to live for, not
just enough to live on, and the source
of those ideals and convictions is
God.

Shcharansky case
merits attention
Most letters on your editorial pages
are written in response to columns,
editorials, or articles in The Daily. I,
however, am writing in response to
the lack of an editorial which, I
believe, should have been included.
The recent release of Soviet Jewish
dissident Anatoly Shcharansky is a
clear victory for human rights. Yet,
when I tell my fellow students that
Shcharansky is free, they reply,
"Shcharansky who?" The Daily,
through its editorial page, has spoken
out against infringement upon human
rights in Central America and, espe
cially, in South Africa. Why, then,
when a triumph is achieved, does The
Daily not acknowledge the event as
such?
Can it be that some people are
"more oppressed" than others? If
student awareness of injustice is im
portant, why, then, does this prime
example not receive proper atten
tion?
The theory of gatekeeping — the
subjective selection of what is news
by the media who report it — is
clearly at work here. When we agree
to fight injustice, we should do it
wholeheartedly, not selectively. That
Jews in the Soviet Union are not per
mitted to emigrate to Israel is impor
tant; that Nelson Mandela may not
return home is important; that El Sal
vadorian peasants are repressed by
the national guard is important. But
none of these events can be consid
ered "more important" than the
others in the quest for human rights.
Anatoly Shcharansky is a symbol of
suffering everywhere. Although the

symbol has been released, the cause
still remains. It should be the respon
sibility of The Daily to inform stu
dents of the injustice of Soviet Jewry
along with its editorial coverage of
other, equally unjust practices in the
world.

Seek God's help
I would like to respond to Lome
Needle's viewpoint ("Idealists must
retain convictions," The Daily, Feb.
6) in which he asks how to have con
victions in a troubled world. I don't
pretend to have the answers, but
rather some thoughts on a different
way $9 approach the issue.
Man is imperfect, and thus every
thing man does is necessarily imper
fect. Any attempt to make humanity
the answer to all problems will ulti
mately fail. The problems in life force
us to look outside ourselves, because
we cannot deal with them by our
selves. They force us to look to God,
because if mankind could solve all its
own problems there would be no
need for God.
Needle contradicts himself when he
writes "there is no force of good in
the world" and"it is the duty of every
human to improve the lot of his fel
lows." Carried to its logical conclu
sion, it is not the duty of every man to
improve the lot of his fellows if there
is no force of good in the world, for
what then is the reason? Gilbert
Chesterton said, "When man ceases
to worship God, he does not worship
nothing, he worships anything." Man
is confused because he has convic
tions but nothing to base them on.
