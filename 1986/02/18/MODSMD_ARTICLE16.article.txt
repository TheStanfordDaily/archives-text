## White students should heed cries of racism 
### 
Racism is a very volatile concept, as has been
demonstrated by the opinions of different members
of the Stanford community regarding the effects of
the attempted ASSU constitutional amendment.
It is an issue involving choices: choosing to accept
the fact that racism is thriving throughout society,
or choosing to pretend it doesn't exist, at least not
here.

ATKIN ET AL.

For people of color, the choice is determined in
large part by the constant assault on their per
sonages by this corrosive force. Although a few can
ignore reality and claim that racism is a thing of the
past in this country or on this campus, the vast
majority fight it daily, be it on the campus or in the
workplace.
But for whites, racism is only a conceptual thing,
because we do not suffer racism in any form. In the
same way, men can never fully understand sexism,
but must rely on the experiences of women to gain
an intellectual understanding of women's oppres
sion. Those of us who are white must never forget
to look at the experiences of a person of color if we
desire to gain an understanding of racism and wish
to combat it.
It is with this understanding in mind that we can
gain valuable lessons from the way legitimate con
cerns of Third World people and organizations
were dealt with by members of the Council of
Presidents (COP) and The Daily editorial board.
The concerns over the Constitution's impact on
minority representation were aired in a legitimate
fashion and reflected the experiential understand
ing of the Black Student Union and MEChA on
questions for Third World students. And contrary
to the erroneous Daily editorial ("Racist charges
are false," Feb. 4), none of the Third World organ
ziation called the COP itself racist, or the action in
tentional.

The response to these concerns was alarming. It
ranged from straight attacks by members of the
COP, to the Daily editorial which stated that rac
ism no longer exists at Stanford, to the sick OATQ
announcement calling for "white supremists"
meeting ("bring your hoods"). A white student not
aware of the "joke" showed up for the proceed
ings. It is not only the defensive and apparently
guilt-ridden response on the part of the COP that
merits attention, but the complete disrespect that
The Daily showed by printing ill-conceived attacks
under the guise of objective journalism. The
responses of the COP and The Daily disregarded
the concerns of Third World people and assumed
that they had the final say over what was and was
not racist. It's all too familiar â€” white people tel
ling Third World people to "calm down" and not
overreact to racism.

We must take seriously
these charges . . . rather
than react as if we have
been personally attacked.

And what is to be drawn from looking at the
stance taken by those mentioned above? Are we to
crucify them and feel smug on ridding the campus
of the racists? Absolutely not. The issue of racism is
not one composed solely of our personal guilt. It is
because racism is a structural component of our so
ciety, and not some inherited genetic trait found
only in rednecks and reactionaries, that positive ef
forts can be made to alleviate this problem. When
criticism of this nature from Third World students

is raised, we must remember that the point isn't
whether we are individually screwed up or racist,
but that we live in a racist society and we are all
going to be affected by that, regardless of our in
tentions. It is this societal racism which allows us to
belittle the statements of Third World students and
claim that racism no longer exists at Stanford.
As white students, most of us don't want to be
racist, and don't think of ourselves as being so. Be
cause of this we often feel guilty, defensive and up
set when it is suggested that our words or deeds
have racist implications. There is a different kind of
approach we should struggle to have (and we must
remember it will always be a struggle). We must
take seriously these charges by Third World organ
izations, rather than react as if we have been per
sonally attacked. It is vital to remember that we do
not have an experiential understanding of racial
oppression and cannot fully understand the effects
of it the way a person of color can. If Third World
students tell us that an announcement making a
joke out of the Ku Klux Klan and other white
supremacist groups (which still attack, lynch and
murder people in Northern California) isn't funny,
we have to listen to them. Those of us that arc white
and concerned about battling against racism must
remember that the fight is not only for personal
transformation, but fundamentally for a societal
transformation. And to accomplish this we need to
take concrete stands and action on issues and con
cerns that Third World people and communities
voice.
