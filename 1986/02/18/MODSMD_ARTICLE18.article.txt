# Stanford life is tough on the ego
## 
### 
Throughout my years at Stanford, I have often pon
dered the question "Why am I here?" This question is not
the same philosophical question of existence which has
plagued the intellectual man for centuries. I could never
aspire to posit that question, let alone answer it.
No, my question is definitely more simplistic, though
not less irksome. Why am I at Stanford?
I have always known that I am not a genius; however,
throughout the past few years, I have complacently
slipped from considering myself as "academically super
ior" to "bright" to "intelligent" to "smart." And now, as I
cautiously steal a glance at those around me, I cannot help
feeling that familiar and loathsome pang which signals to
me that the last of these appellations is no longer applica
ble, and a new title, of perhaps lesser respect, should be
sought.

I have repeatedly battled with (and lost to, quite
decisively) threats to my ego intellect, if there exists such a
psychological entity, and have in doing so, compromised
the beleaguered self-respect wjij£h was not so long 4 agp
well-insulated with intellectual self-confidence $nd
assuredness. And all the while, I've just adequately con
vinced myself that one notch lower in the ladder of intel
lectual superiority is really of little or no consequence to
any human being's wortn in society.
In resigning myself to occupying my space on each suc
cessively lower rung of this ladder, I've engaged in activi
ties which I foolishly believed might shield me from expo
sure to the ignominy of my own condemnation to self
devaluation. The activity — light-hearted self
deprecation. Perhaps I felt that by openly criticizing my
mental inadequacies, I would temporarily escape that
private realization of failure that can be so cruel and tor
menting. But I always knew I would have to confront the
dishonor, and the self-deprecatory remarks were no
longer perfunctory ploys to self-delude as much as they
had become messages to remind.
The strangest phenomenon about this affliction is that
it truly is not self-induced. It is my unyielding conviction
that the typical unsuspecting Stanford freshman
(equipped with dictionary, pillow and Macintosh) is at
once awed and humbled by the wealth of unaffected intel
ligence which immediately envelops him. It is an ines
capable part of the Stanford experience to have one's aca
demic self-confidence constantly challenged, if not
consumed, by the awareness that across the classroom, the

hall, the dining table, there exist individuals who seem far
superior in intelligence.
This awakening to one's apparent intellectual in
feriority typically characterizes the freshman experience.
I, however, used all the warnings from "experienced" up
perclassman to justify my academic failures, not to fuel my
ambition to overcome the "conflict" of which I had been
warned. I experienced no conflict.
I have learned . . . only too well. My intellectual self
confidence has been challenged and vanquished countless
times, and reconstruction seems not only difficult, but in
creasingly hopeless. As I near the close of my Stanford
career, I realize that it is time for me to determine for
myself a direction in life. My despondence, of course, only
too generously expands to include this even greater fear:
how am I to choose for myself a direction in life when I
haven't even determined my competency in doing so?
Surrounded by determined pre-meds, ambitious
politicans-to-be, aspiring lawyer-types and altruistic
public servants, I find myself falling deeper and deeper in
despair. Reviving a weakened self-confidence is difficult
enough without the additional burden of determining a
purpose in life.
"Why am I here?" 1 repeatedly ask myself, while won
dering what audacity and brazen foolishness 1 must pos
sess to function and coexist with others who one day I will
see on TV screens, whose names I will notice in
newspapers and magazines, whose fame I will acknowl
edge when I admit, with that strange mixture of pride and
envy, "I knew her," or "I knew him."
But they will merely be the most publicized examples of
h?ye pyrsued their talents and interests; there
are countless others, one of whom I am immediately

reminded of.
At the San Francisco Symphony, there is a second
violinist who always catches my attention. He is such an
amusing character, but one who is so unnoticeable and
completely innocuous, one would find it difficult to
believe that he could move anyone as much as he does one
particular Daily columnist. He sits to the left of the con
ductor, two seats in front of the concertmaster. Just
watching him play delights me: he has the most reprehen
sible posture! After slouching onto the stage, he slumps in
his tiny chair and allows his extra weight to settle itself
wherever it finds a place; he holds his violin down so low
that when he plays his chin almost touches his knees. But
when he plays, he really plays. The conductor, I am cer
tain of it, is always aware of this man's eagerness, and I've
frequently seen him look into his eyes with approbation
and gratitude. 1 sometimes wish others could see it: the
strange combination of zeal and quiet contentment with
which he plays.
But I should not care about what the others see; 1 know
he doesn't. And it is precisely this complacency and un
pretentious self-assuredness with which he plays that at
once suffuses me with admiration and humility.
