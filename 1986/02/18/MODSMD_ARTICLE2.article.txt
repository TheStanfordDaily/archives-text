# Board denies AASA funds
## 
### R. TAEZA PIERCE Senior staff writer 
What ASSU Program Board members say
they intended as a constructive jolt to two
student organizations has sparked frustra
tion and anger among members of the Asian
American community here.
Under a new Program Board appeals
process, the groups — the Asian American
Student Association (AASA) and the Asian
American Activities Center — have
received no funding for the upcoming year
in a move board members say was to serve
as an incentive to provide the board with
more information of their programming.
AASA and the center, an umbrella or
ganization serving all of the Asian-
American students' organizations, learned
of the Program Board's action early last
week and began organizing a petition drive
asking for signatures calling for the board to
reverse the decision. According to an
AASA spokesperson, group members circ
ulated 20 petitions, collecting 200
signatures.
Members viewed the initial decision as a
statement against the viability of AASA's
programming. The Program Board was
"basically saying, 'Well, you don't have a
right to exist,' " senior Elsa Tsutaoka said.
Tsutaoka, who edits AASA's bulletin,
said AASA spokespersons applied for fund
ing according to the Program Board
guidelines, went to the initial interview, and

learned when the results were posted that
the Program Board had recommended they
not get funding.
At the time, Tsutaoka said, the board of
fered no reason for the decision. To the
AASA, it looked like the board had deemed
the group not worthy of fynding because it
did not approve ot the AASA's or the cen
ter's programming.
"We have a right to work out for our
selves what we want our community to be
and what we want to do. Everyone [in
AASA] could agree on that, even though
we're not a homogenous community,"
Tsutaoka said, adding that if there were
problems in the community, "we have the
right to work out those problems ourselves."
Sophomore Vivian Wu, who helped au
thor the funding proposal, said, "I've never
seen so many Asian Americans get so angry
and upset before, enough to gather together
and defend the community."
Following the petition drive and attempts
on the part of AASA Chairperson Shirley
Wang to arrange a meeting with the Pro
gram Board to get an explanation for the
decision, the board met with the AASA on
Thursday night to discuss the budget pro
posal again. The AASA had applied for
$3,800 and the center for $3,900.
Tsutaoka said at the meeting a member of
the Program Board told the group of about
20 AASA members," If they didn't feel like
they had enough information on the group,
they would give a zero recommendation to

get the group pissed off and to spark ap
peals.
"But if they wanted groups to appeal,
then why did we have to work so hard to get
a meeting?" she asked. "They're implying
that this organization doesn't need, or
doesn't deserve, student money."
Program Board Chairman Eugene Chen
said the appeals process was not designed to
get groups "pissed off." He said," It was sort
of the intent; but it wasn't as nasty as that."
According to Chen, the board gave the zero
recommendation to alert AASA to the
serious need to provide the board with a
written statement giving more information.
Chen said the board used the zero recom
mendation to say, "Let's get serious. If no
further information is provided, this is what
will happen."
Wu said AASA doesn't accept this line of
reasoning. "A community shouldn't have to
get pissed off, organize themselves and
defend themselves to get" what they have a
right to, she said. Wu said she read the Pro
gram Board's bylaws and found "nothing
that says you have to judge how valuable an
activity is to fund it. This attitude about
trying to determine whether we 'deserve'
the money is unappropriated'
At one point, Wu said, a board member
suggested that " AASA's not as active as the
BSU [Black Student Union] or MEChA
[Movimiento Estudianui Chicano de
Azatlan]" and hence deserved less
funding. She expressed concern at
this "divisive" implication that
minority groups get pitted against
each other in efforts to obtain fund
ing.
Program Board member Steven
Hellman said that in retrospect, the
zero recommendation did more harm
than good. He said it was "very
unlikely" that the recommendation
would have passed the Appropria
tions Committee, the next step in the
funding process before the recom
mendation reaches the senate.
Hellman said the ensuing contro
versy showed "giving a zero recom
mendation as a signal is not an effec
tive way," of expressing concern. The
board meant to "send a signal with a
zero recommendation ... to fire
them up a little bit so that they would
come back."
Hellman added, "They (zero
recommendations) won't be given for
that reason in the future." He said the
board would most likely either rec
ommend partial funding, or "we'll
make no recommendation and say,
'Come back. . ..' It obviously wasn't
that constructive."
Wu said the supplementary infor

mation sheet AASA provided at the
second meeting was not new, but
came straight from the original
budget proposal.
Program Board member Jason
Matherly said, however, that the sup
plementary sheet clarified the func
tion of the center as an umbrella or
ganization that serves and funds all
other Asian-American groups,
"Using all the information the
board members had (at the inter
view), we thought the zero recom
mendation was correct," Matherly
said. "As far as we knew from the
budget and speaking to the represen
tative, we didn't see that they were
putting on any programs not offered
by other Asian-American organiza
tions, or that they were assuming
operating expenses for all the Asian
groups.
"I totally understand why (AASA)
thought we would know that," he
said. "But we didn't. ... It was
simply a misunderstanding. We're
very happy that we had this new ap
peals process.
Chen said the "misunderstanding"
has already led to "false" accusations
of racism. "I think this is a case of a
little bit of overreaction." He said the
new Program Board recommen
dations for AASA and the center will
be posted early this week. He invited
concerned students to come to his of
fice hours today from 1-2 p.m. to dis
cuss the situation.

view), we thought the zero recom
mendation was correct," Matherly
said. "As far as we knew from the
budget and speaking to the represen
tative, we didn't see that they were
putting on any programs not offered
by other Asian-American organiza
tions, or that they were assuming
operating expenses for all the Asian
groups.
"I totally understand why (AASA)
thought we would know that," he
said. "But we didn't. ... It was
simply a misunderstanding. We're
very happy that we had this new ap
peals process.
Chen said the "misunderstanding"
has already led to "false" accusations
of racism. "I think this is a case of a
little bit of overreaction." He said the
new Program Board recommen
dations for AASA and the center will
be posted early this week. He invited
concerned students to come to his of
fice hours today from 1-2 p.m. to dis
cuss the situation.
What ASSU Program Board members say
they intended as a constructive jolt to two
student organizations has sparked frustra
tion and anger among members of the Asian
American community here.
Under a new Program Board appeals
process, the groups — the Asian American
Student Association (AASA) and the Asian
American Activities Center — have
received no funding for the upcoming year
in a move board members say was to serve
as an incentive to provide the board with
more information of their programming.
AASA and the center, an umbrella or
ganization serving all of the Asian-
American students' organizations, learned
of the Program Board's action early last
week and began organizing a petition drive
asking for signatures calling for the board to
reverse the decision. According to an
AASA spokesperson, group members circ
ulated 20 petitions, collecting 200
signatures.
Members viewed the initial decision as a
statement against the viability of AASA's
programming. The Program Board was
"basically saying, 'Well, you don't have a
right to exist,' " senior Elsa Tsutaoka said.
Tsutaoka, who edits AASA's bulletin,
said AASA spokespersons applied for fund
ing according to the Program Board
guidelines, went to the initial interview, and

learned when the results were posted that
the Program Board had recommended they
not get funding.
At the time, Tsutaoka said, the board of
fered no reason for the decision. To the
AASA, it looked like the board had deemed
the group not worthy of fynding because it
did not approve ot the AASA's or the cen
ter's programming.
"We have a right to work out for our
selves what we want our community to be
and what we want to do. Everyone [in
AASA] could agree on that, even though
we're not a homogenous community,"
Tsutaoka said, adding that if there were
problems in the community, "we have the
right to work out those problems ourselves."
Sophomore Vivian Wu, who helped au
thor the funding proposal, said, "I've never
seen so many Asian Americans get so angry
and upset before, enough to gather together
and defend the community."
Following the petition drive and attempts
on the part of AASA Chairperson Shirley
Wang to arrange a meeting with the Pro
gram Board to get an explanation for the
decision, the board met with the AASA on
Thursday night to discuss the budget pro
posal again. The AASA had applied for
$3,800 and the center for $3,900.
Tsutaoka said at the meeting a member of
the Program Board told the group of about
20 AASA members," If they didn't feel like
they had enough information on the group,
they would give a zero recommendation to

get the group pissed off and to spark ap
peals.
"But if they wanted groups to appeal,
then why did we have to work so hard to get
a meeting?" she asked. "They're implying
that this organization doesn't need, or
doesn't deserve, student money."
Program Board Chairman Eugene Chen
said the appeals process was not designed to
get groups "pissed off." He said," It was sort
of the intent; but it wasn't as nasty as that."
According to Chen, the board gave the zero
recommendation to alert AASA to the
serious need to provide the board with a
written statement giving more information.
Chen said the board used the zero recom
mendation to say, "Let's get serious. If no
further information is provided, this is what
will happen."
Wu said AASA doesn't accept this line of
reasoning. "A community shouldn't have to
get pissed off, organize themselves and
defend themselves to get" what they have a
right to, she said. Wu said she read the Pro
gram Board's bylaws and found "nothing
that says you have to judge how valuable an
activity is to fund it. This attitude about
trying to determine whether we 'deserve'
the money is unappropriated'
At one point, Wu said, a board member
suggested that " AASA's not as active as the
BSU [Black Student Union] or MEChA
[Movimiento Estudianui Chicano de
Azatlan]" and hence deserved less
funding. She expressed concern at
this "divisive" implication that
minority groups get pitted against
each other in efforts to obtain fund
ing.
Program Board member Steven
Hellman said that in retrospect, the
zero recommendation did more harm
than good. He said it was "very
unlikely" that the recommendation
would have passed the Appropria
tions Committee, the next step in the
funding process before the recom
mendation reaches the senate.
Hellman said the ensuing contro
versy showed "giving a zero recom
mendation as a signal is not an effec
tive way," of expressing concern. The
board meant to "send a signal with a
zero recommendation ... to fire
them up a little bit so that they would
come back."
Hellman added, "They (zero
recommendations) won't be given for
that reason in the future." He said the
board would most likely either rec
ommend partial funding, or "we'll
make no recommendation and say,
'Come back. . ..' It obviously wasn't
that constructive."
Wu said the supplementary infor

mation sheet AASA provided at the
second meeting was not new, but
came straight from the original
budget proposal.
Program Board member Jason
Matherly said, however, that the sup
plementary sheet clarified the func
tion of the center as an umbrella or
ganization that serves and funds all
other Asian-American groups,
"Using all the information the
