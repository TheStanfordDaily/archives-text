## BUG ME 
### CHRIS MYERS Staff Writer 
And the deluge came. It rained for
40 days and 40 nights, and as The
Daily office began to tear away from
its moorings, the editor loaded her
writers on two by two. The happy,
adventuresome group was floating
away down Santa Teresa Street,
typing away at their terminals in a
most carefree manner, when sud
denly they heard a loud voice be
hind them.
"Hey, wait a minute, you can't
just go floating away like this! That
Bug Me guy hasn't even answered
my question yet!"
Okay, okay, so I haven't gotten
to some of the more recently
received questions, yet. But I'm
working on them, so if you sent in a
question in the last couple weeks,
be patient. Some of these questions
are long-term projects; others I'm
just saving for a better time. Really.
Honest. I wouldn't kid about some
thing like this.
Dear Bug Me,
With your vast resources to draw
upon and your willingness to seek
the truth regardless of the many
dangers involved, we have a ques
tion that demands your attention.
How many licks does it take to get to
the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie
Pop?
- Steve "The Glik" Glikbarg,
Lambda Nu.
I'm afraid this is one of those un
answerable questions that have
been nagging at people for a long
time. Like, "Which came first, the
chicken or the egg?" and, "Why do
bad things happen to good
people?" and, "Why the hell won't
it stop raining?"
But I thought I'd at least try,
anyway. Rather than just going off
and seeing how many licks it took
me, I took a more experimental ap
proach, passing out 20 Tootsie
Pops to residents of my dorm,

Adams House, and hoping to get a
statistical average.
I immediately ran into problems.
First of all, just what does it mean
to get to the Tootsie Roll center of
a Tootsie Pop?
And of course, no two Tootsie
Pops are alike. Each is deformed in
its own unique way.
Furthermore, what is a lick? I
really didn't want to mess around
with that one, so I just left it up to
the individual. So you see, this was
all very scientific.
I only heard from eight
people. Among them, the average
was 200.5 licks. I guess the rest of
the slimy weasels hid in their closets
and bit their Tootsie Pops. At least
one person reported that his Pop
had been assaulted by ants.

Just to be thorough, I called
Tootsie Roll Industries in Chicago,
111., to see if they had any policy
statement on the issue.
The only person I talked to there
was the switchboard operator, but
she sounded like she knew about as
much about it as anybody, and she
certainly didn't sound like she was
about to let me talk to anybody
higher up.
It turns out the people at Tootsie
Roll define "getting to the center"
as exposing the entire Tootsie cen
ter. But I'm convinced that's utterly
impossible.
"There really is no answer," the
switchboard operator said. "Each

person has a different answer. It
depends on a lot of things, like
who's doing the licking. For in
stance, a cow would take a lot fewer
licks than a baby."
So it seems the bottom line is that
the answer to this question is a
highly personal matter.
But this whole thing with the cow
was pretty intriguing to me. I
thought I'd look into it, so the other
day I hiked up to the Dish and of
fered a grape Tootsie Pop to one of
the cows up there. It just blinked its
big eyes at me and chomped the
whole thing in one bite, including
the stick.
I have yet to meet a cow I could
trust.
Dear Bug Me,
Why is the 'C' parking lot next to
the Boathouse such a sandpit?
People seem to park any way they
can fit their car in, not caring
whether or not they block other
people in. If the University is going
to make people pay to park there,
why don't they make it into a real
parking lot?
- Pete Moss
I talked to Bob Seger in the Uni
versity Planning Office about this
one. He made it sound like a
change in the state of this lot is not
a real possibility. It seems some
pretty important people like it just
the way it is.
"Many people are attached to
the rural ambiance of the Lake, in
cluding many people at the top,"
Seger said. "Our main priority is
protection of the levy of the lake.
People have a tendency to park on
it, so the Planning Office is explor
ing ways to protect against that.
"There are no plans to change
the general free-for-all atmosphere
of the lot."
Apparently, then, in this
cheapest of University lots, parkers
will continue to get what they pay
for, plus some extra atmosphere, at
no extra cost.

received questions, yet. But I'm
working on them, so if you sent in a
question in the last couple weeks,
be patient. Some of these questions
are long-term projects; others I'm
just saving for a better time. Really.
Honest. I wouldn't kid about some
thing like this.
Dear Bug Me,
With your vast resources to draw
upon and your willingness to seek
the truth regardless of the many
dangers involved, we have a ques
tion that demands your attention.
How many licks does it take to get to
the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie
Pop?
- Steve "The Glik" Glikbarg,
Lambda Nu.
I'm afraid this is one of those un
answerable questions that have
been nagging at people for a long
time. Like, "Which came first, the
chicken or the egg?" and, "Why do
bad things happen to good
people?" and, "Why the hell won't
it stop raining?"
But I thought I'd at least try,
anyway. Rather than just going off
and seeing how many licks it took
me, I took a more experimental ap
proach, passing out 20 Tootsie
Pops to residents of my dorm,

Adams House, and hoping to get a
statistical average.
I immediately ran into problems.
First of all, just what does it mean
to get to the Tootsie Roll center of
a Tootsie Pop?
And of course, no two Tootsie
Pops are alike. Each is deformed in
its own unique way.
Furthermore, what is a lick? I
really didn't want to mess around
with that one, so I just left it up to
the individual. So you see, this was
all very scientific.
I only heard from eight
people. Among them, the average
was 200.5 licks. I guess the rest of
the slimy weasels hid in their closets
and bit their Tootsie Pops. At least
one person reported that his Pop
had been assaulted by ants.

Just to be thorough, I called
Tootsie Roll Industries in Chicago,
111., to see if they had any policy
statement on the issue.
The only person I talked to there
was the switchboard operator, but
she sounded like she knew about as
much about it as anybody, and she
certainly didn't sound like she was
about to let me talk to anybody
higher up.
It turns out the people at Tootsie
Roll define "getting to the center"
as exposing the entire Tootsie cen
ter. But I'm convinced that's utterly
impossible.
"There really is no answer," the
switchboard operator said. "Each

person has a different answer. It
depends on a lot of things, like
who's doing the licking. For in
stance, a cow would take a lot fewer
licks than a baby."
So it seems the bottom line is that
the answer to this question is a
highly personal matter.
But this whole thing with the cow
was pretty intriguing to me. I
thought I'd look into it, so the other
day I hiked up to the Dish and of
fered a grape Tootsie Pop to one of
the cows up there. It just blinked its
big eyes at me and chomped the
whole thing in one bite, including
the stick.
I have yet to meet a cow I could
trust.
Dear Bug Me,
Why is the 'C' parking lot next to
the Boathouse such a sandpit?
People seem to park any way they
can fit their car in, not caring
whether or not they block other
people in. If the University is going
to make people pay to park there,
why don't they make it into a real
parking lot?
- Pete Moss
I talked to Bob Seger in the Uni
versity Planning Office about this
one. He made it sound like a
change in the state of this lot is not
a real possibility. It seems some
pretty important people like it just
the way it is.
"Many people are attached to
the rural ambiance of the Lake, in
cluding many people at the top,"
Seger said. "Our main priority is
protection of the levy of the lake.
People have a tendency to park on
it, so the Planning Office is explor
ing ways to protect against that.
"There are no plans to change
the general free-for-all atmosphere
of the lot."
Apparently, then, in this
cheapest of University lots, parkers
will continue to get what they pay
for, plus some extra atmosphere, at
no extra cost.

And the deluge came. It rained for
40 days and 40 nights, and as The
Daily office began to tear away from
its moorings, the editor loaded her
writers on two by two. The happy,
adventuresome group was floating
away down Santa Teresa Street,
typing away at their terminals in a
most carefree manner, when sud
denly they heard a loud voice be
hind them.
"Hey, wait a minute, you can't
just go floating away like this! That
Bug Me guy hasn't even answered
my question yet!"
Okay, okay, so I haven't gotten
to some of the more recently
received questions, yet. But I'm
working on them, so if you sent in a
question in the last couple weeks,
be patient. Some of these questions
are long-term projects; others I'm
just saving for a better time. Really.
