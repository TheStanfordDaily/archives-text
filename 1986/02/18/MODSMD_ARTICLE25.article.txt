## Johnson, Cal rout Card from coast to coast 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY — It was a miserable Saturday
evening in a miserable excuse for a major-college
basketball facility, and the Stanford men's basket
ball team responded by playing a miserable basket
ball game.
Before a sellout crowd of 6,660 at Harmon Gym
here and a national television audience on ESPN,
the Cardinal played its worst game of the season
and was annihilated by California 81-53 in a game
not as close as the score would indicate.
It had looked to be the showdown of the year —
the two Bay Area archrivals playing in a packed
madhouse for sole possession of third place in the
Pacific 10 Conference.
The game had been sold out all week, and those
without tickets were paying scalpers $20 to get
inside. The bands were blaring, the crowd was
cheering, and all the indications were for a repeat
of last month's thrilling 75-69 Cal win in Maples
Pavilion.
That lasted a little over five minutes. At the
14:29 mark of the first half, Cal guard Kevin
Johnson hit an eight-footer off a drive to break a 6-
6 tie. The few hundred Cardinal faithful who made
the hour-long trip across the Bay should have gone
home then.
Cal's first 10-point lead came at the 8:37 mark
when Eddie Javius took a feed from Johnson and
made it 26-16. Cal's first 20-point lead came at the
1:45 mark when Leonard Taylor put in an offen
sive rebound to make it 39-18. And Cal's first 30-
point lead came with seven seconds left in the
game, when LeVord Jenkins hit both ends of a one
and-one to make it 81-51.
Novian Whitsitt hit a 13-footer with one second
left to let the Cardinal save some face and silence
the chant of "Thirty, thirty" from the Cal student
section. Whitsitt led Stanford with 14 points.
"We didn't expect a huge win," Cal Coach Lou
Campanelli said afterward. "We expected a dog
fight. We were clicking and they weren't. We got
on a first-half roll and didn't look back."
With the victory, Cal improved its record to 7-5
in the Pac-10, 15-7 overall, and moved into sole
possession of third place, 2Vi games behind first
place Washington. Stanford falls to 6-6 and 12-12

and is tied with UCLA and Oregon State for
fourth, 3V2 games out of the lead.
The question of the night was whether Cal
played 28 points better than Stanford or whether
Stanford played 28 points worse than Cal. "You
don't know that yourself as a coach," Cardinal
Coach Tom Davis said. "I like to give them credit
for playing well. They (Cal) did a nice job of
rebounding and on the transition — they just blew
by us."

And most of that blowing by the Cardinal was
done by Johnson. He scored a game-high 21
points — including 14 in the decisive first half —
pulled down nine rebounds from his guard position,
had seven assists, shot 64 percent from the field
and 75 percent from the line, and took apart the
Stanford 3-2 zone.
"Their quick guards give them another dimen
sion," Davis said. "Good guards can control a
ballgame."
"Johnson creates the transition, which opens
things up for him," Campanelli said. "It's not really
Stanford, it's just Kevin."
As if being run off the floor by a quicker team
weren't bad enough, the Cardinal was dominated
under the boards. Cal had 53 rebounds to Stan
ford's 32, and the Cardinal had only nine rebounds
at its offensive end, where Cal snagged 36
defensively.
"You like to think if a team is quicker than you
'ihat you'll be stronger than them," Davis said, "but
they were not only quicker than we were, they were
stronger under the basket."
A lack of second shots is particularly fatal when
the first shots aren't going in. Stanford shot a pitiful
35 percent from the field in the first half, and then
got worse, shooting 29 percent in the second. Cal,
meanwhile, shot 62 percent in the first half and 55
percent for the game.
Included in there for Stanford was a seven
minute stretch between the 10:26 and 3:28 marks
of the first half without scoring.
Greg Butler was the only Cardinal player to
shoot 50 percent, going 4-of-8 and finishing with
10 points. Todd Lichti, with 12, and Whitsitt were
the only others in double figures.
The game was particularly important for both
teams' postseason tournament hopes. The thinking
is that the top three teams in the conference will go
to either the NCAA or National Invitational
Tournament, and likely no more than four.
"I think we'll make the NIT with 16 or 17 wins,"
Campanelli said. "We're just going to take it one
game at a time. With six to play, we're in decent
position."
Stanford will be in Los Angeles this week, facing
USC on Thursday and UCLA next Monday. "I'll
be shocked if we're not ready to play Thursday
night," Davis said.

Things just got away from Andy Fischer and the Stanford basketball
team during Saturday night's embarrassing nationally televised loss to
California. The 81-53 defeat was the worst conference setback for the
Cardinal this year.
