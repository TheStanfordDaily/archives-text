# Swimmers win in rain
## Top-ranked men edge Bruins, Trojans

While everyone in the Bay Area was swimming to
and from various commitments this weekend in the
monsoon weather conditions, the Stanford men's
swimming team swam to well-earned victories in Los
Angeles.
After struggling to a 59-54 triumph over UCLA on
Friday, the Cardinal beat USC the following day by a
61-52 tally.
Stanford hasn't faced such close competition in a
long while, and over the weekend it had its fill. "This
was the toughest back-to-back competition we've ever
faced. And travelling makes it even harder," Stanford
Coach Skip Kenney said. "I can't remember ever being
so proud of the guys in dual meet competition."
On Friday, co-captain John Moffet's victory in the
200-yard breaststroke (2:03.62) snatched the meet
from UCLA. "1 had to win in order to win the meet,"
Moffet said. " I was racing against Minervini and Fer
nandez, and I hadn't ever beaten them. But fortun
ately, 1 swam my best time of the year."
Both Pablo Morales and Jeff Kostoff won two events
at UCLA. Morales won the 200 individual medley and

butterfly, and Jvas toff swept the iyOUCLand 500
h„*>»tteftstyles. Sean Murphy, QaptivrfciJJtJje 20P,sb«ekstroke
in 1:49.71, and the 400 medley relay also finished first
with a time of 3:18.72.
"The mental toughness our guys showed was pretty
inspiring," Kenney said. "And I was really pleased to
see the freshmen help out."
Freshmen John Hodge and Jay Mortenson swam
hard and took first (21.28) and second (21.45),
respectively, in the 50 freestyle on Saturday.
Amidst drizzle and clouds, USC hosted Stanford in
the Olympic Pool on Sunday. It was a homecoming of
sorts for Stanford's Morales, Moffet, Kostoff and An
thony Mosse, who returned to the pool they swam in in
the 1984 Olympic Games.
As he did against the Bruins, Kostoff won both the
1,000 and 500 freestyles. Morales took first in his 200
individual medley, but teammate Mosse inched by him
in the 200 butterfly.
"We were both pretty tired, and the idea this time of
the year is to swim hard when you're tired," Mosse
said. "1 was training rather slow in the middle of the
week, so 1 wanted to swim fast this weekend."
The Stanford diving team didn't fare as well in
Southern California, as it lost both days.
