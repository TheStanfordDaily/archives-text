stymied Stanford on one hit Sunday to beat the
Cardinal 10-1 in Honolulu and prevent the Card
inal from sweeping the third game of the weekend
set.
The Cardinal, now 9-3. took Friday's opener N-2
and Saturday's game 9-8. while the Rainbows saw
their season record fall to 5-3 after the weekend
set.
Furtak, 2-0, pitched a complete game, surren
dering only a second-inning run — which was un
earned — and a John Ramos single in the fourth.
He walked four and struck out one along the way.
Freshmen Steve Chitren started for the Cardinal
and held his own — for a while. He limited the
Rainbows to two runs through the first five innings.
But in the sixth, things fell apart. Against three
Stanford pitchers. Hawaii pushed five runs across
the plate — two of which were charged to Chitren.
I -1. After that, it was left to Furtak to clean up.

Saturday's game had all the drama that Sunday's
10-1 rout didn't.
Hawaii jumped to a 5-1 lead after three innings,
driving Stanford starter A 1 Osuna from the mound.
Osuna, who lasted only 2-2/3 innings and coughed
up five runs on five hits, gave way to middle
reliever Lee Plemel. Plemel pitched until the
eighth, surrendering only a pair of runs on two hits.
Plemel's effort gave Stanford's hats time to
whittle away at the Rainbow advantage.
A single run in the top of the fourth, knocked in
by Frank Carey, and two more in the sixth made
the score 5-4. The teams traded runs in the
seventh, and Hawaii scored once in the eighth to
assume a 7-5 lead.
But Stanford had one more chance — its last at
bat. Mark Davis and John Ramos drew walks to
open the ninth. After Walt Harris fouled out. Doug
Robbins singled to left, scoring Davis.
Mike Deßcnon followed with another single to
left off loser Joey Vierra. 0-2, which drove in
Ramos with the tying run and sent Fred Lanin
gham, who pinch-ran for Robbins, to third.
fielder Nelson Inabati's throw to third went astrav.

allowing Laninghani to score and moving Dcßenon
to third. Then Deßenon scored Stanford's fourth
run of the inning on a squeeze hunt by Mark Mach
tolf.
Stanford's 9-7 advantage almost wasn't enough.
After retiring the first two batters in the bottom of
the ninth. Rob Wassenaar walked Randy Oyama.
That brought up pinch-hitter Markus Owens.
Owens drilled a Wassenaar offering off the right
field wall, scoring Oyama easily. As the ball rolled
away from right fielder Toi Cook and toward the
infield. Owens decided to try to score from third.
Center fielder Mark Davis relayed the ball to Carey
who threw home to Ramos. Owens was out by
eight to 10 feet.
Stanford's execution of the relay play preserved
the win for Wassenaar, 2-0.
Friday's series opener was dominated by Stan
ford right-hander Jack McDowell. The lanky soph
omore scattered six hits over nine innings, giving up
single runs in the third and seventh. Although he
walked six, McDowell struck out a career-high 12
batters to post his third win in four decisions this
year.
