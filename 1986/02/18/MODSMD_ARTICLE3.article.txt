# To bid or not to bid: it's all in the points

### MAUREEN MORAN 
"The Bid System." To most undergradu
ates it probably sounds like the format for an
antique auction, but for approximately 750
seniors trying to secure a job after gradua
tion, those words could be the key to a new
office door. (Or at least a foot in the door to
their next job interview.)

The Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter, which sits adjacent to the Bookstore, is
like a second home to most seniors, while the
majority of undergraduates cruise by it daily
without a second glance.
It is here at the CPPC, as it is usually
referred to, where the bid system operates.
And it is here where the old system has un
dergone a new twist in the never-ending en
deavor to help students more capably
prepare for their post-college careers.
The bid system is essentially the fairest
way for the CPPC to determine which of the
many students are able to secure the few
highly-coveted interviews with "non
technical" employers visiting campus. (Non

technical does not refer to the abilities of the
interviewer, it is juai another CPPC term
which indicates that the job positions are
non-technical in nature.)
Each student wishing to interview for the
non-technical positions must open an
"account" at the CPPC at a cost of $15. This
account consists of 1,000 points, with which
each student can bid for upcoming inter
views. The CPPC has stipulated that the
maximum amount a bidder can wager to suc
cessfully secure an interview is 400 points.
The logic behind the bid system is
synonymous with economic theory, accord
ing to Christopher Shinkman, director of the
CPPC.
"One should look upon the bid system as
an economic model. You're spending
money, in effect with your points, so you
have to ask yourself, 'How much is this inter
view really worth?' " Shinkman said.
Obviously, with a maximum bid of 400
points, a bidder competing for highly
demanded interviews could only hope to ob
tain two interviews before using up 800 of
his 1,000 points. This was part of the prob-
