# To bid or not to bid: it's all in the points

### MAUREEN MORAN 
"The Bid System." To most undergradu
ates it probably sounds like the format for an
antique auction, but for approximately 750
seniors trying to secure a job after gradua
tion, those words could be the key to a new
office door. (Or at least a foot in the door to
their next job interview.)

Feature

The Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter, which sits adjacent to the Bookstore, is
like a second home to most seniors, while the
majority of undergraduates cruise by it daily
without a second glance.
It is here at the CPPC, as it is usually
referred to, where the bid system operates.
And it is here where the old system has un
dergone a new twist in the never-ending en
deavor to help students more capably
prepare for their post-college careers.
The bid system is essentially the fairest
way for the CPPC to determine which of the
many students are able to secure the few
highly-coveted interviews with "non
technical" employers visiting campus. (Non

technical does not refer to the abilities of the
interviewer, it is juai another CPPC term
which indicates that the job positions are
non-technical in nature.)
Each student wishing to interview for the
non-technical positions must open an
"account" at the CPPC at a cost of $15. This
account consists of 1,000 points, with which
each student can bid for upcoming inter
views. The CPPC has stipulated that the
maximum amount a bidder can wager to suc
cessfully secure an interview is 400 points.
The logic behind the bid system is
synonymous with economic theory, accord
ing to Christopher Shinkman, director of the
CPPC.
"One should look upon the bid system as
an economic model. You're spending
money, in effect with your points, so you
have to ask yourself, 'How much is this inter
view really worth?' " Shinkman said.
Obviously, with a maximum bid of 400
points, a bidder competing for highly
demanded interviews could only hope to ob
tain two interviews before using up 800 of
his 1,000 points. This was part of the prob-
lem the CPPC was trying to address when it made some
changes in the bid system policy in January., Now a stu
dent who successfully bids on a schedule will lose only the
points that the lowest succesful bidder wagered, and not
necessarily the full number of points he or she bid initially.
Yolanda Morales, supervisor of recruitment activities at
the CPPC, said that too many students were overcalculat
ing the bid value of an interview with respect to other bid
ders and, as a result, were unnecessarily spending too
many points to obtain an interview. By subtracting the
lowest successful bidder's points, this problem of students
bidding beyond the apparent value of the interview, rela
tive to other bids, would also be eliminated.
Or so they thought.
Morales explained that the new policy is suffering from
a reverse-psychology reaction.
"Students are bidding extremely high," in anticipation
of a lower deduction from their accounts, only to discover
that the lowest successful bid is extremely high as well,
Morales said.
Citing recent cases involving The First Boston Corpora
tion and the Foote, Cone and Belding advertising agency,
wherein every student bid 400 points, Morales said that
staff members had to pull names out of a hat to fairly
compile interview schedules.
Shinkman explained the recent trend of high bidding by
pointing out that, with every change, there inevitably fol
lows an adjustment period.
"1 guess you learn from experience, and that only hap
pens once you get burned like that. From then on you go
back to what the principle of the system is, and that is that
you bid what the interview is worth to you," he said.
Unfortunately, the competetive quality inherent in the
bid system seems to be preventing this "return to princi
ple." The bold sign posted on the central bulletin board in
the CPPC, however, serves as reminder against profligate
bidding practices:
"DO NOT OVERBID. Bidders who wager more
points than they have will have their bids DISQUALI
FIED."
Apparently the new trend is to bid beyond one's point
resources, in anticipation of being underbid. Clever, isn't
it?
Despite such minor problems, Morales said the new
procedure of deducting the lowest successful bid has made
internal operations much more efficient, since the staff
only has to deduct one constant number from each stu
dent's account.

How did this change in the bid system, the first since its
implementation four years ago, come about? Morales said
that student Suggestions were the force behind the
changes just made.
"For over three years we have asked students, through
a survey about the bid system, for what kind of improve
ments they would like to see. The one thing that kept
coming back to us was that they would really like to have
the lowest successful bid removed from all successful bid
ders' accounts," Morales explained.
Stressing that student input and opinion is highly valued
and taken very seriously, Morales said the CPPC is busy
conducting a new survey on the bid system changes.
"We are asking students to give us some feedback and
to let us know how they feel and if they want to go back to
the original system," Morales said.
Encouraging all students to report to her their ideas for
changing the system, Morales explained that since stu
dents directly experience the flaws in the system, they of
ten come up with the best possible solutions.
"One student requested that only 200 points be the
maximum any one student can bid as opposed to the 400
points." According to Morales, that's a very good idea
ihat is being seriously considered for the future.
When asked if there may be modifications made soon in
response to student feedback, Morales answered that the
CPPC, "is not planning on changing the policy at all for
the rest of this academic year."
She did note, however, that a new computerized bid
system will be implemented by this fall and that this new
electronic method may require some alterations of the
current manual system.
Using statistics from years past, Morales hypothesized
that part of the problem faced by the CPPC is the recent
overcrowding within the system. She emphasized the
growing number of students utilizing the bid system in
their career searches, citing that liberal arts interviews in
creased from 1,100 to 1,900 in one academic year.
Morales has also noticed a growing number of technical
majors — who do not normally need to participate in the
bid system to secure technical interviews — now using the
bid system to look for non-technical positions.
Morales said the CPPC is well aware of the overcrowd
ing problem but stressed that students can make the dif
ference.
"The stongest thing that can happen is that students let
me know how they feel. Students are the backbone of the
CPPC. I need their support as much as they need my
help."

changing the system, Morales explained that since stu
dents directly experience the flaws in the system, they of
ten come up with the best possible solutions.
"One student requested that only 200 points be the
maximum any one student can bid as opposed to the 400
points." According to Morales, that's a very good idea
ihat is being seriously considered for the future.
When asked if there may be modifications made soon in
response to student feedback, Morales answered that the
CPPC, "is not planning on changing the policy at all for
the rest of this academic year."
She did note, however, that a new computerized bid
system will be implemented by this fall and that this new
electronic method may require some alterations of the
current manual system.
Using statistics from years past, Morales hypothesized
that part of the problem faced by the CPPC is the recent
overcrowding within the system. She emphasized the
growing number of students utilizing the bid system in
their career searches, citing that liberal arts interviews in
creased from 1,100 to 1,900 in one academic year.
Morales has also noticed a growing number of technical
majors — who do not normally need to participate in the
bid system to secure technical interviews — now using the
bid system to look for non-technical positions.
Morales said the CPPC is well aware of the overcrowd
ing problem but stressed that students can make the dif
ference.
"The stongest thing that can happen is that students let
me know how they feel. Students are the backbone of the
CPPC. I need their support as much as they need my
help."
"The Bid System." To most undergradu
ates it probably sounds like the format for an
antique auction, but for approximately 750
seniors trying to secure a job after gradua
tion, those words could be the key to a new
office door. (Or at least a foot in the door to
their next job interview.)

Feature

The Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter, which sits adjacent to the Bookstore, is
like a second home to most seniors, while the
majority of undergraduates cruise by it daily
without a second glance.
It is here at the CPPC, as it is usually
referred to, where the bid system operates.
And it is here where the old system has un
dergone a new twist in the never-ending en
deavor to help students more capably
prepare for their post-college careers.
The bid system is essentially the fairest
way for the CPPC to determine which of the
many students are able to secure the few
highly-coveted interviews with "non
technical" employers visiting campus. (Non

technical does not refer to the abilities of the
interviewer, it is juai another CPPC term
which indicates that the job positions are
non-technical in nature.)
Each student wishing to interview for the
non-technical positions must open an
"account" at the CPPC at a cost of $15. This
account consists of 1,000 points, with which
each student can bid for upcoming inter
views. The CPPC has stipulated that the
maximum amount a bidder can wager to suc
cessfully secure an interview is 400 points.
The logic behind the bid system is
synonymous with economic theory, accord
ing to Christopher Shinkman, director of the
CPPC.
"One should look upon the bid system as
an economic model. You're spending
money, in effect with your points, so you
have to ask yourself, 'How much is this inter
view really worth?' " Shinkman said.
Obviously, with a maximum bid of 400
points, a bidder competing for highly
demanded interviews could only hope to ob
tain two interviews before using up 800 of
his 1,000 points. This was part of the prob-
lem the CPPC was trying to address when it made some
changes in the bid system policy in January., Now a stu
dent who successfully bids on a schedule will lose only the
points that the lowest succesful bidder wagered, and not
necessarily the full number of points he or she bid initially.
Yolanda Morales, supervisor of recruitment activities at
the CPPC, said that too many students were overcalculat
ing the bid value of an interview with respect to other bid
ders and, as a result, were unnecessarily spending too
many points to obtain an interview. By subtracting the
lowest successful bidder's points, this problem of students
bidding beyond the apparent value of the interview, rela
tive to other bids, would also be eliminated.
Or so they thought.
Morales explained that the new policy is suffering from
a reverse-psychology reaction.
"Students are bidding extremely high," in anticipation
of a lower deduction from their accounts, only to discover
that the lowest successful bid is extremely high as well,
Morales said.
Citing recent cases involving The First Boston Corpora
tion and the Foote, Cone and Belding advertising agency,
wherein every student bid 400 points, Morales said that
staff members had to pull names out of a hat to fairly
compile interview schedules.
Shinkman explained the recent trend of high bidding by
pointing out that, with every change, there inevitably fol
lows an adjustment period.
"1 guess you learn from experience, and that only hap
pens once you get burned like that. From then on you go
back to what the principle of the system is, and that is that
you bid what the interview is worth to you," he said.
Unfortunately, the competetive quality inherent in the
bid system seems to be preventing this "return to princi
ple." The bold sign posted on the central bulletin board in
the CPPC, however, serves as reminder against profligate
bidding practices:
"DO NOT OVERBID. Bidders who wager more
points than they have will have their bids DISQUALI
FIED."
Apparently the new trend is to bid beyond one's point
resources, in anticipation of being underbid. Clever, isn't
it?
Despite such minor problems, Morales said the new
procedure of deducting the lowest successful bid has made
internal operations much more efficient, since the staff
only has to deduct one constant number from each stu
dent's account.

How did this change in the bid system, the first since its
implementation four years ago, come about? Morales said
that student Suggestions were the force behind the
changes just made.
"For over three years we have asked students, through
a survey about the bid system, for what kind of improve
ments they would like to see. The one thing that kept
coming back to us was that they would really like to have
the lowest successful bid removed from all successful bid
ders' accounts," Morales explained.
Stressing that student input and opinion is highly valued
and taken very seriously, Morales said the CPPC is busy
conducting a new survey on the bid system changes.
"We are asking students to give us some feedback and
to let us know how they feel and if they want to go back to
the original system," Morales said.

changing the system, Morales explained that since stu
dents directly experience the flaws in the system, they of
