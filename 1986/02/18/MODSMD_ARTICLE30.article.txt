# Big crowd sees gymnasts fall
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
"If we avoid falls, we'll be in good
shape. We can't afford to miss."
So said Stanford gymnast Gary
S*iith Thursday afternoon, referring
to Saturday night's meet agaittet'Xo.
2 UCLA. However, the Cardinal
didn't avoid mistakes, and they did
miss.
"We had a lot of major mistakes,"
Smith said after the meet.
And as Smith prophesied. Stanford
paid for it, losing the meet and its No.
1 ranking to UCLA, 279.3 to 276.5.
The Bruins' score is the highest in the
nation this season, eclipsing Stan
ford's 278.20, recorded at UCLA last
month.
Afterwards, Stanford Coach Sadao
Hamada predicted Stanford would
drop to No. 2 in the nation, perhaps
No. 3. "It's not really that important,
but I do really like to be on top of the
leader board," he said.
The meet took place in Maples
Pavilion before the largest gymnastics
crowd in Stanford history — over
2,000 awed spectators were on hand
— and featured some of the finest
single-event performances of the
year, including two scores of 9.75 on
the high bar by UCLA's Brian
Ginsberg and David Moriel.
The Bruins' team score on the high
bar was also one of the best in the na
tion at 47.95. The meet failed,
however, to include the finest individ
ual all-around performance in the na
tion, as Ginsberg's 56.2 was 0.8
points shy teammate Rob Campbell's
top mark set at the first Stanford-
UCLA contest.
Campbell was surprisingly inef
fective Saturday, failing to finish in
the top three all-around. "He didn't
look that great," Smith said. "He was
a little off."
Meanwhile, it was Cardinal team
leader Randy Besosa's marred per
formance which exemplified the
team's gymnastics as a whole. Besosa,
now the No. 2 individual gymnast in
the nation, executed well enough in

the events he did not miss to still
finish third all-around with 55.7
points.
But on the floor, on the rings and
on the high bar. Besosa lost between
0.9 and 1.1 points due to three errors.
Besosa's final major miss, on the
high bar. was especially frustrating.
He had just completed several crowd
thrilling one-armed giant arm swings,
when he narrowly missed his release
move.
"1 thought he had it. but he didn't

reach for it," Hamada said of Be
sosa's finai miss.
Overall, the Cardinal had 12 bro
ken routines and 18 major breaks.
Much of those were due, according to
Hamada, to a "great increase in diffi
culty."
Of the Cardinal misses, Besosa
said, "These are things that happen.
As we get further into the season,
we'll get more consistent. . . .You
have so many meets that it is hard to
hit every one perfect."

Although some uncharacteristic mistakes cost Stanford points in Satur
day night's loss to UCLA, Randy Besosa still finished third in the all
around competition with 55.7 points. He is currently the No. 2 gymnast
in the nation.
