# Bennett's 25 spoils 'Seniors' Night'
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
They called it 'Seniors' Night'
yesterday evening at Maples
Pavilion, and, as it turned out, for
good reasons.
Seniors Virginia Sourlis and
Judy Griffith, hoping to beat Cali
fornia for the first time in their
Stanford careers, played their best
basketball of the season.
Sourlis shot a blistering nine
for-14 from the field for a season
high 20 points, while Griffith
scorched the nets on five out of
seven attempts from the floor.

most of them coming from beyond
the 15-foot range.
But California senior Chris
Metzger, along with junior Jenni
fer Bennett, made sure that this
special evening for the two Stan
ford seniors did not have a happy
ending.
The Bears' scoring duo
combined for 45 points as Califor
nia beat the Cardinal 73-69 to ex
tend its winning streak over Stan
ford to eight games.
Last night Stanford employed a
sagging defense to try to contain
the Bears' two leading scorers, but
the Cardinal had minimal success.
"We sagged in off number 24
(point guard Jackie Thomas) so we
could surround Metzger and Ben
nett," Stanford Coach Tara VanDer
veer said. "But we weren't matching
up well, and whenever they isolated
either one, they scored."
The absence of 6-foot-2 Stanford
forward Evon Asforis, who suffered a
left knee strain in practice last Mon
day, was particularly noticeable as
most of Bennett's 25 points came off
of inside post feeds over a smaller
Cardinal lineup.
"Evon's probably our best defen
sive forward," VanDerveer said.
"Having her on the bench hurt us."
An aggressive man-to-man defense
forced some early Bear turnovers,
and, as a result, Stanford jumped out
to an early 15-9 lead. But California's
stronger inside game eventually gave
the Bears a 33-30 lead at the half.
California had the lead throughout
the second half, but with 37 seconds
left in the game, a Jill Yanke 12-
footer after a Sourlis steal brought
the Cardinal within one at 68-67. ;
But two clutch free throws by 5-5
Bear guard Meme Fanner, which
were followed by a pair from
Metzger, clinched the game for Cali
fornia.
