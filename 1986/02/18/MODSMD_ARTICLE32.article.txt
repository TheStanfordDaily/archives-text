# Card outlasts late Lions, gets blanked by Waves
## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
There was a lot of interesting — and well-played — vol
leyball at Maples Pavilion over the weekend, as the No. 4
Stanford men's volleyball team split two matches to go to
6-3 overall and 5-3 in the California Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Association.
Sunday evening the Cardinal faced top-ranked Pep
perdine. The tough defending NCAA champion Waves
came up with a 15-11, 15-8, 15-10 win despite a strong
performance by Stanford.
The squad certainly improved upon its match against
Pepperdine two weeks ago, when the Stanford team hit
ting percentage was only .011, compared to a .446 for the
Waves. At home, the Cardinal had a .225 average to Pep
perdine's .342.
Stanford again played without All-American outside
hitter Jon Root, who has been out for over a week with an
ankle sprain suffered against Long Beach State.
"It feels good," Root said, "but my trainer wouldn't let
me play. I can't land on it yet." He should be ready for
Stanford's next conference game against UCLA a week
from tomorrow.
For the Cardinal, senior Chris Braun scored 20 kills and
sophomore Scott Fortune followed with 18. All-American
Matt Rigg totalled 15 kills and a .323 hitting percentage
for the Waves, while Mark Arnold had 14 kills and a .345
average.
"The team played really well considering we were with
out Root," Fortune said."We would have been in there
with him. Pepperdine has an outstanding starting six;
they're all good players. They are easily number one but
they'll be beatable toward the end."

Rigg essentially agreed. "All our guys are really
healthy. Root's injury was an advantage for us," he said.
"We have a strong team, just as strong as last year."
"We played better tonight," Stanford Co-Coach Don
Shaw said. "We didn't make as many unforced errors. It
was a good match with good plays, but some lapses hurt
us. Overall, it was a strong team effort. Now we can con
centrate on other things."
Fifteenth-ranked Loyola Marymount had problems
even showing up. The Lions' 1:30 p.m. flight was over
booked, and after hours of running back and forth be
tween terminals in the rain, the team found a flight to San
Francisco. Loyola landed at 7:30 — the scheduled starting
time for the match.
Things got underway at 9:15, but there was another
problem. Contrary to what it may have looked like to the
Maples fans in attendance, there weren't two Stanford
teams playing against each other on the court.
The Lions' uniforms were in San Jose with assistant
coach Rich Rosales, who had taken the earlier flight.
Loyola borrowed Stanford uniforms for the match be
cause Rosales didn't show up until 10:30, after being
stranded in San Jose for four hours.
Two hours and five games later, Stanford (the real one)
emerged victorious 12-15, 15-11, 9-15, 15-3, 15-6.
"We can't make excuses," Loyola team captain Matt
Amberson said, "but we were in the airport since noon,
and it wears you out."
"The long delay hurt us more than them," Shaw said.
"It took us awhile to get going."
Nonetheless, the Cardinal got the win, led by Braun (23
kills) and Stephen Blue (21 kills and a .439 hitting
percentage). For the Lions, Craig Cullen had 16 kills.

It was a bad weekend for Stanford basketball against California. Not
only were the men blown out in Berkeley 81-53, but the women failed to
come up with a win on Seniors' Night in Maples Pavilion, losing 73-69.
