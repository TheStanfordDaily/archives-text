## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
After a disappointing performance
Friday at Washington State, the Stan
ford women's gymnastics team came
back against stronger competition
Saturday to post a team-record score
at Washington.
The Cardinal finished behind host
Washington and California Saturday,
but its score of 181.70 established a
new Stanford record for an away
meet. The record was set without the
services of sophomore Alison
McGann, who did not make the trip.
"Saturday, the girls had a great
performance," Stanford Coach
Homer Sardina said. "We were very
consistent. We hit on the even bars
for the first time this season."
Friday at Pullman, the Cardinal
finished second behind Oregon with a
172.30 team score. But the following

day, Stanford hit on all its routines to
surpass the 180 mark for the first
time this season.
Prior to this weekend's meets, Sar
dina had hoped his gymnasts would
be able to reach the 180 figure. "That
was our purpose of going up there,"
he said. "That helped vault us in posi
tion to get to the regionals."
Jinny Rhee turned in a stellar per
formance Saturday for the Cardinal.
The 5-foot-3 freshman finished third
in the all-around with a season-high
37.05 score. Rhee also captured
second place in both the vault and
bars.
"She had an outstanding perfor
mance," Sardina said.
• Freshman Laurence George and
junior Nanci Goldsmith also contrib
uted to the Cardinal cause. George
scored a 9.45 on the balance beam to
finish second, followed by Goldsmith
in third place at 9.40.
