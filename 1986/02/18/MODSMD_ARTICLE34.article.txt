Playing what Stanford Coach
Tim Schaaf called "the poorest
we've played since last year," the
men's golf team reeled to an 18th
place tie with UC-Santa Barbara
in the John Burns Invitational,
which concluded Friday in Oahu,
Hawaii.
Stanford shot 296 as a team in
Friday's third round to finish the
event at 898, exactly 50 strokes
behind tournament winner USC.
USC's victory was somewhat of
an upset considering the presence
of top-ranked Oklahoma State in
the tourney. However, the Cow
boys finished third as USC shot a
six-unaer-par 274 Friday to defeat
Lamar University by 17 strokes

and OSU by 19.
Lamar's Phillip Jonas led the in
dividuals from wire to wire and
survived a final charge by (JSCs
Sam Randolph — who fired a
third-round 68 on the par-70 Ola
Mana Golf Course — to win 206-
207. Arizona State's Bill Mayfair
and USC's Brian Hennnger tied
for third at 209.
Stanford's Carl Wagner also had
a third-round 68, but it only left
him with a tournament total of
221. Brad Geer shot even-par
Friday to tie for the team lead with
Wagner.
Roger Miraglia recorded his
second straight 77 to finish at 226,
while Rich Marik and Don
Walsworth ended up at 230 and
233, respectively.
