## 
### PETER CASTILLO Staff writer 
Going into Friday's dual meet with
San Jose State, Stanford Coach Chris
Horpel knew that a victory hinged
upon the Cardinal's ability to win the
close individual matches.
And it did just that, as Stanford
defeated the Spartans 29-20 after
trailing most of the meet.
It looked bleak for Stanford after
two matches, with San Jose opening
up a 12-0 lead. The Cardinal's Jeff
Bradley (134 pounds) chipped away
at the lead with a 9-2 win over Dave
Love, but 142-pounder Ken Brison
brought the Spartans right back with
a 14-4 win over Mark Alex.
Jeff Hazard, at 150 pounds, helped
lead the Stanford charge with a criti
cal 6-3 decision over Shane Baum.
The Cardinal comeback continued

with Pete Rogers (158 pounds)
routing Matt Toves 16-4.
Stanford took a one-point lead, 17-
16, when 167-pounder Dave Lee put
on a wrestling clinic at the expense of
Jeff Profio. registered an 18-2
technical fall, as Profio spent most of
his time with his face ground into the
mat. But Jack Norton gave San Jose
Slate the lead right back, 20-17, by
defeating Eric Harber 12-4.
Because the Spartans did not bring
a heavyweight wrestler, Kurt Kas
sulke was moved down to 190 pounds
to meet Scott Benson.
Benson had to win to give San Jose
a tie, and if he won by over eight
points, the Spartans would get four
team points and the victory. For the
second time in two weeks, Kassulke
secured the Cardinal victory in grand
fashion by pinning Benson 1:21 into
the second period.
