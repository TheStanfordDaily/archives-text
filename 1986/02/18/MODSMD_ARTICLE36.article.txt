U.S. envoy hears Marcos, Aquino
MANILA, Philippines— White House envoy Philip Habib met sepa
rately yesterday with President Ferdinand Marcos and opposition leader
Corazon Aquino and won praise from both for not presenting a U.S.
plan to solve the Philippine political crisis.
President Reagan sent Habib to Manila on what he said was a fact
finding mission, and the Philippine government and the opposition were
both clearly surprised when it turned out to be just that.
Marcos, in a statement issued by the presidential palace, said that
Habib assured him that he "was not interested in any way in telling us
how to run our affairs."
Also in the Phillipines, the Central Bank yesterday declared that the
nation's economy is headed for roaring inflation and increased the inter
est rate on treasury bills to 30 percent from 19 percent in a drastic effort
to soak up billions of pesos spent by the government during Marcos'
recent re-election campaign.
Calling it "strong medicine" for the nation, Jose Fernandez, the
bank's governor, said the increase in the interest rate was needed to halt
a decline in the value of the nation's currency and head off a renewed
surge of double-digit inflation. Independent economic analysts have said
both problems are a direct result of large expenditures for bribes paid for
votes throughout the nation by Marcos' ruling party during the campaign
for the Feb. 7 presidential election.
Common Market seeks amendments
LUXEMBOURG — After more than a year of wrangling and
negotiation, nine of the 12 governments of the European Common Mar
ket yesterday signed a series of amendments to the 1958 Treaty of Rome
designed to reinforce their unity and improve their decision-making
process.
The remaining three, Denmark, Italy and Greece, declined to sign.
The Danish Parliament has rejected the amendments because they go
too far, while the Italian Parliament is against them because they do not
go far enough. The Greeks are again registering their independence with
maneuverings by Premier Andreas Papandreou.
Final ratification of the amendments, which must be accepted by all
the member states to become effective, remains uncertain. But
the general feeling at yesterday's signing ceremony was that, in the end,
all members will fall into line, although probably not before the end of
this year.
The states whose ministers signed yesterday were France, West Ger
many, Britain, Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland, Spain and Por
tugal, the last two states having joined the Common Market only last
month.
The amendments will be the first changes in the Rome Treaty since
the founding of the Common Market nearly 28 years ago. The principal
changes involve dropping a requirement for unanimous consent in the
market's decision making, adopting a simple majority system instead,
and a modest powers granted to the European Parliament.
The market communities are now also committed to sweep away the
last of their internal market barriers by 1992, and a small secretariat is to
be set up to improve coordination of foreign policy problems.
S. African youths clash with police
ALEXANDRA, South Africa — Mobs of black youths yesterday
opened fire on police and rampaged through this black township in the
heart of Johannesburg's all-white suburbs in one of the worst episodes of
racial violence to hit this country in several months.
There was also a shootout in a township near Port Elizabeth in which
two black men suspected of being members of the outlawed African Na
tional Congress were killed and two policemen wounded, according to
the police.
In Alexandra, a black police sergeant was shot dead and his corpse
burned and mutilated, and another was wounded by gunfire, police re
ported. They said three black males, two of them under 18, were shot
dead by police.
But witnesses said they saw four other policemen and soldiers shot,
three of them whites. They also said a mob gasoline-bombed an armored
police vehicle early yesterday morning and stole two automatic rifles. A
police spokesman denied these accounts.
Israelis fail to rescue two captives
JERUSALEM — Hundreds of Israeli troops supported by helicopters
and armored vehicles poured across the border into Lebanon in an ap
parently unsuccessful search for two Israeli soldiers captured in a guer
rilla ambush, Israeli and U.N. military sources said yesterday.
The Syrian-supported National Resistance Front, an umbrella group
opposed to continued Israeli control over a security zone in South
Lebanon, claimed responsibility for seizing the two men. It said it would
soon disclose its demands for their release.
The Israeli military command in Tel Aviv said two members of the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army were killed in the ambush and that
another apparently was captured along with the Israelis.
Portugal elects Socialist president
LISBON, Portugal — Socialist Mario Soares, counted out of Por
tuguese politics by many analysts only four months ago, climaxed an ex
traordinary comeback Sunday by defeating a favored conservative can
didate to become the first civilian president of Portugal in 60 years.
In an extremely close race, Soares, 6j, a prime minister three times
and the best known Portuguese politician outside Portugal, defeated
Diogo Freitas do Amaral, 44, a law professor and Christian Democrat.
Official returns from all but 74 of the country's 4,138 precincts gave
Soares 3,000,663 votes, or 51.37 percent of the total, and Freitas do
Amaral 2,841.054 votes, or 48.63 percent.
The results proved again that the voters of Portugal, an impoverished
country that overthrew a dictatorship almost 12 years ago, still feel too
leftist to accept a conservative leader, no matter how modern his image.
In a victory statement, Soares, who had fought the old dictatorship for
many years, said the election, in which both candidates were civilians,
marked "the end of the transitional phase of democracy in Portugal."
Using conciliatory tones, Soares said he intended to act as "a force for
political stability and social peace." He insisted that he would no longer
look on himself as a Socialist leader, but "I will be the president of all the
Portuguese."
Iraq pushes back Iranian invasion
BAGHDAD. Iraq — Iraq reported a slow advance yesterday against
invading Iranian forces as Iran claimed knocking out Iraq's radar
facilities in the northern Persian Gulf.
An Iraqi military communique said a counter-attack covered by
hundreds of air and missile strikes had progressed 500 yards on the
northern flank. 600 yards in the center and more than one mile along the
northern Gulf coast.
Iran said it had blocked the counter-attack, destroying two battalions
from the fifth armored division and hitting European-supplied radar in
stallations.
Iraq, officially confirming that ground-to-ground missiles were being
used, said a "circle of fire" was being tightened around the Iranian inva
sion force which occupied the Gulf port of Faw eight days ago.
Meanwhile, in Tehran, Iranian Prime Minister Mir Hussein Musavi
said Iran will reject any U.N. resolution which "fail to condemn the Iraqi
regime for starting the war or defend it directly or indirectly."
The U.N. Security Council is to hold an emergency session today on
the growing crisis in the Gulf.
