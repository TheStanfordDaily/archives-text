## Storms bring havoc to Bay Area 
### 
Hundreds of people were evacuated yesterday as
torrential storms lashed Northern California for the
sixth day, triggering mudslides, pushing rivers
beyond their banks and closing major highways.
Forecasters predicted the ruin would continue at
least through Friday.
A roekslide buried all lanes of Interstate 80 at
Truckee, and California Department of Transpor
tation officials said it could be three days before the
highway, the major trans-Sierra route in Northern
California, would be re-opened.
The road is the main route for skiers traveling to
Lake Tahoe and Squaw Valley resorts. The acci
dent means skiers would have to detour around the
lake into Nevada to make it out of the mountains, a
CalTrans official said.
Driving rains and winds of up to 100 mph ham
pered the efforts of relief workers, including Na
tional Guard units mobilized to help with evacua
tions and sandbagging, in Napa and Sonoma
counties, where as much*as three inches of rain fell
in six hours yesterday morning.
"There's so much water coming down and the
ground is saturated," said Napa County Under
sheriff Arthur Thompson. "There's no place tor it
to go."
In some areas, mudslides covered roads and

threatened hillside houses. Santa Cruz County
authorities suspended their search for a woman
whose home was buried in a mudslide because of
fear that workers could be lost in further slides.
The storms already had claimed one life. The
Santa Cruz County woman and a man in Concord
were listed as missing.
In hard-hit Guerneville, where hundreds were
forced to flee their homes over the weekend, offi
cials yesterday used boats to carry blankets, food
and medical supplies to residents stranded in an
evacuation shelter surrounded by floodwaters, said
assistant Sonoma County administrator Mike Crys
tal.
The National Weather Service said the Russian
River was at 42 feet, about 10 feet above Hood
stage. The Napa River crested at a record 27.6 feet,
more than two feet above flood stage, at Napa.
About 400 people had been evacuated from
mobile home parks and houses near the river in the
Napa and Yountville areas, Thompson said. He es
timated that 1,000 people would be moved to
evacuation shelters.
Businesses in downtown Napa sandbagged their
doors in preparation for the flood waters. National
Guard units helped residents move to higher
ground.

Another National Guard unit was on standby in
Tehama County where communities were threat
ened by the rising Sacramento River.
Flash flood warnings were in effect lor most
counties in Northern California yesterday as the
latest storm pushed its way inland. Rain fell at
higher-than-normal elevations in the Sierra
Nevada, melting snow and triggering increased
runoff. At the highest elevations, more than nine
feet of snow was reported to have fallen in the past
few days.
The storms were accompanied by high winds that
reached up to 100 mph in mountain areas. The
winds downed power lines and blew trees onto
houses in several areas, although no deaths or
serious injuries were reported.
Pacific Gas and Electric Company spokeswoman
Faith KraVner said between 12,000 and 15,000 cus
tomers were without power yesterday and about
2,000 workers were trying to repair downed lines.
However, she said new outages were occurring
nearly as rapidly as repairs could be made.
Ski resorts in the Sierra Nevadas, which were
lamenting the lack of snow only last month, were
forced to cut back their operations yesterday be
cause of avalanche danger. Wind-caused power
failures idled lifts and poor road conditions kept
skiers from reaching the slopes.
