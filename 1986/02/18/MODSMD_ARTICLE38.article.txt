# France blames Libya for bombing
## 
### 
PARIS â€” A Soviet-built Tupolev
-22 aircraft, said by France to belong
to Libya, yesterday bombed the air
port in N'Djamena, the capital of
Chad, in apparent retaliation for a
French raid against a Libyan-built
airport in northern Chad.
French Defense Minister Paul
Quiles later announced that France
was sending a "deterrent force" to
Chad following a new offensive by
Libyan-backed rebels against the
government of President Hissene
Habre.
About 200 French air commandos
arrived in N'Djamena over the
weekend to supervise the flow of mil
itary supplies to the government
troops and defend the airport.
Military analysts here said yester
day's moves brought France and
Libya closer than ever before to a
direct military confrontation over
Chad. The two countries have backed
opposite sides in the 20-year-old civil
war in Chad, a French colony until
1960.
Quiles dismissed yesterday'?

bombing raid by a "Libyan Tupolev,"
flying at 15,000 feet, as ineffective,
saying that only one bomb had fallen
on the runway.
He said the "limited damage"
would not prevent French planes
from continuing to land at the airport,
Chad's main point of entry from the
outside world.
The Defense Ministry later said
two Mirage F-l fighters and a Jaguar
plane had arrived at N'Djamena air
port yesterday afternoon, to join four
Jaguars already there. The airport
remained closed to heavy aircraft in
cluding passenger liners.
In Tripoli, the official Libyan news
agency Jana attributed the air raid to
Chadian rebel forces led by former
President Goukouni Oueddei. That
assertion, however, was discounted
by military analysts here, who said
Goukouni's forces have no Tupolevs.
The bombing raids coincided with
the opening in Paris of the first sum
mit meeting of the world's French
speaking countries, with leaders of 42
states, including former French

colonies in Africa.
The leaders of several French
speaking countries in West Africa
have urged France to take tough ac
tion against what they see as the
threat of aggression from Libya.
French officials said the new
"dissuasive force" in Chad would
consist primarily of air force units sta
tioned in N'Djamena. The aim, ac
cording to military specialists, is to
reduce the risk of casualties to French
troops while increasing the ability to
respond flexibly to renewed attacks
by the Libyan-backed rebels.
France has accused Libya of pro
viding vital logistical support for last
week's rebel offensive across the 16th
Parallel, known as the "red line,"
which Paris has pledged to defend.
In the view of some observers, the
bombing raids form part of an elabo
rate game of psychological and mili
tary bluff involving French President
Francois Mitterrand and Libya's
leader, Col. Moammar Khadafy. The
assumption here is that neither
France nor Libya has an interest in

getting dragged into an all-out con
frontation over Chad.
With just a month to go before
legislative elections in France, Mit
terrand's decision to bomb a Libyan
built airfield at Ouadi Doum has gen
erally been supported by right-wing
opposition parties that are usually
quick to criticize him. The only signif
icant point of criticism so far has been
that the government should have
taken tough action sooner.
According to the Defense Ministry,
the landing strip was damaged in six
places during Sunday's bombing raid
by low-flying French Jaguar aircraft
stationed in the Central African
Republic.
Quiles said that "40 bombs" had
reached their target despite anti
aircraft fire from Soviet-made SA-6
missiles.
In March 1984. U.S. officials
blamed Libya for the bombing, by a
lone warplane, of a radio transmitter
in Omdurman, Sudan, that was being
used by anti-Kfiadafv forces.
