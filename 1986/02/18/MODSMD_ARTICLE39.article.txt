Debris may be booster
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — Photographs of
underwater debris believed to be part of the
space shuttle Challenger's right solid rocket
booster were flown to the Marshall Space Flight
Center at Huntsville, Ala., yesterday to be ex
amined by rocketry experts.
Engineers at Marshall, which oversees con
struction of the boosters, will be able to deter
mine whether the debris is that of the rocket
suspected of causing the explosion that destroyed
Challenger, killing all seven crew members, Jan.
28.
Other officials of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration are examining small pieces
of the debris picked up by a small, deep-diving
submarine Saturday in 1,200 feet of water 40
miles east of Cape Canaveral.
"The pieces that they picked up are not imme
diately identifiable as being part of an SRB (solid
rocket booster)," NASA spokesman Hugh Har
ris said. As a result, it probably will be at least
tomorrow before a positive identification is
made, he said.
The discovery could provide the most impor
tant clue to date to the cause of the explosion.
Photographs of the launch show a puff of black
smoke and, later, a plume of fiery gases emanat
ing from the right booster 58 seconds after liftoff.
It is possible that through photographs of the
debris the experts will be able to locate the
source of any leak in the booster, making it un

necessary to retrieve the pieces from the deep
ocean waters, Harris said.
"It's very deep water and there's a significant
current there, so it's going to be difficult to
retrieve them," he said.
Meanwhile, a rocket expert called in by NASA
six days after the Challenger explosion said yes
terday that NASA scientists knew at the time he
was called what caused the disaster.
"My opinion is (that) the scientific people I
talked to knew exactly what happened, and get
ting it approved through their superiors is what's
taking so long," said Henry Shuey, a military
consultant for 40 years who is considered one of
the nation's leading authorities on solid rocket
motors.
Shuey said he was called by NASA as a consul
tant Feb. 3. "They laid out all the data for me,
and it made perfect sense," Shuey said.
While Shuey said he could not be specific
about the cause, the basic problem was "clearly
an aft segment joint leak (in the right booster
rocket). It sealed up and leaked again."
Tylenol capsules aborted
NEW YORK — Johnson & Johnson, in a diffi
cult $1 50 million marketing decision, announced
yesterday that it no longer will produce or sell
Tylenol or any other over-the-counter medicine
in capsule form because it cannot guarantee the
products' safety.

"We feel the company can no longer guarantee
the safety of capsules to a degree consistent with
Johnson & Johnson's standards of responsibility
to its consumers," James Burke, the company's
chairman, told a news conference at the com
pany's New Brunswick, N.J., headquarters near
here.
Nine days ago, cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules
killed a 23-year-old Peekskill, N.Y., woman. A
second bottle of Tylenol capsules poisoned with
cyanide subsequently was found in a store just
two blocks from the supermarket where the first
bottle was purchased.
"Johnson & Johnson will no longer
manufacture or sell any capsule products made
directly available to the consumer, and we have
no plans to re-enter this business for the
foreseeable future," Burke said.
In Washington, Food and Drug Administra
tion Commissioner Frank Young said, "This ac
tion taken by Johnson & Johnson was a matter of
its own business judgment and it represents re
sponsible action taken under tough circum
stances."
But Young called it "premature" to discuss
whether other pharmaceutical companies also
should stop the production of over-the-counter
medicine in capsule form.
"We think Johnson & Johnson did what they
had to do," said John Walden, a spokesman for
the Proprietary Association, which represents 83
companies in the United States that make more
than 95 percent of medicines sold without
prescriptions.
