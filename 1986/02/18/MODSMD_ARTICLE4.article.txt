One of the problems of euring
alcoholism is that doctors under
stand little about how treatment
works effectively, according to a
co-chairman of the Stanford
Medical School's second annual
Conference on Alcoholism Friday.
More than 150 physicians, fam
ily therapists, psychologists and al
cohol and drug counselors came
from as far away as Long Beach
and Los Angeles to learn about
new approaches to improving the
effectiveness of alcohol and drug
treatment.
The day-long conference, held
in the Catnino Room at Hyatt

Rickeys in Palo Alto, included
presentations by eight guest fac
ulty from Stanford, UC-Berkeley,
UC-San Francisco and several Bay
Area hospitals.
Problems with alcohol affect an
estimated 70 million people
nationwide, and doctors have only
limited understanding of treat
ment effectiveness, according to
conference co-chairman Dr.
William Hazle. medical director of
the Stanford Alcohol Clinic.
"One of the problems of treat
ment is that we don't know what
kind of treatment to use; we don't
know what happens in treatment
— how it works — and we don't
know what happens after the
treatment," Hazle said.
The conference, which was
sponsored by the Department
of Psychiatry and the Stanford
Alcohol Clinic, was designed as
"a forum in which to discuss
these issues," Hazle said.
In a 45-minute speech fol
lowing lunch, Dr. Stephanie
Brown, who is the founder of
the Stanford Alcohol Clinic,
outlined four stages of the
dynamic model of alcoholism
recovery. Stressing the impor
tance of "breaking down the
thinking which sustains" al
coholics' "denial" of their de
pendency, Brown challenged
the common notion that al
coholism may be secondary to
marriage or other personal
problems.
Brown, who serves as the
clinic's program consultant,
said it is common for Stanford
students who are children of al
coholics to come to the clinic
for help.
More than 30 percent of the
clinic's patients are University
employees or students, and the
clinic is tailored to confiden
tiality, Brown said.
