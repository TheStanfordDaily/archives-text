LOS ANGELES — Waves of up to I 2 feet
gnawed at the Southern California coast yester
day, sucking tons of sand to sea as the region

Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu. and residents
in fire-scarred regions of Ventura County
shoveled debris and reorganized sand bags.

reopened about 4 p.m. yesterday, with California
Highway Patrol officers escorting cars on sections

Emerald Bay drowned after waves apparently
carried him into the sea. A surfer drowned Sun
day amid crashing waves in Hermosa Beach, and
a San Diego man who stood too close to the
shore was swept away by the heavy surf.

the next in a series of storms that have drenched
the region the past week.
