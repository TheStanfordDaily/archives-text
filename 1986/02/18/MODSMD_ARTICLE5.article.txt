# University purchases Baron books

### NANCY HENRY Staff writer 
The University has acquired a collection of
nearly 20,000 scholarly volumes on Jewish history,
culture and religion that "overnight puts Stanford
on the map as far as Jewish studies goes," accord
ing to English Prof. John Felstiner.
Stanford purchased the collection from Salo Witt
mayer Baron, an eminent scholar of Jewish his
tory. The Baron Collection is widely acknowledged
as the largest and finest private library of such
works in the United States.
The collection includes Hebrew editions of the
Bible dating from the 15th century, rare volumes of
Jewish literature and history from Eastern Europe
and around the world, and hundreds of volumes on
Jewish Americana. In addition, there are works on
Jewish anthropology and sociology and thousands
of pamphlets and journals.
The library also includes Baron's own publica
tions and the personal research files he used to
write his 18-volume "Social and Religious History
of the Jews."

According to Felstiner, who teaches Jewish
literature, the Baron Collection is "a truly priceless
resource" that constitutes "not a secondary
resource, but a primary source."
The acquisition of this collection is particularly
important "in order to have as much leverage as
possible" in the appointment of a leading scholar to
the new Daniel E, Koshland endowed chair in
Jewish culture and history, according to Brigitta
Carnochan, development officer at Green Library.
The University will annouce the appointment to
the Koshland professorship later this year.
Felstiner said that in addition to major scholars,
the Baron Collection should help attract graduate
students in Jewish studies, and possibly lead to the
establishment of a "Jewish studies program, on the
feminist studies model."
The purchase of the collection is possible due
largely to the generosity of the Jewish Community
Endowment Fund of the Jewish Community Feder
ation of San Francisco, the Peninsula and Marin
and Sonoma Counties, and to contributions from
the family of Tad Taube, a Stanford graduate and
prominent real estate investor.
Taube is also leading a fund-raising campaign for

the final portion of the purchase price of the collec
tion, which is valued at $1 million.
Carnochan said half of the collection is already at
Stanford, with the rest expected to arrive this
spring. In May, the University plans "major
celebratory events" in conjunction with the ac
quisition and the announcement of the Koshland
appointment. Baron, who is currently professor of
Jewish culture and history at Columbia University,
has been invited to speak along with visiting lectur
ers from the Jewish Community Federation and
others.
Carnochan said the collection will be known as
the Taube-Baron Collection and selections from it
will be on continuous display in the Field Room at
Green Library. Eventually, certain exceptionally
rare books will remain on display, while the rest
will be kept in locked stacks.
Felstiner commented that the Taube-Baron Col
lection will certainly "make an immense difference
in bringing significant scholars of the Jewish experi
ence to Stanford."
"Jewish studies has been a latent field" at the
University, and the Koshland chair and the new
collection will "help wake it up," he said.
