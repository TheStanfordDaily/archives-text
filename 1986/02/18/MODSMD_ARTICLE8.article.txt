# Prof, checks poem's stats

### MARC GUICHARD 
According to a statistical test con
ducted here, William Shakespeare
may indeed have written "Shall I die?
Shall I fly?," a recently discovered
sonnet whose authorship has sparked
controversy in many literary circles.
The test, developed by Statistics
Prof. Bradley Efron with the help of a
former student, Ronald Thisted, uses
all of Shakespeare's known works as
a model to predict how many times —
if at all — each word of a new work
will be repeated in other works.
Discovered last November in Ox
ford's Bodleian Library by American
researcher Gary Taylor, "Shall I die?
Shall I fly?" has been cataloged for
300 years at Bodleian as "attributed"
to Shakespeare.
In their analysis of "Shall I die?
Shall I fly?," Efron and Thisted
predicted that the 430-word poem
should have 6.97 (plus or minus 2.64)
words which have never been found
in all of Shakespeare's other works;
4.21 (plus or minus 2.05) words
found only once before; and 3.33
(plus or minus 1.83) words found in
his works twice previously.
In the Efron analysis, a "repeated"
word is one that has been found in
one of Shakespeare's other works.
"Shall I die? Shall I fly?" contains

nine new words, seven repeated once
before and five repeated twice.
Efron has carried the analysis to
words repeated 100 times and has
found the "poem keeps coming out
beautifully."
But Ron Rebholz, a Stanford En
glish professor and Shakespeare ex
pert, said he feels there are problems
with using Efron's statistical method
to determine authorship of the poem.
First, Rebholz said he questions the
accuracy of the test because the text
itself may not be accurate. He said
"Shall I die? Shall I fly?" was found
in a type of collection whose editors
often changed or omitted words or
even occasionally whole lines.
Secondly, Rebholz said the test
relies only on word count, and does
not consider context. He said the
poem contains words and phrases
that are used many times by Shake
speare, but never in the context in
which they are found in "Shall I die?
Shall I fly?" For example, in one line
of the poem, the author uses the word
"lust" to refer to his love. Rebholz
said Shakespeare never uses "lust" in
that context.
When Efron first read the poem, he
said he thought it didn't sound any
thing like the Bard.
But after analyzing it, Efron said,
"it passes our tests rather nicely.

Make of it what you will. [But] when
the statistical projection is very close,
then we are left to assume that it is
possible that Shakespeare wrote it.
That is all we are saying."
Efron added, "We think it is rather
uncanny that the poem passes all the
statistical tests. We never thought it
would. We were biased from the
start."
Trying to foil their test, Efron and
Thisted analyzed poems by John
Donne, Ben Jonson and Christo
pher Marlowe as if they were works
possibly by Shakespeare. The test de
termined that none of the poems
was written by the Bard.
The discovery of "Shall I die? Shall
I fly" did not prompt Efron and
Thisted's interest in Shakespeare.
About 10 years ago Efron, while at a
statistics lecture at UC-Santa Bar
bara, was told that Marvin Spevack of
Westfalische Wilhelms-Universitat in
Munster had put all of Shakespeare's
works into a computer data-base. Just
for fun, Efron and Thisted decided to
try to figure out how many words
Shakespeare knew but did not use.
They determined if a new work was
ever found, they could predict how
many new words it would contain.
Efron and Thisted plan to write an
article for a statistics journal on their
analysis of "Shall I die? Shall 1 fly."
