We Want to Know What
You Think About The Best
Darn Police Force In This
Whole Crazy World
This is nutty — I hate to even bring this up, really I do —
but it seems like there are some people out there who seem
to somehow suggest that the police aren't always perfect.
Isn't that just like some people, always saying things that
aren't very nice just to draw attention to themselves?
Would you like to set these bad apples straight and let us
know about all the times that Stanford Police have helped
you across the street, opened the car door for you, predicted
sunny weather and so forth? Great! That would really be
swell. Start with a nice, fresh piece of paper. Write out your
name, the date, your address, phone number, and the best
time that we can reach you. Then simply describe the inci
dent.
Here is an example: Name: Tina Lovely. Date: February
14th. Address: 32 Happy Lane, Stanford. Phone: 497-1468.
Best Time to Reach: Rainy Days and Mondays. Incident: "The
other day I was stopped by a police officer. He told me that 1
was looking a little down, and asked if I would perhaps
enjoy a chocolate bunny. When I said that I would indeed,
he gave me one. I thanked him, and he said not to mention
it. He then proceeded to bring several heinous criminals to
justice. Thank you."
If you are a "bad apple" yourself, and due to some emo
tional trauma suffered in your youth somehow think that
the police have done something wrong, you can go ahead
and write that down too, though of course we will have to
consider your obviously disturbed mental state. C'mon,
everybody — let's say all those nice things we've been sav
ing up! We're going to show the whole collection to the
University Admnistration and prove to them once and for
all that the idea of a Police Review Board is just silly.
YOUR INVITATION Sports 25
TO A VERY BIG
BIRTHDAY
PARTY! If you have an honor I
student card your father
buy» you a »port» car.
Look who's turning 100! Sure enough, it's the short little
kid that lives in that red-tile stucco ranch house on the west
side of town, Leland Stanford Junior University. Hurrah!
And to celebrate, we're looking for people who know how
to party in a big way. All sorts of centennial activities are in
the works and student input is wanted right away. Pull out
your cardinal party hat and grab hold of some party favors
while you run down to the ASSU offices and fill out an ap
plication with the Nominations Commission (They just love
to say "Let's Have Fun!"). Be there.
