NOT GOING BANKRUPT
IS NICE
Something nice happened this winter. The student body
voted to suggest that the ASSU divest its money from com
panies doing business in South Africa — South Africa is not
nice, and as such we shouldn't be supporting apartheid
through investment. This is all well and good, of course, but
there's a hitch. That hitch is this, not going bankrupt is nice,
too.
The Senate holds the pursestrings to more than a million
dollars (Well! that is a lot!), and is tied down to a certain
extent by something called "fiduciary responsibility." Can
you say that? I hope so. Fiduciary responsibiliy means that
simply taking money out of companies doing business in
South Africa is not enough. We've got to review things like
our abiliy to manage our own funds, investment alterna
tives (are there other, nicer companies out there that aren't
doing business in South Africa?), just how mean individual
companies are, and so forth. This is all going to occur in the
first weeks of spring quarter under the auspices of the Sub
committee on Divestment. So do a senator a favor: tell him
just what you think about the whole affair. Here's a poten
tial something that you might say to your senior: "Do
what's nice." It's just a suggestion.
Let Us ASSURE You!
Who wants to ride in a silly old bus, anyway? Certainly
not me, especially with this sunny springy weather. That's
why the Senate has decided to discontinue ASSURE shuttle
service after this quarter. Let's take a walk on the sunny
side! Okay, who would like to make a gentleperson's bet
about when Lake Lag (That's Lagunita for you frosh!) will
fill up? Hey, maybe it will fill up with lemonade! Yay, it's
Fro-Yo Co-Po Flo-Mo So-Ho Ho-Ho weather!
EVERYONE IS FRIENDS!
The Council of Presidents (your friends), the Senate (also your
friends), and the people at el Centro Chicano (even more friends
for you — my, aren't we the nopular one?) invite you to an open
forum to discuss a new version of the ASSU Constitution. Change
is good. Open forums are good. Life is good. Come to El Centro to
night (Feb. 19) at 7 pm, and give us your ideas. Ideas are good. Ev
erything is good.
NO ONE LIKES AN
ARGUMENT!
Arguments are no fun! Why can't everyone be friends?
Friends are nice. But even friends disagree sometimes.
That's why God invented democracy (di-'mak-ra-se). The
best thing to do when friends can't agree is to take a vote.
The Senate takes lots of votes. Sometimes it takes something
called a roll call vote ('rol 'kol 'vot). The Senate took four of
those at its last meeting. The first was on ammending
KZSU's fee request from $54,667 to $60,333. That failed
10-9-1 (it needed 13 to pass. Too bad!) The second was on
whether to divide the Daily's request. (Division is like mul
tiplication in reverse!) That passed 14-6. The third was on
whether to put the Glee Club on the ballot. I like Glee! That
passed 16-4. The last vote was on whether to put the Police
Review Board on the ballot. (Police are nice!) That passed
13-4-4, with Senate Chair Carey White casting the deciding
vote. Good for him!

about when Lake Lag (That's Lagunita for you frosh!) will
fill up? Hey, maybe it will fill up with lemonade! Yay, it's
Fro-Yo Co-Po Flo-Mo So-Ho Ho-Ho weather!
EVERYONE IS FRIENDS!
The Council of Presidents (your friends), the Senate (also your
friends), and the people at el Centro Chicano (even more friends
for you — my, aren't we the nopular one?) invite you to an open
forum to discuss a new version of the ASSU Constitution. Change
is good. Open forums are good. Life is good. Come to El Centro to
night (Feb. 19) at 7 pm, and give us your ideas. Ideas are good. Ev
erything is good.
NO ONE LIKES AN
ARGUMENT!
Arguments are no fun! Why can't everyone be friends?
Friends are nice. But even friends disagree sometimes.
That's why God invented democracy (di-'mak-ra-se). The
best thing to do when friends can't agree is to take a vote.
The Senate takes lots of votes. Sometimes it takes something
called a roll call vote ('rol 'kol 'vot). The Senate took four of
those at its last meeting. The first was on ammending
KZSU's fee request from $54,667 to $60,333. That failed
10-9-1 (it needed 13 to pass. Too bad!) The second was on
whether to divide the Daily's request. (Division is like mul
tiplication in reverse!) That passed 14-6. The third was on
whether to put the Glee Club on the ballot. I like Glee! That
passed 16-4. The last vote was on whether to put the Police
Review Board on the ballot. (Police are nice!) That passed
13-4-4, with Senate Chair Carey White casting the deciding
vote. Good for him!
