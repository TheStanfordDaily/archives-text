DREAMS COME TRUE!
When you were a child, and your parents' friends asked
you what you wanted to be when you grew up, did you
ever say, "President!"? Well, now your dream can come
true!
The campaign to rule ASSU Land is about to begin. You
can become a member of the Council of Presidents, the Se
nate, the Student Conduct and Legislative Committee, or
Senior Class Presidents. It can happen!
Skip on over to the ASSU offices and pick up petitions and
campaign handbooks. You'll need to turn in completed pet
itions, declarations of intent, and Elections Handbook
statements by Friday, March 7, at 4:00 pm. Remember, the
early bird catches the worm, so get started now. Good luck
everybody!
OH NO!
NO COURSE GUIDE?!!
The best thing about the Senate is vote time, because
that's when we all get to cooperate and decide things (we
cooperated so much this last meeting that we all had a
whoopie-yay good time with a cooler of pop! (hey, did we
bring food or drink into a classroom? OOoooopsie daisies
waisies!) We all thought the Grape Nehi was the best, but it
was so cold, it tickled our collective noses!
Well, anyways, we all cooperated and voted to discon
tinue the Course Guide. But that's OKAY! We all know what
classes are best to prepare us for our professional futures!
Besides, and anyways, too, the Guide will probably come
back next year, and we bet it will be even funnier than in
the past! C'mon Fuzzies! and Techies! let's still go to our
classes, 0.K.?
A Poem for You
Oh! Dating,
Let's while away the hours
in the sunny showers M
along the shores of Oh! So beautiful Lake Lag.
By the first day of spring quarter,
we'll be swimming like an otter
along the shores of Oh! So beautiful Lake Lag.
And what better thing to do fk
than to paddle our smooth canoe
along the shores of Oh! So beautiful Lake Lag.
And it might not even be too hard
to be a rugged lifeguard v
along the shores of Oh! So beautiful Lake Lag.
But then again next year.
When they dredge your body-etrt e4-t4*e muddy gee-,
and find that I murdered yew
along the shores of Oh! So beautiful Lake Lag
they'll probably be pissed off.
So. ... if you're interested in working at Lake Lagunita in
any capacity give Andy Cohen a call at 497-3735. And have
some fun along the shores of Oh! So beautiful Lake Lag.
THE SENATE IS NICE!
The Senate did the right thing about every special fee re
quest. Here is a summary of the action taken so far on each
request â€” but since the Senate is elected to protect your
best interests, there's really no reason to look over the list, is
there? But we print it anyway, because that's our job. It's
important to do your job!
