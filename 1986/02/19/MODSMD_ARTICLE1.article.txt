Former vice presidential candidate
Geraldine Ferraro will speak at
Memorial Auditorium Feb. 24 at
7:30 p.m., according to Speakers
Bureau Director Dixon Osburn.
Tickets for the speech will cost $2
for students and $4 dollars for non
students, including faculty and staff.
They will go on sale today at the
ASSU Lecture Notes office in Tresid
der Union on a first-come, first
served basis. An interpreter for the
deaf will be available at the speech.
Osburn predicted that tickets for
the 1,700-seat Memorial Auditorium
will sell quickly, since Ferraro and
presidential candidate Walter
Mondale received more than three
fourths of the Stanford community's
vote in the 1984 presidential election.
The Speakers Bureau estimated
that expenses for Ferraro's visit will
be more than $15,000, including
honoraria, travel expenses and adver
tising. Several on-campus groups, in
cluding Stanford-in-Government, the
Women's Center and the Law Forum
have donated funds toward subsidiz
ing the visit.
In addition, the Stanford Park
Hotel has offered free accommoda
tions for Ferraro, but the Speakers
Bureau estimated it would need
ticket sales of nearly $4,000 to meet
its budgetary restrictions after ad
vancing $10,000 for the event.
The senate approved the visit by a
vote of 16-0, with two abstentions.
A former congressional represen
tative from New York, Ferraro was
the first woman to run for vice presi
dent of the United States. She is the
author of the book "Ferraro, My

The Speakers Bureau encouraged
Ferraro to speak at Stanford after it
learned she would be coming to the
Bay Area on other business, accord
ing to Osburn.
