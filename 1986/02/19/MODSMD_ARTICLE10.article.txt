# Hoover fellow applauds AIA

Critics of Accuracy in Academia
(AIA), an organization seeking to
discourage left-wing professors
from "propagandizing ideas in
stead of teaching," are protesting
efforts to solve problems of bias in
the classroom and ignoring the
problem itself, according to
Thomas Sowed, a senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution.
Writing in the January-
February issue of an AIA publica
tion, The Campus Report, Sowell
cited "a growing prostitution of
the classroom to political crusades
â€” environmentalism, the an
tinuclear movement, the endless
other causes that engage
academics."
AIA has fallen under harsh
criticism since it was formed last
summer. The Wahington, D.C.-
based organization uses students

interested in the organization as
classroom monitors. The group at
tempts to validate the student's
criticism of a professor by contact
ing the instructor in question, ac
cording to Executive Director Les
Csorba. Results are published in a
newsletter.
The stated objective of AIA is
to report dishonest practices such
as offering a course which appears
in a college catalog as a history of
social theories but turns out to be
a propaganda barrage for nuclear
disarmament.
Stanford Political Science Prof.
Hubert Marshall, however,
disagreed with Sowell's conclusion
that there is a problem of liberal
bias among professors.
Marshall said a study performed
by Hoover Senior Fellow Seymore
Lipset showed that faculty mem
bers nationwide are "ever so
slightly but insignificantly left of the
American population." l.ipset, also a
political science professor, could not
be reached for comment.
That faculty members are slightly
left of the general public is less im
portant because "students arriving on
campuses are mature and have
already formed their own opinions,"
Marshall said.
But faculty members throughout
the country are behaving
"dishonestly," Sowell said. "Some
leftist professors have even admitted
they give students lower grades for
disagreeing with Marxism or other
leftist visions," he wrote.

Sowell added that thinkers are
worried about AIA and "not about
the cancerous problem that requires
it."
Sowell defended AIA, saying that
the advantage of its proposed catalog
of professors is that "students may
learn whose courses are not even
about the subjects listed in the cata
log and whose lectures are
propaganda."
Marshall said he feels AIA "is a
bad idea. Clearly (AIA and the cata
log) is an effort to intimidate faculty
members (throughout the nation)."
"In principle it's harmful," said
Marshall, adding that a catalog of
professors accused of propagandizing
would not have an effect here be
cause academic freedom is strongly
entrenched at Stanford.
