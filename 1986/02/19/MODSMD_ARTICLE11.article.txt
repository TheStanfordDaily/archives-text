### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Stating that the Soviets "are only
going to respond to power," a U.S.
Air Force major general last night
stressed the importance of main
taining high-quality weapons and
personnel in this country's armed
forces.
"In the application of power, (the
Soviet) respects power, and that's
all he respects," said Maj. Gen.
Robert Oaks, assistant deputy chief
of staff for personnel at U.S. Air
Force headquarters in Washington,
D.C., before a group of approxi
mately 20 at Branner Hall.
"Our will, our determination and
our military capability" are vital
elements in dealing with the Soviet
Union, Oaks said, noting that "trust
is not important to the Soviets."
International respect for the
United States has increased during
President Reagan's years in office,
according to Oaks. The Soviets
"recognize that we have a little
more influence" under the Reagan
Administration, he said.

Oaks added that military planners
have "very personal reasons and
natural reasons" for requesting in
creases to fund new weapons.
"They see themselves as going to
war in that machine," he said. "The
military planner is always going to
he asking for more."
Oaks said the Soviet Union,
which once had far fewer weapons
than the United States, now has
three times as many tanks and twice
as many submarines. He added that
the "qualitative advantage" once
held by the United States "is
closing."
Although he said the Soviet Un
ion has twice as many military per
sonnel, Oaks praised the U.S. mili
tary.
The Air Force is able "to attract
and retain high-quality people" who
get a "sense of satisfaction" from
serving in the military, according to
Oaks. Of the 65,000 people who
annually join the Air Force, 99 per
cent are high school graduates, he
said.
"We stress education in the Air
Porce." Oaks said.
