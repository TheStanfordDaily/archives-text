						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Shanty ire misses point 
### 
Riots in South Africa claimed 14 lives last weekend,
bringing the death toll in that country to over 1,100
since September 1984.
Meanwhile, at Dartmouth University and here at
Stanford, the recent destruction of symbolic shan
tytowns has fueled bitter debate over the extent of rac
ism on college campuses. We feel very strongly that the
destructions of the shanties were contemptible acts of
intolerance. Nevertheless, we question the ultimate
relevance of the controversy that has arisen from these
incidents.
The shantytowns at Dartmouth and Stanford were
constructed as eyesores in order to draw attention to
the "lifesore" of South African apartheid, but the issue
of their destructions has taken on a life of its own. At
Dartmouth, a day-long forum on racism and in
tolerence was held and the students who attacked the
shantytowns have been suspended. Dartmouth student
demonstrators have been arrested and members of the
faculty have requested Dartmouth President David
McLaughlin's resignation.
The destruction of the shantytowns should reinforce
the call for the universities' divestment from compan
ies that do business in South Africa. Instead, it has

clouded the focus of local anti-apartheid concern.
Lately, the villian has become campus "racism" â€” an
important issue, but one that should be secondary to
the larger injustices of the South African regime.
Both local and international social protest must em
phasize continued economic pressure on South Africa
to end a terrible cause of needless human suffering:
apartheid. In the context of South Africa's anguish,
does it really matter who destroyed symbolic shan
tytowns at two American colleges?
So far, the repeated calls for divestment have been
virtually ignored by the Stanford Board of Trustees.
They cite the University's presence as a positive poten
tial for change, but the situation in South Africa is get
ting worse, as evidenced by the renewed violence in
South Africa last weekend. It is clearly not enough for
the board to simply state their opposition to apartheid;
it must be demonstrated. One concrete step available
for Stanford at present is to support the Hewlett-
Packard shareholder resolution for divestiture next
week. It is a chance for us to move from the smaller
issue of shantytown politicking back to the larger issue
of the oppression of blacks in South Africa.
