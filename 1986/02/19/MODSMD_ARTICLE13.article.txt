## You can make a difference 
### 
This Saturday Stanford students, staff and faculty will
be putting on the third annual "You Can Make A Differ
ence Conference," entitled "Private Initiatives and Public
Responsiblities." The students have invited speakers who
represent a wide range of interests and backgrounds: the
television journalist Tom Brokaw; Herbert Abrams, the
physician co-founder of the International Physicians for
the Prevention of Nuclear War; David Guyer, president
of Save the Children Federation; President Herman
Blake, of Tougaloo College in Mississippi; Rep. Lena
Guerrero, a member of the Texas house of representa
tives; and John Young, president of Hewlett Packard. All
will participate in a morning roundtable that will consider
the important question of how our society establishes
public priorities.

Indeed, priorities and sectoral responsiblity do form the
key policy question of the day. The Gramm-Rudman
legislation represents a powerful and recent assertion on
just that question — an assertion that needs to be debated
and understood. It is predicated, in part, on the assump
tion that state and local government and the private sector
can and will substitute for the federal sector in meeting a
broad array of national needs. The students have asked
these speakers to challenge and discuss that assumption,
and they are right to do so.
The gravity of the issues confronting us — poverty,
hunger, an increasing return to a two-tiered medical sys
tem for the rich and for the poor, concerns about the
quality of education, the arms race, an environment that is
in danger of being permanently damaged, racial tension
and inequities — is reason enough to raise hard questions
about the division of responsibility between government
and the private sector. Should the government continue to
decrease its support for social programs? If so, are there
ways to encourage individuals, corporations and non
profits to fill the gap? What type of incentives are needed
to encourage "private initiatives?"
It is also noteworthy that the students who planned this
conference realize that the same questions need to be
asked for public responsibilites beyond our national bor
ders. David Guyer, president of the Save Our Children
Foundation, has long been concerned about the future of
young people in underdeveloped countries, where every

day 40,000 children die of hunger or malnutrition.
Another conference speaker, President Fran Newman
of the Education Commission of the States, argues in an
important report from the Carnegie Foundation that the
United States will lose its edge in the competitive world
trade market unless it can nurture the entrepreneurial
spirit among the young. He also argues that there is a
"dangerous mismatch between the country's urgent need
for civic-mindedness and the parochial attitudes of its
citizens."
The report asserts that self-interest is undermining
public interest and that changes in student attitudes
toward money, status and power— and away from the de
velopment of a philosophy of life and from participation
in community affairs — is a major concern. He concludes
that the adyancement of civic learning must be higher
education s most central goal, and he points to students'
public service activities at Stanford as a prime example of
hope for the future. It is fitting that the students invited
him to address the conference, and that they share his
concern about Private Initiatives and Public Responsibili
ties.
About 30 other speakers have been asked to lead
workshops in the afternoon. These will address issues that
the student organizers see as critical for the future —
peace and arms control, education, corporate responsibil
ity and third world development, technology and social
responsibility, corporations and domestic social responsi
bility, the environment, hunger and the homeless, ethnic
communities and health care. Speakers for the workshops
range from lawmakers to educators and community or
ganizers.
I cannot think of a better way for the community to
become educated about these issues than through the
mechanism of this conference. The speakers are all people
who have made a difference. Many have devoted all of
their professional lives to full-time public service. Others
have followed different professional interests, but have
still found ways to make critical contributions to the
public welfare. If anything, that is the central message of
this conference — there are as many avenues for an indi
vidual to make a difference as there are individuals.
Regardless of our individual directions, we need to talk
together about the basic public responsibilities that, as
citizens, we all share.

workshops in the afternoon. These will address issues that
the student organizers see as critical for the future —
peace and arms control, education, corporate responsibil
ity and third world development, technology and social
responsibility, corporations and domestic social responsi
bility, the environment, hunger and the homeless, ethnic
communities and health care. Speakers for the workshops
range from lawmakers to educators and community or
ganizers.
I cannot think of a better way for the community to
become educated about these issues than through the
mechanism of this conference. The speakers are all people
who have made a difference. Many have devoted all of
their professional lives to full-time public service. Others
have followed different professional interests, but have
still found ways to make critical contributions to the
public welfare. If anything, that is the central message of
this conference — there are as many avenues for an indi
vidual to make a difference as there are individuals.
Regardless of our individual directions, we need to talk
together about the basic public responsibilities that, as
citizens, we all share.
Donald Kennedy is president of Stanford University.
