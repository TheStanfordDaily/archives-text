Shanty critics
display racism
I read with dismay yet another let
ter on racism, the shantytown, Stan
ford Out of South Africa (SOSA) —
yet another letter based on fallacious
thinking.
First, the shantytown was, indeed,
an act of solidarity; it also was in
tended to be education for the Stan
ford community. James Dickey feels
an action that is "abstract" and does
not produce concrete, tangible results
is "futile" (Shantytown was no help
to Africa, The Daily, Feb.l3). He
ignores the sincere thank you that
Bishop Desmond Tutu extended to
U.S. students for their symbolic acts
of solidarity.
Dickey is unaware of the true
strength the Rev. Martin Luther King's
words still give to that "starving
mother in East Palo Alto," although
King is no longer with us to fight for
her food. Symbolic acts may seem
futile to Dickey, but they are part of
my culture's history — and a neces
sary source of strength and reaffirma
tion. How dare he claim no one is
"better off due to the shantytown's
existence?" It reminded me and
many others daily of our struggle and
some people's support of it.
An "eyesore," Nicholas Howell and
William McKelvy 111 called it
("Shanty symbols tarnished campus,"
The Daily, Feb. 11). Their
"underlying question is whether such

blatant blemishes upon our beautiful
and historic campus should be
allowed at all." Doesn't this sound
familiar? It is precisely the argument
of white South Africans when they
forcibly remove blacks and
"coloreds" from their townships to
the Bantustans, and erect con
dominiums for whites.
Let me assure Howell and
McKelvy that no one will sound the
"battle cry" and toss out the "blind
rebuke of racism." You wrote out of
pathetic ignorance of general ethnic
history and South African reality, as
far as I can see. My advice to you?
Read on.
Second, it has been interesting to
read The Daily lately and see how
many people are putting effort into
invalidating the people who speak out
rather than critiquing their argument
(read the above very carefully — I
approached the mistaken foundations
of the arguments and the ignorance of
the issue, not their race or political
leanings). For example. I called a fra
ternity president last week to discuss
a racially offensive flyer, and his first
question was "Are you black?" Is my
claim less legitimate because I am?
Neither my race nor the depth of
SOSA's sincerity are on trial when we
discuss racist incidents — it is the
incidents themselves. If people would
put the same energy into analyzing
positions that they put into under
mining the individuals who hold those
positions. .. .
Finally, it is a common fallacy that
a statement or action must be inten

tional and/or hostile to be racist. This
is not so. Racism isn't all about calling
me a "nigger." There's so much
more. When you make light of my
history, mock or ridicule my culture
and generally disrespect that which is
— literally — life and death to me in
your statements and actions, you will
be considered racist (and damned ar
rogant). So keep throwing Viet
namese Balls and Kamikaze parties,
keep pushing for the Indian mascot,
keep joking about the Klu Klux Klan
— and keep doing it "only for fun."
But stop calling me "hypersensitive."
Just realize that it is you who are
insensitive. And unaware. And, yes,
racist.

My thanks for, and my compli
ments on, your editorial of Feb. 12 on
the School of Humanities and
Sciences' new tenure policy
("Rethink tenure policy"). At a time
when I have understandably been re
evaluating my own commitment to
university teaching, such an eloquent
expression of student support and un
derstanding is most gratifying. It has
helped strengthen my resolve to con
tinue to aspire to the highest stand
ards in my teaching as well as in my
scholarship. I also hope that the is
sues discussed in the editorial might
help to bring about changes that will
be fairer in evaluating the scholarship

for the assistant professors who come
up for tenure in the future.

U.S. Haiti move
not praiseworthy
I had to laugh when I read your ed
itorial "Bye-bye to Baby Doc" (Feb.
10). You wrote: "Our commitment to
spreading democracy has been suc
cessfully demonstrated in Haiti." The
Duvalier father and son dynasty were
put in power 28 years ago by the U.S.
government. This is the salient fact
that the U.S. government, and your
editorial as well, completely omit.
This is the heart of the matter. All the
U.S. government did was to save
(President-for-life Jean-Claude)
Duvalier from standing trial in Haiti
in return presumably for his making
no public statement.
Similar military-^.landowner
dictatorships exist in the Philippines,
El Salvador and other Third World
countries because of U.S. military aid
to them. No wonder President
Reagan is so mad at Nicaragua. They
managed to kick out the (Un
supported) Somoza dynasty. And
black South Africa is about to throw
out their fascist white allies of the
U.S. government. Right on! Hurray
for Aquino. Mandela and Ortega.
