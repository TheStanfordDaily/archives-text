# Let bicycle anarchists reign
## 
### 
It is early morning in the yuppie district of East Palo
Alto. It is a small section — only the poorest and most
courageous yuppies dare to live there. Being a cohesive
group, we all belong to the East Palo Alto Yacht Club and
keep oui polo ponies in the same stable.
Our story opens as Tara leaves her apartment and starts
her Lincoln Continental. I mount my rapidly deteriorating
10-speed bicycle and the race for Stanford begins. I take
the initial lead as I run all five stop signs on Menalto,
while Tara is delayed by a school bus, a diesel truck and a
dog.
Tara cuts over to University while I speed down Lytton.
Traffic is sparse and only a brief pause is required before
slipping through the red lights. Oncoming traffic is also
stalled. Time to move. Look both ways, switch sides of the
road, look again, turn left, look again, switch back to the
right hand side. Perfect execution. This race is mine!

I blend in withr4raffic on Univareity and see Tara-*wo
blocks UodetJLbe4rqin tracks and over El
Camino. There is a lone bicyclist stopped at an orange
"Do Not Walk" sign. He is riding an ancient three-speed
Huffy complete with full fenders, headlight, reflectors and
a Kryptonite lock. His riding attire includes helmet, gloves
and glow-in-the-dark trouser bands — obviously not a
bicycle anarchist. He shouts, "Can't you read, you jerk?"
as I speed by. Ordinarily I would stop to pontificate on the
virtues of bicycle anarchy and explain that since no cars
were coming, I saw no need to stop. However, Tara is in
hot pursuit and victory is everything.
Palm Drive is wide open with few stops, so I have to
hustle. Fortunately, road maintenance is not a Stanford
priority and Tara's speed is limited by her suspension sys
tem. Palm Drive provides the ideal demonstration of ran
dom vibrations. I am certain this is an integral feature of
Stanford's safety program to reduce speeding.
I quickly approach the Palm Drive traffic light that was
undoubtedly designed by either a vengeful Berkeley grad
or a madman. My lead is decreasing. The light is green.
The car ahead is signalling to turn right in front of me. No
eye contact with the driver. I can only assume I am in
visible. I may be a bicycle anarchist but I also want to live
to see Prof. Tatum's next concrete class. I stop, wait and
try to recover. It is too late. She beat me. Well Tara, to
morrow is another day. Had there been a home football
game, she never would have stood a chance.
From a purely emotional state, bicycle anarchy is in
vigorating therapy for the Type-A personality who
loathes waiting in traffic and wants everything now. It is
David vs. Goliath as a $150 bicycle competes equally with

a $16,000 automobile. It is the freedom to choose which
rules apply and which can safely be ingored. It is the most
fun you can have with your clothes on. At the end, my
heart is pounding and I am breathing heavily. I am ex
hilarated and fully able to stay awake during Prof. Gere's
earthquake lecture.
From a more rational viewpoint, bicycle anarchy still
makes sense. Bicycles face a distinct disadvantage by nbt
being seen or heard. They are forced to the side of the
road where puddles and potholes proliferate. The Fred
Flintstone method is the only means of stopping on a rainy
day. Bicycle anarchy merely balances the situation by re
alizing that bicycles also have certain advantages. They
are small, light and can maneuver anywhere. A bicycle
functions as a pedestrian or a vehicle, whichever is morfe
convenient at the time.
The situation facing cars and bicycles is entirely differ
ent. If a car violates a law of nature, the typical result is a
dented fender. When a bicycle violates the same law, the
disastrous fate is often serious injury or death. For further
discussion, consult the impulse-momentum section of
your physics book.
Conversely, if a car violates a law of man, the grave
consequences can include huge fines, loss of license,
skyrocketing insurance rates and a possible jail sentence.
For a bicycle, however, ignoring a law of man typically
results in a meager fine or more often, a stern lecture. The
only conclusion for the prudent bicyclist who wants to live
through the experience is to show ultimate respect for the
laws of nature and regard the laws of man as purely advi
sory. Br mm—- m -
Bicycle anarchy is not synonymcurs with unsafe otdreck
less behavior. I am not even remotely advocating darting
blindly in front of cars. I condemn the discourteous and
dangerous actions that occur daily on this campus by
bicyclists in congested pedestrian areas. My premise
remains that if I can clearly see that no danger is present,
why should I blindly sit and wait for an arbitrary light to
change color?
Rigid adherence to these laws presupposes that some
one else who is not even around to observe the specific
conditions is better able to evaluate the safety of a situa
tion. Furthermore, these laws were designed primarily for
automobiles. Bicycles were an afterthought — a nuisance
that somehow had to be included. I feel considerably safer
relying on my experience, reason and judgment. Since so
ciety does not impose a large penalty for noncompliance, I
refuse to let an electrical impulse exclusively dictate when
I will cross a street. Nobody else is hurt or delayed by my
actions. With the exception of prostitution, how many
other crimes can make that claim?
Is this guy advocating individual liberty, violation of law
and order and civil disobedience? Is this the same arch
conservative who is dedicated to the death penalty, apa
thetic on apartheid, biased toward big business, devoted
to defense, reverent toward Reagan, wrathful about
welfare and fond of the flag? Remember, folks, that you
read it first in the pages of The Daily. I have come out of
the closet. I am really a liberal. Please don't tell my par
ents.

a $16,000 automobile. It is the freedom to choose which
rules apply and which can safely be ingored. It is the most
fun you can have with your clothes on. At the end, my
heart is pounding and I am breathing heavily. I am ex

earthquake lecture.
From a more rational viewpoint, bicycle anarchy still
makes sense. Bicycles face a distinct disadvantage by nbt
being seen or heard. They are forced to the side of the
road where puddles and potholes proliferate. The Fred
Flintstone method is the only means of stopping on a rainy
day. Bicycle anarchy merely balances the situation by re
alizing that bicycles also have certain advantages. They
are small, light and can maneuver anywhere. A bicycle
functions as a pedestrian or a vehicle, whichever is morfe
convenient at the time.
The situation facing cars and bicycles is entirely differ
ent. If a car violates a law of nature, the typical result is a
dented fender. When a bicycle violates the same law, the
disastrous fate is often serious injury or death. For further
discussion, consult the impulse-momentum section of
your physics book.
Conversely, if a car violates a law of man, the grave
consequences can include huge fines, loss of license,
skyrocketing insurance rates and a possible jail sentence.
For a bicycle, however, ignoring a law of man typically
results in a meager fine or more often, a stern lecture. The
only conclusion for the prudent bicyclist who wants to live
through the experience is to show ultimate respect for the
laws of nature and regard the laws of man as purely advi
sory. Br mm—- m -
Bicycle anarchy is not synonymcurs with unsafe otdreck
less behavior. I am not even remotely advocating darting
blindly in front of cars. I condemn the discourteous and
dangerous actions that occur daily on this campus by
bicyclists in congested pedestrian areas. My premise
remains that if I can clearly see that no danger is present,
why should I blindly sit and wait for an arbitrary light to
change color?
Rigid adherence to these laws presupposes that some
one else who is not even around to observe the specific
conditions is better able to evaluate the safety of a situa
tion. Furthermore, these laws were designed primarily for
automobiles. Bicycles were an afterthought — a nuisance
that somehow had to be included. I feel considerably safer
relying on my experience, reason and judgment. Since so
ciety does not impose a large penalty for noncompliance, I
refuse to let an electrical impulse exclusively dictate when
I will cross a street. Nobody else is hurt or delayed by my
actions. With the exception of prostitution, how many
other crimes can make that claim?
Is this guy advocating individual liberty, violation of law
and order and civil disobedience? Is this the same arch
conservative who is dedicated to the death penalty, apa
thetic on apartheid, biased toward big business, devoted
to defense, reverent toward Reagan, wrathful about
welfare and fond of the flag? Remember, folks, that you
read it first in the pages of The Daily. I have come out of
the closet. I am really a liberal. Please don't tell my par
ents.

It is early morning in the yuppie district of East Palo
Alto. It is a small section — only the poorest and most
courageous yuppies dare to live there. Being a cohesive
group, we all belong to the East Palo Alto Yacht Club and
keep oui polo ponies in the same stable.
Our story opens as Tara leaves her apartment and starts
her Lincoln Continental. I mount my rapidly deteriorating
10-speed bicycle and the race for Stanford begins. I take
the initial lead as I run all five stop signs on Menalto,
while Tara is delayed by a school bus, a diesel truck and a
dog.
Tara cuts over to University while I speed down Lytton.
Traffic is sparse and only a brief pause is required before
slipping through the red lights. Oncoming traffic is also
stalled. Time to move. Look both ways, switch sides of the
road, look again, turn left, look again, switch back to the
right hand side. Perfect execution. This race is mine!

I blend in withr4raffic on Univareity and see Tara-*wo
blocks UodetJLbe4rqin tracks and over El
Camino. There is a lone bicyclist stopped at an orange
"Do Not Walk" sign. He is riding an ancient three-speed
Huffy complete with full fenders, headlight, reflectors and
a Kryptonite lock. His riding attire includes helmet, gloves
and glow-in-the-dark trouser bands — obviously not a
bicycle anarchist. He shouts, "Can't you read, you jerk?"
as I speed by. Ordinarily I would stop to pontificate on the
virtues of bicycle anarchy and explain that since no cars
were coming, I saw no need to stop. However, Tara is in
hot pursuit and victory is everything.
Palm Drive is wide open with few stops, so I have to
hustle. Fortunately, road maintenance is not a Stanford
priority and Tara's speed is limited by her suspension sys
tem. Palm Drive provides the ideal demonstration of ran
dom vibrations. I am certain this is an integral feature of
Stanford's safety program to reduce speeding.
I quickly approach the Palm Drive traffic light that was
undoubtedly designed by either a vengeful Berkeley grad
or a madman. My lead is decreasing. The light is green.
The car ahead is signalling to turn right in front of me. No
eye contact with the driver. I can only assume I am in
visible. I may be a bicycle anarchist but I also want to live
to see Prof. Tatum's next concrete class. I stop, wait and
try to recover. It is too late. She beat me. Well Tara, to
morrow is another day. Had there been a home football
game, she never would have stood a chance.
From a purely emotional state, bicycle anarchy is in
vigorating therapy for the Type-A personality who
loathes waiting in traffic and wants everything now. It is
David vs. Goliath as a $150 bicycle competes equally with

a $16,000 automobile. It is the freedom to choose which
rules apply and which can safely be ingored. It is the most
fun you can have with your clothes on. At the end, my
