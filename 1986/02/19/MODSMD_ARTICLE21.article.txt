## Productive study Stanford profs. turn research into dollars 
### ANDY CROSBY 
Have you ever wondered how
Stanford professors are able to move
products of their research into large
scale development and application?
Among the multitude of organiza
tions to which researchers can turn
for help is the Office of Technology
Licensing (OTL).
A Stanford faculty member whose
research leads to an invention with
commercial potential can avoid the
technicalities of licensing, patenting
and development by working with the
OTL. After discussing prospects for
commercial development with the in
ventor, OTL then searches for a com
pany that is willing to organize and
fund the development of the product.
It takes large amounts of time and
money to raise an invention from the
infant stage of research to the ul
timate stage of commercial applica
tion.
The valuable services offered by
OTL are not free. OTL receives 15
percent of gross royalties produced
by various inventions. It also extracts
money to cover patent expenses.
After deducting these expenses,
Stanford splits royalty income equally
between inventors, their department
and their school within the Univer
sity.
An expected 27 percent gain over
the gross figure of 1984-85 may yield
Stanford $5 million in royalties this
year. This projection highlights the

annual report from OTL. Circulated
to the Board of Trustees Feb. 11, the
report notes Stanford received
income from 71 different technolo
gies and 17 software programs.
Kathryn Ku of OTL said that one
of the reasons for this drastic increase
in projected revenues is "we're a
more mature organization and many
of our early investments are now
paying off."
An example of an "early invest
ment" is OTL's involvement with
Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer in
the practical development of recom
binant DNA. Recombinant DNA,
the development of which began in
1974, has only recently begun to
generate profits.
John Chowning, a professor in the
Stanford Music Department, is an
other inventor who has been assisted
by OTL. Chowning explained how
the University recognized the music
industry's potential interest in fre
quency modulation synthesis, an idea
which Chowning had been research
ing for almost 20 years. This state-of
the-art technology is now incor
porated in Yamaha sound synthesis
products which bear a letter "X" in
the model designation.
Chowning praised OTL as being "a
first class operation, well-staffed and
well-organized." He added, "OTL is
effective because it works very closely
with faculty and staff and is extremely
sensitive to their research and inter
ests."
