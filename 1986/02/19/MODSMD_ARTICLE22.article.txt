"The Parable of the Blind"
Gert Hoffman
New York, Fromm International,
1986
I'm afraid of going blind. It's some
what of a phobia of mine. So when I
picked up Gert Hoffman's "Parable
of the Blind," it was with a bit of
trepidation. I imagined it was going to
remind me — allegorically — of how
dependent we are on our ridiculously
fragile eyes.
1 was right — but Hoffman's book
does more than remind one of the
vast difference between vision and
blindness. "The Parable of the Blind"
is also about the difference between
seeing and not seeing, and Hoffman
would argue that we see not only with
our eyes, but with our whole selves.
The "blindest" men in this book are
those who fail to "see" things as they
really are — and that's everyone.
The painting on the dust jacket is a
section of a Peter Breughal painting
entitled "The Blind Leading the
Blind" (1527, Brussels). Accepted
criticism has it that the painting is a
poke at the state of the church at the
time — church leaders were following
each other through what Breughal
believed to be blind faith. No matter
what the subject, the painting is trou
bling, almost revolting — the blind
men have in fact no eyes at all, only
empty sockets; they clutch one an
other and as the first one falls into a
ditch they all begin to fall, screaming.
According to the dust jacket, an
other name for Breughal's painting is
"The Parable of the Blind," but the
painting is not referred to specifically
in the book, nor is Breughal. The
details of the story suggest Hoffman
wrote his book about this painting —
the final scene seems to match Breug
hal's painting, the description of time
and place seem accurate and the atti
tude and character of the painter cor
respond to what we know about
Breughal's life — but the final piece
of the puzzle is missing.
This lack of certainty accomplishes
two things; it makes the story itself a
bit more universal (OK, so maybe
saying it could be about any 15th
century painter painting blind men
isn't making it all that universal), and
it our experience with that of
the charactei/characters in the book,
who don't know who is painting them
and obviously don't know what the

title of the painting will be.
The story is simple, as parables are:
A group of blind men is taken to a
painter, to be painted while falling off
a bridge. They don't understand why
they are to be painted, but they make
no protest— they are wandering beg
gars and have nothing better to do
with their time. They find their way to
the painter's house, are painted and
then leave, never understanding what
purpose they've served, and never
absolutely sure they've been painted
at all.
Everything in the universe of these
men is uncertain, and as a result they
grasp, poke at and finger their sur
roundings to make sure what they
believe to be there actually exists.
One member of the group, Ripolus, is
less blind than the others; he "sees"
what is around them and gives a
vague report. Through the course of
the narrative, Ripolus is having a bad
day, and he isn't seeing anything at
all. Despite the fact that he keeps on
insisting he can't see anything, he is
pressed for continual reports.
Ripolus is the most distinct charac
ter in the parable. Hoffman has cho
sen to tell his story in a confusing first
person plural, through the eyes of a
narrator who at times seems to be
thinking as an individual and at times
thinks as a group of six people. The
reasons behind Hoffman's choice of
first person plural become obvious
through the course of the narrative;
through sharing a common experi
ence (that of being blinded), traveling
together and being treated as a unit,
the blind men have developed a com
mon identity.
The confusion sets in when the
"we" of the book begins to express
common thoughts. Wandering on the
painter's property, the "voice" sug
gests, "at once we think we might be
lost among flowers." Is Hoffman sug
gesting a psychic connection between
the blind men? At another point in
the narrative, the voice describes
sores on the blind men's bodies.
"Ripolus has a hole in his knee," it
explains, "Slit Man on his elbow,
there's a hole in Malente's chin, and
we won't even mention ourself."
Who is "ourself" as opposed to
Ripolus, Slit Man and Malente?
When the \ e is talking about just one
other person in the group, we accept
it somehow, but here "ourself' and
to represent a single person
in the royal we.
The "person" of the "Blind Man"
finds its counterpart in the artist who

decides to paint them. The painter,
unlike his models, lives in a wholly
visual world — he sees the image of
the falling blind men as a metaphor
for what he feels to be the degenerate
condition of his country and people.
The blind men cannot understand
why anyone would want to paint
them — they consider themselves
ugly, and they consider ugly things
not worth seeing. The painter, on the
other hand, wants to paint them
precisely because they are ugly; he
realizes that "seeing" encompasses
both the beautiful and the ugly. The
difference between the painter's per
ception of the blind men and the way
they "see" themselves suggests that
the blind men were blind even before
they lost their eyes — blind in that
they chose to "not see" the un
pleasant side of life.
The townspeople react to ugliness
in yet another way; they don't avoid
the sight of the blind men, but rather
ridicule and denigrate them. They
are perversely fascinated with the
ugly — and go so far as to trick the
blind men into urinating in the en
tirely exposed town square, telling
them they are hidden behind a barn.
Their fascination with the ugly is
quite different from the painter's —
they want to look at the blind men as
something completely separate from
themselves, and the painter wants to
convince the world that there is no
difference between the blind men and
himself.
It seems initially that the painter is
the only one able to "see" the blind
men. When the painter is done with
the blind men, he has no more use for
them. To him, the painted image of
the men is more valuable than their
living presence; they are told simply
to go home. Having no home to go to,
they go on their way. One imagines
they will wander for a few years, and
eventually be either killed or die of
sickness. The painting — which they
never will see — will outlive them for
centuries. Now we have Hoffman's
story, which possibly could outlive
the painting; it's interesting to
wonder how much Hoffman's story
has to do with these men, since he's
interpreting Breughal's interpretation
of them. And does it matter? Who, in
the end, can claim to have "seen" the
blind men? Themselves? Hoffman's
parable reminds us that in a sense
we're ail blind — like the blind men
and theijelephant, we all have entirely
different ways of seeing what's
around us.

of the puzzle is missing.
This lack of certainty accomplishes
two things; it makes the story itself a
bit more universal (OK, so maybe
saying it could be about any 15th
century painter painting blind men
isn't making it all that universal), and
it our experience with that of
the charactei/characters in the book,
who don't know who is painting them
and obviously don't know what the

title of the painting will be.
The story is simple, as parables are:
A group of blind men is taken to a
painter, to be painted while falling off
a bridge. They don't understand why
they are to be painted, but they make
no protest— they are wandering beg
gars and have nothing better to do
with their time. They find their way to
the painter's house, are painted and
then leave, never understanding what
purpose they've served, and never
absolutely sure they've been painted
at all.
Everything in the universe of these
men is uncertain, and as a result they
grasp, poke at and finger their sur
roundings to make sure what they
believe to be there actually exists.
One member of the group, Ripolus, is
less blind than the others; he "sees"
what is around them and gives a
vague report. Through the course of
the narrative, Ripolus is having a bad
day, and he isn't seeing anything at
all. Despite the fact that he keeps on
insisting he can't see anything, he is
pressed for continual reports.
Ripolus is the most distinct charac
ter in the parable. Hoffman has cho
sen to tell his story in a confusing first
person plural, through the eyes of a
narrator who at times seems to be
thinking as an individual and at times
thinks as a group of six people. The
reasons behind Hoffman's choice of
first person plural become obvious
through the course of the narrative;
through sharing a common experi
ence (that of being blinded), traveling
together and being treated as a unit,
the blind men have developed a com
mon identity.
The confusion sets in when the
"we" of the book begins to express
common thoughts. Wandering on the
painter's property, the "voice" sug
gests, "at once we think we might be
lost among flowers." Is Hoffman sug
gesting a psychic connection between
the blind men? At another point in
the narrative, the voice describes
sores on the blind men's bodies.
"Ripolus has a hole in his knee," it
explains, "Slit Man on his elbow,
there's a hole in Malente's chin, and
we won't even mention ourself."
Who is "ourself" as opposed to
Ripolus, Slit Man and Malente?
When the \ e is talking about just one
other person in the group, we accept
it somehow, but here "ourself' and
to represent a single person
in the royal we.
The "person" of the "Blind Man"
finds its counterpart in the artist who

decides to paint them. The painter,
unlike his models, lives in a wholly
visual world — he sees the image of
the falling blind men as a metaphor
for what he feels to be the degenerate
condition of his country and people.
The blind men cannot understand
why anyone would want to paint
them — they consider themselves
ugly, and they consider ugly things
not worth seeing. The painter, on the
other hand, wants to paint them
precisely because they are ugly; he
realizes that "seeing" encompasses
both the beautiful and the ugly. The
difference between the painter's per
ception of the blind men and the way
they "see" themselves suggests that
the blind men were blind even before
they lost their eyes — blind in that
they chose to "not see" the un
pleasant side of life.
The townspeople react to ugliness
in yet another way; they don't avoid
the sight of the blind men, but rather
ridicule and denigrate them. They
are perversely fascinated with the
ugly — and go so far as to trick the
blind men into urinating in the en
tirely exposed town square, telling
them they are hidden behind a barn.
Their fascination with the ugly is
quite different from the painter's —
they want to look at the blind men as
something completely separate from
themselves, and the painter wants to
convince the world that there is no
difference between the blind men and
himself.
It seems initially that the painter is
the only one able to "see" the blind
men. When the painter is done with
the blind men, he has no more use for
them. To him, the painted image of
the men is more valuable than their
living presence; they are told simply
to go home. Having no home to go to,
they go on their way. One imagines
they will wander for a few years, and
eventually be either killed or die of
sickness. The painting — which they
never will see — will outlive them for
centuries. Now we have Hoffman's
story, which possibly could outlive
the painting; it's interesting to
wonder how much Hoffman's story
has to do with these men, since he's
interpreting Breughal's interpretation
of them. And does it matter? Who, in
the end, can claim to have "seen" the
blind men? Themselves? Hoffman's
parable reminds us that in a sense
we're ail blind — like the blind men
and theijelephant, we all have entirely
different ways of seeing what's
around us.

"The Parable of the Blind"
Gert Hoffman
New York, Fromm International,
1986
I'm afraid of going blind. It's some
what of a phobia of mine. So when I
picked up Gert Hoffman's "Parable
of the Blind," it was with a bit of
trepidation. I imagined it was going to
remind me — allegorically — of how
dependent we are on our ridiculously
fragile eyes.
1 was right — but Hoffman's book
does more than remind one of the
vast difference between vision and
blindness. "The Parable of the Blind"
is also about the difference between
seeing and not seeing, and Hoffman
would argue that we see not only with
our eyes, but with our whole selves.
The "blindest" men in this book are
those who fail to "see" things as they
really are — and that's everyone.
The painting on the dust jacket is a
section of a Peter Breughal painting
entitled "The Blind Leading the
Blind" (1527, Brussels). Accepted
criticism has it that the painting is a
poke at the state of the church at the
time — church leaders were following
each other through what Breughal
believed to be blind faith. No matter
what the subject, the painting is trou
bling, almost revolting — the blind
men have in fact no eyes at all, only
empty sockets; they clutch one an
other and as the first one falls into a
ditch they all begin to fall, screaming.
According to the dust jacket, an
other name for Breughal's painting is
"The Parable of the Blind," but the
painting is not referred to specifically
in the book, nor is Breughal. The
details of the story suggest Hoffman
wrote his book about this painting —
the final scene seems to match Breug
hal's painting, the description of time
and place seem accurate and the atti
tude and character of the painter cor
respond to what we know about
Breughal's life — but the final piece
of the puzzle is missing.
