and Northern California"

Did you know there was a Frank Lloyd
Wright house right on the edge of campus?
If you didn't know, and are at all interested,
then " The Guide to Architecture in San Fran
cisco and Northern California" might just be
the book for you. If your favorite pastime is
driving around in search of yet another at
tempt at structural perfection, then this
backpacker-sized, well-researched update of
the 1973 guide will keep you busy for months.
California isn't renowned for its architec
ture, to be sure. In fact, one could say that the

state has a reputation for being a vast ar
chitectural bad joke that extends over dimen
sions of space and time. The editors of the
guide don't go quite that far, but they don't go
out of their way to praise the area. In their in
troduction they describe California as a land
of great nature that has been somewhat
sullied by the forces of man.
Northern California evokes two images —
one of a country of majestic mountains run
ning to golden, oak-studded hills undulating
toward the Pacific surf, the other of the get
rich-quick locale of the hell-bent exploiter,
ravaging the land, jerry-building towns and
cities and generally setting aside all values ex
cept the profit motive.
The raping of California, aside from being
ecologically unsound, has been architecturally
boring, the authors maintain.
Most of the cities and towns, particularly in

their central business districts, are dull and
uninteresting.
In case you're wondering why anyone
would bother putting together an architec
tural guide to Northern California, there are a
lot of interesting buildings around. And the
pace at which everything's been built — es
sentially all within the last 100 years — makes
for an interesting conglomeration of styles
and structures.
The book covers a great deal of territory,
from down past Yosemite to up toward the
Russian River area. There are about 70 geo
graphical subdivisions, and each major geo
graphical area is given a brief historical dis
cussion, followed by a map. Numbers on the
maps correlate to buildings which are de
scribed in short paragraphs.
The choice of buildings is determined not
so much by their "absolute" relevance within

the Northern California area, but by their im
portance in relation to other buildings in the
same geographical area. Thus we get only the
most major San Francisco buildings, a larger
sampling of buildings in smaller areas such as
San Jose and relatively uninteresting build
ings in some of the small towns. There is a
good argument for the "something for every
one" approach. The buildings in Palo Alto,
for example, are the buildings I'm most likely
to come in contact with, so I'm more inter
ested in them than I am in more important
structures in faraway places. Similarly, a
reader in Watsonville might not care as much
about a particularly charming San Francisco
gingerbread house as he might about some
thing in his hometown. But I still get the
feeling that a lot of major buildings just are
not there — and that ultimately my knowl
edge of the area's architecture is being deter
mined by the authors' preferences.

One other problem with the book is that
the photographs are too few and badly
labeled. Of course, more photographs would
mean a larger book, and the book is such a
nice size now (so nice, it kinda makes you
want to carry it around) that maybe more isn't
a good idea. Better photos wouldn't hurt — or
at least a consistency in quality. There are
plates at the end of the book which look sus
piciously like snapshots to me. Poor printing
resolution.
Overall, however, the "Guide" does what it
sets out to do. It provides the layman with
more than he ever wanted to know about the
buildings that surround him, and throws in a
few subjective remarks for the critics to holler
about. Looking at buildings is a good rainy
day pastime (in the car with the windows
rolled up), so keep the "Guide" in mind. And
the Wright house? It's up near Synergy.
Happy hunting.

same geographical area. Thus we get only the
most major San Francisco buildings, a larger
sampling of buildings in smaller areas such as
San Jose and relatively uninteresting build
ings in some of the small towns. There is a
good argument for the "something for every
one" approach. The buildings in Palo Alto,
for example, are the buildings I'm most likely
to come in contact with, so I'm more inter
ested in them than I am in more important
structures in faraway places. Similarly, a
reader in Watsonville might not care as much
about a particularly charming San Francisco
gingerbread house as he might about some
thing in his hometown. But I still get the
feeling that a lot of major buildings just are
not there — and that ultimately my knowl
edge of the area's architecture is being deter
mined by the authors' preferences.

One other problem with the book is that
the photographs are too few and badly
labeled. Of course, more photographs would
mean a larger book, and the book is such a
nice size now (so nice, it kinda makes you
want to carry it around) that maybe more isn't
a good idea. Better photos wouldn't hurt — or
at least a consistency in quality. There are
plates at the end of the book which look sus
piciously like snapshots to me. Poor printing
resolution.
Overall, however, the "Guide" does what it
sets out to do. It provides the layman with
more than he ever wanted to know about the
buildings that surround him, and throws in a
few subjective remarks for the critics to holler
about. Looking at buildings is a good rainy
day pastime (in the car with the windows
rolled up), so keep the "Guide" in mind. And
the Wright house? It's up near Synergy.
Happy hunting.
