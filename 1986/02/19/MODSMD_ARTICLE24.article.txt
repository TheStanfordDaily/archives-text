## Scientists work at speed of light 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Critics of the Reagan Administra
tion's proposed missile defense shield
say that "Star Wars" is one feat the
president can pull off only with the
hocus-pocus of lights and mirrors.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Joseph
Goodman, recipient of Stanford's
first Star Wars research contract,
might agree.
Goodman is studying devices for
computers that use beams of light in
stead of streams of electrons. His
work could lead to computers capable
of performing 5,000 times faster than
current machines.
Many experts feel that Star Wars
will depend on the development of
new technologies in high-speed com
puting. Goodman's work may have
direct applications to this aspect of
the proposed strategic defense sys
tem.
The field is known as optical com
puting. Still primarily in the primitive
stage, the new technology focuses on
the use of photons — the particles
that make up light waves— at various
levels of computer structure.
Engineers have already begun to
use optics to connect computers.
Goodman is studying ways of using
optical interconnections at the next
lower level of architecture, for
" module-to-module communication"
within a single machine.
The chief benefit of optical inter
connections would be faster comput
ing. Many processes in the optical
computer would be at the speed of
light, meaning in theory that the com
puter could perform a trillion opera
tions a second. The fastest computers
today can handle about 200 million
operations a second.
Goodman says that interest in op
tics for solving complex communica
tions problems stems in part from the
behavior of light waves. Unlike
streams of electrons, which generate
crosstalk when placed close together,
streams of photons could pass
through one another with virtually no
interference.
Goodman's ultimate goal is to
design computers with dynamic inter
connections that could.be changed
rapidly while still supporting high
speed communications. Computers
with such connections could be
speedily reconfigured, the equivalent
of instantly rewiring a machine, to
meet a variety of needs.
In the envisioned Star Wars sys
tem, high-speed supercomputers

would track incoming missiles and
warheads and distinguish real war
heads from decoys. Hence the need
for the development of high-speed
computers that have great flexibility.
Goodman, who says he has been
working on optical computing since
he obtained his doctorate in 1963
(though only with digital computers
for the last decade), currently
receives funding from NASA and the
Army Research Office, in addition to
the Pentagon, for his research in the
field.
Last year he applied for funding to
the Strategic Defense Initiative Or
ganization, the so-called Star Wars
office of the Defense Department,
and the Pentagon office showed in
terest in financing his research.

"It's suicidal for this nation not to do
the research necessary to find what
can and cannot be done on missile
defense. The (Soviet Union) is
definitely doing it."
— Prof. Joseph Goodman

In April, the Pentagon announced
that it was funding a nine-member
consortium of research institutions,
including Stanford and six other uni
versities, to study possible applica
tions of optical computing to Star
Wars. Goodman, chosen by an inter
mediary organization, the University
of Dayton Research Institute, to head
the Stanford work, has served as co
principal investigator for the contract
along with Lambertus Hesselink, as
sociate professor of electrical engi
neering.
The six-month Pentagon contract,
a $101,640 award, was supposed to
end in December, but Goodman says
he asked for and received a three
month, no-cost extension because he
hadn't used up all his funds.
Hesselink, who is an associate pro

fessor in Stanford's Aeronautics and
Astronautics Department as well as
in electrical engineering, says he ap
proaches the optical computing re
search from a different perspective
than Goodman's. Unlike Goodman,
he has not worked on optical comput
ing before, but has conducted re
search in many tangential areas in
cluding non-linear optics.
The two Stanford engineers discuss
optical computing as a "far-out" area
of research, with no immediate
practical applications. They empha
size possible civilian applications of
the work and downplay possible mili
tary uses.
Goodman cites possible applica
tions of his work in the field of oil ex
ploration. Computers must handle
large computations and place great

amounts of data in arrays for imaging
under the ground, he explains. The
optical computer might prove useful
and cost-effective for these tasks.
The engineers assert that accepting
SDI funding for research does not
necessarily mean that they endorse all
aspects of the defense program.
"It's suicidal for this nation not to
do the research necessary to find
what can and cannot be done on
missile defense," Goodman said in a
recent interview. "The (Soviet Un
ion) is definitely doing it.
"But deployment is a different
issue. It could be destabilizing."
Both Goodman and Hesselink
remain firmly behind the University's
policy prohibiting classified research
at Stanford, a rule instituted here in
1970.

It appeared in April that the Pent
agon's SDI office wanted the optical
computing contract to include an op
tion for the government to prohibit
publication of research findings —
something the University would not
allow — and might require the inves
tigators to have government security
clearances.
Goodman stated at the time that he
backed the University's policy allow
ing only unclassified work on campus
and added that the University should
not have to accept a contract with any
security restrictions.
The contract that the University
and the Pentagon agreed upon had
neither restrictions on publication of
results nor directives for researchers
to obtain security clearances.
Hesselink said in a recent interview
that he would have refused a contract
with any security restrictions, fearing
that the government might then want
to classify findings. Classification of
research impinges on academic
freedom, he asserted.
"I think it's essential to freely com
municate results of research," he
added, noting the danger of allowing
the government to examine research
findings at universities and classify
anything it deems important to na
tional security.
"Dissemination of information . . .
and interaction with colleagues is im
portant," Hesselink said. "If the mili
tary can find a use (for our findings),
they can go to the open liturgy."
Dissemination and interaction have
not been a problem for Goodman and
Hesselink, who made oral presenta
tions in August and October on their
findings and released in December a
20-page report on the technical prog
ress of the optical computing con
tract.
The report suggests several possi
ble models for optical interconnec
tions within a computer and high
lights the benefits of "dynamically
reconfigurable architectures" — the
structures that would allow com
puters the flexibility to change inter
connections rapidly — for handling
large amounts of data and increasing
computing power.
Goodman and Hesselink, currently
conducting work on the contract with
two graduate students, say they are
hopeful that they will receive addi
tional funding when they exhaust the
first award.
"We're in the negotiating process
(for a contract) now," Hesselink
said.

including Stanford and six other uni
versities, to study possible applica
tions of optical computing to Star
Wars. Goodman, chosen by an inter
mediary organization, the University
of Dayton Research Institute, to head
the Stanford work, has served as co
principal investigator for the contract
along with Lambertus Hesselink, as
sociate professor of electrical engi
neering.
The six-month Pentagon contract,
a $101,640 award, was supposed to
end in December, but Goodman says
he asked for and received a three
month, no-cost extension because he
hadn't used up all his funds.
Hesselink, who is an associate pro

fessor in Stanford's Aeronautics and
Astronautics Department as well as
in electrical engineering, says he ap
proaches the optical computing re
search from a different perspective
than Goodman's. Unlike Goodman,
he has not worked on optical comput
ing before, but has conducted re
search in many tangential areas in
cluding non-linear optics.
The two Stanford engineers discuss
optical computing as a "far-out" area
of research, with no immediate
practical applications. They empha
size possible civilian applications of
the work and downplay possible mili
tary uses.
Goodman cites possible applica
tions of his work in the field of oil ex
ploration. Computers must handle
large computations and place great

amounts of data in arrays for imaging
under the ground, he explains. The
optical computer might prove useful
and cost-effective for these tasks.
The engineers assert that accepting
SDI funding for research does not
necessarily mean that they endorse all
aspects of the defense program.
"It's suicidal for this nation not to
do the research necessary to find
what can and cannot be done on
missile defense," Goodman said in a
recent interview. "The (Soviet Un
ion) is definitely doing it.
"But deployment is a different
issue. It could be destabilizing."
Both Goodman and Hesselink
remain firmly behind the University's
policy prohibiting classified research
at Stanford, a rule instituted here in
1970.

It appeared in April that the Pent
agon's SDI office wanted the optical
computing contract to include an op
tion for the government to prohibit
publication of research findings —
something the University would not
allow — and might require the inves
tigators to have government security
clearances.
Goodman stated at the time that he
backed the University's policy allow
ing only unclassified work on campus
and added that the University should
not have to accept a contract with any
security restrictions.
The contract that the University
and the Pentagon agreed upon had
neither restrictions on publication of
results nor directives for researchers
to obtain security clearances.
Hesselink said in a recent interview
that he would have refused a contract
with any security restrictions, fearing
that the government might then want
to classify findings. Classification of
research impinges on academic
freedom, he asserted.
"I think it's essential to freely com
municate results of research," he
added, noting the danger of allowing
the government to examine research
findings at universities and classify
anything it deems important to na
tional security.
"Dissemination of information . . .
and interaction with colleagues is im
portant," Hesselink said. "If the mili
tary can find a use (for our findings),
they can go to the open liturgy."
Dissemination and interaction have
not been a problem for Goodman and
Hesselink, who made oral presenta
tions in August and October on their
findings and released in December a
20-page report on the technical prog
ress of the optical computing con
tract.
The report suggests several possi
ble models for optical interconnec
tions within a computer and high
lights the benefits of "dynamically
reconfigurable architectures" — the
structures that would allow com
puters the flexibility to change inter
connections rapidly — for handling
large amounts of data and increasing
computing power.
Goodman and Hesselink, currently
conducting work on the contract with
two graduate students, say they are
hopeful that they will receive addi
tional funding when they exhaust the
first award.
"We're in the negotiating process
(for a contract) now," Hesselink
said.
Critics of the Reagan Administra
tion's proposed missile defense shield
say that "Star Wars" is one feat the
president can pull off only with the
hocus-pocus of lights and mirrors.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Joseph
Goodman, recipient of Stanford's
first Star Wars research contract,
might agree.
Goodman is studying devices for
computers that use beams of light in
stead of streams of electrons. His
work could lead to computers capable
of performing 5,000 times faster than
current machines.
Many experts feel that Star Wars
will depend on the development of
new technologies in high-speed com
puting. Goodman's work may have
direct applications to this aspect of
the proposed strategic defense sys
tem.
The field is known as optical com
puting. Still primarily in the primitive
stage, the new technology focuses on
the use of photons — the particles
that make up light waves— at various
levels of computer structure.
Engineers have already begun to
use optics to connect computers.
Goodman is studying ways of using
optical interconnections at the next
lower level of architecture, for
" module-to-module communication"
within a single machine.
The chief benefit of optical inter
connections would be faster comput
ing. Many processes in the optical
computer would be at the speed of
light, meaning in theory that the com
puter could perform a trillion opera
tions a second. The fastest computers
today can handle about 200 million
operations a second.
Goodman says that interest in op
tics for solving complex communica
tions problems stems in part from the
behavior of light waves. Unlike
streams of electrons, which generate
crosstalk when placed close together,
streams of photons could pass
through one another with virtually no
interference.
Goodman's ultimate goal is to
design computers with dynamic inter
connections that could.be changed
rapidly while still supporting high
speed communications. Computers
with such connections could be
speedily reconfigured, the equivalent
of instantly rewiring a machine, to
meet a variety of needs.
In the envisioned Star Wars sys
tem, high-speed supercomputers

would track incoming missiles and
warheads and distinguish real war
heads from decoys. Hence the need
for the development of high-speed
computers that have great flexibility.
Goodman, who says he has been
working on optical computing since
he obtained his doctorate in 1963
(though only with digital computers
for the last decade), currently
receives funding from NASA and the
Army Research Office, in addition to
the Pentagon, for his research in the
field.
Last year he applied for funding to
the Strategic Defense Initiative Or
ganization, the so-called Star Wars
office of the Defense Department,
and the Pentagon office showed in
terest in financing his research.

"It's suicidal for this nation not to do
