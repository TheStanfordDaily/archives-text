# Detector could take pictures of universe's edge
## 
### JENNIFER SMITH Editorial staff 
Stanford researchers are
working on an electronic picture
taking device that will allow scien
tists to see as far away as the edge
of the universe, 14 billion light
years away.
This device, the NASA God
dard Space Flight Center's Space
Telescope Imaging Spectroscope,
will be placed in the orbiting
Hubble Space Telescope to record
ultraviolet and visible light images
of objects that will appear much as
they did when the universe was
formed.
J. Gethryn Timothy, research
professor in applied physics at the
Center for Space Science and
Astrophysics, is in charge of the
Stanford end of the spectrograph
project that may, he said, ulti
mately lead to the placement of
the telescope on a space station.
Timothy worked with Richard
Bybee of Ball Aerospace in
Boulder, Colo, to invent the multi
anode microchannel array
(MAMA) detector system, a plate
used to collect photons (light par
ticles) for the spectrograph.
The plate has millions of chan
nels drilled into it, each one about
12 microns in diameter, which is
one-fifth the diameter of a human
hair. A photon hits the surface of
the plate and is converted into an
electron which runs down the
channel, producing more elec
trons, enough to create a detec
table pulse. From this, scientists
can determine when and from
where the photons arrive.
"The detector can record
images that are very faint,"
Timothy said, adding it will help
scientists "tackle a number of sci
entific problems. The detector is
sufficiently fast and sufficiently ac
curate to be an almost ideal way to
extract information ffrom space]."

For example, the MAMA de
tector will be able to detect planets
around nearby stars, measuring a
star's wobble resulting from the
gravitational pull of the planets.
And by looking at the ultraviolet
part of the spectrum, scientists can
view very high temperature areas,
such as outer atmospheres of stars
and the energy sources in the
centers of galaxies.
Timothy is currently working on.
the project with two Stanford
graduate students, as well as two
research associates. As the project
expands, he said, there may be a
need for as many as five students.
The space telescope was sched
uled to be launched on the space
shuttle Atlantis in October, with
the spectrograph being inserted by
shuttle astronauts sometime be
tween 1992 and 1995. Because of
the recent explosion of the space
shuttle Challenger, the schedule is
now uncertain.
Timothy explained that a track
ing and data relay satellite to be
used with the telescope was on
board the Challenger when it ex
ploded. If a shuttle were to launch
by July or August with a satellite
aboard, he said, "it would not be
impossible to maintain the
schedule." Once in space the tele
scope will probably be able to or
bit for 30 years.
Before going into space, the de
tector technology will be tested at
the observatory on Mauna Kea on
the island of Hawaii where, ac
cording to Timothy, the elevation
is around 14,000 feet and the at
mosphere is stable.
The telescope, which many sci
entists are regarding as
astronomy's biggest breakthrough
since Galileo's first telescope was
invented, has cost $1.2 billion.
Without a back-up telescope, an
unsuccessful shuttle launch would
mean an end to the project.
