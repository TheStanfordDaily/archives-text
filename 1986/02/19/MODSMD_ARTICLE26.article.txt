## Got the summertime blues? Do D.C. 
### STEVEN LURIE Staff writer 
Every February, students at Stanford
and at universities across the nation begin
worrying about their summer. They want
to find work that will be fun, interesting,
meaningful and look good on their
resumes. These four important, but hard to
satisfy, requirements usually leave stu
dents with the"I don't know what I'm
going to do this summer" blues.
I have some simple advice: Do D.C.
Each summer, thousands of college stu
dents converge on our nation's capital
looking to fulfill those four requirements.
Most students, myself included, find every
thing they were looking for and more. In
addition to the vocational challenges, the
D.C. nightlife tests one's abiltiy to really
enjoy himself.
Catherine Milton, special assistant to the
president, explained how one should go
about finding work in D.C. "A Stanford
student should first visit the Stanford-in-
Government (SIG) office in the Public
Service Center and browse through the
folders full of internship opportunities,"
she said.
Each year, SIG mails questionnaires to
and compiles data from congressional
offices, agencies and interest groups. Bob
Mathews, the chair of SIG, said that the
public service files have recently been
transferred from the CPPC to the Owen
House, and now SIG has truly become the
"clearinghouse" for internships.
Proper selection of a job is vital because
many internships do not pay. Hence,
living, eating and drinking expenses can
quickly add up. While private organiza
tions usually do pay a stipend, compensa
tion for congressional internships depends
upon the individual office. SIG sponsors a
stipend program in which several students
are aided on the basis of financial need and
involvement in SIG. Applications are due
spring quarter.
One must be aware that many jobs can
be clerical — answering constituent mail,
xeroxing and operating automatic
signature machines (sorry, but the senator
does not sign all his form letters) are not
uncommon tasks at all. Most jobs,
however, can be defined by a student's en
thusiasm and capabilities.
While I was an intern I noted that some
fellow interns managed to get by with min
imal work, while others requested and
were assigned special projects. For exam
ple, some interns wrote speeches and posi
tion papers, others followed subcommittee
hearings I, Yor 112 example, compiled a

report analyzing how a wide variety of in
terest groups have rated my senator's
record.
Contary to popular belief, one does not
have to work in a congressional office (on
the "Hill") nor does one have to be a poli

tical science major to intern in D.C. Scott
Reisch, past chair of SIG, worked for two
summers researching a variety of unusual
issues — such as Agent Orange for the
Veteran's Administration.
Also, many opportunities in engineering

and science are available because of the
extensive arms of the federal government.
Senior Pete Peterson used his mechanical
engineering expertise to edit a technical
book put out by the Department of Trans
portation.
In addition to offering many work op
portunites, D.C. also offers academic re
sources not found elsewhere — in particu
lar the Congressional Research Service
(CRS). A division of the Library of
Congress, CRS provides information
packages about current issues which can be
quite useful for future Stanford term
papers.
The major resource, however, is the city
itself. A culturally diverse and energetic
city, D.C. has fine museums, a clean sub
way system and a great nightlife. Since
every state and country is represented in
D.C., one has the opportunity to be
exposed to every conceivable political
viewpoint.
Interest groups often arrange lectures
especially for interns, and I heard speakers
such as Jesse Helms and Ted Kennedy.
Also, many groups sponsor brunches
which function as a social event for interns.
Washington's proximity to major cities
such as New York and Philadelphia means
weekend road trips are a definite pos
sibilty. D.C. provides ample social activity
that centers around the many bars located
in downtown Washington. The drinking
age is only 18, so the bars are loaded with
other college students.
The seasoned intern will know which
happy hours to hit and when. Favorite bars
of mine, located outside the tourist-ridden
and expensive Georgetown section, in
clude the 21st Amendment (named for
that thoughtful piece of legislation) and
the Sign-of-the-Whale (with "All you can
drink for $5" specials).
College dorms near subway stops are the
best places to live. Georgetown and
George Washington Universities rent
rooms to interns. Alternatives include
hotels, personal townhouses and the inex
pensive and convenient youth hostel
(where I stayed). Also, SIG helps students
find housing and contacts alumni for ac
commodations.
If you are looking for an experience this
summer that combines a challenging job
that provides a chance to see how decisions
: are made in this country with an opportu
; nity to meet many interesting and diverse
people, then consider a D.C. internship.
Only in D.C. can one write a speech for a
senator in the morning, attend a lecture in
the day, secretly ride the "Senator's Only"
elevator in between committee hearings
and socialize later with friends.'

Catherine Milton, special assistant to the
president, explained how one should go
about finding work in D.C. "A Stanford
student should first visit the Stanford-in-
Government (SIG) office in the Public
Service Center and browse through the
folders full of internship opportunities,"
she said.
Each year, SIG mails questionnaires to
and compiles data from congressional
offices, agencies and interest groups. Bob
Mathews, the chair of SIG, said that the
public service files have recently been
transferred from the CPPC to the Owen
House, and now SIG has truly become the
"clearinghouse" for internships.
Proper selection of a job is vital because
many internships do not pay. Hence,
living, eating and drinking expenses can
quickly add up. While private organiza
tions usually do pay a stipend, compensa
tion for congressional internships depends
upon the individual office. SIG sponsors a
stipend program in which several students
are aided on the basis of financial need and
involvement in SIG. Applications are due
spring quarter.
One must be aware that many jobs can
be clerical — answering constituent mail,
xeroxing and operating automatic
signature machines (sorry, but the senator
does not sign all his form letters) are not
uncommon tasks at all. Most jobs,
however, can be defined by a student's en
thusiasm and capabilities.
While I was an intern I noted that some
fellow interns managed to get by with min
imal work, while others requested and
were assigned special projects. For exam
ple, some interns wrote speeches and posi
tion papers, others followed subcommittee
hearings I, Yor 112 example, compiled a

report analyzing how a wide variety of in
terest groups have rated my senator's
record.
Contary to popular belief, one does not
have to work in a congressional office (on
the "Hill") nor does one have to be a poli

tical science major to intern in D.C. Scott
Reisch, past chair of SIG, worked for two
summers researching a variety of unusual
issues — such as Agent Orange for the
Veteran's Administration.
Also, many opportunities in engineering

and science are available because of the
extensive arms of the federal government.
Senior Pete Peterson used his mechanical
engineering expertise to edit a technical
book put out by the Department of Trans
portation.
In addition to offering many work op
portunites, D.C. also offers academic re
sources not found elsewhere — in particu
lar the Congressional Research Service
(CRS). A division of the Library of
Congress, CRS provides information
packages about current issues which can be
quite useful for future Stanford term
papers.
The major resource, however, is the city
itself. A culturally diverse and energetic
city, D.C. has fine museums, a clean sub
way system and a great nightlife. Since
every state and country is represented in
D.C., one has the opportunity to be
exposed to every conceivable political
viewpoint.
Interest groups often arrange lectures
especially for interns, and I heard speakers
such as Jesse Helms and Ted Kennedy.
Also, many groups sponsor brunches
which function as a social event for interns.
Washington's proximity to major cities
such as New York and Philadelphia means
weekend road trips are a definite pos
sibilty. D.C. provides ample social activity
that centers around the many bars located
in downtown Washington. The drinking
age is only 18, so the bars are loaded with
other college students.
The seasoned intern will know which
happy hours to hit and when. Favorite bars
of mine, located outside the tourist-ridden
and expensive Georgetown section, in
clude the 21st Amendment (named for
that thoughtful piece of legislation) and
the Sign-of-the-Whale (with "All you can
drink for $5" specials).
College dorms near subway stops are the
best places to live. Georgetown and
George Washington Universities rent
rooms to interns. Alternatives include
hotels, personal townhouses and the inex
pensive and convenient youth hostel
(where I stayed). Also, SIG helps students
find housing and contacts alumni for ac
commodations.
If you are looking for an experience this
summer that combines a challenging job
that provides a chance to see how decisions
: are made in this country with an opportu
; nity to meet many interesting and diverse
people, then consider a D.C. internship.
Only in D.C. can one write a speech for a
senator in the morning, attend a lecture in
the day, secretly ride the "Senator's Only"
elevator in between committee hearings
and socialize later with friends.'

Every February, students at Stanford
and at universities across the nation begin
worrying about their summer. They want
to find work that will be fun, interesting,
meaningful and look good on their
resumes. These four important, but hard to
satisfy, requirements usually leave stu
dents with the"I don't know what I'm
going to do this summer" blues.
I have some simple advice: Do D.C.
Each summer, thousands of college stu
dents converge on our nation's capital
looking to fulfill those four requirements.
Most students, myself included, find every
thing they were looking for and more. In
addition to the vocational challenges, the
D.C. nightlife tests one's abiltiy to really
enjoy himself.
