# Who is Marakon?
## 
### PHIL BLACK Staff writer 
If you are a Stanford basketball fan, you might ask,
"Who is Bemidji State?" If you are an Ayn Rand
reader, you might ask, "Who is John Gait?" But for 55
seniors interviewing at the CPPC last week the most
popular "Who is?" question was "Who is Marakon
Associates?" Well, Andy Eckert didn't tell me any
thing about Bemijdi State or John Gait, but he had
plenty to say concerning Marakon Associates.
Eckert has worked for Marakon since 1983, when he
graduated from Stanford with a degree in industrial en
ginering. He was recently in town to interview some 55
Stanford seniors, and I talked to him during his break
to see why Marakon comes to Stanford to interview.

Marakon and Stanford have had a k e affair since
the inception of the company seven years ago. T wo of
the four original partners graduated from Stanford and
past grads fill the ranks of the small but growing man
agement consulting firm.
Last year, for example, five of the six research as
sociates (RAs) hired were graduates of the Farm.
You can call it prejudice, but according to Eckert,
"year after year Stanford turns out the best people for
Marakon."
I asked Eckert what exactly they were looking for in
a Stanford student's resume. He said, "The resume is
really only a vehicle to talk with someone. The main
thing we look for on a resume is whether or not the
person is busy and involved in school, preferably with
some leadership positions.
"The most important step to gain employment with
Marakon must be taken in your interview. Showing

that you have genuinely learned
something in past work experience
rather than having a lot of jobs that
look good, but from which you gained
nothing, is the most important thing
that a student should convey in the
interview."
Furthermore, Eckert said that
"showing general enthusiasm for the
company and having your thoughts
together allows for a very fruitful in
terview."
Marakon has enjoyed 40 percent
growth per year and has found it ne
cessary to expand its program. The
senior associates were not able to
fully utilize their skills because they
were being shackled by what were,
for them, routine tasks. Conse
quently, last year Marakon initiated
its research associate program.
The research associate program is
especially tailored for people wjth un
dergraduate degrees. The new
graduates come in and take over
some of the responsibility which had
previously been that of the senior as
sociates. This allows the senior as
sociates to interact more with the
clients and the pertinent problems
that need further work.
"The research associate program

has been a great success. It is
economically advantageous for the
firm and for the clients," Eckert said.
"It also allows the research associates
to step into the corporate structure
and take on as much responsibility as
possible."
While the RA program is new, the
management at Marakon has taken
great steps to allow the RAs to in
tegrate themselves as quickly as pos
sible into the firm.

"There is a three-week orientation
program led by one of the four found
ing partners," Eckert explained.
"Afterwards, the research associates
will work on a dry-run case study and
present it to the other members of the
firm. In this way the new people
become acclimated very quickly."
In addition to the orientation and
the case study, each RA is assigned
one senior person who acts as a men
tor throughout his first couple of

years at Marakon.
On the surface, Marakon might
strike you as being any old manage
ment consulting firm. Their compen
sation is competitive with other con
sulting firms, and they will help
clients ranging from Fortune 100
companies to small biotech concerns
with strategy, diversification and
structural planning.
When you dig a little deeper,
though, you will find a dynamic group

of young people making a name tor
themselves in the management con
sulting business. They are small: 35
people in their San Francisco office
and only 10 in Connecticut. However,
Eckert said, "Our size can actually
be advantageous to the employees.
Marakon is not compartmentalized
and allows everyone the chance to
work with the top people. It is a very
interactive firm."
Indeed, it was the size of the firm

coupled with the newness of the re
search associate program that enticed
Jon Christensen to interview with
Marakon. "Marakon has a dynarrjic
young character which is very evident
after talking with the people. The RA
program is only a year old which
leaves a lot of room to explore the
boundaries of responsibility that a re
search associate can shoulder,
Christensen said.
Another Stanford senior who inter
viewed with Marakon Associates
said, "I liked the fact that Marakon is
so small and that you can get involved
so quickly. By the same token,
however, I wasn't too thrilled about
having someone who was only in the
firm for six months interviewing me."
The relative youth of the firm also
gives some concern to potential re
search associates. In fact, Eckert said
that "working for Marakon was a
gamble at first. Three years later,
however, it is better than what I exÂ«-
pected."
"The professional lifestyle of
working on average 50-hours-per
week is a shock at first, but eventually
you love it. And, the fact that you are
definitely learning something and
getting paid good money is a very sat
isfying feeling," he said.

after talking with the people. The RA
program is only a year old which
leaves a lot of room to explore the
boundaries of responsibility that a re
search associate can shoulder,
Christensen said.
Another Stanford senior who inter
viewed with Marakon Associates
said, "I liked the fact that Marakon is
so small and that you can get involved
so quickly. By the same token,
however, I wasn't too thrilled about
having someone who was only in the
firm for six months interviewing me."
The relative youth of the firm also
gives some concern to potential re
search associates. In fact, Eckert said
that "working for Marakon was a
gamble at first. Three years later,
however, it is better than what I exÂ«-
pected."
"The professional lifestyle of
working on average 50-hours-per
week is a shock at first, but eventually
you love it. And, the fact that you are
definitely learning something and
getting paid good money is a very sat
isfying feeling," he said.

If you are a Stanford basketball fan, you might ask,
"Who is Bemidji State?" If you are an Ayn Rand
reader, you might ask, "Who is John Gait?" But for 55
seniors interviewing at the CPPC last week the most
popular "Who is?" question was "Who is Marakon
Associates?" Well, Andy Eckert didn't tell me any
thing about Bemijdi State or John Gait, but he had
plenty to say concerning Marakon Associates.
Eckert has worked for Marakon since 1983, when he
graduated from Stanford with a degree in industrial en
ginering. He was recently in town to interview some 55
Stanford seniors, and I talked to him during his break
to see why Marakon comes to Stanford to interview.

Marakon and Stanford have had a k e affair since
the inception of the company seven years ago. T wo of
the four original partners graduated from Stanford and
past grads fill the ranks of the small but growing man
agement consulting firm.
Last year, for example, five of the six research as
sociates (RAs) hired were graduates of the Farm.
You can call it prejudice, but according to Eckert,
"year after year Stanford turns out the best people for
Marakon."
I asked Eckert what exactly they were looking for in
a Stanford student's resume. He said, "The resume is
really only a vehicle to talk with someone. The main
thing we look for on a resume is whether or not the
person is busy and involved in school, preferably with
some leadership positions.
"The most important step to gain employment with
Marakon must be taken in your interview. Showing

that you have genuinely learned
something in past work experience
rather than having a lot of jobs that
look good, but from which you gained
nothing, is the most important thing
that a student should convey in the
interview."
Furthermore, Eckert said that
"showing general enthusiasm for the
company and having your thoughts
together allows for a very fruitful in
terview."
Marakon has enjoyed 40 percent
growth per year and has found it ne
cessary to expand its program. The
senior associates were not able to
fully utilize their skills because they
were being shackled by what were,
for them, routine tasks. Conse
quently, last year Marakon initiated
its research associate program.
The research associate program is
especially tailored for people wjth un
dergraduate degrees. The new
graduates come in and take over
some of the responsibility which had
previously been that of the senior as
sociates. This allows the senior as
sociates to interact more with the
clients and the pertinent problems
that need further work.
"The research associate program

has been a great success. It is
economically advantageous for the
firm and for the clients," Eckert said.
"It also allows the research associates
to step into the corporate structure
and take on as much responsibility as
possible."
While the RA program is new, the
management at Marakon has taken
great steps to allow the RAs to in
tegrate themselves as quickly as pos
sible into the firm.

"There is a three-week orientation
program led by one of the four found
ing partners," Eckert explained.
"Afterwards, the research associates
will work on a dry-run case study and
present it to the other members of the
firm. In this way the new people
become acclimated very quickly."
In addition to the orientation and
the case study, each RA is assigned
one senior person who acts as a men
tor throughout his first couple of

years at Marakon.
On the surface, Marakon might
strike you as being any old manage
ment consulting firm. Their compen
sation is competitive with other con
sulting firms, and they will help
clients ranging from Fortune 100
companies to small biotech concerns
with strategy, diversification and
structural planning.
When you dig a little deeper,
though, you will find a dynamic group

of young people making a name tor
themselves in the management con
sulting business. They are small: 35
people in their San Francisco office
and only 10 in Connecticut. However,
Eckert said, "Our size can actually
be advantageous to the employees.
Marakon is not compartmentalized
and allows everyone the chance to
work with the top people. It is a very
interactive firm."
Indeed, it was the size of the firm

coupled with the newness of the re
search associate program that enticed
Jon Christensen to interview with
Marakon. "Marakon has a dynarrjic
young character which is very evident
