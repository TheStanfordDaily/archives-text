## 'Boys of summer' play host to St. Mary's 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
It's kind of fitting that with this
weather and all that a team called the
Gaels is coming to the Farm today.
Maybe.
The St. Mary's Gaels — I know it's
not "Gaels" as in wind but it sounds
good anyway — are scheduled to
blow into town to play a baseball
game with Stanford. It should start at
2 p.m. at Sunken Diamond. Well,
best of luck.
At least they should feel right at
home in this wet stuff. And maybe, if
we're fortunate, they'll take some of
it with them back to Moraga. At the
risk of being rude, they can have it.
Last year St. Mary's posted a 32-24
overall mark; one of those losses
came at the hands of Stanford, 14-7
in Moraga.
The Gaels finished second behind
Pepperdine in the West Coast Ath
letic Conference with a league mark
of 14-10.
Pepperdine, you may recall, beat
Stanford in a College World Series
Western Regional game here 5-1
before dropping a 7-1 game to the
Cardinal the next day. The last game
was played for a spot among the eight
teams invited to compete in Omaha,
Neb., for the NCAA title.
That was the last game Stanford
has played against a WCAC team.
The strength of the St. Mary's team
is its pitching. Stanford knows all
about tough pitching, having been
one-hit last Sunday in Hawaii by one
Mike Furtak.
The prize of the Gaels staff is Ken
Rienscat, a bullpen stopper par excel
lence. Rienscat won six games last
year in seven decisions while notching
a team-high 16 saves. To go with his
glittering 2.92 earned run average, he
struck out 83 batters in 68 innings.
Either Steve Ward, 6-7 with a 4.15
ERA last year, or Pete Koukous, 5-5
and 6.12, should start for St. Mary's.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
hadn't decided on today's starter but

said A 1 Osuna, 3-0 with a 3.98 ERA,
might get the call.
Stanford's lineup has undergone
some changes since the team last
played before its home crowd. Right
fielder Toi Cook has been moved
from the seventh spot in the batting
order to leadoff. Cook, though he's
hitting just .255, has stolen 11 bases
in 12 attempts.
Walt Harris, who batted first until
last week's game against Stanislaus
State, now hits fifth. "Harris batting
in the fifth spot," Marquess said, "has
driven in some runs for us.
"We want him up with runners on
base — he's one of our toughest
outs." Although Harris hit only two
home runs in 235 at bats last year, he
sports more power this year, accord
ing to Marquess.

Marquess said he's shaken up the
lineup in the hopes of finding a pro
ductive combination. While his team
is averaging more than nine runs per
outing, that statistic includes the 35-
run explosion against Stanislaus State
that bloats the numbers.
"We still haven't played well of
fensively," Marquess said, "not at all
what we're capable of doing."
Through 12 games Mark Davis is hit
ting .282 with seven RBI, Mike
Deßenon is at .241, Ruben Amaro is
hitting .233 and Mark Machtolf has
slumped to .156.
"I don't know when we'll have one
(a pat lineup)," Marquess said. " It
may be that we never get get things
straight."
