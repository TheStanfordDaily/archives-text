# Committee asks Sakharov to visit
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Ten University faculty, staff and
students yesterday issued an open in
vitation to Soviet physicist Andrei
Sakharov to visit the University and
address the community on world
peace, preferably during Commence
ment week in June.
The Stanford Committee on Dr.
Sakharov's Visit (SCSV) also has
asked the help of Secretary of State
George Shultz and University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy in persuading
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to
allow Sakharov to visit the Univer
sity.
Stanford has not yet lined up a
speaker for the June 15 Commence
ment.
Earlier this month, the four senior
class presidents issued a similar open
invitation to Gorbachev to speak at
Stanford. He is not expected to visit
the United States prior to July.
Last week, actor-comedian Bill
Cosby, the top choice of the senior
class to speak at Commencement,
rejected a formal University invita
tion to address the graduates. A
spokesman for Cosby said the com
edian would not speak at Stanford
because the University refused to
grant him an honorary degree.
Stanford alumnus Ted Koppel,
anchorman of ABC's "Nightline" is
the most likely candidate to receive
the next formal University invitation.
The SCSV will try to persuade
Kennedy to add Sakharov to his list
of possible Commencement speakers,
SCSV chairman Alphonse Juilland
said last night. In addition, the com
mittee will seek support for its invita
tion from the Faculty Senate, the
ASSU and several politicians, includ
ing Sen. Alan Cranston.
"We are even prepared to cover all
the expenses of the trip," he added.
Juilland, professor of French and
Italian, expressed hope that the com
mittee's invitation would raise aware
ness of Soviet human rights viola
tions.
Sakharov, winner of the 1975

Nobel Peace Prize for his opposition
to nuclear weapons, is rumored to be
under house arrest in the Soviet city
of Gorky.
SCSV member Robert Conquest, a
senior fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion, said the invitation might "do
Sakharov a little good" by putting
pressure on the Soviet Union. Even
though chances are slim that the So
viet Union will respond by releasing
Sakharov, "everything that can be
done to help him should be done,"
Conquest asserted.
Stanford physicist Sidney Drell, a
leading member of the U.S. scientific

community rallying for Sakharov's
release, called the invitation "a lovely
gesture."
"I think that (Sakharov) should be
your graduation speaker," he said. "I
could think of nothing better."
Asked whether the Stanford initia
tive might help Sakharov to gain
freedom. Drell said, "You never
know. Every bit of pressure adds up."
In a statement accompanying the
letters to Sakharov, Shultz and Ken
nedy, the SCSV said: "Sakharov's
