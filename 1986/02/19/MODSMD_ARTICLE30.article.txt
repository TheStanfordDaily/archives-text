# Stanford hockey kills columnist's comeback
## 
### 
It happens to the best of us. Our concert
reviewers think they can play guitar, our
opinions writers think they can run the world
(but end up in the ASSU) and our sports
columnists think they can compete on an in
tercollegiate level.
After having confronted reality and retired
as a hockey player after one extremely un
noteworthy season, I was convinced by a
sports editor who shall remain nameless
(although he is not Tom Senf) to lace up the
skates once again for my contribution to the
George Plimpton school of participatory
sportswriting.
So, last week, I threw my equipment bag
into his trunk and we headed down Interstate
280 to Cupertino, where the Stanford hockey
team practices from 11:15 p.m. to 12:30 a.m.
every Tuesday at a rink under the Vallco
Fijshion Park. There are no hockey facilities
on campus, so the hockey team must drive a
half-hour each way just to get to the rink.
Because hockey is a club sport, the team
receives no money from the Athletic Depart
ment. An ASSU fee assessment and money
from the annual appearance by the Harlem
Globetrotters go to the Club Sports program,
and hockey players pay $100 a year to play.
They also drew stadium cleanup duty after
Big Game.
This limits the traveling squad to just 12
players — usually two forward lines, four
defensemen and two goalies. Club President

Scott Bommer said that the team plays better
with two lines, but a third would be appreci
ated at times to give the first two a breather.
Most of those skating last week were on the
B team, which has evolved from a group of
five when I was playing — a group called the
"Rainbow Squad" by then-Coach Pat
Baldwin because none of us had Stanford jer
seys when we started — into a unit with a full
schedule and about 15 players.
That's part of the beauty of club sports —
anyone can play. There were guys out there
with an obvious abundance of talent, but
there were also guys playing their first season
of competitive hockey and one who hadn't
played in two years.
At a time when we hear too much about the
commercialization of college sports and how
football and basketball players should be
open professionals, it's somewhat reassuring
to find guys who are not only not receiving
full-ride scholarships, but who are paying
$ 100 a year to play.
And to find a team where desire and not
talent is the first prerequisite.
Return of the Mailbag
It's human nature, I guess. When you write
something that everyone likes, no one tells
you. But alienate just one reader — then
you'd better take cover. This came in the mail
last week:
John Lis, in his so-called "Sports" column

of Feb. 11, called for more support for the
Stanford (men's) basketball team, even if that
support were in the form of unsportsmanlike
conduct. He cites McKale Center in Tucson,
the home of the Arizona Wildcats, as "the ul
timate in this type of harassment.
Has John ever attended a game in McKale
Center? I doubt he was present in Tucson on

the first Thursday of the quarter when Stanford
lost to Arizona. If he were there, he might have
learned something about sportsmanlike sup
port from the McKale Center crowd.
In case you didn't know, John, McKale
Center is almost twice the size of Maples
(Pavilion), seating over 13,300 people and at
tendance has averaged over 12,000 for Pac-10
games this year. Simply the size is intimidat
ing
Finally, John, neither has Maples been free
of what you call unsportsmanlike conduct and
claim is necessary to give Stanford a fair
chance to compete in the Pac-10.

I agree with you, John, that the Stanford
men's basketball team deserves our support,
which they got Saturday (Feb. 8) in the exciting
upset of Arizona but was lacking in the win
over UCLA. Your claim that we must resort to
unsportsmanlike conduct in order to make up
for obnoxious crowds at road games, however,
is inaccurate and unfounded, especially in your
use of Mc Kale Center as a prime example of a
nasty home crowd. . ..
Maybe, John, you should use your column
to support the teams in a positive way rather
than telling Stanford students that they must
sacrifice their personal dignity in order to have
a winner, which is obviously more important
to you than competitive, exciting games.
Maybe you should write more about the
women's basketball team, which deserves
some attention. . ..
I hope you give both the women and the men
the positive support they need both in your
column and at the games.

Whoa. Let's look at this point by point.
Jan. 9 at McKale Center in Tucson:
Arizona 77, Stanford 69. If you bother
reading the basketball articles, Timothy, you
would've noticed the dateline "TUCSON,
Ariz." at the beginning of that game story,
right under my byline. That means I was

there. If you want, I'll mail you my pass,
Timothy.
When I was there, I sat at the press table at
courtside. Behind me were some very loud,
obnoxious individuals. When a call went
against the Wildcats, they would get up, lean
over the writers in front of them and scream
at the officials. The fans on the other side also
loudly protested, even when the call was ob
vious and even Wildcat Coach Lute Olson
had to agree with it.
The next night I talked with Stanford
Director of Marketing Jim Colton, Stanford
Sports Information Director Steve Raczynski
and KZSU's David Fisher, and we agreed that
Arizona's fans were the most obnoxious we
had seen in the Pac-10, and that it would help
the Stanford program if the crowds in Maples
weren't as dead as they have been. I'm not
alone in this assessment.
Of the seven arenas (actually six arenas and
Harmon Gym) that I've been in, McKale is, as
you put it, "a prime example of a nasty home
crowd." No question.
As for having a winner being more impor
tant than having close, exciting games — I
confess. It's true. I'd rather see Stanford
soundly thrash Washington State than lose in
overtime to Arizona State. I admit it.
I know I'm probably in the minority. I'm
sure Lou Campanelli said to his California
