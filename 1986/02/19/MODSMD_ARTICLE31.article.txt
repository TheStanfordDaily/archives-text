# New mark set by Card harriers at Millrose meet
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
One out of two isn't bad, especially
when one's a new school record. This
weekend four of Stanford's premier
distance runners journeyed east to
compete in a couple of indoor track
meets. One was a little disappointing,
but the other produced a record.
First came the record. It was set at
the Millrose Games, the country s
most prestigious indoor track meet
Friday night in Madison Square Gar
den. With 19,000 fans watching, the
Cardinal two-mile relay team of Jeff
Atkinson, Brian Conoily, Brian Pet
tingill and Christian Skoog blazed to
a heat victory and the second fastest
collegiate time of the night.
The team's time of 7:32.4 is a new
school school record, according to
Stanford Coach Brooks Johnson. It
was, as Atkinson said, "a tasty vic
tory. We got good performances out
of everybody."
The race was especially significant

for Pettingill, as the trip marked his
last collegiate competition. Pettingill
is a fifth-year senior who has used his
four years of outdoor eligibility, so his
career ended with the indoor season.
In a way it was also the end of a
circle for Pettingill. Five years ago he
was a high-school mile champion at
the very same Millrose Games.
Millrose was a success, but the trip
wasn't over yet.
The next stop was Sunday's George
Mason Invitational. The team's goal
was to qualify some individuals for
the NCAA championships, but it
wasn't realized. Maybe it was jet-lag,
maybe it was just plain fatigue, but
they couldn't turn it on again.
"If Madison (Square Garden) was
tasty, that one was putrid," Atkinson
said.
To borrow a track term, one could
call the road trip a split. Stanford won
in New York and lost at George
Mason. But as the record book will
now show, the win was a big one.
