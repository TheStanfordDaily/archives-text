# Netters up in the air about match

### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
Whether or not Stanford and the
University of the Pacific will meet in
women's tennis this season is a ques
tion that not even the two teams'
respective coaches seem able to an
swer.
Yesterday's scheduled 1:30 p.m.
match between the host Cardinal and
the Tigers was cancelled due to
threatening skies and was promptly
rescheduled for today at the same
time. "The match has been
tentatively rescheduled for tomor
row," Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said yesterday.
Tentatively, indeed. Tiger Coach
Gordon Graham called Brennan later
yesterday to reschedule the makeup
match. "We've got kids who can't
make it (today) because of tests,"
Graham said.
Graham indicated that the two
teams would probably wait until
March to hook up. But wait. Back
came Brennan to further muddle up
the situation.
"Although they (UOP) are one of
our best warmup matches, when it
gets into the season, it's hard to re

schedule," Brennan said, explaining
that the match may never be played.
The final status of the elusive
Stanford-UOP women's tennis match
— a definite maybe. "If we're able to
work it in, we will," Brennan said.
If Arizona has not been afflicted by
the same downpours that have hit the
Bay Area, the No. 1 Cardinal will
return to action this weekend with
away matches Friday at Arizona State
and Saturday at Arizona.
Both ASU and Arizona arc ranked
in the Top 20 and will represent
the Cardinal's most difficult competi
tion to date. Brennan was not sure,
however, which Stanford women
would take to the courts this
weekend.
"I'll have to see who has been hit
ting," he said, noting that the persis
tent rain has kept some of the Card
inal from practicing. "Some have had
a chance to practice on indoor
courts."
Stanford rooters will have to wait
until Monday when the Cardinal
hosts San Jose State in (you guessed
it) a makeup match to see heralded
freshmen Marianne Werdel and Eleni
Rossides perform. Neither competed
in Stanford's opening-match victory
over Santa Clara.
