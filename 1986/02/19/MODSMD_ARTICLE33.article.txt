Ice hockey
Despite the heroics of sophomore
Scott Bommer who tallied twice in a
5-4 loss to Arizona State on Satur
day and added a goal and an assist in
Sunday's 6-3 defeat, the Stanford
hockey team's losing streak
stretched to seven games.
"We were in both games but just
couldn't pull the trigger," Bommer
said of the Cardinal which fell to 6-
16-1.
The Sun Devils were protecting a
two-goal lead in the third period
when Bommer came alive with a
goal on a penalty shot and then
found the net with a blast from just
inside the blue line.
ASU was able to sandwich a goal
between Bommer's tallies, however,
to account for the final 5-4 verdict.
Danny Ammon opened the
scoring on Sunday with an assist
from Bommer, but the Sun Devils

struck back with three-straight goals
to take a 3-1 lead into the second
period.
Bob Mulroy countered for the
Cardinal to open the second period,
but ASU ripped off another three
poal string to put the game out of
reach.
The Cardinal will return to
Arizona Friday for a two-game set
with Arizona in Tuscon. and then it
will be back to the Bay Area
Belmont Iceland for an 8:30 p.m.
match with the Belmont Bums.
Sunday's game is also Fan Ap
preciation Night for the Cardinal,
and the team is providing a keg of
the usual beverage to highlight the
evening's festivities.
Women's rugby
Led by the excellent play of the
strong forward pack, the Stanford

women's rugby team improved its
league record to 2-1 by soundly
defeating Santa Cruz 14-0 on Feb. 8.
The Cardinal dominated the
game, keeping the ball in the Santa
Cruz end of the field throughout.
Stanford scored early after
Melanie Domres faked a couple of
defenders and passed to Andi Wol
pert, who ran for the try. Wolpert
kicked the conversion, making the
score 6-0. Near the end of the first
half, the Cardinal forwards pushed
their opponents back to their goal
line. From a scrum, Ann Latham
received a pass from Jennifer Chue
to score a try, making the score 10-0
at the end of the half.
The forwards once again set up
the next score. After retaining pos
session of a loose ball, Kate Wade
emerged from a maul and swiftly
made her way down the field,
evading tackles along the way. Stan
ford pushed its way to Santa Cruz'

goal line, where the ball was
knocked loose. Lisa Yanney alertly
fell on the ball and scored the last
points of the game.
Saturday, the Cardinal ruggers
will travel to the University of San
Francisco for what may amount to
be a practice game. USF has just
started up its women's rugby team
again after folding a few years ago,
and the Dons may not be able to
field a full team. In this case, Stan
ford would give a couple of its
players to USF for a scrimmage. The
match will not count in the league
standings.
Synch swimming
While California manhandled
Stanford in basketball Saturday
night, the Cardinal synchronized
swimmers defeated the Bears in an
equally convincing but less

publicized fashion earlier in the day
at the Cal Invitational.
Stanford's Leslie Tackett was
sensational, winning the solo, duet
and trio events as well as the senior
figures. In the duet, she paired with
Dee Cohen to capture first place.
Tackett and Cohen then teamed
with Jeri Lane to take the trio.
The Cardinal demolished the
Bears in the novice figures competi
tion, accounting for the top six fin
ishers. Jane Abraham led the Stan
ford sweep, finishing in first place.
The team routines were the only
events that saw Cal victorious. The
Bears' eight-woman A team
defeated the Cardinal's eight, and
Cal's five-woman B squad knocked
off Stanford's six-woman B team.
"They shouldn't have beat us (in
the team routines)," Stanford's Mar
cia Fetterman said. "We're working
real hard so we can slaughter them
next time."

the next score. After retaining pos
session of a loose ball, Kate Wade
emerged from a maul and swiftly
made her way down the field,
evading tackles along the way. Stan
ford pushed its way to Santa Cruz'

goal line, where the ball was
knocked loose. Lisa Yanney alertly
fell on the ball and scored the last
points of the game.
Saturday, the Cardinal ruggers
will travel to the University of San
Francisco for what may amount to
be a practice game. USF has just
started up its women's rugby team
again after folding a few years ago,
and the Dons may not be able to
field a full team. In this case, Stan
ford would give a couple of its
players to USF for a scrimmage. The
match will not count in the league
standings.
Synch swimming
While California manhandled
Stanford in basketball Saturday
night, the Cardinal synchronized
swimmers defeated the Bears in an
equally convincing but less

publicized fashion earlier in the day
at the Cal Invitational.
Stanford's Leslie Tackett was
sensational, winning the solo, duet
and trio events as well as the senior
figures. In the duet, she paired with
Dee Cohen to capture first place.
Tackett and Cohen then teamed
with Jeri Lane to take the trio.
The Cardinal demolished the
Bears in the novice figures competi
tion, accounting for the top six fin
ishers. Jane Abraham led the Stan
ford sweep, finishing in first place.
The team routines were the only
events that saw Cal victorious. The
Bears' eight-woman A team
defeated the Cardinal's eight, and
Cal's five-woman B squad knocked
off Stanford's six-woman B team.
"They shouldn't have beat us (in
the team routines)," Stanford's Mar
cia Fetterman said. "We're working
real hard so we can slaughter them
next time."
