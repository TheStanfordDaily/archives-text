U.S. Embassy in Portugal bombed
LISBON, Portugal — A car bomb exploded last night on the grounds
of the U.S. Embassy, sparking a smoky fire in the garden and flames a
story high. Embassy guards and other witnesses said there were no injur
ies.
A Portuguese security guard employed by the Embassy to check all
vehicles entering the area said a man drove into the compound, jumped
from the car and ran out the gates in a matter of seconds.
The burning car, a twisted and burning wreck, was about 20 feet inside
the compound gates, and there was no apparent damage to the
guardhouse, some 10 feet from the vehicle, or to other cars parked
nearby.
The Embassy building itself, a brick and concrete structure formally
dedicated last year, was more than 100 yards away and was apparently
untouched by the blast.
Tutu helps quiet S. African rioting
ALEXANDRA, South Africa — Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu
yesterday helped quell an angry crowd and bring at least a temporary lull
in the rioting that has rocked this black township for four straight days.
The government put the toll since Saturday at 19 dead, 16 of whom
were shot by police and three others who were killed by rioters, includ
ing one black policeman. But local residents and clergymen said at least
27 blacks had died.
After painstaking negotiations, police allowed Tutu, last year's Nobel
peace laureate, to accompany a small delegation of local black ministers
to a soccer stadium in the sealed-off riot zone.
There he addressed a mass meeting of 25,000 residents who
demanded that security forces withdraw from the area and release the
dozens of persons arrested since Saturday.
The crowd gradually dispersed after Tutu's pledge to deliver a list of
grievances to police, according to witnesses.
A police spokesman last night described the situation as "extremely
quiet," the first break in four days of continual violence that saw armed
rioters shooting at police and local black township officials deemed
"sellouts" to white-minority rule.
Rumors fuel Haitian demonstration
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Rumors and suspicions about the new
government's intentions yesterday erupted here into a demonstration
that the army broke up with tear gas.
It was the first time that tear gas had been used by the government
that took over on Feb. 7 with the departure of President Jean-Claude
Duvalier.
There was no indication that the unrest would spread, though the ten
sion was fueled by a spate of rumors of students being shot in their class
rooms, or Duvalier returning to Haiti.
Yesterday's incident demonstrated the power of the rumor in the
present circumstances. The five-member National Council has not
gained the full confidence of the people in part because it is made up
largely of members of the old Duvalier regime, and the new government
has kept its long-range plans to itself.
The demonstration appeared to have resulted from several factors,
some apparently planned, some spontaneous. First, groups of youths
took to the streets and chanted that all government should be closed
down until the authorities both announce a date for elections and dismiss
all the members of the government who served under Duvalier.
Mubarek, Arafat peace talks stall
CAIRO, Egypt — President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Yasser
Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, concluded a
third round of talks yesterday without bridging a rift between the PLO
and Jordan that is threatening to break up a Middle East peace effort.
Mubarak, acknowledging that the two sides are still far apart, told
reporters after a final 90-minute meeting with Arafat that "matters of
destiny" are at stake and that resolving the differences over them will
"require give and take for a long time."
He said that King Hussein of Jordan, who apparently showed no signs
of further compromise in talks with a senior Egyptian official whom
Mubarak sent to the Jordanian capital on Monday is now the
"cornerstone in the problem."
But "contacts are continuing between Mr. Arafat and King Hussein,"
he said, and added that high-level discussions will be resumed in Jordan
within the next few days. "The PLO," he said, "is still on the path of
peace, and the negotiations are not over."
Arafat made no statement to reporters as he emerged from the
meeting.
The current crisis in the long and tortuous peace process is said to cen
ter on Hussein's anger over Arafat's refusal to accept unconditionally
U.N. resolutions No. 242 and No. 338, which implicitly recognize Israel
but speak of the Palestinians only as refugees without endorsing their
demands for statehood.
Israelis continue to search Lebanon
JERUSALEM — An Israeli seamat was killed and at least eight vil
lagers were wounded yesterday in southern Lebanon as reinforced Is
raeli forces expanded their search for two of their soldiers captured in a
guerrilla ambush a day earlier.
The Israeli military command in Tel Aviv said that Cpl. Daniel Amar,
19, was killed on a naval patrol craft by gunfire from shore. The navy is
monitoring key intersections along the main coastal road near Tyre to
shut off the road as a possible escape route for the guerrillas.
The Israeli command confirmed that it had sent large reinforcements
across the border into Lebanon. But a senior military source emphasized
that the goal was "not to retake Lebanon and not to expand or enlarge"
the security zone that Israel had established in southern Lebanon.
The reinforcements, supported by tanks, armored personnel carriers,
helicopters and other heavy equipment, have been ordered to seal off
"specific areas where we have some intelligence that the hostages and
the terrorists may be," the source said.
A senior Israeli officer said the army will continue to search in south
ern Lebanon "as long as we don't have any proof that they're not there."
He said three of the victims had reportedly been wounded in the vil
lage of Bir Assanassil, north of Tibnine, when an Israeli patrol fired into
a local shop.
The Israeli officer suggested that any civilian casualties "could have
been from gunfire other than ours." He specifically denied U.N. reports
that Israeli helicopter gunships were conducting "search by fire" opera
tions north of the border.
Party boss ousted from Politburo
MOSCOW — Victor Grishin. the former Moscow party boss who
spent 25 years in the top echelons of power, was ousted yesterday as a
member of the ruling Politburo. 1
Grishin's removal symbolized Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's
drive to purge the party of "old guard" officials accused of corruption
and cronyism.
The man who replaced Grishin in the key Moscow post last year. Boris
Yeltsin, 55, was elevated yesterday to non-voting membership in the
Politburo by an assembly, or plenum, of the Communist Party Central
Committee.
Western diplomats believe that Grishin tried to block Gorbachev's
accession to the top post following the death of Konstantin Chernenko
last Match. Not long afterward, Soviet newspapers began a series of
highly critical articles about the Moscow party apparatus, apparently
aimed at Grishin and his key subordinates.

tions north of the border.
Party boss ousted from Politburo
MOSCOW — Victor Grishin. the former Moscow party boss who
spent 25 years in the top echelons of power, was ousted yesterday as a
member of the ruling Politburo. 1
Grishin's removal symbolized Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's
drive to purge the party of "old guard" officials accused of corruption
and cronyism.
The man who replaced Grishin in the key Moscow post last year. Boris
Yeltsin, 55, was elevated yesterday to non-voting membership in the
Politburo by an assembly, or plenum, of the Communist Party Central
Committee.
Western diplomats believe that Grishin tried to block Gorbachev's
accession to the top post following the death of Konstantin Chernenko
last Match. Not long afterward, Soviet newspapers began a series of
highly critical articles about the Moscow party apparatus, apparently
aimed at Grishin and his key subordinates.
U.S. Embassy in Portugal bombed
LISBON, Portugal — A car bomb exploded last night on the grounds
of the U.S. Embassy, sparking a smoky fire in the garden and flames a
story high. Embassy guards and other witnesses said there were no injur
ies.
A Portuguese security guard employed by the Embassy to check all
vehicles entering the area said a man drove into the compound, jumped
from the car and ran out the gates in a matter of seconds.
The burning car, a twisted and burning wreck, was about 20 feet inside
the compound gates, and there was no apparent damage to the
guardhouse, some 10 feet from the vehicle, or to other cars parked
nearby.
The Embassy building itself, a brick and concrete structure formally
dedicated last year, was more than 100 yards away and was apparently
untouched by the blast.
Tutu helps quiet S. African rioting
ALEXANDRA, South Africa — Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu
yesterday helped quell an angry crowd and bring at least a temporary lull
in the rioting that has rocked this black township for four straight days.
The government put the toll since Saturday at 19 dead, 16 of whom
were shot by police and three others who were killed by rioters, includ
ing one black policeman. But local residents and clergymen said at least
27 blacks had died.
After painstaking negotiations, police allowed Tutu, last year's Nobel
peace laureate, to accompany a small delegation of local black ministers
to a soccer stadium in the sealed-off riot zone.
There he addressed a mass meeting of 25,000 residents who
demanded that security forces withdraw from the area and release the
dozens of persons arrested since Saturday.
The crowd gradually dispersed after Tutu's pledge to deliver a list of
grievances to police, according to witnesses.
A police spokesman last night described the situation as "extremely
quiet," the first break in four days of continual violence that saw armed
rioters shooting at police and local black township officials deemed
"sellouts" to white-minority rule.
Rumors fuel Haitian demonstration
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Rumors and suspicions about the new
government's intentions yesterday erupted here into a demonstration
that the army broke up with tear gas.
It was the first time that tear gas had been used by the government
that took over on Feb. 7 with the departure of President Jean-Claude
Duvalier.
There was no indication that the unrest would spread, though the ten
sion was fueled by a spate of rumors of students being shot in their class
rooms, or Duvalier returning to Haiti.
Yesterday's incident demonstrated the power of the rumor in the
present circumstances. The five-member National Council has not
gained the full confidence of the people in part because it is made up
largely of members of the old Duvalier regime, and the new government
has kept its long-range plans to itself.
The demonstration appeared to have resulted from several factors,
some apparently planned, some spontaneous. First, groups of youths
took to the streets and chanted that all government should be closed
down until the authorities both announce a date for elections and dismiss
all the members of the government who served under Duvalier.
Mubarek, Arafat peace talks stall
CAIRO, Egypt — President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Yasser
Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, concluded a
third round of talks yesterday without bridging a rift between the PLO
and Jordan that is threatening to break up a Middle East peace effort.
Mubarak, acknowledging that the two sides are still far apart, told
reporters after a final 90-minute meeting with Arafat that "matters of
destiny" are at stake and that resolving the differences over them will
"require give and take for a long time."
He said that King Hussein of Jordan, who apparently showed no signs
of further compromise in talks with a senior Egyptian official whom
Mubarak sent to the Jordanian capital on Monday is now the
"cornerstone in the problem."
But "contacts are continuing between Mr. Arafat and King Hussein,"
he said, and added that high-level discussions will be resumed in Jordan
within the next few days. "The PLO," he said, "is still on the path of
peace, and the negotiations are not over."
Arafat made no statement to reporters as he emerged from the
meeting.
The current crisis in the long and tortuous peace process is said to cen
ter on Hussein's anger over Arafat's refusal to accept unconditionally
U.N. resolutions No. 242 and No. 338, which implicitly recognize Israel
but speak of the Palestinians only as refugees without endorsing their
demands for statehood.
Israelis continue to search Lebanon
JERUSALEM — An Israeli seamat was killed and at least eight vil
lagers were wounded yesterday in southern Lebanon as reinforced Is
raeli forces expanded their search for two of their soldiers captured in a
guerrilla ambush a day earlier.
The Israeli military command in Tel Aviv said that Cpl. Daniel Amar,
19, was killed on a naval patrol craft by gunfire from shore. The navy is
monitoring key intersections along the main coastal road near Tyre to
shut off the road as a possible escape route for the guerrillas.
The Israeli command confirmed that it had sent large reinforcements
across the border into Lebanon. But a senior military source emphasized
that the goal was "not to retake Lebanon and not to expand or enlarge"
the security zone that Israel had established in southern Lebanon.
The reinforcements, supported by tanks, armored personnel carriers,
helicopters and other heavy equipment, have been ordered to seal off
"specific areas where we have some intelligence that the hostages and
the terrorists may be," the source said.
A senior Israeli officer said the army will continue to search in south
ern Lebanon "as long as we don't have any proof that they're not there."
He said three of the victims had reportedly been wounded in the vil
lage of Bir Assanassil, north of Tibnine, when an Israeli patrol fired into
a local shop.
The Israeli officer suggested that any civilian casualties "could have
been from gunfire other than ours." He specifically denied U.N. reports
that Israeli helicopter gunships were conducting "search by fire" opera
tions north of the border.
