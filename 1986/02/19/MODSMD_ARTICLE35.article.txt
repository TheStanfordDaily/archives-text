# Reagan seeks aid to Contras
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” President Reagan launched
a new drive yesterday for a $100 million aid pack
age to rebels fighting the Sandinista government of
Nicaragua, including a resumption of military aid.
But congressional Democrats immediately ex
pressed opposition and White House officials ac
knowledged that the proposal would be Reagan's
most difficult legislative battle this year.
In a meeting with Republican congressional
leaders, Reagan said "we have to do more" to help
the Nicaraguan rebels, also known as contras.
"You can't fight attack helicopters piloted by
Cubans with Band-Aids and mosquito nets," he
added.
The Administration is seeking $30 million in
overt, non-lethal aid, such as clothing and medical
supplies, and $70 million in covert military assis
tance for the contras, officials said. Congress
barred military aid in 1984 but last year approved
$27 million in nonlethal assistance, which expires
March 31.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman
Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) said Reagan also wants to
lift all restrictions placed by Congress on the aid
last year when it ordered the administration to
channel the funds through the State Department,
instead of the Defense Department or the Central
Intelligence Agency.

The $70 million request for covert military aid
falls under the jurisdiction of the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence where Chairman David
Durenberger (R-Minn.) has expressed opposition
to aid to the rebels. In the House, Rep. Lee Hamil
ton (D-Ind.), chairman of the Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence, has in the past opposed
covert aid and also declined comment yesterday.
White House officials said some details about the
Reagan proposal are still being worked out, includ
ing whether the $70 million can be
"reprogrammed" from existing funds.
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told con
gressional leaders yesterday that military programs
have been "cut to the bone" and more money can
not be squeezed out for the contras, but Secretary
of State George Shultz said some key lawmakers
have urged the Administration not to seek addi
tional funds for the military aid, but rather to
redirect money already appropriated.
White House officials said Reagan intends to use
his trip to Grenada tomorrow, as. well as meetings
with lawmakers this week, to press the issue. He is
expected to make a formal presentation of the aid
package next week or the week after, officials said.
Lugar said Reagan was offering a "good pro
gram," but other Republicans, as well as Reagan's

advisers, predicted that the package would be
Reagan's toughest legislative fight in 1986.
Rep. William Broomfield (R-Mich.), ranking
Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Commit
tee, said, "1 think it's going to be a very hard pro
gram to sell. The opposition is already gearing up
to oppose military aid and conditions (in Congress)
haven't changed that much" since the last vote.
Broomfield said the Administration's request is
likely to be cut. "Congress is not going to turn its
back on the contras," he said. "But obviously their
chances are better of getting humanitarian aid,"
rather than military aid.
Rep. Michael Barnes (D-Md.), chairman of the
House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Western
Hemisphere affairs, said he was "very disap
pointed" in Reagan's proposal. "It's a direct slap in
the face to our friends in the hemisphere who are
concerned about the course we are taking," he said.
Barnes noted that the House has five times rejected
military aid to the rebels, but stopped short of
predicting that Reagan's proposal would fail.
A spokesman for the Nicaraguan Embassy here
said the request was "very detrimental" to the
Contadora regional peace process "and can only
bring our two countries further down the path
toward military confrontation."
