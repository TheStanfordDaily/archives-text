# U.S. warns Marcos about aid

WASHINGTON â€” Special U.S.
envoy Philip Habib has warned
Philippine President Ferdinand
Marcos that he must make demo
cratic reforms and share power with
opposition forces headed by Corazon
Aquino or risk losing U.S. military
and economic aid, administration of
ficials said yesterday.
These officials did not specify how
Marcos should or could accomplish
these goals, particularly in view of the
opposition's refusal thus far to con
sider a place in his government. The
officials emphasized that President
Reagan had not decided whether aid
should be withheld and would not
reach a conclusion until he receives a
report from Habib, expected late this
week.
Senate leaders, meanwhile, agreed
on the wording of a bipartisan resolu
tion condemning the Feb. 7
Philippine election, which Reagan
said Saturday was "marred by
widespread fraud and violence per
petrated largely by the ruling party."
The Senate measure is expected to
pass easily today.
A spokesman for Senate Foreign
Relations Committee Chairman

Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) said that "we
will move next week in our commit
tee to cut off the aid." On the House
side, Rep. David Obey (D-Wis.),

chairman of the House Appropria
tions subcommittee on foreign opera
tions, said new aid to the Philippines
"would be outrageous under the cir

cumstances.
But some congressional opinion
appeared to be moving beyond an aid
cutoff toward a demand that Marcos
step aside.
The spokesman for Lugar, who
headed the official U.S. team that ob
served the election, said Marcos
"should prove his election was
credible or he should step aside."
At the White House, officials tried
to avoid definitive statements until
Habib reports to the president.
Other U.S. emissaries have
delivered messages of warning to
Marcos in the past, but there is "a far
greater urgency now, in the wake of
the election," a White House official
said. While the United States is press
ing Marcos for economic reforms, the
key demand is the retirement of 29
senior military officials and changes
in the military command structure.
Until now, Marcos has announced
only the retirement of controversial
armed forces chief of staff Fabian
Ver, but even this was clouded in the
U.S. view because Ver, a cousin of
Marcos, was retained as an adviser.
