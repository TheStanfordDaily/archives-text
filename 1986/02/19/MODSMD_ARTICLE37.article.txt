Key facts disclosed
WASHINGTON — William Rogers, chairman
of the presidential commission investigating the
space-shuttle disaster, told White House Chief of
Staff Donald Regan last Friday that he was
"appalled" to learn that key information about
the shuttle's condition had not reached top space
agency officials before the disastrous Jan. 28
launch, Administration sources said yesterday.
Specifically, according to a senior official,
Rogers told Regan in a telephone call that Jesse
Moore, associate administrator of space flight for
NASA, had not been informed about low
temperature readings on the shuttle, a fact that
Moore confirmed yesterday at a Senate hearing
on the Challenger explosion last month. Rogers
also said Moore had not been told about pressure
brought by National Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration (NASA) officials on Morton
Thiokol, makers of the solid-rocket boosters, to
concur in the launch decision.
Capsule use uncertain
WASHINGTON — U.S. drug manufacturers
reacted quickly to the latest Tylenol poisoning

scare by meeting yesterday with federal govern
ment officials to discuss the future of non
prescription drugs in capsule form.
However, the companies made it clear that
they have no intention now of abandoning this
popular drug form despite the decision of
Tylenol's maker, Johnson & Johnson Co., to stop
selling any over-the-counter drugs in capsules.
In announcing its decision Monday, Johnson &
Johnson said it no longer could "guarantee the
safety of these capsules." The company's deci
sion came just nine days after a New York
woman died from taking a Tylenol capsule laced
with cyanide and four days after another bottle of
poisoned Tylenol was discovered in a nearby
New York suburb. Johnson & Johnson said it
would use "caplets" — elongated, encoded
tablets — in place of capsules.
Defense cuts estimated
WASHINGTON — Congressional budget
authorities estimated yesterday that President
Reagan's $320.3 billion defense budget would
have to be reduced by $49 billion if automatic
spending cutbacks are triggered this fall under
the new Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget

balancing law.
This would mean "a very different defense es
tablishment than is envisioned by the president,"
Congressional Budget Office Director Rudolph
Penner told the Senate Budget Committee after
submitting the CBO report containing the
defense cutback estimate.
It was the first official projection from
Congress of defense appropriations cutbacks that
would be required under Gramm-Rudman-
Hollings for fiscal 1987. As such, the numbers
were quickly seized by Budget Committee
leaders as new ammunition in the push for a
budget compromise, possibly including tax in
creases, to avert the automatic cuts.
Stocks hit record high
NEW YORK — The bulls were loose on Wall
Street again yesterday, driving the market to an
other record high.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at
1678.78, up 14.33 from Friday's close.
big Board volume totaled 160.2 million
shares, against 139.92 million in the previous ses
sion.
