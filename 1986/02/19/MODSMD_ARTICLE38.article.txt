Deukmejian runs again
SACRAMENTO — Gov. George Deuk
mejian formally launched his re-election cam
paign yesterday with a brief televised speech ask
ing Californians to let him lead them to "a second
California gold rush" of opportunity and
prosperity.
The Republican governor's announcement was
only a formality, making official a re-election
campaign which has been operating near full
speed for over six months and has already raised
$4.78 million toward a goal of $8 million.
Emergency state exists
SAN FRANCISCO — Gov. George Deuk
mejian declared a state of emergency in Hum
boldt, Napa and Sonoma counties yesterday as
rescuers continued to airlift hundreds of storm
refugees to high ground. At least 10 persons were
reported killed in the worst series of storms to hit
California in years.

The governor toured the California's flood
operations center in Sacramento yesterday,
where he was told that almost all of Northern
California's massive system of reservoirs, rivers
and dams is at or near capacity. Officials were
hoping that any break in the weather would keep
the worst problems under control.
Extradition is approved
SAN FRANCISCO — A divided federal ap
peals court ruled yesterday that former Irish Re
publican Army member William Ouinn may be
extradited to England on charges of murdering a
London constable, rejecting arguments the kil
ling was a political crime exempt from extradi
tion.
Ouinn is expected to appeal. He was arrested
in September 1981 in Daly City and has been
held without bail despite a 1983 decision by U.S.
District Judge Robert Aguilar the killing was part
of a "political uprising" and not subject to ex
tradition.

Tibbie was shot three times while pursuing a
fleeing suspect. Quinn was arrested in Ireland
two months later, but was accused and convicted
only of being a member of the outlawed IRA and
was released in early 1976.
He was arrested again five years later in Cali
fornia, where he had lived both before and after
his visit of several years to Northern Ireland.
Identified by Tibbie's partner, Quinn was
charged with the murder and with conspiring to
plant six bombs in England in 1974 and 1975.
Under a rule of international law incorpted
into most extradition treaties, including the one
between the United States and Great Britain, ex
tradition is prohibited for crimes the host country
regards as political.
