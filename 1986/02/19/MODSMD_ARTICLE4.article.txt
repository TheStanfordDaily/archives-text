# Proposals could cost millions

Proposed changes in federal reimburse
ment for research expenses could cost Stan
ford $1.5 million this year and up to $10
million in 19K7-88, according to Assistant
Provost Frederick Biedenweg.
"If this goes through," said Earl Cilley,
director of the Sponsored Projects Of
fice,"we either reduce the amount of re
search we do or increase the amount of
money we raise."
"I would guess it will end up being a little
bit of both," he added.
Stanford administrators cautioncd that
the impact of the change depends on a mul
titude of factors, but they agree that the
University would be hurt even more
severely if the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
amendment leads to cuts in federal funding
for University research.
The cost-cutting changes, proposed last

Wednesday by the White House Office of
Management and Budget (OMB), would af
fect all federally sponsored research at Stan
ford, capping the rate of administrative
overhead that the government would pay
the University for research projects.
The University is not just upset about the
money involved. Many are also upset at the
30-day comment period.
"This issue is utterly central to the con
duct of research at American universities,"
according to Larry Horton, associate vice
president for Public Affairs. Horton said
that a 30-day comment period was
"lightning quick" for such a fundamental
change.
In addition, the research community com
plains that the proposal was developed with
out consulting universities.
An OMB spokesman, who asked not to
be named, said both actions were necessary
to save time. "With the deficits we are
facing, we didn't have a lot of time to

debate," he said.
He added that 30 days is the standard per
iod for comment, and, when asked if that
might be extended for this issue, his reply
was "No." He said OMB already knows that
universities will complain about the cuts.
"We feel that these (indirect costs) are ex
cessive charges and should be brought in
line," he said.
"This will provide more funding of re
search because the money will go for more
research rather than for more overhead,"
the OMB official said.
Cilley, however, said that due to relentless
budget cutting at Stanford, "There's not a
whole hell of a lot to cut."
"If the government doesn't want to pay
the costs (of research)," he added, "then the
government ought to decrease the number
of grants it issues overall."
Frank Riddle, associate controller, said
that he thinks it is likely that Stanford will be
able to negotiate a one-year delay in imple
mentation of the rule.
