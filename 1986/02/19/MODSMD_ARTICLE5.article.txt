# Indirect cost explained
## 
### 
The Controller's Office employs a virtual army of
accountants to manage Stanford's indirect cost
recovery program, hut that should not intimidate
the curious.
The money alone should raise your eyebrows.
Last year, Stanford received about $60 million
from the government to offset indirect costs on
federal research projects. That $60 million was the
second largest source of revenue for the Univer
sity's 1985 operating budget, which funds every
thing from professors' salaries to campus mainte
nance. The largest budget source was student tui
tion and fees.
Indirect costs essentially are expenses that ac
countants cannot link directly to a particular re
search project.
A single campus chemistry building, for instance,
might house 10 research projects. Each project has
direct costs, such as chemicals and microscopes, ttyit
can be charged to it. But the 10 projects also share
certain costs, such as the building's electricity bills,
its maintenance and the salaries of the Chemistry
Department's accountants.
Those shared expenses are called indirect costs.
