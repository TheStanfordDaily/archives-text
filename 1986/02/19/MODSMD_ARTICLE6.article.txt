## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
Four Chilean student government leaders last
night praised Stanford's democratic government
and called on the United States to adopt a more
definite policy toward their country during an
open forum at a special ASSU Senate meeting.
Speaking through an interpreter, the group's
spokesman lomas Jocelyn-Holt, president of
the Catholic University of Chile Students' Fed
eration, told senators that the group attended
the meeting to observe Stanford's democratic
student government.
Holt explained that the group was invited by
the U.S. State Department to visit the United
States for one month. With Holt was Estevan
Valenzuela. the vice president of the Catholic

University of Chile Students' Federation. Pavlo
Andueza and Domeyko, vice president of the
Youth National Party and a senator at the Uni
versity of Chile, were also present.
Holt said the four students have addressed
Pentagon and State Department officials.
Holt asked the United States not to assist the
Chilean government financially, claiming that
"this will destroy Chile's economy." Referring
to the dictatorship established in Chile by
Augusto Pinochet in 1973. Holt labeled mone
tary aid to Chile "money for a dictatorial
regime."
In an interview after the senate meeting. Holt
summarized Chile's history of democracy, start
ing with the constitutional regime established in
1833 after Chile attained independence from

Spain. Holt cited the "rational transfer of
power, the checks and balances and the empha
sis on social progress" as descriptive of Chile's
constitutional regime.
In 1973 "a lunatic began to direct the
country," and these democratic institutions
began to collapse, he said.
"We feel the undermining of democracy
should cease immediately," Holt said, adding
that if Chile can replace its dictatorship with a
social democracy, it "will be an example to all of
Latin America."
Comparing the role of students in Chile with
that of American students during the Vietnam
War protests and civil rights movements in the
19605, Holt explained that Chilean student
bodies hold "great influence in national policy."
He said that before 1980 only student gov

ernments had retained free elections. With stu
dent governments as their impetus, labor unions
and professional organizations have begun to
"put pressure on the government to let them
have free elections."
"These elections say everything," Holt said.
Even though the government allows no free na
tional elections, the smaller groups' elections
"enable one to see what the people are think
ing "
Holt said 1986 is a "year of great tension and
social disorder" in the movement to "establish a
rational, civilized government."
"The country will insist on its liberties," Holt
said, adding that Chile's movement to "finish
off the military regime" needs international
support "to maintain peace and avoid a civil
war."
