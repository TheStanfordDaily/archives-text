Toyota. The fact that each of these
names is so easily recognizable is
evidence of the large Japanese influ
ence in U.S. culture. Most
Americans, though, know little of
Japanese culture.

Feature

However, this American ignorance
of Japanese culture will not last for
long — on the Farm, at least. The
Stanford Overseas Studies Office
plans to open a campus in Kyoto,
Japan sometime during the 1987-88
academic year.
According to Director of Overseas
Studies Tom Heller, the new program
in Japan is part of the Overseas
Studies Office's effort to create more
opportunities outside of Europe.
"Given Stanford's location on the
West Coast and the variety of
changes which have taken place since
beginning our other overseas pro
grams, it is absolutely essential to
make opportunities available in other
parts of the world," he said.
Heller also stressed the advantages
of such a program for preprofessional
students. "International experience is
essential for careers these days," he
said.
The program in Japan, according to
Heller, will be very different from
other Stanford overseas programs.
"The new center will be tailorized to
its environment," he explained.
There will initially be two programs
operating in Kyoto: a six-month
science-oriented program and a nine
month program that would be com
mitted to more traditional studies.
The six-month program will be
operated through the "Stanford Cen
ter in Technological Innovation,"
which planners in the Overseas
Studies Office hope to build in Kyoto.
During spring quarter students will
participate in highly structured in
struction, followed by a three-month
summer internship with Japanese and
U.S. businesses in Tokyo and Osaka.
This program will be aimed at
people studying computer science,
political economy and management.
"It will be a limited exposure to
Japan, but we hope that the student
will complement it with opportunities
available after graduation," Heller
said.
Heller commented that he sees this
program as fulfilling a "national ser
vice goal" which has never been
developed in the United States. The
hope, according to Heller, is that
some students will continue an
"ongoing involvement with Japan.
They will be technically trained and
capable of operating in Japanese in
stitutions and with the language."
Stanford is attempting to make the
center a joint project between

Japanese and U.S. universities and
industrial firms, Heller said. This
cooperative venture would encourage
interaction of Japanese and U.S. ex
ecutives, government officials, faculty
and students from the undergraduate,
graduate and post-doctoral levels.
According to Heller, a major por
tion of the program will take place
outside of the classroom, and"the
facility must be adequate to encour
age this kind of sustained interac
tion," he said.
Because of the business-related na
ture of the program. Heller has been

working out logistics of the program
with Masahiko Aoki, a professor of
economics here, and others.
Aoki called the program "the best
ever proposed by an American uni
versity He said that the best aspects
of the program are its rich cultural
and historical setting and its many op
portunities for practical training for
students who aim to become leaders
in U.S. society in business, engineer
ing and other industries.
According to Heller, many fac
tors went into the choice of Kyoto as
a site for the new program. The pres
ence of a local student population,

substantial faculty abroad to partici
pate in such a program and the possi
bility for both Stanford faculty and
students to interact with various
groups in the host country all played a
part in the decision, he said.
The University of Kyoto, which
will coordinate with Stanford in the
program, is one of the best public uni
versities in Japan, according to His
tory Prof. Peter Duus. Aoki noted
that the university has had four Nobel
laureates in the past, and mentioned
that it has a very strong engineering
program.
Kyoto also has other benefits. The
city, according to Aoki, is considered
"the Florence of the East." It was the
ancient capital of Japan during the
Heian period, and is rich in history.
Duus noted that the city is also close
to Kobe and Osaka, which are the
leading economic centers of Japan.
At this point the Overseas Studies
Office is still negotiating the con
struction of the center. Land in Japan
is limited and expensive, Heller ex
plained, and some financial, legal and
administrative questions still need to
be resolved.
But if everything goes as planned,
the academic year program should
open in September 1987, the Center
in Technological Innovation in the
spring of 1988. So far, things look
good.
"Prime Minister Nakasone is inter
ested in the internationalization of
Japanese education and people in
government and industry are encour
aging," said Heller.
Heller plans to meet with inter
ested students to discuss plans for the
new center on Feb. 24 at noon in Ter
man lounge.

Japan, but we hope that the student
will complement it with opportunities
available after graduation," Heller
said.
Heller commented that he sees this
program as fulfilling a "national ser
vice goal" which has never been
developed in the United States. The
hope, according to Heller, is that
some students will continue an
"ongoing involvement with Japan.
They will be technically trained and
capable of operating in Japanese in
stitutions and with the language."
Stanford is attempting to make the
center a joint project between

Japanese and U.S. universities and
industrial firms, Heller said. This
cooperative venture would encourage
interaction of Japanese and U.S. ex
ecutives, government officials, faculty
and students from the undergraduate,
graduate and post-doctoral levels.
According to Heller, a major por
tion of the program will take place
outside of the classroom, and"the
facility must be adequate to encour
age this kind of sustained interac
tion," he said.
Because of the business-related na
ture of the program. Heller has been

working out logistics of the program
with Masahiko Aoki, a professor of
economics here, and others.
Aoki called the program "the best
ever proposed by an American uni
versity He said that the best aspects
of the program are its rich cultural
and historical setting and its many op
portunities for practical training for
students who aim to become leaders
in U.S. society in business, engineer
ing and other industries.
According to Heller, many fac
tors went into the choice of Kyoto as
a site for the new program. The pres
ence of a local student population,

substantial faculty abroad to partici
pate in such a program and the possi
bility for both Stanford faculty and
students to interact with various
groups in the host country all played a
part in the decision, he said.
The University of Kyoto, which
will coordinate with Stanford in the
program, is one of the best public uni
versities in Japan, according to His
tory Prof. Peter Duus. Aoki noted
that the university has had four Nobel
laureates in the past, and mentioned
that it has a very strong engineering
program.
Kyoto also has other benefits. The
city, according to Aoki, is considered
"the Florence of the East." It was the
ancient capital of Japan during the
Heian period, and is rich in history.
Duus noted that the city is also close
to Kobe and Osaka, which are the
leading economic centers of Japan.
At this point the Overseas Studies
Office is still negotiating the con
struction of the center. Land in Japan
is limited and expensive, Heller ex
plained, and some financial, legal and
administrative questions still need to
be resolved.
But if everything goes as planned,
the academic year program should
open in September 1987, the Center
in Technological Innovation in the
spring of 1988. So far, things look
good.
"Prime Minister Nakasone is inter
ested in the internationalization of
Japanese education and people in
government and industry are encour
aging," said Heller.
Heller plans to meet with inter
ested students to discuss plans for the
new center on Feb. 24 at noon in Ter
man lounge.

Datsun. Hitachi. Honda. Sony.
Toyota. The fact that each of these
names is so easily recognizable is
evidence of the large Japanese influ
ence in U.S. culture. Most
Americans, though, know little of
Japanese culture.

However, this American ignorance
of Japanese culture will not last for
long — on the Farm, at least. The
Stanford Overseas Studies Office
plans to open a campus in Kyoto,
Japan sometime during the 1987-88
academic year.
According to Director of Overseas
Studies Tom Heller, the new program
in Japan is part of the Overseas
Studies Office's effort to create more
opportunities outside of Europe.
"Given Stanford's location on the
West Coast and the variety of
changes which have taken place since
beginning our other overseas pro
grams, it is absolutely essential to
make opportunities available in other
parts of the world," he said.
Heller also stressed the advantages
of such a program for preprofessional
students. "International experience is
essential for careers these days," he
said.
The program in Japan, according to
Heller, will be very different from
other Stanford overseas programs.
"The new center will be tailorized to
its environment," he explained.
There will initially be two programs
operating in Kyoto: a six-month
science-oriented program and a nine
month program that would be com
mitted to more traditional studies.
The six-month program will be
operated through the "Stanford Cen
ter in Technological Innovation,"
which planners in the Overseas
Studies Office hope to build in Kyoto.
During spring quarter students will
participate in highly structured in
struction, followed by a three-month
summer internship with Japanese and
U.S. businesses in Tokyo and Osaka.
This program will be aimed at
people studying computer science,
political economy and management.
"It will be a limited exposure to
Japan, but we hope that the student
will complement it with opportunities
available after graduation," Heller
said.
