# Heart-lung director seeks more donors
## 
### LIZ EGAN Editorial staff 
Cardiovascular surgeon Dr. John Baldwin has
been named the new director of the Stanford Medi
cal Center's heart-lung transplant program.
Baldwin will succeed Dr. Stuart Jamieson, who
has been named professor of surgery and chairman
of cardiovascular surgery at the University of Min
nesota. Jamieson will also direct a new Minnesota
Heart and Lung Institute.
"It's exciting to see such bright young surgeons
come through our program," said Dr. Norman
Shumway, transplant pioneer and chairman of
Stanford's Department of Cardiovascular Surgery.
"The patient care and scientific investigation in
volved with heart-lung transplantation will con
tinue to develop under John Baldwin. He is a
Rhodes Scholar with outstanding intellectual and
research qualifications and superlative surgical and
medical skills."
Shumway added that Baldwin's internal
medicine training should bring extremely useful in
sight into both the management of patients follow
ing surgery and the ability to explore research
questions on a broad basis.
Baldwin said he is interested in solving the prob
lem of scarce donors, one of the major hurdles to
expansion of the therapeutic technique.
He plans to find ways to use a wider range of
donors, including older people, and to preserve the
donor heart and lungs for longer periods of time
outside the body.

"The program has been incredibly successful so
far, so I don't see any very big changes," Baldwin
said. "Any changes in the next few years that are
made will result from tests in the laboratory on im
proved methods for lung preservation."
New techniques developed in Stanford's car
diovascular surgery laboratories involve transport
ing the donor organs in solutions that have been
developed to match the lung's composition. Ac
cording to Baldwin, the lung is one of the most dif
ficult organs to preserve.
Transporting organs outside the body extends
the geographic distance teams can travel to collect
organs and "helps solve some of the human rela
tions issues involved with families, who may be
reluctant to allow the body of a loved one to travel
to another city for removal of vital organs," accord
ing to Baldwin.
"We will be able to develop [the technique] fur
ther and improve it . . . and then be able to offer
transplants to more patients," he said.
The heart-lung transplant program evolved from
Stanford's research and clinical experience in heart
transplantation, which started with Shumway's
early animal experiments in the 19505.
These were followed with one of the world's first
human heart transplant operations in January
1968. Then in March 1981, the world's first suc
cessful combined heart-lung operation at Stanford
was performed on a 45-year-old Arizona woman,
Mary Gohlke, \\ho currently is reported active and
healthy.
Since then, Stanford has performed a total of 405

heart transplants on 371 people (some patients
received more than one transplant). According to
Shumway, the technique has been improved to the
point where about 83 percent of the patients have
survived at least a year.
The Stanford team has also performed 31 heart
lung transplant operations on 30 patients.
Fifteen people are currently waiting for heart
lung transplantation donors at Stanford. Because of
the donor shortage, the Stanford team has never
been able to perform more than seven operations
in a year.
Baldwin decided to become a cardiovascular sur
geon when, as a Stanford medical student in the
early '70s, he trained under Shumway. After
graduating in 1975, he completed residency at
Massachusetts General Hospital in internal
medicine and subsequently in general surgery.
Baldwin said he decided to include internal
medicine in his training after consulting with Shum
way while still a medical student at Stanford. He
said this experience provided "useful perspective in
the post-operative management of patients."
"The two major problems following both the
heart and the heart-lung transplantations are rejec
tion and infection," Baldwin said.
Rejection and medication to prevent rejection
have been central concerns of Stanford's transplant
research. It was the pioneering work at Stanford
and elsewhere on a new immunosuppressive drug,
cyclosporine, which facilitated the first heart-lung
operations at Stanford in 1981.

"The two major problems following both the
heart and the heart-lung transplantations are rejec
tion and infection," Baldwin said.
Rejection and medication to prevent rejection
have been central concerns of Stanford's transplant
research. It was the pioneering work at Stanford
and elsewhere on a new immunosuppressive drug,
cyclosporine, which facilitated the first heart-lung
operations at Stanford in 1981.
