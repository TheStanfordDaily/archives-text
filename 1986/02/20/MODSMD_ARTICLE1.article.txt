# Other colleges raising tuition
## 
### KRISTEN BROWN Staff writer 
The University's 6.8 percent in
crease in 1986-87 tuition and room
and board approved by the Board of
Trustees last Tuesday is comparable
to tuition hikes recently announced at
other private universities.
Last Friday, Brown University ap
proved a 7.3 percent increase over
last year's tuition and room and
board costs. Princeton University
recently announced a 6.96 percent in
crease, and Yale University installed
a 6.8 percent boost.
Each of these increases is lower
than the respective increases for
1984-85, which were: Stanford, 7.5
percent; Brown, 8.2 percent; Prince
ton, 7.3 percent and Yale, 7.7 per
cent.
Although these institutions
lowered their increases from those of
1984-85, it is not yet known whether
other universities will do the same.
Many schools do not finalize tuition
rates for the upcoming year until late
February, March and April.
The Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Board of Trustees will
make its decision on the first Friday
in March. MIT is traditionally one of
the last schools to decide tuition,
room and board rates, according to
Len Gallagher, MITs director of fi
nancial aid.
Harvard University's Board of
Trustees will meet Monday to vote on
its proposal for student fees. North
western University and the Univer
sity of Southern California will wait
until mid-March and early April,
respectively, before finalizing student
fees.
This year, MIT topped the list for
the highest combined tuition-room
and board fee. Harvard ranked
second and Stanford was sixth, be-
hind Yale, Princeton and Dartmouth
Stanford's tuition has had an
average annual increase of 10.1 per
cent since 1970-71, a rate slightly
higher than the 9.1 percent rate of in
crease for national personal dis
posable income.
The University of California
campuses' tuition for in-state under
graduates will remain the same next
year, as it has for the past two years.
It ranges from $1,286 to $1,388 at
the various campuses.
Room and board at UC on-campus
residence halls will vary from $2,692
to $4,249, a 6 percent increase over
this year's total, according to Lilia
Villanueva, information officer at
UC-Berkeley's Office of the Presi
dent.
