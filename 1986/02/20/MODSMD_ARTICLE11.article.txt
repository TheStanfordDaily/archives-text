# Letter confesses shanty destruction
## 
### 
The Daily yesterday received an anonymous letter claiming responsi
bility for the destruction of the White Plaza shantytown.
Three wood and cardboard structures erected last month to call atten
tion to the miserable living conditions of South African blacks were
razed early on the morning of Feb. 9, and police have been unable to lo
cate those responsible.
The letter reads:
"To the Stanford community:
"I am writing anonymously — representing four friends and myself —
concerning the recent publicity about the shantytown destruction. To
put it briefly, we arc responsible and terribly embarrassed about the
entire incident.
"Late Saturday (Feb. 8) night, my friends and I were experiencing the
effects of'magic' mushrooms. We were wandering through White Plaza
and came across the shantytown, which none of us had seen before.
Given our altered states of mind, the emotional impact of the exhibit was
overwhelming. We were all distressed by the display of abject poverty,
misery and suffering, and at the time, we felt that we needed to do some
thing about it.
"Obviously, we did the wrong thing and feel badly. Had we been in
'sober' states, the destruction would not have occurred. We are not
racists. As a matter of fact, we are all supporters of the oppressed people
of South Africa, and we support the fight for divestment.
"Please accept our apologies."
