Gorbachev, Cosby, Koppel, Sakharov, Reagan,
Cronkite â€” the list of potential commencement
speakers is impressive. Unfortunately, Stanford's ef
forts to select and invite one of these men have been
most unimpressive.
Marred almost from the beginning by sloppy hand
ling and bad luck, this year's invitation process has
begun to resemble a comedy of errors.
The senior class presidents got the ball rolling last
November when they distributed a questionnaire to
fewer than 100 seniors asking them to indicate whom
they would most like to hear at graduation. On the
basis of this not very exhaustive poll, it was determined
that the top three choices were actor/comedian Bill
Cosby, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and ABC
anchorman Ted Koppel. Other contenders were Presi
dent Reagan, Bishop Desmond Tutu and former CBS
anchorman Walter Cronkite.
Shortly thereafter, a group of students began a peti
tion drive to persuade the University to send the invi
tation to Gorbachev. The campaign to invite the Soviet
leader won nationwide press coverage and spurred
much public debate on campus.
The senior class presidents early this month mailed
Gorbachev a formal invitation to speak at commence
ment or to visit Stanford at his convenience. Unfortun
ately, the intent of the invitation was somewhat
clouded by the fact that an accompanying cover letter
from University President Donald Kennedy did not
specifically ask Gorbachev to visit during commence
ment.
Confusion worsened a few days later when it became

known that the senior class presidents had asked Ken
nedy to invite Cosby. Was the seniors' letter to Gorba
chev really an invitation to speak at commencement
after all?
According to Senior Class President Patrick Shan
non, the invitation to Gorbachev was not specifically
aimed at getting the Soviet leader to speak at com
mencement. Why, then, does the letter explicitly invite
Gorbachev "take part in our June 15, 1986 Com
mencement ceremonies?"
From the outset, negotiations to secure Cosby as a
speaker were conducted publicly. Senior Class Presi
dent Leslie Darwin told The Daily Feb. 6 that Ken
nedy's office had been in contact with Cosby's agent.
Even before any invitation was sent, the fact that Stan
ford wanted Cosby to speak was public knowledge. As
it turned out, Cosby decided not to come unless Stan
ford promised him an honorary degree, and the Cosby
invitation fell through.
Now Stanford is stuck. Whomever the senior class
presidents decide to invite will come here as an openly
acknowledged "third choice."
As they continue their efforts in the next few weeks
to land a commencement speaker, the senior class
presidents and the University should proceed with
more careful planning. Furthermore, to avoid embar
rassment to the speaker finally chosen, negotiations
with prospective speakers ought to be removed from
the public eye.
If such blundering and confusion continue, the
seniors may file into Stanford Stadium on June 15 to
face an empty podium.
