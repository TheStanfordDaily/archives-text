Racism has many
colors and forms
I am writing in reference to the ar
ticle entitled "Speaker says goal of
racism is continuation of white race"
(Daily, Jan. 10). I find I must take
issue with one of the underlying as
sumptions, either of the speaker or
the staff writer who reported on Dr.
Welsing's remarks.
Dr. Welsing is quoted as defining
racism as the "patterns of percep
tions, language and actions . .. the
goal of which is white survival," and
further "that the terms
'discrimination', 'apartheid' and
'prejudice' mean 'white
supremacy.' " It appears from these
definitions that these terms can apply
only to actions, perceptions and
prejudices tending to support white
supremacy, and it is with this that I
cannot agree. While it is certainly
possible to apply these terms to or
ganized or disorganized white
supremacy movements (which I un
derstand to be the actual context of
Dr. Welsing's remarks), limiting them
to such movements obscures the fact
that racism is by no means limited to
whites. While white racism may well
be the cause of black unemployment
and lack of education, artificially
limiting the definition of racism to
what I have called "white racism"
ignores the fact that if we are ever to
achieve a society where true equality
reigns, we must eliminate all forms of
racism.
A quick look in the dictionary indi
cates that all three definitions given
apply to this discussion, and none of

them restrict themselves to any one
race.
Considering the amount of emo
tion already coloring the debate on
which policies are and are not racist
(and what is to be done about those
that are), such muddy definitions can
do little but cause more confusion.
They may also obscure valid argu
ments, such as Dr. Welsing's appears
to have been.

Biased viewpoint
missed the mark
As an interested parent of a junior
at Stanford, I would like to ask that
you publish an answer to Stacey
Ley ton's viewpoint ("We must stop
patronizing the Third World") in
your fine paper.
Hooray for the high school student
debaters Stacey was asked to judge.
They had the wisdom and courage to
evaluate information they had gained
from their own sources and "talked
about U.S. security, about our strate
gic interest, about Nicaragua being a
Soviet puppet and El Salvador facing
the same future if the FDR/FMLN
(the politico-military opposition)
were to win."
As for Stacey, where is her source
of information that is better and more
accurate than the sources of the high
school debaters?
Stacey listens to her own sources â€”
which are incredibly biased and inac
curate if they tell her in the "liberated
zones, areas of the country which are
controlled by the guerilla forces (El

Salvador) . . . the people govern
themselves. Free elections are held.
Health and education are the top
priorities. People live without fear of
violence, at least when the govern
ment planes aren't bombing them."
What is her source that the high
school students aren't privy to?
Stacey goes on to write, "Our ar
rogance and paternalism is astound
ing." Doesn't she show a bit of ar
rogance and paternalism toward the
high school students she was asked to
judge? Did a little power go to
Stacey's head? Dissent is con
structive. Stacey is so far off mark,
she needs to be answered. May I sug
gest that our nation is only active in
countries where the local population
is being controlled by power outside
its own country? The direction their
government is taking is not their free
choice. El Salvador has had free elec
tions, Nicaragua has not.
Our government (as a republic, we
citizens freely elect these representa
tives, so it is our government) is act
ing in its judgmental position with
access to far more information than
Stacey, the high school students or
Stanford professors (who may be
Stacey's source of "the truth").
Does Stacey support her own gov
ernment? Please ask Stacey if she is
registered to vote. Please ask Stacey
if she votes.
