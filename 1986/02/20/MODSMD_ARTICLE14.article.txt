## Davies' rejection raises questions 
### 
The History Department's rejection of Prof.
Davies' candidacy for a professorship (The Daily,
Feb. 14) is a shock not only to many historians, but
to everyone interested in promoting an under
standing of Slavic culture in the West. To tt'l of
them. Prof. Davies is known as the world's pre
eminent living historian of Poland.

OLEG JARDETZKY

Particularly alarming is the manner in which the
rejection was accomplished. This raises fundamen
tal questions about the adequacy of the academic
process at Stanford and about the factors which
currently determine academic decisions at this Uni
versity.
Scholarship and excellence in teaching are
clearly not at issue in this case. The unanimous rec
ommendation of the search committee headed by
Prof. Emmons, and of the numerous outside experts
consulted by him, adequately attests to that. Neither
are the importance of the field and the availability
of the position relevant issues, since a chair of East
European Studies exists and has been vacant since
1978. One is prompted to ask: What are the issues?
The element of surprise and the lack of previous
inquiry reported by Prof. Emmons indicate, first of
all. an irregularity in the process. Open and thor
ough discussion of all points of view is the very
basis of an academic community. Search commit
tees are required to document their recommenda
tion and to take the time to make certain that the
documentation meets the highest standards of
scholarship. Should others who vote on appoint
ments not be held to the same standards? Should

they not be required to give due notice of an oppos
ing view and to give others the opportunity to eval
uate its merits? If the case of the opponents had
merit, why was it not brought to the attention of the
search committee in due course? Since it was not,
why did the chairman allow a vote without allow
ing time for a scholarly evaluation of the opposi
tion's point of view?
The case of Prof. Davies has profound implica
tions for the functioning of the academic decision
making process at Stanford. If at any step in the
process we allow a departure from the standards of
scholarly evaluation, are we not making mockery of
those steps that were taken with scholarly care and
are we not abandoning academic standards in favor
of a purely political process? The academic com-

munity will need to ask: is this an isolated instance,
or is this occuring throughout the University?
Blanket assurances from administrative officers
that proper procedure has been followed, but that
the details are confidential, mean little. Do we not
know that secrecy not only protects the innocent,
but is also a haven of corruption?
We need not know the specific issues which Prof.
Robinson wishes to keep confidential to recognize

that the adequacy of the process he followed is
open to serious question. But we have a right to
wonder what the real issues are. Studies of Slavic
cultures are seriously under-represented at Stan
ford. Green Library records can show that since
1917 I am the only steady user of Stanford's many
excellent sources on Polish and Russian history.
Does that mean that Slavic culture is unimportant
in comparison with others? Prof. Davies' English
writings provide ample evidence that this cannot he
the case. Is it conceivable that there is a resistance
to things Slavic at Stanford? Those who think this is
far-fetched should simply count the number of
genuine ethnic Slavs (Poles. Russians and others)
on the Stanford faculty. It is remarkably small rela
tive to their fraction in the U.S. population. Does
that mean that Slavs are intellectually inferior and
generally don't meet the standards of Stanford ap
pointments? If so, how do their empires manage to
threaten our national security? Or is it conceivable
that their ways are foreign to the other cultures
represented in larger numbers at the University
and that we are dealing with an unrecognized form
of subtle ethnic discrimination against a minority
that is even too small to be recognized on a par with
other minorities, and against those who speak for
it?
These are fundamental questions that we, as
members of the academic community, need to an
swer. The Dean of Humanities and Sciences and
the Provost would be well advised to re-evaluate
Professor Davies' case, lest the level of Slavic
studies and the academic process at Stanford
remain at the level of a Polish joke.

munity will need to ask: is this an isolated instance,
or is this occuring throughout the University?
Blanket assurances from administrative officers
that proper procedure has been followed, but that
the details are confidential, mean little. Do we not
know that secrecy not only protects the innocent,
but is also a haven of corruption?
We need not know the specific issues which Prof.
Robinson wishes to keep confidential to recognize

that the adequacy of the process he followed is
open to serious question. But we have a right to
wonder what the real issues are. Studies of Slavic
cultures are seriously under-represented at Stan
ford. Green Library records can show that since
1917 I am the only steady user of Stanford's many
excellent sources on Polish and Russian history.
Does that mean that Slavic culture is unimportant
in comparison with others? Prof. Davies' English
writings provide ample evidence that this cannot he
the case. Is it conceivable that there is a resistance
to things Slavic at Stanford? Those who think this is
far-fetched should simply count the number of
genuine ethnic Slavs (Poles. Russians and others)
on the Stanford faculty. It is remarkably small rela
tive to their fraction in the U.S. population. Does
that mean that Slavs are intellectually inferior and
generally don't meet the standards of Stanford ap
pointments? If so, how do their empires manage to
threaten our national security? Or is it conceivable
that their ways are foreign to the other cultures
represented in larger numbers at the University
and that we are dealing with an unrecognized form
of subtle ethnic discrimination against a minority
that is even too small to be recognized on a par with
other minorities, and against those who speak for
it?
These are fundamental questions that we, as
members of the academic community, need to an
swer. The Dean of Humanities and Sciences and
the Provost would be well advised to re-evaluate
Professor Davies' case, lest the level of Slavic
studies and the academic process at Stanford
remain at the level of a Polish joke.
