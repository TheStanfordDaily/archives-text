# In school, fear is the key

### 
At about 10 p.m. on a night in the spring quarter of my
junior year, my roommate and I began working on the
term papers we had been assigned for an English class.
The papers were to be 10-12 pages long, brief but incisive
treatments of some literary theme common to the novels
we had been assigned that quarter. Although both of us
had had ample time to consider what we would write and
how we would write it, neither had actually begun writing
until roughly 12 hours before the papers were due. At 3
a.m., Brian's typewriter broke. Sitting in the bleak light of
the ceiling bulb (my desk lamp, the only one in the room,
had given out some months earlier), we began taking
turns on my Smith-Corona, one of us typing for 20

minutes or so while the other wrote in longhand the page
he would type when his turn came. We drank coffee dark
as oil, hunched over the humming, clacking machine; and
when dawn came and broke the coffee's hold, there
resonated in my head a chorus of voices, singing to me in
full harmony words in a rich, alien tongue.
1 handed the paper in with a few minutes to spare,
walked back to my dorm and slept for six hours. Later on,
I began to wonder whether the whole night had not been
an exercise in irresponsibility and procrastination. Was I
alone in these frantic last-ditch efforts? Could my ills be
cured by something as simple as a little discipline? Cer
tainly, I thought, the students in the foreign aid class I had
taken the previous quarter must have been more diligent
than I in researching and writing their 25-page term
papers well in advance.
1 remembered handing that paper in. 1 had spent the
last three nights and all that day in front of a word proces
sor, and at five minutes before 5 that afternoon, 1 hopped
on my bike, clutching the bulky printout of my work, and
rode furiously toward the History Corner. Sandstone
blurred past as I flew by the Quad, but I pedaled even
harder as panic filled my chest: What if they closed the
building early? What if 1 was one minute too late?
Something peripheral caught my eye. I turned to see a
girl from my section riding neck and neck with me. I
thought her one of the best students in the class: ag
gressively articulate, poised, confident and terribly bright.
Here she was now, panting and bent over the handlebars
of her bike, giving me a tight smile as we whizzed past
German Studies, and as it registered on me that she, too,
must have only minutes ago finished her paper, two more
guys joined us on the right, flanking me now so we sailed
down the bike path in a flying wedge, and when we
reached the Poli Sci building I did not come to a complete
stop, but hit the ground running, letting the bike roll for
10 yards before it clattered to the pavement. 1 ran up the
steps and handed the paper in just as they were locking
the place; and as I descended the steps, I saw that people

were still trickling in, one every 30 seconds or so, to slip
their thick packets of hard copy under the glass doors. •
Incidents such as these have convinced me that I am not
alone in my 1 lth-hour labors: many bright, gifted people
keep me company. Upon meeting in an airport the father
of a friend of mine, an anthropology scholar and human
rights activist, I was struck by the man's rumpled clothing
and bloodshot eyes. I asked if the flight had been particu
larly rough, and he replied no, that he was simply feeling
the effects of a night spent staring at a PC screen. He had
been working on a jointly written book about politics in
Latin America and had turned in his part of the final draft
15 minutes before it was due. I asked how far in advance
he had been given the deadline. "Six months," he said.
Consider that for a moment: Hfere was a renowned
scholar, a published author in the field of political science,
a tenured professor of anthropology at MIT, and the map
had just pulled an all-nighter.
Not everyone works this way, of course. Some people
simply get things done early. I often wonder why they can
do it and 1 cannot. Is it merely a case of "either got it or
you ain't"? I cannot believe the ability to compose with
out deadline pressure is in any way linked with intelli
gence: I know too many people who far outstrip me in
that area, but nevertheless put off work of this nature until
the last minute. Neither can I accept that such ability
depends solely upon pure discipline, or even on the simple
desire to "get it done early." I always want to get it done
early. I have admitted to my inclination to put off work,
and therefore have, on occasion, forced myself into action
by sheer effort of will. It doesn't work. The product of my
self-imposed discipline was no match for the flow of ideas
brought about by the sickening fear of a deadline.
I should clarify two points. The* frest is that *1 do not
defend the "last-ditch effort" as an effective way of
working. I do not condone it. I do not, above all, advise it.
Those of you planning to castigate me for merely
rationalizing my own shortcomings may sheathe your
weapons. Second, it should be clear by now that I am
speaking primarily about writing; and if writing is not
quite synonymous with thinking, it comes pretty close.
Since I am concerned here with the inability to complete a
written assignment until the deadline is upon you, I am
therefore talking about the incapacity for thought until
sheer desperation simply makes one think, and about
those for whom any kind of creative outpouring or intel
lectual issuing-forth does not occur until fear takes hold.
Anxiety is the spark plug of the brain. I believe, at least
here at school, and most likely out in the working world,
that we are all motivated at some level by fear. Some
people simply feel it earlier than others. I count myself
among those who must work to summon it, and for whom
it often does not come soon enough.
Ten minutes ago, my editor called me and asked if I
planned on giving him a column or not. It was actually due
at 6 p.m. yesterday, but I talked my way into a 24-hour
extension. It is now quarter to six. I am going to rip this
last sheet out of the machine, put the papers in a folder,
and jog through the soft drizzle to The Daily offices. If I
hurry, I can make the deadline with a few minutes to
spare.

at 6 p.m. yesterday, but I talked my way into a 24-hour
extension. It is now quarter to six. I am going to rip this
last sheet out of the machine, put the papers in a folder,
and jog through the soft drizzle to The Daily offices. If I
hurry, I can make the deadline with a few minutes to
spare.

At about 10 p.m. on a night in the spring quarter of my
junior year, my roommate and I began working on the
term papers we had been assigned for an English class.
The papers were to be 10-12 pages long, brief but incisive
treatments of some literary theme common to the novels
we had been assigned that quarter. Although both of us
had had ample time to consider what we would write and
how we would write it, neither had actually begun writing
until roughly 12 hours before the papers were due. At 3
a.m., Brian's typewriter broke. Sitting in the bleak light of
the ceiling bulb (my desk lamp, the only one in the room,
had given out some months earlier), we began taking
turns on my Smith-Corona, one of us typing for 20

minutes or so while the other wrote in longhand the page
he would type when his turn came. We drank coffee dark
as oil, hunched over the humming, clacking machine; and
when dawn came and broke the coffee's hold, there
resonated in my head a chorus of voices, singing to me in
full harmony words in a rich, alien tongue.
1 handed the paper in with a few minutes to spare,
walked back to my dorm and slept for six hours. Later on,
I began to wonder whether the whole night had not been
an exercise in irresponsibility and procrastination. Was I
alone in these frantic last-ditch efforts? Could my ills be
cured by something as simple as a little discipline? Cer
tainly, I thought, the students in the foreign aid class I had
taken the previous quarter must have been more diligent
than I in researching and writing their 25-page term
papers well in advance.
1 remembered handing that paper in. 1 had spent the
last three nights and all that day in front of a word proces
sor, and at five minutes before 5 that afternoon, 1 hopped
on my bike, clutching the bulky printout of my work, and
rode furiously toward the History Corner. Sandstone
blurred past as I flew by the Quad, but I pedaled even
harder as panic filled my chest: What if they closed the
building early? What if 1 was one minute too late?
Something peripheral caught my eye. I turned to see a
girl from my section riding neck and neck with me. I
thought her one of the best students in the class: ag
gressively articulate, poised, confident and terribly bright.
Here she was now, panting and bent over the handlebars
of her bike, giving me a tight smile as we whizzed past
German Studies, and as it registered on me that she, too,
must have only minutes ago finished her paper, two more
guys joined us on the right, flanking me now so we sailed
down the bike path in a flying wedge, and when we
reached the Poli Sci building I did not come to a complete
stop, but hit the ground running, letting the bike roll for
10 yards before it clattered to the pavement. 1 ran up the
steps and handed the paper in just as they were locking
the place; and as I descended the steps, I saw that people

were still trickling in, one every 30 seconds or so, to slip
their thick packets of hard copy under the glass doors. •
Incidents such as these have convinced me that I am not
alone in my 1 lth-hour labors: many bright, gifted people
keep me company. Upon meeting in an airport the father
of a friend of mine, an anthropology scholar and human
rights activist, I was struck by the man's rumpled clothing
and bloodshot eyes. I asked if the flight had been particu
larly rough, and he replied no, that he was simply feeling
the effects of a night spent staring at a PC screen. He had
been working on a jointly written book about politics in
Latin America and had turned in his part of the final draft
15 minutes before it was due. I asked how far in advance
he had been given the deadline. "Six months," he said.
Consider that for a moment: Hfere was a renowned
scholar, a published author in the field of political science,
a tenured professor of anthropology at MIT, and the map
had just pulled an all-nighter.
Not everyone works this way, of course. Some people
simply get things done early. I often wonder why they can
do it and 1 cannot. Is it merely a case of "either got it or
you ain't"? I cannot believe the ability to compose with
out deadline pressure is in any way linked with intelli
gence: I know too many people who far outstrip me in
that area, but nevertheless put off work of this nature until
the last minute. Neither can I accept that such ability
depends solely upon pure discipline, or even on the simple
desire to "get it done early." I always want to get it done
early. I have admitted to my inclination to put off work,
and therefore have, on occasion, forced myself into action
by sheer effort of will. It doesn't work. The product of my
self-imposed discipline was no match for the flow of ideas
brought about by the sickening fear of a deadline.
I should clarify two points. The* frest is that *1 do not
defend the "last-ditch effort" as an effective way of
working. I do not condone it. I do not, above all, advise it.
Those of you planning to castigate me for merely
rationalizing my own shortcomings may sheathe your
weapons. Second, it should be clear by now that I am
speaking primarily about writing; and if writing is not
quite synonymous with thinking, it comes pretty close.
Since I am concerned here with the inability to complete a
written assignment until the deadline is upon you, I am
therefore talking about the incapacity for thought until
sheer desperation simply makes one think, and about
those for whom any kind of creative outpouring or intel
lectual issuing-forth does not occur until fear takes hold.
Anxiety is the spark plug of the brain. I believe, at least
here at school, and most likely out in the working world,
that we are all motivated at some level by fear. Some
people simply feel it earlier than others. I count myself
among those who must work to summon it, and for whom
it often does not come soon enough.
