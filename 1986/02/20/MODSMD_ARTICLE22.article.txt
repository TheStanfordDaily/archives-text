## Take a trip to the past: See, think, imagine...

The front doors open to reveal a wide, imposing stair
way, carpeted in soft magenta with border stripes of
muted purple and gray. At the top of the stairs, glass dis
play cases sit beneath the high domed ceiling, surrounded
by white columns. A peaceful silence reigns over the
room. Visitors may think they have walked into some
eminent person's mansion, but in reality, they have en
tered the Department of Special Collections in Green Li
brary.
The size and scope of this department is even more im
posing than the setting. Its 90,000 printed volumes and
8.3 million pieces of manuscript material and ephemera
(posters, film and TV scripts) include collections in Amer
ican and English literature, the history of science,
children's literature and early printed books. These hold
ings have been acquired over time in a number of ways.

Gifts often establish "pillars" of strength upon which
the department can build, according to curator Michael
Ryan. The History of Science collection, for instance,
began in 1941 with Frederick Brasch's donation of a set of
documents relating to Isaac Newton. It has recently been
augmented by the Samuel I.and Cecile M. Barchas collec
tion which includes original works from renowned scien
tists, such as Copernicus, Galileo and Darwin.
In 1981, the Department received over 10,000 volumes
of children's literature dating from the 18th century to the
present. Well-known favorites by Beatrix Potter, L. Frank
Baum and Hans Christian Anderson are part of the Mary
L. Schofield collection.
Ryan illustrated the element of luck involved in acquir
ing such gifts with a story about Francis Douce, a 19th
century collector. A friend in the British Museum intro
duced him to the librarian at Oxford. Ryan said Douce
visited the library "just once, but they were polite to him
and in his will, he left them his entire collection."
"The moral of the story is you just never know where
gifts may come from," Ryan said. "So be nice to strangers,
especially."
Luck also plays a role in purchases, since the supply of
rare books and materials is obviously limited. "Their ap
pearance on the market is completely fortuitous. You
never know what's going to turn up or where it's going to
turn up," Ryan said.
One of Ryan's main responsibilities is to read catalogs
listing materials available for purchase, which he receives
every day from American and European dealers.
However, "acquisitions are as much a result of chance and
opportunity as of program and method," he said. Staying
in personal contact with dealers is crucial since "some of
the most valuable, unique and scarce collections never ap
pear at all in the catalogs," Ryan said.
The department of special collections makes purchases
after comparing prices and consulting faculty. Sometimes
the transaction is completed by contacting the dealer; at
other times, works are acquired at auctions. Ryan pointed
out, however, that the latter method is not used frequently
since the keys to successful bidding at an auction — quick
action and flexibility — are not attributes of large institu
tions, such as university libraries.
