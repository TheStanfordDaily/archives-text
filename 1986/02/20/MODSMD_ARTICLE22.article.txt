## Take a trip to the past: See, think, imagine...

The front doors open to reveal a wide, imposing stair
way, carpeted in soft magenta with border stripes of
muted purple and gray. At the top of the stairs, glass dis
play cases sit beneath the high domed ceiling, surrounded
by white columns. A peaceful silence reigns over the
room. Visitors may think they have walked into some
eminent person's mansion, but in reality, they have en
tered the Department of Special Collections in Green Li
brary.
The size and scope of this department is even more im
posing than the setting. Its 90,000 printed volumes and
8.3 million pieces of manuscript material and ephemera
(posters, film and TV scripts) include collections in Amer
ican and English literature, the history of science,
children's literature and early printed books. These hold
ings have been acquired over time in a number of ways.

Gifts often establish "pillars" of strength upon which
the department can build, according to curator Michael
Ryan. The History of Science collection, for instance,
began in 1941 with Frederick Brasch's donation of a set of
documents relating to Isaac Newton. It has recently been
augmented by the Samuel I.and Cecile M. Barchas collec
tion which includes original works from renowned scien
tists, such as Copernicus, Galileo and Darwin.
In 1981, the Department received over 10,000 volumes
of children's literature dating from the 18th century to the
present. Well-known favorites by Beatrix Potter, L. Frank
Baum and Hans Christian Anderson are part of the Mary
L. Schofield collection.
Ryan illustrated the element of luck involved in acquir
ing such gifts with a story about Francis Douce, a 19th
century collector. A friend in the British Museum intro
duced him to the librarian at Oxford. Ryan said Douce
visited the library "just once, but they were polite to him
and in his will, he left them his entire collection."
"The moral of the story is you just never know where
gifts may come from," Ryan said. "So be nice to strangers,
especially."
Luck also plays a role in purchases, since the supply of
rare books and materials is obviously limited. "Their ap
pearance on the market is completely fortuitous. You
never know what's going to turn up or where it's going to
turn up," Ryan said.
One of Ryan's main responsibilities is to read catalogs
listing materials available for purchase, which he receives
every day from American and European dealers.
However, "acquisitions are as much a result of chance and
opportunity as of program and method," he said. Staying
in personal contact with dealers is crucial since "some of
the most valuable, unique and scarce collections never ap
pear at all in the catalogs," Ryan said.
The department of special collections makes purchases
after comparing prices and consulting faculty. Sometimes
the transaction is completed by contacting the dealer; at
other times, works are acquired at auctions. Ryan pointed
out, however, that the latter method is not used frequently
since the keys to successful bidding at an auction — quick
action and flexibility — are not attributes of large institu
tions, such as university libraries.

Freshmen Anne Williams and Kris Jensen practiced for the latest movie release of "Singin' in the Rain" last
weekend by the fountain in front of Old Union. Scattered showers are expected for today.
The manuscripts division of the Special Collections, in
stead of seeking works which have already been judged
valuable by history, plays an active role in defining what
will be valuable in the future. Manuscripts librarian Carol
Rudisel noted that she has to "have a little crystal ball" in
order to anticipate future interests and solicit appropriate,
materials.
A prime example of this is the current "Stanford and
Silicon Valley Project." Stanford scientists and engineers
have played an integral role in Silicon Valley development
in both laser and microprocessor technology, as well as
high-energy physics and biotechnology. The department
has set out to "document the origins of this 20th-century
phenomenon and its seminal achievements and contribu
tions," Ryan said.
For scholars interested in the evolution of a geographic
area or the processes of technological discovery and prod
uct development, the Silicon Valley project should pro
vide rich primary source materials for research. Both pub
lished and unpublished material will be solicited from in
dividuals and companies in the Silicon Valley. Examples
include research notes, diaries, transcripts or recordings of
speeches and interviews, technical reports, company
brochures, photographs and oral histories.
A similar anticipation of historical needs occurred in
the early 19705, when the department began building its
collection of documents relating to the Mexican-
American experience. Today, it is the largest available
collection on this topic in the United States, because
"some librarians had the foresight to see that this was a
neglected area," Rudisel said.
Occupying 2,000 linear feet of space, the collection in
cludes the archives of the Mexican-American Legal
Defense and Education Fund, papers of labor leader and
political activist Bert Corona and papers of Manuel Ruiz,

Jr., former commissioner of the U.S. Civil Rights Com
mission.
Difficulties in soliciting private papers sometimes arise
because "you have to convince people of the historical
value of what to them is just random material they've col
lected over the years." Rudisel noted that labor activists
are especially hard to convince while authors are not, be
cause thev know the literary value of their papers.
However, sometimes items such as diaries, which have
clear historical value, are also very personal. Since the
materials may be highly sensitive to contemporaries, a
number of manuscripts have been acquired with the con
dition that they not be made available to the public until
the death of either the donor or people mentioned in the
material.

The Department of Special
Collections has the largest
available collection on the
Mexican-American experi
ence in the United States.

Inside the spacious Field reading room, tables and cush
ioned chairs provide ample work space for researchers
eager to examine the pieces of the past collected by the
department. Latticed windows arch high over the
bookcases which line the walls. Reflections of the
treetops, seen through the windows on the right, appear in
the locked glass doors of the bookcases on the left.
Emerging from the reading room, one comes again to
the top of the staircase. The view of the three-tiered stair
way is just as imposing from above as it is from below. The
descent ends the journey into other times and places.
