# 'What's your worst experience at Stanford?'
## The 						Question Man cometh 
### 
For all you diehard Campus Com
pendium readers, never fear, it will
be back next Thursday. We decided,
instead, to send out one of our roving
reporters and pose the above ques
tion to random Stanford students in
the hopes of getting some interesting,
humorous, even probing responses.
The following is what we wound up
with.
"My most horrible experience was
during my freshman year. I felt sick

and had those horrible coughing
spasms. I used to go out of control in
class — I just couldn't stop cough
ing. It was horrible! 1 had to leave
the class every 10 minutes— Oh! It
was awful!"
- Aimee Sebes, sophomore
"My first midterm in differential
equations. ... It was a rude awaken
ing during my first quarter (of my
freshman year) at Stanford."
- Ted Warnock, graduate student
"My most horrible experience was
on the second day of school my
freshman year. It was the worst ex
perience. I had the most horrible
bike accident. I flew over the handle
bar and landed on my face — I even
broke two of my teeth. I had to wear
braces after that. I hated it!"
- Debbie Mannix, sophomore
"My most horrible experience was
one of those dorm outings to San
Francisco. My friend and I lost
everybody. It was late at night and
we were really scared. We ended up
paying some euv to take us to the
wharf. I was terrified. But luckily we

found everyone at the wharf. I was
so glad."
- Maxine Alex, freshman
"My last calculus final. ... 1 didn't
think I had learned any of that stuff.
I could have sworn I had the wrong
test and was in the wrong room."
- Jenny Schmitz, freshman
