Bob Dylan — Biograph
Hart Hart Hart Hart Hart
This five-record compilation is the
definitive statement on the career to
date of one of the most influential
voices on the American music scene.
Along with Chuck Berry, Elvis
Presley, The Beatles, James Brown,
and a very select group of others, Bob
Dylan's impact on popular music and
culture is readily evident today.
Without his contributions, there
would have been no singer/songwriter
movement, nor the roots/Americana
sound which can trace its origin to his
backing band, The Band. Such
diverse artists as Bruce Springsteen,
R.E.M., Suzanne Vega, Mike Scott of
the Waterboys, and Jimi Hendrix all
admit to owing debts to the "grand
old man."
This is no ordinary greatest hits
package designed only for increased
corporate profit taking. This compi
lation, like Neil Young's "Decade,"
gives the listener the totality of the
artist's contribution to popular music.
The comprehensiveness of this
package is magnificent. It spans the
bulk of Dylan's career from early
1961 until 1981. By listening to the
anthology in sequence, one is able to
hear the development of the artist as
a craftsman and individual.
What really makes this effort stand
out is its scope (five records — a

rarity in rock) and its meticulous
compilation. The "classics" and the
"hits" are all there, but 26 of the 53
tracks are unreleased takes, both
studio and live, B-sides and other ma
terial that was previously hard to
come by.
The only problem arising from this
package is some inevitable quibbling
over the omissions. This is not just for
the dedicated fan, but any neophyte.
However, there is no better starting
point for anyone who wants to fully
comprehend what Bob Dylan has
contributed to modern music.

Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers —
Pack Up the Plantation Live!
Mondale Mondale
Both rockers and hipsters should
be able to respect Tom Petty, at least
nominally; he's been a guru of
A.O.R. radio for years, and even
KQAK played some of the better
songs on "Southern Accents" until
the station was bought out.
But on this thoroughly unnecessary
double-live embarrassment, Petty
churns through more old hits than
anyone realized he ever had in the
first place, helped out by uninspired
instrumental backing and one-and
only vocal wondergirl Stevie Nicks.
Songs drag on until they end merci

fully, only to be replaced by more of
the same. The only track worthy of
playing at all is a cover of the
Animals' "Don't Bring Me Down."
It's a shame that songs as good as
those on "Southern Accents" become
as bad as they are on "Plantation."
But Petty's failure isn't anything to
mope about. It's just a continuation
of the curse on live albums brought
about by the 1977 recording of Steve
Martin's "King Tut." (According to
legend and Columbia Records, the
curse can only be broken by the
release of a live Springsteen collec
tion.)
Those of us who naively bought
live albums in the past (eighth grade:
"Cheap Trick at Budokan") have

already learned by our mistakes.
Anyone lucky enough to have missed
out on similar adolescent audio
fiascos should consider themselves
duly warned.
Echo and the Bunnymen — Songs to
and Sing
CuomoCuomoCuomoCuonio
How things change. In early
December we ragged on record com
panies for being greedy and releasing
scores o' greatest hits/best of albums
before Christmas. And here we are in

February 1986, our worst music
drought month yet, as federal
agencies scramble to relieve mount
ing consumer panic by regulating
heavy-rotation "hit radio" stations
and rationing covers of obscure
Motown songs.
Bowing to pressure from hip-pop
wave teen interest groups, Warner
Brothers announces the release of
"Songs to Learn and Sing," a "best
of" collection from Echo, et al. Des
perate record buyers flock to Tower
Records franchises nationwide.
Warner is unable to meet demand
and is taken over by an unintention
ally successful Ted Turner/Jesse
Helms greenmail conspiracy.
The victors vow to make a
"respectable" label out of Warner,
dropping the entire Minneapolis
Royal Family (even Jesse Johnson!)
and promising to release only pro
social Debbie Boone retrospectives
and Braves simulcasts thereafter.
This tragedy didn't really happen.
But it could have. In today's pop
inflationary America, too many
records are put out with too little
regard for what waves are actually
pressed into their grooves. The Bun
nymen, whose success is largely a
result of talent and songwriting rather
than hairstyle or hype, have shown up
the rest of the music industry with a
truly qualified "best of " album.
This combination of old hits, recent
hits and unreleased hits just might be
enough to keep you REAL music
fans satisfied until the industry can
get its act together. And if they don't,
get prepared for Braves simulcasts
and "USA for Africa Bloopers."

and Telford Work
