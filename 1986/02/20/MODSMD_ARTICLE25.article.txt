# Goldie plays ball

### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
Dizzy, cute, tough, spunky —
yes, it's Goldie Hawn, in all of her
latest incarnations. Hawn cul
tivates a very deliberate screen
image that hasn't strayed much
from the course set by her hugely
successful "Private Benjamin."
Her personality in "Wildcats" is
a play-by-play rehash of that
image, and by now Hawn is a
master at it. If she spins no new
variations on this persona, well,
you can bet no one in Hollywood
is encouraging her to change the
proven formula (everyone in mar
keting has heeded the lesson of
new Coke).
Hawn knows what she does
best, and if one looks beyond the
frizzy hairstyle (which has always
seemed a gauge of the sensibility
residing beneath it), one finds a
very shrewd woman indeed.
As in "Private Benjamin" and
"Protocol," "Wildcats" pits her
against the male establishment (in
this case, high school football),
and once again has her triumphing
through a shrewd combination of
one-upsmanship, winning person
ality, blackmail and plain old
fashioned (male) guts.
Hawn plays a high school girl's
track coach named Molly, who ful
fills her life's ambition to coach
football by getting a position at
Central High, which, because of
the school's bad reputation, no
one else wants. She then has to
prove herself to the various male
chauvinists aching to see her fail,
while incidentally struggling to
keep her family together.
Hawn, an extremely talented
comedienne, goes through the mo
tions with an effortless skill, but by
now she knows and we know that
we've seen it all before.
Ezra Sacks' script doesn't offer
much to work with, and not even
director Michael Ritchie, who has

been inspired before ("Smile,"
"The Survivors"), can whip up a
more than professional enthusiam
for the material. He does a
workmanlike job until the end,
when he botches the football game
climax through sloppy staging, and
doesn't give us much of a last
minute "big play" (which is trite,
but absolutely essential for this
kind of story).
"Wildcats" has more than its
share of inspirational messages,
ranging from football platitudes
("If we trust each other, we can
work together") to
mother/daughter relationship
cliches ("1 don't want to be one of
those mothers who doesn't under
stand"). These are also a
trademark of more recent Goldie
Hawn movies — she knows that
Americans like values with their
comedy — but they definitely get
in the way of the fun and reduce
the movie to the level of TV sit
com.
The performers tend to keep it
at that level. Nipsy Russell has
some fine, amusing moments as
the wily Central High principal,
and Tab Thacker is genuinely
funny as Finch, a monstrous bulk
of a student. Finch is a mercenary,
entrepenurial genius, and Thacker
suggests a cold-hearted, even
more massive John Candy.
Hawn scores her biggest points
reacting to the typical macho pos
turing that goes on in male locker
ooms.
As in "Private Benjamin," the
feminist politics are more than a
little fuzzy and self-contradictory.
Molly proves herself in a man's
world by beating men at their own
(physical) game and shoving her
self to be as ruthless as any man,
yet Hawn also goes for laughs with
her dizzy female, diminutive un
derdog stance.
In this respect, "Wildcats" is a
little dispiriting.
