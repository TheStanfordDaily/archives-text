# San Jose Rep delivers less than More
## Presentation of 'Man For All Seasons' unnecessarily softens moral dilemmas 
### PETER MORGAN Staff writer 
Majority vs. minority, realism vs.
idealism, reason vs. emotion. All
these great themes of drama play a
large part in Robert Bolt's "A Man
for All Seasons," which opened last
week at the San Jose Repertory Theater.
The play concerns the life and
death of Sir Thomas More, the great
Renaissance writer, statesman and
Chancellor of England who defied
King Henry VIII and was beheaded
for it.
Bolt's script is a solidly woven
tapestry of philosophy and action, a
play of ideas as well as pathos. Henry
desires an heir to the throne and his
present wife is barren, so he wants a
divorce. The Pope, however, made a
special exception to church law for
Henry to marry in the first place, so
the situation is a bit messy politically
and religiously.
Caught in the middle is More, who
wants a practical solution to Eng
land's dilemma but cannot reconcile
his conscience with the sin of divorce.
What follows is an insightful and dra
matic story about one man holding to
his personal morality against the
pressures of wife, family, friends,
lawyers and even the king himself.
It does not ruin the drama if you
know More is beheaded in the final
scene. Many people are familiar with
More's story, and those who are not
are informed of his demise midway
through the play. Bolt is not writing a
play about suspenseful courtroom
battles (even though there is one in
the second act). He is writing a play
about morality.
For More, morality is not a "game"
or an "artificial set of values" arbi
trarily assumed. It is his very being.
At one point a character says it
amazes him that More can oppose the
very "moment of the times." More
responds: "It amazes me too."
With Brechtian techniques of dis
tance and deflation, Bolt shifts the

play's focus from the immediate
suspense of More's political situation
to the more encompassing conflict
between morality and pragmatism.
We are told of More's death
beforehand, so we are not as con
cerned with what his final destiny is
so much as how it comes about.
To engulf the "modern" audience
in the conflict, the character of the
Common Man frames the narrative of
the story by taking on the numerous

roles of servant, boatman, juror and
others. The Common Man not only
gives the audience someone to iden
tify with (the "working man" in the
midst of cardinals and kings), but he
embodies the truly trapped man.
More knows his thoughts, feelings
and actions implicitly, and his individ
ual struggle is merely a physical one
to somehow follow the letter of the
law and remain alive without sacrific
ing his morals.

The Common Man does not know
himself so well, and he wavers in his
beliefs and actions. He pretends to be
the great pragmatist, the man who
believes in nothing but money and
ignores the philosophical battles of
the "great men." During the play,
though, we see the Common Man
"almost fall for" More's sincerity.
When asked to be the Head Juror, he
whines from distaste for his job.
The San Jose Rep's production

adequately captures much of the
Common Man's depth and the
maneuverings of the nobles. It misses
the power and point of the play,
though, in reducing the moral di
lemma to palatable courtroom
suspense.
The staging is filled with the sud
den turns, despairing glances and
deliberate expressions one would ex
pect in a bad TV movie. The actors go
through the highly charged text with a

rapidity and lightness that makes the
play a pleasantly swallowed moral
fable to tuek away for cocktail con
versation.
One example of this involves an ex
tremely moving passage about moral
hesitation as a "gesture" versus the
sheer "inability to go on" in the face
of sin. James Edmonson, who at
various points is riveting as More,
glides through this passage as if it
were common sense and not to be
dwelt upon.
As with "Passion Play," an earlier
Rep presentation, excellent design
dominates a show of uneven acting.
While the sets and lights are intrigu
ing and stimulating (particularly
Stanford professor John Wilson's
hanging pastiche of Renaissance
images), the acting limps along.
The production did elicit a good
deal of response from the matinee
crowd, particularly the opening scene
in which the actors enter in street
clothes to gather for the performance.
The Brechtian elements are nice, but
they are not the heart of the play.
Aside from the element of the
Common Man, this is a realistic play,
one in which More's unswerving
morality frustrates not only the other
characters but the audience as well.
Like the Common Man, we should be
divided and frustrated about More's
actions.
Instead, the Rep's show waters
everything down so much that we
completely sympathize with More
from the very start of the play. When
the final curtain falls, we go home
happy with a quaint moral lesson
about being "true to oneself' even in
the face of martyrdom. The produc
tion does not unnerve, it just ap
peases: quite the reverse of the
Brechtian intention.
"A Man for All Seasons" is a bril
liant play in a rather dull production
at the Rep. It succeeds as entertain
ment, but little else. Plays of such
depth should not have such shallow
treatment.
