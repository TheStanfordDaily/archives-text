## No regrets for prep Kohlmoos 
### GEOFF SANBORN Editorial staff 
The hectic pressure of the col
lege football recruiting wars ended
eight days ago for 17-year-old
Mike Kohlmoos of Visalia, when
he broke a verbal commitment to
California to sign a letter of intent
to attend Stanford. But in his voice
there is still no relief or relaxation;
he speaks guardedly, in the
reserved, clipped tones of some
one who has been misunderstood
and is determined that he won't
get fooled again.
His name was splashed all over
the Bay Area sports pages last
week when the San Jose Mercury
News released a story saying that
Kohlmoos had gone back on an
oral commitment to California
after Stanford assistant coach
Dave Baldwin misrepresented: 1)
the number of years left on Cal
coach Joe Kapp's contract; 2) the
graduation rate of Cal athletes;
and 3) Cal's business school re
quirements.
San Francisco Chronicle colum
nist Glenn Dickey, for one,
blasted the Stanford football pro
gram for unethical recruiting
practices, for "stooping to the
level of the USC's."
Kohlmoos doesn't see it that
way at all. " 1 had a change of mind
and a change of heart," he said
yesterday."It was nothing Cal did
or said, nothing Stanford did or
said."
When asked if Baldwin's inac
curate statements had anything to
do with his decision, he inter
rupted the question with, "No. It
had nothing to do with that. He
(Baldwin) corrected himself the
next day."
After the meetings with
Baldwin two weeks ago,
Kohlmoos escaped to the moun
tains for a one-day ski trip. When
he returned, he had decided to at
tend Stanford.
Stanford Coach Jack Elway
defended the Cardinal's recruiting
practices last week, saying, "We
'don't bank oh any commitment
until the national letter has been
signed. The recruiting process is
still going on. They (recruits) cer

tainly have the right to change
their mind.
"1 don't want to be involved in
any controversy with Cal," he con
tinued. "We recruit straight; we're
factual. At no time do we slander
anybody."
Kohlmoos, a 6-foot-5, 250-
pound offensive tackle who was
rated as the No. 2 college football
prospect in the country by one na
tional scouting service, said he
believed Baldwin made an
"honest mistake," and that he is
"very happy with (his) decision"
to attend Stanford.
"Not too many people have an
opportunity to go to Stanford,
much less play football there," he
said.
And he is shedding no tears
about Cal's disappointment.
"Sure, they expected me to sign,"
he said. "But it's four years of my
life, not theirs."
A number of factors shifted the
balance in favor of Stanford and
away from Cal and Kohlmoos'
third choice, USC. One was Stan
ford's relatively rural atmosphere,
closer to the flavor of Visalia — a
town of 70,000 in the Central Val
ley — than Los Angeles or
Berkeley. "I happen to like small
communities more," he said.
Others were Stanford's aca
demic reputation and its up-and
coming football program.
Kohlmoos talked with professors
during his visit here Jan. 3-5, and,
of course, he had a good deal of
contact with the Cardinal coaching
staff.
"Basically, 1 like the way it (the
coaching staff) is run."he said. "1
think we'll have a good team
here."
Kohlmoos didn't start playing
football until his freshman year in
high school, when, thanks to his 6-
1, 200-pound frame, he started on
the JV team. He was the first in his
immediate family to play football
— he is an only child, and his
father, an automotive parts sales
man, never played.
But after beginning a weight
lifting program. Kohlmoos bulked
up still further and started on the
Redwood High School offensive line
for the next three years. Redwood
made it to the playoffs in his senior
year but lost in the first round.
Kohlmoos does not expect to have
an immediate impact on the Stanford
offense, despite the raves of the
scouts.
"Unless I'm strong enough and ca
pable enough to play, 1 think I'll red
shirt," he said. "The transition from
high school to college is really great. I
don't have enough ability to step right
into the college game."
He said he would like to visit Stan
ford again this spring, after he finds
some new work — he was recently
laid off from his job delivering optical
supplies. At last, it seems, his life is
resuming some kind of order, after all
those months of phone calls and visits
and media coverage.
Do you sometimes think, "Life
shouldn't be this difficult at 17?" he
was asked.
"Yeah," he said. Guardedly. And
he waited for the next question.
