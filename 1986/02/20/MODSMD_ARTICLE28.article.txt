# Stanford faces young Trojans
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
With its postseason tournament hopes hanging
precariously entering the last third of the Pacific 10 Con
ference schedule, the Stanford men's basketball team hits
the road to face USC at the Los Angeles Sports Arena at
8 p.m.
The Cardinal is coming off its worst loss in the confer
ence this year, an 81-53 shellacking at California. In that
game the Cardinal was outrebounded by a 53-32 margin
and outrun by the Cal fast break.
"1 think the rebounding is going to be important, espe
cially coming off a 21-rebound deficit at Cal," Stanford
Coach Tom Davis said. "Their transition is the thing that
wiped us out â€” they just beat us down the court. We were
taking those long shots, which gave them long rebounds,
and they just went with them. I think USC is capable of
the same thing."
Stanford's last previous loss had been at home in
overtime to Arizona State, and the Cardinal responded
with a 62-56 upset of Arizona that knocked the Wildcats
out of first place.
Davis would like to see a repeat. "You hope that's how
your ballclub will react, but sometimes they just get dis
couraged," he said. "I'm hoping that's how we'll respond
and that that game is behind us."
Stanford goes into tonight's game tied for fourth place
in the Pac-10 with UCLA and Oregon State at 6-6, 3Vi
games behind league-leader Washington. The Cardinal is
12-12 overall.
In a down year for the conference overall, only the top
three teams seem assured of going to postseason tourna
ments. Davis isn't counting Stanford out yet. "Until we're
mathematically eliminated, we just want to hang in
there," he said. "We've been erratic, but we've been
playing better.
"1 don't know how we'll do on the road. We've got a
tough schedule with four games on the road and only two
at home."
Of those four road games, tonight's holds the best
prospects for a Cardinal victory. The Trojans tied for the
Pac-10 title last year but lost conference Player of the
Year Wayne Carlander from that team and have fallen
into ninth place this year. The Trojans are 3-9 m the Pac
-10, 9-13 overall.
Freshman forward Tom Lewis has come on to pick up
where Carlander left off. The 6-foot-7 Lewis is averaging
18 points per game to lead the Trojans. Tonight will be
the first time that Lewis and Stanford guard Todd Lichti
face each other, and both are being touted as Pac-10
Rookie of the Year. Lichti is Stanford's top scorer at 16.4
points per game.
Davis is particularly concerned about Lewis' mate in
the frontcourt, forward Derrick Dowell. The 6-6 junior is
averaging 16.1 points and 8.3 rebounds an outing.
"Derrick Dowell is a key," Davis said. "He's an out
standing inside player. He put on a clinic against Arkansas
a couple of weeks ago. He's capable of scoring 35 points
and getting 20 rebounds if we let him roam around."
The Cardinal will stay in Los Angeles for five days,
facing. UCLA at Pauley Pavilion on Monday night.
Tonight's game will be broadcast by KCBS (740 AM).
K/SU (90.1 FM) is broadcasting a doubleheader, preced
ing the broadcast of the men's game with coverage of the
Stanford women's basketball team's game against USC
