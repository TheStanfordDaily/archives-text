# Freshman began skiing at the age of five
## St. Laurent skis to Nationals 
### JULIANA HORSEMAN 
When freshman Shelly St. Laurent
signed up for the Stanford ski team
last September, little did she know
that by January she would assume the
No. 1 position on the women's team.
"1 was really thrilled," an elated St.
Laurent said after placing first in the
Stanford time trials at Lake Tahoe on
Jan. 2. This accomplishment reflected
years of competitive participation in
the sport.
Family ski trips in New Hampshire
meant an early start for St. Laurent's
skiing career. She put on her first ski
at age five and was receiving regular
instruction when she was eight.
Lessons prepared St. Laurent for
competition, and in 1980 she was one
of 12 girls to qualify for the state
team. Hv the age of 15. St. Laurent
had represented New Hampshire in
three Junior Olympic Ski Champion
ships. placing sixth in her age group in
1982.
Although St. Laurent's parents
sparked her interest in the sport, she
attributed most of her present talent
to her decision, at age 14. to attend a
ski academy in Watcrville, N.I I.
St. Laurent spent halt ot her next
three school years with 20 other ski
students — a difficult adjustment ini
tially.
"i found it somewhat unsettling
spending half a year at my public high
school and the remaining half at this
ski school," St. Laurent said.
The experience was a beneficial
one for her, however. "I'm glad I
made the decision, for my closest
friends were made in both settings,'
she said.
The daily routine at Watcrville in
cluded dry-land training before
breakfast, tutored classes in the cabin
until noon and skiing until sundown.
St. 1 aurcnt was fortunate enough
to receive intensive coaching from
George Capaul, a former member of
ihe Swiss National Ski Team and the
current coach of the U.S. men's team.
"There were rumors during my
second year at the school that he d
been asked to coach the U.S. team,"
St. I aurcnt said.
Capaul, however, chose to remain
at Watcrville until St. Uiurent's class
graduated. "He was a fantastic
teacher and friend," she said.
During the summer of her junior

year, St. Laurent had her most
memorable and most dangerous ski
experience. While in France, she par
ticipated in "crevasse skiing," which
involves carefully following a leader
down steep slopes marked with
hundred-foot deep craters.
"It was such a feeling of freedom,
especially when you knew that you
were skiing where no one's ever skied
before," St. Laurent said. "It was
scary but wonderful."
However, when St. Laurent broke
her leg playing soccer during her
junior year, any skiing in her senior
year was out of the question. "I went
to visit everyone at the ski academy
once, but it just wasn't the same." she

said. "I didn't feel a part of it
anymore."
St. Laurent has fully recovered,
however. She has already won six
races this year, and with the Nationals
a week away, leg injuries are far from
the freshman's mind.
St. Laurent will be one of seven
representatives from the Stanford
women's team, which recently won
the Northern California Division
League. The Cardinal will depart for
Killington, Vt., Saturday in order to
prepare for the two-day champion
ship which will be held on Feb. 2(i
and 28.
The nation's top !(■> teams w ill meet
in Vermont to battle the slopes, the
clock and each other. St. Laurent in

dicated that Stanford stands a good
chance of placing near the top. "The
team was able to beat Berkeley in the
league this year, and Berkeley placed
fourth at the Nationals last year, so
you never know." she said.
Although St. Laurent is familiar
with the Vermont terrain and has
raced on these trails before, she is still
somewhat nervous. "Having never
participated in this event before, I
don't really know what the competi
tion will be like," she admitted.
However, once St. Laurent is out of
the starting gate, there will be notime
for nervousness. "I'm just going to
concentrate on being totally full of
energy, so 1 can ski as fast and as hard
as I can," she said.
