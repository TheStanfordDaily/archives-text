# Lab safety ruling sought

### MARCUS MABRY 
California State Sen. Nicholas Petris (D-Oakland) is
sponsoring a bill to provide increased protection for stu
dents working with hazardous substances in university
laboratories.
The bill would extend to students the same rights other
employees who work in non-commercial labs already
have by including them under the state's Hazardous Sub
stances Information and Training Act, according to Sur
lene Grant, legislative aide to Petris.
Grant said the bill has been introduced in the Senate
and will be brought before a public committee sometime
after March 12.
The issue was brought to the attention of the senator's
office by a University of California student lobby group
complaining of shortcomings in university lab safety.
Grant emphasized that the bill does not create an en
tirely new concept, but merely includes students under an
existing law. "California OSHA (Occupational Safety and
Hazard Administration) requires that non-commercial

labs dealing with hazardous substances alert employees of
the dangers involved.
"If you are (working) under a teacher, you are exempt
from this protection (provided by OSHA). We are trying
to get rid of that exemption. We want it to include all
post-secondary schools," Grant said. These schools would
include all public and private colleges and universities in
the state.
Grant said students working at the graduate level may
be too intimidated to report safety hazards to their profes
sors, which is presently their only recourse. "We're
recommending the position of an Environmental and
Safety Ombudsman, someone to whom students can voice
their concerns without fear (of jeopardizing their future
academic or professional standing)," she said.
"Students will gain information concerning every sub
stance they're exposed to and its properties," Grant said.
The bill "will make a difference because the students
(will) have recourse now. I think it will bring about a very
healthy situation in university labs,"
Grant concluded.
Kirk Roberts, director of laborato
ries in the Stanford chemistry depart
ment, said he was not familiar
with the Petris bill, but lab safety
"is an issue to which a lot of attention

is being paid."
Stanford as a whole, and the
Chemistry Department in particular,
is continually making strides in the
area of student safety in its labs,
Roberts said.
Grant said Petris had no informa
tion on Stanford in particular at this
time, but the senator plans to investi
gate schools other than those in the
University of California system.
