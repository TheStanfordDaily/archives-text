# Netters look to weekend meet

It's been raining in California.
It's been snowing in Massachu
setts. But when the No. 1-ranked
Stanford men's tennis team plays
Harvard today, the players will be
warm and dry â€” and indoors.
The Cardinal faces the Crimson
this afternoon at 4 in the first
round of the USTA/ITCA Na
tional Intercollegiate Tennis
Championship at the Louisville
Racquet Club.
The Kentucky tournament
features lb of the top teams in the
nation, including the 12 top
ranked teams. Stanford is the No.
1 seed in the tournament, which
runs through Sunday.
As far as team play goes, this
tournament is second only to the
NCAA championships.

"These are the teams we're
going to have to beat in the
NCAAs," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said.
This is also the first time the ac
curacy of the preseason rankings
will be tested. Stanford's half of
the draw includes fourth-ranked
USC and fifth-ranked Pepperdine.
The other half features No. 2
SMU and No. 3 UCLA.
The Cardinal can't concern it
self with those teams, however,
until the unseeded Harvard squad
is sent back to Cambridge. Due to
the fact that all of Stanford's
matches over the past week have
been rained out, that task may be
tougher than the seedings indicate.
"Unfortunately, the cancella
tions don't put us in good shape
for the tournament," Gould said.
