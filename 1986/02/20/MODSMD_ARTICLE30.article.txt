# Netters look to weekend meet

### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
It's been raining in California.
It's been snowing in Massachu
setts. But when the No. 1-ranked
Stanford men's tennis team plays
Harvard today, the players will be
warm and dry â€” and indoors.
The Cardinal faces the Crimson
this afternoon at 4 in the first
round of the USTA/ITCA Na
tional Intercollegiate Tennis
Championship at the Louisville
Racquet Club.
The Kentucky tournament
features lb of the top teams in the
nation, including the 12 top
ranked teams. Stanford is the No.
1 seed in the tournament, which
runs through Sunday.
As far as team play goes, this
tournament is second only to the
NCAA championships.

"These are the teams we're
going to have to beat in the
NCAAs," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said.
This is also the first time the ac
curacy of the preseason rankings
will be tested. Stanford's half of
the draw includes fourth-ranked
USC and fifth-ranked Pepperdine.
The other half features No. 2
SMU and No. 3 UCLA.
The Cardinal can't concern it
self with those teams, however,
until the unseeded Harvard squad
is sent back to Cambridge. Due to
the fact that all of Stanford's
matches over the past week have
been rained out, that task may be
tougher than the seedings indicate.
"Unfortunately, the cancella
tions don't put us in good shape
for the tournament," Gould said.
"I hope we haven't gotten too much
out of practice."
Stanford may also be without the
full services of senior Jim Grabb, the
third-ranked singles player in the na
tion. Grabb, who is still suffering
from a nagging injury, will play this

weekend, but how much and to what
extent is still uncertain.
If Grabb doesn't play singles,
junior Mark Jacobson will probably
join seniors Eric Rosenfeld, Dan
Goldie and John Letts, junior Scott
Moody and sophomore Patrick
McEnroe in the singles lineup for the
Cardinal.
The Crimson team features a
couple of players who slipped

through Gould's hands. Larry Scott,
the 23rd-ranked singles player in the
nation, and Bill Stanley were both
heavily recruited by the Cardinal, but
chose Harvard in the end.
Another factor in today's match
will be the indoor courts. Due to ob
viously different climates, Harvard
practices indoors most of the time,
while Stanford rarely steps into the
confines of indoor courts.
