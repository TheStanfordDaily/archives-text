# Cardinal rained outâ€”once more
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior Staff writer 
Yes, it happened again. Rain yes
terday caused the cancellation of a
Stanford baseball game for the fourth
time since the season began less than
a month ago.
St. Mary's and Stanford, scheduled
to play at 2 p.m. yesterday at Sunken
Diamond, didn't even have a chance.
Rain throughout the night and early
morning sprinkles left the field un
suitable for play.
Confident as always, Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess has chosen
tomorrow afternoon to replay the
game. If all goes well, it will
start at 2 p.m. We'll just wait and see.
While he hasn't formally an
nounced a starting pitcher for the St.
Mary's game, southpaw Al Osuna, 3-
0 with a 3.98 ERA. will likely get the
rnxi.
The baseball officc did some other
schedule shuffling yesterday, too.

Stanford was to play at Santa Clara
Saturday at 1 p.m. and then host the
Broncos the following day at Sunken
Diamond. Because Stanford's facility
drains better than Santa Clara's. Sat
urday's game has been moved to the
Farm. It will start at 2 p.m.
Card notes
Junior Rick Dietz. projected as
Stanford's stopper out of the bullpen
this year, has returned to his home in
National City in the San Diego area.
Dictz has been suspended from
school for academic reasons. It is not
clear if Diet/ intends to return to
school in the spring and if he will play
baseball. Marquess downplayed
the loss of the righthander. "We're
not counting on his returning."
Marquess said. Even if he comes back,
it is doubtful that Dictz. who would
not have pitched in three months,
could be ready for action, according
to Marquess.
Dietz had a team-leading eight
saves a year ago to go with a 2.47
ERA. To compensate for the loss of
Dietz, Marquess has moved Rob
Wassenaar, originally the second

starter, to the bullpen.
Here's one for the Now That's
Domination department:
Just when Pacific 10 Conference
basketball has started to bore the
pants off sports fans looking to watch
fine play, here comes Pac-10
baseball. The Pac-10 Southern Divi
sion, comprised of six teams, boasts
three teams in the top 10 of the latest
Baseball America poll.

California, which many have
picked to upend two-time defending
Southern Division champ Stanford, is
No. 6. The Bears took two of three
from UC-Santa Barbara last weekend
in Berkeley. The Gauchos beat the
Cardinal twice in three tries here the
weekend before.
Stanford is ranked ninth; Arizona,
8-5 on the year, is No. 10.
