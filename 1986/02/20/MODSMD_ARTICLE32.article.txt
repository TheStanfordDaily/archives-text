# USC on tap for women
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
Following the Cardinal's tough
73-69 loss to California Monday
night, Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer sounded more like Knute
Rockne than the coach of a
women's basketball team.
"We're like a football team,"
she said during a postgame inter
view. "We have an offensive
lineup and a defensive lineup. We
can't platoon. As a result, we
sometimes couldn't match up with
the right people."
If Stanford had difficulty match
ing up against California, then
VanDerveer may need a defensive
line like the Chicago Bears' when
the Cardinal tries to upset the
USC Trojans (22-3) tonight in Los
Angeles.
The game will be broadcast by
KZSU (90.1 FM) live from the
L.A. Sports Arena at 5:45 p.m.
Led by Ail-American Cheryl
Miller, the seventh-ranked
Trojans sit unchallenged atop the
Fac-West Conference standings
with 6-0 record.
Stanford, on the other hand, is
winless in four conference games
and has taken up residence in the
Pac-West cellar. The Cardinal
(11-12) has lost a total of seven
games in a row.
In all likelihood, both of these
streaks will continue tonight. But
at this point in the season, Van-
Derveer is not concerned with
Stanford's recent decline.
"Last year (as coach of 28-3
Ohio State) people were asking
what it was like to win so many

games in a row," she said. "This
year they're asking what's it like to
lose so many in a row. But the
answers are the same. We just
have to take it one game at a time.
We'll try to work on things and
gain good experience. Sometimes
you get a quick payoff. Sometimes
the payoffs will have to come
later."

Players like sophomore forward
Kami Anderson and freshman
center Jill Yanke will benefit a
great deal from tonight's contest
and Saturday's confrontation with
UCLA at Pauley Pavilion.
"Whenever Jill can go up
against someone like Miller,"
VanDerveer said, "it's always a
valuable experience.
