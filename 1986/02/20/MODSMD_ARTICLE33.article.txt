# USFL approves 'dream team'

NEW YORK (AP) — The United States Football
League reaffirmed its commitment to resume play next
fall by approving the Houston-New Jersey merger that
brings together the league's three highest-profile stars and
injecting new money into the reluctant champions, the
Baltimore Stars.
The action solidified the USFL teams in the league's
two biggest markets and left only two of the eight league
franchises outside the Sun Belt — six of the teams are in
the Southeast. In a third move, the Jacksonville Bulls offi
cially absorbed the defunct Denver Gold.
The merger between the Houston Gamblers and New
Jersey Generals had been pending for more than six
months. It will bring Houston's Jim Kelly, the league's top
quarterback, to New Jersey to join running back Herschel
Walker and quarterback Doug Flutie.
Jerry Argovitz, the former Houston owner who will be
president of the franchise, said Kelly and Flutie, who both
make more than $1 million a year, will compete for the
quarterback job.
"I'll guarantee one thing — we'll have the highest-paid
second-string quarterback in football," he said.

Argovitz also boasted that the team he called the
"Gamblin' Generals" could score 40 points against the
NFL champion Chicago Bears.
The Gamblers-Generals merger then cleared the way
for the Baltimore deal, freeing up Steven Ross, who
bought the Gamblers from Argovitz and his partners and
met its payroll, to buy into the Stars and inject new money
in that club. Ross, who will provide "more than 50 per
cent" of the cash will be a co-owner with Myles Tanen
baum, the last original USFL owner left with an active
franchise.
It was Tanenbaum who set off the major pre-meeting
controversy when he was quoted last week as suggesting
that the league sit out the 1986 season — its first in head
to-head fall competition with the NFL — pending the
outcome of its $1.32 billion antitrust suit against the older
league. That led Commissioner Harry Usher to suggest
Tuesday that the USFL could play with seven teams next
season.
But Tanenbaum, whose team won two of the three
USFL spring championships while based for two years in
