Hussein withdraws from peace talks
AMMAN, Jordan — King Hussein of Jordan, accusing the Palestine
Liberation Organization of reneging on secret promises, announced yes
terday that he is halting political coordination with the PLO and sus
pending a yearlong joint effort to seek peace with Israel.
However, Hussein stopped short of severing relations with the PLO
and said he is willing to resume cooperation with its leadership at
"such time as their word becomes their bond."
He also said that, despite his falling out with the PLO, Jordan will not
seek a separate peace settlement with Israel but will continue to abide by
the principles of the year-old Amman Accord, the agreement under
which he and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat embarked on the joint
peace initiative last February.
But the Jordanian monarch indicated that this initiative was, for the
time being at least, at an end because of Arafat's reluctance to accept
publicly the key U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which
implicitly recognize Israel's right to exist.
In the course of a detailed recounting of the peace efforts over the past
year, Hussein also disclosed that he had received a written commitment
from the United States last month agreeing to PLO participation in an
international peace conference, provided the guerrilla organization first
renounces terrorism and goes "clearly on the public record" as accepting
Resolutions 242 and 338.
Those requirmnents long have been the conditions which the United
States requires in order to deal with the PLO, but Israel has said that
there are no conditions under which it would ever deal with the PLO. A
U.S. agreement to have the PLO at any peace talks would be an indica
tion that it could persuade the Israelis to sit down with PLO representa
tives.
Israel presses search for soldiers
JERUSALEM — Fierce gunbattles broke out yesterday between Is
raeli troops and Moslem militiamen in southern Lebanon in the worst
fighting there since Israeli forces withdrew last June, security sources
said. But Israel continued its massive sweep in response to the capture of
two soldiers despite threats that they would be killed.
Shiite Moslem militiamen holding the Israeli soldiers, who were seized
in an ambush in southern Lebanon on Monday, threatened to kill one of
them at 9 p.m. yesterday unless all Israeli troops were withdrawn from
Lebanon by then. There was no indication late yesterday whether the
threat had been carried out.
Timur Goksel, spokesmen for the U.N. peace-keeping force in south
ern Lebanon, warned yesterday night that the situation there had
reached a dangerous point that he said could escalate into full-scale bat
tle between pro-Israeli forces and Moslem militiamen.
Israeli military officials said four guerrillas were killed yesterday by a
joint patrol of Israeli troops and the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army,
after the guerrillas attacked the patrol near Haris. U.N. officials said
they were told by Haris residents that the Israeli patrol had "responded
with tank fire" when it was ambushed.
Shiite Amal militia officials said in Beirut that four of their fighters
were killed and eight seriously injured in the clash at Haris, Washington
Post special correspondent Nora Boustany reported.
Haris is about four miles northwest of Kounine, site of the Moslem
guerrilla ambush Monday in which the two Israelis were abducted and
two SLA forces were killed while patrolling in the Israeli-declared
"security zone."
Gulf battle shifts to Kuwaiti border
TEHRAN, Iran — The focus of a 10-day-old ground battle for con
trol of the northern Persian Gulf shifted sharply yesterday to the vicinity
of the Kuwaiti border amid reports that Kuwait had placed its forces on
"maximum alert."
Both Iran and Iraq reported successive attacks and counterattacks ex
tending from the Iranian-occupied gulf port of Faw to Um-Oasr, site of a
major Iraqi naval base near the Kuwaiti border.
The two sides reported hundreds of air and artillery strikes elsewhere
in the southern extremities of oil-rich southern Iraq and reported the
downing of eight aircraft, six of them by Iran.
No territorial gain or loss was reported by either side on the central
axis leading to Basrea, Iraq's second-largest city, or the northern line
parallel to the disputed Shatt al-Arab estuary.
Sheikh Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah, the emir of Kuwait, continued a se
ries of visits to advance military positions, inspected national guard units
as the Kuwaiti ambassador to Paris, Issa Al-Hammad, informed
reporters that a state of "maximum alert" had been declared in the
country's armed forces.
The ambassador vowed that Kuwait would "reply to any attack" and
said that Iran had been informed about the military alert.
Iran has warned Kuwait about allowing Iraq to land troops in the stra
tegic Kuwaiti island of Bubiyan near Faw. The warning has triggered
daily denunciations in Kuwaiti newspapers, which have, however,
avoided any direct mention of the Bubiyan issue.
Summit hailed as cultural revival
PARIS — The first summit conference of French-speaking countries
ended yesterday without the creation of a French commonwealth of na
tions, but President Francois Mitterrand of France nevertheless hailed
the meeting as proof of a revival of French culture and language.
Using a word coined in the 19th century to describe an international
community based on French culture and language, Mitterrand said,
"Francophonie has come out of its long sleep. The Renaissance is here."
Several leaders, most notably Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of
Canada, had proposed a formal organization of French-speaking
countries somewhat — though not exactly — patterned after the Com
monwealth. an organization of British-affiliated states with a secretariat
and a secretary general. But the leaders and representatives of the 41
countries and communities at the meeting would not go that far.
But the summit did decide to set up a small committee to monitor the
implementation of the various technical agreements reached at the con
ference and to prepare for a second summit in Ouebec City in the fall of
next year.
This first summit conference had been proposed more than 20 years
ago by former President Leopold Senghor of Senegal, but the idea foun
dered on the Canadian government's refusal to permit the province of
Ouebec to attend as a separate delegation. With separatists no longer in
control of Ouebec and the strong-willed Pierre Trudeau no longer prime
minister, a compromise was finally worked out. allowing Canadian par
ticipation in the summit.
Land mines kill 32 in Sri Lanka
COLOMBO. Sri Lanka — Heavy security was imposed yesterday on
Sri Lanka's eastern district of Trincomalee following the killing of at
least 32 Sinhala civilians and four soldiers, apparently by Tamil
separatist guerrillas.
The deaths occurred after a landmine was triggered by a military con
voy. The suspected Tamil guerillas then opened fire and hurled hand
grenades at the convoy. Four government soldiers were killed and 22
others were badly wounded. The victims, who included women and
children, had been traveling in a truck carrying 60 people from the Sin
hala village of Dehiwatta on a try to buy food in Kantalin. officials said.
