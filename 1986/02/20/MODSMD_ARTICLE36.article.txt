# Cold weather was a concern
## Officials unaware of launch objections 
### 
WASHINGTON — The presidential commis
sion on the Challenger disaster yesterday disclosed
that "at least three key NASA officials" were not
informed before the Jan. 28 liftoff of strong objec
tions to launching made the night before by offi
cials at Morton Thiokol Inc., who were concerned
about the effect of the unusually cold weather on
the shuttle's solid rocket boosters.
Some company engineers were so concerned,
even after booster manufacturer Thiokol signed a
statement for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration "indicating approval of the
launch," that a number of them "still strongly
urged" against it, according to the commission
statement.
Among those objecting was Allan McDonald,
director of Thiokol's solid rocket booster or SRB
project, sources said. A witness to the pre-launch
discussions told The Washington Post yesterday
that McDonald argued that "it's so damn cold and
rf -> r e really sure of anything...."
The NASA officials, who sources said were di
rectly involved in deciding whether to launch, "had

not been notified and did not know" of these ob
jections, the commission statement said.
The commission is now focusing on who knew
what and when they knew it, a source close to the
investigation said last night. That information, and
all data concerning the cold, is considered crucial.
The leading theory on the cause of the accident is
that the unprecedented pre-launch low tempera
tures may have decreased the effectiveness of O
ring seals designed to prevent leakage of hot ex
haust gases from the booster rocket. Such a leak in
the right SRB is thought to have been the first in a
rapid series of events that led to the explosion of
the Challenger and the death of its seven crew
members about 73 seconds after launch.
In a related story. Administration and NASA
sources said yesterday that Rear Adm. Richard
Truly, a veteran of two space shuttle missions who
now heads the Naval Space Command, will be
named tod°y to succeed Jesse Moore as the NASA
associate administrator in charge of the shuttle pro
gram.
The appointment, to be announced at a news

conference by acting Administrator William
Graham, comes as the space agency is racked by
bureaucratic infighting, even as it struggles to cope
with the aftermath of the Challenger disaster.
Moore is the NASA official who gave final ap
proval for the Challenger's launching. Five days
before the Jan. 28 explosion, the agency had an
nounced Moore would become director of the
Johnson Space Center in Houston, widely regarded
as one of the space agency's premier jobs.
The Jan. 23 announcement said Moore would
continue as chief of shuttle operations through two
crucial missions in May and June: the Ulysses and
Galileo science probes to study the sun and Jupiter.
Those missions, like all shuttle flights, have been
suspended.
Several sources said the timing of Truly's ap
pointment reflected the concern of top Reagan Ad
ministration officials over apparent disarray and
discord within the agency as it comes under intense
scutiny by congressional committees and a presi
dential commission headed by former Secretary of
State William Rogers.
