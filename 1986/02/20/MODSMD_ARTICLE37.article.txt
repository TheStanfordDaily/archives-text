# Senate condemns Philippine elections
## 
### 
WASHINGTON and MANILA,
Philippines — By a vote of 85-9, the
Senate adopted a resolution yester
day declaring that the Philippine
presidential elections "were marked
by such widespread fraud that they
cannot be considered a fair reflection
of the will of the people of the
Philippines."
In the most dramatic expression yet
of bipartisan political consensus
against the government of Philippine
President Ferdinand Marcos, the
non-binding resolution said,
"America's interests are best served
in the Philippines by a government
which has a popular mandate." It
asked that President Reagan
"personally convey this finding" to
Marcos.
Secretary of State George Shultz,
meanwhile, sought to brake ac
celerating congressional momentum
for a curb on U.S. aid to the
Philippines, warning that action on
any of several pending bills should be
delayed until special presidential en

voy Philip Habib returns from a fact
finding mission there.
"We shouldn't be doing anything
about our aid levels right at the mo
ment," Shultz told the Senate Budget
Committee. "We have on our hands a
very delicate situation. We don't want
to jump at it with some precipitate ac
tion here."
The Senate vote stopped short of
recommending any concrete action in
response to the fraud finding, but key
Senate and House committee chair
men endorsed a plan to withhold U.S.
military aid from the Marcos govern
ment and channel humanitarian assis
tance through the Roman Catholic
Church and other non-governmental
organizations.
Rep. Stephen Solarz (D-N.Y.)
chief sponsor of the plan, said a vote
on it could come today in the House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee on
Asian and Pacific affairs, which he
chairs.
Senate Foreign Relations Commit

tee Chairman Richard Lugar (R-
Ind.) and House Foreign Affairs
Committee Chairman Dante Fascell
(D-Fla.) have backed key elements of
the plan, which would place military
aid in escrow "until a legitimate gov
ernment is established which has the
confidence of the Philippine people,"
as Solarz described it.
In a separate appearance, Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger told the
House Foreign Affairs Committee
that "the only real beneficiary of a
delayed or diminished military aid
program would be the New People's
Army, the communist insurgency,
and that is an outcome which we can
not support."
At the same time, Weinberger
promised to work closely with
Congress and said, "we will certainly
look at all proposed solutions."
The Senate vote, the high point in a
day of intense discussion of the
Philippines situation, appeared to
mark a shift from debate over the
legitimacy of the Philippine election

to debate over what the U.S.
response should be.
Meanwhile, in Manila, Philippine
President Ferdinand Marcos threat
ened yesterday to "exercise to the
limit" 1 his powers to "prevent tur
moil" and thwart what he said were
opposition plans to destabilize his
government through civil dis
obedience and general strikes.
Marcos did not say, however, what
specific powers he would employ or if
he would invoke martial law, as he
did from 1972 to 1981.
After receiving the credentials of
the new Soviet ambassador, the first
envoy of a major power to congratu
late Marcos on his re-election after
the disputed poll, Marcos chastised
foreign observers who monitored the
Feb. 7 election and warned against
"interference in the internal affairs of
our people." He apparently was re
ferring to U.S. congressional and
other observers who have condemned
the election as fraudulent.
