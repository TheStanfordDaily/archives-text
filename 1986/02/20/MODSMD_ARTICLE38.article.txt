Volcker rips dollar dip
WASHINGTON — Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Paul Volcker, disagreeing with Treas
ury Secretary James Baker's continued encour
agement of the decline in the value of the dollar,
warned yesterday against any further drop in the
U.S. currency on foreign exchange markets.
Testifying to Congress on his agency's semian
nual monetary policy report, Volcker dashed any
lingering hopes on Wall Street that the Fed might
encourage interest rates to fall. Instead, he noted
that the Fed has recently seen "no occasion for
significant change" in its monetary stance.
Volcker has frequently warned about the
dangers of a too-rapid plunge in the dollar, but
his testimony yesterday was much stronger
Analysts suggested that the Fed has adopted a
"wait and see" position, since its officials are
highly uncertain about how the crosscurrents
from declining oil prices, a weaker dollar and
possible cuts in the budget deficit will affect the
U.S. economy this year.
Interest rates have probably bottomed out,
analysts noted, because the U.S. economy ap
pears to be on the rebound after a period of weak
growth. That gives the Fed little reason to stim
ulate the economy further through lower interest
rates.

In addition, Volcker does not want to allow
rates to move down in the United States before
other countries lower their own interest rates,
analysts said, because it would only exacerbate
the recent decline in the dollar's value.
Antitrust overhaul
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administra
tion yesterday launched its campaign to overhaul
the nation's antitrust laws, contending that the
move is long overdue to help American busi
nesses compete abroad.
In unveiling a legislative package sent to
Capitol Hill, Attorney General Edwin Meese,
Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige and
budget director James Miller stressed that the
proposals primarily codify antitrust policies that
the administration has applied consistently since
1981.
"This is a modernization of the antitrust laws,
not a repeal of the antitrust laws," cautioned Mil
ler.
Sen. Eastland dies at 81
WASHINGTON — Former Mississippi
Senator James Eastland, a major force on

Capitol Hill and an implacable foe of racial inte
gration for nearly all of his long political career,
died yesterday in a Greenwood, Miss., hospital at
the age of 81.
Gruff in manner and hulking in physique, the
cigar-chomping Eastland entered the Senate in
1941 and did not retire until 1978. He was al
most a stereotype of a now-vanishing breed —
the Southern Democratic politicians who for
many decades, by virtue of the seniority that
came form their party's control of their home
region, dominated congressional affairs.
Stock market drops
NEW YORK — The stock market took its big
gest drop in six weeks yesterday, giving up some
of its recent dramatic gains.
Analysts said cautionary comments by the
chairman of the Federal Reserve and an upswing
in interest rates encouraged traders to cash in
profits.
1 he Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which had closed at new highs in each of the four
previous sessions, fell back 20.52 points to
1,658.26. That stood as the biggest decline for
the average since it dropped a record 39.10
points on Jan. 8.
