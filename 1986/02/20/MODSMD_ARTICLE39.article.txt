Anti-Marcos editor shot
LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles bureau
manager of the Philippine News, a newspaper
that has opposed the regime of Ferdinand
Marcos, was shot to death in his home yesterday,
a spokeswoman for Sen. Alan Cranston said.
Word that Oscar Salvatierra was shot came
from the San Francisco headquarters of the
Philippine News, Cranston spokeswoman Chris
Lopez said. Salvatierra had received a warning
that "you will he executed," Lopez said.
"I have asked FBI director William Webster to
investigate this atrocity and to offer his coopera
tion," Cranston said in a statement released by
Lopez.
He said he also asked Webster to protect
Philippine News publisher Alex Esclamado and
the paper's sales representative, Stan Aragon,
and members of their families.
"Director Webster assured me he will get right
on this matter," Cranston said.
Local FBI spokesman Fred Reagan said the
agency was investigating, but provided no details
of the slaying at Salvatierra's home in suburban
Glendale.
Storm cleanup begins
Northern Californians got a respite from a
week of torrential downpours yesterday and

thousands began the backbreaking task of clean
ing deep mud from their flooded homes.
"It looks like we're on the uphill side of things
now," said Ed Clark, a National Weather Service
forecaster. "We're expecting more rain on Friday
and Saturday, but it doesn't look like it's going to
be as major as anything we've had in the last
week."
More than 11,000 people were evacuated
during the past several days as a series of Pacific
storms dumped up to two feet of rain on some
sections of Northern California, triggering
mudslides that closed highways and destroyed
homes. Rivers rose out of their banks, flooding
towns and farmland, in some places so deep that
two-story houses were covered.
At least seven deaths were reported.
Fiedler may get break
LOS ANGELES — Los Angeles County Dis
trict Attorney Ira Reiner announced yesterday
that his office will recommend dismissal of an in
dictment against Rep. Bobbi Fiedler (R-Calif.)
for allegedly offering a $100,000 campaign con
tribution to lure state Sen. Ed Davis out of the
Republican U.S. Senate primary.
"We have made a professional assessment of
the evidence, and we have determined that the
evidence is not sufficient to (prosecute) Bobbi

Fiedler," Reiner said at a press conference.
Reiner said, however, that prosecutors will still
seek to pursue the case against Fiedler s fiance
and top aide, Paul Clarke. Both were charged
with violating the same state Election Code
statute, which makes it illegal to pay or offer to
pay a candidate to secure his withdrawal from an
election.
Fiedler, in a telephone interview from her
Washington office, said, "I am perplexed that
they are continuing to go forward with this at
all. I don't understand why they feel it is neces
sary to waste taxpayers' money on a case in which
two people have done nothing wrong."
Reiner's decision appeared to directly contra
dict statements made by his top aides during the
last three weeks while the district attorney vaca
tioned in Europe and was unavailable for public
comment.
As recently as Tuesday, Deputy District Attor
ney Steven Sowders, assigned to prosecute the
case, said he was preparing arguments to rebut
the defense's motion to dismiss the case against
Fiedler.
