# COP, minorities review proposal
## Constitution may be on spring ballot 
### KEITH SEINFELD Staff writer 
Members of campus minority
groups met with the Council of Presi
dents (COP) last night to discuss
charges that a recently rejected stu
dent government constitution threat
ened minority interests, and to con
sider including a revised document on
the ballot in the spring ASSU elec
tion.
COP member Mike Collins ex
plained to the gathering in El Centro
Chicano, "We are planning to put the
new constitution on the ballot again
in the spring, and before we make any
revisions we want input from the larg
est opposition groups, which were the
minorities." Besides the four COP
members, two ASSU senators and
seven Third World students inter
ested in changing the proposed con
stitution attended the meeting.
Donna Anderson, one of the seven
concerned students, said the reduc
tion of representatives proposed in
the document could especially harm
minorities. With a reduced and split
senate, a smaller COP and fewer
votes per student in the general elec
tion, the probability that a minority
candidate would be elected is signifi
cantly reduced, she said.
The proposed constitution,
rejected in a student body vote on
Jan. 28 and 29, would have replaced
the current 20-member senate with
two 9-member committees, one for
policy and one for funding, which to
gether would have comprised the sen
ate.
Establishment of two distinct com
mittees would have abolished the
Program Board and the Senate Ap
propriations Committee. The pro
posal would also have reduced the
number of candidates each student
can vote for from 10 to two. The
four-member COP would have been
reduced to three members and would
have had increased veto power.
The minority students at the
meeting also complained that there
would not have been an adequate sys

tem of checks and balances under the
proposed constitution. They feared
that since two steps in the current ap
peals process would have been
eliminated, while at the same time the
odds of having minority representa
tion would have been reduced,
minority groups would have been
overly vulnerable in the funding
process.
A smaller and more powerful COP
would reduce the protection provided
by the appeals process, the minority
students asserted. They said, under
the proposed guidelines two members
of the COP could vote to veto a fund
ing board decision at any time, and
that veto could be overturned only by
a two-thirds vote of the senate. "We
fear the empowerment of a small
group of people," said Rudy Fuentes,
another Third World student.
Similar claims were made in an of
ficial Black Student Union statement
issued before the constitution was
defeated. Support of this statement
by members of Amnesty Interna
tional, the Coalition Against Apart
heid, Stanford Central American Ac
tion Network. Stanford Arms Control
and Disarmament Forum, the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford, the
Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion and El Centro Chicano was
voiced at a meeting at El Centro on
Jan. 27.
The COP members, who helped
author the new constitution, said they
were not committed to any of the par
ticulars of their proposal, but rather
to the paring of bureaucracy and red
tape. They also said they felt their
proposal would actually be more ben
eficial to minorities and activists than
the current system.
However. Anderson, a former
senator, said: "Bureaucracy cannot
be equated with ineffectiveness. It is
ignorance (of the system) that hurts
people, not bureaucracy." She added
that there should be no changes,
"except possibly in the funding
boards . . . which could be made more
objective."
