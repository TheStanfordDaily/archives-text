# Rain in Spain took a detour

### KELLY SUND Staff writer 
The rains soaking Northern California have
definitely left their mark on the Stanford commu
nity.
Since the Bay Area Weather Information Service
does not receive precipitation figures from Stanford
or Palo Alto, Stanford community rainfall stats
have not been splashed across newspapers and local
TV weather reports.

Feature

In case you were wondering, the data from the
Defense Department station at Moffett Field in
Mountain View shows that 7.16 inches of rain have
fallen there from Jan. 31 to Feb. 17. The time per
iod from Feb. 11 to Feb. 17 accounted for 6.59 of
those 7.16 inches.
However, not even the torrential downpours that
have flooded our campus for over a week now could
create a consensus of opinion among our diverse
student body. A few people even took a positive
view of this year's rain.
The students who claimed to like all this moisture
tended to be those from states with high annual
precipitation rates. For example, there's sophomore
Erik Rau, who said, "I'm from Oregon, otherwise
known as Fungus Corner, so 1 feel right at home."
Or John Arima, a native of Washington, who said
he thought the rain was "great. It feels like home."
Arima found a certain degree of humor in the
deluge, saying that the funniest thing about the rain
"is that a lot of people just don't know how to react
to it. People who try to ride their bikes like normal
go through stop signs and almost run into people.
Girls freak out because their makeup gets all
runny.
Sam Edwards, one of the coun
selors at Cowell Counseling and Psy
chological Services, said his own per
sonal experience suggests the emo
tional response to such abundant
rainfall is quite the contrary to those
reactions just mentioned.
"Rain and cloudy weather tend to
encourage students to stay indoors,"
Edwards said.
Edwards added that his own un
documented suspicion is that rain has
a negative effect on students' emo
tions.
Most students surveyed echoed
Edwards' ideas.

Even junior Sari Weihl, who might
seem pro-water because she is
reputedly the first person to swim in
Lake Lagunita this year (in the rain),
said, "I loved the rain up until now,
but now I'm sick of it."
As much as students complain
about how much they miss the sunny
California weather, they should feel
quite fortunate they are not the ones
responsible for cleaning this mess up
once the deluge finally stops. That
duty falls to Stanford's groundskeep
ing crews.
A listing obtained from the
groundskeeping office stated that the
damages caused by the recent
weather include the splitting of the
fruit trees behind Margaret Jacks
Hall and the subsequent loss of their
fruit, the clogging of drainage ditches

all over campus, the loss of several
old oak trees at the computer center,
the flooding of the recently
landscaped parts of the Oval and the
loss of fronds from every palm tree on
campus. '
A search through University ar
chives under the heading "Rain in
Winter," turned up only references to
the winter of 1982-83. Daily articles
on Dec. 1 and 2, 1982, reported on a
storm that caused an estimated
$20,000 in damages.
A Daily article on Feb. 9, 1983,
stated that it had rained for 17 out of
the last 24 days. Flooding of the
suites, Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry
Building, Braun Hall, Dinkelspiel
Auditorium and the law school cost
the University an estimated $75,000
in damages and extra cleaning costs.
