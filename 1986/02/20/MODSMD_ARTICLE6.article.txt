# Parents' roles in education examined

By becoming upset over a child's school performance,
or by setting up a reward and punishment system, parents
can actually make their children's grades worse, according
to research conducted by Sanford Dornbusch, a professor
of education, human biology and sociology here.
Dornbusch reported the preliminary results of ques
tionnaires administered to 7,836 students from six Bay
Area high schools and about 3,500 parents to parents at
Capuchino High School, part of the San Mateo District,
and to teachers and parents in the Mountain View-Los
Altos district earlier this month.
The initial findings of Dornbusch's three-year study, to
be published next year, are part of a larger .study,
"Stanford and the Schools." Dornbusch's results indi
cated the relationship between parents' actions and their
children's school performance.
"Our findings are unequivocal," he said. "Emotional
upset is the worst possible reaction to poor grades. When

the parents are upset and the child is upset, we find an as
sociation with poor grades. Over time, grades get even
worse."
Setting up rewards and punishments for academic per
formance seems to do more harm than good — both are
associated with lower grades, he said. When parents give
children greater privileges — such as extended curfews
or the use of a car — because of good grades, students will
be less internally motivated to excel.
Restricting privileges because of poor grades also seems
to lead to worse performance in school, according to pre
liminary data.
In both cases, Dornbusch said, students become more
concerned with the consequences of their performance in
terms of rewards and punishments than with actual learn
ing.
"Parental lack of involvement after learning their
child's grades is not helpful," Dornbusch said.
"Encouragement helps. The low-key use of praise, en
couragement and offers to help is associated with higher
grades. Even better, such low-key positive responses are

associated with an improvement in grades over the past
two years (prior to the Stanford study)," he said.
Parenting style also has a major effect on grades in high
school, according to the study. Both "authoritarian" and
"permissive" parenting are associated with lower grades.
Research showed a third style — "authoritative"
parenting — was associated with higher grades.
Authoritarian parents establish an absolute set of
standards according to which they attempt to shape, con
trol and evaluate the behaviors and attitudes of their
children. Emphasizing obedience, respect for authority,
work, tradition and the preservation of order, these par
ents discourage verbal interaction between children and
parents.
In contrast, permissive parents allow considerable self
regulation by the child, are tolerant and accepting toward
the child's impulses, use as little punishment as possible
and make few demands for mature behavior.
Authoritative parents stress recognition of the rights of
both parents and children. These parents encour
age open communication between parents and
children, verbal give-and-take and the child's inde
pendence and individuality.
Authoritative parenting is characterized by an
expectation of mature behavior from the child,
clear setting of standards by the parents and firm
enforcements of rules and standards.
By praising children for good grades and giving
them greater freedom to make decisions, au
thoritative parents encouraged high grades, the
study showed. When grades were poor, parents
diminished student freedom, encouraged the stu
dent to try harder and also offered to help.
More than half the families did not have a single
parenting style. About one in five were purely au
thoritarian, 17 percent were purely authoritative

and 6 percent were purely permissive.
Girls reported a slightly lower level of au
thoritarian parenting and a slightly higher level of
authoritative parenting than boys. Among ethnic
groups, Asian, black and Hispanic families were
more authoritarian and less authoritative in their
parenting style than Anglo families.
Other findings from the Dornbusch study in
clude:
• Divorce has a significant impact on school per
formance. "Parental breakups in the first six years
of a child's life have a long-lasting impact. High
school grades are lower for those children than for
those whose parental breakup comes after the child
reaches age six," Dornbusch said, adding, "The
children from single-parent households, as well as
stepchildren, do less well in school than those from
households which include both natural parents."
• In what Dornbusch calls "a strange and very up
setting finding," Hispanic females tend to have
lower grades than would be expected.

• Another "puzzling result," he said, is the lack of
a relationship between the level of effort reported
by young black male students and their grades.
• Among Asians, Hispanics, foreign-born blacks
and foreign-born Anglos, "where a foreign lan
guage is spoken at home, the kids are doing better
in school," Dornbusch said.
• Students whose parents enforce rules regarding
television watching tend to have higher grades.
• High school girls who spend more time par
ticipating in sports also tend to have higher grades.
The same goes for high school boys, except among
those most active in athletics.
Sam Johnson, principle of Capuchino High
School, has been involved with the study since its
inception. The 1,350 students at Capuchino spent a
class period in April filling out the questionnaires.
They were filled out anonymously, using student
identification numbers, so that student responses
could be matched to and compared with the par
ents' responses.
