# Parents' roles in education examined

By becoming upset over a child's school performance,
or by setting up a reward and punishment system, parents
can actually make their children's grades worse, according
to research conducted by Sanford Dornbusch, a professor
of education, human biology and sociology here.
Dornbusch reported the preliminary results of ques
tionnaires administered to 7,836 students from six Bay
Area high schools and about 3,500 parents to parents at
Capuchino High School, part of the San Mateo District,
and to teachers and parents in the Mountain View-Los
Altos district earlier this month.
The initial findings of Dornbusch's three-year study, to
be published next year, are part of a larger .study,
"Stanford and the Schools." Dornbusch's results indi
cated the relationship between parents' actions and their
children's school performance.
"Our findings are unequivocal," he said. "Emotional
upset is the worst possible reaction to poor grades. When

the parents are upset and the child is upset, we find an as
sociation with poor grades. Over time, grades get even
worse."
Setting up rewards and punishments for academic per
formance seems to do more harm than good — both are
associated with lower grades, he said. When parents give
children greater privileges — such as extended curfews
or the use of a car — because of good grades, students will
be less internally motivated to excel.
Restricting privileges because of poor grades also seems
to lead to worse performance in school, according to pre
liminary data.
In both cases, Dornbusch said, students become more
concerned with the consequences of their performance in
terms of rewards and punishments than with actual learn
ing.
"Parental lack of involvement after learning their
child's grades is not helpful," Dornbusch said.
"Encouragement helps. The low-key use of praise, en
couragement and offers to help is associated with higher
grades. Even better, such low-key positive responses are

associated with an improvement in grades over the past
two years (prior to the Stanford study)," he said.
Parenting style also has a major effect on grades in high
school, according to the study. Both "authoritarian" and
"permissive" parenting are associated with lower grades.
Research showed a third style — "authoritative"
parenting — was associated with higher grades.
Authoritarian parents establish an absolute set of
standards according to which they attempt to shape, con
trol and evaluate the behaviors and attitudes of their
children. Emphasizing obedience, respect for authority,
work, tradition and the preservation of order, these par
ents discourage verbal interaction between children and
parents.
In contrast, permissive parents allow considerable self
regulation by the child, are tolerant and accepting toward
the child's impulses, use as little punishment as possible
and make few demands for mature behavior.
Authoritative parents stress recognition of the rights of
