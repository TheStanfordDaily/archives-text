# Prof, questions animal research

Calling himself a former "classic vivisec
tor," a professor in the UC-Davis School of
Veterinary Medicine told an audience of 30
here last night that he now questions the
morality, efficacy and necessity of animal re
search.
Ned Buyukmihci, a biomedical scientist,
said the issue of animal research involves
questions " not of a scientific nature, but of a
moral nature."
Even if an experiment can be
"scientifically justified," an animal's suffer
ing is still not acceptable, Buyukmihci said.
"I was killing creatures who want to live
just as much as I do and, as far as I'm con
cerned, have just as much a right as I do," he
said. "Those mice have feelings. Pinch their

leg and they cry out. They want to live. They
cry, bleed, have families and have a social
order."
Buyukmihci, who spoke in a classroom in
CERAS, has given up experimental
medicine and now only practices clinically,
he said.
He said he could not justify treating
"other animals so radically differently [from
the way] we treat ourselves. We don't try to
justify it. We just tacitly adhere to the prin
ciple that might makes right."
"By this logic, if another more intelligent,
stronger being wants to study us, we have
the moral obligation to allow them," he said.
Buyukmihci expressed doubts concerning
the efficacy of such animal experimentation,
maintaining that "the only research of any
real and lasting value would be research on

human beings."
Animals are not subject to the same
physical "forces" and have different con
stitutions, said Buyukmihci, adding, "A
monkey in a cage is not the paradigm for
human behavior, and not even for monkey
behavior."
The nature of present experimentation in
herently distorts data received, because
animals are not housed in surroundings
similar to their natural habitat, according to
Buyukmihci.
"The way we treat animals in the lab has a
tremendous effect on the metabolism and
the immune system. The data may not be
worth anything," he said, adding that "a
great deal of data is flawed."

Prof. Ned Buyukmichi of UC-
Davis discusses animal research.
Buyukmihci also questioned
the necessity of such research,
saying, "It is not absolutely ne
cessary for our survival.
Animal experimentation has
been big in only the last
hundred years, and our species
has survived."
Such research has produced
some results, but "we've also
gotten a lot of things without
(animal research)," he said.
He added that scientists of
ten do animal research not to
improve humans' quality of
life, but for the "thrill" of dis
covery, to gain promotions and
status and to justify receiving
research funds.
