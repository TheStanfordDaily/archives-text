# Tax reform threatens pension system here
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
This is the third in a series of articles focusing
on the effects of recent federal tax legislation on
the University.
Stanford's retirement plans for approximately
8,000 faculty and staff would be jeopardized by
language in the proposed Tax Reform Act of
1985 (HR 3838) which may necessitate
"fundamental changes" in the University's pen
sion system, according to John Working, Uni
versity personnel benefits manager.
The tax reform proposal, passed by the U.S.
House of Representatives on Dec. 17 and now
under consideration by the Senate Finance
Committee, would discourage the use of multi
ple retirement plans for different employee
categories offered by most colleges and univer
sities.
The proposal would also severely limit the
amount of money individual plan members
could set aside each year toward their retire
ment benefits, and the new limits would include
existing individual retirement account (IRA)
limits for workers and non-working spouses.
The plan would impose a new tax on early
withdrawal of funds from supplemental retire
ment plans.
Both the House and the Senate have ap
proved non-binding resolutions indicating sup
port for a Jan. 1, 1987 effective date for all
changes.
Although the proposed changes would be the

first effort by the Internal Revenue Service to
regulate the plans of educational institutions,
the proposal is in keeping with the trend of in
creased restrictions over the last 10 years, ac
cording to Liz Bryson, assistant manager of
benefit development.
Stanford maintains two pension plans for its
employees. Approximately 4,000 non-exempt
employees are automatically covered in a non
contributory, defined benefit plan. Under this
plan, the University provides the equivalent of 2
percent of accumulated yearly pay from a pen
sion fund. Upon retirement, employees are paid
a specified amount, or annuity, at monthly in
tervals.
Another 4,000 faculty and exempt employees
are eligible to participate in an optional contrib
utory retirement plan. Plan members contribute
5 percent of their annual salary to an investment
tund, which is matched by a University contri
bution of 10 percent of yearly salary. Plan mem
bers may choose any one of the investment op
tions offered by seven companies, including the
Calvert, a socially responsible mutual fund.
The University also maintains a supplemen
tal, tax-deferred plan for faculty, exempt and
non-exempt employees. The optional plan
allows employees to save a percentage of their
pay in addition to other participatory plans.
According to Working, combining the exist
ing contributory and non-contributory benefit
packages as well as the supplemental plan into a
system with a single coverage test would be ex
traordinarily difficult. "How we would bring

both groups together into some single plan
which would meet the (proposed) coverage test
requirements is a question of mega
proportions," Working said.
Other colleges and universities are likely to
face similar problems because most institutions
also have different plans for faculty, exempt and
non-exempt employees, Working said.
The $7,000 cap on yearly contributions
would also interfere with the IRA programs,
which had previously imposed limits separate
from the Stanford plan.
Although he called speculation on possible
alternatives to the University's pension system
"premature," Working said restructuring the
University plan to a single system would be pos
sible.
The resulting plan would be based on a
salary-related formula, percentage of total pay,
or some combination of both alternatives. The
resulting benefit plan could also take social se
curity benefits into account when attempting to
achieve an equitable balance between the pen
sions of high and low salary employees.
In a time of "heightened concern for the fin
ancial needs" of the University, Working said it
would be hard to imagine a more difficult time
to undertake such changes.
Concern about the possible effects of the pro
posal has prompted many employees to ask ad
ministrators to advise them whether or not to
maintain their funds in the supplemental plan,
Bryson said.
The proposal would apply a 15 percent tax to

supplemental plan withdrawals before age 59
V2, disability or death, but would continue to
exempt withdrawals in cases of "financial
hardship."
"The answer is that we (can't) really advise
anybody to take everything out now," Bryson
said. Because precedent would indicate that the
15 percent tax on withdrawals would also be
retroactive, penalties could potentially be ac
crued from now until the time the legislation
passes, Bryson said.
The proposed reform measures represent a
change in the way the government views pen
sion plans maintained by non-profit organiza
tions, Working said. Although businesses have
always been subject to coverage tests, corpora
tions recieve tax-exemptions for maintaining
plans. Despite the control over corporate plans,
public sector organizations have been permitted
to adopt plans without many of the same con
straints on plan design and coverage, allowing
the formulation of plans similar to Stanford's
salary deduction plan.
"Historically, non-profit organizations prob
ably have enjoyed fewer controls because they
did not have the same funds available to fund
formal retirement plans, so one of the ways to
get into the covering of (employee) benefits was
the salary deduction arrangement," Working
said.
Previous federal regulations put pension
plans in a very favorable tax situation. Corpora-
tions could claim funding costs as a
business expense, and the portion of
employee salaries paid to a pension
plan was not included as taxable
income.
According to Working, corpora
tions have recently established new
benefit plans similar to the salary re
duction plans offered by non-profit
organizations. These new plans,
sometimes with matching corporate
funds, supplemented normal corpor
ate retirement programs and were
possibly targeted as a revenue source
by the federal government. The
realization that non-profit organiza
tions have the same advantages leads
to greatly increased revenue poten
tial, Working said.
