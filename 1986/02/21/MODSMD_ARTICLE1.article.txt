# Perkins launches petition campaign
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Senior Robby Perkins and mem
bers of the ASSU Senate Wednesday
launched a petition seeking student
signatures in an effort to establish a
permanent ASSU review commission
to monitor Stanford police.
In addition, the ASSU is currently
soliciting contributions from dormi
tories and fraternities to finance an
independent investigation of alleged
police brutality in connection with
student arrests at an Oct. 14 apart
heid protest in Old Union.
"We merely want to provide more
complete and objective assessments
to the community. Police misconduct
is the only enemy," said Perkins, who
is pursuing an independent lawsuit
against Stanford police and Santa
Clara County Sheriffs officers.
ASSU Senator John van Loben
Sels said yesterday that senate repre
sentatives plan to meet with Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy and
other administrators early next week
to discuss the intended makeup and
function of the commission.
"We're not sure what Kennedy will
propose to us," van Loben Sels said.
"It's not going to be solely an inves
tigative body. We haven't defined its
role specifically. It probably won't
end up having the 'teeth' we want it
to, but it will be some sort of compro
mise."
Van Loben Sels, a junior, said the
review commission petition, which
would require 1,600 signatures to be
placed on the ASSU fee assessment
ballot, is being circulated in the event
of a failure to reach an agreement
with Kennedy.
"We would greatly prefer to have
the commission organized by the ad
ministration, if we can reach an
agreement," van Loben Sels said.
Perkins told Alondra residents
Wednesday night that all students
would benefit from the establishment
of a permanent police review com
mission.
"I'm a senior. The review commis
sion will be for your benefit," Perkins
said. He cited several examples of
what he described as suspect behavior
by Stanford police, including the al
leged implementing of compliance
pain holds at the October arrests.
