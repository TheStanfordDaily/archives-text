# Philippine officials blast D.C.-Manila relationship
## 
### KELLY SUND Staff writer 
The relationship between the United States and the
Philippines is at an all-time low, a Filipino official said
here last night.
Philippine Consul Shulan Primavera, featured in a
forum at Tresidder Union, said poor U.S.-Philippine rela
tions could be partly attributed to the "naive and mali
cious" media coverage of the recent election in the
United States.
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos defeated his
challenger, Corazon Aquino, in a Feb. 7 election marred
by widespread fraud. The Marcos-controlled National As
sembly declared the president the victor in the election
Feb. 15. Aquino, who claims that only cheating by Marcos
deprived her of an election victory, has vowed to continue
her opposition to Marcos.
Primavera said, "American democracy, as understood
in Washington, D.C., is not what is in the Philippines."
While acknowledging that the Philippines owe much to
the United States, Primavera said Filipinos expect
"respect and reciprocity, in place of accusation and con
descension" from the United States.
„ When asked to comment about allegations that 1.5 mil
lion Filipinos were removed from the registered voter
rolls prior to the election, Primavera said he had "no
basis" for answering the question.
Philippine Consulate Information Officer Angelo Casto

said that although there did appear to be "irregularities
in the election on both sides, the consensus of observers
was that these were not significant enough to alter the final
result.
Philippine Commercial Attache Felipe Sarmiento said
it is not the role of the United States to determine if
Marcos is "duly constituted," but to work with him be
cause he holds the position of president.
If the United States consistently concerned itself with
the procedures involved in choosing leaders, it would be
unable to deal with the governments of many countries,
Sarmiento said.

Filipinos expect 'respect and
reciprocity.'

Casto and Sarmiento said the pressure the U.S. places
on the Philippines could make support from communist
countries — such as the Soviet Union— appear attractive
to Filipinos.
According to the consulate representatives, Filipinos
view the United States favorably.
But Manuel Gaspay, a Filipino graduate student, said
many Filipinos, particularly the younger generation, have
a less positive view of the United States.
