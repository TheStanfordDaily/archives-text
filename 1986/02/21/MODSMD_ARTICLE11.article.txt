## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Revamp funding process 
### 
The recent controversy between the Asian-
American community and the ASSU Program Board
over the allocation of annual funds highlights the con
fusion and mystery which surrounds the funding
process for student groups at Stanford.
Many questions have been raised over the past few
years as to the criteria which are used by the Program
Board to determine the allocation of funds. In the past
year, the ASSU Senate and the Program Board have
taken steps to formulate more specific guidelines in or
der to clarify this process. These steps have included
requests for more detailed information from student
groups and the institution of an appeals process, which
— according to the board — will allow students to have
more input into funding decisions.
While these actions are to be commended, many
problems still exist with the current procedure. As it
now stands, the funding process is designed as a test to
see which student groups measure up to a set of loosely
defined criteria established by the senate. Those that
cannot pass do not receive funding. The process,
however, should be more of a constructive dialogue
betweeen those applying for funding and those who
decide on the allocation of funds. Clear guidelines
should be established, so that the board can work with

these groups, not against them.
The Program Board says it is revising the funding
process in order to insure more accountability on the
part of student groups, but the board itself must be ac
countable for its own actions and decisions. Part of the
reason the Asian-American Activities Center was ini
tially given a zero recommendation was that the Pro
gram Board members were unaware of the function of
the center — despite the fact that the center has been
receiving money from the board for several years. This
is not only "unfortunate" as one of the board members
put it; it is inexcusable. It is their job to know such
things. Just as student groups must be responsible and
be able to explain their budget proposals, the Program
Board must be informed when they make their
decisons.
The purpose of the Program Board should not be to
make it as difficult as possible for student groups to
receive funding, but rather to facilitate the allocation
of funds so that student groups are able to sponsor cul
tural, educational and social events for the campus
community. At the moment, the funding process forces
groups to spend large amounts of time and energy
trying to secure money — resources they should be
using to pursue and promote their acitvities.
