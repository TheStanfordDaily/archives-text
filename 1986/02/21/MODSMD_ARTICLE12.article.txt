Daily incorrect on
fraternity policies
The editorial "Toughen Up Frat
Policy," (Daily, Feb. 11) had several
errors of fact that warrant correction.
(It would have helped if the edito
rial's author had checked his/her facts
with someone prior to writing the
piece.) The following, I hope, helps
correct some of the errors.
The Task Force on Fraternities and
Sororities at Stanford has not yet sub
mitted its report to the dean of Stu
dent Affairs. On May 30, 1984, the
dean received six recommendations
from the Task Force, with a promise
that the report, which would explain
the rationale behind the recommen
dations, would be forthcoming. It is
still forthcoming.
. The Task Force did not call for an
end to the rush process.
Dean Lyons has, in fact, accepted
recommendation No. 4, "The Uni
versity should acknowledge the value
provided students by fraternal organ
izations, and should afford them Uni
versity support and guidance." The
implication of the editorial, that the
dean has decided to ignore the other
five recommendations, is simply
wrong.
The allegations about the meaning
to be attributed to recent news stories
about behavior problems of some fra
ternities are the subject of a letter to
you from Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Joe Pisano. Consequently, I won't ad
dress that here.
The editorial writer assumes that
my recent letter to the Theta Delts
was the first they had heard about the
concerns raised in the letter. That
(untested) assumption is incorrect.
Nothing in the letter should have
come as a surprise to the house —
both because I and others have raised
the issues with house officers and
managers on several occasions, orally

and in writing, and because it is the
responsibility of house leaders to
keep house members informed of
matters like this.
Which brings me to what was per
haps the most disturbing element of
the editorial. The writer seems to feel
that it is appropriate and desirable for
the University to take an extremely
parental role in disciplining
fraternites — a role that is contrary to
the fundamental way the University
treats ail other students and student
groups. We do believe, with fraterni
ties as with other student organiza
tions, that it is our role to provide
guidance, especially to elected stu
dent leaders. We are also committed
to collective responsibility — that is,
that leaders and members of the
group are accountable for the behav
ior of that group. That should include
students setting rules for their own
group's behavior within the broad
guidelines established by the Univer
sity. Strong and well-governed frater
nities do that for themselves. Ill
managed ones wait to be told when
they have done something wrong.
During the deliberations of the
Task Force, the question arose as to
how much "policing" of fraternal
groups is appropriate to expect of the
University. Should student groups
that require excessive monitoring be
cause of their unwillingness or in
ability to govern their own behavior
responsibly continue to enjoy Uni
versity recognition? The answer from
the majority of the Task Force was
no. That is not to imply that the
majority felt that fraternal organiza
tions inherently required more moni
toring than was appropriate (some
members did, some did not.) The
conclusion was that the University
ought to give full support to fraternal
groups that displayed the capacity of
responsible self-governance, and
ought to remove those groups that
did not.

Perhaps we have been too slow to
remove fraternities with persistent
behavior problems. Perhaps our
belief that groups can govern them
selves effectively, given guidance,
time and patience, has made us
tolerate more than we should. That is
a question about which reasonable
people may disagree. We continue to
be committed to students taking re
sponsibility for themselves and for
their organizations, and we will con
tinue to work with fraternities
toward that end. In the last analysis,
the future of each fraternal groups on
campus rests in the hands of its stu
dent leaders and members.

Make a difference

World hunger, arms control and
education are issues that often come
up in the course of dinner conversa
tion. Everyone has their own opinion
on what should be done, but imple
menting any type of action is often
difficult. One often questions his or
her ability to influence change.
Access, however, is much closer than
it seems. There are plenty of ways to
make a difference at Stanford and in
the surrounding communities. Come
find out at the conference "You Can
Make a Difference: Private Initiatives
& Public Responsibilites." On Satur
day, Feb. 22, over 20 individuals w ho
have made a difference will come to
gether with the Stanford community
to discuss their activities in public ser
vice and individual involvement. The
conference is meant to provide inspi
ration and food for thought. World
problems can't be solved overnight,
but it is through the combined efforts
of individuals that progress is made.
