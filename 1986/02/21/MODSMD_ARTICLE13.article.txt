## America's policy is embarrassing 
### 
You know, I wasn't embarrassed when we
elected President Reagan. I was somewhat in
credulous, even though it was inevitable — some
thing like what the skunk frozen in the middle of
the road must feel when the approaching car finally
arrives. But embarrassed? Nah.
I wasn't embarrassed by trickle-down economics,
either. Even though our society has at its roots an
impoverished underclass that no laissez faire lip

service can reach, I was not embarrassed. When
they said there wouldn't be a deficit when taxes
were cut and spending increased — economic
growth would take care of it, they said — I didn't
hide my head in shame. I did wonder where they
learned arithmetic, but I did not blush.
I wasn't embarrassed by pipeline embargos, by
reduced student loans, by Pentagon designer bolts,
by "no hunger in America." Believe it or not, I
wasn't embarrassed when we "commenced bomb
ing in five minutes;" or when we decided to keep
studying acid rain, not yet believing that one and
one makes two; or when we walked out of the
World Court like a petulant child. "Star Wars"
doesn't embarrass me, though it is ludicrous and it
scares me to death. And, doubt it if you must, I
refuse to be embarrassed by the fact that I thought
of all these things, and more, in about three
minutes time.
But in these last few days shame has finally bro
ken through my armor, and I find that embarrass
ment runs deep. The tip of the lance was the
(literally) incredible statement on Feb. 11 of

Reagan, who smiled upon the emergence of a
"two-party system" in the Philippines in the face of
well-documented reports of massive and violent
fraud by the supporters of Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos in the recent elections there. I
wish to make something clear to our chief execu
tive:
A two-party system cannot exist when one party
is prevented from winning by force of arms and
legislative fiat. Such a system is called a dictator
ship.
Were this another of Reagan's retractable slips
of the tongue, I would not be upset. But it is merely
the most poignant reminder to date of the five-year
old resurrection of the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy
to policy-making status, in spirit if not in name.
And that is truly embarrassing.
As a result of a simplistic, misguided and down
right inaccurate contention that communism is at
the root of all evil, our nation has compiled "a
remarkable record of backing the wrong horse," in
the words of Bishop Desmond Tutu. Wrong in both
practical (geopolitical) and moral terms. When
dealing with other nations we test only for the pres
ence or absence of Marxism, ignoring such minor
matters as hunger, poverty, local history and cul
ture and the will of the people. In the Philippines,
we focus only on our military bases and Marcos'
spurious bleatings about communist control of the
popular opposition movement. In this way we
insure the loss of those bases, for how can Corazon
Aquino and the opposition movement, sure to tri
umph in time, allow the United States to maintain
Clark Field and Subik Bay when we cravenly sup
port their oppressor in the time of their country's
greatest need?

In the Philippines, we should condemn the
Marcos regime for subverting the elections and
embrace the Aquino candidacy as the only hope of
bringing peaceful reform to the islands, while doing
everything we can to convince Marcos to retire to
his accumulated wealth. In South Africa, the black
majority yearns for the United States to withdraw
its support for the apartheid regime. Sure, it would
cost a great deal of money in the short term
(perhaps one-twentieth of our yearly defense
budget), but in the reconstructed South Africa to
come the United States would be welcomed as a
savior rather than condemned as a coward. We
must stop our plainly illegal attempt to overthrow
the Nicaraguan government. Instead, let us
negotiate a settlement within the Contadora
framework, secure in the knowledge that economic
health and land reform in Central America is the
most effective deterrent to communism, and let us
work for those reforms. In each case, the most
compelling reason for these actions is not their in
evitable long-term benefits to U.S. prestige and in
fluence. Rather, we should take these actions be
cause they are morally right. Our country should be
secure enough in wealth and democratic traditions
to take a longer view of things and to act out of en
lightened, not short-sighted, self interest. Instead,
our government runs screaming from a communist
bogeyman seen in every shadow.
Why do we allow the communists to push us
around this way? Why don't we put old Joe
McCarthy in permanent retirement? I certainly
don't like to be embarrassed — do you?

budget), but in the reconstructed South Africa to
come the United States would be welcomed as a
savior rather than condemned as a coward. We
must stop our plainly illegal attempt to overthrow
the Nicaraguan government. Instead, let us
negotiate a settlement within the Contadora
framework, secure in the knowledge that economic
health and land reform in Central America is the
most effective deterrent to communism, and let us
work for those reforms. In each case, the most
compelling reason for these actions is not their in
evitable long-term benefits to U.S. prestige and in
fluence. Rather, we should take these actions be
cause they are morally right. Our country should be
secure enough in wealth and democratic traditions
to take a longer view of things and to act out of en
lightened, not short-sighted, self interest. Instead,
our government runs screaming from a communist
bogeyman seen in every shadow.
Why do we allow the communists to push us
around this way? Why don't we put old Joe
McCarthy in permanent retirement? I certainly
don't like to be embarrassed — do you?

You know, I wasn't embarrassed when we
elected President Reagan. I was somewhat in
credulous, even though it was inevitable — some
thing like what the skunk frozen in the middle of
the road must feel when the approaching car finally
arrives. But embarrassed? Nah.
I wasn't embarrassed by trickle-down economics,
either. Even though our society has at its roots an
impoverished underclass that no laissez faire lip

service can reach, I was not embarrassed. When
they said there wouldn't be a deficit when taxes
were cut and spending increased — economic
growth would take care of it, they said — I didn't
hide my head in shame. I did wonder where they
learned arithmetic, but I did not blush.
I wasn't embarrassed by pipeline embargos, by
reduced student loans, by Pentagon designer bolts,
by "no hunger in America." Believe it or not, I
wasn't embarrassed when we "commenced bomb
ing in five minutes;" or when we decided to keep
studying acid rain, not yet believing that one and
one makes two; or when we walked out of the
World Court like a petulant child. "Star Wars"
doesn't embarrass me, though it is ludicrous and it
scares me to death. And, doubt it if you must, I
refuse to be embarrassed by the fact that I thought
of all these things, and more, in about three
minutes time.
But in these last few days shame has finally bro
ken through my armor, and I find that embarrass
ment runs deep. The tip of the lance was the
(literally) incredible statement on Feb. 11 of

Reagan, who smiled upon the emergence of a
"two-party system" in the Philippines in the face of
well-documented reports of massive and violent
fraud by the supporters of Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos in the recent elections there. I
wish to make something clear to our chief execu
tive:
A two-party system cannot exist when one party
is prevented from winning by force of arms and
legislative fiat. Such a system is called a dictator
ship.
Were this another of Reagan's retractable slips
of the tongue, I would not be upset. But it is merely
the most poignant reminder to date of the five-year
old resurrection of the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy
to policy-making status, in spirit if not in name.
And that is truly embarrassing.
As a result of a simplistic, misguided and down
right inaccurate contention that communism is at
the root of all evil, our nation has compiled "a
remarkable record of backing the wrong horse," in
the words of Bishop Desmond Tutu. Wrong in both
practical (geopolitical) and moral terms. When
dealing with other nations we test only for the pres
ence or absence of Marxism, ignoring such minor
matters as hunger, poverty, local history and cul
ture and the will of the people. In the Philippines,
we focus only on our military bases and Marcos'
spurious bleatings about communist control of the
popular opposition movement. In this way we
insure the loss of those bases, for how can Corazon
Aquino and the opposition movement, sure to tri
umph in time, allow the United States to maintain
Clark Field and Subik Bay when we cravenly sup
port their oppressor in the time of their country's
greatest need?

In the Philippines, we should condemn the
Marcos regime for subverting the elections and
embrace the Aquino candidacy as the only hope of
bringing peaceful reform to the islands, while doing
everything we can to convince Marcos to retire to
his accumulated wealth. In South Africa, the black
majority yearns for the United States to withdraw
its support for the apartheid regime. Sure, it would
cost a great deal of money in the short term
(perhaps one-twentieth of our yearly defense
budget), but in the reconstructed South Africa to
come the United States would be welcomed as a
savior rather than condemned as a coward. We
must stop our plainly illegal attempt to overthrow
the Nicaraguan government. Instead, let us
negotiate a settlement within the Contadora
framework, secure in the knowledge that economic
health and land reform in Central America is the
most effective deterrent to communism, and let us
