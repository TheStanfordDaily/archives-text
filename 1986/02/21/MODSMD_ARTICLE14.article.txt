# Racism still alive in U.S.
## 
### 
The United States has taken huge strides toward resolv
ing the "race problem." Here we are in the country which
enslaved blacks for hundreds of years, yet 1986 finds us
celebrating, together, a national holiday in honor of Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr., only the second time the nation
has seen fit to bestow the honor of a national holiday on
any individual. Moreover, Americans of all colors have
banded together to condemn South Africa's cancerous
system of racial division, antagonism and inequality — a
malignancy America suffered from 30 years ago, but has
since rid itself of.
Sadly, the progress we've made in healing the rift be
tween the races has blinded us to the profound, somewhat
intractable, division, misunderstanding and tension that
still very much characterizes racial relations in this
country.

Columnist Richard Reeves presents a sobering, but ac
curate, description of the chasm between poor blacks and
mainstream America: "Huge numbers of blacks live in
enclaves -7- ghettos — that can described a& .«
countries. We police our borders \yjth those placls. We
send in diplomats — social workers — to learn the local
language and customs. We pour in foreign aid — welfare
— in the hope that we'll keep the natives quiet." This is
the "other America" in which most blacks live.
Reeves continues: "American blacks are not being ed
ucated, and because of that the racial and economic divi
sions in the country will inevitably become wider and far
more dangerous." As my roommate often reminds me, "If
the present trends continue, 70 percent of black men in
the United States will be unemployed by the year 2000,
and the implications of that are frightening, both for
blacks and for the nation as a whole."
Even for the blacks who are educated and gainfully
employed, a rift of misunderstanding and misperception
separates them, too, from mainstream white America.
In spite of efforts to pretend otherwise, racial tension
and misunderstanding in supposedly "integrated" envi
ronments exists, and it takes many forms. It takes the
form of whites making jokes of racial incidents and
stereotypes which are too near and too painful for most
blacks to laugh at. It takes the form of naive white stu
dents' genuine inability to understand blacks' desire for a
"theme house," when, to most black students I know, the
need and desire for a theme house is obvious and well un
derstood. In everyday life, such signs of the United States'
racial divide often go unnoticed. Some controversial
events, however, expose the latent stereotypes, misun
derstandings and ignorance which taint racial relations in
the United States. At these times, the width and depth of

this country's racial chasm becomes apparent and cannot
be denied or ignored. The election of Harold Washington
in Chicago and the prominence of Louis Farrakhan are
two such phenomena.
The prospect of a black mayor frightened the hell out of
white Chicago. As one journalist put it, white Chicago was
filled with "plain old wet your pants fear." And with the
fear came evidence of their deeply held prejudices. Insult
ing literature, describing the horrendous changes that
would befall the city should Washington become mayor,
was circulated: the subway would be renamed "Soul
Train." The elevators in city hall would be removed be
cause blacks would prefer to change floors by swinging
from the cables. Crossed drumsticks would become the
city seal, and the city itself would be renamed
"Chicongo."
Far from being isolated examples, these incidents
reflect the racial divisiveness that existed all along in
Chicago. The election exposed and, thereby, exacerbated
the racial fears, animosities, stereotypes and differences
that everyone had tried to imagine away. Leanita
McClain, a black journalist writing at the time for the
Chicago Tribune, experienced and commented on the ra
cial polarization that occurred during the Washington
election.
The experience brought her to the same realization that
I and many other "successful" blacks have wrestled with:
"I had put so much effort into belonging, and whites I
knew had put so much effort into making me feel as if I
belonged, that we all deceived ourselves. There was al
tways,Jthe joking about "it"— those matchings of suntans
against black skin, or finding common ground on the evils
of racism. But none of us had ever dealt with the deeper
inhibitions, myths and misperceptions that this society has
force-fed us. The prominence of Minister Louis Farrak
han further signifies this country's racial divide. In nearly
every city Farrakhan visits, a coalition of white and Jewish
leaders attempts to cancel his speech, branding him a
racist demagogue. Yet, in these same cities, blacks flock to
hear him. The same rhetoric which infuriates and insults
whites uplifts and inspires blacks. What's more, the blacks
to whom Farrakhan appeals are not solely the
"downtrodden masses." Farrakhan's message of black
power through self-help appeals to even the most
"successful" blacks.
Farrakhan's September speech in Los Angeles, for ex
ample, drew an obvious cross section of black Los An
geles. And the crowd loved him. Before I knew it, even'l
was on my feet, applauding and cheering "go 'head
Brother, Speak." To The Los Angeles Herald Examiner,
the speech was an attack on the Jews; to many blacks Jt
was an inspirational, uplifting message of hope. To many
Jews, Farrakhan is a hate-filled demagogue; to many
blacks he is the "Brother who tells it like it is." That dif
ferent groups could perceive one man and his message so
differently powerfully reflects a chasm between the races
we had better attend to soon.
We have made great progress in race relations. Yet, as
far as we've come, we have even farther to go.

han further signifies this country's racial divide. In nearly
every city Farrakhan visits, a coalition of white and Jewish
leaders attempts to cancel his speech, branding him a
racist demagogue. Yet, in these same cities, blacks flock to
hear him. The same rhetoric which infuriates and insults
whites uplifts and inspires blacks. What's more, the blacks
to whom Farrakhan appeals are not solely the
"downtrodden masses." Farrakhan's message of black
power through self-help appeals to even the most
"successful" blacks.
Farrakhan's September speech in Los Angeles, for ex

geles. And the crowd loved him. Before I knew it, even'l
was on my feet, applauding and cheering "go 'head
Brother, Speak." To The Los Angeles Herald Examiner,
the speech was an attack on the Jews; to many blacks Jt
was an inspirational, uplifting message of hope. To many
Jews, Farrakhan is a hate-filled demagogue; to many
blacks he is the "Brother who tells it like it is." That dif

The United States has taken huge strides toward resolv
ing the "race problem." Here we are in the country which
enslaved blacks for hundreds of years, yet 1986 finds us
celebrating, together, a national holiday in honor of Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr., only the second time the nation
has seen fit to bestow the honor of a national holiday on
any individual. Moreover, Americans of all colors have
banded together to condemn South Africa's cancerous
system of racial division, antagonism and inequality — a
malignancy America suffered from 30 years ago, but has
since rid itself of.
Sadly, the progress we've made in healing the rift be
tween the races has blinded us to the profound, somewhat
intractable, division, misunderstanding and tension that
still very much characterizes racial relations in this
country.

Columnist Richard Reeves presents a sobering, but ac
curate, description of the chasm between poor blacks and
mainstream America: "Huge numbers of blacks live in
enclaves -7- ghettos — that can described a& .«
countries. We police our borders \yjth those placls. We
send in diplomats — social workers — to learn the local
language and customs. We pour in foreign aid — welfare
— in the hope that we'll keep the natives quiet." This is
the "other America" in which most blacks live.
Reeves continues: "American blacks are not being ed
ucated, and because of that the racial and economic divi
sions in the country will inevitably become wider and far
more dangerous." As my roommate often reminds me, "If
the present trends continue, 70 percent of black men in
the United States will be unemployed by the year 2000,
and the implications of that are frightening, both for
blacks and for the nation as a whole."
Even for the blacks who are educated and gainfully
employed, a rift of misunderstanding and misperception
separates them, too, from mainstream white America.
In spite of efforts to pretend otherwise, racial tension
and misunderstanding in supposedly "integrated" envi
ronments exists, and it takes many forms. It takes the
form of whites making jokes of racial incidents and
stereotypes which are too near and too painful for most
blacks to laugh at. It takes the form of naive white stu
dents' genuine inability to understand blacks' desire for a
"theme house," when, to most black students I know, the
need and desire for a theme house is obvious and well un
derstood. In everyday life, such signs of the United States'
racial divide often go unnoticed. Some controversial
events, however, expose the latent stereotypes, misun
derstandings and ignorance which taint racial relations in
the United States. At these times, the width and depth of

this country's racial chasm becomes apparent and cannot
be denied or ignored. The election of Harold Washington
in Chicago and the prominence of Louis Farrakhan are
two such phenomena.
The prospect of a black mayor frightened the hell out of
white Chicago. As one journalist put it, white Chicago was
filled with "plain old wet your pants fear." And with the
fear came evidence of their deeply held prejudices. Insult
ing literature, describing the horrendous changes that
would befall the city should Washington become mayor,
was circulated: the subway would be renamed "Soul
Train." The elevators in city hall would be removed be
cause blacks would prefer to change floors by swinging
from the cables. Crossed drumsticks would become the
city seal, and the city itself would be renamed
"Chicongo."
Far from being isolated examples, these incidents
reflect the racial divisiveness that existed all along in
Chicago. The election exposed and, thereby, exacerbated
the racial fears, animosities, stereotypes and differences
that everyone had tried to imagine away. Leanita
McClain, a black journalist writing at the time for the
Chicago Tribune, experienced and commented on the ra
cial polarization that occurred during the Washington
election.
The experience brought her to the same realization that
I and many other "successful" blacks have wrestled with:
"I had put so much effort into belonging, and whites I
knew had put so much effort into making me feel as if I
belonged, that we all deceived ourselves. There was al
