There's something about winter quarter that really
sinks my battle ship.
For 10 weeks out of an otherwise enjoyable academic
year, I put up with this obnoxious 6-year-old wearing a
newsprint sailor hat and a Kool-Aid grin, hooting "B-16!
B -16!" in the back of my mind.
Call Cowell, you very well may say ; but just close your
umbrella and lock your 10-speed to the nearest Mem Bike
Rack and look around White Plaza
for a minute before you call the lab
coat army that keeps Leggos from
Eggoing and the Chef Boy from Ar
deeing, and have them cart me off,
wiping your hands and sighing, glad
that I've finally finished this sen
tence.
See all the people either peram
bulating around in their per
sonalized Walkman worlds or
meditating on the air in their PQ
boxes or just holding down one of
those perforated white chairs in
front of Tresidder?
Reminds me of a robot toy I had
as a kid that would do this Charlie
Chaplin walk. When it ran into an
obstacle it would just keep bumping
up against the chair leg or the
refrigerator or our cat George or
whatever, until it ran down its
Evereadys.
Stanford students are like that winter quarter.
About as emotionally stable as weeble wobbles. As firm
in their self-images as Gumby and Pokey. With the adap
tability of Mr. Potato Head yet the flexibility of a Lincoln
Log.
And they aren't unjustified in their seasonal distresses.
I think the Med Center should issue a warning. Some
thing like, "The University has determined that prolonged
exposure to winter quarter can be hazardous to your
health."

Consider these stats from the Bureau of Burnout and
Morning Breath (the two greatest evils in the modern
Western world):
• If a couple is going to break up, they'll do it during win
ter quarter, just in time for Valentine's Day.
• The ambition to take 20 units always strikes during win
ter quarter, already the most intense quarter academically
because it's so short.
• And don't forget it's time to start the annual, rejection
filled search for a summer job or, better yet, a minionship
in the career of your choice.
• If you're destined to have a bike
accident any time during the year, it
will happen now, taking advantage
of the puddles to get your clothes
embarrassingly smeared with mud
when you fall.
• You also know it's winter quarter
when you use up the last of that roll
of quarters Mom sent you just as
you run out of clean clothes, appear
ing in public wearing your only
remaining garment — a pair of fuch
sia jogging shorts.
I* You catch some incurable rhume
after this lewd exposure to monsoon
season and have to spend a week in
bed on sheets that still haven't been
washed.
• Unbeknownst to you, during your
confinement, a foraging party of
ants has crawled into your car for
shelter and has founded a thriving metropolis on your
dashboard, holding pagan ceremonies around the Big Mac
shards you left there.
I don't mean to sound like a hopeless Eeyore the
Donkey (of Winnie the Pooh fame), but winter quarter
was a bad idea in January, and it's getting worse in
February. Makes you kind of look forward to finals,
doesn't it?
