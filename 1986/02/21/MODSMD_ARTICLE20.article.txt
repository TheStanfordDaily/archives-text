## Avanti aces appetizer

Although Avanti Pasta is located in
Los Altos, and hence off the beaten
track for most Stanford students, a
pleasant dining experience is awaiting
anyone who takes the effort to locate
this restaurant.
We journeyed to the bustling
cafe/bar/restaurant last Saturday
night, and were very pleased to step
out of the pouring rain and into its
warm atmosphere. The maitre'd
seated us immediately upon our arri
val (we had a reservation), at a nice,
candle-lit table.
The dining room was dimly lit,
and the walls were adorned with
matted prints. Hanging ceiling fans
spun lazily above the crowded tables,
which were covered with pink
tablecloths.
Cocktails and appetizers were
quickly ordered, and in the meantime
we attacked the bread that magically
appeared.
We are not talking standard bread
and butter, but rather a delight that
could be labeled as an Avanti
specialty. The bread was fresh and

warm, and the butter soft and
flavored with herbs and garlic. Within
minutes we had to request more.
But then our drinks came — a glass
of crisp Chardonnay from the Moun
tain View Winery ($4), and a tasty
blended Cajun marguerita ($2.75).
Our meal was underway.
Let's start with the best. We've
heard of tortellini, but fried tortellini?
What an incredible appetizer for
$3.95.
The bite-size pasta pieces were
filled with chicken and gracefully pre
sented in a tumeric mustard sauce.
Freshly shredded parmesan cheese
was sprinkled on top.
When the plate left our table
minutes later, the waitress casually
remarked, "Didn't like it much, did
you?" That about sums it up.
Next came the soup and salad —
both included in the price of the
entree. Nothing ingenious about the
salad. It was the soup that held our
attention.
Unfortunately not for long because
the bowl was more of a thimble (well,
maybe a big thimble).
This particular recipe was un
usually delicate and was greatly en
hanced by fresh chunks of tomato and
a dab of sour cream.
Now the entrees. The tournedos of
beef ($15.95) was served in a
Madeira wine sauce, complemented

with porcini mushrooms and ar
tichoke hearts. The meat was top
quality — so tender that it really
didn't need chewing. Surprisingly,
this dish resembled something I
would expect to be served in a French
restaurant.
We also decided to try out
" Avanti's Special Pasta Creation" for
$13.95. It was described in the menu
as "linguine with chunks of slipper
tail lobster and crab, snow peas and
cream," and it arrived just as attrac
tive as it sounded. The generous
chunks of shellfish were very tender.
And the dish was not drenched with
cream sauce, as so many seafood
pasta creations are.
Although plenty of food was
served, we still had room for dessert.
So we selected a single slice of rich,
triple-layer chocolate cake from the
pastry tray ($3). One layer resembled
fudge, another a lighter mousse, and
the bottom was almost like a chewy
Oreo cookie crust. The whole thing
was simply delicious.
Our only real complaint for the
evening was the price of coffee. A
dollar per cup .. . and either we were
charged for a refill, or the waitress
mistakenly charged us for two cups
instead of one.
So, if you want to get away from
campus for a nice dinner served in a
serene atmosphere, give Avanti Pasta
a try.
