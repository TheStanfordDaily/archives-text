Maddelena's is a typical example of fine European
dining. From the initial greeting in the foyer to the final
goodbye, the entire evening is a carefully-orchestrated
presentation of which the meal is but one high point of
many.
The restaurant contains two upstairs rooms and two
downstairs rooms. As you enter the foyer, to the right is
the main dining room, which seats approximately 50.
There is also a sitting room in which patrons can relax
after their meal. On weekends, the sitting room features
live entertainment and dancing.
Bpth rooms arg decorated in casual European elegance:
the main dining room managdfc to nfcmain un(jfergtated
even with the presence of a largjfe crystal ehantletier.
We were greeted at the uoor and escorted to a table for

two at the back of the dining room, in front of a wine
chest. Our waiter, who was half French and half Italian,
presented us with a menu that was a gourmet's dream,
with dishes from stuffed filet of sole to saddle of hare with
Diane sauce.
We started with two glasses of the house white wine,
and were presented with a small plate of hors d'oeuvres to
whet our taste buds. For appetizers we settled on a
spinach salad ($4.50) and a portion of smoked elk
($6.25), which was simply crying out to be tried.
Our trilingual waiter fired up the salad on a burner in
the middle of the dining room. The elk proved to be every
bit as exotic as it sounded.
Following the appetizers we settled on salmon in cider
and sorrel sauce and noisette of lamb with onions, both
for $ 17.50. The portions were generous without being ex
cessive, and the dishes marvelous.
To complete our meal we had a cup of espresso and a
cup of cappuccino, and a small plate of petit fours to seal v
the itjeal. Afterwards, paid a brief visit t© the
E&onj, which preserved we same comfortable and elegant, J
ambiance as the rest of the restaurant.
