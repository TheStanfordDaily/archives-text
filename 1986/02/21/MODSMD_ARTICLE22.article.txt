In commemoration of the
forthcoming 2,106 baseball games
that will constitute the 1986 major
league season, this review will be
written with a special slant for
those of you awaiting the return of
box scores and bench-clearing
brawls.
Hey baseball fans, have we got a
place for you to fill your tired-of
being-empty bellies. So crawl out
of that quicksand couch, unhand
that sweat-laden remote control,
and trade in the wide world of
sports for the wide world of your
waistline with a trip to Firenze
Pasta Etc.
The menu echoes the restau
rant's name. Indeed, do not
forsake the peace of your seventh
inning stretch unless, from some
where beneath your chest protec
ter, you feel the urge for a big
plate of noodles well-seasoned or
sauced.
Firenze fields a strong and
varied team of noodles, most of
which Come from the restaurant's
own farm system of pasta-making
machines. The only imports from
. agency, market are the tgf
ini

The leadoff hitter against our
appetites was an antipasti salad, a
crowded dish of beans (red and
garbonza), jalopena peppers, ar
tichoke hearts and hand-sliced
salami all comfortably bathed in a
light vinagrette.
We were able to put this stuff
away with a few pitches of our
forks, but we doubted its authen
ticity. Was this an Italian team we
were up against? Except for the
salami, which was definitely Ital
ian, and the artichoke hearts,
which were definitely yummy, the
antipasti did not impress us and
left us anxious for another trip to
the plate.
Our other appetizers, a bowl of
minestrone (misspelled on the
roster as "ministrone") and a stan
dard green salad, were bush
league vegetable dishes. Until the
heart of the Firenze lineup
reached our table, we didn't
realize that the soup and salad
were mere utility players to bal
ance the team's real power.
I faced a switch-hitting fet
tucine, half pesto and half alfredo.
My teammate took on a well
seasoned squad of garlic and
butter-soaked tortellini. The fet
tucine, hailing from Firenze's own
kitchen, was cooked to perfection.
The alfredo was creamy enough to
enrapture my tastebuds, but did
not oppress my stomach.: The
flavor of the pesto danced around

my mouth like well-snapped cur
veballs.
The scouting report on the tor
tellini was that they were erratic,
one time skipping across the
tongue with a quick garlic and but
ter double-play combination, an
other time sliding down the throat
unspectacularly.
Steamy satisfying cups of cap
puccino and espresso topped off
the final inning. Our post-game
talk focused on our noodle adver
saries, how worthy they were, and
how we would have truly enjoyed
battling against a few more.
The Firenze Pasta Etc. stadium,
located at 646 Santa Cruz Avenue
in Menlo Park, does not boast the
finest playing facilities. It lacks any
kind of soft artificial turf and the
chairs are as hard as those at
Candlestick.
However, Candlestick does not
serve good fresh pasta, though the
Giants are one of the favorite
meals of the National League.
Anyway, the stark decor and
glass restaurant front make us
think that Firenze would be better
suited for day games than evenings
out.
Also, if fans want to take home
souvenirs, Firenze sells its
homemade pasta and sauces over
the counter.
Overall, a good game. I consider
Firenze to be a contender in the
Pasta Division of the Peninsula
Restaurant League. Play ball!
