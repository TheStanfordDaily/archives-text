Othello (1965)
Camera One, San Jose
Laurence Olivier altered his walk
and lowered his voice an octave to
play Shakespeare's Moor of Venice
for England's National Theatre in
the early 19605; this transformation
could serve as a metaphor for the
magic of great acting. Stuart Burge's
screen version is just a filmed play,
but it preserves what may be the
most sublime performance by the
greatest actor of our time. On every
level — physical, vocal, imaginative
and emotional — Olivier matches
extraordinary daring with a level of
accomplishment that seems almost
supernatural. No one else would
think of attempting an epileptic fit
the way he does, or the romantic
flourish with which he dabs lago's
cheeks with a rose after returning
from Desdemona's chamber; and no
one else could possibly bring off
these scenes. Olivier is the Mich
elangelo of actors, expanding the
realm of what art — and man — can
ascend to. The once-in-a-lifetime
cast include Frank Finlay (a chilling
Iago), Maggie Smith (a spirited Des
demona), Derek Jacobi (Roderigo)
and Joyce Redman (Emilia).
Plays Thursday.
Dragonslayer (1981)
U.C. Theatre, Berkeley
This fantasy adventure set in sixth
century Britain offers the pleasures
of Ralph Richardson perfectly cast
as a wily sorceror, beautiful
cinematography by Derek Vanlint
and a fine score by Alex North But
the real star of the picture is the
monstrous fire-breathing dragon
cooked up by Brian Johnson and his
special effects team; their hellishly
beautiful beast looks so compelling
and fascinating that it makes the
picture take hold in the imagination.
Director/co-writer Matthew Rob
bins and producer/co-writer Hal
Barwood have fashioned the movie
with integrity and style, and they
create some great mythic moments,

including the final battle between
the dragon and Richardson, and a
shot of the dragon's spawn munch
ing on a human body. Robbins
coaxes skilled performances from
Peter MacNicol (as the sorceror's
apprentice), Caitlin Clarke and
Chloe Salaman.
Plays Tuesday with "Return to
Oz."
Agnes of God (1985)
Memorial Auditorium
John Pielmeier adapted his own
play for the screen, and Norman
Jewison directed with taste and tact,
but this psychodrama mystery thril
ler is utter tripe that strains for sig
nificance. Pielmeier's three
character study is a hand-to-hand
combat between the forces of belief
(represented by Anne Bancroft as a
Mother Superior) and the forces of
atheism (Jane Fonda, as a court psy
chiatrist) over the soul of Sister
Agnes (Meg Tilly), a young nun who
may or may not have strangled her
own baby at birth. The script springs
its not-very-surprising surprises on
us like clockwork, there's much
tedious prattling about religious vs.
secular issues, and Bancroft and
(especially) Fonda give such awful,
preening "great actresses" perfor
mances that they override even the
movie's incidental pleasures. Still,
Tilly is funny and engaging in her
role, and Sven Nykvist's cinematog
raphy has a beautiful hyper-intense
clarity.
Plays Sunday night.
The Seventh Seal (1956)
New Yarsity, Palo Alto
With this medieval puzzle-drama,
Ingmar Bergman rose to heights
that none of his subsequent "dark"
movies — except for "Shame" a
dozen years later — has ever
equalled. The knight's chess game
with Death is surely one of the key
images in world cinema, and the se
quence involving the burning of the
young witch suggests that Bergman

may have been inspired by Dreyer's
"Day of Wrath." With Max von
Sydow as the knight, Bengt Ekerot
as Death, Maud Hansson as the
witch, Bibi Andersson, Gunnar
Bjornstrand and Nils Poppe.
Plays Thursday with "The
Magician."
Gone with the Wind (1939)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
David O. Selznick's biggest
movie, written mostly by Ben Hecht
(though Sidney Howard got the
credit and the posthumous Oscar)
and directed by Victor Fleming
(though George Cukor started it).
"Big" is not the same as "great,"
but this four-hour adaptation of the
Margaret Mitchell bestseller is
hugely entertaining, especially when
Clarke Gable or Butterfly McQueen
is on the screen. And it does have
one performance that could be
called great: Vivien Leigh's
portrayal of Scarlett O'Hara. With
Leslie Howard, Olivia De Havil
land, Thomas Mitchell, Hattie
McDaniel and many others.
Plays this Sunday.
Rashomon (1950)
U.C. Theatre, Berkeley
"Often men won't speak the truth
even to themselves," says one of the
characters in Akira Kurosawa's un
forgettable film, and — adapting a
story by Akugatawa — the director
sets out to prove that the truth is un
discoverable. The plot is devilishly
simple: a bandit (Toshiro Mifune)
robs a noble (Masayuki Mori) in the
forest and rapes his wife (Machiko
Kyo); the noble dies — at the ban
dit's hands or at his own. Kurosawa
plays the story four times, communi
cating the perception of each of the
major characters and that of a
woodcutter (Takasi Shimura) who
claims to have witnessed the entire
episode. Machiko Kyo, later the
Lady Macbeth of Kurosawa's
"Throne of Blood," gives a

remarkably versatile performance.
Plays Thursday with "Hidden
Fortress."
Kiss of the Spider Woman (1985)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Director Hector Babenco's
adaptation of Manuel Puig's 1976
novel works on the audience in dis
appointingly obvious ways. Both
movie and book are set in a prison
cell in an unnamed South American
country, where Valentin, a Marxist
revolutionary, is beaten and ques
tioned regularly by the guards. He's
cared for by his cellmate Molina — a
homosexual imprisoned for corrupt
ing a minor — who attempts to en
tertain Valentin and himself with an
elaborate telling of a romantic
1940s Nazi propoganda film. The
novel is about fantasy and escapism,
and the loving/manipulative rela
tionship of Molina and Valentin, but
the movie gives the material an
artsy-sentimental gloss that flattens
the characters and the book's
meanings. Hurt is wonderful in his
role, though Molina's flighty roman
ticism is not quite within his range.
Piays this week.
Chan is Missing (1982)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The camera is always in the wrong
place, the sound recording is occa
sionally opaque, the editing is hap
hazard, and the lighting is so poor
that in some shots sunlight stream
ing through a window whites out the
actors. Is it a virtue to make a movie
this badly on less than $20,000?
Wayne Wang's thriller is a lot like
the puzzle pictures Antonioni and
others released in the '60s, but it's
played in an improvised style that
fails miserably because the actors
aren't good enough (except for
Marc Hayashi) and Wang doesn't
know how to keep their energy
going.
Plays Monday and Tuesday with
" Dim Sum."

Agnes of God (1985)
Memorial Auditorium
John Pielmeier adapted his own
play for the screen, and Norman
Jewison directed with taste and tact,
but this psychodrama mystery thril
ler is utter tripe that strains for sig
nificance. Pielmeier's three
character study is a hand-to-hand
combat between the forces of belief
(represented by Anne Bancroft as a
Mother Superior) and the forces of
atheism (Jane Fonda, as a court psy
chiatrist) over the soul of Sister
Agnes (Meg Tilly), a young nun who
may or may not have strangled her
own baby at birth. The script springs
its not-very-surprising surprises on
us like clockwork, there's much
tedious prattling about religious vs.
secular issues, and Bancroft and
(especially) Fonda give such awful,
preening "great actresses" perfor
mances that they override even the
movie's incidental pleasures. Still,
Tilly is funny and engaging in her
role, and Sven Nykvist's cinematog
raphy has a beautiful hyper-intense
clarity.
Plays Sunday night.
The Seventh Seal (1956)
New Yarsity, Palo Alto
With this medieval puzzle-drama,
Ingmar Bergman rose to heights
that none of his subsequent "dark"
movies — except for "Shame" a
dozen years later — has ever
equalled. The knight's chess game
with Death is surely one of the key
images in world cinema, and the se
quence involving the burning of the
young witch suggests that Bergman

may have been inspired by Dreyer's
"Day of Wrath." With Max von
Sydow as the knight, Bengt Ekerot
as Death, Maud Hansson as the
witch, Bibi Andersson, Gunnar
Bjornstrand and Nils Poppe.
Plays Thursday with "The
Magician."
Gone with the Wind (1939)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
David O. Selznick's biggest
movie, written mostly by Ben Hecht
(though Sidney Howard got the
credit and the posthumous Oscar)
and directed by Victor Fleming
(though George Cukor started it).
"Big" is not the same as "great,"
but this four-hour adaptation of the
Margaret Mitchell bestseller is
hugely entertaining, especially when
Clarke Gable or Butterfly McQueen
is on the screen. And it does have
one performance that could be
called great: Vivien Leigh's
portrayal of Scarlett O'Hara. With
Leslie Howard, Olivia De Havil
land, Thomas Mitchell, Hattie
McDaniel and many others.
Plays this Sunday.
Rashomon (1950)
U.C. Theatre, Berkeley
"Often men won't speak the truth
even to themselves," says one of the
characters in Akira Kurosawa's un
forgettable film, and — adapting a
story by Akugatawa — the director
sets out to prove that the truth is un
discoverable. The plot is devilishly
simple: a bandit (Toshiro Mifune)
robs a noble (Masayuki Mori) in the
forest and rapes his wife (Machiko
Kyo); the noble dies — at the ban
dit's hands or at his own. Kurosawa
plays the story four times, communi
cating the perception of each of the
major characters and that of a
woodcutter (Takasi Shimura) who
claims to have witnessed the entire
episode. Machiko Kyo, later the
Lady Macbeth of Kurosawa's
"Throne of Blood," gives a

remarkably versatile performance.
Plays Thursday with "Hidden
Fortress."
Kiss of the Spider Woman (1985)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Director Hector Babenco's
adaptation of Manuel Puig's 1976
novel works on the audience in dis
appointingly obvious ways. Both
movie and book are set in a prison
cell in an unnamed South American
country, where Valentin, a Marxist
revolutionary, is beaten and ques
tioned regularly by the guards. He's
cared for by his cellmate Molina — a
homosexual imprisoned for corrupt
ing a minor — who attempts to en
tertain Valentin and himself with an
elaborate telling of a romantic
1940s Nazi propoganda film. The
novel is about fantasy and escapism,
and the loving/manipulative rela
tionship of Molina and Valentin, but
the movie gives the material an
artsy-sentimental gloss that flattens
the characters and the book's
meanings. Hurt is wonderful in his
role, though Molina's flighty roman
ticism is not quite within his range.
Piays this week.
Chan is Missing (1982)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The camera is always in the wrong
place, the sound recording is occa
sionally opaque, the editing is hap
hazard, and the lighting is so poor
that in some shots sunlight stream
ing through a window whites out the
actors. Is it a virtue to make a movie
this badly on less than $20,000?
Wayne Wang's thriller is a lot like
the puzzle pictures Antonioni and
others released in the '60s, but it's
played in an improvised style that
fails miserably because the actors
aren't good enough (except for
Marc Hayashi) and Wang doesn't
know how to keep their energy
going.
Plays Monday and Tuesday with
" Dim Sum."

Othello (1965)
Camera One, San Jose
Laurence Olivier altered his walk
and lowered his voice an octave to
play Shakespeare's Moor of Venice
for England's National Theatre in
the early 19605; this transformation
could serve as a metaphor for the
magic of great acting. Stuart Burge's
screen version is just a filmed play,
but it preserves what may be the
most sublime performance by the
greatest actor of our time. On every
level — physical, vocal, imaginative
and emotional — Olivier matches
extraordinary daring with a level of
accomplishment that seems almost
supernatural. No one else would
think of attempting an epileptic fit
the way he does, or the romantic
flourish with which he dabs lago's
cheeks with a rose after returning
from Desdemona's chamber; and no
one else could possibly bring off
these scenes. Olivier is the Mich
elangelo of actors, expanding the
realm of what art — and man — can
ascend to. The once-in-a-lifetime
cast include Frank Finlay (a chilling
Iago), Maggie Smith (a spirited Des
demona), Derek Jacobi (Roderigo)
and Joyce Redman (Emilia).
Plays Thursday.
Dragonslayer (1981)
U.C. Theatre, Berkeley
This fantasy adventure set in sixth
century Britain offers the pleasures
of Ralph Richardson perfectly cast
as a wily sorceror, beautiful
cinematography by Derek Vanlint
and a fine score by Alex North But
the real star of the picture is the
monstrous fire-breathing dragon
cooked up by Brian Johnson and his
special effects team; their hellishly
beautiful beast looks so compelling
and fascinating that it makes the
picture take hold in the imagination.
Director/co-writer Matthew Rob
bins and producer/co-writer Hal
Barwood have fashioned the movie
with integrity and style, and they
create some great mythic moments,

including the final battle between
the dragon and Richardson, and a
shot of the dragon's spawn munch
ing on a human body. Robbins
coaxes skilled performances from
Peter MacNicol (as the sorceror's
apprentice), Caitlin Clarke and
Chloe Salaman.
Plays Tuesday with "Return to
