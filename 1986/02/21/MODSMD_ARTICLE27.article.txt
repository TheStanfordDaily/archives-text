## Cardinal hoops lives and dies in L.A. Clutch foul shots keep Trojans at bay, men in Pac-10 race 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — Stanford guard John Paye hit a pair
of free throws with nine seconds remaining to clinch a 61-
59 victory over USC in front of 4,917 spectators at the
Los Angeles Sports Arena last night.
With the victory, Stanford moves into a tie for third
place in the Pacific 10 Conference with UCLA, California
and Oregon State at 7-6, 13-12 overall. USC falls to 3-10,
9-14 overall.
Stanford's lead had been cut to 59-57 when USC's Rich
Grande banked in a 12-foot lean-in jumper with 13
seconds left. Tom Lewis then fouled Paye and put him on
the line for the one-and-one.
Paye had gone into the game shooting 44 percent from
the line this season, but Stanford Coach Tom Davis didn't
look to pull him out in the late going.
"As a coach, you don't go by the stats, you go by who's
a pressure player, and John Paye is that kind of player,"
Davis said.
!" He set a record for consecutive free throws in practice
—{ I think it was 137 — so his free throw stroke is back."
USC Coach Stan Morrison didn't realize that. He told
his team to look to foul Paye. "Somebody told me he was
a 37 percent free throw shooter, but he was 100 percent
tonight," Morrison said.
So Paye was at the line. Having grown up a Golden
State Warriors fan, he modelled his foul shot on Rick
Barry's — underhand. He had tried to change it when he
came to Stanford, but went back midway through this
season.
!"I knew I had done everything I could to prepare,"
Paye said, "but 1 was lucky to get the first one down — my
legs were shaking a little."
Paye had hit clutch free throws here before — his two
fr£e throws in the state high school final had given the
Menlo School the CIF Division II Title three years ago.
iPaye's clinching free throws were not the only clutch
shots for the Cardinal. Keith Ramee, Novian Whitsitt and
Paye had all converted both ends of one-and-ones to
keep the Trojans from coming any closer than two points.
M We got the roll at the end," Davis said. "We made our
free throws, we made our shots, and we got the rebounds
dqwn the stretch. If we don't, it could go the other way."

After being humbled by California on Saturday before a national television audience, Stanford bounced
back to defeat USC 61-59 on the road last night. "We knew we had to win this game if we had any chance
for a tournament," said Todd Lichti, who led the Cardinal with 15 points.
