# It's Bronc-busting time
## Stanford baseball to meet Santa Clara 
### CHRIS MYERS Staff writer 
There will be joy in Mudville
again.
Weather permitting, the joyful
sounds of cracking bats and thud
ding gloves will return to Sunken
Diamond this weekend, as the
ninth-ranked Stanford baseball
team plays host to the Santa Clara
Broncos tomorrow and Sunday.
And if the sun stays out, the se
ries will continue on Monday, with
Stanford taking the team raft to
Santa Clara.
Tomorrow's game was originally
scheduled to be played at Santa
Clara, but the Broncos' recently
resodded Buck Shaw Stadium
needs more time to dry out after
the monsoons of the past week. The
excellent drainage at Sunken Dia
mond, meanwhile, has made the
Cardinal's field playable now.
Stanford last played on Sunday at
the University of Hawaii, losing to
the No. 21 Rainbows after grabbing
the first two games of the three
game series. The Cardinal brings a
season record of nine wins and
three losses into this weekend.

/According to Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess, his club has been
unable to hold a full practice all
week but was able to do some hit
ting in the batting cages. Batting
continues to be an area that needs
improvement, Marquess said.
Although the team boasts a mar
velous .292 season batting average,
that includes last week's 34-hit out
burst against woeful Cal State-
Stanislaus. The Cardinal batters
have yet to generate any real power
at the plate: their 126 hits for the
season include only six home runs
and two triples.
Leftfielder Walt Harris and
catcher John Ramos continue to
lead the Stanford batters, toting
.378 and .311 season averages,
respectively. Harris' 13 steals in 14
attempts also lead the team, fol
lowed closely by rightfielder Toi
Cook's 11 thefts.
Marquess listed three possible
starting pitchers for this weekend's
games. He will choose from sopho
more righthander Jack McDowell
(3-1 on the season, with a 2.51
ERA), junior southpaw A 1 Osuna
(3-0, 3.98) and freshman righty
Steve Chitren (1-1, 2.03).
With Pacific 10 Southern Division

games beginning next week,
Marquess will continue to tinker
with his lineup in hopes of solidify
ing the starting nine before the on
set of league play. During the
course of the weekend, Marquess
expects to try out Frank Carey at
shortstop, Ed Sprague at third and
Doug Robbins at first.
"We'd like to get more of a set
lineup, especially in the infield,"
Marquess said.
Marquess certainly can't have
any worries about his outfield,
where Harris in left. Cook in right
and Mark Davis in center have
been rock-solid all season, starting
every game as a unit and commit
ting nary an error between them.
Santa Clara comes to Sunken
Diamond with a 3-3 season record.
Probable starters for the WCAC
Broncos are righthanders John
Savage (0-1, 6.55) and Scott
Chiamparino (0-0, 6.00). The
Broncos' best batsmen are
rightfielder Ray Williamson, carry
ing a hefty .375 batting average
into the series, and centerfielder
Todd Gates, batting .347.
Tomorrow's game is scheduled
for 2 p.m.. with Sunday's slated for
a 1 p.m. start.

Stanford Coach Mark Marquess has had a lot of time to think about his team's prospects for the up
coming conference season during the Cardinal's recent string of rainouts. Marquess' main concerns are
finding more stability in the infield and generating more power: only six of Stanford's 126 hits have
been homers.
