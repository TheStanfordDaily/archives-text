## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES— It was "Cheryl Millei Night" yes
terday at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. USC chose the
evening to honor the woman who has been acclaimed as
the finest female to ever play the game.
Before her number was retired, Miller had one last
chance to face the Stanford women's basketball team.
And she didn't disappoint the Trojan fans, scoring 36
points and pulling down 22 rebounds as USC ran its
record to 23-3 with an 88-62 victory over the Cardinal.
The loss was the eighth straight for Stanford, which fell
to 0-5 in the Pac-West Conference, 11-13 overall. USC,
at 7-0, has clinched the conference title.
"You're not gonna stop her," Stanford Coach Tara
VanDerveer said of Miller. "I asked Howard Wright at
breakfast if he'd suit up for us, but he said he had to save
himself for the men's game and that he didn't want to play
against Cheryl.
"Who on our team — who on anyone's team — is going
to stop her?" VanDerveer continued. "The only kid I can
think of is a kid from Cleveland I left back at Ohio State,
Tracey Hall, and Cheryl scored 28 against her."
The game certainly didn't look at first like it would be a
walkover for the Trojans. Stanford opened an early 12-8
lead behind the torrid shooting of center Jill Yanke. The
6-foot-5 freshman scored 10 points in the first 4 1/2
minutes and finished with a team-high 23 points and 10
rebounds.
"(Trojan center) Cherie (Nelson) started a little slow
defensively against her," USC Coach Linda Sharp said.
"In the second half, we tried to keep Cherie and (backup
center) Jamaiia (Bond) keying on her."
"I think Jill kept us in the game for the first 10
minutes," VanDerveer said. "I think she is someone that
someone else is going to have to stop for the next three
years."
"After I made that first shot, I just decided to give it all
I had," Yanke said. "In the last game I was scoring over
Miller. My coach said I wasn't intimidated. I figured this
game I'd just give it all I had."
The Cardinal's early lead was short-lived, though. USC
tied it at 12-all on a 15-foot jumper by Miller with 14:32
left in the first half. The Trojans never looked back.
Stanford narrowed it to 28-22
seven minutes later on Kami Ander
son's 18-foot baseline jumper. But
after a timeout, the Trojans went on a
21-9 run and led 48-31 at the half.
USC had a 37-point lead with
12:30 left, and both teams let their
reserves mop up, though Miller did
return for an encore.
Yanke's 1 l-of-20 shooting perfor
mance paced Stanford. Anderson
added nine points and Kim Mercer
and Andrea Ransom each had eight.
Following Miller in the Trojan
scoring column were Nelson with 17
anH Pvnthia Cooper with 15.

The Cardinal's loss of leading
rebounder Evon Asforis was appar
ent, as USC outrebounded Stanford
51-35.
The victory was USC's 10th
straight over Stanford. The Cardinal
won the initial meeting between the
teams in 1979.
Stanford faces UCLA tomorrow
night at 7:30 in Pauley Pavilion. The
Bruins are 2-4 in the Pac-West, 10-
14 overall. Stanford has never beaten
UCLA in 12 tries.
In their first meeting this year at
Maples Pavilion, Stanford cut a 19-
point deficit at halftime to one late in
the game, but wound up on the short
end of a 65-62 score.
