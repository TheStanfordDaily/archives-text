# Fac Sen discusses new comp sci major
## 
### RICK KUWAYTI Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate yesterday unanimously
approved a proposal to authorize an undergrad
uate major in computer science.
In its regular meeting at the law school, the
senate also heard a report by University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy on proposed changes in
research cost recovery that he said could cost
Stanford $1.5 million this year and as much as
$10 million by 1988-89.
The computer science major was brought for
approval before the senate after a unanimous
recommendation for its establishment last
month by the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies. The proposed major received positive
endorsement from both the Department of
Computer Science and the School of Engineer
ing. Yesterday's senate vote made the major of
ficial.
Enrollments for the computer science major
will be accepted this morning, Computer Sci
ence Prof. Jeffrey Ullman said. Ullman, who
chaired the committee that formulated the cur
riculum for the major, said there are nine
seniors and 18 juniors who are already planning
to enroll. According to Ullman, it is possible
that Stanford seniors could graduate this June
with a bachelor of science degree in computer
science.
"We would have to work on their programs
on an individual basis," Ullman said, adding,
"It's not like there is new material that has
never been taught ... it's just in the packag
ing."
Ullman said universities offering a major in
computer science usually find that 6 percent of
undergraduates choose it. "It's hard to predict,
but my guess is that we'll roughly be at the same
level as the electrical engineering major —
graduating around 100 students per year," Ull
man said.
Ullman said the Computer Science Depart
ment will not limit the enrollment for the major,
but admitted that computer resources for a
large number of people might be a problem.
"If the resources are not there, there's noth
ing that we or anyone else can do about it. I'm
really hoping that this is not the case," he said.
"The University is going to have to invest a lot
of money or get equipment donated."

While computer science was the highlight of
yesterday's senate meeting, many senate mem
bers are concerned with proposed changes in re
search cost recovery, which are outlined in Of
fice of Management and Budget (OMB) Circu
lar A-21, "Cost Principles for Educational In
stitutions." The proposal, which has a 30-day
comment period, calls for all federal agencies to
limit federal reimbursement for administrative
costs to 26 percent by April 1. The limit would
reduce to 20 percent by April 1, 1987. The pro
posal does permit the agencies to allow for a
one year delay in implementation.
"That figure, 26 percent, didn't quite come
out of the sky, it is said to be based on the
average rate for higher education as a whole,"
Kennedy said. "We think there's good reason to
believe that they have selected the wrong num
ber . . . that the actual average is higher than
that."
Kennedy added that if Stanford cannot obtain
a delay and if research volume continues to
grow at the projected rate, the budgetary im
pact would be $ 1.5 million this year and would
grow to $10 million annually by 1988-89.
"That is a significant number. It is a number
which would produce, I think, a very dramatic
impact on our operating budget,"he said.
Kennedy reported that the Association of
American Universities (AAU), which has
developed a task force on the situation, will give
Stanford and other institutions the opportunity
to deal with the long-range aspects of the prob
lem. "In essence, we will argue that a full re
evaluation of A-21 be undertaken," said Ken
nedy, adding that the proposal's 30-day com
ment period violates the intent of Congress.
Kennedy also commented on a statement
written by a group of students and introduced
by ASSU Graduate Sen. Eric Berg calling for an
all-day forum on racism next week in light of
what they call racist events, such as the destruc
tion of the shantytown in White Plaza, which
they say in the past few months have increased
with alarming frequency.
"I am disturbed by these incidents, but I do
not believe that they constitute a sudden and
dramatic increase of such incidents," said Ken
nedy. adding that he would offer "to work with
these students to create a well-planned and
thoughtful, I hope, series of discussions on this
matter."

with a bachelor of science degree in computer
science.
"We would have to work on their programs
on an individual basis," Ullman said, adding,
"It's not like there is new material that has
never been taught ... it's just in the packag
ing."
Ullman said universities offering a major in
computer science usually find that 6 percent of
undergraduates choose it. "It's hard to predict,
but my guess is that we'll roughly be at the same
level as the electrical engineering major —
graduating around 100 students per year," Ull
man said.
Ullman said the Computer Science Depart
ment will not limit the enrollment for the major,
but admitted that computer resources for a
large number of people might be a problem.
"If the resources are not there, there's noth
ing that we or anyone else can do about it. I'm
really hoping that this is not the case," he said.
"The University is going to have to invest a lot
of money or get equipment donated."

While computer science was the highlight of
yesterday's senate meeting, many senate mem
bers are concerned with proposed changes in re
search cost recovery, which are outlined in Of
fice of Management and Budget (OMB) Circu
lar A-21, "Cost Principles for Educational In
stitutions." The proposal, which has a 30-day
comment period, calls for all federal agencies to
limit federal reimbursement for administrative
costs to 26 percent by April 1. The limit would
reduce to 20 percent by April 1, 1987. The pro
posal does permit the agencies to allow for a
one year delay in implementation.
"That figure, 26 percent, didn't quite come
out of the sky, it is said to be based on the
average rate for higher education as a whole,"
Kennedy said. "We think there's good reason to
believe that they have selected the wrong num
ber . . . that the actual average is higher than
that."
Kennedy added that if Stanford cannot obtain
a delay and if research volume continues to
grow at the projected rate, the budgetary im
pact would be $ 1.5 million this year and would
grow to $10 million annually by 1988-89.
"That is a significant number. It is a number
which would produce, I think, a very dramatic
impact on our operating budget,"he said.
Kennedy reported that the Association of
American Universities (AAU), which has
developed a task force on the situation, will give
Stanford and other institutions the opportunity
to deal with the long-range aspects of the prob
lem. "In essence, we will argue that a full re
evaluation of A-21 be undertaken," said Ken
nedy, adding that the proposal's 30-day com
ment period violates the intent of Congress.
Kennedy also commented on a statement
written by a group of students and introduced
by ASSU Graduate Sen. Eric Berg calling for an
all-day forum on racism next week in light of
what they call racist events, such as the destruc
tion of the shantytown in White Plaza, which
they say in the past few months have increased
with alarming frequency.
"I am disturbed by these incidents, but I do
not believe that they constitute a sudden and
dramatic increase of such incidents," said Ken
nedy. adding that he would offer "to work with
these students to create a well-planned and
thoughtful, I hope, series of discussions on this
matter."
