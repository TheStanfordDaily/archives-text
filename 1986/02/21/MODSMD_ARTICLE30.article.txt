# In every way, it was Cheryl Miller's night

LOS ANGELES â€” Last night at
the Los Angeles Sports Arena was
just another game for USC forward
Cheryl Miller. First she went out and
scored 36 points in an 88-62 win over
Stanford, and then she had her num
ber (31) retired during halftime of the
men's game.
Miller, a three-time Ail-American
and two-time Naismith Award win
ner, led the Trojans to two NCAA
Championships, and the United
States to a gold medal during the
1984 Olympics. The senior is averag
ing 26.1 points and 11.9 rebounds per
game.
Against the Cardinal, Miller pulled
down 22 rebounds to go along with
her 36 points. Both were just shy of
season-high marks. She also managed
five steals on the night, along with a
stunning no-look, behind-the-back
pass to Kalen Wright, who subse
quently missed the shot.
"Cheryl played a very good game
tonight. She is a gamer," USC Coach
Linda Sharp said. Considering Miller
is still recovering from the flu and a
severe concussion suffered a few
eeeks ago, that's something of an un
derstatement.
"I played well tonight," Miller said.
"I had a good first half and played

For anyone who was wondering before the game why Cheryl Miller's
number was going to be retired after the game, the USC player's
typically-brilliant 36-point, 22-rebound, five-steal performance last
night against Stanford probably erased any doubts.
