# In every way, it was Cheryl Miller's night
## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — Last night at
the Los Angeles Sports Arena was
just another game for USC forward
Cheryl Miller. First she went out and
scored 36 points in an 88-62 win over
Stanford, and then she had her num
ber (31) retired during halftime of the
men's game.
Miller, a three-time Ail-American
and two-time Naismith Award win
ner, led the Trojans to two NCAA
Championships, and the United
States to a gold medal during the
1984 Olympics. The senior is averag
ing 26.1 points and 11.9 rebounds per
game.
Against the Cardinal, Miller pulled
down 22 rebounds to go along with
her 36 points. Both were just shy of
season-high marks. She also managed
five steals on the night, along with a
stunning no-look, behind-the-back
pass to Kalen Wright, who subse
quently missed the shot.
"Cheryl played a very good game
tonight. She is a gamer," USC Coach
Linda Sharp said. Considering Miller
is still recovering from the flu and a
severe concussion suffered a few
eeeks ago, that's something of an un
derstatement.
"I played well tonight," Miller said.
"I had a good first half and played

For anyone who was wondering before the game why Cheryl Miller's
number was going to be retired after the game, the USC player's
typically-brilliant 36-point, 22-rebound, five-steal performance last

hard." -
"No one has the manpower to stop
her," Stanford Coach Tara VanDer
veer said. "She's phenomenal; she
can do everything out there."
The Cardinal's Kim Mercer agreed.
"She's an incredible athlete. It's a
challenge to try and stop her," Mer
cer said. "If you can stop her, you can
stop anybody."
The halftime ceremony featured
former Pittsburgh Steeler receiver
Lynn Swann, a USC football stan
dout, as master of ceremonies, and

former USC All-American and gold
medalist Pam McGee. Also present
were Miller's mother, brother Darryl
and sister Tammy. Her father was
across town watching younger
brother Reggie play for UCLA in a
76-63 win over California.
A congratulatory letter from Presi
dent Reagan was also read to the
crowd.
"This young woman has con
tribured a great deal to this university
and women's basketball across the
country," Swann said.
McGee echoed those sentiments
when she said, "I was happy to get an
oppo'- t "" i "fv to play with her. She is

the best player ever in the game of
women's basketball."
Miller first thanked God for her
talent, then her family, coaches,
teammates and the USC student body
for their support. "It's nice," Miller
said after the game. "I'm honored the
university thinks so highly of me. My
number was retired in high school,
but this is different."
"I think it's great, a dream come
true," Sharp said. "USC has never
retired a number in basketball before.
I wore the same number (at Fullerton
State) and I always wanted someone
to wear it. She's the player of the '80s
and the greatest in the game."

"She's a tribute to the game," Mer
cer said. "She brings up the level of
play and makes the others work
harder to realize their potential."
"She's a phenomenal player,"
VanDerveer added. "No doubt about
it. The best in the country. Miller
deserves all the recognition she can
get. It reflects poorly on women's
basketball than her cemerony has to
take place during halftime of a men's
game."
"I'm just looking ahead," said Mil
ler, USC's all-time leader scorer.
"I'm ready for Long Beach State on
Saturday. I'm definitely looking for
ward to playing them."
