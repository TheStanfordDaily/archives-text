Sometimes it's no fun being number one. Cardinal
senior Dan Goldie was taught that lesson in a big way yes
terday afternoon by a Harvard youngster named Larry
Scott.
Goldie took over the top spot in the Intercollegiate
Tennis Coaches Association poll just a few days ago, but
that fact obviously did not faze Scott.
The Crimson s top player soundly defeated Goldie 6-1,
6-4, but the Stanford team held on to narrowly defeat
Harvard by a score of 5-4 in the first round of the
USTA/ITCA National Intercollegiate Tenhis Champion
ship in Louisville, Ken.
The two teams fought to a draw in singles play with
each squad winning three matches. Eric Rosenfeld,
Patrick McEnroe and Scott Moody won the No. 2. No. 4
and No. 5 singles, respectively, for the Cardinal. On the
other side of the nets, Scott, Bill Stanley and Paul
Palandjian won the No. 1, No. 3 and No. 6 singles for the
Crimson.

In the doubles matches, Rosenfeld and Moody contin
ued their winning ways by whisking the No. 3 match away
from Harvard's Palandjian and Stanley 6-3, 6-0.
Stanford finally clinched the match in the No. 2
doubles. Letts and McEnroe outlasted Peter Palandjian
and Darryl Laddin 6-1, 1-6, 6-3 to advance the Cardinal
into the second round.
In the No. I doubles match. Harvard's Scott and Engle
were defeating Goldie and Jim Grabb 7-6, 2-0 when the
Cardinal duo retired because Stanford had clinched the
match.
Stanford next plays the fifth-seeded Pepperdine Waves
at 8 p.m. (EST) today. The Waves defeated BYU yester
day by a 7-1 score.
In other matches yesterday, California upset seventh
seeded LSU 5-2, Texas defeated South Carolina 5-2,
Clemson beat Arkansas 6-3 and second-seeded Southern
Methodist trounced Minnesota 8-1.
If Stanford wins tomorrow, the team will play either
Texas or the winner of last night's USC-Miami match to
morrow night. The championship match will be on Sunday
at 11 a.m.
