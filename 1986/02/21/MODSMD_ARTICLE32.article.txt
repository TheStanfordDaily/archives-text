# Women netters open conference schedule

### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
Stanford's highly regarded freshmen Eleni
Rossides and Marianne Werdel will get their
first dose of collegiate pressure today at 1:30
p.m. as the No. 1 Cardinal women's tennis team
travels to Arizona State's Whiteman Tennis
Center for its Pacific West Conference opener
against the No. 13 Sun Devils.
Tomorrow, the Cardinal moves on to Tucson
to battle No. 17 Arizona in another conference
match.
Werdel and Rossides — ranked ninth and
11th respectively in singles — have vast exper
ience against national and international compe
tition. Both, however, will be surprised by the
antics of the college crowds, according to Stan
ford Coach Frank Brennan.
"I think it will be a little shocking to them,"
Brennan said, noting that the crowds at Arizona
are notorious for making life difficult for visiting
teams.
"In college tennis, they (crowds) are a lot
more vocal," Brennan added. "Not that they'll
cheer double faults, but they almost will. It's a
lot more personal than in juniors."
As well as being interested in how his
talented freshmen will perform, Brennan is also
concerned about how his team as a will fare
after losing practice time to the rain this week.

"One of the questions is how prepared we are,"
he said.
Brennan indicated the Cardinal was not able
to practice until Tuesday, when the team gath
ered from 10 p.m. until midnight at some indoor
courts in Los Gatos. The skies cleared up
enough Wednesday for the Cardinal to get in an
hour of practice on the outdoor courts.
This weekend's matches not only mark the
beginning of conference competition, but they
represent the Cardinal's first look at top 20
competition. "The real season starts now,"
Brennan said. "I'm glad we're taking our full
lineup. I'm glad we're healthy."
Stanford's Patty Fendick, playing No. 1 on
the Cardinal ladder, will draw two-time Ail-
American Sheri Norris in today's match with
ASU. An indication of Norris' talent is the 3-1
record she has compiled over the past two
years against Linda Gates, a senior here last
year and the 1985 NCAA singles and doubles
champion.
Last weekend at the Arizona Invitational in
Tucson, the Sun Devils crushed the host
Wildcats 9-0. "That was kind of a surprise,"
Brennan said. "I figured they (Arizona) were a
little stronger."
Despite the overwhelming loss at the hands of
ASU, Arizona will not fall effortlessly to the
Cardinal, according to Brennan "They are a
very gritty team," he said.
