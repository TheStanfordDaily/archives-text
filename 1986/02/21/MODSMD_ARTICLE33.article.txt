men sport an overall record of 13-1, while the
women carry a 13-0 mark.
Their matchup against Cal will be their final com
petition before the NCAA Western Regionals. "We
defeated them pretty resoundingly in our last
encounter on the eve of Big Game, Stanford
Coach Buzz Hurst said. "1 expect that they 11 have
gotten considerably better, but then so have we.
According to Hurst, "The team should be at full
strength for this meet. Jennifer Yu (women's foil
captain), Elliott Cheu (men's foil captain) and
Andy Goorno (sabre captain) should be at top
form," he said. "1 don't expect any problems." The
Cardinal fencers feel confident of a win against
Berkeley. "They're not easy, but we should beat
them," sabreman Steve Levitan said.
"This meet should be a good warmup for the
Westerns," epeeist Vince Bradshaw added.
