# Volleyball medalists invade Farm
## U.S. national teams play at Maples; Stanford visits Chico 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
Maples Pavilion will be the site of some first
class international volleyball tonight, as both the
U.S. men's and women's national teams will be in
action.
The U.S. men's team will take on the national
team from Cuba, while the U.S. women face a
strong Canadian national team.
The occasion is the Sun Country Cooler Interna
tional Volleyball Challenge. The women's teams
will get things under way at 6 p.m., and the men
will follow at 8 p.m.
Seven members of the surprising 1984 Olympic
gold medal-winning men's team remain on the
squad, which won the World Cup in 1985 without
losing a match. The U.S. team dethroned the
defending champion Soviet Union to capture the
World Cup title.
The Most Valuable Player of the World Cup
tournament was Ranch Kiraly, who currently cap
tains the U.S. team and is a finalist for the coveted
Sullivan Award, given each year to the top amateur
athlete in the nation. He is often called "the best
player on the world's best team."
"He's a real good all-around player," U.S. Na
tional Team Coach Marv Dunphy said of Kiraly.
"He's a real good athlete.
Kiraly and Dunphy are respectful of the Cubans,
whom the United States has beaten in the first
three matches of the tour.

"When we play Cuba, there are a lot of attempts
at intimidation and a lot of screaming under the
net We're looking forward to a fierce, competitive
series," Kiraly said.
"It's a very emotional, high-jumping, powerful
volleyball team," Dunphy said of the Cubans.
Dunphy is in his second year as men's national
coach and is coming off an outstanding 1985
season, leading the squad to 49 wins in 55 games,
an amazing record for a first year coach. In 1985,
Dunphy coached Pepperdine to a 25-2 mark and
the NCAA men's volleyball title.
Dunphy said there are "lots of differences" be
tween college and international volleyball. "It's an
other step up in every aspect — physical, technical,
psychological," he asid.
With the 1984 Olympic gold medal and the 1985
World Cup taken care of, the U.S. men's team is
now aiming for the 1986 World Championships in
France this summer. That will give them a chance
to sweep international volleyball's Big Three. So
far, the Soviets have been the only team to com
plete the historic triple crown.
"This is kind of like preliminaries," middle
blocker and Olympic gold medalist Craig Buck said
of the U.S.-Cuba series. "To prepare for a tourna
ment you have to play a certain number of matches
each year. We play about 60 matches a year."
The U.S. women's national team has been un
dergoing a transition process since winning the sil
ver medal in the 1984 Olympics. Under new coach
Terry Liskevych (formerly of the University of the
Pacific), the quickly-assembled squad posted a 25-

20 record last year after a 2-10 start.
The U.S. women also won the Taurus Cup in
Hungary and defeated 1984 bronze medalist Japan
four times. They were 2-0 against Canada last year.
The women are also gearing up for the World
Championships, which will be held in Czechoslo
vakia.
"We're anxious to open our season," Liskevych
said. "We've worked hard on putting some new
things in our offense and it will be interesting to see
how well we can work together before our trip
abroad."
Three top collegians have joined the U.S. women
since the start of the year — UCLA's Liz
Masakayan, Arizona's Melissa McLinden and
Colorado State's Sherry Danielson. All three
names may sound familiar to Stanford crowds as
each has played at Maples in the last year.
Tickets for this special event are $12 reserved
loge, $9 reserved courtside and $7 general admis
sion. There is a $2 discount for Stanford students,
faculty and staff.
The Stanford men's volleyball team swings back
into action tomorrow night, when it travels to
Chico State at 7:30 for a non-conference match.
The Cardinal, ranked No. 4 in the latest Tachikara-
Coaches national poll, has a 6-3 overall record and
is 5-3 in the California Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association.
Stanford defeated Chico 15-4, 15-6, 13-15, 15-6
earlier this season. The team will be back at home
against No. 2 UCLA next Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.

The U.S. women also won the Taurus Cup in
Hungary and defeated 1984 bronze medalist Japan
four times. They were 2-0 against Canada last year.
The women are also gearing up for the World
Championships, which will be held in Czechoslo
vakia.
"We're anxious to open our season," Liskevych
said. "We've worked hard on putting some new
things in our offense and it will be interesting to see
how well we can work together before our trip
abroad."
Three top collegians have joined the U.S. women
since the start of the year — UCLA's Liz
Masakayan, Arizona's Melissa McLinden and
Colorado State's Sherry Danielson. All three
names may sound familiar to Stanford crowds as
each has played at Maples in the last year.
Tickets for this special event are $12 reserved
loge, $9 reserved courtside and $7 general admis
sion. There is a $2 discount for Stanford students,
faculty and staff.
The Stanford men's volleyball team swings back
into action tomorrow night, when it travels to
Chico State at 7:30 for a non-conference match.
The Cardinal, ranked No. 4 in the latest Tachikara-
Coaches national poll, has a 6-3 overall record and
is 5-3 in the California Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association.
Stanford defeated Chico 15-4, 15-6, 13-15, 15-6
earlier this season. The team will be back at home
against No. 2 UCLA next Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.
Maples Pavilion will be the site of some first
class international volleyball tonight, as both the
U.S. men's and women's national teams will be in
action.
The U.S. men's team will take on the national
team from Cuba, while the U.S. women face a
strong Canadian national team.
The occasion is the Sun Country Cooler Interna
tional Volleyball Challenge. The women's teams
will get things under way at 6 p.m., and the men
will follow at 8 p.m.
Seven members of the surprising 1984 Olympic
gold medal-winning men's team remain on the
squad, which won the World Cup in 1985 without
losing a match. The U.S. team dethroned the
defending champion Soviet Union to capture the
World Cup title.
The Most Valuable Player of the World Cup
tournament was Ranch Kiraly, who currently cap
tains the U.S. team and is a finalist for the coveted
Sullivan Award, given each year to the top amateur
athlete in the nation. He is often called "the best
player on the world's best team."
"He's a real good all-around player," U.S. Na
tional Team Coach Marv Dunphy said of Kiraly.
"He's a real good athlete.
Kiraly and Dunphy are respectful of the Cubans,
whom the United States has beaten in the first
three matches of the tour.

"When we play Cuba, there are a lot of attempts
at intimidation and a lot of screaming under the
net We're looking forward to a fierce, competitive
series," Kiraly said.
"It's a very emotional, high-jumping, powerful
volleyball team," Dunphy said of the Cubans.
Dunphy is in his second year as men's national
coach and is coming off an outstanding 1985
season, leading the squad to 49 wins in 55 games,
an amazing record for a first year coach. In 1985,
Dunphy coached Pepperdine to a 25-2 mark and
the NCAA men's volleyball title.
Dunphy said there are "lots of differences" be
tween college and international volleyball. "It's an
other step up in every aspect — physical, technical,
psychological," he asid.
With the 1984 Olympic gold medal and the 1985
World Cup taken care of, the U.S. men's team is
now aiming for the 1986 World Championships in
France this summer. That will give them a chance
to sweep international volleyball's Big Three. So
far, the Soviets have been the only team to com
plete the historic triple crown.
"This is kind of like preliminaries," middle
blocker and Olympic gold medalist Craig Buck said
of the U.S.-Cuba series. "To prepare for a tourna
ment you have to play a certain number of matches
each year. We play about 60 matches a year."
The U.S. women's national team has been un
dergoing a transition process since winning the sil
ver medal in the 1984 Olympics. Under new coach
Terry Liskevych (formerly of the University of the
Pacific), the quickly-assembled squad posted a 25-

20 record last year after a 2-10 start.
The U.S. women also won the Taurus Cup in
Hungary and defeated 1984 bronze medalist Japan
four times. They were 2-0 against Canada last year.
The women are also gearing up for the World
Championships, which will be held in Czechoslo
vakia.
