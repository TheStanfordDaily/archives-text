# Gymnasts pushing for NCAA berth

Seeking to improve its perfor
mance, even after last week's
school record score of 181.70, the
Stanford women's gymnastics
team will leave the Bay Area for a
weekend of difficult competition.
Tonight, the Cardinal competes
at Fullerton State in a meet which
will be televised live in Orange
County. Tomorrow, the team goes
to Albuquerque to meet New
Mexico, Arizona and Illinois.
The competition will be rough,
according to Stanford Coach
Homer Sardina. "Fullerton is al
ways tough," he said. "They are
ranked in the top 10, and haven't
finished out of the top 10 in 10
years." He also noted that New
Mexico is strong and Illinois is
"very good as well."
"We want another score in the
180 range," Sardina added. "We
want to improve on the 181.70."
The Cardinal garnered this
score last weekend in Washington,
setting a Stanford record for team
score in an away meet. The team
set the mark despite the absence

of Alison McGann. McGann, last
year's Stanford freshman MVP,
sat out last week's performance
due to illness and probably won't
compete this weekend either.
However, Jinny Rhee will once
again start for the Cardinal. One
of the top freshman gymnasts in
the country, Rhee's outstanding
effort last weekend was a major
factor in the Cardinal's record
setting performance. "Plan on
Jinny in the lineup to do a good
job in the competition," Sardina
said.
Sardina stressed the importance
of a high score this weekend. "We
have a 7-7 win-loss record, but the
team average score is more impor
tant," he said. "We're not looking
at a win and loss season, we're
looking at a high team score."
A score of 181 or better would
probably insure the Cardinal a
spot in the NCAA regionals, ac
cording to Sardina. " A score in the
180s would be a successful
weekend," he said.
Sophomore gymnast Beth Pope
agreed and added, "Each meet is
one step closer to Nationals."
