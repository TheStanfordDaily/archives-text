# Inconsistent Card tries to stop skid at UCLA
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
Just a few weeks ago, the Stan
ford women's basketball team
looked like it was on the verge of a
very promising season.
At the time, the Cardinal sported
an 11-5 record which included nine
wias in its last 11 confrontations.
Optimism was high. People were
speculating about a 20-win season
and a possible berth in the NCAA
Championship tournament.
Eight games later, Stanford is
still looking for victory number 12,
and suddenly, "promising" has
become a word reserved for next
year's team.
Tomorrow night against the
UCLA Bruins, the Cardinal will try
one more time to reach the magic

dozen, as well as win its first league
contest this season. After last
night's loss to the USC Trojans,
Stanford is now 0-5 in the Pac-
West Conference.
The Bruins earned their second
conference victory last week with
a 76-69 victory on the road
against Arizona State. They're 10-
14 overall this year.
UCLA already owns a victory
over the Cardinal this season, a 65-
62 skirmish two weeks ago at
Maples Pavilion.
In that game, Stanford, trailing
63-48 with 3:59 left, made a
remarkable 14-point run to come
within one point before UCLA
guard Jaime Brown hit both ends of
a one-and-one with just seconds
remaining.

Inconsistency, Stanford's
trademark this season, was again
instrumental in that defeat.
The Cardinal played horribly in
the first half, trailing 39-20 at the
intermission. But in the second
half, Stanford played hard and
didn't give up until the final buzzer.
As a result, it almost stole a victory
from the favored Bruins.
The Jekyl-and-Hyde perfor
mance against UCLA has been a
microcosm of Stanford's entire
season. Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer attributes her team's in
consistency to an inexperienced
lineup.
"In my entire coaching career,"
she said, "I've never had to count
on freshmen as much as we've had
to this year."
