# Looking out for No. 1
## Men gymnasts gun for nations top spot 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Last week, while hosting UCLA, the Stanford men's
gymnastics team performed its most difficult routines of
the year. The increased difficulty showed too, as the Card
inal suffered 18 major breaks and its second loss in nine
dual meets.
The squad, though, has now had a week to perfect its
new moves and has added a couple more, as it looks to
produce the nation's top score this weekend and recover
its No. 1 ranking. Stanford is now No. 4 in the nation.
The chances of Stanford fulfilling its goal Sunday night
in the Hobee's Invitational at Maples Pavilion are espe
cially good because the team will be competing tomorrow
evening in San Jose against competition which Stanford
Coach Sadao Hamada feels safe to experiment against.
Hamada plans to keep careful track of who performs
best in which event and then set his lineup accordingly for
Sunday. This, he believes, will lead to a classic Cardinal
meet.
"If everything goes right, I think we can score 280-plus
if the judges are cooperative," Hamada said.
Tomorrow's meet will pit Stanford against San Jose
State and Washington. The Cardinal have already

defeated the Spartans twice this year, and by comfortable
margins.
The outcome of Sunday's meet, meanwhile, is not so
certain. The Stanford Invitational will include California,
Michigan, Georgia, UC-Davis and UC-Santa Barbara, as
well as the Cardinal.
Stanford defeated Cal earlier in the season by a 274.40
to 267.95 score at Berkeley. Davis and Santa Barbara
have shown they will not be a factor. Michigan and Geor
gia, however, are unknowns, according to Hamada.
The last time the Cardinal faced a club of unknown
skill, it was surprised in an upset loss to New Mexico.
From Georgia's scores thus far this season, they appear to
be only a small threat; Michigan, however, is a different
story.
The 12-time Big Ten Champions have two gymnasts,
Mitch Rose and Gavin Meyerowitz, who sport scores
which are better than many of Stanford's top scores on the
rings, high bar and all-around.
Last weekend, Stanford was hurt by the absence of
freshman Scott Schaffer, who is suffering from two badly
sprained ankles, and by the inability of co-captain Mark
Arnold to compete at full throttle due to a muscle strain in
is shoulder. Both will perform tomorrow and Sunday but
not at full strength.
