Joint peace-keeping force planned
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Nicaragua and Costa Rica have an
nounced an initiative that could lead to an international peace-keeping
force to patrol their common border. If the negotiations are successful
such a force could hamstring U.S.-backed counter-revolutionary groups
based in Costa Rica at a time when President Reagan is hoping to boost
the insurgents' activities with $ 100 million of military aid.
On Monday the deputy foreign ministers of the two countries will
meet in Managua with their counterparts from Colombia, Venezuela,
Panama and Mexico, the four nations in the so-called Contadora group,
which is mediating a Central American peace treaty.
In a letter to the Contadora group, the two governments have pledged
themselves to negotiate "the establishment of a permanent vigilance and
inspection force in the common frontier zone." The Nicaraguan deputy
foreign minister, Victor Hugo Tinoco, said he did not know if the force
would be composed of military or civilian personnel, "but such language
usually means troops."
The move comes at a time when regional peace initiatives appeared to
have run into a blank wall of U.S. resistance. Earlier this month the
foreign ministers of the eight Latin American countries involved in the
Contadora group and the support group met Secretary of State George
Shultz to seek his backing for a nine-point document to help pacify the
region.
Together with El Salvador and Honduras, Costa Rica is a member of
the "Tegucigalpa bloc," which has been working closely with Washing
ton to pressure Nicaragua's revolutionary government. However, in the
last few weeks relations between Nicaragua and Costa Rica have
dramatically improved. Diplomatic ties, which had been downgraded,
have now been restored to ambassadorial level.
In other Nicaraguan news, the Reagan Administration released a
recently declassified document which it claimed showed that Nicaragua
was attempting to influence Congressional consideration of the $100
million in aid Reagan has proposed for the contras. Critics on the Senate
Intelligence Committee, however, denounced the Administration's
move as a blatent attempt to politicize intelligence information.
Iraqi jets down Iranian airliner
TEHRAN, Iran — Iraqi warplanes yesterday shot down a civilian
Iranian airliner carrying a number of government officials on a tour of
the war front between the two countries, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported here.
The Fokker F-28 Fellowship, a twin-engine turbojet, "was shot and
blown up in the sky" about 15 miles from its destination, the city of Ah
vaz, on a flight from Tehran, the official news agency said. Ahvaz is
about 50 miles from the Iraq border.
The Iraqi attack "added a new page to the criminal file ... of violating
international conventions" that proscribe the shooting down of civilian
aircraft, the news agency said.
Iraq denied that its warplanes had downed a civilian airliner. But, ac
cording to news agency reports from Baghdad, the Iraqi government
said it had shot down an Iranian C-130 military transport plane yester
day afternoon near Ahvaz.
The Iranian news agency said it was not known how many persons
were traveling on the plane, but Iran's ambassador to the United Na
tions, Rajaie Khorassani, put the number of passengers at 46 and said
everyone aboard was killed.
The IRNA report said the Fokker airliner had been chartered by the
Iranian airline company Asseman to carry government officials on a tour
of the frontline areas.
The news agency said the officials included six members of the 270-
seat Iranian Parliament and Fazollah Mahallati, who was identified as
the special representative of Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, to the Revolutionary Guards, the young radicals who are
running the war effort.
Head of Sicilian mafia arrested
PALERMO, Sicily — The long-sought fugitive "Godfather" of the
Sicilian Mafia was arrested in a police dragnet yesterday, giving an unex
pected twist to the extraordinary mass trial here of 467 Mafia bosses,
murderers, drug traffickers, racketeers, money-launderers and hangers
on.
Michele Greco, undisputed "boss of bosses" in Palermo and acknowl
edged top leader of the entire Sicilian criminal syndicate, was found with
his wife at a farmhouse near Palermo where police said the two were
living with forged identity papers.
The 62-year-old mob leader, known as II Papa (the pope), is believed
to be the chairman of the 12-man commission of Mafia bosses governing
such matters as murders, especially those of public officials, and major
moves in the syndicate's $4 billion-per-year drug trade.
Although still active as a leader until yesterday, Greco has been in
hiding since 1982 and was one of 115 fugitives being tried in absentia in
the extraordinary "maxi-trial" of 467 mafiosi that opened here last
week. Two hundred and twenty of the defendants are in jail, about 60
are under house arrest, and more than 70 are free on their own recog
nizance, according to Prosecuting Attorney Domenico Signorino.
Law enforcement officials said Greco was one of 25 criminal suspects
picked up in an island-wide sweep by hundreds of policemen, some of
them using helicopters, early yesterday morning.
His brother, Salvatore, 58, also a fugitive defendant in the mass trial,
remains at large, police said. Michele and Salvatore, whose nickname is
"the Senator," were sentenced in absentia to life in prison in 1984 for
the car-bomb assassination of anti-Mafia Judge Rocco Chinnici. That
killing was one of a number of murders of public officials that brought
about the current anti-Mafia campaign throughout Italy.
In the mass trial now proceeding in a specially built, bunker-like
courtroom here, both Grecos are charged with numerous killings, in
cluding the shooting of Italy's most respected anti-Mafia policeman,
Gen. Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, and his young wife in September
1982. They also are charged with drug trafficking and, in common with
315 of their fellow defendants, with Mafia membership, which has been
a crime in Italy since 1982.
Israel expected Jordan-PLO split
JERUSALEM — Israel's normally fractious coalition government
reacted with unusual unanimity yesterday to the announcement by Jor
dan's King Hussein that his efforts to pursue a joint Mideast peace policy
with the Palestine Liberation Organization has failed.
Both the centrists represented by Prime Minister Shimon Peres and
the rightists headed by Yitzhak Shamir, deputy prime minister and
foreign minister, said, in effect: "I told you so."
In a nationally televised, three-hour address Wednesday night, Hus
sein told his countrymen that he could no longer continue his joint
search for peace with the PLO because the organization lacks
"commitment, credibility and consistency."
"I am not surprised." Peres said yesterday."From the very beginning,
I didn't believe that something good could come out of the negotiations
with the PLO."
A statement issued by Shamir's Foreign Ministry said, "King Hussein
confirms what Israel has always said about the PLO — namely that the
PLO is an obstacle to peace, does not contribute to peace and cannot be
a partner in the peace process."
Beyond those statements, however, the senior Israeli coalition
partners sounded decidedly differing notes as they assessed the impact of
the yearlong Jordanian-PLO initiative and the prospects for the future.
An aide to Peres stressed that the Hussein-Arafat split vindicates the
prime minister's strategy of "divide and conquer." The result has been
to put Hussein back where the Peres' Labor Alignment bloc has always
wanted him — on "center stage in terms of the whole Palestinian-
Jordanian issue," the aide said.

The IRNA report said the Fokker airliner had been chartered by the
Iranian airline company Asseman to carry government officials on a tour
of the frontline areas.
The news agency said the officials included six members of the 270-
seat Iranian Parliament and Fazollah Mahallati, who was identified as
the special representative of Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, to the Revolutionary Guards, the young radicals who are
running the war effort.
Head of Sicilian mafia arrested
PALERMO, Sicily — The long-sought fugitive "Godfather" of the
Sicilian Mafia was arrested in a police dragnet yesterday, giving an unex
pected twist to the extraordinary mass trial here of 467 Mafia bosses,
murderers, drug traffickers, racketeers, money-launderers and hangers
on.
Michele Greco, undisputed "boss of bosses" in Palermo and acknowl
edged top leader of the entire Sicilian criminal syndicate, was found with
his wife at a farmhouse near Palermo where police said the two were
living with forged identity papers.
The 62-year-old mob leader, known as II Papa (the pope), is believed
to be the chairman of the 12-man commission of Mafia bosses governing
such matters as murders, especially those of public officials, and major
moves in the syndicate's $4 billion-per-year drug trade.
Although still active as a leader until yesterday, Greco has been in
hiding since 1982 and was one of 115 fugitives being tried in absentia in
the extraordinary "maxi-trial" of 467 mafiosi that opened here last
week. Two hundred and twenty of the defendants are in jail, about 60
are under house arrest, and more than 70 are free on their own recog
nizance, according to Prosecuting Attorney Domenico Signorino.
Law enforcement officials said Greco was one of 25 criminal suspects
picked up in an island-wide sweep by hundreds of policemen, some of
them using helicopters, early yesterday morning.
His brother, Salvatore, 58, also a fugitive defendant in the mass trial,
remains at large, police said. Michele and Salvatore, whose nickname is
"the Senator," were sentenced in absentia to life in prison in 1984 for
the car-bomb assassination of anti-Mafia Judge Rocco Chinnici. That
killing was one of a number of murders of public officials that brought
about the current anti-Mafia campaign throughout Italy.
In the mass trial now proceeding in a specially built, bunker-like
courtroom here, both Grecos are charged with numerous killings, in
cluding the shooting of Italy's most respected anti-Mafia policeman,
Gen. Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, and his young wife in September
1982. They also are charged with drug trafficking and, in common with
315 of their fellow defendants, with Mafia membership, which has been
a crime in Italy since 1982.
Israel expected Jordan-PLO split
JERUSALEM — Israel's normally fractious coalition government
reacted with unusual unanimity yesterday to the announcement by Jor
dan's King Hussein that his efforts to pursue a joint Mideast peace policy
with the Palestine Liberation Organization has failed.
Both the centrists represented by Prime Minister Shimon Peres and
the rightists headed by Yitzhak Shamir, deputy prime minister and
foreign minister, said, in effect: "I told you so."
In a nationally televised, three-hour address Wednesday night, Hus
sein told his countrymen that he could no longer continue his joint
search for peace with the PLO because the organization lacks
"commitment, credibility and consistency."
"I am not surprised." Peres said yesterday."From the very beginning,
I didn't believe that something good could come out of the negotiations
with the PLO."
A statement issued by Shamir's Foreign Ministry said, "King Hussein
confirms what Israel has always said about the PLO — namely that the
PLO is an obstacle to peace, does not contribute to peace and cannot be
a partner in the peace process."
Beyond those statements, however, the senior Israeli coalition
partners sounded decidedly differing notes as they assessed the impact of
the yearlong Jordanian-PLO initiative and the prospects for the future.
An aide to Peres stressed that the Hussein-Arafat split vindicates the
prime minister's strategy of "divide and conquer." The result has been
to put Hussein back where the Peres' Labor Alignment bloc has always
wanted him — on "center stage in terms of the whole Palestinian-
Jordanian issue," the aide said.
Joint peace-keeping force planned
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Nicaragua and Costa Rica have an
nounced an initiative that could lead to an international peace-keeping
force to patrol their common border. If the negotiations are successful
such a force could hamstring U.S.-backed counter-revolutionary groups
based in Costa Rica at a time when President Reagan is hoping to boost
the insurgents' activities with $ 100 million of military aid.
On Monday the deputy foreign ministers of the two countries will
meet in Managua with their counterparts from Colombia, Venezuela,
Panama and Mexico, the four nations in the so-called Contadora group,
which is mediating a Central American peace treaty.
In a letter to the Contadora group, the two governments have pledged
themselves to negotiate "the establishment of a permanent vigilance and
inspection force in the common frontier zone." The Nicaraguan deputy
foreign minister, Victor Hugo Tinoco, said he did not know if the force
would be composed of military or civilian personnel, "but such language
usually means troops."
The move comes at a time when regional peace initiatives appeared to
have run into a blank wall of U.S. resistance. Earlier this month the
foreign ministers of the eight Latin American countries involved in the
Contadora group and the support group met Secretary of State George
Shultz to seek his backing for a nine-point document to help pacify the
region.
Together with El Salvador and Honduras, Costa Rica is a member of
the "Tegucigalpa bloc," which has been working closely with Washing
ton to pressure Nicaragua's revolutionary government. However, in the
last few weeks relations between Nicaragua and Costa Rica have
dramatically improved. Diplomatic ties, which had been downgraded,
have now been restored to ambassadorial level.
In other Nicaraguan news, the Reagan Administration released a
recently declassified document which it claimed showed that Nicaragua
was attempting to influence Congressional consideration of the $100
million in aid Reagan has proposed for the contras. Critics on the Senate
Intelligence Committee, however, denounced the Administration's
move as a blatent attempt to politicize intelligence information.
Iraqi jets down Iranian airliner
TEHRAN, Iran — Iraqi warplanes yesterday shot down a civilian
Iranian airliner carrying a number of government officials on a tour of
the war front between the two countries, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported here.
The Fokker F-28 Fellowship, a twin-engine turbojet, "was shot and
blown up in the sky" about 15 miles from its destination, the city of Ah
vaz, on a flight from Tehran, the official news agency said. Ahvaz is
about 50 miles from the Iraq border.
The Iraqi attack "added a new page to the criminal file ... of violating
international conventions" that proscribe the shooting down of civilian
aircraft, the news agency said.
Iraq denied that its warplanes had downed a civilian airliner. But, ac
cording to news agency reports from Baghdad, the Iraqi government
said it had shot down an Iranian C-130 military transport plane yester
day afternoon near Ahvaz.
The Iranian news agency said it was not known how many persons
were traveling on the plane, but Iran's ambassador to the United Na
tions, Rajaie Khorassani, put the number of passengers at 46 and said
everyone aboard was killed.
