# Odyssey database lists internships
## 
### KENNETH FENYO Staff writer 
In a move aimed at linking Stanford students
with internships at home and around the world, the
University will unveil today a Socrates-style com
puter database designed to catalog campus infor
mation on intern and research opportunities.
Designed by the Internship Liaison and Advisory
Committee (ILAC), the new database, called
Odyssey, combines internship information from the
Career Planning and Placement Center (CPPC),
the Public Service Center, the Undergraduate Re
search Opportunities Clearinghouse and several
University departments.
Lynne Mason, chairman of the ILAC, said Odys
sey is "a comprehensive database. Students can
now come to one place to find out what internships
are available."
According to Sandy Laws, manager of the data
resource group of the Information Technology
Services (ITS), Odyssey will be part of the Folio
computer network. Folio also contains Socrates,
the University library system's computerized card
catalog.

Odyssey can be accessed by any terminal con
nected to the administrative computer at Forsyth
Hall, Laws said. The same accounts that students
use to log on to Socrates can also be used for Odys
sey, she said.
Odyssey's format closely resembles Socrates.
Monica Godfrey, the database coordinator for the
lALC, added, "If you know how to use Socrates,
this will be a cinch."
Students can search for internships by field, or
ganization. location and compensation, among
other topics. Each internship announcement con
tains a description of the internship, the qualifica
tions required and information on how to apply.
For example, Odyssey could be used to obtain a
listing of all internships in communications offered
in New York City at a salary of $ 1,000 a month.
Previously, information on internships was con
tained in many different files in several different
locations on campus. Odyssey "centralizes re
sources that students previously had to go to four
or five departments to get. Now they can sit down
and do it in one place," Mason said.
ILAC, in conjunction with ITS, began working
on Odyssey last June as a way for the various

offices and departments involved in internships to
share information with each other. Besides the
CPPC and the Public Service Center, members of
the committee were also represented by the Psy
chology and Communication Departments and the
Program in Human Biology.
All groups had input in the design of Odyssey,
Mason said.
"We met once a month to make sure the design
was meeting everyone's needs," Godfrey said.
Although all members of the committee assisted
in the design of the new database, Mason said the
CPPC would maintain the system.
Mason said two terminals devoted to Odyssey
will be available at the CPPC. One will be an ex
press terminal with a five-minute limit The other
account can be used by students who may need a
longer time to scan all potential opportunities.
Mason said she believes the new database would
save students considerable amounts of time, adding
that no longer will students have to spend hours
leafing through the binders of internship informa
tion.
However, Godfrey said the CPPC
does not intend to get rid of the
binders.
"We will use them as a backup.
They just won't be the primary source
anymore," she said.
Godfrey added that the CPPC "is
not expecting the student to become
self-sufficient and use our services
less." Students can still use CPPC
counselors and other resources, she
said.
Besides helping students find in
ternship opportunities faster,
Godfrey believes the new system will

also lead to more internships.
"When employees see how sophis
ticated our system is and hdw
seriously we're taking it, it will help in
developing more internships," she
said.
Odyssey currently contains infor
mation on internships offered since
August 1985, Godfrey said. All the
files, including internships offered in
previous years, are to be included in
the database by this summer.
