# Filipino aid voted down in House
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — A House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee voted unanimously yesterday to
suspend military aid to the Philippines and redirect
economic aid to private groups until President Fer
dinand Marcos steps down in favor of a "legitimate
government."
The 9-0 vote in the subcomittee on Pacific and
Asian affairs was the first concrete legislative ac
tion taken by members of Congress to express
growing dissatisfaction with Marcos' declared vic
tory in an election marred by widespread fraud and
violence. The Senate passed a resolution Wednes
day condemning the election, but that resolution is
non-binding.
The subcommittee's action yesterday was also
the first step toward expected congressional pas
sage of such legislation, which has broad bipartisan
support in both the House and Senate. The full
House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee are expected to ap
prove similar legislation next week.
"What this legislation will do is send a signal to
the people of the Philippines that the United States
has withdrawn its support for the Marcos regime
while continuing its support and assistance for the
Philippine people," said Rep. Stephen Solarz (D-
N.Y.), subcommittee chairman.
" At the same time, it will also send a signal to the
ruling elite and establishment of the Philippines
that their government no longer enjoys the support
n f i T n ;»oH States," he added.

Solarz said a political solution in the Philippines
that allowed Marcos to remain in office would not
satisfy the legislation's definition of a "legitimate
government that has the confidence of the Filipino
people" — and thus would not bring about restora
tion of U.S. aid after the suspension.
He added: "I think it is clear that you cannot
have a legitimate government with Mr. Marcos in
power." Moreover, he said he hoped that Marcos'
"dwindling band" of supporters would persuade
the Philippine president to resign now to preserve
his place in history.
Solarz, who said he had communicated with op
position leader Corazon Aquino through an inter
mediary earlier in the day, announced that the
legislation passed by his subcommittee had her sup
port. He said she "feels that it reflects her own view
of how the United States can contribute to the res
toration of democracy in the Philippines."
Reagan Administration officials refused to
embrace the subcommittee's bill, however. Paul
Wolfowitz, assistant secretary of state for East Asia
and Pacific affairs, told the subcommittee that
President Reagan would reserve judgment until he
hears a report next week from his special envoy to
the Philippines, Philip Habib.
But aides said Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee Chairman Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) was en
couraged to support the bill when he met Wednes
day with Secretary of State George Shultz. "Shultz

did not argue against it." a Lugar aide said. "He ex
pressed a desire that we all work together.'
Administration officials have repeatedly empha
sized that their position does not imply support for
Marcos.
"Our assistance does not go to individuals, but to
the economic and security needs of the Philippine
people," Wolfowitz said. "No one should claim
that U.S. assistance constitutes a personal endorse
ment or is for the purpose of supporting any indi
viduals claim to power."
Under an existing U.S. treaty with Marcos that
governs American military bases in the Philippines,
the Administration is obligated to make "a good
faith effort" to oppose any cuts in U.S. aid to the
Pacific nation.
Solarz said the bill would deprive the Philippines
Of $69.8 million in military assistance in the current
fiscal year and $70 million authorized for fiscal
1987. It also will redirect $345 million in economic
and development funds now designated for the
government to a variety of volunteer groups, in
cluding the Roman Catholic Church.
Not all military funds would be cut, however.
Solarz said an estimated $67 million already
obligated for military aid, but unspent, still will be
available to the Manila government. Nor does the
bill end funding for a program that brings Filipino
military officers to the United States for training,
he said.
