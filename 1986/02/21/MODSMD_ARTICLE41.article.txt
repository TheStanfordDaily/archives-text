# Cheers greet Reagan in Grenada
## 
### 
ST. GEORGES, Grenada —
Twenty-eight months after he or
dered a military invasion of this tiny
Caribbean island, President Reagan
told more than 20,000 cheering
Grenadians yesterday that he "will
never be sorry that I made the deci
sion to help you."
"We won't be satisfied," Reagan
said, "until all the people of the
Americas have joined us in the warm
sunshine of liberty and justice."
Grenada's Prime Minister Herbert
Blaize introduced Reagan as "our
own national hero, our own rescuer
after God." He said the crowd was
the largest ever on the island, and he
praised Reagan for having "the
courage ... to dig Grenada out of the
stinking communist hole."
U.S. troops went into Grenada in
October 1983, after the Marxist
Prime Minister Maurice Bishop was
ousted in a coup led by even more

radical politicians. Resistance by the
Grenadian army and armed Cubans
building an airport for the new
regime was quickly put down. Ameri
can troops, who had generally been
welcomed by the islanders, pulled out
about a year later.
Elliot Abrams, the assistant secre
tary of state for inter-American af
fairs, told reporters en route to
Grenada with the president on board
Air Force One, "There comes a point
— and we reached it in Grenada —
where no amount of talking will
change the situation.'
In his speech, the Reagan drew a
parallel between the situation in
Grenada in 1983 and present-day
Nicaragua.
"Today in Nicaragua we see a
chain of events similar to what hap
pened here," he said. "We hear the
same excuses made for the commu
nists, while the people of Nicaragua

see their freedom slowly but surely
eaten away."
Reagan told Grenadians that the
United States "must help those strug
gling for freedom in Nicaragua."
Asked beforehand by reporters
with advance copies of his speech if
his comparison meant that he was
prepared to use military force in
Nicaragua, he replied, "No, I think
it's an entirely different situation. We
have no plans."
However, the president is in the
middle of a campaign to win congres
sional approval for $100 million in
military and other aid to rebels fight
ing the Sandinista regime in
Nicaragua.
Reagan began his five-hour visit by
unveiling a commemorative bronze
plaque at Port Salines airport ex
pressing "the gratitude of the
Grenadian people." The airport, a
showcase facility, was started by the

Cubans and completed with $19 mil
lion supplied by Washington. Reagan
had said the airport was being built to
accommodate Soviet warplanes.
"Now it will be used to bring
tourists and businessmen instead of
bombers and spy planes," he said yes
terday. "Tourists are nicer, and
they're a lot more fun."
Between his public appearances,
Reagan met privately with the leaders
of Grenada and eight other Carib
bean countries. But he had little to
offer in terms of concrete assistance.
The administration has poured
$72.6 million in aid into Grenada
since the invasion, including the $19
million for the airport. But officials
said the aid was being scaled down, in
part because of budget cuts required
by the Gramm-Rudman balanced
budget legislation. The 1986 aid
package of $20 million is halved to
$10 million in the 1987 budget.
