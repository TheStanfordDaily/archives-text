Cold could be culprit
WASHINGTON — In recommending that the
space shuttle Challenger be launched, represen
tatives of the manufacturer of the spacecraft's
solid rocket boosters acknowledged that cold
temperatures could hamper performance of cru
cial rocket seals at liftoff but asserted that backup
seals should prevent a dangerous leak of propel
lant, documents showed yestersday.
A Morton Thiokol official confirmed that 15
mid-level engineers had remained opposed to the
decision to launch, even after four top manage
ment officials overruled them. Those engineers
were worried about how overnight subfreezing
temperatures at Kennedy Space Center, Fla.,
would affect the performance of the rockets'
seals, which increasingly has become the focus of
the investigation.
Also yesterday. Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.)
told reporters that he had talked with the Morton
Thiokol engineer who had been most vigorously
opposed to the launch and was told that the com
pany's final recommendation to consent to
launch was produced by "tremendous pressure
from NASA."

Illegal alien arrests surge
WASHINGTON — Apprehensions of illegal
aliens along the U.S.-Mexico border have surged
in the last four months, and the number of border
arrests in fiscal 1986 is expected to exceed last
year's record by at least 50 percent. Immigration
and Naturalization Service Commissioner Alan
Nelson said yestersday.
Surpassing the INS' own forecasts, arrests in
January alone soared by more than half, bringing
the total for the first four months of this fiscal
year to 43 percent ahead of the 1985 pace, Nel
son said. The 1986 arrest total now is expected to
reach 1.8 million, he added.
Economic growth slows
WASHINGTON — Economic growth at the
end of 1985 was even more sluggish than first re
ported, expanding at a bare 1.2 percent annual
rate during the year's final three months, the De
partment of Commerce said yestersday.
The report represented a steep downward revi

sion from the original growth estimate of 2.4 per
cent in the last quarter. However, growth for the
entire year remained pegged at the 2.3 percent
announced earlier.
Paradoxically, economists generally saw the
rollback as a further reason to be hopeful about
1986. They noted that it was forced primarily by
the deluge of imports in November and Decem
ber, which helped push the nation's merchandise
trade deficit to a record for the year, and by the
continued liquidation of business inventories at
an unexpectedly high rate.
Stocks spring back
NEW YORK — The stock market went back
on the offensive yesterday, rallying from a set
back in the previous session with the help of
renewed weakness in oil prices and declining in
terest rates.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
climbed 14.56 to 1,672.82, recouping most of
Wednesday s 20.52-point loss. The average
showed a decline of about 2 points heading into
the last hour of trading.
