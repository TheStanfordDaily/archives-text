Flood damage continues
Levees crumbled and hundreds of homes were
flooded yesterday as Northern California contin
ued to suffer from the battering of a week of
heavy rain.
State crews and volunteers struggled to rein
force Sacramento-San Joaquin river delta levees
like the one along the Mokelumne River that col
lapsed yesterday morning, flooding the city of
Thornton. More than 1,300 residents were
evacuated Tuesday by officials anticipating the
danger.
4 We have the highest volume of water in his
tory coming through the Sacramento River sys
tem," said Naser Bateni, supervisor of flood con
trol at the state Department of Water Resources.
"Everything is holding. We've got extra people
on the levees. We've been lucky so far."
The weather cooperated yesterday, leaving
partly cloudy skies and only a few scattered
showers over areas that had received as much as
two feet of rain in the past week, causing flooding
and mudslides that claimed at least seven lives.
Rivers and creeks continued dropping across
Northern California, allowing most of the more
than 11,000 evacuees to return to their homes to
begin cleaning up the mud and debris left behind
by the floods.

"I'm lucky," said Guerneville resident John
Kelso. "All I've got to do is pick up my life, wait
for my insurance adjuster and go through the
process."
But insurance experts said Kelso is a rarity in
the area hit hardest by the Russian River flood
waters: Only one in six people in the area have
flood insurance coverage.
As the cleanup continued in Sonoma and Napa
counties, officials in the Sacramento-San Joaquin
Delta kept a wary eye on waters that topped
flood stage in some areas, but largely were con
tained by the state's extensive system of rivers
and dams.
Bus billboards banned
FRESNO — Saying a municipal bus is not a
constitutionally protected public forum, a state
appellate court ruled that Fresno had a right to
ban political advertising on city buses.
In January 1981, the anti-war group Women's
International League for Peace and Freedom ran
posters on the sides of city buses proclaiming:
"Think before you register."
The message was aimed at a law requiring
young men to register for the draft within a
month of their 18th birthday even though there is
no draft.

The city ordered the ads removed on grounds
that the content violated a city ordinance banning
political messages on municipal buses.
Superior Court Judge Frank Creede later
found the ordinance was an unconstitutional in
vasion of the right to free speech, but he refused
to order the city to carry the advertising.
The judge said the slogan could be interpreted
to mean "don't register," encouraging an illegal
act which cannot be protected by the right to free
speech.
Both sides appealed sections of Creede's ruling
that were adverse to their respective positions.
The sth District Court of Appeals, in a deci
sion filed Tuesday, limited its decision to the con
stitutionality of Fresno's ban on political adver
tising.
The justices cited previous rulings which found
that a bus is not a public forum and its passengers
are "captive audiences" of any advertising be
cause many commuters have no other practical
means of transportation.
At least no snow today
Partly cloudy skies will (partly) cover Stanford
today and tonight as temperatures range from
highs in the mid-60s to lows in the low-50s. No
snow is expected.
