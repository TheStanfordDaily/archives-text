# Student conference: making a difference

### C.R. DOUGLAS Staff writer 
"No man is an island." For the
public service leaders on campus,
this John Donne quote captures
the essence of tomorrow's "You
Can Make a Difference Confer
ence."

Feature

Co-sponsored by the Public
Management Program of the
Graduate School of Business and
the Public Service Center, the con
ference is intended to show how
different groups of society relate
by addressing issues that affect us
all, such as the role of corporations

in society and the environment.
Entitled "Private Initiatives and
Public Responsibilities," the con
ference will spotlight people who
have made a positive influence in
the public sector. According to its
organizers, the conference will
raise the important question of
how much (if any) public responsi
bility rests on individuals, private
organizations and the government
sector.
In light of the recent national
debate over the Gramm-Rudman
budget proposal, the public service
conference has become quite
timely. "Are we all content to
have government pull back?" asks
Catherine Milton, director of the
Public Service Center and one of the
leaders of the conference.
According to Milton, programs for
health care, hunger and affirmative
action will be cut back drastically by
the Gramm-Rudman proposal. It will
be up to the private sector and state
government to pick up the slack, she
claimed.
Some of the speakers scheduled to
talk at the conference include Dr.
Herbert Abrams, co-founder of the
International Physicians for the Pre
vention of Nuclear War; David
Geyer, president of the Save the
Children Federation; and John
Young, president of Hewlett Pack
ard.
Business school student Linda Chin
has been involved in the conference
planning since last fall. Chin has
channeled most of her energy into
formulating the afternoon workshop
entitled "Ethnic Communities: A
Model for Grassroots Organizing."
Speakers for this workshop include
Commissioner Thomas Hsieh from
the Asian American Organization of
San Francisco, Jose Juarez, who
handles class action suits for Mexican
Americans in San Antonio, Tex., and
Fania Davis, sister of black activist
Angela Davis and leader of the East
Palo Alto Law Project.
As moderator of the seminar, Chin
said she hopes the different speakers
will emphasize the same issues. She
expressed her belief that ethnic com
munities face the same issues and that
more awareness of their common
concerns will better equip them to
tackle the difficult problems each
community faces.

"I hope the seminar brings out
whether these groups have similar
agendas — similar issues they are at
tacking — and if there is any way we
can coordinate these agendas," she
said.
Education student Anna Waring
has also been involved in the confer
ence since last fall. Her participation
has included a seat on the conference
steering committee as well as one on

the panel responsibile for the confer
ence's education seminar.
"The seminar will focus on what
can and should be done to improve or
enhance what is already being done in
the teaching profession," said
Waring.
The conference will be in two parts.
The morning session will begin with
the keynote speaker Frank Newman,
president of the Education Commis
sion of the States. Newman's speech,
"The University as a Force of Public
Responsibility: Would Jefferson
Love Us If He Could See Us Now?"
will be followed by a roundtable dis

cussion of world priorities moderated *
by NBC "Nightly News" anchor Tom
Brokaw.
The afternoon session will consist
of simultaneous seminars that covers
everything from technology to
hunger.
"It is important to see this confer-'"*
ence as of the renewed interest in
public service on this campus. There
is a conscious reawakening that there'
is more to a career than serving.,
oneself," explained Mark Ventresca,-'
one of the conference planners and a -
graduate student in education.
Milton echoed this viewpoint when
she reflected on her objectives for the 1
conference. "One important purpose
of the conference is to encourage
people to get involved in public ser-»
vice here at Stanford and after-'<
wards," she said.
Virtually all the members of the
conference planning committee are
anticipating a big success. In fact, op
timism is at a high enough level that
initial planning has already started for
next year's conference.
Junior Jean Kayser has started a
group that is tossing around ideas for
next year's conference theme. "I
think public service is a good cause to
continue at Stanford. By starting the
planning for next year's conference
early, we will be able to get more stu-.
dents involved in input and
tion," he said.
Students who are interested in get-',-
ting involved in next year's confer- r
ence can attend Kayser's first general,
meeting Wednesday at noon in
Tresidder 132. , r
Until then, the focus of attention is
still on tomorrow's conference. Tick
ets for the conference may be ob
tained at either the Public Service
Center or the Public Management
Program at the Business School.
