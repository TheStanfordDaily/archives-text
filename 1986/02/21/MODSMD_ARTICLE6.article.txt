# Board revises groups' funds

### R.TAEZA PIERCE Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Program Board has
voted to recommend annual fund
ing for two campus Asian-
American organizations, revising a
decision last week to suggest no
money for the groups.
The revision, which came at the
end of the first round of the board's
new appeals process, put to rest
some of the controversy and confu
sion surrounding the initial recom
mendation, according to the
board's director and a representa
tive of the Stanford Asian-

American community.
Shirley Wang, chairperson of the
Asian American Students' Associa
tion (A ASA), said she was glad her
group had the chance to appeal but
felt the board "should have made
(the process) more clear to us."
Both AASA and the Asian-
American Activities Center had
received recommendations for zero
funding from the board early last
week. AASA members, who say
they were unaware of the appeals
process, circulated petitions calling
for a reversal of the decision and
received about 200 student
signatures.

Following a second meeting with
AAS A and center representatives,
the board revised the initial recom
mendation, suggesting the ASSU
Senate Appropriations Committee
alot $1,465 to the A ASA and
$1,735 to the center — an of
fice/resource center serving all
campus Asian-American organiza
tions — for 1986-87. The board
also recommended increased fund
ing for six of the nine other student
organizations that submitted re
quests for reconsideration follow
ing the initial results.
