# Board revises groups' funds
## 
### R.TAEZA PIERCE Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Program Board has
voted to recommend annual fund
ing for two campus Asian-
American organizations, revising a
decision last week to suggest no
money for the groups.
The revision, which came at the
end of the first round of the board's
new appeals process, put to rest
some of the controversy and confu
sion surrounding the initial recom
mendation, according to the
board's director and a representa
tive of the Stanford Asian-

American community.
Shirley Wang, chairperson of the
Asian American Students' Associa
tion (A ASA), said she was glad her
group had the chance to appeal but
felt the board "should have made
(the process) more clear to us."
Both AASA and the Asian-
American Activities Center had
received recommendations for zero
funding from the board early last
week. AASA members, who say
they were unaware of the appeals
process, circulated petitions calling
for a reversal of the decision and
received about 200 student
signatures.

Following a second meeting with
AAS A and center representatives,
the board revised the initial recom
mendation, suggesting the ASSU
Senate Appropriations Committee
alot $1,465 to the A ASA and
$1,735 to the center — an of
fice/resource center serving all
campus Asian-American organiza
tions — for 1986-87. The board
also recommended increased fund
ing for six of the nine other student
organizations that submitted re
quests for reconsideration follow
ing the initial results.
This marks the Program Board's
first use of a formal appeals process.
In the past, the board made a final
recommendation after reviewing
proposals and conducting interviews
with representatives from each group.
Groups could only lobby the Appro
priations Committee or the senate in
formally after the Program Board
made its recommendation, according
to Eugene Chen, chairman of the
board.
"In response to some complaints
that the board was a black box,"
Chen said the board instituted an ap
peals process to make itself "more
responsive" to students.
The Program Board now invites
groups that either fail to submit a
complete budget proposal or are not
satisfied with the initial recommenda
tion to submit a short proposal for
reconsideration.
One of the problems Chen said he
saw with the process this time was
that while the board made an effort to
state why a recommendation was
made, groups could not always tell
from the recommendation what the
problem with their funding proposal
was.
Wang said when A AS A learned of
the initial recommendations last week
she had "no idea" the board had an
appeals process. A sheet posted on
the ASSU window stated that both

AAS A and the center had received
zero recommendations, and it said
that only AAS A needed to supply
more detailed information regarding
programming. No mention was made
on the recommendation of the prob
lem with the center's proposal.
AASA's original budget proposal
mentioned the names of proposed
programs, but did not provide detail
on the events or the purpose behind
offering them. At the board s request,
AASA submitted a supplementary
sheet following the first interview that
clarified each event and its function
as part of AASA's program for the
year. Chen said the additional infor
mation helped the board to make a
more informed decision in favor of
AASA, recommending nearly half of
the $3,881 requested, which he called
"way above average."
Chen said the center posed a
greater problem because the board
could not discern from the budget
proposal and the first interview ex
actly what the role of the office was.
"It seemed to be just another office
for a very small number of students"
to use, he said.
At the second meeting between the
board and AASA last night, Chen
said it became "clear that it was a
place used by seven student groups
and a place where seven student
groups had their offices, had their ac
tivities and had their office supplies."
The board has recommended the
center receive $ 1,735 of the
$3,492.75 requested.

the $3,881 requested, which he called
"way above average."
Chen said the center posed a
greater problem because the board
could not discern from the budget
proposal and the first interview ex
actly what the role of the office was.
"It seemed to be just another office
for a very small number of students"
to use, he said.
At the second meeting between the
board and AASA last night, Chen
said it became "clear that it was a
place used by seven student groups
and a place where seven student
groups had their offices, had their ac
tivities and had their office supplies."
The board has recommended the
center receive $ 1,735 of the
$3,492.75 requested.
