# SOAR not eligible for ballot

### ELAINE RIGGS Editorial staff 
The Stanford Outdoor Activities and Recreation Club
(SOAR) is not a student organization and consequently
cannot receive student funding, the ASSU Senate Appro
priations Committee decided Wednesday night.
The decision prevents SOAR's special fee request from
being placed on the ballot in the upcoming elections.
SOAR had asked the ASSU for $20,000 to finance the
"one-time capital expense" of setting up a ski rental ser
vice at Tresidder Union, according to SOAR Chairman
Kent Borowick. SOAR planned to rent the equipment to
students at prices competitive with off-campus rentals.
But Senator Mary Thurber, a member of the commit
tee, said she questioned whether students would have
control of SOAR's money.
"SOAR's connection with Tresidder was not detailed
. . . we didn't know where the $20,000 would go," Thur

ber said. "Our concern was, 'Would the students actually
have control over the ski rentals?' "
The committee defined SOAR as a chartered organiza
tion, one in which "substantial control is held by someone
(other than the students)," according to ASSU Senate
Chair Carey White.
"The members of the SOAR club can be vetoed by
Tresidder," White said. "That was a real problem and that
alone disqualified them from being a student organiza
tion. It is difficult to show that SOAR is really controlled
by student leaders."
Borowick disagreed. "The students of SOAR are di
rectly in control of the (ski rental) program," he said.
"Tresidder has turned everything over to us except hiring
and firing of an adviser . . . or student."
White said the committee's vote to make SOAR a char
tered organization was in part a preventative measure de-
signed to keep students from paying
unforeseen costs.
"We need to be sure in the future
that the indirect costs wouldn't later
be unloaded on SOAR, like once
they get the special fee then Tresid
der could pass on more costs," White
said, adding that the additional costs
would then be passed on to students.
The committee asked Borowick to
provide a letter from Tresidder
stating that "over the next five years,
Tresidder won't pass on any more
" White said. The letter offered

assurance of no additional costs "only
in the present tense," White said.
However, Borowick said, "The let
ter we got from Tresidder was an in
tention to continue support of this
program. There is no reason to
believe bad faith on the part of the
letter."
Through the University, Tresidder
has agreed to make space available in
the student union for the program, he
said.
"Had we asked the students to pay
for the whole (program), it probably
would have gotten on the ballot and
been eligible," Borowick said.
"However, because we went to the
University and asked for support (all
tion to help finance the ASSU's ef
forts to hire an outside investigator to
report on the October incident, citing
the University-requested report
prepared by Law Prof. John Kaplan
as "inadequate."
Kaplan said yesterday that while he
finds nothing wrong in principle with
the idea of a police review commis
sion, he has doubts as to the effective
ness of such a group organized solely
by the ASSU.
"I'm very dubious that more than a
few ASSU groupies on the faculty
will participate, with the integrity
which the ASSU has shown so far on
this issue," Kaplan said, in reference
to his earlier charges that the ASSU's
evaluation of his report was inac
curate.

but the capital), we are ineligible,"
Borowick said.
Thurber said the committee also
considered the number of students
who would benefit from the ski rental
program. "The idea is great, but just
how many students would be
serviced? Also, it's setting up a very
risky business," she said.
Borowick submitted the results of a
telephone survey aimed at estimating
student interest in recreation services.
Tresidder Union conducted the sur
vey on behalf of the University.
One of the questions on the survey
asked, "If [ski rental services] were
available at Tresidder and the price
was competitive, how likely would

you be to use them here, on a scale
from one to five where one is
definitely not and five is definitely
yes?"
Forty-five percent of the 406 Re
spondents indicated a three, four or
five in response to the question,
showing interest in the ski service, ac
cording to Borowick, who noted that
24 percent of the students responding
indicated that they would
"definitely" use the service.
"I'm really surprised that I've had
all these problems," Borowick said;
When asked if there was any future
for the ski rental program, Borowick
said, "probably not."

The Stanford Outdoor Activities and Recreation Club
(SOAR) is not a student organization and consequently
cannot receive student funding, the ASSU Senate Appro
priations Committee decided Wednesday night.
The decision prevents SOAR's special fee request from
being placed on the ballot in the upcoming elections.
SOAR had asked the ASSU for $20,000 to finance the
"one-time capital expense" of setting up a ski rental ser
vice at Tresidder Union, according to SOAR Chairman
Kent Borowick. SOAR planned to rent the equipment to
students at prices competitive with off-campus rentals.
But Senator Mary Thurber, a member of the commit
tee, said she questioned whether students would have
control of SOAR's money.
"SOAR's connection with Tresidder was not detailed
. . . we didn't know where the $20,000 would go," Thur

ber said. "Our concern was, 'Would the students actually
have control over the ski rentals?' "
The committee defined SOAR as a chartered organiza
tion, one in which "substantial control is held by someone
(other than the students)," according to ASSU Senate
Chair Carey White.
"The members of the SOAR club can be vetoed by
Tresidder," White said. "That was a real problem and that
alone disqualified them from being a student organiza
tion. It is difficult to show that SOAR is really controlled
by student leaders."
Borowick disagreed. "The students of SOAR are di
rectly in control of the (ski rental) program," he said.
"Tresidder has turned everything over to us except hiring
and firing of an adviser . . . or student."
White said the committee's vote to make SOAR a char
tered organization was in part a preventative measure de-
signed to keep students from paying
unforeseen costs.
"We need to be sure in the future
that the indirect costs wouldn't later
be unloaded on SOAR, like once
they get the special fee then Tresid
der could pass on more costs," White
said, adding that the additional costs
would then be passed on to students.
The committee asked Borowick to
provide a letter from Tresidder
stating that "over the next five years,
Tresidder won't pass on any more
" White said. The letter offered

assurance of no additional costs "only
in the present tense," White said.
However, Borowick said, "The let
ter we got from Tresidder was an in
tention to continue support of this
program. There is no reason to
believe bad faith on the part of the
letter."
Through the University, Tresidder
has agreed to make space available in
the student union for the program, he
said.
"Had we asked the students to pay
for the whole (program), it probably
would have gotten on the ballot and
been eligible," Borowick said.
