# Philippines tensions increasing
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Editorial staff 
Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos declared a
state of emergency today in an effort to quell a revolt led
by two top military leaders who are forming a provisional
government headed by opposition presidential candidate
Corazon Aquino.
Marcos, in a broadcast over the government television
station, declared, "I intend to stay on as president." But
the broadcast went off the air abruptly, cutting off Marcos
in mid-sentence as a rebel force took over the station.
Meanwhile, Aquino claimed triumph over Marcos and
asked for massive demonstrations around the rebellious
military leaders "to consolidate that victory."
In Washington, President Reagan said the United
States would cut off all military aid to Marcos if the
loyalist military attacked the insurgents.

As tensions continued to flare yesterday, Stanford
scholars and Filipino students here predicted that Marcos
and his followers will be ousted soon.
"Marcos is going to fall," said Ramon Abrocosa, a
former assistant professor of engineering at the University
of the Philippines who is currently studying at Stanford.
"It's only a matter of time."
Marcos' diminishing power has been caused primarily
by the resignations of former Defense Minister Juan
Ponce Enrile and former Deputy Armed Forces Chief Lt.
Gen. Fidel Ramos on Saturday, according to Ramon
Myers, a Hoover Institution senior research fellow.
"The big blow came when those two rebelled. It
precipitated the split in his camp," Myers said.
Some Filipino students expressed caution over the pos
sible benefit that Aquino's forces could gain from the
resignations of Enrile and Ramos. The two former Marcos
supporters "say that they no longer believe that Marcos
won, but [their resignations] are also to save themselves.
There is definitely an element of self-interest there,"
Abrocosa said.
"Aquino is trying to distance herself from the military
defectors . .. of course she would want them to back her
up, but their eventual interests have yet to be estab
lished," Abrocosa said.
Orher students echoed this catftfon. "The defection
complicates^matters 1 a great deal," said Robert Teh, a
Filipino student studying economics here. "Now we have
a third force (the military) competing for political power.
Before it was only legal opposition."
Teh said he feels "a little suspicious about their
motives. They've served in Marcos' government for 20
years."
Predictions were varied on the course of action that the
U.S. government will take. "Clearly the U.S. is not going
to support Marcos any more," Myers said. "It's likely the
American Embassy would fly him somewhere. He'd prob
ably have to go kicking and screaming."
Whether or not the U.S. government would support a
potential government headed by Aquino is also an issue in
question. "It is difficult to tell whether the U.S. would rec
ognize Aquino's presidency at all," Teh said. Aquino
"hasn't made her intentions clear about the U.S. bases (in
the Philippines)."
Political Science Prof. David Abernethy said, however,
that he believes the Reagan Administration would sup
port a new Aquino government.
